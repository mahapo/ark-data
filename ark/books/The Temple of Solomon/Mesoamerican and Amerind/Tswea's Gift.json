I attempted to describe one people's view ofmagic from the ground up and to show how magical practices aregoverned by deep-seated notions of causality-thatis, a sense ofhow things happen in the world. Yet even as the work came intoprint, the debate about magic was ebbing, victim both of analyticalexhaustion and changing intellectual fashion. Some anthropologistshad come to feel that study of the rituals and myths of the world'sindigenous peoples was morally suspect, because it focused on theexotic while drawing attentionaway from urgent political andeconomic realities. No doubt the academic pendulum will event-ually swing back toward concern with ritual-whichis, after all, apotent vehicle for the construction of new meanings in times oftrouble. For the moment, however, magic has lost some of its lusteras an object of academic interest.But books, like children, often find a place in the world that theircreators never imagined. In the late 1980s, the ecological crisis ofthe Amazon rainforest became a matter of worldwide concern, asdid the native peoples who have skillfully managed this complexecosystem for centuries.Tsewa's Gifthas found a readership amongpeople curious about how rainforest peoples envision the linksbetween nature and culture.

When I last visited Aguarunavillages in the Alto Rio Mayo in 1986, the national crisis had notdramatically affected everyday life. A year later, however, a Marxistguerrilla group called the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movementopened a front in the Alto Mayo valley, leading to a temporarymilitarizationof the region. News reports from Peru suggest thatthe guerrilla presence has now stabilized into a low-level insurgencymore akin to common banditry than to real warfare. Fortunately,the Aguaruna of the Alto Mayo have thus far been spared theatrocities visited upon Indians in other regions of the country.The Aguaruna communities to the north of the Alto Mayo havelong suffered a military presence because of their proximity toPeru's contested border with Ecuador. Astrid Bant, a Dutch anthro-pologist who conducted fieldwork in Aguaruna communities in thelate 1980s and early 1990s, informs me that most villages in theborder region have been relatively untouched by political violenceand by the cholera epidemic that has affected thousands on thePeruvian coast. The Indians' struggle to protect their lands fromcolonization and harmful forms of development continues unabated,however. In 1992, the Aguaruna joined with a neighboring people, theHuambisa, to denounce the environmentally destructive activities ofa Texas firm that is prospecting for oil in their territory. Moresignificant from a long-term perspective is a decline in the productiv-ity of Aguaruna lands as a growing populationputs increasedpressure on a shrinking land base.One symptom of social malaise is the extraordinarily high rateof suicide among women and adolescents,a problem that hascaptured the attentionof Peru's popular press and caused greatconsternationamong the Aguaruna themselves.The causes ofsuicide are complex, but they reflect in part the breakdown oftraditional roles and institutions that helped people deal emotionallywith family conflicts.Although the shadow of suicide weighs heavily on communitylife, the Aguaruna have responded to recent challenges throughsocial mobilization. The Aguaruna-HuambisaCouncil is still oneof the most effective Indian organizations in Peru. In South America'srapidly growing Indian federations, the Aguaruna playa role similarto that of the Sioux among North American Indians: they areforceful and articulate advocates for the cause of Indian rights andenvironmentalconservation.

Neighborsgather to share conversation and perhaps even to dance, providedthere is enough manioc beer and a festive mood prevails.On one rainy day, I talked with Shaiian Wajai about the meansby which human beings think. \"Do people think with their headsor their hearts?\" I asked him. The verbanentaimat,\"to think,\" issimilar to the nounanentai,\"heart,\" and some people had told methat this is because we think with our hearts. Yet it is not unusualfor Aguaruna parents to exhort a child to let advice \"enter yourhead,\" perhaps in recognition of the prevailing non-Indian beliefabout the seat of intellect. So my question to Shaiian was a plea forclarification. He drank from a bowl of beer that his wife held out tohim, then said deliberately, \"The people who say that we think withour heads are wrong because we think with our hearts. The heart isconnected to the veins, which carry the thoughts in the bloodthrough the entire body. The brain is only connected to the spinalcolumn, -isn't it? So if we thought with our brains, we would onlybe able to move the thought as far as our anus!\"Behind Shaiian's piquant humor lies a great concern with thenature, quality, and uses of human thought. Many of the Aguarunachildrearingpracticesof the past were intendedto make the heartstrong, the thoughts \"straight\" or correct. One important aspect ofdeveloped thought is the ability to accomplish the practical activi-ties by which the Aguaruna define themselves as human beings.Inthe course of completing these tasks, people employ many proce-dures that are not easily accommodated within the category \"tech-nology\": they perform songs to attract game and help their gardensgrow; they alter their diet so that the foods they eat will not inter-fere with the project at hand; they attempt to manipulate the emo-tions of loved ones through the power of special animal, vegetable,and mineral substances. Because the efficacy of these procedures is19 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Theoretical es-says on magical thought-draw heavily on two ethnographies-E.E.Evans-Pritchard'sWitchcraft, Oracles, and Magic AmongtheAzande(1937) and Bronislaw Malinowski'sCoral Gardens andTheir Magic(1935)-fortheir inspiration. As admirable as theseclassic works are, they represent only a minute portion of the eth-nographic record. There is still a pressing need for fine-grained ac-counts of magic as it is understood and practiced in specific soci-eties.This book examines the magical practices of the Aguaruna, anative people of the Upper Amazon. In the course of this examina-tion,Iwill attempt to show how magic makes sense to the Agu-aruna, given their representations of reality. As we shall see, theAguaruna do not think of magic as an activity totally different fromreligion, mythology, or even instrumental action. Indeed, one of theobjects of this study is to establish that from the native point ofview magic does not differ qualitatively from practical activity, noris its logic independent of prevailing notions of material causality.At this point, the attentive reader may be asking, \"If magic isnot clearly distinguished from other pursuits, why use the term atall?\" This question admits of no easy answer. \"Magic\" has longbeen viewed as a problematic label. The publication of essays thatattempt to distinguish magic from religion, science, or technologyis almost a cottage industry in the field of anthropology. Morere-cently, critics have charged that \"magic\" is a catchall for \"thoseoperationswhichthe agentsconsiderefficaciousbut whichthescientific observer thinks deluded\" (Peel 1969:73). Jeanne Favret-Saada (1980:195) argues that this negative definition of magic issimply a sly means of defining magical practitioners as exotic \"oth-ers\" so that the anthropologist is absolved of the need to probedeeper into truly different ways of seeing the world.Nevertheless, \"magic\" does serve as a convenient, if flawed,term for a congeries of phenomena that are difficult for Westernobservers to understand. After exploring various alternatives, in-cluding a complete purging of the term from this book, I have de-cided to pay reluctant homage to our intellectual history by using\"magic\" to label the beliefs and practicesIdocument here.Awork-ing definition that has the rare virtue of brevity is provided by J.

Since a detailedanalysis of the Aguaruna's entire magical repertoire would result ina text of unwieldy proportions,Ihave chosen to focus on magicalintervention in subsistence activities and marital relations-kindsof magic that the Aguaruna practice almost exclusively in private.Provision for private magic-thatis, ritual undertaken in isola-tion-israrely made in theories of ritual performance. Many an-thropologists choose to focus on the effects that the ritual healersproduce in their patients through the mind-body connection or pla-cebo effect. Alternatively, they develop theories that draw attentionto the social aspects of rituals-theirrhetorical content and theunconscious messages they may communicate. There is no ques-tion that ritual can be an important form of social action. Neverthe-less, it is illuminating to look at ritual procedures that have shed atleast some of their social skin, their tissue of political and eco-nomic and interpersonal contingency. In private magic, we have theopportunity to observe collective representations being put to workby individuals for practical ends (cf. O'Keefe1982: 14).Interpretations of MagicThough much maligned by his intellectual descendants, Sir JamesFrazer is usually credited with being the first to adopt a systematicapproach to the study of magic. InThe Golden Bough,Frazer bringstogether a bewildering array of magical practices recorded alloverthe worldandorganizes them according to a limited number ofthemes. Frazer's work introduces two inductive laws of magic, theLaw of Similarity and the Law of Contagion, which in multiplereincarnations are still with us today in most analyses of magicalacts. By thus reducing the apparent diversity of magic to a series ofvariations on the themes of similarity and contagion, Frazer's intentis to demonstrate that magical thought is based on an ordered sys-tem of natural laws not unlike those of science, the difference beingIntroduction21 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Evans-Pritchard'sWitchcraft, Ora-cles, and Magic Among the Azande(1937) argues that, first, thepractitioners of magic do not necessarily confuse magical rites withpractical action; second, that a system of magical beliefs may beinternally coherent and logical; and third, that the people who sub-scribe to such beliefs are able to maintain a skeptical attitude to-ward their own traditions, although this skepticism is sufficientlylimited that the fallacies of the system are never brought to light.Malinowski'sCoral Gardens and Their Magic(1935) asserts thatthe Trobriand Islanders, like the Azande, do not confuse magicalaction with practical, instrumentalaction. For Malinowski, how-ever, magic is not an intellectual process, a means for understand-ing the causes of ·good luck or misfortune, as it is for Evans-Pritchard; rather, it is an emotional response to uncontrollableforces-disease,plant growth, the weather, and so on. The irony ofCoral Gardensis that while Malinowski is committed to a psycho-logical explanation of magic, he takes us on an engaging journeythrough Trobriand intellectual life as revealed in the complex tropesused in gardening spells. Over the years, Malinowski's documenta-tion of the intellectual aspects of magic has proved as influential ashis theories of magic's putative psychological origins.Throughout much of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, witchcraftand sorcery attracted more attention than humbler magical pur-suits, and in many of these studies (e.g., Kluckhohn 1944, Marwick1965) the principal issues are the psychological causes and socialeffects of magic rather than its internal logic. The question of whythe members of a given society do not or cannot see the inconsist-encies in their system of beliefs, first raised forcefully by Evans-Pritchard, thus remained dormant until resurrected by Robin Hor-ton and others in the late 1960s. Horton (1967) systematicallyreviews the similarities and differences between the intellectualsystems that support magical and scientific modes of thought.While noting that the two have much in common, Horton arguesthat \"traditional thought\" of the sort that supports magic lacks aconcern with formal logic-thinkingabout thinking-andis thusprevented from seeing beyond itself, thereby arriving at the kind ofuncompromising skepticism that is supposed to characterize West-ern science.

Using words that echoFrazer's, Levi-Strauss points out that both magic and science arebased on meticulousobservation of the natural world, but whilemagic calls upon \"perception and imagination,\" science is a stepremoved from those faculties (1966:15).The modes of thought that underlie magic (or any other form ofritual) are not universally regarded as germane to the understandingof its meaning. Edmund Leach (1968:523) states that \"the actor'sown view is inadequate\" for the interpretation of ritual; he bluntlyasserts that \"the rite is prior to the explanatory belief\" (ibid.:524).Leach quite rightly points out that a ritual such as the Roman Cath-olic Mass is relatively invariant in its form, while the beliefs thatmotivate worshipers may vary greatly. Thus Leach, like other advo-cates of what has come to be known as the \"symbolist\" interpreta-tion of ritual, attempts to \"establish the explanatory priority of rit-ual action over the rationalizingbeliefs which accompanyit\"(Skorupski 1976:43).1The insights of the symbolist approach are acquired at consid-erable cost. One is bound to feel vaguely dissatisfied with an \"ex-planation\" that has little or nothing to say about the motives thatcause members of a given society to act the way they do. John Sko-rupski (1976:48) notes that the thoughts of the participant are ofmore than passing human interest; they are, in fact, essential to anunderstanding of ritual in any comprehensive sense.To the extent that symbolist theories of magic address them-selves at all to the question of motive and belief, they advance theargument that magical practitioners think of themselves as engag-ing in \"expressive\" acts rather than \"instrumentalIIones. Throughmagic they are trying tosaysomething rather thandosomething.They do not intend their magic to work in the same sense that theyintend more prosaic practical acts to work. John Beattie (1970:245)makes this point when he says that the magician knows that \"whenhe was making magic he was performing a rite, not applying lawsof nature, however dimly apprehended,\"S.J.Tambiah echoes thisview in his celebrated reinterpretationof Malinowski's account ofTrobriand spells:It is a truer tribute to the savage mind to say that, rather than beingconfused by verbal fallacies or acting in defiance of known physicallaws, it ingeniously conjoins the expressive and metaphorical proper-ties of language with the operational and empirical processes of tech-nical activity ....Let me emphasize that there is only a simulation in-volved here (Tambiah 1968:202).Introduction23 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Leach, who shares with Beattie and Tambiahthe conviction that one must distinguish between these two typesof phenomena,defines them in the following way. Instrumentalacts (or \"technical acts,\" as Leach prefers to call them) \"serve toalter the physical state of the world out there-digginga hole in theground, boiling an egg,\" and so on (Leach1976:9).Expressive acts,he continues, \"simply say something about the state of the worldas it is, or else purport to change it by metaphysicalmeans\"[ibid.tv].As an example of the difference between instrumentalandexpressive acts, Leach contrasts the Sinhalese peasant who uses ahammer to drive a stake into the ground with one who stands stilland utters a spell when faced with a charging elephant; the latterexpressive action is \"palpably quite differentin kind\"from the for-mer instrumentalaction (ibid.:30, emphasis in original). This caseillustrates the muddle into which Leach has gotten himself, forsurely the man who stands still as the elephant charges is doingsomething quite \"instrumental\"from our point of view and, nodoubt, from his. Nor can Leach's formulation be reconciled withaccounts that, following Marx, demonstrate the expressive qualityof practical labor itself (e.g., Sahlins1976,Chevalier1982,Feeley-Harnik1984).Purposeful acts always \"say something about thestate of the world\" even as they endeavor to change it.It is in the analysis of the use of objects for magical ends thatsymbolist theories face their greatest challenge. Leach mentions di-rect physical contact as an important defining characteristic of in-strumentalacts, yet even a brief review of the literature turns upcases in which direct contact is essential for \"expressive\" magicalprocedures to have an effect. Obvious examples include the practiceof bringing a love charm into contact with the object of one's affec-tion or the procedures by which plant substances are rubbed on ahunter's weapon. Tambiah(1968:194)argues that this use of objectsmerely mimics technology by \"clothing a metaphorical procedurein the operational or manipulative mode of practical action.\" Al-though I wouldn't deny that metaphor or analogy figure in this pro-cess-surelythey do-itis clear that one cannot assume a priorithat the performer sees this metaphorical act as inherently differentfrom an operational act.If, as Clifford Geertz(1973:34)suggests, the function of socialscience is to \"seek complexity and orderit,\"it is imperative that we24Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

This is not necessarily to subscribe to a simple-minded literalism that makes thought completely determinative ofaction. Ideology may well mystify reality in some instances. Buthuman action always takes place in a world charged with meaning,and any account that fails to investigate systematically the complexconnections between acts and motives is, in a very important sense,impoverished.The convention in anthropology has been to contrast \"magi-cal,\" \"mystical,\" or \"symbolic\" thought with the kind of common-sense, \"rational\"thought that people apply in practical matters.Yet, as I shall show in this book, magic is by no means a closedsystem of symbolic relations, cut off from lived experience. It has,as Marcel Mauss and Henri Hubert(1972 [1902]:141)said long ago,\"dealt with material things, carried out real experiments, and evenmade its own discoveries.\" A satisfying theory of symbolizationmust come to grips with the undeniable links between magic andits material effects, between symbolic thought and practical reason.Attempts to redefine the links between symbolic processingand practical activity tend to work on two levels: the cognitive orpsychological and the sociological. Dan Sperber(1975, 1980, 1982)is prominent among those who have focused attention on the cog-nitive domain. Sperber denies that symbolic thinking is ontogenet-ically prior to (and therefore more primitive than) rational thinking;rather, it works in tandem with rational thought to process infor-mation and solve problems. In the absence of factual data, the mindsearches long-term memory for \"symbolic evocations\" or looselyassociated thoughts that are then interpreted by the \"rational de-vice.\" Although many aspects of Sperber's ambitious program cryout for clarification, it does represent a powerful argument thatsymbolism is an integral part of all cognition, not just a processrelegated to \"religious\" or \"magical\" behavior. Symbolic thought,Sperber asserts, is a \"particularly creative form of problem solving\"(1980:43).Sperber's insights complementthe poststructuralistconcernwith the relationship between thought-of and lived-in orders. In aprovocative analysis of economy, ideology, and culture changeamong the Campa of Amazonian Peru, Jacques Chevalier(1982)ex-presses his misgivings about the predilection of social scientists toassume a \"differentiation between elements of action and those ofmeaning, or between the realm of material activity and the psycho-logical process of human signification\"(1982:4).Chevalier insteadIntroduction25 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Specifically, I wish toshow how the Aguaruna accommodate \"instrumental\"and \"ex-pressive\" acts within one general framework of causality. Put inslightly different, and perhaps more pretentious, terms, my goal isto interpret magical thought and action in terms of Aguaruna on-tology, or theories of the nature of existence.The approach followed here is frankly literalist in that it seeksto illuminate magical acts and utterances in terms of Aguaruna no-tions of their intended purpose. This is not to say, however, thatevery statement about magic need be taken at face value. Like allhuman beings, the Aguaruna are able to say things \"in quotes\"-toperform acts or make statementsthat require a symbolic ratherthan a literal interpretation.But the greatest care must be takenbefore asserting that a given declaration is issued in inverted com-mas, lest we construe a statement encapsulating some truly differ-ent way of looking at the world as a \"merely poetic\" utterance.In chapters1and2,I offer a brief overview of Aguaruna sociallife and world view, paying particular attention to ideas of how hu-man beings come to control events in their world. Chapters3through 5 detail the use of magical techniques in three importantarenas of daily life-hunting,horticulture, and domestic relations.In each case, a description of the activity's technical and social con-text is followed by an analysis of the magical procedures pertinentto that domain. I particularly want to call attention to the web ofcognitive associations linking specific magical acts to practical ac-tivity. In chapter6I pull together the diverse threads of ethno-graphic fact to argue that the Aguaruna see no fundamental disjunc-tion between magic and technology. Their magic is a process inwhich the symbolic and practical orders inform one another. Agu-arona magic and technology share a common concern with-in-deed they are constituted by-orderingbehavior that has an instru-mental intent.The Aguaruna and Amazonian EthnographyAlthough this work primarily addresses certain questions of anthro-pological theory, it is also intended as a contribution to the ethnog-raphy of those Amazonian peoples whom the Spanish called \"theGreat Nation of the Jivaro.\" The Aguaruna, who number around26Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Henning Siverts (1972) has writ-ten a passionate account of the destructive effects of rapid culturechange on Aguaruna communitiesin the Alto RioMarafion,andMartha Works (1984a, 1984b) documents the transition to market-oriented agriculture among the Alto Mayo Aguaruna. Mildred Lar-son (1966, 1978; Pike and Larson 1964) conducted linguistic re-search among the Aguaruna for many years. Aguaruna ethnobiologyis analyzed in meticulouslycrafted studies by Brent Berlin (1976),Brent Berlin and Elois Ann Berlin (1975, 1977), and James S. Boster(1980, 1983), which were inspired by the pioneering work of J. M.Guallart (1962, 1964, 1968a, 1968b, 1975). Several volumes of Agu-aruna myths were collected byT.Akuts Nugkai et al. (1977, 1979)and A. Chumap Lucia and ManuelCarcia-Rendueles(1979). Thepresent study of Aguaruna magic is in many respects complemen-tary to the existing literature.

I also try to bring the prevailing image of [ivaroanfierceness into better perspective by describing an area of JivaroanIifecharacterized as much by the creation of harmony as by theexpression of hostility.Although Jivaroan languages have no close relatives amongother Amazonian tongues, Jivaroan culture shares much in com-mon with upland groups of western South America. The Aguaruna,like many of their neighbors, live in semipermanentvillages usu-ally comprising fewer than 150 people. Their political system isacephalous and egalitarian in nature. Aguaruna subsistence pat-terns are not dramatically different from those of such well-knowngroups as the Canelos Quichua (Whitten 1976), the Amahuaca (Car-neiro 1970), the Sharanahua(Siskind 1973), or the Cashinahua(Kensinger 1975).

In contrast to many of the societies of Brazil and east-ern Peru, however, the Aguaruna lack a tradition of large-scale, cen-trally organized rituals. Such rituals as existed in the past were pri-marily associated with the vision quest and the preparation oftrophy heads obtained during intertribal warfare. Since the aban-donment of large-scale hostilities, ritual life has been confined toshamanistic healing sessions, small domestic healing rituals per-formed by nonspecialists, and the magical rites described here.Studying Aguaruna MagicIn December 1976, I arrived in Huascayacu, an Aguaruna villagelocated on a small tributary of the Alto Rio Mayo. My choice ofHuascayacu was purely serendipitous.Two weeks earlier, whiletraveling in the sierra near the town of Chachapoyas, I had met afarmer giving a party to celebrate the sale of his land in the high-lands and the removal of his family to a jungle plot in the AltoMayo. Under the influence of the copious amounts of cane liquorthat he and his relatives were drinking, he told me that his newfarm was near two villages ofchunchos(a pejorative term meaningjungle Indians), probably Aguaruna, and he offered to take me tothem. Under the influence of equally copious amounts of the samecane liquor, I accepted his invitation instantly. My original field-work proposal had been to conduct a study of exchanges of medicalinformation across ethnic boundaries. Because my planned fieldsite had, for various reasons, proved unsuitable,I was activelysearching for an alternate location where I could begin work. TheAlto Mayo seemed to be just such a place.My new friend, who undoubtedly soon forgot the entire epi-sode, was startled to find me at his door in the Alto Mayo a fort-night later. He kindly located someone who could guide me toHuascayacu, a village located about three hours on foot from themestizo settlementof Atumplaya. My guide andIcame upon aparty of Aguarunas clearing the trail, and they invited us to drinkmanioc beer. With the assistance of Teodoro Timias, the village'sbilingual teacher, I explained that I wanted to live in the commu-nity \"to. learn about Aguaruna language and culture.\" This requestwas baffling to my hosts but not completely without precedent:they had heard about the activities of American missionary-lin-guists sent by the Summer Institute of Linguistics to other Agu-arona villages, and they assumed that my work would be similar.Isuspect that it was a combination of traditional hospitality andsimple curiosity that convinced them to grant me permission toIntroduction29 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

This was their opportunity to study akurinku(gringo) at closerange, and they were not about to let it slip away. Months later Irealized that luck also played a part in my cordial reception. Huas-cayacu was far enough away from the areas of intensive colonizationby non-Indians that the villagers had thus far been spared the tenseconfrontationswith outsiders that were then afflicting other vil-lages in the Alto Mayo. Consequently, they were much less suspi-cious of me than were their kinsmen elsewhere.The community loaned me a small, unoccupied house in thecenter of the village, and I arranged to take meals with several fam-ilies in the community. During my first months in Huascayacu, Ioccupied myself after the manner of most ethnographers new totheir field site: following the events of daily life, measuring gardens,collecting genealogies, and learning to conjugate verbs under thesardonic tutelage of naked seven year olds. Most villagers had onlya limited command of Spanish, soIhad little choice but to learnAguaruna. After about eight months,Iwas able to ask coherentquestions and, with steadily greater frequency, understand the an-swers. About this timeIalso had to abandon my original researchdesign, as it was clear that Aguaruna-colonist exchanges of medicalknowledge were still limited and mostly confined to the use ofcommercially made pharmaceuticalsby the Aguaruna.\"To broaden my perspective on the current situation of the AltoMayo Aguaruna,Imoved to the community of Alto Naraniillo inNovember 1977. There I became actively interested in the questionof magic while pursuing information on the use of hallucinogenicplants. I was intrigued by the fact that certain visions were said tobe more than just a way of seeing things; the Aguaruna thought ofthem as a means ofdoingthings, of affecting the world throughspecific experiences. While reviewing months-old tapes of songswith knowledgeable informants,Idiscovered that some songs wereattributed a similar power to affect the world. Knowledge is powerin ethnographicinquiry: asIlearned more about magical proce-dures, songs, and charms,Iwas able to ask better questions andeventually penetrate some, though undoubtedly not all, of the se-crecy that surrounds this aspect of traditional lore. In this enter-prise I was greatly assisted by Margaret Van Bolt, who came to theAlto Mayo in June 1977. Her conversations with Aguaruna womenprovided information about garden magic that would have been im-possible to gather hadIbeen working alone, because of the socialconstraints on private conversations between men and women.AlthoughItried on various occasions to use interview protocolsand formal elicitation methods, they inspired in the Aguaruna the30Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

People responded much more enthusiasti-cally to questions asked in the course of informal visits in the earlymorning or late afternoon, times of day devoted to socializing.Iobtained certain kinds of secret information in private conversa-tions with knowledgeable people. The Aguaruna usually performmagical rites in private, which made it difficult and in some casesimpossible for me to make firsthand observations of the proceduresdescribed in the following pages. To confirm the accuracy of ac-counts thatIcould not verify myself,Icross-checked statementswith as many people as possible. While much of my informationwas gathered in Huascayacu and Alto Naranjillo,Imanaged to visiteight of the nine Aguaruna communities of the Alto Mayo and in-terview people from each in order to arrive at the broadest possiblespectrum of opinion.One of the most difficult problems of this research was to ob-tain accurate glosses of magical songs, the language of which isexotic even to the Aguaruna. Most adults could explain the generalmeaning of a given song, but few were able to interpret every tropeon a word-by-word basis. The translation method thatIfinally em-ployed involved several steps: recording the song, making a tran-scription and preliminary translation with the aid of a bilingual as-sistant, returning to the original performer to inquire about specificphrases or figures of speech, and then seeking the opinions of othersabout the meaning of difficult passages. This procedure often gen-erated additional comments that were incorporated into the analy-sis as itprogressed.s(More detailed information about translationprocedures and examples of the original Aguaruna song texts canbe found in AppendixII.)During the months thatIspent in the Alto Mayo, the Aguarunatreated me in a manner that was remarkably generous, patient,andgood-humored. That is not to say that our relations were entirelyfree of tension. Given the serious problems they face as a result ofthe incursion of non-Indians into the region, it would be a miracleif they had not felt at least some suspicion about my presence. YetIalways felt that they were willing to share their traditional lorewith me so thatI,however imperfectly, could explain it to others.The emphasis thatIplace on Aguaruna song and narrative in partreflects my admiration for their consummate skill as musicians andorators.WhenIleft the Alto Mayo in October1978,after twenty-onemonths in the field,Iwas confident thatIhad established the broadoutlines of the magical procedures associated with horticulture,hunting, and domestic relations.

Be-cause magic is practiced in private, it is not amenable to the styleof analysis that stresses the social impact of rites (e.g., Victor Turn-er's [1967:260-72] interpretationof the NdembuMukandaritual).Approaches that focus on words and acts as expressive or perform-ative phenomena seem to do violence to the beliefs of the practi-tioners, who are clearly convinced of the instrumentalefficacy oftheir rites. In developing my own interpretation, then, I have triedto follow a course that takes into account both the symbolic aspectsof magic and the instrumentalintent that is its raison d'etre,In the summers of 1981 and 1984, I was able to return briefly tothe Alto Mayo to catch up on recent events and to ask for clarifica-tion of points related to magical procedures. The changes that hadtaken place since 1978 were astonishing. The Marginal Highway ofthe Jungle(Carretera Marginal de la Selva)connecting the AltoMayo to major cities on the Peruvian coast, which opened to trafficin late 1977, was now a bustling thoroughfare that transported col-onists and businessmento the Mayo and produce to the Pacificcoast. Although my Aguaruna friends humored me by answeringquestions about magic and other traditional practices, it was appar-ent that their interests had turned to more exotic matters: bankloans, mechanized agriculture, or the advantages and disadvantagesof purchasing a bulldozer for the community. It became clear to methat in my zeal to make sense of Aguaruna magic, I had inadver-tantly contributedto the stereotype of Jivaroans as a \"timelesspeople.\" The assumption that culture consists of patterns that en-dure over time is at the heart of anthropology, of course. But asJohannes Fabian (1983) has pointed out, this assumption threatensto deny to the culture under study its ability to adapt and progress.Despite their tenacious adherence to certain traditional values, theAguaruna emphatically refuse to become anachronisms. In an after-word to this book,Idescribe some of the changes taking place inthe Alto Mayo and the Aguaruna response to them.My fieldwork from 1976 to 1978, and especially my brieffollow-up visits, made me acutely aware of the difficulties raised byintraculturalvariation in belief and practice. Jivaroan societies arehighly atomistic, lacking the sort of centralized political or reli-gious institutionsthat can impose uniformity of belief. The peopleof the Alto Mayo voiced markedly different opinions about the na-ture of powerful beings (Le., \"spirits\"), the proper ways to use mag-ical charms, and the reasons for the efficacy of magical acts. Thisvariability is promoted by the fact that a great deal of magicalknowledge is founded on individual experiences-dreams,visions,32Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

The Alto Mayo moves slug-gishly, doubling back on itself constantly in the manner of oldAmazonian watercourses. Below the town of Moyobamba, this list-less meander becomes the Bajo Mayo, a torrent that drops througha series of formidable rapids until it empties into the Huallaga nearTarapoto. The available maps of the region place the entire riverwithin the Department of San Martin in north-central Peru.It is only the first of these two incarnations, the Alto Mayo, itsphysical features and its native people, that shall concern us here.The limits of the Alto Mayo valley are defined on the east by anarrow chain of mountains, to my knowledge nameless, that formthe final barrier to the Amazon Basin. To the west lie the Andeanfoothills, and beyond them the eastern cordillera. Despite its alti-tude (800-1,500 meters above sea level) and its relatively modestrainfall (1,500mm per year), the native vegetation of the valley istropical rain forest.

Recent ethnohistorical re-search conducted by Grohs (1974:84) has produced fragmentary evi-dence suggesting that some Cahuapanas and Chonzo Indian popu-lations may have inhabited the forests immediately east of the AltoMayo.Permanent Aguaruna settlements in the Alto Mayo were estab-lished in the 1940s, although individual families may have beenusing the Mayo as a hunting and refuge territory since the earlytwentieth century.1The first families to settle in the area camefrom the Potro, Cahuapanas, and Apaga rivers, tributaries of theAlto RioMarafion.Those who were among the earliest to arriverecall that the area was uninhabited and, as a consequence, rich infish and game. The abundance of fish and game is one of the mostfrequently cited motives for the migration to the Alto Mayo, al-though a desire to escape intratribalvendettas in the Potro-Cahuapanas area is also mentioned.

Littleby little, they moved here from Putjuk, settling upriver.One day they found a trail made by Christians. They were afraid,but my grandfather Kujak followed the trail until he arrived at a placewhere the Christians had tied a machete to a tree with a vine. He tookdown the machete, examined it, then left it where he had found it.When the Christians returned, they noticed that the machete hadbeen moved. They followed my grandfather's tracks until they cameupon my relatives.

Little by little they came to know the Christians.These first contacts were established in the early 1950s, andthey intensified as the mestizos sought to take advantage of theforest products and cheap labor provided by the Aguaruna. Somehouseholds relocated so that they could work forpatroneson a dailybasis. Much of the Aguaruna-mestizo trade was controlled by fouror five men from Rioja and Moyobamba. Some of thesepatronesengaged in the abuses that are so common in trade relationsthroughout the Amazon. The Aguaruna were allowed to becomeindebted and then forced to work at far below the going wage laborrate to payoff their debts. Severalpatronesestablished unions withAguaruna women, fathered children, and then abandoned them.Still, the Aguaruna were spared the overt violence inflicted bypa-troneselsewhere in the Peruvian Amazon, and some older peoplerecall this period as a time of relative affluence when they couldobtain boxes of beads or ammunition in exchange for only a fewanimal pelts.Events broke the hold of thepatronsystem in the early 1970s.A series of laws favorable to native peoples was issued by the left-leaning military government of Peru following the coup of 1968.These laws outlined procedures by which Indians could have theirvillages designated as \"native communities\"(comunidades nativas)and obtain inalienable land titles to be held in common by com-munity members. In 1970 the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL)sent two bilingual Aguaruna teachers to survey the Alto Mayo vil-lages in preparation for the establishment of primary schools. Thetwo teachers, Adolfo Iuep and IsraelKatip,convinced communityleaders that they no longer had to brook the abuses of thepatrones.Meanwhile, thepatronesdenounced Iuep andKatipbefore the localauthorities, arguing that the SIL had sent in \"outside agitators\" tostir up the Indians. Both teachers were detained, and Israel Katipspent two months in the Iquitos jail until the trumped-up chargesagainst him were dismissed in court. The happy conclusion of thiscase marked the end ofpatroninfluence in the Alto Mayo.Most of the communities petitioned for, and were granted, landtitles in the mid-1970s. (One community, San Rafael, was notawarded its title until 1983.)

Average village size inthe Alto Mayo was about120people in1978.The formation ofnucleated villages reflects several factors: the need for houses to benear the village school so that children can attend classes regularly,an increasing emphasis on communal work projects, and pressuresfrom government officials, who feel that the \"natives\" should adopta settlement pattern more in keeping with the patterns of Hispanicculture.\"The Aguaruna themselves have mixed feelings about villagelife. They seem to like the opportunities for convenient socializingthat settlements offer. At the same time, they are sensitive to thedrawbacks of living at close quarters with neighbors. Philanderingis infinitely easier in a village than it is in a dispersed settlement,which leads to suspicion and edginess on the part of men. Fears ofwitchcraft increase as well. People in populated settlements find itmore difficult to carry out agricultural tasks as the swiddeningcycle moves gardens farther and farther away from their houses.The Aguaruna are also fastidious about what Americans primly call\"waste management,\"and some people find villages simply toodirty for their tastes. In every community I visited, there were oneor two households of people who preferred to live at some distancefrom the village so that they could enjoy greater privacy and easieraccess to gardens and game. The need to defend community landsagainst appropriation by non-Indian colonists has also contributedto a centrifugal movement of households in recent years. After con-sultation with other community residents, household heads build ahouse near the community's boundaries so that they can keep acareful watch on neighboring colonists who might be tempted toestablish themselves on Aguaruna land.Individual households are the most cohesive social unit in Agu-aruna society. Approximately60percent are independent nuclearfamilies, while the rest are a mixture of independent polygynousfamilies and extended families, the latter typically consisting of aman, his sons-in-law, and their respective wives and children.Aguaruna communities consist of households linked by ties ofconsanguinity and marriage. The Aguaruna reckon kinship bilater-ally-thatis, they see themselves as being equally related to theirmother's and father's kin. Individuals consider themselves to bemembers of loosely structured, egocentric kindreds rather then per-manent corporate groups such as clans. A person's kindred(pataa)may include people in all the villages of the Alto Mayo, but there isa tendency to reside with genealogically close or \"true\" kinsmen42Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Given the flexibil-ity of Aguaruna kinship reckoning and patterns of residence, it isdifficult to make normative statements about the composition ofAlto Mayo communities. The most stable communities seem to beorganized around groups of agnatic kin (people related throughmales), typically a middle-aged man and his brothers and sons.Nevertheless, men may also enjoy cordial and solidary relationswith their mother'sbrothers, brothers-in-law, and male cross-cousins. Women prefer to settle as close as possible to their sistersand, if possible, their fathers, brothers, and mother's brothers. Thepreferences of men and women regarding residence are not entirelyincompatible, owing to a pattern of marriage to bilateral cross-cousins that gives some communitiesan endogamous character.Various strategic factors, however, may make marriage outside thecommunity, or even outside of the region, attractive to some men.Through interregional marriages and frequent visits, relationsare maintained with distant Aguaruna communities in the depart-ments of Amazonas andLoreto.\"Residents of some Alto Mayo com-munities are also in almost daily contact with non-Indians. As of1978, though, there was little intermarriage and no cases of ethnic\"passing,\" that is, a shift of self-identity from Aguaruna to \"Chris-tian.\"Political authority in Aguaruna communities is formally vestedin a village headman, calledapuorkakaiam,who represents thecommunity in intervillage meetings and in relations with agenciesof the government. The real influence of headmen depends uponsuch factors as the number of their close kinsmen in the commu-nity, their leadership abilities, and their personal temperament.Communities usually have several adult men who take prominentroles in decisionmaking. Relocation of households is a common re-ponse to disputes, and political alignments in the Alto Mayo areconstantly undergoing revision as new conflicts develop and oldones are forgotten.Bilingual teachers, trained by the SIL but now employed by thePeruvian Ministry of Education, wield considerable influence in thecommunities. They have been instrumental in the formation of nu-cleated settlements, the introduction of cash-crop agriculture, andthe conversion of some people to evangelical Protestantism.

The manufacture of cotton cloth is nearly a for-gotten art, and there is fear among some adults that the same fateawaits pottery technology. The spacious, oval house described byMichael J. Harner(1972:41-46)is rare, having been replaced by amore modest rectangular structure that is divided internally intotwo or more rooms. A shortage of raw materials and a desire toemulate \"Christian\" material culture has prompted a few people toconstruct houses with corrugated iron roofs and separate cookingshacks after the pattern followed by local mestizos.The tradition of belligerence that usually takes center stage inethnographic accounts ofIivaroanpeoples still figures in Aguarunalife, though less in the form of overt violence than as a social atti-tude. Intertribal warfare lives on only as a dim memory in theminds of the oldest residents. Intratribal homicides are now rare,but animosities based on past killings continue to ripple beneaththe surface of village life. On the day of my departure from the AltoMayo in1978,a senior man from Alto Naranjillo requested thatIbring him a cannon from the United States so that he and his sonscould finish off their enemies on the Rio Cahuapanas without hav-ing to go to the trouble of walking there to do the killing in person.ManuelCarcia-Rendueles,an anthropologist and Jesuit priest whospent several days visiting me in1978,held the residents of AltoNaranjillo spellbound with tales of some violent political demon-strations he had witnessed in Chiclayo on his way to the Alto Mayo.His listeners eagerly described, in the most graphic terms, how theywou~dhave responded to the police assault had they been the dem-onstrators.The Aguaruna are well aware of their reputation for ferocityamong non-Indians. On several occasions between1976and1978,men decorated themselves in feathers and paint (something thatthey do only rarely now) to scare off Andean immigrants who hadstarted to make agricultural fields on Aguaruna land. The appear-ance of a dozen armed and painted Indians was the worst nightmareimaginable for these colonists, many of whom can barely concealtheir fear of all things having to do with the jungle, including itsoriginal inhabitants.Still, most Aguaruna leaders realize that they cannot win a vio-lent encounter with heavily armed police and soldiers. WhenIleftthe Alto Mayo in1978,attempts were being made to forge strongerlinks between communities so that the Aguaruna could present aunited front in negotiations with local and national authorities.44Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Ini-tially successful in fostering cooperation among the nine Alto Mayocommunities, OAAM has more recently been weakened by internalstrife.Young men with experience in the non-Indian world tend to bethe driving force behind intervillage political organization.

Many people simply tire of the interminablepublic meetings called whenever government officials arrive to con-fer with community residents. Some of these encounters have analmost surrealistic quality. On one occasion in 1977, an official ofSINAMOS (the now-defunct agency responsible for \"social mobili-zation\") arrived unexpectedly in the village of Huascayacu andcalled a meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to have the resi-dents elect a village representative to the newspaperE1 Comercioin Lima, which the military government had designated as the voiceof the peasants.

In 1977Karan'shouse was an hour's walk fromother Aguaruna houses and perhaps four hours from the nearestroad. He confided to me that he liked to live apart because in hisremote forest site he needn't worry about the neighbors' pigs get-ting into his wife's garden or sorcerers approaching him unawares.His isolation kept him close to areas of good hunting and far frommestizos who might steal his goods.

Rosalia, his wife, went from houseto house asking kinsmen for remedies. When she came to myhouse, she asked whether I had \"Christian\" medicine for snakebite.As it happened, I did. Yet the thought of actually administeringantivenin terrified me. I had never given an injection before, norcould I be sure that the antitoxin would not set off an allergic reac-tion as deadly as the poison itself. I agreed to look at Ankuash any-way. Rosalia took me to her house, then pointed out the path toAnkuash's shelter. She did not accompany me there.Ankuash was pale and nervous. Next to the shelter, Chipa pre-pared an infusion of alum(alumbre),a snakebite remedy favored byneighboring colonists. I asked to see the wound. Ankuash pointedto his left leg, just above the ankle. There was one blue point, likea tiny bruise, but no redness or swelling. The viper's fangs had notbroken the skin. Immensely relieved, both for his sake and mine, Itold him that he didn't need my medicine. He was going to recover.Despite the absence of alarming symptoms, Ankuash passedthe night in the shelter. Chipa, I was told, kept him awake untildawn so that he would not dream. The four fires she built aroundthe shelter burned brightly. At first light, Ankuash colored hisankle black with charcoal. Entering his house for the first timesince the accident, he said, \"Snake, you have not killed me. I amalive, and now I return to my own house.\"The response of Ankuash and his household to this encounterwith a deadly snake illustrates the Aguaruna strategy of drawingupon both nontraditionaland traditional lore as they confront ahealth crisis. The search for herbal or pharmaceutical remedies pre-sents a Western observer with no major difficulties of interpreta-tion, but what are we to make of the apparently \"ritualistic\" as-pects of the treatment? Why doesn't Ankuash enter his house? Forwhat purpose does he isolate himself from his family? What effectcan his dreams have on his recovery?

Curing shamans(iwishin)are generally held tohave the most comprehensive knowledge of the unseen world, butto some extent all people attempt to develop their own knowledgethroughout their lives. The Aguaruna firmly believe that each per-son must acquire an understanding of the properties of the hiddenworld if he or she is to survive and prosper.The fundamental realities of Aguaruna life were established inthe distant past under circumstances described in a body of mythscollectively known asduik muun augbatbau,\"ancestor stories.\"1At the risk of oversimplifying a complicated subject, I wish to pointout two important themes, woven throughout these mythic texts,that are germane to a discussion of human understanding: first, thecivilizing role of knowledge; and second, the disparities betweenthe inner and outer identity of things.Aguaruna mythology describes the transformation of the worldof the ancestors from one of poverty and ignorance to a state ofrelative prosperity through the acquisition of knowledge. The earli-est ancestors had no knowledge of cultivated plants, fish poisons,or hunting technology. This state of intellectual darkness was socomplete that women did not even know how to give birth to theirchildren until they received instruction from the common mouse.In terms of understandingthe hidden world, the ancestors weresimilarly deficient. One man told me with a chuckle that insteadof singing directlyto the spirits to obtain visions that protectthemfrom enemies, the ancestors sang such phrases as \"Where does mywife urinate? Where does she defecate?\" in the vain hope that thiswould intimidate their foes.With the help of culture heroes and animals in human form,people acquired the knowledge that enabled them to assume a morehuman style of life. They obtained cultivated plants and learned thesongs that encouraged their growth. They acquired the blowgun,pottery, and knowledge of medicinal plants. They discovered thatcertain plants induced visions that extended people's lives. Usingthis accumulated knowledge, the Aguaruna either eradicated theterrible monsters of antiquity or converted them to less harmfulbeings. Not all the transformations of mythical times were favor-able.

Agu-aruna myths stress the civilizing power of knowledge itself, since itis knowledge that allows human beings to triumph over poverty andevil.In his discussion of the world view of the Canelos Quichua,with whom the Jivaroan Aguaruna have many cultural affinities,Norman Whitten notes that the Quichua see personal knowledgeas resulting from a combination of encyclopedic practical informa-tion and something that he calls vision, that is, \"flashes of insightin which one realizes the relationship of dream content to previousknowledge, experiences, or sets of encoding devices\" (Whitten1978b:845). The learning process thus consists of a continuous in-tegration of practical knowledge and vision. I think that this situa-tion holds for the Aguaruna as well, although they do not make aconsistent linguistic distinction between practical knowledge andvisionary insight as the Quichua apparently do. The people in theAlto Mayo who are most commonly described as \"wise\"(yacha)are those known to possess considerable practical knowledge and tohave consolidated this knowledge through the use of hallucinogenicplants. It is not enough simply to know facts; one must learn tothink well by bringing together the body, the emotions, and theintellect in the epiphanous context of the visionary experience.Adults sometimes remark that their children control more knowl-edge (e.g., the ability to read and write) because they attend school,but that they are often \"stupid\"ianentaimchou,literally \"withoutthought\") because they no longer undergo the rigorous traininglinked to the use of hallucinogenic plants. This lack of thoughtmanifests itself in such antisocial behavior as fighting with closekinsmen, attempting suicide, maintaining an unseemly interest insexual adventures, and otherwise affronting traditional morality.Another important theme in Aguaruna mythology, as elsewherein the Amazon, is physical transformation and its implications. Hu-mans change to plants, animals, or celestial bodies. Monsters areconverted from one form to another. Even though these changesoccurred in ancient times, beings and things may retain some por-tion of their primordial identity.Just as frequently mentioned in Aguaruna myths is the abilityof animals to adopt human form or of spirits to adopt animal form.In one myth, the jaguar takes human form to marry an AguarunaSeen and Unseen49 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

In another tale, the vul-ture dons a \"shirt\" that gives him the appearance of a person so thathe can deceive the Aguarunas who have stolen the magic stonesthat lead him to carrion (Jordana Laguna 1974:117). Ancient war-riors(ajutap)appear to human beings as jaguars, foxes, possums, oreven mice. These myths thus establish a world order in which theoutward appearance of a being or an object may be at variance withits hidden, inner identity. This idea is embodied in the Aguarunabelief that all things have the potential to be something more thanthey appear to be. People with sufficient knowledge are able to pen-etrate this outer form to perceive the more important inner quality.As we shall see, the hidden qualities of objects and beings are im-portant in certain aspects of Aguaruna magic.Powerful BeingsThe Aguaruna world is populated by many powerful beings whoseinfluence is felt in all facets of human life. Several of these beingsstand out as particularly important in that they are formidablesources of spiritual knowledge and key cognitive points of referencearound which people organize their experience.I never succeeded in eliciting an Aguaruna term that means\"god\" or \"supernatural being\" in a generic sense. The Aguarunacommonly classify these entities as \"people,\" yet they are clearlydistinguished from ordinary people by the degree to which they pos-sess wonderful powers over the forces of nature. This is not to say,however, that the Aguaruna construe them as being somehow di-vorced from natural laws and processes.From the point of view of women, the most important powerfulbeing is Nugkui, who has been defined as the\" earth mother\" (Har-ner 1972:70) or the \"feminine undersoil master of garden soil andpottery clay\" (Whitten 1978b:843).Amyth explains that long agothe ancestors had no cultivated plants, nor had they pots in whichfood could be cooked. They subsisted on a miserable diet of mashedbalsa wood and a few other wild foods, which were \"cooked\" bybeing warmed in the armpits.

Thus abused, Nugkui's daughter rose to the roof ofthe house and called for her mother. A tall bamboo plant next tothe house bent down to receive her, and she hid inside its stem. Theadults of the household, returning from the garden, cut open thebamboo to look for the little girl's hiding place. Inside the stem,they found an infant who, as they soon discovered, could summononly malformed and defective cultigens. Enraged by this state ofaffairs, the woman brutally kicked the infant. The child climbedinto the woman's anus to escape further punishment, and the mythexplains that since that moment human beings have been plaguedby intestinal gas.With the disappearance of Nugkui's daughter, people were re-duced to their original poverty. Nugkui eventually took pity ontheir plight and, appearing in a woman's dream, directed them to acache of cultigens that were then propagated. Now, however, plantsrequired human toil to grow. Thus the ancestors went from a con-dition of exaggerated poverty to one of exaggerated abundance, fi-nally arriving at a state of balanced or conditional abundance pred-icated on their own labor.Nugkui continues to live in the present, inhabiting the topsoiland deep caves.

Nevertheless, it is more common for people to refer toNugkui as if she were a single person, and in subsequent discussionI will follow this usage for the sake of convenience.As a being who is instrumentalin the growth of cultivatedplants, Nugkui is frequently mentioned in the course of ritual actsdirected toward garden productivity.

It was Etsawho gave snakes the poison that they now use to kill people. Healso decreed that men will forever be suspicious of their wives, andthat housebuilding will be an arduous and time-consuming task.In due course, Etsa rose into the heavens to become the sun.His direct influence in earthly matters seems to have ended withthis transformation, and the Aguaruna do not think of the sun asan active spiritual force of any consequence. I recorded no songs orprayers directed to the sun, though magical song texts sometimesuse Etsa as a symbol of masculinity and success in male subsistencetasks and handicrafts.In the mythology of the Ecuadorian Shuar, Etsa is sometimesreplaced by a culture hero named Shakaim, the latter being a trans-formation of the former (Pellizzaro 1978b:3-S). Magical songs re-corded in the Alto Mayo make frequent allusions to Shakaim, yetthe Aguaruna did not consistentlyconnect Shakaim with Etsa.They did, however, usually describe Shakaim as a masculine beingwho is a partner of Nugkui and who complements her femininepowers.A third important being is Tsugki, whose home is at the bottomof the whirlpools and rapids of great rivers such as theMarafion,and who may occasionally appear above the water in the form of arainbow. The Aguaruna's first contact with this being is describedin a myth, which explains that an attractive woman (variously de-scribed as Tsugki or Tsugki's daughter) once lured a man to herhome in the depths of the river.

Most sources on the Shuaridentify Tsugki as the mythical first shaman and the ultimatesource of shamanistic powers, a view that is commonly though notuniversally shared by the Alto MayoAguaruna.?The healing songsof shamans frequently allude to Tsugki or one of its animal mani-festations. As we shall see later, Tsugki is also attributed specialpowers in amorous matters. Whitten (1978b:846-47) characterizesthe power of Tsugki as unstructured and elemental, hence its asso-ciation with such dangerous domains as witchcraft and sexuality.Through appropriate cultural channels, however, this diffuse powercan be directed to legitimate ends.A class of powerful beings who frequently intervene in humanaffairs are ancient warriors oraititap,a word derived fromaitit,meaning \"old, ancient.\"Aititapappear most frequently in the vi-sions of people who have endured the rigors of fasting and sexualabstinence while making repeated use of psychotropic plants, espe-cially ayahuasca(Banisteriopsissp.) and several species of the sola-naceous genusBrugmansia,a close relative of Iimson weed.

The available evi-dence suggests that if the concept existed at all it was limited tothat of a deistic creativeforce.\"Missionary teaching has advancedthe idea of a more immediate and intrusive God. Aguaruna convertsto Christianity now direct American-style prayers to Apajui, andthey often use such phrases as \"We'll see each other again ifApaiuiwills it.\"Although Aguaruna Christians reject some aspects of tradi-tional religion, I spoke with none who doubted the existence ofNugkui, Tsugki, Etsa, or theaititap.Apajui rules over other super-natural beings, but his power is necessarily more diffuse .and there-fore less useful to human beings in their everyday tasks. Apajuiresides in the highest heavens, where he receives the souls of thedead and serves judgment on them according to their sins.Powerful beings provide a framework upon which the Aguarunaorganize cosmographic knowledge. The most important part of theAguaruna world is the surface of the earth, where human beingslive. The spaces below the surface-thesoil domain of Nugkui, theunderwater domain of Tsugki, the interior of mountains inhabitedby demons-aredark, mysterious, and often dangerous to humans.The heavens, both the lower sky dominated by ancient warriorsouls and the upper sky where Apajui and the souls of the dead liveeternally, represent the site of future life, the existence after death.As the interface between the dark powers of the spaces below andthe transcendent freedom of the spaces above, the surface of theearth has the most complex reality of all. Here the forces fromabove and below converge to aid or confound human activities.SoulsAt the heart of Aguaruna world view are beliefs about the natureand properties of souls.

Both of these souls have specific man-ifestations that are visible while a person lives. The eye soul is thereflection of a person that one sees when looking into someoneelse's eyes. The Aguaruna remark that when a person is healthy hispupils and irises shine brightly, but that with ill-health they losetheir brilliance. At death the pupils and irises lose all lustre, a signthat the eye soul has left the body. The visible aspect of the shadowor demonic soul is the shadow that one casts on the ground.'

A small but growing minority of Aguaruna state thathumans have only one soul, which either goes to heaven or remainson earth to be punished for its sins.

Most people express theopinion that souls animate the body. Less universally, it is believedthat souls confer sensibility. As one man said, \"The reason that wefeel a thorn when we step on it is because we have a soul.\" Peoplesometimes remark that a person who is about to die cannot tastehis food. This is because his soul is preparing to leave, or has al-ready left, his body. People do generally agree that the condition ofthe soul affects the condition of the body, thus making it possibleto act on the former to obtain some desired result in the latter.Sorcerers, for instance, can wreak havoc on their victims by orga-nizing an attack on their victims' souls.In investigating Aguaruna soul concepts, I encountered a frus-trating vagueness and inconsistency in comments on the preciseway that souls affect bodily states. For example, there exists a cate-gory of childhood illness called \"fright\"(ishamkamu)that someAguaruna explain in terms of soul-loss.' They say that when a smallchild is attacked by a dog, falls off a bed, or suffers some otherfrightening experience, his or her soul may be thrown out of thebody, creating a pathological condition that manifests itself in fever,loss of appetite, convulsions, and eventually death. Everyone ac-cepts the validity of the illness category \"fright,\" but some peopledeny that the condition has anything to do with souls. Instead, theyargue that a frightening experience makes the heart beat irregularly;this rapid and irregular heartbeat is responsible for the observedsymptoms. Similar intracultural variation exists with respect to be-liefs about which of the two human souls (i.e., the eye soul or theshadow soul) has the greater influence on the state of the body\"Animals as well as people possess souls, although there are var-ious opinions about the souls' form and function. One commonview is that animal souls have the same form as the animals them-selves. Thus when animals die, their souls ascend into the sky tobe hunted in the afterlife by the souls of dead human beings. Thesouls of animals sometimes attack newborn children, and in de-scribing these attacks people note that the animal soul has thesame qualities as the animal's body. Bird souls peck the infant'sbody with their beaks, boa souls squeeze the infant's soul in theirpowerful coils, and so on.

All of these plants harbor \"people\" or souls.A limited number of inanimate objects also possess souls. Fore-most among these is stone in its various forms. Large boulders orescarpments in the mountains have \"souls,\" \"mothers,\" or \"de-mons\" (the expressions are used interchangeably) that sometimesappear to people as they travel in remote parts of the forest. Severalkinds of pebbles are used in ritual procedures connected with hor-ticultural,hunting,warfare, fishing, and courtship,and somepeople sustain that these pebbles have souls. The degree to whichthe natural elements are seen as animate was never clearly estab-lished during my fieldwork. The sun, moon, rain, and thunder wereall people in mythical times, but today there is little concern withthem as sentient beings. The Aguaruna do occasionally deliver aspecialchantlikespeech to the rain so that it will not overtakethem until they can find shelter, which may suggest that rain isstill seen as animate.Iwas told about one abstract state that has asoul: the \"soul of hunger\"inuian wakani).The soul of hunger isfound in food that is cooking or waiting to be served.

The person who sees this will beperpetually hungry, unable to be satisfied by food no matter howmuch he eats.To summarize this discussion of soul beliefs, the Aguarunahold that living things and some inanimate objects have an invis-ible, transcendent aspect that corresponds more or less to the West-ern idea of a soul.

The intoxicating power of psychoactive plants is innate, yetpeople can increase this power by using the plants frequently andby respectingvarious taboos associated with their cultivation(Brown 1978:131).TABLE1Psychoactive Plants Used bythe Aguamna of the Alto Rio MayoCommon nameAguaruna nameScientific namePrincipal usesTobaccotsagNicotianaInducing trancetabacumfor shamanistichealing, magicalsongs, visionquestAyahuascadatem, natemBanisteriopsisVision quest,caapishamanistichealingAyahuascayaiiBanisteriopsisShamanisticcabreranahealingToebaikuaBrugmansiasp.Vision questToebikutBrugmansiasp.Vision questToetsuakBrugmansiaBonesetting,suaveolensinducinghealing trances58Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Most of the men of the Alto Mayo began taking to-bacco water, ayahuasca, or varieties of the nightshadeBrugmansiain their childhood so that they could experience the visions thoughtnecessary for survival in a dangerous world. The use of hallucino-gens has declined dramatically in the past decade or so, owing tothe influence of missionary-trained bilingual teachers and the ces-sation of organized intertribal warfare. Nevertheless, men continueto recognize the important role that the visions obtained in theiryouth had in promoting their moral education and physical well-being, and in helping them make the transition to the responsibili-ties of adult life.Ignoring for a moment the special case of shamans, the Agu-aruna acknowledge two major classes of visions: those in which anaiiitapappears and speaks to the dreamer, and visions in which thedreamer sees an image of his or her future. The first kind of vision(usually referred to aswaimakbau)confers knowledge of one's in-vincibility in warfare. The second kind of vision (calledniimagbau)is not associated with warfare but rather with prosperity and goodhealth. In aniimagbauvision, a man or woman sees the many chil-drenhe or she will have, the fine domestic animals he or she willtend, abundant gardens, the robust good health of close relatives,and so on. The Aguaruna insist that the fact of having had this kindof vision ensures that the desirable state of affairs revealed in thevision will eventually come to pass. I was told by several peoplethat at various points in their lives-whenthey perceived thatthings were not going as well as they might, perhaps because of astring of unsuccessfulhuntingexpeditions or frequent illnessamong the members of their household-theytried to turn theirluck by seekingniimagbauvisions.

The future exists as a set of possibilities that aregiven shape by the effort to bring them into consciousness withinthe visionary experience. The notion that dreams have a creative ordirective power is something that surfaces in various aspects ofAguaruna behavior, especially in the practices that come under thegeneral rubric of magic.ShamanismSome Aguaruna have a knowledge of the hidden world that sur-passes that of ordinary people. Those who are socially recognized ashaving special knowledge are known astun chi,a term thatIshallgloss as shaman. There are two principal types oftunchi:curingshamans(iwishin, taiimat tunchi)and bewitching shamans or sor-cerers(wawek tuncbii.'The two categories are not totally discrete,however, since curing shamans are also potential sorcerers, andtheir enemies may refer to them in precisely those terms. The maindifference between curing shamans and sorcerers is that the formerare publicly recognized and openly engage in shamanistic activities,while the latter pursue their activities in secret.Shamanistic power for curing or the pursuit of sorcery is basedon possession of spirit darts calledtsentsak,which are held in theshaman's upper torso. Sorcerers propel these darts into the bodiesof their victims, thereby causing illness. Curing shamans use thepower of their own darts to find and remove the darts of sorcerersbefore the victims have been irreversibly afflicted.Aspiring shamans commonly acquire spirit darts from someonewho already has shamanistic powers. They may be given as a gift orin exchange for money or trade goods. Both the dart-giver and thedart-receiver must be intoxicated by some psychoactive plant (usu-ally tobacco or ayahuasca) at the time the transfer is made. Thedart-giver produces a salivalike substance calledkaag,which is themedium for his spirit darts, and a portion of this is swallowed bythe dart-receiver. Subsequently, the new shaman must spend severalweeks taking hallucinogens and observing severe restrictions on hisdiet and sexual activities. Fasting and abstinence increase thepower of his spirit darts and his control over them; indeed, thepower of a shaman is directly proportional to the length of time60Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Two other plants, a variety ofpiiipig(Cyperussp.) and a second plant calledchukcha(unidentified), are also men-tioned as potential sources of darts.Aneven more elaborate methodof obtaining shamanistic power from a certain tree was described tome as follows:The tree calledmente[possiblyChorisiasp.] can be used to become asorcerer. A person must find amentetree and clear away the plantsaround its base. Then he must drink a lot of tobacco water until he isvery intoxicated. He lies down at the base of the tree. Suddenly, a greatstorm comes, the wind howling \"weh, weh, weh.\" The tree shakes.Some branches of the tree will fall close by, but the person must notbe afraid.Then from the heights of the tree comes awiakuch[the soul of thetree, a well-dressed person with European features]. His shoes sound\"tak, tak, tak.\" He opens the door and comes out. He says, \"Son, whatare you doing here?\" The person replies, \"I come here so that I can bea sorcerer.\" .\"All right,\" says the soul of the tree, \"come inside.\"Inside the tree is a city. The person sits down in a chair, next to atable. The soul of the tree gives him tobacco, then asks, \"What do youwant?\"\"Iwant spirit darts,\" the person answers. Telling him to openhis mouth, the soul of the tree gives him darts one by one. He putssome in his ears, too. \"All right, now you are ready,\" says the soul ofthementetree. This is how one obtains spirit darts frommente.People sometimescome to possess spirit darts involuntarily.This can occur when a sorcerer places darts in the mouth of a sleep-ing person. Later the recipient of the darts inadvertently causes ill-nesses in others.The conditioncan be diagnosedby a curing sha-man and remedied by removing the darts from the body of theunwitting witch.The healing sessions of curing shamans are the only public rit-uals currently practiced in the Alto Mayo, aside from the desultoryevangelical worship services occasionally organized in a few com-munities.Typically, a healing session is held when a shaman isasked to diagnose the illness of a kinsman who has failed to respondto herbal remedies or commercial medicines.Thefamily of the pa-Seen and Unseen61 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

In the Alto Mayo, however, I saw little evidence that curingshamans are any wealthier than their peers. This situation couldchange if the flow of mestizo patients to Aguaruna shamans thatbegan during the late 1970s continues to increase. Curers had noqualms about asking non-Indians for fees that were three or fourtimes greater than those they would consider asking of an Aguarunakinsman.A social role represented in some Alto Mayo communities, butnot marked by a specific term, is that of diviner. I first becameaware of the activities of diviners during an extended visit to thecommunity of Shimpiyacu, where I stayed in the same householdas a woman who was in the final weeks of pregnancy. One day shebegan to suffer from severe abdominal cramps, which were treatedby a variety of herbal medicines and ritual procedures. Later thatday at a village gathering, the oldest resident of the community wasasked whether the woman would recover or die. The man paused amoment, then sighed loudly with a strange percussive sound. Thosepresent told me that this sigh (calledmaiyaiiamu,literally \"yawn\")meant that the woman would recover. The absence of the sighwould have been a sign of an unfavorable outcome. With furtherinquiry, I learned that people who are able to predict the outcomeof an illness throughmaiyaiiatnucan determine foods that a sickperson should avoid. Their divinatory powers can also be extendedto such questions as whether visitors will be arriving, the probabil-ity of enemy attack, and so on.Opinions about how divinatory powers work vary widely. SomeAguaruna say that people with this ability possesspasuk,the spiritsmentioned earlier in connection with shamanistic healing. Becausepasukare themselves formidable shamans, they can see things at agreat distance or predict the outcome of an illness episode. In a waythat was not clearly explained by my informants, apasukinformsthe diviner of the correct answers to the questions that have beenposed. Unlike the shaman, who has a more active control over hispasuk,the diviner is seen as a passive vehicle for thepasuk'sintel-ligence.Some people vigorously deny the connection betweenpasukand divinatory powers. One man argued that the elderly have thepower to know things simply because \"they are the last of theirbrothers and sisters to remain alive,\" the implication being that byvirtue of their longevity they reveal themselves as well suppliedwith spiritual knowledge.Awoman who is herself a diviner ex-plained that she was granted this power in a vision during her ado-lescence.

Just as the soul of the plant hadsaid, she found that after her recovery she had divinatory powers.She denied emphatically that her gift had anything to do withpa-suk.The sighs, she insisted, simply came by themselves.These objections notwithstanding,the evidence suggests thatthere is a connectionbetweenpasukspirits and divination. Thecharacteristic diviner's sigh is identical to the sound made by sha-mans at the beginning of curing sessions, a sound that was identi-fied to me as a sign that thepasukare entering the shaman's chest.Because thepasukare so closely associated with shamanism, andby extension sorcery, the link between divinatory powers andpasukis denied to avoid the suspicion that people with this ability aresecret sorcerers.The roles of shaman and diviner illustrate cases in which accu-mulated visionary experience is turned to practical ends. Throughtheir efforts to perceive that which resists perception, people ulti-mately make new connections among diverse experiences, thus be-coming active shapers of reality.Ankuash's Snakebite ReconsideredSeveral of the most prominentthemes discussed in this chapterreveal themselves in Ankuash's response to his skirmish with thesnake. His troubles originate in mythologicaltimes, when Etsaequipped snakes with dart poison, which they then began to use tohunt humans with deadly efficiency. To end their reign of terror,Etsa set a trap for them. He created an attractive woman from theetsetree and placed her in a location where the snakes were sure topass on their huntingtrips. As each snake came upon thiswoman-who,as Aguaruna storytellerslove to emphasize, waslying spreadeagle on the ground, smelling of sweet perfume-hesuccumbed to her charms and engaged in sexual intercourse. Thefew snakes that resisted theetsewoman's attractions found thestrengthof their poison undiminished.The rest were renderedharmless (Chumap Lucia and Carcia-Rendueles1979:104-15).Just as the snakes lost their killing force through sexual con-tact, people bitten by poisonous snakes will expire rapidly if theydo not scrupulously avoid contaminationby sexual fluids, smells,and sights, or even by contact with the ordinary domestic refuseSeen and Unseen65 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

If two men are walking in thebush and one is bitten by a snake, the victim should resist lookingat or touching his companion. This contact could be disastrous ifthe other man has recently engaged in sexual relations. The victimcannot enter his house because, as I was told, \"in the house there'sthe smell of manioc beer and food, and of people who have had sex.\"To prevail in what is perceived as a battle with the snake's destruc-tive force, one shuns all polluting, and hence debilitating, associa-tions.This is why Ankuash remains isolated in his lonely shelter. Thepresumption is that Chip a, a widow, is free of sexual contaminationand can safely attend him after a change of clothes and a precau-tionary bath. If she had been unavailable, another elderly person orperhaps an adolescent would have been called. (In retrospect, I thinkthat I was allowed to examine him because I was at the time livingas a bachelor in the village.)Snakes embody uncanny forms of attraction. A snakebite vic-tim is likely to be visited by other snakes, the Aguaruna say, and somust be protected from further assault by surrounding his shelterwith campfires that burn though the night. Worse still, a snake mayappear in the victim's dreams to bite him yet again. A snake's dreamattack is likely to be fatal. This is why Chipa keeps Ankuash awakethrough the night even though he doesn't appear to be ill.When Ankuash enters his house and makes his final declara-tion, \"Snake, you have not killed me,\" it seals the snake's own fate.It has lost the encounter with its human opponent and will soondie.

Theyare thoroughly familiar with the habits of the fauna of their region.Using a blowgun and poisoned darts, they kill small and medium-sized game with quiet efficiency. Their marksmanshipwith fire-arms is excellent. Nevertheless, good marksmanshipand a knowl-edge of animal behavior are not enough to ensure hunting success.People note that a good hunter sometimes goes for days withoutseeing an animal, while, as in the incident described above, anotherman may stumble across game when he is not even looking for it.67 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

These procedures correspond to ourcategory of \"magic\" because they are not informed by theories ofcause and effect that are acceptable in Western terms.After a brief survey of the technical milieu of hunting,Ishalldescribe the various facets of hunting magic as it is practiced in theAlto Rio Mayo. These procedures consist of patterned acts and ut-terances, andIset myself the task of identifying the cognitive as-sociations that link them to the immediate goal of hunting success.This includes the isolation of certain key symbols used as building-blocks in the constructionof an order in which men and animalsare drawn inexorably together.Aguaruna Hunting TechnologyStudies of neotropical subsistence systems emphasize the impor-tance of animal protein in the diet of the native populations of theAmazonBasin. The shiftingvegeculturepracticedthroughoutmuch of Amazonia is remarkably productive insofar as carbohy-drates are concerned, but it contributes only a modest amount ofprotein to the diet. This deficiency is made up by the exploitationof faunal resources-fish,land mammals,and birds. Because thedensity of game animals and, in some regions, fish is fairly low inthe neotropics, scholars (e.g., Meggers1973,Gross1975,Ross1978)have argued that protein resources, not carbohydrate resources, arethe limiting variables in the distributionof human populations inthe Amazon.'Aguaruna dietary patterns conform closely to this model: pro-tein comes largely from faunal resources, carbohydrates from horti-cultural products. A study conducted by Brent and Elois Ann Berlin(1977:Table3)demonstrates that while two crops, manioc and plan-tains, provide nearly 80 percent of the per capita intake of carbohy-drates, 70 percent of the protein in the Aguaruna diet comes fromfish, birds, and mammals. The relative importance of hunting andfishing varies widely among Aguaruna populations, but in the com-munities of the Alto Mayo hunting provides more protein than fish-ing because the accessible rivers are mostly too shallow to supportlarge fish populations.As Eric Ross(1976)has noted in his study of Achuar subsis-tence strategies, Jivaroan populations usually emphasize the pursuitof small and medium-sized game rather than larger animals such asdeer, tapir, and capybara. Jivaroans themselves explain this patternin terms of food taboos that prohibit consumption of these species.68Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

The shotgun (usually a 16-gauge, single-shot model of U.S.or Canadian manufacture) is the most important hunting weapon.Blowguns, used with either poisoned or unpoisoned darts, are stillused to bring down birds and, to a lesser extent, monkeys. With theexception of a simple trap made of a piece of iron pipe loaded withpowder and shot and connected to a tripwire,Inever saw anysnares, deadfalls, or other traps in use.Aguaruna men commonly hunt alone or in the company of oneof their wives. They prefer to hunt in the early morning hours andreturn home in the early afternoon. Hunters sometimes use dogs tohelp them locate paca, agouti, armadillo, and peccary. Those vil-lages that are suffering local shortages of game periodically organizegroup hunting expeditions of several days' duration, during whichthree or more hunters travel to some isolated area of the forestwhere game is still plentiful. A few communitiesare now practi-cally depleted of game; families in these communitieshave beenforced to intensify their fishing activities and use their domesticanimals for home consumption rather than as a source of cash in-come.Given the unique ecological situation of each community andthe large number of variables that affect hunting anywhere, it isdifficult, if not impossible, to arrive at a meaningful measure ofhunting success versus time invested. What is certain is that hunt-ers sometimes return home with little or nothing to show for theirefforts.' The relative uncertaintyof hunting contrasts markedlywith the reliability of horticulture,which produces substantialquantities of food on a daily basis. Aguaruna hunters try to reducethe uncertainty of hunting by attracting game, by rendering the an-imals passive so that they can be more easily killed, and by avoidingpractices that can cause a serious case of \"bad luck\"(shimpan-kamu),a condition that manifests itself as the inability to findgame.

Whatever the circumstances, instructorand pupil contrive to isolate themselves in some secluded spotwhere they will not be interrupted while the songs are being taught.Instruction inanensongs is always associated with the con-sumption of tobacco by the pupil. According to Aguaruna accounts,the instructor prepares green tobacco water by chewing a wad oftobacco leaf and then squeezing the saliva and tobacco juice intothe hand of the pupil, who ingests it either orally or through thenasal passages. My informants emphasized the importance of boththe tobacco (which produces intoxication) and the transfer of saliva(a key substance in many magical spells) in teachinganento an-other person.\" Tobacco smoke is sometimes used instead of tobaccojuice, especially when transferring hunting songs. In the latter case,the instructor blows the smoke through a bamboo tube into themouth and lungs of his pupil (cf. Harner 1972:60).When the intended recipient of the song is slightly intoxicatedby the tobacco, the tutor sings theanenrepeatedly until the pupilhas memorized the words and melody. The Aguaruna insist thatwithout the ingestion of tobacco the song would have no power, norwould the song's new owner be able to commit it to memory. Longand difficultanenmay require several transfers of tobacco untilthey are learned correctly.To keep a newly acquired song, one must maintain a restricteddiet and sexual abstinence for a period ranging from three or fourdays to a week. This fast prevents the song from1/escaping\" fromits new and unfamiliar owner and serves to increase the efficacy ofthe song when it is later used for practical ends.

People think of them as having a life and permanence thatcontrasts with the transitory nature of social songs.The circumstances in which these songs are performed vary ac-cording to their intended purpose. Ideally, a person who wishes touseanenconsumes a small amount of tobacco water, taken throughthe nasal passages, before singing. This is because the intended re-cipient of the song, be it plant, animal or person, will \"hear\" thewords better if the singer is intoxicated. \"Hearing\" in this contextmeans that the recipient will conform more dramatically to what-ever form of behavior the singer desires. Songs performed withoutbenefit of tobacco can still be effective, but their power is less thanthose performed in an intoxicated state. Magical songs can be sungeither aloud or silently-thatis, in one's thoughts alone.

A myth explains that Tsewa, the headman of the spider mon-keys, was the original source of hunting implementsand magic. Inancient times, the ancestors lacked knowledge of proper huntingmethods and were forced to hunt by clubbing sleeping monkeys intrees. Tsewa, who is described as sharing characteristicsof both aspider monkey and a person, befriended an Aguaruna man, taughthim huntingsongs, and made him a gift of a blowgun. They ex-changed social visits, and good relations were established betweenthem. Finally, though, the man used his new-found knowledge tohunt members of Tsewa's own household. In a rage, Tsewa rammedthe blowgun into the man's anus. The man himself became a spidermonkey and the blowgun its long tail. But it was too late for Tsewato take back huntingsongs, for they had already been learned byhuman beings (Chumap Lucia and Garcia-Rendueles1979:277).One of the facts established by this myth is that hunting songsand weapons originated in the animal world and are therefore partof the natural order that has been revealed to human hunters. Themyth, and others like it, also sets forth the idea that in mythicaltimes humans enjoyed more intimate relations with animals. As Ishall presentlyshow, a desire to recreate the mythicalclosenessbetween people and game animals through the use of verbal im-agery is at the heart of some of the metaphorsfound in huntingsongs.According to the men of the Alto Mayo, the principal functionof hunting songs is to attract game to the vicinity of the hunter. Asecondary purpose is to make the animals \"friendly\" and thereforemore likely to reveal their presence by emitting some sound. As oneman said, \"When a man knows magical songs, he uses them as hehunts. Then the spider monkeys begin to call, and he will alwayskill some. The curassow calls 'pish' and is more easily found.\"Because the primary purpose of hunting songs is to attract, it ishardly surprisingthat various forms of attractionare prominentthemes in the songs.

The immediate senseof the song, according to the people I queried, is that the hunterseeks to avoid the possibility that the woman's presence mightfrighten away game. In the words of one man, theanenis saying tothe animals: \"Join with the widow Kagkui, who attracts monkeys.She is your friend. Don't fight with her or fear her.\" The woman isthus used as sexual bait to attract game.Sex and hunting are inextricably linked in Jivaroan thought, asthey are in other parts of the Amazon (Kensinger1983).Michael76Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

The Aguaruna speak of allbirds of prey as having a unique, even miraculous, ability to locategame, and it is this quality that explains the allusion to the hawkin a hunting song. (The possibility that this particular hawk may beone that preys on monkeys was not investigated in the field. If thisturns out to be the case, the intent of the allusion becomes evenmoreobvious.)Tsewa,the ultimatesourceof magicalhuntingsongs, also has special attracting powers that are sought by thehunter. People insisted that Tsewa and the hawk are mentioned \"be-cause they always find game,\" that is, because they are paragons ofhunting skill. No one interpreted the song as a direct plea for theassistance of supernatural agencies.The meaning of \"miscarriage\" in A.4 needs clarification. TheAguaruna insist that pregnant women are subject to intense foodcravings that, if left unsatisfied, can induce miscarriage. When apregnant woman feels a strong desire for specific foods, her husbanddoes his best to satisfy that desire if it is at all possible in order toprevent a miscarriage. The idea central to miscarriage, that an un-fulfilled desire can result in physical harm to the desirer, is even78Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

There is, for example, a category ofillness called \"vagina miscarriage\"(chukiusupagbauithat may af-flict a young man experiencing a strong desire for a woman whospurns his affection. This illness manifests itself by a set of symp-toms similar to those of true miscarriage (e.g., intense abdominalpains) and is treated by a similar set of techniques.The allusions to miscarriage in A.4 mean that the hunter's de-sire to find game is very strong, and that he might suffer harm if itis not satisfied immediately. This miscarriage is then transferred tohis wife (\"To the Nugkui woman / I will give a miscarriage formonkey fat\"). As I noted earlier, women are consistently identifiedwith Nugkui in magical songs, but in this case the identification isparticularlysignificant given the Aguaruna's belief that Nugkuicannot suffer a miscarriage, owing to her legendary ability to pro-duce any sort of food simply by calling for it. In fact, the name ofNugkui is invoked in chants used to treat miscarriage precisely forthis reason. Nugkui never lacks for food, so by definition she cannothave a miscarriage caused by unfulfilled food cravings. The impli-cation is that if a man transfers his strong desire for meat to a \"Nug-kui woman,\" she will use her Nugkui-given powers to help him findgame. In a subtle way, A.4 gives further evidence that the male-female conjugal unit is important to the successful search for game,an idea that is more clearly expressed in magical practices asso-ciated with hunting dogs.Hunting dogs were once the object of considerable ritual activ-ity, including an entire feast specifically intended to endow a dogwith strength and skill (Karsten1935: 170).Dogs are cared for prin-cipally by women and sleep on platforms next to the fireplace at thewomen's end of the house. When a woman accompanies her hus-band on a hunting trip, it is she who handles the dogs. Knowledgeof songs for hunting dogs seems to be distributed among both menand women, although the only examples I recorded happened to besungbymen. The following song, A.5, was performedbya hunterwho explained that it is to be sung at dawn after a man has in-structed his wife to feed the dog in preparation for the day's hunt.A.S Nugkui woman, Nugkui womanInsteadoflying sleepilyYouariseTo my wild dogputiikam[!ctyan venaticus]The chewed maniocMay you giveThe mouth of new tobaccoMay you giveThe Uses of Affinity79 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Sheis then told to give the dog \"the mouth of new tobacco\" and \"thehand of new tobacco.\" These two metaphors were subject to variousinterpretationsby Aguaruna consultants, but most felt that heretobacco stands for magical songs in general, since the transfer oftobacco juice is so closely associated with the acquisition of suchsongs. The most likely interpretation is, therefore, that the singerurges his wife to use her newest and most powerful songs to bringluck to the hunting dog. This stanza shows an elegant progressionof images: \"chewed manioc\" becomes \"the mouth of new tobacco\"(i.e., tobacco recently chewed to prepare tobacco juice essential forthe transfer of songs), then \"the hand of new tobacco\" (i.e., thehand that transfers the juice to the recipient of the song). Simulta-neously, something ordinary (chewed manioc) is changed metaphor-ically to something powerful (chewed tobacco).At no point in A.S is the hunting dog referred to by the ordinaryword \"dog\"(yawaa).Instead, a variety of pseudonyms are used, atleast two being the names of wild canines. The more prominent ofthe two is theputukatn(letyon venatieus),a species noted for itsspeed and keen sense of smell. Reportedly,putukatnare sometimescaptured, tamed, and taught to perform as hunting dogs (Guallart1962: 159).The use of the names of wild dogs instead of the ordinaryword \"dog\" summons an imagery of swiftness and cunning that thecommon word cannot convey.The last two stanzas of A.S allude to the dreams of the hunter,his wife, and the dog itself. Dreams are important omens of huntingsuccess, and are often a critical factor in determining whether aman will set off into the forest to hunt. Favorable dreams take vari-ous forms: a dream in which one embraces an attractive woman isan omen that one will find paca, a dream of handling a string ofbeads foretells that a hunter will soon be cleaning peccary tripe,and so on. People sustain that through these dreams a man \"killsthe soul\" of a game animal.

The singer, on the other hand, hashad' good dreams: \"Having dreamed armadillo, I awake / Havingdreamed agouti, I awake,\" and so on. These lines declare the hunt-er's infallibility, in effect saying, \"The bad dreams of others are ir-relevant, since my good dreams will prevail.\"To summarize the properties of the huntinganenknown to theAlto Mayo Aguaruna, it can be said that the songs consist of adensely constructed series of images built upon an esoteric lexiconand highly figurative language. People consider the songs to be bothaestheticallypleasing and practically efficacious. A key image ofthe songs is the conjugal hunting unit-s-Shakaim man and Nugkuiwoman-whichis a cultural ideal representing the fruitful collab-oration of husband and wife. This order is prominent in the songsbecause they attempt to create a second, auxiliary order that flowsfrom it: the hunter successfully providing meat for his family. Theerotic connotationsof husband-wife hunting empower the meta-phors of attraction found in the songs, as do the allusions to myth-ological times when men and animals enjoyed greater intimacy.Let me present one last song that shows a slightly different ap-proach to the constructionof a favorable hunting order. Instead offocusing attention on attraction alone, A.6 describes the entire pro-cess of finding and then successfully killing spider monkeys. Itslogic is that of \"anticipatory effect\" (Tambiah 1968:200) in that itreviews the stages of a specific task before the task is actually per-formed:A.6 The spider monkeys comeThe spider monkeys comeFrom that hill they comeThe spider monkeys comeWith their stiff children they comeWithout seeing me they comeFrom this hill they comeFrom that hill, too, they comeSons, sons [to the singer's own sons, who accompany him]Do you speak to spoil my luck?Spoiling my luck speak you thus?You speak to attract spider monkeyYou speak to attractIwill shoot the spider monkey [using a blowgun]High, high,Iwill shoot82Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Themeaning of the second stanza is more obscure but was explained tome as being a sort of rhetorical question in which the singer askshis sons whether they are using their own magical songs to some-how confound his luck. The answer, of course, is that they, too, aresilently singing to attract the monkeys. By asking the question, theverse calls attention to the combined attracting power of the severalhunters present. The third stanza describes the preparation of theblowgun darts, the unerring aim of the marksman, and the force ofthe dart as it strikes the monkey, piercing to its vital organs. Thesong, then, consists of an enumeration of desired events that areultimately translated from the mental to the physical world in ahighly ordered manner.How do the Aguaruna themselves explain the action of huntingsongs? By and large they don't; it is enough to know that the songswere handed down from ancient times and that their attractingpowers are continually revalidated through the personal experienceof individual hunters. A few men ventured the opinion that the soulof an animal hears the song, feels attracted, and draws the corporealaspect of the animal in the directionof the singer. This interpreta-tion was disputed by other people, but as we shall see in later dis-cussion, the linking of magic to soul manipulationis a common,though not universally accepted, explanation of various forms ofmagical action known to the Alto Mayo Aguaruna.Game GrabbersWe ask ourselves, \"Why does this man kill so many animals?\" It's be-cause he has a stone.

Apassing villager asked me what I was doing, and after listening in-credulously to my reply sent a child to fetch a small sharpeningstone from the house of my nearest neighbor. Later I came to learnthat much of the alluvial soil of the Peruvian Amazon has no nat-urally occurring surface stones. Because stones are needed forsharpening steel tools, many Amazonian Indians must buy themfrom mestizo traders at exorbitant prices-orprices that seem ex-orbitant to North Americans accustomed to thinking of stone as aplentiful substance. The people of the Alto Mayo do not have topurchase stones, but the residents of some communitiesmustundergo the inconvenience of walking a considerable distance tofind a good whetstone and carry it back to their village. Stone isthus an essential and, in some instances at least, a scarce commod-ity for the Aguaruna. Yet the significance of stone extends beyondthe purely technological and economic.

The Aguaruna, too, think of stone asa material that can be used to change things. The most obviousexample is the stone axe, which was used before the introductionof steel tools to convert forest to garden. The Aguaruna also recog-nize three principal categories of \"magical\" stones, that is, rocks orpebbles that can be used by knowledgeable people to effect changesin the world. A class of stones calledtuutuig(in some contextsna-mu;i)is used by shamans and possibly by some non shamans to in-flict harm on an enemy.Asecond category of stones callednantagis used by women to promote the growth of their garden plants. Athird type,yuka,is used by men in hunting and love magic (Brown1985).Yukaare stones that attract either game animals or humanbeings of the opposite sex.Agivenyukastone can be used for eitherhunting or courtship, but not for both. People findyukain the en-trails (or in some cases in the mouths) of mammals, birds, and fish.Yukathat attract game are most commonly encountered in terres-trial mammals and birds, including the white-lipped peccary, capu-chin monkey, armadillo, dove, and guano Theyukaused in lovemagic tend to be found in aquatic mammals, fish, and reptiles.

The correct procedure for developing the power of the stone isto seal it immediately in a container-asmall gourd or a tube ofbamboo are common choices-alongwith a quantity of red facepaint(;ampu).The finder then abstains from sexual intercourse andrestricts his diet by avoiding meat, salt, palm grubs, and other pre-ferred foods for a period of about seven days.

At the end of the fast, the hunter puts the vessel containingthe stone into his palm fiber bag and sets off to hunt in the earlyhours of the morning. A short distance from his house, he drawsred lines on his face with the paint that has been in the vessel hold-ing theyuka.(The design painted on the face was usually describedas consisting of a straight line on each cheekbone and a line downthe bridge of the nose. No one attributed any significance to thedesign itself.) Setting off once again, the hunter will soon find thatmammals and birds are drawn to him. The Aguaruna insist that areally strongyukabrings game in unprecedented numbers and ren-ders them submissive so that they are easily killed. After the initialtesting of ayuka,the hunter may use it on subsequent trips with-out any special procedures, as long as he takes care not to touch thestone immediately after sexual intercourse.

Thethird quality is not recognized by everyone, however. Those who dobelieve thatyukahave souls told me that when a man fails to careproperly for a stone, he may have a dream in which a person appearsand says, \"I am taking my child back because you have mistreatedit.\" The next morning, he will find that theyukahas vanished. Thissoul or \"person\" seems to be construed as a manifestation of, ratherthan a cause of, the stone's power:The stone comes from an animal. The animal is the stone's father.The animal is the person of the stone. The animal is its soul.The logic of unexpected affinity that is central to beliefs aboutyukastones also figures in the use of certain insects as game grab-bers. The one most frequently mentioned by Alto Mayo men is the\"game bird fly\"(chigki anchiiii,which is found in the feathers ofgame birds, where it apparently lives as a parasite (cf.

Again, aperiod of dietary restriction and sexual abstinence turns the insectinto a charm that attracts the bird species from which it was ob-tained.The Ethnobotany of AttractionThe people of the Alto Mayo can identify well over fifty species ofplants that are used as medicines, hallucinogens, or charms. Abouta dozen of these are regularly tended in gardens, and some are truecultigens. The Aguaruna recognize that these cultivated plants havewild ancestors but insist that the cultivated varieties are muchstronger because they have been treated in ways that bring theirstrength to maximum expression. In other words, the relationshipbetween people and plants is seen as synergistic: the two agenciesworking together have an effect greater than the sum of their indi-vidual effects (Brown1978).While certain plants thus have an in-trinsic power to attract animals, this power must first be discoveredby people and then given strength and direction through cultiva-tion.At least six folk genera of plants are sources of hunting charms.They are listed in Table 4 in order of relative importance.The herbpiiipig,a taxon that apparently includes species of twogenera of sedges, is a ubiquitous plant in Aguaruna gardens, and itis also widely cultivated among other societies of the Upper Ama-zon under the namepiripiri.Varieties ofpiiipigare used as fertilityenhancers and menses regulators by women(E.A. Berlin1977:5-6),while others are used to attract members of the opposite sex, toprovide antidotes for various illnesses, and reportedly even to in-duce visions that result in the acquisition of bewitching darts. Onlyone kind ofpiiipighas the power to attract animals. A hunter mixesthe root of thispijipigwith red-face paint and applies it when begin-ning the day's hunt.People usually obtain cuttings ofpijipigby purchase or tradeand then cultivate them in house gardens. The Aguaruna claim thatsome people tend particularlypowerful kinds ofpiiipigin secretgarden plots, butIcould not determine how common this practiceis. The motives for cultivating a plant secretly include a desire toprotect the plant from theft or contaminationand the wish to keepone's ownership of the plant from public knowledge.The herbtsumaik,likepiiipig,has multiple uses, principally inthe attractionof game, fish, and members of the opposite sex.I88Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

The procedure under-taken to produce the hunting charm uses the symbolism of carrionbirds as grist for a transformationalmill such as Levi-Strauss hasfound elsewhere in the Amazon: the vulture is allowed to rot (thatis.varriveat a state of exaggerated rawness) before being burned (anexaggerated form of cooking). The shift from superraw to super-cooked corresponds to the transformation of the vulture from a birdattracted to dead animals to a plant that attracts living animals.What can this account tell us about the power of game grab-bers? First, the Aguaruna are convinced that there are substanceswith a diffuse power to attract living things. These attracting sub-stances reveal their power by appearing in unexpected places; in-deed, their ability to be where they should not be is proof of theirpower.

The hunter's family is likely to tell a visitor who arrives underthese circumstancesthat the man has \"gone to the forest,\" whichexplains his absence without explicitly stating the nature of his ac-tivities. Finally, it is considered bad form for a person to express adesire for a specific kind of meat in the presence of a man who isabout to embark on a hunting trip. Children tend to do this morethan adults, and when they do they are reprimanded by their par-~n~3.Any of these behaviors can cause a hunter to be afflicted bysbimpankamu,the inability to find game.These avoidances make sense in Aguaruna terms because state-ments about an intention to hunt, or one's desire for specific animalspecies, unmask the true uncertaintyof hunting as a subsistenceactivity. One of the primary objects of hunting magic is to create anintimate relationship between animals and people approximatingthe closeness that existed in mythical times. In the context of thisimagery, the coming together of people and game is perfectly natu-ral, unlike the everyday world in which game may be elusive. Whenpeople inquire about the activities of a hunter or express a longingfor certain kinds of meat, they call attention' to the true nature ofhunting. The fiction of intimacy is publicly exposed, replaced in-stead by an implicit assumption of scarcity. Such idle commentscan only confound the hunter in his attempt to find game. In a moregeneral sense, too, the Aguarunaare uncomfortablewith thethought that others are discussing their success in subsistence ac-tivities. As we shall see, women make use of procedures to preventprecisely this sort of talk with respect to their horticulturalpur-suits, since they consider it potentially destructive to their gardens.The most stringentavoidances associated with hunting arethose related to the distributionand disposal of meat and bones.The Aguaruna are careful to see that all game animal bones, includ-ing those swept up when cleaning the house, are collected andwrapped in banana leaves so as to form a small packet.

The reason for this care is to prevent domestic animalsfrom eating the bones and members of the household from inadver-tantly urinating or defecating on them. Contact between the bonesand domestic animals (especially pigs and chickens) or human ex-creta may cause the hunter who killed the animal to lose his abilityto find game-thatis, he will be afflicted withsbimpankamu.An-other precaution related to the proper disposal of animal remains isthat all people who partake of the meat should wash their handsover the fireplace after the meal rather than doing it near the innerwalls of the house, as is the usual custom. This practice makes iteven more unlikely that minute portions of the animal will be ex-posed to pollution. The most fastidious hunters go so far as to insistthat meat be cooked in a pot that has never been used to cook otherkinds of food. Indeed, I was told that each animalspeciesshouldhave its own pot so that the meat is not mixed with that of otheranimals. (When elderly women inventory their clay pots, they oftenidentify some pots as \"paca cookers,\" \"spider monkey cookers,\" andso forth.) One man claimed that his son lost his ability to find game\"because his wife used the same pot to cook palm fruit, plantainbroth, and meat.\"When a hunting dog has been used to kill a particular gameanimal, the dog's owner observes a still more elaborate set of pre-cautions. Meat taken with the assistance of a dog is never allowedto leave the house once it has been brought in. This means thatportions of the animal are not sent to neighboring households asgifts. Animals killed with dogs are carefully butchered, and themeat is then wrapped in leaves and hung in a basket so that it willbe out of the reach of domestic animals. When the meat is cooked,the pot containing it is not allowed to boil over, lest some of themeat or broth fallon the ground. When people drink the broth, theyare supposed to scoop it out of the serving bowl with their hands ordrink it directly by lifting the bowl; clam shells or metal spoonsshould not be used as eating utensils. Children who cry while themeat is being eaten or who complain that they haven't enough toeat are removed from the house. Failure to take these precautionswill causesbimpankamufor both the hunting dog and its owner.One informant remarked that these rules are not always respected,citing the case of some Huambisa who made it a practice to sellmeat taken with the aid of hunting dogs to mestizo settlers. Theywere able to get away with this breach of taboo only by constantlyfeeding their dogs powerful medicines that counteracted its effect.92Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

First, the Aguaruna recognize an enduring connection be-tween an organism and its exuviae. Unlike the members of manyother societies, however, the Aguaruna seem less concerned withthe possibility that human exuviae might be used for purposes ofwitchcraft than that some accidental defilement of the castoff ma-terial will bring harm to the person from whom the material comes.When trimming hair, for example, people see to it that none of thehair is swept outside of the house where it might be urinated upon,since this kind of polluting contact will prevent their hair fromgrowing in the future. Similarly, an infant's afterbirth is buried in-side the house for fear that if it were buried in the forest it couldbecome cold and wet, thus causing the infant to fallill.\"Based onthis same logic, animal bones are thought to retain an enduring linkto the species that produced them.\" Defilementof the bonesthrough careless handling contradicts the attraction and intimacycentral to the ideal relationship between hunter and quarry.The taboos also reflect concern with the relations between manand dog. When a dog provides meat through its hunting skill, in asense it fills the role of a person and must be treated with appro-priate respect. Thus the broth of the meat is drunk with cuppedhands or by tipping the bowl, since the use of an eating utensilwould formally mark the eaters as different from and superior tothe dog. The rules against sending meat out of the house and put-ting up with the complaints of children may also be seen as ways ofshowing respect to the dog in return for its services.Iwish to stress,however, that the latter interpretationsare mine alone. The Agu-aruna themselves were primarily concerned with preventing thedog from being \"ruined\" and offered no more detailed explanationof how these rules protect the luck of hunter and dog.An important effect of this system of prohibitions is that peopleare disinclined to make gifts of raw meat between households, sinceone cannot be sure that members of another household will be ascareful as they ought to be in disposing of the bones.'? In both com-munities in whichIlived for extended periods, gifts of raw meatwere rare. On the other hand, dinner invitations in which a hunterasked several neighbors to eat meat in his own house were verycommon. During these visits, the host and his guests usually man-aged to consume most of the animal. Although mandated by a sys-tem of taboos, meal invitations are consonant with the prevailingsystem by which men acquire personal prestige. Communal mealspermit the hunter to be the center of attention in his multiple rolesThe Usesof Affinity93 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

This could not be so easily accomplished through a gift of rawmeat. The few exceptions to this pattern of meal invitations usuallyoccurred when there had been a major kill of the increasingly rarecollared peccary. In this case, a single household might acquiremore meat than it could consume or preserve by smoking and salt-ing, so gifts of meat were sent to households that had none. Restric-tions on interhouseholdsharing do not apply to foods such as wildfruits, fish, or garden produce, which are freely distributed in unpre-pared form.When a man sees that he is consistently unable to find animalsin the forest, he begins to suspect that in some way he or a memberof his household has broken one of the rules that preventshimpan-kamu.From my own observations, a hunter is less concerned withdetermining the cause of hissbimpankamuthan in finding the fast-est possible remedy. There is, however, no single infallible way todo this. Men first try to acquire one or more of the hunting charmsmentioned earlier, either ayukastone, a \"game bird fl}j\" or a pow-erful variety of one of the herbs that attract game. If acquisition ofa new hunting charm does not remedy the situation, they resort tomore drastic cures. One consists of grabbing the trunk of thetagkantree (probablyTriplarissp.), which is inhabited by a stinging ant ofthe same name. The hunter holds on until the stings of the antsbecome unbearable, an act that may result in a fever of one or twodays' duration. He will subsequently discover that his ability to findgame has returned. Alternatively a man can cureshimpankamubyshooting off a branch of the same tree with a blast of his shotgun.In a case of prolongedsbimpankamu,men drink infusions ofthe powerful hallucinogenicnightshadebikut (Brugmansiasp.)with the hope of obtaining the type of vision known asniimagbau.This vision, which emphasizes material prosperity and hunting suc-cess, is usually sufficient to restore their ability to find and killgame. People in the Alto Mayo say that regardless of how one rem-ediesshitnpankamu,after it has been cured the hunter will find allthe animals that eluded him during the period of his affliction. Oldmen are wont to complain that no cure is possible for theirshim-pankamubecause their households have become so large that thereare always women and children polluting the remains of game ani-mals. \"My father used to say that when he got old he couldn't findgame any more,\" one elderly man told me wistfully. \"Now the samehas happened to me.

This is commonlycalledbeseiatiamu,aword that is related tobesemat,\"to be ruined, to receive a badomen.\"Beseiatiamuoccurs when one man \"dreams\" another, thatis, has a dream in which a second man plays a prominent role. TheAguaruna describe these dreams as being quite ordinary. In the mostfrequently cited example, a man dreams that an acquaintancehaskilled many animals and is carrying them back to his house. De-spite the favorable imagery of the dream, it has the effect of spoilingthe marksmanshipof the dreamed person when he uses either ablowgun or firearms.It may also leave him feeling constantlydrowsy.If the dreamer and the dreamed enjoy friendly relations, the for-mer will immediatelytell the latter about the dream and propose acure. The cure is very simple: the dreamer squeezes a small quan-tity of tobacco juice into the dreamed man's eyes while repeatingthe phrase \"I throw out thebeseiatiatnu\"It was, and still is, baffling to me why the act of dreaming aboutanother man's hunting exploits would cause the dreamed person tolose his marksmanshipability. This belief may be related to theAguaruna concern with dreams that cause \"soul killing\"(wakanimantuamu).A warrior or shaman who dreams that he is killing agame animal-anarmadillo, an agouti, or whatever-mayin factbe killing the soul of one of his young children who happens to besleeping near him on the sleeping platform.Achild whose soul hasbeen killed soon falls victim to fatal illness. To prevent this, awoman sleeps between her husband and her child when they sharethe same bed. Men may also have dreams in which they kill anenemy's soul, which in turn makes the enemy's body more vulner-able to attack. (A common refrain in the songs of men who seekkilling visions through the use of hallucinogensis \"I dream myenemy,\" which implies that they will acquire the power to assassi-nate their rivals.) The dreams of men are thus perceived as compet-itive and, in some cases, damaging to the well-being of the persondreamed.Asecond set of circumstancesin which a hunter's marksman-ship may be unfavorably affected was described to me by MiguelDaichap:When a man has intercourse with his wife while hunting spider mon-keys, his blowgun sometimes becomes jealous.

The blowgun then says, \"Everything's fine becauseIhavehad sexual relations with my wife.\" After that, the blowgun shootsstraight and the man can kill monkeys.This idiosyncratic account provoked much appreciative laugh-ter among the other people who heard it, and I initially suspectedthat Miguel may have invented it to enhance his already consider-able reputation as a storyteller. Nevertheless, it does fit rather wellwith some of the beliefs mentioned earlier in this chapter. I re-corded two poorly remembered segments of songs directed to theblowgun in which it was addressed personally and told: \"Wake up,wake up. Your enemy the spider monkey is coming.\" When a manoffers his wife to the jealous blowgun so that it will shoot straight,his behavior echoes A.3, a song that draws attention to a woman'scharms in order to attract game.Sexual symbolism thus pervades hunting magic, and as we shallsee in a later chapter, the symbolism of the hunt figures promi-nently in the magic of sexual attraction. Hunting, like sexuality, isfundamental to the perpetuation of the Aguaruna way of life.

To a scientific observer, the Agu-arona horticulturalsystem is remarkably productive and resistantto the climatic fluctuations,plant diseases, and pests that makeplant cultivation so risky in the temperate zones. Not so for theAguaruna gardener, who feels that without magical interventionthe success of her crops is always in doubt.The contradictionbetween garden productivity and the appar-ent anxiety of the producers is mystifying as long as we envisioneconomic or botanical facts as being separate from culturally con-stituted emotions, understandings,and strategies of production.

They can be harvested throughout the year,eliminating the problems of harvesting and storage associated withseasonal crops. Some nontuberous crops, including plantains, ba-nanas, maize, peanuts, and various fruits, do make a significantcontribution to the diet, however. Rice, which is cultivated for salerather than consumption, has also become an important horticul-tural product in some of the communitiesof the Alto Mayo.An inventory of the food crops of the Alto Mayo will be found inTable 5.Plants are cultivated in slash-and-burn gardens, or swiddens(a;a),located as near as possible to each house site. When a newhouse is constructed, people customarily plant manioc, plantains,and other crops immediately around the house. As production inthe gardens adjacent to the house begins to decline, new gardensare established at suitable sites farther away, though part of the orig-inal garden near the house is usually maintained as a sort of kitchengarden for the cultivation of plants important in technology, ritual,and health maintenance. (See Figure4.)Houses that have been oc-cupied for a few years thus have a kitchen garden, one new root cropgarden that is beginning to produce, and one or more old gardens(asQuk)whose production is in decline.

Most Aguarunagardeners have from ten to twenty-five distinct, named varieties ofmanioc in their gardens, and the total number of varieties knownto the Aguaruna may exceed one hundred (Boster1983:61).2Varie-ties are distinguished according to several characteristics, particu-larly the shape and color of the leaves. People prefer to eat somevarieties boiled or roasted, while others are more suitable for thepreparation of beer. Women acquire new varieties of manioc fromother women in the same community or from kinswomen in dis-tant communities.If the botanical knowledge underlying manioc cultivation iscomplex, its technology is extremely simple. Pieces of maniocstems are placed in the ground after a new garden has been pre-pared. When the stems have taken root and the plants have grownto a height of approximately1.5meters, a woman begins to traveldaily to the garden to harvest as many tubers as she needs. Afterharvesting a mature plant, she cuts off a section of stem and re-plants it in the spot vacated by the harvested plant. Thus, like theharvest, replanting is continuous. The only implements used in thecultivation of manioc are the machete and a pointed digging stick(wai)made of palm wood.One of the reasons why manioc is so important is that it can beconverted into manioc beer(nijamanch),a dietary mainstay and themajor lubricant of Aguaruna social life. To make beer, women boilthe tubers, mash them to a pulp like consistency with a woodenpestle, chew the pulp to soften it further, and then place the mashin a large pot to ferment. When mixed with water, the fermentedmash becomes a nutritious and intoxicating beverage. Beer is con-sumed daily, and most Aguaruna consider it to be an essential-eventhemost essential-partof theirdiet.\"Brent and Elois Ann Berlin(1977:13)calculate that during itsproductive life an average quarter-hectare garden supplies enoughmanioc to maintain a family of ten persons. Because the averagehousehold size is considerably less than this (five persons perhousehold in the area studied by Berlin and Berlin, 7.4 persons perhousehold in the Alto Mayo), they are forced to conclude that \"theAguaruna produce-orhave the potential to produce-muchmorethan they actually need\"(1977:13).During my own fieldwork,Inever heard of a catastrophic garden failure, nor did any householdsuffer from a substantial shortage of manioc unless serious illnessor relocation to a new village prevented a woman from pursuing herhorticultural tasks.102Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

These tasks include planting, weeding, harvesting, washingthe tubers, and cooking. Because Aguaruna horticulture is primar-ily oriented to the productionof tuberous crops, gardening isthought of as a feminine activity. Women consider themselves to bethe owners of most gardens, except those devoted to male cashcrops.A woman's success in horticulture has a direct relation to hersocial standing in the household and the community. The hospital-ity that a man can extend to visitors is in no small measure deter-mined by his wife's skill in cultivating manioc and turning it intomanioc beer; frequent shortages of beer in the household may kin-dle a husband's wrath.Aman who is a mediocre hunter may haveother socially valued skills that compensate for his inadequacy.Women, however, have few other avenues in which to excel if theylack horticulturalprowess.Awoman's social identity is thusclosely tied to the productivity of her swidden garden.The Swidden as Symbolic SpaceThe garden is an area of space rich in symbolic associations.Women and their children spend several hours there nearly everyday. A woman puts her baby in a tiny hammock hung in some shadyspot, and her other children play quietly nearby while she goesabout her tasks. Sometimes women help each other in the garden-mother and daughter, for example, or a woman and her unmarriedsister-andwhen one walks near the swidden their laughter can beheard through the tangle of manioc stems. Here, in the relative pri-vacy of this space, women discuss intimate matters related to theirdaily lives. They may also use this time together to exchange mag-ical songs that encourage the growth of their plants or renew theaffection of their wayward husbands.In mythical times, the garden was the scene of romantic liai-sons between women and animals in human form. When the ances-tors did not know how to give birth without cutting open a wom-an's womb, they were taught proper childbirth bykatip,the mouse,in a garden (Jordana Laguna1974:107-10).The garden is also the principal point of contact betweenwomen and a variety of powerful beings.

As one would expect, the souls of manioc plants arethe ones with which Aguaruna women are most immediately con-cerned. How people came to know that manioc plants have soulswas explained to me as follows:Long ago people did not make gardens as we dotoday,Instead of wait-ing until the entire garden was cleared of brush and large trees, womenbegan to plant manioc as soon as a small part of the garden wascleared. [Presumably, this was because forest clearance was muchslower before the introduction of steel tools.] Thus the manioc wassometimes mature in some parts of the garden before the entire gardenhad been cleared.One day a man who was clearing a garden said to his wife, \"If I cutdown this big tree, it might fallon the manioc that is already growing.Shall I leave it standing or cut it down?\" He decided to cut it downand instructed his wife to make manioc beer so that he could invitehis kinsmen to help him.A few days later the men came, and after drinking manioc beerthey began to chop down the large tree. Suddenly the souls of themanioc plants arose; they were people, lots of people. The maniocpeople said, \"We will help cut the tree so that it won't fall in our di-rection.\" When the manioc people arose, all of the men fell asleep.Some of the manioc people began to pull a vine growing on thetree, while others cut the tree with axes. They pulled the tree so thatit would fall away from them. As they pulled, the old manioc peoplesang, \"Sons, pull hard so that the tree won't crush our children. Whenwe're done we'll eat the head of a spider monkey.\"When the tree had been felled, the manioc people disappeared.Among the sleeping men, the man who had called the work partycould hear the songs of the manioc people in his sleep. Because ofthis, we know that manioc has a soul, that it has people.Although Karsten(1935:123)reports that the Shuar regard thesoul of manioc as being female, Alto Mayo women reason that sincemanioc plants are \"people,\" there must be both male and femaleplants, as well as adults and children.

If she does this, how will the man-ioc grow so that she can make beer for our father?\" To avoid this, youmust always collect every tuber when digging up a manioc plant.The souls of manioc plants are extremely dangerous during the firstfew months after planting. The young plants become thirsty, and ifthis thirst is not quenched by the appropriate means they may\"drink the blood\" of people passing through the garden. The drink-ing of blood is also called \"soul eating,\" and as far asIcould deter-mine the two expressions are used interchangeably. Both soul eatingand blood drinking denote a tapping of a person's life force suchthat he or she becomes weak, pale, and unable to resist death in theform of illness or snakebite. To avoid this danger, children are dis-couraged from playing by themselves in recently planted maniocgardens (cf. Harner 1972:75).While manioc is thecultigenmost consistently attributed asoul, other plants of lesser importance-e.g.,arrowroot, cocoyam,and achira-alsohave \"people\" with whom gardeners interact. Oneof the goals of a gardener is to encourage the plant \"people\" to assistmanioc in its growth and development. So far asIknow, nontuber-ous crops such as plantains, maize, and rice are never attributedsouls, nor do they receive any ritual attention.Afew women spoke of a being whom they called the \"maniocmother\"(mama dukuji)or \"manioc master\"(mama muunji).WhileIcould obtain little information on this being-therewas noconsensus of opinion even on whether it exists-thosewomen whomentioned it clearly distinguished it from Nugkui. They also sug-gested that it resides in the largest manioc plant in the garden. Themanioc mother sometimes moves around in the garden while awoman is at work:When you hear a twig snap on the edge of the garden, you shouldn'tlook in that direction because it's the manioc mother. If you look ather, she gets angry and shits weeds. The whole garden fills withweeds.Ifyou don't look at her, she is happy. She shits manioc and theplants grow quickly.106Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Some women claim that gardeningsongs come directly from Nugkui, but a more common belief in theAlto Mayo is that they were first sung by Yampan, the senior wifeof Etsa, the sun. Yampan, a myth explains, had wonderful horticul-tural powers that she used to produce food for her family. When shetried to teach her food-producing magic to Etsa's other wives, how-ever, they invariably made disastrous blunders. Tired of their in-competence, Yampan went to live in the sky after first teaching herdaughters the secrets of gardening songs. In memory of the skill ofYampan, women sing \"I am a Yampan woman\" as they mash man-ioc tubers to make beer. This makes the beer sweet and strong, asYampan's beer was reputed to be.Every phase of the horticultural cycle, from clearing a garden toharvesting tubers, has its appropriate magical songs. The intent ofthe songs varies slightly according to the context, but their generalpurpose is to make the crops grow faster and more abundantly. Oneinformant said simply, \"If you plant a stem of manioc next to thestem of a forest plant, the manioc will always grow faster becausesongs help it grow.\" Specific gardening songs may also control weedsand pests, ward off influences that impede plant growth, and re-strain the propensity of the manioc plants to drink human blood.Each type of song is performed during the activity with which it isassociated. As is the case with all magical songs, singing may bedone aloud or in the thoughts alone.Aguaruna theories of how the songs affect plant growth varysubstantially. Some people stress the mediating role of Nugkui, whois pleased by the songs and translates her pleasure into a lush gar-den. Others argue that the songs are heard directly by the plants, bythe birdsukuya(a Nugkui messenger), by the manioc mother, or byall of these. In the examples that follow, however, it is evident thatwhile some of the songs are formally addressed to Nugkui and otherThe Garden's Children107 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

In this respect, gar-dening songs share much in common with the hunting songs dis-cussed in the previous chapter.Women think of gardening songs as valuable personal posses-sions that should be accumulated and hoarded rather than sharedfreely with their peers. Indeed, comments made during interviewsand the contentsof gardening songs themselves suggest thatwomen see their relationship to other gardeners as potentially com-petitive, even hostile. They are secretive about their songs and mag-ical gardening stones. They fear envious comments made by otherwomen about their gardens, since these can have a negative effecton plant growth, and they occasionally use songs to curse womenwho surreptitiously enter their swiddens. Because a woman's per-sonal prestige and her desirability as a wife are at least partly deter-mined .by her horticulturalproductivity, the magical knowledgethat ensures this productivity is a jealously guarded commodity.The following are some examples of gardening songs known towomen of the Alto Rio Mayo. In choosing examples for analysis, Ihave used songs whose translation I am satisfied with and whichare fairly representative of their class as a whole.Songs for Selecting and Clearing a Garden SiteAs was noted earlier, the responsibility for choosing a garden siteusually falls on a woman's husband. However, women believe thatcertain songs create favorable conditions for garden site selection.The following song, A.7, is sung by a woman as she accompaniesher husband on his search:A.7 The soil of the ancients he will findManioc that does not spoil he will findYams that grow fat he will findPeanuts that grow fat he will findThe soil of the ancients he will findBeing a Nugkui woman,Icome without bringing misfortuneShakaim man, lead the wayOthers say thatImake a gardenThey themselves work poor soil[In] mine, [in] mineThe soil of the ancients he will findYams that grow fat he will findManioc that does not spoil he will find108Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

All of the people whomIconsulted insisted thatin this contextaiiitaprefers not to the spirit but to \"ancestors\" or\"old ones\" in general. Nevertheless, the word inevitably has reso-nances of spiritual power. The gardener seeks soil that is as fertileas that of ancient women such as Yampan and as untouched byhuman activity as a remote, ancestral forest. Thus establishing thefertility of the soil, the song proceeds to describe the flourishingcrops that will grow there, and in doing so the actors are metaphor-ically telescoped into a highly favorable future. Allusions to Nugkuiand Shakaim, which have already been noted in hunting songs, ap-pear again: \"Being a Nugkui woman / I come without bringing mis-fortune / Shakaim man, lead the way.\" The singer and her husbandfulfill traditional and complementary roles, and like the mythicalbeings who established these roles they can expect only good for-tune to come as a result.The work of felling trees and clearing underbrush at garden sitesis both arduous and risky. Falling trees sometimes cause injury ordeath, and men cutting brush are frequently exposed to the dangersof snakebite. A knowledgeable wife sings songs that protect herhusband from these threats to his well-being. These songs may, forexample, equate her husband with the coati(Nasua ruiai,an animalthat reportedly is unafraid of snakes and skillful at dodging theirattacks. The woman also goes frequently to the garden to serve beerto her husband and the other men working there. During these vis-its, she is exposed to sights and sounds believed to exert a banefulinfluence on her gardening ability-thewhistling and joking of themen as they work, the crack of falling trees, the sight of leavesfluttering to the forest floor. It is the fate of men to destroy plantsso that their wives can give plants life, and a woman's contact withthis male activity diminishes her growth-promoting powers. To pro-tect herself from these harmfulinfluences,a womansings songssuch as the following:A.S Large, ugly demon's eye [the lookof her husband as he turns to drink beer]Bringing misfortune with your lookBringing misfortune with your whistleInever fail,Inever failA Nugkui woman cannot failA.9 Doves, doves [Le., the falling leaves of felled trees]Manioc is fallingThe Garden's Children109 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

To plant manioc, awoman first goes to her old garden and cuts short sections of man-ioc stems.

The song equatesthe percussionof the digging stick withdrumming, which (as will be discussed shortly) has life-giving con-notations in Aguaruna mythology. Unlike the sounds made by menwhen clearing a garden, the sound of a digging stick is an auditoryexpression of a woman's proper activity and therefore exerts a favor-able influence on her labor. The song also plays on the similaritybetween the traditional palm wood lance and the digging stick; thelancelike stick kills weeds as the woman turns the soil.

The first stanzaevidently describes a woman's morning journey from house to swid-den. She carries a basket and some coals from the fireplace, thelatter to be used for kindling a small fire to burn weeds. Returningwith a full basket, she stops to wash the tubers in a stream or river.\"With the water of Atsut,\" begins the second stanza, \"I will wash /with the urine of the stars / I will wash.\" The allusion to Atsut isbased on a myth {a variant of which is found in Jordana Laguna1974:39-44} that identifies Atsut as a person or group of peoplewho receives the souls of the dead as they ascend into the sky. Inan Alto Mayo version of this myth, Atsut places the dead in a drum-like container and restores them to life by beating on it. Later on inthe same tale, Atsut and the souls of the dead change themselvesinto fruits and tubers when they are frightened by an attack of antswhom they mistake for warriors. Atsut thus has at least two quali-ties that lend themselves to the representation of fertility:(1)thepower to change into edible plants, and(2)the ability to impart lifethrough rhythmic pounding, just as the gardener brings life to herswidden by beating on the ground with her digging stick.The succeeding phrase, \"With the urine of the stars / I wash,\"is more difficult to interpret. Some people contend that the urineof the stars is simply dew, and that the phrase means that thewoman washes the tubers with hands as cool as dew rather thanwith hot hands that can harm the manioc. Star urine, however, isgiven a different identity in a myth about a man who marries a starthat comes to earth in the form of a woman (Jordana Laguna1974:132-36).The star-womanurinatessmall, colored beads(shauk)instead of ordinary urine. The sensible properties of beadsinclude their abundance-ittakes many beads to fill a small vol-ume-andattractiveness;they are the most highly valued orna-ments owned by Aguaruna women. The phrase \"With the urine ofthe stars / I wash\" can thus also be construed to suggest that thewoman brings the tubers into contact with numerous beads.

The principal ideabehind this and the preceding star-urine metaphors is that the tub-ers should be as numerous, fecund, and attractive as beads orpetsaplants.\"As A.16 demonstrates, many of the symbols and images of gar-dening songs originate in mythology. The examples already adducedallude to Nugkui, Yampan, Shakaim, and Atsut. Another myth fig-ure frequently mentioned in gardening songs is Uwanchau, a beingwho is identified in this grisly tale:Long ago, a woman whose newborn child had recently died came uponan infant in the forest. It had been brought by the wind. The babycried \"uwa, uwa.\" Because of this it was called Uwanchau. It had veryfat lips. The woman took Uwanchau home and began to nurse it. Itsucked and sucked until the woman had no more milk. Then it kepton sucking until it drank all of her blood and the woman died. Herhusband killed the baby Uwanchau with his machete. The baby wasfull of blood.Gardening songs often end with the couplet, \"I am a Nugkuiwoman /Iam an Uwanchau woman.\" The persuasive intent of theidentification of the gardener with Nugkui is obvious, but why thecomparison to the ghoulish infant UwanchauiIfeel that this usagehas a twofold significance. First, by saying that she is like Uwan-chau a woman establishes an affinity with her \"children,\" the man-ioc plants, which are also beings capable of sucking blood. Second,a woman who is full of blood like Uwanchau has demonstrated thatshe is able to control the dangerous thirst of her manioc plants byusing the appropriate songs and rituals. That is, she has retained herblood because her manioc plants have been unable or unwilling totake it from her owing to her ritual knowledge. By invoking theimage of Uwanchau in this context, the gardener implies that sheis close to her plants and that, like a mother controlling her chil-dren, she prevents them from misbehaving.Gardening StonesLong ago gardens did not grow well. A young man married a girl andcame to live at her father's house. The girl said to her mother, \"Arethere no plantains to serve?\" Her mother went to the garden to getplantains, while the girl stayed behind.

Because of this, all women wantgardening stones.This myth about a woman's visionary experience and the jag-uar's gift is typical of narratives related to a category of magicalstones callednantag.Women usenantagstones to increase the pro-ductivity of manioc and other tuberous crops. Because the acquisi-tion and use ofnantagare considered essential to horticultural pro-duction, these stones are a woman's most closely guarded personalpossessions.Aguaruna women conventionally describenantagas shiny, redpebbles, a claim that is consonant with Harner's statement thatsimilar stones used by the Shuar are\" chips of unworked red jasper\"(Harner 1972:72). However, from my own observations and those ofMargaret Van Bolt, thenantagused by Alto Mayo women actuallyresemble riverbottom pebbles of two to ten centimeters in diameterand of various colors (Brown and Van Bolt 1980).Afew women statethat the color of thenantagindicates the cultigen with which it isprimarily associated-e.g.,red stones are for manioc, black stonesare for yams, and so on-butthis opinion is not widely held. Mostwomen feel that the actual color of the stone does not affect itspowers, though as we shall see it is significant that the archetypalcolor ofnantagis red.Although it was difficult to penetrate the secrecy surroundingnantaguse,Iwas able to determine that most, if not all, adultwomen own several of them that they have obtained in variousways.

He followed the trail and came upon a curassow sitting in a tree.He shot the curassow and returned home.

Tomorrow you should go there and get it. This is astone for manioc and yams.Inever suffer from hunger [Le., becausethe stone is powerful]. Don't neglect the stone. Give it achiote todrink, because it killed my sister. Take care ofit.\"The next morning,he went to the spot and found thenantagstone on the log across thetapir's trail.While this account is somewhat unusual in that the woman'shusband is the one who dreams of the stone, in other respects it istypical of many such experiences described by Alto Mayo women.The person who appears in the dream is sometimes said to be Nug-kui. In other cases, the speaker is the nighthawksukuya,anaiiitap,or an animal spirit.Women occasionally stumble acrossnan tagin a totally unex-pected manner. A shiny stone found in the nest of a bird or rodent,or in the entrails of certain fish, is often suspected of being anan-tag.Women say that a stone may catch their eye by \"moving byitself\" on the riverbottom,this, too, is a sign that the stone is anantag.My co-worker, Margaret Van Bolt, once witnessed the dis-covery of a possiblenantagwhile helping a woman harvest manioc.The woman,WampuraiPeas, found a pebble next to the tuber shewas digging, an unmistakablesign that the pebble was associatedwith manioc growth. After cleaning the stone and examining itcarefully, Wampurai wrapped it in a rag and commented that shewould later test it to see whether it had the power of anantag.Onetests a suspectednantagby bringing it into contact with stem cut-tings during planting and then looking for evidence of unusualgrowth.

She takes with her the tubers andmanioc stem cuttings in a basket, hernan tagstones wrapped in apiece of cloth, an old ceramic or metal pot, enough water to fill thepot, and a number of pods of red-staining achiote(Bixaorellana).She may also bring one or more of the following plant substances:the roots ofwampusbandmente(both of which are trees), the rootof the herbseekemu(source of a native soap), and the roots or bulbsof the medicinal herbspiiipigandkampanak.(See Table6.)In somecases, the bowl, water,nantagstones, or plant substances are storedin a small shelter in the garden in preparation for the plantingritual.Upon arriving in the garden, the woman crushes a pod ofachiote and uses the red pulp to paint lines on her cheekbones andon those of other people who may be accompanying her, e.g., herchildren. This is done because thenantagstones (and the maniocplants, if some have already been planted) are potentially dangerous,and it is important that the woman and her companions identifythemselves as friends by being painted.The-woman unwraps thenantagfrom their cloth and puts themin a bowl. Then she mashes the rest of the achiote pods and putsthe red seed pulp in the bowl, mixing it with water to form a redliquid. If the other plant materials mentioned earlier have been col-lected, they are now mashed and mixed with the liquid in the bowl.118Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Aguaruna women state that the redliquid satisfies the dangerous thirst of the manioc plants; somewomen explicitly refer to the liquid as \"blood.\" The plant sub-stances added to the \"blood\" further increase its power by transfer-ring their desirable qualities to the liquid and, through the liquid,to the manioc.

Her son came therealone to take cocona fruits. That night she had a dream in which thenantag,in the form of a person, sang to her, \"Mother, mother,Ihaveeaten.\" The woman awoke and thought, \"Why did she speak to melike that?\" She went to her garden to look at her stones. On top of thestones was a bunch of human hair. She asked her children, \"Who wentto the garden?\" Her son said, \"I went hunting, and on the way home Iwas hungry and ate cocona fruits.\" He soon died of snakebite. Thenantaghad eaten his soul.The planting ritual and its songs protect the gardener and herfamily from thenantagby slaking their dangerous thirst. The ritualis not the only context in which the stones are fed; a prudentwoman immerses hernantagin achiote and water \"blood\" aboutonce a month to keep them satisfied. Said one woman: \"Eachmonth thenantagmust drink achiote. If they are not fed, they caneat us.\" When the stones become thirsty, the owner may have adream in which a young girl tells her, \"Mother,Iam suffering fromthirst. Please give me something to drink.\" To feed the stones, awoman takes them from the cloth in which they are wrapped andleaves them in a bowl of achiote and water for several hours or over-night. The stones are then removed from the liquid, dried off, re-wrapped in cloth, and returned to their hiding place.Besides having the propensity to drink blood or eat souls andthe ability to assume human form in dreams,nantagstones alsomove by themselves as if alive.Awoman who fails to keep herstones well fed and securely wrapped in cloth will someday findthat the stones have \"run away.\" I was told by one woman that as ayoung girl she went to a woman'sgarden and came upon a bowl fulloftiantagimmersed in water and achiote, which had evidently beenleft there by the garden's owner. She stole two of the stones-theywere, she said, \"so pretty that it was impossible to resist takingthem\"-andlater gave them to her mother, who was very pleased.That same night the girl dreamed that a child was saying to her, \"Idon't like it here.Imiss my mother.\" The next day, the two stolennantaghad disappeared from their hiding place.

The most important of thesegrowth-promotingspecies are the cultigens arrowroot, cocoyam,and achira.

If a woman doesn't have theseplants in her garden, manioc won't grow there.\"The belief that manioc will thrive only when planted withother cultigens provides a culturally compelling reason to maintaina mixed planting strategy in the garden. It also expresses the degreeto which women see the relations of the plants in the garden asapproximating human social relations. Many of the plants are\"people,\" with husbands, wives, and children. The gardener is their\"mother,\" who cares for them while maintaining order in their re-lations.

The re-ported ability ofpiiipigto encourage manioc growth appears to bean extensionof the diffuse and wide-ranging magical powers attrib-uted to it by the Aguaruna.

Here again, people offered no clear state-ment of how the plant helps manioc. Some informants remarkedthat the fruits are \"just likenantagstones,\" leading me to suspectthat it is the fruits' color, through its chromatic associations withblood andnantagstones, that links this plant to garden productiv-ity in Aguaruna thought.Finally, a few Alto Mayo women mentioned the existence of aspecial variety of manioc, calledyapaumama(literally, \"bittermanioc\"), that women plant at the edge of the garden to promotegrowth and to poison garden pests such as the paca and agouti. Theysaid that few Aguaruna women have this variety, and that it is mostcommonly found among the Chayahuita Indians, with whom AltoMayo people have occasional contact. Presumably, the plant theyare referring to is true bitter manioc, that is, one of the maniocvarieties that must be processed before consumption because of itshigh prussic acid content. As far as I know, no Alto Mayo womencultivate bitter manioc (nor do ethnographic sources mention bittermanioc cultivation among other Jivaroan groups), but it is interest-ing that gardeners have heard of it and attribute it unusual powers.Gardening AvoidancesCertain juxtapositions of objects or acts are detrimental to plantgrowth and therefore to be avoided, especially during planting andthe first few months of a garden's life. Gardeners avoid sexual rela-tions immediately before, during, and after planting days becausethe pollution of intercourse can have a negative effect on highlyvulnerable manioc cuttings. (Contact with sexual pollution also de-stroys the power ofnantagstones; this in tum prevents the fulldevelopmentof the garden.] Women apparently avoid newly plantedgardens during their menstrual periods, since the smell of men-strual blood \"burns\" the plants, causing them to turn yellow andsickly. The smell of newborn infants is similarly dangerous, pre-sumably because of neonates' association with placental blood.I collected from various women a heterogeneous list of less im-portant avoidances:• During manioc planting, women should not eat the feet of anygame bird or domestic fowl, \"so that the manioc will not bethin.\" One informant added a prescriptive dimension to thisbelief by commenting that it is good for a woman to eat thefoot of the tapir because this makes the manioc grow well.124Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Insteadof leaving the holes empty until more cuttings can be col-lected, the gardener \"plants\" twigs of any available tree untilthey can be replaced with manioc stems. \"If a hole were leftempty,\" said one woman, \"a deer might put its hoof in it andspoil the garden.\" The deer is one of the forms taken by de-monic souls, and its contact with the new garden would beharmful to the growing plants.• When planting, women never drink plain water when they arethirsty; manioc beer is always drunk instead. Opinion variesas to why this is important. Some women say that drinkingplain water simply stunts the crop, while others take the viewthat avoiding- water prevents the tubers from becoming hardand unpalatable.The diverse avoidances are clearly intended to prevent bringingtogether things or activities whose salient qualities might be trans-ferred to the garden with disastrous results. A woman who eatsbirds' feet on planting days, for example, juxtaposes the feet, whichare outstandingly scrawny, with her manioc, which she wants to beoutstandingly thick. The manioc might then assume the characterof the feet, to the detriment of the garden. The taboo against drink-ing plain water has a similar logic. Water is a liquid drunk by theAguaruna only when manioc beer is unavailable, that is, when theyare in a state of temporary poverty. The gardener, therefore, avoidsplain water lest the poverty it represents be transferred to her plants.The Structure of Garden MagicHere it would do us well to step out of this thicket of ethnographicdetails and try to look for a general pattern by which we can betterunderstand horticultural practices and beliefs.

This juxtaposition of images in thecontext of practical activity is reinforced by the juxtaposition ofobjects (for example, the plant substances used in the planting rit-ual) similarly noted for their rapid growth or some other desirablecharacteristic.Nantagstones, palpable sources of spiritual power,are also brought into direct contact with the plants of the garden.Finally, gardening taboos guarantee that unfavorable juxtaposi-tions-bywhich Imeanthe bringing together of objects or actionswhose symbolic qualities are antagonistic to productivity-donotoccur. By manipulating imagery, acts,and objects, a gardener con-sciously creates a new order in the swidden, she informs nature,restructuring it to serve her own ends. In this restructuring process,two symbolic themes or patterns of imagery are especially promi-nent:(1)the complementarityof men and women, and ('2)bloodand blood taking.Subsistence tasks and other pursuits are, asIhave noted, distin-guished according to gender. Men perform the activities of highestprestige, hunting and warfare, as well as such additional tasks aswoodworking, weaving, and basketmaking. Women labor in theswidden, tend domestic animals, and manufacture pottery. The at-tribution of highest prestige to male activities corresponds to a per-vasive masculine bias that is also reflected in marital relations, pol-itics, and religion.IIAs is so often the case, the sexual division of labor lays thegroundwork for a dialectical symbolism in which male activities,qualities,objects, and spirits are paired with and opposed to femaleactivities, objects, and so forth. Some of the more obvious opposi-tions are listed in Table 7, but this twinned litany could be ex-panded to include additional cultural elements ad infinitum.In their lucid analysis of sexual symbolism in a remarkablysimilar culture, that of the Ilongot of Northern Luzon, MichelleRosaldo andJ.M. Atkinson(1975:43)argue that \"the oppositionbetween life-giving and life-taking illuminates symbolic definitionsof the sexes.\" The Ilongot, like the Aguaruna, are former headhun-ters who associate warfare and hunting with men and horticulturewith women. Rosaldo and Atkinson suggest that the pervasive life-giving versus life-taking opposition ultimately boils down to one ofnature (female) versus culture (male), since homicide is a willful126Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Here,Ithink, the similarity to the Aguaruna case ends,for the Aguaruna do not elaborate the culture/nature theme as con-sistently as one might think at first glance. Women have certaintraits that put them on the \"culture\" side of the equation: they singbetter than men and are therefore more adept at using magicalsongs; they work in the garden, which is more culturalized than theforest domain in which men seek game. Even the elemental con-trast between warfare and childbearing is not quite what it seems.Headhunting certainly requires the taking of life, but the ritualscelebrating the acquisition of trophy heads confer life-giving powerson warriors and the women of their households (Karsten1935).Andas we have seen, the procedures used by women to promote plantgrowth may be life-threatening if not often life-taking.Rather than being concerned with sexual opposition per se,Aguaruna myth, ritual, and song consistently emphasize the inter-dependence of men and women, and the mutual benefit that ac-crues as a consequence of male-female collaboration in all fields ofendeavor. This concern is consciously expressed in a variety of sit-uations, including the formal speeches that men give to their fami-lies in the early hours of the morning(cf.Harner1972:104-5).Mengain prestige by extending hospitality in the form of manioc beer,the abundance of which depends on the horticultural skill of theirwives.

Men bring their own knowledge, based on visionary insightsobtained through their more extensive experience with hallucino-gens and their long apprenticeship to the craft of reading the subtlesigns of the forest.The magical practices associated with hunting and horticultureshare this concern with sexual complementarity. Many of the meta-phors of hunting songs derive their meaning from the fact that at-traction between men and women creates conditions favorable tothe attraction of game. Equally fruitful results may come when awoman, singinganen,accompanies her husband during his searchfor a new garden site. Some songs call attention to the special dan-gers that come with the bringing together of opposing qualities.When a woman intrudes on the male task of felling trees, her futureproductivity may be put in jeopardy unless she protects herself bysinging songs such as A.5. Once the garden is planted, it is theman's well-being that is threatened-inthis case by the blood-thirsty manioc plants andnantagstones-soa woman takes pre-cautions to defend him. A man who takes his wife hunting mustmagically reassure the game animals that she poses them no dan-ger. Her presence then becomes an attracting force rather than arepelling one.Because the ideal, balanced union of man and woman in subsis-tence tasks cannot always be realized, magical songs construct itthrough the appropriate imagery. Songs create and safeguard thebeneficial complementarityof the sexes at the same time they cel-ebrate it in an expressive medium.The second pattern of imagery prominent in garden magic isrelated to blood and blood taking. Why should blood imagery beimportant in so bloodless an activity as gardening, when it scarcelyfigures at all in hunting, a pursuit that entails contact with realblood?The question is not an easy one to answer, nor did the Aguarunathemselves shed much light on it in their comments. In commonwith people in many other societies, the Aguaruna think of bloodas a life-giving substance intimately related to human vitality. Har-ner(1972:149)says that the Shuar see blood as a manifestation ofthe \"true\" soul, that is, the soul that people have from birth todeath. Although this does not accord precisely with soul beliefs inthe Alto Mayo, it does underline the connection between blood andlife in Jivaroan thought and helps to explain why \"blood drinking\"and \"soul eating\" are often used as equivalent metaphors. We havealready seen that hunting and horticulture, the quintessential sub-sistence activities of men and women, stand as paired opposites.128Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Many Aguaruna women say that menstrual blood ap-pears \"because a woman is going to get pregnant,\" in other words,because postpartum amenorrhea has ceased and a woman is againready to conceive (Margaret Van Bolt, personal communication).Menstrual blood is a manifestation of the mythical being Etse (notto be confused with Etsa, the sun), whom myths describe as anextremely seductive woman with a scent so magnetic that men can-not resist having intercourse with her (Akuts Nugkai et a1.1977,1:281-83).Alto Mayo women say that they menstruate because\"Etse cuts their wombs,\" causing them to bleed and thus restoringtheir capacity to conceive. Some accounts describe Etse as an es-sence or quality present in all women, Men who wish to avoid pol-luting contacts while on the vision quest must not look at anywomen they meet lest they \"see Etse\" and thus lose the chance ofhaving a powerful vision. Etse, then, is more than a mythicalbeing-sheis a female essence, at once attractive, fecund, and dan-gerous to men. All of these qualities are reified in menstrual blood.Women attempt to control their menstruation through an elaboratetechnology of fertility regulation (E.A.Berlin1977).The sanguinarythemes so prominent in Aguaruna garden magic are part of the fem-inine concern with regulating reproductive power through the con-trol of blood.Another property of blood is that it is the medium by whichthought is conveyed within the body. As it is used in the plantingprocedure, the achiote and water \"blood\" gives palpable evidence ofthe transfer of thought (in the form of gardening songs) that is tak-ing place between the gardener and her plants.The chromatic correlate of recurrent blood imagery is found inthe prevalence of the color red in garden magic. Women apply redface paint before entering the garden on planting days; the red dyeachiote is used to make the \"blood\" poured on the manioc cuttings;nantagstones are described as red, even though they often aren't;gardeners cultivate the planttsampaunum,which has prominentred fruits, to promote the growth of their manioc. There is an ob-vious connection between blood and the color red, but beyond thisit is hard to see how the prominence of red in garden magic fits intoa broader pattern of color symbolism such as that which VictorTurner(1967)found among the Ndembu.

Moreover, most Aguaruna recognizefive basic color categories (Berlin and Berlin 1975), which necessar-ily makes the relations between colors more complex than thoseobserved among the Ndembu, who have a three-term system. Otherethnographic sources on theIivarohave little to say about colorsymbolism, and Norman Whitten's interesting observations on themeaning of specific colors among the closely related Quichua(Whitten 1976, 1978b) are the only evidence that there might bemore to this subject than met my eye in the Alto Mayo.Manioc Horticultureas Practical SignificationFacing the sheer density of Aguaruna manioc symbolism, it is easyto think of gardening lore as being somehow independent of themore strictly technical aspects of horticulture. When talking to awoman in her swidden, however, one is reminded at every tum thatthese beliefs are not just quaint and expressive ideological tidbitsbut important calls to action.Earlier I noted that women customarily plant cocoyam, arrow-root, and achira in their gardens so that these plants will \"bringwater\" to the young manioc cuttings, thus helping the manioc growquickly without eating the souls of human cultivators. The practiceregisters an effect that is eminently material-theintercropping ofcultivars in the swidden. A cultural materialist might argue thatthe beliefs behind this practice are caused by and epiphenomenal toits \"real\" purpose, which is to maintain (through magical belief) asystem of polyculture that helps the Aguaruna adapt to their tropi-cal ecosystem. This reductionist approach, which is probably un-provable even on its own terms, founders on the principle of parsi-mony: why should such a belief, and the elaborate theory of maniocgrowth on which it is predicated, be needed to ensure the mainte-nance of a practice as simple as polyculture? Symbolists fare nobetter here. They would see the practice asasymbolic statementthat addresses existential problems and gives voice to the cultiva-tor's concern about her crop.If one sets aside the action/meaning distinction implicit in bothof these formulations, it is evident that the practice is situatedwithin a \"meaning-full milieu\" (Chevalier 1982:43)-a manioc pro-130Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

All aspects of gardenwork are equally part of meaningful horticultural practice.A different instance of the process of practical signification isfound in the manner by which new manioc varieties are introducedinto cultivation. Despite some statementsto the contrary (e.g.,Sauer 1969:46), recent research has shown that many cultivated va-rieties of manioc retain an ability to produce flowers and fruits withviable seeds. They may cross freely with other varieties of culti-vated manioc or with different species of the genusManihot.Intheir definitive taxonomic study of the genus, David Rogers and S.G. Appan (1973:34) remark:Wherever the species[Manihot esculenta]occurs (or has been trans-ported by man), there is evidence (putative) that the plants have hy-bridized with other locally-occurring wild species, thus changing thegenetic composition of the cultigen in such ways that the hybrid pro-duced becomes a cultigen essentially unique to the region where thehybridization occurred.Most ethnographic descriptions of Amazonian manioc cultiva-tion have nothing to say about the role of seed-grown manioc vari-eties, yet it is difficult to see how so many cultivars of manioc couldhave come into use if the plant were propagated only vegetatively, aprocedure that is in fact a kind of cloning.That manioc plants produce viable seeds is no mystery to Agu-arona women. They do not commonly plant manioc seeds for thesimple reason that their growth takes longer than plants propagatedbycuttings. From time to time, however, knowledgeable womenfind seed-grown plants in recently abandoned gardens. They saythat these plants (calledtsapak mama,\"grown manioc\") have thepotential to be highly productivevarieties.PWomen therefore takecuttings from promising-looking plants and cultivate them undercontrolled conditions, which from the Aguaruna perspective in-clude the use of garden magic. New varieties that respond well tothese procedures are incorporated into the garden inventory andpropagated like any other of the many manioc varieties that eachwoman has in her swidden.The Garden's Children131 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

In taking inventories of maniocvariety names, it was not unusual to come across varieties namedafter the woman who originally discovered and propagated it (e.g.,Urucinta mama,\"Rosinda's manioc\"). Young women could lookfor new varieties in their own abandoned gardens, and to some ex-tent they probably do, but they prefer to get them from olderwomen whose expertise in magic is widely recognized. James Bos-ter (1980:41) discovered an identical movement of new cultivarsduring his research with the Aguaruna of the AltoMarafion:Some of the older women took a special pride in their knowledge andownership of a range of different cultivars of manioc. The gardens ofthese women served as a source of rare cultivars for other women inthe community. Younger women tended to cultivate only the core ofthe most common cultivars andIsuspect would be likely to treat amanioc volunteer as just another weed.The movement of new varieties between women even ties intothe network of regional trade. The Aguaruna of the Alto Mayo saythat the Aguaruna of the Alto Marafion have greater knowledge ofmagic, especially garden magic. In their contacts with kinswomenfrom tributaries of theMarafion,Alto Mayo women try to obtain(by purchase or trade) new varieties of medicinal and food plants,including manioc, in part because they believe that theMarafionwomen's superior magic inevitably produces better plants. Varietiesfrom the Chayahuita Indians, a distant Cahuapana-speaking group,are still more highly valued.From the Aguaruna perspective, then, new varieties of maniocare foundbywomen of acknowledged expertise in magic and even-tually make their way into the gardens of less knowledgeablewomen. From the analyst's point of view, new varieties of maniocoriginate through cross-pollination in abandoned gardens, are se-lected by women with superior technical proficiency, and are thendisseminated to other households and eventually to other regions.The system of expertise in magic that underlies this pattern con-tributes to the continual assimilation of new genetic material intothe garden, with obvious adaptive benefits. While this fact does notin any sense account for the existence of garden magic, it does dem-onstrate the degree to which the interpenetrationof magic andtechnology constitutesa meaningful and successful form of foodproduction.132Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Afterall, the Aguaruna see the world of plants and animals as an emi-nently social domain. The extension of control from this realm tothe human one is probably inevitable. The Aguaruna technology ofsentimentdiffers from the other forms of magic that I have dis-cussed in one important respect-itsmoral ambiguity. Successfulhunting or gardening benefits the community even as it rewards thehunter or cultivator; covert manipulationof people, particularlywhere sexual matters are concerned, can threaten the foundationsof social life and take the actor perilously close to the frontiers ofsorcery.Male-Female RelationsTo understand the secret manipulation of sentiments, we must firstconsider Aguaruna attitudes toward courtship, sexuality, and mar-riage-areasrife with contradictions.From one perspective, it isundeniable that traditional lore stresses the threat that sexual activ-ity can pose to the well-being of men and, to a lesser extent, ofwomen. Young men anxious to obtain a vision from anaititapspiritare enjoined to observe the strictest sexual purity, since the taint ofsexual pollution is anathema to the spirits. A myth explains thatlong ago a certain man who failed to remain chaste actually becamepregnant. He was forced to endure the mockery of the entire villageuntil anaititapremoved the fetus (which, the myth implies, wasnot a true child but a reified form of pollution) and granted him apowerful vision. Other myths recount cases of men losing specialskills or powers when they succumbed to feminine charms. Todaythe Aguaruna continue to insist that for both sexes abstinence fromintercourse is essential for recovery from a serious illness.Despite this current of thought emphasizing the dangers of sex-uality, the Aguaruna regard sexual adventures as exciting and highlydesirable. In private conversations men often joke about their hid-den paramoursijapaampuya,\"little deer\") in other communities,and during parties they freely sing joking songs of an overtly sexualnature. This kind of humor is not unlike the proverbial locker roomconversation of American males, except that the Aguaruna aremore imaginative in their use of metaphor. Though typically morereserved than men, women also share a ribald sense of humor thatis given fullest expression during drinking parties. When talkingabout sexual relations in general terms, then, both men and womenexpress the view that sex is enjoyable and relatively harmless ifpursued in the proper manner.134Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Sexualliai-sons often lead to social conflict when they become public knowl-edge. Incest and adulterous relations with the spouses of close kincause the greatest uproar, but even unions considered proper-say,between unmarried people who are classified as opposite sex cross-cousins-mayprovoke discord. I suspect that this stems in partfrom the conflict between the desire of men to dispose of theirdaughters in marriage as they see fit and the desire of daughters tomarry whom they please. The secrecy in which affairs must be con-ducted thus requires that meetings between lovers be brief and spo-radic, taking place at night or in some secluded spot during daylighthours.KayapIiukam, my closest confidant in Huascayacu, took itupon himself one evening to tutor me in the art of seducing women.He assumed, no doubt, that after five months of celibate life in thevillage I was sorely in need of feminine company. Kayap set out toteach me the proper manner of approaching Soledad, a youngwidow who at that time was considered the most desirable unat-tached woman in the community:Listen, Mayak, I'll explain how you make her your sweetheart. Firstyou should go to her house during the day when nobody else isaround. You just start to talk. \"Sister, are you home? Can I come in fora while? Will you serve me beer?\" [HereKayap'svoice dropped fromthe forceful style typical of men's public speech to an ingratiating, al-most wheedling tone.] You talk for a while like that, and if she smilesand seems friendly you say something like \"Woman, I think aboutyou all the time.\" You can give her a small present, too, maybe a ring,some beads, or a little bit of money. If she doesn't get mad or leave thehouse, you know that she likes you.Now here's the tricky part. You ask her to let you into the houselate at night or before dawn, when everyone's asleep, so that you cantalk some more. Then you slip into the house and speak to her quietlyon her bed.Ifshe wants you, she'll offer to come outside to meet youin some quiet spot, maybe in her garden. If anyone asks her whereshe's going, she'll say she's got to urinate. So you make love, then gethome before people wake up. Now she's yourpaki,your girlfriend. It'seasy.AsKayap'slesson suggests, men are expected to take the initia-tive in amorous affairs, but women sometimes become openly flir-tatious during parties, and they make themselves more alluring bywearing strands of aromatic seeds and scented packets fashionedfrom vanilla pods.A Technology of Sentiment135 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

By eloping, the couplehopes to circumvent objections to the marriage by presenting it asa fait accompli. Parents raise objections to marriages for one ormore of the following reasons:(1)the partners are very young andstill partially dependent on their older kinsmen,(2)they are not ina marriageable relation to one another,(3)their families do not en-joy good relations, (4) either partner is considered lazy or dissoluteby the other's family, or(5)the father of the bride wants his daugh-ter to wed another man more to his liking. An eloping couplespends several days hiding in the forest, in a mestizo town, or in thehome of sympathetic kinsmen in another community. Eventually,they return to the woman's home, and a meeting is called to rec-oncile the differences among the concerned parties. Lovers alwaysclaim that they eloped because of their strong affection for one an-other; the woman may threaten to commit suicide if she is forcedto separate from her new husband. After considerable debate, theyare usually allowed to cohabit in the home of the wife's father, andfrom then on they are considered married. Only in the case of anirregular marriage between parallel cousins or some other prohib-ited category of relatives is there continued pressure for them toseparate. In time, even this pressure may diminish.The Aguaruna say that marriage is best contracted between bi-lateral cross-cousins (children of one's father's sister or mother'sbrother), although people with no established genealogical connec-tion are also free to marry. Data that I gathered in the Alto Mayoshow that the cross-cousin marriage ideal is frequently realized inpractice: 70 percent of all marriages are between people of the cat-egoryantsug,\"oppositesex cross-cousin.\"Of these, approximately17 percent are true cross-cousins, while the rest are more distantlyrelated in genealogical terms. A surprising22percent of the mar-riages that I recorded were between people of prohibited categories,usually real or classificatory parallel-cousins. I don't know whetherthis high incidence of incorrect marriages is typical of all Jivaroanpopulations or the result of the scarcity of acceptable marriage part-ners in the demographically isolated Alto Mayo region.'First marriages between people in their teens are highly volatileregardless of previous genealogical connection. Nearly half end inseparation after a few months.

Men can have morethan one wife-about15percent actually do-and,as an unstatedcorollary to this, married men are relatively free to engage in dis-creet extramarital philandering as long as they avoid having affairswith married women. The wives of these men, however, enjoy nosuch license. They are expected to dedicate themselves to their do-mestic tasks while avoiding even the hint of scandal. Men some-times punish their wives for \"visiting too much\" or even \"laughingtoo much,\" since visiting and flirtatious laughter are interpreted assigns that a woman wants to attract the attention of other men.Only elderly women-inparticular, elderly widows-cansocializeas freely as men.While custom dictates that men have the right to form polygy-nous marriages, in practice arranging them is a delicate matter. Awoman rarely welcomes the addition of a second wife to the house-hold. She may respond to the arrival of a new wife by attacking herphysically (cf. Hamer1972:95)or, more commonly, by threateningor actually attempting suicide. Sororal polygyny is common(62per-cent of all polygynous marriages) because a woman is more likelyto accept her sister as a co-wife than an unrelated woman. Evenwhen plural unions are successfully established, relations betweenco-wives often remain chilly. A prudent husband divides his timeequally between hiswivesto avoid domestic friction.Besides the freedom to form plural marriages, men have muchmore leverage than women in ending marriages. Many divorces oc-cur when a husband rejects his wife because of her barrenness,sloth, or even simple old age. Women, on the other hand, find itdifficult to separate from their husbands when they are dissatisfiedwith their domestic situation. If a woman leaves her husband, hemay simply ask her family to return her; they usually agree to dothis unless he has treated her with the most extravagant brutality.About the only way that a woman can end an unsatisfactory mar-riage is to run off with a man from another, usually distant, com-munity. The Aguaruna consider this a serious crime, and both thewoman and her lover are severely punished if caught by the pursu-ing husband and his kinsmen.Anastonishing number of adult fe-male deaths in the Alto Mayo occur as a result of suicide, usuallyfollowing a domestic argument.\" The restrictions and insecurity ofthe woman's role in marriage undoubtedly contribute to this highsuicide rate.I hope it is clear from this brief summary that the area of court-ship and marriage is a turbulent one for the Aguaruna.

That the Agu-aruna themselves recognize the disruptive nature of sexuality is ev-ident in a set of written statutes-thefirst attempt at written lawsin the Alto Mayo-preparedby the residents of the community ofShimpiyacu in 1978. There are eleven laws in the Shimpiyacu doc-ument, nine of which concern the regulation of sexual conduct.The remaining two statutes treat such crimes as fighting and shirk-ing communalwork. Theft is not even considered significantenough to be mentioned in the community laws. Only witchcraftaccusations have as great a role as sexual pecadillos in disruptingvillage life.The Aguaruna thus see sexual activity as having some formi-dable dangers-metaphysical,physical, and social-butalso asbeing inherently desirable. Courtship is characterized by a strongnotion of sentimental attachment and an atmosphere of intense se-crecy. Marriage is a volatile institution within which men are per-mitted greater freedom of action than women. Married women arein an insecure position because they may be rejected by their hus-bands in favor of a younger spouse, and they have few avenues ofescape should they suffer from mistreatment.Magical practices related to courtship and marriage reflect theseconditions. Men are primarily concerned with soliciting the affec-tion and sexual favors of women. Women are more preoccupiedwith maintainingthe affection of their husbands and preventingthem from philandering with younger rivals. Both men and womenwant to avoid gossip that might implicate them in adulterous af-fairs; if their adultery is discovered, they are anxious to escape pun-ishment. For each of these concerns, there are techniques that se-cretly produce the desired end.Songs That Direct Human EmotionWhen the Aguaruna speak ofanen,the first songs they mention arelikely to be those that manipulate other people's emotions. For thesake of convenience,Ishall call this vast corpus ofanen\"romanticsongs,\" but it should be understood that not all of these songs areconcerned with romantic relations per se, and some are designed toquell affection rather than kindle it.People learn romantic songs in much the same way that theylearn otheranen:the receiver of the song memorizes the words andmelody after first inhaling tobacco juice prepared with the saliva ofthe song's teacher.

Rather, the thoughts andemotions of the recipient suddenly change to conform to those sug-gested by the words of the song.There is general agreement that women are much more skilledat singing romantic songs than men, \"because their voices are bet-ter.\" Men, however, can play their songs on the bamboo flute or,better yet, on a mouth bow calledtumag.The mouth bow, madefrom a thin, springy branch strung with a palm fiber cord, has aningratiating sound that is supposed to have a profound effect on theemotions of the woman to whom the song is directed, despite thefact that she doesn't hear it in a conventional way. When men playlove songs on the flute or mouth bow, it is sufficient for them tothink the words rather than to sing them aloud.Iwas unable to collect any stories explaining the origin of ro-mantic songs, but various ethnographic sources stress their link toTsugki, the water spirit. Stirling (1938: 109), for example, mentionsthat Shuar men sing special songs directly asking Tsugki for help inlove affairs. Romantic songs collected by Pellizzaro (1977) and Tsa-maraint et a1.

Love songsare thought to be more benign than other forms of amorous manip-ulation. The Aguaruna also consider them intrinsically beautifuland therefore worthy of public performance. The openness withwhich people share songs of love does not, however, extend to thosesongs intended to extinguish affection, which are among the mostsecret thatIwas able to obtain.The most straightforward romantic songs are those that cause amember of the opposite sex to be attracted to, or to fall in love with,the singer.

From my own observa-tions, men do worry about such things when they are away fromhome. Husbands of young and attractive women are particularlyrestless on extended journeys because they fear that their wivesmay be taking advantage of their absence to commit adultery. Onseveral occasions, I saw young men suddenly abandon a journey andreturn to their own community, saying that they were \"worriedabout their family.\" The men who continued on were wont to re-mark sarcastically that their departed colleague was \"worried aboutturtle heads,\" that is, other men's penises. These songs, then, playon the very real fears and discomforts suffered by men when theyare traveling without their wives.SongA.21begins by addressing the frogbukiui,which in theoriginal text is labeled with the esoteric termukataip.The womanwho recorded this song commented:The woman singing this song says to the frogbukiui:\"Change your-self into me. Take my tobacco. Become my soul. Go to my husband ina dream.\" The man will be unable to sleep. His thoughts will tumconstantly to his wife. He will think, \"Perhaps she has died. I shouldreturn home right away.\" He is filled with such desperation that hewill tum around and return quickly to his home.These observations illustrate the commonly voiced belief thatromantic songs act on people's emotions by secretly influencingtheir souls.Awoman who takes tobacco juice uses her intoxicationto enter the visionary world of souls and manipulate her husband'ssoul through the power of the song. His soul \"hears\" the song un-consciously, or perhaps in a dream, and this subtle influence altershis thoughts to conform to his wife's desires. In the case ofA.21,the woman's message is conveyed through the mournful croakingof the frog at sunset, which turns the man's meditations to thoughtsof horne.'Some wives know even more powerful songs that prevent theirhusbands from dallying with other women.Iwas told that the fol-lowinganen,a particularly expressive example of this genre, is veryeffective in keeping a man tied sentimentally and sexually to hiswife:A.22 The untamed agoutiTying with the vineyaisI fasten tightlyIn my vagina\"Tutu tu\" I domesticate itThe untamed mouseIn my vaginaA Technology of Sentiment143 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

The domestication theme is especially apt becausewomen are in charge of taming wild animals that their husbandsbring back from hunting trips. The song illustrates yet another re-versal of the equation culture/nature::man/woman, since here it isthe man (metonymically represented by his penis) who is controlledand brought into the regulated domestic sphere by the woman. In-deed, in contrast to the myths stressing the danger that female sex-uality poses to society, the romantic songs of women operate underthe assumption that it is the promiscuity of men that most threat-ens normal domestic life.Thus far I have discussed songs that magically influence a per-son's feelings toward the singer, but there is also a genre of songsthat attempt to manipulate feelings toward a third person, usually apotential or actual co-wife. The Aguaruna say that a woman whoknows such songs can successfully prevent her husband from estab-lishing a polygynous marriage; he suddenly loses interest in hisnew love and contents himself with his first wife alone. The im-agery of these anti-love songs is quite malevolent, the prospectiveco-wife being equated with a dangerous viper, a flea-ridden dog, ademon, or some other undesirable creature.Ihad considerabledifficultyin obtainingrecordingsof thesesongs of loathing, apparently because women feared thatImightbring their knowledge to public attention.

To use this song, he said,one chews a wad of tobacco, digs a shallow hole, and then poundsthe tobacco into the hole with a stick while singing, this last actionbeing echoed in the song by the onomatopoeic refrain \"te te.\" Sam-uel added that the tobacco \"becomes the anger\" of the aggrievedparty; this anger is then pulled into the earth by the \"red worm\"(kapa nampich)and thus neutralized. The \"new anger\" mentionedin the song is an allusion to the belief that recent anger is morerancorous than anger that is \"old\" or partially forgotten. The song'ssecond stanza asserts that the cuckolded husband's anger will burstand disappear just as the seeds of the papaya scatter when the fruitfalls to the ground.When caught in an adulterous situation, people rarely have timeto perform the sort of acts associated with A.27, or even to singanger-dissipatinganenaloud after taking tobacco in the forest.

She died after drinking poison, but not beforetelling her family about the charm, the existence of which she hadsomehow divined. Her family held the man responsible for the sui-cide. There was serious talk of a vengeance raid, but the principalslater resolved the dispute through a cash payment by the man to thegirl's father.Case2. A man was accused of having loaned apusagkito a youngerbrother-in-law who subsequently shot himself. The dead man's fatherargued that the power of the charm had deranged his son and therebycaused his suicide. The accused denied that he had either owned orloaned a love charm. At a public gathering, he produced a huntingcharm that he owned but insisted that it had no effect on women. Be-cause the accusers could not establish that a love charm had been in-volved' there was no definitive resolution of the dispute.In both instancesapusagkiwas held responsible for suicidalbehavior, in the first case by a woman who had been the object ofthe charm's power and in the second by a man who had simplypossessed one. Another effect of the deranging power ofpusagkiisthat they arouse passion in a woman with whom a charm's ownercannot legitimatelyhave sexual relations (e.g., a real or classifica-tory sister) if she should accidently come into contact with it. Thefact that love charms are thus associated with incest, suicide, andsocial conflict leads most Aguaruna to state publicly that their pos-session and use are \"bad\" or \"stupid.\" Nevertheless,self-interestapparently lures men into acquiring them despite the risk.Pusagkiof ZoologicalOriginResidents of the Alto Mayo consider a.tooth of the Amazonian dol-phin(Iniasp.) to be the most powerful kind of love charm. Interest-ingly enough, few Alto Mayo people have ever even seen live dol-phins, since they are only found far downstreamin the largerAmazonian tributaries.The teeth are thus obtained by trade eitherfrom Aguaruna who live near the RioMaranonor mestizo mer-chants who traffic in resources from downriver. The price of a singletooth is said to be high; in 1976-78 the cost was about fifteen hun-dred soles each, the equivalent of ten days' wages.As Levi-Strauss (1973:200-201)points out, many Amazoniancultures associate dolphins with sexuality. Although the Alto MayoAguaruna have had few firsthand encounters with this animal, theyhold at least two dolphin-relatedbeliefs that shed light on the sex-ual power attributedto dolphin teeth.

A second be-lief is that the genitalia of the female dolphin are identical to, andmore desirable than, those of human females. People tell of menwho have tried to copulate with dolphins and found it so pleasur-able that they were unable to stop. A dolphin, caution the Agu-aruna, will take all of a man's semen and then all of his blood untilthe mandies.'Cetaceanssymbolizethe arousal of sexual desirebeyond the limits of prudence, a quality that is further emphasizedby their link to Tsugki. Tsugki once appeared in the form of a beau-tiful woman to lure an Aguaruna man into the depths of the riverin spite of his legitimate fear of the anacondas that lurked there. Asthe mythicalfirst shaman,Tsugki also representsthe ultimatesource of the powers used to manipulatehuman sentimentsandphysical well-being. The dolphin is thus the nexus of several dis-tinct properties:excessive sexual desire, unreasonableattraction,and shamanisticpower.The teeth of the otter(Lutrasp.) are sometimesmentionedaspotentialpusagki,though they are considered less powerful thandolphin teeth. The otter, like the dolphin, is conceptuallylinked toTsugki because of its aquatic habitat. Levi-Strauss(1973:200)notesthat in the mythology of the Americas the otter is often identifiedas an \"aquaticseducer,\" but I cannot confirm that the Aguarunashare this view.One man stated that the teeth of snakes (species not indicated)may serve a similar purpose.

Water, of course, is linked sym-bolically to Tsugki, but in this case the source of the liquid seemsto be far removed from the rivers in which the water spirit resides.Quite possibly, there is an underlying association between the liq-uid and the demons that inhabit such remote, rocky places. Thesedemons have formidable shamanisticpowers that they sometimesuse to attract and imprison women who become separated fromtheir husbands while traveling near the demons' dwelling place.Yukastones, mentionedearlier in connectionwith strategiesfor attracting game, can also be used to attract women. A speakerwho wishes to distinguishone type ofyukafrom the other some-times calls one \"game grabber\" and the other \"woman grabber.\" Aperson who discovers a pebble that he suspects of being ayukaestablishes the nature of its power by trial and error, as well as byattending to dreams and omens. The accountsIrecorded in the AltoMayo indicate that \"woman grabber\"yukaare most commonlyfound in snakes, fish, and aquatic mammals. One man, for example,stated that people encounter such stones in the entrails of the otter,while others named the dolphin, various fish, or an animal calledwagkatiim(possibly a kind of nutria), which is said to live in ornear the water. The following narrative, recorded by a woman, istypical:Yukaare found inside the fishmamayakor in the \"nose\" [mouth?] ofthe fishnaytim[Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps].If the stone is found in anaytim, the fish is not killed or eaten.

If a woman finds the stone and dreams of men,she should give it to her unmarried brother. She shouldn't keep it, be-cause it's bad.Some knowledgeablemen describe a technique for obtaining avery potent kind ofyukafound in the mouth of a snake.

One man did say cryptically,\"Snakes easily have sexual relations with women because they at-tract them with these stones.\" Yet I collected no tales of sexualcontactbetweenwomenand snakes, nor do other ethnographicsources stress such unions.\" Poisonous snakes are connectedwithshamanismin many accounts,however, since shamans may takethe form of vipers to bring death to their victims. There is also aprevalent notion that snakes are drawn to human beings in a waythat resembles the attractionof vultures to carrion. In chapter 2, Inoted that when a person is bitten by a poisonous snake, an impor-tant part of the usual treatmentstrategy is to isolate the patient ina shelter surrounded by four campfires in order to frighten off othersnakes that are inevitably drawn to the victim. Note that a similarsequence of elements is described in the account of how one stealsthe snake'syuka:one snake is killed and others are mysteriouslyattractedto its place of burial. Snakes thus symbolize the kind ofuncanny attractionthat a man wishes to exploit through the use ofa love charm.Likenantagstones,yukamay \"run away\" from their owners ifthey are not properly cared for:My brother-in-law once found a stone in the mouth of a snake.

A difference between the attractionsymbolized by thevulture and that sought through love magic is that the vulture isattracted to carrion for the purpose of eating it, whereas a man witha love charm seeks to become the attractor, filling the structuralrole of carrion while remainingthe predator with respect to thewoman he attracts. The shift from attractee to attractor is accom-plished by transforming the vulture to carrion or ashes, or both. Theherbal charms that result from this transformationgive the bearerthe same attracting power that carrion has vis-a-vis vultures.Love Magic, Hunting Magic, and the Limits of AffinityAguaruna love magic and hunting magic exhibit striking similari-ties. A single term denotes the stones used to attract game andwomen; the same herbs figure prominentlyin both kinds of magic.The Aguaruna often say that hunting charms \"make game fall inlove with a man\" in the same way that love charms make peoplefall in love with one another. Furthermore,hunting songs exploitmetaphorsof sexual union to reorder the relationshipof men andanimals to one of affinity. In both arenas men try to arouse a de-mented attraction-dementedbecause game animals and womenare made to lose their normal attitude of caution or suspicion. De-scriptions of the effects of hunting charms stress their stupefyingpower, which causes birds to sit tranquilly as their fellows are shotone by one with darts, or monkeys to abandon their usual warinessand approach a hunter. The effects of love charms are less stupefy-ing than arousing, but the result is that women lose all sense of160Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Thebearer of the love charm is similarly affected and easily descends tobehavior (e.g., fighting, incest, adultery) that prudent and straight-thinking men regard with contempt.The Aguaruna note two other negative effects of love charmsthat express the danger they pose to the social order. First, whencharms are used to secure a wife rather than a casual lover, theresulting marriage is certain to end in discord. People point out thatthe effect of the charm eventually wears off, causing the woman tolose affection for her husband. She is then drawn into adulterousaffairs with other men. Second, a wife obtained through the use ofa love charm will never be able to raise domestic animals with sue-cess.':' Clearly, the reason why the use of love charms is inimical todomestic tranquilityis that to fulfill properly and happily their do-mestic roles men and women must \"thinkstraight,\" somethingthat they learn to do through the accumulationof visionary experi-ence. When a man uses apusagkito acquire a wife, he prevents herfrom thinking correctly by bringing to bear deranging powers ulti-mately derived from Tsugki, the water spirit.

Now I shall seek a different vantage point, one that dis-tances us slightly from the ethnographicparticulars so that theirunderlying form may be discerned. To understand Aguaruna magicin any comprehensivesense, some loss of the \"experience-near\"perspective is inevitable. Magic is not, after all, a \"problem\" for theAguaruna. They feel no compulsion to explain it. Nor did I encoun-ter a gifted native exegete-anAlto Mayo equivalent of Ogotem-melli, Muchona, or Don Juan-whocould provide me with an in-sider's reading of the total \"system.\" My goal is to make explicitthe implicitassumptionsthat underlieAguarunamagic whileavoiding the temptationto explain too much or exaggerate the co-herence of magical strategies. As Rodney Needham(1983:90)notes,anthropologiststend to use overly mechanisticmetaphors to de-scribe local theories of ritual causality, models that imply a \"rigidityof outlook which is quite inappropriate to the subtle interplay ofideas\" characteristicof ritual. Aguaruna magic is not lacking insystematic features, but it also has its share of loose ends and am-biguities.In the introduction,I briefly raised the question of whether\"magic\" is an appropriate label for the phenomena I have set out toanalyze.

There is little evidence that the Aguarunasee magic as a discrete category of behavior. It is true that certainaspects of magic, such asanenoryuka,constituteseparable objectsor fields of expertise.Other magical techniquesare less distinct.Most of the avoidances I recorded came to my attentionthroughcasual references or observations rather than because \"taboos\" existas a marked category of acts.' As John Skorupski(1976:158-59)ar-gues, to assert that people see magic as a techniqueseparate fromtechnologywe must either demonstratethat there exists a genericterm roughly congruent with the Western notion of magic or, at thevery least, show that those who use the rites find something\"dis-tinctive, problematic,and bizarre\" in them.

TheAguaruna,like many other peoples,call upon several kinds ofagency when asked to explain the power of magic. Some peopleaccount for the efficacy ofatienin terms of soul manipulation.Byentering into a trancelikestate with the aid of tobacco, they say,one can \"speak to\" and thereby influencethe soul of the plant,animal,or person to whom the song is directed. A related idea,though one apparently restricted to the realm of the garden, is thatanenplease Nugkui, who then grants the singer's wishes by causingmanioc to produce in abundance(Chumap Lucia and Carcia-Ren-dueles1979:755).Very occasionally, the influenceof magical sub-stances is explained in animistic terms: they have souls or \"people\"who effect the desired result. In the Alto Mayo, none of these expla-nations is universally accepted.That the power of magic is perceived as being primarily derivedfrom supernaturalbeings can, I contend, be ruled out. Only a por-tion ofanenrefer to powerful beings, and this is usually to alludeto the being's legendary prowess in the task rather than to ask di-rectly for help.

Finally, all powerfulbeings are classified asaents,\"people,\" which means that despitetheir unusual powers they are ultimately as subject to magical ma-nipulation as ordinary humans.The major role of powerful beings such as Nugkui, Tsugki, andEtsa in Aguaruna magic is cognitive: they provide reference pointsaround which disparate associations are organized into meaningfulpatterns, which then provide blueprints for action. Here the workof Norman E. Whitten, Jr. (1976, 1978b) among the Quichua pro-vides some instructiveparallels. Whitten notes that the concept ofthe earth spirit Nugkui, the water spirit Tsugki, and a male forestspirit named Amasanga- are integrated by the Quichua into a sys-tem of \"paradigmaticimagery.IIThe relationsamong the threebeings and their various transformationsprovide a cognitive tem-plate by means of which the Quichua understand and act upon theworld. This system of paradigms, concludes Whitten, is used to\"heightenthe interpretivepossibilitiesof discrete observations byproviding multiple transformational,associational,allegorical, andindexical avenues\" (1978b:848).Much of Whitten'sanalysis is applicable to the Aguaruna inboth form and content.

These relationshipspro-vide direction for practical activity as well as for the interpretationof experience at a more abstract level.Having ruled out the supposed interventionof powerful beingsas a major cause of magical efficacy, we are still left with severalother contradictoryexplanations,none of which is adequate to thetask of explainingmagic comprehensivelyor reconcilingthe ob-served differences of opinion. Clearly, we must probe deeper intolocal notions of how human beings cause things to happen in theworld. [ivaroan ethnographysuggests that the idea of visions mayhold the key to underlyingpremisesabout the nature of goal-directed action. The Aguaruna consider visions to be a vital meansof elaborating a sense of self and developing ways by which the selfcan influencethe world at large. What can visions tell us aboutAguaruna notions of causality in the most general sense?Visionary Experience and the Direction of EventsPeople understandperfectly well that a shotgun blast or a well-aimed lance is the proximal cause of an enemy's death. Neverthe-less, when the Aguaruna were still engaged in warfare it was consid-ered foolhardy to enter into battle without having \"dreamed\" one'sfoe beforehand. The killing vision is a distant cause that makes theproximalcause possible.Life-giving(niimagbau)visions have asimilar role with respect to domestic accomplishments.The question of how visions exert this effect introduces a vex-ing issue of interpretation.Michael Harner's descriptionof Shuarkilling visions states that the ability to prevail in combat comesfrom the acquisitionof the soul of anatutamiaiut apin Aguaruna)during the vision (Harner 1972:134-45).The presence of this soulconfers upon the dreamer a formidable killing power. The Aguarunacase demands a different interpretation.People in the Alto Mayoinsist that the vision itself-theexperience of controlling one's ter-ror, facing the fearsomeaiiitap,and finally receiving its account offuture triumphs-becomespart of the dreamer. Indeed, the dreameris thereafterknown as akaiintin,\"dream-owner.\"My informants166Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Theaiiitappresents a detailed description of the dream-er's role in a future battle. Dream-seekerssing songs that ask theaiiitapto \"bring your little words,\" that is, declarations of victory.Immediatelybefore a battle, men performed a ritual declarationcalledkaiatigbau,\"dream telling,\" which seems to have had thefunction of renewing the imagery of the dream so that its powercould be brought to a fever pitch.\" The efficacy of the dream comesfrom suffering the deprivations required of the dream-seeker, stand-ing up to the terrifyingaiiitap,and securing a verbal description offuture triumphs.Theaiiitapis instrumentalin the process insofaras it provides a test of courage that the dreamer has to pass; it alsoacts as the vehicle through which the future is expressed. But it isprimarily the actions of the man, not those of spirit, that determinehis fate.By seeing killing visions in this light, we are better able tounderstandniimagbauor life-giving visions, which involve no di-rect contact with powerful beings. What life-giving and killing vi-sions have in common is an unveiling of the future in the form ofwords or images. Visions are thus the culminationof a campaign toenter the dangerous realm of the unseen world and, through im-mense personal effort, extract from it a specific kind of knowledge-bearing experience. The disciplined actions of the vision-seeker ul-timately produce images of the future, creating order where therehad previously been uncertainty.The ways that visionary knowledge can be used to manipulatematerial things are expressed in ideas about psychotropicplants.The Aguaruna consider the intoxicatingpower of the plants to beonly partially innate. It is given fullest expression through propercultivation techniques. Moreover, as a man acquires ever more pow-erful visions (hence greater knowledge), the plants he uses increasetheir potency, so they are sought after by others (Brown 1978).

It is also an exploratory procedurethrough which the humanactor learns about the world and ac-quires knowledge that can subsequentlybe put to use for practicalends.The premisesthat support the vision also apply to ordinarydaily activities. Physical acts are, of course, generally necessary andsometimessufficient to get things done. Nevertheless,the reper-toire of techniquesused to accomplish common tasks usually in-cludes a series of steps for creating a more demanding, pervasive,comprehensive,and multidimensionalorder than that which canbe created by technology alone. All of the major elements of Agu-arona magic-songs,medicines,power objects, and avoidances-contributein their own way to the constructionof this compellingorder.Creating OrderAnenoriginated in a time when the order that prevails today in theworld was created by mythical heroes. Tsewa, the primordial spidermonkey, was the source of hunting technology and huntinganen.Gardenanencame from Yampan, the wife of Etsa, or from Nugkuiherself. Both had prodigious knowledge of plant cultivation. Whenpeople performanentoday, they participatein a creative processthat was inaugurated by these mythical personages.Anenare ideallysung withoutimprovisationin melody,rhythm, or lyrics, which places them among the most formalizedgenres of speech known to the Aguaruna. Maurice Bloch(1974)identifies ritual songs performed by rote as an extreme case of for-malized language, one possessing great directive power owing to itsdisengagementfrom the give-and-take of ordinary discourse. To per-formanenis to focus one's thoughts,to impose a pattern on thefree associationsthat characterizeordinary mentalactivity. Allanenmake extensive use of metaphor and simile, assembling im-ages that are meaningfully related to one another and to the activitybeing manipulated.Anenare not characterized by directive speech.Few commands are to be found in them.

A.24, for in-stance, juxtaposes vultures, boas, vipers, and mangy dogs to causea man to feel disgust toward a potential second wife.

This reflects the Aguaruna beliefthat words can activate the things to which they refer.Iwas toldthat upon encounteringa jaguar or an anaconda in the forest,Ishould never utter the creature's true name lest this make it feelferocious and therefore inclined to attack. It is better, I was in-structed, to address the animal aspasun,a term that denotes some-thing vaguely menacing rather than truly life-threatening.The jag-uar, alternatively, can be calledyawaa,\"domestic dog,\" an obviousdiminutionof its proper name,ikatn yawaa,\"forest dog.\" Peopleavoid calling magical stones by their true names(yuka, nantag,etc.) because too frequentuse of the names may diminishthestones' power. Have the Aguaruna then fallen prey to what C. R.Hallpike (1979:409) refers to as \"nominal realism,\" the illusion thatnames have a special connection to the things they denote?To some extent, they probably have. Butanenare clearly morethan just a vehicle for the utterance of powerful words. The songsconsist of vivid images, sets of reticulatedconnotationsthat linkmythology, cosmology, and lived experience.Magical words un-doubtedly contributeto the efficacy ofanen,but they cannot ex-plain the songs in any comprehensivesense. On balance, the evi-dence suggests that the power attributed toanenhas less to do withwords per se than it does with words as indices of powerfully struc-tured thoughts. The myth of the origin of cultivated plants explainsthat Nugkui's daughter was able to \"call\" the plants into the gar-den. She did this not with special words, but with ordinary com-mands-backedby the knowledge(yachamu)that gave the wordsspecial force (Chumap Lucia and Garcia-Rendueles1979:380}.6The manipulative quality ofanenshares much in common withthe power of visions.

Visions andanenare attributed a palpable quality that distinguishes them from otherphenomena: they are both reified, referred to as \"things\" that havea life of their own. This reification underscores the degree to whichthe performer of anatiensees himself or herself as engaging in areal operational procedure rather than as performing a purely sym-bolic act.The role of material things, including charms, in the magicalmanipulationof practical activity parallels that of verbal imagery.Each object embodies one or more qualities that the magician usesto help create favorable conditions. Hunters, for example, find thatyukastones have an unusual affinity for certain species of gameanimals. By carrying the stones while hunting (or using face paintin which the stones have been immersed), a man juxtaposes theattracting power of the stones with his own.Analogical thinking plays a central role in the selection of manymagical substances. The roots ofwampushandmente,both con-spicuously large trees, are added to the mixture that women pouron manioc cuttings to encourage their growth. Men consume shav-ings of the penis bone of the monkeyyutapkiu(Cebus macroce-phalus)to cure impotence. As Robin Horton(1967)has pointed out,such analogies are not unique to magic but in fact figure promi-nently in all forms of thought.The power attributed to some substances is based on conven-tional, culture-specific meanings rather than analogical thinking inthe strict sense. A man who finds a stone in the entrails of a fishresponds to the discovery by considering the following culturalfacts:(1)stone is a rare substance that is attributed unusual powers,(2)this particular stone has shown itself to have special qualities byvirtue of having made its way into the fish's gullet,(3)the fishcomes from the river, the domain of Tsugki, and(4)Tsugki is con-ventionally regarded as the source of powers of sexual attraction.These facts lead almost inexorably to the conclusion that the stonemight serve as apusagki-i-econclusion that can, however, onlybe verified by preparing and then testing the stone in the propermanner.What is perhaps most striking about the preparation of magicalsubstances is the complexity of the recipes and testing proceduresemployed. Recalling the process by which a bird-stupefying herb isacquired (chapter3),we see a step-by-step series of actions that in-cludes close observation of the plant's effects. The rigorous, highlyordered procedure ultimately produces a substance that, when ap-plied to a blowgun, imbues the hunting implement with new mean-170Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

This meaning is powerful in terms of Aguaruna notions ofcausality because it expands the range of order surrounding the useof the blowgun.When constructinga desirable order through the juxtapositionof objects and images, it is imperativethat associationswhichmight generate undesirableconditionsbe avoided-hencetaboos.In this interpretation,I am in agreement with Frazer, who saw ta-boos as \"negative magic,\" beliefs based on the notions of similarityand contagion but directed toward the avoidance of harmful effects.The act of observing specific avoidances, of course, is in itself aform of ordering, since the actor brings an unusual degree of atten-tion to his or her actions. Here the insights of Bloch(1974)are againpertinent.Avoidances impoverish behavior in much the same waythat formalized utterancesimpoverish speech. By limiting the en-terprises in which people can engage and the contacts they canmake, avoidances remove the actors from the varied behavioral dis-course of ordinary life. Thus reduced in the ability to respond tooutside influences, their actions embody a kind of directedness thatadds still another dimensionto the ordering qualities of magicalprocedures.Aguaruna strategies for creating order contradict two bits of re-ceived wisdom about magic: first, the idea that magic is employedwhere technology fails, and second, the claim that magic is con-ceived by its practitionersin mechanisticterms, as distinct fromthe personalisticquality of religious thought. Although the first as-sertion is usually credited to Malinowski, it survives in more recentanalyses of magic. S.J.Tambiah(1973:226),for instance, resusci-tates this idea when he says thatmany (but not all) magical rites were elaborated and utilized preciselyin the circumstanceswhere non-Western man has not achieved thatspecial kind of \"advanced\" scientific knowledge which can controland act upon reality to an extent that reaches beyond the realm of hisown practical knowledge.Karl Rosengren(1976:674)casts the same idea in a slightly dif-ferent form. \"To the understandingobserver,\" he writes, \"[magic] isa constitutiveact applied to an unconstitutableobject when instru-mental acts do not suffice to control reality.\" Rosengren uses\" con-stitutive\"in preference to the term \"performative\"as employed byAustin(1962)and Tambiah(1968, 1973).The problem with thisargument lies less with the question of performativity, to whichIshall return shortly, than with the issue of how one determineswhether a given technology will, as Rosengren puts it, \"suffice toWorking Metaphors171 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Hunting magic is thus seen as aresponse to technological inadequacy. Yet how are we to deal withthe fact that the Aguaruna have developed elaborate forms of gardenmagic even though their 'horticultural system is extraordinarily re-liable? Love magic poses an equally knotty problem. Would Rosen-gren and Tambiah argue that the Aguaruna are less knowledgeablein the technology of seduction than, say, American adults, so thatthe former must use love magic while the latter needn't? The Agu-aruna case exposes the speciousness of the \"magic as last resort\"thesis. Like such concepts as \"carrying capacity\" and \"basic needs,\"\"technological insufficiency\" is a cultural construct, not an empir-ical condition.Aguaruna notions of order-production are mechanistic in thesense that they advance the idea that the actor can direct events bycontrolling pertinent variables. But the Aguaruna are not guilty ofthe simplistic \"if A then B\" determinism that anthropologists cus-tomarily impute to magical thought. The Aguaruna world is de-fined by possibilities and probabilities rather than mechanistic cer-tainties. Uncertainty arises because no one can ever possess enoughknowledge to understand and control every factor that touches on agiven situation. The magical universe is not passive but defined bya lively complexity. Even the most ordinary action-fetchingwaterfrom the river, walking through a garden-maytake a turn for theunexpected. Perhaps a strange being will present itself or a powerfulomen change a person's understanding of his situation. Immutablefacts often prove illusory: I collected numerous accounts of deadpeople who suddenly revived, and mourners frequently discuss thepossibility of such a revival before a burial. In a world where suchpossibilities exist, people attribute to magic a strong but by nomeans infallible power of compulsion.Is Aguaruna Magic Performative?Animportant claim of some symbolist analyses of magic is thatmagical acts and utterances-andritual in general-are,to quoteAustin(1962),\"performative.\" This position is argued by Tambiahin two influential essays(1968, 1973)and commented on, eitherfavorably or unfavorably, in subsequent work by other scholars.Briefly put, Austin labels \"performatives\" those utterances thatnot only describe an act but actually constitute it. Frequently men-tioned examples of performative utterances include marriage cere-172Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

The efficacy of performatives is not measuredby their observable results-inmost cases there aren't any-butbythe \"felicity\"of their performance,that is, whether the personmaking the pronouncementwas qualified to do so, whether theparties concerned were eligible to participate, and so on.Drawing heavily on Malinowski'sdescriptionof Trobriandmagic, Tambiah asserts that spells are primarily performative in na-ture because \"by virtue of being enacted [they] achieve a change ofstate, or do something effective\" (1973:221). What they do, appar-ently, is \"effect changes ... in terms of convention and normativejudgment, and as solutions of existential problems and intellectualpuzzles\" (1973:226). Tambiah's earlier essay on magic frames thegoal of magic somewhat differently. Magic, he says, serves to \"re-structureand integrate the minds and emotionsof the actors\"(1968:202). Thus the effect of magic is more akin to that of myththan it is to technology. Given their performative nature, magicalacts and utterancescannot appropriately be subjected to the samekinds of verification as ordinary instrumentalacts, nor are they tobe understood in terms of a logic of causation in a scientific sense(1973:223).This is not the place to consider whether the concept of per-formativity can properly be applied to all classes of ritual, althoughthere are strong arguments that it cannot (Gardner 1983). Insofar asmagic is concerned,performativityis problematicin several re-spects. Social convention determines the \"results\" of truly perform-ative acts. Through an African investitureceremony, a man be-comes a chief, provided that the proper forms are observed. Theceremony has \"worked\" regardless of whether that person turns outto be a good chief or a bad chief. An Aguarunapusagkicharm, onthe other hand, is ultimately evaluated in terms of the effect it pro-duces in another person. If the loved one fails to respond to thepusagki,the charm's owner wants to know why. Some of his ques-tions may concern the \"felicity\" of the procedure by which thepus-agl«!was prepared (Were the correct steps taken? Did thepusagki'sowner observe the proper precautions?) whereas others are directedto the efficacy of the charm itself. The Aguaruna realize that sexualattraction is a complicated matter and that it may be difficult toexplain why a woman resists a man's advances. This does not mean,however, that the contributionof thepusagkito sexual conquest isany less verifiable from the Aguaruna point of view. Tambiah ob-serves that the objectives of performativeacts are \"'persuasion,''conceptualization,''expansionof meaning'and the like\"(1973:Working Metaphors173 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Aswe have seen, these aspects of true performativesare evi-dent in Aguaruna magic, though from the perspective of the actorsthey produce palpable, material results, not ones based solely onsocial convention.\"It is no accident that symbolist accounts devote more attentionto speech acts than to procedures involving direct, physical inter-vention-forexample,the use of medicinalplants. For if thesemedicines \"really work\" in a Western scientific sense, they presentus with a riddle: if magical operations are strictly symbolic in char-acter, how can we account for their material effects? To say thattheir material effects are merely fortuitous is to replace the intellec-tualist approach (\"Magic is a flawed form of science\") with some-thing even worse-theimplicationthat technologicalinnovation isaccidental rather than the direct result of acute observation and co-gent thought. Throughoutthe long debate on whether the thoughtsystems of tribal societiesare \"closed\"or \"open,\" it is scarcelynoted that the most importantinventionsin human cultural his-tory occurred within a \"magical\"milieu. There must therefore becritical links between the symbolic thought characteristicof magicand the kinds of thinking that produce technical advances.Magic, Technology, and the Symbolic Power of the OrdinaryTo move beyond an approach that imprisonsmagic in words andsymbolic acts, thus artificially separating it from the material worldin which it is so firmly fixed, we must rechart the conventionallimits of symbolic analysis. There is evidence that this process isalready under way, as scholars finally become alert to the symbolicimplicationsof the ordinary activitiesoften ignored precisely be-cause they do not embody the exotic \"differences\"that are theusual stuff of ethnography (Ortner1984: 154).In these ordinary acts,the attentiveethnographercan find many of the exotic elementsthat were conventionallyassumed to exist only in the symbolicdomains of language and ritual. Language and ritual are losing theirprivileged status as the bearers of meaning.From this perspective, apparently self-evident facts can be seenin a new light. Consider, for example, the Aguaruna's view of West-ern medicine. In the field,Iwas constantlyconfronted by the Agu-aruna's high regard for modern pharmaceuticals.For many months,I took it for granted that their faith reflected the obvious superiorityof Western medicines in treating common afflictions. Close exami-nation of illness episodes, however, showed that this was quitewrong: pharmaceuticalsas they were used by the Aguaruna pro-174Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

In the 1970s, few residents of the AltoMayo, Indian or non-Indian, could avail themselves of professionalmedical care. They customarily purchased medicines on the rec-ommendationof kinsmen, store owners, or, at best, pharmacists,often resulting in the use of drugs that were inappropriate for thecomplaint under treatment. Only infrequently did Aguaruna fami-lies have enough cash to be able to purchase a complete course of aneeded medicine. As is the case elsewhere in the developing world,the drugs they were sold had often passed their expiration date bymany months.The ironies of pharmaceutical use in the Alto Mayo were poign-antly expressed in a funeral I attended in 1978. Next to the corpseof the deceased, a man in his late thirties who had apparently suc-cumbed to complicationsresulting from acute dysentary, was alarge pile of commercialdrugs of every description-drugspur-chased by relatives in a desperate attempt to save his life. There wasample reason to suspect that this bewildering mixture of drugs mayhave caused his death, or at least hastened it. Upon leaving the fu-neral, I happened upon a bereaved kinsman waiting for a truck thatmight take him to the pharmacy in Rioja. There, he told me, hewould buy \"sadness medicine\" for the women so that they wouldn'tcommit suicide in their grief.What at first seemed obvious is no longer so clear. Why arepharmaceuticalsperceived as better than traditional medicines ifthey are no more effective (and quite possibly more dangerous) inreal episodes of illness? Why do the Aguaruna have a higher opinionof Western drugs than do the physicians who dispense them?A myth explains, with droll ethnocentrism,that the fearsomediseases associated with the arrival of non-Indians were originallycreated by an Aguaruna shaman named Kushi, who unleashed themon thekistian,\"Christians\"or mestizos, who had murdered hisson. After suffering terrible losses, the clever Christians capturedthe diseases in bottles and invented remedies for each. Now Chris-tians control both the diseases and their cures. The apparent resist-ance of non-Indian children to the maladies that take so many Agu-arona lives confirms the Christians' monopoly on good health inAguaruna eyes. It is undoubtedly true that the efficacy of vaccina-tions, which the Aguaruna were quick to appreciate, contributes totheir sense of the power of Christian medicine.Christians also introduced a powerful symbol of therapeutic in-tervention, the hypodermic needle. Injections mesmerize the Agu-aruna. Hypodermic kits are found in every Alto Mayo village, wherethey are used with appalling frequency.

Community·leaders feel that if they can demonstrate they are \"using the land\"in a way that is obvious to outsiders, their land titles are less likelyto be put in jeopardy. One way they do this is by cutting fields rightnext to the highway so that they will be visible to the governmentfunctionaries who rarely leave the mobile shade of their jeeps.Ironically, the agencies that fund development projects in theMayo have advised the Aguaruna to follow a more conservativestrategy. The World Bank-financedPtoyecto Especial Alto Mayohas stated that it wishes to promote intermediate technology, water-shed protection, and ecologically appropriate agriculture in the na-tive communities.Many Aguaruna will have nothing to do withthis. The community of Bajo Naranjillo took it upon itself to pur-chase a bulldozer, which it planned to use to clear forest and divertstreams for an irrigation system-preciselythe sort of capital-intensive and ecologically destructive scheme that has failed else-where in Amazonia. Though it is hard to be optimistic about theoutcome of this strategy, one can at least admire the Aguaruna'sdetermination to make their own decisions and, if need be, to livewith their own mistakes.Economic 'activity is not the only arena in which the Aguarunaare drawing upon the resources of the non-Indian world. After yearsof petitioning, the Alto Mayo communities secured funds for theestablishmentof a secondary school in Bajo Naranjillo. Aguarunaevangelists continue to proselytize in some villages. A few Agu-aruna have converted to the Baha'i faith, and in 1982 the Baha'issponsored a conference that brought Navajo IndiansfromtheUnited States to the Alto Mayo to talk about their culture and theirexperience with Baha'i (Works 1982: 15).The Alto Mayo Aguaruna were touched indirectly by a strangeseries of events that took place in the Rio Cenepa, Department ofAmazonas, in 1979. The celebrated German New Wave film direc-tor Werner Herzog, whose movie credits include the AmazonianepicAguirre, the Wr·ath of God,arrived in Aguaruna country toarrange the production of a second Amazonian film,Fitzcarraldo.Herzog planned construction of a movie set in the village of Wa-waim, and apparently his initial negotiations with the communitybegan on a cordial footing.

Herzog also ran afoul of thenewly organized Aguaruna-HuambisaCouncil, whose right to enterinto the negotiations he reportedly refused to recognize. Preciselywho was most at fault in the affair-Herzog,the obsessed foreigndirector, or EvaristoNugkuag,the ambitious head of the Aguaruna-Huambisa Council-isdisputed by the parties concerned. What iscertain, though, is that Herzog misjudged the political situation inWawaim and failed to respond to it properly. On December I, 1979,an angry party of Aguaruna men burned the film set and sent Her-zog's crew fleeing downriver to Iquitos, never to return. (For detailsof the Herzog incident see Kirchheimer 1979, IWGIA 1979, Chirif1980, Brown 1982, and Goodwin 1982. The story of Herzog's com-pletionofFitzcarraldoafter the Wawaimdebacleis told in LesBlank's documentary filmBurden of Dreams.)This encounter took place far from the Alto Mayo, but its re-percussions were felt in all Aguaruna communities. Owing to theireasy access, several of the Alto Mayo communitiesare frequentlyvisited by foreign experts of various descriptions-anthropologists,agronomists, biologists, health-care workers, journalists. The Her-zog affair heightened the Aguaruna's suspicion of the motives of alloutsiders. Fear of foreigners assumed mythic proportions in the ap-propriation by the Aguaruna of the Andean belief inpishtacos. Pish-tacosare ghoulish killers, usually described as looking like gringos,who harvest Indians to render their corpses for the fat. This fat isused to grease the factories of North America or, in a recent versionof the story, to fuel the rockets of theu.s.space program. Fear ofpishtacoshas moved down from the sierra, doggedly following de-velopment projects throughoutthe Peruvian jungle. A group ofscientists involved in medical research among the Aguaruna wererumored to be taking blood samples to determine people's body-fatcontent. Similar stories circulated while Herzog's film was underway. One version had it that when the Europeans filmed battlescenes using Aguaruna actors, the Indians would be killed with realbullets.

And through it all, they remain convinced of the superiorityof their own culture. \"All the 'Christians' want is money,\" the Agu-aruna say \"and they lie and steal to get it.\"The fate of magic in the midst of such turmoil is uncertain.There has been a steadily growing demand for the services of Agu-arunaiwishinor shamans among non-Indians. Colonists seekingrelief from sorcery sent by envious neighbors travel considerabledistances to be treated by shamans. For them, Aguaruna healersrepresent the diabolical yet potent healing forces of the jungle.Other forms of Aguaruna ritual are not enjoying a similar ren-aissance. Visionary experiences, a crucial source of the personalknowledge that underlies magic, are remote from the lives of to-day's children. When they arrived in the 1970s, the bilingual teach-ers strongly discouraged the consumption of hallucinogens. Andmost people seemed to have agreed with this measure, for in theiropinion visions are first linked to warfare-somethingthey feelthey have left behind.What threatens magic is not a head-on collision with Westernscientific ideas but a more oblique impact with different social andeconomic realities. The demands of school make it difficult for chil-dren to spend as much time with their parents as they could in thepast. Young men pass their days in the rice fields or in town ratherthan in the forest tracking game. Women are more tenacious intheir commitmentto traditional knowledge, but if their subsis-tence skills decline in importance the value of their magical knowl-edge may dwindle as well. Still, it would be hasty to pronounceAguaruna magic moribund.Scores of observers predicted thatNorth American Indians would lose their traditional culture, andhistory has proved them wrong. Ideas that at one point seem ata-vistic have a way of reappearing in new forms appropriate to newconditions. The Aguaruna are firm in their sense of ethnic identity,even if they differ sharply among themselves about how best todefend it. Provided they are able to survive as a people amidst thepredatory forces of the Amazonian frontier, the Aguaruna will con-tinue to fashion their own distinctive view of the world.When parents express their bewilderment about the behavior ofyoungsters today, someone will occasionally suggest that they pre-pare ayahuasca so that a new generation of adolescents can get itsthinking in order through the search for life-giving visions. So far,the signal drums used to announce ayahuasca-drinking sessions lieforgotten and silent. The air vibrates instead with the sounds ofdistant traffic on the highway.184Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Only one of my assistantshad the patience to spend more than an hour a day on the gruelingbusiness of listening to the songs line by line, often many times insuccession. Once a song was transcribed, I often had to return tothe singer, or other knowledgeable people, for clarification. It wasnever enough to obtain a \"literal\" translation, foranencontain awealth of onomatopoeic or ideophonic words rarely encountered indaily speech. I then had to develop a free translation that capturedthe essence of the lyrics without sacrificing interpretability.I also discovered that because some of the vocabulary used inAguarunaanencomes from Shuar, Spanish, and possibly other lan-guages with which singers did not have great familiarity, there wasnot always a precise lexical meaning attached to each word orphrase. The wordshakaim,for instance, was translated by onewoman as \"the little boy who works in the garden with the childNugkui,\" by another as \"paca,\" a large rodent that frequents maniocgardens. It was only later that I learned of the central role that Shak-aim (a transformationof Etsa, the sun) has in Shuar myth; my Agu-aruna informants had never heard of this mythical being. A similarproblem arises with ideophonicwords-thatis, words that aremeant to convey an impressionof movement,sound, or smell.Since I rarely heard Aguaruna ideophones used in ordinary speech,I had to accept on faith the interpretationsof the peopleIinter-viewed. It is entirely possible that other Aguaruna-speakers mightinterpret them differently.

For a more detailed review of the literature on magic and the debate be-tween those who see magic as a cognitive process (\"intellectualists\") andthose who analyze it as symbolic action (\"symbolists\"), see Peel 1969, Sko-rupski 1976, Brown 1984a, and the essays gathered in volumes edited byWilson (1970), Horton and Finnegan (1973), and Hollis and Lukes (1982).Some recent articles (e.g., Ahem 1979, Weiner 1983) contribute implicitcritiques of the symbolist position, even if they do not confront it head on.2. The complexity involved in applying ethnic labels and determining thedistribution of ethnic groups in the Upper Amazon is signaled by the fol-lowing explanation of the status of the \"Mayna\" Iivaro, a group whose nameappears in the literature about Jivaroan societies. The information belowwas kindly provided by LuisM.Uriarte, who has spent more than a decadepursuing ethnographic research in eastern Peru:The Mayna Shuar ... are those Achuara who occupy the zone of theRio Corrientes, particularly its tributaries, the rivers Mancusari andPaantamentsa (Platanoyacu). The mestizos call these people Jivaro orMayna indiscriminately. They identify themselves as Jivaros in somecases and Mayna Shiviara in others. WhenIvisited this zone with someAchuaras of the Rio Huasaga (a tributary of the Pastaza), both groupsrecognized each other as Achuara and lost little time in determiningtheir kinship links. There were only a few linguistic differences be-tween them, and perhaps differences in pottery style. The interpreta-tion given to me by the Achuara of the Pastaza ... is that these peoplewere\"Mainia aents.\" Mainmeans riverbank or the other side of theriver. And the ending-iaindicates origin. ThusMainia aents...meansin Achuara: \"Achuara people who live across the river\"-thegreat riverPastaza orKanus(LuisM.Uriarte, personal communication).Elsewhere, Uriarte (1976:44) implies that the Huambisa are essentiallyShuar who happen to live on the Peruvian side of the Peru-Ecuador frontier.3. Whitten (1981: 122) takes strong exception to the idea of tribal boundarieson the grounds that they abet \"imperialistic imposition of internal colonial'order.' \" Since Jivaroans intermarry so frequently with other ethnic groups,(e.g., Quichua,Zaparo],rigidly defined tribal \"territories\" are meaningless.Whitten's legitimate concernsnotwithstanding,Ifeel that it is only fair toindicate to the reader the approximate location of the societies under dis-cussion.197 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Comprehensive bibliographies on the Aguaruna and Jivaroan peoples ingeneral are to be found in O'Leary 1963 andCarcia-Rendueles1977. SeeMundo Shuar 1984 for the proceedings of a 1982 symposium on Jivaroanresearch.5.Ironically, significant interethnic medical exchanges began to develop inlate 1978 as I concluded my fieldwork. Colonists new to the Alto Mayostarted appearing at the houses of Aguaruna shamans in search of cures forwitchcraft-induced ailments.6. With the exception of bilingual assistants, who were paid in cash on anhourly basis, I did not pay people for interviews, nor did they seek payment.Payment (usually in the form of trade goods) was made in exchange for per-formance of certain magical songs, however, since this is the practice thatthe Aguaruna follow among themselves. When staying as someone's guestat a village other than Huascayacu or Alto Naranjillo, I often gave the hostfamily gifts of shotgun shells and other goods.Chapter 1: Alto MayoNotestopages 35-451. The arrival date of the Aguaruna to the Alto Mayo was determined byestimating the age of the oldest living people actually born in the AltoMayo. I tried to cross-check this with mestizos who had first made contactwith the Indians, but their recollection of dates was no more precise thanthat of the Aguaruna. The date given should therefore be considered approx-imate. The Aguaruna may well have been exploiting the Alto Mayo as ahunting area long before they settled there permanently.2. The latter figure does not include data from three Aguaruna communitiesin the Department of Loreto that were issued very large land grants. Theland grant and population data on whichIbased my calculations were ob-tained from theAtlas de Comunidades Nativas(Chirif and Mora 1977).3. At the time of my return visit to the Alto Mayo in 1981, the Aguarunathemselves were citing a figure of fourteen hundred for the population ofthe Alto Mayo communities. Although I cannot verify the accuracy of thisfigure, it is certain that the population is growing rapidly because of ahighbirth rate and a steady flow of Aguaruna immigrants from land-poor com-munities in the AltoMarafion.4. During a major public meeting between Aguaruna leaders and govern-ment officials in 1977, one well-meaning functionary suggested to the as-sembly that a matter of \"highest priority\" was the rearrangement of Agu-aruna houses in straight lines around a central clearing or, as he called it, aplaza de armas.Given the urgent issues that the Aguaruna communitieswere confronting at the time, his listeners found the suggestion baffling.5.Inthe late 1970s, there was a Witchcraft-related murder in the Alto Mayo.The killing put several Alto Mayo villages on a war footing with commu-nitiesinthe Rio Cahuapanas area, the home of the murder victim. As far asI know, the score has still not been settled. Relations between the two areasremain tense.198Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Aside from the three comprehensive collections of Aguaruna myths cur-rently available (Jordana Laguna 1974, Chumap Lucia and Garcia-Rendueles1978, Akuts Nugkai et al, 1977, 1979), the interested reader should consultseveral shorter essays on topics related to specific myths. These includeGarcia-Rendueles1979, Bailon and Garcia-Rendueles1979, Berlin 1978,and Brown 1978.2. Some knowledgeable people in the Alto Mayo insist that the first shamanwas a man named Pugku. Interestingly enough,pugkumeans \"rapids,\" ahydrographic feature that is associated with Tsugki.Inthe Alto Mayo, I found less interest in Tsugki than has been reportedfor the Aguaruna elsewhere. Perhaps this stems from the prevailing hydro-graphic conditions; the deep whirlpools with which Tsugki is primarily as-sociated are not found in the Alto Mayo, nor does one see the aquatic ani-mals (anacondas and dolphins) most closely linked to Tsugki in Aguarunalore. Nevertheless, allusions to Tsugki continue to figure prominently inthe healing songs of shamans.3. Apajui figures in at least one myth (see Akuts Nugkai et ale 1977,11:222)in which he is paired with an Aguaruna named Kumpanam, The translatorsgloss Kumpanam as Compafiero, \"companion,\" on the plausible assump-tion that the name is a loan word from Spanish. Curiously, Metraux(1948:626) reports that the Jivaro recognize a high god named Cumban-amba. The precise connection between Kumpanam and Metraux's Cum-banamba needs to be sorted out through additional research.4. Iwas never able to determine to my own satisfaction whether the reflec-tion in the eye and the human shadow are indices of their respective soulsor whether they are thought to be the souls themselves. Neither couldIfindmention of the eye soul in other ethnographic sources on Jivaroans. Larson(1966:29), for instance, simply definesiwaiias \"the child of the eye (thehuman image that one sometimes sees in a person's eye).\"5. Although this illness category bears a strong formal resemblance tosusto,a well-known syndrome found throughoutSpanish-speaking America,Ihave no evidence to indicate that it is not traditional to Aguaruna culture.6. For a detailed analysis of the significance of intraculturalvariation in soulconcepts within a North American Indian society, see Merrill 1981.7.Other terms used to classify specific kinds of shamans includeuuk tun-chi,\"hidden shaman\" (i.e., sorcerer),yapu(a powerful kind of curing sha-man), andkukam(a powerful sorcerer, the term being derived from Co-cama, a neighboring ethnolinguisticgroup reputed to be well versed in theblack arts).8. 1have used the masculine pronoun in this discussion because Aguarunashamans are virtually always men. Women are occasionally accused ofbeing sorcerers, but1recorded only one case (regarded as highly unusual bymy informants) in which a woman functioned briefly as a publicly recog-nized curing shaman.Notes199 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

For an opposing view, see Beckerman 1979.2. The fact that the success of each individual hunter is unpredictable doesnot, however, mean that the Aguaruna suffer from a chronic shortage ofprotein. Berlin and Berlin (1977) found that the diet of the Rio Cenepa Agu-aruna meets or exceeds the minimumrequirementsestablished by theWorld Health Organization with respect to protein (see also Berlin and Mar-kell 1977). I saw no signs of protein-deficiencymalnutritionin the AltoMayo.3. Saliva and the act of spitting are important in many magical acts per-formed by the Aguaruna, and they also figure prominently in the mythicalconjurations of Etsa, the sun. A special kind of saliva, calledkaag,is themedium in which shamans reveal their spirit darts.4. One person said that thewiishambird has the habit of following spidermonkeys as they move through the forest canopy, but I could not verify this.5. The following comment by Karsten (1935:172-73) echoes this view:Just as the married Iibaro woman is believed to have a mysteriousinfluence upon the field which she cultivates, so she is supposed toexert a similar influence upon the hunting dogs confided to her care.The competence of the dogs and the plentifulness of game in the housethus correspond to the ability of its mistress.Hamer (1972:75) confirms Karsten's observation, while stressing the impor-tance of the woman's link to Nugkui:It is believed that the presence of the woman, through her connectionto Nunkui, will help the man have better luck, and she constantly (andusually silently) sings to Nunkui for success in getting game.6. The herbkunakip (Bonafousiasp.) is sometimes mixed with \"dog\"tsu-maikto further increase the dog's ability to follow a scent.7. In free conversation, the Aguaruna sometimes use the termstsumaikandpijipigas generic labels for any kind of hunting or love charm of botanicalorigin. It is possible, therefore, that the plant mentioned in this narrativemight be something other than a species ofCyperusorCarex.8. Beliefs about human exuviae can take the form of positive prescriptionsas well as avoidances. People dispose of their hair in the dense, above-ground buttress roots of the peach palm \"so that our hair will grow fast likepeach palm roots.\" Children's milk teeth are thrown onto the roof of ahouse while the parents say, \"Vampire bat, take this tooth and replace itwith one of palm wood.\" This diminutive rite makes the child's adult teethas hard as palm wood and as unbreakable as a bat's tooth.9. In one myth, Etsa converts bones into each animal's present-day formand decrees its characteristic behavior.

Young men at the beginning of their hunting careers are especially vul-nerable toshimpankamu.According to some informants, if a young mangives away meat from his first kill he can share meat from subsequent killswithout fear. But if his first kill isn't shared in this way, he should avoidmaking gifts until he is \"used to hunting,\" after killing perhaps two dozenanimals. One man remarked:My young son hasshimpankamu.He went hunting to bring backmeat for a feast. He lost his ability to find game because the meat wasgiven away to others. When he approaches, birds flyaway, animals avoidhim.Chapter 4: The Garden's ChildrenNotes to pages 97-1321. The rapid development of cash-crop agriculture in the Alto Mayo sincethe mid-1970s has changed this picture radically. Some communities haveexperimented with enormous (i.e., five hectares or greater) clear-cut fields,and there have been a few awkward attempts at mechanized forest clear-ance. As far asIknow, however, traditional techniques are still used in thepreparation of fields intended for the production of root crops.2. Boster (1980:47), who conducted an exhaustive study of Jivaroan maniocclassification, notes that it is exceedingly difficult to cite an exact figure forthe number of manioc varieties cultivated by the Aguaruna because infor-mants often disagree about the validity of a given varietal distinction. Anysuch figure, Boster argues, would have to be \"qualified by the proportion ofinformants who agree on the existence of the cultivars.\"3. Owing to the influence of evangelical Christianity, consumption of man-ioc beer has declined dramatically in at least two of the communities of theAlto Mayo. Aguaruna Christians oppose the use of all intoxicating sub-stances, preferring instead to drink an unfermentedbeverage made fromripe plantains.4. Brent Berlin (1978) has published a fascinating analysis of the transfor-mation of domesticatesto morphologically similar weeds in the Nugkuimyth. The myth mentions thattsanimtsanimwas created from manioc(tsanim)after Nugkui's daughter was mistreated by the children of her adop-tive mother.5. Swain (1981:107)reportsthat duckweedis one of the most productiveand nutritious species in the plant kingdom. The Aguaruna belief that feed-ing duckweed to poultry can improve egg production is thus quite accurate.6. Some women mentioned the existence of a special kind ofnan tagusedto make manioc beer sweet and intoxicating. This stone is reportedly keptin the large urns in which the manioc mash ferments.Inever succeeded inverifying personally whether these stones exist, butIhave no reason todoubt that they do.7.This procedure bears a striking similarity to the Shuar planting ritualdescribed by Karsten (1935:126-33). The rite in Karsten's account, whichinvolved the participation of several women, was performed when plantinga garden intended to provide manioc for a feast.Notes201 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Hamer (1972:75) reports that Shuar women instruct their manioc plantsto drink the blood of would-be attackers who approach through surroundinggardens.Inthis case, the propensity of the manioc to eat souls or drinkblood is directed to ends that are socially useful, at least from the point ofview of the household defending itself from attack.9. A few women mentioned other plants that \"bring water\" to the manioc.These includepina (Calatheasp., a plant that produces edible tubers), theair potato(Dioscoreabulbiieta,which has aerial tubers that are occasion-ally eaten), and taro(Colocasia esculenta,also edible). However, cocoyam,arrowroot, and achira were by far the most frequently mentioned speciesattributed this property.10. Harner (1962:269) says that Stirling's inclusion of \"Piribri\" (actuallypi-ripiriin Shuar, which becomespiiipigin Aguaruna) among Iivaro deities iserroneous. He adds:Piripiriis the correct term and refers to a plant which the Iivaro usemagically to cause rain to swell rivers so that their enemies cannotcross them successfully (ibid.).Idid not record this use ofpiiipigamong the Aguaruna, but various peoplementioned that when it is used for magical ends,piiipigsometimes causesrain as an unwanted side effect. As Hamer states, the plant is never thoughtto be a deity, nor is it consistently attributed souls or \"people.\"11. To do justice to ethnographic reality,Ishould point out that this malebias is tempered by countervailing customs and.institutions: a bilateral sys-tem of kinship reckoning, a pattern of bride-service, the absence of extremefears of feminine pollution, and lack of an overt preference for male off-spring. While far from egalitarian in gender roles, Aguaruna society has notdeveloped male chauvinism to the extent that one finds among some otherwarlike tribal horticulturalists.12. Boster (1980:40) reports a slightly different version of the same process:A second source of new cultivars is from volunteer manioc seedlings.According to my informants, sometimes manioc fruits in abandonedgardens fall into the ground and lie dormant through the period of sec-ondary forest succession. When the site is cleared once again for a gar-den, the seeds sprout and grow....Some women on finding a volunteer note its location and wait untilthe plant is mature.. .. These cultivars are called xyagkuii,\"x'sflower,\" or xtsapainu,\"x's sprout,\" indicating its origin.Chapter5:A Technology of SentimentNotestopages133-611. Anne Christine Taylor (1984:101) has found a similar rate of \"incorrect\"marriages among the Ecuadorian Achuar.

Data on adult mortality collected in the Alto Mayo in 1976-78 suggestthat the Aguaruna suicide rate may be ten times higher than rates reportedfor Western European countries. The majority of suicide victims arewomen. See Brown (1984b) for details, and Siverts (in press) for comparativedata from Aguaruna communities in the Alto Rio Marafion.3. The themes of Shuar and Achuar love songs found in Pellizzaro 1977 andTsamaraint et a1. 1977 tend to bear out this observation. That is, most ofthe magical songs identified as being women's deal with the affection oftheir husbands, whereas men's songs are concerned with arousing affectionin their sweethearts rather than in their wives.4. \"The wife sings her songs all the times that something is not going wellinthe home so that the matrimonial difficulties will be favorably resolved.With these songs, she sends souls, spirits, or animals to her husband so thatthey will strengthen in him the bonds of love or concern for his family\"(Pellizzaro 1977:4, my translation). Pellizzaro's comments refer specificallyto the Shuar.5. Istrongly suspect, but was never able to prove, that there exist bewitchingor cursing songs using even stronger language.6. Pusagkiis a phonological variant of the nounpusag.1 usepusagkiinpreference topusagbecause of its obvious similarity topusanga,a termwidely used in the Peruvian Amazon to denote love charms.Pusangamaybe derived from the Quechua wordpusatnuy,\"to attract,\" or it may be aloan word from Amazonian Brazil (Chevalier 1982:384, n.2). The Aguarunaalso refer topusagkias \"woman grabbers\"(nuwaachitaii.7. The tale of the blood-taking power of cetaceans is structurally similar tothe myth of Uwanchau cited in chapter 4. The propensity to drink humanblood seems to be a quality of many powerful beings and objects in theAguaruna world.Ihave heard people say, for example, that children shouldnot touch jaguar teeth because the teeth can \"drink their blood\" or \"eattheir soul.\" As noted earlier, the same is said ofnan tagstones.8. Similar bird substances used as love charms by the Campa are listed inChevalier 1982:385-86.9. Examples of sexual commerce between snakes and human beings inmythical times are to be found in Akuts Nugkai et a1. 1977, 1:281-83, andChumap Lucia and Garcia-Rendueles 1979:104-15. More prominent arestories of intercourse between women and worms; see Akuts Nugkai et a1.1977, 11:135, 143. Snakes do figure in at least one commonly used sexualmetaphor: the verbshagkuimat,which is probably derived from the nounshagkuim,terrestrial boa, is used in joking contexts to mean \"to have in-tercourse.\"10. \"[A]n important role is played by a small plant which among the Ecua-dorian Indians is best known under its Quichua namesimayuca,of whichthe Jibaro namesimaikais but a corruption .... The plant is used in differ-ent ways as a love charm; any part of it isbelievedto have a wonderful powerof exciting the sexual passions of the opposite sex when it is brought intosome contact with his or her body\" (Karsten 1935:214).Notes203 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Most versions of this formula for obtainingtsumaikorpiiipigstress theneed to cover the rotting vulture lest its powerful substance be taken awayby other animals. One man told me, \"The most dangerous kind ofpiiipigisthat of the vulturecbuag,because all sorts of snakes come to take away theplant. And if it isn't snakes, it's jaguars, pumas, or foxes.\" To prevent this,the vulture is covered with a gridwork of sticks, then leaves, and finallywith a structure of palm wood slats(tanish)securely tied at the top.12. I recorded another variant of this method of obtainingtsumaikin whichan otter is killed and burned instead of a vulture.13. The danger thatpusagkipose to the health of domestic animals is in-dependently confirmed by a Shuar informant's description of the prepara-tion of a love charm (calledmusap)cited in Pellizzaro 1978a: \"The elderssaw to it that no one had this charm, because the owner who was accus-tomed to touch it with frequency caused domestic animals-aboveall,chickens and pigs-todie when they came near him\" (295). The accountgoes on to describe the cruel fate that awaited those who abused the powerof love charms: \"Furthermore, its owner was filled with evil desires, alwayscorrupting him further; for bothering the wives of others he was murderedor killed by Witchcraft in the form of leishmaniasis or madness\" (296, trans-lations mine).Chapter 6: Working MetaphorsNotestopages162-771. Avoidances do exist as a discrete, marked category in Aguaruna healthmaintenance strategies, where they are referred to aswakemtai.These con-sist of foods that should be avoided to recover from specific illnesses.2. Whitten uses slightly different spellings of Nugkui and Tsugki, but I havefollowed Aguaruna usage for the sake of consistency.3. People in the Alto May disagree about the fate of the other souls belong-ing to men or women who produceaititapsouls at death. The prevailingopinion is that the eye soul of such a person, that is, the soul that normallyascends into heaven, would not be admitted to heaven \"because God doesnot want killers.\" The underlying assumption is that people who have hadaiutapvisions have used their power to kill many enemies.4.The only example of a Jivaroan dream revelation text that I have beenable to find is in Larson 1978:398-99.5. Rosaldo (1975: 178) observes an identical process in Ilongot spells:Bycombining rich and vivid imagery with a limited and formulaicuse of language ... [the magician] subordinates the natural world's di-versity to a simple and compelling conception of the world that he,through magic, cancontrol.6. Still to be reckoned with is the contributionof music to the power ofmagical songs. Although music is an important part of several manipulativeor therapeutic utterance forms-shamanistichealing performances beingthe most conspicuous example afteranen-Ihad little success in elicitingcomments that might clarify its ontological significance. The key to under-standing whyanenare sung rather than simply spoken may lie in two attri-204Tsewa's Gift You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.

Second, it has the abilityto call forth specific emotions.Ifa function ofanenis to alter the worldthrough the intentional ordering of the performer's thoughts and utterances,then it follows that the creation of specific emotions and the restructuringof sensory experience through song would contribute to the ordering pro-cess.7. To correct this flaw in the theory of ritual performatives, Ahem proposesa distinction between \"weak illocutionary acts,\" in which the performerintends no practical results, and \"strong illocutionary acts,\" in which theperformer \"regards considerations related to the effect of his act as relevant,intends his act to have certain consequences, and wants what he requests\"(1979:9). The Aguaruna practicesIdescribe here fall within the \"strong\"end of the illocutionary spectrum. Note that Ahem's modifications in noway counter the objections of Gardner(1983)to the application of the con-cept of performativity to ritual.Notes205 You are reading copyrighted material published by the University of Alabama Press.
