Although the Moche peo-ple had no writing system, they left a vivid artisticrecord of their activities and their environment. Theirart illustrates their clothing, architecture, implements,supernatural beings, and a multitude of activities suchas warfare, ceremony, and hunting. Although Mocheart gives the impression of having an almost infinitevariety of subject matter, analysis of a large sample ofit has suggested that it is limited to the representationof a small number of specific events, or activities,which are referred to as themes (Donnan 1975). Oneof the most provocative of these themes has recentlybeen identified on the basis of an extremely complexand detailed scene, painted on the chambers of sixdifferent ceramic bottles. Since the scene painted oneach of the bottles depicts a burial, we refer to it as theBurial Theme.The six examples of the Burial Theme are amongthe most complex representations ever produced byMoche artists. Analysis of these representations pro-vides a number of important insights into the natureof Moche iconography, the development of Mocheartistic canons, and various aspects of Moche ritual.Moreover, it generates some rather profound impli-cations about the potential of utilizing ethnohistoricdocuments to reconstruct the Pre-Columbian past.The six examples of the Burial Theme are locatedin various public museums and private collections.None of them was excavated archaeologically, andthus there is no good evidence of where they werefound, or of their archaeological associations. One ofthe pieces (Figs. 9, 10), however, is said to have beenfound at Huaca Moro in the Jequetepeque Valley.We were able to make a complete photographicrecord of five of the six vessels (Figs. 1–10). Roll-outdrawings were made of the chamber designs on thesefive, omitting the background filler elements, such ascircles and dots, so that the depiction would stand outmore clearly. Only two photographs of the sixth ves-sel (Figs. 11,12) were available. Drawings were madefrom these photographs, again leaving out the back-ground filler elements for clarity. Five of the vessels(Figs. 1, 5, 8, 9, 12) are in a remarkably good state ofpreservation; they exhibit no evidence of major re-construction or restoration. Some of the clay slip hasspalled off the chamber of the other vessel (Fig. 4),and thus a portion of the original design is missing.Although the paintings on these six bottles clearlyportray the same related events, certain aspects of de-sign, art canons, and composition are unique to eachvessel. By comparing the similarities and differences,we have learned which features are always shown,and which could be omitted or greatly altered by theindividual artist. Having the six examples has thusbeen crucial in deciphering the basic nature of theBurial Theme.The Moche style can be divided into five sequen-tial phases, defined on the basis of changes in the formand decoration of ceramic vessels. These phases arenumbered I through V, with Phase V being the latest.All of the bottles with representations of the BurialTheme are Phase V."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ActivitiesEach of the six bottles in our sample depicts four dis-tinct activities: burial, assembly, conch-shell transfer,and sacrifice. The key to separating the completedrawing into these four activities is the set of doublelines found on each bottle. These double lines are con-sistently used to circumscribe the four activities, andtheir importance to understanding the overall depic-tion cannot be overemphasized. To make it easier tovisualize the four activities, the roll-out drawing inFigure 2 has been separated into its four components,and each is shown individually in Figures 13–16. Sincethe four activities provide the basic structure for un-derstanding the Burial Theme, we will analyze eachof them separately.BURIALOne of the activities shown on each of the fivebottles is burial (Fig. 13). There are two major figuresin the upper part of this scene: an anthropomorphizediguana and an individual with lines on his face thatlook like wrinkles. These two figures have extremelyimportant roles in the Burial Theme. We will refer tothem as Iguana and Wrinkle Face.l Iguana has alizardlike face and a long pointed tail with serrationsalong the upper edge. He generally has a sashlike bagtied over his shoulder or around his waist and wears abird headdress. He almost invariably has an almond-shaped eye, which seems to be pendant from the bot-tom edge of his headdress.Wrinkle Face has a round rather than an almond-shaped eye, and the eye is not contiguous to the head-dress. He generally wears a short-sleeved shirt with astep design on the front. The shirt is cinched at thewaist with a long belt or sash, which terminates inserpent heads. He invariably wears a feline headdress.Iguana and Wrinkle Face are major figures inMoche art, and often appear together. Figures 17, 36–1 Moche artists depict many people with what appear to bewrinkles on their faces, and they should not be confused withthis particular individual. The term Wrinkle Face, as used inthis study, refers only to those individuals who combinemost, if not all, of the characteristics which follow.37 are typical representations of Iguana and WrinkleFace in fineline drawing.2 Figure 17 is a Phase IV rep-resentation, while Figures 36–37 are Phase V. Iguanaand Wrinkle Face are also represented in modeledform (Figs. 18, 19). Their representation in Moche artsuggests that they are specific individuals who fre-quently accompany one another, and who engage in avariety of activities.In the burial activity (Fig. 13), Iguana and WrinkleFace are using ropes to lower a long horizontal casketinto a grave shaft. The casket is shown at the bottomof the scene, and it usually has a face drawn on oneend. As will be discussed below, this casket conformsto the shape of wicker caskets that have been exca-vated in Moche graves, and the face may be a metalmask. A variety of grave goods surrounds the casketand extends above, between the ropes. In Figure 3,anthropomorphized birds are substituted for Iguanaand Wrinkle Face, apparently without changing thenature of the activity.In four of the examples (Figs. 5–12), Iguana holds allama with a rope. A llama with a rope around itsneck is also being held by Wrinkle Face in Figure 6.These llamas may have been used to transport thecasket and/or burial goods to the grave site. Alterna-tively, they may have been intended for sacrifice andinclusion in the grave.3 The animals in front of bothIguana and Wrinkle Face in Figure 6 are dogs. Thesedogs frequently accompany Iguana and Wrinkle Face,and probably were not sacrificed and interred.The details of the burial conform closely to what isknown archaeologically about Moche burial prac-tices. Some elaborate Moche burials are in deep, nar-row grave pits (Donnan and Mackey 1978; Strongand Evans 1952: 151), and lowering a casket to thebottom of one of these would have been practicallyimpossible without the use of ropes. The form of thecasket itself is reminiscent of some that have been2 The scene in Figure 17 is remarkably similar to one pub-lished by Lavallée (1970: Pl. 78a), from a bottle in the Dum-barton Oaks Collection, Washington, D.C.3 Many Moche graves containing llama remains have beenexcavated, indicating that the Moche people placed parts ofllamas in graves as part of the burial goods.6"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"found in Moche graves.

Each of these figures wears atiered item of attire extending down his back. Wewill refer to these figures as Net Shirts.The representation of groups of Net Shirts standingtogether in the same scene indicates that they are agroup of people who wear similar garments and per-form the same roles. It is interesting that Net Shirtsare not depicted in Moche art until Phase V. Duringthat phase they are found in only two contexts: in theBurial Theme and in tule boats. Almost every MocheV representation of a tule boat, whether realistic(Figs. 23, 26–28) or stylized (Figs. 24, 25) has a NetShirt inside it (Cordy-Collins 1977, n.d.). As men-tioned above, some of the most enigmatic of the buri-al goods shown around the coffins in the burial activ-ity are the oblong objects with lines across theirwidths. It is curious that the only representation ofsimilar objects in Moche art are on the torsos of NetShirts seated in the tule boats (Figs. 24, 25). More-over, the jars above the right side of the casket in Fig-ure 10 are remarkably similar to those shown in tuleboats (Figs. 26, 28). Possibly both the oblong objectsand the jars shown adjacent to the casket in the BurialTheme (Figs. 7, 10, 11) were brought to the gravesite by the Net Shirts who are shown standing to oneside in the assembly activity.Opposite the Net Shirts in the assembly are animalfigures. These are depicted either as natural animals oras part animal and part human, apparently dependingon the choice of the artist. It is interesting that, of allthe animals depicted in Moche art, only felines andmale deer are found in this context. All of the figuresin the assembly seem to be engaged in a ritual at thegrave site which is performed as part of the burialceremony.CONCH–SHELL TRANSFERThe third activity shown on each of the six bottlesin our sample involves the transfer of conch shells(Fig. 16). This activity is being conducted under thegabled roof of a large and very elaborate structure.The structure is approached by a set of stairs, suggest-ing that it is located on the upper part of a high plat-form or pyramid.Inside the structure is a major figure that we shallrefer to as Kneeler, because of his posture. The ap-pearance of Kneeler can vary much more than that ofWrinkle Face or Iguana. The only element that hewears on all six vessels is the crescent-shaped orna-ment in his headdress. By itself, the crescent-shapedornament does not constitute a means of identifyingKneeler outside of the Burial Theme vessels, since it isworn by many different Moche figures. Kneeler alsowears a tiered item of attire which extends down hisback and is similar to that worn by the Net Shirts.The tiered item of attire is replaced by a wing in Fig-ures 5 and 6, but, since the wing is also tiered, it maybe a substitute for the tiered item on the other vessels.The most distinctive aspect of Kneeler is his pos-ture. A kneeling posture is rarely found in Moche art.Inside tule boats, however, figures holding paddlesare frequently shown kneeling (Figs. 26–28).6In the Burial Theme, Kneeler is consistently shownreaching forward with one hand, which often holds aconch shell. Facing him on the stairway below areWrinkle Face and Iguana (Figs. 1–4), Iguana and aNet Shirt (Figs. 5–8), or a Net Shirt (Figs. 9, 10). It isnot clear whether Kneeler is giving the conch shellsor receiving them.In one example, Iguana wears conch shells in hisheaddress (Figs. 1, 2) and, in two examples (Figs. 1–4), Iguana stands in front of llamas that have back-packs filled with conch shells. One Phase V stirrup-spout bottle (Figs. 31, 32) depicts this activity in mod-eled form–Iguana wears a conch shell on top of hisbird headdress while leading a llama with a rope. Thellama carries rope saddlebags filled with conch shells,and Wrinkle Face lies on top holding a spearthrowerin one hand and two spears in the other.One representation of the conch-shell transfer (Figs.5, 6) is unique because a Net Shirt and a small gabled6 When a kneeling paddler is shown in a tule boat on oneside of a bottle, a Net Shirt is usually shown in a tule boat onthe opposite side of the bottle.8"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"roof structure are positioned behind Kneeler. Thesewere possibly drawn by the artist to fill the largeextra space behind Kneeler in this representation.Conch shells are obviously the focus of activity inconch-shell transfer, and may be related to those seenas part of the grave goods in the burial activity.Conch-shell monsters are even used to decorate thegabled roof in Figures 1–4. The representations show-ing llamas with pack bags full of conch shells (Figs.1-4, 16, 3 1, 32), and the large number of conch shellsdrawn in the background, suggest that considerablenumbers of shells are involved. Since both iguanasand conch shells are native to the coast of Ecuador,and not to the north coast of Peru, Iguana may havean inherent association with conch shells.The importation of conch shells from Ecuador toPeru is documented to have occurred as early as 900B.C., and appears to continue until the European con-tact in the sixteenth century (Paulsen 1974). Llamasmay well have been used as pack animals for trans-porting these shells. Unfortunately, we cannot de-termine whether the llamas in the Burial Theme wereused to transport the shells to the gabled structure, orare being loaded with shells from the gabled structurewhich they will then take elsewhere.The area beneath Kneeler in the conch-shell trans-fer activity is outlined with parallel lines, and there-fore it is possible that this area represents another dis-tinct activity. We have been unable to define whatthat activity is, however, and thus we have includedit as part of the conch-shell transfer. Small structuresare shown in this area on five of the bottles (Figs. 1–8,11, 12). The small structures appear to be miniatureor stylized versions of the major structure above. Intwo instances (Figs. 1, 2, 5, 6), a row of seated figuresreplaces a row of small structures. The seated figuresin Figures 5 and 6 are Net Shirts. In Figures 1 and 2they are probably females wearing long dresses andshawls. Secondary figures similar to the latter are fre-quently shown in Moche art, and are usually associ-ated with gabled roof structures.SACRIFICEThe fourth activity shown on each of the five bot-tles in our sample involves sacrifice (Fig. 15). It isalways located in the area above the conch-shell trans-fer activity. Although most of this scene has spalledoff of one bottle (Figs. 3, 4), and there is limited docu-mentation of it on another (Figs. 11, 12), Iguana andWrinkle Face can be easily recognized. Iguana holdsa tumi knife in one hand, and may hold a rope ofbirds in the other. Wrinkle Face stands nearby, hold-ing a spearthrower and several spears. On the far leftis a splayed, nude female, lying on her back, beingattacked by birds. On the far right is a group of birdstied together with rope. These are the same type ofbirds seen pecking at the nude female figure. In atleast four of the examples (Figs. 2–4, 7–l0), the ropeof birds is held by an anthropomorphized spear.Another feature found in the sacrifice activity is abird on a rack (Figs. 2, 5–10). Again, the bird is simi-lar to those pecking at the nude female figure. InMoche art, there are a number of representations ofindividuals tied to racks (Fig. 30). Frequently theyare being pecked by birds. Ethnohistoric sources indi-cate that this was a form of punishment used by peo-ple living on the north coast of Peru prior to Euro-pean contact.7The six vessels in our sample show the wide range ofvariation used by Moche artists in reproducing a fine-line drawing of the same theme. Although each of thesix vessels is divided into the same four scenes, many7 Father Antonio de la Calancha states that the native peo-ple of the north coast of Peru were preoccupied with stealingand that the punishment of thieves was a religious as well as acivil matter, as if property ownership were a divine right.Diviners were consulted and sacrifices were made to theMoon and to the constellation of Patá (our constellationOrion) to entreat their aid in finding thieves. When the moonwas dark, they said that it was in the other world, punishingthieves. In the constellation of Patá (Orion), the row of threestars (Orion’s Belt) was seen as a thief flanked by emissaries ofthe moon who were sent to feed him to the buzzards. Thelatter were represented by the four stars immediately belowOrion’s Belt (Calancha 1638: Book III, 553).9"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"elements vary from vessel to vessel. There are omis-sions and substitutions of both major figures andminor elements, such as background objects.A comparison of the details—such as the hands ofthe same figure—on the vessels in Figures 9–12 sug-gests that they were created by the same artist. Thesetwo vessels provide an unusual opportunity to ex-amine the range of variation on a single theme by anindividual artist. The two vessels vary in many de-tails. For example, the artist placed jars in the graveon the vessel depicted in Figure 10, whereas he drewthe oblong objects instead of jars on that in Figures 11and 12. In Figures 10 and 11, in the assembly activity,he replaced Wrinkle Face with another figure. Hedrew an anthropomorphized feline on the vessel inFigure 10 and a Net Shirt on the one in Figure 11. Inthe conch-shell transfer activity, the area beneathKneeler provides another interesting variation. Theartist drew small structures in this area on the pot de-picted in Figure 11, structures similar to those de-picted in Figures 1–8. On the vessel in Figures 9 and10, however, he filled the area with geometric de-signs and created a stepped dais similar to those inFigures 33–35. The range of variation between thesetwo vessels, and among all six vessels, would indicatethat the Moche artists were not slavishly reproducinga fineline drawing of the Burial Theme, but wereenjoying a degree of artistic freedom.ChronologyAlthough all six bottles with depictions of the BurialTheme belong to Phase V of the Moche style, onlytwo appear to have been made by the same artist(Figs. 9–12). It is quite possible that the five artistswere not contemporaneous, and that the bottles weremade at different times. A chronological sequence forthe six bottles can be suggested, based on the style ofpainting and the features of the vessel forms. The ves-sels, as shown in Figures 1–12, are arranged in that se-quence. The vessels in Figures 1–4 are probably theearliest, since the style of the fineline drawing is mostsimilar to that of Phase IV. This is particularly evidentin the depiction of the major figure, Kneeler, seatedunder the gabled roof. The Phase IV Moche artisticcanons for drawing a human figure have been fol-lowed by the artists, i.e.,a front view of the chest anda profile view of the rest of the body (Donnan 1976:24). In Figures 5 and 6, Kneeler’s chest is drawn inprofile (as are the chests of the two figures wearingnet shirts). In Figures 7 and 8, Kneeler’s profile chestis greatly exaggerated, and, in Figures 9–11, his torsohas been reduced to a U-shape.The depiction of the crescent-shaped ornament inKneeler’s headdress reflects the same chronologicalsequence. In Figures 1–4, the ornament is similar toPhase IV fineline drawings, but, in Figures 5–11, thetips of the crescent broaden. In Figures 9–11 the cres-cent assumes a shape which, although aberrant for theMoche style, is similar to the form of crescents de-picted in the Chimú art style, which succeeds theMoche style on the north coast of Peru. The way inwhich the hands are drawn on the major figures fur-ther supports the chronological sequence of the bot-tles as they are arranged in Figures 1–12.The monkeys modeled on the stirrup spout of thevessel in Figure 12 are additional evidence for itsplacement at the end of the chronological sequence.Modeled figures are not found on the stirrup spoutsof the earlier Moche phases, but are very common onlater Chimú pottery. In this regard, it is interesting toexamine the bottles in Figures 33–37, which are verysimilar in form to those in Figures 9 and 12, andwhich have monkeys modeled on their stirrup spouts.The vessel in Figures 3 3–3 5 is particularly interestingsince the drawing on its chamber shows Iguana andWrinkle Face lying in a prone position on top of astepped platform. A nearly identical representation isfound on several double-spout-and-bridge bottles,painted with polychrome slip, and generally thoughtto postdate the end of the Moche style.8 Figure 38illustrates one of these vessels, and Figure 39 showsthe roll-out of the drawing on its chamber. The two8 One bottle of this type has been discussed in detail byJohn H. Rowe (1942).10"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"figures on these double-spout-and-bridge bottles canbe clearly identified as Iguana and Wrinkle Face who,in most examples, are represented with all of theircharacteristic features. The similarity between thedrawings on bottles such as that depicted in Figures38 and 39 and the drawing on the vessel shown inFigures 33–35 is evidence that the latter dates to theend of Moche V, as would the three similar vesselsshown in Figures 9–12, 36, and 37.From the chronological sequence of the five bot-tles representing the Burial Theme, it appears that theearliest (Figs. 1, 2) would date to the beginning ofPhase V, when the artistic canons for fineline repre-sentation were nearly identical to those characteristicof Phase IV. The bottles subsequently define a sequen-tial evolution in the representation of this themethrough what appears to be the very latest part ofPhase V, when not only has the fineline representa-tion greatly changed from its earlier style, but also thevessel form has developed features that are clearlyantecedent to Chimú pottery. The implications ofthis chronological sequence are very important. Thesequence, if reliable, offers a basis for dividing Phase Vinto subphases on the basis of both the evolution offineline drawing and the evolution of vessel form.Such a division would be particularly useful, since theend of the Moche style and the transition into theearlier part of the Chimú style constitute an extreme-ly important problem in Andean culture history, onewhose solution has been particularly elusive becauseof the inability of scholars to develop a reliable chro-nology.InterpretationIt is clear that the Burial Theme consists of at leastfour distinct activities: burial, assembly, conch-shelltransfer, and sacrifice. The artists who painted thebottles consistently used parallel lines to separate thesefour activities. Moreover, since Iguana and WrinkleFace are specific individuals, their presence in each ofthe four activities indicates that the activities are sep-arate events, which are not occurring at the same time.This suggests that the artists were depicting a sequen-tial narrative of the four activities.It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct thechronological sequence in which the four activitiestook place. There is, however, some evidence thatburial was the most important activity. First, thestirrup-spout bottle with monkeys modeled on thestirrup spout (Figs.11, 12) has both of the monkeysfacing out over one side of the bottle. Presumably,this is the front and most important side, and it issignificant that the burial activity is centered on thisside of the chamber. Second, examination of the bot-tles indicates that the burial activity was drawn on thebottles first, at least in its overall layout, and then theassembly section was added. Only then were the sac-rifice and conch-shell transfer activities painted, andthey appear to have been condensed to fill the remain-ing available space. The dominance of the burial andassembly sections over sacrifice and conch-shell trans-fer is particularly noticeable in Figures 7 and 10,where the burial and assembly sections occupy abouttwo-thirds of the available space.If burial and assembly are the primary activities,how might they have been related to the conch-shelltransfer and sacrifice activities shown on the oppositeside of the bottle? One explanation is suggested by thewritings of Father Antonio de la Calancha, a little-known Augustinian monk who lived on the northcoast of Peru during the early part of the seventeenthcentury. He wrote an account of the native customsof that area, which was published in Spain in 1638.In that account, Calancha states that, prior to the ar-rival of Europeans, curers (Oquetlupuc) were publicofficials of high privilege, and were paid a regularwage by the state. If a curer lost a patient throughignorance, however, he was put to death by beatingand stoning. His body was tied by a rope to that ofhis dead patient, and the latter was buried. The curer,however, was left above the ground to be eaten bybirds (Calancha 1638: Book III, 556).There is evidence that some of the curers in Moche"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"society were women9 (Sharon and Donnan 1974:52– of the long sequence of cultural development in Peru,3), and thus it is possible that, in the Burial Themeextending back thousands of years before Europeanrepresentations, the nude female being consumed bycontact.

No major effect on the art style,architectural pattern, technology, or economic rela-tionships can be attributed to any outside influence.Many of the customs, beliefs, and religious practicesalso appear to have been maintained without signifi-cant change.It is known that oral traditions were kept by theInca at the time of first European contact. “Mythol-ogy, legend, historical romance, and history werehanded down from generation to generation in theform of long poems . . . which were learned word forword and repeated at public gatherings” (Rowe 1946:321). We know that there was a similar practiceamong the native people of the north coast of Peru,and some scholars have even suggested that it wasfrom the latter that the Inca obtained their interest inthe preservation of oral traditions (ibid.: 202).It should be pointed out that the Spanish chroni-clers, who recorded these oral traditions during theearly part of the colonial period, had little awarenessSince some of the information recorded by FatherCalancha was derived from oral traditions that hadsurvived from earlier times, it is quite possible thatportions of the information contained in his chroni-cle had been carried on not just for the period imme-diately prior to Spanish contact, but rather for morethan a thousand years! If so, it is interesting to con-sider what may have been the genesis of such a story.One possibility could be that, when a patient died, itwas common practice to kill the doctor and have thedoctor’s body consumed by carnivorous birds. Thefive representations of the Burial Theme, however,are so similar to one another as to suggest that all arerepresenting the same specific occurrence, rather thana generalized practice.It is more likely that we arewitnessing events associated with the burial of oneextremely important individual. On the occurrenceof his death and burial, a female, presumably a doctorheld responsible for the death, was sacrificed and herbody was consumed by carnivorous birds. Theseevents were commemorated by elaborate representa-tions in ceramic art. They may have also entered intothe oral tradition of the local people, who told andretold the story for generations.9 It should be mentioned that there is some archaeologicalevidence for the practice of killing females and placing theirbodies in, or adjacent to, the grave pit. The famous “Tombof the Warrior-Priest” contained two middle-aged femaleswho had been crowded in at the head and foot of the largecane casket (Strong and Evans 1952: 152). Another tomb,which was similar to that of the “Warrior-Priest” had afemale body on the surface of the ground above the burial pit(Donnan and Mackey 1978: 208).If there is a correlation between the Calancha ac-count and the Burial Theme representations, there is,of course, no way of knowing whether we are wit-nessing the burial of a real or a fictitious individual.Oral traditions frequently develop around entirelyfictitious figures, which through time take on an airof reality and are believed in by the people of subse-quent generations. Alternatively, oral traditions can12"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"develop around real people, and later be overlaidwith so much conscious and unconscious fiction, andcombined with so many alien elements, that the origi-nal facts cannot be recovered by any critical analysis.10Nevertheless, whether the Burial Theme represen-tations are showing an actual event or one that isfictitious, the event must have had a particular im-portance to the people living during the later part of10 For good discussions of the difficulties of using oral tra-dition to reconstruct historical events, see Forsdyke (1964)and de Vries (1963).the Moche Kingdom. We witness the impressiveburial of the principal figure through the art of theMoche. Whether real or fictitious, he must have heldan important position to have received such a dis-tinguished burial. The stories surrounding his burial—elaborate graveside rituals, offerings of rich burialgoods, the transfer of conch shells, and perhaps theunusual circumstances of his death—apparently re-lated an event that was important during Phase V,late in the Moche culture sequence. The six complexstirrup-spout bottles serve as testimony to the im-portance of this event.ADDENDUMSHORTLY AFTER THIS REPORT had been sent to thetypesetter, a seventh bottle with a fineline representa-tion of the Burial Theme was located. Since it clearlyrelates to the six examples discussed in the report, itwas determined that a note of its existence and severalphotographs of it (Figs. 40–44) should be included inthis publication. We are very grateful to ElizabethBenson and Anne-Louise Schaffer for making it pos-sible for us to add this section to the original manu-script.This bottle has three features that are not found onany of the other six. The first is the hole that perfo-rates the chamber from front to back at the equator.This hole was made before the bottle was fired, andwas built into the chamber with a tube of clay con-necting both openings so that liquid could be con-tained in the chamber without escaping through theholes.The second unusual feature is the pair of low-relieffigures placed immediately above the openings of thehole through the chamber. Each figure has a largerounded head with large eyes and mouth, a shortbody, and long arms and legs. Although it is notclear what the artist intended these figures to be, it ispossible that they were meant to be frogs.The third unusual feature is the fineline drawingthat covers the bottom of the bottle (Fig. 44). Thedrawing illustrates an anthropomorphized bird-war-rior holding a club and shield in his left hand andwhat appears to be a goblet in his right hand. In anarc around the head and shoulders, there is a series ofclubs and shields similar to those painted on the stir-rup spout of this bottle.It should be noted that each of these three features—the hole through the chamber, the modeled figuresin low relief, and the fineline drawing on the bottomof the chamber—are rarely found on Moche ceramicvessels, although a few rare examples of each do exist.The fineline drawing of the Burial Theme on thechamber of this bottle conforms in nearly all respectsto the other six examples, and is consistent with ourinterpretations as stated in the body of the report.There are, however, a few distinctive features thatshould be noted. The most significant anomaly canbe seen in Figure 41.The artist apparently lackedsufficient space to depict all aspects of both assemblyand conch transfer on this part of the chamber, andchose to omit Wrinkle Face from the lower part ofthe assembly section. He also omitted the double linesthat divide assembly from conch transfer on each of13"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"the other six bottles, although his use of the doublelines elsewhere conforms to their use on the otherexamples. Another anomaly is the stafflike object heldby Iguana in the lower part of the assembly section(Fig. 43); it is unique in having a face at the upperend. Finally, the oblong objects placed above the leftside of the casket in the burial section (Fig. 43) areunusual in being placed horizontally instead of ver-tically.With regard to chronological placement, this bot-tle would clearly be late in our sequence, and appearsto fit between the bottle shown in Figures 7 and 8and that shown in Figures 9 and l0. Such a placementis based largely on the inventory of grave goods, themanner of representing the body and headdress ofKneeler, and the scroll motif that decorates the ringbase on this bottle.14"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Fig. 1 Stirrup-spout bottle.
