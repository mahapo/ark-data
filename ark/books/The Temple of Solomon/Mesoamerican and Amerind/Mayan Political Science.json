I hypothesize that Classic (and also Preclassic)Maya geopolitico-religious organization was structured by Maya calen-drical science, particularly the intervals of approximately twenty years(k’atun) and 256 years, or thirteen k’atuns (may‘cycle’). By analogy withPostclassic and early Colonial period Yucatán, Mexico, Classic siteshosting the mayfor 256-year periods were capitals of territories inwhich k’atun seats rotated among other dependent sites. Portions of theelaborate ceremonies carried out when the Postclassic calendrical cyclesended and began anew can be recognized in the images and inscriptionson Classic-period carved monuments at Tikal, Guatemala, and othersouthern lowland sites. Mayand k’atun seats can be identified archaeo-logically by the erection of stelae commemorating k’atun endings andshared distinctive architectural complexes associated with the celebra-tion of these calendrical observations. In addition, the mayhypothesisprovides insights into the nature of rulership, ballgame ritual, and war-fare among the Classic lowland Maya.My interpretation of the role of the 256-year k’atun round, or may,inClassic Maya political history had its origins in several circumstances —most of them outgrowths of my own history in the field of Maya ar-chaeology — in which I found myself in the mid-1990s. The immediateimpetus for writing this book was a need to incorporate textual andiconographic information from the carved monuments around the cen-tral Petén lakes into an understanding of the Terminal Classic period inthe region. This began as a fairly easily delimited effort to establish theTerminal Classic terminus post quemof Proyecto Maya-Colonial’s in-vestigation of the Postclassic and Colonial period histories of the Mayain this area. As I inventoried the relatively few and poorly known latestelae and altars at sites around the lake basins, I realized the impor-00-T2963-FM 6/15/04 2:13 PM Page xv"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"tance of comparing them to the better-known corpus of late monumentsat Tikal.I embarked on this task during a time of rampant arguments about so-called segmentary states and endemic warfare in the southern lowlands.Having spent most of my professional archaeological career working atsites in the shadow of Tikal, I found the hypothesized existence of scoresof small, warring, weakly independent polities and segmentary states utterly improbable. I was convinced there had to be a better explanationof Maya political organization. At the same time, I began to questionwhether the “evidence” for endemic warfare could be as much a matterof epigraphers’ interpretations as empirical fact. And I also realized thatdirect-historical analogy has never been fully exploited as a basis for ex-plaining Classic Maya political geography, particularly in Petén. So Ichallenged myself to come up with something that seemed more rea-sonable. The result is this book.The past seven years have seen an unending series of revisions and ex-pansions of my earlier thinking, and I have had to review literature I lastread as a graduate student one and a half k’atuns ago. During this sameperiod, stunning advances in Maya hieroglyphic decipherments haveprovided desperately needed insights into Maya dynasties and dynasticpolitics while at the same time also — thankfully —“failing to discon-firm” my thesis, in the neutral terminology of statistical hypothesistesting. Continuing in this Popperian vein, and using the principle ofOccam’s razor, I believe the maymodel of Maya political organizationis the simplest theory that accounts for all the evidence, and none of theevidence currently available to me contradicts it. In particular, I havebeen gratified to see increasing evidence for, and archaeologists’ accept-ance of, centralized and regional-state models.Numerous colleagues have generously read and commented on ear-lier drafts of these ideas about the may,and their reactions were varia-tions of the following: “interesting idea, but calendrical ceremony wasmerely one device in a much larger toolkit that Maya kings could ma-nipulate to achieve their ends.” Maybe. I suspect, however, that the lin-gering reluctance to embrace calendrical models of political organiza-tion, such as the maymodel, is a legacy of reaction against much earlierreconstructions of Maya society. These reconstructions, advanced dur-ing the early twentieth century by Spinden, Morley, Thompson, and oth-ers, simplistically characterized the Maya as gentle philosophers and as-tronomer-priests, living in “vacant cities” and “obsessed with time.”But the Maya wereobsessed with time.

Ofsome 34,000 inscriptions in the CD-ROM database compiled by MarthaMacri (n.d.), 11,000 — nearly one-third — are dedicated to celebrating the completion of specific time periods (Hofling, pers. comm., Novem-ber 24, 2001). Does this not qualify as “obsession”— generally definedby dictionaries as abnormal or unreasonable preoccupation, fixation,fascination, ruling passion, and so on?It is unfortunate that the role of time and the calendar for the ancientMaya has so long languished in disrepute among Mayanist archaeolo-gists. Numerous scholarly and popular overviews of the history of time(e.g., Hawking 1996; Krupp 1997; Waugh 1999) have celebrated the de-gree to which astronomy, celestial cycles, and calendrical precisioninghave been major concerns of ancient kings and civilizations throughouthistory. As Waugh (1999 : 131) comments, “All the major calendar reforms of the past have been put in place by emperors, popes or po-tentates.” With respect to our current Western calendar, centuries of intensely debated modifications, from Roman times up to the mid-eighteenth century, led to the (re)naming of the months and the even-tual switch from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. In addition, res-olution of questions of time and calendrics often requires convening representatives from many political units: the present system of worldtime zones, for example, was established at a conference of twenty-seven nations in Washington, D.C., in 1884 (Waugh 1999 : 71). Given thecomplex history of some sixty calendars in Mesoamerica (Edmonson1988) and the ancient Maya’s demonstrable dedication to (if not “obses-sion” with) situating events within broader cycles of time, there is everyreason to assume that such debates and reforms and conferences wouldhave taken place among the Maya as well. Maya archaeologists, art his-torians, and epigraphers regularly pay lip service to the concept of Mayakings as “lords of time,” yet they have disdained to examine the deeperimport of this trope in an “if-then” experimental sense: ifMaya kingswere indeed lords of time, thenwhat would we expect to find as evi-dence of this in the archaeological, iconographic, and epigraphicrecords?In arguing the importance of calendrical cycling to the Maya, I antic-ipate criticism for appearing to ignore other aspects of Classic kingshipor for cramming everything but the kitchen bateainto these cycles.However, scientific parsimony, Occam’s razor, and many other points ofphilosophy of science suggest that the goal of a theory, model, or expla-nation should be to arrive at the simplest explanation that accounts forthe most facts. It is clear that diverse phenomena and events of Mayahistory can be explained by the model.

It does notdeny the salience of individual agency and decision making, or implythat Maya rulers were witless slaves to the turning of metaphoricalpages of a calendar. Rather, the maymodel acknowledges that cosmiccycling and quadripartition were not mere ideological furbelows of the Maya but rather fundamental principles that established and op-erationalized the “deep structure” of their material (terrestrial, socio-political) world.As I completed the final revisions for this book, I found myself expe-riencing a bizarre sense of channeling parallel universes. I have beenstruggling for the past seven years or so to interrelate Maya ideology andcosmology with what we ethnocentrically call “the real world,” the nor-mal, pragmatic, temporal interactions and concerns of humans andWestern civilizations: politics, government, social organization, materi-ality, and so on. Meanwhile, I recently finished reading an eerie sciencefiction novel1premised on many of the same data discussed herein: Thatis, the current “creation” of the Maya cosmos occurred on a day 8 Ajaw4 Kumk’u in 3114 b.c.,and this creation will end in less than ten years,on December 21, 2012, with completion of the thirteenth b’ak’tun(ab’ak’tun is a period of nearly four hundred years), unless it is saved by amodern incarnation of Hun Hunahpu of the K’iche’ Maya myth, PopolVuh.At the same time, I was reading articles in Science, ScientificAmerican,and other scholarly publications that have reopened discus-sions about Einstein’s general theory of relativity and the “rubbery” re-lationships between time and space, or “spacetime.”2A new scientifictheory of the cosmos envisions giant, flexible, parallel multidimen-sional “membranes” existing only millimeters apart; when they collidethe universe is destroyed and then re-created again. This model of theorigin of the universe is called “ekpyrotic,” or born of fire.

My decisions on how to handle these matters are outlined below.In general, I try to employ the orthography for Maya words that hasbeen accepted by the Academía de Lenguas Mayas in Guatemala, be-cause the research on which it was based and the primary site discussed(Tikal) are in Guatemala. However, Guatemalan archaeologists alsohave eliminated, in national publications, Spanish diacritical marks onthe names of sites, cultural phases, and ceramic units drawn from in-digenous languages. I have chosen to retain these markings and spellingsand use the spellings of site names as they customarily appear (or haveappeared) on maps produced in the United States by the National Geo-graphic Society.The above principles do not provide a solid basis for selecting Yuka-tekan versus Ch’olan Mayan orthography. The western and southernparts of the southern lowlands seem to have spoken and written Ch’olanduring the Late Classic period, while the northern lowlands used Yu-katekan (although this too is a matter of argument). The central area,from just south of the Petén lakes chain northward to perhaps the RíoBec zone, might have been bilingual in Yukatekan and Ch’olan. Indeed,the whole lowlands might have been bilingual. But given the likelihoodthat (1) Classic Maya inscriptions might have been written using a com-bination of Yukatekan and Ch’olan and (2) the south-central and partic-ularly the Tikal zones were not primarily Ch’olan-speaking, I have optedto use Yukatekan spellings.

Purists will shudder,but, for greater ease of reading, I use the English convention of sto de-note plurals.Numerous words in the Maya languages are used in the text. In gen-eral, they are italicized when first used and in roman type thereafter.Important exceptions are may(pronounced “my”), the Maya 256-year cycle, which is always italicized to avoid confusion with the En-glish auxiliary verb may;and way(pronounced “wye”), meaning spiritcompanion, which is always italicized to avoid confusion with the En-glish word.Finally, as much as possible, Maya dates reported here have been correlated to the Gregorian calendar using the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson correlation and the 584,283 correlation constant.xxmaya political science00-T2963-FM 6/15/04 2:13 PM Page xx"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"acknowledgmentsThis monograph had its origins in about 1995 as an effort to synthesizedata on the Late and Terminal Classic monuments of the Petén lakesarea of Guatemala.

All lackcompelling goodness of fit and insight into process.A more productive avenue for investigating Maya political or-ganization begins with the “direct-historical approach,” which inte-grates modern ethnography and indigenous lowland Maya and Span-ish commentary from the contact, conquest, and Colonial periods(roughly a.d.1500 –1800) with Classic period inscriptions. Together,these sources reveal that Maya political organization was structured byshort- and long-term temporal cycles recorded in their calendars, partic-ularly recurring intervals of approximately twenty years (the k’atun) and256 years (the may). Maya calendrical science, in other words, was notonly a system of precise and predictive astronomical calculations andrecord keeping but also the foundation or “deep structure” of their po-litical science. The key is deceptively simple: the Maya are “the peopleof the cycle, the people of the may.”Explanation, Analogy, and the Direct-Historical ApproachArchaeological epistemology —how we know what we know — is a com-plex intermingling of theory and empiricism, generalizing and particu-larizing, and deduction and induction, just as archaeology itself is an intricate blend of scientific and humanities scholarship. Archaeolo-gists are interested in explainingthe prehistoric past, particularly thedynamic but elusive processes contributing to social and culturalchange (Fritz and Plog 1970; Watson, LeBlanc, and Redman 1971; Ren-01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 1"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"2maya political sciencefigure1.1 The Maya lowlands, showing major sites.frew 1973; Hill 1977). Ultimately, what archaeologists seek are synthe-ses of descriptive and chronological data with causal mechanisms thatresult in satisfyingly conclusive — or at least minimally plausible —explanations of the events and processes of change in prehistory.Archaeologists’ interpretations of the past have their conceptual ba-sis in analogy and analogical reasoning. An analogy is a similarity thatpermits comparison, a relationship between the familiar and the unfa-miliar that increases understanding of the latter. Analogical reasoning isa type of inferential argument used in logic, linguistics, mathematics,biology, and many social science fields, in which “one thing is inferredto be similar to another thing in a certain respecton the basis of the01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 2"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"approaches to maya political organization3known similarity in other respects” (Random House Dictionary;em-phasis added). Simultaneously objective, subjective, deductive, induc-tive, and abductive, analogical reasoning invokes comparisons betweenthe unknown and the known on the basis of recognition of shared simi-larities or homologies in the relationsbetween things, not in the thingsthemselves.For archaeologists, the relations of interest are those between theform of artifacts or patterns of their occurrence and the human behav-ior underlying their use or associations. As a simple example, a sharp,straight edge on an ancient stone tool that is similar to the sharp,straight edge on a modern knife prompts extensions to other similari-ties, leading to the interpretation that the stone tool would have hadcutting and slicing functions like modern knives. Therefore, the archae-ologist calls it a “stone knife.”Analogical reasoning is far less straightforward when it comes to hu-man behavior because of the inconveniently intervening variables of human motivations, beliefs, preferences, social constraints, decisionmaking, and so forth. Consequently, archaeologists employ two kinds of analogies, general comparative and direct-historical (see Lyman and O’Brien 2001). “General comparative analogy” refers to broad cross-cultural correlations among artifacts, their functions, and human be-havior that may be observed widely throughout prehistory as well as inthe modern world. The knife example, above, represents such a generalcomparative analogy. A direct-historical analogy draws specific parallelswith historical or living peoples, particularly those occupying the samearea, where there might be continuities from the past into the present.From the 1960s through the mid-1980s, the proper use of analogy wasdebated in Americanist archaeology (e.g., Ascher 1961; Gould and Wat-son 1982; Wylie 1985) and the role of analogical reasoning —what onearchaeologist dubbed “the tyranny of the ethnographic record” (Wobst1978)—was subject to methodological and philosophical scrutiny. Thisdebate largely could be attributed to investigators playing fast and loosewith the data and selecting analogues that were inappropriate. Whatemerged from these discussions was dubbed “the New Analogy” andcalled for careful review of criteria for appropriate and inappropri-ate analogies. “Appropriateness,” it was widely agreed, is a matter of scientific parsimony, justifiability, reliability, validity, and especiallycontinuity.Continuity is key. The success of the direct-historical approach varieswith the degree of continuity between groups, including cultural (tech-nology and subsistence related), linguistic, temporal, and geographiccomparisons. To illustrate, in general, it is more appropriate to draw01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 3"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"4maya political scienceanalogies between the culture and behavior of the prehistoric Pueblo In-dians of the American Southwest and the modern Pueblos than betweenthe prehistoric Pueblos and, say, the ancient Etruscans, because of theconsiderable differences in cultural, temporal, and geographic circum-stances of the latter. Analogies become increasingly inappropriate —or, perhaps better said, are decreasingly credible as explanations — thegreater the separation in time, distance, societal complexity, and so on.In general, the more spatiotemporally removed and culturally general-ized, the less useful the analogy.The most appropriate, credible, and enlightening kinds of analogiesin archaeology, then, are specific rather than general, and are drawn fromknown continuities through the direct-historical approach. This processfor investigating culture (pre-)histories involves “working back into pre-historic time from the documented historical horizon” (Willey andSabloff 1974 : 108). Its advantage is the greater “prior probability” that agiven analogy is correct because of known continuities in the comparedcultures (Salmon 1982).What is the best or most appropriate source of analogy for explainingClassic lowland Maya political organization? My position favors the di-rect-historical approach (see also Marcus 1993 : 115), and thus I seek sim-ilarities between the Classic lowland Maya and their Postclassic, earlyColonial period, and modern descendants in the lowlands. “Most appro-priate” does not mean perfect isomorphism, freedom from error, ab-solute “truth,” or proof of a theory. Clearly circumstances differ be-tween the Maya in Petén (the modern political unit encompassingnorthern Guatemala) in a.d.750 and the Maya in northern Yucatán ina.d.1500 –1950. And by adopting the direct-historical approach as themethodological armature of my study, I am neither negating nor ignor-ing the usefulness of insights gained from analogies to behavior, events,and phenomena drawn from farther afield. Nevertheless, I maintain thatwe can learn more about Classic Maya political organization by work-ing back from the Postclassic lowland Maya than we can by beginningwith African chiefdoms or feudal Europe. (See Table 1.1.)What do the terms “political” and “political organization” mean?Anthropologists have grappled with this question for many decades, be-cause what constitutes politics or a political system in modern Westernsociety may be more elusive or opaque in non-Western ones.

Theorists such as A. R. Radcliffe-Brown (1940), M. G.

Roscoe 1993), and this is also true forstudies of the Classic Maya civilization, although the latter have beenamplified by analogy to modern Maya and readings of contemporaneoustexts. These texts consist of Classic period hieroglyphic inscriptions,01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 5"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"6maya political sciencewhich can be found carved in stone, particularly on upright monoliths(pl. stelae; sing. stela), wall panels, and benches, as well as on woodenlintels over doorways and painted on the walls of tombs and on poly-chrome pottery. These reveal some of the administrative structures andfunctions, including elite titles and mythico-religious charters, rituals,and sanctions, that maintained societal and cosmological order. But de-spite a high level of detail, these texts have yielded little informationthus far about processes in the “political” sector, about how and whythe system “works.” In the succeeding chapters I describe Maya politi-cal organization as it developed and was both structured by and prac-ticed through celebration of calendrical cycles. In advancing this argu-ment, I bring certain biases, viewpoints, and assumptions about theMaya, which are identified here.“Political organization,” as I use the term, refers to the hierarchicallystructured offices (or roles) of power and authority existing within, be-tween, and among polities and their elites, whereby decisions about in-ternal and external relations (including those with the supernaturalrealm) and allocation of resources (human, material, and ideational) aremade and implemented (see Kurtz 2001 : 22 –23, 31–38). In part becausethe present discussion, like most of those in archaeology, has a tempo-ral dimension, I find Roscoe’s (1993) essay on political evolution andpractice theory particularly illuminating. Roscoe articulates the recur-sive relations between, on the one hand, agency (of leaders or rulers), in-creasing centralization of political power, and demographic nucleationand, on the other, relations of autonomy and dependence among subor-dinates that are mediated by time and distance. He also departs from tra-ditional thinking by highlighting the role of ideology and “nonmaterialcircumstances” in political systems, an approach that is especially use-ful for my arguments about the role of calendrical cycles. The Maya rep-resent an unusually lucid example of these complex relations among individuals, institutions, and time — or, stated differently, between prac-tice, agency, structure, and cosmos.I believe the Classic Maya represent a state (rather than chiefdom)level of organization and share many cross-cultural similarities withother archaic states (see Marcus 1993, 1998; Feinman and Marcus 1998),such as four-tiered (rather than three-tiered) settlement hierarchies.There is, however, little consensus on what to call individual Maya “po-litical” units. The terms “state,” “city-state,” “nation,” “hegemon,”“kingdom,” “civilization,” “empire,” and so on have been applied atvarious times, but they carry considerable theoretical baggage that in-tensifies confusion. One alternative term is “regional state,” a spatiallylarge and socially complex political unit having one or more major pop-01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 6"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"approaches to maya political organization7ulation centers (Culbert 1991a:xvii). Another is “polity” (from Latin po-lis), a relatively neutral designator of an autonomous sociopolitical unit.“Polity” does not translate directly into Spanish, however, and someSpanish-speaking archaeologists (Lacadena and Ciudad Ruíz 1998) haveadvocated use of the Maya’s own term, ajawlelor ajawlil‘rule, reign’(and perhaps by extension, the territory?) of an ajaw‘lord, king’. Butgiven the accumulating evidence that the Classic Maya had a higher-order position above an ajaw, even this term is inadequate.The Classic Maya had a complex social organization with an elitestratum at the top. An “elite” may be defined as a “small group withinthe upper echelon of a society that exerts ideological, political, social, oreconomic power or any combination of these” (Culbert 1991a : xvii) or,more simply, as “those who run society’s institutions” (Chase andChase 1992; see also Yoffee 1991). Maya kings were divinely sanctionedand sacred; rulership was hereditary in certain royal matrilines and pa-trilines, or ch’ib’als(or perhaps through the naj‘house, lineage’; seeGillespie 2000b); and female as well as male rulers (i.e., “queens” as wellas “kings”) were recognized.Sources for a Direct-Historical Approach: A Critical ReviewFive sources of direct, historical, analogical information can be used to reconstruct Classic period lowland Maya political organization. Ofthese, the most direct and historical, yet enigmatic, are the ClassicMaya’s own writings, the hieroglyphic inscriptions. The remaining foursources — later indigenous Maya texts, Spanish ethnohistoric docu-ments, dictionaries, and modern ethnographic accounts — are moreabundant and approachable to modern readers but represent decreasingcontinuities with the Maya in the heartland of Classic civilization, theDepartment of El Petén. Discontinuities are both spatial and temporal,as these writings come from or refer primarily to the northern Yucatánpeninsula or the Maya highlands and are Postclassic or later in date.Classic Period Hieroglyphic InscriptionsThe Classic period Maya of the southern lowlands chronicled their “pol-itics”— the internal and external accomplishments of their royal dynas-ties — in abundant and flamboyant, albeit cryptic, style. Maya hiero-glyphic writing is a combination of systems, phonetic and logographic,with signs representing whole words and syllables. Of perhaps morethan one thousand “glyphic components,” three hundred to five hun-dred glyphs or signs were regularly used, approximately 60 percent of01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 7"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"8maya political sciencethem now deciphered (Martin and Grube 2000 : 11). Recently it was sug-gested that Classic texts were written not in Ch’olan and/or YukatekanMayan, as long assumed, but in a “prestige” or “high” language calledClassic Ch’olti’an, related to the now extinct Ch’olti’ language of theEastern Ch’olan Maya language family (Houston, Robertson, and Stuart2000). This language, if in fact it existed, is thought to have originatedin western and south-central Petén, and would have been used in the inscriptions and perhaps also spoken by elites and priests (Houston2000 : 162).Virtually the only surviving examples of Maya hieroglyphic texts arethose inscribed and sometimes painted narratives on stelae (see Stuart1996) and carved elements of buildings, such as stone panels, tombwalls, benches, or wooden lintels over temple doorways. Some texts ap-pear on painted pottery, but many are the so-called Primary Standard Se-quence (Coe 1978 : 13; Grube 1991; Reents-Budet 1994) consisting ofbrief pro forma statements about ownership of the vessel. No Classic pe-riod painted codices (“books” of sized bark “paper”) are known to havesurvived.With advances in decipherment, archaeologists are increasingly ableto study Classic Maya civilization as the Maya themselves wrote aboutit (Stuart 1995), with the result that Maya archaeology is moving towardthe subfield of historical or “text-aided” archaeology (Little 1992). His-torical archaeology is a multi- and interdisciplinary endeavor in whichwritten and material records are evaluated, one against the other, to il-luminate events and circumstances of the past. But as historians andhistorical archaeologists have long known — and the past decade of post-modern, critical, and reflexive approaches in anthropology has empha-sized — dangers abound in placing too much reliance on written recordsfor reconstructing political organization and history. No written textsare unbiased records of historical “reality”: all histories were writtenwith a purpose and can be consciously manipulated and revised as thosepurposes change.Maya monuments are sometimes considered public propaganda dis-plays — stone billboards, in effect — proclaiming the supernatural powerof divine kings. This viewpoint has been critiqued (Stuart 1996 : 153)with the observation that stelae often have a “strong self-referentialquality” that almost approaches personification of the monument itself.But the monuments areabout the rulers, and their texts record royal dynasties, royal ancestors, royal genealogies, and royal triumphs vis-à-vis kings of other cities. Quotidian matters such as internal decisionmaking and intercourt squabbles, crop yields, pottery production quo-tas, corvée labor assignments, and so forth were not recorded in this 01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 8"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"approaches to maya political organization9way. Classic Maya inscriptions largely convey “winners’ history” (Ham-mond 1991 : 2) or “heroic history” (Sahlins 1983 : 522) and should be interpreted with due diligence. The events they record may be little more than dynastic chest thumping or claims to fulfillment of quasi-historical prophetic mandates. Rulers could put their own rhetorical“spin” on events by commissioning texts to proclaim what they wantedpresent and future generations to believe about themselves and theirroyal dynasties. We must remain alert to the possible tyranny of the epi-graphic record.There is another danger in relying on dated, carved stelae to explorethe mayhypothesis, as I must do here, because key monuments may bemissing from key sites (see Coggins 1970; Robertson 1972). We knowthat early monuments, in particular, were often moved, defaced, orburied by later occupants of the sites; in more recent times looting andother activities such as logging and agriculture have exacerbated thelosses. Dates and imagery on the monuments might have been removedby the erosive forces of nature. Plain stelae might have had commemo-rative dates and glyphs recorded in perishable media, such as paint overstucco, rather than carved on them. In addition, some important low-land cities lack stelae entirely. However, certain elements of politico-ritual organization are mirrored in architectural and stylistic compo-nents, often shared widely throughout the lowlands.Native Texts of the Postclassic and Colonial PeriodsA direct-historical approach to Classic period lowland political organi-zation may be effected by cautiously working backward in time from ex-tant, indigenous texts written in the Postclassic and Colonial periods.Several kinds of documents have survived the centuries and are usefultoday.One category of native Mesoamerican text is the codex. Codices areknown from highland Mexico and the Maya area, date from the Post-classic and Colonial periods, and probably are, at least in part, copies ofearlier versions. Providing extensive treatment of astronomical and div-inatory affairs, these books “shaped practically every aspect of individ-ual and community behavior” (Boone 1992 : 197). In the Maya lowlandscodices were made of long strips of the beaten bark of the fig tree (Ficuscotonifolia; copoin Yukatekan Maya), sized with a lime wash and foldedaccordion style. Each “page” (Fig. 1.2) had hieroglyphic texts, tables, andillustrations written in black pigment, with red, blue, and other colorhighlights.Sadly, only four of these codices from the Maya lowlands are known01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 9"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"10maya political sciencefigure1.2 Page 25 of the Dresden Codex (after Villacorta and Villacorta [1930]1989 : 50).today, all dating to the Postclassic period and written primarily inYukatekan Maya; as noted, no Classic period codices survive. The Fran-ciscan friar Diego de Landa, writing in the sixteenth century, tells us why:We found a large number of books in these [hieroglyphic] charactersand, as they contained nothing in which there were not to be seensuperstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which theyregretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much afflic-tion.

The major book-burning episode in the northern low-lands is thought to have accompanied the Inquisition at Maní on July 12,1562 (Tozzer 1941 : 77–78n340).The surviving Maya codices are named for the places where they werefound or now reside: Dresdensis (Vienna), Tro-Cortesianus or Madrid(three fragments owned by separate families in Spain), Pérez or Pere-sianus (Paris), and Grolier (the Grolier Club in New York). All treat “pre-dictive astronomy,” that is, tables by which to predict the astronomicalevents and cycles governing ritual. The dates and origins of all three aresubject to debate, although prototype astronomical tables may go backto the mid-eighth century (Justeson 1989 : 76).The Dresden Codex, which treats Venus, Mars, and eclipse cycles,has glyphic and iconographic associations with eastern Yucatán, espe-cially Chich’en Itza, and Sir J. Eric S. Thompson (1972) dated it to theearly thirteenth century. More recent studies (e.g., Paxton 1986) noteiconographic similarities to the western Terminal Classic Puuc site ofKabah and date the Dresden to the Late Postclassic. The surviving workmay be the product of eight different scribes (Sharer 1994 : 603).The Madrid Codex (Bricker and Vail 1997), the longest of the codices(6.7 m, 112 pp.), has been described as being “concerned with the ritualaspects of everyday life rather than cosmic themes” (Graff 1997 : 167n2).Thompson thought the codex originated in western Yucatán sometimebetween a.d.1250 and 1450. Victoria Bricker’s (1997a:25; 1997b : 180) intensive studies suggest that some sections date to a.d.925 but pointto “the one-hundred-year span between a.d.1350 and 1450 as the mostlikely period” of the codex’s composition. Later studies have revivedThompson’s (1972) earlier suggestion that it might have come fromTayasal, the Itza capital, and date as late as the seventeenth century because of incorporated fragments of European paper (Coe and Kerr1998 : 181; Schuster 1999). Stylistically, the Madrid Codex is similar to the murals of eastern coastal sites such as Tulum and Tancah (seeMiller 1982).The Paris Codex, consisting of twenty-two pages, treats the k’atun,the important Maya calendrical interval of approximately twenty years.It also depicts the constellations, or zodiac. Bruce Love (1994 : 13) be-lieves the document was produced at Mayapán in northern Yucatán inthe late fourteenth or early fifteenth century, citing iconographic paral-lels to that site’s stelae.The fourth surviving codex, the Grolier (Coe 1973 : 150 –154), con-sists of fragments of eleven pages including part of a Venus table.

These books are much-reworked compilations of oral and cod-ical traditions originally delivered by the spokesman or speaker (chilan,chilam) of the jaguar priest (b’alam) who ruled over the k’atun. Ananalysis of these texts in the late nineteenth century indicated that theyrecorded astrological and prophetic matters, medical recipes and di-rections, postconquest history and Christian teachings, and ancientchronology and history (Morley 1917 : 196, citing Brinton [1885] 1969).With respect to the last of these subjects, the books can be deemed partorigin myth and part reconfigured mythocyclical histories, referring toevents of the Postclassic and Colonial periods and doubtless havingClassic antecedents in the codices burned by Fray Landa (Morley andBrainerd 1956 : 255; Thompson 1972 : 27). Only approximately sixteenmanuscripts of the chilam b’alams have survived to modern times;many remain untranslated. They are known today by the names of thetowns in which the manuscripts — none originals but rather all latercopies —were found, for example, the Chilam Balam of Chumayel,ofTizimin, of Mani, Kaua, Navula, Tusik. The extant versions of nearly allthese books date between 1824 and 1837 (Edmonson 1979 : 9).Great care is required in reading directly from these texts to the ar-chaeological and historical records of Postclassic and especially Classictimes. The contents were committed to writing during the Colonial period by educated Maya who had been trained to write their own(Yukatekan) language, using characters of the Spanish alphabet, as partof their religious instruction. There are two sets of k’atun prophecies inthese books (Roys [1933] 1967 : 185): an earlier one, which has more sym-bolic language and few references to postconquest events, and a slightlylater one, which includes references to Europeans and Christianity. Inaddition, the language of the books of the chilam b’alams is not prosebut poetry, “a highly charged and allusive language that stresses thequalityof time over its factual content” (Farriss 1987 : 577; emphasisadded). Perhaps this is because some of these books are compilations oforal dramatic performances. At the same time, Edmonson (1979 : 12 –13)believes the richly metaphorical language may have been intentionallyobfuscating to ensure that Maya traditions would remain secret fromthe Spanish authorities.More significantly, these books have heavy ethnocentric loading:they are ethnopoetic charters of ethnomythic history and identity, aswell as ethnic propaganda tracts for the two major elite lineages of the01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 12"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"approaches to maya political organization13Postclassic northern lowlands. The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel(Roys [1933] 1967; Edmonson 1986a), for example, is a self-aggrandizinghistorical chronicle of the people known as the Tutul Xiw in westernYucatán and makes repeated reference to symbolically significant de-feats of their rivals, the Itza/Kokom. Similarly, The Book of ChilamBalam of Tizimin(Edmonson 1982) is an idealized and mythologized re-construction of Itza/Kokom Maya history, and as such presents an ac-counting favorable to the Itza.It is readily evident, then, why in the intellectual annals of Mayascholarship the credibility of the books of the chilam b’alams for recon-structing Classic Maya history has waxed and waned. Some of the re-ported events appear to date to the Late Classic period, and Sylvanus G.Morley, one of the great pioneers in Maya archaeology, thought therewas “in fact little doubt” that the temporal cycles presented in thesedocuments were “literal translations of Maya historical codices” (Mor-ley and Brainerd 1956 : 255). Morley (1915) was aware, however, of thepeculiar problem posed by the occasional failure of the k’atuns to followin proper numerical sequence in parallel texts of different books andconcluded that some were omitted and others repeated. While this castsa shadow on the chronicles’ reliability as event histories, he concludedthat the texts “exhibit a similarity of detail which is little short of re-markable, and it is highly indicative of their reliability that . . . [over] a period of about eleven hundred years, there is always at least one of the chronicles which carries on the sequence of the katuns unbroken”(Morley 1915 : 199).Modern researchers are more skeptical. Edmonson (1982 : xvi) be-lieves these books are “essentially mythological as they relate to theClassic period” but reasonably trustworthy from the tenth century on-ward. His perusal of these documents led him to pose a series of pro-vocative questions concerning what they might tell us about the Clas-sic period, including the suggestion that Classic Maya recognizedcertain cities as “seats” of the may,the thirteen-k’atun, or 256-year, cal-endrical interval (Edmonson 1979). My reconstruction of Classic politi-cal organization here is heavily based on the books of the chilamb’alams, particularly on Edmonson’s interpretation of the mayas eluci-dated from these texts.Native Maya literature is also known from elsewhere in the lowlands,for example, the Paxbolon Papersfrom the Chontal region (Scholes andRoys 1968), and from the Maya highlands, for example, the Annals ofthe Cakchiquels(Brinton 1969; Recinos and Goetz 1953), a history ofKaqchikel Maya speakers in the central highlands of Guatemala. ThePopol Vuh(lit. “Book of the Mat”; Marcus 1992a:85), or “Council Book”(Tedlock 1985 : 23; 1992), is a sixteenth-century account of the origins,01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 13"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"14maya political sciencehistory, and cosmogony of the K’iche’ Maya in the western highlands.There is considerable evidence that these myths and beliefs were widelyshared among highland and lowland Maya from Preclassic times on-ward. Preclassic stelae from the Pacific coast site of Izapa, in Chiapas,Mexico, near the border with Guatemala, display scenes that closelyparallel events in the Popol Vuh(Smith 1984; Kerr 1992), as do poly-chrome plates from the Late Classic southern lowlands of Petén (Coe1978, 1989).Another potential source of inferences about territorial boundariesand organization are postconquest land treaties and rare native-drawnmaps. Many if not most of these documents, in the Maya area as else-where in the Spanish Colonial world, were prepared as justifications fornative claims to particular lands and jurisdictions on the basis of prioroccupation (Farriss 1987 : 571). Two of the known Maya maps, one inThe Chilam Balam of Chumayeland the other in the Land Treaty ofManí(Fig. 1.3), are circular, showing the main town in the center andwest at the top, and are divided into four quadrants with subject townsin each. According to a 1600 document, the Yukatekan term for map ispepet dz’ibil‘circular painting, drawing’ (Roys [1943] 1972 : 184; Mundy1998 : 195, 210). These representations reveal Maya concepts relating toland and space — quadripartition and boundaries of realms (Marcus1993 : 126 –128; see also Restall 1997 : 200 –203).Spanish Colonial DocumentsA third category of sources on Classic Maya political organization con-sists of ethnohistoric documents: records of various sorts kept by Colo-nial Spanish administrators and priests about their observations and ex-periences in the northern lowlands. The first European occupants of theYucatán peninsula struggled to gain control over the area and the Mayaby both military means and heavy-handed proselytizing. Instruction inthe Catholic religion was carried out principally by the Franciscan order,which established a string of missions throughout the northern penin-sula (Hanson 1995; Perry and Perry 1988) and left substantial records oftheir activities among the Maya.Here again, one must be cautious in reconstructing Classic affairsfrom these documents, which often divulge little more than what theSpaniards thoughtthe Maya were doing. Archaeologists in the latetwentieth century have emphasized the dangers of uncritically general-izing from Spanish administrators’ observations about the northernlowland Maya —who had suffered conquest, religious indoctrination,massive population losses and dislocations from disease and warfare,01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 14"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"approaches to maya political organization15figure1.3 Colonial period map of the Yucatán town of Maní (after Roys [1943]1972 : Map 6 and Andrews 1984 : Fig. 1).economic servitude, and worse, all at the hands of the Spaniards — andprojecting them back eight centuries or more to the southern lowlandMaya of the Classic period:The early chroniclers were unfamiliar with the ways of the nativeinhabitants of the New World and, thus, frequently did not under-stand what they were witnessing. . . .

(Chase 1992 : 118 –119)An example of these problems can be seen in the most detailed andfrequently used of the ethnohistoric accounts for the Maya, the 1566Relación de las cosas de Yucatanwritten by Fray Diego de Landa (seeTozzer 1941 for an annotated English translation). Landa, later the sec-ond bishop of Yucatán, recorded prodigious amounts of informationabut the Maya, including their daily life, religion, and calendrics and aphonetic transliteration of the Spanish alphabet into Maya glyphs.Much of his material came from two informants who were members of politically powerful rival lineages, Gaspar Antonio Chi, a Xiw fromManí, and Juan Nachi Kokom, a Kokom from Sotuta. Landa compiledhis observations after he was ordered before an ecclesiastical court inSpain in 1562 to justify his harsh treatment of the Maya. Thus he mighthave exaggerated certain aspects of Maya culture, such as “idolatry” andhuman sacrifice, which the Spaniards found abhorrent, in the hope ofbeing accorded more sympathetic treatment (Thompson 1970 : 457).Moreover, he was known as a plagiarist (Tozzer 1941 : vii).Despite these disturbing biases, many archaeologists and anthropol-ogists continue to find Colonial documents useful for suggesting whatthe past mighthave been like, with full recognition that the insightsthey provide do not necessarily represent historical fact.DictionariesAnother category of evidence about political organization ,one that over-laps ethnohistory and ethnography, comes from various Maya-Spanishand Maya-English dictionaries. Some of these vocabularies were com-piled in the Colonial period, most notably the late-sixteenth-centuryDiccionario de Motul: Maya-Español(Martínez Hernández [1585] 1929),which gives a wealth of information on Yukatekan Maya. Others datefrom as late as the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such as the com-pilation of previous vocabularies in the Diccionario maya cordemex:Maya-español, español-maya(Barrera Vásquez et al. 1980) and the Dic-cionario español-maya(Solís Alcalá 1949a). Most recently, the trilin-gual Itzaj Maya-Spanish-English Dictionary(Hofling and Tesucún 1998)01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 16"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"approaches to maya political organization17records the language of the last speakers of Itzaj Maya in San José, Petén,Guatemala.Dictionaries offer insights into native categorizations of politiesthrough the presence, absence, quantities, varieties, and etymologies ofwords that denote territorial units and decision-making personnel. Gen-erally, the richer the vocabulary for some phenomenon in a language,the more significant that phenomenon is for its speakers. Fortunately,the Maya had a rich but little analyzed vocabulary for their polities andauthority structures. In principle, the most significant or valid of theseterms, from the point of view of analogical reasoning, are those recordedduring the Colonial period in dictionaries and later documents such asthe Relaciones de Yucatán(1898 –1900). Many words survived intomodern times, and some can be traced back to titles recorded in Classicperiod hieroglyphic inscriptions (see Roys 1957, [1943] 1972; Marcus1993 : 128 –130; Restall 1997 : 24 –29). However, study of these terms inClassic period inscriptions reveals that some titles were more commonin certain sites or regions, and their roles and responsibilities might havevaried as well (Houston 2000 : 175).Modern EthnographyAnthropological studies of Mesoamerican peoples began in the latenineteenth century and have continued with little interruption (see Vogt1969 for a historical summary through the mid-twentieth century). Dur-ing the first half of the twentieth century, anthropologists undertookconsiderable ethnographic research throughout the Maya area, lowlandsand highlands, and their observations have greatly illuminated the so-cial and political institutions, as well as the daily lives, of the Maya. Re-lating modern political organization to that of the pre-Hispanic pastposes special challenges, however. Twentieth-century Maya are sepa-rated from their Classic and Postclassic forebears by some five hundredyears of religious, linguistic, economic, political, demographic, agri-cultural, and other disruptions imposed by the Spanish conquerors and modern national administrative structures. Beginning with the1552 ordenanzas(ordinances) issued by the Spanish governing authorityin the region, the Real Audiencia de Guatemala, the Maya, like pre-historic peoples throughout the hemisphere, were subject to the Span-ish Colonial administrative policy of resettlement known as reduc-ción, congregación,or agrupación.This policy forced the Maya to leavetheir small, dispersed agricultural villages and settle in larger, nucleatedtowns, whereby the Spaniards could better tax, catechize, and inden-ture them while at the same time guard against apostasy.

Descendants ofrefugee groups who fled both Spaniards and hostile Maya neighbors, theLacandon Maya have lived in near-isolation for centuries, with the result that they are the least acculturated to the modern world. Thissuggests that, in principle, they would provide the most appropriateanalogies to their ancestors. However, the Lacandon have dwindled to a handful of families in two groups, northern and southern, and any-thing resembling “political organization” is virtually nonexistent: “Thenorthern group, scattered over a large territory, lost all political or reli-gious organization and system of leadership so long ago that they can-not remember ever having had it. The Jatate and Cedro-Lacanha groupsused to have leaders and priests, but their number is now so reduced thatthe system has collapsed” (Duby and Blom 1969 : 290).In the early twentieth century, the primary sociopolitical unit of ad-ministration throughout much of Mesoamerica was the municipio.Inthe highlands of Guatemala, a municipio is something like the U.S.county, each having “its own religious and political organization, its pa-tron saint, its distinctive costume. . . . The Indian municipio undoubt-edly has considerable time depth and might be a continuation of the basic societal unit of preconquest society” (Wagley 1969 : 55; see alsoTax and Hinshaw 1969 : 88). Wagley’s statement is of dubious veracity,however, and might represent a tendency of early ethnographers to cor-roborate Thompson’s views (see Chap. 2; see also Becker 1979).Throughout Colonial Mesoamerica, the Catholic religion, with itsmultiplicity of saints and saints’ days, was easily grasped by the indige-nous inhabitants and readily integrated with native calendars, patrondeities, and ritual practices (e.g., Nash 1958; Bricker 1989). An impor-tant politico-religious system of the Maya highlands is the cofradía,a brotherhood charged with caring for a patron saint and arranging ceremonies according to the religious calendar. Such systems mighthave had ancient roots in deity cults and their priests in Mesoamericanprehistory.All five of these sources of information about Maya political organiza-tion provide, with varying emphases, combinations, and degrees of suc-cess, analogies to reconstructions of Classic lowland Maya political re-lations.

But while the past decades’ accelerating decipher-ment of glyphic texts has made it increasingly possible to read Classicperiod history as the Maya themselves wrote it, one consequence hasbeen the creation of a highly fragmented and particularized reconstruc-tion of Classic period history based on details of a few individual lordsand dynastic lines at a small number of sites. It may be true that “all pol-itics is local,” to use an old cliché, but in narrowly focusing on individ-ual trees we have been “losing sight of the forest,” to paraphrase an-other. An integrative synthesis of Classic lowland Maya political historyis sorely needed.Maya Cosmology and WorldviewUnderstanding Maya cosmology broadly is an important first step inproducing a synthesis of Classic lowland Maya political history, becausepolitical organization, at least in the sense the term is used here, has aspatial and territorial component. How did the Classic Maya concep-tualize their world? To those trained in occidental, “rational” scien-tific thought, the ancient Maya worldview and cosmology seem like abaffling stew of mysticism, astrology, geomancy, and numerology, withsome fairy tales, feng shui,and puppy dogs’ tails tossed in for good mea-sure. For anthropologists, however, science, religion, cosmology, andpolitics are all examples of different but interrelated belief systems that“work” for those who partake of them. For example, the U.S. Constitu-tion articulates the founding fathers’ belief system that included a “sep-aration of church and state.” Such separation of religious belief and po-litical policy tends to be the exception rather than the rule, however,especially in prehistory. And so it was with the ancient Maya: their po-litical and territorial organization was deeply interwoven with their re-ligion and cosmology.Ancient Maya worldview and cosmology (see, e.g., León-Portilla1988) have been retrodicted from the sources just reviewed, in additionto similar sources from central Mexico, all of which show a great deal ofagreement. The Maya, like most Mesoamerican peoples, believed thatthere had been numerous episodes of cosmic creation, the present onebeing the fourth (or fifth). The Maya cosmos had three vertical domainswith multiple levels: the heavens (thirteen levels), the natural earthlyworld, and the Underworld (nine levels). Each level or plane was thedwelling of a particular deity, hence thirteen benign celestial gods andnine malevolent gods of the Underworld.In all levels, the Maya cosmos was, above all, divided horizontally01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 19"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"20maya political scienceinto four parts. According to the Popol Vuh,the highland Maya book ofcreation, the first act by the gods was to “set up the kan xuk kan tzuk,‘four corners, four partitions’” (Schele and Mathews 1998 : 345n2):. . . the Maker, Modeler, mother-father of life[proceeded]to complete the emergence of all the sky-earth:the four-fold siding, four-fold cornering,measuring, four-fold staking, halving the cord,stretching the cordin the sky, on the earth,the four sides, the four corners.(Tedlock 1985 : 72)This quadripartite cosmovision, roughly based on the four cardinal (orintercardinal) directions, was shared throughout Mesoamerica in an-cient times and modern (Gossen and Leventhal 1993). The cardinal di-rections were simultaneously connected to the cosmic levels, and eachhad multiple associations (see the “Ritual of the Four World-Quarters”in The Chilam Balam of Chumayel;Roys [1933] 1967 : 63 – 66).However, Maya quadripartite organization of horizontal space is not strictly based on the four fixed cardinal directions recognized in the modern world. Instead, the divisions seem to invoke the solstice-equinox positions and movements of the sun as it rises on the easternhorizon and sets on the western; there is also the element of personi-fication of the sun or Sun God as it proceeds on its journey from east towest (Brotherston 1976; Gossen 1974; Bricker 1983; B. Tedlock 1992 :173 –178). Among the lowland Maya, this solar basis for naming direc-tions is evident by incorporating k’in,‘sun’, into the term. East (lak’in)was associated with sunrise, birth, and the color red (chak), while West(chik’in, ochk’in) was associated with sunset, death, and the color black(ek’). By contrast, xaman(North) was associated with “up” (as in the sunat zenith), the Sun God’s “right” side on his journey, heavens, the num-ber 13, the place of ancestors, and the color white (sak). Nojol(South)was associated with “down” or the sun’s nadir, the sun’s “left,” the Underworld, the number 9, night (“death” of the sun and its Underworldjourney back to the east), and the color yellow (k’an).A fifth “direction” is center, an axis mundiextending through all lev-els; metaphorically, it is a ceiba tree (the Maya “World Tree”; Ceiba pen-tandra,kapok tree) growing from the center of the earth and reaching upinto the heavens.

Mesoamerican cities, architectural complexes, and indi-vidual buildings are thus often cosmograms, earthly representations ofthe sacred cosmic domain (Coggins 1980; Guillemin 1968; Ashmore1989), and thus constitute sacred landscapes. Eduardo Matos Mocte-zuma observed that the site for the founding of a cityis always “discovered” by humans through certain symbols ladenwith mystic meaning, among which frequently occurs the presenceof some animal. . . . As Eliade (1979 : 335) says: “The foundation ofthe new city repeats the creation of the world; indeed, once theplace has been ritually validated, a fence is erected in the form of a circle or a square broken by four doors which correspond to thefour cardinal directions.” (1987 : 191)In Mesoamerica and among the Maya, buildings were arranged in thefour directions around plazas and towns may have been divided physi-cally and administratively into four quarters or wards. Further, as notedpreviously, the few surviving Maya maps show the landscape dividedinto four quarters.In addition, many Mesoamerican gods, for example, the rain gods,had four aspects or existed in groups of four, each with an associatedcolor, direction, and augury. Maya rain or lightning gods were known asChaks: the eastern Chak brought “red” and good rains (prevailing tradewinds in Mesoamerica typically bring rainy season storms from theeast); the northern Chak, “white” good rains (usually winter rains fromcold fronts moving south from North America); the western Chak,“black” poor rains; and the southern Chak, “yellow” poor rains (meteo-rologically, rain rarely moves into the lowlands from the west or south).Each directional god aspect also had an associated priest, tree, and otherelements.The following chapters explore these concepts and additional infor-mation relating to Maya cosmology and worldview in terms of their im-plications for understanding political organization and process.01-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 21"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"chapter 2Previous Reconstructions of ClassicMaya Political OrganizationThe Classic period (a.d. 179 – 948; see Table 1.1) political organization of the lowland Maya has been the subject of endless theorizing, mod-eling, and debate throughout the twentieth century (see reviews byBecker 1971 : 28 –105, 1979; Willey 1986; Hammond 1991 : 14 –18; Cul-bert 1991b; Marcus 1993; Lucero 1999; McAnany 2001; Iannone 2002;Webster 2002 : Chap. 5). Early reconstructions have fallen into disfavorand then reemerged as more data are accumulated and intellectual cur-rents shift. Debates have crystallized around polar positions on interre-lated and generally scalar issues of size, centralization, hierarchy, au-tonomy, and stability of Maya polities in the Late Classic and throughtime. Lurking behind these arguments is the awareness that the Mayalowlands encompasses an area of some 250,000 to 300,000 square kilo-meters and intersite political relations, whether friendly or hostile,could have been maintained only by means of travel on foot or by water-craft through dense tropical forest and often difficult terrain.Early ThoughtsThrough the first quarter of the twentieth century, attempts to under-stand Classic Maya civilization broadly — political, social, economic, religious, and material aspects — consisted of descriptive syntheses of travelers’ reports, ethnographic analogies, and British structural-functionalism. During what Becker (1971) identified as an “Early Pe-riod” of this endeavor, from 1838 to 1923, explorers such as Edward H.Thompson, Alfred Percival Maudslay, Teobert Maler, Cyrus Thomas,Alfred M. Tozzer, and Sylvanus Griswold Morley viewed Maya sites ascomplex “cities” characterized by grandiose palace and temple archi-tecture and large, socially differentiated resident populations. An anal-ogy was drawn between the Maya and the Greeks, based on the inferencethat they were both “artistic and intellectual people” and that, politi-cally, “both were divided into communities or states that bickered and02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 22"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"quarreled. There were temporary leagues between certain cities, but realunity only against a common enemy” (Spinden 1917 : 177).The end of this early interval corresponds roughly to the initiation of major projects in Maya archaeology by the Division of Historical Research of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which dominatedthe field for nearly half a century (see Special Section in Ancient Meso-america1[2], 1990). The first of these Carnegie projects was Morley’s ef-fort to record Maya inscriptions, which led him to the following enor-mously influential conclusion:The Maya inscriptions treat primarily of chronology, astronomy —perhaps one might better say astrology — and religious matters.They are in no sense records of personal glorification and self-laudation. . . . They tell no story of kingly conquests, recount nodeeds of imperial achievement; . . . they are so utterly impersonal,so completely nonindividualistic, that it is probable that the name-glyphs of specific men and women were never recorded upon theMaya monuments. (Morley 1946 : 262)The anthropomorphic figures on the monuments bearing these inscrip-tions were judged to be peaceful gods, priest-astrologers, or calendarpriests.Morley’s investigations led him to propose (1915, 1946) a highly cen-tralized, even imperial, model of Maya civilization flourishing in twophases, an Old Empire (comprising sites in the southern lowlands; seealso Gann and Thompson 1935 : 29 – 66) and a New Empire (comprisingthe later sites in the northern Maya lowlands). The Old Empire, nowknown as the Classic period, was regarded as exhibiting a high degree ofhomogeneity for roughly six hundred years, which at the time suggested“the presence of one supreme ruler over the area” (Bell 1956 : 437). Mor-ley acknowledged the difficulties of explaining the consolidation andmaintenance of such a unified political structure, because there seemedto be “no evidence of warfare as a nationalizing force” (Morley andBrainerd 1956 : 45).It is noteworthy that in his early synthetic work, The Ancient Maya(Morley 1946; Morley and Brainerd 1956 : 144), Morley noted that in thecentral and southern lowlands during the Classic period there may havebeen at least four “archaeological sub-provinces [that] correspondedroughly to a political unit of some sort.” These included central andnorthern Petén, Guatemala, plus adjacent Belize; the Usumacinta valleyin the west; the southeastern area (centered on Copán); and the south-western area (Río Pasión). In addition, “eastern Campeche and southernYucatan formed a region apart.” Morley (1946 : 316 –319; Morley andreconstructions of classic maya political organization2302-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 23"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Brainerd 1956 : 267–270) also created a four-tiered hierarchy to classifyMaya “religious centers according to their relative importance” basedon areal size, architecture, and “number and excellence of their sculp-tured monuments.” On this basis, Morley (1946 : 160 –161) proposedfour regional polities within the southern lowland empire: Tikal con-trolled north-central Petén and Belize; Copán ruled the southeastern re-gion; Palenque, Piedras Negras, or Yaxchilán headed the Usumacintaarea; and Toniná dominated the northwestern zone. Morley and Brain-erd (1956 : Plate 19, Table VII) identified four Class 1 “metropolises”(Tikal, Copán, Chich’en Itza, and Uxmal), nineteen Class 2 “cities,” in-cluding Calakmul (whose 103 known monuments were “for the mostpart of little esthetic merit”), thirty-nine Class 3 sites (“large towns”),and fifty-four Class 4 sites (“small towns”).Another authoritative Maya archaeologist of the time, J. Eric Thomp-son, agreed with Morley that Maya political organization was essen-tially peaceful and controlled by priests, with religion the basis of power.Thompson (1970 : 94) supported his theocratic view of Maya society bynoting the lack of evidence for warfare, such as fortifications; in ad-dition, the seemingly continuous pace of building construction arguedfor “prevailing peace during the Classic period.” The collapse of ClassicMaya culture was, in his view, a consequence of “peasant revolt” againstpriestly rule. Further, he suspected that “the provinces into which Yu-catán relapsed after the fall of Mayapán were in existence long before therise of Mayapán and continued to reflect more or less the set-up of the‘districts’ controlled by each major ceremonial center” in earlier periods(Thompson 1970 : 90).Unlike Morley, however, Thompson (e.g., 1942) saw Maya politicalorganization as highly decentralized. He believed that Maya societyconsisted of two classes, priests and peasants. The peasants lived insmall agricultural villages and hamlets surrounding the large sites,which, in his view, were not populated cities but vacant ceremonial cen-ters, sacred precincts of temples and palaces that were uninhabited ex-cept for priests and had only intermittent ceremonial functions. Thesesites, together with the villages in the surrounding hinterlands, consti-tuted autonomous city-states, and Classic Maya political organizationconsisted of a “loose federation” of them, with government “largely inthe hands of a small caste of priests and nobles” (Thompson 1970 : 97).He went on to characterize that government by suggesting, “It is quitelikely that, as in [Aztec] central Mexico, the rulership of each city statewas dual.”Thompson’s highly popularized interpretations of Maya civilizationled to a series of superficially supportive but often circular and some-times specious claims on the part of ethnographers working in both the24maya political science02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 24"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Guatemalan highlands and the Yucatán peninsula (Becker 1979 : 9 –10).Although influential, his views were based on little empirical evidenceand indeed reflected many of the biases of his personal upbringing aswell as the anticommunist tenor of the times (Becker 1971 : 67, 1979 :12 –14; Kremer 1994).The views of both Morley and Thompson were at least partly shapedby then-current understandings of Maya subsistence. The prevailingconcept was that the Maya, like most tropical peoples, practiced slash-and-burn (or swidden) agriculture — cutting down a patch of forest nearthe end of the dry season, burning it, and planting corn and beans in thenutrient-rich, ashy soils just as the rains began to fall. Because slash-and-burn agriculture is land-extensive, it is generally associated withdispersed settlement, low population density, and decentralized socio-political organization.In sum, from the 1930s through the 1950s, two closely related yet dis-tinct positions dominated scholarly thinking about Classic lowlandMaya political organization. There was concurrence that the civiliza-tion was largely theocratic and peaceful, with the human figures de-picted on stelae being astrologer-priests, or “calendar priests.” Therewas disagreement about whether or not there was some hierarchy ofcentralized power among the Maya, with Morley taking an affirmativeview and Thompson advocating a model of decentralized authorityvested in numerous city-states. Both positions were based largely on thesame evidence: archaeological site maps, excavations, and artifacts; assumptions about the subsistence system; limited understanding of iconography and epigraphy (primarily calendrical information); anddirect-historical analogy to Landa’s Relaciónand other native and Span-ish texts.The Political Geography of the Yucatan MayaOne of the earliest discussions of lowland political organization thatprovides analogies for the Classic Maya is Ralph L. Roys’s 1957 mono-graph, The Political Geography of the Yucatan Maya.This is a province-by-province review of the sixteen “native states” in the Yucatán penin-sula in the early sixteenth century after the collapse of the Mayapán“confederacy.” Mayapán is a large Late Postclassic archaeological sitelying southeast of Mérida. According to Roys’s ([1933] 1967) readings ofthe books of the chilam b’alams, from its ceremonial founding in theearly thirteenth century until its “collapse” in 1450, Mayapán was iden-tified as the centralized seat of multepal,which he translated as “jointgovernment” by lineage leaders. This joint government resulted from anagreement between the two major elite lineages of the Yucatán penin-reconstructions of classic maya political organization2502-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 25"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"26maya political sciencesula, the Xiw in the west and the Kokom in the east. It fell apart after aXiw-led uprising against the Kokom, at which point Mayapán was aban-doned and the lineage leaders returned to their home territories. Thiswas the situation encountered by the Spaniards some fifty years later: a strong historical memory of the centralized Mayapán confederacy but a realpolitik of sixteen or so postbreakup provinces throughout the peninsula.Roys (1957 : 6 –7; see also Marcus 1993 : 118 –120) organized the vari-ability in administrative and territorial organization of these provincesinto three categories (Fig. 2.1):A. Provinces, or kuchkab’als,are centralized territories ruled by ahereditary jalach winikwith the title ajaw.There is a capital orlarge town (noj kaj) where the jalach winik resided; a hierarchyof other towns (kaj) heading smaller dependent polities (b’atab’il)ruled by a b’atab’;and numerous small towns (chan kaj). Exam-ples of these centralized polities in post-Mayapán times includeCochuah ,Maní (Xiw) ,Hocaba ,Sotuta (Kokom) ,Cehpech (Cum-kal and Mutul), Champoton, Cozumel Island, and probably alsoAh K’in Chel and Tases, plus Tayasal in Petén (Roys [1943] 1972 :59). These provinces are equivalent to what some anthropolo-gists might call complex, or “maximal,” chiefdoms (e.g., Marcus1993 : 157).B. This category of province lacks a single territorial ruler (jalachwinik). Instead, administration is in the hands of related b’atab’swho are usually members of the same lineage. Examples includethe sixteenth-century Aj Kanul (Calkini) and Kupul provinces;these would fall into the anthropological category of simple, or“minimal,” chiefdoms (Marcus 1993).C. Polities in this category were small and highly decentralized,consisting of loosely allied groups of towns or slightly largerunits but lacking a jalach winik and clear territorial organiza-tion. They tended to be found on the outskirts of more central-ized systems and included the sixteenth-century Ecab, Uaymil,Chakan, and Chikinchel provinces.Roys’s study was based on the “tax list of 1549,” which itemizes 180grants of encomienda(stewardship; labor and tribute rights) to the earlySpanish settlers of Yucatán and lists nearly 57,000 tributaries, suggest-ing a total population of some 256,200 Maya (Roys 1957 : 10).

Sergio Quezada(1993), for example, identified two rather than three types of politicalunits in the sixteenth century. One type consisted of polities based onsubordination, kuchkab’als headed by powerful jalach winiks with com-bined military, political, religious, and judicial roles. These polities cen-tered on powerful ruling dynasties, with succession passed on to a malerelative. The second type had a less centralized organization, in whichmilitary, religious, and politico-judicial functions were administered bythree individuals. In many details, however, Quezada’s model differslittle from Roys’s.Matthew Restall’s (1997) study of Colonial Yucatán’s sociopoliticalorganization focused on the community level in the period 1550 –1850and noted the lack of sound evidence for indigenous “macro-units,” orprovinces of the type that Roys discussed. Restall’s conclusions arebased on varying interpretations of the term “kuchkab’al” as well as hisconclusion that the title jalach winik is primarily honorific. Here it isimportant to remember that Roys’s analysis was based on a documentdated 1549, less than a decade after the Spanish capital of Mérida was es-tablished, whereas Restall’s covers the subsequent centuries of imposi-tion of colonial authority.A third recent study, by Philip C. Thompson (1999), is a “documen-tary ethnography” of the town of Tekanto, in north-central Yucatán (theformer Aj K’in Chel kuchkab’al), in the eighteenth century. Thompson(1999 : 311–312; emphasis mine) concluded that “fundamental precon-quest concepts about the relationship between time and space and po-litical power, concepts ultimately based in Maya calendrics,” had sur-vived despite two centuries of Spanish domination. Among the conceptsand principles Thompson cites are the quadripartite rotation of townleaders, the basis for selecting each b’atab’ (alternating matrilines), andthe twenty-year term of office of the b’atab’.Twentieth-Century EthnographyAlfonso Villa Rojas’s (1969) synthesis of the ethnography of the Maya ofYucatán highlights the imposition of Catholic religious and modernMexican political structure in the region but also reveals strong conti-nuities of precontact practices (see also Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934;Steggerda 1941). For example, the Yucatán Maya had two types of reli-gious specialists: one to take care of matters of the church and another(the j-men‘one who knows’) to handle rituals of the indigenous gods.The most frequently observed ceremonies were ch’a chak(to bring rain),u janli kol(dinner of the milpa), u janli kab’(dinner of the bees), and lojkaj(purification of the town) (Villa Rojas 1969 : 269).02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 28"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"reconstructions of classic maya political organization29Of particular interest is a group of Krusob’ Maya in X-Cacal, Quin-tana Roo, ruled by a “military theocracy” headed by a high priest and amilitary chief (Villa Rojas 1945, 1969 : 269 –270). Religious ceremonieswere performed in the town’s two-room, thatched-roofed Templo Mayor.Native rituals such as tup k’ak’(fire-quenching; see Chap. 8) and ch’achak were carried out in the front room while Catholic services tookplace in the back, where there was an oracle-like “cross that speaks”(see Bennett 1970). Villa Rojas describes his experience:During my stay among the tribe, the cross restricted its speaking to dialogues and messages given in private to its immediate in-terpreters: the scribes. This contrasts with its habit of three or four decades ago when it used to deliver sermons of great tran-scendence during special sessions . . . in the middle of the night and in which, among other things, it announced forthcomingcalamities. (1969 : 270)Ethnographic research suggested that many towns in the Maya high-lands were primarily politico-economic and religious centers, without alarge resident population. Most of the population lived and worked ontheir farmsteads or in dispersed hamlets in the countryside, close totheir fields. Visits to the city, where they often also had homes, tookplace primarily on market days or for religious festivals. Chichicaste-nango (Tax 1937 : 430; Tax and Hinshaw 1969 : 72 –73) along with othercommunities in the western highlands (Wagley 1969 : 55–56) were ex-amples of this kind of dispersed hamlet.These virtually empty central places in the highlands provided the“vacant-town” model (Tax 1937) that was widely applied to the ancientlowland Maya and was readily accommodated by the prevailing theoc-racy interpretation. In Wagley’s (1941 : 8) ethnography of the Maya ofChimaltenango, for example, he pointed out that “[t]he majority ofGuatemala Indians . . . live near their fields, as did their ancient ances-tors; the Spanish pueblo with its church and market center had sup-planted the aboriginal ceremonial centers” (emphasis added; see alsoBecker 1971 : 49 – 64), the latter term apparently taken from Thompson(1931). In the municipio of Zinacantán, Chiapas, Mexico, which itselfhoused only 6 percent of the population, farmers living in small, scat-tered hamlets worked in the lowland piedmont, or “Tierra Caliente,some 12 or more hours distant on foot, where most of the maize feedingthe population is grown” (Vogt 1961 : 134). The vacant town – ceremonialcenter phenomenon was probably a vestige of the 1552 policy of congre-gación. Because of the isolation and difficulty of travel in the ruggedhighlands, it was even easier here for the decrees to be ignored over time,02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 29"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"30maya political scienceas they were in Yucatán, and the Maya returned to their former dis-persed settlement pattern.In many if not most of these highland communities, ethnographicstudies uncovered a synthesis of indigenous Maya politico-religious be-lief and ritual with modern administrative units. These combined intoa shadow system of native administration, unacknowledged by the na-tional government, consisting of numerous officials with primarily tra-ditional ritual obligations. In Mam-speaking Todos Santos, Guatemala,for example, the principales,mostly former town mayors, are the ulti-mate authorities on all civil and ritual matters. One of the principales isthe Chiman Nam, also known as “El Rey,” a shaman-priest whose officeis hereditary and who “has the final word on all public ritual, knowledgeof the Maya calendar, and divination on public matters” (Wagley1969 : 59).The Tzotzil of Zinacantán (Vogt 1961, 1969, 1981) preserved numer-ous pre-Columbian traditions syncretized with Catholicism, for ex-ample, rotating men from field labor into town to carry out the im-portant cargo(charge, burden, responsibility) of religious ceremonies,including pilgrimages of saints to and from larger communities withchurches. Vogt (1964 : 35) was impressed with the way the Zinacantecosmaintained “their successive turns in order on a waiting list for priestlyduties for which they applied sometimes as many as twenty years in advance.” Small hamlets of patrilineal households clustered togetheraround sacred water holes and commemorated ancestors and sacredspots in the environment by erecting crosses or trees (e.g., k’in kruscelebrations in May and October).A new generation of more systematic approaches to Classic Maya po-litical organization — integrating data from modern ethnography, Roys’sstudies, early Spanish documents, particularly Landa’s Relación,andother sources —began to appear in the last half of the twentieth century.One of the most important of these was Michael Coe’s (1965) model of ancient Maya community structure, which took as its starting pointthe descriptions of cyclical rotations of Wayeb’ year-ending rites (seeChap. 3). His idealized model proposed that each community consistedof four wards (tzukuls), each associated with a cardinal direction, acolor, and a series of ranked offices. Ritual and political leadership of thecommunity rotated through the four wards in a four-year counterclock-wise cycle. Higher levels of politico-ritual administration, includinglarge cities like Mayapán and entire territories, could also be accommo-dated in this model, with a jalach winik or ajaw ruling from the territo-rial capital and a b’atab’ in each of the four divisions. Temple-pyramidsand perhaps entire sectors of cities and towns might have been identi-fied with specific lineages (Coe 1965 : 111).02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 30"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"reconstructions of classic maya political organization31Coe noted that use of “calendrical permutations to rotate poweramong equal segments of a community” seemed “uniquely Maya” andsolved the widespread theoretical and practical problem of legitimatesuccession of kingship. Furthermore, the “suggestion of some kind ofregular transfer of ascendancy, perhaps purely ritual” in northern Yu-catán gains further credence through analysis of the twenty-year cyclesof the k’atun. As conveyed in the chilam b’alams, these “present anideal model of 13 territories” (Coe 1965 : 109 –110).Site Size and Size-Hierarchy ModelsArchaeological investigations of Classic lowland Maya sociopolitical or-ganization received new impetus in the early 1960s when settlementpattern studies came into vogue (e.g., Ashmore 1981; Bullard 1960; Wil-ley et al. 1965). By that time, there was some consensus that the largeClassic sites served as “the religious, political, and probably, commer-cial nucleus of Maya society and that these nuclei held some sort of sov-ereignty over specified territories” (Willey et al. 1965 : 13). But an oldquestion reemerged: Can these sites — often referred to as central placesor civic-ceremonial centers — also be called “cities”? Are they “urban”centers?Standard sociological definitions of cities emphasize population size,density, and nucleation, along with heterogeneous and often concentriczonation of largely secular functions in the case of urban centers. In the-ory, at least, cities and urbanization — that is, large populations concen-trated in multifunctional centers — are a requisite of civilizational de-velopment: nucleated populations are more readily subject to political,economic, and social regulation by a state administrative apparatus.But, increasingly, archaeologists are arguing that large, non-Western,preindustrial centers also constitute cities, even though they fail tomatch the ethnocentric definition of modern, Western sociology (seeMarcus 1983). Many Maya archaeologists (e.g., Sanders and Webster1988; Ball and Taschek 1991) have adopted Richard G. Fox’s broader cat-egorization of cities as central places within a state where certain kindsof functions are concentrated. Of particular interest to Mayanists isFox’s (1977 : 41) definition of “regal-ritual cities” as settlements whose“primary urban role is ideological.” He continues, “This cultural roleemerges from the prestige and status of the state ruler or the cohesivepower of state religion.” The political power of the rulers of such statesand cities rests in ideological control.Some investigations of Classic political organization — particularly ofcentralization and hierarchical structure — compared sites by theirsizes, assuming a linear relationship between size and power. Site sizes02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 31"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"32maya political sciencewere estimated by total population, total area of settlement, number ofplazas surrounded by civic-ceremonial buildings, or volume (cubic me-ters) of construction. In this way, sites were rank-ordered into size hier-archies, proxy scales for relative political power and importance.Estimating prehistoric population sizes is a notoriously difficult task.The bases for such estimates have included models of agricultural car-rying capacity, numbers of residents per household (using ethnohistoricor ethnographic census data), counts of structures, determination of siteboundaries, and other projections and data (see Rice and Culbert 1990;Culbert and Rice 1990). Estimates are also based on evidence of inten-sive agriculture plus new models of carrying capacity of corn-basedswidden, as well as extensive settlement surveys producing counts ofhousemounds that reflect the presence of populations well above the as-sumed carrying capacity for swidden. Comparisons of Late Classic pop-ulations are further confounded by the varying spatial units researchersuse: some base their estimates on the “central core”; others, on the“habitable urban zone,” “periphery,” “rural zone,” “whole site,” and soon. It is probably safe to say, however, that population sizes for “centralcores” ranged from about 1,500 (Quiriguá, Aguateca) to 10,000 to 15,000(Copán) to 40,000 or more (Tikal, Calakmul, Caracol), while total popu-lations including rural zones, “sustaining areas,” and larger territoriesmay have ranged in the hundreds of thousands (Rice n.d. : Table 1).A related basis for estimating site size is population or mound densi-ties rather than total counts. At Tikal, for example, the initial site map(Carr and Hazard 1961) revealed 235 mounds per square kilometer (km2)in the central core, but a subsequent survey suggested something closerto 635 per km2, with a total population of approximately 40,000 (Havi-land 1970 : 193; 1972 : 138). Densities fall off with distance from the cen-ters but still can be as high as 100 per km2.The validity of rank-ordering Maya centers using construction vol-ume (Turner, Turner, and Adams 1981) is based on the relationship be-tween construction volume and the “fossilized energy” represented bythe labor investment of planners, architects, stonemasons, plasterers,and so on, devoted to the construction effort (Abrams 1994). The tech-niques of using courtyards (Table 2.1) and acropolises (Adams 1981,1995; Adams and Jones 1981) are complementary, with the volumetricsystem more precise and data-sensitive than the courtyard counts(Turner, Turner, and Adams 1981 : 85; Abrams 1994), and both are moresensitive than Morley’s monument counts (Adams 1981 : Table 9.6).Several geographic techniques of locational or spatial analysis havebeen applied to Classic Maya sites as an aid to reconstructing politicaland economic relationships.

Reconstructions are based on variations between “real-world” sitedispositions and those of an idealized model. According to CPT, for ex-ample, an idealized distribution in such a situation is a lattice of equal-sized, often nested hexagons consisting of sites or cities surroundingcentral places (Haggett 1966 : 49). Such spacing facilitates economic in-teraction and political control through levels of administrative hierar-chies that are more or less equally accessible in a day’s travel. The stip-ulations of this model— a level, featureless plain — are clearly quiteunrealistic, as past and present cities throughout the world are dispersedover heterogeneous landscapes characterized by differences in topogra-phy, surface water features, soils and mineral resources, vegetation, andweather. Nonetheless, the kinds and degrees of departure from the idealcan be revealing. How much do Maya cities depart from this idealizedhexagonal lattice? Very little, according to Marcus (1993 : 154), whonotes that the sites forming a hexagonal lattice around Calakmul areequidistantly spaced at intervals of 30 kilometers, or a day’s travel(Fig. 2.2a).Thiessen polygons have been used (Hammond 1972, 1974; Flannery1977; Mathews 1985) to define site territories by marking midpoint dis-tances between capitals and then drawing and linking perpendicularlines between them, creating a lattice of polygons over the lowlands(Fig. 2.2b).

At the same time, however, by equalizing all sites and ig-noring hierarchies, this technique makes Tikal one of the smallest of alllowland political territories (Marcus 1993 : 155). In any case, the useful-ness of these polygons lies in estimating total territory within a site’sdomain or realm. Estimates of site territories have varied considerably,ranging from roughly 1,000 km2at the low end to 3,000 km2 at the up-per end. Obviously, territory sizes increase dramatically in centralizedmodels, ranging from about 30,000 to 100,000 km2.Trend surface analysis, a form of regression analysis of the distri-bution of points (i.e., sites) over a surface (landscape), was used in an ef-fort to gain insights into the Maya “collapse” (Bove 1981). That study,which used dates on forty-seven Late Classic stelae, supported the ideaof large regional states in the lowlands. Five regional zones were inter-preted from the data for a.d.849: these were centered on Calakmul,Tikal, Motul de San José, Seibal, and Chinkultic. Two other earlierzones, Palenque and Copán, were excluded because they were probablyabandoned by this date.Analysis of spatial distances between Classic centers does not qual-ify as creating “models” of political organization, but it can reveal hierarchies of sites. Many authors have commented on the geographicspacing between Classic centers and its implications for political orga-nization and administration. The distances between sites in the low-lands generally range from 20 to 32 kilometers (Morley, Brainerd, andSharer 1983 : 211; Houston 1992 : 68), or 12 to 20 miles, roughly the dis-tance that could be walked in a day. Similar spacing of archaeologicalsites has been noted in other regions of the world, such as Europe andthe Near East, and may represent a common logistical factor that facili-tates administration in early states lacking vehicular or animal trans-port systems.A different view of site sizes and spacing draws from archaeologicaland epigraphic interpretations of widespread conflict in the lowlandsduring the Late Classic period (Chase and Chase 1998). Distances be-tween sites would have been limited by the logistics of defending terri-tory; thus sites should ideally be located some 120 kilometers apart, as60 kilometers is an average “military marching distance” (Hassig 1992).The mean size of territories would have been restricted to the area thatcould be defended within those limits, roughly 8,000 to 9,000 km2, witha maximum territorial size of some 11,333 km2. This approach led tothe proposal of fourteen “primary capitals” in the lowlands, plus an-other seven “border centers” (Chase and Chase 1998).In any event, after four decades of survey and spatial analyses follow-ing William R.

At the apex is a large primary site with scoresof plazas and a population in the tens of thousands, which dominated aterritory of tens of thousands of square kilometers. These primary citiesinteracted with smaller secondary sites through royal marital ties andother alliances, perhaps economic, ritual, or military. Secondary siteswere, in turn, surrounded by even smaller tertiary- and quaternary-levelsites, perhaps dower houses (Haviland 1981), and tiny farming home-steads were interspersed around all of these.Inscription-based ModelsWhile information on site sizes, populations, and geographic spacing isessential for understanding the broader Classic Maya political land-scape, such data are static and descriptive. They fail to illuminate “thepolitical” itself, the arenas in which power is negotiated, with whomand by whom, and on what basis decision making takes place. Informa-tion on these aspects of political organization has flowed — indeed, it hasbeen gushing since the 1990s — from readings of Classic Maya inscrip-tions. As decipherments have proliferated (for a history, see Houston,Chinchilla Mazariegos, and Stuart 2001; Stuart 1992), so too has ourknowledge of the elements that constituted Maya political formations.These, combined with the interpretations drawn from earlier studies ofMaya art and iconography, have illuminated the world of Maya sover-eigns, their vassals, and their dynasties in ways that were unimaginablehalf a century ago. This growing body of knowledge has by no meansquieted debates on the particulars, however.Below I outline some of the titles and terms for polities and politicalroles and responsibilities derived from Classic period inscriptions andColonial dictionaries (see Fig. 2.3 for some glyphic signs). These titlesyield insights into how the Maya might have conceptualized what wewould call their “sociopolitical” world.

The jalach winik formulated “foreign” (e.g.,military) and domestic (political and judicial) policy and was alsoa religious leader. The town in which a jalach winik resided wasusually considered the capital of the territory in Colonial times.•Ajaw‘lord’, ‘king’: The top-level hereditary ruler of a territorialpolity (kuchkab’al), or perhaps simply the highest social stratumin Maya society (Montgomery 2001a : 201). This title is recognizedin Classic inscriptions via glyphs T168, T747a, T1000d. The wordcomes from aw‘shout’ with the agentive prefix aj(A. Hofling,pers. com., June 20, 2002) and can be read as “he who shouts orproclaims” (Stuart 1995 : 190 –191). According to David A. Freideland Linda Schele (1988a; Freidel 1992), the lowland Maya institu-tion of ajaw originated in the first century b.c.(Late Preclassic pe-riod), and by a.d.199 ajaws had divine or supernatural powers(k’ulor k’ujul ajaw‘holy lord’). More recent opinion suggests thatdivine status was achieved around a.d.400 (Grube and Martin2000 : 149). The institution of ajawship established rules for stablesuccession, transitioning from earlier individualized, charismaticleadership to formal, dynastically based rule; its membership in-cluded ancestors, gods, and live humans; ajaws were incarnationsof the ancestral Hero Twins; and they held contractual, ritual ob-ligations as intermediaries between the human-natural and divinerealms of the cosmos to ensure their continuity.•Ajawlil(Yukatekan), Ajawlel(Ch’olan): lordship, rule, or reign.•Kuchkab’al(kuch‘burden, office’; kab’or kaj‘town’): The largeterritory, jurisdiction, province, or region ruled by a jalach winikor an ajaw; used primarily [only?] in Yucatán?•Nakom:The same word is used to refer to two different officesand individuals. One nakom is a war chief, elected for a three-yearperiod, during which he must remain celibate; the people “burnedincense to him as an idol” (Morley and Brainerd 1956 : 154, quot-ing Landa).

Local-level political titles and units•Aj kuchkab’:Head of one of the four sudivisions or wards (kuch-teel) of a town; member of a town council who assisted the b’atab’in decision making, tax and tribute collection, and other civil af-fairs. Appointed by the b’atab’, the aj kuchkabs were usuallywealthy men and heads of important lineages and held office forone year. Thompson (1999 : 243 –244) views the etymology of theterm as aj kuch ka ja’ab’,or Yearbearer.•Kuchte’el‘barrio’, ‘ward’, ‘jurisdiction’, ‘neighborhood’) (Sp. parcialidad): A division of a b’atab’il, or town, often endogamous,headed by the aj kuchkab’, often with its own patron saint, offi-cials, and temple or church.•Aj k’ul(also Aj k’ujul): deputies, assistants to the aj kuchkab’s injudicial affairs; apparently commoners rather than nobility.•Jolpop(jol‘head; pop‘mat’): He or those at “the head of the mat,”a woven mat being a highland and lowland Maya symbol for the seat of authority. Among the highland K’iche’, the mat is a“metonym for a council (whose members sat on a mat or mats)and probably, at the same time, a metaphor for a council (whosemembers might have been thought of as being interwoven like amat or as serving to interweave those whom they represented)”(Tedlock 1985 : 345).

Two popolnajs have been excavated at Copán (Fash et al. 1992; Cheek 2003).Naj‘house’ also could be interpreted not as a structure but ratheras a lineage or in the sense of a “house society” (e.g., “House” ofWindsor). This might be related to the Tzotzil Maya of Zinacan-tan, for whom snarefers to a physical house or home and narefers to an extended family and its land and possessions (Vogt,cited in Gillespie 2000a; see also Gillespie 2000b). Nain Classichieroglyphic inscriptions is often translated as “woman.”The Importance of Emblem GlyphsThe basis for much of what is known about Classic Maya political orga-nization came from two stunning advances in glyphic deciphermentshalf a century ago, which revealed the historical content of Maya texts.One of these was Tatiana Proskouriakoff’s (1960) analysis of monumentsat Piedras Negras. She discovered a pattern of glyphs that recordedevents occurring five years apart, leading her to conclude that the per-sonages portrayed on Maya monuments were humans rather thandeities and that the texts recorded significant events in an individual’slife. Hers was a pioneering breakthrough because previously it was be-lieved, following Morley, that Maya inscriptions were impersonal andahistorical.The other crucial breakthrough at about the same time was HeinrichBerlin’s recognition that certain glyphs were names or “emblems” ofspecific places or groups (1958) and others were names of rulers (1959).Later he (Berlin 1968; see also Stuart 1995 : 202 –205) pointed out two dif-ferent glyphs of accession marking “effective rulership over a Mayatown.” One, the earlier of the two, was joy(Fig. 2.3g), the so-calledtoothache glyph (T684b); the other, later glyph was the “seating” glyph(Fig. 2.3h), read chum(T644a, T644b). Still later, another important con-tribution was Berthold Riese’s (1984) recognition of the hel(now readtzak) glyph and counts of succession of rulers in a particular dynasty.Numerous reconstructions of Classic lowland Maya political organi-zation have been based on sites’ display of Emblem Glyphs, although 02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 40"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"reconstructions of classic maya political organization41archaeologists disagree on how to interpret them. It is generally ac-cepted that Emblem Glyphs have both dynastic meaning (designating adynasty, its tutelary deity, or rulers’ titles) and geographic significanceas a toponym referencing a site or territory. This principle is similar to that of naming Maya territorial provinces, which may come from the title of the ruler, the resident ethnic or lineage group, the capital, ora prominent geographic landmark (Marcus 1993 : 128; Stuart and Hous-ton 1994).Emblem Glyphs have three parts (Fig. 2.4). The large main sign variesfrom site to site and is specific to a place and/or its regnant dynasty. Atwo-part superfix, T168, first read ben-ichby Thompson (1960 : 281–282), then aj-po, aj-pop,or ajaw(Lounsbury 1973), is now read with theT130 subfix (-wa) as ajaw, ‘ruler, lord.’ Finally, there is a prefix fromThompson’s “water group” of glyphs, which is usually read k’ulor k’u-julin Yukatekan Maya (ch’ulor chu’hulin Ch’olan): ‘divine, holy.’ Thisfigure2.4 The Tikal Emblem Glyph and variants.

In the context of Emblem Glyphs,Thomas S. Barthel (1968 : 165–170) interpreted them as symbolizing“preciosity” along the lines of primogeniture and descent in the rulinglineage, or ch’ib’al.When all elements are present, the Emblem is read in nonstandard or-der: prefix-main sign-super/subfix: ‘divine [site] lord.’ When the affixesare missing, the main sign serves primarily as a toponym (Barthel1968 : 184). Archaeologists and epigraphers have generally agreed that asite’s display of an Emblem (Fig. 2.5) signals its political importance and“independence” in some sense. Not all sites had Emblems, and somesites displayed their Emblems earlier than others.

It has not gone unnoticedthat at the same time models of Maya political organization and inter-site affairs became oriented toward incorporating relations of hostilityand warfare among sites. All this resulted in a series of intriguing —butoften diametrically opposed — models of political organization based ondiffering interpretations of the same data. The major unresolved issuehas been the degree of political centralization versus decentralization inthe Classic period, from site to site and region to region.Emblem Glyph–based (and Other) Decentralized ModelsSome analyses of the distribution of Emblem Glyphs supported decen-tralized — or city-state or “weak state”— models, which already existedin several variants. Advocates of this position argued that there waslittle inscriptional basis for inferring hierarchical dependency relationsamong polities and that the known Classic emphasis on documentingroyal genealogies supported lineage-based organizations. According tothis view, the Classic Maya political landscape was one of many small,unstable, independent polities constantly jockeying for power, all ofthem having essentially equivalent or redundant political, economic,and ritual systems.Peter Mathews (1985; 1991 : 29), for example, presented a highly de-centralized picture of Maya political organization that echoed Thomp-son’s views in some ways. He believed that the Emblem Glyph was thehereditary title for the ruler of a specific polity. Because the title givenin all Emblem Glyphs is the same — ajaw — and because all the siteshave the same political rank, there could be no hierarchical relationsamong them. Mathews’s early study (1985) of the temporal distributionof sites displaying their own Emblem Glyphs revealed that the numberincreased through the Classic period (Fig. 2.6). Because twenty-threeLate Classic polities displayed their own Emblem Glyphs just before the“collapse,” he argued that there were at least twenty-three independentlowland Maya polities at the close of the Late Classic. Another sixty toseventy sizable sites lacking Emblems constituted “autonomous city-states,” each with a territory of about 2,500 km2. Many new EmblemGlyphs have been discovered since Mathews’s original study, suggesting02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 43"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"44maya political sciencefigure2.6 Decentralized model of the geopolitical organization of the ClassicMaya lowlands based on sites displaying Emblem Glyphs (after Mathews 1991:Fig. 2.6).that more than forty autonomous polities could have existed in the LateClassic.Like Mathews, Stephen D. Houston (1992, 1993; Houston and Math-ews 1985; see also Stuart 1995 : 272) favored a decentralized and largelynonhierarchical model of Classic Maya political organization, in whichcity-states or polities identified by Emblems were politically auton-omous and spaced approximately 60 kilometers apart. Houston (1992 :67) believed they independently conducted “foreign policy,” warfare,and royal intermarriages, and relations of subordination were rare andbrief, though strong. Acknowledging that some territories or polities in-corporated more than one large site, Houston (1992 : 68) reminded usthat sites and polities are not synonymous.These political reconstructions based on Emblem Glyph distribu-tions supported other models of decentralized lowland political organi-zation, many of them drawn from outside the Maya lowlands, that em-02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 44"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"reconstructions of classic maya political organization45phasized the fragility and instability of Maya polities. Analogies havebeen drawn from sources so distant temporally, geographically, and cul-turally, however, that their appropriateness and explanatory power aresuspect.One example is the European feudal system: according to this model,Classic Maya societal organization — the social, economic, and politicalrelations between rulers and the lower classes —was similar to that offeudal overlords and their vassals, with land worked by serfs (Adams andSmith 1977, 1981; Grube and Martin 2000 : 150). Furthermore, the Ter-minal Classic “collapse” is explained by causes similar to Malthusiancrises affecting medieval Europe, including population growth, worsen-ing climatic conditions, crop failure, famine, and plague. The primarydifficulties with the feudal analogy are that feudal societies were notstate-level formations and the crucial element of feudalism — ownershipof land — is not clearly understood among the Classic Maya.Another external analogy is the “segmentary state” model of politi-cal organization, which several archaeologists (Houston 1993; Dunham1990; Ball and Taschek 1991; Laporte 1996; Mejía, Quezada, and Chocón1998; see also Fox et al. 1996) have applied to the lowland Maya. Themodel, drawn from Aidan W. Southall’s (1956, 1988) studies of the Alurin Africa, draws attention to patterns of instability and fissioning oftheir segmentary lineages. This initially led Southall to characterize theAlur as a “segmentary state,” even though they represented little morethan a ranked society and not a state at all. Coe’s (1965 : 112) model an-ticipates some factors that appear to support application of the segmen-tary state concept to the lowlands: powerful lineages and a dispersed set-tlement pattern might contribute to conflict among centers and rulinglineages, resulting in cities asserting independence and/or shifting alle-giance to other centers. And Fox’s (1977) regal-ritual city concept isclosely tied to the idea of segmentary states. But there is no evidencethat the lowland Maya had segmentary lineages.Several other decentralized scenarios have been popular in Mayastudies, many of which are variants of a city-state model. The city-statemodel was, of course, employed in both Morley’s and Thompson’s writ-ings and draws analogies to Greek city-states: small, autonomous poli-ties with a large, powerful city at their center. Others who have usedthis model include some archaeologists working at Copán (e.g., Webster1997; but cf. Webster 2002 : 164; Abrams 1994) and some epigraphers(Grube 2000a). This model has been criticized in part because of a lackof consensus as to whether city-states among the Greeks and elsewherein the Mediterranean region actually constituted state-level polities(Marcus 1998 : 89; Marcus and Feinman 1998 : 8 –10). In addition, such02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 45"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"46maya political sciencepolities frequently seemed to postdate the breakdown of large, unitaryterritorial states, such as that of Mayapán (see also Roys 1957).Somewhat related is the “peer-polity interaction” approach or model(Renfrew and Cherry 1986), drawn from study of the development ofearly states in the Aegean. This analytic perspective suggests that to un-derstand the emergence of states, we must first consider the kinds of interactions —warfare, exchange, and so on — that took place amongsmaller polities that are essentially “peers.” These small, autonomous,densely clustered “peer polities,” or statelets, exist in a circumstance ofuneasy competition against each other without any one able to achieveclear dominance (see Freidel 1986; Sabloff 1986). They may either pre-cede states or follow their breakup, as in the city-state model.Other decentralized analogues are the “galactic polities” from Stan-ley Tambiah’s (1977) analysis of Thai kingdoms as well as CliffordGeertz’s (1980) “theater state” in nineteenth-century Bali (see Demarest1992; Scarborough 1998). The key element in these systems is the insti-tution of kingship, particularly divine kingship: “The driving aim ofhigher politics was to construct a state by constructing a king. The moreconsummate the king, the more exemplary the center. The more exem-plary the center, the more actual the realm” (Geertz 1980 : 124). TheseAsian polities shared numerous features with the Classic lowland Maya,including cosmologically and ideologically based physical organizationof the states and their centers; political unity vested in the personal,charismatic qualities of the ruler, especially through the conduct of rit-ual performances; loose, decentralized control over labor and productionamong a “galaxy” of satellites or subordinate centers; and a dynamic,unstable political situation characterized by shifting alliances, terri-torial expansions and contractions, and elite warfare (Demarest 1992 :150 –151). The parallels that Demarest outlines between Asian andMaya polities are striking, and the Classic Maya may indeed be an ex-ample of a theater state; moreover, the theater state model writ large hassome parallels with Fox’s (1977) regal-ritual city concept.As a final note on decentralized models and analogies to Classic low-land Maya political organization, the advocates of such models havetended to work at smaller sites on the fringes of the domains of the greatLate Classic sites such as Tikal, Calakmul, and Caracol. They tend tostress the role of warfare in maintaining political independence — or in obstructing political unification — and favor non-Maya analogues that emphasize shifting and unstable polities (e.g., Pohl and Pohl 1994).These models approximate Roys’s (1957) third category of sixteenth-century polities in the Yucatán peninsula: loosely allied groups of townsor unrelated small polities lacking both a powerful lord (jalach winik)and incorporation into larger polities and lying on the peripheries of02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 46"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"reconstructions of classic maya political organization47more centralized systems. This circumstance certainly describes the sit-uation for much of what is now Belize during the Late Classic period butnot the core area of central Petén.Emblem Glyph–based Centralized ModelsJust as analyses of the distribution of Emblem Glyphs supported decen-tralized, weak-state models of lowland Maya political organization, theycan also support centralized models. Emblems, plus other recently deci-phered glyphs, have yielded evidence of political hierarchies, and thereis now a tendency among archaeologists to favor the existence of cen-tralized states among the Classic Maya. By analogy with Roys’s Yucatánmodels (1957; Marcus 1993), these hypothesized states most closely rep-resent Category A, the kuchkab’als or large territorial polities or maxi-mal chiefdoms that survived and flourished after the breakup of theMayapán confederacy, and also Mayapán in its heyday. The main pointof contention is the size of the state.One of the first Emblem Glyph–based models of political organiza-tion was that of Barthel (1968), who recognized the hierarchical and di-rectional significance of Emblems. His observations were later expandedby Joyce Marcus (1973, 1976, 1993 : 149 –150), who analyzed the patternsof occurrence of Emblems on monuments throughout the lowlands. Pos-tulating the existence of a quadripartite division of the Late Classicsouthern lowlands with four regional capitals, she noted that “althoughthe four capitals apparently could mention each other by name, no secondary center ever mentions a primary center except that to which it is subsidiary” (1973 : 913). The lack of such patterning during the early Early and Middle Classic periods suggested there were no regionalcapitals or four-tiered site hierarchies during those periods (Marcus1976 : 35). In succeeding centuries (Cycle 9), however, the four-tiered hi-erarchy developed with four regional capitals, as indicated by EmblemGlyphs.The occurrence of four sites’ Emblem Glyphs on Stela A at Copán (seeFig. 6.2) indicated to Barthel and Marcus that by a.d.731 the Maya rec-ognized four “capitals” of four large territories that encompassed the entire central and southern lowlands. These capitals were Tikal, Copán,Palenque, and — as suggested by Marcus — Calakmul, each associatedwith a cardinal direction: west, south, north, and east, respectively.Within each territory was a hierarchy of sites — secondary and tertiarycenters — that recorded the primary site’s Emblem Glyph (Fig. 2.7).Some politico-ritual unity among these territories is indicated by a LateClassic “Period of Uniformity,” from a.d.687 to 756, in which the Mayaadopted a standard lunar calendar; as Barthel (1968 : 187) commented,02-T2963 6/15/04 2:14 PM Page 47"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"figure2.7 Centralized model of geopolitical organization of the southern Mayalowlands: four capitals identified by textual mention of Emblem Glyphs.

By the Terminal Classic, the total ge-ographic sphere comprising the lowland capitals had diminished, as in-dicated by the shorter distances between the named capitals on SeibalStela 10, dated a.d.849 (see Table 2.2; Fig. 7.4): Tikal, Calakmul, Seibal,and possibly Motul de San José. The Barthel-Marcus postulate of fourmajor capitals is one of the more centralized models of Maya politicalorganization.In light of this influential model, it is useful to recall that Morley(1946) had earlier suggested four regional divisions of the Maya low-lands. The Barthel-Marcus model, however, was based on textual evi-dence from Late Classic monuments (Barthel also referred to glyphs onbones from Burial 116 at Tikal), particularly the display of EmblemGlyphs. Barthel (1968 : 192 –193) noted that similar identifications offour named centers with cardinal directions could be found in thechilam b’alams. This raised the possibility that a sistema cosmo-sociológico,a cosmologically based system or quadripartite geopolit-ical model, was the basis of lowland Maya political organization at leastfrom the Late Classic — and probably much earlier — through Post-classic and Colonial times. It has been noted that the directional identi-fication of these capitals does not correspond to geographic reality, butthat may be irrelevant. What might be more important is the order inwhich they are listed, with east — the direction of sunrise —first, sincethis corresponds to the cosmological and mythological significance ofdawn (as in the Popol Vuh;Tedlock 1985) and the counterclockwise or-der of movement in ritual processions.Subsequently, Norman Hammond used a framework of four re-gions —western, Pasión, northeast Petén, and southeastern — for orga-02-T2963 6/15/04 2:15 PM Page 49"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"50maya political sciencenizing his preface to Culbert’s (1991b) edited volume on Maya politicalhistory. As Hammond (1991 : 5) explained, “That only these four regionsare taken for detailed scrutiny is due to the restricted distribution of Em-blem Glyphs.”Richard E. W. Adams (Adams and Jones 1981; Adams 1986, 1990) pro-posed the existence of eight large “regional states” in the Late Classiclowlands: Puuc-Chenes, Cobá, Calakmul, Río Bec, Palenque, Yaxchilán,Tikal, and Copán (Fig. 2.8). These constituted large territories averagingroughly 30,000 km2, which were organized around “state capitals” andhad a hierarchy of dependent centers. Adams and Jones (1981 : 318) com-mented that at one point in the Late Classic period, Tikal could possi-bly have dominated a much larger territory incorporating the Pasión,Calakmul, and Río Bec zones to the north and west, as well as parts ofBelize to the east, a total area of more than 100,000 km2.Apart from this notion, arguments favoring models of large, hege-monic Late Classic polities reached their pinnacle in Simon Martin andNikolai Grube’s (1995) hypothesis that two Maya “superstates,” Tikaland Calakmul, dominated affairs throughout the lowlands during thefigure2.8 Centralized model of geopolitical organization of the Classic Maya low-lands: eight regional states (after Adams 1990).02-T2963 6/15/04 2:15 PM Page 50"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"reconstructions of classic maya political organization51Classic period. These sites are, of course, among those that have longbeen identified by Maya archaeologists as dominant, centralized poli-ties. More recently, Martin and Grube (2000 : 19 –20) have describedClassic lowland Maya political organization in terms of a “pervasive andenduring system of ‘overkingship’” and hierarchical relationships. Theybase their interpretation in part on the phrase u-kab’iythat occurs withthe name of a foreign ruler at a particular site. This phrase, “he super-vised it,” refers to a higher overlord, or “overking,” whose superordinatestatus is acknowledged by a local king. Such statements are used in thecontexts of certain rituals, such as the installation of a new king, whichtook place under the aegis of, and/or were supervised by, the overlord. Inaddition, they note that certain titles, such as sajal and ajaw, may haveprefixes — for example, usajal, yajaw—which they interpret as indicat-ing subordination (“his ajaw”) to those of higher rank.Many other archaeologists have advocated the existence of large,powerful, hierarchically organized, centralized Classic Maya states,among them Arlen F. Chase and Diane Z. Chase for Caracol (1996), T. Patrick Culbert for Tikal (1988, 1991b), and William Folan and col-leagues for Calakmul (1995). In general, the archaeologists who moststrongly support centralized state models have themselves worked atlarge sites such as Tikal and Calakmul.Time and Its CyclesTwo critical elements — process and time — are largely missing from allthese reconstructions of Maya political organization, whether central-ized or decentralized, direct-historical or drawn from afar. The modelsreviewed here provide intriguing glimpses into possible structures of theClassic lowland Maya system of political organization, but they havefailed to provide an understanding of how that organization “worked,”that is, the role of individual and institutional agency in how decisionswere made, how power was negotiated, how resources were deployed,how successions were effected, how sites interacted.Three recent discussions have attempted to interject a dynamic element and recognition of temporal change into lowland Maya politi-cal organization. One is Marcus’s (1993, 1995) “dynamic model” of os-cillating rise and fall, or centralization-consolidation versus decentral-ization, of Classic period states. It is not entirely clear, however, whythese rise-and-fall scenarios exist. Textual sources imply that “treach-ery” is involved (Marcus 1993 : 134 –135) and that the “lords at second-ary centers . . . were the weak link” in the hierarchy of primary, second-ary, and tertiary centers (Marcus 1993 : 164). This observation echoesArthur A. Demarest’s (1992 : 151) discussion of the similarity between02-T2963 6/15/04 2:15 PM Page 51"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"52maya political sciencethe Classic Maya and Southeast Asian galactic polities, in which subor-dinate polities and their rulers represented a “large potential pool ofusurpers . . . [with] . . . their own claims to divine authority, which cre-ated circumstances conducive to rebellion by satellites.” Also, Coe’s(1965) model calls attention to rotation of offices as resolving such prob-lems of succession.Another contribution to these discussions is the neoevolutionary“dual-processual theory” offered by Richard E. Blanton and his col-leagues (1996), based on the relative dominance of one of two political-economic strategies in a particular society. An “exclusionary” strategyis based on elite monopolization of power sources, whether material-objective or symbolic (knowledge, ritual), through networks of interac-tion and “patrimonial rhetoric.” The “corporate” strategy, based onsharing of power and sources of power across various social sectors, “em-phasizes collective representations and the accompanying ritual basedon broad themes such as fertility and renewal in society and cosmos”(Blanton et al. 1996 : 6). In applying their theory to the lowland Maya,these authors see a Late Preclassic corporate strategy (see also Becker1983) leading to the development of the ajaw kingship office, followedby a Classic period exclusionary network strategy, with the reemergenceof corporate strategies in the Postclassic period (Blanton et al. 1996 : 12).They fail to account for why these shifts in strategies occurred, however.Gyles Iannone (2002) attempts to resolve the unanswered question,why? by means of the dialectic between kinship and kingship throughthe temporal concepts of the Annales school (Braudel 1972): longuedurée, moyenne durée(conjonctures), and événement(event). The firsttwo of these concepts postulate long-term structures and medium-termcycles of change within which events occur. Iannone has interpretedthese in terms of kinship and kingship, respectively, and suggests theyaccount for the shifts between centralized and decentralized politicalorganization in Classic Maya states.But what has been lacking in virtually all these models is the dynamiccomponent ofprocessto explain how lowland Maya political organiza-tion functioned in strategies of negotiating power ,providing adjust-ments and checks and balances to changing circumstances over genera-tions ,regardless of scale. Such a dynamic can be recognized only whenthe quintessence of Maya cosmology — cyclical time — is integrated intothese otherwise static descriptions. Recording ,predicting ,and retrodict-ing events in time was ,for the Maya ,a matter of virtually obsessive im-port. As seen on their public portrayals ,Maya kings were “rulers oftime” (Miller 1986; Stuart 1996 : 165). They were also ruled by it.Temporal cycles have deep meaning for all of Mesoamerica, wherecyclical creations and cyclical time modeled history.

Not only do humans have the burden of official duties, so doeseach day, year, k’atun, and other unit of time. Each temporal unit is per-sonified as a divine bearer or porter with responsibility for shoulderinga minuscule fraction of the cosmos (a period of time) and its augury,such as drought or war or pestilence. These periods in turn are portrayedas a bundle carried on the bearer’s back with a tumpline.But many of the so-called cycles highlighted in Maya prehistory are not true cycles in a dictionary sense, that is, regularly recurring pe-riods of time “in which certain events repeat themselves in the same order and intervals” (Random House Dictionary). Rather, they are two-dimensional pseudocycles, linear sine-wave patterns on X-Y coordinates(Fig. 2.9) charting the peaks and valleys — the beginning, middle, andend — of cultural rise and fall (e.g., Marcus’s [1992b, 1993, 1995] “dy-namic model”; also Sharer 1992; Demarest 1992; Pohl and Pohl 1994).The role that truly cyclical concepts of time (see Chap. 3) might haveplayed in Maya political activities and histories has by no means beenignored by Maya archaeologists, art historians, epigraphers, and ethnog-raphers, but neither has its salience been fully apprehended.While many Mesoamerican peoples believed that there was a seriesof creations and destructions of the world, among the Maya this conceptof cyclical time, particularly cycles of the k’atun, seems to have been re-vered even more profoundly. The historian Nancy M. Farriss (1987 : 577),for example, believes that the cycling of cosmic time, particularlythrough the k’atuns, provided a charter for the Maya political system.Claude F. Baudez (1991) suggests that the completion of annual andk’atun cycles was celebrated at Copán and elsewhere by ritual proces-sions through the quadripartite divisions of the city. Arlen Chase (1991)looked at “cycles of time” in relation to the development of Caracol, inwest-central Belize, calling attention to events occurring in K’atuns 8Ajaw, the “k’atunof change.”In “Cycles of Growth at Tikal,” Christopher Jones (1991 : 121–124)noted that beginning around 400 b.c., major building programs andchanges in the ceramic complexes seem to evidence two-hundred-yearcycles. Jones linked the Tikal architectural cycles to halves of Mayafour-hundred-year b’ak’tun units and remarked that they also couldmark multiples of the fifty-two-year unit known as the Calendar Round.William Haviland (1992), in an article subtitled “Dynastic Troubles and02-T2963 6/15/04 2:15 PM Page 53"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"54maya political sciencethe Cycle of Katuns at Tikal, Guatemala,” considered similar themes.Citing Roys’s ([1933] 1967 : 184) observation that Maya belief in cyclicaltime “was so strong at times as to actually influence the course of his-tory,” Haviland (1992 : 79) called attention to the inaugurations of two ofTikal’s rulers in successive K’atuns 8 Ajaw, roughly 256 years apart, not-ing the possibility that the later king saw himself as a reincarnation ofthe earlier one.figure2.9 Schematic, linear models of the history of Maya civilization.

As he (1979 : 67) com-mented, because this timing is far too extraordinary to have been merecoincidence, “it seems undeniable that a thirteen-katun historical cyclewas recognized and was of great significance during the Classic period.”Precisely the same suggestion was published in the same year by MunroEdmonson.Despite the insights of Puleston, Haviland, Edmonson, and others,Maya archaeologists have failed to recognize the profound implicationsof the thirteen-k’atun, 256-year interval— the may— for Classic periodpolitico-religious hegemony (cf. Lowe, Lee, and Martínez Espinosa 1982;Ball 1986; Rice, Rice, and Jones 1996). While some scholars might preferto view time and calendrical cycling merely as one of many tools ma-nipulated by Classic Maya rulers to achieve their political ends, suchmachinations are never “mere,” as revealed in comparative histories oftime and cosmological thinking (Hawking 1996; Waugh 1999). The mayanalogy, drawn from historically known Postclassic lowland Maya prac-tices, provides a more parsimonious foundation for understanding Clas-sic Maya political geography than the ill-fitting exogenous models withwhich archaeologists have long struggled. Since first postulated in 1979,the maymodel for the Classic Maya has been supported and strength-ened by the burgeoning corpus of textual data pertaining to dynasties,dynastic interrelations, and political centralization. Most important, asdescribed in the following chapters, it injects process and dynamics intothe heretofore static structural and classificatory models of Classic low-land Maya political organization.reconstructions of classic maya political organization5502-T2963 6/15/04 2:15 PM Page 55"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"chapter 3Maya Politico-Religious CalendricsA direct-historical approach to Classic lowland Maya political organiza-tion begins with proximate groups — close in time, location, language,and culture — for which there is ample information about not only po-litical structures and functions but also their archaeological correlates.Such groups are the Postclassic and Colonial period Maya of the north-ern Yucatán peninsula, whose geopolitical organization was orderedthrough a complex web of calendrical cycles and their regular celebra-tion. This chapter focuses on the nature of Maya calendrical science, onthe calendrics of the Postclassic Maya of the northern lowlands, and onthe principal Maya textual sources for information on ritual surround-ing 256-year maycycles, the books of the chilam b’alams.Maya Cosmology and Calendrical ScienceMaya political organization was rooted in cosmology, religion, and tem-poral cycling, themselves inextricably bound: “time is cosmic order,”asserts Farriss (1987 : 574). And Barbara Tedlock (1992 : 1) notes, “The an-cient Maya were great horologists, students of time[,] . . . interested notonly in the quantities of time but also in its qualities, especially itsmeaning for human affairs.” The Maya viewed time as both linear (thefamiliar western conception of historical time) and cyclical. Cyclicaltime seems peculiar — even prelogical— in the modern world, casuallydismissible by the epigram “History repeats itself.” But belief in cycli-cal time, and its integration with linear time, is widespread in prehis-tory and among modern non-Western peoples (Eliade 1954; Geertz1973 : 389 –398). In fact, the Maya view of time and a quadripartite uni-verse is not too distant from that of today’s physicists, who see the rel-atively undifferentiated past, present, and future “laid out in a four-dimensional block composed of time and the three spatial dimensions”(Davies 2002 : 43).Still, the Maya transcended the familiar recurrence of day and night,03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 56"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"and rainy and dry seasons, to calculate and commensurate the infinitelyinterlocking periodicities of months, years, eclipses, and movements ofastral bodies, simultaneously retrodicting them thousands of years intothe past and predicting them thousands of years into the future (seeLounsbury 1978; Aveni 1981; Milbrath 1999). Maya skills in predictiveastronomy allowed them to foreknow upcoming celestial events, whichprovided a justification for scheduling important rituals and a “sacredmandate for elite decision-making” (Justeson 1989 : 104). In addition, as-tronomers’ calculation tables permitted them to project events back-ward in time, thereby manufacturing “precursors” and “precedents” forthe timing of ritual and other activities in the present and future (Juste-son 1989 : 104). This is how the Maya created and re-created their calen-dars, their histories, their elite affairs, and even their verbal arts (Fought1985), an unceasingly recursive process that permitted them to “re-member their future and anticipate their past” (Farriss 1987 : 589; seealso Bloch 1977).Ancient Mesoamerican peoples from Mexico through Costa Ricashared a basic native calendrical system. According to Edmonson (1988 :4), “[D]espite its employment by nearly 100 ethnic groups speaking al-most as many different languages, it has retained . . . [its] unity over a pe-riod of more than 2600 years. This is not just a matter of pattern simi-larity but of precise mathematical accuracy in the measurement oftime.” Irrespective of this essential unity, there were sufficient differ-ences in the basic Mesoamerican calendars that at least sixty variantsare known (Edmonson 1988:Fig. 3). The ancient Maya, primus interparesof this system, also maintained numerous calendars based onalignments, visibilities, and movements of the sun, moon, Venus, Mars,and other celestial bodies, as well as occurrences of eclipses and otherphenomena. Precise records tracked both linear and cyclical time, buttemporal cycling was paramount.The intricacies of Maya calendrics, including correlations with mod-ern calendars, need not be pursued here, but certain points are crucial tounderstanding Maya concepts of time and the temporal units incorpo-rated into the may(for a fuller discussion of Maya calendrics, seeThompson 1960; Edmonson 1988; Sharer 1994 : 513 – 629; Marcus 1992a:132 –140; B. Tedlock 1992; Lounsbury 1978; Aveni 1981; Milbrath 1999).Maya CalendarsThe fundamental unit of Maya time was the day, or k’in. The k’in inter-related and embodied notions of sun, day, and time and became “not anabstract entity but a reality enmeshed in the world of myths, a divinebeing, origin of the cycles which govern all existing things” (León-maya politico-religious calendrics5703-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 57"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"58maya political sciencePortilla 1988 : 33; B. Tedlock 1992 : 2 –3). The Maya kept track of the passage of linear time by counting each elapsed day since a mythicalevent — their zero point or datum — that occurred in 3114 b.c.in themodern (Gregorian) calendar. The succession of days in the Maya calen-dars was recorded by means of cycles and epicycles of numbers andnames, each having sacred patron deities who bore the burden, or kuch,of that day’s auguries and ceremonies and of time itself. Thus the Mayadays, and indeed all units of time, were not mere abstractions but liv-ing — albeit supernatural—beings.Counts of days, like all counts, were recorded by the Maya in their“bar-dot” system of numerical notation. This made use of three sym-bols: a “shell” to represent 0, a dot for 1, and a bar for 5; bars and dotswere combined to represent numbers from 1 to 20. Above 20, a position-value notation system was used, increasing vertically from smaller tolarger numbers. This can be compared to the Western horizontal posi-tional system, by which we read numbers decreasing by powers of ten,moving from left to right (Table 3.1). Our system is decimal, or base 10;the Maya system, like all Mesoamerican counting systems, is conceptu-ally vigesimal, or base 20, with numbers increasing by powers of 20 frombottom to top. If there were no counts within one of the 20-unit posi-tions, then the shell symbol was placed, signifying null or completion.Not surprisingly, then, the Maya recorded specific dates with referenceto a hierarchy of units of elapsed days that were mostly (though not en-tirely) multiples of 20 (Table 3.2).Like all peoples of Mesoamerica, the Maya accounted for time’s pas-Table 3.1.Differences between Western decimal and Maya vigesimal-positional systems of recording time: the day July 2, A.D. 1957.Modern (Gregorian)Maya Vigesimal, Positional:Decimal versusCount of Elapsed Days*1 unit of 1,000 years12 units of 144,000 days9 units of 100 years17 units of 7,200 days5 units of 10 years3 units of 360 days7 units of 1 year12 units of 20 days6 units of 1 month19 units of 1 day2 units of 1 day in the seventh month*Elapsed days since a starting date in August 3114 B.C.03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 58"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"maya politico-religious calendrics59Table 3.2.Maya tun-based temporal units.

One of these is a calen-dar of 260 days, which archaeologists call the tzolk’in(count of days),the “sacred round” or “sacred almanac.” It is not clear what the Mayacalled it, although it may have been referred to as sak ja’ab’(“white” or“magnificent” year) (Justeson 1989 : 77). The basic units of this calendarwere a numerical count from 1 to 13 preceding a succession of twentyday-names (read down columns):ImixChikchanMulukB’enKab’anIk’KimiOkIxEtznab’Akb’alManik’ChuwenMenKawakK’anLamatEb’Kib’AjawThe result was a calendar that proceeded for 260 days before the samenumber-day name combination recurred. This almanac had primary im-portance in prognostication and in tracking mythoritual time.The second calendar, jab’or ja’ab’(year), was based on a “vagueyear,” or solar year, of 365 days. It had 360 days (a period called a tun)grouped into eighteen winals,or months.03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 59"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"60maya political sciencePopSekCh’enMakK’ayab’WoXulYaxK’ank’inKumk’uSipYaxk’inSakMuwanWayeb’Sotz’MolKejPaxEach of the eighteen winals comprised twenty numbered days startingwith 0, to which were added five unlucky days in a wee winal or nine-teenth “month” named Wayeb’ (“nameless days”). Wayeb’ days precededthe first day of the New Year, always 0 Pop in the Maya ja’ab’. The ja’ab’closely approximated the solar or seasonal year and governed secularevents.A total of 18,980 days, or 52 of the 365-day years, elapsed before anyparticular number and day in one calendar — say, 4 Ajaw in the 260-dayalmanac — coincided again with a particular day and month — say, 3 Kank’in — in the solar calendar (Fig. 3.1). This 52-year permutationalcycle of the Mesoamerican calendars is called the Calendar Round, orjunab’.Because Calendar Rounds ended and began only once every52 years (probably once in most humans’ lifetimes), this renewal eventat the end of the dangerous Wayeb’ days (known as Nemontemi amongthe Aztec) was grandly celebrated, and the celebrations were accompa-nied by dedication of new or refurbished temples and lighting new fires.The earliest recorded Calendar Round date may be on an ear ornamentfrom Cuicuilco, which Edmonson (1988 : 20) dates to 679 b.c.The Cal-endar Round and the notion of cyclical time are still integral to cosmol-ogy, ritual, and administrative life in portions of Mesoamerica and theMaya area, particularly in fairly remote parts of the highlands (Girard1962; Vogt 1964, 1969; Gossen and Leventhal 1993).Because the Maya solar year, or ja’ab’, consisted of eighteen winals(“months” of twenty days each) plus five additional days(Wayeb’), thename of the first day of the year in the tzolk’in annually shifted fiveplaces ahead of that of the current year. Over the long term, then, onlyfour of the twenty day names in the 260-day tzolk’in could occupy thisstarting position. In the Classic period, these were Ak’b’al, Lamat, B’en,and Etz’nab’. These four days in the sacred almanac were referred to as“yearbearers” because they had the responsibility of bearing the burdenof the years. In the Postclassic period, the calendars were revised and theyear-bearing days changed to K’an, Muluk, Ix, and Kawak.The most evocative discussion of Maya concepts of time is Thomp-son’s (1960 : 59): “The Maya conceived of the divisions of time as burdenswhich were carried through all eternity by relays of bearers . . . [not] the journey of one bearer and his load, but of many bearers, each withhis own division of time on his back.” Copán Stela D (Fig. 3.2) and its03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 60"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"figure3.1 The Maya 365-day calendar (ja’ab’) and 260-day calendar (tzolk’in), depicted as interlocking, cycling wheels.03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 61"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"figure3.2 Full-figure glyphs from Copán Stela D, Initial Series date of 9.15.5.0.0(10 Ajaw 8 Ch’en), showing time as burdens carried by tumpline on the backs of thegods.

The god of number 9, thebearer of the baktun, still has his load on his back, held there by the tumpline. . . . His hand is raised as though to slip off the load.(Thompson 1960 : 59)Of particular interest in discussions of Classic political organizationare longer intervals of time, which the Maya celebrated on their endingdates. These were multiples of the 360-day “years,” or tuns. Tun (glyphT548; a hollow log-drum pictograph) may be read as ja’ab’and is of-ten read “year,” but it also refers to both “stone” (including stelae) and“finalization, ending, completion” (see Fox and Justeson 1984 : 51–52,53n32; Justeson 1989 : 77; Stuart 1996 : 149 –150). Perhaps the most im-portant of the tun periods is the k’atun, probably originally k’al-tun,oras on glyph T28 : 548, k’a-tun(Fig. 3.3), although we do not know whatthe Classic Maya actually called it. While it is typically read as “20 tunendings” or “closing stone,” celebrating completion of the count of7,200 days, Stuart (1996 : 156) offers another interpretation, “stone bind-ing,” suggesting that stelae were wrapped or enclosed. The longest tun-based interval commonly recorded by the Maya is 400 tuns, a tally of144,000 days or 394.5 solar years. No Maya word for this period is cer-tain; although the glyph is read pior pi-ya,scholars call it the b’ak’tun,from b’ak’(400) plus tun.On rare occasions the Maya recorded units of time larger than theb’ak’tun (see Table 3.2). These longer intervals are recorded on the sideof Tikal Stela 10 (Fig. 3.4) ,which dates to a.d.527. The upper portion ofthe glyph for k’alab’tundepicts a hand holding a pen with a tassel at theend of it (A-B8). A slightly modified version of this hand with a pointingfinger and tassel was a widely used glyph to symbolize “completion” incalendrical texts.Archaeologists employ a positional notation convention to indicateMaya dates recorded in this system, reading counts of elapsed units oftime from left to right, that is, the count of elapsed b’ak’tuns, k’atuns,tuns, winals, and k’ins. For example, a Maya date recorded as 9.13.0.0.08 Ajaw 8 Wo (March 16, 692) indicates that nine b’ak’tuns had passed03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 63"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"figure3.3 Glyphs for the k’atun: (a) phonetic variants; (b) head variants; (c) full-figure variants (from Thompson 1960 : Figs. 26 –28).03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 64"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"figure3.4 Tikal Stela 10, left and right sides.

The specific day inquestion is named 8 Ajaw in the 260-day calendar and 8 Wo in the 365-day calendar. Furthermore, this date is a “period-ending date,” markingthe completion of 13 k’atuns within b’ak’tun 9, as indicated by zeros inthe places for tuns, winals, and k’ins.Commemoration of period endings by the erection of carved stelaewas crucially important to the Classic Maya. While completions ofk’atuns, such as 9.13.0.0.0, were most commonly celebrated, five-yearintervals within k’atuns were also recorded at some sites. Such intervalsinclude the first five tuns, known as the jotun(e.g., 9.13.5.0.0), the tenthtun or half-k’atun interval, called the lajuntun(e.g., 9.13.10.0.0), andthree quarters of the k’atun, or jolajuntun(e.g., 9.13.15.0.0), read as “fivetuns lacking” (until completion of 20 tuns).This system of recording time by counts of elapsed days in units ofb’ak’tuns, k’atuns, tuns, and so on, is known as the Long Count, and, forarchaeologists, the beginning and ending of the Classic period is markedby the initiation and cessation of Long Count dating. That the MayaLong Count is truly “long” can be seen in inscriptions at Yaxchilán,Palenque, Quiriguá, and Cobá, for example, which project time forwardto the fifth millennium (a.d.4772) and retrodict site histories, creations,and births of deities in calculations of hundreds of millions of years intothe past (Schele and Miller 1986 : 320 –321; Martin and Grube 2000 : 70;Sharer 1994 : 571; Montgomery 2001a : 299).Toward the end of the Late Classic, the Maya began to simplify theiraccounting of time from the typical Long Count and Initial Series for-mat. Instead, they recorded only the k’atun and day-month names andnumbers in the two calendars, as, for example, K’atun 18, 11 Ajaw 18Mak. By the Postclassic and Colonial periods, after about a.d.950, dat-ing was abbreviated even further to the Short Count, referencing onlythe passing of k’atuns along with the Ajaw ending day, as, for example,K’atun 8 Ajaw.Importantly for the argument developed here, the passage of k’atunsin the Postclassic period was recorded through the k’atun cycle or round(u kajlay k’atunob’). A k’atun cycle is a count of thirteen k’atuns of7,200 k’ins per k’atun, or 93,600 days; this is 160 days short of 256 of oursolar years (Edmonson 1986a : 9). Thus approximately 256 years mustelapse between one k’atun and the next having exactly the same combi-nation of day name and number in the Maya 260-day calendar.

As noted,the Maya believed in multiple creations of the cosmos and that the onethey were living in, as marked by the initiation point of their calendri-cal records, began in August 3114 b.c.The present “creation” consistedof thirteen b’ak’tuns of 144,000 days each, or 1,872,000 days; it alsowould have consisted of twenty maycycles of 93,600 days each.The Maya always named their k’atuns for a day Ajaw (Lord), whichwas the last of the twenty day names in the tzolk’in. According to Stu-art (1996 : 166), “The day Ahaw was thus the ‘face’ or ‘lord’ of the PeriodEnding . . . [and] the day-name ‘Lord’ appears only in the Maya area . . .[where it] could ‘rule’ over a Period Ending” (in other Mesoamerican260-day calendars, the last day is usually Flower). Because of the per-mutations of the cycling of the two calendars, the k’atuns’ numericalcoefficients moved in retrograde order such that each was numbered twoless than the preceding (Table 3.3). K’atun 8 Ajaw ended the cycle, atwhich point the cycle began again with K’atun 6 Ajaw (the significanceof an 8 Ajaw ending date will become apparent later). In sixteenth-century Yucatán, the cycle of thirteen k’atuns was represented as awheel divided into thirteen sections (Fig. 3.5); at the Postclassic site ofMayapán the carapace of a carved stone turtle had thirteen Ajaw glyphs(Proskouriakoff 1962a : Fig. 1.g).Calendrical OriginsWhat was the origin of these Maya calendars? The Maya themselves say little if anything about this, although the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayelhas a chapter on “the birth of the winal” (Roys [1933]1967 : 116 –119; Edmonson 1986a : 120 –126). Edmonson (1988 : 12, 119),who has studied calendrical systems and their historical developmentthroughout Mesoamerica, argues that the marked similarities of allMesoamerican calendars suggest a single common origin and that theywere probably “altered rarely, grudgingly, and minimally” through time.The Maya recorded dates in their system as a calculation of elapseddays since 0.0.0.0.0 (or 13.0.0.0.0), 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk’u (August 11, 3114b.c.). This date lies back in mythohistorical time, as few Mesoamericanpeoples in the late fourth millennium b.c. were fully sedentary agricul-tural villagers, and none are presently known to have used permanentwritten, numerical, or calendrical recording systems. This date wouldhave marked the beginning of the present Fourth (or Fifth) Creation ofthe cosmos, the beginning of time itself.An interesting device in the context of Mesoamerican calen-drical computations is the “pecked cross” or “cross-in-circle” symbol03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 67"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Table 3.3.Retrograde order of naming K’atuns Ajaw within the 256-year cycle.

The“outer circle consists of 25 holes per quadrant, totaling 100; the innercircle consists of 20 holes per quadrant, totaling 80” (Aveni, Hartung,03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 69"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"figure3.6 (a) Pecked cross or cross-in-circle devices (after Aveni, Hartung, andBuckingham 1978; Grazioso Sierra 1995); (b) Maya quadripartite glyphs for “com-pletion” (after Coggins 1980 : Fig. 2).03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 70"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"maya politico-religious calendrics71and Buckingham 1978 : 267), and the axes typically consist of 10 holesplus 4 between the circles and another 4 beyond the outer one. The em-phasis on counts of 4, 18, and 20 is significant in these designs, and these260-hole devices can also accommodate calculations of periods in the365-day solar calendar (Worthy and Dickens 1983).It has not escaped attention that the pecked crosses resemble calen-drical diagrams known in Maya books of the chilam b’alams, in Mexi-can and Maya Postclassic codices, and in common quadripartite glyphsfor completion (Fig. 3.6b), and they demonstrate east-west connectionsbetween the axis of the cross and the summer solstice sunrise or sunset(Smith 1950 : 21–22; Aveni 2000 : 260 –261; Aveni, Hartung, and Buck-ingham 1978; Coggins 1980). Further experimentation might revealtheir use with other relevant periods of time, such as lunar, planetary, oreclipse cycles, or other phenomena. Dating these petroglyphs is diffi-cult; although most seem to be Early Classic — the time of Teotihuacanexpansion — some at Tlalancaleca, Puebla, may be considerably earlier,circa 500 to 100 b.c.(Aveni, Hartung, and Buckingham 1978 : 273).Here it is also useful to remember the discussion of quadripartitionin Chapter 1: quadripartition is a common feature of prehistoric cos-mologies worldwide. The earthly domain or built world typically mim-ics that four-part structure, as regions, cities, and architectural groupsare, like the universe, divided into four parts (Eliade 1979 : 335). Eliadesuggests that founding rituals include erecting a “fence in the form of acircle or a square broken by four doors which correspond to the four car-dinal directions” (p. 335). This ritual structure seems remarkably iso-morphic with the image conveyed by the pecked circle devices.The 260-day tzolk’in has deeply enduring and mythical roots inMesoamerican ritual. To people of the modern heliocentric Westernworld, calendrical cycles of 365 days (based on the sun) and 29 to 30 days(based on the moon) are familiar, but a calendar based on 260 days de-mands explanation. The foundations of this 260-day sacred almanaccould be as simple as a multiple of thirteen day gods times twenty fin-gers and toes (Thompson 1930a); however, since it is the twenty daysthat are named — for natural phenomena, in a sequence that is nearlyuniversal throughout Mesoamerica — this begs the question of wherethe thirteen gods came from. Other suggestions for the origins of the260-day calendar include the approximation of the human gestationalcycle from last menstruation (Thompson 1960 : 98; Earle and Snow 1985;Brotherston 1983; Tedlock 1985 : 232); the time of solar zenith passage at15\u0003North latitude, the location of Izapa and Copán (Nuttall 1928;Malmström 1973); the duration of an “agrarian year,” from Februarythrough late October (Tichy 1981 : 236 –237; also Sˇprajc 2000; Milbrath1999 : 13 –14; Girard 1962 : 328 –342; Thompson 1930b : 41); cycles of 03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 71"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"72maya political sciencevisibility of the planet Venus (Aveni 1981; Flores 1989; Tedlock 1985 : 40,233 –34; cf. Justeson 1989 : 78); and average segments —7, 9, 13, and20 days — of lunar cycles (Macri in press).Mesoamerican calendars most likely had their origins in the begin-nings of historical record keeping in Preclassic Mexico, to judge fromcarved dates and other writing in central and western Mexico(Cuicuilco, Chalcatzingo), Oaxaca (San José Mogote, Monte Albán), andthe Gulf coastal lowlands (see Edmonson 1986b, 1988 : 20 –21; Justeson1986, 1989 : 79; Pohl, Pope, and von Nagy 2002). The earliest recordedcalendrical dates in these areas refer to the years 679 and 667 b.c.Theisthmian area of Mesoamerica in particular has long been seen as a zoneof early calendrical elaboration and differentiation (Rice n.d.a), thoughresearchers differ as to which side of the isthmus may claim precedence.Edmonson (1986b : 85) believes the Gulf Coast Olmec calendar is an-cestral to all other Mesoamerican calendars. The Olmec calendar countsdays of the month from 0 to 19 and names the year for the yearbearersof the last day (terminal naming). Edmonson (1988 : 117) thinks it isprobable that Olmec calendric specialists had invented the 52-year Cal-endar Round by 739 b.c., and by 433 b.c.Mesoamerican astronomers“had attained the accuracy of modern astronomy in [their] estimate of the length of the tropical year: 365.2422 days.” He also suggests thatthe Olmec began using the Long Count of 7,891 years in 355 b.c.Hebases this on the coincidence of the completion of a Calendar Roundwith that of the last k’atun of a b’ak’tun, an event that only happensevery 936 years. Its occurrence on 6.19.19.0.0 1 Ajaw 3 Kej (June 8, 355b.c.) probably represents the initiation of the Long Count, as well asother important intervals such as the may(thirteen k’atuns) and theb’ak’tun (twenty k’atuns); a cycle of thirteen b’ak’tuns is equivalent totwenty mays(Edmonson 1988 : 101, 118 –119, 124; see also Justeson andCampbell 1997 : 52). Similar coinciding cycles of b’ak’tun and Calen-dar Round occurred in a.d.582 and, fatefully for the Aztecs, in 1519.Several early monuments were erected in the Gulf Coast region, includ-ing the La Mojarra stela, with Long Count dates ranging from a.d.143(8.5.3.3.5 13 Chikchan 3 K’ayab’) to 157 (8.5.17.15.2 12 Ik’ 5 Yaxk’in)(Kaufman and Justeson 2001 : 2.74), and the Tuxtla Statuette (a.d.162).Other arguments about the isthmian origins of Mesoamerican calen-dars focus on the Pacific coast. One suggestion (Malmström 1978) is thatthe 260-day almanac began in 1358 b.c.around the Mexico-Guatemalaborder (see also Tichy 1981 : 237) and that the 365-day vague year begana few decades thereafter. In this view, the initiation of the Long Count,by which time is accounted simultaneously in both calendars, wouldhave occurred on September 12, 236 b.c.This date was the k’atun end-ing of 7.6.0.0.0 11 Ajaw 8 Kumk’u, when calendar priests may have at-03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 72"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"maya politico-religious calendrics73tempted to standardize the calendars and extrapolate backward to an“origin” date, thereby establishing the “beginnings of time” in 3114 b.c.on another day 8 Kumk’u. K’atuns ending on 7.6.0.0.0 (236 b.c.) and 7.5.0.0.0 (256 b.c.) had been proposed many decades previously byJohn E. Teeple and Thompson, respectively, as starting dates for theLong Count (cited in Kubler 1977 : 16).The earliest surviving Maya dates (depending on how “Maya” and“date” are defined) may lie in late b’ak’tun 7, and they correspond to 36 b.c.on a fragmentary Long Count date on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo(in Chiapas, Mexico) and a.d.36 on Stela 1 at El Baúl on the Pacific coastof Guatemala. Edmonson (1988 : 100 –101, 121–122) sees the early in-scriptions and dates from Chiapas and the Pacific coast as examples ofthe existence of a Preclassic “Kaminaljuyú calendar,” which he namedafter the highland Maya site in the valley of Guatemala City, the pres-ent capital of Guatemala. Kaminaljuyú might have been a meetingground for multiple cultural and linguistic groups, where they shared acommon creation mythology but struggled among themselves for cal-endrical and ritual dominance (see Coggins 1996 : 33).Edmonson believes the Kaminaljuyú calendar is the ancestor of twomajor versions of the solar calendar used in Classic period Mesoamerica.One is central Mexican —what he calls the “Teotihuacan calendar,”named after that huge city northeast of Mexico City — the precursor of which he identifies on Kaminaljuyú Stela 10 dating to 147 b.c.TheTeotihuacan calendar used initial (rather than terminal) dating, as didthe other major Classic calendar (Tikal), but it diverged from the Olmeccalendar before the incorporation of the Long Count dating system inthe fourth century b.c.The Tikal calendar diverged from the Olmec acentury or so later and was initiated in 236 b.c.(7.6.0.0.0 11 Ajaw 8Kumk’u) (Edmonson 1986b : 86, 1988 : 23). From Tikal Stela 29, dating toa.d.292, he concludes that the Tikal calendar would have been inaugu-rated on July 13, a.d.84.All three post-Olmec calendars, Kaminaljuyú, Tikal, and Teotihua-can, shared a pattern of counting days of the month from 0 to 19 (likethe Olmec calendar) and dated solar years from the beginning or initialday. The accurate estimation, by 433 b.c., of the length of the tropicalyear may be related to abandonment of terminal naming of the solar year(Edmonson 1988 : 117). The Long Count was shared by the Olmec andTikal calendars but was not known at Kaminaljuyu or Teotihuacan. It“diffused to the Maya from the [Epi-]Olmec quite separately from the genetic derivation of the Tikal calendar round from Kaminaljuyu” (Edmonson 1988 : 120).The “classical” or “Tikal” calendar of the Classic Maya, then, was inuse from b’ak’tun 7 through 11.17.0.0.0 (a.d.1539; see Edmonson03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 73"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"74maya political science1986a). The 365-day calendar used initial naming and 0 –19 numbering,which means that it began on day 0 of month Pop. Terminal naming wasused for cycles in the 260-day almanac and Short Count, which meansthat k’atuns, b’ak’tuns, and mayswere identified by their last day. Thefinal k’atun of the 13-k’atun cycle or round ended on a day 8 Ajaw, so itwas always known as a K’atun 8 Ajaw. Also, a K’atun 8 Ajaw alwaysended the 256-year maycycle and a K’atun 6 Ajaw always began it; thatis, the final day 8 Ajaw of the thirteenth k’atun in the cycle was alwaysfollowed by a day 1 Imix of a new k’atun, which ended on a day 6 Ajaw,hence a K’atun 6 Ajaw.Calendrical TransformationsMaya calendars underwent numerous adjustments during the course oftheir history. For example, the Maya recognized that there was a gap ofa quarter of a day between their 365-day calendar and the true solar ortropical year. This discrepancy would have meant a difference of one dayevery four years, or 100 days (more than three months) every 400 years,an unsettling state of affairs for farmers depending on calendrical au-guries to plant and harvest their crops. Two of the month names in theja’ab’ apparently originally referred to agricultural seasons: the seventhmonth, yaxk’in,‘first, green day’ (time of planting) and the fourteenthmonth, k’ank’in,‘yellow, ripening, maturity’ (time of harvest).During the Early Classic period at Tikal and surrounding sites, Mayaastronomers inaugurated the new Uniform System of recording lunareclipses and other lunar dates, perhaps as early as 8.16.0.0.0 (a.d.357)and certainly by 9.4.13.0.0 (a.d.527) (Justeson 1989 : 87– 88). This sys-tem may go back to Late Preclassic efforts to track lunar eclipse cycles.Alternative systems were known at Altar de Sacrificios and Palenque tothe west and also at Copán to the southeast.In the seventh centurya.d. ,new calendars — the Palenque and theCampeche — may have emerged in or been introduced to the lowlands(Edmonson 1988 : 36 –37 ,103 ,126). Both calendars abandoned the 0 –19counting of days in favor of 1–20 and used terminal naming of the solaryears. This latter practice is distinctively non-Maya: Edmonson (1988 :103) calls it an “intrusive foreign idea,” attributing it to Ch’olan speak-ers and calendars used in the Gulf Coast or Oaxaca region. The Palenquecalendar ,believed to have been inaugurated on the summer solstice ,June 22,a.d.177 (8.6.17.13.18 12 Etz’nab 1 Pop) ,was first documented atthe k’atun ending ina.d.692 (Edmonson 1979 : 13 ,1988 : 126). This cal-endar ,which was also used at Yaxchilán ,Naranjo ,and Piedras Negrasbut primarily as a “secondary calendar,” retained the Tikal yearbearersIk’ ,Manik’ ,Eb’ ,and Kab’an (Edmonson 1988 : 103 ,126).03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 74"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"maya politico-religious calendrics75The Campeche (or Uxmal, Puuc) calendar was inaugurated on thespring equinox, March 20, a.d.568 (9.6.14.3.14 1 Ix 2 Pop) and first doc-umented at Uxmal in a.d.649 (Edmonson 1988 : 126 –127; cf. Bricker1989 : 235, who claims a.d.672). Derived from the Palenque calendarand ancestral to that of Postclassic Mayapán, the Campeche calendar ad-vanced the calendar by one day (essentially a leap year correction) in theja’ab’, resulting in new Late Classic yearbearers: B’en, Etz’nab’, Ak’b’al,and Lamat (Bricker 1989 : 235; Edmonson 1988 : 103). This calendar wasused in much of the western lowlands (e.g., Uxmal, Kabah, Edzná, Jaina,Toniná, Holactún, Yaxchilán, Bonampak), and it may represent Zapotecor Mixtec influence (Edmonson 1988 : 148).The Late Postclassic Dresden Codex yearbearer pages depict year-bearers of the Late Classic Tikal calendar in the upper register and thoseof the Campeche calendar in the lower two registers (see Fig. 1.2, above),as if correlating the two calendars. The Madrid Codex uses yet anotherset of yearbearers (K’an, Muluk, Ix, Kawak), which represent a shift ofone day from those of the Late Classic and may be traceable to westernYucatán.At the beginning of the Colonial period, continuing conflicts over calendrical issues between the Xiw and the Itza/Kokom, the two prin-cipal lineages in Yucatán, led to a compromise known as the Mayapáncalendar in 1539. Edmonson (1988 : 127) believes that the Mayapán calendar was actually invented sometime before December 21, a.d.937(10.5.9.6.4 7 K’an 2 Pop) but “not successfully promulgated” until 1539.There are “no native correlations” with the Mayapán calendar, and al-though it is the “direct successor to” the Tikal calendar, it seems tohave been derived through the Campeche calendar (Edmonson 1988 :203). Two centuries later, in 1752, at the behest of the Itza, yet anothercalendar came into use at Valladolid, allowing Itza sun priests to ruletwenty-four instead of twenty years; this calendar ceased to be used ac-tively in 1848 (Edmonson 1982 : 11).The Postclassic Maya MayDuring the early Colonial period in the northern lowlands, informantsdescribed the political organization at Mayapán to the Spaniards as hav-ing been centralized, hierarchical, and chartered by the endlessly repet-itive cycles of cosmic time. Although there is some debate (see Chap. 2),remnants of this organization seem to have survived, as politico-ritualpower continued to be concentrated in important cities that seated the maycycle; that is, they were “capitals” of a region for a period of256 years.

(1987 : 39)This “treatise” that Avendaño purports to have written has never beenfound (ibid. : n.121).The Mayand Its SeatsThe word mayincorporates broad reference to the calendar, the number20, and objects with four corners, the latter perhaps a symbolic referenceto completion or quadripartition. Etymologically, maycan be traced tohighland Maya languages, including Colonial K’iche’ and particularlyKaqchikel, in which mayrefers to a cycle of twenty “years” of four hun-dred days (Recinos and Goetz 1953 : 31; Lounsbury 1978 : 762; Lowe1982 : 281). Maymight also relate to Kaqchikel meho‘to go out and re-turn’, or to cycle (Brinton [1885] 1969 : 31). Other related terms includeamayte‘the first 20 years’; ahau k’atunand amaytun‘squared stone onwhich the ahau k’atunwas placed’; lamay‘four-cornered’; lamay tun‘squared stone; the course of the twenty years engraved on a stone’; andkan amay‘thing of four corners’ (Lowe 1982 : 321).The most thorough linguistic discussion comes from John S. Justesonand Lyle Campbell (1997 : 49 –52), who note that the term is widely dif-fused in Mesoamerica and probably entered Greater Lowland Mayanlanguages from Mixe-Zoquean in the Gulf Coast area. Because Cycle 7and 8 monuments in this area used the Long Count, Justeson and Camp-bell presume that Mixe-Zoquean languages and script had a term fork’atun.

It was notuntil after 9.3.0.0.0 (e.g., Uaxactún Stela 3, at 9.3.13.0.0; a.d.507) thatthe later form of T28 began to be used consistently. The authors deducefrom this that k’aand maboth meant “twenty” and call on an analogywith the K’iche’an term maymeaning “20 (of years).” They concludethat the lowland Maya term mayreferred to a twenty-year cycle — thek’atun itself — explicitly rejecting Edmonson’s interpretation of mayasa thirteen-k’atun cycle of 256 years.The Diccionario mayatranslates mayas polvillo, espuma(pow-der, dust, foam) as well as several terms relating to deer: pata hendida,nombre ritual del venado, venadillo.Indeed, the glyphic sign for mayhas been read as the cleft hoof of a deer (T294) (Montgomery 2001a:Fig. 9.3). Associations between deer (Odocoileus virginianus yucate-nensis;white-tailed deer) and calendrical ceremonies are evident in thefive sets of “deer almanacs” of the Madrid Codex. Lacadena’s (n.d.) read-ing of mayfrom Classic Maya glyph T174 (also read as kuch‘burden’) re-calls Mary D. Pohl’s (1981) synthesis of ethnohistoric and archaeologi-cal data relating to the transfer of ritual cargos, or burdens (kuch), inceremonies involving the hunting and sacrifice of a deer at a tree ornewly erected pole in the month of Sip.Maycan also be a verb meaning “to sacrifice,” “to count,” and — fromproto-Mixe-Zoquean —“to count, divine, adore” (see also Campbell andKaufman 1976 : 85). With reference to sacrifice, it is possible that deerbones — particularly foot bones?—were used in blood sacrifice. At thesite of Blackman Eddy in Belize, for example, a polished deer metapodialbone bloodletter was found in an early Middle Formative ritual deposit(Brown 1999). In addition, maycan be a noun or modifier conveying “alarge or indefinite number,” “a higher unit of measure for countingyears,” and “a unit of measure for scores of years” (Justeson and Camp-bell 1997 : 51). Coggins (1992 : 104 –105) read the glyphs ending the texton the south side of Copán’s Stela A as ti ma lamay‘at the completionof the great cycle.’In light of these interpretations, the identifier “Maya” could be in-terpreted to mean “people of the four quarters” or “people of the cycle,”and various Postclassic site names in the northern lowlands incorporatethis reference. For example, Mayapán (a partly Nahuatl toponym: -apan‘cycle water place’, referring to the site’s water-filled sinkhole, orcenote) is similar to Yukatekan Maya chi ch’en maya‘mouth of the wellof the people of the cycle’ (Edmonson 1986a : 5).During the Postclassic and Colonial periods in Yucatán, as the k’atuncycle or mayended —“turned” or “folded” (utz’) is the Maya term in the03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 77"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"78maya political sciencebooks of the chilam b’alams — every 256 years, the Maya ritually“seated” the new cycle in a particular city. Edmonson (1979 : 11, 1982 :xvi, 1986a : 4 –5) describes the seat of the mayas it was recognized inearly Colonial Yucatán: The cycle seat, or may ku(also may ku(l), ukulmay), was the primate city of a region. It was a capital of sorts (tan kaj‘front town’), but more important it was a sacred or holy city bearing thetitle Born of Heaven (ich kanor siyaj kan). It had a temple housing thecycle (may ku,the “cycle seat” proper) and its plaza (sak lak tun) wasthe crossroads (jol kan be) and religious center of the country and thenavel of the world. The city also had a sacred ceiba tree (yax che’‘green’or ‘first tree’), sacred grove (tzukub te’), and sacred well (ch’en). The seatof the mayheld “dynastic and religious primacy over the whole coun-try” for 256 years, after which the city and its roads and idols were ritu-ally destroyed and the city was “abandoned,” although this might havebeen simply the departure of the ruling dynasty.During the 256-year period of mayrule in the Postclassic and Colo-nial periods, important towns in the region overseen by the may kuclaimed the privilege of ritually seating each of its thirteen constituentk’atuns. Every twenty years as one k’atun folded, the new k’atun was rit-ually seated in a particular town, the jetz’(seat) k’atun. The jetz’ k’atunwas not only a ritual center, home of the b’alam and his chilam; eachk’atun seat controlled tribute rights, land titles, and appointments to public office in the realm for the twenty-year duration (Edmonson1979 : 11, 1982 : xvii). Consequently, the thirteen-k’atun, 256-year maycycle held great political significance in the Postclassic period. Becauseof the extensive powers vested in the jetz’ k’atun, conflicts frequentlyerupted among towns competing for the honor of seating the k’atun. After 1441–1461 and the collapse of Mayapán, sources generally agreeon the k’atun seats of northern Yucatán (Edmonson 1986a : 275–276,App. D). At that time, most k’atuns rotated among multiple towns, typ-ically two or three, but sometimes as many as seven.As the physical k’atun seat, or jetz’ k’atun, changed, so did the layersof administrative lordship or priestly oversight of the period. The chiefpriest of each k’atun, who held office for the full twenty years, was re-ferred to as b’alam (jaguar) or, less commonly, ajaw kan may‘lord [rat-tle]snake of the cycle’. Some priests were also given the title aj k’in may,which Edmonson (1986a:4) translates as “sun priest of the cycle,” or ajk’in;I would also follow Barbara Tedlock’s (1992 : 2) broad interpretationof the latter title as keeper of time, or “daykeeper.” Each b’alam ork’atun priest had a spokesman or speaker (chilam), who was the officialprophet of the k’atun. According to Edmonson (1982 : 31), the chilamwas “always a trained sun priest (ah kin). He was not only a prophet (ah03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 78"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"maya politico-religious calendrics79bobat) but theofficial Prophet for a particular katun. Finally . . . he wassupposed to be a sage (ah miatz). When disagreement arose over theprophecies, it was up to the Spokesman to resolve it.”The Books of the Chilam B’alams and Rituals of the MayThe momentous occasion of the ending of one mayand the beginning ofanother — the “folding” and “seating” of these cosmic eras —was cele-brated by the early Colonial period Maya with great ceremony. TheBook of Chilam Balam of Chumayeldescribes these celebrations as rit-ually structured, historico-mythological “dramas” of multiple “acts”that included processions, feasting, speeches and recitations, sacrifice,recognition of ranks and titles, and other activities (Edmonson 1986a:21–29, Chaps. 12 and 29). For example, the ending of the b’ak’tun (400tuns, or 394 solar years) was celebrated in Mérida in 1618 and consistedof twenty acts (there are twenty k’atuns in a b’ak’tun); earlier turningsof the b’ak’tun had occurred in 435, 830, and 1224. The characters inthese acts were costumed and masked, and the “whole ceremonial musthave involved hundreds of participants and thousands of spectators”lasting twenty-four to forty-eight hours, with many activities takingplace at night (Edmonson 1985 : 261).The ceremony of the turning of the mayin 1539 in Mérida paralleledthat of the b’ak’tun, except that it took place in thirteen acts (thirteenk’atuns in a may). For this, the first seven acts of the b’ak’tun dramawere assimilated into acts 8 –14, for a total of thirteen acts. Althoughk’atun ritual is not explicitly described in the Chumayel, Edmonson(1986a : 21–23, 82 – 99) deduced that it was patterned fairly closely on thethirteen-act mayceremony and described it as follows.Act 8: Ceremonial Circuit.To judge from the b’ak’tun and maycere-monies, this was a counterclockwise procession, or perhaps merely averbal tour, through the towns of the mayrealm or around the town it-self. Edmonson says the circuit is “implied” in k’atun ritual and endedin a b’alche’drinking ceremony. (B’alche’ is an alcoholic beverage madefrom the bark of the leguminous jab’intree [Lonchocarpus longistylus]fermented in water and honey, with other added flavorings.)An early Colonial example of this or a similar process (see Act 11, be-low) may have resulted in the so-called Land Treaty of Maní, dated Au-gust 15, 1557 (Roys [1943] 1972 : 175–194; Marcus 1993 : 126). In 1545don Juan Kokom (Nachi Kokom), ruler of the Sotuta province, had sur-veyed the boundaries of his territory, but portions were contested by theXiw to the west and by the Kupul to the east.

At the conclu-sion of the deliberations, the governors had a feast and consumed morethan ten gallons of b’alche’. Significantly, this territorial problem aroseshortly after the resettlement ordinances of 1552 and during the K’atun11 Ajaw immediately following the 1539 calendrical compromise be-tween the Xiw and the Itza. The Maní agreement of 1557 was achievedjust a little less than two years before the end of that k’atun.Similar processionals occurred during Wayeb’ rites (Coe 1965) andalso in modern times, for example, the jetz’ lu’um‘seats of the land’ (se-curing the land) ritual walk in Tekanto every nine years (Thompson1999 : 238 –239). Among the Tzotzil Maya of Zinacantán, Chiapas, coun-terclockwise processions are the direction of “historical process”(Gossen and Leventhal 1993 : 198 –200). Syncretistic vestiges of a pro-cession to symbolically order space continue today on Flores Island inLake Petén Itzá: on All Saint’s Day, the local priest leads a processioncounterclockwise around the perimeter of the island, stopping forprayers in each of the four residential quarters of the island.Act 9: Seating of the K’atun.The new b’alam, or jaguar priest, of the k’atun takes his place on the “mat of the k’atun” in the cycle seat.A mat (pop) is and was important to the Maya as a symbolic seat of authority, and woven or plaited matlike elements are frequently incor-porated in royal costumes (Robicsek 1975). In addition, the first monthof the secular year, or ja’ab’, is named Pop, identified by a glyph show-ing a mat. The selection of the new jaguar priest had been made tenyears earlier in mid-k’atun. This parallels the seating of the ruling“k’atun idols” (wooden or ceramic images of gods, probably figurine incense burners), which, according to Landa, were placed in the templeten years before their actual rule (see also Morley and Brainerd1956 : 212; D. Chase 1985).Act 10: Seating of the Yearbearers.These are the four b’akab’s‘Fa-thers of the Land’, or calendar priests, who represented not only theyears but also various quadripartite entities in nature such as the sky-bearers (Pawajtuns) and the gods of wind, sun, death, rain-lightning(Chaks), and fire (Aj Tok,also called “Burners”). Each Postclassic cityhad its own set of four yearbearers, identified with a direction and color.Act 11: Pacing of the K’atun.This was a ceremonial procession ofseven priests, the “Pacers,” who measured the land and confirmed landtitles. Payments of tribute were made. Restall (1997 : 189 –205; see alsoHanks 1989 : 99 –100) describes a Colonial period Yucatán “walk of pos-session” that occurred when there were land tenure disputes and em-phasized piles of stone and trees as boundary markers.

In addition, there were decla-rations of candidacy for priesthoods, for governor (jalach winik), and forother officials such as b’atab’s in the coming period. This is analogous tothe procedure in highland Zinacantán, Guatemala, where candidates forpriestly duties in the cargo system declared themselves as much astwenty years in advance (Vogt 1964 : 35).Act 13: Sacrifice.Sacrifices were carried out in a variety of ways, in-cluding heart removal, hanging, burning, and drowning, all accompa-nied by music and dancing. At Chich’en Itza, the sacrifices took place byhurling the designated individual(s) into the cenote.Act 14: Examination.This consisted of a ceremonial feast and ritualriddling, or “interrogation of the chiefs,” on the last day of the k’atun,to “examine the knowledge of the chiefs of the towns, [to see] whetherthey know how the ruling men came, whether they have explained thecoming of the chiefs, of the head-chiefs, whether they are of the lineageof rulers, whether they are of the lineage of chiefs, that they may proveit” (Roys [1933] 1967 : 88 – 89). As told in a section of the Chumayel(Roys [1933] 1967 : 88 – 98; Edmonson 1986a : 168 –204; cf. Burns 1983)dating to the seventeenth century, seven highly esoteric questions wereasked or commands given: “Bring the sun . . . and so the sun they will beasked for is the lord’s fried egg. . . . Go get the brains of heaven . . . thatis incense . . . ,” and so on.Act 15: The Word.The new chilam, the speaker of the jaguar priest,proclaimed the prophecy, or “word” (mut), for the upcoming k’atun withrichly poetic imagery. A highland parallel can be found in the “ancientword” of the Popol Vuh,an “extended discourse that carries the author-ity of tradition” as proclaimed by the “Mothers/Fathers of the Word,”and also claimed by the writers of the Popol Vuhitself (Tedlock 1985 :325, 339, 351).Act 16: Penance.This includes reference to containers, such asgourds, bowls, plates, and cups of the k’atun. Edmonson believes this actincorporated reference to autosacrifice (bloodletting) by the yearbearers,the priesthood, and the jaguar priest.Act 17: Commemoration of the Ancestors (natab’al).In late Colonialtimes, a cross was erected, and Edmonson (see also Morley and Brainerd1956 : 22) believed that in Classic times this was the moment when acarved stone stela was erected (tz’ap) or perhaps “unwrapped” (Stuart1996 : 156 –157). During the Late Postclassic period the Maya of Yucatánrevived this Classic practice of erecting carved stone monuments at theturning of the k’atun.

Modeling politi-cal rotations on cosmic cycles allowed power to be shared predictably,minimizing the potential chaos of political succession and disruption ofthe social order (Farriss 1987 : 577–578; Coe 1965; Thompson 1999).The key to identifying Classic period mayand k’atun cycles lies indates inscribed on stone monuments. While the Maya memorializedmany dynastic and other historical events on carved, dated stelae, pe-riod-ending monuments erected in commemoration of k’atun intervalscarry striking politico-religious significance as seen with the hindsightafforded by Postclassic calendrical ritual. As noted in Chapter 1, there is an obvious danger in relying solely on dated, carved stelae to explorethe mayhypothesis because of missing and damaged monuments. How-ever, as I (Rice 1997) have argued before and argue below, in the case of Tikal there are close correspondences between iconographic pro-grams and other distinctive architectural and stylistic components, andmany of these components are distributed more widely among otherlowland sites.At least five, possibly eight or more, acts of the period-ending cere-monies are of particular significance for retrodicting these rituals intothe Classic period: Acts 8 and 11, the ceremonial circuit, or pacing of thek’atun; Acts 9 and 10, the seating of the k’atun and the yearbearers; Acts13 and 16, sacrifice and penance; Act 14, examination and feast; Act 15,the chilam b’alam’s prognostication (mut‘prophecy’) for the incomingk’atun; and Act 17, the erection of a cross, pole, or, in Classic and LatePostclassic times, stela.Apart from the ambiguous etymology and glyphic expression of theword mayitself, other lines of evidence, including iconographic, calen-drical, architectural, and archaeological data that I present in succeed-ing chapters, combine to form a persuasive argument for the recogni-tion of 256-year cycles during the Preclassic and Classic periods in the lowlands. These 256-year cycles, consisting of 128 plus 128 years (or03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 83"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"84maya political science260 tuns of 130 plus 130) can also be mapped onto other key astrocalen-drical cycles of the Maya, including the 384-year cycle of Venus (128plus 256 years) and the 394-year, 400-tun cycle of the b’ak’tun.The most abundant and convincing evidence for this calendricallybased political organization of the Classic lowland Maya comes fromTikal, in the Department of El Petén, Guatemala. This is the subject ofthe next two chapters.03-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 84"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"chapter 4Tikal as Early Seat of the MayK’atun endings were celebrated throughout the Maya lowlands duringthe Classic period. As revealed in Morley’s early twentieth-centurymonument surveys, the Maya regularly commemorated the completionof quarter, half, and full k’atuns by erecting sculptured, dated stelae.Several decades ago it became evident that at Late Classic Tikal, dis-tinctive architectural complexes known as twin-pyramid groups werespecially constructed for these k’atun-ending ceremonies (Jones 1969).Now, however, it is evident from review of inscriptions and iconographyof period-ending monuments and related architectural complexes fromTikal and other sites that k’atun-and may-based politico-ritual organi-zation existed in the Early Classic period, which I date to a.d.179 – 435(see Table 1.1), and very likely emerged considerably earlier.The possibility that k’atun and maycycles and seats existed in thePreclassic period is difficult to evaluate directly owing to the lack ofdated monuments and historical inscriptions. In addition, the earliestPreclassic occupations in most of the Maya lowlands hide beneath me-ters of construction fill, exposed only in small, discontinuous patchesand dated by associated pottery fragments. However, at least five Earlyand Middle Preclassic ceramic spheres have been identified in the south-ern lowlands —Xe in the Río Pasión region, Mamom in central andnorthern Petén, Swasey in northern Belize, Cunil and Kanocha in west-central Belize, and Gordon at Copán. Middle Preclassic occupation alsohas been noted in the Puuc area (Carmean, Dunning, and Kowalski2004) and elsewhere in the northern lowlands (Suhler et al. 2004; Beyet al. 1998). All of this indicates widespread, though not necessarilylarge populations at this time (see Andrews 1990). Other evidence forhypothesizing Preclassic political organization can be drawn from architecture and iconography uncovered in recent excavations at El Mirador and Nakbe in northern Petén, Calakmul in southeasternCampeche, and Cerros in Belize; another site with evident Preclassicimportance is Copán, Honduras.

In northern Petén, one of these is the “triadic structure”(Hansen 2000 : 59), a T-shaped platform with three structures located onthe distal wings. In a common variant, the platform is not T-shaped buta pyramidal substructure with three small temples arranged at rightangles to each other on the sides and back of the platform. These LatePreclassic triadic groups typically occur on the south side of a plaza orface south. The three structures have been interpreted as commemora-tion of the “original three lineages” or gods (the so-called PalenqueTriad: GI, GII, and GIII) of the Maya or the “terrestrial counterpart ofthree cosmic hearthstones” (Taube 1998). One example can be seen inthe main structures of the North Acropolis at Tikal.Another architectural complex, which developed somewhat earlierfigure4.1 Map of northeastern Petén showing sites mentioned in text.04-T2963 6/15/04 2:16 PM Page 86"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"tikal as early seat of the may87figure4.2 Map of Tikal (Carr and Hazard 1961; courtesy of University of Penn-sylvania Museum, Philadelphia, neg. # Tikal 61-5-5).and has more enduring importance, is variously known as the E-Group(from Uaxactún; Fig. 4.3), also sometimes referred to as a Commemora-tive Astronomical Complex (Complejo Conmemorativo Astronómico),or, the term most often used by Guatemalan archaeologists (Laporte1996), Public Ritual Complex (Complejo de Ritual Público).

In its entirety, the E-Group configuration has been widely interpreted as a solar-seasonal observatory complex marking the dates of sunrise onsolstices: from a viewing position on the western radial structure, sun-rise at the summer solstice occurs over the northern temple, sunrise at04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 88"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"tikal as early seat of the may89the equinoxes occurs over the central temple, and sunrise at the wintersolstice occurs over the southern structure (Blom 1924; Ricketson 1928;Ricketson and Ricketson 1937; Ruppert [1940] 1977; see also Aimers1993; Aimers and Rice n.d.).Middle Preclassic structures in the East Plaza of Tikal’s Mundo Per-dido, or Lost World, complex are the earliest known prototype of thispresumed solar observatory configuration in the lowlands (Laporte andFialko 1990, 1995). The arrangement consists of a radial platform, Struc-ture 5C-54-1st, on the west side of a plaza facing an elongated platformwith the three north-south temples of Structure 5D-84/88-1st to theeast (Fig. 4.4). The first building episode (ca. 700 – 600 b.c.) of thesestructures was simple: a radial structure situated opposite but off-centerof a long, narrow, north-south mound with stairs on the centerline ofeach side. These were later overbuilt with larger structures during thelate Middle Preclassic period (Tzek ceramic complex and phase, 500 –400 b.c.), followed by further remodelings in the early Late Preclassic(Chuen, 400 –200 b.c.).

The year 354 b.c.marks the completion of B’ak’tun 7 as well as the beginning of a K’atun8 Ajaw, which was completed — along with the completion of a may—twenty years later, in 334 b.c.(Table 4.1).The facades of temples in early triadic groups and later E-Group as-semblages were often embellished with enormous stuccoed and painteddeity masks, most commonly depicting jaguars. Although numerous ex-amples are found at Middle and Late Preclassic sites in Petén, the bestknown is at Late Preclassic Cerros, in northern Belize. There, stuccoedmasks on the south-facing Structure 5C-2nd “feature blunt-snouted andlong-snouted zoomorphs flanked by ear flanges” (Freidel and Schele1988b : 61). These have been interpreted in terms of cosmic cycling, withthe rising and setting sun (the Jaguar Sun God) on the east and westsides, respectively, of the stairway on the lower tier and Venus as morn-ing (east) and evening (west) stars on the upper tier of the substructure(Freidel and Schele 1988a, 1988b). At Tikal’s Mundo Perdido, the threetemples atop the eastern platform were built in the late Late Preclassicperiod, with the facade of the center structure featuring two jaguarmasks. Numerous burials and caches were placed along the axes.The significance of radial structures in the broader scheme of thingsmight be understood in light of Lacadena’s (n.d.) interpretation of mayas related to something with four corners or four sides. At the sametime, translations of mayfrom highland Maya languages indicate mean-ings that include “to sacrifice, to count, to divine,” all of which resonatewith this interpretation of radial structures and solar observations. Ra-dial structures also might be viewed as architectural embodiments ofthe circle-in-cross or quartered concentric circle petroglyphs widely dis-tributed throughout Mesoamerica (see Chap. 3). It is not difficult to en-vision that through time, and perhaps as an outgrowth of literal or figu-rative site “founding” rituals, the four arms of the pecked cross and thequadripartite double circle-square were translated architectonically intofour stairways arrayed around a tiered, square platform. Thus the radialstructure — like the quincunx, k’in day glyph, kan cross, and lamat,orVenus glyph — is among the many Maya and Mesoamerican quadripar-tite figures signifying calendric and cosmic cycle completion (seeFig. 3.6b; Coggins 1980 : Fig. 2). Importantly, because radial structurestypically appear in the middle of open plazas, they also represent, inMaya cosmovision, the center of the universe, the joining of the fourworld quarters, and — in light of later sculptural and monumental pro-grams associated with them (see Chaps. 5–7)— commemoration of04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 90"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Table 4.1.Significant Preclassic and Early Classic dates for Tikal in theseating of the mayand the turning of the b’ak’tun.YearArchaeologicalEraGregorianMayaK’atunPhaseEventB.C.5906.8.0.0.08 AjawMiddleTikal seats Preclassicproto-may?Nakbe seats proto-may?3547.0.0.0.010 AjawB’ak’tun completion3347.1.0.0.08 Ajaw(early) Late Tikal seats mayPreclassicEl Mirador seats may?777.14.0.0.08 Ajaw(late) Late Tikal seats mayPreclassicUaxactún seats may?A.D.418.0.0.0.09 AjawB’ak’tun completion90?Yax Moch Xok, Tikal dynastic Founder1798.7.0.0.08 AjawEarly Tikal seats mayClassic2928.12.14.8.15First display of Tikal Emblem main sign3178.14.0.0.07 AjawLady Une’ B’alam celebrates period ending4359.0.0.0.08 AjawMiddle Tikal seats may; Classicb’ak’tun completionSource : After Edmonson 1979 :14 –15; 1981 :27.04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 91"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"92maya political scienceagreements and compromises achieved through the ages by Maya calen-dar priests and sages in order to ensure and maintain cosmic order.It seems likely that E-Group architectural complexes had their in-ception in rituals of annual solar and agricultural cycling. This cyclingwould explain why eastern orientations and observations — equinoxes,solstices, quarter years, and so forth, as observed by sunrise positions onthe horizon —were important and commemorated architectonically. Inthe Early Preclassic these observation lines might have been establishedwith perishable or temporary markers, such as poles or stones. Fromthere, it is not difficult to conceptualize construction of permanent architectural markers for the sole purpose of carrying out such criticalrituals.These architectural complexes were also centers of early k’atun-ending celebrations ,but it is not until carved and dated period-endingstelae began to be erected that this function can be recognized archaeo-logically. Several of the earliest k’atun-celebrating stela known in theMaya lowlands were found in E-Groups ,particularly in front of or oth-erwise associated with the eastern structure. For example ,carved NakbeStela 1 ,dating to the late Middle Preclassic ,was found in an E-Group(Hansen 2000 : 56). And thirteen stelae ,twelve plain and one carved ,were found in the E-Group at El Mirador (Matheny 1987) ,raising thepossibility that one was erected every twenty years during the roughly250-year (100b.c.–a.d. 150) florescence of the site. Uaxactún Stelae 18and 19 ,celebrating the 8.16.0.0.0 K’atun 3 Ajaw ending ina.d.357 ,wereset in front of the east building of the E-Group at that site (Valdés andFahsen 1995 : 204); Stela 19 shows a kneeling captive. The presence ofkneeling or prone bound prisoners is a common theme on k’atun-endingmonuments in both the Early and Late Classic periods (see Dillon 1982),recalling the meaning of k’atun as not only “twenty” but also “fight(er),”“combat,” “battle,” “war(rior),” “conquest” (Diccionario maya).Early Classic Tikal and Its RulersThe Institution of KingshipBeginning perhaps as early as ca. 300 b.c., the growth in the importanceof calendrical cycling was accompanied by transformations in the veryfundament of leadership — a transition from emphasis on the personaland charismatic qualities of an individual to the more formal structureor institution of a “political office” that “represents a universal criterionof the state” (Kurtz 2001 : 176). Among the Maya, this new political of-fice or role was that of ajaw (king, lord), a concept believed to have orig-inated in the lowlands during the last century b.c.(Freidel and Schele1988a, 1988b). Etymologically, the root of ajawis aw‘shout’, suggesting04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 92"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"tikal as early seat of the may93that the aj-aw is “the shouter” or perhaps “he who proclaims” (Stuart1995 : 190 –191), a reading that can be easily associated with the procla-mation of the mut or prophecy of the k’atun. Embedded in such changeswere new rules for power transfer, based on “firm genealogical prin-ciples of succession and firm ritual formulae, as carved on stone ste-lae[,] . . . [that ensured] the stable transmission of central leadership overgenerations” (Freidel and Schele 1988a : 550).Some two hundred years later, by a.d.199, Freidel (1992 : 119) argues,the ajaw title began to be manifest as k’ul ajaw (divine or holy lord). Stu-art (1995 : 197–198), however, notes that the k’ul ajaw title is rare untilthe Late Classic period and argues that this distinction of a divine or sa-cred king apart from other nobility may not have emerged until muchlater. Part of the evidence Freidel adduces for his earlier date is the con-juring of the Vision Serpent on the unprovenienced Hauberg Stela, dated8.8.0.7.0 3 Ajaw 13 Xul (October 7, 199). The text on the back of theHauberg Stela refers to the ruler letting blood fifty-two days before hisaccession. This monument shows B’ak Tul, k’ul ajaw of an unknownsite, wearing a Jaguar Sun deity mask, with a down-gazing ancestor headin the Vision Serpent’s gaping jaws and diminutive figures crawlingabout the serpent’s body (Schele and Miller 1986 : 191; Freidel 1992 : 119;Stuart 1988 : 220). Down-gazing “ancestral” heads are known fromiconographic programs elsewhere in the early Maya world, including ElBaúl Stela 1 (at 7.19.15.7.12; a.d.36), Kaminaljuyú Stela 11, and AbajTakalik Stelae 2 and 3. As discussed in Chapter 5, these Late Preclassicand Early Classic elements — prone prisoners, small figures crawling inserpentine scrolls — prefigure the striking imagery of the Tikal region’sTerminal Classic period-ending stelae associated with k’atun ritual.The use of the “seating” glyph is also suggestive of early k’atun andmayritual. The Dumbarton Oaks “plaque,” or pectoral ornament, aprobable epi-Olmec quartzite tablet reportedly from the northern low-lands, shows a seated lord with a long-nosed head in his headdress, andthe text refers to the “seating” of an ajaw (Freidel and Schele 1988a : 555).The La Mojarra stela, dating to the mid-first century a.d.also uses the“seating” expression (Kaufman and Justeson 2001). The significance ofa lord being “seated” (glyph T644; chum) rather than “acceding” (T684,the “toothache glyph”) has been highlighted by Marcus (1992a : 340):secondary-level sites used the accession glyph, whereas first-tier sites orregional capitals used the seating glyph. “Seating” is also the metaphorfor beginning a month on a day 0 in the 365-day calendar.I suggest that the seating event refers not only to the seating of theruler in office but also to the seating of units of time, the mayandk’atun, at these sites.

During the Late Classic period, the main sign of the Tikal Em-blem Glyph was sometimes combined with other glyphic prefixes toread tan kun(or ch’en) ‘in the center of the seat (or cave) of’ Tikal (seeFig. 2.4c).Tikal’s Dynastic FoundingUnfortunately, the record of Tikal’s early dynasties, rulers, and monu-ments is quite fragmentary (Martin and Grube 2000 : 26 –32; Martin2003). Much of what we know comes from a historical text on the backof Stela 31 and from a painted vase listing royal successions. Other earlydates come from the text on the roofcomb of the Late Classic Temple ofthe Inscriptions (Temple VI), where 5.0.0.0.0 (1143 b.c.) and 6.14.16.9.16(456 b.c.) may refer to the actual or mythical founding of the site (Sharer1994 : 271). Table 4.2 outlines the succession of Tikal’s Early and MiddleClassic rulers.Tikal’s principal dynasty is known as the Jaguar Paw dynasty, al-though there are no contemporaneous images linked with the founderor his name glyph to spell this out precisely. The dynasty was foundedby Yax Moch Xok (variously read as Yax Eb’ Xook ‘First Step Shark’, orYax Ch’aktel Xok ‘First Scaffold Shark’), who ruled in the late first cen-tury a.d.From the point of view of the mayhypothesis, it is useful tonote that xokalso may be interpreted as “to count, to read”; recall, too,the interpretation of mayas “to count, to divine.” Tikal Burial 125, onthe original central axis of the North Acropolis, may have been the Tikalfounder’s tomb, the grave goods of which were removed and reinterredto the east, thereby establishing a new centerline axis for that complex(Harrison 1999 : 68 – 69).The next known ruler of Tikal is “Foliated Jaguar,” whose nicknamederives from a leafy element atop a jaguar head. Foliated Jaguar is prob-ably the individual depicted on Tikal Stela 29 (a.d.292) (Fig. 4.5) ,wherehe displays two images of the Jaguar God, one in his left hand and oneon his chest; in his right arm he cradles the Maya double-headed serpentceremonial bar. At the top of the scene is a down-gazing ancestor head,presumably his father, who might bear the name Chak Tok Ich’ak (Mar-tin and Grube 2000 : 27). The ancestor wears a headdress consisting of a god image with a jaguar paw for a nose, providing evidence for de-scent in the Jaguar Paw dynasty. Recent interpretations suggest thatTikal Stela 29, discovered west of the North Acropolis, originally mighthave been erected in the Mundo Perdido E-Group.

This first appearance of the Long Count sys-tem of dating on stelae customarily has been used by Mayanists to datethe beginning of the Early Classic period in the lowlands. There is, how-ever, considerable evidence for a Late Preclassic “stela cult” of plainmonuments (Hammond 1982; Justeson and Mathews 1983), as at El Mi-rador, possibly erected to celebrate period endings, and the earliestrecord of a period-ending celebration might be that of 8.4.0.0.0 (a.d.120)on an unprovenienced jade celt (Schele and Miller 1986 : 82 – 83).Tikal Stela 29 also shows the site’s Emblem Glyph main sign (seeFig. 2.4), appearing, significantly, in the headdress of a Jaguar God headheld by the ruler, making Tikal the first site in the lowlands to displaythis political symbol. The appearance of names and titles in headdresseshas long standing in Mesoamerica, as evident in the insignia of the “hel-mets” on the Olmec colossal heads. Viewed in cross-cultural perspec-tive, headdresses are a common means of signaling cultural and “eth-nic” identity (Wobst 1977).The origin of Tikal’s name and the interpretation of its EmblemGlyph — the main sign of which is glyph T569, a tied pouch (Thompson1962 : 194 –195) or knotted bundle — merit discussion, as meanings aredisputed, but all support the maymodel. One point concerns whetherthe name “Tikal” is of modern or ancient origin. This toponym has long local usage in Petén and can be derived from two Yukatekan Mayawords: ti,a locative identifier meaning “at, to” or “at the place of,” plusk’al,which has many meanings, including “twenty” and “to fasten,bind, or enclose” (Stuart 1996 : 155–156). Teobert Maler (1911 : 3), whovisited the site in the late nineteenth century, translated the name fromYukatekan Maya as ti-kal‘at the voice,’ or “place where the spirit voicesare heard” (provocative in light of the reading of ti kalas “to get drunk”[Harris and Stearns 1997 : 37; Montgomery 2001a:286]). A different deri-vation comes from Charles Andrew Hofling and Francisco Tesucún(1998), who derive the modern name from ti ak’al‘at the waterhole’, re-ferring to the site’s large reservoirs (or perhaps its neighboring seasonal04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 98"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"tikal as early seat of the may99swamps, or bajos). This is the meaning given today by the local ItzajMaya speakers of San José, on the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá.Clemency C. Coggins (1987) accepts Tikal as the ancient name of thesite and highlights Maya linguistic multivalency in suggesting multiple,complementary readings of the final syllable, glyph, and name. Onemeaning for k’alis “twenty,” so that ti-k’alcould mean “place of thecount of twenty [years, i.e., k’atuns].” In addition, Coggins links the T60k’aknot at the center of the tied bundle to k’ax‘tie’ (also Stuart’s “fas-ten”). Furthermore, the bundle itself is a powerful metaphor associatedwith k’atuns — as the burden (kuch) or prophecy of the k’atun, as tyingup (i.e., completing) the burden of a k’atun, and as the folded paper orcloth on which the k’atun prophecies and other divinatory matters werewritten.A different —but not necessarily contradictory — interpretation ofthe Tikal Emblem Glyph sees the main sign not as a tied-up bundle ofthings but rather as a hairstyle. It was early identified as t’uch,a bun ortopknot of hair (Barthel 1968 : 171–172), and more recently as “the rearview of a human head with a knot tied across it” (Schele and Mathews1998 : 63 – 64). Knots and knotted cloth or bundles symbolized “supremeauthority” as early as the mid-first-century La Mojarra stela (Justesonand Kaufman 1993 : 1705, Figs. 7F, 7G). Related to this is the possibilitythat the main sign represents the rear view of the tied royal headbandworn by rulers and by the Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh(see Coe 1973).This image of tied hair appears as such on Tikal Stelae 29 and 31, in theheaddress of the “solar deity” head carried by the ruler (Coggins 1987)and in a death head in the basal panel of Stela 1.Glyph T569 is now read mut,which in Yukatekan can mean“prophecy, news, tidings”; “bird” (Order Galliformes, which includesthe noisy chachalacas as well as guans and curasows (Roys 1957 : 50); and(as mutalor mutul) “knot of hair” (Martin and Grube 2000 : 30; Scheleand Mathews 1998 : 63 – 64). Macri (2000) derives mutfrom Mixe-Zoquemu’ut‘water pool’. Both translations indicate that today’s Tikal was atthe center of a kingdom called Mutal or Mutul by the Maya. Here we canalso recall Act 15 of the Yucatán k’atun and mayceremonies: the mutor giving of the prophecy (as well as the “ancient word” of the K’iche’Popol Vuh). More significantly, the site of Tikal itself is proclaimed not only “the site of the prophecy” but also, in the Early Classic, as yax(first, new) mutul, “the site of the first prophecy.”In sum, T569 may be read mut, kal, k’al, k’ax,or “burden,” or somecombination of all of these, a classic example of the Maya love of poly-semic and metaphorical language. All these meanings highlight refer-ence to k’atuns and associated ritual.

His name appears on Stela 1 at ElEncanto, about 10 kilometers northeast of Tikal, dating to about 305 to308. He is followed by a queen, Ix Une’ B’alam, named after a “local god-dess, in this case an infantile feline with Olmec antecedents” (Martinand Grube 2000 : 27). Mention of her on Stela 31 prompted Martin andGrube (2000 : 34) to suggest that she “seems to provide an importantprecedent for the transfer of the founder’s bloodline through a woman.”Ix Une’ B’alam celebrated the 7 Ajaw k’atun ending (but not via a knownmonument) at Tikal in 8.14.0.0.0, a.d.317.There may then have been a ruler named Zero Moon Bird at Tikal, at least to judge from the Stela 31 text, although the evidence for this is disputed. A ruler by that name is identified on the Leiden Plate orPlaque, an incised jade celt originally discovered in Puerto Barrios,Guatemala, and deposited in a museum in Leiden, the Netherlands. Thecarving on this ornament is very similar to the style of early monumentsat Tikal, and it has often been attributed to that site; the text on the backof it (8.14.3.1.12 1 Eb’ 0 Yaxk’in; September 15, 320) refers to the seatingof the ruler. The ruler faces the viewer’s left and holds his hands in thedistinctive position of later monuments: tight against his chest, back-to-back with fingers curled in. As on Stela 29, a Jaguar God head appears onthe front of his belt. A key element of this carving is that the ruler isstanding with a prone, naked individual, presumably a captive, behindhis feet.The thirteenth ruler in Tikal’s dynastic line was K’inich Muwan Jol,whose death is recorded on a monument from the peripheral site ofCorozal as 8.16.2.6.0 11 Ajaw 13 Pop (May 22, 359). Muwan Jol is per-haps best known as the father of Chak Tok Ich’ak I, otherwise known asGreat Jaguar Paw (or Great Jaguar Claw). Chak Tok Ich’ak I came to ruleon 8.16.3.10.2 11 Ik 10 Sek (August 6, 360) and died on 8.17.1.4.12 11 Eb’15 Mak (January 14, 378).Tikal Stela 39 (Fig. 4.6), only the basal portion of which is known,shows an Early Classic ruler believed to be Chak Tok Ich’ak I wearing anembellished loincloth and back ornament. In his left hand he grips an axof some sort that terminates in a fearsomely clawed jaguar paw. Axesalso are tucked into the tops of his elaborate anklets. He is standing ona bound, prone captive who has a beard and appears to be noble, givenhis attire —with knotted sandals, a mat-decorated loincloth, and com-plex headdress. Elsewhere he is identified as a k’uhun,or keeper of texts(Montgomery 2001b : 49; Jackson and Stuart 2001). The monument dis-plays the Tikal Emblem Glyph main sign in the text, though it lacks the “water-group” prefix meaning “holy, divine.” The basal portion ofthis monument, which celebrates completion of 8.17.0.0.0 K’atun 1Ajaw (376; Grube and Martin 1998 : 81), was found in Mundo Perdido, 04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 101"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"102maya political scienceredeposited in the back room of Structure 5D-86-7, which is the centraltemple of the eastern three structures of the E-Group.The Central Mexican PresenceIt has long been known that central Mexico — most probably the enor-mous site of Teotihuacan — played an important but as yet undefinedrole in the Maya area during the Early Classic period (see Fash and Fash2000; Braswell 2003a). Early attention focused on what was presumed tobe a key interaction with Kaminaljuyú in the Maya highlands (Kidder,Jennings, and Shook 1946; Sanders and Price 1968; Coggins 1975, 1979),but more recent interest has been stimulated by epigraphic evidence ofan “arrival event” of Teotihuacanos at Tikal on January 14, 378. On thatday, according to David Stuart’s (2000; see also Proskouriakoff 1993 : 4 –10) reconstruction, a group of central Mexicans, including Siyaj K’ak’ or K’ak’ Sij (Fire Born; formerly known by the nickname “SmokingFrog”), Yax Nun Ayin I (First ? Crocodile, formerly Curl Snout), andSpearthrower Owl arrived at Tikal. On this same day the Tikal rulerChak Tok Ich’ak I “entered the water,” which is presumed to mean thathe died. Stuart (2000 : 481, 487) sees Siyaj K’ak’ as a military leader sentby Spearthrower Owl to overthrow Tikal’s dynasty, consolidate power,and serve as regent for a new ruler, Spearthrower Owl’s young son, YaxNun Ayin I. Yax Nun Ayin I was installed on a day 5 Kab’an 10 Yaxk’in(September 11, 379), and on his accession monument, Stela 4, he wearsa necklace of large shells and his face peers out from the maw of a hugefeathered jaguar (?) head headdress. Above him a long-nosed deity headgazes downward.Spearthrower Owl, Siyaj K’ak’, and Yax Nun Ayin are identified inTikal’s texts as holding the important title kalomte’, which conveyed,at least in later times, “a supreme status within a political hierarchy. Itis the office for high kings of Late Classic Tikal and possibly Calakmul,and . . . it serves to mark overlords or ‘emperors’ of conquered territo-ries” (Stuart 2000 : 486). The derivation of this title is unknown. Glyph-ically, it was originally identified as head variant T1030, with numerousvariations (Fig. 2.3a – d), although a phonetic version is also identified asmakuchor b’atab’. Later head variants can be distinguished by symbolicweaponry: in place of the back of the head and earplug is a left hand orarm grasping either a manopla (“brass knuckles”) or an ax.What has gone relatively unnoticed in this discussion of the 378event is the substantial presence of central Mexicans in Tikal for morethan a century before this “arrival” (cf. Laporte 2003) and the relativelack of evidence for dynastic disruption in the following century (cf.Borowicz 2003; Rice n.d.b). With respect to the former, a key variable in04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 102"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"tikal as early seat of the may103identifying central Mexican contact or influence outside the Mexicanplateau is the presence of talud-tableroarchitectural facades. This termrefers to the two-part construction of the tiers of a structural platform,in which a sloping batter (talud) is topped by a rectangular, borderedpanel (tablero). At Tikal, talud-tablero architecture is first evident inMundo Perdido around a.d.250 –300 (Laporte and Fialko 1990, 1995;Laporte 2003 : 200), about a century before the 378 “arrival” of centralMexicans in Tikal. Interestingly, it makes its earliest appearance in connection with modifications to the radial temple (Str. 5D-54) in the E-Group and shows up slightly later (ca. a.d.350 –378) on three plat-forms in residential Group 6C-XVI, a short distance to the south ofMundo Perdido (Laporte 1989).Despite the evident importance of these central Mexican dignitariesin the lowlands, continuities with prearrival canons of dynastic legiti-mation were maintained. While subsequent Tikal rulers traced descentfrom Spearthrower Owl in the male line, they married Tikal women ofpresumably comparable high-status royal lines, perhaps from the JaguarPaw dynasty. In addition, they appropriated the names of earlier, indige-nous Maya rulers of the old Jaguar Paw dynasty, including Siyaj KanK’awil I and Chak Tok Ich’ak (Table 4.2). This latter is of interest, be-cause the father of the ruler on Stela 29 might have been named ChakTok Ich’ak and would have ruled Tikal around a.d.250. The next Tikalruler named Chak Tok Ich’ak (I) died (or was killed) in 378, at the timeof the Teotihuacan arrival. The third ruler named Chak Tok Ich’ak (butreferred to as the second, or II) died in 508, as recorded on a monumentfrom Toniná, Chiapas, Mexico (Martin and Grube 2000 : 37).These dates and rulers’ names bracket two roughly 128-year intervalsin a 256-year interval of a maycycle. During the first 128-year period,250 –378, central Mexican “influence” in the form of talud-tablero ar-chitecture began to appear in Mundo Perdido; royal burials were in thatcomplex rather than in the traditional domain of the ancestors, theNorth Acropolis on the north side of the Main Plaza. It was also duringthis period that Tikal first displayed its Emblem and adopted LongCount dating. During the next interval of 130 years, from 378 to 508, theNorth Acropolis resumed use as a royal burial ground with the inter-ment of Tikal ruler Chak Tok Ich’ak I in 378, rulers appropriated thenames of earlier kings in the Jaguar Paw line, and carved monumentsdisplay a wealth of evidence for continuity of tradition modes of dynas-tic legitimation.For example, with certain outstanding exceptions, the imagery onstelae erected by Tikal’s post-entradarulers is purely Maya in concept,style, and execution. The famous Stela 31 (Fig. 4.7), for example, datesto 445 (a lajuntun) and shows Siyaj Kan K’awil II flanked by images of04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 103"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"figure4.7 The central figure of Tikal Stela 31, which dates to the lajuntun of a.d.445, portrays Siyaj Kan K’awil II dressed in Maya garb, holding aloft his grand-father Spearthrower Owl’s headdress and cradling a cruller-eyed GIII Jaguar Sun God head with the topknot of the Tikal Emblem Glyph.

Stela 31 might originally havebeen paired with Altar 19, according to Coe (1990b : 759 –760), whichshows a cross-legged seated figure on the front and an unusual, “seem-ingly quartered rope and knot design on the periphery.”Rather than being a formal military takeover of Tikal ,this Teotihua-can arrival was clearly only one event in several centuries of interactionsbetween central México and the lowland Maya (Cowgill 2003 : 328). Asevidenced by architectural styles ,these interactions took place in theceremonial center of Tikal ,included construction of a residential com-plex ,and would have to have been facilitated by factions in Tikal (seeWebster 2002 : 133). It is of interest that there is substantial evidence forinternal dissention within Teotihuacan at this time ,including termina-tion of the Feathered Serpent Pyramid in the Ciudadela (Sugiyama 1998).In an argument detailed elsewhere (Rice n.d.b) ,I consider the centralMexican arrival that of a “stranger-king” and a prenegotiated merger ofthe dynasties of two great Mesoamerican cities. Tikal’s young king YaxNun Ayin I ,perhaps the son of the mysterious Spearthrower Owl ,wouldhave been primarily a royal “placeholder” in this dynastic melding.The text on the right side of Stela 31 refers to Yax Nun Ayin I as a“k’atun lord,” which has been interpreted rather disparagingly: Stuart(2000 : 487) thinks it means he was less than twenty years old or ruledfewer than twenty years.

I interpret this term instead as referring to “lord of a k’atun,” hebeing the lord of Tikal which took on the role of a regional k’atun seatduring the antepenultimate k’atun of its maycycle. During his reign, heerected two monuments, Stelae 4 and 18, the latter commemorating theK’atun 12 Ajaw ending of 8.18.0.0.0 (396).Yax Nun Ayin I’s son, Siyaj Kan K’awil II, who may have beenSpearthrower Owl’s grandson, was the key outcome of the intermarriagebetween central Mexicans and Tikal’s Jaguar Paw dynasty. Importantly,he adopted the K’awil title and patron, because his ancestor, Siyaj KanK’awil I, seems to have been the last in the male line of the original dy-nasty founded by Yax Eb’ Xok (Martin and Grube 2000 : 27). Siyaj KanK’awil II’s rule, or burden, occurred during a cosmically powerful tran-sition for the Maya: a K’atun 8 Ajaw, which was not only the final k’atunof the thirteen-k’atun maycycle that had begun in 179 but also the final one of the b’ak’tun ending 9.0.0.0.0 (435).

Siyaj Kan K’awil II died in 456.His tomb lies on the central axis of the North Acropolis, beneath Struc-ture 33; his magnificent Stela 31, dated 9.0.10.0.0 (445), was placedabove his tomb at a later date.Not long thereafter, the ruler K’an Kitam (Siyaj Kan K’awil II’s son)mimicked Stela 31 on his own Stela 40, dated 468, holding aloft a Teoti-huacan-style feathered and plated headdress and carrying a ceremonialbar.

Although Stela 13 is datedonly by style, it might have associations with fire drilling because thedate would be a day 3 Ajaw, important in Burner rituals (see Chap. 8).Also, the staffs recall a Maya term for stela, lakamtun,in which lakammeans “flag” or “banner”; thus lakam-tunis “banner stone,” referring04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 107"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"108maya political scienceto “the conceptual origin of stelae as stone versions of the upright stan-dards that once graced architectural plazas and terraces” (Stuart 1996 :154). Alternatively, the staff could be a digging stick, drawing atten-tion to the ruler’s responsibility for ensuring agricultural fertility (cf.Christie 1995 : 142, who interprets the staff as a World Tree symbol).Chak Tok Ich’ak II’s five monuments, three of which commemoratethe k’atun ending of 9.3.0.0.0 (2 Ajaw 18 Muwan; January 28, 495), showgreat elaboration of the staff. Instead of a single, presumably woodenpole, the staff now consists of three bent or curved poles, tied togetherby elaborate knots at both ends and in the middle (Fig. 4.9). (Here onemight note the similarity to the staff carried by a god in the upper regis-ter of Dresden Codex page 25 [Fig. 1.2], one of the New Year’s pages; heis also carrying a fan and a large backrack with a god figure in it. SeeChapter 8 for discussion of New Year’s ceremonies.) Other common fea-tures, variably present on these eight staff stelae, are the ruler carryinga small bag or pouch in one hand (4 examples), wearing nearly identicalwrapped anklets (5) and a feathered headdress (6; Stela 9 may be the ear-liest depiction of this ornamentation), and bearing a supernatural head,often in a rack, on his back. Chak Tok Ich’ak II died in 508.The succeeding years saw some dynastic disruption, with the six-year-old “Lady of Tikal” or Lady Kalomte’ (Montgomery 2001b : 107),daughter of Chak Tok Ich’ak II, apparently coruling with Kalomte’B’alam from 511 to 527 (Martin and Grube 2000 : 37–39). On Stela 10(Fig. 4.10) ,Kalomte’ B’alam is shown with a prone captive behind his feet; this monument was erected in what may be Tikal’s first twin-pyramid group (5E-1sub), now destroyed, in the East Plaza. During thenext decade or so (527–537), Tikal was led by the poorly known rulerBird Claw (Martin and Grube 2000 : 39). The final ruler in the first halfof Tikal’s mayseating was Wak Kan K’awil (Double Bird), who returnedto Tikal from exile (in Xultún?) and ruled from 537 to 562 (Martin andGrube 2000 : 39; Montgomery 2001b : 116). He was a son of Chak TokIch’ak II and apparently the brother of Lady of Tikal, whom he may havemurdered (Guenter 2000). In 562, Tikal was supposedly defeated in astar war attack by Calakmul.K’atun endings were celebrated at Tikal throughout the first half ofthis Middle Classic mayseating. For example, Stela 9 marked the end ofa K’atun 4 Ajaw in 9.2.0.0.0, 475 (the monument was found in the GreatPlaza); three monuments celebrated the 9.3.0.0.0 K’atun 2 Ajaw endingin 495; and Stela 6 commemorated the completion of the K’atun 13Ajaw of 9.4.0.0.0, 514. Wak Kan K’awil’s celebration of the ending ofK’atun 9 Ajaw (9.6.0.0.0; 554) was noted not on a stela but in a textpainted on a pottery dish that also depicted a Teotihuacan-like owl(?);04-T2963 6/15/04 2:17 PM Page 108"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"tikal as early seat of the may109figure4.9 Tikal Stela 7 ,showing Chak Tok Ich’ak II holding an elaborately knottedstaff (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982: Fig. 11; drawing by William R.

During this interval, El Perú and Yaxhá also dis-played their own Emblem Glyphs, and a carved ceramic vessel fromUcanal, 51 kilometers southeast of Tikal, mentions the Tikal ruler SiyajKan K’awil II as overlord of Ucanal’s king (Martin and Grube 2000 : 35).Similarly, the Tikal ruler Wak Kan K’awil “sponsored” the accession ofthe Caracol ruler Yajaw Te’ K’inich in 553, then three years later led ach’ak,or “ax,” event against a Caracol lord.Several peripheral sites around Tikal are of interest because theirmonuments mention Tikal’s rulers: El Encanto Stela 1 mentions SiyajKan K’awil I and names his parents; Corozal Stela 1 notes the death ofK’inich Muwan Jol in 359(?); and a stela at El Temblor may be the inau-gural monument of Chak Tok Ich’ak I. It is likely that these early stelaewere removed from Tikal and dispersed to these outlying areas (Martinand Grube 2000 : 27–30), perhaps by factions supporting Teotihuacan’sdynastic interventions.The Meaning of the MiddleThe beginning of Tikal’s Middle Classic role as mayseat occurred in aK’atun 8 Ajaw, the last k’atun of the thirteen-k’atun cycle of the mayseating. Siyaj Kan K’awil II’s accession in 411 was in a jolajuntun year,five years before the ending of the K’atun 3 Ajaw. I believe the actualseating of the cycle at Tikal took place in 426 (8.19.10.0.0) (see also Ed-monson 1979 : 13 –15), the ten-year midpoint or lajuntun of a K’atun 8Ajaw (416 – 435). It is probably also significant that Siyaj Kan K’awil II’smonument, Stela 31, dates to 445, the lajuntun year of a K’atun 6 Ajaw,the first k’atun of the new 256-year cycle.To explain the significance of intracycle intervals, it is necessary toreturn briefly to Maya calendrics and direct-historical analogy. It is wellknown that the Classic Maya commemorated certain intra-k’atun in-tervals by erecting stelae at the jotun (5 tuns), the half-k’atun lajuntun(lajun, “10” tuns), and the jolajuntun (5 tuns lacking to completion). Theimportance of the ten-year lajuntun interval in the Colonial period wasnoted by Bishop Landa and interpreted by Roys in terms of the succes-sively overlapping decades of rule of the “idols” of the k’atun in theirtemples (Table 4.3):Roys suggests that each katun idol remains in the temple thirty“years” of 360 days each. During the first ten, the idol (B) is a“guest” and acquires power from his predecessor (A) who still has a part to play, but retires at the end of these ten “years.” Dur-04-T2963 6/15/04 2:18 PM Page 111"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"112maya political scienceTable 4.3.Sequence of roles of Postclassic k’atun “idols.”(A)(B)(C)Year13 Ajaw11 Ajaw9 Ajaw7 Ajaw1521–1531Rules1531–1541Shares w/Guest1541–1551Rules1551–1561Shares w/Guest1561–1571Rules1571–1581Shares w/Guest1581–1591RulesSource: Tozzer 1941 : 168, note 885.ing the second ten “years,” B rules alone, receiving sacrifices. Dur-ing the following third ten, B may be said “to share,” still receivingreverence and offerings and his prognostics are still followed, andthe new idol (C) also joins B as “guest,” absorbing power from B during these ten “years” of B’s reign. (Tozzer 1941 : 168n885)With respect to the twenty-year rule of “idol B,” Roys ([1943] 1972 : 81)also noted that “during the last ten years of this time it lost some of itspower,” presumably as it began accruing to its guest, “idol C.”A similar process occurred in human affairs during the Postclassicand early Colonial periods, as the half k’atun was the transitional mo-ment when the kuch, or burden of office, was transferred from the pres-ent k’atun to the next one, and when the lord of the incoming k’atun,the Jaguar Priest (b’alam), was selected or confirmed. At this same mid-k’atun point, other individuals announced their candidacy or applied for the official positions they wished to occupy at the start of the newk’atun ten years hence (Edmonson 1982 : 86n2040).The b’alam’s preliminary initiation took place in a ceremony fiveyears before the k’atun was to begin (i.e., the jolajuntun) (Edmonson1982 : 70n1551). This ceremony is referred to as “taking the plate of thek’atun,” the plate presumably being a shallow ceramic vessel. At thistime the prophecy (mut) for the next k’atun was composed, to be read atthe b’alam’s installation in five years (Edmonson 1982 : xii).

The story begins with the inscription on Stela 2 at the largesite of Ixkun, which mentions a “war” against neighboring Sacul, twelvekilometers to the east. This event occurred on 9.17.9.0.13 (December 19,779), a date near the start of the last tun (or some 11.5 months) beforethe lajuntun ending of 9.17.10.0.0 (November 30, 780). Curiously, per-haps, this “war” was not recorded on the monuments at Sacul, whichmight be taken to indicate that site’s “defeat.” Ten years later, on9.18.0.0.0, both Ixkun and Sacul celebrated the “turning” of the k’atunin the customary way, by erecting carved, dated period-ending monu-ments, Stela 1 at Ixkun and Stela 2 at Sacul (Laporte 2004). Significantly,both monuments record the same event: ruler Ch’iyel of the previouslydefeated site of Sacul visited Ixkun and its victorious lord Rabbit God Kto celebrate the ending of this K’atun 11 Ajaw.Ixkun enjoyed considerable Late Classic growth and construction ac-tivity, and this peaked around a.d.790. But around a.d.800 (or ca.9.18.10.0.0, the midpoint of the new k’atun) the last carved monumentwas erected and piles of stones that Rabbit God K had amassed in theplazas for new construction were abandoned. Laporte (2004) interpretsthis as indicating that Ixkun’s power waned and the site became depen-dent on the impressive site of Ixtonton, 7.5 km to the south. At thistime, Ixtonton began to exhibit significant new Terminal Classic con-struction programs, including elements related to the northern Mayaarea such as mosaic masks with “flowery” noses and drum columns(Laporte 2004).In terms of the model for sequential and overlapping k’atun seats, itcan be suggested that during the ten-year period between 9.17.0.0.0 and9.17.10.0.0, Sacul was a k’atun seat in this part of the Mopán region andIxkun was its “guest” (having been previously selected for this honor).About a year before the lajuntun ending, Ixkun engaged in some sort ofsuccessful ritual jousting — perhaps a ballgame or the taking of cap-tives —with Sacul, demonstrating that it indeed had cosmic sanction tobe the next k’atun seat. Ten years later in 790, at the turning of thek’atun, Sacul’s ruler came to Ixkun to meet with that site’s king in a cer-emony commemorating not only the calendrical interval but also thenew seating of the k’atun in Ixkun. At that point, Sacul began “retiring,”while Ixkun took on the role of fully empowered k’atun seat for the nextten years. In the meantime, Ixtonton had engaged in its own mid-k’atunacquisition of power, and was the incoming “guest” of Ixkun.04-T2963 6/15/04 2:18 PM Page 113"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"114maya political scienceIn 800, then, Ixtonton became the new k’atun seat and Ixkun beganto retire, perhaps, given the unfinished construction, having desired butfailed to continue for a second term as k’atun seat. Considering the newconstruction program at Ixtonton, plus the evidence for occupation con-tinuing into the Postclassic period (Laporte 2004), Ixtonton might wellhave become a new mayseat in the Mopán region. It is of interest, too,that the region’s dated monuments span a narrow interval of a.d.761–825 or only 64 years, which is a quarter of a may.I propose that just as lajuntuns or half-k’atun intervals had signifi-cance in marking transfers of the burden of responsibility of office of thek’atun, so too did half-maycycles. By analogy to Postclassic k’atun pol-itics, during the Classic period, new seats of the maywere determinedhalfway through the 256-year cycle (i.e., 128 years after the original seat-ing). If so, it is likely that a given mayseat governed the cycle only dur-ing the first half; then, during the second half, it shared rule with what-ever city was the incoming mayseat.This can be explained in terms of a mayseat having three, rather thantwo, 128-year burdens, or periods of responsibility, in the same wayk’atun deities had three ten-year terms of office. Say, for example, onDate X it is agreed that Tikal will next seat the may,a responsibil-ity to be fully assumed 128 years, or half a may,later. For those next128 years, Tikal “shared” the maywith the existing seat, as its ascend-ing “guest”; this was the first of Tikal’s three burdens. This arrangementextended until Date Y (\u0004Date X + 128) when the existing mayseat retired; at this point, a K’atun 8 Ajaw, Tikal alone seated and ruled the may,with all the ritual rights and responsibilities thereto ap-pertaining for its second and primary burden of 128 years. Then on Date Z (\u0004Date Y + 128; i.e., 256 years after Date X), the new mayseatwas selected, and it was a “guest,” sharing and absorbing power fromTikal for the last 128 years or third part of Tikal’s term. The entire pro-cess covered 384 years, or 390 tuns, but the core of the maywas the 13-k’atun, 260-tun interval beginning and ending with a K’atun 8 Ajaw.With the mid-mayselection of the new mayseat, a portion of the bur-den of the current maycycle began to be transferred from its presentseat to the new one, with the result that during the third part of the may,the ascending seat was expected to begin shouldering ritual responsibil-ities and activities befitting its new status. By analogy to k’atun idols,the current seat also began to descend, losing power as it accrued to theincoming one. Archaeological evidence suggests that this mid-mayjuncture was accompanied by radically differing roles, historical trajec-tories, or series of events at the mayseat, when comparing the third partto the second.Returning to Tikal and its Middle Classic mayseating, then, the year04-T2963 6/15/04 2:18 PM Page 114"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"tikal as early seat of the may115426 was significant to the Maya because it was a lajuntun, a ten-yeark’atun midpoint, in a k’atun of great significance to the Maya: K’atun 8Ajaw, the terminal k’atun of the 256-year cycle. But, as noted, this par-ticular K’atun 8 Ajaw, spanning the years 416 – 435, was also the k’atunthat ended B’ak’tun 8 and marked the beginning of Cycle 9. I believe thatthe primary burden of Tikal’s Middle Classic mayseating began in 426and lasted 128 years, to circa 554, during which time the site aloneseated the mayand actively participated in regular k’atun celebrationsmarked by the erection of period-ending stelae, as discussed above.The third part of Tikal’s mayseating, from circa 554 to 692, marksthe infamous and enigmatic “hiatus,” a 128-year period in which nomonuments were erected at Tikal. However, instead of being a hallmarkof Tikal’s sudden decline, as it is traditionally viewed, this cessation inmonument erection might have been an intentional change in practiceand an anticipated decline in power of sorts, as another large lowlandsite or sites assumed the role of co-seat of the mayand initiated its/theirown mode of ritual celebration. One candidate for a late Middle Classicmayseat was Caracol in Belize, which began celebrating its new statuswith distinctive Giant Ajaw altars that commemorated eighteen k’atunendings (nearly one and a half 256-year maycycles). Later, in the LateClassic period (see Chap. 5), a similar pattern can be seen: Tikal regu-larly erected stelae during the dominant portion of its term as Late Clas-sic mayseat, from 692 to 810, but not, with one exception, thereafter.OverviewThe existence of a formal, 256-year maypolitico-religious complex with its full architectural, astronomical, and territorial trappings mightseem, on first glance, unlikely to have been functioning in the Preclas-sic period in the Maya lowlands, particularly in the Middle Preclassic.But several lines of evidence suggest that such a complex could have hadits beginnings this early. As outlined in Chapter 3, Edmonson (1988) be-lieves the Calendar Round was in existence by 739 b.c.and the LongCount was initiated in 354 b.c.At the same time, a radial pyramid andE-Group arrangement was being constructed and reconstructed at Tikaland also at Nakbe. Further corroboration comes from the Late Preclas-sic and Early Classic: the meaning of Tikal’s Emblem Glyph, widespreadearly k’atun-ending stelae, and significant events occurring at 128- or256-year intervals. Together, these data support the conjecture that themayin the Maya lowlands was initiated in this area of Petén during thelatter part of the Middle Preclassic.Edmonson (1979 : 14 –15) derived hypothetical Preclassic and Classicmayseatings by counting backward in time in units of\u0002256 years from04-T2963 6/15/04 2:18 PM Page 115"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"116maya political scienceknown Postclassicmayseating dates ,all celebrating the ending of aK’atun 8 Ajaw. These dates correlate remarkably well with the Preclassicconstruction episodes at Tikal’s Mundo Perdido as well as other events inthe Early Classic period. But Tikal was not the only important MiddlePreclassic site in the southern lowlands; other sizable sites —Nakbe isthe closest example — are known. By the Late Preclassic ,however ,Nakbehad lost power and El Mirador had strengthened. Understanding the ex-tent to which these sites shared calendrical ritual with Tikal ,such asseating amaycycle ,rests largely on evidence provided by shared ar-chitectural complexes and early k’atun-ending stelae (Table 4.4).By the end of the Preclassic and beginning of the Early Classic, E-Groups had become the focus of ceremonial architecture at the majorcenters and were widespread throughout the southern lowlands (Aimersand Rice n.d.). These E-Groups played the same role in the Preclassic andEarly Classic periods as did twin-pyramid groups in the Late Classic:they served as theaters in which calendrical ritual—k’atun celebra-tions — as well as dramatic displays of active engagement or agencywithin a divinely directed cosmos were enacted. Their presence at nu-merous sites in Petén and adjacent Belize, as well as in the valley ofGuatemala (Valdés 1997) and the isthmian region (Clark and Hansen2001), testifies to the power of the ideology shared by the participatingcommunities. Sites constructing these complexes and erecting period-ending stelae had formal politico-ritual roles as seats of the k’atun fortwenty-year periods, while another site or sites — for example, Tikal—embraced a more powerful role in controlling calendrics and time itselfby seating the may.Construction of these complexes would have beenpart of the burden or kuch borne by those centers honored by the rightto seat the k’atun.In an idealized maymodel there would be thirteen k’atun seats in ad-dition to (or perhaps including) the mayseat. It is interesting, then, thatshortly after the E-Group assemblages were first recognized, nineteenexamples were identified in a relatively circumscribed area of north-eastern Petén, southern Quintana Roo, and Belize, thirteen “in almostpure form” and six that were “less clear” (Ruppert [1940] 1977 : 222).Since then, these complexes have been identified, often in variant forms,at many other lowland sites (Aimers and Rice n.d.). Given the occur-rence of early monuments, especially k’atun-ending stelae in centralPetén, it is likely that El Zapote and Uolantún, plus El Encanto, Corozal,and El Temblor — all of which have stelae providing information onEarly Classic Tikal rulers and to which early monuments from Tikalwere removed (Martin and Grube 2000 : 27, 33)— also might have hadthese early “observatory” or commemorative assemblages; perhaps also El Perú and even Ixlú.

I would link such a movement of the“seat of power” to changes in the seating of the mayand k’atuns, as wellas to transformations in the institution of kingship (ajawlil) itself, be-ginning around 100 b.c., although it is not unreasonable to suggest thatthere were accompanying shifts among powerful lineages. The likelydominant sites acting as mayseats in the central lowlands for terms of256 years in the Early and Middle Classic would have been Calakmul, ElMirador, Tikal, and Caracol.From the symbol-laden year of 426 ,a forward movement of 128 years(or half amay) brings us to 554. This is the end of the last k’atun (a K’atun9 Ajaw ,534 –554) before the so-called Maya hiatus ,a disjunction in thehistory of the southern lowlands marked most conspicuously by a gap inthe tradition of erecting dated stelae ,as well as by reduced ceremonial-ism and construction and perhaps also lower population densities (Cul-bert and Rice 1990). Usually dated from 534 (9.5.0.0.0) to 593 (9.8.0.0.0)in the lowlands ,at Tikal the hiatus lasted much longer ,from 562 to 692 ,a duration of 130 years or half amay.There ,this interval has been inter-preted as representing an internal power struggle accompanied by a“massive destructive campaign” (Jones 1991 : 117) in which monumentswere defaced and moved. Other suggested causes are the waning of Teoti-huacan’s influence and the abandonment of Tikal by a defeated lineage,which decamped to Dos Pilas. Viewed from the perspective of Caracoland Calakmul ,the hiatus and destruction at Tikal might be seen as theaftermath of its conquest by those apparently allied sites in 562. Fromthe perspective of the Terminal Classic “collapse,” the Middle Classichiatus has been seen metaphorically as a “rehearsal” (Willey 1974).In the context of maycycles and calendrics, however, if mayseatshad very different roles and responsibilities in the first and last halves of their 256-year cycles, the Middle Classic “hiatus” can be interpretedvery differently. Given what is known about the seating of k’atuns andthe mayin the Postclassic and Colonial periods, this momentous eventwas often accompanied by significant conflict among sites, either overthe right to seat the cycle or over the nature of the calendar itself. In ad-dition, the previous seat was ritually terminated.

While the rulers of Tikal during the hiatus are poorlyknown, owing to the absence of stelae texts, there is nonetheless a smat-tering of evidence about them and their rule, including k’atun-endingcelebrations, and much of this evidence comes from tomb pottery of the Ik ceramic complex. Ruler Wak Kan K’awil (a.d.537–562) celebratedthe ending of K’atun 9 Ajaw (9.6.0.0.0; 554), as recorded on a polychromeplate (Martin and Grube 2000 : 39). The next known ruler of Tikal, nick-named Animal Skull, ruled from about 593 to 628 and is believed tohave been sumptuously entombed in Burial 195 (Coe 1990a : 565–568) in Temple 32 in the North Acropolis, Tikal’s traditional royal cemetery.A barrel-shaped vase dating from his rulership featured a glyph band listing early Tikal kings (Martin and Grube 2000 : 41). The massiveTemple V, built in a single episode in the early seventh century, may dateto his reign.A later king, Nun Ujol Chak (formerly Shield Skull), ruled Tikal justbefore the end of the hiatus in monument erection. Possibly a usurper,as he refers only to his matriline, and father of the famous Jasaw KanK’awil (see Chap. 5), he is thought to be the individual interred in Bur-ial 23 (Coe 1990a : 536 –540) in the now-destroyed Temple 33 (Str. 5D-33),which originally stood front and center in the North Acropolis. Amongthe grave goods were three nearly identical Tepeu 1 (early Late Classic)red-slipped polychrome tripod, basal-ridge plates. The interior of each of these vessels was decorated with a quincunx arrangement of ajawglyphs, one in the central base and four around the wall (Culbert1993 : Figs. 39 – 40). The bar-dot numbers (6, 7, 8) accompanying theseajaw glyphs appeared as both prefixes and postfixes and varied fromplate to plate (Table 4.5).Table 4.5.K’atun glyphs painted on three tripod plates from TikalBurial 23.PlateCenterWall Circumference16 Ajaw 68 Ajaw 8, 8 Ajaw 8, 7 Ajaw 7, 8 Ajaw 828 Ajaw 87 Ajaw 8, 8 Ajaw 7, 8 Ajaw 8, 8 Ajaw 838 Ajaw 87 Ajaw 7, 7 Ajaw 7, 7 Ajaw 7, 7 Ajaw 704-T2963 6/15/04 2:18 PM Page 119"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The only K’atuns 8 and 6 Ajaw occurring around this time are thoseending in 692 and 711, respectively, just after Nun Ujol Chak’s reign.However, a K’atun 7 Ajaw ended in the Middle Classic period, 573, withthe lajuntuns of 8 Ajaw and 6 Ajaw occurring ten years before and afterthis date, respectively (i.e., 564 and 583). Perhaps these plates wereplaced in the tomb as heirlooms, or perhaps Burial 23 held the remainsnot of Nun Ujol Chak but of an unknown Tikal king who ruled betweenWak Kan K’awil (537–562) and Animal Skull (593?– 628?). In any event,these dishes seem to be examples of the “plates of the k’atun” referredto in Postclassic texts (cf. Jones 2003).A final point in connection with Early and Middle Classic maycyclesat Tikal concerns the possibility of alternative calendrical cycles. Theevents highlighted here reflect the early significance of maycyclesbased on K’atuns 8 Ajaw. But as indicated in the discussion of the cen-tral Mexican presence at Tikal, another cycle of two roughly 128-yearintervals, from circa 250 to 378 and from 378 to 508, can be identified.In terms of named k’atuns, 250 fell in the second half of the K’atun 13Ajaw of 238 –258; 378 just after the beginning of the K’atun 12 Ajaw of376 –396; and 508 near the end of another K’atun 13 Ajaw (495–514).This is of retrospective interest because by the Postclassic period innorthern Yucatán, major disagreements had developed between two im-portant lineages, the Xiw and the Kokom (Itza), about calendrical cy-cling. The Xiw, like the Classic period Maya of Tikal and elsewhere,counted and recorded k’atuns by their ending dates and completed theirmaycycles of 256 years on the last day of a K’atun 8 Ajaw. The Kokom(Itza), however, counted k’atuns from their initial dates, and their cyclesbegan with a K’atun 13 Ajaw.It appears, then, that different factions existed at Tikal in the EarlyClassic. One, the ruling Jaguar Paw dynasty, favored cycles ending withK’atuns 8 Ajaw. The dissident faction, apparently allied in some waywith central Mexico and Teotihuacan, recognized cycles based onK’atuns 13 Ajaw, using that k’atun as the starting point or, perhaps, thefollowing K’atun 2 Ajaw as the initiation of the maycycle.

The two distinctive elements of his reign and those of hissuccessors (Table 5.1) were a combination of old and new imagery on pe-riod-ending stelae and elaboration of a distinctive architectural settingfor k’atun celebrations, the twin-pyramid complex.

Theeponymous twin pyramids are five-tiered, radially symmetrical struc-tures with a stairway on all four sides, opposing each other on the eastand west sides of the plaza; no temple structure stood atop them. Anorth-south line of paired, uncarved stelae and altars stood in front ofthe eastern pyramid, facing west into the plaza. To the south was a low,rectangular “range structure,” approximately 25 meters long, with ninedoorways. On the north side was a small, square or rectangular stone en-closure, with walls roughly 3 meters high, in which a carved stela-altarpair were set (Fig. 5.2). This northern structure was unroofed and “opento the zenith, whence [the ruler] derives his power” (Aveni 2003 : 161).The twin-pyramid group is a cosmogram, a physical representation of the trilevel and quadripartite Maya cosmos (Guillemin 1968; see also Coggins 1979, 1980). Together the east-west structures of twin-pyramid groups marked the journey of the sun and the moon as they rise in the east and set in the west. The nine-doorway structure in thesouth represents the Underworld, where these celestial bodies dwell after their disappearance in the west (nine is the number of levels andLords of the Underworld).

Given the number of construction tiers (five) of the east-west pyr-amids of Twin-Pyramid Group Q, George F. Guillemin (1968 : 28 –29)thought that a count of these tiers plus the plaza levels could be com-bined to represent the thirteen levels of the heavens and the nine levelsof the Underworld (see Edmonson’s [1986a : 120 –126] discussion of the“birth of the winal” in the Chumayel). Thus the twin-pyramid com-plexes symbolize the trajectories of celestial bodies both in the sky andin the Underworld.According to Guillemin (1968 : 9), Tikal’s “twin pyramid arrange-ments are mainly an imitation of the Great Plaza which, in turn, wouldrepresent an enlarged version of the North Acropolis.” He emphasizedwhat is now called the “triadic group” arrangement that can be seen in the Early Classic North Acropolis: three structures arranged to the north, east, and west sides of a patio (Strs. 5D-22, -23, and -24). In the Late Classic Great Plaza this arrangement was enlarged, with the en-tire North Acropolis — resting place of the Tikal dynasty’s ancestors —serving as the northern point of the triad, flanked by Temples 1 and 2facing each other across the open plaza.

The entire Great Plaza itself thus represents a macro-scaletwin-pyramid group.I do not disagree with this interpretation, but I would add that theeast-west radial platforms of twin-pyramid groups represent a directlink to the E-Group arrangements of the Preclassic and Early and MiddleClassic periods. In these earlier complexes, a western radial pyramidstood across a plaza from a tripartite temple structure that marked solarpositions, where lines of stelae, usually commemorating k’atun end-ings, were erected. In the case of twin-pyramid groups, the eastern struc-ture was an identical radial pyramid, and the variable numbers of stelaein front of it were plain rather than carved. Thus the Late Classic twin-pyramid groups maintained east as the primary ritual direction, thoughslightly diminished through lack of architectural differentiation.

The firsttwin-pyramid “group” at Tikal, Group 5E-1sub, was simply a pair of radial temples and lacked the distinctive stela enclosure and nine-doorway palace of the Late Classic complexes (Jones 1985 : 51; 1991 :114). The temples may date to the reign of Jasaw Kan K’awil’s father(Valdés and Fahsen 2004), although they might have been built as earlyas 475 (Schele and Mathews 1998 : 67). In any case, their stairways were“refurbished at least twice” (Jones 1985 : 51) before they were destroyedby Late Classic construction of an overlying ballcourt and radial templewith Veracruz-style talud-tablero and flaring cornice in the East Plaza. Itis not known if the other undated twin-pyramid assemblages, 4D-2 and5B-1, also date to the Middle Classic, although this is certainly possiblegiven their incomplete or damaged status.In the Late Classic, beginning in 692, five twin-pyramid complexeswere built at twenty-tun intervals, the carved monuments in the stelaenclosure dating to successive k’atun endings. In other words, Jasaw Kan K’awil I and his successors commemorated k’atun endings from9.13.0.0.0 (692) through 9.18.0.0.0 (790) in these complexes. The onlyexception to this pattern is the period ending at 9.15.0.0.0 (731); thisevent might have been celebrated in the small Twin-Pyramid Group O,lying across the Maler Causeway directly west of Groups R and Q. Thestela-altar pair in the northern enclosure of Group O is plain rather thansculptured, and thus undated, and might reflect Jasaw Kan K’awil’s ab-sence from the site while visiting Copán on that occasion (see below).The Late Classic span of celebrating k’atun endings, from Jasaw KanK’awil I’s accession in 682 to the last sequential k’atun-ending monu-ment in 810, lasted 128 years, half a maycycle.The idealized maymodel postulates thirteen k’atun seats withinTikal’s sphere, which would have erected twin-pyramid groups to com-memorate k’atun endings. However, during Tikal’s Late and TerminalClassic period mayseating, only five proposed k’atun seats in Tikal’srealm —Yaxhá, Ixlú, Zacpetén, Chalpate, and Uolantún — appear to haveconstructed twin-pyramid complexes, and none of these has been se-curely dated.Yet there is epigraphic evidence that Tikal did indeed have thirteenprovinces or k’atun seats in its Late Classic realm.

On H.S. 2, Steps III and IV display the EmblemGlyph of Tikal plus the glyphs for thirteen tzuk (parts, provinces) and u kab’iy (Schele and Mathews 1998 : 70). This last is read as representingagency —“by,” “under the auspices of”— or as indicating subordinate relations to a political overlord. On H.S. 4, Step III refers to the Tikallord as “he of thirteen provinces” (Boot 2002). These texts, then, refer to “thirteen provinces of Tikal,” which could be simply a Maya meta-phor for “many dead in Tikal’s realm,” or it could mean that Tikal lit-erally had thirteen provinces or dependencies — thirteen k’atun seats —within its domain. Among these proposed k’atun seats are Uaxactún,Yaxhá, Nakum, Xultún, Motul de San José, Ixlú, Zacpetén, Chalpate,and Uolantún.Jasaw Kan K’awil died in 734 and was buried in a splendid chamber(Burial 116; Coe 1990a : 604 – 609) under Tikal’s Temple 1. Shortly beforehe died, he (or a representative) traveled to Copán to participate in themeeting of lords of four major sites (Copán, Tikal, Palenque, and Calak-mul), as commemorated on Copán Stela A. That he was truly a states-man of some “international” renown is suggested by the discovery ofthirty-seven delicately incised bone fragments in his tomb, the fine linesaccentuated by cinnabar. One of these bones bears a date correspondingto October 26, 726, and refers to the death of Ruler 2 at Dos Pilas; an-other refers to the death of a woman possibly from Cancuen on Janu-ary 24, 727 (Harrison 1999 : 140). Painted pottery cylinders in the tombmight represent gifts from other lowland kings (Coggins 1975 : 515).Tikal’s Late Classic MonumentsInsights into the Late Classic seating of the mayat Tikal also can begleaned from the iconography and themes of k’atun-ending stelae atTikal, in twin-pyramid complexes and elsewhere at the site, and monu-ments at other sites in the central Petén lakes region (see Christie 1995;Graham 1973; Stuart 1988; Chase 1985; Morley 1937–1938 : 415– 448;also Marcus 1976; Proskouriakoff 1993). These valedictory monumentsdisplay a shared program of shapes, styles, and themes, including thepresence of the Tikal Emblem Glyph and commemoration of k’atun-and lajuntun-ending intervals (Rice 1997) and the following:• Calendrics: These monuments rarely use Initial Series dates; in-stead they record dates by the Calendar Round. They typicallycommemorate period endings, especially k’atuns (20 tuns or05-T2963 6/15/04 2:19 PM Page 126"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"tikal’s late and terminal classic seating of the may1277,200 days; approximately 20 years) and also lajuntun intervals(half-k’atuns of 10 tuns, or 3,600 days). Jotuns (5 tuns, 1,800 days)and jolajuntuns (15 tuns) are recorded only rarely, and are knownprimarily from “peripheral sites” (Proskouriakoff 1993 : 184).• Primary theme: The central personage is extravagantly attired in an elaborate feathered headdress and often a jaguar-pelt kilt,bearing a backrack, carrying in one arm a ceremonial staff or bar,and performing the “scattering” rite with the other hand. Many of these details echo the costuming of the ruler on the MiddleClassic period-ending and “staff” stelae. In particular, the cere-monial bar appears to be a smaller version of the tripartite, knot-ted staffs of the Early Classic, with diamond-shaped rather thancurved bars and cradled in the arm rather than held vertically infront of the ruler.• Secondary theme: The ruler is often shown standing atop or infront of bound, prone captives; sometimes the captive is depictedalone on an altar. The prone position is unusual, compared to themore typical kneeling posture. Seated captives are also shown onthree “column altars” (possible ballcourt markers), two of whichhave rope borders, but only one is dated (Column Altar 1, at9.15.17.10.4 10 K’an 12 Pax; December 12, 748) (Jones and Sat-terthwaite 1982 : Fig. 62). The depiction of prone prisoners onk’atun-ending stelae was also seen in the Early and Middle Clas-sic periods (Chap. 4) beginning with Tikal Stela 29 at 292. Theirappearance recalls the alternative meanings of k’atun,“combat,”“battle,” or “warrior.”• Mat and rope motifs often appear as borders on the edges of altarsand stelae or as separators creating quadripartite divisions of thedecorative space.The “scattering” gesture and glyph (T710; Stuart 1984) are significantnew elements of Tikal’s Late Classic k’atun celebrations and the icono-graphic program of these monuments, which otherwise are very similarto the site’s Early Classic stelae. This glyph and gesture, an open handwith dots falling from it, is read u chok’-wa ch’aj‘he scatters drops,’ butgives no clue as to what those “drops” might be. In the DiccionarioMaya-Español, chok’is translated as “to pour water, salt, or other thingsby handfuls”; other definitions suggest that it refers to pouring drygoods rather than liquids, although ch’ajmeans “drops.”Thus the images of scattering have been interpreted as the ruler dis-persing seeds or grains (e.g., maize, beans), crystals, or incense, perhapsin divination. More recently, it has been viewed as the ruler’s blood sac-rifice on period-ending dates (Stuart 1988 : 187, 188).

The mid-second-century a.d. stela from La Mojarra, Veracruz, has numerous tex-tual references to scattering or sprinkling, using an open hand glyph,although there are no period-ending dates (Kaufman and Justeson 2001).The much earlier Humboldt Celt, possibly dating to as early as 900 b.c.,may show an “iconic” reference to the scattering rite (Justeson1986: Fig. 3e). In the Middle Classic, the scattering gesture and/or glyphmay be earliest associated with k’atun endings on Yaxchilán Stela 27 at9.4.0.0.0 13 Ajaw (514; Coggins 1983 : 53n22) and Caracol Stela 1, dated9.8.0.0.0 (593).Tikal’s eight Late Classic stelae and their paired altars, dating be-tween 9.13.0.0.0 (692) and 9.19.0.0.0 (810), constitute the largest andbest-preserved corpus of such sculpture from central Petén. The monu-ment sequence is summarized below.Tikal Stela 30 (Fig. 5.3) and Altar 14 (Fig. 5.4), dated to the k’atun end-ing (9.13.0.0.0) 8 Ajaw 8 Wo (March 16, 692), were set in the intention-ally destroyed (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982 : 62) Twin-Pyramid Com-plex M (3D-1 in Group H), adjacent to the northern end of the laterMaudslay Causeway. Three plain altars stood before the eastern pyra-mid of the group.

He carries a tripartite staff and wears a back ornamentbearing a mask of the Maize God, which Bricker (1984 : 229, 1989 : 239)suggests may be a reference to the burden of the Ix Yearbearer. Ix, how-ever, is not a Classic yearbearer but rather a Postclassic one. The stelatext includes the k’al tun(stone binding) glyph, which Stuart (1996 : 156)suggests may refer to the walled enclosure within which the monumentwas set. Altar 14 is all-glyphic and displays an 8 Ajaw in the “GiantAjaw” Caracol style.

She also notes thatthe ruler’s back ornament or burden displays a mask with a defleshedjaw, suggesting it represents a victim of human sacrifice or, as in thePostclassic and Colonial periods, the death god burden of Kawak years(Bricker 1984 : 229; 1989 : 237, 246). Again, however, Kawak (like Ix) isnot a Classic yearbearer but a Postclassic one.The face of Stela 21 has two glyphic panels, the uppermost of whichis eroded and unreadable. Thus a missing dedication date had to be re-constructed on the basis of a Calendar Round distance number date inthe lower panel and yielded 9.15.5.0.0 10 Ajaw 8 Ch’en (July 24, 736)(Jones and Satterthwaite 1982 : 47– 48). I am rather suspicious of thisnon-k’atun-ending date on the monument, because iconographically it is almost exactly a copy of the later Stela 22 (see below), dating to9.17.0.0.0, and scattering is normally a k’atun-ending ritual. In addition,the text uses almost verbatim the couplet structure (Harris and Stearns1997 : 102 –105) on the lower panel of the ruler’s son’s monument, Stela22. However, as noted, the ruler Jasaw Kan K’awil was reportedly inCopán on the occasion of the k’atun ending in 731 and there is noknown monument to that date. Yik’in Kan K’awil, who is named onStela 21, did not accede until 734, and perhaps he celebrated this jotuncompletion in lieu of the earlier missed k’atun ending.The surviving text on the lower panel of Stela 21, paraphrased in thestyle of that of Stela 22, reads: “Holy Tikal ruler, 4 k’atun kalomte’ [Dis-tance Number 12 k’ins, 11 winals, 1 tun] on 3 Lamat 6 Pax he was seated05-T2963 6/15/04 2:19 PM Page 133"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"figure5.7 Tikal Stela 21 ([9.15.5?.0.0] 10 Ajaw 8 Ch’en; July 24, 736?), found nearthe Temple of the Inscriptions (Temple VI), shows the ruler Yik’in Kan K’awil (Jonesand Satterthwaite 1982 : Fig. 31; drawing by William R.

Altar 2 is heavily eroded but has a quadripartite division and upper rope border. Yik’in’s victory overNaranjo, including the capture of its king and his palanquin, was cele-brated on Lintel 3 of Temple IV.

The stelacelebrates the end of the first k’atun of Yik’in Kan K’awil’s (Ruler B)reign. He wears a God K headdress and is neither scattering nor carryinga ceremonial bar. Instead, he stands in front of a jaguar throne, holdinga halberd or long staff with three embedded blades (reminiscent of theclub on earlier Uaxactún Stela 5) in front of him and a bag in his lefthand, and wearing a backrack holding a large supernatural head. Altar 8(Fig. 5.11) shows a prone, bound noble captive named Wilan Tok Wayib’,who has a wuk tzuktitle linking him to the Naranjo-Yaxhá region andwho was sacrificed on December 10, 748 (Martin and Grube 2000 : 50). Itwas earlier suggested that this captive might have died in a ballgame(Schele and Miller 1986 : 249).Tikal Stela 22 and Altar 10, dated (9.17.0.0.0) 13 Ajaw 18 Kumk’u(January 22, 771), were placed in the stela enclosure of Twin-PyramidComplex Q (4E-4; Fig. 5.2), east of the Maler Causeway. Nine plain stelae-altar pairs sit in front of the eastern radial structure. Stela 22(Fig. 5.12) is very slightly wedge-shaped and asymmetrical, a trait thatbecomes much more prominent in the Terminal Classic. It depicts theTikal ruler Yax Nun Ayin II (formerly known as Ruler C or Kitam), second son of Yik’in Kan K’awil and probable grandson of Jasaw KanK’awil I (Martin and Grube 2000 : 51). He is the twenty-ninth and last in the long Jaguar Paw dynasty of Tikal and the builder of two twin-pyramid complexes. Yax Nun Ayin II is shown barefoot, performing ascattering rite, carrying a tripartite bar and a long conical bag, and wear-ing a jaguar-pelt kilt, with the same death god mask in his back orna-ment as is shown on Stela 21.

Farther to the east andsoutheast, sites in the vicinity of Lake Yaxhá show iconographic ties, al-though this region of eastern Petén was in territory contested by Tikal,Calakmul, Caracol, and Naranjo (see Chap. 6).In 1921, on the Tayasal peninsula, Morley found three stelae and alintel around Structure T123 in Structure Group 25 (formerly Plaza A).This is probably a radial structure, described as a platform approxi-mately 5.8 x 5.8 meters in the center of the plaza, topped with a small,square structure with a doorway on each side (Chase 1983 : 468, 976).Fragmentary Stela 1 ,tentatively dated to (9.17.0.0.0) 13 Ajaw 18 Kumk’u(January 22, 771), shows “a human figure seated cross-legged on a maskpanel . . . [holding] a Ceremonial Bar in his left arm, the right hand grasp-ing some other object” (Morley 1937–1938 : 427). “Stela” 2, possibly alintel and in fragmentary condition, was discovered 11 meters north ofStructure T123 and provisionally dated (9.19.0.0.0) 9 Ajaw 18 Mol(June 26, 810).

Still a thirdpossibility is that the Emblem might refer to the recently discoveredlarge site known as Nixtun-Ch’ich’ on the Candelaria peninsula on thewestern shore of Lake Petén Itzá. Regardless, these sites or the region arethe only one(s) in the immediate Lake Petén Itzá region to have theirown Emblem Glyphs (Stuart and Houston 1994 : 28, Fig. 28; see alsoProskouriakoff 1993 : 150 –151). The site referenced by the “Ik’ Emblem”was one of four Terminal Classic capitals named on Stela 10 at Seibal(Marcus 1973, 1976). Motul Stela 1, broken and badly eroded, was pro-visionally dated to (9.19.0.0.0) 9 Ajaw 18 Mol (June 26, 810), whereasStela 2 was thought to date a k’atun later, (10.0.0.0.0) 7 Ajaw 18 Sip(March 13, 830) (Morley 1937–1938 : 417). However, the scene of twodancers on Stela 2 suggests it dates no later than 9.19.0.0.0 (Proskouri-akoff 1993 : 150 –151).Lakes Yaxhá and Sacnab are the easternmost lakes in the Petén chain.The toponyms of the sites of Yaxhá, Topoxté (both of which had EmblemGlyphs but Topoxte’s lacked the k’ulprefix), and Sacnab are known fromglyphic texts on Classic period monuments (Stuart and Houston1994 : 5–7, 29), and these may be among the few place-names of thePetén lakes region to survive from Classic glyphic texts into twentieth-century use. Toponyms for both sites appear on monuments at Naranjo,Tikal, and La Naya.Yaxhá, on the north shore of Lake Yaxhá, shows strong affiliations inmaterial culture with Tikal, including an apparently unfinished twin-pyramid complex, but its inscriptions record repeated conquests byNaranjo, 12 kilometers to the northeast. Yaxhá’s monuments are pri-marily Early Classic in date, and the bases of several, including Stelae 4,6, and 10, have evidence of an earlier style of carving. This is also knownon Actun Can Stela 1 and Nakbe Stela 1 (see also Justeson and Mathews1983; Hammond 1982). Only two Late Classic stelae are known fromYaxhá.Stela 13 was found recumbent in front of the westernmost pyramidin the site’s twin-pyramid complex rather than in the stela enclosure. Itshows a ruler depicted in frontal view, scattering, with a small ancestorfigure peering down from the sky. The stela has a full basal panel underthe standing figure. Proskouriakoff (1993 : 150) believed the monumentcommemorated the lajuntun of 9.17.10.0.0 12 Ajaw 8 Pax (November 30,780), while suggesting that the twin-pyramid complex (in which Stela13 was found) dates to 9.18.0.0.0 or later. Schele and Grube (1995 :80; Grube 2000b : 262) interpret the three dates on the monument as a series at peculiar four-year intervals: a possible date on the right mightbe 9.17.19.0.0 3 Ajaw 13 Pax (December 6, 789), the date on the front ofthe monument is 9.18.3.0.0 12 Ajaw 3 Mak (September 23, 793), and the05-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 145"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"146maya political scienceone on the left side of the text records 9.18.7.0.0 9 Ajaw 3 Kej (Septem-ber 2, 797).Yaxhá’s last dated monument is Stela 31, at 9.18.5.16.4 3 K’an 12 Yax(August 2, 796) (Grube 2000b : 262 –263; cf. Schele and Grube 1995 : 80,82), and records a capture. The main figure is dancing with a smallbound prisoner seated in front of him; a full basal panel is under his feet.The Topoxté Islands lie off the southwestern shore of Lake Yaxhánear the mouth of the Río Ixtinto. Four sculptured stelae (Lundell 1934;Grube 2000b : 267–268), as well as other small plain stelae in the mainplaza, are known from the islands. Stelae 1 and 2 were found on the mainisland, Topoxté, west of the small, low platform opposite Structure D,the central structure of the island’s Postclassic temple assemblage. Stela 3 was found in the center of Paxte Island at the southeast corner ofa low platform, and Stela 4 was similarly positioned on Cante Island.Stelae 2 and 3 mention the Yaxhá Emblem Glyph and also the toponymfor Topoxté itself, although the latter lacks the affixes for k’ul‘divine’and ajaw‘lord’. Stela 2 shows a figure depicted frontally, holding a staff;Stela 3 is a distinctly asymmetrical monument showing a seated figure.The Topoxté toponym also is known from Altar 5 at Tikal and a poly-chrome cylinder vase of unknown provenience (Grube 2000b:252).Interpretations: Tikal’s Late Classic MaySeatingDuring the Late Classic period, the sites and populations around LakePetén Itzá were subordinate to the site of Tikal to the north. Specifically,they were rotating k’atun seats (jetz’ k’atun) within the realm Tikalruled as seat of the 256-year maycycle of thirteen k’atuns.The late monuments of the Tikal realm have been described as sty-listically conservative because they primarily depict standard royal por-traiture scenes (Mathews 1985 : 52; Jones 1991 : 120; Miller 1993 : 362).The mythical or historical ancestors floating in scrolls of clouds, blood,or smoke from burning incense above the principal figure are consideredarchaisms, because they harken back to Early Classic Tikal Stela 31 andother monuments. However, as I have argued earlier (Rice 1997), I be-lieve this “conservatism” is not a mere stylistic rerun but rather a ma-jor politico-religious revitalization asserting dynastic revival and power(see also Martin and Grube 2000 : 44 –53).Significantly, these Late Classic stelae at and around Tikal display anumber of themes, images, and elements that have precedents in thesite’s Early and Middle Classic monuments celebrating k’atun endings.The ruler’s regalia is of special importance, typically a jaguar-skin kiltand a feathered backrack holding a deity image; in the Middle Classic,05-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 146"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"tikal’s late and terminal classic seating of the may147rulers wore nearly identical sandals, whereas in the Late Classic theywere sometimes depicted barefoot. Throughout the Classic period,rulers held knotted staffs or bars; in the Middle Classic, they were tri-partite and held vertically in front; and in the Late Classic, they weremore elaborate and cradled in one or both arms. Rulers stood on or infront of prone, bound captives, or captives appeared on paired altars. Thesides or peripheries of the altars were often encircled by ropes, some-times joining four mat motifs that established quadripartite space; sim-ilar altars are also seen on carved lintels (see Fig. 5.9) depicting rulersseated on thrones. And divine ancestors floated above the ruler in cloudsof incense smoke in the Late and especially the Terminal Classic.How does the imagery on these Classic monuments conform to theimagery and ritual of the k’atun and mayceremonies as known or re-constructed from the early Colonial period lowlands? We have seen thatthese ceremonies were celebrated in “dramas” of thirteen “acts.” Eight(perhaps ten) of these can be posited to have direct material connectionsto the Late Classic period-ending celebrations taking place in Tikal’stwin-pyramid groups.Act 8: Ceremonial Circuit (and/or Act 11: Pacing of the K’atun).Thiswas a counterclockwise procession around the town or the realm, pre-sumably led by priests or the ruler and involving measurement of theland and confirmation of land titles. Similar processionals occurred aspart of annual Wayeb’ rites (Coe 1965) and in modern times. At variouspoints in the b’ak’tun ceremony held in 1618 (Edmonson 1986 : 25–27),god-impersonators, priests, or yearbearers conducted fire ritual and car-ried World Tree symbols and surveying sticks (p’iz te). These might beanalogs of the staffs and bars carried by rulers depicted on Classic stelae.It is likely that ritual circuits originated in the Preclassic or earlier: at the Late Preclassic site of Izapa on the Pacific coast, the placement of some two hundred fifty stone monuments in various plazas may have been in accordance with a ceremonial procession (Lowe, Lee, andMartínez 1982 : 31; Kappelman 2001; Rice n.d.a). With reference to theClassic period, Baudez (1991) discussed such perambulations commem-orating Late Classic period endings, especially k’atun endings, at Copán.He viewed the sites as cosmograms and argued that such ritual pro-cessions would have been associated with radial temples and other cru-ciform structures, including orthogonal causeways, or sakb’es. He alsonoted relationships between these kinds of structures and the represen-tation of the Maya tzolk’in calendar in the Madrid Codex, with its fourarms to the cardinal directions and footprints marking symbolic ritualpaths.

Indeed,the locations of several sequentially built twin-pyramid groups suggestthat they themselves may have marked counterclockwise circuitsaround the site by the late Late Classic (Fig. 5.16): beginning with Com-plex M (constructed in 692) in the north, a procession would movesouthwest along the Maudslay Causeway to Complex N (711) lying atthe west end of the Tozzer Causeway, then northeastward (withoutbenefit of an extant causeway) to Complex O (731?), and from therealong the northern half of the Maler Causeway to Complex P (751), justto the east of Complex M.Such processions could have been initiated in earlier examples ofthese assemblages, but these are not well dated because carved stelae05-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 148"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"tikal’s late and terminal classic seating of the may149were not found in the northern enclosures.

Presumably next in the sequence, to judge from a counterclockwise perambulation, would be Group 4D-2to the northwest, south of the Maudslay Causeway. The third in this hy-pothetical sequence would be Group 5B-1, farther to the southwest, wellaway from causeways. If the procession model holds, I would not be sur-prised if a fourth twin-pyramid group, not yet identified archaeologi-cally, might lie somewhere to the south or southeast of the Great Plazato complete the ritual circuit. It would probably lie under Group G, theTemple of the Inscriptions, or the Late Classic Méndez Causeway,which joins these complexes to the Great Plaza. In any case, these com-plexes could have celebrated k’atun endings beginning perhaps as earlyas 9.2.0.0.0.The next twin-pyramid complex, Group M, well dated at 692, repre-sents a reinvigorated Late Classic tradition and a new circuit, describedabove, inaugurated by the new ruler, Jasaw Kan K’awil I, who may havebegun erecting carved stelae in the northern enclosures. It is of interestthat these hypothesized processions begin near, and may have continuedto pass through, the Great Plaza.Act 9: Seating of the K’atun (and/or Act 12: Counting of the Mats).In the Colonial period, the new b’alam, or jaguar priest, of the k’atuntook his place on the “mat of the k’atun” in the cycle seat after havingbeen selected ten years earlier in mid-k’atun. No evidence of this part ofthe ceremonies is clearly seen on the period-ending stelae, althoughStela 20 and other representations (e.g., lintels) show rulers sitting on jaguar skin – covered seats or stools marked on the sides with matmotifs. In this light, the altars with mat motifs in Late Classic twin-pyramid groups could be symbolic thrones.Act 10: Seating of the Yearbearers.This probably represents the seat-ing of the yearbearer for the incoming year. As discussed above, some ofthe rulers shown on the stelae are carrying a burden, or kuch, repre-sented by an elaborate backrack holding a deity head, which may be theyearbearer or other quadripartite god such as skybearers or the gods ofwind, sun, death, rain and lightning, and fire.Act 11: Pacing of the K’atun.This may have been similar to or a com-ponent of the procession in Act 8.Act 12: Dawn.At this time the mats of the lords were “counted” (i.e.,ranked) and candidates for various civic and ritual duties in the comingperiod declared their intentions. Again, as in Act 9, this may be alludedto by the presence of quadripartite mat motifs on the sides of altars, sig-nifying the establishment of ritual order in the four corners of the world.05-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 149"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"150maya political scienceAct 13: Sacrifice (see also Act 16: Penance).In the Colonial period,sacrifices were carried out in a variety of ways —heart removal, hanging,burning, drowning — all accompanied by music. At Tikal, the sacrificialvictim is clearly the prone, bound prisoner lying under or behind theruler’s feet or on the accompanying altar. This distinctive imagery wasalso present on Early Classic period-ending monuments. In the Late andTerminal Classic, if not earlier, sacrifice was carried out in the contextof ballgame ritual (see Chap. 8).Act 14: Examination.This consisted of a ceremonial feast and ritualriddling, an interrogation intended to demonstrate the rulers’ knowl-edge and therefore their right to rule. At Late Classic Tikal, this activitymight have taken place in the nine-doorway palace on the southern sideof the plaza complex, or elsewhere at the site, perhaps in a popol naj(council house).Act 15: The Word.In the Postclassic and Colonial periods, the newchilam, the “speaker” of the jaguar priest, announced the prophecy, or“word” (mut), for the upcoming k’atun with grandly poetic imagery.This probably has no surviving material counterparts, as the prophecyand history of the k’atuns were doubtless scribed in bark-paper books.Act 16: Penance.This is likely a reference to bloodletting by the year-bearers, the priesthood, and the jaguar priest. It is probably representedon Classic stelae by references to bloodletting and “scattering.” In thebooks of the chilam b’alams, there is also frequent mention of objectsand containers, such as rattles, gourds, bowls, plates, and cups of thek’atun, which might be identifiable in Classic period material culture.For example, Late Classic plates of the k’atun — slipped ceramic vesselswith painted central Ajaw glyphs —were found in burials: a plate inTikal Burial 77 was painted with 13 Ajaw 12 (a.d.771, 780), and aneroded but similarly painted vessel came from Burial 191. (Elsewhere, atTopoxté, Burial 49 included an orange-polychrome tripod plate withAjaw 13 painted in the center [Hermes 2000 : Fig. 142.1], and in Burial128 at Altar de Sacrificios, two tripod plates — painted red over an orangebackground, with a green stuccoed rim —bore a 12 Ajaw in the center[Adams 1971 : 66, 76 –78, Fig. 89]. These plates, which Richard E. W.Adams describes as possible imports from the Usumacinta area, accom-panied a high-status individual who is believed to have died between9.16.2.0.0 and 9.16.3.0.0. A 12 Ajaw day falls on November 12, 753[9.16.2.10.0 12 Ajaw 3 Muwan].)Act 17: Commemoration of the Ancestors.Given Colonial period ref-erences to the erection of stelae (at Mayapán), wooden poles, and thencrosses every twenty years in Yucatán, it requires no stretch of the imag-ination to envision that this was when a stone stela was erected or un-wrapped (Stuart 1996) during the Classic period and even earlier in the05-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 150"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"tikal’s late and terminal classic seating of the may151Preclassic. That in the Late Classic these stelae were erected in thenorthern portion of a plaza, symbolic home of the ancestors, and thatboth early and late monuments in the Tikal region depicted symbolicancestors (Paddlers) in the “sky” above the ruler, establishes a clear pre-cursor of this Colonial period practice.The last three acts of the Late Postclassic and early Colonial periodcelebrations (Act 18: Counting of the K’atun; Act 19: Farce; and Act 20:Sermon) have no immediately recognizable material correlates in theClassic record at Tikal. They likely were public dramas, dances, andother rituals enacted on the summits of the twin pyramids to entertainand inspire awe in a populace gathered in the plaza below.Tikal and Its MayRealm in the Terminal Classic PeriodIn the past twenty years or so ,there have been major shifts in thinkingabout the Terminal Classic and Postclassic periods in both the northernand southern lowlands (Chase and Rice 1985; Sabloff and Andrews 1986;Webster 2002; Demarest ,Rice ,and Rice 2004). In both areas ,Postclassiclowland Maya civilization is recognized as something distinctly differ-ent from that of the Classic period ,but the strong continuities that existare rarely highlighted (cf. Marcus 1993). The Terminal Classic is the pe-riod during which these continuities and changes sorted themselves out.In the southern lowlands, the Terminal Classic is traditionally iden-tified with the so-called collapse of Classic Maya civilization, charac-terized by the cessation of erection of carved, dated stelae; a decline inarchitectural construction, mortuary ritual, and polychrome potteryproduction; and the abandonment of large Classic period centers. TheTerminal Classic demise has been interpreted as reflecting widespreadsocial, political, economic, dynastic, and demographic upheaval. Giventhis catastrophist scenario, it is not surprising that when addressing theTerminal Classic in the southern lowlands, archaeologists have tendedto focus rather single-mindedly on determining the cause(s) for the col-lapse (see Culbert 1973), including war, invasion, epidemic disease, andnatural disasters. Subsequent investigations, however, have acknowl-edged that the crisis was first apparent in the arena of elite power (e.g.,the fall of some dynasties) and the region was not totally depopulated.The mayhypothesis posits a different scenario. In this model, theTerminal Classic period is the second half of Tikal’s “official” tenure asfull Late Classic mayseat beginning in the K’atun 8 Ajaw of 672 to 692(its earlier role as incoming “guest” would have coincided with the 128-year hiatus, during which it was also the outgoing seat; see Chap. 4).During the first half of its full tenure, 692 – 820, Tikal ruled alone as mayku;then during the second half, 820 – 948, the next K’atun 8 Ajaw, Tikal05-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 151"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"152maya political sciencewould have shared rule with the incoming cycle seat. During this latterinterval, as during the last half of its Middle Classic maycycle, Tikalwould have experienced an expected and preordained reduction of ac-tivity in its architectural and iconographic programs. Through this lineof reasoning, I consider the Terminal Classic period, traditionally datedcirca 790/800 – 950/1000 in the southern lowlands, to encompass the128-year interval from 820 to 948; in the Maya calendar, this is from9.19.10.0.0 8 Ajaw 8 Xul to 10.6.0.0.0 8 Ajaw 8 Yax.Monuments and ThemesOnly one period-ending stela is known to have been erected at Tikal it-self during the Terminal Classic period, but sites of probable k’atunseats within its realm regularly celebrated k’atun and lajuntun endingsby erecting carved, dated monuments. Similar shapes and a sharediconographic program plus display of the Tikal Emblem Glyph on thesestelae and altars bespeak continued recognition of Tikal as a politico-religious power in northeastern Petén (Rice 1997). Terminal Classicmonuments in the realm maintained many of the characteristics of theLate Classic styles, as described above, and added others:• Shape: Instead of being parallel-sided, Terminal Classic stelae of-ten exhibit marked asymmetry and are “wedge-shaped,” broaderat the top and narrower at the base.• Calendrics: These monuments celebrate period-ending dates, es-pecially k’atuns and lajuntuns, and there is relatively scant refer-ence to completion of b’ak’tun 9, on 10.0.0.0.0, in 830. As on theLate Classic monuments, dates on these late stelae are shown asCalendar Round rather than Long Count dates and as such are pri-marily reconstructions.• Primary theme: As on Late Classic stelae, Terminal Classic mon-uments in the Tikal region show a central dignitary who wears afeathered headdress and jaguar-pelt kilt, carries a ceremonial staffor bar, and scatters. He is often standing atop or in front of bound,prone captives, which may also appear on an accompanying altar.• Secondary theme: Many Terminal Classic stelae highlight thePaddler Gods (or sky figures, cloud riders; Marcus 1992a : 297;Proskouriakoff 1993 : 185), one to four humanlike figures en-twined in large scrolls or S-shapes with dotted borders floatingabove the central personage.• Additional iconographic elements and themes are quadripartitedesigns, mat and rope motifs, and all-glyphic monuments.05-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 152"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"tikal’s late and terminal classic seating of the may153• Location: Some Terminal Classic or Cycle 10 stelae in Petén arefound at sites with significant Postclassic occupation, many sug-gesting repositioning or reuse.The theme of “cloud riders” in dotted scrolls on these stelae meritsfurther discussion. For a time the S-shapes or scrolls were believed torepresent blood, a sacred substance that serves as “a physical back-ground for supernatural beings” (Stuart 1988 : 184), and the logograph forcloud (muyal,T632; Stuart and Houston 1994 : 44 – 45, Fig. 51). They canalso be identified as the undulating, serpentlike Milky Way, path to theMaya Underworld of Xibalba, and Hofling (pers. comm., September 19,1996) connects them to serpents, the Vision Serpent, in particular. TheVision Serpent is also seen on the Hauberg Stela, dated a.d.197, whichshows the ruler letting blood, with four small human or god figures —forerunners of the Late Classic Paddlers — clambering around the ser-pent’s body; an ancestor head looks down from the Vision Serpent’smouth.I believe, however, that these “cloud scrolls” or representations of“blood” are instead representations of clouds of smoke of burning in-cense, the congealed sap of the copal tree (Protium copal) or otherresinous trees or shrubs. The key here is the dots that line the scrolls:these are the same dots that are part of the glyph for incense, or pom(T647, 687), and the dots that are shown in the scattering glyph and ges-ture. They are also the dots that surround the “k’ul” element of EmblemGlyphs identifying mayand k’atun seats and ajaws as divine. Similarly,these dots occur in a number of other glyphs where, I believe, they func-tion to indicate a sacred, ritual, or divine element or essence. Incense orpom is the substance used by the Maya to cleanse, purify, and sanctifysacred space and also to call forth the ancestors; incense may be burnedin pottery incensarios or molded into balls and studded with beads as of-ferings. Related to this, a verb (ati) associated with these scenes of hu-man figures riding on clouds has recently been deciphered as “to bathe,”with the interpretation “‘bathing the ritual’ . . . [as] an act of consecra-tion [through] ritual purification” (Stuart, Houston, and Robertson1999 : 169). The “bathing” here is clearly immersion in the perfumedsmoke of burning incense.The humanlike figures in the incense clouds are ancestors, a depic-tion that goes back to Preclassic Olmec, Izapan, and Pacific coast art.Late La Venta Stela 3, with six human figures floating above the centralpersonage, is a particularly close comparison to the Terminal Classicscenes in the Tikal area. More specifically, these figures are identical tothe aged Paddler Gods identified on a carved bone from Tikal Burial 11605-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 153"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"154maya political sciencefigure5.17 A carved bone from Tikal Burial 116, showing the Paddler Gods in acanoe (courtesy of University of Pennsylvania Museum, Philadelphia, neg. # Tikal63-5-87).(Fig. 5.17): deceased ancestors paddling the canoe that carries kings andgods to the Underworld. According to Quiriguá Stela C, the Paddlersoversaw creation and “planted” three hearthstones in the sky; these arethe three stars in the belt in the Orion constellation (Montgomery2001a : 302).David Stuart (1988 : 189; see also Miller and Taube 1993 : 128) notesthat two of the four figures in the upper register of Ixlú Stela 2 (below,Fig. 5.23) appear to be human warriors and two are Roman-nosed deityfigures. Of the latter he writes, “[T]he left figure is marked by a large,round eye, a jaguar-head cap, and feline paws and tail. These identifyhim as the Jaguar God of the Underworld. The right figure also has around eye, but his distinctive traits include a fish-head (?) cap and a boneor stingray spine placed through his septum” (Stuart 1988 : 189). The twoPaddlers are often distinguished by ak’b’al (night) and k’in (sun, day)glyphs, respectively, distinctions that can be traced to the Late Preclas-sic period, with the identification of ak’b’al and k’in glyphs on the in-cised jade Pomona Flare (Freidel and Schele 1988a:558; see also Justeson,Norman, and Hammond 1988).Tikal Stela 11 and Altar 11 were found in a line of (primarily EarlyClassic) stelae and altars on the northern edge of the Main Plaza, in frontof the North Acropolis.

The ruler’s name on the monument isOlom Chik’in Chakte (Valdés and Fahsen 2004). Stela 12, which is notwedge-shaped, dates to (10.3.0.0.0) 1 Ajaw 3 Yaxk’in (May 2, 889) andshows the Tikal ruler with the “west kalomte’” title, and Uaxactún kingK’al Chik’in Chakte, celebrating the period ending by scattering. Thetext ends by recording the arrival of a third unidentified individual(ibid.).The site of Jimbal, 12.5 kilometers north of central Tikal, has been re-garded as a “tertiary center” in Classic lowland Maya site hierarchyschemes (e.g., Marcus 1976 : Table 13), as it lacks its own Emblem Glyphand has a small number of plazas. Six Terminal Classic stelae and fouraltars were reported from the site (Jones and Satterthwaite 1982 : 110 –12). Jimbal Stela 1 (Fig. 5.19) ,dated to (10.2.10.0.0) 2 Ajaw 13 Ch’en(June 24, 879), was found with Altar 1 on the east side of the main plaza.The stela text announces that the ruler, identified as an “ochk’inkalomte’,” scattered on the half period and played the ballgame, andrefers to the Paddlers as itzat,or artists and sages (Pugh 1999). It also incorporates three square glyph cartouches that give the sequential day names 12 Chikchan, 13 Kimi, and 1 Manik’ (12 Snake, 13 Death, and 1 Deer). These days, the significance of which is unclear, would have oc-curred either seven weeks earlier (April 30 –May 2, 879) or nearly sevenmonths after (January 15–17, 880) the dedication date in June. Stela 1has a decorated border and shows a ruler standing with his head in pro-file, holding a round shield and a God K or manikin scepter, with twoPaddler Gods in dotted S-shaped motifs above him.

The monument shows a profiled central figure scat-tering, wearing a jaguar-skin kilt and an ornate feathered headdress, andholding a God K or manikin scepter (Stuart 1988 : 184; Schele and Miller1986 : Fig. IV.2). He also appears to be carrying a backrack. Four sky figures in dotted cloud scrolls float above the central individual.

The altar’s face consists only of heavily erodedglyphs. Houston (pers. comm., 1994) reads the text as, “‘in the middle ofhis 10th tun’ ‘he seated/offered the stone’ (referring to the dedication ofthe altar) and ‘he scattered the drops’... ‘he of the 20 captives.’” This isthe same epithet used on Altar 1 at Zacpetén, and both monuments mayrefer to the same individual.

The individual in the lowerright is obviously a captive, with bowed head and arms tied behind hisback. According to Houston (pers. comm., 1994), this altar portrays the presentation of a captive to a principal lord in a palace; alternatively,the figure opposite the captive could be a woman offering a drink. Hous-ton suggests the altar dates sometime after 800, roughly 9.18.0.0.0 or9.19.0.0.0. Héctor Escobedo (pers. comm., 1994) estimates a later date of10.1.0.0.0 (849) on stylistic grounds and suggests that the figure in theupper right may have an Emblem Glyph, possibly Tikal’s.

Ad-ditional sites constructed E-Groups or variants (E), but dated period-ending monuments are thus far lacking: Ucanal, Nakum, Ixtinto, Chal-pate ,Holtún ,La Tractorada ,Cenote ,Paxcamán ,and Tayasal. In addition ,El Encanto, Corozal, and El Temblor had monuments mentioningTikal’s Early Classic rulers, but these stelae are thought to have beenmoved from Tikal to the small peripheral sites at some later time, per-haps during the period immediately after central Mexican contact. In ad-dition, Río Azul was very likely a Tikal satellite, although it lacks bothperiod-ending stelae and, apparently, the E-Group assemblage. Ucanalseems to have been part of this system, if only briefly, as its ruler in theearly fifth century was a yajaw of Tikal’s king.During Tikal’s Late Classic mayseating, some of the earlier k’atun05-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 166"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"tikal’s late and terminal classic seating of the may167seats continued and new ones were added, judging from the presence oftwin-pyramid groups (T) and erection of period-ending monuments (M):Uaxactún (M), Motul de San José (M), Ixlú (TM), Zacpetén (TM), Chal-pate (T), Uolantún (T), and Tayasal (M). The positions of Yaxhá (T),Nakum (M), and Ucanal (M) are difficult to assess, because these sitesseem to have been in a region contested by Calakmul, Caracol, andNaranjo. It is interesting, however, that the Late Classic ceramic com-plexes of Yaxhá and Calakmul are very closely tied to (i.e., full sphereparticipants in) the better-known ones of central Petén, that is, Tikaland Uaxactún (Rice and Forsyth 2004).In the Terminal Classic, Tikal’s mayseating would have involvedUaxactún, Jimbal, Ixlú, Zacpetén, El Perú, Motul de San José?, and per-haps also Yaxhá/Topoxté and Nakum. It is useful in this regard to recallMarcus’s (1976) model of political geography, which proposed nine cen-ters within the Tikal regional state: Naranjo, Aguateca, and Machaquiláas secondary sites; Jimbal, Ixlú, and Uaxactún as tertiary; and El En-canto, Xultún, and Nakum as quaternary. New evidence accumulatedsince she proposed this model requires that El Perú, Motul de San José?,and probably Yaxhá be added to the list and that Naranjo be eliminatedbecause of its affiliation with Calakmul. In addition, it is now knownthat several of these sites —Yaxhá, Topoxté, Xultún, and Motul de SanJosé?—have their own Late Classic Emblem Glyphs, often assumed tobe an indicator of some degree of political independence. In particular,since Xultún’s stelae do not share features of monuments in the Tikalrealm, it is more likely that it was a satellite of Calakmul.It is difficult to identify Tikal’s successor, the midcycle incomingmayseat to rule during the Early Postclassic period (948 –1204) in cen-tral Petén. On the basis of epigraphic, iconographic, architectural, ce-ramic, and settlement continuities from the Late Classic through theTerminal Classic and into the Postclassic periods, Ixlú and Zacpeténmight have been likely candidates. Another possibility is the newly dis-covered site of Nixtun-Ch’ich’, on the Candelaria peninsula on the west-ern end of Lake Petén Itzá. However, the east-west socioethnic divisionscharacteristic of Postclassic Yucatán also seem to be present in Termi-nal Classic central Petén (Rice and Rice 2004), and the western LakePetén Itzá basin is unlikely to be Tikal’s direct heir. As I discuss in suc-ceeding chapters, evidence from other sites in Petén suggests that thepolitical situation in the Terminal Classic period in Petén was decidedlycomplex and that both Seibal and Ucanal played significant roles.05-T2963 6/15/04 2:20 PM Page 167"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"chapter 6Other Classic Period May-based RealmsThere is persuasive evidence that, as Edmonson earlier conjectured, theClassic Maya observed maycycles and that the maywas seated at Tikal.Edmonson (1979 : 15) also suggested that, besides Tikal, other southernlowland seats of the maymight have included Copán, Palenque, Altar de Sacrificios, and Seibal. His suggestions can be compared to the re-gional “capitals” proposed in other centralized models of Classic Mayastatehood: Tikal, Copán, Palenque, and Toniná, in Morley’s (1946)model; Tikal, Copán, Calakmul, Palenque, and Seibal, in the Barthel-Marcus scheme; and Tikal, Copán, Calakmul, Palenque, and Yaxchilán,in Adams’s Late Classic vision.Here I discuss two sites, Copán and Calakmul, long associated withregional state models; I also offer a brief overview of Palenque, Caracol,and the Petexbatún region in the context of the may.These sketchessupport the hypothesis that the lowland Classic Maya shared a politico-religious structuring based on 256-year calendar cycles, but it is evidentthat the means of participation varied and each cycle seat and regionmaintained distinctive ritual identities.

More recently,the site has been characterized as governed by “multiple, effective po-litical interest groups in the polity” or “maximal lineages” (Webster1992 : 153; see also Viel 1999).Archaeological excavations at Copán have yielded evidence of occu-pation dating back to the Early and Middle Preclassic periods, circa1100 – 400 b.c., with ceramics similar to those of the Pacific piedmontand coast (Fash 1991 : 64 –70). However, Copán’s inscriptions on Stelae 4and 17 indicate that the “kingdom” of Copán was established on the pe-riod-ending 8.6.0.0.0 10 Ajaw 13 Ch’en (December 16, 159). The 159date is commemorated also on Copán Stela I, with reference to comple-tion of the sixth k’atun. A later k’atun-ending Copán inscription dated8.17.0.0.0 1 Ajaw 8 Ch’en (October 19, 376) is mentioned on a carvedpeccary skull recovered in a tomb. In this inscription, an otherwiseunknown “Foliated Ajaw” is one of two seated individuals facing a stela and altar; the text includes reference to “wrapping” a stela (Fash1991 : 87).Copán’s dynastic history (Martin and Grube 2000 : 190 –213) is knownprimarily from two sculptured monuments, Altar Q in the plaza of theAcropolis and a bench in Structure 11, to the north of that plaza (see Viel1999). The Copán and Quiriguá dynasties were, more explicitly thanthat of Tikal, “founded” in the mid-k’atun or lajuntun of 426, in aK’atun 8 Ajaw, ten years before the k’atun and b’ak’tun endings of9.0.0.0.0 (December 9, 435) were commemorated. This dynastic found-ing is also likely to represent the seating of a maycycle at Copán. Morespecifically, Copán’s dynasty was founded on 8.19.10.11.0 8 Ajaw 18Yank’in (September 7, 426) by K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’ (Great-Sun FirstQuetzal Macaw).K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo”s origins are not certain, but there is increas-ing evidence that he was from central Petén and perhaps Tikal. A textdating to 8.18.10.8.12 (1 Eb’ 10 Yax; November 3, 406) on the back of astatue of a seated human, known as the Hombre de Tikal, mentions anindividual named K’inich Yax K’uk Mo’, and the same or an earlier in-dividual named K’inich Yax K’uk Mo’ might be represented opposite Foliated Ajaw on the carved peccary skull (Sharer 2003 : 325–327). In ad-dition, strontium-isotope analysis of human bone believed to be the re-mains of K’inich Yax K’uk Mo’, found in the Hunal Tomb, indicates thathe was not a Copán native but rather from central Petén (Sharer2003 : 340).Sharer (2003 : 322 –323, 350) proposes that Tikal orchestrated a mili-other classic period may-based realms16906-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 169"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"170maya political sciencetary conquest of Copán under the leadership of K’uk’ Mo’, an elite warrior, in 426 or 427. Simultaneously, Tikal seems to have aided in the founding of the ruling dynasty of Quiriguá under the authority ofCopán, presumably in the person of Yax K’uk Mo’. Yax K’uk’ Mo, inother words, overthrew the established ruling dynasty of Copán andmarried a woman from that lineage in a sequence of events very likethose transpiring at Tikal half a century earlier. K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo isthus a “stranger-king,” like Tikal’s Siyaj K’ak’ (Rice n.d.b), who is re-ferred to on the Xukpi Stone buried under Copán Structure 26.Early stelae at Copán and Quiriguá share distinctive iconographictraits with Tikal’s early monuments, including frontal portraiture withupturned, back-to-back hands with curled fingers in front of the chest,plus a distinctive semi-in-the-round or “wraparound” style. At the sametime, Yax K’uk’ Mo”s personal artifacts (Stuart 1997) and the general architecture at the time show strong Mexican influences and one earlybuilding, Structure 16, had central Mexican talud-tablero architec-ture and brightly painted murals. The Classic foundations of Copán,Quiriguá, and other sites (such as Palenque) may be linked to complexTikal– central Mexican dynastic interactions throughout the region.Yax K’uk’ Mo’ (426 – 437?) was succeeded by his son, K’inich PopolHol (Mat Head), who erected two monuments: Stela 18, which uses therare “ladder” or “scaffold” glyph Eb’ of the Tikal’s founder’s name, andStela 63. Stela 63, the earliest dated carved monument at Copán, cele-brates the 9.0.0.0.0 k’atun/b’ak’tun ending in 435, as does, retrospec-tively, Waterlily Jaguar’s all-glyphic Stela 15 (dedication date, 524), afterwhich little is known of succeeding rulers.The next period endings that were celebrated at Copán were on Stela17 at 554 (9.6.0.0.0) and on Stela 9 at 9.6.10.0.0 (564), a lajuntun endingon a day 8 Ajaw, with the first known display of Copán’s Emblem Glyph.The 119-year hiatus in erecting k’atun-ending monuments, from 435 to554, is roughly one-half k’atun less than the 128-year half-maycycle.This suggests a situation like that described for Tikal in Chapters 4 and5, in which different kinds and levels of ritual activity were carried outin one half of a mayversus the other. Yax K’uk’ Mo’s dynasty lasted396 years, until 9.19.11.14.5 3 Chikchan 3 Wo (February 8, 822).Copán’s Great Plaza, which lies at the northern extreme of the site center, is a dramatic architectural celebration of dynastic power(Fig. 6.1). The stelae in this plaza were erected by the city’s Late Classickings, Smoke Imix (K’ak’ Nab’ K’awil?) and Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil.Smoke Imix ruled from 628 to 695 and was buried in Temple 26.

Interpretations, below, of the iconography on these monu-ments are taken from Schele and Mathews (1998 : 141–161).Stela C ,near the center of the plaza ,shows the ruler on recto andverso ,looking both east and west ,and commemorates the period ending9.14.0.0.0 (December 5 ,711). Ropes mark the edges of both faces ,andsmall spirit companions — nawals orwayfigures — are visible in the up-per corners. Stela F ,the northernmost of the east-side monuments ,com-memorates the lajuntun of 9.14.10.0.0. Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil isshown in the role of the Bearded Jaguar God ,wearing a long featheredback ornament with ropes around his knees; a series ofwayfigures clam-ber on ropes edging the face of the monument. The back of the stela hasfour blocks of four glyphs ,each wrapped by a twisted cord or rope. Stela4 ,in the center of the plaza west of Stela C ,commemorates the jolajun-tun of 9.14.15.0.0. The ruler is dressed as Bolon K’awil ,one of Copán’spatrons ,and wears an enormous backrack; the text references reenact-ment of an event (the founding of the first dynasty?) in 8.6.0.0.0 (159). Itis accompanied by a carved stone ball tied with rope and a rectangularaltar wrapped like a gift box ,with fourwayfigures guarding the knots.During the final year before the end of this k’atun, Waxaklajun em-barked on an ambitious program involving structural modification anderection of three more monuments in this plaza. The construction proj-ect was the remodeling of Structure 10L-4 (Str. 4), which separates theGreat Plaza to the north from the Middle Plaza to the south and alsofaces into the Great Plaza, closing it off on its southern end. An earlierversion of Str. 4, believed to have been commissioned by the dynasticfounder, Yax K’uk’ Mo’, or his son, incorporated Stela 35 in its fill. Styledated to circa a.d.400, this monument may show Yax K’uk’ Mo’ carry-ing a serpent-bodied ceremonial bar (Fash 1991 : 88). In his later remod-eling of this platform, Waxaklajun added east and west stairways, turn-ing it into a radial structure (Baudez 1991 : 85).Copán’s famous Stela A was erected on the north side of this radialplatform, facing east across the plaza toward Stela H, which in turnstood south of earlier Stela F. Together, Stelae A and H celebrate the pe-riod ending of 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ajaw 13 Yax (August 20, 731). Both monu-ments were erected over cruciform cache chambers, with the one underStela H containing the earliest artifacts of gold in the Maya area (Schele06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 172"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"other classic period may-based realms173and Mathews 1998 : 158). On Stela H, dedicated 9.14.19.5.0 4 Ajaw 18Muwan (December 3, 730), or 260 days before the k’atun ending, Wax-aklajun is attired as the Maize God, wearing a netted skirt of jade, aMaize God headdress, and a large Maize God backrack. As on his otherstelae, twisted cords provide an edging, with a wayor miniature MaizeGods (one holding a perforator) clinging to the rope.Stela A may show Waxaklajun in the costume of Kan Te Ajaw, an-other of Copán’s patrons, wearing an ornate matlike headdress (Scheleand Mathews 1998 : 159). The lengthy text of Stela A (Fig. 6.2), dedicatedonly sixty days after Stela H on 9.14.19.8.0 12 Ajaw 18 Kumk’u (Febru-ary 1, 731), continues that of its partner. This text, appearing on three ofthe four sides of the monument, has defied clear decipherment as it ap-pears to describe some esoteric ritual and cosmological activity that haslittle parallel in monuments elsewhere. The best known part of the in-scription is found near the end, on the south panel, where the EmblemGlyph of Copán appears with those of Tikal, Palenque, and Calakmul.This occurrence, accompanied by reference to “four skies” and the fourcardinal directions (or the four positions of the sun’s journey), con-tributed to inferences of a quadripartite cosmological and geopolit-ical model of Classic Maya political organization, with four regional-directional capitals (Barthel 1968; Marcus 1973, 1976). What the text ac-tually seems to record, however, is that the lords of these sites gatheredtogether as part of the ceremony involving deposition of objects in thecaches (D. Stuart, pers. comm., June 23, 2002; Schele and Mathews1998 : 160 –161; see also Coggins 1992).The reference to “four skies” is of interest because these collocationscan be read syllabically: kan te kan (na), kan [Zip?] na kan (na), kan nikan na, kan may kan na.The variable second element in each of thesecompounds might be a numerical classifier; in the second of the four,this classifier is a bird head variant with a possible “Zip Monster”prefix, while the fourth is distinguished by a mayglyph or deer hoof. Itis possible that these four glyphs could be matched with the four indi-vidual sites, just as the directional glyphs were interpreted to indicatesymbolic regions of political control. It is equally likely, however, thatthey are general descriptors and metaphors for “the whole world”: earthand sky; sunrise, zenith, sunset, Underworld; the four quarters; and thefour sacred seats of the maythat provide the geopolitico-ritual structurethat links the earthly domain with the cosmos.The final monument in Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil’s sequence wasStela B, which commemorated the 9.15.0.0.0 period ending in 731.

The “spiritcompanions” or way-nawal figures clinging to the ropes — and to the Vi-sion Serpents on the later jotun marker, Stela D (9.15.5.0.0)— are analo-gous to the ancestral Paddler figures riding cloud scrolls on Tikal’s latemonuments, as well as the figures on the Preclassic Hauberg Stela. Inaddition, the Copán program of erecting five monuments in the vicinityof a radial structure is similar to that at Terminal Classic Seibal (seeChap. 7). Scattering is not shown on Waxaklajun’s stelae: Stela B cele-brates the k’atun ending 9.15.0.0.0 4 Ajaw 13 Yax (August 20, 731), withthe ruler in his usual stance, but the text includes the phrase “he scat-tered drops” (Schele and Mathews 1998 : 164).Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil also created the final version of Ballcourt A,which was finished in early January 738. This large and elegant ballcourt,first constructed during the fourth century ,sits on the north side of theHieroglyphic Court ,open to the south ,with the adjacent west-facingTemple 26 and its hieroglyphic stairway to the southeast. Shortly afterfinishing the ballcourt ,in what appears to have been a major reversal ofCopán’s fortunes ,Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil was captured on May 1 ,738(9.15.6.14.6 6 Kimi 4 Sek) by the ruler of Quiriguá ,K’ak’ Tiliw Kan Yoat(formerly Kawak Sky). Waxaklajun’s fate was reported as beheading ,ac-cording to Quiriguá’s texts ,but Copán claims merely that he died in“battle.” Stuart (1995 : 300) provides a variant interpretation of theQuiriguá text ,reading the ax verb asch’akba,a reflexive form — that is,self-decapitation — as known from mythological scenes on Classic vases.Not long after Copán’s “defeat,” its ruler, K’ak’ Yoplaj Kan K’awil(Smoke Monkey) built Structure 10L-22A. This structure was identifiedas a popol naj (Mat House; a community or council house; see Fash 1992;Fash et al. 1992; Fash 1991 : 130 –134; Schele and Mathews 1998 : 492 –493n73) on the basis of the mat motifs on its façade. It is thought to havebeen dedicated on a day 9 Ajaw on the basis of large 9 Ajaw medallions“repeated in pairs numerous times on all four facades of the structure”(Fash, Andrews, and Manahan 2004), suggesting its dedication on a jola-juntun ending 9.15.15.0.0 9 Ajaw 18 Xul (June 2, 746). K’ak’ Yoplaj wassuccessor to the unfortunate Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil, and his smallnew structure abutted Waxaklajun’s much more imposing Structure 22to the west. The front and back facades of Structure 10L-22A were dec-orated with six mat symbols alternating with eight carved human fig-ures, each wearing individualized headdresses and neck ornaments andseated cross-legged over large glyphs believed to be toponyms (Fig. 6.3).The nine toponymic glyphs on the structure appear to name sites in and06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 175"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"176maya political sciencearound the Copán area, perhaps including Río Amarillo, El Paraíso, ElPuente, and Los Higos (Fash 1991 : 134). Above the mats were glyphsreading ajawlil‘ajawship; governance’. Roof ornaments labeled thebuilding as a nik te’il na‘flower house’, a Colonial period gloss for coun-cil house (Fash, Andrews, and Manahan 2004).Using an analogy with Ralph Roys’s study of sixteenth-century Yu-catán, Barbara W. and William L. Fash and others (Fash et al. 1992; seealso Cheek 2003) suggest that Structure 10L-22A may have been an ad-ministrative structure for meetings of the Copán ruler and jolpops(council members, or those at the head of the mat).

Second, if one of the fundamental characteristics of statehood is the separa-tion of political institutions from kinship lines, then from a.d.746,if not before, Copán was at that stage of development. The states-men are identified not by their personal names, but rather by thename of the subdivision of the kingdom which they represent. (Fash1991 : 135)I believe the implications of Structure 10L-22A extend further. First,as Fash notes, one definition of jolpop is “head of the banquet.” Thissuggests to me that the feasts (Act 14) were part of k’atun-ending cele-brations in the Postclassic and Colonial periods (see Chap. 3). In addi-tion, I suspect the nine toponyms or subdivisions of the kingdom referto nine tzuk, or k’atun-seating provinces and allies, within the Copánpolity. Finally, Baudez (1991) has suggested that ritual processions (i.e.,Act 8: Ceremonial Circuit, or Act 11: Pacing of the K’atun) also mighthave been part of k’atun-ending ceremonies at Copán. He (1991 : 85) be-lieves radial platform Structure 10L-4 sat in the center “of a huge crossthat divides the Main Group into four quadrants” and the east-westarms of the cross are now-destroyed causeways that extended fromStructure 10M-1 on the east to Structure 10K-29 or 10K-16 to the west.South of Copán’s Great Plaza is the Middle Plaza, with the smallCourt of the Hieroglyphic Stairway immediately to the south. The hi-eroglyphic stairway ascends the west side of Temple 26 (Str. 10L-26) andfaces west into the courtyard. Its 2,200 glyphs incorporate those of theearlier stairs set by Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil in his remodeling of thetemple over Smoke Imix’s tomb in a.d.710. This earlier hieroglyphicstairway, which recorded the city’s dynastic sequence up to WaxaklajunUb’aj K’awil’s rule, was demolished and the carved blocks reset into anew stairway with an extended text. The rebuilding of Temple 26 anddedication of the hieroglyphic text in 755 were part of a revitalization ofCopán carried out by K’ak’ Yipyaj Kan K’awil, who ruled from 749 to761(?). It has been suggested that Temple 26 was dedicated to the site’sdual Maya and Mexican heritage, with sculptures of Copán kingsdressed in Teotihuacan warrior style standing on the stairway, and aquasi-“bilingual” text in Maya and “Mexicanized” or non-Maya glyphsinside the temple (Stuart 2000 : 496 – 497).The hieroglyphic stairway was excavated and closely studied by epi-graphers to test two hypotheses, that it was either (1) a conquest monu-ment imposed by Quiriguá to celebrate the capture and beheading ofWaxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil or (2) a Copán-inspired monument created to rebuild the prestige and legitimacy of Copán’s ruling dynasty (Fash1991 : 143).

Yax Pasaj is knownfor many constructions, including the final version of Temple 16 and,at its base, Altar Q, a square altar with portraits of Copán’s first six-teen kings. Yax Pasaj’s depictions of himself are unusual in that he isshown witha group of named “companions” that partner him on many monu-ments. These characters behave very much like kings themselves,they have “seating” events, perform the “scattering” rite and beareither full or modified emblem glyphs. Initially it was thought thatthese were siblings of the king and a sign that he was obliged toshare power with an extended family, though more recent evidencesuggests that they were companions of a more supernatural kind.(Martin and Grube 2000 : 210)These could be way-nawal figures like those accompanying WaxaklajunUb’aj K’awil, or ancestor figures analogous to the Paddlers of the Tikalrealm. Alternatively, given that Copán and Quiriguá commonly person-ify or anthropomorphize day and number glyphs, one wonders if thesecould be personified k’atuns or k’atun seats, or rulers of k’atun seats.The last period-ending stela at Copán was Stela 11, dated to the la-juntun 9.19.10.0.0 (May 4, 820), which “explicitly proclaimed the ‘top-pling of the founder’s House’ or lineage of Yax K’uk’ Mo’” (Montgomery2001b : 210). Copán’s end was violent, as indicated by the burning ofstructures and collapse of vaults in Courtyards A and B (Fash, Andrews,and Manahan 2004). It is not known who was responsible. The finalCopán ruler, Ukit Tok’, was inaugurated in February 822. On his onlymonument, Altar L, he tried to mimic his predecessor Yax Pasaj’s mon-ument, Altar Q, but it was never completed.The Copán dynasty begun by K’inich Yax K’uk’ Mo’ lasted from 426to 822, or 396 years. This exceeds the duration of 1.5 maycycles, or thethree phases “guest,” full seat, and retiring seat (i.e., 128 + 256 years \u0004384 years), by 12 years. This total of 396 years is, however, close to theduration of a bak’tun, 394.5 years, raising the possibility that one and ahalf maycycles might have been designed to correspond to b’ak’tuns.

Although not commemorated by carved stelae, the earlierk’atun ending of 8.6.0.0.0 (159) and the rule of Foliated Ajaw are men-tioned several times in the site’s texts and might also play a part in thesecycles.The site of Quiriguá plays an intriguing role vis-à-vis Copán. Lying70 kilometers north-northwest of Copán on the left bank of the MotaguaRiver in Guatemala, Quiriguá has long been considered a colony of thatsite (Morley 1935), and recent work confirms Copán’s role in its dynas-tic founding (Sharer 2003). Quiriguá’s Emblem Glyph (T559/560) is readk’ank’in(fourteenth month in the solar calendar), as a “cacao tree withpod” (Sharer 1994 : Fig. 13.6), and as tzuk (partition) (Schele and Math-ews 1998 : 346n6). Quiriguá’s dynasty (Martin and Grube 2000 : 214 –225)was founded very shortly after Copán’s, and its first ruler, nicknamedTok’ Casper, took office u kab’iy —under the supervision of —Yax K’uk’Mo’. The two sites show great similarities in layout, architecture, andmonumental sculpture. Fash (1991 : 150) suggests that Quiriguá’s imita-tion of the Copán layout was “a deliberate ploy by Quiriguá’s ruler . . .to outdo his former masters from Copán.” I suggest that in the very LateClassic Quiriguá itself might have become a mayseat.Quiriguá celebrated early period endings, including that at 9.1.0.0.0(455) and perhaps also the jotun of 9.2.5.0.0 (480). This date occurs alongwith mention of a later ritual that took place “‘under the supervision’ ofan ochk’in kalomte’” (Martin and Grube 2000 : 217) or “kalomte’ of thewest.” This title has often been interpreted as having some reference toTeotihuacan, located in central Mexico to the west of the Maya low-lands. However, because the kalomte’ title is particularly associatedwith Tikal and Copán’s Late Classic Stela A’s mention of Tikal seems toassociate that site with the west, this may mean that the Tikal rulerK’an Kitam had some hand in the event.Quiriguá experienced a similar Middle Classic hiatus in monumenterection as that at Tikal and other lowland sites, with no dated stelae oraltars for some one hundred eighty years between 493 and 672. It is possible that the site might have experienced disastrous floods duringthis interval and been abandoned for a time (Sharer 1990). In any case,Altar L (Monument 12), featuring a variant Giant Ajaw layout, was ded-icated in about 9.12.0.0.0 (672), celebrating the completion of K’atun 10Ajaw. It is of interest that one k’atun later, Tikal ended its own hiatusin the same manner, with a Giant Ajaw on Altar 14.During the last decade or so of the Copán ruler Waxaklajun’s reign,Quiriguá seems to have grown increasingly assertive.

Some years later, in 734(9.15.3.2.0.), Quiriguá displayed its Emblem Glyph, and in 736, K’ak’Tiliw claimed to have erected a stela (not known) in a ceremony that hasa reference to Chik Nab’, perhaps a district within the Calakmul polity.Two years later, in 738, Quiriguá defeated Copán, although none of theQuiriguá accounts of this event refer to it using a term for war (Martinand Grube 2000 : 205). Viel (1999 : 393) interprets the rivalry between thetwo cities as one between the two major lineage groups in the region asidentified by insignia on their pectorals on Copán’s carved monuments.After that event, as Copán’s fortunes declined, Quiriguá enjoyed a period of expansive construction and power. K’ak’ Tiliw rebuilt and enlarged the site’s acropolis, plaza, and ballcourt, and at the jolajun-tun of 9.15.15.0.0 (746) he began the practice of erecting a monumentevery five years. Quiriguá’s Late Classic carved monuments (Sharer1990) were either very tall obelisk-like stelae with deep relief —K’ak’Tiliw’s Stela E (Monument 5), erected in 771, is a stone column morethan 7 meters aboveground — or, as at Copán, zoomorphic altars — largeboulders carved to resemble turtles or jaguars. Quiriguá’s last dated text,on a building facade rather than a stela, refers to the rulers of both Copán and Quiriguá scattering in commemoration of the k’atun ending of9.19.0.0.0 (810) (Martin and Grube 2000 : 225).The pattern of stelae dates at Quiriguá supports the model of 128- or256-year intervals indicating the site’s participation in a may kusystem.The interval from the founding of the site in 426/427 to the last datedtext in 810 is 384 years (\u0004256 + 128), suggesting that Quiriguá mighthave experienced the three roles of guest seat, full seat, and retiring seatin much the same way that Copán did. Also of interest is the interval be-tween the Giant Ajaw Altar L, carved at the end of Quiriguá’s hiatus inabout 672, and the last dated text (810). This interval spans 138 years,ten years longer than a half may.However, it seems clear that through-out the Classic period Copán was the leading site in the southeast regionand Quiriguá was largely subsidiary. The very late display of an EmblemGlyph, plus Quiriguá’s raid on Copán and the subsequent capture anddeath of Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil, accompanied by decline at that site,probably signaled the shift in power as Copán moved into the role of re-tiring mayseat and Quiriguá was ascendant as “guest.”One controversial topic in interpreting the southeast region’s historyconcerns the length of occupation of the Copán valley after the collapseof dynastic rule. After 737 Copán was effectively no longer the seat ofthe mayin this region (despite the continuation of its dynasty until 820or 822), having been usurped by Quiriguá.

However, debris around TerminalClassic Ballcourt B, south of the site center, included at least six EarlyPostclassic Tohil Plumbate jars (Fox 1996 : 492). Moreover, suites of ra-diocarbon dates from occupation just south of this ballcourt (Manahan2002), plus obsidian hydration dates from sites in the rural valley (Freter1992; Webster, Freter, and Storey 2004), provide strong evidence of oc-cupation in the area for another one hundred fifty to perhaps as much asfour hundred years, until around 1200 –1250 (cf. Fash, Andrews, andManahan 2004). In other words, while the attempt by Copán’s last ruler,Ukit Tok’, to establish himself (and also a new mayseat?) at Copán in 822 apparently failed, the effort might have rallied the remainingelites sufficiently to account for the continued occupation of the Copánpocket and other rural settlements. This could represent another 1.5maycycles of continuing settlement in the Copán valley.Several sites in and around the Copán valley could have served ask’atun seats in the Copán or Quiriguá realm. These are Santa Rita,12 kilometers up the Copán River from Copán, with its Stela 23 cele-brating the 9.11.0.0.0 (652) k’atun ending, and Los Higos, 70 kilometersnortheast of Copán. That satellite’s Late Classic Stela 1 (781?) mentionsButz’ Chan with one of his titles and an “aj-po” (ajaw) superfix but lacksthe “water group” prefix of an Emblem Glyph (Fash 1991 : 97).A number of sites in southern Belize appear to have been k’atun seatsin the southeastern Copán-Quiriguá domain in the Late Classic. One ofthese is Uxbenká, with twenty-two stelae, eighteen of them arranged ina stela plaza (Leventhal 1990 : 134 –137; 1992 : 145–150). Unfortunately,only four can be dated: two are style dated to approximately 8.18.0.0.0(396), and two celebrate the lajuntun of 9.17.10.0.0 (780). Another k’atunseat is Pusilhá, farther to the south, with more than three dozen carvedmonuments (Wanyerka 2002). Rulers at the site celebrated the k’atunending of 9.7.0.0.0 (573) and the jolajuntun ending of 9.10.15.0.0 (647);Stela D (dated 9.8.0.0.0) gives a retrospective date of 9.3.0.0.0 (493)(Braswell 2002). Nim Li Punit in southern Belize is still another possiblek’atun seat in the Copán realm, as texts on the site’s many monumentsmention the Xukpi (Copán) ajaw five times (Wanyerka 2002).Wanyerka (2002) suggests, on the basis of epigraphy and iconography,that these southern Belize sites demonstrate a pattern of shifting al-liances. In the Early Classic these sites seem to have relations with cen-tral Petén, and Uxbenká Stela 11 mentions Tikal ruler Chak Tok Ich’ak(Wanyerka 1996a).

At Pusilhá, Stela K gives a retrospectivereference commemorating the 8.6.0.0.0 period ending (corresponding toCopán’s founding date of 159) and the mysterious Foliated Ajaw (Wan-yerka 2002), and Stela 1 mentions Smoke Imix as “Holy Tzuk Lord” inan u kab’iy expression (Schele and Mathews 1998 : 346n6).

The Nim LiPunit ruler attended an event in Copán in 771 (Braswell 2002).It is difficult to fit Lubaantun into this scheme, as it was founded late(in the early eighth century) and has no carved, dated stelae (Hammond1975). The latest dated monument in the Copán-Quiriguá mayregion ison Stela 1 from Tzimin Che in southern Belize, which celebrated the10.4.0.0.0 k’atun ending on January 15, 909 (Wanyerka, pers. comm.,June 25, 2002).Calakmul, Campeche, MexicoCalakmul, 100 kilometers north of Tikal in southeastern Campeche, isconsidered to have been Tikal’s principal rival during the Classic period(Martin and Grube 1995 : 101–115). The site was little known when Ed-monson suggested the existence of Classic period maycycling, and thushe did not include it in his scheme. Subsequent archaeological work atCalakmul since the 1980s indicates that the city is unusually largewhether measured in terms of its numerous urban and extraurban cause-ways, site area (70 km2), population (approximately 50,000), or numberof monuments (119) (Folan et al. 1995, 2001); the size of the Calakmulstate is estimated at more than 13,000 km2(Folan, Gunn, and Domín-guez Carrasco 2001 : 227; Braswell et al. 2004). Calakmul has the char-acteristics of “overkingship,” or political primacy over a number of siteswithin a large realm, and it is one of the postulated capitals of regionalstates in several models of lowland political organization (Marcus 1976;Adams 1986). With its political and military apogee between a.d.652and 752 (Braswell et al. 2004), Calakmul clearly would have been a LateClassic may ku.Calakmul’s Emblem Glyph (T764; Chikchan snake) suggests that thesite was originally named Kan ‘snake’ or Kanal, although it was alsoknown as Ox Te’ Tun ‘three stones’, and the larger realm it oversaw wasnamed Chik Nab’ or Nab Tunich ‘waterlily place’ (Marcus 2001 : 40).The latter could refer to the water lilies growing in Calakmul’s thirteenlarge reservoirs, which had a capacity totaling some 200 million liters06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 182"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"other classic period may-based realms183(Braswell et al. 2004). Calakmul came to prominence during the LatePreclassic period (350 b.c.–a.d.250; Folan et al. 1995 : 316; Pinceminet al. 1998 : 312), and its Classic rise, like Tikal’s, coincided with the de-cline of Late Preclassic El Mirador.As with many large Late Classic sites ,comparatively little of Calak-mul’s early occupation is known as it was buried under heavy later con-struction. In addition ,few Early Classic stelae have been found ,and thusit is difficult to know when the site first displayed its Emblem Glyph ,forexample. Unlike most Classic cities ,Calakmul’s early dynastic historyis primarily detailed on Late Classic texts painted on pottery vases ratherthan on sculptured monuments (Martin and Grube 2000 : 102). Most ofthese vessels painted in the so-called codex style were produced by lateroccupation at the primarily Middle Preclassic site of Nakbe (Hansen1992) ,lying to the south near El Mirador. The founder of Calakmul’s dy-nasty is nicknamed “Skyraiser,” but the date of his founding is unclear.Despite the paucity of information on Calakmul’s early occupationand dynasties, available evidence suggests the city participated in thesame general kinds of mayritual known from Preclassic and ClassicTikal and elsewhere. While Calakmul’s earliest known monument datesto a.d.431 (see below), nearby Balakbal has an earlier stela dated8.18.9.17.18 (406), two days before the lajuntun, and the Calakmul Em-blem Glyph appears on a hieroglyphic stairway at Dzibanché dating to495 (Braswell et al. 2004).A large E-Group complex sits at the very center of Calakmul, with atriadic structure at the north end of this plaza. Stelae 8 and 9 were set infront of the east building of the complex (Folan et al. 1995 : 314 –315), aswere monuments at Tikal and Uaxactún, but at Calakmul these stelaedate to the Late Classic rather than to the period of the structural as-semblage itself. This suggests that this complex (Fig. 6.4) may have con-tinued in use into the Late Classic period, as complexes were in south-eastern Petén and the Río Mopán area. The entire complex seems tohave considerable late modifications, as an unusually large square plat-form, rather than a radial structure, sits on the central axis of the westside. Some forty Late Classic stelae have been found in this plaza, eigh-teen of them in front (west) of the eastern structure (Folan et al. 2001).Calakmul’s largest temple is Late Preclassic Structure IIA, com-parable in size to El Mirador’s El Tigre pyramid, which overlooks thesouthern end of the site’s E-Group plaza. In the Early Classic period,Structure II was enlarged and six masks were placed on the north (front)facade, flanking its central staircase. This structure continued to be usedand modified into the Late and Terminal Classic period, with thirteenstelae erected on and around it.The evidence for Calakmul’s participation in a may-type organiza-06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 183"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"184maya political sciencetion in the Late Preclassic and Early Classic is equivocal, owing to thelack of early stelae and reference to allied sites.

The Early Classicking Tun K’ab’ Hix (?) was buried in Structure IV, the central building onthe east side of the complex (Braswell et al. 2004). If, instead, Calakmulitself seated the mayduring the Early Classic, it is likely k’atun seats in-clude Balakbal, with its eighth-cycle Stela 5. In addition, Calakmul’smany causeways link it to satellite centers (Folan et al. 1995 : 313) thatflourished earlier in the Preclassic, including El Mirador 38 kilometersto the southwest, El Tintal another 30 kilometers beyond, and Nakbe.It is easier to propose a Middle Classic seating for Calakmul. Thesite’s earliest known monument, Stela 114, is relatively late, having anIS date of 8.19.15.12.13 8 Ben 6 Mol (September 16, 431) (Pincemin et al.1998).

Tikal’s ally El Perú was ap-parently involved with Calakmul at this time, because a monument at El Perú records a woman named Lady Star (Na Ek’) celebrating anevent in a.d.520; she was the wife of the Calakmul ruler (Montgomery2001b : 107).A later Calakmul king nicknamed “First Axewielder” celebrated thek’atun ending of 9.7.0.0.0 (573) at Dzibanché.

Following the dedication of Stela 43 at Calakmul in 514,there ensued a 109-year gap in monument erection (one k’atun less thanhalf a may). This hiatus, from 514 to 623, partially overlaps Tikal’s half-mayhiatus in monument erection, which dates from 562 to 692; Tikal’shiatus, of course, has been thought to be at least partly caused by Calak-mul’s machinations.During its hiatus ,Calakmul or its rulers are mentioned at a numberof sites ,some of them separated by substantial distances. This pattern isnot unlike that of Tikal during its hiatus. Calakmul seems to have beenboth creating alliances and competing with sites in the Usumacinta re-gion as well as to the southeast (Marcus 1987 ,1995). In the former re-gion ,for example ,a Calakmul lord was captured by Yaxchilán in 537 ,while to the southeast ,in 546 Calakmul’s ruler Tun K’ab’ Hix facilitatedthe installation of Naranjo’s ruler Aj Wosal. An alliance between Calak-mul and Caracol resulted in Tikal’s “defeat” in 562. It is known fromlater stelae that the Calakmul ruler Scroll Serpent (579 – 611) celebratedthe 9.8.0.0.0 k’atun ending of 593 ,but if a monument was erected thenit no longer survives. Later ,Calakmul returned to action in the Usuma-cinta region ,“attacking” Palenque in 599 and again in 611.In 619 the Calakmul ruler Yuknom Chan supervised the Caracolruler K’an II in some activity, and four years later Calakmul ended itshiatus in monument erection.

The interval of intense period-endingmonument display ended around 751, 128 years after it had begun.It would seem, therefore, that in 623, on a lajuntun 2 Ajaw, Calakmulended its hiatus and emerged as a Late Classic maycenter, demon-strated by its commitment to commemorating period endings withcarved monuments. There does not seem to have been any distinctivearchitectural program associated with this seating, comparable to thetwin-pyramid groups or radial temples constructed for k’atun endings atTikal, or a consistent ritual or motif such as scattering. Instead, the keyelement at Calakmul seems to be the erection of multiple monuments,often in pairs and often showing both king and queen.At the beginning of its mayseating, Calakmul was still involved withNaranjo, which, under Aj Wosal’s successor, had apparently disengageditself from Calakmul sponsorship. In a star-war event on December 24,631, five years after Caracol’s defeat of Naranjo, Calakmul delivered thefinal blow: it “seized” Naranjo, whose king was “k’uxaj’‘tortured’ or‘eaten’, perhaps a special punishment for his secession. We are told thatthis took place at Calakmul . . . on the very day of the battle and seem-ingly he was already a captive in their hands” (Martin and Grube2000 : 106). This story is related on the Naranjo hieroglyphic stairway,built in 642. Fifty years later, in 680, Naranjo defeated Caracol, afterwhich the Naranjo dynasty abruptly ceased.Calakmul’s alliances with Dos Pilas, Naranjo, and Yaxhá suggest thatthese sites were incorporated into Calakmul’s orbit at various times inthe late seventh and early eighth century, but they seemed to functionat a different level of interaction than as k’atun seats. El Perú seems tobe another ally, as suggested by mention of Na Kan Ajaw (Divine Womanof the Snake Polity) on that site’s Stela 34 dating a.d.692 (Wanyerka1996b). The inscription on this monument includes the title South Di-vine Jaguar, which might refer to her husband or, more likely, her fatherat Calakmul, since Calakmul is identified with the south direction onCopán Stela A. Other likely k’atun seats in Calakmul’s Late Classic period mayrealm (see Fig. 2.2a) are Oxpemul, La Muñeca, Altamira,Naachtún, Uxul, and Sasilhá (Marcus 1976 : Fig. 1.15, 1983; Folan et al.1995 : 330), which were equidistantly spaced in a hexagonal latticearound Calakmul, as well as Los Alacranes (B’uuk’), La Corona, andother sites that enjoyed continuing relationships from the Early Classic.Braswell et al. (2004) mention some twenty secondary-level sites in theCalakmul region.

Around 771— in the latter halfof Calakmul’s mayseating — Calakmul’s influence in the area seemed towane as a new architectural style, known as Río Bec-Chenes, developed.This style, characterized by elaborate “false pyramid” facades, flour-ished at Río Bec itself, Hormiguero, Chicanna, Xpujil, and Becan. Someelements were also present at Calakmul (Braswell et al. 2004). It hasbeen suggested (Jones 1969 : 7, 128) that the twin towers of this new ar-chitectural style might be related to the twin-pyramid groups at Tikal.It might also be proposed that the elaborate mosaic “zoomorphic por-tals” at numerous sites in this area (Gendrop 1980) represent the re-gional architectural signature of a mayseating similar to those of the E-Group assemblages, twin pyramids, and later ballcourts (at Chich’enItza; see Chap. 7).Throughout the Late Classic period, the most prominent political re-lationships in the lowlands seem to have been those between Calakmuland Tikal, but these are difficult to comprehend. Recent interpretationshave been couched primarily in warfare terminology, with defeats, con-quests, and alliances as the operative interactions between these two superpowers. In particular, interpretive scenarios have hinged on the existence of factions in Late Classic Tikal, with Calakmul supportingthe Tikal-ruler-in-exile at Dos Pilas. In January 657, near the end ofTikal’s hiatus, Calakmul supposedly “attacked” Tikal in a “star war”and Tikal’s ruler “fled.” But subsequent events are murky and suggestthat relations were very complex. A scene on a painted vase dated 691shows a Calakmul lord delivering tribute to a Tikal lord (Martin andGrube 2000 : 110, citing Houston and Mathews 1985). Significantly, per-haps, this is the year before the postulated 692 reinauguration of Tikalas a Late Classic mayseat. Tikal thereupon defeated Calakmul on Au-gust 5, 695, and captured at least two important lords; the king, YuknomIch’ak K’ak’, may have died in battle and was buried in Structure II(Braswell et al. 2004). Forty years later, in 736, Tikal’s Altar 9 (seeFig. 5.8; erected along with Stela 21), celebrating the Tikal ruler Yik’inKan K’awil’s inauguration, suggests a defeat of Calakmul as it portraysa bound Calakmul lord. Yet five years later, in 741, Calakmul erectedfive stelae at the lajuntun ending of 9.15.10.0.0. Shortly thereafter, Tikaldefeated two of Calakmul’s allies, El Perú in 743 and Naranjo in 744.As discussed in Chapters 4 and 5, Tikal’s Classic period maycyclescan be divided into four sets of intervals of \u0002128 years: a.d.435 to 562,562 – 692, 692 – 820, 820 – 948. Can a similar series of intervals be identi-fied for Calakmul?

This, of course, is an interval of 128 yearsor half a may,from a lajuntun date of 9.9.10.0.0 2 Ajaw 13 Pop to the ending of a K’atun 2 Ajaw in 9.16.0.0.0. This interval of intense monument dedication was preceded by a 109-year “hiatus” from 514 to623, an interval nineteen years (approximately one k’atun) less than the128-year pattern evident at Tikal. Moving backward in time another128 years from 514 (the beginning of the Calakmul hiatus), we reach386, a lajuntun of 8.17.10.0.0, on a day 13 Ajaw 18 Xul. Nothing suggeststhis date is particularly significant at Calakmul; the only seemingly rel-evant date is ten years later, in 396, when a stela at the satellite of Bal-akbal commemorated the k’atun ending of 8.18.0.0.0. However, giventhe paucity of surviving early stelae at Calakmul, it is not unlikely thatone or more “missing monuments” originally existed or could eventu-ally be found at the site dating to 386.If, instead of moving back into the past from 623 (the start of intensemonument erection), we move ahead 128 years to 751 and then another128 years (total 256 years), we come to the lajuntun year of 879. Duringthis Late and Terminal Classic interval, Calakmul continued to erectstelae, including celebrations of period endings in 790, 800 (two monu-ments), and 810 (three). In addition, it was during the Terminal Classicthat earlier stelae, apparently curated for centuries, were set into thebase of Structure II. A recent discussion has suggested that the latter wasa triadic structure and proposed that Calakmul’s sociopolitical organi-zation was tripartite, a material manifestation of the site’s place-name,Ox Te’ Tun, or place of three stones (Folan, Gunn, and Domínguez Ca-rrasco 2001). The three components of that organization were sacred,secular, and military, and centered on Structure II since Late Preclassictimes (ibid. : 253). Regionally, Calakmul also continued to play a signifi-cant role, as indicated on Seibal Stela 10 by the mention of its ruler, KanPet, participating in a k’atun-ending event with other rulers of mayseatsat 10.1.0.0.0 (849).The small and stylistically late Calakmul Stela 61 mentions the lastnamed ruler, Aj Tok’, and scattering, a ritual suggesting a period-endingdate of 10.3.0.0.0 (899) or 10.4.0.0.0 (909) (Martin and Grube 2000 :115). My preference — following from the 128-year intervals describedabove —would be a lajuntun-ending date of 10.2.10.0.0 2 Ajaw 13 Ch’en,879, as it could have marked the end of Calakmul’s Late Classic seatingof the may,which began in 623. On stylistic grounds, at least four othermonuments may date to Cycle 10 or even later (Proskouriakoff 1950 :152). Several of Calakmul’s satellites also erected Cycle 10 monuments(Marcus 1987), including Oxpemul and Nadzcaan in 10.0.0.0.0 (830) andLa Muñeca and Xamantún in 10.3.0.0.0 (889).06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 190"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"other classic period may-based realms191Another Calakmul satellite might be Xultún, lying northeast of Uax-actún near the headwaters of the Río Azul. Xultún displayed its ownEmblem Glyph perhaps as early as 396 (Mathews 1985:Fig. 10) and wasprobably in Tikal’s Early Classic mayrealm. Circumstances seem tohave changed later, however, as Xultún’s monuments dated to TerminalClassic k’atun endings — Stela 9 at 9.19.0.0.0?; Stela 8 at 10.0.0.0.0; Stela 1 at 10.1.0.0.0; Stela 3 at the lajuntun of 10.1.10.0.0; and Stela 10at 10.3.0.0.0 — lack the characteristic features of late monuments in theTikal region. Xultún might have been incorporated into Calakmul’sLate –Terminal Classic mayrealm.The absence of Early Classic stelae at Calakmul is unusual. The site’slater residents might have moved, buried, or destroyed most monu-ments dating to that interval. The stelae positioned in front of Calak-mul’s E-Group seem to be Late Classic replacements. The site’s earliestknown monument thus far, dated 431, was guarded for several centuries,but it is unclear why this monument was saved when so much of therest of Calakmul’s Preclassic and Early Classic history was obliterated.Perhaps this relates to another peculiar feature of the site’s early history:the seeming absence of evidence for central Mexican contact or influ-ence, so prominent at other major sites in the lowlands. Such referencesmight have existed but were later seen as representing ties to unpopulardynasties, ideologies, or rituals and thus destroyed. The absence of earlytexts at Calakmul reduces us to extremely speculative scenarios, butwhat little evidence exists raises tantalizing questions about the earlyrole of this large and important city.Other Sites and RegionsSeveral other southern lowland sites deserve brief consideration interms of the maymodel, although supporting evidence is often difficultto marshal. In some cases this is because of the unique way the siterecorded its history (Palenque erected only one stela, for example), or be-cause the site has not been amply excavated or published. Again, con-siderable dynastic history presented here is drawn from Martin andGrube (2000).Caracol, BelizeCaracol, lying about 75 kilometers southeast of Tikal in western Belize,was established in the Middle Preclassic period. It is an enormous city,covering an area of 177 km2with an estimated population of more than115,000 (Chase and Chase 2001 : 107). Nine major causeways (of a totalof some twenty-seven) radiate out from the site to nearby satellites, in-06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 191"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"192maya political sciencecluding Cahal Pichik, La Rejolla, Retiro, and others. Caracol’s dynastywas apparently founded in a.d.331 (Chase and Chase 2001 : 125; see alsoMartin and Grube 2000 : 85– 99); its founder is Te’ K’ab’ Chak, associatedwith the dates 331 and 349. Caracol’s Emblem Glyph does not incorpo-rate the k’ul ajaw or divine lord phrase (Martin and Grube 2000 : 87). Theancient name of the site is believed to be Oxwitza’ ‘Three Hills Water’(ibid.), but this may be a specific place within Caracol.Caracol’s Late Preclassic and Early Classic architecture displays char-acteristics of the Tikalmayrealm in northeastern Petén. Its largest edi-fice ,nicknamed Caana ‘Sky Place’ ,is a triadic structure in its latestform — a huge pyramidal platform with three Late Classic structuresarranged at right angles on top — like those from El Mirador and else-where. Similarly ,an E-Group was constructed at Caracol beginning circa300b.c.In this group ,Structure A-2 sits on the west side of a plaza facinga line of three structures on the Structure A-5/6/7 platform. Two monu-ments ,Stelae 12 and 20 ,stood in front of central Structure A-6; Stela 20shows the ruler Yajaw Te’ K’inich I seated in a throne or cave and datesto 487. A cache of Early Classic monuments (Stelae 13 ,14 ,15 ,16 ,and Al-tar 7) was found in association with Structure A-5. These monumentscelebrate a sequence of k’atun endings ,including 9.4.0.0.0 (514) and9.6.0.0.0 (554). Stela 16 ,which celebrates the k’atun ending of 9.5.0.0.0(534) ,mentions the Copán ruler Waterlily Jaguar ,a reference that “dem-onstrates that Copán was a politically dominant center in the MiddleClassic and that it was somehow prestigious for the Caracol lord to men-tion his interactions with Waterlily-Jaguar of Copán” (Fash 1991 : 96 ,cit-ing Grube).Caracol celebrated Classic k’atun endings with Giant Ajaw altars,eighteen of them, the first dating to 9.3.0.0.0 2 Ajaw (495) and the lastdating to 9.12.0.0.0 or 9.13.0.0.0. (672, 692). These can be considered thesite’s unique maycelebratory program. Otherwise, Caracol stelae are“deeply conservative in their sculptural style, retaining anachronisticdetails of costuming and pose” (Martin and Grube 2000 : 90). The ruler isshown frontally, with his head in profile, cradling a ceremonial bar inupraised arms in front of his chest, a posture typical of Tikal’s EarlyClassic monuments as well as those from Copán and Quiriguá. Smallfigures — dwarfs?— appear on either side of his feet, and he is surroundedby “the open maws of serpents . . . each of which disgorges an ancestor”(ibid. : 91).A key event occurred on 9.5.19.1.2 9 Ik’ 5 Wo (April 16, 553, near theend of a K’atun 11 Ajaw), when Yajaw Te’ K’inich II came to rule at Cara-col “by action of the king of Tikal” (Houston 1991). In the following yearCaracol displayed its Emblem Glyph. In April 556 an “ax event” oc-curred, interpreted as Tikal’s attack on and defeat of Caracol, and not06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 192"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"other classic period may-based realms193long thereafter, in April 562, Calakmul and Caracol “defeated” Tikal ina star war. The story of Tikal’s “conquest” in 562 is told on Caracol Al-tar 21, set into the alley of the A-Group ballcourt, which celebrates the9.10.0.0.0 k’atun ending in 633. This supposed defeat marked the begin-ning of Tikal’s 130-year hiatus, during which Caracol flourished. How-ever when Tikal staged a resurgence in the late seventh century, Cara-col then experienced its own corresponding hiatus in monumenterection. This interval lasted 128 years, from 9.12.0.0.0 (672) to9.18.10.0.0 (800). (An exception in this disruption is an unusual slatestela commemorating the lajuntun of 9.13.10.0.0 [702]).Caracol’s “defeat” of Tikal in 562 marks the beginning of a long pe-riod of apparent conflict among Tikal, Caracol, Calakmul, Naranjo, andDos Pilas. It is tempting to speculate from Maya calendrics that theseinteractions involved Caracol’s status as an existing or emerging cycleseat. Caracol defeated Naranjo twice, in 9.9.18.6.3 (631) and again in9.10.3.2.12 (636).During the Terminal Classic, Caracol enjoyed a renaissance andseems to have had close relations with Ucanal, perhaps beginning asearly as 793 (Chase, Grube, and Chase 1991; Chase and Chase 2004).Caracol Altar 23 (800) celebrates the capture of two kings, one fromUcanal, who are shown with arms bound behind their backs. Caracol Al-tars 12 and 13, dated to 820, show the Caracol ruler, K’inich Tob’il Yoat,conversing with the Ucanal king, Papamalil; one shows a captive namedMakal Te’. K’inich Tob’il Yoat may have set the last Giant Ajaw altar ofthe site marking the K’atun 7 Ajaw ending and b’ak’tun ending of10.0.0.0.0 in March 830. The final monuments of Caracol, the small andasymmetrical Stela 17 and its accompanying Altar 10, date to 849, whileall-glyphic Stela 10 commemorates the lajuntun of 10.1.10.0.0 (859).With respect to Caracol’s mayseating, then, the interval from 859,the date of the last stela, to 495, the date of the first Giant Ajaw altar, is 364 years, 20 years or one k’atun short of the 128 + 256 year full maycycle. Significantly, the site’s Giant Ajaw altar series began in com-memoration of the completion of a K’atun 2 Ajaw.Satellite sites within Caracol’s seating of the maymight include LaRejolla, Mountain Cow, Hatzcab Ceel, Sacul, Naj Tunich, Ixtutz, Ixkun,and B’ital, among others. Other possibilities are Ucanal and Nakum,both of which seem to have been pawns in the competition among Cara-col, Calakmul, Naranjo, and Tikal at various points in their history. Tojudge from epigraphic and ceramic evidence, or more specifically, lackthereof, Caracol’s influence does not seem to have extended into orsouth of the Maya mountains and southern Belize (Wanyerka, pers.comm., June 14, 2002; Prufer, pers. comm., June 18, 2002), territory ap-parently dominated by Copán and Quiriguá.06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 193"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"194maya political sciencePalenque and Toniná, Chiapas, MexicoThe site of Palenque lies 160 kilometers west of Tikal on the boundarybetween the Gulf Coast plain and the Chiapas hills. The site’s ancientname was Lakam Ja ‘Big Water’ and the kingdom was called Bak orB’aakal ‘Bone’. Palenque used several main signs in its Emblem Glyph,the most common being T570 (bak‘wavy bone,’ ‘captive’) but also T590(a mandible).Palenque’s early dynastic history (Martin and Grube 2000 : 155–175)is known only from a series of Late Classic retrospective texts ratherthan from successive historical monuments erected by its rulers. In-deed, no Early Classic inscriptions are known for Palenque except for astatement of ownership on an unprovenienced travertine bowl. Thesite’s mythic history, however, as related by texts in the Cross Group,goes back to the late fourth millennium b.c.and refers to the birth ofseveral deities, including the well-known “Palenque Triad” of gods GI (Hunapu of the Hero Twins [Lounsbury 1985]; also Chak Xib Chak);GII (an infantile k’awil); and GIII, the Jaguar Sun God. The final ruler inthis series, presumably also mythical, was Bloodletter of the Snake in the late Early Preclassic period, who was born in 993 b.c.and accededin 967 b.c.(ca. 5.9.2.0.0). The structure of Palenque’s recorded mythichistory closely parallels that of the Popol Vuh(Tedlock 1985 : 62 – 63).One of Palenque’s Late Classic texts mentions Siyaj K’ak’, leader ofthe Mexican “arrival” at Tikal in a.d.378. It is possible, then, thatPalenque’s dynastic founding — like those of Tikal and Copán —was re-lated to that event. However, the dynasty is said to have been foundedon 8.19.15.3.4 1 K’an 2 K’ayab (March 9, 431) with the accession of rulerK’uk’ B’alam I. K’uk’ B’alam holds the title Toktan Lord, referring to anunknown site that might be his original home. Edmonson (1979) sug-gested that Palenque seated the cycle shortly thereafter in 435 on theb’ak’tun completion of 9.0.0.0.0. A series of poorly known rulers follow,one of whom was K’an Joy Kitam I, who ascended in 529. It is recordedthat in 496 he had taken on “a junior title and presumed heir-apparencyat the age of six” and that the “ceremony took place at Toktan” (Martinand Grube 2000 : 158).During the Early Classic, Palenque’s rulers may or may not have cel-ebrated k’atun endings; if they did, their rituals did not entail the erec-tion of commemorative stelae. We are informed of early k’atun obser-vances only from one of the inscribed panels in the Late Classic Templeof the Inscriptions, which gives a history of rulers linked to nine k’atunendings (Schele and Mathews 1998 : 105–106). The record of several ac-cessions on thirteen-tun completions is an unusual pattern and may bean idealized, reconstructed history.06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 194"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"other classic period may-based realms195The best-known portion of Palenque’s history begins with the rulerK’inich Janab’ Pakal I. Pakal was born on 9.8.9.13.0 8 Ajaw 13 Pop(March 24, 603), son of Lady Sak K’uk’, and acceded to the throne at theage of twelve on July 27, 615 (9.9.2.4.8 5 Lamat 1 Mol). He married awoman from Toktan, had at least two sons with her who succeeded him,and died at the age of eighty in 683 (9.12.11.5.18). Pakal celebrated thek’atun endings of 9.11.0.0.0 K’atun 12 Ajaw (652) and 9.12.0.0.0 K’atun10 Ajaw (672). His Late Classic palace complex is assumed to be a popolnaj, or council house (Schele and Mathews 1998 : 368n31).In the k’atun preceding Pakal’s reign, Palenque was “attacked” twiceby Calakmul some 250 kilometers to the northeast and once by Bonam-pak, about half that distance to the southeast. The first attack by Calak-mul, probably in April 599, involved an “axing” and “throwing down,”interpreted as the sacking of the city and the overthrow of its rulers andpatron deities (Martin and Grube 2000 : 160). The second attack cametwelve years later, in April 611. The palace structure at Palenque com-memorates these and other events with carvings of prisoners. Appar-ently the site was in disarray for a k’atun or so, and the fact that majorrituals were not performed at the turning of the ninth k’atun in 613 wassufficiently worrisome to be noted in the site’s later inscriptions. Twoyears later, in 615, K’inich Janab’ Pakal I assumed rulership.A significant event occurred in 659, when Pakal was visited by some-one named Nun Ujol Chak, once thought to be the exiled ruler of Tikalbut who is now believed to have been a native of a site in Tabasco (Mar-tin 2003 : 28). This event was recorded on buildings Pakal constructed(Schele and Mathews 1998 : 97) and apparently also resulted in the im-portation of Petén-style polychrome pottery into Palenque’s Murciela-gos ceramic complex (see Rands 1973 : 58). It also marks the beginning ofthe effigy censer stand “cult” or set of mortuary rituals that celebratedthe Jaguar Sun God of the Underworld (JGU) (Rice 1999).Edmonson (1979 : 15) suggested that Palenque again seated the cyclein a.d.692 (9.13.0.0.0). One of the most splendid architectural com-plexes in the Maya lowlands, Palenque’s “Cross Group”— consisting ofthe Temple of the Cross, the Temple of the Foliated Cross, and theTemple of the Sun —were dedicated in 692, perhaps as part of this re-newal. Also, Palenque’s only carved stela was erected to commemoratethis period ending (Martin and Grube 2000 : 169). Satellites withinPalenque’s realm would have included Tortuguero, 61 kilometers westof Palenque, whose ruler “conquered” Comalcalco in 649 and also “at-tacked” a Palenque ally in 644 and 655. Another is Toniná, 64 kilome-ters to the south, which attacked Palenque in 711 and seized its ruler,K’an Joy Kitam. Piedras Negras might also lie within Palenque’s realm,as a sajal of that site’s ruler was taken captive in 725.06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 195"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"196maya political scienceI agree with Edmonson in proposing dates for Palenque’s mayseatingthat parallel those of Tikal. In other words, the seating began in 435,shortly after the founding of the site’s dynastic line in 431 and the yearof the inauguration of the long-ruling king nicknamed “Casper.” Thesecond seating of the mayat Palenque would have been in 692. The lastof Palenque’s rulers was Wak Kimi Janab’ Pakal III, who acceded in 799.Residential occupation of the site ended shortly thereafter, to judge fromthe ceramic remains, and the last known reference to Pakal III is around814 at Comalcalco (Martin and Grube 2002 : 175). Palenque’s last mayseating, then, would have lasted barely 128 years or a half cycle (692 +128 \u0004820).One candidate for Palenque’s successor as mayseat is Toniná, per-haps known in ancient times as Po or Popo, which first displayed its Em-blem Glyph on or around 9.8.0.0.0 (593) (Mathews 1985). The site ispoorly known in the Early and Middle Classic periods (Martin andGrube 2000 : 177–189), and there are numerous gaps in dates on the city’smore than two hundred monuments (Mathews 2001). Retrospective ref-erence is made to a king in a.d.217, and various monuments date to thesixth century but give few rulers’ names. The site’s Late Classic historyis better understood. Sculpture from the reign of Ruler 2 (668 – 687)shows emphasis on Giant Ajaw altars, otherwise known primarily fromCaracol, and depictions of bound captives, also prominent on Tikal’smonuments. A stucco mural at the eastern end of the fifth terrace of theToniná acropolis shares the theme and layout of the Atetelco compoundmurals at Teotihuacan, displaying a gridded, feathered frame withmedallions incorporating inverted figures.

He con-structed the sunken Ballcourt 1, probably dedicated in 699, which de-picted six prisoners, all said to be vassals of the Palenque ruler K’anB’alam. The name glyphs of these prisoners give insights into other sitesin the Palenque-Toniná orbit, including Amayte, La Mar, and Yaxchilán.Toniná’s monuments register 39 period-ending dates, a relativelysmall proportion of the total of 131 dates at the site (Mathews 2001), andonly 18 of them were k’atun-ending dates (the remaining 22 commem-orate jotuns, etc.). Toniná has an unusual pattern of performing some ac-tivity on Ajaw days of dates ending in 9.0 (i.e., nine tuns or “years,” zerok’ins) (Table 6.1).

While it is unlikely that Dos Pilas itself seated the may,the site appears to have played a critical role in the balance of power be-tween the two major political rivals of the Late Classic period, Tikal andCalakmul.Newly discovered sections of a hieroglyphic stairway at Dos Pilas in-dicate that the site was founded by Tikal in a.d.632 when Tikal’s rulerdispatched his four-year-old son, B’alaj Kan K’awil, to the Petexbatún(Fahsen 2002). This founding was motivated in part by Tikal’s desire tocontrol trade from the highlands along the Río Pasión (Demarest, pers.comm., July 1, 2002). Those and subsequent events are extremely con-fusing as to motivations and internal and external relations of the prin-cipals. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish places because, as the sonof the Tikal ruler, B’alaj Kan K’awil seems to have felt entitled to displaythe Tikal Emblem Glyph. There was apparently some intradynastic con-flict between B’alaj Kan K’awil at Dos Pilas and Nun Ujol Chak, ayounger (?) brother currently ruling Tikal, and Calakmul was broughtinto the fray. By 648 B’alaj Kan K’awil described himself as yajaw, or vas-sal, of Calakmul, and in 652 Calakmul defeated Dos Pilas. Then, in 657,in a star-war event, Calakmul “defeated” Tikal, forcing Nun Ujol Chakinto exile at Palenque.In 672 Nun Ujol Chak of Tikal struck back: he returned from exile,overthrew Dos Pilas, and forced its ruler, B’alaj Kan K’awil, into five-year exile. B’alaj Kan K’awil then returned to Dos Pilas on the same dayin 677 when Calakmul “defeated” Tikal and two years after that led hisown “battle” that resulted in the “defeat” of Tikal. It was after that de-feat that Dos Pilas, under the guidance of B’alaj Kan K’awil’s son andsuccessor, built the commemorative Hieroglyphic Stairway 2, which re-ferred to the thirteen tzuk or divisions (k’atun seats) in Tikal’s realm.Perhaps because of these conflicts and exile, it was not until around682 that Dos Pilas and its rulers were able to begin a major program ofmonument erection and construction. During that year, B’alaj KanK’awil visited Calakmul to celebrate the lajuntun of 9.12.10.0.0 9 Ajaw18 Zotz (he also erected Dos Pilas Stela 9 to commemorate that event)and then returned four years later for the accession of Calakmul’s rulerYich’ak K’ak’. Also in 682 his daughter, Lady Six Sky, was sent to es-tablish a new dynasty at Naranjo. Her son, K’ak’ Tiliw Kan Chak, cameto rule Naranjo in 693 at the young age of five years; he was probablymerely a figurehead under her leadership until her death in 741. His fa-ther is not named but was likely a lord of Calakmul, as her son pro-claims himself a vassal of that site.B’alaj Kan K’awil’s son, Itzamnaj K’awil, came to rule Dos Pilas in 69806-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 198"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"other classic period may-based realms199and erected numerous stelae commemorating the events and period end-ings of his reign (Stuart and Houston 1994 : 84 – 92).

Stela 15,dated 9.14.10.0.0 5 Ajaw 3 Mak (October 11, 721), was erected in the ElDuende complex on the east side of the site. This stela is of particularinterest because the text in the upper register of the monument includes“five distinct place names, each in association with a different event”(Stuart and Houston 1994 : 91). According to this text, Itzamnaj K’awilscattered at El Duende, was adorned at Seibal, and then, apparently onthe same day, erected a stela at Aguateca; eighty days later, he erected astone — probably Stela 15 itself — at El Duende and then danced at DosPilas (Stuart and Houston 1994 : 92).An apparent regent, known as Ruler 3, whose wife was from Can-cuen, led Dos Pilas following the death of Itzamnaj K’awil in 726. Ruler 3 “conquered” Seibal in 735 in a conquest and “axing” event thatwas commemorated on stelae at Dos Pilas and Aguateca; both show theruler standing on top of the captive Seibal king (Stuart and Houston1994 : 61). Following this event, he initiated the use of what is often re-ferred to as the barrel-like variant of the Tikal Emblem Glyph but is alsoT716, the twice-bound snouted head of an animal. In addition, Ruler 3erected the beautifully carved Stela 8, touting the achievements of hispredecessor; the monument’s text mentions the Paddler Gods (Stuart,Houston, and Robertson 1999 : 166).A text from Seibal on Hieroglyphic Stairway 1 refers to a later Dos Pi-las ruler, K’awil Kan K’inich (741–761), who in 746 scattered at Seibaland then again at Tamarindito two days later (Stuart and Houston1994 : 92). These events recorded on Seibal H.S. 1 and Dos Pilas Stela 15provide some evidence that Late Classic kings, in the Petexbatún-Pasiónarea at least, participated in ceremonial visits to sites in their realms andcarried out important rituals, such as scattering. Whether such ritualcircuits were generally part of their duties as kings or specifically part oftheir obligations through the burden of the k’atun or mayis impossibleto determine, although it could of course be both.After 761, Dos Pilas’s fortunes were dramatically reversed: there areno further references to Itzamnaj K’awil, the site seems to have been vir-tually abandoned, and a series of petty-king pretenders ruled from sev-eral sites. The upstart Dos Pilas kingdom, which was established arounda.d.632 and began using a distinctive Emblem in 735, collapsed around761, to judge from the last mention of the site or its ruler at Tamarindito.Dos Pilas thus endured some 129 years, approximately half a mayof128 years, its downfall (or last reference) occurring in the lajuntun of a06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 199"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"200maya political scienceK’atun 13 Ajaw. The final appearance of the Mutul main sign of an Em-blem Glyph in the Petexbatún area occurred in 807, by which time theregion was essentially abandoned.Meanwhile, as the Petexbatún sites were collapsing in the late eighthcentury (Demarest 2004; O’Mansky and Dunning 2004), other sites atsome remove were briefly flourishing. One of these was Machaquilá, ona tributary of the Río Pasión southwest of Dos Pilas, which was con-quered by that site in 652 (Demarest, pers. comm., July 1, 2002). In 664,Taj Mo’, ruler of Machaquilá, was captured by the Dos Pilas ruler B’alajKan K’awil (Fahsen 2002). Machaquilá erected stelae over a half-maype-riod of 128 years, beginning on 9.14.0.0.0 6 Ajaw 13 Muwan (Decem-ber 3, 711) and ending on 10.0.10.0.0 6 Ajaw 8 Pop (January 20, 840) (Gra-ham 1967; Fahsen 1984). The sites of Machaquilá, Cancuén to the south,and Dos Pilas had fairly close relations, perhaps through marital andother alliances, as the wife of Dos Pilas Ruler 3 was from Cancuén. Far-ther to the north, however, Seibal was poised to take over as TerminalClassic mayseat in the Pasión region (see Chap. 7).OverviewAlthough the sites and events described here fit into the overall may-based model of lowland politico-ritual centers, they do so in ways thatdiffer considerably from Tikal and from each other. This does notweaken the mayhypothesis; rather, it illustrates the flexible and in-dependent agency of individual rulers and cities as actors within thiscosmic structure. It is not at all unreasonable to suggest that each indi-vidual Classic period cycle seat would develop its own program of ar-chitecture, iconography, and ritual asserting the unique historical, ge-nealogical, and divine claims to power of its ruling dynasty. At the sametime, however, key elements of the highly ritualized celebrations ofcyclical calendrical intervals, k’atuns and mays,were broadly sharedand very publicly proclaimed the participation of cycle seats and theirsatellites in rituals designed to ensure cosmic continuity throughoutthe lowland Maya world.It is interesting that two of these probable mayseats, Copán andPalenque, in addition to Tikal, were apparently visited by (or otherwiseinvolved in) the central Mexican arrival of Siyaj K’ak’ in the late fourthcentury. Moreover, texts carved on bones from Tikal Burial 116, pre-sumably the tomb of Jasaw Kan K’awil, include “a long list of death-dates for foreign nobility, while others supply intriguing, but still largelyopaque, references to the kingdoms of Copan and Palenque” (Martin andGrube 2000 : 47) and to a captive from Calakmul. All this supports 06-T2963 6/15/04 2:22 PM Page 200"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"other classic period may-based realms201the concept that some broad-scale underlying themes or plans unitedthese sites.With respect to Copán’s seating of the may,the site exhibits patternsthat are considerably different from those of Tikal, although these citieshad very close early relationships in the founding of their dynasties andstyles of their monuments. Copán did not appear to adhere as stronglyas did Tikal to K’atuns 8 Ajaw as significant ritual nodes, although theseries of significant dates seems to conform to units of 128 and256 years. Architectural programs also differed: although Copán has oneradial structure, it does not have Tikal’s E-Group assemblages or twin-pyramid complexes, and Tikal lacks the hieroglyphic stairway programfound at Copán and many other sites.Calakmul and its seemingly continuous hostilities with Tikal war-rant some discussion, because the complexity of these interactions suggests something far more intricate and deep-seated — a political pasde deux — than simple territorial aggression. To recapitulate, in a.d.623,a lajuntun dated 2 Ajaw, Calakmul ended its hiatus in monument erection. A vase probably dated 691 shows a Calakmul lord deliveringtribute to Tikal, but four years later in 695 Calakmul was “defeated” by Tikal. In 736 Tikal’s Altar 9 celebrating the Tikal ruler Yik’in Kan K’awil’s inauguration suggests another “defeat” of Calakmul, as it portrays a bound Calakmul lord. Five years later, in 741, five stelaewere erected at Calakmul commemorating the lajuntun ending of9.15.10.0.0, the midpoint of a K’atun 2 Ajaw. Shortly thereafter, Tikal“defeated” two of Calakmul’s allies, El Perú in 743 and Naranjo in 744.While in some cases the textual evidence for conflict between thetwo sites is fairly clear, other data raise questions. In particular, ceram-ics recovered from excavations of tombs and other contexts indicate thatCalakmul residents used types and groups of the Tikal-related ceramicspheres in the Early and Late Classic (Tepeu, Eznab) (Folan et al. 1995).As Braswell et al. (2004) note with respect to artifacts in general, LateClassic Calakmul participated in an “essentially Petén-focused interac-tion sphere.”In the maymodel, the obvious competition between Calakmul andTikal would revolve around the seating of the mayat 256-year intervals,and perhaps other calendrical issues as well. One point that emergesfrom examination of significant dates at Calakmul is that while a few ofthem adhere to the K’atun 8 Ajaw dates so important at Tikal, the ma-jor transitions seem to coincide with K’atuns 2 Ajaw or lajuntuns on aday 2 Ajaw in the Maya tzolk’in, or 260-day sacred calendar. K’atuns 2Ajaw occur at asymmetric intervals of 60 tuns after a K’atun 8 Ajaw or,differently stated, 196 tuns before a K’atun 8 Ajaw.

In addition, the two sites might have had ethno-linguistic differences (Stuart 1995 : 271–272) that could have exacerbatedconflict. Whatever led to this different calendrico-ritual emphasis, ifreal, must have occurred or been initiated during the Calakmul hiatus,which began in 514 and ended 109 years later with a renewed emphasison commemorating period endings. As noted, two stelae were erected in623, the lajuntun ending of 9.9.10.0.0 on a day 2 Ajaw 13 Pop.Caracol’s relations with Calakmul are of interest in this context, be-cause its pattern of celebrating k’atun endings with Giant Ajaw altarsinaugurated its seating of the mayat the end of a K’atun 2 Ajaw in 495.In addition, Caracol was often allied with Calakmul against Tikal, andCaracol’s star-war defeat of Tikal in 562 is sometimes considered to havebrought about Tikal’s hiatus. The pattern of creating Giant Ajaw altarsat Tikal and Quiriguá, after a “hiatus” and apparently at the start ofk’atun or mayseatings, warrants further investigation.As a last note on Late Classic calendrics, it bears mention that Ed-monson (1988 : 148 –149, 233) identified two closely related “new” cal-endars that appeared in the western Maya lowlands during this period,the so-called Campeche and Palenque calendars. These differ from theTikal calendar in seemingly minor ways, primarily in the count begin-ning with 1 instead of 0 and the use of terminal dating. At the time ofEdmonson’s writing he noted only eighteen examples of the use of thesecalendars, which appeared in a 277-year interval between 665 and 942.They are found at only eleven sites: Uxmal (earliest and latest exam-ples), Edzná (three times, including two period-ending stelae), Jaina, Ho-lactún, and Kabah in the Puuc area of Campeche, and in the Usumacintaarea at Toniná, Palenque, Yaxchilán (3), Piedras Negras (2), and Bonam-pak. In addition, Dos Pilas Stela 8 records dates in both the Tikal and theCampeche calendars (Bricker 1997a:2). Only one nonwestern site,Naranjo (2), used these calendars.One peculiar feature of the dates recorded by these calendars is thatthey refer to the month Yaxk’in (n\u00047) in the Maya 365-day calendar,then equivalent to the month of June (n\u00048) in the Gregorian calendar(Table 6.2).Edmonson (1982 : 179n4981) notes that Yaxk’in is the only monththat is distinctively referred to as being “born.” The clustering of thesedates in mid- to late June suggests an association with the summer sol-stice, although many dates do not specifically correspond and others oc-cur in other months with no solsticial or equinoxial associations.

These concerns were identified by archae-ologists early in the twentieth century and have molded research andhistorical reconstructions since. There have been few discussions ofevents and processes common to both regions (but see Demarest, Rice,and Rice 2004).The maymodel proposes a different interpretation of Terminal Clas-sic circumstances in the lowlands.

The lack ofcarved stelae may be explained by the statement on Dos Pilas Stela 2that others “chopped the writing” at Seibal (Schele and Mathews1998 : 177). For the present purposes, the most interesting of Seibal’s latestelae are from Group A on the western part of the site, an area of pri-marily Terminal Classic occupation. Also in Group A are Structure A-10, the eastern structure of an E-Group, and Structure A-14, whose hi-eroglyphic stairway records much of the earlier history of the site(Mathews and Willey 1991 : 50).Seibal’s sculpted monuments are frequently divided into Maya andnon-Maya styles. In an early study of the so-called non-Classic-MayaSeibal monuments, Graham (1973) grouped them into facies A and B. Fa-cies A stelae, dating from 10.1.0.0.0 through 10.3.0.0.0 (849 – 889), por-trayed figures dressed in more or less Classic style but with distinctivenon-Classic facial features. This grouping includes Stelae 8, 10, 11, 20,and 21, which closely resemble Stelae 1 and 2 from Ixlú and Stela 4 ofUcanal (Graham 1973 : 213). Facies B monuments, showing individualswith extremely long hair and lacking typical Classic attire, are Stelae 2,3, 13, 14, 15, and 17. Tying these stylistic elements to both Puuc andGulf Coast origins, Graham (1973 : 217; cf.

The Palace Tablets appear to havebeen reset into the lowest terraces of Structure A-14 in the Central Plazaof Group A ,which dates to the Terminal Classic ,suggesting continuedveneration of ancestors. “Stelae” 5 and 7 are paired relief panels dated9.18.10.0.0 (800) flanking the hieroglyphic stairway of Structure A-10 inthe E-Group; the panels display ballgame imagery. Group II includes the“temple stelae,” that is, those monuments on and around Structure A-3,along with Stela 12. Group III monuments ,Stelae 1 and 20 ,also in GroupA ,commemorate the k’atun ending of 10.3.0.0.0.

Structure A-3(Fig. 7.2) is a radial temple — a square platform with stairways on foursides and a small three-roomed vaulted structure on top with doorwaysopening to the four directions. The red-painted superstructure incorpo-rated Puuc-style masonry and vault construction (Andrews and Robles1985 : 65), and the multicolored frieze around the top bears the date 7 Ajaw 18 Sip, probably 10.0.0.0.0. This frieze contained sculptured im-ages of twelve individuals, in all likelihood the lords of the twelve poli-ties, or tzuk— the k’atun seats —within Seibal’s Terminal Classic mayrealm. As such, it calls to mind the depictions of eight lords in the friezearound Copán’s earlier Structure 10L-22, the popol naj. In the context ofMaya architectural symbolism, Structure A-3 itself is highly symbolic,as symmetrical, four-stairway, radial buildings and other quadripartitefigures had been associated with calendrical cycle completion sinceMiddle Preclassic times and continued through the Postclassic.Structure A-3 and its stelae were built and/or dedicated at the k’atunending of (10.1.0.0.0) 5 Ajaw 3 K’ayab’ (November 28, 849) by a new rulerat Seibal, Wat’ul Chatel, formerly known as Ruler E.

This suggests thatevents commemorated by these stelae and the structure itself are thoseof the b’ak’tun ending in 830.Wat’ul might be yet another foreigner — a “stranger-king” (as earlierat Tikal and Copán)— at Seibal, because he gives no parentage state-ments and there is little information available about his accession otherthan that he “arrived” at Seibal (see below). He held numerous titles, in-cluding Aj Jun K’in ‘He of one Day’ and Aj B’olon Tun (see Schele andFreidel 1990 : 387–389; Schele and Grube 1995 : 113, 119 –121; Schele andMathews 1998 : 175–196; Stuart 1988 : 206, 208). The latter seems to bea regional title, used earlier in the Petexbatún and by a previous Seibalruler, and has been translated as “He of Nine Tasks” (Schele and Math-ews 1998 : 351n5), but it also has been read as Aj B’olon Jaab’tal (Martinand Grube 2000 : 227). This suggests a reading “He of Nine Jaab’s” oryears, though not necessarily nine years of age. It might refer to somekingly ritual occurring at nine-year intervals, such as the jetz’ lu’umwalk of securing the land in modern Tekanto (Thompson 1999 : 238 –239). A pattern of dates on Ajaw days ending with 9.0, or 9 tuns com-pleted within a k’atun, suggests a similar pattern (see also dates at To-niná, Chap. 6).Five stelae were placed with Structure A-3, one at the foot of each ofthe four platform stairways and one in the center of the temple super-structure. Although each of these stelae depicts a different scene, allhave been said to represent ways in which period endings were com-memorated (Stuart 1988 : 206; Schele and Grube 1995 : 119 –121) as wellas the varied responsibilities of Maya sovereigns in the cosmos.Stela 11 (Fig. 7.3) has a somewhat unusual layout in three registers,with a horizontal text across the top of the monument and a short panelopposite the ruler’s face. The text records that Aj B’olon Tun arrived inthe center of Seibal under the sponsorship of an individual named KanEk’ Jo Pet from a place named K’anwitz ‘Yellow Mountain’, tentativelyidentified as the site of Ucanal (Stuart and Houston 1994 : 20 –21).In addition to the arrival date of 6 K’awak 17 Sip, the day before the 10.0.0.0 b’ak’tun completion, this monument records a day 5 Ajaw3 K’ayab’, also noted on the other Structure A-3 monuments, which isthe day of completion of the first k’atun of Cycle 10.

These monuments generally do not display stan-dard Classic lowland styles of portraiture and some have atypical place-ments. Two are k’atun-ending markers: Stela 1, on the north end of the South Plaza, celebrates 10.2.0.0.0; Stela 20 dates to 10.3.0.0.0. Bothshow similar figures carrying a similar staff. Stela 20 is one of three ste-lae (Stelae 13 and 17 are the others) that formed an east-west alignmentof monuments on Structure A-24 and its large frontal terrace on the westside of the South Plaza.Another monument in Group A, Stela 19, is unusual not only in itsasymmetrical shape but also in the figure’s beaked mask and orna-mented speech scroll. Dating of the monument is uncertain, but its 1 B’en 1 Pop reading suggests either a “ritualistic calculation” or a dateof 10.1.18.6.13 (Graham 1990 : 60). I am inclined instead to believe thedate is a jotun, lajuntun, or jolajuntun ending, as the figure is perform-ing the scattering rite.Stela 3 (Fig. 7.7) ,found in front (west) of Structure A6 and now in theMuseo Nacional in Guatemala City, has three registers (Graham 1990 :61– 64), reminiscent of monuments in Yucatán. The upper and lowerregisters show pairs of seated individuals conversing. Those in the upperregister are long-haired and barefoot, wearing loincloths, necklaces oflarge round beads, and masks. The figures in the lower register are alsobarefoot and long-haired, but they have different ornaments and areholding objects that suggested to Graham (1990 : 62) “the rattle anddrum of the katun.” The middle register shows an individual standingin a “plumed and conventionalized serpent mouth.” The text hassquared glyph cartouches, and Graham dates Stela 3 to (10.2.5.3.10) 1 Ok8 Kank’in (September 28, 874).07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 214"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"new terminal classic mayrealms215figure7.7 Seibal Stela 3 (drawing courtesy of John Montgomery).Lake Petén ItzáIn central Petén, the political situation is far more complex than indi-cated by the content and distribution of monuments of the Tikal realm(see Chap. 5).

In Post-classic Yucatán, descending images were usually considered to repre-sent “God E,” the Maize God (Taube 1992 : 41–50). The figure on the Flores stela displays many of this deity’s associated traits: foliage ap-pearing out of the head (often out of a k’an sign), featherlike elementsprojecting from the arms, and holding something (maize? tamales? amirror?) in outstretched hands. God E is associated not only with maize,life, fertility, and agricultural cycles but also with death and sacrifice,and may also represent “the idealized ancestor” (ibid.).

It has a distinctive non-Petén-style pointed shape, with both “cor-ners” removed, a form similar to monuments in the Puuc area (see be-low). One side of the monument shows a single figure facing left, wear-ing a beaded collar with a round pectoral and holding a ceremonial barover his chest. A glyphic text appears to the right of the figure. The re-verse side shows a figure also facing left, holding a ceremonial bar at thewaist, suggesting a Late Classic date.UcanalUcanal lies in eastern Petén, Guatemala, on the west bank of the MopánRiver. It is located some 51 kilometers southeast of Tikal, closer to andsoutheast of Naranjo, and directly west of but at a slightly greater dis-tance from Caracol. In this location Ucanal’s political history seems tohave been dominated by those two large sites.As noted above, it has been suggested that the Maya name for Ucanalmight have been K’anwitz ‘Yellow Mountain’ (see also Grube and Mar-tin 1998 : 109 –113). Early maps suggested Ucanal was a quaternary-level site in the Classic lowland Maya settlement hierarchy (Marcus1976 : Table 13). However, recent mapping and excavations at the site re-veal that it was substantially larger than originally supposed, with 114structure groups, an E-Group, two ballcourts, two causeways, and twocanals that descended to the river (Laporte and Mejía 2002; see alsoCorzo, Alvarado, and Laporte 1998). The site had 26 stelae, 18 altars, 7 monuments, and a hieroglyphic stairway in Ballcourt 1.During the reign of Siyaj Kan K’awil at Tikal, a.d.411– 456, Ucanal’sruler was yahaw, or subordinate, to him (Martin and Grube 2000 : 35).But the site later displayed its own (?)

Thetext on Stela 1 at Sacul states that in February 760 its ruler received themanikin scepter in the presence of someone from Ucanal (ibid. : 193),suggesting that Sacul was under that site’s hegemony. Ixkun Stela 2refers to a war with Ucanal in May 780.Although occupied since the Middle Preclassic, Ucanal seems to havereached its peak in the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic, experi-encing three waves of external contacts. The first brought mosaic sculp-ture facades, the second brought new monuments and grandiose remod-eling of structures, and the third saw construction of round structures(Laporte and Mejía 2002 : 43 – 44). Laporte and Mejía suggest that the siteflourished some two hundred fifty years beyond the end of the Late Clas-sic and into the eleventh century; I would see this as a maycycle run-ning from 820 – 830 to 1076 or so.Of the ten sculptured stelae at Ucanal, one probably dates to the la-juntun of 9.12.10.0.0 9 Ajaw 18 Sotz’ (682; Laporte and Mejía 2002 : 30),five commemorate Late Classic k’atun or lajuntun endings beginning in9.19.0.0.0, and three date to the Terminal Classic period. Iconographi-cally, they share much with monuments in the Tikal mayrealm, sug-gesting that by the Terminal Classic, Ucanal’s ties to Naranjo, Caracol,and Calakmul had been ruptured. In addition, ceramics from the site’sLate and Terminal Classic complexes are members of the Tepeu (Tikal-Uaxactún) sphere.It will be recalled that the monuments around Seibal Structure A-3(particularly Stela 11) celebrated the arrival of a new king, Wat’ul Cha-tel, in 830, who was apparently sponsored by king Kan Ek’ Jo Pet from aplace named K’anwitz, possibly Ucanal (Grube and Martin 1998 : 109).The occurrence of the name or title Kan Ek’ in the Terminal Classic pe-riod is important in connection with the later series of Itza rulers ofTayasal in Lake Petén Itzá, all of whom held that title in the early Colo-nial period.Ucanal Stela 3 is the northernmost of three monuments erected in asmall stela plaza, Plaza H, on the west side of Structure A-26, a largeplatform at the south end of the central or main plaza of the site.

In-deed, some archaeologists continue to oppose the notion of foreigners inthe area at all. On closer analysis, some of these elements appear to bemost closely related to monuments in the northern lowlands, especiallythose of the Puuc region, where the new Campeche and Palenque cal-endars came into use in the Late and Terminal Classic.The Puuc RegionuxmalThe Puuc region of Campeche and Yucatán ,in the northwestern cornerof the peninsula ,is characterized by fertile soils and low hills (puuk)ris-ing about 175 meters above the flat limestone plain. Uxmal and othercenters in the eastern Puuc region ,such as Sayil ,Kabah ,and Labná ,reached their florescence primarily in the Terminal Classic period ,750/800 –1000 (Carmean ,Dunning ,and Kowalski 2004). Neighboring “west-ern Puuc” sites such as Edzná ,Xcalumkin ,and Oxkintok peaked slightlyearlier ,have fewer carved monuments ,and lack the elaborate mosaic fa-cades of sites to the east (Andrews and Andrews 1980 : 300). TerminalClassic stelae in this northern area are distinctive because of their pro-portions (relatively tall compared to width) ,use of multiple registers(reminiscent of the layout of codices) ,decorated borders ,and pointed topsand truncated corners. In addition ,stelae in the northern lowlands arefrequently found at the termini of ,or otherwise associated with ,cause-ways. Like these other prominent Terminal Classic northern lowlandcities ,Uxmal lacks a true Emblem Glyph (Stuart and Houston 1994 : 5).According to the books of the chilam b’alams, Uxmal was establishedin a K’atun 2 Ajaw (a.d.731–751) by a Mexican group known as the Xiwor Tutul Xiw, part of migrations of Mexicans into the Maya lowlands be-ginning in a K’atun 8 Ajaw (672 – 692). The leader was Aj Kuy Tok’ Tu-tul Xiw, who supposedly reigned from K’atun 2 Ajaw (9.16.0.0.0, 751)through K’atun 10 Ajaw (10.5.0.0.0, 928). Aj Kuy Tok’ means “Lord ofthe Owl-Flint,” which is interpreted as referring to Teotihuacan con-nections (Schele and Mathews 1998 : 259). Uxmal appears to have beenthe “primate religious and political capital” in the Puuc area around a.d.1000 (Kowalski 1994 : 95; Carmean, Dunning, and Kowalski 2004). Acauseway links the site to two subsidiary sites, Nohpat and Kabah, andpossibly also to Hunto Chac (Kowalski 1994 : 113; Carmean, Dunning,and Kowalski 2004).Uxmal and its satellites exhibit typical Puuc-style architecture char-acterized by multiroom palaces with elaborate stone mosaic facades andvault stones. As at many Terminal Classic and Postclassic sites in the07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 221"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"222maya political sciencenorthern lowlands, the ceremonial precinct is surrounded by a wall. Oneunusual structure at Uxmal, the Adivino or Temple of the Magician, hasa substructure with an apsidal plan and two temple superstructures; it was built in four stages. Most of the constructions with carved dates were built at the beginning of the tenth century. For example, theballcourt has sequential days of 2 Ix 17 Pop (10.3.15.16.14; January 13,905) and 3 Men 18 Pop (10.3.15.16.15; January 14, 905) carved on twostone rings.Structures in the Nunnery Quadrangle are dated to sequential years:(10.3.17.12.1) 2 Imix 19 Kank’in (October 2, 906) and (10.3.18.9.12) 4 Eb’5 Kej (August 9, 907). The Nunnery Quadrangle can be recognized as acosmogram and a variant of Tikal’s twin-pyramid groups (Kowalski1994). The North Building, which sits on the highest elevation, repre-sents ancestors and “the sky”: the structure has thirteen doorways (re-calling the thirteen levels of heaven) and is decorated with muyal, orcloud symbols, and bicephalic serpents resembling the ceremonial barscarried by Classic rulers. It also has four elaborate mosaic masks ofstacked long-nosed deity heads and symbols recalling Mexican Tlaloc-year sign glyphs. The South Building has nine doorways, like the nine-doorway palaces of the twin-pyramid complexes (nine levels of the Un-derworld and lords of the night), and thus has Underworld associations.It sits at the lowest level of the Nunnery complex, and its central door-way and southern stair access are aligned with the ballcourt to thesouth. The flanking East and West Buildings sit on the same, intermedi-ate level between those to the north and south.

Questions have revolved around the sequencing versuscontemporaneity of these architectural and ceramic styles and the kindand degree of “Mexican” influence versus autochthonous developmentin the region, particularly in terms of sociopolitical relations.Early archaeological work, especially the investigations at Chich’enItza by the Carnegie Institution of Washington under the direction ofSylvanus Morley, led to the interpretation that around 450 – 600, duringthe late Early Classic (Early Period I or Regional period, as it was vari-ously called in the northern lowlands), a distinctive culture developed inthe Puuc, Río Bec, and Chenes areas of Campeche and spread northward(Morley and Brainerd 1956 : 42 – 43). This culture flourished particularlyin the Puuc region of the northwestern peninsula and east to Chich’enItza during the Late and Terminal Classic periods (also known as EarlyPeriod II, Florescent, or Pure Florescent), and was identified by thespread of the Cehpech ceramic complex (Smith 1971). This culture cameto an end with the postulated Toltec conquest of the northern lowlandsand establishment of a capital of sorts at Chich’en Itza. This Early Post-classic period, from about 1000 to 1200 (known as the Early Mexican orModified Florescent period), saw the spread of Toltec influence through-out the peninsula and is recognized by pottery of the Sotuta ceramiccomplex.Since the late 1970s, however, this unilinear scenario has been ques-tioned by Joseph W. Ball (1977, 1979a, 1979b), and he and other archae-ologists began to debate models postulating various degrees of overlap ofthe Cehpech and Sotuta ceramic spheres, since their constituent ce-ramics had not been found in clear stratigraphic relationship. Today,most archaeologists working in the northern lowlands have come to rec-ognize a complex situation that includes earlier development of thecharacteristic slatewares of the Puuc Cehpech sphere, an eastern sub-sphere of Cehpech centered around the site of Cobá, possible early and07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 226"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"new terminal classic mayrealms227late faceting of the Sotuta complex (Cobos 2004), and considerable tem-poral overlap of the Cehpech and Sotuta spheres (Ringle et al. 2004).Chich’en Itza, in the north-central Yucatán peninsula, is well knownfrom Maya histories, legends, and early explorers’ reports. Despite Mor-ley’s excavations in the 1940s, this primarily Terminal Classic site re-mains poorly understood. Chich’en Itza did not deploy a traditional Em-blem Glyph with a place-identifying main sign; instead, the site usedonly the k’ul ajaw label for its principal lords (Stuart and Houston1994 : 5).The founding of Chich’en Itza —chi ch’en its a‘mouth of the well ofthe itsa [water witches]’ (Edmonson 1982 : 5)— is reported in numeroussources, and the various books of the chilam b’alams suggest that thecity seated the mayat least twice. According to The Chilam Balam ofTizimin,the city was founded in a K’atun 8 Ajaw (692, 948) and was siyajkan ‘born of heaven’, that is, a seat of the maycycle (Edmonson 1982 : 5–6). The Chilam Balam of Chumayelstates that Chich’en Itza was “dis-covered” in a K’atun 4 Ajaw (731, 987) by the calling together of “thefour divisions of the nation,” and the site’s occupants — the Itza — ruledfor thirteen k’atuns (Roys [1933] 1967 : 139 –140), again indicating itsrole as maycycle seat. According to Landa (Tozzer 1941 : 177; Schele andMathews 1998 : 197), Chich’en Itza was founded by three brothers,K’ak’upacal (Kelley 1968a), Aj Joltun B’alam, and Jun Pik Tok’. The ball-court disk from Chich’en Itza refers to an “Aj Joltun Balam, Peten, Itza-mal Ajaw” (Krochock 1997), reinforcing suggestions of relations be-tween the Itza and the Petén area.Despite the multiple sources of information on Chich’en Itza, the siteand its history have remained enigmatic to generations of archaeolo-gists. A considerable part of the problem was what seemed to be two se-quential and spatially distinct architectural components of the site,Maya and “Toltec,” which were originally interpreted as evidence ofconquest of the Maya by central Mexicans. Normal kinds of clarifyingevidence for such an interpretation were lacking, however. Ceramiccomplexes associated with these architectural styles, at Chich’en Itzaitself and at contemporaneous sites elsewhere in the northern lowlands,have rarely been found in clear stratigraphic association. Dated inscrip-tions are rare, difficult to read, and fall into a very narrow time range. In the past ten years or so there has been considerable progress in un-tangling these complexities: it is agreed that the ceramic and architec-tural components overlap in time, but the exact degreeof overlap is stilldebated.The central ceremonial precinct of Chich’en Itza (Fig. 7.14) is dividedinto two walled portions, northeastern and southwestern, each with a07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 227"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"228maya political sciencefigure7.14 Map of the central ceremonial portion of Chich’en Itza.mix of shared and unique structural forms. The southwestern sector hasnumerous structures with indigenous Maya characteristics, particularlymosaic facades like those of the Puuc area to the west. These include LasMonjas and the Casa Colorada, both with associated ballcourts, and theAk’ab Tz’ib. The Caracol is the earliest of numerous radial structures atthe site and topped by a circular “observatory” building, entered fromthe west. The High Priest’s Grave, another radial structure, is set on aplatform at the junction of three causeways.The northeastern portion of the site has structures that are in someways similar to (but larger than) those to the southwest, including radialtemples (the Castillo and the Venus platform) and ballcourts. Otherstructures and layouts in this precinct bear a striking resemblance tothose of the highland Mexican site of Tula, capital of the Toltecs. These07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 228"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"new terminal classic mayrealms229include the colonnaded Temple of the Tables, the Temple of the Warriors(which combines Puuc vault stones with talud-tablero platform facings),and the Group of the Thousand Columns, as well as abundant featheredserpent iconography.The most studied portion of Chich’en Itza is the Great BallcourtComplex on the western side of the northern precinct. This ballcourt isthe largest known in the Maya lowlands, and the complex has fourtemple structures. Two lie on the north and south end zones, facingdown center court; the North Temple has three doorways, the SouthTemple seven. According to Schele and Mathews (1998 : 207), “[T]hesetwo buildings carry relief murals that apply Creation imagery to the twocritical domains of statecraft — the sacred art of warfare and sacrifice,and the role of the ballgame in the passage of authority from generationto generation through rites of accession.”The Upper and Lower Temples of the Jaguar, situated on the easternwall of the ballcourt, are extravagantly embellished with relief carvings.The Lower Temple of the Jaguar is entered at ground level, from the east,and its reliefs, in five registers, show a procession of warriors approach-ing a figure dressed in ballgame garb (Wren 1991 : 53). The Upper Templeof the Jaguar, facing west and accessed from atop the eastern wall of thecourt, also appears to be dominated by warrior imagery. One muralscene illustrates the “conquest” of a village that Miller (1977) believesmay be in Petén.Of particular interest is the “Atlantean Altar” in the front (west)room of the Upper Temple of the Jaguar. This is a flat, carved table-top held up by fifteen “Atlantean” figures — actually carved stone pairsof human legs disjoined from the torso at the hips and buttocks —decorated so that the loincloths appear to represent sumptuously cos-tumed individuals (Fig. 7.15). The distinctive costuming of each of thesefigures is reminiscent of Structure 10L-22A at Copán, the popol naj withportrayals of its local rulers, and perhaps also the frieze of Seibal’s Struc-ture A-3, with twelve individuals. Schele and Mathews (1998 : 243) in-terpret these fifteen figures as b’akab’s who “represent a set of specificoffices and ritual functions in the Itza state” and as “office-holders whowere part of the council that ruled their kingdom.” More precisely, thesefigures are k’atun lords, the heads of lineages or rulers of individualk’atun seats within Chich’en Itza’s maycycle seating. The presence offifteen of these figures approximates the sixteen lineages and regionsthat formed the later multepal (rule by council, or confederacy) govern-ment of Late Postclassic Mayapán. It may be that such a political struc-ture had its origins at Chich’en Itza during the Terminal Classic (see alsoKowalski 1994 : 117).07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 229"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"230maya political sciencefigure7.15 The “Atlantean” figures supporting the altar top in the west room ofthe Upper Temple of the Jaguar in the Great Ballcourt Complex at Chich’en Itza (after Schele and Mathews 1998 : Fig. 6.39).Chich’en Itza’s Great Ballcourt Complex dates to the early TerminalClassic period (Wren and Schmidt 1991). This determination is based inpart on the Great Ballcourt Stone, which has a Calendar Round date of11 Kimi 14 Pax, probably indicating 10.1.15.3.6 (November 15, 864)(Wren 1991 : 53, 56). The text on the stone also has a ballgame glyph andperhaps the name of K’ak’upacal, and Wren (1991) believes the monu-ment was probably used as an altar on which to spread victims for heartsacrifices.I suspect that the building of thirteen ballcourts at Chich’en Itza was07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 230"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"new terminal classic mayrealms231a consequence of that site seating the mayin the Terminal Classic. Oneballcourt would have been built at the site to commemorate everyk’atun in the thirteen-k’atun cycle of the may.The wide occurrence ofballcourts in the western peninsula (but comparative rarity in the east-ern part; see Kurjack, Maldonado, and Robertson 1991) might then markthe site of k’atun seats within Chich’en Itza’s Terminal Classic maypolity. This practice would represent continuities with the Preclassicimportance of the ballgame (some twenty-five Middle and Late Preclas-sic ballcourts are known in the northwestern corner of the peninsula; A. Andrews, pers. comm., August 14, 2002), as well as with centralPetén. In central Petén during the Preclassic and Classic periods, dis-tinctive structural complexes —E-Groups and twin-pyramid groups —were built at mayseats and their subordinate centers for the purpose ofcommemorating k’atun terminations every twenty years. These com-plexes often have ballcourts adjacent or nearby (Aimers 1993).It is now widely agreed that Chich’en Itza had strong ties to centralPetén and the Itza homeland (Wren and Schmidt 1991; Krochok and Frei-del 1994 : 359; Boot 1995; Schele and Mathews 1998). The practice of cel-ebrating k’atuns with commemorative architecture, and also the role ofthe ceremonial ballgame, would have moved northward along with thePetén migrants. (In this regard, it is interesting to contemplate the sug-gestion [Laporte and Fialko 1990 : 57] that in Early Classic Tikal the ball-game was associated with a specific lineage or part of a lineage with cen-tral Mexican affiliations occupying Group 6C-XVI.) It is important tonote, however, that few dates at Chich’en Itza record period endings.Indeed, inscriptions and dates have posed problems for interpret-ing the history of Chich’en Itza and resolving long-standing questionsabout Maya-“Toltec” overlap. The earliest inscribed date at the city is9.2.10.0.0 3 Ajaw 8 K’umk’u; this date, found in the Temple of the Ini-tial Series, registers the midpoint or lajuntun ending of 485 within aK’atun 2 Ajaw. It would seem to correspond to some other early dates inthe western peninsula and the Puuc area (e.g., Oxkintok’s Lintel 1 dat-ing ten years earlier). The means of six calibrated radiocarbon dates fromthe site fall between 663 and 891 (Krochok 1998 : 5), again supporting anoccupation dating from the beginning of the Late Classic period.But structures of the Terminal Classic period, which saw Chich’enItza’s major expansion of construction and occupation, do not displayperiod-ending dates. The site’s dated inscriptions do not occur on stelae,commemorate k’atun intervals, or celebrate dynastic rule or individualrulers with dates of their birth, accession, and death (Wren and Schmidt1991 : 212), as in central Petén. Instead, the most commonly celebratedevent at Chich’en Itzá is the “lintel dedication ceremony” (Kelley 1982;Wren and Schmidt 1991 : 213). The texts of Chich’en Itza, unlike those07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 231"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"232maya political scienceof the southern lowlands, appear principally to record ceremonies dedi-cating structures and the lintels seem to be “owned” by individuals (Kel-ley 1982; Krochock 1991 : 49). K’ak’upakal, the most frequently namedperson on the lintels, is “never named in direct association with thetranscribing or carving of the lintels or the dedication of the temples. Hedoes seem to be mentioned in association with the playing of the ballgame,” however, and his parents are identified as “Lady K’uk’ and Jaw-bone-Longbone” on the Las Monjas lintels (Wren and Schmidt 1991 :213; Kelley 1962, 1968a, 1982).Inscribed dates at Chich’en Itza are found within a relatively narrowinterval. Wren (1991 : 56) writes that “virtually all the dated inscriptionsat Chichén Itzá fall within a forty-year period” between 866 and 906(10.1.17.5.13 and 10.3.8.14.4). Others have noted that carved inscrip-tions occur primarily and earliest in buildings with Puuc-style architec-ture, dating from 800 to 948. More specifically, however, inscribedglyphic dates span a period from 832 (Temple of the Hieroglyphic Jambs)to 998 (the High Priest’s Grave, a radial structure in the southern cere-monial precinct). This latter date is one year after the lajuntun ending of997, at 10.8.10.0.0 3 Ajaw 3 Pax. Despite this relatively brief series ofTerminal Classic dates, it is clear that the site was occupied far longerthan they would allow, and the Chich’en-related Sotuta ceramic spherelasts two and a half centuries (Cobos 2004).Archaeologists, art historians, and epigraphers working with theChich’en Itza materials have concluded that the site sat at the head of amultiethnic, multepal– like polity with elements drawn from many ar-eas of Mesoamerica, Maya and non-Maya. The lords of Chich’en Itzawere known and identified themselves as Itza, an ethnic group or line-age traceable to Classic period central Petén. The lack of stelae, period-ending inscriptions, and genealogical information, however, suggeststhat these Itza — in Petén and in the north —were a faction opposed tothe k’atun-based political traditions and practices of the ruling dynastyof Tikal and allied sites. Instead, the emphasis on mural art and carvedlintels suggests a cultural heritage in the Late Classic traditions of theUsumacinta area in the southwestern lowlands, for example, at Palen-que, Bonampak, and Yaxchilán, where lintels were extremely importantvehicles for royal inscriptions. Yaxchilán, possibly a Classic mayseat inthe middle Usumacinta region, had fifty-eight carved stone lintels and,on Structure 33, thirteen ballgame-scene panels. The presence of mosaicfacades is clearly a component of the local tradition of the neighboringPuuc area to the west, which in turn has a history of relations with cen-tral Petén.The real innovation at Chich’en Itza is the emphasis on ballcourts,possibly as k’atun-commemorating complexes, which have a long his-07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 232"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"new terminal classic mayrealms233tory extending throughout the western part of the peninsula. Whilemany if not most large sites in the southern lowlands had at least one ballcourt, I know of none with as many as Chich’en Itza. The onlysites that approach this number of ballcourts are Kaminaljuyú in theGuatemala highlands, with twelve (Middle and Late Classic, ca. 400 –700), and El Tajín in north-central Veracruz, with eleven. Of the latter,four date to the Early Classic (beginning ca. 300 – 400), five to the LateClassic, and two to the Epiclassic (ca. 900 –1000) (Wilkerson 1991 : 50).Like most Classic period Mexican sites, El Tajín did not celebrate k’atunendings but rather 52-year Calendar Rounds, and the beginning of newRounds conceivably could have been celebrated by construction of ball-courts and play of the game. A Totonac calendar initiated in 456 (Ed-monson 1988 : 130) might have marked the commencement of such apractice; if so, eleven ballcourts constructed every fifty-two years begin-ning in a.d.456 would take us close to the year 1000. In any event, theshared emphasis on the ballgame between El Tajín and the western pen-insula is significant in light of the widely acknowledged similarities ofballgame paraphernalia at Chich’en Itza and the Gulf Coast, plus Tajín-style architecture elsewhere in the lowlands (e.g., Tikal), and the leg-endary arrival of the “Mexican” Tutul Xiw peoples in the Maya area inthe Terminal Classic.Another innovation — or perhaps better said, a renewed emphasis —at Chich’en Itza is fire ritual. Recent studies of that site’s inscriptionsand iconography have revealed that a common royal title at Chich’enItza was yajaw k’ak‘lord of the fire’ (Grube 1994 : 9). Texts on severalbuildings, for example, the Casa Colorada, describe the drilling of sacredfires (Grube 1994 : 9). Fire drilling was also a popular theme in the ico-nography of Naranjo (Martin and Grube 2000 : 70). The significance offire ritual among the Maya, particularly its association with calendricalritual, is explored further in Chapter 8.To summarize Chich’en Itza’s seating of the may,Edmonson earlier(1979 : 15–16) postulated that Chich’en Itza seated the cycle in 692(9.13.0.0.0) and again in 948 (10.6.0.0.0), the former date according wellwith the span of radiocarbon dates for the site. a.d.692 is also the dateof inauguration of Dzibilchaltún as a mayseat (see below). Dzibilchal-tún seems to have been the formal seat during the first half of this pe-riod, erecting numerous period-ending monuments, whereas Chich’enItza appears to have been the incoming seat or “guest.” Chich’en Itzawould have celebrated its role in k’atun celebrations in the latter half ofthe Terminal Classic cycle seating, beginning in about 820, with a flurryof construction of ballcourts and temples with inscribed, dated lintels.By 948, the occasion for a new mayseating, however, there is little tosuggest that Chich’en Itza held much prominence except for the 99807-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 233"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"234maya political sciencedate on a column of the Temple of the High Priest’s Grave. While thechronicles suggest the site was renewed as cycle seat for another256 years, until the next K’atun 8 Ajaw in 1204 and the primacy ofMayapán, there is little confirmatory evidence from archaeology, epig-raphy, or ceramics. However, Chich’en Itza was a pilgrimage sitethrough the Late Postclassic period, suggesting an important continuingritual role.Dzibilchaltún and CobáDzibilchaltún is a large city in the far north-northwestern part of theYucatán peninsula, north of Mérida and only 20 kilometers from thecoast (Andrews 1981). Its program of public architecture, like that ofnearby Komchen, began in the Middle Preclassic, circa 800 b.c.and con-tinued through the Late Preclassic, until circa a.d.250. During thistime, both sites could have been mayseats in the region, with Dzi-bilchaltún seemingly more important in the late Middle Preclassic andKomchen flourishing in the early Late Preclassic, from circa 400 –300b.c.to a.d.150 (Andrews 1981 : 320 –321). Both sites share some Pre-classic ceramic ties to the southern lowlands, but they lack triadicgroups and Komchen is not known to have an E-Group. Dzibilchaltúnwas nearly abandoned in the Early Classic but then heavily reoccupiedin the Late Classic and Terminal Classic, from around 700 to 1000. Atthat time, its population is estimated to have been as large as twentythousand. Dzibilchaltún has some 7,500 structures, including 4 majorradial structures and 25 monuments. Stela 9 is the only k’atun-endingmonument, with a date of 10.1.0.0.0 (849).One of the important architectural complexes of Dzibilchaltún’s LateClassic resurgence is the “Seven Dolls” Group (Fig. 7.16). This complexis identified by its principal building, radial Structure 1-sub and its four-doorway superstructure, known as the House (or Temple) of the SevenDolls after the seven Postclassic figurines found in a cache in the struc-ture. This temple sits just east of a distinctive arrangement consisting ofthree range-type structures on separate platforms in a north-south line,with a low radial “stela platform” west of them in the center of theplaza. This entire complex lies at the eastern end of a 2-kilometer-longcauseway, with a similar group at the western terminus.

Substantial architectural similarities between Dzibilchaltúnand various sites in Petén supplement the iconographic evidence fromstelae, lintels, and other sculptured and painted surfaces in the northernlowlands. For example, there are general architectural ties to contempo-raneous Palenque, including standardized spaces, masonry style, andother features (Andrews 1981 : 330), as well as basal water friezes (Cog-gins 1983 : 50 –52).

The largest of these, Structure 89, is the latest at the site andsits at the western end of Sacbe 6. The two at either end of the longcauseway, particularly the Temple of the Dolls itself, recall Structure A-3 at Seibal and its five carved stelae apparently celebrating a gatheringof lords from four sites. Monuments in the Temple of the Dolls complexat Dzibilchaltún are arranged differently from those at Seibal, however:four stelae and one altar were placed along the centerline of the Templeof the Dolls complex. These include Stelae 1 and 2 in front (west) of thetemple, Altar 1 in front of the central of three structures to its west, andStela 3 atop the small radial platform comprising the western structureof the E-Group.If Dzibilchaltún flourished as a Late and Terminal Classic center inthe northern lowlands between 700 and 1000, this would appear to ac-company a seating of the mayin the K’atun 8 Ajaw of 692 and lastinguntil 948. It is more likely, however, that Dzibilchaltún served its firstterm as a formal mayseat from 692 to 830, during which time Chich’enItza was ascendant as the “guest,” or incoming, seat and succeeded asmay kufrom 830 to 948. According to the model advanced here (seeTable 4.3), the geopolitical sequence of mayseatings involves 128-yearintervals of incoming and outgoing centers. This means that if Dzi-bilchaltún were the principal seat of the mayfor 128 years beginning in692, its role would actually have begun 128 years earlier, in 564. At thattime the site would have been the guest of some other, then-currentmay ku.It is difficult to identify such a potential senior site outside ofthe southern lowlands at this time, although possibilities are Oxkintok(with heavy Petén influence beginning in the fifth century; see Coggins1983 : 39) and Uxmal or Cobá.Cobá sits among five small lakes some 100 kilometers east-southeastof Chich’en Itza in Quintana Roo (see Folan, Kintz, and Fletcher 1983;Andrews and Robles 1985; Robles and Andrews 1986) and covers morethan 70 km2. It had sixteen causeways, or sacbes, connecting to its satel-lites (probable k’atun seats), the longest of which extends from the Ter-minal Classic Nohoch Mul architectural complex more than 100 kilo-meters west to Yaxuná.

During the Early and Late Classic, the site and the eastern penin-sula in general had close affinities with central Petén, as evidenced byPetén-style architecture, ceramics, and sculpture (Robles and Andrews1986 : 77). It has been suggested (Schele and Mathews 1998 : 202) thatCobá might have been part of the Calakmul hegemony. However,around a.d.750 Cobá’s ceramic assemblage changed with the introduc-tion of a slateware tradition similar to that of the Puuc area to the west,although Puuc-style architectural elements were not in evidence. Cobáis thought to have been the capital of a sphere or realm in the easternpeninsula from about 700 to 1200, perhaps in competition with that ofChich’en Itza (Andrews and Robles 1985). Around 1100, however, pub-lic works construction ceased and satellite sites at the sacbe terminiwere abandoned (Andrews and Robles 1985 : 71).Cobá has thirty-two known stelae, twenty-three of them sculptured.Nearly all datable monuments were erected in the seventh century(Folan 1983 : 81), with the earliest stela dedicated in 623 (9.9.10.0.0 2Ajaw 13 Pop) and the latest around 780.

In central Petén, long dominated by Tikal andits realm, the Terminal Classic period (820 – 948) represented the last oroutgoing half of Tikal’s mayseating that had begun in 692. It was es-sentially a dormant period when ritual responsibilities were shared withthe incoming seat of the cycle. Who was Tikal’s successor? It is notclear; Ixlú, Zacpetén, Tayasal, Flores, or Nixtun-Ch’ich’ all seem to belikely sites.In southwestern Petén, in the Pasión region, Seibal became a newmayseat in 761, with a new king inaugurated in 771. As indicated by radial Structure A-3, a major program of building and monumenterection was initiated in the early ninth century, probably in com-memoration of a meeting of kings, calendar priests, or sages to discusscalendrical matters and especially the turning of the b’ak’tun in10.0.0.0.0 (830).07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 237"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"238maya political scienceThe latest stelae at Seibal (and also Flores) are circa 10.3.0.0.0 (889).If we go back in time half a mayor 128 years from 889, we come to 761,and then another 128 years from 761 brings us to 633, the end of a K’atun1 Ajaw and the founding (in 623) of Dos Pilas to the south in the Petex-batún. Dos Pilas might have been a mayseat — or perhaps merely a pre-tender —unifying a number of sites in the Pasión-Petexbatún region un-til 761, at which time the site slipped from power. In any case, thereseems to have been a Late and Terminal Classic mayseating in south-western Petén that lasted at least 241 years and probably closer to 256,with Dos Pilas seating the cycle from 623/633 to 761 and Seibal from761 to 889.Seibal is one of numerous sites in the southern lowlands where Ter-minal Classic stelae and altars seem to celebrate the arrival of strangers,persons bringing with them distinct cultural elements that differed fromthose of the Classic period southern lowland Maya. These elements, in-cluding dress, weaponry, and glyph styles, become evident in the ico-nography and monuments beginning around 810 – 820 (9.19.0.0.0 or9.19.10.0.0) and continue through about 889 (10.3.0.0.0). The new “Mex-ican” (probably originating in the Gulf Coast) calendars are evident a bitearlier in the late sixteenth k’atun (767) in the Usumacinta region, andstill before (ca. 665) to the north in the Puuc area. In other words, who-ever these interlopers were, they initiated entry into the southern low-lands from the west (and/or north: Puuc) just a few k’atuns before theturning of the b’ak’tun at 10.0.0.0.0 (830). Note the similarity to eventssome four hundred years earlier, when an arrival of Mexicans in thesouthern lowlands occurred just before the turning of the b’ak’tun at9.0.0.0.0 (435).The seated figures shown conversing on the many southern lowlandTerminal Classic monuments are simply dressed, conspicuously devoidof kingly regalia and accoutrements of office, which suggests that the in-dividuals were not flaunting symbols of status and power. Conversationscenes also appear on Terminal Classic Fine Orange (Pabellon Molded-Carved type) pottery bowls and vases, perhaps vessels used for servingfood and beverages at such meetings. While captives continue to be de-picted on the monuments, they are seated rather than hog-tied and tram-pled under the king’s feet. The innovation of all-glyphic monuments ap-pears to accentuate the paramount interest at this time — the fact thatthese discussions were taking place, rather than the power and charismaof the individual speakers. The texts could very likely record decisiveoutcomes of these summit meetings.

Hofling, pers. comm., August 29, 2002). Similar movements towardshared government —variously referred to as “concilar,” “collective,” or“shared power”— can be found in the Terminal Classic northern low-lands (Carmean, Dunning, and Kowalski 2004; Ringle et al. 2004; Suhleret al. 2004).The occurrence of squared day glyph cartouches in the Petén area isanother indication of foreign (or at least nonsouthern lowland Maya) in-fluences. These glyphs occur on Seibal Stela 13 on a day 7 Muluk, onCalakmul Stela 86 (Graham 1990 : 63), and on Flores Stela 5. They alsoare found at three sites in the Tikal realm (Edmonson 1988 : 40): JimbalStelae 1 and 2, giving dates of 12 Chikchan, 13 Cimi, and 1 Manik, andEl Zapote Stela 5. In addition, Ucanal Stela 4 shows a scattering glyphon a period ending of 10.1.0.0.0 5 Ajaw 3 Kayab (September 5, 848), withsquared glyph cartouches reading 10 Imix 13 Eagle(?). This latter, “obvi-ously in a foreign writing system,” refers to the date of the Olmec yearbeginning forty days before the Tikal date and is “the closest thing wehave to a direct correlation of the Mayan calendar with any other nativesystem” (Edmonson 1988 : 40). Edmonson (1988 : 229 –230) believes thatthese “aberrant day glyphs” in square cartouches “are certainly notMayan” but Gulf Coast, most likely “Late Classic (and provincial)Olmec,” and accompanied the introduction of the so-called Campecheand Palenque calendars.The suggestion that foreigners coming into the Terminal Classic low-lands were from the Gulf Coast region has been argued as far back asThompson’s (1970) identification of them as “Putun.” Possibly Chontalspeakers, possibly with ties farther west into Mexico and particularly toEl Tajin, possibly the producers and traders of Fine Orange pottery, pos-sibly using the script and calendrics of the Late Classic Olmec region,possibly related to the introduction of the so-called Campeche calen-dar — these “possibles” are increasingly becoming “probables” as moreand more research is done.Seibal’s Structure A-3 and Stelae 8 –11 and 21 appear to record a re-gional assembly of lords similar to that reported in the prophetic histo-ries as having taken place earlier at Dzibilchaltún. Distinctive radialplatforms or temples, sometimes accompanied by equally distinctivestelae, are also seen at Dzibilchaltún (Temple of the Dolls), Copán (Str.10L-4 and Stela A), and Tayasal (Str. 123; Chase 1983). According to theBook of Chilam Balam of Chumayel,during the last tun of a K’atun 13Ajaw in 771, a high-level assembly took place at Ichkansiho (Dzi-bilchaltún), which included the lords of Mutul, Chich’en Itza, Dzibil-chaltún, Itzamal, Chable, and other towns (Schele and Mathews 1998 :259).

It also could have resulted in a decision aboutwhere to seat the mayat the close of the b’ak’tun.Copán Stela A and Seibal Stela 10 are often discussed together be-cause their texts mention the Emblem Glyphs of three other powerfulsites. These two monuments are also usefully considered in the contextof iconographic programs on other stelae erected in their vicinity. InCopán’s Great Plaza, for example, a stela series was erected by Waxakla-jun Ub’aj K’awil north of a radial structure. These begin with Stela F,showing the ruler in Bearded Jaguar costume and dated a.d.721, whilethree companion monuments mark the ending of K’atun 4 Ajaw tenyears later, in 731, or 9.15.0.0.0, the three-quarter-b’ak’tun mark. CopánStela H shows the ruler dressed as the Maize God, on Stela A he wears amat headdress and displays kan te,or World Tree symbolism, and StelaB shows earth monster symbolism. Similarly at Seibal, Stela 10 is one offour stelae dedicated in 849 commemorating the ending of the b’ak’tunin 830 and erected around a radial structure. On Stela 8 Wat’ul Chatel isdressed in Bearded Jaguar costuming, on Stela 9 he is dressed as theMaize God, on Stela 10 he wears a mat headdress identical to that onCopán Stela A, and on Stela 11 he wears a World Tree apron that sug-gests the kan te symbolism on Copán Stela A. The interval betweenCopán’s Stela F and Seibal Stelae 8 –11 is 128 years.Copán Stela A identifies three other sites (Tikal, Calakmul, andPalenque) and associates them with cardinal directions (or points of thesolar cycle) but gives no personal names; Seibal Stela 10 gives EmblemGlyphs of Tikal, Calakmul, and the Ik’ site (presumed to be Motul deSan José) and the personal names of individuals associated with thosesites but gives no directional or solar associations (other than the posi-tions of all four stelae around Str. A-3). The production of these monu-ments is also of interest, because it has been suggested that the Copánstelae might represent the work of two sculptors or workshops (Scheleand Mathews 1998 : 139). Similarly, the Seibal monuments might havebeen carved by different “master sculptors” (Graham 1990 : 25); Pros-kouriakoff (1993 : 181) suggests a stylistic relationship to the stelae ofMachaquilá, upriver. All in all, the stylistic sharing evident among thesemonuments at Copán and Seibal invokes key cosmic referents ratherthan mere artistic license, and the events they commemorate were suf-ficiently significant that the participants might have brought their ownmaster sculptors on the journeys with them.The gatherings at or commemorated by these buildings might havean analogy in Postclassic and Colonial period practice. In Colonial Yu-catán, for example, high-level meetings held among regional lords “re-affirmed the political legitimacy of the rulers . . .

Similarly, Edmonson notesthat the b’alam and his chilam were priests and sages with responsibil-ity for resolving any disagreements about calendrical matters. If theseconflicts could not be settled,a convocation of sages could be called. The authority of such ameeting appears to have exceeded that of the lord of the katun him-self, and, though it was largely confined to the religious sphere, itsability to concert calendrical changes had a sweeping impact on po-litical and economic affairs. (1982 : 31n483)It is likely that such meetings would have been called to deliberate theturning of the b’ak’tun, the selection of new mayseats, and similar mo-mentous events.Finally, accelerating conflict is apparent in the southern lowlandsduring the Late Classic period, and at least one — perhaps more — disaf-fected lineage or faction of elites existed within Tikal. One such groupin the Petexbatún, originally displaying the Tikal Emblem Glyph,changed its allegiance to Calakmul. Possibly other factions — leavingvoluntarily or being ousted; perhaps joined by like-minded groups fromother Petén sites — moved northward and were responsible for the intro-duction of Peténlike architectural and iconographic traits to the north-ern lowlands. Some of these are closely associated with may- andk’atun-based geopolitical organization in the lowlands, indicating thatsuch calendrical rituals and beliefs ostensibly traveled as well, either be-ing introduced or strengthened by a Petén-based population presence beginning perhaps in the sixth century or so. At the same time, it isequally obvious that other groups of people were moving in the oppositedirection, from the northern lowlands as well as the Gulf Coast intoPetén. Beginning later, perhaps around the completion of the b’ak’tun in830, such movements introduced new ideas, styles, and material goodsinto Petén, particularly in the western part of the region. These kinds of“foreign” intrusions and population movements might have been impli-cated in the wars and abandonments prompting construction of defen-sive barricades around some sites in the northern plains of Yucatán(Dahlin 2000).It is of no little interest to compare one obvious trait of TerminalClassic monuments — shape — in Tikal and the Puuc region. The monu-ments in the Puuc area, and the stelae in west-central Petén that sharesome Puuc traits, have narrow tops; the corners are often removed, cre-ating points. It could be that the sculptured monuments are modeled af-ter the painted end walls of corbel-vaulted structures, where the in-slanting walls of the vault cut off the upper corners of the scene.

Terminal Classic stelae at Tikal and other sites inits realm emphasized their upper portions, making them asymmetricaland wedge-shaped. The expanded upper area heralded deference to royalancestors, the Paddler Gods floating among serpentine clouds of copalsmoke and nearly dwarfing the ruler below. The new iconographic pro-gram of the Terminal Classic explicitly rejects such displays of kinglypower and dynastic glorification. Instead, the monuments seem to her-ald multepal by commemorating significant conversations and diplo-macy. Their presence in the Lake Petén Itzá region also bespeaks long-standing ties between this area and the Puuc – Chich’en Itza region tothe north.07-T2963 6/15/04 2:23 PM Page 242"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"chapter 8Implications of the MayModelThe Maya geopolitical organizational structure based on the maywouldhave had broad ramifications and implications for other major culturalinstitutions, including political economy, intra- and intersite relations,and various aspects of ritual.

If this is true, why is there no directmention of it in the inscriptions? Indeed, references to the mayin thesurviving texts of the late prophetic histories themselves are ratheroblique but were teased out by Edmonson (1979). Did the Colonial pe-riod Maya intentionally conceal this armature of their politico-ritual or-ganization from the Spaniards? Have we not yet deciphered the glyphsfor such organization in Classic period texts? Could it have been dis-cussed in the codices but, for whatever reason, not referenced in stonesculptures?The problem may lie in part in the unclear etymology of the wordmay,and it might have come to mean different things — or the cyclemight have been known by different terms — at different points duringthe two millennia that it was in operation. Textual references to mayare rare and shed little light on this institution as a mechanism of geo-political structuring.Because one of the meanings of the word mayrelates to deer hooves(Fig. 8.1), it is useful to investigate references to or depictions of deer andtheir hooves in the inscriptions.

The front of the headdress is decoratedwith the distinctive trapezoidal framework of the central Mexican yearsign. Both stelae commemorate a Venus event, presumably the success-ful war against Seibal. A deer hoof in a headdress also can be seen on arelief panel from Jonuta (Joyce 2000 : 126).As discussed below, deer hunting appears prominently in certain al-manacs of the Madrid Codex and is linked to tzolk’in-based Burner rit-uals (see von Nagy 1997; Vail 1997; Bricker 1997b). In the codex depic-tions of deer, the hooves are exaggeratedly large, but the significance ofthis is not clear other than the meaning of mayas “deer hoof.”Occurrences of deer hooves or foot and toe bones (metapodials andphalanges) in archaeological contexts are rarely noted. A comparison ofdeer parts represented at deposits at four sites in the northern lowlands(Carr 1996 : 255) indicated that 30 to 40 percent of the fragments repre-sent metapodials and phalanges. Deer toe bones were used by shamansin divining rituals and a cache of nineteen of them, “some worked,” wasfound in a burial at the Classic site of Holmul (Hamblin 1984 : 142). Inaddition, a deer metapodial bloodletter was found in a Middle Preclassiccache (Brown 1999). The hooves themselves are cartilage and not likelyto survive deposition; they are known to have been strung together asrattles among native North American groups. Perhaps the “rattle of thek’atun” mentioned in some prophetic histories could have been madefrom deer hooves.Calendrical Rituals Involving FireClassic inscriptions and Postclassic and Colonial period chronicles re-veal an impressive array of calendrical ceremonies carried out acrossMesoamerica, in addition to those associated with Maya period endings,and these could have played a role in political organization and thestructuring of geopolitical authority. Many of these involved the ritualstarting and quenching of fires in temples and other public structures.The ceremonial drilling of fire and iconographic portrayals of possiblefire drills as part of royal paraphernalia is known from Early Classicmonuments, as the knotted staffs held by rulers (see Figs. 4.8, 4.9) mightbe ornately embellished ceremonial fire drills.08-T2963 6/15/04 2:24 PM Page 245"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"246maya political scienceBurner RitualsSome of the scenes and inscriptions on Classic period stelae could cor-respond to Late Postclassic and Colonial Burner rituals known from thecodices, books of the chilam b’alams, and Landa’s writings. The Mayadivided their sacred 260-day calendar into four “burner periods,” with aBurner (Aj Tok) presiding over each. The Burners were like other quadri-partite gods in presiding over each of the cardinal directions. Eachburner period consisted of 65 days, subdivided into intervals of 20 days,20 days, 20 days, and 5 days (see Long 1923 : 174; Thompson 1960 : 99 –101; Bricker 1997a : 2 –3; Edmonson 1982 : 180 ,1986a : 125). The sequenceof ceremonies was centered on a day with the numerical prefix 4, and oc-curred with only four day names: Chikchan, Ok, Men, and Ajaw. In thiscomplicated ritual cycle, an “announcement” of the cycle was made, forexample, on a day 3 Chikchan, when the Burner “gets the fire” (u ch’ak’ak’). Twenty days later, on a day 10 Chikchan, the Burner begins thefire (u hopol u k’ak’); another twenty days after that is the day 4Chikchan, the key day of the ceremony, when the fire “runs” (y alcaba).After another twenty days, on a day 11 Chikchan, the fire is extin-guished (u tup k’ak’). Five days later is a day 3 Ok, when the cycle be-gins again for the series of Ok days and focused on 4 Ok, followed byMen days, and then Ajaw days.The Madrid Codex contains several almanacs (43b – c; 90a – 92a) withdates and iconography relating Burner ceremonies to deer-trapping anddeer-sacrificing activities, especially during the dry season (equivalentto February through May) (Vail 1997). In particular, an image of a deerstanding in a cenote with a 9 Men date may be associated with the tupk’ak, or fire quenching, ritual. According to Landa (Tozzer 1941 : 163),the rituals associated with Burner periods were carried out to ensuregood rains for their crops; in this context, the final ceremony of extin-guishing the fire is of interest. For this event, in the Maya month of Makthere was a festival celebrated by old men for the Chaks or rain gods:They hunted for all the animals and creatures of the field[,] . . . andthey came together with them in the court of the temple in whichthe Chacsand the priest took their places . . . each having a pitcherof water. . . . They placed in the middle a great faggot of dry stickstied together and set upright, and first burning some of their incensein the brazier they set fire to the sticks, and while they were burn-ing, they took out a great many of the hearts of the animals andbirds and threw them into the fire to burn. . . . When all the heartswere consumed, the Chacsextinguished the fire with the pitchersof water.

This sequence, three glyphs be-tween Glyph A and the ja’ab’ day, consists of the possessive u k’ak’ il‘his fire’ (T122 : 563a, k’ak‘fire’), preceded by the verb “to light,” “toburn,” or “to extinguish,” and followed by a god head (Fig. 8.2). On nineof the dated monuments and two of the undated ones the verb is a “handscattering fire” logograph that may be read as pu-kior puuk.“Scatter-ing” the fire might be a better interpretation of the third and most cen-tral of the Burner rituals, which has been translated variously as “runs”the fire or “gives the fire scope” (Thompson 1960 : 100). Clearly this latter refers to steps of the Burner rituals known from Postclassic andColonial sources.

The remainder occur on miscella-neous dates, while another six examples are undated. In terms of spe-cific days, the majority (n\u000424) of these rituals are associated with daysAjaw, which is one of the “official” Burner days.The spatial occurrence of these fire sequence, or Burner, expressionsis also of interest. With three exceptions, they do not occur at Classic re-gional capitals or mayseats such as Tikal or Copán; the exceptions areMotul de San José, Calakmul, and Palenque, with one occurrence each.Otherwise they are found in east-southeastern Petén and Belize, includ-ing Naranjo (with 6 examples), Pusilhá (5), Sacul (3), Ixkun (2), Nim LiPunit (2), Polol, La Milpa, Uxbenká, Itzan, Naachtun, and Xnaheb.Burners and fire-related ceremonies may have origins deep inMesoamerican prehistory. The Burner days (Chikchan, Ok, Men, Ajaw;or Snake, Dog, Eagle, Lord or Flower) are known as Type V yearbearersand were used only in the Olmec calendar (Edmonson 1988 : 21, 231). Al-though yearbearers changed several times during the course of Maya cal-endrical history, this particular set seems to have been retained and ven-erated via Burner ceremonies for more than two thousand years. Thatrituals involving fire and burning incense were important to Preclassicsocieties such as the Olmec and Izapa can be seen in their iconography,which shows people holding torches, sitting facing each other over a fireor incense burner, and so on.Possibly related to these ceremonies is the emphasis on fire ritual atTerminal Classic Chich’en Itza, where a royal title was yajaw k’ak‘lordof the fire’ (Grube 1994 : 9). While the same title is known from a text atPalenque (Martin and Grube 2000 : 173), at Chich’en it was among the“principal titles of the local nobility.” Texts on several buildings, for ex-ample the Casa Colorada, describe the drilling of sacred fires (ibid.). Inaddition, it has also been suggested that the structure known as theVenus Platform “commemorates a specific calendar ceremony aligningthe Maya and central Mexican calendars, referring to both the New FireCeremony and the end of the ninth bak’tun on the day 7 Ajaw” (Mil-brath 1999 : 187, citing Coggins and Drucker 1988 : 23).New Year’s CeremoniesThroughout Mesoamerica, the five days ending the solar year cycle —known as Wayeb’ among the Maya and as Nemontemi in central Mex-ico —were unlucky days in which there was uncertainty as to whetherthe sun would emerge from its Underworld journey to begin a new an-08-T2963 6/15/04 2:24 PM Page 248"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"implications of the maymodel249nual cycle. Best known from Aztec-Mexica ritual, the observances asso-ciated with the ending of the old year and beginning of the new includedthe quenching of all fires and ceremonial renewal of fire with first sight-ing of the rising sun: these are known as New Fire ceremonies. Theseceremonies enjoyed added significance every fifty-two years with thestart of a new Calendar Round, that is, the coincidence of days and num-bers of the 365-day ja’ab’ and the 260-day tzolk’in. At this juncture, itwould have been of paramount importance for priests to ensure the sun’sappearance after the five unlucky days. Thus New Year’s and other kindsof fire-related ceremonies were occasions of crucial kingly and priestlycelebrations and quite worthy of note on Classic monuments.In the Maya area, it has long been known that significant portions of the extant codices —Dresden pages 25–28 (see Fig. 1.2), Madridpages 34 –37, and Paris pages 19 –20 — treat ceremonies carried out at thestart of a new year (Thomas 1882; Seler 1904 : 26 –35; Thompson 1934,1972 : 89;). Bricker (1984, 1989) has woven evidence from ethnographic,ethnohistoric, codical, and Classic iconographic sources to postulatecontinuities of calendrical ritual celebrating New Year’s ceremonies be-tween the codex pages and certain of Tikal’s Late Classic monuments.In addition, half-year stations of the ja’ab’ have been recognized in thecodices, though not in the ethnohistoric literature, but it is not knownif these might have been commemorated in the Classic period (Vail1996 : 50).As discussed previously, the ruler portrayed on Late Classic k’atun-ending stelae in the Tikal area typically carries a ceremonial bar andwears a jaguar costume, suggesting a role similar to that of the Post-classic b’alam, or jaguar priest. Bricker focused on similarities between the striking imagery on Tikal Stelae 30, 21, 22, and 19 and the DresdenCodex New Year’s pages, but similar parallels can be drawn to theMadrid. Page 34a of the Madrid (Fig. 8.3) ,for example , depicts a scenewith the principal individual (the Kawak yearbearer or Pawajtun) clad ina jaguar pelt and headdress, carrying a staff, and performing the scatter-ing rite, with an ancestor in the upper left corner.It will be recalled that Tikal Stela 30 (see Fig. 5.4), at a.d.692 the ear-liest of these possible New Year celebratory monuments, shows theruler scattering, with a tripartite staff and a back ornament bearing aMaize deity mask, perhaps a reference to the burden of the Ix yearbearer(Bricker 1984 : 229, 1989 : 239). Tikal Stela 21 (see Fig. 5.7), dated 736,shows the ruler barefoot, scattering, carrying a ceremonial bar, andwearing an enormous back ornament displaying a head with a defleshedjaw. Tikal Stelae 22 (see Fig. 5.12) and 19, dated 771 and 790, respec-tively, are virtual copies of each other and show the ruler barefoot, scat-tering, carrying a tripartite bar, wearing a jaguar pelt kilt and a Venus08-T2963 6/15/04 2:24 PM Page 249"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"250maya political sciencefigure8.3 Main scene of the upper portion of Madrid Codex page 34a (after Villa-corta and Villacorta 1976 : 292) includes the almanac for the Kawak yearbearer. Inone interpretation (Vail 1996 : 176 –177) this is seen as a black-painted Pawajtun,holding a digging stick and planting seeds of corn. I would see it in terms of LateClassic Tikal k’atun-ending stelae, showing the ruler or jaguar priest (note jaguartail) scattering, with an “ancestor” figure (?) seated in the “sky” above. This figuremay be a Postclassic conflation of the Paddlers, as the figure has a jaguar ear andwhat might be a stingray spine (?) in the forehead and is depicted in a blue-paintedcartouche surrounded by dots of “divinity.”mask, and with the same death god(?) mask in his back ornament asshown on Stela 21.The principal argument against seeing these Late Classic monumentsas depicting annual yearbearer rituals is that the yearbearers of the Clas-sic period were different from those in the Postclassic and Colonial pe-riods. Ix, Kawak, and Muluk are yearbearers in the Madrid Codex and inthe Late Postclassic and Colonial periods, but the yearbearers of LateClassic Tikal were Ik’, Manik’, Eb’, and Kab’an.

An enormous pile of wood, about 25 feetsquare and 6 feet high, was burned and then the coals were spread. Justbefore dawn the chief priest and his assistant sprinkled balche’ aroundthe edges of the embers, then the priest removed his sandals and walkedacross the hot coals, still sprinkling balche’, followed by the other par-ticipants (see Tozzer 1941 : 148 –149; Thompson 1960 : 100 –101). Landanoted that “some passed over [the coals] without harm, but others gotburned and still others were half burned up. And they believed that inthis was the remedy for their calamities and bad omens” (Tozzer1941 : 149). Thompson (1960 : 101) suggested fire walking as “the chiefceremony” of the Burners when “the fire spreads” on 4 Ajaw, 4 Chik-chan, 4 Ok, and 4 Men.The rulers on the three Tikal monuments described above are shownbarefoot, and Bricker (1984, 1989) posited a relationship to these fire-walking rites. The heads on the back ornaments worn by the rulers rep-resented gods associated with each of the four yearbearers, and the indi-viduals who walked the fire were the priests of those gods. Brickersuggested that the death mask in the ruler’s backrack represents a vic-tim of human sacrifice or, in the Postclassic and Colonial periods, thedeath god burden of Kawak years (1984 : 229; 1989 : 234, 237, 246). Intwentieth-century Chamula (Chiapas), a fire-walking rite continued toaccompany the start of Kawak years, with the priest sprinkling balche’on the coals. There are also resemblances to the Chamula “jaguar skindance” (Tzotzil ak’ot chilon), which is part of New Year’s rituals for Mu-luk (yearbearer) years, and also a military victory dance. In the jaguarskin dance, an official of the community dons a jaguar pelt and carries aberibboned staff or spear while he dances to the accompaniment ofdrums (Bricker 1979).It is entirely possible that through time certain rituals associatedwith New Year’s and k’atun-ending calendrical celebrations becamemodified, conflated, separated, or otherwise transformed from theirClassic origins to the Colonial period program. As Baudez (1991 : 87) re-marked, “even if [Tikal’s] twin-pyramid complexes were built for cele-brating katun endings, it is very possible that they were also used for08-T2963 6/15/04 2:24 PM Page 251"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"252maya political scienceNew Year ceremonies during the whole length of a particular katun.”Although there seems to be some discrepancy in the yearbearers de-picted on the Tikal monuments, the fact that the ruler is barefoot andscattering — perhaps balche’ or coals rather than blood — is suggestive offire-related rituals.Ballcourts and the BallgameOne of the most enduring icons, temporally and geographically, of theMesoamerican cosmovision is the ballgame. Known from the Early Pre-classic period through the twentieth century, and occurring outside theMesoamerican culture area proper from the southwestern United Statesinto the Caribbean (see Scarborough and Wilcox 1991), the ballgame and its courts of play served as ritual touchstones. Indeed, the ball-game has been posited as the basis for the earliest manifestations of“government” in Mesoamerica (Hill and Clark 2001). Although Meso-americanists speak of “the ballgame” as if it were everywhere identical,different rules and styles of courts existed in various times and places.There were also several game variants, including hip-ball, hand-ball, and stick ball, each with its own paraphernalia, equipment, and setting(Cohodas 1991).In the Maya area, the ballgame (pitz) and the ballcourt (hom;alsob’ate’) were long-sanctified elements of cosmic creation as revealed inthe Popol Vuh:the Hero Twins played in the aboveground ballcourt de-scribed as the “great abyss” to the northeast, as well as in the ballcourtof the Underworld with its associated “Place of Ballgame Sacrifice.” Thesignificance of the ballgame throughout Maya history is recognized ar-chaeologically through the construction of stone and plastered ball-courts with temples and sculptures, as well as depictions of the ball-game and its ceremonially attired players on stelae, wall panels, andceramics. Discussion of the role of the ballgame in the Maya area hastended to focus on the iconography as it relates to myth and astronom-ical correlations. But the ballgame also had an association with calen-drical ritual and political organization.A ballcourt dating to the Early Preclassic period has been identifiedat Paso de la Amada, Chiapas (Hill, Blake, and Clark 1998; Hill andClark 2001). Early Olmec chiefs were depicted as ballplayers or warriorswith insignia-bearing helmets on the colossal head sculptures (Clark1997 : 223; also Coe 1968; Taube 1992), and clay figurines of ballplayerswere abundant in the Olmec heartland in the Middle Preclassic (Coe andDiehl 1980) as well as in central Mexico (Tolstoy 1989). A tall stela fromthe site of Alvarado on the Gulf Coast shows an Olmec captive seatedbefore a ruler-ballplayer (Covarrubias 1966 : Fig. 29, cited in Coggins08-T2963 6/15/04 2:24 PM Page 252"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"implications of the maymodel2531996 : 27n30). It is not unlikely, then, that the Olmecs might have had acreation myth similar to, or the prototype of, the Maya creation epicPopul Vuh.Rulers-as-ballplayers were powerfully linked to cosmic cre-ation. In the Maya lowlands, perhaps the earliest known ballcourt wasidentified at Nakbe and dated circa 500 – 400 b.c.(Hansen 2000 : 5).Interpretations of the Maya-Mesoamerican ballgame (see Scarbor-ough and Wilcox 1991) focus on a wide range of possible ritual associa-tions: life, death, and rebirth; trials of the Hero Twins in the Underworld(see also Coe 1989); cyclical movements of celestial bodies; and symbolof, or portal to, the Underworld. Also, the ballcourt was seen as the set-ting of the “Third Creation.” Ashmore (1991, 1992) interprets the place-ment of ballcourts in a site’s overall layout in cosmological terms, as aliminal or transitional zone between north and south, between up anddown, and between celestial world and Underworld. Aimers (1993 : 179 –185, Table 3) noted that ballcourts are often located near E-Groups. Fox(1996) emphasizes the role of the ballgame as part of more complex “ex-tended ritual cycles.”The ballgame typically ended with the sacrifice (see, e.g., Wilkerson1991) by decapitation of one or more players, their death (and symbolicrebirth) standing as a metaphor for celestial and agricultural cycles. Thepresence of skull racks near ballcourts, for example, at Chich’en Itza andAztec Tenochtitlan, underscores the role of decapitation in these events.Similar fates seem to have befallen players — often kings — in the Clas-sic period. For example, in 738 Copán’s king Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awilcompleted construction of a ballcourt near his hieroglyphic stairway,then shortly thereafter he was “captured” by the ruler of Quiriguá.Quiriguá claims to have decapitated Waxaklajun, whereas Copán sayshe died in “battle” (Martin and Grube 2000 : 205). The likely subtexthere is that the rulers of the two cities engaged in a ballgame contest,which Waxaklajun lost in his home court, whereupon he was beheaded.Classic Maya ballgame iconography contributes numerous insightsinto the political significance of the ballgame in the lowlands. For ex-ample, there are two logographs for ballcourt, one showing a U-shapedcross section of a court and the other showing a staircase (Fig. 8.4a). Thisplus architectural evidence suggests that the game was played in twodistinct settings: one took place in a formal ballcourt (although there are virtually no images of this game), and the other — abundantly illus-trated in carved and painted media —was played on or near staircases(Miller and Houston 1987; Schele and Freidel 1991 : 290; Cohodas 1991:Fig. 14.1). The activities in these settings were probably sequential, witha contest or “game” played in a formal ballcourt followed by a deeplysymbolic ceremony — including sacrifice — played out against steps or astepped structure.08-T2963 6/15/04 2:24 PM Page 253"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"254maya political sciencefigure8.4 Glyphic signs for (a) ballcourts (Krochock and Freidel 1994; Fig.1; (b) “star war” events (after Harris and Stearns 1997 : 57).Related to this is a considerable body of iconography, beginning in theEarly Classic period (e.g., the Leiden Plate), depicting rulers standingwith bound, prone captives. In a study of such figures in Maya art, Dil-lon (1982 : 28) interpreted details of how captives are bound, suggestingthat the “reverse hog-tie”— prone and with hands tied behind theback— represents a prisoner who is either already dead and a trophy orabout to be executed. This position, however, suggests neither decapita-tion (typically a neck-baring kneeling position) nor heart removal(spread-eagled on the back).Instead, the “reverse hog-tie” displays a prisoner’s vulnerability priorto the second stage of the ballgame played on a staircase. Much of theiconography for this second phase of the ballgame can be found on Yax-chilán’s Structure 33, on a series of carved stone blocks making up Hi-eroglyphic Stair 2 on the structure’s plinth (see Schele and Miller1986 : 247; Christie 1995 : 207n5; Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993 : 356 –362). Here (Fig. 8.5), the staircase ballgame on Panels 7 and 8 is playedwith a ball that is actually a tightly bound human body — probably theloser of the contest played out in the court and thus a sacrificial vic-tim —with the king attired in ballplayer regalia overseeing the ritual.Images of the ball in the Yaxchilán and other staircase ballgamescenes show the glyph nab, na’ab,or naab’,prefixed by the numbers 9,12, 13, or 14. Na’ab is often translated “waterlily,” but it is difficult to accept that meaning in this context (Cohodas’s [1991] explanation is08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 254"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"figure8.5 Steps 7, 8, and 10 of Hieroglyphic Stair 2 on Yaxchilán’s Structure 33,showing the staircase version of the ballgame being played with a large “ball” thatis a tightly bound human body (after drawings by Ian Graham).08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 255"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"256maya political scienceunconvincing). Nab refers to “a measurement, the span of a hand” andnaab’ refers to a hand span measure of about 8 or 9 inches (Hofling andTesucun 1998). Perhaps the appearance of a number with this glyph onthe ball in the ballgame registers the size, and indirectly the weight, ofthe ball, hence the rigor of the game.The hog-tied captive image frequently appears on period-endingmonuments at Late and Terminal Classic Tikal and its realm, particu-larly in Tikal’s twin-pyramid complexes, strongly suggesting that thesecond or staircase version of the ballgame ritual took place in these assemblages. It was already thought that the captive on Altar 8 (seeFig. 5.11), paired with Stela 20 in Twin-Pyramid Complex P (3D-2; a.d.751), might be an individual who died in a ballgame and the rope-ringed altar itself represents a ball (Miller and Houston 1987 : 56; Scheleand Miller 1986 : 249). It appears, rather, that this altar displays the indi-vidual as he was trussed in preparation for the second phase of the ball-game, his body substituted for the ball in a ritual set against a stairway.Another example comes from the surviving text on the lower panelof Tikal Stela 21, which refers to the Tikal ruler as kalomte’. Both oc-currences of the kalomte’ glyph use the head variant, with ba’in theforehead and the expected te’postfix; ba’te’is a word for ballcourt. Theaccompanying Altar 9 shows a prone, bound captive from Calakmul.These monuments were found near Temple VI rather than in a twin-pyramid group, but as I suggested in Chapter 5, they might have beenmoved from one of the complexes.At Tikal, the twin-pyramid staircase ballgame probably would haveoccurred at the radial pyramid on the west side of the assemblage. Thisis suggested in part because the eastern structure had a row of stelae andaltars in front of it (although these could have been placed subsequently)but also because of the association of west with death. The prone, boundcaptives shown on stelae and altars in Tikal’s twin-pyramid groupswould be the vanquished lords of the preceding “real” ballgame, trussedto be used as the ball in the second stage of the ritual. Alternatively,prisoners of actual battles might have been expected to replay their de-feat in the cosmically symbolic theater of ballgame ritual. As noted inearlier chapters, the appearance of bound captives on period-endingmonuments at Tikal recalls the alternative meaning of k’atun as “com-bat, battle, warrior,” and underscores the popular interpretations of astrally sanctioned warfare in Late Classic Maya society. In addition, the text on Tikal Stela 16 in Twin-Pyramid Group N seems to indicatethat these assemblages were metaphorically the chasm and entrance to the Underworld, where the mythical ballgame was played by the Hero Twins.Tikal’s staircase version of the ballgame would have been very pub-08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 256"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"implications of the maymodel257lic. Eight of the nine twin-pyramid groups at Tikal are located close tocauseways (see Fig. 5.16). Similarly, Late Classic ballcourts in northernYucatán are typically situated at causeway termini (Ringle et al. 2004).This location hints that the activities occurring in twin-pyramid com-plexes and ballcourts involved ceremonial processions (see also Ash-more 1992 : 178). At Tikal, three twin-pyramid groups (complexes O, Q,R) are situated on an east-west axis bisected by the north-south MalerCauseway, and five lie at the ends of causeways (primarily the distalends; two are located at the north end of the Maler Causeway). It mayalso be significant that along Tikal’s Maler Causeway, extending north-south between two clusters of twin-pyramid groups (complexes M andP to the north; O, R, and Q to the south), there is a large (12’ \u000520’) LateClassic rock sculpture showing two bound captives, one seated and onestanding (Coe 1988 : 84). This sculpture records Tikal’s “overthrow” ofNaranjo in 744 (Grube 2000b : 261).There are additional architectural and other links between ballgameritual, k’atun celebrations, and twin-pyramid groups at Tikal. In themiddle seventh century Tikal’s largest ballcourt and “reviewing stand”(a radial temple), in the Gulf Coast (El Tajin) talud-tablero style, werebuilt in the East Plaza, east of the Main Plaza. The ballcourt was placeddirectly over the earliest twin-pyramid pair at the site, dating to theearly sixth century (Jones 1985 : 51). Thus the East Plaza area, at thesouthern terminus of the Maler Causeway and the northern terminus of the Méndez Causeway, could have been the stage of calendrical cere-monies for a century or more before the ballcourt and radial temple werebuilt.In any case, I believe twin-pyramid complexes in Late Classic Tikaland central Petén, beginning in the reign of Jasaw Kan K’awil and usedin k’atun-ending celebrations (and perhaps in New Year’s celebrations),were also associated with the second stage or staircase version of theballgame. If this is true, then there is a direct relationship between theballgame and period-endings as celebrated architecturally by the citiesseating the thirteen k’atuns and the 256-year may.Such a relationshipmight explain why there are thirteen panels depicting stairway ballgamescenes on the hieroglyphic step of Yaxchilán’s Structure 33. The dates onthese panels span the reigns of several rulers over possibly as many as128 years (half a may), indicating that the site’s scribes “were assem-bling on this step a history of famous game rituals performed in thecity” (Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993 : 357). More precisely, they wererecording period-ending ballgame rituals.Similarly, Seibal Structure A-10, the eastern structure of an E-Group,was a probable site of the stairway ballgame, as suggested by the imagesof ballplayers on “Stelae” 5 and 7, set on either side of the west-facing08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 257"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"258maya political sciencestairway. Christie (1995 : 171) suggests that the game was played againstthat stairway, and “the sacrificial victims used as balls were offered tothe outgoing or ‘dying’ k’atun” at the changeover of deities occurring onthe lajuntun 9.18.10.0.0 10 Ajaw 8 Zak (800). Finally, it is useful to re-call that thirteen ballcourts were constructed at Chich’en Itza. Other as-sociations among prisoners, ballgames, and stairways can be seen at DosPilas (Miller and Houston 1987 : 58), where the hieroglyphic stairs showballplayers on three risers; on one, two teams face each other across twolarge, tied bundles. At Dzibanché in Calakmul’s realm, carved stair ris-ers show bound prisoners, but there is no clear association with a ball-game (Martin and Grube 2000 : 103). And both El Tajin and Chich’en Itzaemphasize the skull, rather than the human body, as ball (see Gillespie1991 for discussion of the “Rolling Head” and celestial periodicities).Some intriguing but inconclusive evidence comes from epigraphy.The word b’aatmeans “ax,” and it is also at the root of b’a’te’el(orb’a’ate’el) ‘fight; war, combat’ and b’ate’‘ballcourt’. In addition, the titlekalomte’ (see Fig. 4.7) was formerly read as ‘b’atab’,perhaps “warrior”or “ax fighter.” As noted, some head variants of this glyph (new 1125;Ringle and Smith-Stark 1996 : 331), for example, on Tikal Stela 21,shows the head variant with ba’ in the forehead and a te’postfix, recall-ing b’ate’‘ballcourt’. This prompts speculation that the ax-in-hand ele-ment of this glyph might refer to the decapitation before the stairwayversion of ballgame.Finally, several pages of the Madrid Codex show decapitated humanbodies wrapped and bundled in a shroud, sometimes upside down andother times seated, in what might be an analogue to the bundling of sac-rificial victims into a ball for the staircase version of the ballgame.These Postclassic scenes, however, relate to sacrifices carried out duringthe Wayeb’ days and sacrifices as part of New Year’s ceremonies (Bricker1997b : 178).Maya “Warfare”The Classic Maya world was once romanticized as an idyllic tropicalgarden of peaceful farmers and benign philosopher-stargazers — theMesoamerican equivalent of the Old World humanistic Greeks vis-à-visthe militaristic Romanlike Aztecs (Spinden 1917). Today, however, theancient Maya are widely acknowledged to have been as inclined towardwarfare and human sacrifice as any premodern chiefdom or state soci-ety. This shift in scholarly thinking is a consequence of many factors,not the least of which are new hieroglyphic decipherments.

Rice n.d.c).There is little doubt that Classic lowland Maya polities sustainedvariable degrees of mutual hostility, but the extent, causes, and conse-quences are unclear. Interpretations of the nature and causes of hos-tilities range from highly materialist (population pressure, lack of re-sources) to highly ideological (celestial activity, particularly movementsof Venus). These conflictual relations often have been referred to as“warfare,” a term that, like “militarism,” carries heavy baggage (Web-ster 1976 : 815; 1977 : 363 –364; 1993; 1998): it implies substantial infra-structural investment and organization, including imperialist politics,territorial expansion, standing armies and supply systems, weaponrysystems, defensive fortifications, large-scale offensive operations oftenat long distance, conquest by force, destruction of enemies and property,tribute collection systems, and the ability to maintain control of the de-feated society. Yet, as Stuart (1995 : 293, 329) has pointed out for theMaya, “no event glyph is known that literally reads ‘to wage war’,” andtextual references do not exist until after the sixth century a.d.Ross Hassig’s (1992 : 70 – 81, 94 – 99) study of warfare in Mesoamericaprovides a measured overview of lowland Maya data. He notes thatamong the Classic Maya, warfare was primarily “aristocratic,” involv-ing small numbers of soldiers who were probably nobles (to judge fromtheir sumptuous attire), and highly individual or one-on-one, suggestedby hand-held rather than long-range weapons. True warfare would havebeen limited, he believes, by the tropical forest environment hinderingmassive troop movements, by the lack of easily portable foodstuffs (e.g.,tortillas), and by seasonal rainfall cycles making trails impassable formany months. In short, Hassig’s observations support the idea thatMaya warfare was primarily a matter of quick raids and highly symboliccombat intended for “internal political purposes, such as validatingrulers” through acquisition of captives, rather than territorial conquestto gain control over resources. Similarly, Culbert (1991c : 335–336), insummarizing the role of warfare in Maya political history, emphasizesthat most of the captives are unnamed or “unprovenienced” as to homesite, suggesting that they may not have been important individuals.Insights into Classic lowland Maya warfare come from Late Postclas-sic and early Colonial period northern Yucatán. Spanish chroniclers in-form us that conflict between towns in the region was relatively con-stant and pervasive. Landa reported “great strifes and enmities” amongthe major ruling lineages, along with a probably exaggerated reference tothe killing of 150,000 men in one unnamed battle and the Mayas’ legit-imate fears of capture, being sold into slavery, or sacrificed as a result of08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 259"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"260maya political sciencedefeat (Tozzer 1941 : 40 – 41, 217). Herrera (Tozzer 1941 : 217) also re-ported that after the battles with the Spaniards the Maya “were scat-tered. And their discords had increased so much that for any little causethey fought. . . . And so they never had peace, especially when the cul-tivation was over.”Landa (Tozzer 1941 : 113, 122n562) tells us that wars were led by thenakom, a war captain who was elected to office for three years. Soldiers,or jolkans,from each town were headed by its b’atab’, who led the war-riors into battle. The nakom, who ruled over the month Pax, was treatedalmost as a god and during his term of office largely withdrew from nor-mal life, having no contact whatsoever with women. All of this pointsto “the religious significance placed on warfare” by the Maya (Tozzer1941 : 123n563).The reasons for the unrest and skirmishing in postconquest Yucatánare not difficult to comprehend. Among the many causes that can beidentified (see Farriss 1984, 1987; Restall 1997; Roys [1943] 1972 : 65–70), some are specific to the Colonial circumstance and led to rebellionsagainst the new overlords: defense of traditional territorial boundaries;conversion to Christianity versus maintenance of traditional practice;onerous demands of tithes to the Church; labor and tribute payments toboth native lords and new Spanish encomenderos; forced resettlements(congregación) and crowding; voluntary flight from Spanish centers intothe hinterlands and mixing with long-established groups (Rice and Ricein press); elimination of traditional social and political authority struc-tures; and so on. These new elements were superimposed on historicaland internal events and practices, leading to rivalries between towns andlineages such as the taking of captives for sacrifice (nobles) or enslave-ment (commoners), access to or control of trade goods, and deeply rootedfeuds over perceived misdeeds, slights, and crimes.Carefully hidden from the Spanish rulers but subtly interwoven intothe native chronicles is another, deeper reason for some of the belliger-ence: long-standing antagonisms over specific calendrical matters. Ac-cording to Edmonson (1986a : 99), “katuns not only chronicled the warsof Yucatan but actually caused them.” During the Postclassic period,there was considerable inter “ethnic” disagreement between the Xiwand Itza about calendrical issues as well as competition between majortowns for the power and prestige of seating the k’atuns and the may.Inthis regard, it again bears recalling that while the word k’atunrefers toa period of 7,200 days, it is also a noun and verb meaning fight, combat,battle, war, or warrior. Numerous derivations also exist (Marcus1992a : 416): k’atun yajand k’atun chuk luum‘to conquer land’; ajk’atun‘warrior’; and k’atuntaj‘to fight with someone’, apparently re-ferring to one-on-one or hand-to-hand combat.

Indeed, the so-called k’atun wars (u k’atunk’atunob) were waged over the competing calendars, resulting in “a for-mal bifurcation of the politico-religious system” and adoption of a newcalendar in 1539 (Edmonson 1982 : xvi –xvii). But calendrical disputescontinued, with an attempted later resolution by means of the short-lived Valladolid calendar in 1752.The books of the chilam b’alams reveal the presence of numerousmilitary orders, among both nobles and peasantry, all given variousnicknames. For example, the pro-Xiw Chumayelmentions the Flags,Possums, Many Skunks, Hanging Rabbits, and Foxes as peasant ordersopposed to the nobility (Edmonson 1986a:209 –214). The pro-Itza Tiz-iminmentions the Snakes, Ants, Jaguars, and Silent Leopards, whosemembers were apparently pro-peasant, Christianized Xiw, as were prob-ably the Locusts, Monsters, and Chiggers, active around Merida in aK’atun 3 Ajaw (Edmonson 1982 : 37, 113 –114). Elsewhere, the StrongSkunks, Masked Deer, and Rabbits were described as being usurpers inthe land in a K’atun 7 Ajaw (ending a.d.1342, 1599) (Edmonson 1982 :62 – 63).These books also indicate that K’atuns 11 Ajaw were nicknamed the“flower k’atun,” alluding to the “Flowery Wars” (i.e., divine wars) ofAztec central Mexico. The year 1539, date of the calendrical compro-mise of the Itza and Xiw, was the transition from a K’atun 13 Ajaw to aK’atun 11 Ajaw. K’atuns 7 Ajaw also have associations with war and con-flict: in the TiziminK’atun 7 Ajaw is described as one of chaos, usurpa-tion, and “seven-day rule” (Edmonson 1982 : 62 – 63). In addition, the day1 Ajaw is also the preferred ending date of the idealized Venus cycle (Mil-brath 1999 : 170), with its association of star wars. Can the Colonial pe-riod prophetic histories be read to suggest k’atuns of conflict during theClassic period?Here it is useful to return to the discussion in Chapters 4 and 5 con-cerning Tikal’s mayseatings in the Middle and Late Classic periods.These seatings occurred at 256-year intervals in K’atuns 8 Ajaw, withthe kuch, or burden of office, being transferred at the lajuntun, or mid-point, of that k’atun. After their tenure as “guest,” Tikal and other citiesseating the mayhad different responsibilities during the first and lasthalves, 130 tuns or 128 years each, of their full cycle. It was proposedthat Middle Classic Tikal seated the mayat the midpoint of the K’atun8 Ajaw interval of 416 through 435, a lajuntun falling on a day 9 Ajaw 3Muwan (January 30, 426). Counting forward 128 years or half a maybrings us to the year 554, which is the ending of a K’atun 9 Ajaw and thebeginning of a K’atun 7 Ajaw. Similarly, Tikal’s Late Classic mayseat-ing began in the lajuntun of the K’atun 8 Ajaw dating from 672 to 692,08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 261"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"262maya political sciencewith the midpoint falling on a day 9 Ajaw 18 Sotz’ in 682. Counting for-ward 128 years brings us to 810, another year ending a K’atun 9 Ajaw andinitiating a K’atun 7 Ajaw.If this midpoint of the maymarked the start of competition for a newmayseat, or the point where an incoming mayseat had to display thatit was indeed “born of heaven” and sanctioned by cosmic authority, thenthis could account for K’atuns 7 Ajaw being k’atuns of competition, con-flict, and political chaos. In this light, it is perhaps significant that Cara-col’s “defeat” of Tikal in 562 occurred just before the midpoint of aK’atun 7 Ajaw. Likewise, the twenty-year interval from 810 to 830, of-ten taken as marking the end of the Late Classic or Terminal Classic occupation of the southern lowlands, is a K’atun 7 Ajaw, the k’atun ofpolitical competition and change.This leaves explanation of K’atun 1 Ajaw and its Venus-warfare asso-ciations. During the Early Classic period ,the k’atun ending of 8.17.0.0.01 Ajaw 8 Ch’en fell in 376 ,which was two years before the arrival of thecentral Mexican Siyaj K’ak’ and the putative introduction of Venus-Tlaloc war imagery into the Maya lowlands. In addition ,two star wars in-volving Calakmul-Caracol against Naranjo occurred around the end ofthe 9.10.0.0.0 K’atun 1 Ajaw ending in 633 ,one in 631 and another in 636.We know via the Dresden and Grolier codices that Venus and its observedmovements were carefully tracked by the Maya. Corrections given in theDresden allowed Venus’s movements to be tracked for 384 years beforenew reckonings had to be made (Sharer 1994 : 578 –579). An interval of384 years is ,of course ,128 + 256 years ,the full three phases of amaycy-cle. However ,there is virtually no direct mention of the planet or star intheChumayelorTizimin.This could be because the authors of thesebooks chose to be cryptic about matters of native cosmology. One alsowonders ,however ,if Venus’s importance was severely diminished by theLate Postclassic ,perhaps by the fact that warfare was increasingly fre-quent and “real” rather than largely symbolic or ritualized.It is appropriate here to return to consideration of representations ofcaptives on Classic period-ending monuments and their poses. As notedpreviously, prone and bound (hog-tied) captives were commonly de-picted on stelae and altars in Tikal’s twin-pyramid complexes, which Iassociate with the stair version of the ballgame. The pose is known fromEarly Classic times, but in the Late Classic it appears on monuments atsites more widely distributed in time and space (see Dillon 1982:Table 3). Of thirty-four occurrences, sixteen are on k’atun endings be-ginning in 9.10.0.0.0 (a.d.633, the ending of a K’atun 1 Ajaw), twelve onlajuntun endings beginning in 9.8.10.0.0, and four on jotun endings.This position continued to be used on k’atun-ending stelae throughTikal’s Stela 11, dating 10.2.0.0.0 (869).08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 262"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"implications of the maymodel263During the late Late Classic and Terminal Classic periods at Tikaland its realm, captives were somewhat more frequently depicted seatedand in multiples rather than as a single prone, bound individual. Thetransition began around 771, with Altar 10 in Twin-Pyramid Group Qshowing five captives, one prone and bound atop the altar and fourseated around its circumference. Altar 6 in Twin-Pyramid Group R,dated 790, shows five similarly posed captives. Several recently found(post-1982, date of Dillon’s tabulation) altars in the Petén lakes regiondepict seated captives but are not precisely dated; stylistically they con-form to very late Late Classic and Terminal Classic programs.Edmonson (1982 : 39n723) noted, without elaboration, that the half-cycle sequence of seven odd-numbered k’atuns —K’atuns 13 Ajaw, 11Ajaw, 9 Ajaw, 7 Ajaw, 5 Ajaw, 3 Ajaw, and 1 Ajaw — seems to have beena source of may-related conflict in Colonial period Yucatán. Perhapsthis is because the Xiw counted k’atuns on their terminal dates from 6Ajaw through 8 Ajaw, while the Itza counted them from their initialdates from 11 Ajaw through 13 Ajaw (Table 8.1). The origin of these dif-ferent dating systems can be traced to Early Classic Petén.

How-ever, Tikal’s traditional “enemy,” Calakmul, and its alliance partnerssuch as Caracol, seemed to gain power in K’atuns 2 Ajaw (which precedeK’atuns 13 Ajaw; see Table 3.4). For example, on the lajuntun ending ona day 9.9.10.0.0 2 Ajaw 13 Pop (a.d.623), Calakmul ended its hiatus anderected large numbers of stelae through the K’atun 2 Ajaw ending of9.16.0.0.0. Similarly, Caracol was particularly aggressive after the samelajuntun in 623. What was the origin of this alternative system?I believe the changed activity at these sites during this lajuntun couldrelate in part to the division of the b’ak’tun into quarters. For example,given the Maya fondness for quadripartition, I suspect — although I havenot accumulated evidence to satisfactorily demonstrate — that, just astwenty-year k’atuns are divided into four parts of five years each (jotun,lajuntun, jolajuntun), so might the twenty-k’atun b’ak’tun be dividedinto four parts of five, ten, and fifteen k’atuns. Thus the date 9.9.10.0.0,the lajuntun before the end of the first half of the b’ak’tun (at 9.10.0.0.0),might have been cause for some adjustments in prevailing politicalarrangements.With respect to the K’atun 2 Ajaw, I suspect the origin of its impor-tance can be traced to the Early Classic period and the presence of cen-tral Mexicans at Tikal. As I have argued above (Chap. 4) and elsewhere(Rice n.d.b), the much-discussed arrival of Teotihuacanos at Tikal on aday 11 Eb’ in a.d.378 has been accorded excessive importance to us to-day as a sudden and pivotal event in lowland history. But archaeologicalevidence indicates that central Mexican – style (talud-tablero) architec-ture was visible at central Tikal considerably earlier, beginning arounda.d.250. One apparent consequence of the a.d.378 arrival event was thedeath of the Tikal ruler Chak Tok Ich’ak, who, interestingly enough,might have been preceded by an earlier ruler by that name around 250and was followed by a later Chak Tok Ich’ak who died in 508. The dates250 to 378 to 508 represent periods of 128 and 130 years or, combined, a maycycle. Furthermore, the years 250 and 508 fall within K’atuns 13 Ajaw if the k’atuns are identified by their terminal day, or in K’atuns2 Ajaw if they are named by the alternative system, their initial day.By the middle to late fourth century, there seem to have been two dis-putatious elite lineage groups at Tikal, one representing the traditionalrule of the Jaguar Paw dynasty and the other having ties to central Mex-ico. The traditional rulers observed calendrico-cosmic cycling based onK’atuns 8 Ajaw, whereas the opposing faction observed those associatedwith K’atuns 13/2 Ajaw. While the Teotihuacan-supporting factionseems to be implicated in the events of 378, including the death of the ruler and the imposition of a stranger-king, succeeding rulers force-08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 264"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"implications of the maymodel265fully reasserted their connections with the names, symbols, and icono-graphic programs of their dynastic predecessors, including celebration ofK’atuns 8 Ajaw. This would suggest that the central Mexican – leaning,K’atun 13/2 Ajaw faction had diminished power and might have even-tually been ousted from Tikal. It is not difficult to imagine, then, thatthis disaffected group or groups opposed to the Jaguar Paw ruling linemight have retreated — sans Teotihuacanos — to Calakmul, where theyestablished, in effect, a center for alternative calendrics. Sometime dur-ing the sixth-century hiatus, if not before, proponents were able to ele-vate the importance of K’atun 13/2 Ajaw –based cycling, and thus inter-site conflicts escalated.That Tikal eventually won these disagreements, in some senses, isevidenced by the fact that there were no further battles with Caracol orCalakmul after Tikal “defeated” the latter site in 695, and the Tikal cal-endar continued in use into the Colonial period. Yet arguments aboutinitial versus terminal naming, and K’atun 8 Ajaw versus K’atun 13/2Ajaw cycling, continued to rage through the Postclassic period until thecalendrical compromise achieved in 1539.Dual RulershipIt is widely agreed among scholars that Classic kings were sacred, as indicated by their Emblem Glyph titles (holy [place] lord), and the ex-istence of a hierarchy of offices has recently gained considerable ac-ceptance. At the top of the hierarchy is the kalomte’ (T1030, previouslyread as chak’te’and b’atab’), who ruled over a large domain as a sort ofoverlord; this title “was of special importance and restricted to only thestrongest dynasties during the Classic proper” (Martin and Grube2000 : 17). Lomor kalommeans “warrior,” and a key element of most ofthe glyph T1030 variants is an upraised hand holding an ax. Below thekalomte’ is the ajaw (king, lord). Ajaws — sublords and local lords — mayreside at several towns under the hegemony of a kalomte’ and even inhis own city. Below ajaws are lesser lords or vassals known in some partsof the lowlands as sahals.There have been several recent suggestions that the Classic Mayamight have had dual rulers and diarchical political organization, an idearaised earlier by Thompson (1970 : 97). Such a diarchy might have in-volved corulers or divisions based on sacred/secular or internal/externalaffairs of various sorts. The best-known example of diarchy in Meso-america is that of the Late Postclassic Tenochca (Aztec) in central Mex-ico. There the tlatoani‘speaker’, who presided over a judicial body ofthirteen, plus himself, ruled jointly with the cihuacoatl‘serpent-woman’, who was also a military leader (Sahagun 1950 –1970, bk. 8 : 55;08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 265"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"266maya political scienceBerdan 1982), and they came from different family lines. The princi-pal temple of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, was likewise a dualtemple dedicated to their indigenous deity Huitzilopochtli and the long-standing central Mexican storm or war god, Tlaloc (Matos Moctezuma1987). Recently, it has also been suggested that the Toltecs too had adual government (Mastache and Cobean 2000 : 107).One basis for the suggestion of dual rulership among the Maya is kin-ship — the possible existence of moieties in lowland Maya social organi-zation, comparable to that in the highlands (Fox 1991), which would re-quire some mechanism for sharing governance and ritual. According toBecker (1983), early sociopolitical structure in the Maya lowlands mighthave been dominated by moieties. During the Preclassic period, theMaya were at a chiefdom level of organization, with “political” aspectsregulated by kin groups (moieties) having different responsibilities: onewas “charged with internal affairs (land use, personal conflicts) whilethe leader of the other group would handle external affairs (warfare, rit-ual)” (Becker 1983 : 161). Through time —by the Late Classic — this wastransformed by economic wealth into a more formal and less kinship-based, diarchical structure. Furthermore, “the divine origins of the dualrulers are clearly described in the Popol Vuhand other origin mythswhich reify the cognitive processes involved with this kind of politicalstructure” (Becker 1983 : 174).Another example comes from Viel (1999), who suggested dual ruler-ship at Late Classic Copán on the basis of the iconography of the pec-torals on the rulers portrayed on Altar Q and the Structure 11 Bench. Heproposes that “a diarchy was institutionalized in the eighth century thattook the form of a ruler/co-ruler (or heir apparent) system” (1999 : 388;see also Webster, Freter, and Gonlin 2000 : 178; Schele and Freidel1990 : 333 –334; Cheek 2003). Within this system at Copán, power wasshared between two corporate descent groups, one controlling the ap-pointment of four “ministers” or politico-religious officers and one con-trolling the four military officers, one of each for each of the four quar-ters. An “executive branch” consisting of the ruler, coruler, fourministers, and four war captains would have been advised by a councilof nine lords. His model is similar to that of the Aztec tlatoaniand cihuacoatl(Viel 1999 : 392; see also Edmonson 1979 : 11). The idea of acoruler or heir apparent at a site calls to mind the host-guest arrange-ment of k’atun lords and mayseats; also, the deer hoof or mayglyph hasbeen read as “heir apparent” (Montgomery 2001a : Fig. 9-3).Another line of reasoning for the suggestion of diarchy is morestrictly “political”: a functional division based on control of “internal,”primarily ritual, affairs versus authority for “external” or intersite af-fairs including diplomacy and conflict management. The possibility of08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 266"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"implications of the maymodel267dual rulership was raised by Coe (1965; also Thompson 1970 : 97), whocited Landa’s comments about the presence of two nakoms in ColonialYucatán. Landa had reported that the same term, “nakom,” was used torefer to two different offices and individuals: one nakom was an electedwar chief; the other was in charge of human sacrifices. From this, Coe(1965 : 103n2) proposed that “we have here a suggestion of dual organi-zation, contrasting military with religious office.”Subsequently, there have been suggestions of dual rulers in Uaxactún(Valdés and Fahsen 1995 : 205) and at Caracol, where there is strong evi-dence of preemptive accessions and corule during the latter years of cer-tain rulers as evidenced by stuccoed texts on Structure B19 (Houston2000 : 165). Similarly, dual rulership might have been in existence atTikal, as suggested by the apparent succession of titles from ajaw tokalomte’ (Valdés and Fahsen 1995 : 204 –207). After the rule of JaguarClaw I (Chak Tok Ich’ak) there may have been “two officials who ruledtogether, kalomte’ and ajaw. When the kalomte’ died, the reigning ajawusually succeeded to his title, while another lord, the next in line,moved up into the position of ajaw” (Harrison 1999 : 79, orthographychanged from original). Similar interpretations have been articulated byLaporte and Fialko (1990 : 58) and Braswell (2003b : 26). Again, such a di-vision would accommodate an intrasite successional pattern similar tothat of overlapping guest and host k’atun idols and mayseats. While atCopán the corulers would have been approximately equal and shared thek’ul ajaw title, at Tikal this was a more hierarchical relationship.Other kinds of evidence could be interpreted in the context of dualrulership. In western Belize, the sites of Buenavista and Cahal Pech ap-parently were effectively dual capitals, where two separate palacesserved a single royal court (Ball and Taschek 2001 : 187). Similar corulingsites might have existed in the Petexbatun, where Tamarindito and Ar-royo de Piedra seem to have been centers of a kingdom before a new cap-ital was established at Dos Pilas. Recent reinterpretation of the lateststelae at Machaquilá (Stelae 5– 8) reveals the possibility that Ruler 6may have been two people, perhaps twins (Myers and Rice n.d.).There are also numerous instances — particularly in the Pasión-Usumacinta region — of two sites sharing the same Emblem Glyph, or asingle site having paired Emblems (Martin and Grube 2000 : 19, 119).Paired sites sharing Emblem Glyphs include Bonampak and Lacanhá,Cancuen and Machaquilá (?), Tamarindito and Arroyo de Piedra, Dos Pi-las and Tikal, Palenque and Tortuguero, Motul de San José and Bejucal,and Quiriguá and Pusilhá. Sites with two-part Emblems are Machaquilá,Yaxchilán, Palenque, Caracol, Sacul, Ucanal, among others. While someof these could be interpreted in terms of dual rulers or ruling lineages ofa site, others could indicate the paired succession of mayseats, as in-08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 267"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"268maya political sciencecoming guest or coseat, ruling or host seat, and then out-going with anew guest seat.There have been several suggestions of triadic organization as well.Laporte and Fialko (1990 : 45) discussed the possibility of three lineageswith respect to the Early Classic rulership of Tikal and linked them totriadic architecture. The well-known Palenque Triad of gods (Lounsbury1985), along with the three hearthstones of creation, suggest mytho-cosmological bases for such structuring, complemented by David Sedat’s (1992 : 86) observations on the symbolism of triadic dot clustersas they relate to early fire-related ceremonies. More recently, a triadicpolitical organization, with sacred, secular, and military components,has been proposed for Calakmul (Folan, Gunn, and Domínguez Carrasco2001). Additional support comes from the names of numerous sites thatincorporate “three”: OxWitza ‘Three Hills Water’ (Caracol), Ox Te’ Tun‘Three Tree Stones’ (Calakmul), Ox Tun ‘Three Kawak [earth stones]’(Seibal), Ox Witik (Copán), and Uxmal/Ox Mal ‘Thrice Built’. It is alsouseful here to recall one of the types of political organization Quezada(1993) identified in sixteenth-century Yucatán, in which military, reli-gious, and politico-judicial administrative functions were held by threeindividuals. Similarly, Lincoln (1994) uses what he calls “Duméziliantrifunctional structuralism” to assess the possibility of triadic kingshipat Chich’en Itza.During the Postclassic and Contact periods in the Petén lakes region,the Itza, who had returned to their Classic period ancestral homeland af-ter the fall of Chich’en Itza in the north, appear to have had dual ruler-ship. The supreme ruler of Tayasal and the Itza was Ajaw Kan Ek’, who“shared power equally” with his cousin, the high priest Aj K’in Kan Ek’(Jones 1998 : 94). This joint rule at the highest levels of authority appar-ently was paralleled in the provinces by a quadripartite system of senior-junior pairs of an ajaw b’atab’ and a b’atab’ (ibid. : 95), each pair associ-ated with one of the four cardinal directions and also the wards ordistricts of a town or region. In addition, the Itza of Petén recognizedthirteen soldier-priests with the title Ach Kat, each of whom “repre-sented the military, religious, and practical interests of his home com-munity” (ibid. : 104). They were also the heads of the thirteen k’atunseats under the Itza hegemony of the may(ibid. : 102).Further amplification of the possibility of dual rulership comes fromEdmonson. In posing a series of provocative questions about ClassicMaya organization derived from his studies of the chronicles, Edmonson(1979 : 10 –11) noted that in Postclassic and Colonial Yucatán the lord ofthe k’atun held the title b’alam (jaguar) and was “the supreme ruler ofthe entire country during his 20 tunterm of office.” Similarly, the jaguarlords in Yucatán were assisted by a spokesman (chilam) who was a sage,08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 268"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"implications of the maymodel269great sun priest (aj noj k’in) of the k’atun, sun priest of the cycle (aj k’inmay), and also registrar of lands (aj p’iz te). Edmonson believes the roleof spokesman might be “a Postclassic Mexican addition to Mayan cul-ture,” specifically that of the Aztecs (and perhaps the Toltecs).However, a tantalizing bit of evidence for an early “speaker” roleamong the Maya comes from a Late Classic polychrome vase showing alord receiving tribute. He and three other individuals are identified as ajk’uhun scribes, one of whom also carries the title “chilam,” which Coe(1998 : 95) translates as “interpreter.” Even earlier, Middle Classic TikalStela 8 (9.5.2.9.0 1 Ajaw 8 K’ank’in) refers to the main personage as tijuun‘mouth [of the] headband’ (Guenter 2000 : 23, 24n4, citing D. Stu-art). Guenter interprets this individual as a backer of the female ruler,Lady of Tikal, who was suffering declining power and “needed male sup-port to rule” [sic]. Instead, the expression “speaker for the ruler” mightindicate a Middle Classic politico-religious role of “spokesman” for theruler-priest like that of the chilam b’alam in Postclassic and Colonialtimes in northern Yucatán. It is useful here to recall once again that theliteral meaning of ajaw is “he who shouts” (Stuart 1995) or proclaims orannounces.If, as Edmonson suggested, the Maya adopted a diarchical adminis-trative structure during Postclassic times, the roles and responsibilitiesof secular authorities (jalach winik, b’atab’s, etc.) and ritual authorities(both the b’alam and the chilam were priests) were likely to have differedsignificantly from the Aztec model. In addition, the roles of Classic di-vine kings, as interpreted through epigraphy and iconography, obviouslywould have undergone substantial transformation. If, on the other hand,the Maya already maintained a political diarchy during the Classic pe-riod (and perhaps earlier?) this would have greatly eased problems of suc-cession from one king to another. The role of intermarriage betweenroyal lineages, with naming practices (and perhaps descent reckoning?)recording both maternal and paternal names (“child of mother, child offather”), similarly could have contributed to resolving transitions ofkingship. We know that the late Itza rulers of Petén observed dual de-scent (see Jones 1998 : 447), as did nobles in Yucatán (almehen‘child ofmother, child of father’).How might any of this be recognized archaeologically? It seems vir-tually unarguable that during the Early, Middle, Late, and TerminalClassic periods the Maya in the southern lowlands regarded their kingsas the Jaguar Sun God. Kings are shown on stelae, lintels, and ceramicvessels dressed in jaguar pelts or kilts, wearing jaguar masks or booties,sitting on jaguar skin thrones, or having jaguar protectors looming overthem. Kings’ bodies were interred covered with jaguar pelts, and theirfunerary rituals were commemorated with incensarios decorated with08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 269"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"270maya political sciencethe imagery of the JGU or JGIII, the Jaguar God of the Underworld, thegod of the night sun as it journeyed back to the east through the Under-world. The rituals carried out by the kings on k’atun endings were mostspecifically marked by jaguar imagery and costuming. It seems clearfrom Classic iconography, then, that Classic Maya kings portrayed onstelae and lintels were also b’alams, that is, jaguar priests.Given this, I propose that Classic period ajaws and kalomte’s werepredecessors of the jaguar priests in k’atun and mayceremonies in thePostclassic and Colonial periods. Their role at the time, judging from de-pictions on Classic stelae, seems to have been most directly involved inautosacrifice or scattering, probably simultaneously a ritual to ensureearthly fertility, an invocation of ancestral approbation for kingly powerand legitimacy, and a reaffirmation of cosmic continuity in the endlesscycling of time.This raises the question, who were the individuals portrayed on Clas-sic stelae, altars, and lintels? The old answer was gods and priests; thecurrent answer is kings and lords. But in light of the Late Postclassic andearly Colonial evidence for the important role of jaguar priests, it is notunreasonable to wonder if the Classic personages depicted in grandiosejaguar costuming —heads, paws, robes, kilts, tails —were also priests.Did Classic kings have dual roles and titles as lord-ruler and chief cal-endar priest –b’alam? Did they also have spokesmen — chilams or ti ju-uns? Or were jaguar priests and kings separate individuals in the Classicperiod? Did a Classic title “jaguar priest” exist at all? Answers to thesequestions await further epigraphic and iconographic study.OverviewClassic period Maya rulers participated in numerous kinds of rituals,many of which were calendrical. The accumulating inscriptional andiconographic evidence associated with calendrical ceremonies is provid-ing new insights into the nature of rulership and political action amongthe Maya. In addition, the spatiotemporal distribution of certain ritual-related glyphs and imagery allows inferences as to the changing geo-political situation in the Late and Terminal Classic lowlands.For example, the fire sequence glyphs indicating Burner ritual seemto occur in Initial Series inscriptions in two areas of the southern low-lands. One of these is southeastern Petén and Belize, the area later oc-cupied by Mopan Maya speakers and also associated with Late Classicuse of E-Groups; the other is along the Pasión and Usumacinta Rivers,at the sites of Piedras Negras, Palenque, Bonakpak, and Yaxchilán. Firerituals also became very important at Terminal Classic Chich’en Itza,where architectural and iconographic evidence suggests strong ties to08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 270"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"implications of the maymodel271the Pasión-Usumacinta area (see Chap. 7). In light of this distribution, it is tempting to link the occurrence of the fire sequence and Burner rituals to the introduction and spread of the Campeche calendar duringthe seventh century (Edmonson 1988). For example, it is known that of the thirty-five identified days associated with these fire ceremonies,twenty-four were days Ajaw, which is a Burner day. However, five of theremaining identified days are yearbearers associated with the Campechecalendar and the Dresden Codex: Ak’bal’ (twice), Lamat (twice), and B’en(once). Another is a day 8 Ok, which also occurs as one of the Burnerdays in the Dresden Codex (pp. 30, 31) (Bricker 1997a : 5). The presenceof fire-drilling iconography and Burner phrases at Naranjo might alsocorrelate with the otherwise unexplained occurrence of the Campechecalendar there.The new calendars in the western lowlands involved changing thecounting system as well as the introduction of terminal naming of theyear. The latter practice is characterized as distinctively non-Maya: Edmonson (1988 : 103) calls it an “intrusive foreign idea” and attributesit to Ch’olan speakers and calendars used in the Gulf Coast or Oaxacaregion. As noted above, the practice of terminal dating of years came to be used in the Late Classic at sites in the Usumacinta region (Palen-que, Yaxchilán, Bonampak, Piedras Negras) and in the Puuc area ofCampeche (Uxmal, Edzná, Jaina, Holactún, and doubtless other sites).Apparently, it was not adopted elsewhere in the eastern or central low-lands (except at Naranjo?), where the so-called Mexican Tlaloc-Venusstar wars were most intensely fought (P. Rice n.d.c).It is not unreasonable to argue that the role of warfare in Late Classiclowland Maya society has been exaggerated in recent assessments.Many of the new glyph decipherments have yielded words that are suf-ficiently general that they could be interpreted less violently in otherarenas of competition or combat, such as the ballgame (P. Rice n.d.c).Also, many of the relationships between supposedly warring sites aredifficult to explain in the context of warfare as territorial conquest. Ac-cording to Quiriguá Stela E, K’ak’ Tiliw came to rule Quiriguá in 724 un-der the supervision of (u kab’iy) the very man he subsequently killed,Copán’s ruler Waxaklajun Ub’aj K’awil (Martin and Grube 2000 : 218). In 738 Quiriguá “defeated” Copán, but none of the Quiriguá accounts of this event refer to it by using a term for war (Martin and Grube2000 : 219).In another example, Schele (Schele and Grube 1995 : 21) describes thelords of Tikal and Calakmul as “deadly enemies.” But there are norecorded wars between these great Classic sites after Tikal’s defeat ofCalakmul in 695, and their rulers were able to come together — presum-ably peaceably —with other lords on state occasions, as seen on Copán08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 271"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"272maya political scienceStela A (731). The notion of deep and enduring hostilities between Tikaland Calakmul is belied by the latter site’s material culture affiliations.During the Late Classic period, Calakmul’s architecture is of Petén styleand its pottery complex is a full member of the Tikal-centric Tepeusphere, ceramic spheres traditionally interpreted as indicative of somedegree of economic integration. If the two sites were in protracted warsof conquest, it is hard to imagine why they would share material sym-bols displaying social identities, as well as let traders bringing such util-itarian goods as pottery pass through embattled territory.Evidence for destruction of sites and monuments, which has been animportant contributor to scenarios of widespread Classic period warfare,could instead represent the termination rituals that accompanied theend of the seating of the mayin a particular city. As Edmonson com-ments about the Postclassic Maya in northern Yucatán, theydestroyed the primate city and its road at the end of the may.Thereare indications that this “destruction” may have been largely ritualand symbolic, and that the “abandonment” of the city was an evac-uation by the ruling dynasty rather than total depopulation. Butsince the dynasties (e.g., the Xiu and the Itza) did not necessarilyagree on the ending date of the cycle, there was room for maneuverin politics, ideology and warfare. The Postclassic theory did not endthe legitimacy or existence of a dynasty, but only its right to rule aparticular city. (1979 : 11)On the eastern edge of Tikal’s Late Classic mayrealm, Naranjo re-portedly inflicted numerous “burnings” of its satellites, particularlyUcanal, between 692 and 711, during a K’atun 6 Ajaw, the first k’atun ofthe traditional Tikal calendar, and spilling over into the first jotun of thesucceeding k’atun. The demise and destruction of Late Classic sites attributed to some generalized belligerence may be more specificallytied to calendrics and the real or symbolic destruction — termination ritual— that accompanies the ending of the cycle of seats of the mayork’atuns.At the same time, these Late Classic “wars” could be analogous tothe “wars of proof” carried out by Aztec kings in order to seize captivesas evidence of cosmic sanction for their rule. As Martin and Grube(2000 : 14) remark, “[A]lthough blood[line] was their main claim to legit-imacy, candidates still had to prove themselves in war. A bout of cap-tive-taking often preceded elevation to office.” In this light, the Bonam-pak raids may have been for the purpose of taking captives inpreparation for accession to office (Justeson 1989 : 106, citing M. Miller08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 272"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"implications of the maymodel2731986). Whatever the proximate or ultimate causes of the Late Classicwars, I see them as forms of ritual conflict designed to demonstrate cal-endrical-cosmological legitimation of the right to rule, specifically theseating of maysand k’atuns. Hassig’s (1992) assessment of lowlandMaya warfare as being largely ritualized, one-on-one combat, is gener-ally correct in terms of scale, then, but not for all the right reasons.Much of the vocabulary interpreted as warfare could refer to the rit-ual conflict symbolized in the ballgame. Throughout Mesoamerica, theballgame was increasingly politicized and tied to warfare in the Classicperiod (Santley, Berman, and Alexander 1991; Taladoire and Colsenet1991; Fox 1991), and this certainly appears to hold true in the centralMaya area. The captives displayed on monuments and in ballgamescenes were sometimes among the governing elites of important cities,and the permanent and public display of their defeat on stone monu-ments seems to be of paramount significance (Miller and Houston 1987).In addition, the texts of Yaxchilán’s ballgame panels identify associatedsacrifices as “conquests” (Freidel, Schele, and Parker 1993 : 361). In suchcases, the battle of the ballgame might have been the context of con-quest (ajal) and the bound captive the actual or symbolic vanquished opponent in a ballgame contest, bound for sacrifice. These and other tex-tual references to combat, battle, and conquest could therefore be inter-preted in the context of symbolic and ritualized contests between struc-turally mandated “opponents” rather than as literal warfare. Here theobvious analogy is to the Popol Vuh,in which the Hero Twins con-quered the evil Lords of the Underworld in a ballgame contest.Justeson (1989) has pointed out that Venus positions are better asso-ciated with blood sacrifice and the ballgame than with warfare amongthe Classic Maya. I suggest the “combat” and “warfare” mentioned inthe Classic inscriptions refer to the taking of captives before, during, orafter the ballgame for the purposes of sacrifice, particularly in the stair-case version of the ballgame. This also explains the Venus imagery onstelae in some of Tikal’s twin-pyramid groups as well as prone captiveson the altars, because I believe these architectural complexes were usedin the staircase ballgame. It is not a great stretch to move from discus-sion of ballgame ritual to a broader political interpretation:[T]he ballgame was used as a substitute and a symbol for war. . . . Ifthe ballgame had acquired a war-like and political meaning, it mayhave been restricted to prominent sites and capitals. Ballcourtswould then be built only at major sites or in communities wherepolitical or military activities were especially important.

This site is now believed, in line with the chronicles, to have beenestablished by agreement among various lineages, including the Itzafrom central Petén. The founding confederacy appears to have decided to retain, return to, or reemphasize the ballgame as it may have been traditionally played in formal ballcourts as the appropriate setting forrituals — sacrifice and fire ceremonies — at the seating of k’atuns and es-pecially at the seating of the may.In this scenario there is a logic to theconstruction of thirteen ballcourts at Chich’en Itza, one for each k’atunof its mayseating (see Krochock and Freidel 1994 for alternative viewsof the political significance of ballgame ritual at Chich’en Itza).In any case, the situation in the southern lowlands by the end of theLate Classic was highly volatile. It is not difficult to envision that theintroduction of new calendars and associated ritual along the westernperiphery would have disrupted existing alliances and exacerbated ex-isting tensions, not to mention prompting serious cosmological inter-rogations. An explosion of “wars” and “defeats,” whether real or sym-bolic, among these sites during this interval may be indicative of suchdisagreements. So too, the increased frequency of Terminal Classicmonuments (Chap. 7) showing seated individuals, including captives,conversing or displaying only glyphic texts, might represent attempts toresolve them.08-T2963 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 274"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"chapter 9ConclusionMy working definition of political organization has been “the hierar-chically structured offices or roles of power and authority existingwithin, between, and among polities and their elites, whereby goal-oriented decisions about internal/external relations (including relationswith the supernatural realm) and allocation of resources (human, mate-rial, and ideational) are made and implemented.” And my concern hasbeen to determine the nature of the political organization of the Classiclowland Maya: the structure of its power relations and the decision-making functions within that structure.Several lines of evidence support the proposition that Classic lowlandMaya political organization is best explained through direct-historicalanalogy to arrangements described in the Postclassic and Colonial pe-riod indigenous and ethnohistorical literature. The may— a 256-year,thirteen-k’atun calendrical cycle —was the key geopolitical device thatstructured power relations from the Preclassic period onward. The maymodel proposes that during the Classic period there existed multiple“capitals” throughout the Maya lowlands, each a sacred city that seatedthe mayand thereby shouldered responsibility for ensuring cosmic con-tinuity, for a period of 256 years. Within the realm dominated by eachcycle seat, or may ku,were numerous subsidiary sites that had similarresponsibilities for seating the k’atun for periods of twenty years withinthat cycle. Maycycles — along with shorter temporal cycles folded inthem, longer cycles (the b’ak’tun) within which they operated, and theoverarching Mesoamerican principle of quadripartition — provided amytho-religious charter for the structure of regional roles of power andauthority.Acknowledging the imperative of recursive calendrical cycling inMaya geopolitico-ritual organization does not mean retrogression tosimplistic early models of the Maya as peaceful farmers ruled by star-gazing priests in empty towns.

Maya kings were individual agents with an im-pressive arsenal of tools of statecraft, including the ability to muster la-bor and tribute to construct buildings, plant and harvest crops, conducttrade, wage war, and organize ballgames. They likely had a host of ad-visers — other nobles, family members, priests, councils of rulers of sub-ordinate cities — to assist in decision making. That some mayor half-mayintervals discussed in the preceding chapters were not alwaysprecisely 256 or 128 years, but sometimes 236 or 130, demonstrates theadministrative flexibility in kings’ agency. Similarly, variations in ar-chitectural programming, and even in acceptance of which k’atunsmark the beginning and ending of cycles, reveal temporal and regionalvariability. The may,then, was neither a singularly inviolable determi-nant of kingly action nor a mere ideoritual flourish. Rather, the maymodel acknowledges that cosmic cycling and quadripartition were op-erational principles that established the deep structure of the Mayaworld.Evidence to support the extended duration of this organizational sys-tem can be drawn from various sources: epigraphic, linguistic, icono-graphic, architectural, archaeological, historical, ethnohistorical, andethnographic. Historical, ethnohistorical, and ethnographic data estab-lished the outlines of the calendrico-quadripartite model, traces ofwhich lingered at least into the eighteenth if not the twentieth century.In northern Yucatán, these traces include quadripartite rotation of townleaders and their twenty-year terms and perhaps the jetz’ luum cere-mony (Thompson 1999).Bishop Landa’s sixteenth-century account is especially illuminating.At one point he noted carved monuments at the Late Postclassic capitalof Mayapán, commenting that the “lines of the characters which theyuse”— their hieroglyphic inscriptions on stelae —were worn away byrain, and the Maya living nearby said they “were accustomed to erectone of these stones every twenty years” (Tozzer 1941 : 38 –39). In otherwords, Mayapán, with at least thirteen sculptured and twenty-five plainstelae (Morley 1920 : 574 –576; Proskouriakoff 1962b : 134 –136), had re-vived the Late Classic k’atun-ending stela cult as part of the public cel-ebrations accompanying its seating of the may.(The plaza floor aroundStructure 162, the Castillo, was reconstructed thirteen times, presum-ably every k’atun [Pugh 2001b : 253], suggesting that such refurbishingwas also part of mayceremonies.)Postclassic codices also echo the imagery of Late Classic stelae in theTikal region: page 34a of the Madrid Codex (see Fig. 8.3), one of theWayeb’ pages, shows the Kawak yearbearer wearing a jaguar pelt andheaddress and scattering.

This suggests that by the Postclassic period the rituals accompanying k’atun endings mighthave been more overtly incorporated into or conflated with New Year’sceremonies.That calendrical cycling was key to Maya “politics” is not a novelsuggestion. Twenty-five years ago, Dennis Puleston (1979 : 63) high-lighted “the Maya conception of historical repetition [that entailed] aconformance of history to certain underlying, predictable patterns as re-vealed in the katun prophecies.” At the same time, Edmonson (1979)raised “some Postclassic questions about the Classic Maya” that hy-pothesized many of the same possibilities pursued here regarding themay.Yet the profound implications of the concept of calendrical cyclingfor illuminating our understanding of the Maya political world have notbeen adequately pursued.Much of what can be deduced from the Postclassic and Colonial pe-riod Maya prophetic histories indicates an emphasis on rotatingpolitico-religious offices and responsibilities, suggesting that a cyclicalstructuring of secular or earthly affairs was modeled on cosmological-calendrical cycles. But the foundations of authority, the roles of priestsand kings and subsidiary lords and councils, were not only changingwith the imposition of Spanish rule, they were also suborned.In many cases priestly and political functions had been combined in such a manner that it was difficult, if not impossible, to differen-tiate them. Consequently the Spaniards regarded the native priestswith great suspicion. Moreover, any resurgence of loyalty to the ab-original forms of religion was regarded not only as a serious threatto the missionary program but even as a sign of incipient revoltagainst Spanish supremacy. (Tozzer 1941 : 27n149; see also Avendañoy Loyola 1987 : 39)Under such circumstances, it was in the best interests of the Maya tohide or disguise the operations of their traditional geopolitico-religiousstructure. And as it was hidden from the Spaniards, it has remainedopaque to us today. Yet some diagnostic components survived the con-quest and, as illustrated by Edmonson (1979) and the preceding chapters,they can be teased out of extant documents and retrodicted into earliertimes.That the Classic lowland Maya observed maycycles is most readilyevident from the architecture and monuments of Tikal, beginning withthe Middle Preclassic E-Group assemblage in Mundo Perdido, later ac-conclusion27709-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 277"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"companied by k’atun-ending monuments. This architectural groupingbecame very widespread throughout the lowlands; what came to havemore enduring significance, however, is the complex’s western struc-ture, a radial platform. The construction of radial platforms in the cen-ters of plazas, often accompanied by monuments recording meetings of regional lords, was later repeated throughout the Classic and Termi-nal Classic lowlands, as exemplified by Copán Structure 4, Seibal Struc-ture A-3, Dzibilchaltún’s Temple of the Dolls, and numerous others atChich’en Itza and Postclassic Mayapán.Tikal’s twin-pyramid groups are particularly important, in part be-cause the twin east-west temples are radial structures, revealing deepcontinuities in the ritual significance of this form. More important, thestela-altar pairs in the northern enclosures reveal that the complexeswere built to commemorate k’atun endings. Nine of these groups areknown at Tikal, and others have been identified at four or five nearbysites. This suggests that these sites —Yaxhá, Ixlú, Zacpetén —wouldhave been k’atun seats within Tikal’s Late Classic seating of the may.Although these other nearby complexes do not exactly duplicateTikal’s, perhaps by intention or perhaps never completed, their ex-istence suggests that these sites were united by a powerful shared ide-ology given explicit material form as cosmograms. Similar programs,characterized by multiple iterations of a distinctive structural form withmythocosmic associations (e.g., thirteen ballcourts at Chich’en Itza) or monument style (e.g., Giant Ajaw period-ending altars at Caracol), reveal that may-based geopolitico-religious organization was wide-spread throughout the southern lowlands. They also support Aveni’s(2003 : 160) assertion that “there is little doubt that a state calendar . . .played a role in certain stages of site planning” (see also Ashmore 1989,1991).Retrodiction of the Postclassic and Colonial system also has been fa-cilitated over the past few decades by accelerating linguistic and epi-graphic analyses of Classic period inscriptions. These analyses have revealed continuities and identities in words and linguistic structures,including calendrical observations and rulers’ titles. Supplemented byiconographic studies of the imagery on Classic period monuments, thetexts reveal considerable information about the nature and importanceof kings’ calendrical celebrations. All of this complements what hasbeen long known from the past century of archaeological investigations:certain large lowland Maya sites like Tikal, Calakmul, Seibal, Caracol,Chich’en Itza, Dzibilchaltún, Cobá— and some smaller ones like Copánand Palenque —were the principal cities of sizable territories and capi-tals of regional realms.278maya political science09-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 278"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"There is considerable evidence to support the proposition that theMaya extended the Mesoamerican concept of a quadripartite cosmosinto the terrestrial or geopolitical sphere, with ethnographic and ethno-historic data on four quarters or wards (Jones 1998) and four roads andentrances into modern towns such as Mama (Thompson 1999 : 246).

Thus, around 8.0.0.0.0in a.d.41, Late Preclassic capitals such as Cerros and El Mirador wereterminated and new capitals or mayseats put into place; at 9.0.0.0.0(a.d.435), the dynasties of the four capitals Tikal, Copán, Palenque, andCalakmul were established; at 10.0.0.0.0 (a.d.830), new capitals wouldhave included Seibal, Chich’en Itza, and Uxmal, perhaps inaugurated128 years earlier as “guests.” At 11.0.0.0.0 (a.d.1224), the four capitalsnamed above would have been identified with specific lineages and cov-ered both northern and southern lowlands: Kin Colah Peten being theKowoj in eastern Yucatán-Belize-Petén; Na Cocob being the Kokom(Itza) of Mayapán in the north; Hol Tun Zuyua as the Xiw (Cetelac orMerida) in the west; and Can Hek Uitz referring to Kan Ek’ Witz or theLake Petén Itzá region in the south. Some variant of this last organiza-tion seems to have prevailed through 12.0.0.0.0 (a.d.1618) but with theintroduction of Valladolid as the (north-)eastern capital.Similarly, quadripartition of the b’ak’tuns could possibly have hadsome geopolitical significance, although the evidence is weak and, be-cause of the absence of dates, it is difficult to evaluate this in any inter-val other than B’ak’tun 9.

While the absence of dated texts in the Pre-classic period renders verification problematic, it can be postulated onthe basis of shared building programs, specifically the E-Group assem-blage. These complexes — radial structures centered west of a north-south linear platform supporting three structures — are thought to haveinitially functioned in observational astronomy, marking sunrise posi-tions on the solstices and equinoxes. They spread widely throughout thesouthern and central lowlands during the Late Preclassic and Early Clas-sic periods, and in places their active use in connection with k’atun cer-emonies extended into the Late and Terminal Classic. Elsewhere, theyoften continued to be refurbished; perhaps their ritual function changed.The role of these complexes in establishing the existence of may-based political organization in the Preclassic becomes apparent withrecognition that the earliest k’atun-ending stelae were erected in frontof the linear structure of these putative astronomical complexes, or else-where in the plazas, in the late fourth century a.d.It is very likely thatthese carved stone valedictory monuments had been preceded for cen-turies by plain wooden or stone markers placed in the same positions.The solar function and symbolism of these structures was appropriatedby later rulers and translated into their titles (K’inich ‘sun-faced’ or per-haps more literally ‘sun-facing’) and costuming.If we allow that may- and k’atun-based calendrical cycling lay at thefoundation of lowland Maya political organization, then it is importantto try to understand how it “worked.” We can hypothesize, for example,on the basis of analogy to the k’atun ceremonies described by BishopLanda in the sixteenth century (Tozzer 1941 : 134 –149), that the systemwas operationalized on the midpoints of 20-year and 256-year cycles.Cities serving as new mayand k’atun seats would have been decided onin the midpoint of a cycle —10 years for a jetz’ k’atun and 128 years fora may ku— and their role was initiated as they collaborated during thesecond half of that cycle as the guest of the current ruler of the period.They then came to full power as seats of authority at the beginning ofthe relevant cycle and ruled alone for its first half. At the midpoint, newseats were decided for the upcoming k’atun and may,and these sharedrule as guest of the existing seat for the second half of the cycle.

Founder’s history? Genealogies and lineage claims? Strengthof marital or military alliances? Cosmological cycling and auguries?Warfare? In the absence of precise information, we can only assume thatit might have been some combination of any of the above. Clearly Pre-classic first founders and their associated families or lineages — theirhouses, or naj —would have played fundamental roles in establishingthe wealth, power, and ritual sanctity of their villages. The founders ofMaya settlements had to establish positive relations with cosmic forcesand establish a “ritual axis mundi” by constructing a ceremonial struc-ture (McAnany 2001 : 145; see also McAnany 1995), and it appears thatduring the Middle and Late Preclassic periods (and into the Early Clas-sic) such facilities included E-Groups.The sites proposed here as mayseats reveal variability in their his-tories before, during, and after they seated the cycle, yet some general elements seem common to them. The critical events, in approximate se-quence, are (1) a real or hypothetical dynastic founding date; (2) com-memoration of a period ending (usually a k’atun ending and usually withthe erection of a stela); (3) display of an Emblem Glyph; (4) the symbolicconquest of the existing mayseat, apparently through the taking andsacrificing of captives; and (5) at some point, typically in the middle of ak’atun, inauguration of a new ruler who seats the mayand begins to reg-ularly celebrate k’atun endings while undertaking a massive building oriconographic program. These rulers frequently participated in accessionevents at other sites or sent members of the royal family to marry intoother dynasties. At some sites, there seems to be (6) a pattern of placinga final stela to commemorate the third k’atun after the ending of themayseating. For example, Tikal, Uaxactún, Quiriguá, Calakmul, andToniná erected a carved dated stela in the Terminal Classic, sixty yearsafter their Late Classic mayseating expired. Sometimes these stelae in-dicate that the k’atun ending was celebrated by two rulers. The mean-ing of this ceremony is not known.An intriguing issue in may kuselection concerns the role of cenotesand caves, regarded as openings to the Underworld. Two important Post-classic seats of the may,Chich’en Itza and Mayapán, incorporate wordsfor “well” or “cenote” in their names. Might, then, a ch’en or cavelikeopening to the watery Underworld have been a requirement for the cityseating the mayin the Postclassic period? Could a similar requirementhave existed in the Classic?

Numerous inscriptions reportthat important rituals took place “in the center of” a site or in part of asite identified by glyphs that read ch’en‘cave, well’ (Montgomery2001a : 236 –237). These come from the so-called impinged bone set, onevariant of which has been read as kun‘seat’. While these referencescould refer to tombs —human-made caves in the pyramidal “moun-tains” of temple substructures — their role in calendrical ceremoniesmerits further attention. Tikal Stela 16 (see Fig. 5.5), for example, refersto Jasaw Kan K’awil ending the k’atun at the “first maw/hole” or firstentrance to the Underworld (Harris and Stearns 1997 : 166 –168). TikalLintel 3 of Temple 1 includes a reference to an event occurring “in thecenter of the cave/seat of Tikal,” and reference to a ch’en or cave canalso be seen on Tikal Stela 5. The main sign of the Emblem Glyph forPiedras Negras is yokib’,meaning “cave or entrance,” and refers to alarge sinkhole near the site (Stuart, Houston, and Robertson 1999 : 143).Uxmal Stela 14 (see Fig. 7.11) shows the ruler Lord Chak standing overnaked captives lying in a cave or cenote. Naranjo Stela 23 refers toquema la sede,or burning the seat or ch’en of Yaxhá in a.d.710 (Grube2000b : 257), but in this context it seems more likely that a seat (ofpower) rather than a watery well was burned. Coggins (1983 : 61– 63)noted that the base of Dzibilchaltún Structure 1-sub was decorated witha stucco water frieze, providing Underworld associations that she linkedto a cenote cult of divination and prophesy.The maymodel also prompts some speculative interpretations ofEmblem Glyphs themselves. As noted in Chapter 3, these glyphs havethree parts, one of which, variably present, is k’ul‘divine, holy’. Em-blem Glyphs are typically read in nonstandard order, that is, as prefix –main sign – superfix (e.g., divine Tikal lord), instead of the standardprefix – superfix – main sign (divine lord [of] Tikal). I suggest that thepresence or absence of the k’ulprefix in an Emblem might be interpretedin the context of cities as seats of the may,following Edmonson’s de-scription of those cities seating the mayas sacred (siyaj kan‘heavenborn’). Thus if Classic sites with full, tripartite Emblem Glyphs wereconsidered sacred like their later Yucatán counterparts, then the Em-blem could be read “divine-Mutul lord” (i.e., lord of divine-Mutul) as easily as “divine Mutul-lord” (i.e., divine-lord of Mutul). After all, it is “the kingship and not the king who is divine” (Feeley-Harnik1985 : 276).282maya political science09-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 282"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Emblem Glyph main signs lacking the k’ulprefix are generallyviewed as toponyms, simply indicating the site as a location withoutreference to its politico-ritual status. However, display of Emblemswithout this prefix might be a privilege of sites and their lords that areor intend to be k’atun seats (jetz’ k’atun) and ultimately, perhaps, eligi-ble to compete to seat the maycycle. In addition, the distribution ofEmblem Glyphs according to apparent site hierarchies might be a con-sequence of distribution of these k’atun seats within the various realmsof the may.How did a city become a k’atun seat? We can only assumethat there were criteria and rituals similar to those of a mayseat.The Maya recorded relations of political subordination/domination,such as the u kab’iy and yajaw expressions, between major centers orseats of the mayand lords of lesser cities that would have been k’atunseats. Subordinate relations such as u kab’iy and yahaw likely relate tothe mayseating, such as designation of k’atun seats or mayseat suc-cessors. Through time, as more and more civic-ceremonial centers wereestablished in the Late Classic, erecting monuments and displayingEmblem Glyphs, the process for becoming a k’atun seat might have be-come more competitive. As noted previously, Colonial period seats ofthe k’atun held significant power and responsibilities in political and rit-ual affairs. As the physical k’atun seat, or jetz’ k’atun, changed, so didthe layers of administrative lordship or priestly oversight of the period.One implication of the maymodel is that arguments about ClassicMaya “political” organization in Western, secular terms, using para-digms such as unitary versus segmentary states or hierarchies of sitesizes, are somewhat misguided. Attempts to force the Classic Maya ontopolitical templates extracted from Africa, the Aegean, medieval Europe,and Bali have not been successful. A more appropriate first step is to testthe applicability of an existing, indigenous Maya model, one derivedfrom direct-historical analogy, as an explanation of Maya political geog-raphy and organization.At the same time, the notion of large Maya states whose power is ex-plicitly derived from and manifested by control of calendrical cyclingand associated mayand k’atun ritual does not require that all the oldmodels must be discarded. It is in the context of an indigenous modellike that of the maythat some of these concepts become more compre-hensible. For example, the maymodel suggests that notions of regal-ritual cities and theater states have considerable relevance to the Maya.These concepts acknowledge, in one way or another, that Classic Mayacities grew as grandiose monuments to sacred elites, deified ancestors,cosmological cycles, and the endlessly repetitive rituals required tomaintain all of them.conclusion28309-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 283"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"As places, Maya cities were organized as locations dedicated to an-cestor veneration, housing royal courts (in palaces) and god effigies(in temples, or wayib’), accommodating the services and people nec-essary to their maintenance, and performance of political theater,including the reception and display of captives and tribute. (Hous-ton 2000 : 173)In addition, the allocation of resources is an important component inthe definition of political organization, and the role of the economy —production, consumption, and distribution — needs to be more carefullyassessed in the context of the maymodel. For example, Kazuo Aoyama(2001) suggested that Copán’s state power derived from a “managerial”function, that is, control of the distribution of Ixtepeque obsidian, andthis control faltered by the end of the Yax Kuk’ Mo’ dynasty.The Classic Maya: A Theocratic StateMaurice Bloch, in his Malinowski Memorial Lecture, “The Past and thePresent in the Present,” made two important points concerning socialstructure that are pertinent to understanding Classic Maya politicalstructure. One is that political-cum-social “structure is only extractedfrom ritual communication [and] turns out to be a system of classifica-tion of human beings linked to other ritual cognitive systems, such asthe ritual notion of time” (Bloch 1977 : 286). The other is that in soci-eties the amount of “social theory expressed in the language of ritual”varies directly with the degree of social hierarchization: that is, “theamount of social structure, of the past in the present, of ritual commu-nication is correlated with the amount of institutionalizedhierarchy”(Bloch 1977 : 288 –289; emphasis in original).These concepts are of interest given the changes — the evolution, if you will— of Classic Maya political organization from Preclassicthrough Postclassic times. Among the Maya, the “sacred” and the “sec-ular” are so deeply intertwined as to be inseparable, and early archaeol-ogists commonly considered the Maya a theocracy or a theocratic state.The latter term has been out of favor for some time, as the recent em-phasis among epigraphers and archaeologists has been on relatively con-tinuous warfare among the hithertofore “peaceable” Classic Maya. Yetdespite some serious theoretical ambiguities, “theocracy” seems to bestdescribe the Maya geo-socio-politico-religious system and the concept isworth reexamining. The importance to the Maya of ritual and ritual cel-ebrations of time’s passage and the clear hierarchy of their society un-derscores the applicability of the term.284maya political science09-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 284"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"But what is a theocracy? According to David Webster (1976 : 813, 815),a theocracy represents both a type of society and a stage of sociopoliti-cal evolution that precede “secular” states. When used in a typologicalsense, à la Thompson and Coe, it carries substantial baggage besides thatof supernatural sanctions. The subjective connotations are of peaceful,nonmilitaristic, nonurban, stable societies, as compared to secularstates (Webster 1976 : 814). While these implications of “theocracy” areneither necessary nor necessarily accurate, they became the focal termsstructuring debates about Classic lowland Maya political organizationin the past two to three decades.Whether type or stage, leadership in a theocracy is socially validatedand legitimized by supernatural sanctions. Leaders come from sociallyadvantaged kin groups and are religious specialists or priest-kings whosepower to rule is derived from the power of cosmological sanctions, ar-chaeologically visible through the deployment of labor forces in the con-struction of large civic-ceremonial buildings. This touches on the deli-cate problem of “institutional balance.”[T]he fundamental target of bureaucratic elite control is . . . the minor or peripheral leadership (call them local officials, gover-nors, . . .) of localized, or perhaps specialized, segments of the largersociety. . . . These are the individuals ultimately responsible fortranslating central directives into social action [and] are, in otherwords, potential competitors of the centralized elites. [At the sametime, however,] they shared, at least to some degree, a common con-sensus in the moral or supernatural legitimization of the centralizedleadership’s claim to high religious status and control of ceremoni-alism. (Webster 1976 : 818)In Webster’s (1976 : 826) view, theocratic societies and the supernatu-ral sanctions at their core developed as part of a larger evolutionary pro-cess, as adaptive and stabilizing “responses to the stresses of rapid cul-ture change from hierarchical kin-based societies to class-structuredones.” A particular problem in such periods is the transformation ofcharismatic (or shamanic; Freidel 1992) roles into permanent, institu-tionalized offices of power, a problem Webster (1976 : 820 – 821) resolvesby postulating the existence of “charismatic office”: institutionalizedbut with a “supernatural aura.” He goes on to note the existence in sev-eral archaic states (Egypt, Near East) of “[p]luralistic or dualistic modesof authority structure,” whether secular and religious or economic andpolitical, that may be symbolized ideologically (Webster 1976 : 823; alsoWebster 2002 : 129). Finally, he emphasizes that a transition from theo-conclusion28509-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 285"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"cratic to secular modes of social integration does not indicate any in-herent instability of theocratic states but rather highlights that “theo-cratic structures were successful in providing enormously fertile envi-ronments for the emergence” of new and more adaptive organizationalmodes (Webster 1976 : 824).To translate some of these concepts to the particular case of the low-land Maya and the may,it is evident that Classic Maya rulers weredrawn from certain elite kin groups or lineages or houses, whose ances-tors or founders were deeply revered. They proclaimed their sanctifiedpower through public texts, regalia, art, and the theater of architecture,referring to the gods and the ancestors as their supernatural patrons andcarrying out public and private rituals to sustain that cosmic blessing.During the Late Preclassic, the Jaguar God of the Sun, patron of Mayarulers, was powerfully invoked on the facades of public buildings, someof which were associated with the distinctive and widely shared E-Group assemblages. By the end of the second century a.d., Maya kingshad assumed a sacred or divine status as k’ul ajaw and the role of theJaguar Sun God was transformed with it. Still later, after 475, Tikal royalregalia changed and the Jaguar Sun God was appropriated as a powerfulicon of Classic kingly office worn and brandished by rulers (Freidel andSchele 1988b : 69) and decorating incense burners used in royal mortuaryritual (Rice 1999).Another concept that can be reinterpreted in the context of the Mayamayis that of divine kingship (see Feeley-Harnik 1985 for a review).Like theocracy, the concept of divine kingship carries a heavy theoreti-cal load, but much of it directly opposes that which clings to theocracy.Developed primarily out of early British structural-functionalist studiesof postcolonial African descent-based kingdoms, the concept of divinekingship has been associated with instability, tendency toward civil war,and regicide, particularly as these phenomena are associated with royalsuccessions. Freidel and Schele’s analyses of the emergence of the k’ulajaw fit well into the long-recognized anthropological distinction be-tween “achieved” and “ascribed” leadership roles, and also the distinc-tion between an office and the person who holds it. The death of an in-dividual king is not the same as the death of the office (Feeley-Harnik1985 : 278).This brings up two interesting points. First, could the “k’ul” of theClassic period k’ul ajaw title and Emblem Glyphs refer to the holy qual-ity of the office or the site where the ruler is seated and not the rulerhimself or herself? Second, what do we know of succession in ClassicMaya kingship? The answer to the second question is, surprisingly little,although the deer hoof sign read mayis also read to indicate heir ap-286maya political science09-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 286"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"parency. The inscriptions typically indicate intervals of a few months totwo or more years between the recorded date of death of one king andthe recorded accession of another (see, e.g., Martin and Grube 2000). Butwhat happened in the interregnum? Were the Maya lords waiting fortheir priests to identify a day with a favorable augury for installation?Who ruled during this liminal period: the office of the deceased king?Such questions demand answers.Underlying the history of transformations in Maya political leader-ship — from charismatic (or shamanic) leaders to sacred kings —werecorresponding changes in their relationship with the cosmos. That is,sometime during the Preclassic period the Maya replaced their relativelysimple techniques of observational astronomy with the far more power-ful calculus of predictive astronomy. The origins of Mesoamerican observational astronomy cannot be reliably dated (Rice n.d.a), but hu-man interest in the movements of the sun, moon, and stars assuredlycan be traced back into Paleolithic times, along with some recognitionof their periodicity. Systematic deification of those celestial bodies andthe intervals of time they control may have similarly deep antiquity. Butsuch knowledge systems are only recognizable archaeologically by ma-terial evidence, and in Mesoamerica formal and imperishable architec-tural commemoration of the regularity of celestial movements appearsto date to the Early Preclassic or Formative period (perhaps ca. 2000 –1500 b.c.). This was followed by the development of formal systems forrecording observations of astronomical and seasonal cycling: a writingsystem and a mathematical system, allowing permanent records oftime’s passage. Available data indicate that ancient Mesoamericans be-gan to make such permanent registers sometime in the first half of thefirst millennium, perhaps almost simultaneously in the Gulf Coast re-gion and in Oaxaca.Predictive astronomy, far more complex, could develop only afterrecord-keeping systems were quite advanced. Predictive astronomy hadto be based on a large body of recorded observations accumulated overthe centuries, allowing recognition of periodicities in the past that couldbe projected into the future. While observational astronomy was prac-ticed throughout Mesoamerica, and may be traceable to a single, shared,calendrical system — the Calendar Round, correlating the 260-day and365-day calendars, known from Olmec times — this more esoteric andawe-inspiring system, which allowed prediction of eclipses and other ce-lestial events, was, at least early on, known only to the Maya (and/ortheir Mixe-Zoque ancestors). Predictive astronomy not only confirmedthe divine sanction of the king or k’ul ajaw as the ruler of time, it alsoauthenticated the divine sanction of his city as the operational centerconclusion28709-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 287"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"through which time was manipulated and controlled. As such, it was anessential tool for maintaining long-term cycles of cosmically basedgeopolitical authority and the cosmic mandates of prophetic history.With advances in predictive astronomy, the utilitarian observationalfunctions of the E-Groups probably became obsolete. However in someareas of the lowlands — for example, southeastern Petén — this architec-tural complex continued into the Late Classic period. Perhaps it enduredas a powerful symbol of cosmic order and the supernatural forces —the daily appearance of the Sun God — that oversaw the kingdom. Alter-natively, perhaps the astronomical esoterica essential to predictingeclipses, Venus movements, and so on was controlled by an elite priest-hood associated with only the most powerful lineages or residing onlyat the most sacred sites. In such a circumstance, dissenting or out-of-favor lineages, factions, or subsidiary lords and towns would have beendenied access to this information and the superior statuses it assured.They might have had little recourse but to continue the “old-fashioned”observatory technology of the E-Groups.The sacred or divine king or lord known as k’ul ajaw stood at the veryheart of Classic Maya political structure. Classic Maya kings com-manded a broad range of responsibilities, whether they were lords of themayor of the k’atun, and some of these roles are seen in their portray-als on monuments and lintels and in their titles and epithets. They weresovereigns but also ballplayers, sacrificers, dancers, warriors, and cap-tors. They were very likely priests, or at least trained in the arcaneknowledge of the priesthood involving calendrics, prophetic histories,and auguries and in maintaining records of these (aj kujun). The mul-tiple, complex roles of Maya kings can be elucidated etymologically, forexample, in the case of Tikal. Tikal’s dynastic founder was named YaxEb’ Xok ‘First Step Shark’, but xokalso means “to count, to read”; oneof the meanings of mayis “to count, to divine.” What was being countedor read? Days. The calendar. Time itself.This suggests that early Maya rulers were also aj k’in, priests calleddaykeepers, calendric specialists in the sense of the K’iche’ (and otherhighland Maya) indigenous leaders and diviners. In addition, the originalname of Tikal comes from mut‘prophecy’ and the root of ajaw is aw‘toshout’. This indicates that early kings also bore the responsibility ofshouting or proclaiming the prophecies they divined as keepers of time,particularly at cycles of k’atuns and maysbased on days Ajaw. There arehints that the role of chilam, “speaker or interpreter” (of the propheciesof the ajaw), might have existed in the Classic period.Maya divine kings, in other words, were “fulcrums of cosmic order”(Mundy 1998 : 234). Their powers derived from knowledge — and there-288maya political science09-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 288"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"fore control, or at least custodianship — of the mysterious forces of thecosmos. As Houston and Stuart note, the rituals portrayed on Mayamonuments represent the Classic kingsin a perpetual state of ritual action. . . . [R]ulers were themselvesembodiments of time and its passage — a role that was fundamen-tal to the cosmological underpinnings of divine kingship. We findthis expressed most directly by the overt solar symbolism that sur-rounded the office of Maya kingship. . . . The cyclical reappearanceof the Ajaw day at each Period Ending in the Long Count calendarwas not only a renewal of cosmological time but also a renewal, ineffect, of the institution of kingship — an elaboration of the concep-tual equation of the ruler and the sun. (1996 : 165–167)In the Classic Maya lowlands, as in so many other early state soci-eties, ideology and power cannot be disarticulated. Nor can ritual andhistory be decoupled from structures of power (Kelly and Kaplan 1990).Among the Maya, “political” power was embedded in an ideology whosekey elements were cyclical time and cosmic quadripartition. The criti-cal aspect of the temporal cycles is not the calendrical interval itself butrather the regular and public ritual celebration of the completion ofthese cycles by the sacred king. Such rituals, assuming they were con-ducted efficaciously, reaffirmed social, natural, and dynastic history andcommunicated cosmic order and continuity.The significance of the 256-year cycles of the mayand the 20-year cy-cles of k’atuns lies in their establishing a cosmological charter forpraxis: the pragmatic structuring of history and power vis-à-vis intra-and intersite relations in the Classic period lowlands. The maymodelprovides archaeologists with a basis for more parsimonious yet robustexplanations of the overwhelming political, social, economic, architec-tural, iconographic, and material variability in the lowlands area. Thehierarchical relations between k’atun seats and the maycenter resultedin a geopolitical system of shared, overlapping, and rotating poweramong sites in a region. It was this system and its ideology that resolvedpractical concerns with political legitimation and succession and alsoprovided stability for the Maya through periods of change and trans-formation over two millennia.Finally, it is important to recall that the calendrical rituals of the mayand b’ak’tun recorded in the books of the chilam b’alams are the ac-cumulation of two millennia of elaboration through Preclassic, Clas-sic, and Postclassic periods. During these millennia, ritual practices and paraphernalia — the role of ancestors, the ballgame, New Year’s conclusion28909-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 289"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"cycles, human sacrifice, fire ceremonies —would have been added,deleted, modified, or otherwise reworked to accommodate particularcircumstances.In consequence, not all the components of Colonial period cere-monies precisely replicate those of the Classic, and we should not ex-pect them to do so.

These reveal thatthe may,the multi-k’atun calendrical cycles by which Classic and Post-classic period political organization was structured, also contoured thetopography of Classic period political geography. For some two millen-nia, then, Maya calendrical cycles and their underlying astronomicalscience provided the basis for Maya “political science.”290maya political science09-T2963-CNC 6/15/04 2:25 PM Page 290"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"bibliographyAbrams, Eliot M.1994How the Maya Built Their World: Energetics and Ancient Architec-ture.Austin: University of Texas Press.Adams, Richard E.
