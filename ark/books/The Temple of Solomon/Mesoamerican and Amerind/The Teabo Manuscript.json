I still consider myself fortunate to have been his student. John F. Chuchiak also deserves my most heartfelt thanks. His ex-pertise in Maya manuscripts and Church history, particularly in Yucatan, opened new insights and challenged me to see the Teabo Manuscript in new ways, and I am profoundly grateful. When I came across particularly puzzling words and passages, David Bolles proved most generous with his time and talents in the translation of Yucatec Maya, and I am grateful. Finally, Victoria Bricker and Timothy Knowlton provided their time and expertise whenever I had questions or was in need of other scholarly opinions.Of course, many deserve my sincere appreciation for both their scholar-ship that paved the way and their assistance through various conversations, emails, and advice. My thanks in particular to Louise Burkhart, Fr. Roger Corriveau, Jaime Lara, Brian Murdoch, Michel Oudijk, Stafford Poole, C.M., Frauke Sachse, Sabine Dedenbach- Salazar Saenz, Amara Solari, and David Tavárez. A few existing works include discussions and translations of various versions of the Genesis Commentary and other texts that proved helpful in my own translation process. I am particularly grateful for Victoria Bricker and Helga- Maria Miram’s work on the Kaua, and Gretchen Whalen’s work on the Morley Manuscript. Moreover, portions of this book benefited from the comments of those attending the 2013 roundtable at the Käte Ham-burger Kolleg at the Center for Religious Studies, Ruhr- Universität. I also am indebted to the staff at Brigham Young University’s L. Tom Perry Special Collections, including Cindy Brightenburg, Kohleen Jones, and Russ Taylor, for their assistance and the generosity of the library for allowing a full repro-duction of the text. This project has also benefited from the financial support of the National Endowment for the Humanities and Assumption College.As always, the largest debt is held by those most close: my family. My wife is always willing to listen to me ramble on about translations and new ideas for the book, and my kids help me to smile and laugh after long days in front of a computer. I could not have asked for a more beautiful family."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"c o n v e n t i o n s ✢ xvConventions of Transcription and TranslationThis book draws heavily from Maya, Nahuatl, and Spanish sources, and all English translations are my own unless stated otherwise. In all instances I strive to make the translations readable and oftentimes favor a figurative rather than a literal translation of the texts. Maya authors did not conform to modern conventions of punctuation, spacing, and para-graphing, so I have included them in the translations. However, to the extent possible I have transcribed the Teabo Manuscript and other documents as they appear in their original form, employing the occasional “. . .” when water damage or wear renders the text unreadable. For purposes of readability, I employ modern standards for determining line breaks and do not parse the transcription into phrase- segments as is sometimes done to highlight poten-tial poetic devices in the text. The manuscript typically separates paragraphs with a decorative drop cap, and such are represented in the transcription. In instances of possible confusion in the translation, I use parentheses to con-vey intended meanings and brackets for omitted words. Moreover, in the transcriptions I occasionally comment on the reading of a word, and such are found in the notes.As is common practice, I employ “ɔ” for the backwards “c” used by the colonial Maya—today written as “dz”—and “dz” for those instances where a “ɔ” appears in personal or place- names. Moreover, the colonial Maya often marked glottal stops with horizontal strokes through “h” and “p,” and such are represented here as “ch” and “p”. The Maya word yetel, “and or with,” often appears abbreviated as a “y” with a horizontal stroke, seen here as “y”. Throughout the main text, Maya, Nahuatl, and Spanish words appear in ital-ics upon their first appearance only. Finally, all biblical citations are from the New American Bible (NAB) as it is employed in English- speaking American Catholic churches today."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THETEABOMANUSCRIPT"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n ✢ 1IntroductionCOLONIAL TEXTS AND MAYA CHRISTIAN COPYBOOKS[i]t is in the colonial literatUre of yUcatan that we mUst search for the main clUes to the literary Past of the first ranking civilization of the americas.—MUnro S. Edmonson (1971)1For years the Maya and their writings have captured the attention of the general public and scholars alike. The drawings of nineteenth- century explorer Frederick Catherwood depicting the great buildings and monuments of the ancient Maya laced with hieroglyphs ignited the Western world’s fascination with this “lost culture.” It seemed as though the Maya had been busily writing for centuries, but what did they write about? Although scholars have since made astounding achievements in “breaking the Maya code” to read the hieroglyphs, today the question remains in the minds of scholars and the public alike and even provided fodder for the recent 2012 doomsday craze.2Although forced to share the Yucatan Peninsula with the Spaniards, the colonial Maya nevertheless continued their tradition of writing, albeit in the Roman alphabet.3 Scholars have made important inroads into understanding what the colonial Maya wrote, uncovering documents ranging from the mun-dane bill of sale to the seemingly esoteric writings found in what have been termed the Books of Chilam Balam (Maya- authored manuscripts relating various topics important to Maya culture). Yet despite such progress, when-ever a scholar approaches a Maya document, the basic question resurfaces: “What did they write about?” It was this question that bounded throughout my head as I held a curious Maya manuscript in the summer of 2012.While visiting family in Utah, I decided to spend some time at Brigham"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tYoung University to see some of my undergraduate professors and explore the L. Tom Perry Special Collections. I was particularly interested in a collection titled “Biography of William E. Gates, 1863–1940” (MSS 279). Through-out his career studying the Maya, Gates collected an impressive amount of material that included Maya manuscripts from the colonial period. During his lifetime and upon his death, Gates’s collection found its way into various universities, including Princeton, Tulane, and Brigham Young. In 1946 BYU purchased a portion of the collection, which today consists of 117 boxes of documents, manuscripts, photocopies, grammars, personal correspondence, and other materials. Included in this collection is a forty- four- page manu-script written in Yucatec Maya that was originally (mis)cataloged as a “Chris-tian doctrine.” Upon closer examination of the text to see what its Maya au-thor(s) was saying, I discovered that it was much more.Like many manuscript copybooks of its time, this particular manuscript is a collection of discourses written on large sheets of paper. The dimensions are certainly not uniform, but the rough size of the eleven sheets is 21 cm x 33 cm. The sheets are folded in half to create a sewn gathering of 22 folios, or 44 pages, with each folded page measuring approximately 21 cm x 16.5 cm.4 The sheets are composed of a handmade laid paper, likely made from linen fibers, with no watermarks present. The ink is brown and appears to be iron gall ink written in several hands using various ink recipes. Water damage has caused severe tidelines (stains) on nearly every page. The head conservator for rare books and manuscripts at Brigham Young’s Harold B. Lee Library, Kohleen Jones, confidently places the manuscript in the eighteenth or early nineteenth century.The manuscript has various thematic sections. The first contains a redac-tion of the creation of the world and the Fall of Adam and Eve. Following this section is the genealogy of Christ taken from the Bible and eschatologi-cal material including a Maya rendition of the European apocalyptic text The Fifteen Signs before Doomsday. The manuscript then contains a devotional anthem and invocation to both Mary and Christ—discourses that readily ap-peared throughout European books of hours—and a passage on indulgences that loosely resembles the “Papal instructions for avoiding purgatory” found in the Chilam Balam of Kaua. Finally, the manuscript concludes with a few medicinal remedies for common ailments that seem to have been appended in the early twentieth century, one of which includes the entry “Teabo 8 de Enero de 1911.”This book brings to light this unstudied Maya manuscript, referred to hereafter as the “Teabo Manuscript,” through a translation and analysis of its contents. At its heart, this book reveals what the Maya of Teabo deemed"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n ✢ 3important enough to write about and preserve. In the process, the study employs the Teabo Manuscript as a platform from which to explore various topics including the evangelization of the Maya, their literary compositions, and the aspects of Christianity they contained. The study also utilizes the Teabo Manuscript to expose, in many cases for the first time, connections be-tween other religious texts, both European and Maya, and their authors, thus sharpening the scholarly image of colonial writing among the Maya. Finally, the manuscript’s death record and medicinal remedies illuminate further the dualistic nature of such texts and their authors, the texts being products of both the individual and corporate realm, and the authors as oftentimes being responsible for maintaining both the spiritual and physical well- being of the cah, or Maya town (plural cahob). In the end, this book endeavors to analyze and contextualize the Teabo Manuscript in a way that contributes valuable elements to the elusive, fluid, and multifaceted answer regarding what the colonial Maya wrote about and why.Colonial Maya TextsAlthough Spaniards had contact with the Yucatec Maya with some regularity beginning in 1517, the military conquest of Yucatan was a lengthy process in-volving various entradas that did not end until the establishment of Yucatan’s capital, Merida, in 1542. This is not to say that the Maya were then “con-quered” or that subsequent “revolts” were not actually products of an unfin-ished conquest, or even that the Yucatan Peninsula was entirely secured by the Spanish. Much of the area would remain unconquered, or what the Spanish preferred to refer to as territory despoblado (“uninhabited”) to disguise their inability to subdue the area’s population.5This delay in military subjugation also delayed evangelization efforts. The Franciscans dominated such efforts and waited until 1545 to obtain a firm foothold in Yucatan, although their numbers remained low throughout the colonial period, with Yucatan receiving only 2.9 percent of all friars sent from Spain by the crown.6 Once there, they immediately began establishing convents and schools, the latter constituting an essential component in con-verting the Maya.7 In his Historia de Yucatán, Juan Francisco Molina Solís poetically stated:In the shadow of the cathedral, and in each one of the monasteries scattered throughout all the territory of the peninsula, schools (for the Maya) were opened; and this was not an accidental or isolated work, but premeditated and carried out with a thoughtful and shrewd plan.8"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"4 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tLarger convent schools established where ecclesiastics resided—first in Cam-peche, Merida, and Mani—recruited the sons of the Maya nobility of the surrounding region to reside in their schools as boarders. Molina Solís fur-ther claims that even the smaller towns, the pueblos de visita, had day schools equipped, among other things, with a Maya instructor or maestro.9 In the colonial schools, the youth of the Maya nobility were taught to read and write in the Roman alphabet and also instructed in the Christian doctrine.10Some of the Maya trained in the schools left to become maestros in the towns, charged with the responsibility of instructing the youth in the Catho-lic doctrine and even of serving as surrogate priests in the frequent absence of the ecclesiastic.11 Indeed, scattered throughout the late sixteenth- century reports of encomenderos given in response to Philip II’s questionnaire, and known as the Relaciones Geográficas, is the general phrase, “In this town there is a school for young boys where they are taught to read and write and who have their maestro.”12 Furthermore, documents from the early Franciscans and ecclesiastics testify to their reliance on these native assistants, whose re-sponsibilities could include baptizing the sick and dying infants, hearing con-fessions of those in their last extremity, delivering sermons and conducting church business on Sundays, and the general policing of the community’s spiritual nature.13 The maestros served as intermediaries and “go betweens” among the foreign religious/colonial hierarchy and the native town. These trained maestros also assisted ecclesiastics in composing religious texts in Maya such as catechisms, sermons, and doctrinal treatises.14 Perhaps the most famous example is Gaspar Antonio Chi, who in a probanza de mérito (proof of merit) sent to the king of Spain stated:[I have] performed great services for God and Your Majesty in order to bring about the conversion of the natives of this province . . . and, as re-quested by the said friars, translated and wrote sermons in the Indians’ language in order to preach to them.15Prior to the arrival of the Spanish, the Maya nobility maintained the spiritual and physical well- being of their cahob through various positions, including that of the ah kin (traditional Maya priest) and ah dzib cah (town scribe). Many of the nobility saw opportunity in the new colonial structure to maintain these positions of religious and intellectual authority, oftentimes as maestros and escribanos (scribes) respectively in the local town council, or cabildo. In the eighteenth century, ecclesiastical officials would even complain that many towns had too many native officers, stipulating that there should be only two instructors of the doctrine and both over the age of fifty.16 Re-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n ✢ 5garding the escribano, the Maya endowed the position with a rank equal to that of the local native leader, or batab. Interestingly, this deviated from Span-ish practice where the escribano held the lowest position in the cabildo hier-archy and thus illustrates the important position of the literate Maya in their communities. Once trained in literacy, the nobility of each town continued to monopolize the positions of maestro and escribano—the only two cabildo positions that required a knowledge of writing—teaching the necessary skills to hand- picked successors.17Despite their training in and close connection to a Spanish worldview, maestros and escribanos were not simple partisans. Some became diligent followers and enforcers of the Faith, others rebelled against it, and still others (perhaps the majority) strove to negotiate between the old and the new. As one scholar states, “The Franciscans had formed a Maya youth, but they did not consider that the environment to which they returned had not changed.”18 Put another way, upon returning to the Maya town, the trained Maya reentered a life vastly different from the one experienced in the friars’ boarding schools, and this often required negotiating the old with the new. Armed with the tools of both literacy and a general autonomy from direct ecclesiastic supervision, both maestros and escribanos would play a large role in determining the written record and religious experience of many native towns, particularly those lacking a resident ecclesiastic.19Overall, the schools instructed the next generation of Maya rulers in the doctrine and details associated with a Spanish/Catholic colonial world. The Maya students learned how to compose bills of sale, testaments, and even religious texts. They became versed on how to maintain reports, keep financial records, and create petitions. Moreover, they had access to Euro-pean texts—the extent of which depended on the size of the church’s and ecclesiastics’ personal libraries. Perhaps most importantly, these schools en-dowed the Maya with the tools to negotiate a world filled with new actors, rules, and religious beliefs. And these tools helped construct a Maya Chris-tian worldview evinced in the documents, both religious and mundane, that they would produce.20Elsewhere I have grouped native- language religious texts into three gen-eral categories.21 Category 1 texts are printed texts composed by either eccle-siastics, native aides, or both and intended for a readership of ecclesiastics and natives alike. To ensure their orthodoxy, such texts underwent strict review and a process of licensing that required the approval of various ecclesiastical and civic authorities.22 Category 2 texts concern handwritten texts authored by ecclesiastics, native aides, or both and designed for the use and local read-ership of primarily ecclesiastics and at times natives. Category 3 regards texts"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"6 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p twritten largely by natives for natives. Although it is possible that some eccle-siastics, certainly those of a more lenient nature, were aware of such texts or even assisted in their composition at some stage, they were not the intended users or audience, nor did they play a role in the texts’ preservation, recopy-ing, and iteration. Because of the strict editorial scrutiny of printed texts in Category 1 and the involvement of ecclesiastics as either authors or audience for Category 2 texts, the literary products of these categories generally con-tained little or no unorthodox content. However, the general autonomous nature of Category 3 texts afforded them greater opportunity to deviate from the standard messages as a product of either cultural adaptations, personal/local preferences, or both.23Ecclesiastical authorities, however, were not naïve to this, and they took steps to try and regulate the content and quality of religious texts. Indeed, they were aware of the potential errors and alterations that could arise from allowing native assistants too much autonomy in translating and composing religious texts. Thus, the initial leniency granted toward native involvement in the translation and composition of Christian texts ended. The First and Second Mexican Provincial Councils of 1555 and 1565 respectively both re-stricted severely the natives’ involvement in the translation process and even their possession of native- language Christian texts. Indeed, the First Coun-cil stated:We have found grave mistakes that continue in the native language ser-mons, as from not understanding them and from the errors and mis-takes they (the natives) make when they translate them. Therefore, we state and order that from now on no sermons be given to the Indians to translate, neither to have in their possession, and those that have them are to be taken away. And when some good documents or sermons have to be given to them, let them be such that their (the natives’) capacity can comprehend and understand, and carry the signatures of the reli-gious or minister who gave it to them, so that they (the natives) cannot falsify nor corrupt them.24Generally speaking, natives were not to translate or possess any handwritten religious text without direct authorization from an ecclesiastic, and they were not to create their own religious texts.Reflecting this concern of natives writing autonomously and possessing religious texts is a 1570s Inquisition questionnaire regarding, among other things, whether or not to prohibit the natives’ possession of translated texts. The questionnaire was given to a few select ecclesiastics chosen for their lan-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n ✢ 7guage abilities. Regarding the possession of religious texts, fray Domingo de la Anunciación responded by saying, “handwritten [books] should be totally prohibited from them because we have experience that all of the native- authored handwritten books have a thousand errors both in the writing and in the material they relate.” However, ecclesiastics were more trusting of Category 1 printed texts, and Anunciacíon states that certain ones, such as Molina’s confessional manuals and his own large and small doctrinas (cate-chisms), could “confidently” be left among natives.25 In a word, natives were not officially authorized to compose and maintain autonomously their own Christian texts, those of Category 3, because, as William Hanks argues for the Chilam Balams, they were written “outside the spheres of governance and mission.”26 But this does not mean that such texts ceased to exist. In reality, Yucatan and its evangelization depended heavily on native- authored and handwritten manuscripts—an understandable trait when considering that, unlike Mexico City, a printing press would not be available until 1813.27 Religious authori-ties reported confiscating a wide variety of unauthorized texts ranging from hieroglyphic codices to Maya- authored religious texts of a Category 3 nature (see Map 0.1). Late sixteenth- century Inquisition reports from Yucatan in-dicate that translated religious texts were found “in the possession of some MAP 0.1. Hieroglyphic and Alphabetic Maya Texts Confiscated, 1560–1750 (after Chuchiak 2004)"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"8 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tIndians who know how to read.”28 Diego López de Cogolludo and Pedro Sánchez de Aguilar both recount instances where Maya- authored cartapa-cios (copybooks) were confiscated from the Maya. And fray Diego de Landa mentioned that he had collected various handwritten sermons in Maya whose contents displeased him.29 The same occurred in the highlands of Guatemala, where the K’iche’ Codex—a colonial manuscript containing three calendar sequences modeled after the hieroglyphic screenfold books of the Maya—was penned. Commenting on the author of the Codex, Pedro Cortés y Lá rraz, who served as archbishop of Guatemala from 1766 to 1779, stated, “I am in-formed that he was a choirmaster (maestro).”30Such texts are invaluable to modern scholars for their ability to reveal a Maya interpretation of a colonial Christian world. In regard to the Teabo Manuscript, it is possible that ecclesiastics may have worked alongside native aides during the original composition of some of the texts it includes (it is always difficult to speak in absolutes when dealing with the unofficial). Yet the natives ultimately owned the texts’ preservation, emendation, and itera-tion throughout the years with an eye toward a local native audience. It was they who determined decade after decade what the manuscript would con-tain, what to re cord, or, better, what aspects of Christianity they deemed im-portant enough to preserve and incorporate. Thus, I agree with Hanks when stating that the function of the writers or copyists of such unofficial texts which lay beyond the supervised sphere of reducción “was authorlike insofar as they chose the themes, words, and sentiments expressed.”31 Today, such Category 3 texts are limited in number, but to this corpus the Teabo Manu-script adds one more.Maya Texts, Ethnohistory, and Purposes of This BookHaving established that the Maya composed a wide variety of colonial texts, including those religious, we now return to the question we began with: “What did they write about?” Beginning in the 1830s and 1840s and pro-ceeding into the early twentieth century, various scholars including Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, Carl Hermann Berendt, Crescencio Carillo y Ancona, and William Gates strove to answer such a question by collecting, transcribing, and translating a variety of Maya writings. Particularly pro-lific, Ralph Roys produced transcriptions and translations of myriad colonial Maya texts that enabled him to author numerous articles and books between 1920 and 1965. His transcriptions and translations of colonial Maya docu-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n ✢ 9ments ranging from medicinal and botanical treatises to mundane land sales are still employed by scholars today.32Anthropologists such as Munro S. Edmonson and Victoria Bricker at Tulane took up the torch and employed “the [Maya’s] literary documents of the sixteenth century and later” as a “primary window open on the America of aboriginal times.”33 The Books of Chilam Balam attracted the most atten-tion during this time—particularly in the 1980s.34 Although such studies furthered the use of colonial Maya texts, the texts were largely used, as Edmonson’s quote at the beginning of the chapter illustrates, as a source of information on the precolonial past, with the colonial era receiving secondary attention. Emphasis was placed on Maya science, medicine, and calendrics. Linguistic and anthropological studies dominated this era, and pioneering breakthroughs occurred in our understanding of colonial Yucatec Maya as a language and writing system and its relationship to the past and present gen-erations.35 Yet a social history of the colonial Maya obtained primarily from their sources had yet to be achieved.To be sure, the colonial period won attention from scholars throughout the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in a variety of seminal works on Maya colonial society such as Robert Patch’s 1979 dissertation that would later become his 1993 Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1648–1812, Nancy Farriss’s Maya Society under Colonial Rule (1984), and Grant Jones’s Maya Resistance to Spanish Rule (1989). Yet the focus largely remained on Spanish sources. An important ana-lytical re- creation of colonial Maya culture through their colonial texts ap-peared with the 1978 dissertation of a Bricker student, Philip C. Thompson. His study utilized a large corpus of Maya testaments and bills of sale origi-nating from the eighteenth- century town of Tekanto to produce a documen-tary ethnography of the town and its people. Thompson used the sources to uncover inheritance patterns, kinship terminology, and class structure and its relationship to political office.36Thompson’s study was seminal in another way: it cast a brighter spot-light on the importance and utility of mundane Maya texts. Certainly schol-ars knew of their existence—Roys made this clear with his 1939 Titles of Ebtun. Yet, generally speaking, they were overshadowed by more monu-mental, seemingly more interesting works such as the Chilam Balams or the Ritual of the Bacabs. Like Thompson, Matthew Restall exploited the bene-fits of mundane documentation in his 1992 dissertation “The World of the Cah,” later to become The Maya World (1997). Whereas Thompson examined Tekanto, Restall expanded his scope to employ a wide variety of documenta-tion from various regions throughout Yucatan to expose the centrality of the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"10 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tMaya’s sociopolitical unit, the cah, in the lives of the colonial Maya. It repre-sents the first social history employing native- language sources to encompass the colonial Yucatec Maya as a whole, or as James Lockhart would put it, to “see the general within the particular.”37Twenty- first- century studies utilizing Maya documents involve a wide range of documentation from Chilam Balam texts to testaments, and al-though the precolonial Maya still receive attention, particularly from an-thropologists, the colonial Maya increasingly appear. For example, Victoria Bricker and Helga- Maria Miram’s important study on the Chilam Balam of Kaua (2002) and Laura Caso Barrera’s work on the Chilam Balam of Ixil (2011), while detailing colonial connections to the precolonial past, also ex-plore a colonial world in which Spanish systems had significantly influenced Maya culture.38 Along with the continued ethnohistorical works of Restall, John Chuchiak has also made good use of both Spanish and Maya texts to produce an impressive collection of articles and book chapters detailing the contributions of the Maya in colonial society.39 Moreover, the increase of known and accessible Maya texts has allowed for comparisons among the texts themselves; the works of Timothy Knowlton (2008, 2010) and my-self (2013, 2014), among others, both fall into this category. Finally, in 2010 Hanks produced his seminal Converting Words, which examines the forma-tion and spread of a Maya reducido or Christianized Maya. Connections with his work in general are made here throughout, but, significantly, his chapter examining the Chilam Balams “reverses a long scholarly tradition in which these works are read for their pre- Columbian content, not for their value as an index of colonial transformation.”40It is in this general vein of thought that I place this book. Although pre-colonial connections are noted, this book concentrates more on what the Teabo Manuscript can tell us about the colonial Maya, their writing, and their religious worldview. To achieve this, I have divided the translation of the manuscript into chapters with substantial introductions. Traditionally, studies on colonial Maya codices contain a single lengthy introduction fol-lowed by the entire translation, albeit with extensive footnotes. However, in the case of the Teabo Manuscript, dividing the translation into specific sec-tions with separate introductions followed by a translation of the Maya text, as will be done here, reveals better the contributions and insights the manu-script has to offer on the colonial Maya. In addition, while I employ philologi-cal analyses on occasion to reveal specific insights, particularly in the notes, this book’s overall focus is more historical than linguistic and thus, in general, I leave a thorough linguistic study to future works whose scope include such.The following chapters explore the Teabo Manuscript and its connections"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n ✢ 11with other Maya and European texts that served as archetypes in the hope of achieving two broad purposes. The first concerns the exposure and recogni-tion of the existence of Maya Christian copybooks, their cognate texts,41 and the valuable and uncommon insight they provide into the Maya Christian worldview the colonial Maya chose to re cord and preserve. As mentioned, many extant studies on Maya texts concern the Books of Chilam Balam.42 To be sure, these works are important, but they should not eclipse the other significant works the Maya composed in their communities. The comparative examination of the Teabo Manuscript with other Maya- authored works pro-vides new insights into colonial text production and the shared yet distinct experience the colonial Maya had with Catholicism while further exposing the role of the Maya, particularly the authors and copyists of such works, in determining what that experience entailed.The second purpose regards exposing in new ways the impact and in-fluence of European texts on those the Maya composed. Bricker and Miram truly illustrated the potential for this type of work with their examination of the Kaua (2002). Certainly, the fascination of religious texts in native lan-guages can limit studies to the boundaries of New Spain to overlook European antecedents.43 Moreover, the exact European texts employed often remain nebulous, although cultural, philological, and orthographic clues indicate their influential presence.44 None of the Maya texts of the Teabo Manuscript occurred in an intellectual vacuum, and all received inspiration, either direct or indirect, from both Maya and European cultural and textual antecedents. As such, the genealogies of many of the texts included in the Teabo Manu-script expose with greater clarity the need to examine New World texts in light of their Old World originals. Only then can we truly begin to appreciate how the Maya made Christianity their own and the rich history, context, and cultural adaptation contained within native- language texts.45The chapters follow the thematic sections of the manuscript and further develop various concepts introduced here.46 Chapter 1 concerns a redaction of Genesis and the creation of the world, and partial cognate texts can be found in the Chilam Balams of Kaua, Chan Kan, and the Morley Manu-script. In fact, the Teabo Manuscript offers the most complete translation of this redaction, and the four separate accounts allow for an uncommon oppor-tunity for comparative analyses. The chapter also employs this commentary on Genesis to examine its presence in various works and to discuss further colonial text production and text sharing and iteration among Maya texts. Although scholars have recognized the trend among the Books of Chilam Balam, little or nothing exists discussing text sharing outside those famous texts. Here, the chapter engages Hanks’s work (2010) on the creation and"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"12 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tdissemination of a Maya reducido to add further insight. Finally, the chap-ter exposes the important role the Creation played in evangelization and the various influences European texts and worldview had on the Maya account.Chapter 2 addresses the manuscript’s subsequent Christocentric material that includes a genealogy of Jesus Christ taken from Matthew 1 in the Bible and an apocalyptic discourse inspired by the parable of the sheep and goats found in Matthew 25. In regard to the latter, the Tusik and, to a lesser de-gree, Chumayel contain similar texts, thus further exposing the presence of text sharing among Maya documents. Chapter 3 continues the apocalyp-tic theme with the translation of a popular European text: The Fifteen Signs before Doomsday. Gretchen Whalen’s work on the Morley Manuscript pro-vides an important yet preliminary discussion of the signs, stating that they were similar to those in the Tusik. Moreover, she reported not having seen the signs in Nahuatl texts. Fortunately, I succeeded in finding the signs in various Nahuatl texts, and this chapter provides an extensive analysis of the signs as they appear in Maya, Nahuatl, and European works that allows for new insights on the adoption of Christian eschatology into native cultures and text sharing.Chapter 4 examines the next section of the Teabo Manuscript, which contains a supplication to both Mary and Christ for their mercy and divine aid. This chapter also discusses what appears to be a Maya discourse on in-dulgences and places it in the historical context of colonial Yucatan and New Spain, where such bulls experienced great popularity. Finally, Chapter 5 ex-amines the various annotations and entries appended during the twentieth century that appear throughout the manuscript. This includes a death record and various medicinal remedies for common ailments. The chapter provides an analysis of both death and medicinal record keeping among the Maya to better understand the contributions of the Teabo Manuscript in this regard. Moreover, the entries themselves provide additional insight on the paradoxi-cal individual- and cah- specific nature of these copybooks and their mainte-nance over the years.A Chilam Balam or a Maya Christian Copybook?Among its other contributions, this book calls attention to a category of Maya manuscripts I term the “Maya Christian copybook.” Most cah- preserved manuscripts containing various religious or historical entries have fallen into the nebulous category of Chilam Balam texts. Scholars differ in their quali-fications of what makes a text a “Chilam Balam.” Originally, the term ap-plied to colonial Maya manuscripts that contained the prophecy of a Maya"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"i n t r o d u c t i o n ✢ 13prophet, or chilam, with the surname Balam who lived during the eve of the Spanish arrival, an event he reportedly prophesied. Certain works, such as the Chilam Balams of Tizimin and Chumayel, contain the prophecies of the prophet. Yet over the years, the term became applied to most of the town- preserved codices scholars discovered, regardless of whether or not they con-tained the prophecy of Chilam Balam.47 As a result, the majority of manu-scripts granted the name “Chilam Balam” make no mention of the prophet whatsoever.The Teabo Manuscript itself provides an apt example of the tendency to award the Chilam Balam label to such codices. Although Teabo produced the Chilam Balam of Na48 and perhaps even the Tekax, which, in another ex-ample of text sharing, served as a model for the Na,49 rumors have long existed of Teabo having produced other unknown Chilam Balams. In the 1920s, Jean Genet and Pierre Chelbatz described a Chilam Balam for Teabo of twenty pages that contained historical accounts and whose location is unknown.50 In their 1948 work examining the Chilam Balams, Alfredo Barrera Vásquez and Silvia Rendón indicated that rumors existed regarding the possible existence of lost Chilam Balams of Teabo, Peto, Nabula, Tihosuco, Tixkokob, Hocaba, and Oxkutzcab.51 Moreover, at one point Munro Edmonson commented that while examining the Gates material—from whence came the Teabo Manu-script—he had come across several Chilam Balam texts from Teabo.52 Al-though it is uncertain what specific texts these scholars were referring to when making such claims, it is likely, particularly in the case of Ed mon son, that the Teabo Manuscript was initially referred to as a Chilam Balam.So what, then, are the Books of Chilam Balam? Simply put, they are manuscript compilations of various topics deemed important enough by their authors, likely including maestros, and cah to re cord in writing. In a way, these books are bound portions of a larger archive of material—indigenous, European, or both—available to the Maya authors and/or cah.53 This, then, allows for a cah to have multiple copies of any given text circulating in various manuscripts. Due to the central nature of the cah in producing these texts, most Chilam Balams carry the name of the town in which they were found (see Map 0.2). Because the Maya rewrote and amended the manuscripts mul-tiple times throughout the colonial period, the versions available to scholars today are commonly late eighteenth- to nineteenth- century issues of early colonial originals.54The content of the Chilam Balams vary from text to text and can include anything from town histories to calendrics, medicinal remedies, or doctrinal tracts.55 Many Chilam Balams derived their content from similar sources, allowing, for example, the Teabo and Morley Manuscript and the Chilam"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"14 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tBalams of Kaua and Chan Kan to all share cognate passages on the creation of the world.56 Because ecclesiastical officials technically forbade natives from possessing and creating their own religious texts, these manuscripts remained hidden from questioning eyes, and only nine are known to scholars today.57Yet not all texts compiled and preserved by Maya towns can or should be classified as Chilam Balams.58 In recent years, scholars have increasingly recognized the existence of handwritten religious manuscripts that con-tained compilations of selected religious texts deriving from Christianity. Maya trained in writing and the Christian religion in the schools compiled these religious copybooks that were subsequently rewritten and amended over the course of the colonial period. Interestingly, some of the material in such works also appears in Chilam Balam texts. Perhaps the most well- known religious copybook is the Morley Manuscript initially examined by Gretchen Whalen.59 Timothy Knowlton describes the work as “sort of a ‘missing link’ between the Books of the Chilam Balam and Christian doctrinal works pro-duced by the Franciscans.”60 Due to their importance and maintenance by local Maya within the cah, the copybooks occasionally contain annotations in the final pages or the margins of the book detailing death records and, at times, a few medicinal remedies. Just as someone might re cord the baptismal MAP 0.2.

Moreover, although the compilers of Maya Christian copybooks were surely aware of the Chilam Balam manuscripts, they chose to select and in-clude in their works only texts of a religious nature, thus differentiating them from Chilam Balam texts.And there are other manuscripts besides that of the Morley and Teabo which likewise testify to a genre of Maya Christian copybooks distinct from Chilam Balams (see Table 0.1). The Garrett- Gates Mesoamerican Manu-scripts Collection at Princeton University (GGMM) contains several ex-amples, all of which date from the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries. Two are Maya books containing various prayers and texts; one—no. 71—is from Teabo, the other—no. 72—has death records from Tekom and makes refer-ences to Chichimila. The latter contains a section with instructions written in a Maya hand on how to help someone in the last extremity. The Maya reader is instructed to immediately call for a priest authorized to confess, and that if it were an emergency he should read the prayers included in the text.61 Although escribanos likewise contributed to the creation and pres-ervation of such copybook texts, the instructions appear to be for a Maya maestro charged with such duties. In fact, in his instructions to ecclesiastics, the sixteenth- century bishop of Yucatan, fray Francisco de Toral, outlined the role of maestros, who he calls in Maya ah cambeçah (he who teaches), in helping other Mayas to die well. Due to their importance in this regard, he stated, “And the ah cambeçah and others who likewise help [the sick] to die well are highly valued before our lord God.”62 This role for maestros con-tinued throughout the colonial period.63 Another example, but from an unknown town, is a likely eighteenth- century copybook (GGMM no. 65, hereafter referred to as “Maya Sermons”) of seventy- two folios containing a variety of Christian texts that includes a “libro de matrimonio de predicasiones de pariende” and portions of the Flos sanctorum, a popular hagiography in Spain. One of the texts is a Maya ver-sion of the The Fifteen Signs before Doomsday. Interestingly, similar passages of this text can also be found in the Teabo and Morley Manuscripts and the Chilam Balam of Tusik.

The Maya stories and eschatological discussion derived from hagiographies and texts popu-lar throughout the Middle Ages such as Jacobus de Voragine’s The Golden Legend (ca. 1260)—with the Flos sanctorum being the Spanish version—and the Bible.64An additional Maya Christian copybook from Teabo is a manuscript that consists of a Maya redaction of the Passion (GGMM no. 66, hereafter “Pas-sion Text”), followed by instructions for the Mass that has cognate texts in the Kaua and Chan Kan.65 Still another small manuscript text from Teabo is a leather- bound Maya translation of the seventeenth- century Ramillete de Table 0.1.

One final example is a manuscript of unknown provenance of which various images were found among the Mayanist Ian Graham’s papers at the Peabody Museum in Harvard.68As mentioned, many of these manuscripts have cognate texts with vari-ous Books of Chilam Balam. But do they belong under the same category? In discussing the matter with David Bolles, he commented,There really should be a separate classification for this sort of literature because little or none of it is based on Pre- Columbian thought, which is what I think the term “Book of Chilam Balam” should be applied to . . . Naming everything that is written in the Yucatecan Mayan language as “The Book of Chilam Balam of . . .” doesn’t tell us much about the work anymore because it is used to name a wide variety of books with not all the same subject matter.69Thus, I have classified such manuscripts as the Teabo, Morley, and those mentioned above as “Maya Christian copybooks.” Of course, I realize that such classifications and distinctions were not employed by the colonial Maya in such a way and that they are for the main convenience of modern re-searchers who, like myself, have an insatiable need to categorize everything. The content matter of both Chilam Balams and Maya Christian copybooks appeared equally important to the Maya and oftentimes flowed freely be-tween one genre of texts to the other. Yet the fact remains that Maya manu-scripts containing purely Christian content exist today, and for the sake of convenience, I have chosen to classify them as Maya Christian copybooks.These copybooks provide valuable information on colonial text produc-tion, culture, and religion. Their compilers, preservers, and audience were cer-tainly Maya, thus making them Category 3 texts. However, it cannot be said for certain that local ecclesiastics were not aware of their existence.

With rare exception, these copybooks have gone largely unstudied and represent a significant gap in the historiography concerning Maya evangelization, religion, and text pro-duction in the colonial period.72 This book endeavors to begin to fill that gap.General Observations about the Teabo ManuscriptThe surviving corpus of Maya texts, particularly Maya Christian copybooks, points to Teabo as an active producer of colonial manuscripts (see Table 0.2). The town resides in the Tutul Xiu territory and was a visita town of Mani in 1582, eventually becoming a cabecera de doctrina, the principal town of a district, by 1610.73 By 1617 the Franciscans established a modest church for native worship and later in the seventeenth century completed the convent church of San Pedro y San Pablo, which housed eight resident friars in 1808 and stands today, albeit with a fairly recent coat of red paint.74 Teabo was the Table 0.2.

Although larger sites such as Merida, Campeche, and Izamal boasted more resident priests, the ecclesiastic presence in 1808 of Teabo’s convent appears comparable for the time with towns such as Mani, Conkal, Motul, Oxkutzcab, and others having a similar number of friars. Thus, it seems un-likely that the number of texts available today from Teabo was due to any additional ecclesiastical presence. Nor was it exceptional for its religious devo-tion. Indeed, as late as the 1790s fray José Perdomo, the Guardian or religious superior of the Franciscans in Teabo, imprisoned a native for idolatry.75 And in the 1980s, a select population of Teabo—primarily the elderly—still con-tinued its agricultural rites to precontact deities.76 In the end, it is likely that Teabo produced similar quantities of texts to that of other cahob, but collec-tors, such as Gates, had the most luck in acquiring those from Teabo.Regarding the Teabo Manuscript itself, the paper appears to be that of the eighteenth or early nineteenth century, but the orthography extends into the twentieth century. Moreover, a number of dates appear throughout the text from 1802 to 1925. Thus the manuscript has been copied and amended mul-tiple times, the final occurrence being in the twentieth century, until some-how it fell into Gates’s possession. Fortunately, the line “Teabo 8 de Enero de 1911” appears in the final pages of the manuscript to confirm its origin.Concerning its author(s), many Maya Christian copybooks and Books of Chilam Balam lack an identifiable author. As Hanks states, “If by ‘author’ we designate the starting point in the production of a text—its source—then few of the major works have neatly defined authors. Rather, they are the product of recopying and reworking over long periods.”77 Some authors, like José Secundino Na and José María Na in the Na, openly took responsibility for their role. Others invented their sources out of whole cloth, or simply alluded to them. The Ixil provides examples of both. The book declares that its medicinal remedies were “given by a moor, by his own voice, Ruy Díaz de Vivar (El Cid).”78 El Cid was a Spanish nobleman and the great military leader of medieval Spain and his published legend was popular, although prohibited, reading throughout New Spain. Here, the Maya of Ixil obviously knew of the legend and elected the Campeador as the source of the remedies while obscuring the true author. Moreover, inserted at the bottom of one of its pages is the line, “yo proveye junn yPolito Pech (rubric), (I supplied the paper/book, Hipólito Pech).79 Although we cannot be certain as to the spe-cific role of Hipólito, the insertion indicates the role of the Pech chibal (lin-"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"20 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p teage) in the book’s composition. In the end, when no clear assertions are avail-able, we are left to surmise the identity of the author(s). However, analyses of orthography, prose, and hand can be used to assist in making observations, and such is the case with the Teabo Manuscript.The following appears at the end of the Teabo Manuscript’s redaction of The Fifteen Signs before Doomsday:dia 11 de Desienbre de 1803 años caa ti ɔoci yn canbal hoksic hunpel libro Gensis u kaba u tial txocol Ca u sates ten yn yum Max bin y ylic ua yan Kasite ten u . . .80(The 11th of December 1803, when I finished learning to bring forth a book called Genesis in order for it to be read.

Given that the entry in the Teabo Manuscript appeared less than one month after that in the Passion Text, and that both originate from Teabo, it seems very plausible that Baltasar Mutul was aware of the Teabo Manu-script's compilation although his hand is difficult to locate in the manuscript itself. That said, changes in orthography, prose, and ink throughout the text suggest the hands of various contributors. Although inconsistencies in any given author’s calligraphy and orthography make such analyses an inexact sci-ence, it appears that at least two Maya authors penned the doctrinal texts of the Teabo Manuscript. Moreover, the death record and the random medici-nal remedies appear in different hands.Thus, like other Maya Christian copybooks, the Teabo Manuscript had multiple contributors. That such copybooks were preserved by the cah and exchanged hands is also made clear by the “Passion Text.” Although Baltasar FIGURE 0.2.

Two or more Maya authors likely compiled the work in the early nineteenth century from various existing sources, and it was then preserved and appended throughout the early twentieth century until it fell into the possession of Gates.

They are inscribed on stone walls, written on forms of paper, and spoken on the tongues of many different cultures. From the Romans to the Egyptians, the Norse to the Greeks, Christians to Buddhists, each group maintained stories of their origin. Why? The complicated answer to that question lies far beyond the scope of this chapter. But perhaps it is sufficient to say that creation myths slake our inherent thirst to understand our role and place in the world, where we came from, why we are here, and what happens next. In other words, we want to know the beginning, middle, and end of the plot, or as Aristotle would have it, the mythos, of life. However, creation myths go far beyond the satisfaction of curiosity. Indeed, creation myths define a culture’s place and purpose in both the world and the overall cosmos. They explain and justify a culture’s belief system and worldview while ultimately validating the exis-tence of such in the presence of others.4Both before and after the arrival of the Spaniards, the Maya maintained various versions of the creation of the world. Much of what we understand of these creation myths derives from colonial documents. Yet hieroglyphic writ-ing from the precontact era, although terse, suggests a “larger body of cultural knowledge about creation events.”5 Moreover, as Knowlton aptly illustrates, such precontact writing and iconography informs our understanding of and gives additional meaning to the creation myths found in the Chilam Balams and those recorded by Spaniards.6Like colonial documents, precontact recordings of the creation under-scored sociopolitical, familial, religious, and local identity, thus preventing a single, monolithic Maya creation story. Commenting on hieroglyphic texts recounting the creation, David Stuart notes, “[W ]e see that the Creation was very local in its flavor, with different kingdoms and cities claiming different supernatural origins, each a center of the cosmos in its own way.”7 Notwith-standing, creation myths across Mesoamerica do share general similarities. For example, many shared the concept of an evolving creation with cosmo-gonic ages or suns, each with different versions of human beings, preceding the current era that too will eventually end in disaster to produce a new era. Humans had the responsibility to maintain the order of these cosmos through rites and sacrifices, thus creating a symbiotic relationship between man and the divine.8The Popol Vuh, a colonial manuscript relating a creation narrative in K’iche’ Maya, illustrates many of these elements. In his translation of the manuscript, Allen Christenson states: “It is important to remember that the Popol Vuh was written by representatives of the Nima Quiché nobility and"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 27there was little attempt at objective ‘history’ in the modern sense. The au-thors’ purpose in compiling this record is, at least in part, to bolster the legitimacy and traditions of their own lineages, often at the expense of their neighboring rivals.”9 Thus, like many Maya creation myths whether recorded on precontact stelae or eighteenth- century paper, the Popol Vuh is a Maya ver-sion of the creation as told by a specific lineage, not the Maya version—the importance of which is discussed later.10In this version, the evolutionary efforts of the gods in creating humans is evident. Following various failed attempts, they succeeded in creating man from maize dough. The purpose of man was to care for the earth and pro-vide for the gods and honor them. In return for their creation, the first men declared to the Framer and Shaper, “Truly we thank you doubly, triply that we were created, that we were given our mouths and our faces. . . . We thank you, therefore, that we were created, that we were given frame and shape.”11 At the request of the gods, this appreciation would take on the form of sacri-fices for later generations. Yucatec Maya creation myths found in the Chilam Balams of Tizimin, Chumayel, and Códice Pérez share these concepts of de-struction, renewed creation, and birth.12In general, all Maya accounts serve the purpose of a creation myth: they legitimate and explain the role of man on the earth and in the cosmos. Per-haps the scribe of the Chilam Balam of Chumayel stated it best when declar-ing that these creation myths “are for the Maya people here when inquired if they know how they had been born and the founding of the world here in this peninsula.”13 The translation in this chapter provides an additional ex-ample of a Maya creation myth found in the first twenty- four pages of the Teabo Manuscript, one that contributes sections not found in other redac-tions of the commentary. Preceding the translation is a discussion on the role of the Creation story in evangelization, an account and comparison of the appearance of the Genesis Commentary throughout various Maya texts, and an analysis of the commentary as found in the Teabo Manuscript to reveal its various European and Maya elements.14 In all, this chapter offers additional insights into the Maya- Christian colonial dialogue that created the Creation in Maya texts.The Importance of Genesis in EvangelizationFor Spanish ecclesiastics, and indeed all Christians today, the Creation is fun-damental to explaining and validating the primary tenets of Christianity.

He placed Adam in a paradisaical garden in Eden wherein also were placed two specific trees: the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, the latter of which Adam was commanded not to partake. Adam then begins the task of gathering and naming all creatures, but among these “none proved to be the suitable partner for the man.”15 Rectifying this, God formed a female companion for Adam from one of his ribs. Both Adam and Eve lived naked in the garden as they were in a state of innocence.After a time, Lucifer, the serpent, beguiles Eve into eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Subsequently, Eve brings the fruit to Adam, who also partakes. With knowledge having replaced their innocence, they recognize their nakedness and sew aprons from fig leaves and hide from God. When he discovers their transgression, God curses Lucifer, Eve, and Adam. To Eve God declares, “I will intensify the pangs of your childbearing; in pain shall you bring forth children. Yet your urge shall be for your husband, and he shall be your master.”16 For the sake of Adam, God curses the earth; “thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to you,” and, after clothing them, God evicts Adam and Eve from Eden to toil in the world for their subsistence.17 Following their eviction, Adam and Eve procreate, and the remaining pages of the Bible relate their posterity’s successes when properly venerating and obeying God, and their failures when neglecting to do so.18For neophytes in the Faith, the Creation introduces themes important to Catholicism. As the being who created the earth, its inhabitants, man, and the cosmos, God reigns supreme. No other deities are mentioned, thus en-forcing monotheism and the almighty power of God.19 Indeed, when speak-ing of the Creation and the power of God, the sixteenth- century fray Luis de Granada commented, “Who will not be humbled and prostrate and become a worm in the presence of such great majesty? Who will dare to offend such a powerful monarch and lord of heaven and earth?”20Through “The Fall,” or Lucifer’s successful temptation of Eve, the Cre-ation also introduces the opposing forces of good and evil. Here, the subtlety of the devil becomes evident, and his conquest over Eve allowed the Church to proscribe women as frail and morally abased. The Fall also introduces sin largely as a result of Lucifer’s deceit—a concept useful to ecclesiastics when trying to invalidate native deities—and the subsequent need for a savior, Jesus Christ. Having established the fallen state of man and his reliance upon the grace and mercy of God and Christ, the Creation story allows ecclesiastics to further elucidate how mankind may earn such grace and mercy through various works as attending Mass, confession, living according to policía cris-"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 29tiana, “Christian civility,” and so on.21 In many ways, the Creation story is the keystone in the arch that is Catholic doctrine.Various native- language religious texts composed by early ecclesiastics bear evidence of the importance of the Creation in instructing the natives. In general, the Creation appears in these texts as either its own topic, or in-cluded in a discussion on the fourteen Articles of Faith, the fifth of which proclaims a belief in God as the maker of heaven and earth, or in the expla-nation of the Apostles’ Creed, wherein the first statement likewise asserts a belief in God as creator of heaven and earth. Regarding texts in Nahuatl, in 1564 the Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún produced his Colloquios, which re- created the conversations that allegedly took place between the first twelve Franciscans sent to evangelize the Nahuas in 1524 and the native nobles and priests.22 In these, their initial efforts to explain the Catholic faith, the friars recount the Creation, including the creation of the angels and the heaven of God’s abode, Empyrean.23The Dominican Martín de León begins his 1611 Nahuatl Camino del cielo with the Creation to explain not only the omnipotence of God, but also his power over the devil and the latter’s role in deceiving mankind.24 A 1548 Nahuatl Doctrina commissioned by the Dominicans begins with a discussion on the Articles of Faith and, thus, a significant discussion of the Creation. The doctrina also contains a few sermons dedicated to the Creation.25 And the 1759 Nahuatl Promptuario of Ignacio de Paredes places the explanation of the creation and purpose of mankind at the beginning of his voluminous work.26Due to the dearth of religious texts printed in Yucatec Maya, fewer ex-amples exist. In fact, the only text that truly addresses the topic is arguably the most renowned printed work in Maya: fray Juan Coronel’s 1620 Discur-sos predicables.27 The work is a collage of texts Coronel collected and edited to form his large volume. The Articles of Faith provide the structure for the first few sections, which contain a lengthy redaction of the Creation.28 Ye t this redaction largely adheres to the biblical account and, importantly, dif-fers from that found in Category 3 Maya texts. What we see in Coronel is an ecclesiastic- endorsed, printed version of Genesis, although other nonofficial versions likewise circulated as evinced in the following manuscripts. Indeed, Coronel himself stated that he printed his work so that such teachings “do not run in handwritten copybooks where many lies are found.”29In all, both Maya and European cultures valued the importance of cre-ation stories, with the latter employing them frequently in their didactic reli-gious texts. We may safely assume, then, that the Creation was an important topic covered in the convent schools designed to train the indigenous noble"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"30 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tyouth. Ecclesiastics employed various European works, including the Bible, to convey the Creation.30 As evinced by the Genesis Commentary in the Teabo Manuscript and others, the Maya then took this eclectic understand-ing of the Creation, adopted it to their culture, and made it their own again and again as they recopied and reinterpreted the story over the centuries.31 Indeed, perhaps the Genesis Commentary in Maya texts, and all Maya Chris-tian creation myths, are best seen as another link in the long chain of works attempting to make sense of Genesis along the lines of contemporary sci-ence, knowledge, and everyday life. Following in the footsteps of Augustine and Aquinas, the Maya contributors confronted and smoothed out potential conflicts between biblical and culturally contemporary understandings of the cosmos to create a Creation that best suited local needs.The Genesis Commentary in Maya Texts and Text SharingAs mentioned above, Category 3 Maya texts and their unofficial nature afford an uncommon insight into the worldview and beliefs of the colonial Maya.32 Simply put, they illustrate which aspects of Christianity the Maya chose to re cord and preserve over the centuries of colonial rule. Because the Maya had a well- established tradition of creating and preserving creation myths long before the Spanish arrival, it is not surprising that their colonial writings con-tinue this tradition.33Of all the aspects of Christianity the Maya could have recorded, what appears most frequently are texts concerning the creation and end of the world—the latter will be discussed in chapter 2. Precontact Maya creation myths, the most common of subjects among hieroglyphic codices, empha-sized period beginnings and endings, creation and re- creation, so this al-lure toward a Christian counterpart is understandable. Time and time again Mayas (and Nahuas) more readily adopted those aspects of Christianity—and the colonial world in general—that contained preexisting parallels. Re-garding the matter, Matthew Restall and Amara Solari stated, “[T]here must have been some kind of comfort in finding links between their traditional worldviews and those being forced upon them by Catholic priests.”34 Thus, it is due in large part to precontact parallels that the Maya awarded the Genesis Commentary its popularity.As found in Maya texts, the Genesis Commentary details the Creation along six days and gives the location in the heavens and earth of each cre-ation according to a geocentric Ptolemaic model of the universe often found in Spanish almanacs or reportorios de los tiempos.35 Although these Maya texts,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 31such as the Teabo Manuscript, date from the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (some with annotations made in the twentieth century), they still contain a geocentric model of the universe. Admittedly, the Catholic Church prohibited a heliocentric model due to its seeming conflict with the Bible, and works expressing such ideas—including those of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo—found themselves on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum until 1758 and beyond.36 This, coupled with the lack of a university in the prov-ince, greatly limited the teaching of heliocentrism and the “new sciences” despite their general acceptance elsewhere. Regardless, the nineteenth- and twentieth- century Maya of Teabo appeared indifferent to, or perhaps unin-formed of, such shifts in the scientific understanding of the cosmos and pre-served the original geocentric model established centuries before. This, then, suggests an important characteristic of many Maya Christian copybooks: their authors seemed more concerned with the story and its preservation than whether or not it was doctrinally correct or scientifically up to date.The Teabo Genesis Commentary has three self- designated parts where it proclaims “u pectzil ɔibanil” (the news that has been written). The first de-tails the widely accepted European geocentric model with the earth repre-senting the first of eleven heavens or spheres (see figures 1.1 and 1.2).37 These spheres would then rotate to produce the movement of the stars and planets. The single exception to this was the highest heaven or sphere called Empy-rean—the fiery and brilliant domain of God and his angels. The tenth sphere belongs to the second heaven, the Prime Mover, which the Teabo Manuscript accurately describes as “the first heaven that revolves.”38 Because the earth FIGURE 1.1. Spherical Model of the Universe"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"FIGURE 1.2. Michelangelo Caetani’s Diagram of Dante’s Layered Cosmos"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 33was thought to be stationary with the cosmos rotating around it, a moving force was needed to rotate the heavens. This, then, was the role of the Prime Mover and the single angel that rotated it daily as “he comes from the east and arrives in the west, one day in twenty- four hours.”39 The ninth and eighth spheres are called Crystalline and Firmament re-spectively. Medieval and early modern interpretations of Genesis 1:6–9 and Psalm 148:4 that describe the “waters that be above the heavens” assigned such waters to the Crystalline layer. Yet here, the heavenly waters have been changed into solid matter to block the earth from the overwhelming resplen-dence and glory of Empyrean. The Firmament layer holds the stars, which are fixed and stationary. Below the Firmament are the planets, which ac-cording to the Maya manuscript “do not exist among the stars, as was said, because each one exists in a heaven.”40 The remainder of this first discourse concerns what God created on which day and where it was placed. For ex-ample, on the fourth day God created the stars and placed them in the eighth layer of heaven, Firmament. The second part of Teabo’s Genesis Commen-tary expounds upon God’s creative works on the earth, focusing specifically on Adam and the Garden of Eden, or earthly paradise, and the third part explains the creation and temptation of Eve, some details of which are dis-cussed further below.Certainly the Genesis Commentary was not the only creation myth in circulation during the colonial period. For example, as mentioned previously, another myth found in the Chumayel, Tizimin, and Códice Pérez tells of the destruction and subsequent re- creation of the world in Katun 11 Ahau. Here the main protagonists are the battling deity complexes Oxlahun Ti Ku and Bolon Ti Ku, with the former emerging as victors. After the battle, a flood destroys the world in order for it to be repopulated and, as is related in the Chumayel, eventually destroyed again by another flood to usher in the Sec-ond Coming of Jesus Christ and the earth’s rebirth.41 Although the myth is rife with connections to the cosmologies of the Postclassic Yucatec Maya, it also contains colonial influences from Christianity. Moreover, the Chumayel contains a passage Edmonson (1986) calls the “Birth of the Uinal” that repre-sents a Maya creation narrative infused with Christian elements.42 In the end, and similar to the precontact era, the Maya circulated various creation myths, adhering to those that best suited personal, local, and sociopolitical needs. Just as a homogenized Maya culture failed to exist, so too did a single creation myth either pre- or postcontact. For its part, the Genesis Commentary served as one of the myths circulated in the colonial period and beyond, and from the high number of texts within which it circulated, we can surmise it was"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"34 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tpopular. Not even the 1620 publication of Coronel’s very different, yet “offi-cial,” version of the Creation in his Discursos could supplant the commentary.Text sharing was not uncommon among the Yucatec Maya, as is dem-onstrated by the Genesis Commentary, the Maya Christian copybooks men-tioned in the previous chapter, and various other texts. A form of text sharing appears as early as the Classic period (c. AD 300 to 850), when particular glyphic spellings or phrasing disseminated among the Maya.43 In 1567 vari-ous Maya rulers helped compose and sign nine letters to the king supporting the Franciscans after Diego de Landa’s tortuous campaign in 1562. Although the Maya signatures represented some seventy- five different cahob, the ma-jority of the letters are nearly identical. Moreover, the primordial titles—local histories designed to promote the sociopolitical interests of the cah and its dominant lineage—of two separate cahob, Chicxulub and Yaxkukul, contain many long, cognate passages.44 In short, cognate discourses have a long and diverse history in Yucatan.The cognate passages among the Chilam Balams have not gone un-noticed. Barrera Vásquez and Rendón (1974) examined the phenomenon and posited the existence of a single, original master text, derived from hiero-glyphic books, from which all other Chilam Balams drew their native reli-gious and historical content. As copies circulated among various towns and as others recopied and amended the work, the original text became corrupted and varied through scribal error. Others such as Gunsenheimer (2000/2001, 2006), Hanks (2010), and Knowlton (2010) complicated and further devel-oped the discussion. Hanks suggests that “either many texts circulated inde-pendently or there was some other discourse, probably oral, that circulated and was absorbed into writing in different places where books were main-tained.”45 Here, Hanks’s thesis on reducción and its design to reform the social space, conduct, and language of the Maya can be useful in understand-ing commonalities among religious texts. Hanks exposes the importance of discourse production to that of reducción and the intention of doctrinal lan-guage to be iterative. Doctrinal words and phrases developed within the reli-gious sphere of reducción circulated through repetition and spread to become common occurrences within a more general colonial worldview of belief and practice. Thus, similar phrases, glosses, and sentences found in the first gram-mars and dictionaries appeared throughout notarial documents and religious texts, both official and unofficial.46 A similar comparison can be made with those religious texts likely produced in the sphere of reducción that later ap-peared among Chilam Balams and Maya Christian copybooks, as they too fall into a larger pattern of iteration that lay at the heart of both a precontact and colonial doctrinal discourse."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 35Establishing a chronological sequence to the Chilam Balams and copy-books is also difficult due to the recopying of these texts, the process of which oftentimes included a more modern vernacular and orthography, and the lack of dates identifying the original composition. That said, comparison among cognate texts is not a fruitless exercise.47 Indeed, the various cog-nate texts among colonial Maya texts are not verbatim copies but creative compositions that expound, paraphrase, and vary the narrative according to personal and local preferences.48 Identifying and examining such instances among the texts better illustrates both the existence of common and popu-lar Christian discourses and the ability to modify such discourses. Moreover, such an analysis reveals those aspects of Christianity certain towns/authors deemed sufficiently significant to expound upon, and those more suitable to paraphrase. This in turn exposes more clearly the evolution and devolution of specific concepts in an ever- evolving Maya- Christian worldview. Regarding the Genesis Commentary, I have located portions of it in four colonial manuscripts: the Chilam Balams of Kaua, Chan Kan, the Morley Manuscript, and now the Teabo Manuscript. As illustrated in Table 1.1, the common Christian discourse of the Genesis Commentary appears in both similar and dissimilar ways throughout Maya texts. The moments of conflu-ence and divergence among the texts are illustrated in the table with sections A through H. Examining the commentary through these sections better ex-poses trends and authorial preferences not seen otherwise. Generally speak-ing, and in regard to omissions and additions to the commentary, the Teabo and Morley Manuscripts largely parallel each other, with the Kaua and Chan Kan having more in common.Section A is the longest span of text where a harmony exists between all Table 1.1.

The commentary then resumes."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"36 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tfour works. The section describes the first day of creation with an emphasis on the Empyrean, Prime Mover, and Firmament layers and a general description of the other bodies in the cosmos. A description of the second day of creation then begins focusing on the properties of the Crystalline layer. The text de-clares the veracity of the commentary up to this point, citing St. Augustine and astrologers who “manifest publicly and bring to light” this information.49Immediately following, the Teabo and Morley Manuscripts break and start a new section, indicated by a drop cap or a series of dashes, while the Kaua and Chan Kan continue citing various authorities including St. Jerome and St. Augustine (section B in Table 1.1). The examples derived from these saints deviate from the Creation narrative and focus more on the difficulty of man in attaining reason and understanding. Included in this extended dis-course is a subsection of sorts titled “discursus sagrada iscritura,” or sermons on the Holy Scriptures.50 The compilers of the Teabo and Morley Manu-scripts seemingly were unaware of this extended discussion or deemed it too ancillary and omitted it altogether.All four texts resume their harmony, however briefly, in section C. The creation of the Sun and Moon are mentioned along with the fall of Lucifer and his followers from heaven on a Monday. Here again the Kaua and Chan Kan include an extended narrative (section D) that explains how the fol-lowers of Lucifer entered into various plants and other natural phenomena to afflict man. All four texts then reunite (section E) to reiterate that “Lunes (Monday) is not a good day because it is the principal day Lucifer sinned and created evil and the rest of the bad angels fell behind him.”51Section E then continues to discuss the creative events that occurred on days three through six. As the biblical creation of the cosmos occurred over a six- day period, ending the Genesis Commentary after a discussion of the sixth day is logical, and indeed occurs in the Kaua and Chan Kan. However, the Teabo and Morley Manuscripts continue with a commentary focused more on the creation of mankind than the cosmos. With its focus on the cre-ation of Adam, section F represents this continuation, but only for the Teabo Manuscript; Gretchen Whalen notes that the Morley Manuscript is missing three pages at this point, which no doubt contained parallel material.Both manuscripts begin their harmony again in section G, which starts by announcing “the second part of the news that has been written where it has been taught and declared the creation of the body of our first father, Adam, by our lord God, and the way our first mother, Eve, was born.”52 This section is lengthy, as both manuscripts describe in detail the creation of Adam and Eve, the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 37Evil, and Lucifer’s temptation and Eve’s subsequent transgression of eating of that tree. Although there is a striking similarity between the two texts, the Teabo Manuscript occasionally shortens, condenses, or rearranges passages or series of events.53 The harmony of section G ends abruptly as a result of miss-ing pages from the Morley Manuscript. Yet the Teabo Manuscript continues (section H) a bit further to describe God’s censure of Adam and Eve for their disobedience and their expulsion from the Garden to “[begin] the work of their penance until the final day of their lives here on earth. Amen Jesus.”54This analysis of Table 1.1 enables some interesting observations. Although the Genesis Commentary experienced obvious popularity among the Maya, it circulated in various tailored versions. When compared to those found in the Kaua and Chan Kan, the commentaries contained in the Teabo and Morley Manuscripts prefer a shorter discussion of the cosmos and a lengthier treatise on the creation and fall of mankind. Moreover, the section breaks found in the Teabo and Morley texts possess a striking similarity.What are we to make of the similarities between the Teabo and Morley Manuscripts, between the Kaua and Chan Kan, and among all four in gen-eral? These cognate texts did not occur by chance, so how were they pro-duced? My sense is that, as Hanks suggested regarding Maya reducido, such religious texts as the Genesis Commentary and others originated within the reducción and the schools used to train the Maya noble youth, perhaps even with some minor assistance from the friars. The trained Maya then brought these written and/or oral archetypes back to the cahob, where they were dis-seminated, recited, edited, and reworked over the centuries.Colonial chroniclers and ecclesiastics also provide some clues as they documented how Maya maestros wrote and preserved creation myths per-haps similar to that found in the Genesis Commentary. Diego López de Co-golludo makes note of fray Juan Gutiérrez, who reportedly saw copybooks written in the Roman alphabet containing Maya creation myths.55 Moreover, the priest Pedro Sánchez de Aguilar himself confiscated a copybook detail-ing the Creation from a maestro. He commented, “It would be very useful to have printed books in the language of these [Maya] about Genesis and the creation of the world because they have fables, or very harmful histories, and some of these they have written, and they preserve them and read them in their meetings (emphasis mine).”56 That such meetings occurred is further con-firmed by a separate request from Aguilar that “the Indians (Maya) do not hold meetings at night.”57Such statements offer the likely scenario in which Maya maestros and other cah officials held meetings where copybooks containing the Genesis"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"38 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tCommentary were read aloud and shared. This would encourage not only the continuation of written versions of the commentary in a particular cah, but also their preservation in oral history as a possible example of “recitation literacy.”58 In the end, we may safely surmise that iterations of written or oral versions (or likely both) of various texts of this kind circulated within a cah and beyond to facilitate cognate versions.The frequent copying, recopying, and editorial redaction of such texts as they circulated in one form or the other makes any firm chronological or genealogical history of a particular text extremely problematic. The geo-graphic location of the cahob possessing cognate texts does not seem to have much impact on the texts themselves. Texts bearing striking similarities can be found among cahob both proximate and quite distant from each other. For example, Bricker and Miram’s work on the Kaua (2002) included a treatise they titled “The Meaning of the Mass,” which relates the Mass to the Passion of Christ, and which they also identify in the Chan Kan located less than thirty miles from Kaua. Recently, I discovered a close cognate version of this text in the “Passion Text” from Teabo, which is over sixty miles from either cahob. Although each occurrence contains unique orthographic preferences, all three texts are extremely similar despite the distances among their cahob of origin. The creation myths found in the Chumayel, Tizimin, and the Códice Pérez, while distinct in their own ways, also share close similarities, particu-larly the Tizimin and Pérez, despite their wide geographical distribution.59Regardless, the Genesis Commentary and other examples discussed later expose the familiar presence of cognate texts among the Maya in a practice that extended beyond the Chilam Balams and occurred more frequently than perhaps previously thought. Although evidence exists to demonstrate text sharing among the early Franciscan friars in central Mexico, whose works often included components of previous works, to my knowledge I am not aware of Nahuatl- authored texts containing significant cognate passages from texts of other altepetl (Nahua sociopolitical unit).60 Yet such seemed to be the case among the Maya and their Christian copybooks.Some Orthographic and Textual Observations about the Four CommentariesAlthough the four commentaries are similar, they are far from facsimiles, and each betrays specific content and orthographic preferences.

That said, examining specific ele-ments of the cited text provides revealing insights. To begin, the texts differ in how to begin this passage. The Kaua, Chan Kan, and Morley Manuscript all begin with some variation of “Bala oheltabac helel lae hijbal lic yalic ku-lem Dzib U sihsah Dios tu cappelil u kinil lay firmamento” (So this has been known now, this which the Sacred Scripture says that God created on the second one of His days, this Firmament).68 Yet the Teabo Manuscript uses the first part of this sentence to conclude the previous section that it ends with an “Amen,” and begins the next section with “Tu capel u kinil lay firma-mento . . .” complete with a decorative drop cap.This deviance is unusual among the four texts. Generally speaking, all four texts contain similar section breaks that appear along thematic lines. The final lines of the Kaua and Chan Kan’s commentary provide one of many examples. Both the Kaua and Chan Kan end the commentary with a state-ment on the ability of the Holy Scriptures to explain the Trinity and Cre-ation. Although the Morley Manuscript does not contain this sentence due to missing pages, the phrase is found in the Teabo Manuscript, which, in-stead of ending the commentary, uses a section break indicated by a series of dashes and begins the next section with a drop cap. This generally consistent correlation between section beginning and endings is remarkable and again suggests a system of circulation that included textual and/or oral accounts of the commentary.Multiple renditions of the same passage also assist in understanding its content—to a degree. After describing Crystalline, all four texts place it in the “uactas caan,” the “sixth layer of heaven.” Yet by the texts’ own previous admission, Crystalline is the ninth layer of heaven, not the sixth, which is in-habited by Jupiter. Those scholars familiar with such texts have offered vari-ous explanations for this error. Bricker and Miram (2002) suggest that both appearances of uac in the Kaua passage be read as uaxac, or eight, to reflect the Ptolemaic diagram of the cosmos included in the Kaua that lists Crystalline, however erroneously, as the eighth layer.69 Whalen posits that “perhaps [the author] was looking at a diagram of the cosmogram numbered with Arabic numerals, and misread 6 for 9 from the side or upside down.”70The presence of uac in all four texts firmly attests to its intentional read-ing as uac, “six.” Yet the reason for this perpetuated error over the centuries and among four cahob scattered throughout Yucatan remains elusive. Occa-sionally, the European almanacs from which the commentary derives inspi-ration refer to the heavens in reverse order. For example, the Firmament is"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"44 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tthe fourth heaven from God’s perspective, but the eighth from ours here on earth and could be referred to as either.71 But even that scenario fails to ex-plain the error, as Crystalline would either be the third or ninth heaven. To my knowledge, the only time the almanacs use the number six in reference to Crystalline is in their statement that Crystalline helps move the six planets.72Certainly, confusion of the esoteric Ptolemaic- Christian model of the universe occurred, as seen in the diagram included in the Kaua. Furthermore, when describing the layers of the planets, the author of the Teabo Manu-script placed both Saturn and Jupiter in the “uuctas caan” (the seventh layer of heaven).73 These and other errors are not hidden or difficult to find; any superficial study of the text reveals their presence. So why were they not cor-rected? Perhaps there is a meaning within the lines that escapes us. Or, per-haps the errors suggest another insight into the Genesis Commentary: that it was preserved more for its ability to connect the Maya to the cosmos in a Christian world rather than its use as a faithful replica of European thought or a doctrinally correct text. We are left to wonder how many members of the cah truly understood this Ptolemaic- Christian- Maya worldview, or even cared to. For that matter, how many Christians today could recite the Cre-ation as dictated in Genesis or explain it? Today various Maya communities continue to preserve colonial religious texts. Although they are oftentimes unaware of such texts’ content, they are respected for their connection to the past as an artifact of historic and cultural importance. The Genesis Commen-tary would eventually fade from the understanding of the Yucatec Maya and perhaps it began earlier in the colonial period than we realize.The European and Maya Elements of the Genesis CommentaryBecause Knowlton (2010) admirably illustrates many of the precontact influ-ences evident in the colonial redactions of the Genesis Commentary, and the work of Bricker and Miram (2002) expertly addresses the European influ-ences on the account as it appears in the Kaua, this section strives to contrib-ute to these previous works by illustrating what the Teabo Manuscript can add to these conversations. In addition, further exploration of medieval reli-gious theory and belief allows for new insights into the intended meanings of the occasionally esoteric prose of the commentary; such insights are found often in the notes accompanying the translation.To begin, the Genesis Commentary in the Teabo Manuscript is highly Europeanized, perhaps making it easier to extract obvious Maya elements from its pages. Yet because Mayas trained in the Roman alphabet and Chris-"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 45tianity composed the vast majority of what we understand to be the Maya’s creation myths, it is difficult in most cases—such as with the Popol Vuh—to say with authority which elements in such myths existed prior to their ex-posure to Christianity. As Allen Christenson notes, the Maya were not con-cerned with writing an objective or even “orthodox” history. In many ways, they saw creation myths for what they were: stories. And stories can change according to the narrator’s preferences.Such modifications should not be forced into the defined categories of resistance or conformity. In truth, religion has always included resistance and conformity in a fluid, constant negotiation. For example, although most Christians today may attend church, they might also profane a little, cheat a little, and therefore “resist” full compliance in order to create a version of religion best suited to personal needs and preferences. Surely such individuals see themselves as good Christians overall despite such vagrancies that “resist” the prescribed ideal. We should not begrudge the Maya the same by claim-ing that their versions of the Creation represent either open resistance to the Church or complete capitulation.As I have argued elsewhere, what seems to have mattered most to the Maya in creating these accounts was not producing a facsimile of Catholic doctrine, but presenting a story that would best resonate with a Maya audi-ence.74 The production of such stories involves a fluid conversation between precontact, European, and colonial cosmogonies. The Genesis account here is a result of such a conversation.Regarding European influences, the commentary is an eclectic text from a variety of sources, none of which seemed to have been copied verbatim. Thus, various possibilities exist. Sixteenth- century Spanish reportorios, or almanacs, may have guided the first section of the Genesis Commentary in the Teabo Manuscript, and evidence exists to illustrate their popularity in New Spain, particularly that of Rodrigo Zamorano published in 1585 in Seville.75 Simply put, these reportorios represented Europe’s attempt to ex-plain the cosmos and their effects on man. Bricker and Miram’s study of the Kaua illustrates how images that appear in this Maya text were copied from such reportorios, while Laura Caso Barrera (2011) does the same for the Ixil. Interestingly, the native Andean chronicler, Guaman Poma, utilized such a reportorio in his early seventeenth- century Nueva corónica y buen gobierno to create a list of the five ages of the Western world—a common section of Spanish reportorios—that harmonized with the Andean past.76 And the Col-lege of Tlatelolco—the sixteenth- century focal point for Nahua- ecclesiastic collaboration in text production—held various copies of reportorios in its library.77 Yet the Genesis Commentary in Maya works is far from an exact"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"46 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p ttranslation of any reportorio. Indeed, although the European almanacs in-formed the descriptions and model of the cosmos, the structure of the com-mentary (arranged around the six days of creation) deviates significantly from the reportorios (arranged around the heavens and their constellations).Yet reportorios were not the only possible inspiration for the Gene-sis Commentary. Biblical commentaries emerged from the earliest Chris-tian writers, and by the Middle Ages many such commentaries were joined together in the Glossa ordinaria—a twelfth- century work that served as the standard collection of exegetical materials for centuries. Commentaries on Genesis enjoyed particular popularity. From Flavius Josephus’s Antiquities of the Jews to St. Augustine’s The City of God to Peter Comestor’s Historia scho-lastica, commentaries on Genesis abounded. Brian Murdoch’s work on medi-eval apocrypha demonstrates how vernacular commentaries in Europe often employed “other literary forms—verse or drama—than merely straightfor-ward prose” to engage their readers, who were oftentimes nonecclesiastic.78 The European authors of such vernacular interpretations of biblical text often composed their works from memory of the Bible and not directly from the text itself. The resulting work, then, was typically a creative construct of memory and existing commentaries. The Genesis Commentary found in vari-ous Maya works, including the Teabo Manuscript, seems to follow a similar pattern of drawing from various existing sources and memory to create a ver-nacular interpretation riddled with verse and drama so familiar and appealing to its native audience.The lack of a printing press in Yucatan only encouraged the region’s par-ticipation in the transatlantic book trade, and numerous European works found their way to Yucatan.79 Biblical commentaries continued their popu-larity in the early modern era. Various commentaries on Genesis and the Creation made their way across the Atlantic, including those of the popular Augustino Eugubino and Benito Pereira.80 Indeed, the Teabo Manuscript itself references the teachings of the great “miyatzob Doctoresob” (wisemen, doctors [of the Church]). Those who contributed greatly to the theology or doctrine of the Church were awarded the title of “Doctor.” Of the select num-ber bearing this title, a few are of particular importance here.Quoted twice, the influential work of St. John of Damascus should cer-tainly be considered. The saint, generally regarded as the last great figure of Greek Orthodox patrology, wrote the eighth- century Fountain of Wisdom—in many ways, the first Summa theologica—and various sermons. Although the Fountain contains a discussion of the Creation and various teachings of its text are found in the Maya commentary, another of his texts, a sermon"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 47on Holy Saturday, includes a lengthier exposition on the Creation and the Fall that could also have provided inspiration for the Genesis Commentary or another European text from which it borrowed.81 Interestingly, St. John of Damascus was the patron saint of the San Juan barrio in Teabo. As noted later, various indirect references to his work and teachings appear throughout the Teabo Manuscript and suggest him as an important source.The work of this saint would influence many theologians, including St. Thomas Aquinas, whose Summa theologica is also extremely palatable throughout the Genesis Commentary of the Teabo Manuscript. The com-mentary cites Aquinas three times—more than any other—as St. Thomas. This is not surprising when considering his lengthy expositions on the Cre-ation and his general popularity in sixteenth- century Spain. Indeed, book inventories detailing shipments from Spain to the New World frequently included Aquinas’s works, including his treatises on the Creation.82 Other Doctors of the Church cited are St. Augustine and St. John the Evangelist, with each having one specific reference.After the Kaua and Chan Kan conclude their commentaries, the Teabo and Morley Manuscripts continue to discuss the creation and fall of Adam. Here, the Teabo Manuscript occasionally contains sections not found in the Morley (sections F and H). In the first part of his Summa, Aquinas relates the differences between the body of Adam and those of other animals. Animals have claws, hides, feathers, and walk with their faces to the ground, reflecting their primary concern for food and sex. Man’s equability and good tempera-ment prevents him from needing claws or horns and allows him to make his own clothes. Moreover, he walks erect so that his gaze “may freely survey the sensible objects around him, both heavenly and earthly, so as to gather intel-ligible truth from all things.”83 The Teabo Manuscript captures these distinc-tions between man and animal. After describing the animals with their faces to the earth, the text states, “However, this man is not like this, he is erect and raised high, his gaze is marvelous, it examines his soul and what he sees. Nor did he receive true hair on his body, nor was he given much carnal desires, or feathers as pertains to the rest of His (God’s) creations.”84Section H continues this narrative but illustrates in particular the con-sequence of Adam and Eve’s transgression. Here, the punishment for Eve having caused Adam to sin is meted out as follows: “For this reason, with great suffering you will give birth, this principal duty, and your affliction and the pain that exists in your death and life also.”85 Aquinas’s Summa likewise discusses the pain of pregnancy as Eve’s consequence for having caused Adam to sin, although this concept was well known throughout Catholic belief"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"48 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tand not isolated to Aquinas.86 That said, the whole of the discussion relating Adam and Eve’s consequences for having transgressed God’s commandment closely parallels that of Aquinas’s discussion.Thus, following the creation of the cosmos, which possibly draws from existing reportorios and commentaries, the Genesis Commentary draws from other works to create its narrative. Similar to historical and prophetic pas-sages in the Chilam Balams that ground their veracity in the citation of Maya prophets, the Genesis Commentary quotes various theologians and scholars known historically for their efforts in reconciling scripture with the cosmolo-gies of the Bible, Aristotle, and Ptolemy, including Saints Thomas Aquinas, John of Damascus, Augustine, John the Evangelist, and King Alfonso X of Castile and his astrologers.Certainly the Genesis Commentary drinks deeply from the fountain of European cosmogony. Yet it also betrays its Maya influences. In various places throughout the commentary, the text concludes a creative period or event with its “seating.” In the Maya calendar and when transitioning from one division of time to another, a “seating” took place. This “seating” also ap-plied to marking significant transitions between rulers or other events. This symbolism appears throughout precontact Maya hieroglyphs, the colonial Chilam Balams, and also in the Genesis Commentary. For example, after God established the dawning and setting of light on the first day, “it was per-fected and this first day was seated.” Later, God “desired to seat the beginning of the days which is Sunday.”87Another modification regards the Maya’s use of ah/ix bolon pixan as a translation for “blessed” when referencing the saints. In literal terms, the phrase means “he/she of the nine souls” or the “nine- souled,” and it is consis-tently found in reference to Catholic saints.88 For example, the Teabo Manu-script references Saint Augustine as “Ah bolon pixan San Agustin” (he of the nine souls, Saint Augustin), and similar occurrences exist throughout myriad Maya texts.89 The number nine held significant meaning throughout Meso-america; possibly it represented the number of layers in the Maya under-world, and it still appears in modern incantations performed by local Maya leaders.90 Moreover, the names of various deities in the Maya pantheon em-ployed the ah bolon phrase such as Ah Bolon Tzacab, Ah Bolon Yocte, and Ah Bolon Caan Chac, and a section of the Vienna dictionary—a colonial Spanish- to- Maya dictionary—describes Ah Bolon Ahau and Ah Bolonil as idols of deities worshipped in precontact times.91 When presented with saints containing attributes and abilities similar to their gods and demigods, the Maya seemingly continued to employ the ah/ix bolon phrase to familiarize these foreign but powerful figures."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 49Other examples of native influences on the commentary exist that con-cern Maya rhetoric. Both the Maya and Nahua employed parallel construc-tions where the author rephrases what has been said in a slightly different form. Examples of these constructions abound in the hieroglyphic inscrip-tions of the Classical Maya and the writings of the colonial Maya including the Teabo Manuscript.92 Using a bilingual triplet construction, the com-mentary tells the reader how it is necessary to understand how the cosmos was explained by “U yah miyatzilob astrologosob hach canaltac U miya-tzob” (the wise men, the astrologers, the most esteemed wise men). The oral aspect of Maya texts, which were more often performed than simply read, is also revealed. Here the audience is frequently referenced and told what they will hear and see and what they are to understand of the discourse. One example of many reads, “Now then, you Christian, listen to the news, the meaning of how the body of our first father Adam was formed, by our lord God.”93The interactive nature of the commentary deepens significantly in its discussion of the creation and fall of Adam and Eve, where the commen-tary reads more like a script than a summary of events you would expect to find in a printed European text. Reflecting upon the matter, Lockhart made a comment in reference to Nahua orality that could as easily be applied to the Maya:The Nahua manner of oral narrative was to give a far more fleshed- out, dramatized version than the succinct third- person paraphrases pre-ferred by Europeans for most nonliterary purposes, and this mode was faithfully reduced to writing in many alphabetic documents of the six-teenth century and later.94By way of illustration, consider the conversation that ensues after God created Eve from Adam’s rib and awakened him saying, “ ‘Delight in hearing, seeing the person there at your side,’ thus was said by our lord God. And then Adam answered, ‘Lord, this here is of my rib, of my bone also. Now Virago95 is the name of this virgin,’ so spoke Adam to our lord God.”96 The dialogic nature of Maya texts is especially evident in the commentary’s explanation of how the devils counseled to deceive Adam and Eve, and when God confronts the pair about their transgression. Regarding the latter, the dialogue changes frequently, as it would in a play or performance:“My holy father, I fell into error because of this woman here,” thus spoke Adam."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"50 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tAgain to the woman [God said], “Why did you cause your hus-band to fall into error?”“My holy father, the devil beguiled me,” thus spoke Eve.I am not suggesting that the commentary was a play or even acted out in such a way, but rather that the text contains numerous examples of the oral and dialogic aspect commonly found throughout so many Maya and Nahua texts.The Genesis Commentary also includes symbolic figures, events, and phrases familiar to the Maya. In the text, God declares that his greatest cre-ation, prior to Adam, was the u yax chel cab (the first tree of the world). The world tree of the Maya is found inscribed throughout various precolonial sites and served as an axis mundi extending from the underworld through the middleworld, with its branches reaching the upperworld. In their study of the yax chel cab, Knowlton and Gabrielle Vail state it as the product of both precontact and colonial belief systems, “a colonial amalgam, a world tree at the center of a hybrid cosmology.”97 In the text, however, the yax chel cab un-conventionally represents both the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree of Life—two separate trees in the biblical commentary.98 Indeed, the Teabo narrative frequently refers to this conflated version of both trees as “U cheel cilich grasia yetel cuxtal yetel toh olal” (the tree of holy grace, of life, and peace). In the account the tree is a holy and sacred thing full of mys-tery, and God commands Adam and Eve, “Do not touch nor eat of the fruit because it is very solemn, you are not worthy to touch it.”98Another example of Maya influence in the narrative occurs later in the commentary. When Adam and Eve are ashamed to appear naked before God, they hide underneath a che habin or Dogwood tree native to Yucatan. The leaves and bark of this tree were common elements used in precontact and colonial idolatrous rituals, and its bark is frequently used in medicinal reme-dies.99 And when tempting Eve to eat of the forbidden fruit, Lucifer exclaims that the fruit will enable her vision to reach from “hun xaman y hun chikin” (the north to the west).100 This Maya phrase also appears in the Tizimin, the Morley Manuscript, and in Coronel’s Discursos and is a metonym for “every-where.”101 This is simply one example of many where Maya phrases and sym-bols are included to familiarize a European cosmogony.Furthermore, the commentary’s progressive creation of man resonates with other Maya creation myths where speechless, senseless beings are im-proved and/or replaced until finally achieving a version of mankind capable of venerating the deities.102 In the Teabo Manuscript, after God formed Adam, Adam could not move until he received the breath of life. Then, through a"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 51series of sequential actions taken by God, Adam received his sight, speech, hair, and skin. Interestingly, and admittedly to a lesser degree, the Bible re-counts the formation of man in a similar progressive way, with Adam being formed, then made to sleep while Eve was created from his rib, only later to awaken and then later still receive knowledge, thus, in a way, completing his creation.When analyzing the Genesis Commentary as a whole, certain character-istics of the text become evident. The first part of the narrative is replete with obvious references to European cosmology, biblical treatises, and citations of the saints. Undoubtedly, the Maya author(s) derived heavy inspiration from these European sources. However, beginning with “the second part of the news” on page eleven, the text largely ceases from citing the saints and other theologians, the orality of the prose increases even more, and the con-tent begins to stray from orthodox or standard versions of the Creation. Re-garding the latter, Adam’s creation becomes protracted and takes on a Maya persona with creative additions such as when God says to a sightless Adam, “Ephphatha,” a Greek form of the Aramaic word meaning “be opened.” This phrase was spoken by Jesus to a deaf and dumb man in Mark 7:34 whom Christ had anointed with his spittle. Although not associated with the Cre-ation, it seems that the Maya creatively selected this New Testament action and placed it into an Old Testament commentary.103 Perhaps this was done due to the inclusion of the Ephphatha rite in baptism. During this part of the ceremony, the priest touches the recipient’s ears and mouth with his thumb to “open” them to the words of God and to give him praise. It is possible that this rite associated with the birth of one’s soul was then used to describe the birth of Adam by the Maya(s) authoring the work, who no doubt was famil-iar with the ceremony.Another possibility concerns the sermons of St. Anthony of Padua, an important medieval figure in the Franciscan order. In his Sermones domini-cales, St. Anthony uses the Creation to equate the six creative days and a seventh for rest with the six Articles of Faith and the promise of eternal rest in the seventh. At one point the discourse compares metaphorically the spittle of Christ opening the eyes of the blind to wisdom that opens the eyes of Adam and his descendants.104 Perhaps this or a similar passage also served as inspira-tion in the Genesis Commentary. Regardless, it appears to be an uncommon inclusion into the Creation story.Other additions that could be considered nontraditional at best would be the devils organizing themselves in an audiencia, or court, to decide how to best deceive Adam and Eve—reminiscent of how the Lords of the Under-"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"52 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tworld in the Popul Vuh conspired against the Hero Twins. These devils are the angels cast out from heaven for their rebellion. As a result, they lost their place in heaven, and the medieval and early modern belief was that God created man to take their place.105 For the Maya, this “place” in heaven was represented by seats, as, similar to the Nahuas, the Maya associated seated figures with rulers.106 Here in the Teabo commentary the devils counsel with one another, saying, “What will be done now if these ascend to the chairs, seats, given to us formerly? How can their hands be removed from them (the chairs) in your opinion?”107Such additions reflect the preferences of the Maya inserting storylines, events, and dialogue that best told the desired story. In short, the second and third parts of the Genesis Commentary stray from what might be a more tra-ditional European format to the storyline. Although the voice of the Maya author(s) can be heard throughout the commentary, the voice increases in volume considerably as the tale progresses and moves away from outlining the Ptolemaic- Christian model of the cosmos.In 1990, Ana M. Juárez collected a story from Doña Docia Catzin Chan, a Maya woman living in the town of Tulum in Quintana Roo. The story is an oral account of Adam and Eve and their experience in the Garden of Eden. Although the events are biblically grounded, the story takes on many Maya elements. The devil in the form of a snake appears in a cenote (limestone cave or sinkhole), Adam and Eve are given a book of evil reportedly employed by sorcerers today, and linguistic couplets and triplets abound throughout the account.108 It would appear that various creation myths continue to thrive within the Maya Christian worldview of many in Yucatan.Determining the origin of colonial Maya texts is a difficult and often-times speculative affair. What I offer here are some thoughts on the origins of the commentary in hopes that they will spark discussion and debate that might bring us closer to a firm conclusion. It is possible that the first part of the commentary already existed, in some form, as a presently unidentified European treatise or as a series of texts the Mayas and/or their instructors drew from to create the commentary that the Maya used and modified to better suit an indigenous audience. Moreover, it is possible that the second and third parts either derived from a European antecedent or, more likely, were an original creation of a Maya author(s). Because this creative summary is so similar in structure among the four texts, it is possible—even probable—that it was created in the sixteenth century by a Maya author(s) with ready access to various European religious texts, perhaps in some convent where the Maya noble youths gathered to receive their instruction. From there, the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"c r e a t i n g t h e c r e a t i o n ✢ 53commentary circulated to influence various cahob and their copybook texts, including the ones examined here.

This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will return in the same way as you have seen him going into heaven.”1 Since that moment, Christians have been anticipating the return of Christ and his ushering in of a new age of Christianity. For Christians, the Second Coming of Christ is a monumen-tal event marking the end of the existing dispensation, and the beginning of another. In the process of this ending and beginning, Christ judges mankind to determine their state in the new order. How this occurs, and what good works and sins distinguish the saved from the damned, dominated the theme of many a sermon from the early ages of Christianity to the early modern native- language texts of New Spain to the present.In certain respects, the worldview of the Maya was not too dissimilar from that of early modern Spanish colonizers. As made evident from the previous chapter, the Maya took interest in creative period beginnings. Yet they also noted the destructive endings to these periods with an eye toward the re- creation of the next age. The precontact Dresden Codex and colonial Chumayel, Tizimin, and Pérez all reference a previous ending of a world age marked by a flood and the beginning of the next age.2 In truth, it should not be surprising, then, that many colonial Maya texts, including the Teabo Manu-script, contain Maya- Christian redactions of the Final Judgment and the Sec-ond Coming of Christ with its role in beginning a new age of Christianity.This chapter examines the section of the Teabo Manuscript (pp. 24–33) that immediately follows the Genesis Commentary and that details the gene-alogy of Christ and a treatise on the Final Judgment as inspired by Matthew 25. Regarding the latter, this chapter also explores texts within the Tusik and Chumayel to reveal cognate and thematically similar texts. In the end, the analysis provides further details into those aspects of Christianity that Mayas chose to absorb and preserve in their communal texts and examines how they creatively incorporated eschatological doctrine into their preexist-ing worldview.The Genealogy of ChristImmediately following the Genesis Commentary, the Teabo Manuscript con-tinues explaining that Adam and Eve lived 4,050 years on earth. (Indeed, the genealogy may be seen as a continuation of the commentary.) After estab-lishing the mortal state of man as a result of Adam and Eve’s expulsion from earthly paradise, the text then outlines the lineage of Christ through Abra-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"g e n e a l o g i e s, p a r a b l e s, a n d t h e f i n a l j u d g m e n t ✢ 105ham as found in Matthew 1:1–16. The Gospel of Matthew was directed to the Jews, and the work places specific emphasis on proving Christ’s divinity to that nation. Such an audience would be familiar with the lineage of Abra-ham and King David and the Messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. Thus, it is not surprising that the Gospel connects Christ to both throughout.We can only speculate as to why the Teabo Manuscript includes the lin-eage of Christ—no other Maya work that I am aware of contains this text. But its inclusion seems logical when discussing temporal ages in the world-views of both Europeans and the Maya. Most reportorios included a chro-nology and discussion about the ages of the world. Because God created the world in six periods or days and rested on the seventh, medieval theologians believed that the world’s past, present, and future likewise fit into six peri-ods or ages, with the seventh following the Final Judgment and ushering in a period of peace and rest. According to Rodrigo Zamorano’s 1594 Cronología y reportorio, some viewed the world’s six ages as follows:[Theologians] consider the first age being since the beginning of the world until the universal flood. The second age was from the flood until the birth of Abraham. The third age since the birth of Abraham until the beginning of the reign of King David and others take it to the construction of the Temple of Solomon. The fourth since the end of the third until the destruction of the temple and the transmigration of Babylon. The fifth since the transmigration until the birth of our redeemer, Jesus Christ. The sixth since this birth until the end of this era, age, and time of the Final Judgment. And because in the creation of the world, God ended his work on the seventh day, the seventh age will be everything that follows after the Final Judgment that will be calm and peaceful.3Thus, when discussing the Final Judgment of the sixth age, it would only make sense to begin with the commencement of that age, in this case the birth of Christ; it is possible that the Maya author(s) were following this pattern.4 Moreover, the season of Advent typically includes sermons on both Christ’s first coming (his birth) and his pending Second Coming.Regardless of the motive, the Maya’s appreciation for genealogy and lin-eage certainly did not begin with their European colonizers. The precontact hieroglyphic inscriptions found throughout Yucatan bespeak a strong tradi-tion of preserving and recording noble lineages. This tradition carried into the colonial period, when, as Matthew Restall demonstrates (1997), one’s chibal, or lineage, “formed a partial basis for identity, economic organization, and"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"106 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tsociopolitical faction within each cah.”5 The marriage patterns illustrated in Maya testaments from Ixil clearly illustrate the importance of maintain-ing and preserving one’s noble lineage through unions with similar chiba-lob.6 Lineage also played an important role among Maya nobles who wrote numerous petitions to colonial officials to form connections with ancestors who assisted Spaniards in their efforts to conquer, convert, and colonize.7 Even texts such as the Popol Vuh and its naming of K’iche’ lords down to the colonial period demonstrate the importance of preserving genealogies.8 And a genealogical diagram—perhaps the only other extant example outside the “Xiu Family Tree”—of Pedro Chan and Juana May’s respective families further illustrates the importance of such, at least to some, in the colonial period (see figure 2.1).9 Although theological authors, including St. John of Damascus, included a discussion of the genealogy of Christ, the genealogy in the Teabo Manu-script is remarkably similar to that found in Matthew.10 Indeed, there are only two discrepancies, and both occur within the first three lines of the text. In the first, the manuscript states “Abraham begat Jacob” instead of “Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob,” omitting mention of Isaac altogether. The second concerns the next line, where instead of the biblical “Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; and Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar,” the manuscript reads “Jacob begat ‘Jodam’ and Judas and his descendants, Phares and Zara of Thamar.”11 The primary deviation concerns the mention of Jo-dam—an unidentifiable figure in relation to Christ’s genealogy but likely a reference to Onan, one of Judah’s sons, whose wife, Tamar, will eventually provide Judah with twins, Phares and Zara.12This is not the only case where the admittedly difficult and relatively un-known biblical names proved a challenge for the Maya author of the geneal-ogy. Such names appear phonetically written throughout the lineage, with the conflation of names and places occurring frequently. For example, the previously mentioned Zara of Thamar (Latin, Zaram de Thamar) appears as “Saromon detanan,” Booz of Rachab (Latin, Booz de Rachab) as “baosdarad,” and Obed of Ruth (Latin, Obed ex Ruth) as “obeter xuth.” Such errors would have been avoided had the author been consulting the Bible or a Spanish priest. Furthermore, the Maya were extremely familiar with the Latin and Spanish preposition “de” that would have appeared in the Vulgate or a cor-responding Spanish text. But somehow the preposition was lost in the name altogether, almost as if the Maya author was hearing the Latin name Booz de Rachab spoken and recorded such as “baosdarad,” or simply had no idea Rachab was Booz’s mother and included it in the name.This then provides further insight into the copying of these texts.

The manuscript could have been authored as someone dictated the text. Indeed, Bricker and Miram made a similar suggestion when examining the spelling of a certain scribe that helped compose the Kaua:[T]he spelling of Spanish words is so bizarre that we wonder whether he recorded the words phonetically as the text was being dictated to him, instead of copying it himself from a written version. How else can the spelling of se fundó as Segundo, no sin grande as nos ignorante . . . ya as lla, and hazen as acen . . . be explained? These are the kinds of errors we would expect from someone who was not a native speaker of Spanish.13The thoughtful layout and overall composition of the text offers another possibility, at least for the surviving version of the manuscript. Similar to the errors found in the Genesis Commentary’s redaction of the Ptolemaic uni-verse, it is possible that the Maya author of either the original or some copy along the way penned the lineage of Christ without direct reference to its original, perhaps as the lineage was dictated to him by a priest or some other person. Subsequent copyists, if any, would simply transcribe the names’ erro-neous spellings. This is not unreasonable, after all. Most of the names in the lineage would give the most ardent Christian reason to pause. For the Maya author, they were simply foreign and abstract names that derived from a long- ago age of Christianity.Treatise on the Parable of the Sheep and GoatsThe next section of the Teabo Manuscript (pp. 27–32) introduces the pend-ing eschatological discussion (addressed in the next chapter) with its redac-tion of the parable of the sheep and goats that Christ gave to his disciples as recorded in Matthew 25: 31–46. The parable was well known among eccle-siastics and theologians for its apocalyptic content and frequently appears referenced in works concerning the Final Judgment. In the biblical parable, Christ sits on his throne of glory while the wicked and righteous are separated before him “as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.” The righteous gather on the right hand of Christ destined for eternal glory, while the wicked are on his left and intended for “eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.”14 According to the parable, works of charity, or the lack thereof, sepa-rated the righteous from the wicked, the sheep from the goats.This Doomsday parable served as thematic fodder for a section of the Chumayel.15 Here the section follows the biblical account while augmenting"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"g e n e a l o g i e s, p a r a b l e s, a n d t h e f i n a l j u d g m e n t ✢ 109it with other biblical figures and names. For example, the righteous are told they will share the glory of Elisha, Methuselah, and Enoch who have seats in heaven (again we see the emphasis on seats). Although thematically similar, the passage differs from that found in the Teabo Manuscript. The manuscript employs the parable as a springboard to launch itself into a protracted discus-sion of the sins committed by the damned and the pains of hell. Although the Maya text fails to directly cite the biblical passage, its correlation is clear from its division of the righteous and wicked on the right and left hands of God.16 That said, the Teabo Manuscript takes much liberty in altering and expanding the parable to suit its needs. Recall that the biblical parable uses charitable acts to distinguish the righteous from the wicked. Although the Maya text defines the righteous along such lines, the wicked are primarily those who did not believe and who did not “abandon [their] whoring and [their] concubinage.”17Regarding one’s faith, the term employed for “to believe” is ocsah ti ol. As William Hanks demonstrates, this phrase is the product of reducción and employs the Maya verb oc, “to enter,” with a causative suffix, the preposition ti, and ol, “heart,” to mean “to cause to enter into the heart.” The use of the root oc, “enter,” appears frequently throughout the discourse of conversion, as it signified “an entering into a new reality.”18 To describe those who failed to enter into the new Christian life, the phrase simply employed the negative ma or a similar variant. Regarding sexual deviance, colonial Catholicism exerted much effort in defining and controlling the sexual desires of the natives, and such has always been the proverbial thorn in the side of the Church. As a sin, the topic occupies more space than any other in ecclesiastical texts. For example, in an 1803 manuscript Maya confessional manual designed for a Franciscan friar, more than half of the questions directed to the Maya peni-tent concerned issues of sexual morality.19 No doubt the Maya trained in the schools of the friars received personally much instruction on what ecclesias-tics defined to be sexual deviance; its appearance here as the deciding factor between salvation and damnation, then, is not surprising.The Maya text is far from subtle in its description of the penalties ac-corded to condemned adulterers. Among other lines, we read, “For their tor-ment, their bodies and flesh are peeled; very miserable things also happen to them so that they scream and moan from their great suffering in hell.”20 The text is full of dialogue from the sinners recounting their misery and wailings and heinous descriptions of the tortures reminiscent of the images produced by Albrecht Dürer or Jacob Isaacsz van Swanenburgh, a mentor of Rem-brandt (see figures 2.2 and 2.3).

Not surprisingly, treatises on hell and its torments commonly occupy the pages of various native- language religious texts—and even moralistic plays—intended to instruct the natives of New Spain.21 More-over, images and paintings of apocalyptic doom adorn various churches and chapels throughout central Mexico and Yucatan.22 Such European images and descriptions of hell and its torments certainly influenced those found in the Teabo Manuscript. Although the Maya believed in an underworld of sorts, metnal, it represented the location of the dead; metnal was not a pleas-ant place, but it also lacked the torments of the Christian hell prescribed to the wicked. At the time of the Spanish arrival, Christianity was expert in the use of graphic imagery to encourage religious devotion, and here we see its employment for and by Maya Christians. After describing the horrors of hell, the Maya text returns to the bibli-cal parable. The manuscript affirms that the charitable works of the righteous toward the servants of God also served God himself, or as the Bible would have it, “Whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for m e .”23 The righteous then ascend to heaven, single file, while playing trum-pets and chirimías24 “of great beauty.” Here, the condemnation of the wicked follows the biblical account in that they failed to perform charitable works and thus were sent to the fires of hell.

Although uncertain, it is possible that within the eschatological context of the text Christ’s “keban” refers to his impending judgment and destruction that will be released upon the wicked on his return. Here we see the fluidity of keban in its original form. It is doubtful that the Maya concept of keban equaled that of the Christian concept of sin, although the authors of Maya reducido paired keban with the concept from the beginning.25 Similar to the Nahuatl word of choice for sin, tlatlacolli, the Maya understanding of keban seems to have included “fault” and “error” and myriad other definitions of a negative connotation, particularly when combined with verb roots, adjec-tives, and nouns ranging from keban thanil, “betrayal,” to keban uol, “to be sad.”26 Yet even given the fluidity of keban, it is strange to see the stand- alone word used in conjunction with Christ in a religious text. Indeed, for the sin-less Christ to refer to his sin—even if only in reference to the Final Judgment and destruction—is quite unorthodox, and although “keban” surely related successfully the misery and “badness” of that day (so often described in the scriptures as terrible), it is unlikely an ecclesiastic would have let such a cor-relation pass and again points to the native authorship of the text.FIGURE 2.3.

How-ever, the two sections do appear individually in other texts. In fact, this sec-ond part of the narrative also appears in the Tusik.27 The Chilam Balam ver-sion of the passage is similar, although not an exact replica, with deviations in orthography and word choice. Moreover, the Tusik manuscript is oftentimes illegible, thus leading to gaps and holes in the text. The Tusik also couches the passage among apocalyptic themes as it immediately follows a discussion of the Final Judgment and its rendition of The Fifteen Signs before Doomsday. Regardless, it serves as yet another example of a cognate apocalyptic text and further testifies to the significance of such to the colonial Maya.The section in the Teabo Manuscript begins with the Latin phrase aa qua perduCat aD uitam eternam, or generally, “bring us to everlasting life.” This appears to be an attempt at the phrase perducat nos ad vitam aeternam, which is the priest’s response to the Confiteor, or at the end of the three invocations at the Penitential Rite. The Maya text in this section begins with a drop cap and recounts the events and conversations relating to divided families where some are saved and others are damned, with sexual morality again playing the decisive role. Amongst the laments of such separation, blame is also found. Damned children not only curse their parents for their bad examples, but also for their lack of chastisement and correction. As a result the children “begin to fight among themselves and tear the bodies of their mothers and fathers” while devils torment them.28The apocalyptic text further reflects Maya rhetoric and ideology. Speak-ing to the condemned, the text says:xenex tukil metnal xenex ti hunlukul cici olal helelae: yanil kux cob y hun-kul kak = Ma tupbin ti anix U hach yabal cisinob numsicex ti ya tilic a bucinticex kak y U ɔ albal ti a bakeex =29(Go now to the corner of hell, leave forever the joy of today to where there is gnashing of teeth and eternal fire that does not extinguish and there are really great devils to afflict you while you are clothed with fire and your flesh fries.)This line provides various observations. The Bible references the “four cor-ners” of the earth on a few occasions, but always as a metaphor for “every-where.”30 The Maya also reference a four- cornered terrestrial plane associated with the cardinal points, each with its own color: white north, yellow south, red east, and black west. The corners, or tu’uk, play an essential role in the quincunx organization of the cosmos, with a central space oftentimes occu-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"g e n e a l o g i e s, p a r a b l e s, a n d t h e f i n a l j u d g m e n t ✢ 113pied by a world tree; the corners also frequently appear in creation myths.31 Moreover, the importance of the four directional corners continued through-out the colonial period, appearing in various documents including primordial titles and, more frequently, land sale documents or testaments with border markers or stone mounds to delineate the borders of a plot of land.32 For ex-ample, in Francisco Itza’s 1748 testament from Ixil he describes the location of his bequeathed land by describing the plots of land surrounding his in all four directions.33 And Marcos Chan of Ebtun stated in 1696 regarding his land that “its stone mounds are at its four corners.”34 Today Maya shamans and farmers continue the tradition by praying to all four cardinal directions or corners, “tukil,” of a cornfield prior to planting.The use of corners appears in the line above as the wicked are sent to the “corner of hell,” and this phrase again appears at the conclusion of this sec-tion. Although the Tusik contains a cognate passage, it does not employ this phrase. It is possible that the Teabo Manuscript uses the phrase tukil metnal to give space and location to metnal as possessing its own corner or tu’uk. The direction west and its color black is typically associated with the Maya under-world, as that is where the sun descended.35 Although the Teabo Manuscript fails to assign a specific cardinal direction to metnal, it does take care to give it a corner in the cosmos.Such subtle nuances join the frequent use of parallel constructions throughout the discourse to add a distinct Maya element to the text. Regard-ing constructions, an especially vivid example concerns the punishment of the wicked, whose bodies burn with fire: “bay u Yelel U hobon Cheil hobon Chee u balma kake” (as burns a hollow tree trunk, a hollow tree trunk that contains fire).36Once again, the texts represented in the Teabo Manuscript resonate well within both a Christian and Maya worldview. The genealogy of Christ lead-ing to his birth found prominence in the Gospel of Matthew and marks a common thematic topic in the season of Advent, when eschatological ma-terial frequently appeared. Moreover, the parable of the sheep and the goats likewise serves as an appropriate introduction to the upcoming discussion on the Final Judgment—a topic of immense popularity among medieval and early modern Christians.Importantly, the Maya chose to re cord and preserve such treatises due in no small part to their correlation with a preexisting Maya worldview. For centuries both before and after the conquest, the Maya maintained (and in some cases created) lineage records to serve their purposes.

Both, but especially the parable, contain characteristics that betray their authors as Maya. The metaphors, syntax, and orality of the text transform the European discourse into one better suited to appeal to a Maya audience. Like genealogies, apocalyptic material resonated well among the Maya as both the first and second comings of Christ serve as symbolic period beginning and endings to both Christians and Mayas—the significance of which will be discussed in the next chapter."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"116 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tGenealogy of Christ, Parables, and the Final Judgment, pp. 24–33(P . 24)quatro mil y SinCuenta años Cuxanob Uay yokol cabe = heix ca tohlabieobe parayso terenal lae yoxpel u kinil Ca tohlabiob tumen Ca yumil ti D.s Capel kin yanob ti parayso terenal lae Bay xul U kinilob lae nohcinabac Ca yumil ti D.s = ti yahaulil Cilich glaria ti minan U xul maix U lah U chibalob Ca yumil ti Jesu Christo = U he ah Dauid"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"g e n e a l o g i e s, p a r a b l e s, a n d t h e f i n a l j u d g m e n t ✢ 117(P . 24)4,050 years38 they lived here on the earth, but then they were exiled from this early paradise; this third day was when they were banished by our lord God; the second day they existed in this earthly paradise as their last days.

As mentioned in the previous chapter, the Second Coming of Christ plays a large role in Christianity. Concern for the signs that precede the event likewise plays a significant role. For many, it was logical to assume that Christ’s return should be heralded by signs. Fray Juan Bautista’s Nahua aide, don Antonio Valeriano, stated in their 1606 Nahuatl Sermonario, “As the first coming of Christ our redeemer to save us was preceded by many signs and events, so too at his second coming there will precede many and marvelous signs.”3 Over the centuries, many took to searching the scriptures to find clues that would indicate when such a return might occur and what events would take place. The result is a vast corpus of eschatological works that circulated throughout the Middle Ages and early modern period.This chapter examines the impact of the popular medieval text The Fifteen Signs before Doomsday on native- language religious texts in colonial New Spain. In the process, this chapter employs the Teabo Manuscript and a variety of Nahuatl and Maya texts to expose in new ways the relationship of such redactions to European archetypes, native culture, and each other. Furthermore, the analysis explores the popularity of The Fifteen Signs and eschatological texts among Maya Christian copybooks and texts. Similar to Creation commentaries, Doomsday prophecies heralding a new age repeat-edly appeared throughout the locally preserved native- language texts of the Maya, who, much like Richard Bach, saw the end as a beginning.Old- World Origins of The Fifteen SignsThe importance of the Apocalypse on medieval Christianity cannot be over-stated. As the eminent medieval historian Johannes Fried stated, “Through-out the middle ages the apocalyptic preaching of Jesus . . . was the fundamen-tal element of Christianity.”4 A focus on the individual’s fate in the next life assisted ecclesiastics and theologians in encouraging constant self- assessment and a Christian life. Apocalyptic preaching throughout medieval and early modern times experienced periods of immense popularity and even indiffer-ence largely due to social and political events. Christians afforded apocalyptic reactions to moments of famine, war, disease, political instability, and, espe-cially, discovery. The question of whether or not a particular event fulfilled apocalyptic prophecy was ever present on the minds of Europeans as they searched their texts.Various passages throughout the Old and New Testament elucidate"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"d o o m s d a y a n d t h e m a y a ✢ 139the signs heralding the Second Coming, oftentimes using metaphors and imagery that invite diverse interpretations. Similar to Matthew 25 and its parable of the sheep and goats, Luke 21 records an eschatological discussion Christ had with his disciples on the Mount of Olives. When his followers in-quired after the signs preceding Christ’s return, Christ provided a list. Among other portents were earthquakes, solar and astronomical anomalies, raging seas, and grief among the nations of the world.5 The book of Daniel and its cryptic prophecies of enormous statues and beasts also provided important eschatological fodder. Yet perhaps the most important text in Christian escha-tology is the book of Revelation. This apocalyptic work provides the longest and most symbolic description of the final days before Christ’s return, the events of his coming, and the preparation of the earth and its inhabitants for its Final Judgment. The book abounds with references to many- headed beasts, angels of death, and violent events.Other apocryphal works likewise speak of the Apocalypse. The Fourth Book of Ezra, the Second Apocalypse of John, the Apocalypse of Thomas, the Sibylline Oracles, and, of course, the writings of Joachim of Fiore all relate signs that will usher in the Second Coming and the fate of the world in the last days.6 As Christianity matured and progressed over time, the vague and highly symbolic signs found within such works gave rise to myriad interpre-tations and various texts that circulated widely throughout the Middle Ages. Indeed, the topic of the end of the world and the Final Judgment frequently appeared in the works of medieval ecclesiastics.7Among such works is The Fifteen Signs before Doomsday. In his work ex-amining the text, William Heist employs ninety- six versions of The Fifteen Signs found in a wide variety of texts—from poems to histories to the writ-ings of Thomas Aquinas—to argue the tenth- century Irish origins of the text. Most medieval and early modern authors claimed its origins from St. Jerome (c. 347–420), who supposedly found a list of fifteen signs among the Annales Hebraeorum, or Annals of the Hebrews. Yet this was likely an attempt to lend credibility to a text that fell between the learned and popular interpretations of Christianity. However, Heist argues that the origin of The Fifteen Signs lies in two Irish apocrypha from the tenth century: The Evernew Tongue8 and the Saltair na Rann “Psalter of Quatrains,” the latter being primarily based on the fifth- century Apocalypse of Thomas. More recent studies have continued to uncover texts relating the fifteen signs. Martin McNamara illustrates how Ireland has composed texts with the signs for over a thousand years, ranging from 750 to 1817–1819.9Whether or not The Fifteen Signs has Irish origins remains unclear. How-ever, it is clear that its origins are of questionable orthodoxy. Possibly based"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"140 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p ton an earlier Greek original, the Latin Apocalypse of Thomas is an apocryphal work that lists eight signs occurring on the eight days heralding the return of Christ; in the fifth century it was condemned by the Gelasian decree.10 Furthermore, Irish literature, particularly that of the ninth through the thir-teenth centuries, was the product of Latin apocrypha and local legends.11 Be-cause of its isolation from the rest of Christendom, the Irish Church created and preserved aspects of primitive Christianity—particularly those associated with visions—otherwise discarded by Rome.12 The widespread influence of The Fifteen Signs indicates that despite its unorthodox origins, it circulated widely throughout Western Europe. This has been the case of other unortho-dox texts originating in Ireland, including the Vision of St. Paul, which even-tually made its way into a sixteenth- century Nahuatl text.13Regardless of its origins, the signs gradually found their way into the writings of the thirteenth- century Spanish cleric Gonzalo de Berceo, who would put the signs into his poem De los signos que aparecerán antes del juicio.14 Later, the signs would be available in print in sixteenth- century Spain via Peter Comestor’s twelfth- century Historia scholastica, Jacobus de Voragine’s The Golden Legend (1260s), the supplement to the third part of Thomas Aqui-nas’s thirteenth- century Summa theologica and his commentaries on the Liber sententiarum of Peter Lombard, and the Flos sanctorum, which provided a Spanish edition and translation of Jacobus’s text by the sixteenth century.15 Certain signs even found their way into the works of William Shakespeare, particularly Hamlet and Julius Caesar, as portents of doom.16 Although each rendition of the signs drew inspiration from earlier models, they oftentimes altered the order and content of the signs themselves (see Tables 3.1–3.5). Although clearly drawing from a similar legend, either oral or written, each text is distinct and reflects the author’s preferences and emphases. That said, general observations are possible among those texts most likely to have influ-enced New World authors. Similar to the cognate texts of the Chilam Balams and Maya Christian copybooks, determining who copied from whom can be problematic. How-ever, it is clear that Peter Damian’s De novissimis et Antichristo served as a large, but not the sole, inspiration for Aquinas’s signs in his Summa, with the main difference being in a switching of signs nine and ten. Moreover, Jacobus de Voragine’s text is a conflation of the Damian and Comestor types,17 and, as would be expected, the Flos sanctorum is a near verbatim copy of Jacobus’s text.

As such, Nahuatl and Maya discourses on such topics are commonly found through-out their religious texts.20 The vast majority of these derive from either a dis-cussion of the seventh article of faith pertaining to the humanity of Christ (“He will come again to judge the living and the dead”),21 biblical exegeses on Luke 21 or Matthew 24–25 normally read during the first Sunday of Ad-vent, or general sermons on eschatological topics, typically the torments of hell. These discourses and whatever biblical portents they contain should Table 3.1. The Fifteen Signs in Peter Damian’s De novissimis et Antichristo (Eleventh Century)191.

That said, and as will be seen below, select signs could and did on occasion influence a general discussion of the Final Judgment.Despite such general references, ecclesiastics knew of the signs them-selves. Commenting on the 1650 earthquake that devastated Cuzco, Peru, the Franciscan chronicler fray Diego de Córdova Salinas claimed that the city witnessed a sign:One of the fifteen signs that Saint Jerome discovered in the Annals of the Hebrews that must precede the Final Judgment, and the last (sign), he says, will be an earthquake wherein the mountains will be like a spool, the mountain peaks will unhinge from their foundations, the cliffs and rocks will be like dry leaves carried in the air, and men will flee to the withered and dry fields out of dread and fear.25Throughout my research, I have discovered multiple colonial renditions of The Fifteen Signs in native- language texts—some in Nahuatl, others in Yuca-tec Maya. In Nahuatl texts, the signs most commonly appear sporadically worked into a general eschatological discourse and are seldom listed or even appear in their entirety. In contrast, Maya texts most frequently mention the Table 3.4. The Fifteen Signs in Thomas Aquinas’s Summa theologica (Thirteenth Century)241. Sea will rise fifteen cubits2.

To better understand the significance of The Fifteen Signs in the Teabo Manuscript, the following provides an examination of central Mexican and Yucatecan texts that contain the signs, their authors, and an analysis of the signs themselves to illustrate similarities and differences.Nahuatl TextsAs mentioned, Nahuatl texts rarely present the signs individually as a list, and fray Juan Bautista Viseo provides the only exception of which I am aware. Bautista was a Franciscan who lectured at the Colegio de Santa Cruz in Tla-telolco. He learned Nahuatl at a young age and was proficient in his abilities. Among his many Nahuatl works is his 1606 Sermonario, a large sermonary that provided extensive and lengthy sermons to be delivered on the four Sun-days of Advent and during the feast days of St. Andrew and the Immacu-late Conception. Produced in the “Golden Age” of Nahuatl text production when early ecclesiastics and native assistants collaborated to create some of the finest literary examples available, the sermonary was a result of a massive Table 3.5.

Regardless, Bautista states, “Yece çan achi quezquitlamantli tetza-huitl nictecpancapohuaz in quimohohuilia S. Hieronymo, yhuan S. Buena-ventura” (But I will list only a few omens as Saint Jerome and Saint Bonaven-ture list).29 The text also relates that St. Jerome said that he had read these signs in the Annales Hebraeorum, but that Jerome failed to mention if the signs would occur in immediate succession, or be spread out over time. The Sermonario then lists the signs, giving each one additional commentary and discussion oftentimes supported from other scriptural passages.The majority of Bautista’s signs (see Table 3.6) closely follow those found in the Flos sanctorum. However, the first sign and its measurement of fifteen cubits is similar to that of Damian and Aquinas. Most if not all of these works would likely have been available to Bautista and his Nahua aides. That said, Bautista’s text takes ample opportunity to elucidate on each sign and describe the overall hopelessness of sinners at the Final Judgment. One noticeable deviation is the mention of the stones breaking into eight, not four, pieces. Here, the text employs parallel constructions, so familiar to Nahua rhetoric, Table 3.6. The Fifteen Signs in Bautista’s 1606 Sermonario1. Sea will rise fifteen cubits (caxtolmolicpitl)2. Sea will fall and be barely visible3. Sea creatures walk on the water and yell4.

The signs appear in the second sermon as part of a lengthier discussion on the Final Judgment detailing the glory that awaits the righteous and the torment of all sinners.As mentioned, Anunciación does not list the signs, but employs them as part of the general narrative. Moreover, the text indicates that the signs de-rive from the Bible and fails to give any other sources:Yehica yn axcan, yn ayamo mochiua: uel achtopa techmonemactilia, tech-machtopaylhuilia yn totecuiyo Iesu Christo yn ipan Sancto Euangelio, yn quenin tetzauhmachiotl ualyacattiaz, yn aic yuhque omochiuh tlalticpac, atle ynamic, uel temamauhti, uel tecuecuechmicti ym muchiuaz.33(Wherefore now, before it [the Final Judgment] happens, first and foremost our lord Jesus Christ gives us, prophesizes to us in the Holy Gospel about the ominous signs that will come first; never has it oc-curred in such a way on earth, it is without equal, it will be very fright-ening, very scary.)Not all the signs are mentioned—Anunciación employs nine—and the signs themselves are simplified and lack lengthy descriptions (see Table 3.7). The text also mentions a sign not included in the traditional fifteen, but frequently cited throughout the Bible as a portent before the Final Judgment: the sun turning black and the moon failing to shine.34 In the end, Anunciación, and presumably his native assistants, appear unconcerned with listing all the signs or even distinguishing those from the Bible and those cited elsewhere. Instead, the apparent goal was to emphasize a few of the fearful and chaotic signs preceding the Final Judgment to encourage faithfulness now.

The manuscript contains a wide variety of doc-trinal material from the lives of saints to doctrinal treatises on the end of the world. Among this collection of topics is a Nahuatl text with the Latin title “de Judicio Finali” (on the Final Judgment) that includes The Fifteen Signs and was likely composed in the 1640s or 1650s.36 Similar to Anunciación’s work, the text weaves the signs together with other biblical portents in its eschato-logical discussion. The signs listed in this text fail to follow the order of any existing text and vary markedly from any New World rendition I have seen. To be sure, similarities exist, and many of the signs are included in the nar-rative. However, the text does omit the signs of the sea receding out of sight, Table 3.7.

It seems as though the author used The Fifteen Signs as a canvas on which to paint a work of narrative and description that occasionally included dialogue. For example, the typical sign of the burning of the earth appears thusly:Auh iquac ilhuicacpa quiualmiualiz in tto d. yn tletl ynic tlalli xotlaz ynic tlatlaz tlalticpactli nouian yuhquin tlequiauiz yuhquin tletzontli37 tzitze-liuiz pixauiz nauhcampa ualeuaz in tletl ualicoyocatiaz ualcuecuetlacatiaz ualla chinotiaz, auh mocennepanoquiui ynic muchi quitlatizq yn cema-nauatl. yc cen miquizq in tpc tlaca, yuan yn mochintin yolque in manenenq . . . , mochtin quicentlatizq quimichinoz, yc tlamiz yc poliuiz yn cema-nauatl aocmo nemoaz aocmo yoliuaz, aocmo tlacatiuaz.38(And when our lord God sends fire from heaven, then the land will catch fire, the earth will burn. Everywhere it will be like it is raining fire, like flames will be falling, sprinkling, from the four directions the fire will come roaring, making lots of noise, it will approach burning the fields. And they [the fires] will combine so that all the world will burn. Once and for all the people will die and all living things, the four- legged animals . . . all will be completely burned, it will scorch them. Thus the world will end, be destroyed; no longer will there be living, no longer will things exist, no longer will there be births.)Such description betrays the style of Carochi and his native assistants and is indicative of a fading Nahuatl prose that would not survive into the eigh-teenth century.The document betrays a high degree of creativity when working with the signs. Like the others, particularly Bautista’s Sermonario, the Carochi text frequently draws upon metaphors and couplets characteristic of classical Na- huatl. For example, when speaking of the state of the resurrected bodies of the good and evil, the Carochi manuscript states,ca in qualtin cenca chipauaq yezq pepetlacazq, yuhquin tonatiuh mocuepaz yn in tlalnacayo, ynic tlanextizq, auh in amo qualtin vel tliltiq vel pochectiq yezq vel catzauaq vel potonq. etc.39([T]he good ones are very clean, they will shimmer, their bodies will become like the sun so that they shine. But the bad ones are really black, they will be really smoky, really dirty, really smelly, etc.)Interestingly, fray Bernardino de Sahagún in Book Ten of the Florentine Codex consistently describes the “bad” people as filthy, dirty, and malodorous. The"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"d o o m s d a y a n d t h e m a y a ✢ 149description of the bodies of the wicked would have resonated well with a Nahua audience that viewed the excess of filth and foul odors with negative connotations.Other examples exist of the signs influencing a discussion of the Final Judgment in various Nahuatl texts. For example, in a sermon discussing the seventh article of faith pertaining to the Godhead in the 1548 Dominican Doctrina, the text provides a general description of the events of the last days that includes burning oceans and rivers, the deaths of mankind, animals, and birds, and the destruction and flattening of all mountains and buildings.40 On other occasions, The Fifteen Signs appear to influence Nahuatl discus-sions of the portents as recorded in Luke 21 and Matthew 24. Such occurred in Paredes’s Promptuario to include the rising of the ocean and earthquakes that level mountains and houses,41 and again in Bautista’s 1604 work “Book of the Misery and Brevity of the Life of Man.” Here in his discussion of the Final Judgment that describes how people “nentlamattinemizque, neneciuh-tinemizque, quiteociuhtinemizque, camictinemizque in miquiztli, in ipampa cenca huey nemauhtiliztli” (will go about languished, panting, hungering and wishing for death because of the very great fear), he blends into his trea-tise various signs including how people lose their sense, hide in caves, the leveling of all homes and buildings, comets, and the rising of the ocean.42 As with many others, the text does not appear overly concerned with dis-tinguishing portents derived from The Fifteen Signs from those with biblical origins. In a way, both the Bible and The Fifteen Signs—and no doubt other apocalyptic writings—created a reservoir of portents from which authors of Nahuatl texts could draw and create their treatises.Maya TextsThe Fifteen Signs appear listed in four Maya texts. The signs located in the Morley Manuscript and the Tusik have received some attention from both Whalen and Knowlton.43 Yet I have discovered the signs in two additional texts: the Teabo Manuscript and the “Maya Sermons” copybook of an un-known provenance. Certainly each text contains its own version of the signs by omitting some phrases while adding others, listing the signs in a preferen-tial order, and illustrating a localized orthography and prose. That said, simi-larities exist as well; a comparison of all four texts reveals these important similarities and differences.The signs found within the Teabo Manuscript, Tusik, and the “Maya Ser-mons” text betray the most similarity. Yet the congruity between the Teabo Manuscript and the “Maya Sermons” text extends even further to include a preface of sorts intended to introduce the signs, something which the Morley"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"150 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tManuscript and Tusik omit in general. Like Bautista’s 1606 Nahuatl text, both Maya texts seemingly designed their cognate prefaces and the subse-quent signs as a sermon for a Sunday in Advent, likely the first. The Teabo text erroneously cites the twenty- fifth chapter of St. Luke as its thematic source. Because St. Luke only contains twenty- four chapters, it is likely that the author(s) intended to cite the eschatological chapter of Matthew 25, or even Luke 21 as does the “Maya Sermons” text, although the content of the Teabo text alludes to Matthew 25 as the source. Either way, it is unlikely a priest would have made such a mistake, thus further betraying a Maya hand.The “Maya Sermons” text states the importance of understanding “the book of his coming, of Final Judgment (Apocalypse)” and cites St. Bernard and St. John Chrysostom for their study of the signs regarding the sun, moon, and stars, labeling them as ah kinob.44 As mentioned, the ah kin were Maya priests who served in various religious rituals among the precontact Maya, including those pertaining to astronomy.45 The text then joins the Teabo Manuscript in citing St. Bernard and St. Jerome, also referring to them as ah kinob for their revealing of the fifteen signs that precede the coming of Christ. St. Jerome is known for his translation of the Bible into Latin—the Vulgate—and his commentaries. In Yucatan, he is often associated with The Fifteen Signs, and a fresco of his image, with the lion he reportedly healed ac-cording to texts such as The Golden Legend and Flos sanctorum, appears in a sacristy in Teabo’s cathedral (see figure 3.1).46 The two manuscripts are obvi-ously cognate. Yet each exercises a degree of artistic license when creating the text, adding a shade of detail here while removing a line of description there. For example, the Teabo Manuscript continues the theme seen previously re-garding the sheep and the goats recorded in Matthew 25 by inserting vari-ous comments referencing the chapter’s content of charitable works allowing Christ to reward the righteous for such. The order of the signs themselves within the Tusik, “Maya Sermons,” and Teabo Manuscript; their content; and even particular phrases within them all illustrate a strong likeness (see Tables 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11). Sign for sign, the Tusik text is the longest, followed by the “Maya Sermons” and then the Teabo Manuscript, which perhaps is slightly terser. Moreover, for reasons unknown, the Teabo Manuscript includes only twelve of the fifteen signs.47 That the Tusik and “Maya Sermons” texts contain similar versions of The Fifteen Signs is not wholly surprising, considering that the majority of the doctrinal content of the former is also found in the latter.48 Significantly, all three texts use the phrase “through or because of a miracle” represented by tumen mactzil in the ninth sign and yoklal mactzil in the thirteenth sign.

No other European source uses this phrase, so we may safely assume it is a colonial invention that the Teabo Manuscript, Tusik, and “Maya Ser-mons” text use similarly to describe a miraculous restoration. Its inclusion in specific locations among specific signs testifies to a similar knowledge of that narrative of The Fifteen Signs found among learned Maya in the communi-ties from which these texts emerged. Whether shared among these locales through a written or oral account—or both—it is clear that these communi-ties preserved a similar version of The Fifteen Signs. Interestingly, The Fifteen Signs continues to influence the Maya today, at least in Tusik. The Tusik is an 1875 copy of an older original made by Marcos Balam. While researching the Maya in Tusik from 1978 to 1980, Paul Sullivan discovered a handwritten copy of The Fifteen Signs. According to Sullivan, the more modern text was remarkably similar to the one in the Tusik.50 Although the Maya owner of the text, San Itza—the town historian and shaman—could not read its words, he knew what it said because his father used to read it to him and he had memo-rized the text. Of the various texts San possesses, he considers this particular text, which he calls a “History of God,” extremely important.In her initial analysis of the Morley Manuscript, Gretchen Whalen noted that some of its content derived from Jacobus’s The Golden Legend, and addi-tional research of my own has uncovered further links with medieval texts.51 Among its many religious topics is The Fifteen Signs. Standing apart from the other Maya texts, the Morley Manuscript provides a somewhat differ-ent redaction of the signs (see Table 3.12). The manuscript outlines the signs numerically and, as with the other Maya texts, attributes them to St. Jerome and “his book of holy writing.” However, there are differences not seen in the Teabo, Tusik, or “Maya Sermons” texts, and some are quite divergent. Aside from the occasional sign being out of order, the seventh sign detailing the gathering of men and beasts to cry out unintelligibly reflects a creative invention. Likewise creative are signs twelve, thirteen, and fifteen. Bloody rain appears in sign twelve, and although none of the more common texts include the sign, it does appear in the Apocalypse of Thomas and the Psalter among others. As with its medieval predecessors, the thirteenth sign in the Morley Manuscript indicates that all men will die. What is unique is its mention of shining crosses:On the thirteenth day there will be the call of a trumpet from heaven. The trumpet says, “He saved the world, our lord, when he died on the"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"154 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tholy cross.” This day (the thirteenth day) the crosses that are in the for-ests and within the towns will shine and will light up as the light of the sun.52Since its introduction to the colonial Maya, the Christian cross and its mean-ing has included both European and Maya elements. In Europe, medieval scholars often blended the Cross with the Tree of Life, which some reported to have produced the wood for the Cross itself. Indeed, many medieval and early modern ecclesiastics viewed the Tree of Life as a representation of Christ—a belief held by some Christian religions today.53In Yucatan, the cross represented the organization of the cosmos as a quincunx with four directional corners and a center. Each space was asso-ciated with trees and the tree in the center, and, as we saw in the Genesis Commentary, the yax che (first or green tree) was of particular importance for its role as an axis mundi upholding and connecting the under, middle, and upper worlds. In colonial religious texts, this tree became associated with the Tree of Life, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Cross. Perhaps the most vivid example of the Cross’s role in Yucatan concerns the Caste War (1847–1901) and the Cruzob Maya who took direction from talk-ing crosses.54 More commonly and relevant to the sign listed here, through-out the colonial period numerous examples existed of crosses erected at the Table 3.12.

No other text includes this instrument, but it is surely inspired by the Bible. The trumpet is used frequently throughout the Bible to herald an announcement or event commonly associated with the Final Judgment. Perhaps most relevant here are the seven trumpets blown by seven angels to usher in apocalyptic events as recorded in Revelation 8–11. In the end, the Maya maestro composing the Morley Manuscript drew obvious inspiration from existing versions—oral or written or both—of The Fifteen Signs while also taking the liberty of famil-iarizing the content according to personal and cultural preferences. Inter-estingly, although Coronel would eventually employ sections of the Morley Manuscript for his Maya Discursos (1620), The Fifteen Signs fail to appear listed in his printed work. That said, a few signs, including the rising of the ocean and the unintelligible shouting of creatures, do appear in his discussion of the signs before the Final Judgment.55Concluding SermonsFollowing its treatment of the signs, the Flos sanctorum includes some closing remarks concerning the appearance of the Anti- Christ and the Final Judg-ment.56 As a popular hagiography depicting the lives of the saints, the Flos sanctorum circulated widely in both Europe and New Spain, although the In-quisition banned certain versions.57 As mentioned earlier, various Maya texts derived their content from its pages. In regard to the Flos sanctorum’s final passages following The Fifteen Signs, Maya texts occasionally will include a similar section, although I have not uncovered one close enough to be con-sidered cognate. As noted, the Teabo Manuscript ends its discussion of The Fifteen Signs at the twelfth sign; the next page begins a new discourse, and thus the manuscript does not include such concluding apocalyptic remarks.However, the Tusik and “Maya Sermons” texts both include such ser-mons, and they parallel each other.58 The texts outline invocations to Christ petitioning for mercy and grace during the Second Coming and further de-scriptions of the forthcoming destruction. Interestingly, the last ten or so lines of these closing remarks found in the Tusik and “Maya Sermons” have a loose cognate with a passage found on page 29v of Coronel’s 1620 Discursos in its section discussing “how God is our savior and glorifier.” And the intriguing correlations with other texts continue. When the “Maya Sermons” and Tusik end their harmony, the Tusik continues with a commentary on Matthew 25 that parallels that found in the Teabo Manuscript.59 For its part, the “Maya"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"156 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tSermons” text finishes its paragraph with six or so lines that closely follow the final six lines of the paragraph in Coronel’s Discursos.60The next paragraph of the “Maya Sermons” text relates the Final Judg-ment that takes place in the Valley of Jehoshaphat61 near Jerusalem, where, according to Joel 3:2, all nations are gathered to be judged. In particular, the narrative lists those who will be judged, including popes, cardinals, and the rulers of the earth. This paragraph again runs cognate with other texts, par-ticularly a later section of the Discursos discussion on how Christ will come to judge the living and the dead (see Table 3.13).62 This discourse on the Final Judgment also is similar to the narrative found in the Nahuatl 1548 Domini-can Doctrina.63 At times, the lines are remarkably similar between both the Nahuatl and two Maya texts, suggesting a similar source, possibly a European text, or an oral discourse common to evangelization. General ObservationsAs evidenced from the texts examined, The Fifteen Signs clearly played a role in the doctrinal instruction of both Nahuas and Mayas. Regarding European archetypes, none of the texts listing The Fifteen Signs follows with exactness the signs as outlined in a European text. The signs and their order in the Teabo Manuscript, Tusik, and “Maya Sermons” text loosely follow those found in the Damian and Aquinas texts. However, there are differences in both order and content that suggest a creative redaction including elements from other works such as the earth burning with a purifying fire.

Thus, multiple European models and versions influenced the signs in central Mexico and Yucatan. Although Nahuatl and Maya redactions of The Fifteen Signs owe their origins to Europe, the Nahua and Maya authors that com-posed these texts included their own interpretations and renditions.These native- language texts also betray the signs’ particular popularity among the Maya, surviving in unofficial, Maya- authored copybooks and in the memories of contemporary Maya elders such as San Itza. The number of Maya religious texts available to scholars pales in comparison to those in Nahuatl. Yet even in these reduced numbers, The Fifteen Signs appears listed in four separate texts and influenced the primary colonial sermonary printed in Maya. This is striking when considering that extant Maya religious texts provide examples of only two confessional manuals and a handful of cate-chisms—texts that dominate the Nahuatl and European material. Put simply, when comparing the content of existing Maya religious texts, The Fifteen Signs appears to have been very popular. Texts detailing the Creation would be the best rival for those relating The Fifteen Signs.The extent of cognate texts evident among the eschatological texts in Maya of The Fifteen Signs and its accompanying discourses is impressive (see Table 3.13). Indeed, it is remarkable that the signs and/or their accompany-ing discourses found their way into the locally authored and preserved Maya Christian copybooks and Chilam Balams of various communities, as well as in a friar’s printed text. Again, because these texts were recopied and redacted numerous times throughout the colonial period and beyond, an attempt to discover which text influenced which would be fraught with uncertainty. That said, because Coronel’s work appeared in 1620, we know that some of these texts were circulating by at least the early seventeenth century if not before. Coronel himself states that his Discursos is a compilation of “various papers, that with my labor I have collected and copied, that the old priests had written, amending some things that in this era are not used, and correct-ing that which was not correct.”64 Thus, because portions of the Discursos are an edited edition of older sermons, it is possible, and even likely, that some of its content, including the cognate portions mentioned here, originated in the sixteenth century.65Regardless, when juxtaposing the cognate texts, their similarities, and their alterations, the question arises again regarding how these texts circu-lated. Compare the following manuscripts’ rendition of the sign proclaim-ing the gathering of sea animals on the water to moan and wail in fear of the coming Judgment Day:"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"158 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tTEABO MANUSCRIPT:4. he tu Canpil U Kinil bin Yanac chiCul he tulacal u bal Kaknabobe lay cayobe = bin u mol ubaob yokol haob tan u tah auatob y Y acanob yokol haa yoKlal u sacibob ti xot Kin cu talel lae:(4.

However, the deviations between the two texts are greater and more frequent than those seen in the fourth sign. For example, the Teabo Manuscript erroneously cites Luke 25 as a source of its sermon; remember that Luke contains only twenty- four chap-ters and that two popular eschatological exegeses in the Bible are found in Luke 21 and Matthew 25. The sermon seems to have confused the two, thus producing “Luke 25.” The “Maya Sermons” text contains the correct cita-tion of Luke 21. Moreover, although both texts indicate their reading in the season of Advent, they differ in their books of reference for the portentous signs. The Teabo Manuscript cites a “book of wisdom by St. Bernard and St. Jerome, ah kinob,” whereas the “Maya Sermons” text states the importance of understanding the book of Revelation and cites a “book of wisdom by St. Bernard and St. John Chrysostom, ak kinob.”Could such similarities and variations, in addition to those orthographic and stylistic variations so evident in the texts, have occurred if the signs and the sermon were circulated among various cahob solely via written text? Pos-sibly, particularly if the archetypes originated from the Maya schools and, once disseminated to the various cahob, became altered over the centuries. Yet such characteristics could also derive as a combination of oral and writ-ten transmission. The Fifteen Signs themselves held in the memory of learned Maya would have distinct characteristics to be sure, but also would have the most likelihood of retaining a similar format due to the terse nature of each sign. Yet the lengthier passages—such as the sermon above—are more prone to alteration, forgetfulness, and augmentation in their delivery, thus allowing the increased degree of alteration observed. In the end, it is nearly impossible to know for certain how the text was conveyed and redacted. However, the Teabo Manuscript and other Maya Christian copybooks strongly suggest the existence of oral templates in addition to those written for various religious themes that the maestros and notaries of each cah made their own upon its recording and eventual retelling. Once again we see the impact of the sphere of reducción, with ecclesiastic and Maya- authored religious texts likely cre-ated in the schools and then branching out to circulate among the forbidden Maya- preserved Chilam Balams and Christian copybooks, where their vari-ous written and oral forms became altered over the centuries.Table 3.13 further illustrates the importance of the Apocalypse to the Maya. Period beginnings and endings are topics well ingrained into Maya culture.70 Regarding period endings, Whalen noted that “the recording of cataclysmic events within a structured temporal sequence characterizes in-digenous Maya genres, both the katun counts, and stories of previous world"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"d o o m s d a y a n d t h e m a y a ✢ 163endings like those in the Popol Vuh. Thus The Fifteen Signs provided new information in a form somewhat familiar to a Maya audience.”71 This can also be extended to include all the myriad apocalyptic texts found through-out Maya works, including the parable of the sheep and goats discussed in chapter 2.Apocalyptic themes of destruction and renewal continued among the Maya throughout the nineteenth century, as clearly demonstrated by the Caste War. What began as a regional and political conflict soon blossomed into a racial war fueled by a native religion focused on the veneration of a talking cross at Chan Santa Cruz. The cross encouraged an uprising of its Maya followers, the Cruzob, to end the domination of the Whites and begin a new age for the Maya.72 Although the Cruzob’s millenarian goals came to a disappointing end in the early twentieth century, the Maya- Christian be-lief of a new age ushered in by calamitous events continues to exist among many Maya today.Furthermore, we should also consider the influence of the eschatologi-cally minded Franciscans on the Maya texts. Inspired by Joachim of Fiore—the prevailing prophet of the Apocalypse—and the Spiritual Franciscans, many of the early Franciscans brought with them to the New World a mil-lenarian tradition that favored apocalyptic teaching. Even Columbus, who associated himself with the Joachimite tradition, was steeped in the tradition estimating that the world had only 155 years remaining.73 Unlike in central Mexico, the Franciscans dominated the evangelization of Yucatan. It would not be unreasonable to assume that The Fifteen Signs regularly found its way into the teachings of the friars.Finally, the discovery of The Fifteen Signs among Nahuatl and Maya texts calls further attention to the European sources of those texts. We can trace the evolution of The Fifteen Signs from its medieval origins in Ireland, to early modern Europe and Spain, across the Atlantic to central Mexico and Yucatan, where it was translated into Nahuatl and Maya, and even into the twentieth century, with Maya elders still preserving the legend. Yet this journey from medieval Europe to modern- day Yucatan does not come without its losses. Although The Fifteen Signs experienced popularity among Maya Christian copybooks and texts, knowledge of the signs seems to have fallen into the realm of oral history subject to the memory of those, like San Itza, who had once heard the signs recited.At the conclusion of the twelfth and final sign included in the Teabo Manu-script, an unknown Maya author stated that on December 11, 1803, he fin-ished “a book called Genesis in order for it to be read.” Although penned in"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"164 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p ta different ink and, likely, at a different time than the signs, and although we cannot be sure, it is possible that the author considered The Fifteen Signs as the conclusion of what began as a commentary on Genesis beginning with the Creation, Christ and his lineage, his Second Coming and role as Judge in the last days, and finally the signs that would precede these last days and the end of the world and rebirth of another. In all, it makes for an all- inclusive narrative of the world from beginning to end, and this narrative, as the author states, was to be read and shared. The remaining texts that appear in the Teabo Manuscript lack any clear connections with the previous narra-tive and represent the occasional ad hoc nature of Maya Christian copybooks and their compilations."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"166 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tThe Fifteen Signs before Doomsday, pp. 33–35.(P . 33)ad qua nos perducat Amen Dominica: adbentucCume Uenexit Eilius Dominica 25: CapituloHE than lic a uuyiCex lae Uay helae Ɔiban tu kaytah cilich Nabil yglesia lae = Ɔiban tu tzolol ti cilich S.to Euangelio tumen Euangelio Ɔiban tumen San luCas tu hotukal u peƆel U capitoloil U chun tzeec helelae lay u nah oces ti olex = Con74 ya uinicilexe lay u nah a Ɔab a xicinex ti than = Yn mahante bay ten a uetelex = he Ca bin Uluc U cilich al Suhuye tu noh tePalile y tulacal Angelesob = tu pache Ca tun Culac tu Sillail u noh tePalil U cilich Ɔayatzil lae = binix homol acbal cah tu tan binix U huƆub U baob nachil = tu hunalob bay licil U hun molcintic U canan taman ah Canan tamanobe = bay ta uuYahexe oheltexe Yn Ya Uinicilexe = bin a chaex lay than = Cin tzolic lae lay DominiCa lae U ChuCan U Dominicail = aeruento lae = U Yulel Ca yumil ti Jesuchristo lae = Ca bin Kuchuc tu kinil Yulel U Ɔab hunkul cuxtal = y hunkul cimil lay xot kin u kaba lay ta uuyahex Same = bin Yanac ChiCu-lob ti kin y ti : U: y ti ekob lay Ɔiban tu Yunil miyatz = tumen San Bernado y San Jeronimo ah Kinob"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"d o o m s d a y a n d t h e m a y a ✢ 167(P . 33)ad qua nos perducat Amen Dominica: adbentucCume Uenexit Eilius Dominica 25: CapituloHere are the words which you hear here today that have been written in the preaching of the holy mother church; it has been written in the ex-planation of the holy gospel according to the gospel written by St. Luke in his twenty- fifth chapter, the theme of this sermon today, it is necessary that you believe.

The role of Mary as inter-cessor and advocate likewise appears in the Teabo Manuscript. The pages im-mediately following The Fifteen Signs (pp. 36–37) appear as a first- person plea to both Mary and Christ for their divine assistance in attaining salvation. It is possible that this text was meant as a concluding sermon to The Fifteen Signs. However, due both to the different content of the sermon found in the Teabo Manuscript when compared to other concluding discourses on the signs, and to the different orthography and pen of the text, I have chosen to discuss it separately. Medicinal remedies, discussed in the next chapter, separate this text from a text on indulgences (pp. 40–41), which, although included in this chapter, is a separate text altogether. Like the first text, the indulgence text appears on a separate page, and both are in the same hand, which differs from that of the previous section.The author(s) and compiler(s) of the Teabo Manuscript intentionally included both the plea to Mary and Christ and the indulgence text. This chapter explores their inclusion by specifically examining the role of Mary and indulgences among the Maya. Moreover, this chapter attempts to fur-ther understand these discourses by comparing them with others of a similar nature found throughout Nahuatl and Maya texts. In the end, these seem-ingly random additions to the Teabo Manuscript serve to shed additional light on those aspects of Christianity that the Maya of Teabo chose to re cord and preserve in their copybooks.Mary and the MayaIn Catholicism, Mary holds an especially important role. Born without the stain of Adam’s original sin in what is known as the Immaculate Conception, she lived a sinless life that included birthing and mothering the Almighty God. When Mary completed her mission on earth, her body and spirit rose into heaven in glory, known as the Assumption. As the Brazilian expres-sion indicates, Mary plays an important role as intermediary between man-kind and God. The God of Spanish Catholics was loving, but was also a being whose wrath and condemnation should be feared. Such Catholics simi-larly afforded Mary qualities more commonly associated with females such as patience, understanding, and forgiveness; as the mother of God, she was the prime candidate to serve as an intermediary—a role she fills to this day.1Long before the arrival of Spaniards in the New World, then, Mary played a large role in the local religion of Spain. Yet her accessibility as the mortal mother of God extended beyond that of emotional compassion and"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"m a r y, c h r i s t, a n d t h e p o p e ✢ 175understanding to include physical protection. Like St. James the Moor- slayer, Mary protected Spanish Christians in their fight against Muslims during the Reconquista, and the success and acceleration of the Christian takeover of Spain only increased her popularity.2 As early as the twelfth century, Marian images and shrines began to dominate the region’s religious landscape and won the greatest number of devotees. This devotion only increased through-out the sixteenth century and held strong during the Baroque period even as the votive devotion to Christ increased.3From the beginning of Spanish contact among the natives of New Spain, Mary figured prominently among the early conquistadors and ecclesiastics alike. Columbus frequently employed her name when naming newly discov-ered islands.4 Hernán Cortés displayed her image on his standard, and he re-portedly left Marian images in native temples on his march inland to the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.5 Sixteenth- century Franciscan chroniclers re cord the popularity of Mary among the natives and recount various miracles she facili-tated. Mendieta recalls one early occasion among the natives Columbus en-countered. During a storm, four natives took shelter in a cave. One began to invoke the name of Mary for protection against the lightning; the others ridiculed him for the effort. As a result, lightning killed the three naysayers without harming the devotee.6 In another instance, a native noblewoman of Xochipila was in her last extremity when Mary appeared and gave her a few tablespoons of divine medicine that allowed her an additional month of life.7Mary likewise found her way to Yucatan. Cortés’s 1519 expedition that would eventually lead him to Tenochtitlan began with his visit to the Maya in Cozumel. Fray Diego de Landa recounts how using a native interpreter, Cortés preached to the natives against their idols and encouraged them to honor the Cross and Mary and left images of both in their temples. Later, another sermon by Cortés on the subject reportedly left such an impression on the Maya that “they came out to the shore saying to the Spaniards who passed: ‘María, María, Cortés, Cortés.’ ”8The ecclesiastics that followed Cortés likewise emphasized Mary in their instruction. As Louise Burkhart persuasively demonstrates, Mary became a popular subject in Nahuatl religious texts.9 Regarding Maya texts, although Mary occupies the subject of the various Marian prayers, such as the Hail Mary and Salve Regina (Hail, Holy Queen), found in Coronel and Beltrán’s doctrinas, in general she fails to appear as the subject of sermons or other trea-tises in printed texts. An exception to this would be Coronel’s discussion of her role as Christ’s mother in his Discursos.10 In Maya Christian copybooks, Mary similarly appears frequently in prayers, although specific sermons dedi-cated to her are rarer. This, I believe, is not a result of a lack of knowledge"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"176 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tof Mary, but simply reflects the lack of existing religious texts in Maya from which to sample.The Franciscan order, which dominated Spain as well as the Yucatan, em-phasizes an emulation of Christ and his teachings.11 As early as the Marian sermons of St. Anthony of Padua, Mary and Christ both played large roles in the teachings of the order. Thus regardless of the paucity of extant written discourses in Maya dedicated to Mary, the Maya were well aware of her im-portance in Catholicism. The bishop of Yucatan, fray Francisco de Toral, in-structed that Maya children learn the prayers in a particular order, waiting to receive the subsequent prayer until the first had been learned. First, the Maya learned the Our Father, then the Hail Mary, then the Creed, and finally the Salve Regina.12 Significantly, two of the four basic prayers concerned Mary. Moreover, Mary and her life were the focus of various feast days that the natives were required to observe, including the feasts of Our Lady, Assump-tion, Nativity, Purification, and Annunciation.13Perhaps the most obvious role of Mary in Yucatan was as the region’s pa-troness as Our Lady of Izamal. Cogolludo re cords that in his efforts to con-vert the Maya, Landa installed an image of Mary constructed in Guatemala and brought to Izamal in the 1550s. The account relates various miracles as-sociated with the image—the majority of which correspond closely to those wrought by saint images in Spain and with the cult of the saints more gen-erally—including a 1648 pilgrimage by the Virgin to Merida to rid the city of plague.14 In addition, Mary came to dominate the names of female bap-tized infants, churches, and various religious institutions; she served as the patron saint to cofradías (religious brotherhoods) and Maya communities.15 Among Nahuatl and Maya testaments, her name was frequently invoked by the dying, and although the Nahuas generally possessed and bequeathed many more household images of Mary, her image also appears commonly among those few Maya testators who did make such bequests.16 Today, Mary maintains her dominance of the New World in the form of Our Lady of Guadalupe, patroness of the Americas.17An integral part of Marian devotion includes breviary anthems and texts dedicated to her. The Catholic Church requires its clergy to recite the Liturgy of the Hours, or the Breviary, daily. Included in the Breviary are various Marian texts and four Marian prayers that could be sung: Alma Redemptoris Mater, Ave Regina Caelorum, Regina Caeli, and Salve Regina. Moreover, pos-sibly the most popular book owned in the Middle Ages by the laity was the book of hours, and Mary figured prominently in this work. Indeed, these devotional books almost always had at their core a devotional text known as the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary that included scriptures,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"m a r y, c h r i s t, a n d t h e p o p e ✢ 177psalms, antiphons (sung prayers), responsories, and other readings centered on Mar y.18Similar orations of petition and praise to the mother of Christ found their way into both Nahuatl and Maya religious texts. Nahuatl catechisms, sermonaries, and doctrinas of various lengths contribute to a sizable corpus of Marian texts. Many instruct the reader on the role of Mary in Catholicism, while others offer a wide variety of prayers. Certainly many Nahuatl prayers were standard translations of the Hail Mary or Salve. Yet others represented verbose expositions of such prayers that created elaborate, poetic invocations which emphasized the humility of the petitioner and the glory of Mary.19The Maya prayers to Mary in the Teabo Manuscript resemble those poetic expositions found in Nahuatl texts. Certainly the inclusion of an invo-cation to Mary and Christ—although the former appears more prominently than the latter—in the Teabo Manuscript provides an important addition to the Marian material in Maya; others include a prayer to Mary found in the Kaua and the extensive folios dedicated to her in the “Maya Sermons” text.20 Yet the prayers in the Teabo Manuscript and the Kaua are most simi-lar in that they resemble both those petitions found in Nahuatl texts, and those devotional anthems and invocations so often seen throughout Euro-pean books of hours or the Little Office and various writings of theologians and Church fathers.Significant among the latter is St. John of Damascus, who was instru-mental in introducing the concept of Mary as a divine intercessor and wrote several important works on the Assumption.21 Although no direct transla-tion is evident, the invocation of Mary in the Teabo Manuscript resembles various passages of the Damascene’s sermons. Such resemblance is limited, however, as the text in the Teabo Manuscript rotates the recipient of its pleas between Mary and Christ in uneven intervals. As such, the text and its eclec-tic and creative format is unparalleled, at least to my knowledge, by any spe-cific European text.The passage contains both Maya and European elements. Parallel con-structions exist to give the text an altogether Maya character. For example, consider the passage, “hach otzilen cen ah tan kebanen Manbalen” (truly I am miserable, I am a great sinner, I am nothing). Another passage pleads for Christ to “Ca peɔucen tu kab ah chibalob y ah Cayballob ti yn pixane hek-lay cisinobe” (withdraw me from the hands of the wild animals and fisher-men of my soul, which are the devils). The comparison of wild animals to devils also appears in an illustrative story found in the Morley Manuscript and Coronel’s Discursos. The story is an example of the medieval genre of ex-empla that used contemporary examples to teach Christian concepts. Here,"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"178 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tthe devil in the form of an ah chibal, or wild animal, attacks a sinner only to be cast away by the fervent prayers of priests.22 As early as the Classic Period, evidence suggests that the Maya believed in co- essences. These were animals or natural phenomena that shared the consciousness of their human counter-parts. While the Maya owner is awake, his co- essence remains dormant; when asleep, the co- essence roams and, with certain personalities, could take the form of a wild animal to cause injury or death to its victims.23 During his fieldwork, Sullivan noted the persistence of this belief surrounding the late wife of San Itza. Some believed her death resulted from being killed “while in the form of a black dog, the guise she habitually assumed for nightly sexual assaults against a certain young man in the neighboring village.”24 Thus, the relationship between a ferocious wild animal and the evil spirit of the devil resonated well with Maya culture.However, although the passage includes the creativity of a Maya author, it draws upon various European themes. In one instance, various Old World epithets appear in the text as Christ is described as “u sasilil balCahhe” (the light of the world) and Mary as “u xaman ekil KakNabe” (the North Star of the sea). The first epithet references Christ’s self- proclamation as the light of the world found in John 8:12 and frequently employed throughout European religious texts.25 The second references the constant nature of the North Star to describe Mary’s ability to be a constant guide to Christ and salvation.26 The epithet appeared regularly throughout medieval and early modern times and is employed in one of the four Marian antiphons, Alma Redemptoris Mater. Indeed, in many ways the passage in the Teabo Manuscript is an expansive redaction of this antiphon, which reads as follows:Loving Mother of the Redeemer,gate of heaven, star of the seaassist your people who have fallen yet strive to rise again.To the wonderment of nature you bore your Creator,yet remained a virgin after as before.You who received Gabriel’s joyful greetinghave pity on us poor sinners.Clearly the Maya petition to Mary and Christ included in the Teabo Manu-script does not replicate the antiphon, although the genre or some other un-known text could have served as inspiration.27 In the end, the passage is a cre-ative piece that weaves both Maya and European elements together to form a text worthy of preservation in the copybook."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"m a r y, c h r i s t, a n d t h e p o p e ✢ 179Indulgences among the MayaIn the Kaua, its Marian prayer immediately follows the Genesis Commentary and is itself followed by a section Bricker and Miram term as “Papal Instruc-tions for Avoiding Purgatory.”28 Interestingly, the Teabo Manuscript follows a similar, although not exact, rubric. Following the prayer to Mary and Christ is a blank page and then a series of medicinal remedies recorded much later in the twentieth century (discussed in the next chapter). The following page (40) begins a new text that loosely corresponds thematically with the Kaua’s “Papal Instructions for Avoiding Purgatory” text. Comparing the two texts exposes immediately similar passages and lines. However, the majority of the passages in the two texts differ and generally fail to provide a line- for- line match.The passage in the Teabo Manuscript begins by citing those popes known for their support of indulgences; the popes mentioned are the same as those appearing in the Kaua. The text then speaks of the acts one must perform to earn an indulgence. According to Catholic doctrine, divine justice requires both an eternal and temporal punishment for sin. Although confession re-moves the eternal punishment from the penitent, the temporal consequences must occur either in this life or in purgatory. Indulgences draw upon the the-saurus ecclesiae (treasury of satisfactions) that Christ and the saints created with their overly abundant good works and bestow them upon worthy indi-viduals to remit the temporal punishment of sin. Medieval crusaders were among the first to receive such indulgences, but soon everyday individuals would have access to such benefits.29In the Spanish crusade of the Reconquista to restore Iberia to Chris-tianity from its Muslim conquerors, papal indulgences granted to the cru-saders flourished. Later, the early modern bula de la cruzada became the most popular way for average Spaniards to engage in the effort. Such bulls, called buletas, appeared as printed broadsheet summaries of the indulgence and were distributed by the thousands. Those willing to pay the relatively cheap price in alms could obtain such a document. Patrick O’Banion’s work illustrates how many such recipients “often saved them for years after they had expired” and even “hung them on the walls of their homes [or] . . . were buried with their copy.”30Various versions of the cruzada existed, but the most popular was the bula de vivos. This bull came in two forms. The bula común was most common and typically available for the relatively cheap price of two reales. The other was for the elites and for an increased price offered the same benefits.31 The"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"180 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tsuccess and popularity of the bula de vivos was impressive and allowed the bull to cross the Atlantic. The Yucatecan synod of 1722 ordered priests to “ex-plain the valor and importance of the indulgences of the Church, especially those of the cruzada, and what they [parishioners] should do for their part to have them.”32 In an effort to protect the natives from extortion, the Spanish government prohibited the sale of indulgences in native towns early on. This, however, did not reflect reality, and agents of the Santa Cruzada offered in-dulgences in native towns, sometimes announcing the sale with great pomp and circumstance that could include bands of trumpeters and other musical instruments. The curate of Chunhuhub stated that the Maya willingly and eagerly entered into contracts to obtain the bulls, although the coerced sale of indulgences occurred as well.33 From the late sixteenth to the early seven-teenth century, Pedro Sánchez de Aguilar—who would also conduct numer-ous investigations into the idolatries of the Maya—served as commissary of the Santa Cruzada, which was licensed to preach the benefits of such bulls and sell them in native towns. Aguilar and his commissaries were wildly suc-cessful, selling thousands upon thousands of bulls throughout the province.34Thus, indulgences reached even the most remote of Maya communities in New Spain, including Teabo. Reports exist that suggest the Maya some-times treated the bulls as sacred objects and even offered them sacrifices.35 Moreover, the lasting importance of such documents among the Maya is evident in their preservation. For example, in the Maya Christian copybook relating the Passion (GGMM no. 66) is a printed broadsheet of such an in-dulgence issued for the years 1798 and 1799 and available for two reales. An indulgence also appears in the copybook relating a Maya Arte de bien morir (GGMM no. 70a). And the hieroglyphic text of the Madrid Codex contains a section where, as John Chuchiak convincingly argues, a rare handwritten bull of the Santa Cruzada was used as a “patch.”36 Similar to Spanish owners of such indulgences, the Maya owners apparently desired to save these bulls and place them within their copybooks and other significant texts to enhance their spiritual value.37The Maya text offers various possible methods of receiving “u satal keban” (the loss of sin), or an indulgence, presumably after one has pur-chased a bull. Most involve praying the Hail Mary and Our Father five times in reference to the five wounds of Christ. Yet another concerns the possession and veneration of a Santo p_is. This term also appears in the Kaua, and Bricker and Miram translate it as “holy yardstick,” no doubt due to the definition of pis as “a measure” of sorts, while admitting that a Marian belt could also be meant.38 Because pis also carries the meaning of “hem,” I choose to translate it as such, and later in a section of the Teabo text not appearing in the Kaua"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"m a r y, c h r i s t, a n d t h e p o p e ✢ 181is a promise that “maac bin U tacsic uichil U noke matan U tabal tu tumuc ol cisino” (whoever will look intently at the cloth never will be trapped in the temptation of the devil).39 Other stated benefits derived from its veneration included prevention from sudden death—in which presumably the victim would not have a chance to confess before dying—mortal sin, offense, or even being struck by lightning, the latter perhaps resonating the strongest with Maya culture, as lightning was a distinguishing characteristic of the rain god Chac.40 What exactly “Santo pis” references is uncertain, although pos-sibilities include a piece of the holy robe of Christ that the Roman soldiers removed from him prior to his crucifixion, or some other portable yet vener-able article of clothing as the text also mentions the transport of this holy hem to other cahob, similar to a procession of a saint.41 In regard to Christ, the Gospel of Luke re cords the miraculous healing of a sick woman who merely touched the hem of his cloak, or the holy hem.42Both the prayer to Mary and Christ and the text on indulgences are brief and highly influenced by Christian themes. Yet both provide important insights into the contents of Maya Christian copybooks and the colonial religious landscape. The subject matter of the texts illustrates the dissemination of knowledge regarding Mary, Christ, and even the popes and their support of indulgences. Indeed, all such subjects appear frequently in the “Maya Ser-mons” copybook, particularly in regard to Marian texts. Certainly the Teabo texts betray Maya elements. However, the themes, figures, and general con-tents of the discourses reflect a European concern for the remission of one’s sins so as to enter the next life prepared. The two texts in the Teabo Manu-script and those two similar texts in the Kaua all undoubtedly originated from a similar source of unknown origin—perhaps from one of the many Euro-pean archetypes available, or a local creation in one of the Yucatecan schools. Regardless of their origin, these texts circulated among the Maya communi-ties to be recorded, altered, rewritten, modified, and preserved in books such as the Teabo Manuscript."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"182 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tPrayers to Mary and Christ, and an Indulgence Text, pp. 36–37, 40–41.(P . 36)43. . .

In such and such [day] of the month of (name), he/she died with or without a testament (name of the de-ceased), Spaniard or Mestizo, native of (name of town), single, wid-ower or husband to (name of spouse) native of (name of town). He was buried on the same day or on the following in the church of (name). He received, or not, the holy sacraments. And I (name) curate or deputy curate of the parish (name) took this account and signed it. Complete name and signature.6In addition to the book recording all the deaths, the synod instructed eccle-siastics to encourage the proper recording of a last will and testament for the natives before their death. This was to assist in both a fair division of their property and the well- being of their soul.7Ecclesiastics generally left such mundane record keeping in the charge of the town notary, and existing documents from various cahob suggest that Maya notaries adopted Spanish rubrics in various ways. Although some cahob maintained detailed testaments, others seemingly preferred a more simpli-fied declaration of piety.8 Regarding a separate book for the entries of deaths, none in Maya exist today to my knowledge from any cah, although that does not mean they did not exist. Instead, extant death entries typically appear in various cah- maintained manuscripts from cofradía records to Maya Christian copybooks.9 And although marriage and cofradía records are not uncommon, death records dominate the existing corpus.10 Perhaps this is because, unlike baptism, confirmation, or even marriage, recording the deaths of notables in the cah best aligned with precontact practices. That said, none of the nota-tions follow with precision the rubric that the 1722 synod provided, although most incorporate some elements. This deviation is not unusual as the formu-laic, prescribed preamble of the last wills and testaments penned by Maya or even Nahua notaries often displayed personal and local preferences.11Death records appear throughout a variety of copybooks and Chilam Balams. The copybooks relating the Passion, an Arte de bien morir, and vari-"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"194 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tous prayers (GGMM nos. 66, 70a, 71, and 72 respectively) all contain death records inserted throughout their pages. The Chilam Balam of Na also re cords the deaths of notables in Teabo, and the Teabo Manuscript contributes one single recording of a death in the cah. This sole entry appears vertically along the inside margin of page 19 and runs horizontally along the top margin to read, “como a las 3 1/2 de la mañana Sabado Sr Dlefino Mo almaneser el dia 5 Dicimbre Disciembre falliecio 5 de Disiembre de 1925” (At about 3:30 Saturday morning, Señor Dlefino Mo, at dawn the 5th of December, died, December 5, 1925). The ink is much more recent than that in the main text and betrays a Maya hand.Significantly, five copybooks exist which include death records from Teabo. This provides uncommon access to those names the maestros and notaries deemed sufficiently important to re cord. Table 5.1 illustrates the names and dates recorded in these books. These Teabo copybooks and their death records provide a rare opportunity to achieve some additional insights into colonial writing. First, nearly all the records date from the late nine-teenth century. Surely earlier versions of such copybooks contained similar death records that were not included in their most recent editions, further illustrating that these works were ever changing and were not simple fac-similes of earlier versions. Perhaps the personal preferences and entries of a maestro or notary did not transfer to his successor. Furthermore, select entries from various Teabo manuscripts continue to find relationship with the Na family and the compilers of the Chilam Balam of Na, José Secundino Na and his father, José María Na. For example, María Petrona Selestina, whose death in 1855 was recorded in the “Yucatec prayers” copybook, was the daughter of José María Na. Later, the 1860 death of his wife, Rogeria Dzul, appeared in a separate copybook, the Maya Arte de bien morir.Moreover, similarities in handwriting, prose, and orthography among entries in different works betray that the authors of the death records varied in their choice of copybook. For example, the orthography and handwriting of the entries made in 1875 correspond across those found in the Na and the “Passion Text,” thus suggesting a single author (see figure 5.1). More-over, similar matches occur with the 1873 birth and death records found in the Na and the “Yucatec prayers” manuscripts (see figure 5.2). This submits that these maestros and/or notaries either possessed or had access to multiple copybooks. Some of these they had written themselves; others had come into their possession. Either way, and similar to the precontact itz’aat and h- men, Maya specialists in each cahob trained in religion and writing composed, maintained, and passed along these manuscripts.12"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Table 5.1.

Why then re cord some names and not others? Although we can only speculate, it is likely that the recorded names of the deceased had a notable connection to either the notary, cah, or both. Of the various chibalob represented in the entries, those appearing most fre-quently—Na, Ek, Chan, Mo—surely represent elite families in Teabo.13 The Na chibal held enough prestige and education to author the Chilam Balam of Na, and the death of Dlefino Mo recorded in the Teabo Manuscript repre-sents a chibal that would later hold the office of presidente municipal (mayor) of Teabo multiple times in the twentieth century. In the end, the choice of whose death to re cord further demonstrates the autonomy and agency of the authors and notaries of such copybooks.FIGURE 5.1.

One such concern included the presence in Spanish parishes of “people who FIGURE 5.2.

The Church viewed with suspicion, and even contempt, any cure obtained through means deemed “questionable” and that did not originate strictly from God and his authorized servants. Previ-ously we saw how the Maya author of the Chilam Balam of Ixil neglected to name the author of its medicinal remedies, instead asserting as the source “El Cid Campeador.”16 Moreover, Maya and Nahuatl confessional manuals both typically included questions asking penitents if they engaged in such activities. An 1803 Maya confessional manual, for example, queries if the penitent ever cured someone using spells, and Molina’s 1569 Nahuatl manual inquires, “Cuix quemmanian aca ticitl oticnotz, ynic . . . mitztlacuicuiliz, yn anoço mihchichinaz . . . ?” (Did you ever call on a healer to . . . draw noxious objects from you, or suck [things from] you?).17The Maya employed medicinal remedies long before the colonial period. The Maya’s calendars, gods, and religion all played a role in their medicinal practices. Landa, and later Cogolludo, describe various gods of medicine and their rites, including those associated to Ix Chel, Itzam Na, Cit Bolon Tun, and Ahau Chamahes.18 Indeed, the divine and one’s health intimately corre-sponded, as demonstrated by the Maya performing rituals to specific deities to prevent certain illnesses.19 This is not all that dissimilar from the beliefs of sixteenth- century Spain that connected epidemics and disease with a disap-proving deity and his saints.20Local flora and fauna played an essential role in the medicines of the pre-contact Maya, and existing documentation testifies to the continued efficacy and role of such remedies in the lives of the colonial (and modern) Maya. In the sixteenth century, Spain’s Philip II issued a questionnaire to local officials in an effort to better govern his overseas colonies. Question twenty- six of fifty inquired after “the fragrant herbs or plants with which the Indians cure, and the medicinal or poisonous virtues of them.”21 Although responses varied, a common one stated that “most of the Indians did not cure their illnesses if not with herbs and roots and they bleed those parts that hurt them.”22 The Maya medicinal and ritual texts that have survived today, known as the Ritual of the Bacabs and the Sotuta and Mena manuscripts, and the Books of Chilam Balam of Chan Kan, Na, Kaua, Ixil, and the Códice Pérez all con-tain medicinal remedies.Spaniards also took an interest and recorded such remedies in various works. As Bricker and Miram noted in their study of the Kaua (2002), Spain learned from its Arabic past how to compose medicine books of remedies,"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"r e c o r d s o f d e a t h a n d h e a l i n g ✢ 199and those found in the Kaua, although different in content, share a similar format to those created in Spain. Such a tradition crossed the Atlantic to produce various Spanish works on local medicinal practices. For example, Sahagún included myriad plants and remedies in books 10 and 11 of his Gen-eral History of the Things of New Spain or Florentine Codex, and Nahuas at the College of Tlatelolco composed the sixteenth- century Badianus Manuscript, which lists various botanical plants and remedies. For Yucatan, various ex-amples exist, including the Libro del Judío, Manuscrito de padre Herrera, El libro de medicinas muy seguro, and Libro de medicinias.23 For their part, Maya texts and their inclusion of remedies among culturally and religiously sig-nificant compositions illustrate the continued connection between medicine and the divine. Moreover, and similar to doctrinal treatises, many of the men-tioned texts contain cognate passages of remedies from other Maya texts, thus further exposing the circulation and sharing of the content of the works themselves.Understanding the importance of medicinal remedies among the Maya and their connection with the divine helps explain their presence in the Teabo Manuscript. Like the death record of Dlefino Mo, these remedies were ap-pended years after the writing of the main texts and most likely originated in the twentieth century. Yet their inclusion in this Maya Christian copybook maintained by religiously trained maestros and/or notaries who helped over-see the Catholic well- being of the cah exposes a double role for these indi-viduals. They preserved and maintained not only the spiritual nature of the cah but also the physical nature—which of course was (and, for many, con-tinues to be) connected in many ways. An example of this is found in the Teabo Manuscript’s remedy for a snakebite and its employment of the leaves of the sip che (literally, “sin tree”), which remains common in curing rites today. According to David Bolles, sip che has uses other than as a medicinal remedy: “usually seven or nine sprigs of the plant are collected and used for such things as a brush to sweep away the evil winds or as decorative pieces around the altar but which function to keep away the evil winds.”24 Thus the plant contains both a physical and a spiritual benefit.Today, as in precontact and colonial times, h- men and curers in many cahob—similar to the aforementioned historian and shaman of Tusik, San Itza—continue to preserve and engage both the religious and medical knowl-edge of the cah. They can be seen as “the present- day descendant of the Post- Classic curers and the ah kin, and perhaps the maestro cantor of the colonial period.”25 In her work examining contemporary h- men, Marianna Appel Ku-now notes the importance of prayer in medicinal cures, recording the words of don Tomás: “Every person who cures with plants has their own Milagros"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"200 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p t(miracles); their own belief in which saints will help cure the sickness that per-son has, to discover which plant to give them.”26 Moreover, following their Spanish counterparts, many remedies in the Chan Kan conclude with the phrase paybe Dios, or “God willing.”27 In many ways, such remedies repre-sent a fluid negotiation between the old and new, preexisting religious rituals and beliefs and Catholicism.In general, the medicinal remedies in the Teabo Manuscript differ from those found in the Books of Chilam Balam in that they are brief twentieth- century annotations to the manuscript. In other words, they were an after-thought and not conceptualized as being a part of the original religious com-position. Some share the same pages as religious discourses; others were written in the margins or even appear upside down. The remedies cover the ailments of pasmos de las mujeres—a term used to describe various abnor-malities and irregularities of the menstrual cycle, usually as a result of eat-ing or coming into contact with cold items, especially during menstruation or after childbirth28—rashes, snakebite, body pain, and erysipelas. All such ailments are not uncommon and appear in various forms throughout other manuscripts. Yet unlike the Kaua, Chan Kan, Tekax, or Na that contain large sections of similar passages, the remedies fail to have cognate versions in any other text. Indeed, the majority of inserts read as a recording of personal prac-tice, not as a copy of an existing text. Oftentimes, the instructions that typi-cally accompany remedies found in the Kaua, Ixil, Na, or even Chan Kan, for example, fail to appear in the Teabo Manuscript. Instead, many entries are simple laundry lists of items needed in a cure with the occasional brief note of instruction.Despite such brevity, many of the plants used in the remedies here like-wise serve similar purposes in other texts, suggesting a common usage that extends beyond a particular cah.29 For example, in its list of ingredients to remedy snakebites, the Teabo Manuscript includes garlic and tobacco, two ingredients also found in similar remedies recorded in the Kaua and the So-tuta and Mena Manuscripts.30 Moreover, and similar to other texts includ-ing the Kaua, certain remedies in the Teabo Manuscript are homeopathic, prescribing ingredients that reflect the ailment. For instance, the remedy for a snakebite, or chibal can, includes the plants sac bacal can, “white corncob snake,” and u xiu can, “the snake’s plant.”31Like other remedies throughout Maya texts, those in the Teabo Manu-script illustrate a conversation between a Maya and Spanish colonial world. Certain remedies include Spanish- introduced items such as the lemon, and the text itself is an oftentimes frustrating mixture of a phonetically spelled hybrid of Maya and Spanish. That said, the entries are another testament to"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"r e c o r d s o f d e a t h a n d h e a l i n g ✢ 201the importance such remedies played and continue to play in the lives of the Yucatec Maya. Indeed, Maya medicinal books continue to circulate among the natives, including the father of h- men don Pedro, who “learned about plant medicine from a man who had a book on the subject, which contained a history of medicinal herbs” titled Xiu or “plant.”32Certainly the death record and medicinal remedies recorded in the Teabo Manuscript differ from the work’s other contents. Maya authors penned these entries years after the primary text. Yet their inclusion allows for a further understanding of these Maya- preserved copybooks. Both death records and medicinal remedies played a role in early modern Spanish society. Such prac-tices persisted in colonial Yucatan where the Maya continued to make these annotations in their own works, no doubt due to precontact parallels. Death records appear in Chilam Balams and other Maya manuscripts, indicating the religious training of their authors and notable deaths in the cah. It is doubt-ful that such a selective recording of deaths was ever intended for the eyes of ecclesiastics. More likely, the records reflect the personal notations of the author on the passing away of notable acquaintances, relatives, and notable figures in the cah. Furthermore, the similar entries found among various copybooks in Teabo suggest an author’s ownership and/or access to the cah’s important religious works.The inclusion of medicinal remedies among the religious texts of the Teabo Manuscript illustrates the enduring importance of curing in Maya society and its connection to religious specialists. The Teabo Manuscript sug-gests that the keepers of religious and historical knowledge likewise main-tained the physical well- being of the cah through a knowledge of the local healing practices.33 Although employing similar ingredients and styles, in-cluding homeopathic healing, the remedies found in the manuscript lack cognate versions in other known Maya texts, including the Chilam Balams of Tekax and Na—both authored in Teabo. Perhaps if the Teabo Manuscript had been dedicated to medicinal remedies, such a correlation would appear. As it is, the entries appear to be personal notes of the owner/caretaker of the manuscript at the time. Regardless, their presence provides yet another ex-ample of how Maya culture continually made and remade religion to fit local demands and traditions; in this case, a religious copybook wherein the re-cipient could find information on the creation of the world, the genealogy of Christ, or a cure to a snakebite. All such knowledge, important to the cah and its residents as it has been since precontact times, would be found and preserved in the hands of specially trained Maya, not those of the Catholic priest."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"202 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tVarious Medical Addenda, pp. 39, 41–43(P . 39)34Teabo 8 de Enero de 1911para curar pasmo de las mujeresmangeull (manguey)cascara de pixóyol kab (ho kab) su ojaschal cheoreganotres matas de cabaxan (cabal xan)una mata de caballaxnic (cabal yax nic)se sancocha con mielpara un abroto (aborto)[de] un filomenno (fenómeno)U raiz peregil (perejil)sancochadotambienxcanbahuah (x- canbal hau) con mielsu fruto de Valzamito (balsamito) con Anishabac naah con miel"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"r e c o r d s o f d e a t h a n d h e a l i n g ✢ 203(P . 39)Teabo, January 8th, 1911To cure chills or cramping of womenmagueybark of pricklenut tree (Guazuma ulmifolia Lam.)mayflower leaves (Tabebuia pentaphylla (L.)

The Teabo Manuscript allows us to glimpse how such negotiations were made regarding religious worldviews during the colonial period and a bit beyond.Works such as the Teabo Manuscript, other Maya Christian copybooks, and the Books of Chilam Balam are instrumental in our understanding of what the Maya chose to re cord concerning Christianity. Maya Christian copybooks, although technically forbidden compositions, illustrate those as-pects of colonial religion that the Maya author and subsequent contributors and copyists deemed important enough to preserve.

The themes, topics, and individuals that appear throughout the Teabo Manuscript and other religious compositions of the Maya are those that resonate strongly with both European and Maya world-views. The popularity of and fascination with the creation and termination of the world corresponded well with the period beginnings and endings of the Maya calendar and the gods of their pantheon that both blessed and smote, created and destroyed. The Teabo Manuscript features prominent figures of the Christian worldview, including Adam, Eve, Lucifer, Christ, and Mary, all of whom play significant roles in the daily lives of individuals through their role in the creation, damnation, and salvation of mankind. Interestingly, it is those elements of Christianity that best correspond to a Maya worldview which survived the centuries to appear in the copybooks or in the oral ac-counts of contemporary Mayas.2The Teabo Manuscript demonstrates that whether the teachings of Aqui-nas or indulgences, the Maya drank deeply from the font of European the-ology. Yet the Maya did not simply reproduce facsimile translations of the European worldview into their copybooks. Instead, orthodox Christian doc-trine and preexisting Maya beliefs provided material from which the Maya could create an even better story, one that spoke to both cultures and re-sponded to regional and local demands.3 The occasional modification or alter-ation of a traditional Christian doctrine or tale should not be viewed as sub-versive on the part of the Maya. Certainly Christians today do not consider themselves as such when they exercise their agency to selectively choose which tenets of their faith to uphold and which to ignore or perhaps bend slightly. The Maya similarly exercised their agency to create and maintain a Maya Christian worldview by choosing which elements of Christianity to re cord and how they would appear. In the process, they continued a tradition of ac-commodation and negotiation long extant within Christianity, from its in-ception as a Jewish sect to its inclusion of Gentiles without requiring them to uphold Jewish law to the impact of barbarian society on its medieval practice to its early modern reshaping in the face of Protestantism.4The similarities between such stories as the Genesis Commentary or The Fifteen Signs of the Teabo Manuscript among various colonial Maya works expose in new ways the presence of cognate religious texts. The frequent ap-pearance of these discourses, albeit in various forms, suggests their common knowledge and popularity among the colonial Maya authors. With certain religious texts found within these Maya Christian copybooks, there was a"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"c o n c l u s i o n ✢ 215template of sorts, perhaps oral, written, or both, common among authors, but each cah and author made it their own.As mentioned, whether these template discourses circulated physically through written form or orally is uncertain. I have offered the possibility that such stories owe their origins to the schools Maya noble youths attended and then left to return to their own respective cahob, carrying with them their training and, perhaps, texts. This parallels William Hanks’s concept of reducción and the dissemination of a Maya reducido throughout Yucatan. Like Maya reducido largely produced within the ecclesiastical sphere that eventually branched beyond reducción to become autochthonous and in-clude versions of Christianity unsettling to religious officials, religious texts created within the schools could disseminate and become modified with ele-ments important to the local cah. The similarities in the formulaic preambles of Maya testaments from various cahob provide an illustrative example. De-spite local and stylistic preferences of the cah and notary, the religious pre-ambles of Maya testaments from the cahob of Ixil, Cacalchen, Tekanto, and Ebtun all share fundamental formulae. For example, all generally begin with an invocation of the Trinity, declare the testator to be of sound mind, cite the name and cah of residence of the testator, and acknowledge the inevita-bility of death while requesting specific arrangements for burial and requiem masses.5 Such formulae arose from Spanish antecedents taught to the Maya notary, who then adapted them to best fit local and cultural needs. In a very real way, they mirror a similar process that occurred with Maya religious texts including, possibly, the Genesis Commentary, The Fifteen Signs, and others listed in Table 6.1. Despite the written antecedents of these texts from which their current versions emerged, the oral recitation and preservation of the Genesis Com-mentary and other cognate texts surely contributed to their preservation, dissemination, and alteration. The Maya, like the Nahua, had an uncommon ability to memorize long dictations because they were a culture of limited lit-eracy who depended on such.6 Thus such stories could likewise be the prod-uct of memorized oral history, or perhaps the result of someone reading a text while another copied it down only to be recopied later for reasons of pres-ervation. Indeed, the oral transmission of such religious texts would explain the common misspellings and orthographic variations. Moreover, the Latin found in the Teabo Manuscript is badly corrupted and, like the biblical names in Christ’s genealogy, spelled phonetically. This suggests the Maya author derived the passages from memory or an existing manuscript that likewise contained such errors as a result of spelling the words as they sound orally."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"216 ✢ t h e t e a b o m a n u s c r i p tRegardless, no priest would have made these mistakes, and the Maya were clearly not aware of what the Latin meant. This, then, reflects a larger trend of an increasing loss of knowledge in regard to the contents of these copybooks until it reaches the contemporary situation reflected in individu-als such as San Itza of Tusik, who can somewhat recall the content when read aloud, but lack the knowledge to read the text itself. Like the important Declaration of Independence whose contents and language most Americans are unaware of or fail to understand, the knowledge contained within Maya Christian copybooks eventually eroded with time, although the manuscripts themselves were preserved for their historical importance.Moreover, the Teabo Manuscript sheds some much- needed light on the authors of Maya Christian copybooks and even the Chilam Balams. From the good fortune of the manuscript contributing to what is now a sizable collec-tion of texts from Teabo, comparative analysis of such texts provides insights into their authors. Death records from Teabo appended to the back of the Arte de bien morir (GGMM no. 70a) containing the signature of Secundino Na illustrate his participation in various copybooks, including the Chilam Balam of Na. Orthographic analysis and comparisons of prose between the appended entries of various copybooks from Teabo likewise indicate that authors and notaries had access to multiple manuscripts, noting a death in one while later choosing another for a separate entry.Table 6.1.

The Teabo Manuscript and other similar texts were at the same time communal and personal compositions. The religious discourses recorded were certainly shared with the cah on specific occasions. Yet at the same time, the pages of the copybook included select records and medicinal recipes of significance to the author(s) and subsequent contributors.

Within the local religious hierarchy, maestros held the top position. Existing documentation lists three types of maestros: maestros cantores, maestros de capilla, and maestros de escuela. However, it appears that more often than not these were different titles for what functioned as a single position. The presence of other positions such as fiscales and sacristans varied from cah to cah. Most consistent was the post of maestro. See Anne C. Collins, “The Maestros Cantores in Yucatán,” in Anthropology and History in Yucatán, ed. Grant D. Jones (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1977), 233–247.

Farriss, Maya Society under Colonial Rule: The Collective Enterprise of Survival (Princeton, NJ: Prince-ton University Press, 1984), 335–343.10. Mendieta indicates that occasionally there was “carelessness” regarding the re-striction of the schools to noble youth and that at times non- noble natives were admitted, “especially in the small towns where there are few people.” Jerónimo de Mendieta, Historia eclesiástica indiana (Barcelona: Linkgua Ediciones, 2007), 432. However, the Códice franciscano (1889) encourages ecclesiastics to not make such a mistake as it would be inappropriate to make commoners the rulers of towns where the nobles had traditionally governed (62–63).11. Although some maestros were sent to their own towns, colonial documenta-tion suggests that others were sent to towns other than that of their origin.

Exceptions, of course, do exist where a scholar makes mention of a European antecedent. See, for example, Louise Burkhart, “The Voyage of Saint Amaro: A Spanish Legend in Nahuatl Literature,” Colonial Latin American Review 4, no. 1 (1995): 29–57; Bricker and Miram, Kaua; Amy George- Hirons, “Tell Me, Maiden: The Maya Adaptation of a European Riddle Sequence,” Journal of Latin American Lore 22, no. 2 (2004): 261–277; George- Hirons, “The Discourse of Translation in Culture Contact.” Yet, in general, studies are lacking that give such European works more than passing attention.44. For example, sections of the Teabo Manuscript show the influence of Spanish syntax: interjections that appear phrase initial instead of phrase final, or adjec-tives that follow rather than precede nouns in unmarked constructions, as in Spanish. My thanks to Timothy Knowlton and Victoria Bricker for their insights on the matter.45. Bricker and Miram perhaps said it best when stating that Maya- authored works allow us to better glimpse “which European texts were deemed worthy of in-clusion and why, and how they were reconciled philosophically with texts of obvious New World origin.” Kaua, 1. Furthermore, an understanding of a text’s European antecedents is extremely helpful in the process of translation, as such forerunners often provide clues to otherwise arcane passages.46. These sections are of my creation and not necessarily those of the Maya author(s) or copyists.47. I thank Victoria Bricker for her insight into this occurrence. Personal commu-nication, July 29, 2013.48. The name Na can also be written as Nah, and most works reference this Chilam Balam as the Nah. However, because its compilers signed their names as Na, I, like Gubler and Bolles, use such spelling.49. Although the Tekax has been placed in Teabo by some scholars (Munro S.

Edmonson and Bricker [Austin: University of Texas Press, 1985], 44–63), its origins are still a topic of some debate. The first section of the Na is certainly a copy of the Tekax, thus placing the Chilam Balam in Teabo at some point. Due to the proximity of Tekax to Teabo, someone in Teabo borrowing the manuscript from Tekax is not an impossible thought, nor is the idea that the Tekax originated in Teabo"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"270 ✢ n o t e s t o p a g e s 13–14only to end up in Tekax.

The children of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, made offerings to God in the forms of fruit and animals. Yet after the death of Christ, other nonsacrificial forms such as charitable acts, devotion, and prayer became more evident. For the ending of animal sacrifices in Christianity, see Acts 6:13–14, 1 Corinthians 5:7, 1 Corinthians 10: 18.19.

This revised 1592 edi-tion of a 1590 predecessor had its origins in Trent and the order of Pope Sixtus to issue a definitive edition of the Vulgate. Experiencing multiple publications throughout the colonial period, it was the only authorized version of the Bible until the twentieth century. That certain Maya received training in the Bible and its stories is made clear by not only the Teabo Manuscript, but others such as the Ixil, which contains Maya redactions of the Sacrifice of Isaac and the Exodus among others. Caso Barrera notes that these redactions followed biblical origi-nals rather closely, suggesting a careful referencing of the original, in this case the Vulgate translated into Spanish by Scio de San Miguel. See Caso Barrera, Ixil, 19–23.31. In a similar fashion, Antje Gunsenheimer notes that the European and Maya sources formed a pool of information of sorts from which the Maya drew to compose their manuscripts.

Throughout the manuscript, watermarks and wear render certain passages un-readable. Obvious omissions are indicated in brackets. Occasionally, bracketed insertions derive from cognate texts, and I indicate in the notes where such is the case.110. Here begins the cognate text with the Kaua, 146 of ms., and Chan Kan, 26 of ms. All references to the Kaua derive from Bricker and Miram 2002, and the Chan Kan from Hires 1981.111. Wear on the page makes these syllables unreadable. The bracketed portion is from the Kaua, 146 of ms.112. This entry appears in ballpoint pen and certainly dates to the twentieth century. The meaning, however, is unclear.113. Here begins the cognate text in the MM, 178 of ms.114. Read ca.115. The true intended meaning is the space directly below the celestial firmament.116. Various theologians commented on the creation of the angels. See, for example, St. Damascus’s discussion in Chase, St. John of Damascus, 205–210."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"n o t e s t o p a g e s 55–61 ✢ 281117. This is from caa’ sut, “to return,” with sut carrying a meaning of revolving or orbiting.118. This appears to be referencing, quite loosely, St. John of Damascus’s sermon on Holy Saturday. See Lupton, St. John of Damascus, 123.119. This seems to be a metaphor for the “light” God created on the first day. Aquinas explains, “First, because light gives a name to the air, since by it the air actually becomes luminous.” Aquinas, Summa, First Part, Question 67, Article 3. This seems to be in reference to clouds.120. This is coming from oci, but in the Kaua (285n1500) Bricker translates it as toci after the Chan Kan. However, seeing that it appears as oci in the Teabo, Kaua, and MM, I translate it as such.121. This, most likely, refers to the stars that composed the eighth layer of the Ptole-maic model.122. Again, this would be in reference to the eighth layer and its role of holding the stars.123. From Kaua, 148 of ms.124. As in the MM (181 of ms.), the author uses a bilingual couplet for “hours,” oras U kintzil.125. Here we have an interesting intrusion of Spanish orthography with the “ll” re-placing the “y” as a phonetic parallel. The word should read “yanob.”126. Should be “uactas.”127. Derived from tuba tu hunal, which Knowlton suggests is a couplet demonstrat-ing “colonial Maya theology rooted in the autochthonous metaphysics of com-plementary dualism.” Creation Myths, 109.128. This ordering of the planets and their assigned positions differs from that stated by St. John of Damascus. See Chase, St. John of Damascus, 216.129. Bricker reads this as a contraction of bala in the Kaua (289n1530). However, again the cognate text in the MM (182 of ms.) has bala, thus confirming the reading of bla as bala.130. Reading as pot chakanhal.131. Here the author divides what appears in the MM and Kaua to be a continued treatise. Yet in this division, the author should have made “sihsah” to be “sihsahi-lob.” The cognate text in the Chan Kan likewise breaks here (33 of ms.).132. In other words, no one calls the Crystalline “water,” although that is how it ap-pears in the scriptures.133. The Crystalline is in the ninth heaven, not the sixth as the Maya author indi-cates. Bricker reads this as uaxac, but I am hesitant to do so, primarily because, as noted earlier, the author wrote “eighth” as uaxac and had previously used uactas caan for “sixth layer of heaven.” Moreover, the MM has the text as uactas (184 of ms.)."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"282 ✢ n o t e s t o p a g e s 62–73134. From MM, 184 of ms.135. Here again we see the “ll” being used for the “y.”136. Aquinas promulgates this theory, and I believe it may be in reference to Isaiah 30: 26. Aquinas, Summa, Supplement, Question 91, Article 3.137. The cognate text with the Kaua breaks here.138. This “their” is puzzling and could be used to refer to the “other” wise men, or the European wise men.139. It seems as though the intended meaning is to illustrate how the creations were different from each other. See MM, 186 of ms. for another version of this line.140. This idea of light entering the form of the Sun appears in Aquinas’s Summa, First Part, Question 67, Article 4. See also Question 70. It helps explain why God created “light” on the first day, yet the sun wasn’t created until day four. Essen-tially, the sun is a vessel of light, not the creator of it. In this sense, the light cre-ated on the first day was spiritual, and the sun on the fourth day was its corporal manifestation.141. From Kaua, 155 of ms.142. Again, God did not want the Sun to give off light at first.143. Here ends the cognate text with the MM, 189 of ms.144. Here ends the cognate text with the Kaua, 57 of ms., and with the Chan Kan, 61 of ms.145. This use of pal carries with it a sexual connotation that certainly strays from the traditional story.146. Perhaps an approximation of delante.147. Reading as chayan.148. This insertion of the Trinity into the biblical record reflects the opinion of many scholars such as Aquinas in his Summa, First Part, Question 45, Articles 6 and 7, and their attempt to make sense of the “we” in Genesis.149. This is meant to illustrate how man was the greatest, most esteemed creation of God.150. Again, the author seems familiar with Aquinas’s Summa, First Part, Question 91, Article 3 in which he states, “Nevertheless, though of erect stature, man is far above plants. For man’s superior part, his head, is turned towards the superior part of the world, and his inferior part is turned towards the inferior world; and therefore he is perfectly disposed as to the general situation of his body. Plants have the superior part turned towards the lower world, since their roots corre-spond to the mouth; and their inferior part towards the upper world.”151. This is St. Thomas Aquinas, who is considered the Doctor of Angels due to how much of his Summa is dedicated to them. Here, then, the author plainly states he is deriving inspiration from Aquinas."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"n o t e s t o p a g e s 73–83 ✢ 283152. See Chase, St. John of Damascus, 264–266. Moreover, this aligns with the Summa saying Adam was created in grace. Aquinas, Summa, First Part, Ques-tion 95, Article 1.153. Here begins again the cognate text with the MM, 194 of ms.154. Read uinbail.155. Read kax. Here, as in other places, “u” is used interchangeably with “a.”156. From, for example, Aquinas, Summa, First Part, Question 93, Article 5.157. This is in reference to Revelation 22:1–2: “Then the angel showed me the river of life- giving water, sparkling like crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of its street. On either side of the river grew the tree of life that produces fruit twelve times a year, once each month; the leaves of the trees serve as medicine for the nations.”158. It is possible that this and other similar occurances of repeated words are a result of copying from a written text.159. This author/copyist seldom employs the “j” for the syllable final “h.”160. This is in reference to the New Jerusalem and Revelation 21: 12.161. This is in reference to Revelation 22:1.162. For more on this concept, see Phelan, The Millennial Kingdom, 72. This was also taught to the Nahuas. See, for example, León, Camino, 17r; also fray Juan de la Anunciación, Doctrina christiana muy cumplida (Mexico City: Pedro Balli, 1575), 25v.163. It was believed, particularly in the Eastern Orthodox Church, that the Garden of Eden was located in the East. Many medieval and early modern scholars be-lieved the specific location to be Hebron, and that Adam was formed from the earth of the Damascene field. See Rev. James H. Defouri, “The Location of the Early Paradise,” The Catholic World 36 (1883): 778–795. In his Summa, Aquinas likewise expressed the belief that the Garden of Eden was located in the East. Aquinas, Summa theologica, First Part, Question 102, Article 1.164. From may to oCooc haa yokol. Oc haa and its variants are frequently used for “baptism.” However, the Morley Manuscript reads may to othaac yokol, which Whalen translates as “before he had skin above” (197 of ms.). Later, the Teabo Manuscript mentions the creation of Adam’s skin using yothal.165. From Mark 7:34.166. From “yah sihsahule.” Sih is a verb for creation relating to females. See Knowl-ton, Creation Myths, 73, 108. Other Maya texts pair this female creation verb with its male counterpart, chab: Edmonson, Tizimin, 40; MM, 151 of ms.167. This addition seems to be in much darker ink and was possibly added at a much later date.168. See Genesis 2:20."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"284 ✢ n o t e s t o p a g e s 84–97169. Reading as hunɔit.170. It is unusual that in kaMycex the “y” is not an “i.”171. The beginning of this word is badly faded and represents my best guess. If I am correct, this is a scribal error in repeating the previous phrase.172. Read nahma.173. Here begins a different hand.174.

From toh olal, which when combined with cuxtal reads more poetically as “health.” My thanks to Timothy Knowlton for his insights.177. Read Miayatz.178. This phrase is likely a scribal error as the MM (207 of ms.) reads U lubesob. ti keban, “they fall into sin,” which I think would be the intended meaning here.179. Read ti yan.180. The word “will” comes from yol or wol, which is similar to “spirit” and originated from the deity Hunab Itzamna. See Christensen, Catholicisms, 45.181. In this last portion of dialogue, the author switches between the first and third person—a not entirely uncommon trait of Maya manuscripts.182. From u kohbilan, which means a representative of something or someone.183. Reading as Bayx.184. Here the text reads Ca a ualab tech, “Then you say to you.” I believe that Eve is the speaker here and that the “a” should have been the first- person “in.”185. “Warrior” is from holcan. The word means “head of the serpent,” and it referred to those warriors who served under the chief Maya military captain. It also ap-pears in the MM, 211 of ms.; see Christensen, Translated Christianities, 32–35.186. Here ends the cognate text in the MM, 212 of ms.187. From sip, which can relay a meaning of any error, while the more typical word for “sin,” or keban, commonly appears with religious meaning, although both often appear as synonymous. See Christensen, Catholicisms, 43; Hanks, Con-verting Words, 196–202, 265. Interestingly, throughout the Teabo Manuscript, its authors prefer the use of keban when referencing sin. Indeed, sip appears primarily in the Fall of Adam and Eve. This could be authorial preference, or it could reflect an intended meaning of an “error” or “mistake” committed by two beings lacking a full knowledge.188. Here is a prime example of how multiple renditions of a similar text can provide fruitful insights. In the MM the passage appears as ox muchix u thanalob, and Whalen, “Annotated Translation,” note 262, states her struggle in translating the phrase, eventually arriving at “multitudinous the recriminations by God to Adam back then.” However, because the Teabo Manuscript has the phrase as ox"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"n o t e s t o p a g e s 97–106 ✢ 285tenhi u thanal, we can see that the intended meaning was closer to that of the biblical text, as ten is a classifier for a count of times (hun ten, one time; ox ten, three times).189. As mentioned, the bark of this tree is frequently used by H- Men for its medicinal purposes. For examples of such in colonial texts, see Ralph L.

An example of the six- age view can be found in Jerónimo de Chaves, Chronographia o reportorio de los tiempos (Seville: 1576), 56v–64r.4. It is also possible, although somewhat less likely, that the illustration of Christ’s genealogy was to connect him with his role as Judge and the “Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David” who removes the seven seals in the last days (Reve-lation 5:5).5.

For the Damascene’s discussion, see Chase, St. John of Damascus, 361–366. Like John of Damascus, various Church Fathers employed the genealogy to prove Mary as having descended from David, thus allowing Christ to be called “son of David.”11. Here and throughout I employ a less contemporary spelling of the names as found in the King James Version of the Bible to facilitate a phonetic comparison between the Maya transcription and English translation of the names.12. Onan, a child of Judah, marries Tamar. After Onan’s death and the death of Judah’s wife, Tamar deceives Judah into fathering twins with her.13. Bricker and Miram, Kaua, 11.14. The right hand throughout the Bible was meant to exude a righteous state of approval and authority. The sixth article of faith of the Catholic Church states that Christ ascends to heaven to sit at the right hand of God (see also Mark 16: 19). This reference to the right hand proved problematic when instructing natives about the noncorporal nature of God. When discussing the matter, fray Domingo de la Anunciación’s 1565 Doctrina reminds the Nahua pupil that “God does not have a right hand like us, but that God glorifies Christ.” Fray Domingo de la Anunciación, Doctrina Xpiana breue y cōpendiosa (Mexico City: Pedro Ocharte, 1565), 26r.15.

The Chilam Balam of Tusik has a similar text, pp. 25–29; so does the MM, pp. 101–106; as does “Maya Sermons” no. 65 from Princeton. Although different, the Teabo text is most similar to that found in “Maya Sermons.”77. Both the “Maya Sermons” text and the Tusik have balcheob here.

I agree with Bricker and Miram that these names likely are in reference to popes Clement VI, Boniface VIII, Gregory the Great, and John XXII.54. Indulgences are of two types: plenary, or a complete forgiveness of the tempo-ral punishment required to expiate sin, including punishment in purgatory; and partial, which only remits a portion of the punishment.55.
