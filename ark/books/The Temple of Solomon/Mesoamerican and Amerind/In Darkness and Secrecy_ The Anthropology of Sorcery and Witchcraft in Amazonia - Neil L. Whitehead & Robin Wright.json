Its presentation in popular books, TV specials, and on the Internet is dominatedby the presumed psychic and physical benefits that shamanic techniques can bring. Thisheightened interest has required a persistent purification of the ritual practices of thosewho inspire the feverish quest for personal meaning and fulfillment. Ironically, asFausto points out in his essay in this volume, given the self-improvement motivationsthat have brought so many into a popular understanding of shamanism, two definingaspects of shamanism in Amazonia-blood (i.e., violence) and tobacco-have simply beenerased from such representations (see also Lagrou, this volume). Such erasure is notonly a vain self-deception but, more important, it is a recapitulation of colonial ways ofknowing through both the denial of radical cultural difference and the refusal to thinkthrough its consequences. This volume is intended to counteract that temptation.All of the authors whose works are presented herein are keenly aware of the way inwhich salacious and prurient imagery of native peoples has serviced the purposes ofconquest and colonization over the past five hundred years. In missionary writings, forexample, ideas about \"native sorcery\" and the collusion of shamans with \"satanic\"forces meant that such individuals were ferociously denounced and their ritualequipment and performances were banned from the settlement of the converts. In thiscontext no distinction was made between the forms and purposes of ritual practice:curers as well as killers were equally persecuted. Thus, the rehabilitation of shamanismas a valid spiritual attitude and a culturally important institution that has taken placeover the past twenty years through the enthusiastic, if ill informed, interest of the urbanmiddle classes might be seen in a more positive light-that is, as rescuing a form ofcultural variety that would otherwise be lost in the cultural homogeneity ofglobalization. Nonetheless, such a rehabilitation through a positive, almost cheery,presentation of the native shaman as psychic healer distorts the actual ritual practice ofAmazonians and other native peoples in a number of ways, as the materials collectedhere will show. Moreover, the notion that shamanism should be \"rehabilitated\" in thisway misses the important point that it is the supposed illegitimacy of shamanic practicethat should be questioned, rather than trying to justify cultural difference merelythrough the possible benefits it might have for ourselves. Taking seriously culturaldifference in this context means that we have also to ask what other reasons there werefor the colonial desire to repress this particular facet of native culture. As the essays inthis volume indicate, a large part of the answer to that question must be the verycentrality of shamanic ritual power to the constitution of native society and culture, as"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"well as the role that \"shamans\" thus played in resisting, ameliorating, and influencingthe course of indigenous and colonial contacts and subsequent histories. Theconsequence of this issue must also be to recognize that shamanic idioms are still verymuch present in the exercise of political power from the local to the national levels andthat this recognition makes an understanding of all aspects of such ritual action afundamental project for an anthropology of the modern world.What then is \"shamanism\"? Anthropological debate in Amazonia has consideredwhether or not the term describes a unitary phenomenon, and has persistentlyquestioned its institutional existence and its presence as a defined social role (Campbell1989; Hugh-Jones 1996; Fausto, Heckenberger, Pinto, this volume). Nonetheless, thereis a utility to the term that has underwritten its persistence in the literature and itscontinuing adoption in the present. This utility consists in the fact that the performanceof ritual specialists throughout Amazonia shows a number of resemblances that,although they do not represent a clear and distinct category of ritual action, nonethelessreveal ethnographically a variety of symbolic analogies and indications of historicalrelatedness. Moreover, native terms such as paj6 or piaii have passed easily from theiroriginal linguistic contexts into the mouths of many different speakers acrossAmazonia. Part of the reason for this may well be an apparent homogenization of ritualpractice in the face of evangelism by Christian missionaries or other agents of colonialdomination, but even if this were the only reason it would still be an importantethnographic fact about contemporary Amazonian cultures. Equally, anthropologistshave tended to overlook or ignore the issue of violence. No doubt this is partly due tocultural prejudice against the exercise of violence, because it is held that itsrepresentation among others will only serve to lessen the authority and validity of theirculture differences as something to be cherished and respected. Unfortunately, this hasmeant that we have not properly examined the \"dark\" side of shamanism, which is oftenintegral to the efficacy of shamanism overall (Mentore, Santos-Granero, this volume).The idea that shamanism thus expresses a recurrent moral ambiguity -for the sameabilities that cure can also kill-recognizes a fundamental aspect of shamanic powerthrough the presentation of shamanism as a personal or individual dilemma. However,shamanism's role in the reproduction of society and culture suggests that this view isincomplete and partial because it deals only with the appearance of shamanism in theroutines of daily life. Indeed, in the case of the Parakana (Fausto, this volume) the darkassociations of shamanism, its past connections to warfare, and the uncertainty as to thestatus of those who might claim to have shamanic powers, have all but occluded its"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"light or curing aspects. The deep mytho- historical presence of dark shamanism,contemporary with, if not actually preceding, the original emergence of persons andshamanic techniques, indicates that dark and light, killing and curing, arecomplementary opposites-not antagonistic possibilities. In the same way thatshamanism itself has been historically shaped by forces conceived of as external to theoriginating shamanic cosmologies, so too the ritual practices of curers are intimatelylinked to the assaults of shamanic killers and cannot be understood apart from them (seeHeckenberger, this volume). The loci of these cosmological contests become the bodies,both physical and political, that are created and destroyed through the ritual-politicalactions of chiefs, warriors, and shamans.Dark ShamansThe concept of \"dark shaman\" comprises the notions of sorcery and witchcraft, termsthat have their own particular and complex histories. A significant starting point for anyanthropological consideration of witchcraft and sorcery must be the definition thatEvans-Pritchard developed for these terms to describe the ritual and magical practicesof mangu and gbegbere ngua among the Azande/Zande in Africa. For Evans-Pritchard,\"the difference between a sorcerer and a witch is that the former uses the technique ofmagic and derives his power from medicines, while the latter acts without rites andspells and uses hereditary psycho-physical powers to attain his ends\" (1937:387). Thisdoes not, however, apply to Amazonian cultures, for in all cases presented in thisvolume, sorcerers and witches act with an overt intentionality unlike those thought of aswitches among the Azande (Evans-Pritchard 1937:42). The notion of a psycho-physicalinheritance of a \"witchcraft substance\" (misimo mangu) is likewise absent, exceptperhaps in the case of the Xinguano and Kulina (see Heckenberger and Pollock, thisvolume). This does not mean that magical techniques do not pass from one generationto the next along kinship lines, but rather that such inheritance is not inevitable and thatmagical assaults are never \"unconscious\" to the same degree that Evans-Pritchardsuggested for Zande witches.We introduce the term dark shaman in this volume to reflect both the distinct featuresof Amazonian assault sorcery and of malicious witchcraft, as well as to capture theambiguity inherent in shamanic practice, one that shades into the darkness of assaultsorcery but also implies a broader knowledge and power than that of the witch orsorcerer who has often been pictured as a figure marginal to the central spiritual orreligious notions of the society from which they come. Our usage of the term dark"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"shamans is inspired principally by Johannes Wilbert's pioneering study of the shamanicorder among the Warao (Wilbert 1972; 1993:92-125; and this volume). The work in thisbook, building on that detailed ethnography of Warao dark shamanism, argues for thecentrality and importance of dark shamanism to the overall spiritual and cosmologicalideas of Amazonian peoples in general. This reconceptualization of Amazonianshamanism also stems from the fact that both editors of the volume have recentlycompleted extensive studies of the shamanism and cosmological practices of twoAmazonian peoplesthe Baniwa (Wright 1998) and the Patamuna (Whitehead 2002) -inwhich the significance of dark shamanism is very apparent.Whitehead's (2002) study of the kanaima, a major complex of dark shamanism amongthe peoples of the Guyana highlands, underscores the importance of these other worksand links the practice of shamanism to wider sociopolitical goals, especially in the faceof colonialism, epidemic disease, and modern development (see also Vidal andWhitehead, this volume). It is also evident that there are important ethnologicalsimilarities, as well as differences, in the social position and cultural practice of darkshamans, as indicated by a comparison of the hoaratu among the Warao, manhene-iminali among the Baniwa, and kanaima among the Patamuna. The Warao themselveshave a number of shamanic complexes, which include the hoaratu, dark shamanscapable of inflicting pain and death; as with the kanaima, the hoaratu are engaged in acosmic quest, not merely assassination for political gain or personal and familialvengeance. This however, provides a point of contrast with the manhene-iminali, or\"poison-owners,\" that is the very antithesis of shamanism (see Wright, this volume): themanhene-iminali incarnate the primordial spirits of destruction and chaos present in theuniverse from the beginning of time.As with the most adept piya (shamans) of the Patamuna, among the Warao thedaunonarima, \"fathers of the wooden figurine,\" are also assault sorcer ers. In Patamunaaccounts of shamanic killing, reference is made to the \"spirit masters\" that are used toassail enemies, and these effigies seem highly reminiscent of the figurines used by thedaunonarima. Usually this kind of assault sorcery, known as iupithatem among theBaniwa, is used to settle village conflicts or to assist in collective warfare, as with thePatamuna piya (see also Wright and Buchillet, this volume). However, this kind ofshamanic assault does so in a generalized or relatively indiscriminate manner that, ithas been argued in the case of the Patamuna (Whitehead 2002), made it inappropriate tothe emergent era of gun warfare in the nineteenth century. This meant that thespecificity involved in kanaima assault sorcery made it a perfect adjunct to the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"emergence of smaller-scale political and military leadership. This historical change inintervillage and interethnic relations was therefore an important factor in the growingprevalence of kanaima practice over the last hundred years or so (see Butt-Colson 2001;Whitehead 2001).The historicity of shamanism and its abilities to adapt to the novel challenges ofcolonial and national intrusion are also evident among the Baniwa. The class of chantsand evil spells comprised by hiuiathi (sorcery) is employed by Baniwa shamans toassail their enemies in a wide variety of social contexts (see Wright, this volume).However, such chants and spells are not themselves an exclusive part of shamanictechniques because they may be employed by anyone who knows them. In this sensesuch aggressive magic is also present among the Patamuna in the form of talen, whichrequires no special initiation to learn and use but is very much part of a familyinheritance, being passed on largely within extended families. Although the knowledgeof such spells and chants might be general for the Warao, Patamuna, or Baniwa, there isan extreme secrecy among the Baniwa as to who may commit acts of assault sorcery. Incontrast, both the hoaratu and the kanaimd are often well-known individuals, and thekanaima in particular may choose to openly brag of their deeds, or supposed deeds.These brief comparisons allow a provisional discrimination among the various formsof dark shamanism, in particular between the existence and possession of certainmagical techniques (hiuiathi, talen) that may be widely known; the counteraggression ofshamans against the attacks by outsiders (iupithatem, daunonarima, piya); and theclasses of dark shamans who are initiates to a distinct system of ritual practice (hoaratu,kanaima, manhene-iminali ).Wilbert (1993:92-125) has previously discussed the hoaratu at great length. Thecosmological origins of the hoaratu lie in the relations between humanity and the hebo(ancient ones) that still reside at the cardinal points of the earth. It has been theparticular responsibility of the hoaratu to ensure that the scarlet macaw and his spiritsdo not become enraged and are appeased with a supply of human victims. So, as withkanaima killing, to be killed by the hoaratu is to be utterly extinguished without hope ofan immortality in the spirit world. The dismemberment of the Warao who dies at thehands of the hoaratu, like the anal and oral mutilations carried out by the kanaima, andthe utter dissolution of the person produced by iupithatem completely terminates anderases ontologically the individual, who becomes the food of the gods. Given that thisrole sustains cosmological relations, it is no wonder that, just as with the kanaima, thereis a reluctant acceptance of the necessity for such dark shamans among the Warao. The"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"kanaima as shamans of Makunaima, creator of all animals and plants, are likewiseresponsible for ensuring that the bounty of Makunaima is balanced by a sacrifice ofhuman nourishment that feeds kaikusi-yumu (lord jaguar) and nourishes koumima (thegarden spirit). However, the fact that Makunaima shares responsibility for the cosmicorder with his younger brother, Piai'ima, has meant that, as with the Warao, there areother forms of shamanic intercession. Unlike among Warao shamans, there seems to bean inherent tension and competitiveness involved in the relationships of the Patamunapiya and kanaima, mythically chartered by the tensions between Piai'ima andMakunaima.The hoaratu, like the kanaima, visit the graves of their victims to criticize theirstinginess and suck the corpse's blood through a cane. However, in an importantcontrast with kanaima the younger hoaratu are also curers, whereas kanaima areconcerned solely with death, and even the older hoaratu are principally concerned withkilling outside their own communities. These notions of sociality do not restrain thekanaima, which helps account for the idea of their pervasiveness; however, theirimportance to the constitution of society is still present, even if not overtly recognizedby all Patamuna. In the same way that the hoaratu mediate and balance the predatoryforces of the cosmos, so the kanaima ensure the continuing beneficence of the creator ofplants and animals, Makunaima. Moreover, since dark and light shamanism cannot beeasily separated, the mere potential for shamanic action is already somewhatthreatening to the fragility of everyday life, even when it is carefully controlled by itsmodes of ritual enactment, as with the Arara (see Pinto, this volume). Nevertheless, theclose connections that emerged between the kanaima and the changing patterns ofwarfare in the highlands over the last two hundred years are no less part of the currentmeaning of kanaima (see Vidal and Whitehead, this volume). This historicity relating toshamanic practice in turn raises broader issues regarding the role of shamanism in thesocial production of warfare and the cultural performance of violence. Wright's work(1998; and this volume) on the Baniwa thoroughly investigates the historical nature ofshamanism, witchcraft, and prophecy in the creation of notions of self and otherness, aswell as how those ritual practices relate to a broader cosmology in which shamanismitself comes to represent the triumph of human creativity over the destructive forces ofwitches; a struggle that is similarly represented in Patamuna thought by the contest ofthe primordial brothers Piai'ima and Makunaima. As with the Warao and Patamuna, theBaniwa also recognize the inevitable existence of dark shamans, manhene-iminali, orpoison-owners, who are cosmologically connected with the existence of death in theworld."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"In these ways it becomes apparent that whatever the tragedy, distress, and death thatdark shamans and allied ritual specialists may perform on humanity, they are aninevitable, continuing, and even a necessary part of the cosmos. For these reasons darkshamans are not simply vilified and hunted down in the manner of the European witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (although they may be: seeHeckenberger, Pinto, and Santos-Granero, this volume), but rather can become thesource and even symbols of a potent indigenous society and culture that is capable ofdefending itself against the depredations of the outside world, be that a neighboringvillage or even the national state (see Vidal and Whitehead and Santos-Granero, thisvolume). Indeed, in this light the religious wars against witchcraft, in both the New andOld Worlds, can also be seen as part of the establishment of the authority of the statethrough the priestly manifestations of the church (Griffiths 1996). The closeidentification of indigenous shamanism, of whatever kind, with \"satanic\" practices hasbeen an important political tactic of Western evangelism. It is certainly not our intent inthis volume to suggest that shamanism is necessarily of this kind, but the abusiveethnology of the evangelists should not inhibit a better understanding of phenomenathat loom so large in the cultural practice and imagination of Amazonian peoples.Dark Shamanism and Assault Sorcery in New Guinea andAfricaThe notion of assault sorcery as a way of capturing the variety of practice that isassociated with the darker aspects of shamanism is suggested by a parallel literature inNew Guinea (Stewart and Strathern 1999). In reviewing the existing literature onwitchcraft and sorcery in New Guinea and comparing it to the literature from Africa,Stewart and Strathern stress the way in which these phenomena can be seen as forms of\"supernatural warfare,\" implying that they engage community relations, not justindividual fates, to a significant degree. At this level not only warfare but epidemicdiseases and the changing settlement patterns induced by colonial contacts covary withthe pattern of assault sorcery and witchcraft (see Buchillet, Heckenberger, Pollock, andSantos-Granero, this volume). Sorcery and witchcraft are also united in the commonthemes of a bodily invasion, both individual and political, that is the mode of suchsupernatural assault and that concludes either in the destruction or consumption of bodyparts themselves. This link between the body-politic and individual bodies, in NewGuinea as much as in Amazonia, reveals the way in which techniques of darkshamanism may become entwined with the exercise of political power not only withinindigenous communities (Heckenberger, this volume) but also even at the regional or"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"state level (Vidal and Whitehead, Wright, and SantosGranero, this volume). By thesame token the execution of \"witches\" invokes the connection between bodily presenceand cosmological power, because the modes of killing child sorcerers (Santos-Granero,this volume) are unusual and cruel precisely to prevent physical resurrection by theirtutelary dark shamans or spirit forces.These approaches allow Stewart and Strathern largely to dispense with a forceddistinction between witchcraft and sorcery, as implied by EvansPritchard's originaldefinition. It is clear from the New Guinea material that even if there is the potential tomake such a distinction based on the varieties of mystical violence that are practiced, todo so inevitably leads to an oppositional typology that cannot then account forintermediate cases. In this volume we show that there are many opportunities to makesuch a distinction, but also that its general usefulness is limited to the specifics of agiven case. As Stewart and Strathern point out (see also Knauft 1985), such typologiesare very much snapshots of ritual practices at a given point in time and do notnecessarily reflect the changing relationships over time that ritual practices of all kindsundergo.It has also been suggested that even if the ritual meaning and content of witchcraftand sorcery show historical change, what does not change is the marginal status of suchreviled characters. The marginality or illegitimacy of the witch and sorcerer has becomethe basis of a juridical approach to the definition of these terms in the New Guineamaterials (Stephen 1987) that allows the adept and respected sorcerer-shaman who cancause death at a distance to be contrasted with the spiteful and hated witch who mightbe punished by community outrage, as with the child sorcerers and witches described byHeckenberger and Santos-Granero in this volume. However, generalizing thisdistinction still begs many questions regarding the possibility for intermediate practices(Lagrou, this volume), even if it may have relevance in Amazonia (Heckenberger andPollock, this volume). Like Stewart and Strathern and Evans-Pritchard we note thepossibility for discrimination among the forms of mystical violence and assault sorcery,but we also see no compelling reason why the sorcery/witchcraft distinction should beconsidered a universal one.From their inception, Africanist studies of witchcraft and sorcery have referred to thewider dislocations of colonialism-evangelism, wage labor, migration-as relevant tounderstanding the incidence and meaning of accusations of mystical violence (Douglas1970; Middleton 1987; White 2000), and much the same has been noted in other regions(Watson and Ellen 1993; Hoskins 1996). This is important to an understanding of the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"historicity of dark shamanism generally, because the harsh realities that colonial orneocolonial contacts bring are a vector for both the increase in anxieties about sorceryand the emergence of certain specific forms of occult violence. But it has also becomevery evident that the occult has emerged as a political idiom of postcolonial nationalcultures as well, as a mimesis of continuing exploitation and oppression by globalcapitalism (Ellis 1999; Geschiere 1997; Comaroff and Comaroff 1998), or as an idiomfor the suppression of internal revolution (Santos-Granero, this volume). The career ofMandu, the powerful shaman discussed by Vidal and Whitehead in this volume,perfectly exemplifies the conflation of \"tradition\" and \"modernity\" that has otherwiseperplexed external observers but that in the last decade or so has led to even widerengagements between shamanism and external politics (Conklin 2002). As Stewart andStrathern state: \"It is not simply a matter of arguing for an increased frequency of typesof action; rather, it is a matter of studying the changing loci of accusations over time\"(1999: 649). In this way, colonial actors and neocolonial oppressors themselves becomethe agents and instantiations of dark cannibalistic spirits, even as the boundariesbetween the all-engorging state and remnant autonomous communities, such as in theNew Guinea Highlands or in Amazonia, become uncertain and unclear and seem tothreaten a total dissolution of the body-politic, represented as a cannibal consumptionof the individual and collective spirit.Witchcraft and Sorcery in AmazoniaIn contrast to Africa, New Guinea, and Europe, native South America has not been thesubject of an extensive analysis of witchcraft and sorcery, except perhaps in the Andeanregion where the interest of the Catholic Church in the suppression of native religiouspractice produced \"witch-hunts\" in the manner of Europe, which often were inflectedwith a similar gender bias (Aigle, de La Perriere, and Chaumeil 2000; Griffiths andCervantes 1999; Silverblatt 1987). A few early studies of attack shamanism stand out,however; for example, the work of Michael Harner (1962, 1972, 1973) and of NormanWhitten (1976,1985) among native peoples of eastern Ecuador (the upper Amazon); aswell as Levi-Strauss (1967), Dole (1973), Goldman (1963), and even NapoleonChagnon's controversial filming of Yanomamo assault sorcery in the 1973 film MagicalDeath. Still, even with the appearance of more recent literature on various aspects ofshamanism in general (Brown 1985; Gow 1996; Hugh-Jones 1996; Langdon 1992, 1996;Sullivan 1988; Taussig 1987) anthropological analysis of Amazonian dark shamans isfar less extensive than for other ethnographic areas. Witchcraft and sorcery inAmazonia has been treated mostly in a haphazard way, with some excellent"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ethnographic accounts but no real regional comparisons or broader suggestions as tohistorical origins and processes. As a consequence, none of the larger questions aboutethnological differences or the workings of local variation have been broached. It is ourintention here to offer some initial discriminations in the forms of Amazonianshamanism in order to illustrate some of the important features of shamanic practicethat are less evident in particular ethnographic accounts.In general the literature on Amazonia has subsumed the topic of witchcraft andsorcery under the topic of shamanism-reflecting the ethnographic reality that shamansare quite often sorcerers: two sides of the same coin. This often-noted dual capacity ofthe shaman to heal and to cause harm, frequently referred to as the \"moral ambiguity\"of the shamans, is also reflected iconographically in the archaeological record where thedoubleheaded bird is associated with shamanic ritual practice (Whitehead 1996). Insome societies, shamans also stand in contrast to priestlike specialists whose functionsare rarely considered ambiguous and are connected to \"legitimate\" social reproductionin the cosmological sphere (Thomas and Humphrey 1996). The tendency of theliterature on shamanism, as noted above, has been to concentrate on the morally \"good\"side; that is, the healing function of the shaman as a vital service to the community.As Michael Brown (1989) pointed out, there has been a marked tendency in the pasttwo or three decades to emphasize the positive, therapeutic, and socially integrativedimensions of shamanism-a trend that shows no sign of diminishing (Harner 1998).This appropriation of native shamanism has been particularly evident among well-educated North Americans, Europeans, and urban Latin Americans, who approachshamanism as a set of magical techniques that can be used for self-realization, forattaining profound or mystical experience, and for alternative therapy, bothphysiological and psychological. The ethnographic experience of Amazonian darkshamanism pointedly contradicts this imagery and, while issues of the politics ofrepresentation cannot be ignored, it is obviously the role of anthropology to provide amore adequate interpretation and presentation of actual Amazonian practices. Althoughrecognized, the \"dark\" side-the shamans' power to destroy or inflict harm throughsorcery and witchcraft-has received little in-depth attention. In several of the mostimportant contributions to the South American shamanism literature in recent years(Langdon 1992, 1996; Sullivan 1988), the weight of the attention is on the shaman'scapacities to harness cosmic forces for the benefit of humanity. This is not to say thatwitchcraft and sorcery have been totally ignored, but rather that some of the morenotable extended studies (Albert 1985; Chaumeil 1983) have not been widely read in"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"North America.Theoretical ApproachesVarious schools of thought are currently evident in the anthropology of Amazonia(Rival and Whitehead 2001; Viveiros de Castro 1996). These schools can becharacterized as (1) the \"political economy of control,\" as originated in the works ofTerence Turner for central Brazilian societies and of Peter Riviere for the Guyaneseregion, which emphasize the control by certain categories of persons over others ascentral to the dynamics of native sociopolitical process; (2) the \"moral economy ofintimacy,\" first represented in the works of Ellen Basso among the Kalapalo (1970,1975) and Joanna Overing among the Piaroa (Overing-Kaplan 1972, 1973; Overing andPasses 2000), which focuses on the social philosophy and practice of everyday societyin Amazonia; (3) the \"symbolic economy of alterity\" of the structuralist-inspiredethnologists, which concentrates on processes of symbolic exchange (such as war andcannibalism, hunting, shamanism, and funerary rites) that cross cultural boundaries andthus play into the definition of collective identities; and (4) \"historical processes andthe cultural production of history\" (Hill 1996; Gow 2001; Whitehead 1997, 2002;Wright 1998), which is concerned with a broad range of issues such as landscape, theproduction of ethnicity, warfare, and the epistemology of historical text. An importantemergent theme across these topics has been the mutual production of cultural andsocial categories between \"native\" and \"colonial\" (or national) societies that have cometo dominate indigenous communities throughout the region. In this context shamanismhas emerged as an important vehicle for the mediation of change.These analytical styles and theoretical tendencies are not necessarily exclusive. Thepresent volume includes all of these approaches, and thus we have chosen to organizethe chapters to reflect these various theoretical emphases as well as cultural traditions.In the latter case it would be premature to make a strict contrast between, say, theTupian, Arawakan, and Cariban groups discussed in the volume, but certain tendenciesdo begin to emerge that maywell be a useful basis for future research into shamanismgenerally. Among the Tupian groups shamanic power is persistently threatening, evenin its \"curing\" aspect. Indeed the historical sources refer to the cannibalistic nature ofthe shaman's rattles (maraka) that constantly demanded human flesh, while the imageryof the pet/captive suffuses the notion of shamanic assault. Among the Arawakan groupsthere seems to be an incipient notion of a \"witchcraft substance,\" not directlyinheritable, as in the African case, but nonetheless seen as a distinct penetration of the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"body, which is simultaneously seen as a disruption and attack on the conviviality /siblingship / hierarchy. In this guise dark shamanism is an attack on specific sets ofsocial relationships rather than sociality itself, suggesting particularly strong linksbetween the exercise of power and shamanism in these societies. In the case of theWarao and the neighboring Cariban peoples, there are hints that there is a far morelegitimate role for the dark shaman-for even if the sorcerer is a highly antisocial figurehe is so with regard to an evanescent set of social relationships, and his actions mayparadoxically ensure the possibility for sociality at all through his propitiatoryrelationship with the predatory cosmos that might otherwise consume humanity anddestroy the beneficence of the earth. In this sense the dark shaman enables, but does notaid, the construction of sociality.The essays by Pollock, Lagrou, and Pinto in this volume focus on the implications ofsorcery for the ethics of conviviality in each of the societies studied. Another essay, byMentore, partly expresses this analytical focus by analyzing close, even familial,relations among the Cariban Waiwai, but also looks to the political economy of powerand the role of shamanic voice and ceremonial chant in creating the space of death inlife-a theme also present among the Parakana (see Fausto's essay). Mentore thuscreatively combines a number of the broad approaches described above. Santos-Granero's contribution, sharing this theoretical orientation, grapples with the difficultquestion of the apparent contradiction between an ethic emphasizing \"the power oflove\"-the title of his monograph on the Amuesha of the Peruvian Amazon-and thekilling of children accused as sorcerers. It is precisely this ambivalent or even positiveevaluation of the role of dark shamanism, along with the existence of culturallydifferent ways of evaluating the meaning of pain, sickness, and death, that form acentral challenge in the anthropological interpretation of assault sorcery and itsconsequences.Yet it is apparent, as illustrated by Vidal and Whitehead, that dark shamanismproduces its own kind of legitimacy, especially where it acts as a mediating force inrelations with a threatening alterity-be that either enemy sorcerers from among othernative peoples or the very presence of the colonial or national state. In Vidal andWhitehead's essay, as well as Wright's, there is a strong emphasis on historicalanalyses-that is, investigating the relations between the expressions of sorcery that arethe consequence of situations of contact and articulation with nonindigenous societies,as well as internal social, political, and ritual processes. Through its regional andcomparative approach, Vidal and Whitehead's contribution especially demonstrates the"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"interaction between shamans, sorcerers, and religious cults with regard to regional andnational (even international) politics.The structuralist-inspired \"symbolic economy of alterity\" approach is clearlypresented in Fausto's analysis of Parakana warfare, hunting, and shamanic symbolism,focusing on the predominance of predation as central to social and political dynamics.But Fausto goes beyond this ethnographic analysis to provide a reflection on its radicaldifferences relative to the neoshamanistic movement of Western society.One of the initial objectives of this volume was to understand the connectionsbetween the symbolic relations of aggression in mythology, cosmology, and shamanismand the social and political dynamics of witchcraft and sorcery. Another objective wasto understand, through case histories, the sociological and political contexts of conflictsand aggression based in witchcraft and sorcery accusations-that is, to identify the typesof sorcery and/or witchcraft that occur within communities, between communities, andbetween distant \"enemy\" groups. Further, we wished to direct attention to the acts ofperforming witchcraft and sorcery as parts of a sequence of events immediately prior to(e.g., omens or other premonitions, dream symbolism) and following (inquests onvengeance killings) the infliction of harm. Finally, we wished to present native exegeseson the various forms of sorcery and witchcraft: more specifically, how these aredistinguished in terms of their efficacy and techniques of application; what metaphorsor physiological imagery are used to represent the different forms of magical action;and the rules or norms governing the exercise of these acts, or their representation as aform of uncontrolled or illegitimate aggression.The essays herein thus give primary attention to these questions by presenting in-depth discussions of methods and techniques of sorcery (Buchillet, Lagrou, Wright); insome cases by an examination of previously little-known societies, such as the Parakana(Fausto) or the Arara (Pinto); in others, by offering fresh approaches to well-knownsocieties (Pollock on the Kulina; Vidal and Whitehead on Arawakan and Caribangroups). All of the essays seek to relate sorcery and witchcraft to social and politicalprocesses, particularly relating to questions of power (Heckenberger, Mentore, Santos-Granero, Vidal and Whitehead), where the contradictions of egalitarian societies inwhich inequalities, whether or not produced by external contacts, become the crux forwitchcraft and sorcery accusations (Wright, Buchillet). By the same token, many of thecontributions demonstrate how sorcery accusations may represent forms of discourseabout tensions in intervillage and interethnic relations, and may be structured by theidiom of kinship (consanguinity and affinity) and village hierarchy (Heckenberger). It is"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"more likely that other communities, other societies, are to be held re sponsible forsorcery, and it is equally unthinkable that kin would ever resort to sorcery or witchcraftas a form of action. Such discourse shapes social action, as is demonstrated in several ofthe case histories in this volume. It is also apparent that dark shamanism becomes anidiom for wider interethnic relations and engages with other occult traditions, such asobeah (Vidal and Whitehead).Ethics in Anthropological Research on Witchcraft andSorceryA number of contributors to this volume expressed anxiety over the possibleconsequences of even contemplating its subject matter, as SantosGranero neatly states:\"The challenge for me, as well as for all the contributors to this book, is to find ways oftalking about cultural practices that are odious to Western sensitivity without eithermaking enemies out of those who practice them or providing their enemies witharguments to deny them their rights.\"However, close and long-term ethnographic engagement with societies whereshamanism is practiced shows that shamanic power is deeply, if ambiguously, involvedin all community affairs. As a result, and as this volume argues, shamanism inevitablyis concerned with dark shamanism, aggression, warfare, and the struggle for politicaland economic power. In fact, many scholars have written about the healing systems ofindigenous peoples showing how no one becomes ill and dies without human agency.That agency is evil, and it comes from spirit attacks directed by a shaman or attacksorcerer. Although anthropologists have understood this and the significance of darkshamanism more generally, the scholarly literature, particularly where it is likely toreach a wider audience, has recently tended to downplay these aspects of shamanicpractice. This is evident, for example, in the presentation by Luis Luna of the depictionsof the \"ayahuasca visions\" of Pablo Amaringo, a Quechua shaman (Luna and Amaringo1991). Amaringo's paintings clearly show attack sorcery, and the artist himselfexplained to the anthropologist how \"evil shamans tried to kill the person who iscounteracting their evil doings by throwing magical darts, stealing the soul of theirvictims, or sending animals to bring harm\" (1991:13). Nevertheless the presence ofattack sorcery in the text is depicted as marginal and the result only of personalmaliciousness, although the paintings themselves belie this because the figure of thedark shaman is very evident throughout the collection."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"In light of recent events' the urge to downplay dark shamanism is intelligible even ifself-defeating. Not because there is no issue to be addressed here but rather because theissue itself has been with us since the ini tial reports on the New World were sent backby Columbus and his contemporaries. Within European cultural tradition, Rousseau's\"noble savage\" emerged in opposition to the notion of presocial Hobbesian brutes, andthese stereotypes have proved to be remarkably persistent in the popular andprofessional literature alike. But, as Fausto comments in his essay herein:\"Understandably enough, the predatory act is the lost fact in modern, urban, middle-class shamanism, which purged the phenomenon from all its ambiguous attributes. It isthus no wonder why the jaguar, although a recurrent figure, is depicted as an endangeredspecies and not as a dangerous predator. Neoshamanism subjects others' thoughts toWestern thinking and moral standards: there must be good and bad, both a light and adark side, and a clear-cut frontier in order to demarcate a basic contrast of ethic. Thereis no such dichotomy in South American shamanism, which thrives on ambivalence.\"This volume does not represent dark shamanism as something else, as an aberration oran error, nor does it glorify the violence and suffering that the activities of darkshamans can cause. Rather, this volume offers only ambivalence, shifting perspectives,shadowy possibilities, and the necessity for the active, participatory relationship withthe cosmos that is at the heart of shamanic ritual practice. In this way we intend to moreproperly represent the spiritual realities of Amazonian peoples which, if they arestrongly marked by the violence and predation of a hostile world, should cause us toreflect on the sources of that aggression, which are as much the legacy of our owncultural presence in Amazonia as they may be the product of an ancient vision ofcosmological order.If the Asharinka identify \"child sorcerers,\" against whom violent acts are then carriedout to preserve community harmony, then it is well to remember, lest we judge theAmuesha to be Hobbesian brutes, that we similarly demonize our children as \"gang-bangers\" and \"school shooters.\" Our response to this issue maybe medical rather thanspiritual, for the drug Ritalin is widely prescribed for children throughout the Westernworld, but is it more or less appropriate or credible than the responses of the Amuesha?We do not attempt to answer that question in this volume, but it is our intention that itserve to illustrate why we should be asking it. The notion of satanic abuse that led towitch-hunts in the United States and Europe against parents thought to be suborningtheir children into the practice of satanism might therefore be compared to the childsorcery of the Amuesha in a new and informative light-we may not assail our children"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"with antisorcery measures, but the disruptive and different are no less condemnedamong ourselves. The futility of sanitizing the violence of others lies not in the short-term nature of the intellectual comfort this may bring, but rather in the fact that itsimultaneously encourages a blindness to the deep history and unacknowledged socialvalue of our own violence toward others and ourselves.The ethnographies presented throughout this collection seek to document and analyzesuch cases in order to understand the motivations, processes, symbolism, mechanisms,and dynamics involved. To intervene (i.e., to take action) in any of these cases isanother question altogether, and here we emphasize that by the simple fact that in onecase the victims are children doesn't make the case any more critical in terms of\"human rights abuses\" than any of the others. In nearly all cases, it is documented thatthe societies in question have their own mechanisms and norms for dealing with suchcases, and in no way does the anthropologist have a responsibility to intervene. If anycase demonstrates clearly the impact of nonindigenous societies as being responsiblefor a triggering of sorcery accusations or witch killings, however, then we agree it is theanthropologist's obligation to act on his or her own society. Thus we limit ourcomments here to the point that the study of assault sorcery in native societiesfrequently reveals the nature of violence at work in state societies. Any largerdiscussion of ethics would demand another volume and would include other practicesthat historically have \"horrified\" the West, such as cannibalism, headhunting, warfare,and torture-which likewise plague our own societies.Notes1 \"Recent events\" refers here to the continuing controversy over the publication ofPatrick Tierney's Darkness in El Dorado (2000), which accuses anthropologists ofhaving been complicit in medical experimentation on Amazonian peoples and ofhaving seduced them into lewd and destructive behaviors. Ironically Tierney's onlyother published work (The Highest Altar, 1989) concerns \"child sacrifice\" in theAndes, and his current journalistic foray (2000) is avowedly something of a penancefor past wrongs.ReferencesAigle, Denise, Benedicte de La Perriere, and Jean-Pierre Chaumeil. 2000.

At the cardinal, intercardinal, andsolstitial points of sunrise and sunset this range incorporates twelve towering columnarpeaks that brace a bellshaped cosmic vault. Below the dome's zenith, and in the middleof the ocean, there floats a disklike earth comprised of the Orinoco delta, the Warao'straditional swampy homeland. Bundles of twirling energy rising from the center of theocean floor transpierce the earth-disk and a small discoidal tier close to the summit ofthe sky, conjoining nadir and zenith as a world axis (figs. 1 and 2).Populating the peripheral and axial regions of this cosmic landscape are divine powersthat interact with humankind in various ways. They either visit earth from time to timeor make their earthly presence known by proxy. Although humans originated in the skyworld as disembodied beings, after their descent to earth the Lord of Death destinedthem to be of corporeal existence, unsuited for celestial life. The cosmic landscape andits powerful constituents, therefore, are inaccessible to common human beings and onlyreachable by shamans and shamanic artisans capable of ecstatic trance.The Warao recognize several different orders of shamanism, usually distinguishingbetween junior, senior, and veteran members. In some instances practices among same -order ranks vary such that outsiders erroneously perceive them as categorically distinctfrom one another. Still, there exist as many as four different orders of shamanism inWarao society, including priest-shamanism, light shamanism, weather shamanism, anddark sha manism. Whereas in this essay I address primarily dark shamanism, I offer abrief description of the other types to help clarify the difference between Waraoshamanism and sorcery as well as to situate both practices within respectivecosmological domains. Although shamanism and shamanic crafts are primarily reservedfor males, women may also practice these arts, except that of boatbuilding. However, Ihave known but few practicing female shamans and am aware of none who wereecstatics who were initiated, like male shamans, by resorting to tobacco (nicotine) as amedium of trance."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Figure 1. Warao cosmology and shamanic domains, showing directional gods andpriest-shamanism, the rain lords of weather shamanism, light shamanism, and darkshamanism. (Drawing by Werner Wilbert)Priest-ShamanismThe order of priest-shamanism derives its power from \"our ancients\" (kanobotuma),residing on world mountains at the extreme cardinal points (other than the western) andat the solstitial corners of the universe. Lesser deities by that name live on hills atearth's edge, opposite the southern and the northern mountains, as well as at the zenithand the nadir. The two southern and two northern gods are mirror images of each other,even though the distant members of the pairs rank higher than the near ones. Highest-ranking of all ancients is the god of the far south (see fig. 1)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The name kanobotuma translates also as \"our grandfathers,\" designating the primalforebears of the Warao. Jointly with their retinues of deceased priest-shamans, theyconstitute a hidden but important segment of the population. By frequenting pathwaysthat connect their cosmic stations, the ancients traffic with each other and withhumankind, remaining well disposed toward their mortal kin as long as they provisionthem with food (tobacco smoke) and with rejuvenating water (sago). Thus, there exists acovenant of compelling mutuality between humans, on the one hand, and ancestral godsand late priest-shamans on the other: protection of terrestrials by celestials depends onpropitiation of celestials by the earthbound.The priest-shaman, a trance-initiated ecstatic who mediates between the parties, isresponsible for humankind's compliance with this pact. Instatement to his office followsweeks of rigorous asceticism, nicotine habituation, and instruction in the knowledge ofpriest-shamanism, leading to the candidate's empowerment as a \"master over pain\"(wisiratu; wisimo is the plural form). The mentor hands the candidate a three-foot-longcigar prepared with six wads of tobacco that, on ingestion, enter the pupil's body as hissons, or tutelary \"pains,\" and accommodate themselves, in pairs, on both sides of histhroat, chest, and abdomen.

In their anger these spirits transformed themselves into physical disorders anddiseases, pledging to afflict their terrestrial kin in perpetuity. Pains are sent bydisgruntled ancients, by priest-shamans who request the gods to send them, or by theancients' proxies in the shaman's body. Priest-shamans take offensive action by blowingpains from their bodies into victims who, by their behavior, threaten the integrity of thecovenant with the ancients. Individuals whose misconduct poses a threat to themselvesand to the community at large prompt illness caused through intervention of a priest-shaman. Generally speaking, however, priest-shamans do not practice sorcery with evilintent. Of course, the chastisement they mete out will hardly be perceived asparticularly benevolent by the patient. But, once aware of their offenses, hebu patientsbecome contrite and, if old enough, confess transgressions as part of the therapeuticprocess. Most patients seen by a priest-shaman healer are children and adolescents who,particularly during the annual rainy seasons, feel the wrath of the ancients castigatingthe community for delays in feeding them or for propitiating them insufficiently withsago. A priest-shaman healer expects to be compensated for his efforts by a child'sfather or by a recovered adult male as long as the patient is not a member of his nuclearfamily. A man unable to provide compensation mortgages his body by sitting back toback with the shaman, pledging to be his lifelong neburatu (servant).Whereas, quite evidently, Warao priest-shamanism bears the trademarks of near-universal shamanism, its veteran practitioners also act as priestly leaders in religious"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"rituals on behalf and with support of their congregations. Hierarchically organized likethe ancients, priest-shamans of subtribal populations are ranked according to theirstatuses. Highest ranking among them is the kanoboarima, \"father of our ancient one.\"In early times, distressed by the amount of illness that prevailed among his people, thefounder of priest-shamanism visited the supreme spirit of the south in order to negotiatethe noted contract of reciprocal assistance. In exchange for a one-time sacrifice of tenpersons, he was granted one of the god's own sons in the form of a rock crystal, and heaccommodated the idol in a basket within the village shrine. From the time of thisinaugural event, priest shamans are cofathers to the kanobo's son and kinsmen of hisfather, engaging the paternal spirit as the divine patron of their subtribal communities.'Much of an ordinary priest-shaman's life is spent consulting ancestral spirits about thecauses of his patients' illnesses and propitiating the kanobos with tobacco. He makes hisinquiries and pleas by plaintive chant, accompanied by a sacred rattle that contains afamily of tutelary spirits in the form of quartz pebbles. When applied to a patient'sbody, these helpers leave the rattle and effect a cure inside the ailing person. However,in addition to his healing functions, the veteran priest-shaman, ranking as the father ofthe ancient one, as noted, has also important priestly obligations. Intermittentlythroughout the year, he invites the ancients from around the world (except the westernone) to join his people's patron spirit in the shrine. In the course of ceremonial dancingunder his auspices, the gods receive an offering of moriche (Mauritia flexuosa) starch,or sago-their rejuvenating water and the Warao's staple food. Symbolically, the Waraorecognize ritual sago flour as semen, the fundamental font of human life (Briggs1992:344). Old Spider Woman placed it in the form of silk into the stem of theprimordial palm, after the god of the noon sun had fashioned her from the bleachedbones of ancestral Warao. Ever since, seminal moriche starch serves as sacramentalfood for human participants in the ritual and as the fountain of youth for participatingdeities, who immerse themselves therein.Light ShamanismThe order of light shamanism is generically known as bahana and its practitioners asbahanarao (bahanarotu is the singular form), meaning those who \"smoke\" or \"suck.\"Extending from the solstitial sunrise corners to the zenith and the center of the earth, itscosmic center is a two-story ovoid structure, located on the upper-world plain, northeastof the world axis (see figs. 1 and 2). Light shamanism is identified with the plenipotentsun of high noon and the avian God of Origin, residing on the world mountain at"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"equinoctial sunrise. This supreme lord is the father of the swallowtailed kite (Elanoidesforficatus), the Tobacco Spirit, who, in primordial times, emerged from a cave in themountain. From there he tracked the sun to the brightest region in the sky, where hebuilt the egg-shaped house near the top of the firmament (see figs. 2 and 3). The houseconnects with the apex of the world axis via a rope bridge that conveys a beam of powerdown to earth and to the nadir of the universe. The bridge is bordered on both sides byflowering tobacco plants, whose leaves were harvested by the architect of the cosmicegg to convert them into the thickened smoke of which the bridge, the house, itsinventory, and its residents are fashioned. In addition to housing the Tobacco Spirit andhis consort, the building's upper floor is home to the very first light shaman and hiswife, as well as to four insect men and their families. A plumed serpent lives on thestructure's lower level. Periodically, the insects gather around a gambling table onwhich they move specific counters to invade each other's spaces according to an arrowdice cast by the Spirit of Tobacco. On completion of a game, the snake erects itselfabove the gamblers, jingles the chromatic feathers on its head, and presents an orb ofradiant light on its forked tongue. Depending on which gambler wins, someone will liveor die on earth. Thus, the stakes are high in the celestial gambling game."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Figure 3. Zenithal house of the Tobacco Spirit. (Drawing byNoel Diaz)The construction of the cosmic egg, and with it the beginning of light shamanism,occurred in primordial times when plants, animals, and humans, although qualitativelyequivalent, became subject, nevertheless, to the fundamental law of mutual predationthat governs the zoological world. Bahama shamanism is conditioned by this existentialnecessity because the natural epiphanies of the Tobacco Spirit and his houseguests arelinked in an ecological food chain. In his earthly guise, the building's owner manifestsas the swallow-tailed kite. The insects materialize as a honey bee (Trigona capitata), astingless bee (Trigona hyalinata branneri), a wasp (Steno- polybia fulvofasciata), and atermite (Nasutitermes corniger M.), while the serpent is modeled on a blind snake(Leptotyphlops sp.). By natural design, these species raid or even raze each other'sliving spaces, decimate each other's progeny, and take each other's lives. Both bees eatthe nectar and pollen of the tobacco flowers along the rope bridge; the wasp feeds on thebroods of the bees and the termite; the snake eats the larvae of the termite and the wasp;"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"and the kite, at the top of the pyramid, lives on the bees' and wasps' honey and eggs, aswell as on the flying insects and the snake. The state of preordained intrusive hazardrypervading the birthplace of light shamanism is what potentiates bahana spirituality.Essentially neither good nor evil, it simply constitutes a baneful element of telluric life.The first light shaman-now residing in the cosmic egg-was only four years old whenhe surmised that, compensating for the dark world in the west, there had to be a lightworld in the east. After fasting for four days he fell asleep, and, with the surging heat ofvirgin fire beneath his hammock his spirit levitated via the world axis to the zenith.From there, a psychopomp conducted him northeasterly to the oval house of smoke.Inside the house, its owner regaled the youth with bow and arrows, while the four insectmen gave him four different gambling-board counters, consisting of a crystal, a ball ofhair, quartz pebbles, and a puff of tobacco smoke. The board, the dice, and the fourcounters are referred to as the bahana game, and the young light shaman became its firstfull-fledged earthly owner (kotubuarotu). Before leaving the house with his preciousgift, the youngster witnessed the snake erect itself over him, its feathers chiming. Theboy began manifesting a halo around his head, and the radiance of the serpent's glowingorb filled him with instant knowledge of all things bahana.Back on earth, the youth remained for four days in a trancelike state, ingestingnothing but cigars made of four wads of tobacco. This was to nurture four young insectreplicas (the two bees, a wasp, and a termite), that now lodged in his chest. They hadbecome his sons and began opening a lumen in each of his arms, ending in exit holes atthe base of each of his fingers (other than his thumbs). At age sixteen - on reachingspermatogenesis -the young man wed a bee girl and, cohabiting with her, introduced herto his spirit wards. Eventually, as noted, the couple took up residence in the TobaccoSpirit's house, where the wife changed into a frigate bird (Fregata magni- ficens) tobecome the first white shamaness, specializing, like her human successors, in curingnicotinic seizures. Once the Warao began populating the earth, the first light shamanshot two gambling tokens -the termite's quartz pebbles and the stingless bee's puff oftobacco smoke -into a young man's upper body. He did this to perpetuate lightshamanism on earth, albeit in diminished form, based on the weaker pair of insects inthe primordial shaman's breast. Although referred to as kotubuarotu (master of thegame), just like the first light shaman, modern practitioners proved incapable ofretaining the complete set of gamblers in their bodies. Instead, they carry only onetutelary spirit (termite) in their right torso and one (stingless bee) in their left, requiringbut a single exit hole in the palm of each hand.'"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Among his kind of bird spirits, the swallow-tailed kite ranks supreme, while three ofhis avian peers represent medium-level light shamanism and, three further ones, lower-level light shamanism. A similar hierarchy prevails among contemporary light shamansof the Warao. At their own initiative, and after eight days of isolation, instruction,fasting, sexual abstinence, and heavy smoking, they follow the example of the first lightshaman and become enlightened in the Tobacco Spirit's house. Soon after theirinitiation, they begin practicing within their families and, by accompanying establishedhealers, on nonfamily members. With growing expertise, the shaman takes on casessingly, treating pains of sudden onset, highly contagious diseases, and, particularly,gynecological problems precipitated by a hostile opposite number. He massages thepatient's hurting body part and applies oral suction to bring the sickness-causing objectto the surface. Depending on which of the two possible pathogens are diagnosed asimplicated, he lays on either one of his hands, the right for termite, and the left forstingless bee. The appropriate tutelary spirit travels through the healer's arm and hand,extracts the pathology, and inserts it into an object the shaman keeps ready for thispurpose. Should a light shaman's helper spirits be too \"young\" to overpower those ofolder counterparts, the healer acknowledges defeat and defers the patient to a moreaccomplished colleague. However, if one of the two celestial gamblers (not representedin the chest of the light shaman) wins the game, the patient dies. Light shamans expectpayment from their patients. Should they be unable to pay their healer, they offer theirbodies as remuneration to serve him as a lifelong \"son\" or \"daughter.\"As the number of therapeutic failures increases throughout their careers, senior lightshamans come under suspicion of being no longer willing to treat patients or of causingillnesses themselves. In his offensive role, a light shaman is referred to as hatabuarotu,\"master of (magic) arrows,\" or moho- karotu, \"he who discharges through the hand.\"Acting either on instruction of an ancestral shaman or on his own accord, he swallowsan arrow in the form of a small object. His internal helper spirits \"play\" with theprojectile to establish whose token's identity (termite's pebbles or bee's smoke ball) theprojectile is destined to adopt. The winner stores the missile in the shaman's (right orleft) elbow or wrist, waiting for him to fumigate the openings in his hands and todispatch the projectile into the victim.Senior light shamans are adamant that, while perfectly fit to do so, they never practicesorcery of this sort in their home communities. To demonstrate their loyalty to thegroup, they sometimes play a dangerous game at nightly seances, letting their helpingspirits fly like sparks throughout the house. The spirits are believed to be particularly"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"partial to such playfulness, and the shaman comments on their trajectory, as only heand, possibly, other participating light shamans can see them wafting gingerly fromperson to person without touching or landing on anyone's head. However, commonersare less approving of such frivolous sport that might result, for them, in illness or insudden death. Instead, they are relieved when light shamans recall their \"playing sons\"by blowing at them with tobacco smoke.'Veteran light shamans, on the other hand, are, first and foremost, sorcerers. Highestranking among light shamans, they are known as daunonarima, \"fathers of the woodenfigurine.\" The effigy in question is a twelve-centimeter-high and two-centimeter-thicksculpture in the round, fashioned either in the stylized form of the swallow-tailed kite'shead and neck or in a naturalistic rendering of a young person of undetermined sex,wearing a neckband to which two parrot feathers are attached as wings (J. Wilbert1975a:67, plate 66). The shaman keeps the effigy in a small calabash bowl and basket inthe sanctuary. Also stored in this container are three quartz pebbles, representing theelite of the kite's avian companions.' This foursome, comprised of the God of Origin'sson (kite) and his senior vassals (pebbles), possesses devastating power that veteranlight shamans employ not just to cause pain, as normally inflicted by their juniorcolleagues, but to kill. Veteran light shamans' sorcery is assault sorcery deployed tosettle intercommunity conflict or to conduct extratribal warfare (Lavandero 2000: 28),liquidating a large portion of a target population, especially its children. Thus, not alllight shamans are also fathers of the figurine. At most, there exists only onedaunonarima per regional subtribe, and possession of an effigy seems to run in families.Because masters of the figurine are not inclined to liquidate their own group's offspring,tolerating them in their midst assures villagers of the most powerful deterrent to assaultbahana.To perform assaultive sorcery, the master relies not on his insect helpers but on thekite itself and on its most eminent associates. The owner awakens the effigy byfumigating it with tobacco smoke and makes it stand and sway on the palm of hiscupped hand. Suddenly, the figurine lifts off with the roar of a hurricane and flies to thetargeted village, whose residents can hear the missile approaching but not see it. Onlythe local white shaman beholds the flying image and warns the people of the dying daysthat lie ahead. When in the air, the quartz pebbles surge in a triangular formationclosely followed by the figurine. Hovering over the village, and in true bahana spirit,the intrusive foursome selects its victims, swoops down, and kills the enemies one byone in quick succession. The pebbles tear into their bodies like an arrowhead, allowing"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"the effigy to penetrate deeply into its victims. The siege may last for four days, untilmany have succumbed as if to an attack by epidemic pestilence or a war party.Returning to its owner, the figurine's head and body are smeared with blood. Whilecleaning it with water, the sorcerer inquires about the success of the raid and thenumber of people killed. If there were more than five, he promises to prepare a gift oftobacco and sago flour. With this, the effigy is usually satisfied and rests in its basketuntil the sorcerer arouses it again, the reason for which might be to launch a new attackor simply to use the missile's roaring presence to warn the enemies and neighbors ofwhat will happen if they won't desist, mend their ways, or improve their conduct visa-vis the sorcerer (J. Wilbert 1979).Weather ShamanismWeather shamanism is at home in the mansions of the rain lords, situated on top ofthe mountains at the cardinal and intercardinal ends of the world (see fig. 1). Known asthe kabo arotutuma, \"masters of the night sky,\" the rain lords, except for large flaringheads, are of ordinary humanoid appearance, wearing white robes during the dryseasons and black ones during the wet seasons. They also don spectacles and sandalsand smoke elbow pipes. The rain lords occupy hierarchical positions in their assemblyof one female and seven male associates. During the dry seasons, the doors andwindows of their mansions, facing toward earth, are shut, while in the rainy seasonsthey remain wide open. Particularly after months of seclusion during the long dryseason, the lords burst out of their houses to urinate. On earth, it rains profusely andrivers overflow and flood the land.Men with the ascribed ability to influence precipitation are referred to individually asnaharima, \"father of rain.\" I have known only one (postmenopausal) woman who wasrecognized as naharani, \"mother of rain.\" It is peculiar to weather shamanism that allduly initiated practitioners are of mature age, ostensibly because the younger set cannotbe entrusted with its power. Personal initiative rather than supernatural call is whatmotivates the individual to apprentice himself to a competent master, seekingempowerment through instruction and trance initiation. The study period may last fromsix to twelve weeks, depending mainly on the physical and mental fortitude of thestudent. The gradual increase of tobacco consumption by smoking long cigars subjectsthe novice to a nicotine-induced inhibition of hunger pangs that culminates in physicaldistress and the mental symptoms of intoxication. Through this eminently didacticexperience, the candidate becomes aware that weather shamanism regulates hunger and"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"starvation. Whether in the form of soft rains or torrential downpours, precipitationdetermines human survival. Over slow-moving and soft rains, weather shamans exerciseonly defensive control by diverting them from their communities. Over stormy rain,however, they wield the power both to redirect and to attract the rain, thereby rulingover people's lives and deaths.What raises this statement above mere hyperbole is the connection that exists betweenprecipitation and the reproductive cycle of the sago palm moriche. Traditionally themainstay of Warao economy, weather- dependent sago provokes frequent episodes ofseasonal hunger and periodic famines. As the equatorial trough passes over the Orinocodelta twice in a single year, it produces a four-season pattern of equinoctial dry andsolstitial wet weather. During the intermittent shower activity of the dry seasons, sagois abundant, or at least reasonably plentiful. However, in the wet seasons, slow-movingdisturbances can cause continuous rainfall of up to ten or more hours at a time,triggering inflorescence in moriche palms across wide tracts of land and inhibiting sagoproduction in their stems. More typical of rainy seasons are fast-moving storms ofviolent but localized downpours, generally accompanied by thunder. Instantaneous,random, and sporadic, they restrict flowering to much-smaller areas and reduce sagoproduction in moriche stems to insignificant amounts or even none. Thisinterrelationship between precipitation and sago production is the crux of Waraoweather shamanism: anybody purported to control the rain in moriche groves is, ipsofacto, empowered to control local hunger or regional famine among moriche sago eaterslike the Warao.To acquire this climatic power is precisely the intent of someone who aspires tobecome a weather shaman. After weeks of learning, fasting, and tobacco smoking, theemaciated candidate prepares for the event of initiation. He points three or four two-foot-long cigars successively into the directions of the rain lords around the world, andby smoking the cigars by hyperventilation he offers them tobacco smoke. This puts himinto an ecstatic state in which he meets a manifestation of the supreme rain lord in theform of a waterspout or a tornado. Lifted up and swallowed by the colossal spirit, thenovice journeys through the lord's serpentine physic of water, thunder, and resplendentlightning, receiving instantaneous and total knowledge of the masters of the night skyand their ways. On leaving the twister spirit (via the rectum), the new weather shamanhas aged precipitously, and the rainbow, the lowest-ranking rain lord, takes up residencein his chest to give him titular status as rain lord and serve as his familiar.On rainy days throughout the year, weather shamans admonish people to be generous"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"with their food and share it with their neighbors, especially with the aged. They hint atpossible chastisement for unseemly stinginess and they practice their skills to keep therain at bay. In the Orinoco delta with its nearly 200 cm average annual precipitation, therain falls often, even in the dry seasons. To prevent rain from adversely impacting themoriche groves, weather shamans blow between the joined palms of their hands, thrusttheir arms skyward, and, uttering brief spells, command the clouds to dissipate. Besidesstaving off hunger, weather blowing also serves the purpose of forestalling numerousdiseases (rheumatic, respiratory, gastrointestinal) caused by rain that is believed to bethe urine, sweat, and tears of sky people. Like hunger, climatic health conditions are theweather shaman's weaponry, and hinting at its possible deployment provides sufficientstimulus to coax the people into generous and congenial behavior.'Generally speaking, precipitation has a negative connotation for the Warao. Were itnot for sundry ill-intentioned spirits and the weather shamans, however, rain would poseless of a problem to survival in the world. Acting either to protect their people from therain or to subject them to it, weather shamans do not cure but rather are primarilyinvolved in sorcery. For, if not falling of its own accord, without their intervention, theprecipitation against which weather shamans protect their groups is caused by otherweather sorcerers who inflict it on them. Especially during the long rainy season, whenclimatically related suffering is at its peak, weather shamans are not merely respectedbut are deeply feared as capable of enforcing their demands for resource sharing withthe elderly (themselves included) by conjuring up the specters of ill health, hunger, andstarvation. All shamans, and even commoners, can blow against up-coming storms,albeit with varying promise of success. But people think of the weather shamanprimarily as a sorcerer whom they might hear practicing his witchcraft against theirneighbors or their own community. A good part of the initiatory curriculum of weathershamanism is dedicated to the learning of necromantic chants, aimed at inciting the ireof the rain lords, individually, in groups, or all at once. Infuriated by the provocativeand violent imagery contained in these lengthy evocational recitations, the rain lordsstride with pounding heels to congregate on the celestial plaza below the top of thecosmic vault, where they perform a dance. Their stomping thunders through the clouds,the impact of their walking staffs sparks sky-rending lightning and their sweatingcauses heavy rainfall, while bellowing alligators dialogue with them in the sky. In fact,weather shamanism, serving the masters of the night sky, is akin to dark shamanism, inthat slow-moving climatic disturbances that provoke widespread famines every four tofive years are caused by alligators, the naguals (animal doubles) of dark shamans,providing weather shamanism with its most lethal weapon."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Dark ShamanismDark shamanism pertains to the land of darkness, which extends from the zenith andthe center of the earth to the solstitial sunset corners of the universe (see fig. 1). Theruler over this domain is Hoebo, the Ancient One, residing on the western mountain ofthe setting equinoctial sun. In fact, the sun sets daily in the very mansion of this god,keeping it and the entire precinct in perpetual darkness. Only two small lights-onewhite, the other yellow-illuminate the central site and cast a bone-white hue on itssurroundings.Hoebo's binary and lesser opposite is Miana. He occupies a house located on the worldplane near the zenith, west of the world axis, and is considered the soul of Hoebo (seefig. 2). This is the region where the sun starts its descent and moves across the thresholdof the land of darkness. As his name indicates, Miana suffers from dimmed vision andfavors soft crepuscular light; broad daylight dazzles him and causes him to squint.Nevertheless, despite his eye condition, Miana travels unimpaired between his homeand Hoebo's place at the world's end in the west.The land of darkness and its ruler have existed since the universe began. And when, inearly times, the Lord of Death decreed that spiritual humans were henceforth to becomeembodied mortals, Hoebo manifested as the red macaw (Ara chloroptera) and claimedthe new terrestrial species as his and his relation's staple food. In time, the parrot peoplebuilt a settlement of humble houses near macaw's colossal iron (or aluminum) mansion,and they gathered there with their lord to drink of human blood from a thirty-foot canoeand feast on human flesh from well-stocked larders. The blood container, like theparrots' houses and their furniture, is made of human bones. A gagging stench ofputrefaction saturates the air, and blowflies carpet the environs, sodden withcoagulating blood. Wind instruments of human tibias and skulls are playing, andpartakers in the banquets are attired in their feather coats adorned with necklaces ofhuman costal bone.Originally, Miana was responsible for providing the denizens of this netherworld withtheir fare. To procure sufficient blood he used a hosepipe (hoa ahutu) that was fastenedto a high-rise structure near the drinking trough. The line ran up the cosmic vault toreach a place halfway between Hoebo's and Miana's stations, from where it dangledover the encampment of the newly formed Warao. The duct was furnished with abrilliant headlight, which helped it find, at night, the heads of unsuspecting sleepers.When activated by Miana's chant, the blood duct pierced the people's skulls and entered"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"their hearts to start the draining. The caterer, however, did not permit the robot hose tobleed its victims dry. Instead he saved them, in their weakened state, for likely futuretapping. When meat was needed in the netherworld, Miana aimed his lethal chant at oneor more such damaged persons and waited until they died to carry their corpses to theland of night.The supreme macaw constitutes the quintessential morbus of Warao spirituality.Whereas individual priest-shamans stand to lose their body and their soul (bones)between the clashing gates through which they must pass on their initiatory journey, noancient one, except macaw, threatens all humanity with such complete annihilation.Throughout their oral history, the Warao have sought to strike some kind of modusvivendi with this awesome predator. There are, for instance, those who tame macawsand make them pets, part of their families. However, to avoid extreme aggressiveness,and thus injury from hacking beaks, they choose the blue-and-yellow species (abuhene;Ara ararauna), representing subordinate members of the netherworld, over the red-and-blue macaws (abahera) that stand for the divine macaw himself and his close kin. Inturn, there were macaw girls who attempted to bring humans into their families ashusbands. As ranking members of their predatory community, however, the macaws,instead of keeping men as mates, took them for food and ate them, triggering an all-outwar that nearly wiped out both peoples. Traditional spirituality has taught the Waraothat peaceful coexistence between humans and macaws is more than likely unattainable,so long as both are proximal sequential members in a food chain. Some mitigatingmanner thus was needed to make coincident survival possible for both species, and it isthe nature of dark shamanism to be this existential compromise.Dark shamanism takes its origin precisely from the last attempt at rapprochementbetween macaws and human beings. It all began when the macaw god's son-namedAbahera, like his father in his avian formstarted courting a beautiful Warao. Onfrequent visits to his girlfriend's village, the couple did indeed enjoy each other'scompany and lived as if they were already married. Alas, the woman also continuedrelations with a previous lover, Miana's son, called Hoebo like the ancient one. Whileneither of the men had any knowledge of the other, the maiden's elder brotherreprimanded her because of her promiscuous dealings. During an upcoming festival, heinsisted, she was to take no notice of her second wooer, the macaw, and socializeexclusively with Hoebo.The timing of the fiesta coincided with the day on which Miana had agreed to takeHoebo on a visit to the land of the supreme macaw. The father had already taught his"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"son the chant that activated the celestial blood duct. Now, however, the young manwished to see the drinking trough into which the siphoned blood was pouring and get toknow the god and all his distant kinfolk in the land of darkness. Reaching the halfwaypoint of their journey (where the artery hung down from heaven to the human village),the travelers heard the parrots' musicmaking in the netherworld. They also saw thewhite and yellow lights projecting through the darkness and heard the humming of theblood duct as it conveyed its vital cargo. Young Hoebo knew this place from earlierexperience, when he had come that far en route to meet his paramour. But now that heobserved the people and his girlfriend dancing below him in the village plaza, hedecided to forgo his visit to the netherworld and glided down the duct, head first, to joinhis woman and the merrymaking crowd.Meanwhile, Abahera, the Warao girl's other lover, had also been approaching thefestivities while playing, as courting bachelors do, a variety of flutes to announce hisarrival. Instead of regular flutes, however, made of wood or deer bone, his instrumentswere of the kind macaw men play; that is, of human skeletal parts that sound likeearthly aerophones but carry messages that are foreboding to the human ear. In fact, thewoman's brother trembled when he heard their eerie sound, and he warned his sister tobeware and heed his counsel. This time, the courting flutist would arrive prepared totake her as his wife.As Abahera reached the village, Hoebo was about to jump onto the plaza from above.But when the parrot realized that his intended wife recoiled from him in favor of thisother man, the jilted suitor stepped into the middle of the dancing guests, reached upwith his machete, and sliced his rival horizontally in half. A thunderous noise resoundedthrough the universe as the halves of Hoebo's body fell to the ground and as the bloodduct, which Abahera's knife had simultaneously severed, snapped westward to itsmoorings in the land of darkness. The headlight of the duct, which had been seen abovethe village like a small-sized moon, crashed with Hoebo's body to the dance floor.It had been Abahera's intention all along to cut the blood duct of the netherworld andrid humanity of this scourge. But he had also wished to keep the orb of light in hispossession to benefit his wife's community and humanity at large. He had infused thelight globe with his breath by chanting over it incantations of his own invention. Thiswould enable the light globe to function under his control as a new link betweenmacaws and humans. But now, although the food chain was forever severed, the fallenorb had shattered and its light dispersed across the earth like wind. The scattered lighthad turned into a myriad of pneumatic agents (hoa) that entered all components of the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"objective world. Villagers who witnessed the momentous transformation felt a sharppain in their chests and became nauseous as the miasmal air entered their bodies,debilitating everybody as if the blood duct were still working. Nobody knew of thepneumatic agents and their function, because their creator had rejoined his people in thenetherworld and Hoebo's body parts had moved, one half to the western region and theother half to the eastern region of the earth, where everybody learned of hoa pneumaand its workings. Thus, while perhaps of only qualified success for its avian instigator,the last attempt at peaceful coexistence between macaws and humans was of immenseimportance to Warao of later ages. It broke the ironclad conditions of macaw predation,supplanting it with the more moderate regime of hoa, controllable by hoarao (hoarotu,singular), that is, dark shamans.Having lost his body to a rival's jealous ire, Hoebo's soul rose to his father's (Miana)place west of the zenith. This is the classic location of Warao dark shamans, where allpractitioners of the order go to be empowered. Young men embarking on this quest doso of their own accord and not in answer to a higher calling. Together with their chosenteacher, they retire for a week to an isolated hut and start the process of initiation.During the first phase of this arduous procedure, the candidate abstains from food anddrink, smokes tobacco incessantly, and internalizes a repertoire of chants: miana chantsto secure victims for the netherworld and hoa chants to prevent patients from beingsacrificed.' Toward the end of this initial period, the master takes the burning end of atwo -foot-long cigar into his mouth and blows a hoebo spirit into it. He hands thismagically endowed cigar to his anxious ward and asks him to inhale its content deepinto his chest. On performing the same task for a second time (with a brother of the firsthoebo spirit), the student levitates in narcotic trance to the zenithal house, where hecomes face-to-face with Miana's son, Hoebo, the guardian of dark shamanism.Hoebo's house is similar in construction to the macaw god's mansion, albeit somewhatsmaller, perhaps, but black like it and built of metal. The furniture includes benchesmade of human bone and skin and hammocks fabricated of curdled blood. Hoebooccupies this reeking house together with his wife and their son. The child is only oneyear old and lies in a hammock in which his mother swings him gently in his sleep. For,when awake, the boy cries constantly from pain, prompting his father to console himwith a cradle song. This is the very song that Hoebo once learned from his father,Miana, to activate the blood duct of the netherworld in search of sleeping humans. Andthis is why trainees must come here to receive the singing power that activates thesucking snare (kaidoko) that they will receive as a proboscis in replacement of the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"inoperative celestial blood duct. Looking like a man with long, blood-matted hair,Hoebo bids the novice to enter his dark house and sit before him on a bench. He theninspects the young man's chest, hands, lips, and tongue and, if found adequate, inductshim as a novice shaman. He lets him keep the two fraternal hoebo spirits in his upperbody and implants a wound-up snare of hoebo power in his chest, below the sternum.Waking from his ecstatic maiden voyage, the candidate begins the second phase of hisinitiation, which will take a full month to complete. Because he needs to nurture thefraternal hoebo spirits in his chest and make his nascent lariat grow longer, he fasts andsmokes incessantly until the tendrils of this bifid sucking snare emerge from the cornersof his mouth each time he chants Miana's song or speaks ceremonially in a loud voice.As the ordeal of his induction draws to an end, the neophyte becomes increasinglyemaciated and displays the symptoms of severe nicotine intoxication conducive toconfirming the tenets of dark shamanism. He suffers from a smoker's throat that makesthe act of swallowing most painful. But, because his hunger pangs are quieted bynicotinic action he shows no interest in food or drink. Chances are that as the drugtransports him deeper into Miana's world, the neophyte experiences tobacco amblyopia(dimness of vision) and color blindness, which allow him to discern only white andyellow. His world takes on a bone-white, silverish hue, and he sees better in crepuscularlight than in the open sunshine. As neurotransmission becomes progressively impaired,the candidate assumes a deathlike state, which in some cases stops him temporarilyfrom breathing.' In this acutely liminal condition, the novice meets a demonic spiritwho beats him on the neck with a heavy cudgel. The spirit comes a second time andplaces him into a wooden dugout coffin. The fearsome demon then manifests a third andfinal time to entomb him in a sarcophagus that reeks of putrefaction. Near death, theneophyte beholds a beam of sunlight entering a crack in the coffin wall. Enlightened, heescapes and is reborn a new dark shaman.Dark shamans are members of the terrestrial cohort of the zenithal Hoebo, whichincludes vampires and bloodsucking insects like mosquitoes and sundry species ofpestiferous flies. Vampires descend from a nocturnal tribe of people who ate childrenand who acquired their present form through a promiscuous bat woman. Blood-suckinginsects stem from a young man who preyed on his sleeping wives and other members ofthe population by sucking their lifeblood through a straw. Both etiologies sharecharacteristic features with the origin of dark shamanism and, as explained below, withits current parasitic practices of bleeding people. Dark shamans and their cohortconstitute the living body of the zenithal Hoebo's soul, just as the latter is the soul of the"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"red macaw, and Miana that of the ancient Hoebo's body. Thus, as with light and weathershamanism, the spiritual home of dark shamanism is located near the zenith, where itspractitioners' souls assemble every night while their bodies remain sleeping in theirhammocks on earth. To prove that they continue nurturing their hoebo spirit pair andkaidoko snare through ceaseless smoking and tobacco chewing, dark shamans, on theirnightly visits, repeatedly present their paling yellow chests, tremulous hands, black lips,and furring tongues, which distinguish them as active hoarotu. These nicotine-relatedcharacteristics pertain to them, as do their fustybody odor and pronounced halitosis,ostensiblybe- cause they frequent Hoebo's fetid place and smoke cigars of curdledhuman blood at their nightly meetings.One other item continuously monitored by the zenithal Hoebo is the rate of humansacrifice, because the difference between the new and old regimes of netherworld-humanity relations is one, respectively, of autonomous and contingent manners ofpredation. No longer can the animated blood duct be employed to transport humanblood directly to the parrot's place. Because it was severed, the zenithal Hoebo and hiscohort are the only means of contact between the denizens of the netherworld andhumanity. The ancient one of the west, whether in his preepiphanic form of Hoebo or inthe guise of red macaw, can no longer come to the earth in person. However, as inearlier times, the zenithal Hoebo continues in his role as steward of the macaw's world,only now the rate and timing of predation depend entirely on him and on his kind.While fully capable of traveling between the celestial and terrestrial worlds himself, heusually relies for help on mature dark shamans and on the power of the proboscideansnares he has implanted in their chests.The difference between a mature and an immature dark shaman is one of respectivegrowth and practical experience. Although he knows the rudiment of his art, a younghoarotu nevertheless must allow sufficient time to let the spirit children in his breastgrow up and his sucking snare grow long before he qualifies to serve as Hoebo's hunter.Only in exceptional cases is a young shaman to practice killing people, as when, soonafter his initiation, the Macaw appears to him in his dream, requesting human flesh.Intimidated by the commanding apparition, the novice shaman may agree to snare aweak older person or a child. However, the initiation master warns his pupil not to deferto the macaw again, lest, as his tutor, he become obliged to divest the novice of hispowers. Mature dark shamans are usually older men, referred to as hoa fathers(hoarima). To attain this rank, they are required to possess the tools and techniques oftheir trade, as well as to have mastery over hoa, the pneumatic agent of sickness and"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"death.An accomplished master of hoa is essentially different from a beginner. Physically, asnoted, long-time and copious tobacco use has changed his appearance and engulfed himin a nicotine-effected atmosphere of pungent percutaneous odor and chronic fetidbreath. He has become infused with the miasma of the netherworld (marsh methane)that, since the light globe of the blood duct shattered, pervades the earth and all life onit with a latent stench of putrefaction. Originating with the exhalations of the jiltedparrot lover, this pneuma is considered to be a disease-carrying emanation that formsthe basis of Warao dark shamanism in particular, and of the group's pneumatic theory ofillness as a whole (W. Wilbert 1996). Mentally, as will be explained, the veteranhoarotu became the top predator of humankind and a lycanthrope who assures thesurvival of the macaw people, while leaving continued human existence in the hands ofyounger colleagues.When, in the course of maturation, the time has come for the dark shaman to begin hisservice to the netherworld, the zenithal Hoebo takes the shaman there to present him tothe divine macaw. The visitor looks around to see how the macaws are living. He seesthe blood canoe with its inactive duct. He also sees the house in the village of diseaseddark shamans (hoarao) that he will occupy on future visits and will dwell inpermanently after death, when he assumes, like all his predecessors, a chimeric formthat is halfparrot and half-human with a simian tail. But when the supreme macawoffers him a meal of human blood and roasted human flesh prepared with peppers,garlic, and onions he must decline,' thereby demonstrating that, while the macaw's ally,he is a mortal and not in food competition with the macaw people. Several nights later,a gratified macaw appears to the shaman begging him for food. If the zenithal Hoebo-inwhose company the shaman spends his sleeping hours-should consent, the approacheddark shaman will target, stalk, and kill a person at the next best opportunity.The ancient Hoebo (as red macaw) and his parrot retinue have an insatiable appetiteand keep asking for human fare. They do this mostly via the dark shaman's spirit sons,who appear to him in dreams. However, according to the new regime of contingentpredation, the shaman stalls and propitiates them at least four times with palm starchand tobacco before agreeing to comply. But when the spirit children appear a fifth timeto demand their proper food, he can no longer turn them away unsatisfied. He selects aperson who might already have been compromised by the climatic sorcery of a weathershaman, or any other vulnerable member of his own or of a neighboring community."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Sitting alone in his boat or somewhere in the forest, the sorcerer smokes five or sixcigars to image and sequester the hoa of a particular object in the world around him,usually a plant or animal. Once identified, he draws the fetid agent into himself so thatit lodges in his throat. He blows his spirit sons into the final cigar and makes themlinger just below the knot that ties the wrapper. Focusing his attention on the head of hisintended victim, the sorcerer intones Miana's ancient song to activate the snare belowhis sternum: Miana, warao akuamo saba (\"dimvisioned, going for a person's head\").With this, his proboscis begins unwinding and emerging from the corners of theconjurer's mouth. Potentiated by the spirit sons, its bifid ends travel near or far to findtheir target and, once at their destination, wind themselves around the victim's neck.This is the moment when the sorcerer takes another deep draught from his cigar, turns itabout, and, holding the fire in his closed mouth, blows forcefully into it. Wafting fromthe distal end come ribbons of tobacco smoke that now transport the appropriated hoaacross rivers and over tree tops to its intended target. It enters painfully below thevictim's rib cage and, with a final exclamation of the sorcerer's song, \"miana!\" the snareasphyxiates the victim as the hoa penetrates the heart.It takes the entire next day for the sucking snare to contract and completely return toits owner. And it may take several additional days or even weeks before this magicmurder will materialize. Meanwhile, though, the people are well aware of what is goingon. The sorcerer had left the village unaccompanied and, soon thereafter, someonebegan complaining of strong chest pain. This someone will soon face completeannihilation and pass the final hours haunted by the specter of nothingness.Shortly before expiring, moribunds are often urged to identify their killer. The namingof the sorcerer provokes great fury among bystanders, who may revile and physicallymaltreat the culprit. The cadaverous pallor of his chest is seen as evidence of hisculpability, as are his deeply nicotine-stained lips that resemble the macaw's blacklower beak, with which he breaks his victims' skulls and necks. If nothing else, themourners want the sorcerer quarantined for several days and scrutinized to see if he willsuffer pain or issue blood by mouth or from his body. For when a hoa penetrates aperson's heart, the blood starts flowing through the proboscis into the sorcerer's body.Furthermore, the morning after the interment, the sorcerer visits the aboveground tombto criticize the dead person for having refused to give him food, payments, or gifts(such as a machete, boat, or woman). In voicing his complaints, he bends over thecovered coffin and sucks the rest of the corpse's blood out through a cane. The bloodexchange between the victim and the sorcerer can also be observed in a spillage in the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"stools of patients, especially hoa-stricken children succumbing to dysentery; in thesputum of victims dying from hoa-mediated pulmonary tuberculosis; or from still otherhemorrhagic specialties of dark shaman sorcery.Because of all these indications of occurring blood transfusion, quarantined sorcerersare expected to become soiled with blood or to leak excess blood from their bodies, thusdetermining their fault and fate. They may be banned from their communities to lead alonesome life accompanied only by a wife or daughter. However, even ostracism cannotprevent a sorcerer from causing further harm. No matter how isolated he may be fromother people, his snare is never out of reach, and his macaw folk will keep prodding himfor sustenance. Thus, with compulsive intermittent regularity, the veteran dark shamanmust continue carrying blood (within his body) and corpses to the netherworld, danglingthem head down on his back, their heads knocking against his heels with every step hetakes in spiteful mockery of his victims.The first part of the carcass-bearer's road leads up the world axis to the zenith. Eventhough he is supported in this effort by his hoebo sons, the climb is strenuous and oftenaggravated by the victim's friends, who placed a red-hot coin into the dying person'smouth or else mutilated the corpse in order to hurt and handicap the murderer usingsympathetic magic. From the zenithal Hoebo's house the sorcerer carries his victim tothe netherworld, following the blood-sodden road along the firmament. After emptyingthe blood into the trough, the victim is butchered and cooked to feed the shaman's hoebosons and local denizens, reserving the heart and liver for the supreme macaw. Four dayslater, the sorcerer returns to earth, where his family prepares a gift of palm starch tocompensate the hoebo children for their help in slaying and transporting the body.Should the sorcerer's kinfolk fail to produce an adequate amount of sago, the spirits willget angry and demand a further human victim.Sometimes sorcerers fall ill or die soon after they have killed. That happens when, atdawn or dusk, male relatives of the deceased take up positions near the gravesite tosurprise the stealthy bloodsucker. Occasionally, they hear the sorcerer taunt the corpse,deriding his or her pathetic lot. To get impressions of his footprints, they place a layerof damp clay on the coffin. To injure or to kill the visitor, they shoot at him with a bowand arrow (or a shotgun) and find his blood or his dead body in the morning. If thesentries wound the visitor, the sorcerer will soon contract a hemorrhagic illness or willsustain a laceration. But if they kill him, they will find the sorcerer's body in its nagualform of alligator (Crocodylus acutus) or, more rarely, teju lizard (Tupinambisnigropunctus) of blackish color with yellow bands across its back."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Warao consider alligators and sorcerers as qualitatively equivalent withinterdependent fates, simultaneously suffering injury or death when either part isharmed. To dream of an alligator is to be confronted with the reptile's hoa, about tostrike through magic action. If the alligator bites, the dreamer will fall sick or die.Should the dreamer take up weapons against his attacker, the alligator shape-shifts andreveals itself as a well-known sorcerer. Alligator and sorcerer share severalcharacteristics that make them fitting as doppelganger. Both are night stalkers, forexample, whose eyesight is best adapted to crepuscular light. Both identify themselvesto friend and foe by a fusty body odor, the shaman on account of excessive nicotineabsorption and the alligator because of distinctive glandular secretions. Most important,alligator and sorcerer are fiercely aggressive to the point of cannibalism and vampirism.As the life-devouring man snatchers they are said to be, they strike their victimsindiscriminately whenever they get a chance to drag their prey into the netherworld todie. Thus, dark shaman sorcerers are shape-shifting were-alligators, feared and loathedby the Warao for their cunning savagery.As a rule, only veteran dark shamans function as sorcerers, while junior practitioners,owing to retarded metamorphic growth, as noted, practice as dark shaman healers. Evenonce matured, some dark shamans say they rarely feel inclined to practice sorcery,remaining focused instead on pro tecting their community from attacks by theirmalignant others. There are great battles raging between dark shamans of adjacentcommunities, each side claiming that if it were not for their predacious opponents,survival rates would be much higher in their land.As soon as adults or children suffer from sharp pain in their bodies or experienceinternal bleeding as evidenced in stool, vomit, or sputum, people send for a darkshaman healer to cure them of what they presume is hoa sickness. Sitting near thepatient's hammock, the attending healer smokes cigars, washes his hands with balsamwater, and begins singing a therapeutic hoa song without calling on Miana. Indiagnosing the disorder, he lets himself be guided by the degree of pain the patientmanifests and by a comparison of the case before him with others he has treatedpreviously. While chanting about the etiology of the sickness and about the patient'sidentity and nature, the healer speculates which of the countless hoa might beresponsible for the suffering. Hoa pertaining to large and hard things cause greater painthan those of smaller and softer objects. Further complicating the diagnosis, patients arefrequently afflicted with multiple pneumas, and some require intervention by severaldark shaman healers at the same time.

It may feel, forinstance, like a tapir, snake, or palm stem, and this \"knowing in his hand\" enables himto identify the hoa. To extract it from the patient's body, he releases his kaidoko snare topry it loose and fling it into space. Should multiple hoa be involved, he repeats thetreatment, hoping that the patient will eventually recover. If not, the family consultsanother healer who, if successful, will cast suspicion on his unsuccessful colleague. Heis, presumably, no longer interested in healing but rather anxious to advance in hiscareer as caterer to the supreme macaw. Dark shaman healers are rewarded for theirefforts unless the recovered patient is a member of their own close family; familymembers are not expected to pay for treatment. If patients or their kin are unable toraise the needed compensation, the healer receives them in quasi peonage.Guardians of SocietyA detailed discussion of Warao shamanism in a New World, Asiatic, or overallcircum-Pacific context is beyond the scope of this essay. Its constituent orders, asenumerated elsewhere, contain critical elements of the shamanic experience that are ofnear-universal distribution (J. Wilbert 1972:81). Also beyond the scope is a detailedtelling of the layered quality of Warao shamanism, featuring sections and, possibly,entire orders of diverse ethnic origins. Readers familiar with South Americanethnography will have real ized, for example, that in the absence of wild and cultivatednicotianas, ecstatics among nonagricultural Warao must be beholden to aboriginalfarmers around the Orinoco delta. Light shamanism, in particular, centering on theTobacco Spirit, appears to be inspired by northern Carib, of whom contemporary groupspicture similar religious landscapes, image the same principal protagonist, andconceptualize identical techniques of shooting pathogenic projectiles (via a lumen inthe arm and openings in the hands of sorcerers) as do the Warao (J. Wilbert 1993:183-218, for the Yekuana; ButtColson 1977:55-56, for the Akawaio; Gillin 1936:172, 140,for the Barama; Civrieux 1974:55, for the Carina).The order of dark shamans in turn contains elements of Mesoamerican religion andritual. Lethal Warao hoa cut into victims just as Aztec flint knives once opened thebreasts of sacrificial victims in order to tear out their hearts. And, in both cases, humanhearts are or were fed the gods to give them strength. Furthermore, the scarlet macawwas the Maya sunbird, and sun gods featured kaidoko-like tendrils in the corners oftheir mouths and a triangular toothlike projection in the center, resembling the frontalview of a macaw's beak. Anthropomorphic bat demons had long ribbons emerging from"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"their mouths that were associated with boring into or sucking from the head (Barthel1966). Most striking is the belief that Maya temples were built by a race of dwarfs incomplete (miana) darkness. The rulers who lived on top of these mountainous structuresreceived their nourishment in the form of blood through an animated hollow rope thathung suspended in the sky. For some unknown reason, the blood duct was later cut andthe artery disappeared forever (Tozzer 1907:153; Furst, in J. Wilbert 1993:129; cf.Looper and Guernsey-Kappelman 2000). Further discussion of these ethnohistoricalparallels as well as others, such as the apparent relationship of bahana gambling toMesoamerican petolli and ball games, must await a future opportunity. What does bearhighlighting in the present context, however, is the power that shamans and sorcerersexercise in matters of Warao personal, social, and spiritual survival.Veteran ecstatics of the Warao form a group of prestigious elders (idamo- tuma).They stand apart from junior members of their respective shamanic orders, as well asfrom nonecstatic men (nebu), especially young ones (neburatu). Whereas nowadayselders reside within local bands pertaining to their subtribe, in the not-too-distant pastthey purportedly lived in ceremonial centers apart from the bulk of the population.Veteran shamans occupied separate houses grouped around a shrine or temple and adance floor. In their houses they sat on wooden stools (duhu) and smoked ritual tobacco(kohoba), communicating with the pantheon of celestial powers.10 Food was catered tothem by their sons-in-law and by other rank and file, and most of their further needswere taken care of by former patients who had mortgaged their bodies in compensationfor a healing they had received. In the course of their career as curers, elders acquiredfour or more such servants through the institution of voluntary bondage known as atehowabia, \"sacrificing\" or \"betraying one's body.\" They were male and female debtorpatients who were called, respectively, neburatu, \"servant,\" and uka- tida, \"daughter.\"Even today when ceremonial centers no longer exist, this institution of healer bondagecontinues to prevail among the Warao, and elders maintain the lifestyle, assume therights, and exercise the powers of former center residents.Traditionally, the assembly of elders includes the \"fathers\" (arimatuma) of the ancientone (priest-shaman), of the wooden figurine (light shaman), of rain (weather shaman),and of hoa (dark shaman), plus an occasional old shaman of lesser rank. Youngpractitioners do not qualify for membership because they are considered immature andnonestablished, that is, lacking bonded patients. In contrast, elders not only rely on theservices of indebted patients but also secure their personal survival through the controlof women in their communities. Allotting each other their daughters (engendered or"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"awarded), nieces, and granddaughters as plural wives (Heinen 1972:332), they aspire toincrease their female progeny and acquire additional sons-in-law who are obliged torender bride service for the lifetime of their spouses. Insofar as their rights includeprivileged access to pubescent girls, elders stand in competition to male adolescentswho dare not challenge them for fear of spiritual retribution. Intergenerationalpolygynous marriages of elders to girls of descending generations inadvertentlyimpinge on the male-female ratio of unwed adolescents that, for this and other reasons,maybe as low as one to four. This unnatural demographic imbalance rightly causes greatconcern among boys anxious to find a marriage partner of their own generation withinthe (exogamous) bands of their (endogamous) subtribe. Finally, with advancing age,elders cease engendering further children and probably die sooner than their youngerspouses, seriously curbing the latter's reproductive potential and thwarting the personaland social unfolding of these prematurely widowed women.As constantly preoccupied with maintaining a balanced society within a universe inequilibrium, elders justify satisfying their personal demands at public expense in termsof their role as guardians of society. They constitute their congregation's spiritualcenter, where cosmic pathways meet and life and death become imbued with existentialmeaning and purposeful adaptive order. In their protective roles, elders shield theirpeople from destructive forces that threaten to tear down their lives. Attack bypathogenic agents is one such force that throws communities into disarray bydecimating or, possibly, dissolving them completely. Ideally, however, elders becomeinvolved as healers only in severe cases or when the community is overwhelmed bysickness as, for instance, during primary rainy seasons. Ordinarily, healing is essentiallyleft to younger shamans, female herbalists, and even to lay persons. Elders go on theoffensive against sickness-causing forces and preempt aggression by proactivemeasures. Rather than healers, therefore, elders are sorcerers who use their powers tomaintain the balance of the universe.As noted, most pathogenic agents are of supernatural origin and are free to afflicthumanity at will, and sorcerers are empowered to engage this lethal force to launchretaliatory attacks against their neighbors. Thus, sorcerers are the interface betweentheir own community and all others, waging intercommunity warfare to protect theircongregations from attrition and extermination. Priest-shaman sorcerers engage mainlythe southern mountain gods and allied febrile diseases, including measles, typhoidfever, and malaria, that figure among the principal infectious diseases and/or causes ofdeath among contemporary Warao (W. Wilbert 1984). Light shaman sorcerers harness"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the power of the zenithal tobacco spirit, who has direct access to earth via a rope bridgeand the world axis and whose gambling cohort provoke cases of sickness and death. Butwhen the sorcerer deploys the supreme spirit himself, residing with him in the guise ofthe wooden statuette, he subjects his enemy to the full force of sudden and rapidlyspreading infectious diseases, such as whooping cough, influenza, cholera, and dengue,scoring especially among small children with whooping cough and influenza and amongthe general population with cholera and dengue. Similarly, the lords of rain need nohelp from humans to spread sickness across the world. However, when incensed by thespell of the weather sorcerer, rain gods bear down with force. They cause hunger in thesorcerer's neighboring communities and famine across the delta, provoking weather-related illnesses of the eastern and the northern mountain gods, includinggastroenteritis, diarrhea, influenza, and pneumonia, that claim more than half of thefatalities attributed to eleven principal causes of death in the delta (W. Wilbert 1984).Finally, dark shaman sorcerers retaliate against outside attack by mustering the westerngod's allied diseases. Demographic studies show that prepuberty mortality amongsubtribal bands amounts to 49 percent and that nearly half of children's deaths areattributable to dark shaman sorcery (J. Wilbert 1983; 1993:104). Large numbers ofenemy children succumb to hemorrhagic diseases like amoebic and bacillary dysentery,and many blood-coughing neighbors die of consumption.In short, the Warao separate young shamanic healers from old shamanic sorcerers.Young shamans lack the power and qualifications to practice sorcery. They function astheir group's defense in stemming assaultive sorcery. In contrast, old shamans serveprimarily as offense, attacking hostile outsiders. The practitioners of both sides interactwith one another in dissimi lar complementarity; one team's defense presumes theother's offense, and vice versa. Ideally, neither side of the contenders counts withshamans who, for practical purposes, would be at once benevolent and malevolent.Instead, one's own healers and sorcerers are generally held as good; those of others areall evil.The mutual fear of sorcery and the dread of contagion had significant ramificationsfor Warao survival during the colonial bottleneck. Soon after discovery and throughoutthe colony, native populations of the Caribbean and northern South America wereravaged by pandemics of Old World pestilence. Warao traders, seeking iron tools andtobacco, witnessed the devastation that previously unknown disease wreaked on theirindigenous neighbors. In the eighteenth century, Warao escapees from Europeanmissions and Criollo towns had become well aware of precipitous population declines"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"(50 to 6o percent), as well as the disorganization and extinction of autochthonouscultures on the Orinoco plains and in the Guianas (Morey 1979; J. Wilbert 1993:40-45).Occasional crossings of the epidemiological frontier like these also brought exoticepidemic diseases into the Warao heartland, but disease flare-ups there rarelyencountered populations large enough to sustain infectious chains.Experience has taught the Warao to live apart from one another in small bands of\"true Warao\" (less than 50 persons); to mix only with relatively close subtribal \"Waraorelatives\" (less than 200 persons); and to avoid all other Warao and foreigners.Subtribal boundaries are maintained by dialectical variations in language, kenning,marriage rules, allegiance to subtribal patron deities, and fear of contagion (J. Wilbert1975b). In integrating the new diseases into the tribal shamanic and cosmological orderthe Warao wisdom tradition mythologized their etiologies, placing them, like earlierendemic diseases, into the hands of directional gods and sorcerers (J. Wilbert 1983).Thus, native awareness of disease etiology reinforced subtribal boundaries andbolstered the people's faith in their divine patron and in their elders. Under theirprotection, subtribal bands are safer from pathological spirit intrusion, preciselybecause, unlike sedentary village farmers and wide-ranging traders in theirneighborhood, Warao migratory forager groups were traditionally small, dispersed, andfairly isolated from the outside world, thus offering relative immunity through the dualprocess of the elimination of most susceptibles from successive generations and theselection of less virulent strains over lethal ones, which die with their hosts (Murdock1980). Unfortunately, things are not always as clear-cut as they might have been. Attimes, sorcerers act as healers and curative shamans are suspected, like sorcerers, ofunleashing virulent diseases on their own kind. Least feared are priest-shamans,followed by light shamans then weather shamans. But dark shamans become abhorredas enemies from within and may be chastised, beaten, and/or banished from thecommunity.One frustration frequently expressed by the Warao is that were it not for dark shamansthere would be little illness in this world. It is true, of course, that through proactiveaction by practitioners of other orders, patients may feel less helpless and moreempowered to remedy or even to prevent bad health. Thus, patients asked by the priest-shaman to recognize their transgressions contribute to their own healing by confessingtheir failures. Similarly, weather shamans place illness into the moral sphere by makingpeople accept personal responsibility for altruistic behavior as well as for theconsequence of ignoring it. While sorcerer-mediated attacks by pathogenic forces can"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"always be reckoned with, this moralizing paradigm of disease and disease preventionturns patients into healers' helpers and lends a degree of causative order to supernaturalcapriciousness (Pagels 1988:145-47). However, the Warao's main problem with darkshamanism is that unlike pathogenic spirits handled by practitioners of other orders, themacaw god of the western mountain is completely blocked from reaching earth byhimself. His sole access to humanity is via the dark shaman: without the dark shaman'scooperation the terror of hoa suffering and dying would not exist at all.This leads me to refer, in closing, to a second outside force-aside from illness-fromwhich elders are expected to protect their community: warring enemies. For centuries,regional groups in the lower Orinoco delta must have battled intrusive partiesencroaching on their respective sago groves. However, at the beginning of the Christianera, Carib-speaking groups from northeast Amazonia spread down the Orinoco to thewestern edge of the delta. Contemporary Warao refer to their descendants as \"red faces\"and \"warriors\" and speak with horror of their practices of enemy mutilation, trophytaking, and cannibalism. Whereas accounts of their violence reverberate ruefullythroughout Warao traditional history and lore, the arrival of the red-painted cannibalson the western outskirts of the delta may well have triggered the western mountaingod's epiphany as the red macaw, claiming the Warao as his staple food. Like theircannibalistic enemies of the past, this divine denizen and his cohort dismember theirvictims, annihilating them body and soul by eating their flesh and converting their life-bearing bones into flutes and body ornaments (cf. Whitehead 1984, 1988).And herein lies the fundamental bane of dark shamanism. Instead of decimating theirenemies and keeping them at bay like light shamans do with their devastating idols,dark shamans collude with the insufferable enemy and carry destruction into their owncamps, or at least that is how it strikes ordinary Warao who don't hesitate to vent theiranger at dark shamans. However, upon sober evaluation some traditionally enculturatedWarao also volunteer that in facing an enemy of catastrophic power dark shamans hadno choice but to settle for a more moderate modus vivendi. In order to uphold theprimordial covenant of contingent predation they must abide by its imperative tobalance the existential needs of the celestial and terrestrial parties involved. The factthat in the process hoa fathers became empowered to ration the macaw people's foodsupply and manage their survival is certainly of great (psychological) benefit to humansand makes tolerating dark shaman sorcerers in their midst more bearable. Further, to theWarao it is equally redeeming that predation by the netherworld is reigned in even morethrough the healing power of dark shamans, conversely ensuring the survival of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"humanity.Notes1 The data in this chapter were gathered in the course of repeated visits (since 1954) tothe Winikina subgroup of the Warao. While I use the generic ethnonym Warao, it iswell to bear in mind that regional variations in culture patterns do exist and that thepresent information pertains primarily to the Winikina. Furthermore, over the pasthalf century, spirituality has changed among the younger set of Winikina; describedhere are religious ideas I acquired mainly between the 195os and the 1980s.2 Regional subgroups may be allied with different supreme spirits either of the south,the north, or the east.3 One natural model of the cosmic egg is the human body, with its torso and two lungsseparated by the diaphragm from the abdomen and the viscera.4 Nicotine, the principal active ingredient in tobacco, is the most potent insecticide innature; the Warao are well aware of its effect on bees, wasps, and termites. Thewisdom of the Tobacco Spirit in choosing tobacco smoke as the construction materialfor his sky house lies precisely in the narcotic's hold on insects. Nicotine is the secretmagical power that suspends the natural law of predation innate in the residents of thecosmic egg and enables them to join in bahana games on earth and in the sky.5 The aforementioned senior companions of the swallow-tailed kite form a hierarchyamong themselves comprising a governor, a chief, and a deputy; that is, the highestpolitical officers of postcolonial regional and local subgroups.6 Weather shamans have no direct technique for dispatching pathogenic projectiles intoindividuals. Instead, their sorcery aims at debilitating victims indirectly throughexposure to hunger, famine, and inclement weather conditions-exposing them to themachinations of malevolent shamans.7 The Warao distinguish between three different kinds of hoa chants: those used toinflict illness; those used to cure illness; and those used to cure injuries and lesserpains. Dark shamans mediate the first two kinds, but the third kind falls outside thepurview of ecstatic shamanism and can be sung by anybody, including shamans andpatients themselves. Nonshamanic curing chants are called pain-blowing (ahitemoi),and some individuals (ahitemoi arotu) are considered better at it than others. As agenre, these hoa chants pertain to the pain-blowing complex of wide distribution in"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"native South America and elsewhere, variously entailing chant-blowing,breathblowing, and spit-blowing techniques. The latter two therapies are oftenaccompanied, respectively, by tobacco smoke or nicotine-laden saliva, withsignificant antipyretic and analgesic effects (Briggs 1994; Olsen 1996; J. Wilbert1987).8 I have personally not witnessed cases of tobacco blindness and/or nicotine-inducedrespiratory arrest. The description of Shamanism by dark shamans leaves little doubt,however, that these conditions do occur and that tobacco pharmacology served thecomplex as a blueprint among the Warao and possibly elsewhere. Needless to say, thesymptomatology of toxic amblyopia and acute ganglionic impulse inhibition are notexperienced in their totality at any one time. Instead, dark shamanism as a religiousinstitution represents the cumulative experience of generations of shamans thatculminated in a comprehensive understanding of the symptomatology and itsapplication to this exacting shamanic belief system.9 Traditional Warao, especially shamans, don't eat these particular vegetables. Theirappearance in the present context only underlines the radical otherness of the courseand provides a link between the strong odor of these vegetables and the fetid pneumaof hoa.in The stratification of Warao society into elders and commoners is reminiscent of theTaino culture of the Greater Antilles. Other parallels include the occurrence ofshrines, incense burners, ceremonial centers, rock idols, village gods, ritual dancegrounds, as well as ceremonial benches and tobacco use. The designations forsuperior (idamo/nitaino) and inferior (nebu/naboria) statuses appear to be cognate.The terms for ceremonial bench (duhu) and tobacco (kohoba) are identical in bothlanguages, and the so-designated objects represent loan items in Warao ergology.This constitutes an additional example of culture borrowing in Warao shamanism.ReferencesBarthel, Thomas. 1966. \"Mesoamerikanische Fledermausmotive.\" Tribus 1: 101-24.Briggs, Charles, L. 1992. \"'Since I Am a Woman, I Will Chastise My Relatives':Gender, Reported Speech, and the (Re)production of Social Relations in WaraoRitual Wailing.\" American Ethnologist 19 (2): 337-61.. 1994. \"The Sting of the Ray: Bodies, Agency, and Grammar in Warao Curing.\" Journal"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"of American Folklore 107 (423): 139-66.Butt-Colson, Audrey. 1977. \"The Akawaio Shaman.\" In Carib-Speaking Indians:Culture, Society, and Language, ed.

Yet participation in such a politicalprocess through the norms of democratic action favored in Europe and the United States(i.e., TV campaigns, media interviews, sponsor dinners, public meetings, and caucuscommittees, etc.) is not generally a significant part of the political culture of othercountries. On the one hand, this allows the \"progressive\" West to devalue the politicalprocesses of postcolonial societies through the rhetoric of liberal democracy because ofthe lack of Western forms of political institution and practice. On the other hand, theabsence of such cultural idioms leads to forms of political engagement that areculturally opaque to Western observers. This is not to suggest that properly democraticpolitical process is irrelevant or unachievable in such postcolonial contexts, but it doesimply that, as in other realms of sociocultural life, cultural difference needs to beinterpreted and understood rather than taken as a marker of primitiveness or lack ofdevelopment. Such interpretation might then suggest that the absorption of the worddemocracy into a local lexicon of words and ideas that are cast as necessary forprogress, such as \"democracy,\" \"participation,\" \"globalization,\" \"biodiversity,\" reveal amimetic process at work, in which \"democracy\" is regarded as an exogenous socialgood, yet also one that is distinctly under- problematized in the local context. In thecase of Guyana it is common to hear that \"they [the developed countries] have it; wehave [depending on whom you talk to] had it since 1992; it's a good thing for us.\"Democracy is, of course, no less a problematic concept in countries with a long historyof democratic political process.In this essay we analyze and compare the role of sorcery and witchcraft incontemporary local and regional politics in Guyana and the Venezuelan Amazon inorder to illustrate the way in which occult forces have been incorporated into theregional and national political process. In general terms this has recently been thesubject of study by both Taussig (1997) and Coronil (1997), who in different waysconsider how the \"magic\" of the Venezuelan state is established through its associationwith occult powers, particularly the popular spirit cults. In a broader frame of referenceit is evident that voudoun has played a similar role in the establishment of the Duvalierregime in Haiti (Diedrich 1970; Ferguson 1989), and we suggest here that Obeah hasalso been used to enhance the political potency of the Forbes Burnham regime inGuyana. However, although we may have elegant and informative studies of the formsof ideology that the ruling elites have deployed to gain consensus for their projects ofmodernization and development, we have little sense of how those processes played out"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"in the margins of national political culture, or what broader cultural forms are harnessedin the process of occult government, in particular those that invoke indigenous powersor indigeneity in general. Thus Taussig (1997), for example, discusses the ideologicalpower of the Tres Potencias but does so through an exclusive consideration of the SpiritQueen, and the latent and darkly mysterious spirit force of El Indio is left withoutcommentary. This essay is in part intended to correct Taussig's lack through aconsideration of how native dark shamanism, bykanaimas, pitadores (poisoners), andfalse prophets has fed the political imaginary and practice of postcolonial Guyana andVenezuela.Shamanic Forces and Colonial RuleFrom the sixteenth to mid-seventeenth centuries, the Warekena, Bare, and Baniwawere part of the peoples belonging to the macropolitics of the Manoa and Omagua(Oniguayal) areas of the Rio Negro region. (Vidal 1993; Whitehead 1993,1994, 1999a,1999b). These macropolities were multilingual, multiethnic social systems with aninternal interethnic hierarchy led by a paramount chief and a powerful elite ofsecondary chiefs. Internal sociopolitical contradictions and conflicts and thedemographic decimation of the Amerindian populations through disease andenslavement after the European colonization of the region combined by the end of theseventeenth century to produce radical disruptions in these macropolities. Thesedisruptive processes caused the regrouping of many indigenous peoples such that by theearly eighteenth century in the Rio Negro region new less-hierarchical and more-confederated sociopolitical formations emerged (Vidal 1993). Such confederacies wereflexible and varied in their ethnic membership and were led by charismatic chieftainswhose po litical power was based first on their ability to build a personal following(kinfolk, in-laws, and allies) sufficient to generate military capacity, as well as on theirskills as regional traders, especially of European goods, and on their shamanicknowledge and power. During the eighteenth century there were as many as fifteen suchconfederacies led by the forefathers of the Warekena, Bare, and Baniwa groups.By contrast, to the east in the Guyana region the proximity of the Atlantic coast meantthat interactions with the colonial regimes in the area were early and intense, leading tothe co-option of some Amerindian groups into the structures of colonial power-principally as an informal militia to defend the colony externally against otherEuropean powers and internally to control the black slave population. The aboriginalmacropolities of this region, Huyapari and Aruaca, were thus undermined by European"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"intrusion and their leaders either co-opted or conquered (Whitehead 1994, 1998). Intheir place, due to the nature of colonial policy toward the native population in thisregion, an implicit system of ethnic ranking emerged with regard to the colonialadministration, which baldly promoted the favored \"tribes,\" such as the Caribs andArawaks, to the detriment of other inland and coast groups, such as the Akawaio,Makushi, Warao, and Yao (Whitehead 1996).These ethnic formations were, however, inherently unstable and often evanescent,owing to their dependence on European weapons and manufactures and their increasingintegration with the colonial commercial networks of European goods. This colonialintegration led to fierce competition and internecine conflicts among the leading groupsas well as with those excluded by the colonial co-option of particular tribes andconfederacies. Thus, the European colonial system itself and interactions amongEuropeans and Amerindians were decisive for the creation, transformation, andextinction of these ethnic sociopolitical formations of the eighteenth century(Whitehead 1990, igggc).By the early nineteenth century the Arawakan groups of the Rio Negro region wereoften led by shaman-chiefs, who conducted important rituals according to a shamanictradition known as kuwai. Such cosmologically adept leaders were thus able to bothconsolidate clan and group identities and lead military actions against the colonialregime. In the period 18311851 these groups were still celebrating importantmultiethnic rituals and religious ceremonies in the areas of Vaupes, Isana, and Negrorivers (Chernela 1993; Spruce 1996; Wallace 1969; Wright 1881), and, during thesecond half of the nineteenth century, panindigenous messianic movements had alsoemerged (Hill and Wright 1988; Wright and Hill 1986). These messianic movements,led by Arawak- and Tukano-speaking shamans and prophets promising the means tomaterial survival and the persistence of community, laid a basis for regionalrelationships and the formation of the political religious hierarchies that are presenttoday. As a result, during most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the Arawakanpeoples were an important factor in the formation of urban and rural Criollo cultures inthis region, particularly those in Manaus, Puerto Ayacucho, and Puerto Inirida. Theseinfluences included most of the practices for daily diet and cooking, fishing, hunting,and agricultural, for the exploitation of natural forest resources, and, most significant,for spiritual and ritual beliefs and practices.In the Guyana region the process of contestation with colonialism was deflected bythe way in which the more powerful indigenous leaders were co-opted by colonial"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"policy. Indeed, open antagonism to the colonial authorities in British Guiana wasclassically more a symptom of isolation and marginalization from the perceivedbenefits of alliance with the colonial authorities than a token of antipathy to the colonialprojects of development and evangelization. Comparatively speaking it is important tonote the almost simultaneous emergence of prophetic and millennial-style cultleadership among the Amerindians of Guyana and the Rio Negro in the latter half of thenineteenth century. However, although in both cases this was rooted in thesociopolitical challenges that colonial intrusion created to \"traditional\" modes of ritualand political action, in the Guyana region such prophetic movements were directedtoward securing, rather than resisting, the attentions of colonial development (seeWhitehead 2002).For this and other reasons there are important differences in postcolonial politicalculture as it emerged in Venezuela and Guyana. Most important to appreciate is the factthat Guyana was not decolonized until the 196os, some 150 years after Venezuela. Thistime difference clearly limits the way in which the postcolonial political processes ofthe two countries can be compared as a matter of political science. However, it isrelevant to observe that models of democratic action, as defined by Western politics,could not be wholly and simply transposed to settings where the political history ofcolonialism itself was so distinct, as argued in the introduction to this essay. Theinvention of radical new political norms in the wake of decolonization thus provoked inboth Guyana and Venezuela the development of alternative models of politicalassociation that had more or less overt \"occult\" asso- ciations-francmasoneria(freemasonry) in Venezuela and oobeah / oobia (obeah) in Guyana. It was not so muchthe content of these beliefs as the fact that they were shared among an emergent andself-defining elite political class of rulers that made them important initially. But overtime the exercise of power through such potentially occult forms made such politicalsystems responsive, even vulnerable, to shamanic influence, as was notoriously the casein Duvalier's Haiti.Arawakan Shamans, Witches, and SorcerersAmazonian shamans have extensive spiritual-political and economic power in theirsocieties because their ritual knowledge is crucial to the reproductive processes, in bothbiological and sociocultural terms, of the local group. The religious beliefs and ritualpowers of Arawakan shamans of the northwest Amazon are thus strongly preoccupiedwith collective death, the rebirth of individuals and groups, and the continual processesof cosmic destruction and renewal."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Warekena, Bare, and Baniwa are three Arawak-speaking groups living in differentcities, townships, and riverine environments of the upper Guainia, upper Negro, andupper Orinoco basins' These peoples share with other Arawakan groups the shamanicand prophetic tradition of kuwai, kuwe, or katsimbnali (\"the voice of the creation\"),which first made the world. Kuwai is also present as a monstrous, primordial humanbeing (Hill 1993:xvii), master of all visible and invisible beings (Wright 1993), whocontrols the sky and the universe through his powerful knowledge and who came to thisworld to teach people his sacred ritual powers, which men secretly learn duringinitiation or puberty rites. The ritual system associated with kuwai is divided intomythical cycles, with each cycle consisting of a corpus of narratives in the form ofstories, myths, chants, songs, prayers, and so forth. Together with other kinds of ritualknowledge, the \"teachings of kuwai\" comprise a coded symbolic and pragmaticrepertory of great significance that strongly influences and orientates indigenous waysof living, in both the ritual and secular sphere. Among the Arawakan groups of thenorthwest Amazon, political leadership is closely associated with the religious andritual system (Vidal 1993). Many of the great native leaders of the past were alsopowerful shamans and experts in facing and manipulating the occult world, and thesequalities were precisely those that supported their regional political power. Theimportance attributed to shamanism and ritual specialization to validate and strengthenleadership thus stemmed from the centrality of occult idioms of power in both dailyexistence and elite regional relationships.Initiation into shamanic practices, including witchcraft and sorcery, is complex andarduous and requires a significant personal motivation involving sexual abstinence, astrict dietary regime, and exhaustive physical endurance. These practices are intendedto bring out the special supernatural powers of the individual as shown in the capacityto rapidly memorize songs, prayers, and the names and formulas for medicines andpoisons, and in a physical ability to deal with the ingestion of psychotropic drugs. Suchinitiation involves five levels of shamanic specialization, knowledge, and practice thatcould be interpreted as a hierarchy of ritual knowledge and power to mediate betweenthe natural and the supernatural worlds (Vidal 1993:92-93) 2 These specializations,from the lower to the higher levels, are the biniji or the one who prepares medicineswith plants and water; the makbkana or the blower who cures by means blowing tobaccosmoke; the uyukali who cures by means of sucking the ill parts of the body; the sibu-nitei or the dreamer who cures by means of divination and dreams; and the hniwakali orthe one who knows more, or dreams more knowledge. Those of this ultimate leveldominate all the other specializations and also know numerous ancestral ritual songs"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"and prayers. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, great chiefs or captains wereshamans who possessed the hniwakali level of ritual power and specialization. Theseindigenous political leaders thus organized men in their sacred rituals and festivals, intheir economic activities and commerce, and in wars.'Shamanism is also associated with the continuing relationship that the Arawak-speaking groups established between the inepe miki nbwi (first ancestors) such asKuwe, Napiruli, Purdnaminali, and Dzdli, and the pjenawji (living elders). Pjenawi orpeinjli-nbwi are living adult individuals with great wisdom and important historical,mythical, ritual, and practical knowledge. Most of these elder men and women performthe sacred songs, chants, and prayer formulas for the curing of illnesses and otherspiritual needs, using tobacco and plants as remedies. Some of these remedies andcuring powers are known as pusanas, which are used as magic potions to gain sympathyor love, or to improve fishing and hunting success. These pusanas are thus comparableto the spell and charms used by the owners of talen magic, discussed below. However,as with talen, there are some who are devoted to the use of poisons and the otherresources of dark shamanism to harm others. These \"poison-owners\" (daneros andpitadores in Spanish) are men and women who use traditional shamanic and botanicalknowledge, including songs and prayers, to kill and injure. These pitadores are picturedas naked with their bodies painted black who wander at night through the forests ortowns to search out their enemies in order to eliminate them.Dark Shamans in the Politics of the VenezuelanAmazonThe role and impact of the Arawakan shamans in the local and regional politics of theVenezuelan Amazon derives in large part from three key characteristics of Arawakansocieties generally: the practice of exogamy and the way the resulting system ofmarriage alliances closely links to commercial activities and political alliances; thetradition of kiiwai and its role in local and regional political systems; and the adoptionof Arawakan cosmological and shamanic idioms by Criollo and European populations.Many Arawakan marriage systems are mainly focused on widening alliances in orderto incorporate other groups that are not part of their traditional affinal kin (Vidal 1993,1999). The system of marriage networks has an enormous potential for regionalalliances because it includes as kin a large number of population segments-both at aregional level in the category of siblingship (we / us) and in the spread of alliance"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"networks among affinal kin of diverse groups (they / others). These culturalcharacteristics have strongly influenced forms of leadership, the control and expansionof political and commercial alliances, and the emergence of interregional politicalalliances and multiethnic sociopolitical formations'Since the first European expedition to the Rio Negro basin, European men have oftenbeen enmeshed in this Arawakan style of marriage alliance through formal marriage toindigenous women or by informally taking them as concubines (Vidal 1993; Wright1981). This custom allowed Amerindians to treat these Europeans as their affinal kin(brothers-in-law) and commercial partners. According to Arawakan tradition, thestrongest alliances were those between two or more political groups that were alsoaffinal kin, or practitioners of kuwai and / or commercial partners as well. By theeighteenth century, these kinds of alliances produced ever-closer relationships betweenthe Bare, Warekena, and Baniwa groups as well as with their European / Criollocommercial partners and affinal kin. However, this also meant that Amerindianpopulations were more closely involved with the colonial regime, which eventuallyresulted in a dramatic loss of their political and economic autonomy, to the point ofoutright enslavement and political oppression.By 1850 many groups, such as the Warekena, Bare, Wakuenai, Baniwa, andTukanoans, found a powerful form of expressing their oppression through millenarianmovements whose ideas invaded both the festivities of Catholic saints and traditionalAmerindian ceremonies (Wright 1981). One of these millenarian movements was led byVenancio Camico (Hill and Wright 1988; Wright and Hill 1986), a Wakuenai shamanmarried to a Baniwa woman from the Aki River in the upper Guainia basin. Camico,also well known as the God of Mane, exercised a great authority among theAmerindians of the Guainia and Negro basins until his death in 1902. According toTavera Acosta (1927:146), Venancio Camico knew the healing properties of manyplants and made surprising cures among both the Amerindians and Criollos of theVenezuelan Amazon. Acosta also mentions that Camico spoke Portuguese, Spanish, andseveral indigenous languages of the region. A contemporary of Venancio Camico wasJoaquin Bolivar, a Bare shaman and political leader who was famed as a healer andexpert on plant magic. Although Bolivar was not a leader of millenarian movements hewas widely known and respected as a shaman to both indigenous peoples and the Criollopopulations of the Negro, Casiquiare, and Guainia rivers (Tavera Acosta 1927:146;Gonzalez Nino 1984:137; Henriquez 1994). His popularity among the Criollos,especially politicians, was due to his ability both to cure the victims of poisoning and to"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"restore the health of those who suffered the assault sorcery of the daneros and pitadores.Bolivar is also remembered as the founder in 1873 of the town of Santa Rosa ofAmanadona on the upper Rio Negro.It is evident, then, that during this period a significant number of nonAmerindians hadbecome involved with the shamanic traditions and rituals of the indigenous peoples ofthe Rio Negro (Wright 1981:169; Chernela 1993). The Criollo population, especially thepoliticians and those working for the government authorities, had adopted importantshamanic ideas deriving from the Arawakan groups. This process was not confined tothe Amazon region: most of the politicians of renowned national political parties inVenezuela had personal shamans and seers to heal and protect them from their enemiesand from supernatural forces. The ritual traditions of these shamans were influenced byboth Amerindian and AfroVenezuelan cultural traditions. For example, it is currentlypart of the popular oral tradition that Romulo Bethancourt, president of Venezuela from1958 to 1963 and also known as the \"father of the Venezuelan democracy,\" had apersonal shaman who had made his pipe into a magical amulet. It is believed that thisamulet and his shaman's powerful magic saved Bethan- court's life and protected himfrom injury during a bomb attack by leftist guerrillas. According to Martin (1983:64),these popular beliefs in Venezuela are part of an ideology based on the magical forcesof the political powers of national and regional authorities; this ideology forms part ofand is represented in the cult of Simon Bolivar, the Venezuelan liberator and foundingfather of the republic and the Gran Colombia (an argument recently further elaboratedby Taussig [1997]). In the later nineteenth century the infamous rubber barons whocontrolled the extraction of raw latex from forests in the Amazon regions of Peru,Colombia, and Venezuela, also utilized shamans and continued with the earlier traditionof marrying indigenous women or of having them as concubines (Iribertegui 1987:302-3).As a result, by the early twentieth century there were several widely renownedshamans in the Rio Negro region, such as Hilario Bolivar and Hilario Maroa. Bolivarwas a Bare Amerindian from Santa Rosa de Amanadona and the son of Joaquin Bolivar,mentioned above. He learned his shamanic knowledge and skills from his father, and hisfame as healer and powerful shaman soon extended to other areas of Venezuela andeven to neighboring countries. He was also a favorite of some of the rubber bar ons.Hilario Maroa (Maroita) was also a famous Bare shaman who lived in Santa Rosa deAmanadona, the town founded by Joaquin Bolivar. His fame as a powerful sorcerer notonly extended across Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru but also among local and regional"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"politicians, as well as medical doctors practicing in San Carlos de Rio Negro and othercities of the Venezuelan Amazon. In fact, Maroita was one of the first Amerindianshamans to share patients and to maintain professional relationships with Criollomedical doctors (Anduze 1973:167). Maroita and Hilario Bolivar were also famous forcountersorcery: curing people of the diseases, poisoning, and other forms of assaultsorcery caused by daneros and pitadores.Kanaima, Alleluia, and Millennial Prophecy in the GuyanaHighlandsAlthough the politics of Arawakan exogamy strongly mark interethnic relations in theRio Negro, exogamous forms of marriage alliance were also used extensivelyby theCariban peoples as well as Arawakans of the Guyana region, especially to formalliances with both blacks and whites. The key difference with the situation justdescribed for the Rio Negro was the disposition of the British, Dutch, and Frenchcolonial regimes. In Guyana evangelization was not the conquest of souls but an absent-minded afterthought (Riviere 1995), part of the efficient and beneficent administrationof a colony primarily interested in the plantations and mines of the coastal regions. Thehinterland remained a vista of exotic opportunity rather than threatening alterity, andthe evangelical effort was concomitantly relaxed. As a consequence of this relativedisinterest, especially because in earlier times the alliance of the native population hadbeen so critical (Whitehead 1988), the peoples of the hinterland were doublymarginalized. This led to repeated attempts by the groups of the interior to entice bothmissionaries and other possibly potent whites to settle among them.The unresponsiveness of the coastal colonial authority thus provoked native politicalpractice to attempt to find other ways of attaining the manufac - tures, both material andimmaterial, of the colonial world. On the one hand, new forms of shamanism, knowncollectively as alleluia, were invented as a means of offsetting the lack of missionaryactivity and finding a uniquely Amerindian route to Akwa (God). On the other hand, anumber of individual prophet-shamans emerged with visions of both the imminence ofearthly destruction and promises of material bounty. Among these prophets was also awhite man named Smith, in apparent imitation of the Mormonism of Joseph Smith, whoin the early 1840s announced his status as Amerindian savior.' Amerindian prophet-shamans were thus interstitial figures between the native and colonial world. Oftenbasing themselves in the au thority of \"tradition\" they proffered a vision of engagementwith a \"modernity\" that seemed to offer the spiritual and material bases for a new kind"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"of life in which ideas of redemption and material plenty figured strongly. As a resultthere were also examples of native visions of redemption and material advance thatcompeted with those of the white shamans, be they the false prophets like Smith or theofficial missionaries of colonial modernity. For example, the English missionaryWilliam Brett wrote: \"A Warau woman of singularly weird appearance was employed tospread a report that she had seen ... [in] Kamwatta ... the figure of a white man onhorseback, riding through the air, who promised to give money and other valuablepresents to her, and to all of her tribe who would assemble at that spot and dance fromearly morning to early afternoon\" (1868:250-51). Those already baptized wereexcluded, and despite the efforts of the missionaries to break up the gathering, whenthey arrived near the place and saw the preparations \"neither the men nor the womenwould give the least information.\" There are still similar prophet-shamans today, andPatamuna people remember a false prophet from the 1950s. She, like Smith, called oneveryone to join her there, saying that \"the Lord will not come if you keep planting\"(Whitehead 2002:154).However, there were also darker aspects to these shamanic visions that eerilyprefigure forms of millennial vision that became notorious in Guyana in more recenttimes. In the case of Smith, also know as the \"Impostor\" in the writing of his missionaryrivals, his call to come to a place in the highlands and await the arrival of a new age ofmaterial plenty was certainly answered and many hundreds went to his encampment. Infact the settlement there lasted over a year and eventually failed only due to a lack ofprovisions. But the would-be disciples of Smith had also been instructed to bring gunsand ammunition to the camp, and among some of the early recruits were certainlygroups known for their military prowess such as the Karinya and Akawaio. Smithearlier had also led physical attacks against the missions on the Demerara River, whichsuggests that more was intended than a simple watch for the advent of a new age.Contemporary with these events in the upper Mazaruni, in the Kukenaam Valley tothe west of Mount Roraima, was the emergence of an Amerindian shaman-prophet,Awacaipu. He founded a settlement, named Beckeranta, and called on all theAmerindians of Guyana to join with him there where they would learn how they couldbecome equals to the whites.' Awacaipu had been employed by Robert Schomburgk, andin Karl Appun's (1871: vol. 2, 257-64) account he suggests that this may have inspiredAwacaipu in his millennial quest for equality with the whites. As in other of thesemillenarian movements, great emphasis was put on continual singing and dancingaccompanied by cassiri beer and the renunciation of existing ma terial goods in the hope"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"of greater reward in the future. Like the prophet Smith, Awacaipu also handed outpieces of inscribed paper, apparently sheets from the Times that Schomburgk hadpreviously used for his plant specimens, as tokens and charms. Awacaipu evenpromised that his followers would get white skin, marry white women, and have gunsinstead of bows. However, what was notably new and sinister in the prophecy ofAwacaipu-and what grimly anticipates some \"modern\" cult activity-was the suggestionthat those who wished to have these benefits must first die: \"All who wanted to obtainthese advantages would have the opportunity between that night until the one after themorrow, but those who followed this course must die during one of these three nights, ateach other's hands. The night after the full moon the bodies of those killed would risefrom the dead and come down the slopes of Roraima to meet with their families, incolor and disposition they would become equal to the whites, and rule over the otherbrown men who had not undergone this ordeal\" (1871: vol. 2, 260).Appun continues that in order to encourage the others Awacaipu immediately clubbedtwo or three individuals standing next to him, who then fell into a large cassiricontainer. As their blood and brains spread into the liquid, Awacaipu drank and thenoffered some to the others. There then followed an \"orgie\" of killing, which lasted threenights and resulted in nearly four hundred dead. The survivors waited two weeks in vainfor the resurrection of the dead and their descent from Mount Roraima in newlyacquired white skins. On the fifth night after the appointed moment Awacaipu wasclubbed to death by the father of Wey-Torreh, who later narrated the events to Appun.Awacaipu claimed that his vision of how the Amerindians could gain equality wasreceived from the creator-being Makunaima, who is also central to the practice ofkanaima assault sorcery. Kanaima as a shamanic practice centers on the relationship ofexchange between the kanaima adept and Makunaima, creator of plants and animals,and this interrelation of affinity, cannibal predation, and exchange forms a triad in otherAmazonian cosmologies (see, e.g., Viveiros de Castro 19g2; Fausto 2001). Thisexchange of the mutilated human victims of kanaima assault for the beneficence ofMakunaima underlies the logic of kanaima ritual practice. This ritual practice enjoinsprecise mutilations of the victim's mouth and rectum in order to produce a lingering,painful, and inevitable death. The corpse is then sought out after burial in order to usethe maba (literally \"honey\") or juices of putrefaction produced by the rotting of thecadaver as a ritual \"food.\" Kanaimas thus emerge as another dark shamanic force activeunder the conditions of radical change induced by colonial contacts in the nineteenthcentury. The antiquity of kanaima is probably much greater than this, but it is first"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"consistently documented from the 182os onward. As such it is in part a re sponse to thecolonial modernities of mining, evangelism, and interior \"exploration.\" The pattern ofkillings by kanaimas in the later part of the nineteenth century thus shows that it wasexplicitly understood as a means to resist and reject the white man's materiality andspirituality, unlike alleluia and the other forms of shamanic prophecy discussed above.For example, Brett mentions that the \"clan of Capui\" had a \"blood-feud which hadbegun in the days of their fathers, but had then been lying dormant for many years,\" butthat the \"heathen sorcerers\" revived this feud because of their opposition to Capui andthe evangelical movement he played a central role in (1881:210-11). Capui's son, Philip\"the Evangelist,\" was therefore a repeated target for attacks through poison or kanaimamutilation, only escaping from one such attempt by repeatedly clubbing his attackerwith the butt of his gun and leaving him for dead. Apparently this event as well aslingering disabilities due to repeated poisoning \"affected the mind and conduct of Philipfor a time, and probably shortened his days\" (1881:211). Brett also narrates the killingby kanaimas of the brother of one of his recent converts: \"They found him on theground, with his back and neck bruised, but not bleeding,\" his tongue had been pierced.Brett held this to be \"in fulfillment of a threat of the heathen sorcerers, to `kanaima' indetail all the Acawoios and others who dared to attend Christian instruction\" (1868:269-70). The very substance of political engagement had thus become assimilated to theritual practice of dark shamans, whose assault sorcery became effective in a way thattraditional village leadership no longer was. Village leadership, like the military leaderswho were disarmed by the colonial administration, progressively succumbed to theevident power of the missionaries as potential interlocutors with the threatening worldof modernity, and the breaking of the shamanic rattles of village shamans became theovert and public token of that submission to colonial authority.Kanaima sorcery, secretive and panethnic, thus challenged colonial domination in amore diffuse way. The symbolic and ritual force of the relentless pursuit and violentmutilation of its victims became no less potent in the imagination of the colonialofficial than it was for Amerindians themselves, and this, as much as the tally ofpossible victims, accounts for the ambiguous acceptance of kanaima up to the presentday. As with the Arawakan shamans discussed earlier, overarching cosmologicalnotions, in this case Makunaima and the way in which local and regional politics wereembedded in ideas of ritual action, as well as the close intertwining of the spiritualnotions of the Amerindian and their colonizers, meant that certain forms of Amerindiansorcery and prophecy become politically significant. However, unlike the Rio Negroregion, which was part of a newly independent nation, Guyana was still a colony of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Britain in the nineteenth century, and these kinds of local politics had less visibility onthe \"national\" politi cal scene. The colonial political agenda was largely set by themetropolis and its interests, and the forms of political patronage were originated inLondon not Georgetown. Nonetheless, as we shall see, with independence from Britainlocal forms of political culture have become significant on the national, eveninternational, stage.As in the case of the Rio Negro dark shamans, kanaima is not the only form of assaultsorcery that might be practiced. At a more mundane level talen (blowing) magic can beused to harm as well as charm and cure others. The kind of injury that might beachieved through talen is certainly far less than that involved in kanaima assault, but itillustrates that assault sorcery is possible even for those without shamanic initiation.Talen magic tends to be the exclusive property of families and is handed down withinthe familial unit. Through it one might create charms (bin a, murang) that can influenceothers, particularly to limit them in the harm that might be done to an individual one.However, the very accessibility of these kinds of magical forces only serves to enhancethe cultural force of the practice of deadly assault, such as kanaima.Arawakan Shamans and Politics since 1958With the democratic elections after the fall of Perez Jimenez's dictatorship in 1958many political parties sought the votes of the indigenous peoples of Venezuela's state ofAmazonas, including the three main national political parties: Accion Democratica,Union Republicana Democratica, and even Copei, the party of Catholicism. This partypolitical contest gave rise to the contradictory images and ideas of Amerindians thathave persisted in political culture right up to the last elections in 1998 and 2000. On theone hand, Amerindians are seen as naive and ignorant persons whose votes can bebought in exchange for money, food, electric plants, gasoline, and other basic articles ofconsumption. On the other hand, \"Indians\" are considered unreliable and incapable ofpolitical loyalty, because they are thought to whimsically change their opinionsaccording to passing political circumstance and short-term economic interests, althoughthis is not unlike how politicians view voters everywhere.By 1958-1959 the Rio Negro shamans were known for their abilities in preparing bothlove potions and poisons, including substances that produced such illnesses as edbri(pica-pica in Spanish), a fatal affliction that causes great pain and even death. However,precisely reflecting the ambivalence of shamanic power, such shamans were also knownfor being able to cure edbri in both Criollos and Amerindians, even if medical prognosis"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"had already condemned them to die. Many persons so afflicted went to see Maroita,mentioned above (Anduze 1973:82). Arawakan shamans also possess other abilities thatare highly valued by Amerindians and Criollos alike, particularly divination, potions,and chants to obtain and hold onto political appointments or other employment in thepublic administration of local and state governments.Estado Amazonas (state of Amazonas) of Venezuela was the Territorio FederalAmazonas (Amazon Federal Territory) until 1992 when the National Congress passed alaw transforming it in the twenty-second state in the country. Territorio FederalAmazonas had a governor appointed by the president of the republic and was politicallydivided in four districts (Atures, Atabapo, Casiquiare, and Rio Negro), each of whichwas ruled by a prefect directly appointed by the governor. Until 2000 the governor'sposition was occupied by Criollo politicians, mainly party loyalists from AccionDemocratica, Union Republicana Democratica, and Copei. From 1958 until 1970, theprefect's positions were also in the hands of Criollos who came from other regions ofVenezuela, or they were mestizos born in different cities of the Territorio FederalAmazonas.The 1970S were a crucial period for the Amerindian populations of Venezuela,particularly in Territorio Federal Amazonas. During the presidency of Rafael Caldera(1969-1973) a new expansion of socioeconomic and political frontiers into indigenouslands began, particularly in the region south of the Orinoco River. This neocolonialprocess was aptly dubbed La con- quista del sur and the national government began anaggressive development policy geared toward the integration of indigenous peoples andterritories into the national economy and culture (Arvelo-Jimenez and Scorza 1974;Arvelo-Jimenez 1g8o). The idea behind this \"conquest of the south\" was that theAmazon region was underdeveloped due to the economic backwardness and sparsesettlement patterns of indigenous people, and the whole region was represented as beingpractically \"uninhabited\"; indeed, according to the plan Territorio Federal Amazonasneeded new immigrants with new economic development projects to properly occupyand develop it. This national policy opened up the Rio Negro region and its surroundingareas to the invasion of a number of developers, who then began to occupy key locationsin the Guainia, Casiquiare, and Negro basins.At the same time the Declaration of Barbados in 1971, recognizing indigenous rightsand signed by Venezuela, had a great influence in the reorientation of the officialpolitics of national and regional governments toward a more active participation byindigenous peoples in national political life. In 1972 various regional indigenous"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"federations and the Confedera- cion Indigena de Venezuela were founded. Severalindigenous leaders were chosen to occupy important positions inside theseorganizations, including the Federation Indigena de Amazonas (FiA). Although the ideaof reorganizing the existing national indigenous movement through these externalorganizations did not originate with indigenous peoples, many Amerindian leaders andtheir communities saw in the federations a political alternative to participation in the\"democratic\" Venezuelan political system.The conquest of the south thus brought an invasion of new settlers as well as publicand private institutions into Territorio Federal Amazonas, which in turn provokedvarious responses among the Amerindian population, including a reorganization of theindigenous groups in the defense of their lands; the employment of many natives assalaried, dependent workers for the national and regional governments; and anincreasing participation by indigenous individuals and groups in the major politicalparties. However, indigenous participation in the official political parties was offset bythe growing importance that indigenous federations were winning among localcommunities and ethnic groups, primarily as legitimate alternatives to the usual meansof interaction with the regional and national government authorities. Thesedevelopments also increased the popularity, among both Amerindians and Criollos, ofthe Arawakan shamans, because their occult powers enabled individuals to get andmaintain jobs in public administration, to obtain financial credits from nationalagencies, to win or lose national election campaigns, and to predict the future in orderto know which party and candidate were going to win the presidency of the country.Among these shamans were such individuals as Carlos Menare (Warekena), Lino Yuri-yuri (Warekena), Pancho Guaca (Kurripako), Rosendo Da Silva (Bare), Horacio Camico(Baniwa), and Mariana Evaristo.This shamanic intervention in the political process created an opportunity for manyAmerindians to achieve important political positions in the local and regionalgovernments, as, for example, with Hernan Camico, a member of Copei. Camico wasappointed as the first Amerindian prefect of Maroa from 1970 to 1973. During hisperiod in the prefecture of Maroa, Camico, grandnephew of Venancio Camico, thefamous shaman-prophet of this region, hired many indigenous people of the area asworkers. He also made Baniwa, his maternal tongue, the official language for the dailyaffairs of the prefecture. However, from 1975 until the mid-1g8os various sociopoliticalchanges occurred in Territorio Federal Amazonas. Changes in the national government(from Acci6n Democratica to Copei and vice versa), competition among political"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"parties to control Amerindian votes, and confrontations among indigenous leaders overcontrol of the FIA generated many divisions among the region's ethnic groups. It shouldbe noted, however, that this situation also helped to strengthen Amerindian politicalmovements and allow new forms of leadership and political participation for Amazon'sindigenous peoples to emerge (Vidal 1977).In this same period Bernabe Gutierrez began to emerge on the political scene inTerritorio Federal Amazonas as a national and regional leader of the Acci6nDemocratica political party. A Criollo, Gutierrez was born in Caicara del Orinoco(Bolivar State), but lived since his infancy in Territorio Federal Amazonas, first in theWarekena township of Guzman Blanco and then in Puerto Ayacucho. Due to thesebonds with the region, Gutierrez became a key figure in the electoral campaigns there.His success in these campaigns allowed him to consolidate his position of growinginfluence on the central committee of Acci6n Democratica, both in Caracas and inPuerto Ayacucho, as well as to make his support indispensable for those individualswho aspired to obtain a position and / or a permanent job in the public administration ofTerritorio Federal Amazonas. Officially and politically Pinerua Ordaz, one of thefounders of Acci6n Democratica, and other prominent members of the Acci6nDemocratica central committee, backed up Bernabe Gutierrez's political power.However, in the minds of people in Amazonas his political power was also based on hisconsultations with dark shamans from the Rio Negro. Many of his party allies andfriends made reference to Gutierrez's visits to Rio Negro to consult with dark shamans,and they predicted that Acci6n Democratica would win the next national elections andthat Gutierrez would be governor. Indeed, after the elections of 1983, won by Acci6nDemocratica party, Bernabe Gutierrez was appointed governor of the Territorio FederalAmazonas.During his governorship, Bernabe Guttierrez appointed Enrique Zandalio Camico, aBaniwa, as prefect of Maroa. Zandalio, after just a few months in office, began to drawsharp criticism due to his negligence and abuse of official powers and to the corruptionin the handling of the resources of the prefecture. As a result, complaints againstZandalio were made to Governor Gutierrez. He was asked to pay a visit to Gutierrez inorder to explain his behavior, but before traveling to Puerto Ayacucho, Zandalio went tosee Horacio Camico, a famous Baniwa shaman. When Zandalio returned from hismeeting with Gutierrez in Puerto Ayacucho to the prefecture in Maroa, he told thepeople that he had been reaffirmed in his office by Gutierrez. A while later he began tothreaten his political enemies with the use of assault sorcery. However, Bernabe"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Gutierrez himself was then also accused of corruption and abuse of power, and as thepresidency of Jaime Lusinchi was coming to an end new election campaigns were inprogress by 1988.The electoral campaign of Gutierrez and his associates was characterized by fulsomepromises of positions in the public administration, by the distribution of gifts andmoney to voters, and by the claim that many sorcerers were predicting that the Acci6nDemocratica candidate for the presidency of the republic, Carlos Andres Perez(formerly president of Venezuela, 1974-1979) would win for certain. Indeed, CarlosAndres Perez did win the presidency of Venezuela, and that same year he passed Decree625 wherein the Guainia-Negro basin was declared to be a tourist area, giving freeaccess to all \"visitors.\" The region thus was opened up to development through variousinfrastructural projects and the encouragement of national and international tourism.Legally this also meant that the region lost its status as an \"indigenous zone,\" which hadgiven it special protection. As a result, the indigenous peoples lost their ancestral rightsto their territories, and invasions of Amerindian lands were encouraged throughout thearea.Also in 1988 the famous Hohodene (Baniwa do Isana) shaman Manuel (Mandu) DaSilva arrived at the Rio Guainia. Part of the reason for his visit was to seek the aid ofthe resident Guahibo dark shamans in his struggle against the sorcerer Emi, who made aseries of shamanic assaults against Mandu's family. At this time Mandu was the chief-leader (capitao) of the town of Uapui Cachoeira (\"center or navel of the world\" for theArawakan peoples), located on the Rio Aiary, an important branch of the Rio Negro.Mandu was considered by the Arawakan groups of Venezuela as one of the trulypowerful shamans of the Negro and Guainia basins. During his visits to different places,Mandu received many people of different ethnic groups who made requests to consultwith him. This alerted him to the fact that many individuals were using the teachings ofkuwai and the wisdom of their ancestors in malicious and incorrect ways. Mandu wentto Marna and other towns to speak with people, especially the old men and women, towarn them about the negative consequences of using poisons, chants and prayers, andsupernatural powers with selfish purposes or to harm others - a subject on which he hadtragically personal experience. Mandu gave the names of numerous men and womenwho had used poisons to kill their enemies or used assault sorcery to harm and waste thelife of many people. He publicly recalled that these were the errors that had caused thedestruction of the world in past times and the disappearance of the \"ancients\" who hadonce populated the earth. He pointed out that by using assault sorcery they themselves"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"were going to be ruined and that they would have nothing but bad luck. Whole familieshad been devastated by shamanic attacks and the Criollos were then able to dominatethe Amerindians as slaves and take their lands from them. Mandu nonethelessemphasized that it was necessary to continue with the teachings and healthy customs ofthe ancestors because these traditions were the guarantee of cultural survival andcontinuity for all the followers of kuwai. Needless to say, the warnings and advice ofMandu had a slow but significant impact on the political and cultural life of theindigenous peoples of the Rio Guainia.In 1995 the former Electoral Supreme Council of Venezuela opened the national andregional campaign for the election of governors, mayors, and municipal counselors,each of which have a term of three years. In the gubernatorial campaign, BernabeGutierrez ran as the candidate for Accion Democratica and Nelson Silva for Copei. Thecandidates for mayor and mu nicipal counselors included a number of candidates fromthe Criollo, Amerindian, and Mestizo populations. In the municipality of Guainia,mayorial candidates included Antonio Briceno Querebi for Copei and Angel AnguloBriceno for a joint ticket of Accion Democratica and Convergencia (a small politicalparty created by Rafael Caldera in 1993). Briceno Querebi is a merchant of Baniwadescent, and Angel Angulo is his nephew. In his electoral campaign Gutierrez deployedall the economic and political influence of his party. On a trip to San Carlos de RioNegro and Maroa he visited two Bare and Tariana shamans, who told him he was goingto be the first governor elected by popular votes. Indeed, the winners were BernabeGutierrez as governor, and Antonio Briceno Querebi as the first mayor of Guainia.However, in December 1996 the Supreme Court of justice annulled the regional lawregulating the election and ordered that, after a lapse of three months from the date ofthat decision, the Legislative Assembly, together with nowGovernor Gutierrez, shoulddictate and promulgate a new law, and then devise a new electoral process to choose themayors and other municipal authorities. In the event the result was the ratification ofthe already elected mayors and municipal counselors.In 1995 indigenous leaders from Amazonas were proposed for political andgovernmental positions at the local, regional, and national levels, and today they occupypositions in the municipalities, constituent assembly, governments, legislativeassembly, and the national assembly. With the exception of the municipality of Atures,where the state capital, Puerto Ayacucho, is located, in Amazonas most of thecandidates for government positions were Amerindians. However, Gutierrez and Acci6nDemocratica remained in firm control of two of the municipalities-Alto Orinoco and"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Rio Negro. Gutierrez again won the elections of 1998, but this time he did not havecentral government support because the new president, Hugo Chavez, considered him acorrupt politician. Further, in February 1999, Chavez promulgated a decree that ordereda national referendum so that \"the people\" (or \"the sovereign people of Venezuela,\" asChavez terms it) could decide whether or not to name a constituent national assemblythat would create a new national constitution. In that decree, Chavez ordered that theindigenous peoples of Venezuela would name three representatives before theconstituent assembly, who could be chosen by themselves in their own traditional ways.Guillermo Guevara (Hiwi or Guahibo), Noeli Pocaterra (Wayuu), and Jesus Gonzalez(Pem6n) were chosen. Two additional Amerindian representatives to the assembly werechosen in national elections: Atala Uriana (Wayuu), representing the state of Zulia, andLiborio Guaruya for the state of Amazonas.In the elections of July 2000 the candidates for governor were Bernabe Gutierrez,Liborio Guaruya, Nelson Silva, and Freddy Borro. Gutierrez was supported by AccionDemocratica, Copei, URA (a party of the evangelical churches), Proyecto Venezuela (aright-wing movement), and UPINA (a movement of the extreme right wing). Gutierrez'stheme for the electoral campaign was that he was the \"governor of the prosperity,\"while Guaruya promised a \"true change with Amazonian feeling\" and was supported byvarious left-wing parties such as PPT, PUAMA, Pcv, Bandera Roja (a movement of theextreme left wing), MuPI, and ORPIA. Nelson Silva was the official candidate ofpresident Chavez's party, MvR, together with MAS, PUPA, and other regional and localorganizations. Borro was supported by the democratic left and by Francisco AriasCardenas's followers (another of the leaders of the abortive coup d'etat of 1992, andformer candidate to the presidency of Venezuela in 1998). With the exception of themunicipality of Atures, where all the candidates were Criollos, all the other candidatesfor mayors and counselors were Amerindians or Mestizos. Nonetheless, in some areasseveral indigenous leaders became candidates on their own initiative because of thesupport of sympathetic local people, although they received little back-up from themain political parties or organized movements. For the municipality of Maroa thecandidates were Angel Angulo Briceno (Accion Democratica, Copei, URA, oPINA),Antonio Briceno Querebi (MAS, PUPA, MvR), and Valdemar Reveron (PPT, PUAMA,MuPI).These elections were one of the most aggressive and hard-fought in the history of theVenezuelan Amazon, not least because most of the electorate was against Gutierrez butknew that he could use his official position and even outright fraud to win. Indeed,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Gutierrez used all the power and economic resources at his disposal as governor of thestate to ensure his victory. He also appealed for the support of several Arawakanshamans from the Negro and Guainia rivers as well as shamans from other areas andethnic groups. Gutierrez also dedicated his electoral campaign to debate with Silva,whom he considered his only \"real\" opponent, and totally ignored Guaruya as acontending candidate. Silva based his campaign on his previous struggles againstBernabe Gutierrez and his corrupt government, but in that strategy he counted onPresident Chavez's support. However, President Chavez never visited the state ofAmazonas to give Silva his support.Guaruya, besides emphasizing the \"outsider\" status of Gutierrez and his provenadministrative corruption in the government, centered his electoral campaign on theindigenous population, whom he considered the single largest voting block in theelectorate, and which therefore held the balance of power in the coming elections. Healso highlighted his political connections with the charismatic President Chavez.However, Guaruya's main electoral strategy was based on his own indigenousness-hisidentity as a Baniwa Amerindian-and he therefore characterized his confrontation withGutierrez as a struggle between two different cultures-albeit coexisting in an indigenousregion. He also appealed for the support of the Amerindian shamans and other ritualspecialists as representatives of the powerful forces of traditional wisdom. Guaruya isquoted in a press interview saying, \"Criollos are men and women that are in passing\"(Morillo Ramos 2000), meaning that he considers the majority of Criollos as not havingstrong bonds or roots in the region or with indigenous peoples.For the indigenous peoples of Rio Negro, Guaruya's call for unity among Amerindiansas a strategy to gain political power had a strong impact. Also, many Arawakanshamans and ritual specialists of the area remembered the advice given to them in 1989by Mandu Da Silva on the abuse of occult powers, and they began to have dreams andvisions that Gutierrez would finally be defeated in the elections. During his electoralcampaign, Gutierrez went to San Carlos de Rio Negro to visit a famous Bare sorcerer,Nieve Cabucuare, who informed him that she had seen in a dream that he would lose theelections, and that all the indigenous groups of Rio Negro knew this. Cabucuare alsomentioned that a period of big changes was coming for all the people in the VenezuelanAmazon. These visions meant that some local candidates, such as Antonio Briceno,went downriver to Sao Gabriel das Cachoeiras in Brazil to see the Baniwa and Bareshamans there with the purpose of guaranteeing their own reelection.As it turned out Briceno was reelected mayor of Marna again, and Gutierrez was"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"reelected governor, apparently beating Guaruya by just 221 votes. However, the dayfollowing the elections Guaruya denounced Gutierrez and Accion Democratica forelectoral fraud, and he invited in the Consejo Nacional Electoral to recount the votesand possibly repeat the elections (Cortez 2000). Gutierrez immediately denied fraud,but by mid-September the Consejo Nacional Electoral and the Tribunal Supremo deJusticia had found enough evidence to annul several voting records and to order that thevotes be recounted in some places. At the end of September both candidates traveled toCaracas, accompanied by some of their followers, in order to present their cases beforethe Tribunal Supremo de Justicia (Perez Rodriguez 2000).While the judges heard the allegations of each of the candidates, outside the doors ofthe tribunal two different indigenous factions faced off in a ritual duel. On the one handthere were Amerindians who supported Gutierrez and wanted him to continue ingovernment. They danced and sang a traditional ceremony called the Dance of theDeath, which is used to exhume the bones of deceased relatives. On the other hand,those who supported Guaruya also performed a traditional ceremony that in the Piaroalanguage is called Warime. This is usually performed after a shaman has a vision and isused to reestablish the balance between man and nature, be tween the mythical worldand the real world. The purpose of this Warime was to reestablish the political order bya repeat of the elections so that Guaruya could become governor of Amazonas. A weeklater, the Consejo Nacional Electoral decided that Guaruya had won by seventy-ninevotes, and they ordered that Guaruya be proclaimed as the new governor of TerritorioFederal Amazonas.The popular rumor was that there was not anything as powerful as the magic of thesorcerers of Rio Negro, the \"relatives\" of Guaruya,' and for that reason BernabeGutierrez had lost the elections, especially since the dark shamans of the area hadabandoned him to support the Amerindian Guaruya. However, by December theTribunal Supremo de Justicia ordered the Consejo Nacional Electoral to repeat theelections in those areas where it had been demonstrated that serious doubts existed forthe results obtained in the last elections of July. Consequently a provisional governorwas named (the president of the Legislative Council) and they proceeded to rerun theelectoral campaign in five different areas of the state. On February 11, 2001, theelections were repeated and this time the winner, without any doubt, was LiborioGuaruya.Guaruya was proclaimed the new governor, and he is the first Amerindian ever to beelected by popular voting in Venezuela. However, perhaps the most important aspect of"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"these political events was that his electoral victory vividly demonstrated the importanceof the occult powers of the famed Rio Negro shamans. As it is said in the Criollopolitical world, \"the sorcerers they fly, they fly,\" meaning that one has to respectpowerful sorcerers and shamans if one wants to remain safe and in good health.Occult Politics in Guyana since IndependenceThe influence of Amerindian shamanisms on the politics of Guyana has not proved tobe as widespread or as consistent as in Rio Negro. Two factors may account for this.First, the direct involvement of Amerindian people in the political system of Guyana isrelatively recent-Guyana having only become an independent country in 1966.Moreover, demographically the Amerindian population of Guyana is a far smallersegment than that in the Rio Negro region, so that even where the Amerindianpopulation becomes politically engaged by national politics it is still marginal to thecoastal areas where the majority of the population lives 8 Second, the ethniccomposition of Guyana itself means that there are already traditions of occult powerfirmly in place, in particular obeah, deriving from Africa. The emancipation of blackslaves in the mid-nineteenth century led the British authorities to recruit a vast numberof indentured laborers from the Indian subcontinent in order to undermine the market infree black labor. Not only did this set up an enduring basis for conflict between the freeblacks and indentured Asians, it also ensured the marginalization of the Amerindianpopulation which, insofar as it had acted as a bush police against the plantation slaves,was seen as a tool of the colonial authorities. In short, there was not the same social andeconomic basis for intermarriage between the Amerindian and non-Amerindianpopulation in Guyana as there was in the Rio Negro region of Venezuela.Sorcery, then, is not used to advance and control the processes of political electionand brokering per se, but does operate in a wider framework to mark off and delimit thescope of Amerindian political action in other spheres. In particular the Amerindianpractice of kanaima has created a cultural field of external imagination, as well asinternal ritual practice, in which the dark shamanism of the Amerindians provides aform of protection from the depredations of both the state and rapacious individuals,such as the diamond and gold miners. This theme is directly present in the novelCanaima, written by Romulo Gallegos in the 193os. Significantly enough for a politicalsystem already inured to the reality of spirit forces, Gallegos went on to briefly holdpresidential office at the end of World War II and his novel became required reading inVenezuelan schools. At the same time it must be recognized that the practice of"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"African-derived shamanism in the form of obeah is not culturally sealed off from otheroccult or spiritual practice, so that there is a synergy between the cultural significanceof kanaima, obeah, and other ideas of the priority and possibility of magical action.Thus, while in Guyana there has not been the kind of intense and sustained social andcultural interchanges that produced the situation in Rio Negro, there is nonetheless awidespread appreciation of the potential of Amerindian magic for curing purposes, justas Amerindians will also make use of obeah or, in the Brazilian border regions, therelated complexes of santeria and candomble. There is an eminent pragmatism in theway in which people will use whatever system or form of magical action that seems tooffer the best hope for effective results (Riley 2000). In this way, just as the possibilityof kanaima acts to empower Amerindians generally in the relationship with outsiders,so too the practice of obeah by national political leaders can be seen as culturallysignificant beyond those who may share a preeminent belief in the effectiveness ofobeah magic.In just this way the political power of Linden Forbes Burnham, president of Guyanaduring the 1g6os and 1970s, was augmented by his association with obeah practice.Although much of what passes for fact on this matter may be nothing more thanmythology, that in a sense is the very meaning of the association of political power withmagical potential. Moreover, the popular legacy of Burnham still very much alludes tothis aspect of his political regime. According to a Letter from Emile Mervin in theStabroek News on July 12, 2001: \"Burnham's personal status was supremely elevatedthroughout the land. They [the People's National Congress] had developed a fear and asense of awe among many people. Some people still claim he had a `presence,' whateverthat means. But it was the apparent high, worshipful esteem, he harbored from peoplethat made him feel it was okay to push ahead with his initiatives knowing, if he failed,he was answerable to no one, and could readily blame others.\" Burnham certainly hadan obeah adviser, Mother Monica, and even appears to have acted out his obeah on theinternational stage. Once on a visit to London for a Commonwealth heads meeting hesent for one-hundred-year-old Chinese eggs, which he solemnly devoured, averring thatthey would increase his potency. Another time, when out shooting ducks on the AbaryRiver with Shridath Ramphal, secretary general to the Commonwealth, he would havethe ducks brought to him, stick his hand up their backsides and pull out any eggs hemight find, and proceed to drink them raw-again claiming they enhanced his power.Burnham was certainly credited with strange powers, and noticeably neither of thehouses he once inhabited, his country house at Belfield as well as the presidential"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"residence in Vlissingen Road, was inhabited after he died-it was said that the obeah wastoo strong. The presidential residence is now Castellani House, home of the nationalcollection of art, and Belfield is a storage place for the reconditioned car importbusiness, but is still treated with some fear as a site where jumbies (spirits) might beencountered.Even in death Burnham seemed mysteriously powerful and the bizarre happeningssurrounding his eventual burial had much to do with these occult connections. His bodywas flown to Moscow for embalming, as was done with Lenin. But some months later,when the body eventually came back to Guyana, it was poorly embalmed because it hadalready become too decomposed for proper embalming. As a result Burnham waseventually buried above the ground at the Seven Ponds Monument in Georgetown.Some Guyanese believe that all subsequent national troubles flow from this above-ground burial. Certainly the mausoleum structure and his tomb are the site for thepractice of animal sacrifice, indicating a continuing interest in the residual supernaturalpowers of the dead president. It is also believed that a monument to Cuffy (the slavewho led a famous rebellion in the Berbice River in 1763) with Burnham's face carved atthe back of Cuffy's head is a sacred object with powers. The monument, created by theBerbician artist Philip Moore, is even now not without controversy, as its detractors-from all ethnic groups-accuse Moore, an ardent spiritualist, of invoking Africanwitchcraft in his work. Moore admits to addressing elements of African animism butobviously resists the suggestion that his work glorifies AfroGuyanese obeah.9This addition of Burnham to the monument of Cuffy and his general as sociation with\"science\" (obeah) suggests also a strong ethnic dimension to the use of obeah. Indeed, inthe riots that followed the 1997 elections, some of the People's National Congress (PNc)stalwarts were said to be doing \"science\" on the effigy of an Indo-Guyaneseanthropologist, Janette Forte. Certainly it is widely held that those who were opposed toBurnham, or who had crossed him in some particular way, were subject to obeah assaultsorcery. Victims of such sorcery are known as \"Burnham's people,\" or in Guyanese -English (creole) \"Burnham people them.\" They can be encountered quite often inGeorgetown, and one is advised to \"not worry after them\" because they have beenderanged by assault sorcery and are therefore not really harmful or in need of physicalhelp. Typically, such individuals are extremely emaciated Indo-Guyanese women andmen who walk the streets of Georgetown at night asking for very small, almostworthless sums of money-no more than GY$io or $20 (USio or 200) -so thatconventional begging seems not to be the motive here. Although there are others who do"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"not fit this ethnic / gender profile, such as an older Afro-Guyanese man familiar on themain streets of Georgetown, they are still called Burnham's people. Such individuals arewidely believed to have been deranged and damaged by obeah either ordered byBurnham or personally \"sent\" by Burnham because they were dangerous elements in theopposition or had somehow crossed him or his government. Not unlike other assaults bydark shamans, the actual victim did not have to be the offender but could be a relative.One taxi driver who regularly sees such people in the course of his work even went sofar as to say that Viola Burnham (his widow) could call these people to her to do work ifshe wanted, and that they were clothed and fed by sympathetic Burnhamites or byemployees of his estate. It is also said that \"they can't remember their family, even ifthey get them\" or \"they na mess with them once they be deranged.\"In general terms many (if not most) people in Guyana believe that Burnham musthave invoked some sort of occult force or he would not have been able to bind people tohim as he did. Moreover, obeah was not the only occult force politically associated withthe Burnham regime. For example, a cult called the House of Israel was established byan American fugitive-David Hill, also known as Rabbi Edward Washington-who arrivedin Guyana in 1972. The cult was nominally influenced by Judaism but was essentially ablack supremacist movement. The House of Israel claimed a membership of over eightthousand and had a daily radio program in which it preached that Africans were theoriginal Hebrews and needed to prepare for an imminent racial war. Opponents of theBurnham government claimed that the House of Israel constituted a private army forGuyana's ruling party, the PNC. Certainly, members of the House of Israel were aneffective and brutal force in street demonstrations. During one antigovern mentdemonstration, a House of Israel member murdered a Roman Catholic priest, FatherDarke, who was on the staff of a religious opposition newspaper, the Catholic Standard.The House of Israel also engaged in strikebreaking activities and disruptions of publicmeetings on behalf of the PNC. In short, House of Israel members apparently acted withimpunity (if not overt immunity) during the PNC government of Forbes Burnham.10There was a similar association to that of Rabbi Washington and Forbes Burnham thatfurther underlines the nature of the PNC \"occult\" regime: the Reverend Jim Jones,leader of the People's Temple. These connections, however, were not mere \"spiritual\" or\"inspirational\" associations but, quite evidently, ones that had pragmatic materialbenefits in the politics of postcolonial Guyana, especially on the international stage.During the 1970s, Guyana was very isolated politically as it moved further to its ownbrand of socialism as a \"co-operative republic.\" It should not be forgotten, then, that"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Jim Jones declared himself both shaman and socialist: \"I come with the black hair of araven, I come as God Socialist\" (quoted in Reiterman 1982: 56). But, as Reitermansuggests, the raven is a shamanic familiar in the Western imagination: \"Prophet! Said I,`thing of evil! -Prophet still, if bird or devil!' (Edgar Allan Poe, The Raven)\" (56).The Temple thus distinguished itself from other cults of the times by its overtlypolitical, leftist ambitions. Cult members had won a surprising degree of politicalacceptance among socialists and radicals in the United States, and they translated thatradical socialism into a convincing program of development and human investment forthe purposes of winning the agreement of the Guyanese government for the relocationof the group to Port Kaituma in the northwest district. In particular Emerson Mitchell,under the orders of Ptolemy Reid, the deputy prime minister, met with Jones personallyat the proposed Temple location in late 1973. There were a number of advantages thatthe Guyanese government saw in letting Jones relocate his group to Kaituma: foremostwas its possible role in the development of the interior region, but also the mere fact ofits presence in this border area meant that it was unlikely that Venezuela, with anoutstanding claim to this Guyanese territory, would choose to provoke any incidentsthat might involve \"endangering\" Americans.However, as it transpired it was not the Venezuelans who were endangering U.S.citizens but Jones himself. Allegations of atrocities by commune leaders and chargesthat the commune was holding people against their will led a U.S. congressman, LeoRyan, to go to \"Jonestown\" at Kaituma to investigate the allegations of abuse. Fearingthat Congressman Ryan's report on the commune would bring unwanted publicity andrestrictions on his operations, Jones had the congressman shot as he was boarding anairplane to return to Georgetown. The U.S. government immediately asked Guyana tosend in its army, but before the Guyana Defense Force could reach Jonestown, Joneshad coerced and cajoled 913 members of the commune, already habituated by repeated\"suicide drills,\" to commit murder and suicide in what he called a \"White Night.\" Joneskilled himself with a bullet to the head.Certainly there is no direct historical connection between the end of this dark shamanin a White Night and that of Awacaipu at Beckeranta, the Land of the White, but bothmovements share the cultic, messianic hope for material improvement through spiritualredemption. Just as Awacaipu played off the relative deprivations of the interiorAmerindians with regard to the colonial economy, so, too, were the social origins ofPeoples' Temple members, many of whom were poor blacks from California. At thegeographical and social margins of the Guyanese coastal world dark shamanic prophecy"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"thus emerged with eerily consistent consequences over a space of 130 years.ConclusionObeah, like voudoun and other spiritual systems deriving from the African slaveexperience, have always had strong political associations (Suttles 1971), including,first, as social structures and cultural idioms within which resistance to the colonialmastery might be covertly organized and expressed; second, as an idiom, with thedecline of slavery, for the struggle against colonialism; and finally, as a popular andwidely understood expression of power and potency with the advent of postcolonialgovernment. In short, the political has become firmly entwined in broader cultures ofspiritual significance. Western forms of government and politics are, of course, no lessshaped by the politics of a \"Christian\" experience, so the key issue is not thatshamanism and other occult forms are part of postcolonial politics but rather to whatextent the control of the darker forces is particularly relevant to the exercise of power.If the state is indeed the Leviathan of the Hobbesian political imagination, then itsmonstrous appetites can only be satisfied by a continual sacrifice of the individual tothe body-politic. In this frame of reference Aztec human sacrifice is equivalent to theEuropean theater of public punishment and execution. Is it any wonder, then, that theexercise of state power should so often carry with it the association of a ravenous andall-consuming deity whose priest-shamans (politicians) mysteriously produce andcontrol the forms of propitiation? If the Western political imagination can invent \"theprince\" of Machiavelli, then how very appropriate it becomes to view the politicalprocess as the individualized conflicts of the powerful, conducted by whatever meansnecessary. In this sense the conjunction of the occult and political power in Guyana andVenezuela might culturally confound us, but the politics of individualized assassinationand defamation are hardly novel in the West either.Amerindian shamanism has always the ambiguous aspect of being a force for bothgood and evil-a force that is very much in the hands of the individual shaman to control.This in itself would tend to promote a close association of power and individuality thatplays easily into the kinds of postcolonial political contexts that have been outlinedhere. More broadly this allows us to appreciate aspects of shamanism's darker side thatare missing in accounts of personal curing and particular allegations of sorcery. Tosome extent anthropology in Amazonia has already recognized that social and politicaldimension of witchcraft (Riviere 1970), but only recently has this recognition come tofocus on the intimate connections between shamanic ideas and the forms of political"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"action, as in the case of kanaima (Butt-Colson 2001; Whitehead 2001). Equally, whilegeneral questions about how shamanism, as a typically personalized andnoninstitutional form of spiritual action, might have been harnessed to or suppressed bythe state (Thomas and Humphrey 1996) have been considered in a number of globalcontexts, the way in which occult forms of ritual action become the accepted processesof the state has not yet received the attention it deserves. This need for closer attentionto the shamanic aspects of state power and authority does not arise just because ithappens to be an interesting issue of political science, but rather because it is a keycultural difference between ourselves, who supposedly are practitioners of a rationaland spiritually neutral political process, and others, who are seen as immured in asuperstitious past. Moreover, unlike some commentators on this theme (Comaroff andComaroff 1993,1998; Coronil 1997; Taussig 1997), we do not just see the role of thespirit world as providing a \"local\" idiom for the work of a transnational or \"global\"capitalist ideologybut rather as a unique idiom and understanding of power that is partof an original and independent postcolonial political condition, as Moore and Sanders(2001) suggest for contemporary African contexts. It is this use of dark shamanism as alegitimate expression of political power that has thus been the focus of this essay. Wehope also to have shown that, as this volume demonstrates more generally, darkshamanism is integral to the cosmological understanding of Amazonian peoples.NotesWe would like to thank Rupert Roopnaraine, Terence Roopnaraine, Stephanie Huel-ster, George Simon, and Christian Feest for their invaluable assistance in researchingand commenting on the materials for this essay.1 There are about 6oo Warekenas, 2,000 Bares, and 2,500 Baniwas in Venezuela, all ofwhom are part of a regional sociopolitical system with some other 40,000 Tukano ans,Makuans, and Arawakans of the northwest Amazon region of Venezuela, Brazil, andColombia. The main characteristics of this regional system are extensivemultilingualism and exogamy, and the tradition of kuwai (Wright 1981, 1993; Jackson1983; Hill 1983, 1993; Chernela 1993; Vidal 1993, 1999). Internally, the Warekena,Bare, and Baniwa groups are organized in several patrilineal, localized, and exogamicphratries; each consisting of two or more sibs ranked according to the birth order ofthe ancestral mythic brothers. Exogamy clearly enhances the possibilities for Arawak-speaking groups and subgroups to associate with each other and other societies.Hierarchy is not only the criterion to classify people and place them in a given status,it also influences intra- and intergroup alliances. Each phratry and sib is identified"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"with a specific area within its group's territory. Localized phratries and sibs exercisepolitical and economic control over rivers, sacred places, and natural resources of theirterritories. However, this territorial control can be negotiated through economicbargaining and political alliances among phratries and groups.2 These levels of shamanic specialization, and the terms for the ancestors and elders(used below) are expressed in the Bare language and derive from Bare shamanicpractice, but they are also known and used by the Warekena and Baniwa.3 Although male shamans are mostly mentioned in anthropological sources, indigenousmyth, and other oral literatures, there are a significant number of female shamansamong the Arawakan groups of the Rio Negro.4 From the eighteenth to the mid-twentieth century the influence of Arawakan groupsand societies on the urban cultures of northwestern Amazonia (i.e., in PuertoAyacucho, Manaus, San Fernando de Atabapo, Puerto Inirida, etc.) was veryimportant (Vidal and Zucchi 1999:127). This influence is manifest in daily diet,spiritual practices and beliefs, agricultural activities, and particular ways ofexploiting forest resources.5 Mormonism pictures itself, through Joseph Smith's revelation from the angel Maroniof the location of inscribed plates of gold (the textual basis for the Book of Mormon),as being connected to more ancient forms of knowledge possessed by the nativeinhabitants of the Americas.6 The source for this information is Appun (1871), who visited the Kukenaam Valley inthe 1860s and heard this story from the son of the man who eventually killedAwacaipu. The term Beckeranta is an Amerindian form of a Creole-Dutch termmeaning Land of the White, according to Appun. Appun also used this incident as thebasis for a piece of popular fiction, DerZauberer von Beckeranta: Erzahlung aus demInneren Guianas.7 In the state of Amazonas, Amerindians are referred to among themselves (and by theCriollos) as \"relatives\" (in Spanish, parientes), even though there are no biological oraffinal ties among them.8 For example, Matteson Williams was the member of Parliament for region 8 as amember of the Working People's Alliance. Notably the major political parties, thePeople's National Congress and People Progressive Party, have no indigenousrepresentatives in Parliament but have co-opted Amerindian individuals in various"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"government capacities. However, few ministerial or high-level appointments, even inareas that affect Amerindian people directly, are made.9 One observer suggested, from a meeting with Philip Moore on the occasion of hisbirthday party around the monument, that \"[Moore] has that rather `regal Africanaura' around him. He sits on a `throne' of his own devising that looks like many of hisother sculptures [which usually involve many shape shifting animal / human formsand/or more color than the bronze monument to Cuffy]. Although Moore is muchrevered by art lovers, he is on this `throne' as much because he is elderly and ratherfat, for comfort perhaps more than symbolism. However, there is a palpable sense ofawe and respect surrounding his person, but whether that is from his popularity andfame [which would appeal to many Guyanese] or to his mastery of obeah is an openquestion\" (S. Huelster, personal communication). Others would strongly deny thisdepiction of Moore, and see it simply as an expression of anti-People's NationalCongress PNC prejudice (G. Simon, personal communication).in However, under Hugh Desmond Hoyte, Burnham's successor, Rabbi Washington andhis key associates were arrested on a long-standing manslaughter charge and thenimprisoned.ReferencesAnduze, Pablo. 1973.

In comparison with other ethnographic areas of the world, theliterature dealing with witchcraft and sorcery has been rather thin: a few early studiesstill stand out as classics, such as LeviStrauss (1967), Dole (1973), and Goldman(1963), and there have been some more recent discussions deriving from the continuinginterest in the nature of shamanism (Gow 1996; Hugh-Jones 1996; Langdon 1992;Taussig 1987; Wright 1996, 1998). Recognizing this lack, and inspired by the researchof Johannes Wilbert (1993: 92-125), the works of Whitehead (2002) and, in part, ourwork have sought to develop innovative perspectives on the question.It is also evident that there is a far richer bibliography on the \"light\" side of shamans-that is, their healing and curing activities - including that of the more powerful andprophetic \"world-healers\" or, as they have often been called, \"messiahs,\" and thesocioreligious movements led by them throughout the history of contact and across theSouth American continent (see, for example, the discussion and bibliography inSullivan 1988). Furthermore, various native accounts of such movements have beenpublished that frequently present the miraculous and victorious struggles of suchleaders against the violence used by the state to suppress their leadership (Turner, inHill 1988, has labeled such narratives as \"messianic myths\"). The northwest Amazon isone area where such narratives abound (see Wright and Hill 1986), and native peoplesthere have experienced centuries of contact with the agents of Western society(missionaries, merchants, the military).Historical prophetic movements are often marked by the ways in which native peopleshave appropriated Christian symbols, practices, and representations of authority, oftenindependently of any kind of missionary interference. Christian missionaries, for theirpart, have frequently been surprised by the manner in which native peoples haveconverted en masse to the religions they have introduced-sometimes with the sameenthusiasm with which they have followed prophetic leaders. Anthropologists havesought to explain conversion movements as solutions to two kinds of problems faced bynative societies, the first of which is external, referring to the multiple ways in whichnonnative societies have disorganized and destructured native societies. Suchdisorganization is frequently manifest through a rise in witchcraft and sorceryaccusations. Conversion offers moral reform, which enables native peoples to control"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"witchcraft and regain their integrity vis-a-vis intruders. The second problem is internal,having to do with dilemmas inherent to cosmologies and inherited from primordialtimes; for example, the ontological status of affinal groups and their perceived threat tothe continuity of consanguineal or descent groups; the challenges of harnessingdangerous shamanic power for the purposes of social reproduction; and so forth (see,for example, the essays in Wright 1999).Rarely do we find in the literature native accounts of prophetic figures who, throughtheir connections to primordial powers, have sought to combat the devastating effects ofwitchcraft and sorcery perceived as inherent to the nature of the world and as the legacyof the chaotic primordial world. In this essay I present one such account that representsthe dialectical tension between dark and light consciousness, manifest as twohistorically opposed forces: witches, or those who practice witchcraft in order to kill;and prophets, those with direct access to the sources of creation. Both are representedsymbolically in mythical consciousness and both are necessary, the tradition seems tosay, to the dynamics of cosmological and historical existence, illustrating what we haveobserved elsewhere, that \"the deep mytho- historical presence of dark shamanism,contemporary with, if not actually preceding, the original emergence of persons andshamanic techniques, indicates that dark and light, killing and curing, arecomplementary opposites not antagonistic possibilities\"; and that \"whatever thetragedy, distress, and death that dark shamans and allied ritual specialists may performon humanity they are an inevitable, continuing, and even necessary part of the cosmos... [and] can become the source and even symbols of a potent indigenous society andculture that is capable of defending itself against the depredations of the outside world,be that a neighboring village or even the national state\" (Whitehead and Wright, thisvolume). In fact, in numerous religious traditions throughout the world, the two faces ofthe sacred-light and dark, good and evil-are seen as integral parts of human existence inhistory. What I seek to show here is the nature of this dynamic as the Baniwa perceiveit.The Baniwa of the northwest Amazon in Brazil have experienced a long history ofengagement in prophetic movements (Wright and Hill 1986; Wright 1gg8), and in facttheir mass conversion to evangelical Christianity beginning in the 1950s may beunderstood as a modality of such engagement (Wright 1998). Immediately prior toconversion, and even concomitant with it, they followed prophetic leaders who,according to narrative accounts, sought to eradicate witchcraft and, in so doing, reformthe foundations of living together in society. Despite the historical evidence, which"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"clearly shows that the Baniwa at that time were traumatized by the devastating effectsof rubber and other extractivist industries, the narratives deny the destructive power ofthe whites over prophetic leaders and point to the internal problem of witchcraft as thetrue source of evil. Posed in this way, the problem of evil is thus susceptible to theactions of prophets, who are uniquely capable of keeping it in check.The first part of this essay thus explores the nature of witchcraft, its mythicalfoundations and sociopolitical contexts. I contrast witchcraft with sorcery and describethe institution of shamanic vengeance used to destroy witches.' I also explore the extentto which exogenous influences have exacerbated levels of witchcraft accusations. In thisessay's second part I present a lengthy oral history that demonstrates how prophets, or\"wise men,\" constantly waged battle against wickedness, witches, and the white man.While prophets demonstrated their superior knowledge over the white man, theysuccumbed to the implacable evil of the wicked, enemies within their own society. Eventhe mass conversion of the Baniwa to Protestant evangelicalism in the 1950s and 1g6osdid not succeed in erradicating the evil and witches from this world, as converts hadhoped. Yet the wisdom of the prophets survives to the present day, and their followerscontinue to journey to their graves to request their protection.Dark and Light Consciousness in the Baniwa CosmosTo represent the dialectical tension between light and dark consciousness it isnecessary to discuss briefly how the universe is perceived and human existenceevaluated by those who are most directly concerned with such questions in Baniwasociety, the shamans.In my fieldwork in 1997-2001, one of the most knowledgeable shamans of all theBaniwa in Brazil elaborated at my request his understanding of the structure of theuniverse. In his view, the universe is organized into an enormous vertical structure oftwenty-five layers, or worlds (kuma), with twelve layers below \"This World\"(Hliekwapi) of humans and twelve above. As a master shaman, he had experienced allof these levels including the highest and most difficult-to-reach world of thecreator/transformer and father of all Baniwa, Nhiaperikuli or \"Dio,\" whom he called the\"Illuminated One,\" whose body shines \"like a brilliant mirror,\" and who is \"eternallyyoung.\" The sun is considered to be a manifestation of Nhiaperikuli's body.The twelve worlds below ours -collectively known as Uapinakuethe- are inhabited bydifferent types of beings or \"tribes of people.\" With the exception of the people of the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"lowest level and one other, all other peoples are considered to be \"good\" and assist theshaman in his search for the lost souls of the sick. The worlds above ours-collectivelyknown as Apakwa Hek- wapi, the \"Other World\"-are in large part defined by shamanicqualities and have to do with sickness and curing. With the exception of levels five andsix, which are inhabited by the spirit \"Owner of Sickness,\" Wamundana or Kuwai (whois Nhiaperikuli's son), and his \"secretary,\" the white sloth (tchitamali ), all other levelsare likewise inhabited by \"good people.\" Some may \"deceive\" or \"lie\" to the shaman,but only the Owner of Sickness possesses death-dealing substances used in witchcraft.All other spirit-beings are considered \"good people.\"By contrast, This World of humans is considered to be irredeemably evil. Thus, of allthe layers in the universe, four are considered to be comprised of wicked people. It isremarkable how, in the context and from the perspective of the most elaborate cosmicstructure thus far recorded among the Baniwa, the theme of evil in the world of humansclearly stands out. In shamanic discourse about the qualities of the universe, This Worldis frequently characterized as the place of evil, maatchikwe; place of pain, kai- wikwe;and place of rot, ekukwe, in contrast to the world of Nhiaperikuli, which is notable forits sources of remedies against the sicknesses of This World, which is considered to becontaminated by the existence of sorcerers and witches. Both cosmogonic myths and theshamans' discourse repeatedly emphasize that the human world is intrinsically flawedby evil, misfortune, and death.Shamanic powers and cures, by contrast, are characterized in terms of the protective,beneficial, and aesthetically correct: \"to make the world beautiful\"; \"to make ThisWorld and the people in it better and content\"; \"to not let This World fall or end\"(meaning, to be covered in darkness and overrun by witches); \"to retrieve lost souls andmake sick persons well\" -are all phrases that appear in shamanic discourses about theirjourneys to the Other World. In all phases of this journey, the beauty, goodness, unity,order, and truth-in a word, light-of the Other World (with the exception of the places ofKuwai) stand in contrast with This World of multiple pain and evil. In one sense, then,the shaman's quest would seem to be one of \"beautify ing\" This World by seeking tocreate order and preventing the darkness of chaos. With this background, I now turn tothe practices of witchcraft and sorcery in This World and the sorts of remedial actionsindividuals can take against these practices.The Nature of Witchcraft and SorceryManhene (witchcraft). The word I translate as witchcraft, manhene, literally means"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"\"one does not know,\" which is an accurate reflection of the extreme secrecy associatedwith its practice. The Baniwa translate the word into Portuguese as veneno, poison (andin lingua geral as marecaimbara), and use the word to refer not only to poisonoussubstances but also to the act of secretly putting such substances (plants, resins, ash,berries, thorns) in the food, drink, personal objects, or bodily orifices of an enemy withthe intent to kill him or her. Various forms of poisoning can produce such severereactions (high fever, vomiting blood, diarrhea with blood) as to result in sudden andinstant death, while others provoke a process of chronic sickness that slowly weakensthe victim, leaving him or her pale, thin, anemic,' and sometimes with behavioraldisturbances characterized by the adoption of animallike behavior and an incapacity toperform the normal activities of daily life.' For all Baniwa, manhene is the most seriousand frequent form of traditional sickness and explanation for death.'The importance of manhene can be estimated by the fact that the first death in theprimordial world was caused by poison. According to the myths of origin (seeAcIRA/FOIRN iggg) Kuwai, the son of the creator/transformer Nhiaperikuli, left allforms of poison in this world as vengeance for his own killing. Nhiaperikuli gathered upthis poison in a pot and hid it in his house, but a tribe of ancestral monkey-spirits, calledEenunai, stole this poison and became powerful witches, or \"poison-owners\" (manheneiminali ). They poisoned one of Nhiaperikuli's younger brothers, who then became thefirst person to die. After this, Nhiaperikuli succeeded in regaining the poison from theEenunai, wrapped it in a bundle, and threw it on top of several hills located in southernVenezuela, where witches today may still go to get it. It is noteworthy that in theirefforts to explain why Nhiaperikuli left poisonous plants in This World shamans use thesimple statement \"in order to kill people.\" Although seemingly odd, this statementreflects no more than the complementary opposition of killing and healing, which areinherent to cosmological dynamics and historical existence.In contrast to other indigenous societies of Amazonia, Baniwa shamans do not doubleas witches; in fact, although shamans do have the power to kill, they adamantly denythat they use poison and affirm that their principal function is to cure manhene.5 Whileall adults know about poison kill ings and are capable of occasionally using witchcraft,not all can become poison-owners, for this requires, among other things, the acquisitionof specialized knowledge having to do with the location and preparation of poisons andtheir antidotes-an extensive knowledge judging from the wide range of poisons known'In addition, a poison-owner is someone who is considered to be \"no longer like aperson,\" for \"his only thought is to kill\": the bodily form of such a witch differs from"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"that of normal people. The poison-owner's body, according to shamans who \"see\" theirtrue nature, is that of a monkey, like the mythical Eenunai. Shamans see them with furall over their bodies, especially on their arms and hands. Moreover, the poisonowner'ssoul is, according to shamans, a spirit of the dead, inyaime, which inhabits the peripheryof This World. They say that when a poison-owner enters a house, first inyaime goes in,then the body of the poison-owner, that is, of a monkey, enters.'Only shamans are capable of curing manhene through sucking out the poison, thevisible representation of which is usually monkey or sloth fur; there are, however, nospells or chants powerful enough to reverse the effects of poison given by poison-owners. Besides extraction, shamans usually recommend plant medicines (various typesof roots that counteract the gastric effects of the poison). While the Baniwa have alsodiscovered a number of white man's remedies (liquid vitamins, for example) that helpin cures for poison, they still seek the cures of shamans first for cases of manhene.What motivates a person to practice witchcraft or, even, to become a poison-owner?The most compelling reasons cited were: vengeance (lipua- mina or liuma likuada, \"heseeks exchange\") for the death of a kin who is believed to have been poisoned or killedby sorcery-in this case, the person may either seek vengeance through the Guahiboshamans (see below), or take vengeance personally, for the dying person \"tells\" who isresponsible for his or her murder; envy (nakhemakan or maatchi likapakan, \"he lookswith evil\") at the success, prosperity, and well being of others, relative to one's ownsituation: debt, rejection, isolation and continued misfortune may fuel a person's desireto \"ruin\" the lives of those more successful and prosperous; resentment (maatchilikaale, \"his heart is wicked, bad\"), for example, when a person does not live up to his orher part of an exchange (e.g., marital), thus producing an inequality, or when someoneis known to have spoken malicious gossip, one's heart turns against that person whichmay result in poisoning; (d) the loss of control over one's thought and emotions(manhekada lima, a state or condition of being in which a person acts without thought).This latter reason is perhaps the most dangerous of all motives, for it implies that theperson no longer has any control over emotions such as hatred, anger, or envy, and letsthese feelings dominate his or her thoughts. In such cases, the person becomes anasocial being, for living in society implies \"thought\" (ianheke, the negative of which ismanheke; in its least harmful aspect this may mean stupid or ignorant, but even so sucha state may result in fatal errors), and the importance of remembering the counsel of theelders at initiation to \"treat one's kin well, share one's food, never fool with poison,\" etc.In the past there were other motives for swift killing by poison related to ritual"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"transgressions, such as exposing the sacred flutes and trumpets to women.What are the social correlates of witchcraft? That is, are certain types of socialrelations more subject, or vulnerable, to it? My initial idea, based on counting knownincidents, was that it is said to occur more frequently among affines than amongconsanguineal kin, which would be consistent with mythical and historical narratives.Yet, when I pressed the Baniwa about this, they would not agree. \"One doesn't know,one can't know,\" one man said, \"it could be anyone, sib-brother, cousin.\" People agreethat there is never witchcraft among members of a nuclear family, but as the circle ofkin widens to include parallel cousins, sib-brothers, and at the extreme, affines(imathana) and potential affines (itenaaki ), the probabilities become ever greater. With\"enemies\" (ipuunda)-socially, geographically, and linguistically distant peoples -warfare (uwi) was waged in the past, but with the abandoning of warfare, affines andpotential affines have in fact come to represent the greatest perceived threats to kingroups.What means do communities have for preventing outbreaks of witchcraft? One suchmechanism has to do with the deliberate shaping of a community sentiment thatdownplays any and all discussions of, or references to, witchcraft and its transmission.'Baniwa from a very large and prosperous community on the upper Aiary River, forexample, insisted that there were few cases of witchcraft in their community becausethe elders \"only spoke of good things,\" such as dance festivals and music, happiness,etc., and frowned on discussions having to do with witchcraft incidents. In contrast,another community was plagued with problems of witchcraft because there the eldershad let it get out of control.In this regard, it is of great importance to note that the oral histories I cite later in thisarticle point to the control of witchcraft and poisoning as one of the most importantpowers of the historical prophets and messiahs. Such figures preached against poisonand sought to eradicate its use by publicly accusing those whom they knew possessed it.Again, their efforts worked in the direction of creating community unity and repressingwhatever would provoke misunderstanding and conflict.Hiuiathi (sorcery). These are evil spells sent by persons who desire to cause harm totheir enemies.' They can be done by shamans, chanters, or common people who knowtheir contents. These spells use a logic similar to that of their symmetric opposites,curing chants; they name things that are considered dangerous (e.g., biting insects,snakes, scorpions, spiders, poisonous fruits, spirits of the dead, etc.), seeking to cause"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"harm to the vic- tim.1° In performing these spells, the sorcerer speaks the names ofaggressive beings in a low, almost inaudible, voice, over his cigar, then blows the spellinto the air with the smoke. The sorcerer may also leave the rest of his cigar, enchantedby the words of his spell, at a place where the victim will pass or stay. The spells canalso be blown on the clothes or hammock of the victim, or even on houseposts. Apowerful sorcerer may as he speaks the spell, simply spit on a place where the victimwill pass, or even just stare at his victim while remembering the spell in his mind (asort of evil eye) in order to produce the desired effect. Spells may be done to provokesickness, but also to cause discord, misunderstanding, and fights within communities.There are numerous types of hiuiathi, but the special group of sicknesses andabnormal conditions related to women and reproduction should be highlighted becauseit is more common than others 11 Postpartum hemorrhage, excessive menstruation,abortions, death at childbirth, infertility, lack of maternal milk, or milk that producesvomiting and diarrhea in the newborn are all conditions that are said to be produced bysorcerers' spells that seek to \"ruin\" the woman, generally because of jealousy or angerfrom slighted would-be lovers. Unmarried women and pregnant women are thus a high-risk group for sorcerers' attacks. In the past, it is said, these spells would be spokenduring the male initiation rituals when women could not be present. But while theseforms of hiuiathi are often due to problems in love affairs more generally, the socialsphere that defines this type of aggressive action against other humans is genderrelations, regardless of any other associations (sib or phratry membership, kin or affinalrelations) that the sorcerer might have with the victim.All of these forms of sorcery likewise began with Kuwai who, according to myth,taught Nhiaperikuli and humans how to chant at initiation rites and how to cure; but hetaught hiuiathi to Nhiaperikuli's younger brother Eeri who, thinking that they were to dogood, transmitted them to humans. Other versions say that in the great fire that markedKuwai's death, he passed on all his knowledge about hiuiathi to the spirits of naturecalled iupinai; for this reason, they are the true sorcerers, or hiuiathi iminali (sorcery-owners) in the world today. In both versions, Kuwai, the \"owner of sickness,\" began allforms of hiuiathi. Other spirit-beings and humans learned and transmitted thisknowledge over the generations. Thus, in curing, a chanter must identify correctly theform of sickness and its specific spirit origin in order to name and counteract the effectsof the sorcery.Shamanic vengeance (iupithbtem). The practice of shamanic vengeance appears to bevery ancient among the Baniwa and specifically links them with various indigenous"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"peoples of the Ilanos in Colombia, especially the Guahibo of the Vichada River, who areknown to be powerful shamans capable of killing at long distances. What underlies thepractice is that Baniwa shamans themselves, while perfectly capable of undertakingvengeance, even at a long distance, say they do not do so out of \"fear\" of reprisalsagainst their families by witches. Thus they seek other, distant, nonArawak-speakingpeoples whose power to kill in order to avenge is held to be as strong or stronger thantheir own.Perhaps the first reference to this practice is found in Theodor Koch- Griinberg'sreport (1967 [agog]) of his ethnographic travels on the Aiary River at the beginning ofthe twentieth century. His principal interlocutor, a shaman, told him that sometime aftera person's death, the relatives of the victim take an article of clothing and the \"poison\"that the shaman had extracted to \"a people in the northeast,\" whom they request takevengeance on the murderer by \"magical action at a distance.\" Koch-Griinbergunderstood that these people lived in large roundhouses on the Vichada River and werecalled Pidzari. The \"magical action\" consisted of placing the article of the deceasedinside a circle traced on the ground over which the shaman pronounced a spell to \"callthe murderer,\" whereupon he burned the poison. In an instant, in the ashes, the shamanfound and killed the \"distant enemy\" responsible for the death.12Shamans whom I interviewed in the 197os and 19gos confirmed that the Guahibo, orWanhiwa, were still sought to perform this service. Cubeo and \"true\" Baniwa shamanscould even produce more rapid results,13 but the Hohodene preferred the Wanhiwabecause even though Hohodene shamans know who is responsible for a death or a seriesof deaths in their communities they will never reveal it publicly nor, they say, will theytake direct action for \"fear\" of reprisal from the witch against their own families orbecause they know that the witch is a sib -brother against whom no action can be taken14The Hohodene shamans' descriptions of the ritual performance reveal some variationsfrom the accounts cited above. Known as iupithbtem (a word I am unable to translate),the hair or \"filth\" (hiuidamakbthi) or even a piece of clothing is taken by the deceased'srelatives, sometimes years after he or she has died (although it is collected immediatelyafter the person's death, it is kept wrapped in a bundle), and they pay (lidauanbtaka) theWanhiwa shaman to take vengeance (liuma likuada, \"he seeks exchange\"). It should benoted that iupithbtem is performed not only in cases of death by manhene but alsohiuiathi. Since hiuiathi is done secretively and by any one, the family of the victim hasno way of determining who was responsible and may thus seek the services of the"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Guahibo.The Wanhiwa shaman places the hair of the deceased on the ground in front of him,together with the payment, a bucket of water, and a stone that is said to be the shaman'ssoul 15 The shaman takes the hallucinogenic niopo (snuff) and begins to sing, \"lookingfor the soul\" of the murderer. When a butterfly, or small bird, or \"whatever little thing\"appears before him, this is the murderer's soul and the shaman takes the stone and \"bitesit,\" killing it instantly. The shaman may even \"hear its death-cry.\"At that time, or later, he sends a great wind to where the intended victim is, and thevictim begins to go mad (ikaka). According to various reports, he begins to eat ashesfrom the fire, sits on hot coals but doesn't burn, eats his fingernails \"for his hands don'tknow what they are doing,\" runs after women and attempts to rape them, and rips off hisclothes and runs about in circles-sometimes into the forest. The madness subsides but,several days later, the Wanhiwa sends another great wind with thunderclouds andlightning. The victim does the same as before but now he confesses, revealing thenames of everyone whom he has killed. He bites his lips and tongue so that he won't tellwho has killed him. He rips off his clothes, mutilates his genitals, and finally dies.Numerous eyewitness accounts of iupithbtem confirm the efficacy of this vengeancekilling?sUrban sorcerers (macumbeiros). In the late 1970s, new forms of sorcery wereintroduced into the municipal capital of Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira, located a shortdistance from Baniwa territory. Brought by Afro-Brazilian and mestigo migrants fromManaus, Belem, and other areas of northeastern Brazil, who came by the thousands towork on the construction of the northern perimeter highway (BR-21o), and later in the1g8os by gold panners from Roraima, these new forms, known as macumba, becameincorporated into the already-existing repertoire of ritual specialists, or benzedores(spell-blowers), usually Bare and Tukano Indians, or Mestizos of the city. Furtherresearch is needed on these forms of sorcery, and here I only wish to note that forBaniwa shamans, macumba refers to the practice of killing through sorcery or evilspell-blowing at a distance, and it is thus, they say, \"like iupithbtem,\" as done by theWanhiwa.I have noted the ways in which community elders may actively prevent witchcraftfrom taking hold by reinforcing a community sentiment of \"happiness\" while alsodownplaying discussions of witchcraft incidents.

He was ofthe Dzauinai phratry, which inhabited the middle Igana and upper Guainia rivers. Hispower and fame extended throughout the northwest Amazon region during the secondhalf of the nineteenth century, and he was known as the \"Christ of the Igana.\" There arenumerous histories told about him by the Baniwa, Tariana, and Desana of the Braziliannorthwest Amazon, and also by the Wakuenai, kin of the Baniwa, in Venezuela. Thereare various anthropological publications about Kamiko, based on analysis of writtendocuments from the midnineteenth century and on the oral histories.The tradition presented here was told to me in July 2001 by Joao Fontes, a Hohodeneelder of the large Hohodene village of Ucuqui Cachoeira on the upper Aiary River. Itwas narrated in Baniwa and translated to Portuguese by the narrator's son, AlbinoFontes. The tradition is about two prophets- Kamiko and his son Uetsu Mikuiri (theterm mikuiri is used to refer to deceased persons). According to the calculations that Iand the narrators made, Uetsu lived in the first half of this century. Kamiko, accordingto historical records, died in 1903.Never before has a tradition about Kamiko's son been recorded. In fact, I beganresearching oral histories about Baniwa prophets in 1976, but at that time and until 2002the Baniwa never told me anything about Uetsu; rather, they recounted pieces of storiesabout other powerful shamans of the past, including Kamiko. When I asked them whythey never told the tradition before, knowing my interest in their histories, theyresponded that in the 197os the storywas still being organized and constructed, and theexperience with Uetsu was too recent to have elaborated the narrative. A generationlater, the narrative had become fully elaborated. Both prophets were consideredmessiahs whose powers and knowledge surpassed various attempts by the white men tokill them. Most important, both utilized their powers of clairvoyance gained from thevisions produced by the use of parikb, shamanic snuff (Virola sp.), and thehallucinogenic plant caapi (Banisteriopsis caapi), as well as their wisdom to control, ifnot eradicate, the practice of witchcraft in Baniwa communities. Both, however,"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"suffered great losses in the process as a result of the treachery of their enemies.My transcription of the tradition is given below; I include my questions and otherinformation in brackets.Kamiko was a paje [shaman] of the Dzauinai tribe [phratry]. He lived long ago. Hecould see well; he could see everything [referring to the shamanic power of vision,clairvoyance]. He lived in Tunui [on the middle Igana]. He saw who had poison,manhene, and ordered them to throw the poison away. He ordered whoever had poisonto take it out of where it was hidden, and he could tell people, \"you have evil stuff.\" [Q:He knew who had it?] He knew. He would arrive in a community. Then at night, hisknowledge would show him where people had poison buried. His knowledge wouldindicate who had it and where it was buried. He already knew in his dream at night. If itwas hidden in the water [stream], at a meter's depth, he knew where the poison was.Everything, he already knew. Then he would join everyone from the communitytogether and communicate to them everything, indicating the people who had poison.The people who didn't have poison wouldn't appear in his dream. Those who had it, evenif it was hidden in a really difficult place in a stream, he would order them to find anddig it up. After, he would put it altogether in the center of the village. Others that heindicated would go and dig up their poison. One after another until he found all thepoison. Then, he would get everyone together to give them advice. Only those who hadpoison, for those who didn't have poison had nothing to do with what he had to say.Then ... he went to various communities doing the same things. He would come to acommunity, and in his dream, his knowledge would show who had poison and where itwas. The next day, he would order people to make a drinking fest. Then after the fest, hewould speak to those who had poison, \"you have it, in such-and-such place you arehiding it.\" Then he would call another and say, \"you have poison, in such-and-such aplace you are hiding it.\"He would go to other communities, like Nazare, then farther downriver. ... There, itseems, someone made a complaint against him to the whites saying that Kamiko wascalling himself a saint. The white men came, captured, and took him prisoner to seewhether he really was resistant, if he really was a saint. They prepared a coffin, putKamiko inside the coffin and threw him into the river. He stayed one whole night insidethe coffin at the bottom of the river. Next day, they took the coffin out of the river,opened it, and he was inside, but still alive. During the night, his soul had gone out ofthe coffin and went wandering about. Then they believed that Kamiko really was a saint."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Kamiko cured various sicknesses, he did shamanism, always curing the sick. Then,later, he died. [Q: How did he die?] The white men took him and sent him away. Thosewho had poison were angry with him and complained about him to the whitesrequesting that they remove him from the area. And so it was, the white man made thisdecision. The whites took him far away, way beyond Manaus, and he died there. Thesaint said, \"I will not seek to avenge myself. I will go away, I will seek to die as Jesusdied,\" Kamiko said that. And that was the end.[Q: Did Kamiko say he would come back one day?] No, he died there among thewhites. [Q: And did he have children? Or grandchildren who are alive today?] He hadone son. His son's tomb is on the Ake river, Kamiko's son. Today, people always gothere. His name was Uetsu. He was also captured by the whites. And the whites didexactly the same things to him as they did with his father. They came, took himprisoner, made a coffin, made him get inside the coffin, and threw him into the river.After an hour, they took the coffin out of the river, opened it, and he was alive, holdinga Bible in his hand. The white man did exactly as he did with his father. Learned menfrom Caracas came to do that to him. They thought he was deceiving, lying to thepeople. So, they came to prove whether he really was a saint. Two people came, learnedmen from Caracas. There they asked him, \"is it true you are a wise man? A saint? God?\"\"No, I am not God,\" Uetsu replied. \"Because most people say that you are God, that youcure, do everything. We are going to prove whether you are a saint or not. We are goingto make a coffin and put you in the river for an hour.\" \"Alright,\" Uetsu replied and gavehimself up. They made the coffin, made the lid of the coffin, put him inside, and tied itup. But before closing it, Uetsu's soul left his body. They put the coffin in the river foran hour at two meters' depth. After an hour, they took it out, opened it, and he was fine.Then Uetsu said, \"now, you did it to me. It's my turn to do to you what you did to me.So our Lord ordered, you are learned men, let's prove whether you have knowledgeequal to mine. So our Lord ordered.\" Seeing that he was right, one of the learned mengot in the coffin. They did exactly as they had done to him. After an hour, they took thecoffin out, and that learned man was already dead. The other learned man who was therewith him became frightened. He was afraid because it was true what they had told him.He said, \"see how this one is dead and the other is fine.\" Then the learned man wentaway, he was afraid of Uetsu.[Q: Where did Uetsu live, in which village?] On the upper Rio Negro, on the Guainia,but he didn't have a fixed community. He lived almost like a nomad. He lived in oneplace for three months, another two months. Thus was his life, he didn't have a fixed"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"community.The learned men ended up believing that he really had knowledge, that he was a saint.And people spread the word of his fame, saying, \"there, there is a man who is a saint,who has knowledge, who is a diviner.\" They began spreading word of his fame, sayingthat he was a good paje. There people began believing that he was a good saint.He went around making festivals. And the fests, the elders didn't know when thesefests would happen. He would go in the midst of the people and announce, \"tomorrowthere is going to be a fest. Prepare for it, with caxiri [manioc beer]. Our heavenly Fatherwill also make a fest with his angels. We also are going to make a fest. Let's imitatehim.\" After, he would go to another community and do the same thing.He attracted a lot of people, many people followed him. During the fest, he would calleach person and give them counsel, \"you have wickedness, you have a bad thing thatkills people. Don't do that. Throw away the bad stuff that you have so that we can livewell together, in tranquillity.\" If they came happily, he would say nothing, but if aperson came with the thought to do evil, he would tell them, \"throw that evil stuff away,let's live as one family.\" If a woman came with the thought to cause harm to a man withpussanga charm,17 he would say, \"that pussanga causes harm, don't do that.\" He wouldadvise, \"this advice is not made by me\"; he would say, \"our heavenly Father has sent meto give counsel to you. Throw that evil stuff away so that we can live well.\" Hisobjective was to bring people together and to give them counsel.[Q: How did he get so much power to do this? How is it that he knew how to seeeverything?] Because he was a paje he used parikb [shamanic snuff], even the parikb ofthe Wanhiwa.One day, people began to disbelieve in him, saying, \"can it really be that this man is asaint?\" Then, they started poisoning Uetsu's sons. He performed the paje's ceremoniesto cure them, but his first son ended up dying. So he called the people together to get ridof the evil that they had done, but people said, \"why is it that he didn't cure his son, if heis a saint?\" The people became revolted with him. His wife remained silent. Later, theypoisoned his second and third sons. He performed the paje's cures on them, with parikband everything else, but even so, they ended up dying.Then his wife began to disbelieve him. She complained, \"so many times you have saidyou are a saint, counseled these people, seen the wickedness of each one, yet you didn't"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"even cure our son. You are false, you are speaking nonsense.\" She disbelieved in him,she was revolted with him. She ordered him to get his shaman's rattle and said, \"throwthis away. This is not the truth. You don't cure.\" Then he said to her, \"I will die withparikb.\" She was revolted, but he said he would die with parikb. He began to snuff. Hecalled his wife, \"look, blow [parikb] for me, for me to die.\" His wife blew parikb forhim and he fell, unconscious. From ten in the morning until five in the afternoon, thenhe got up. He was fine. And thus he increased his knowledge of the world more andmore. With parikb, you don't really die, there is no way to really die with it. It onlymakes you more intelligent, know the world more. After, he said, \"now I am going touse the caapi [plant] of the Wanhiwa, with niopo [parikd of the Wanhiwa].\" Then heprepared the caapi, a gourdful of it, drank it, and fell unconscious again. They said hewas dead, but caapi is like parikd. He remained unconscious until five in the afternoonwhen he got up again. While he was unconscious, he walked on the vine [that is, his souljourneyed on the caapi vine] until the end of the vine, then came back.So each time he took it, he deepened his knowledge. He came to know the angels, hesaw all those people who had died, his father, his mother, his brother. All those he saw,he even conversed with them. That is the consequence of caapi. The dead sent messagesto people who were still alive, and he would pass on the messages, their remembrances.He conversed with the dead and each time, he passed on messages. And so he deepenedhis knowledge, really showing that he saw the dead.Then one day he went fishing, downriver. At a certain point, he stayed still, fixing hisfishing line, when suddenly he heard a noise of people behind him. He turned around tosee, and it was his deceased sister. The more she approached him, he felt her presenceuntil he fell unconscious in the canoe. His sister came close to him, passing her perfumeover him. The other dead gave him medicine and the world opened more for him. Thedead took him to the world of the dead. \"We live here, that other family [of the dead]lives here. There is the house of the Lord. This here is the house of God\"-which shone-\"God, the house of God\"-very beautiful, brilliant, resplendant, just as the sun when itrises, like gold. Then, after they showed him, they came back and said, \"here is wherewe live when people die.\"Then, they say, Uetsu conversed with God, with our Lord, who said, \"look, from nowon, you really will be a saint, you can already say this to people. You will get to yourhouse. When you get to your house, don't tell about what you saw. Not even news aboutyour sister, that perfume that she passed over you, nothing that you saw. Act as thoughyou had seen nothing.\""},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Then he went back to his house. And he didn't tell anything. From then on, he wouldalways see our Lord. When he slept, they say that he would wake up in his dream andsing, \"Gloria, Gloria Jesus.\" Every time he would sleep, he would sing this song. In hisdream, he would wake up, awaken to the other world. Then his wife got tired of hearingthose words, \"why are you singing that when you sleep? What's the matter with you,what do you feel?\" \"No,\" he answered, \"I am dreaming, God sent this dreamwork.\" \"It'stoo much!\" she complained.Wherever he went, he always met up with that sister of his and those dead people, hisdeceased father and mother. The dead people waited for him and would tell him, \"it willbe like this, people will come who want to poison you.\" They informed him, alertinghim, \"people will come wanting to poison you. Tell them to get rid of that wickednessand live well.\" They always guided him.From that time on, he became \"authorized\" to say what he saw. He came back and toldhis wife, \"I have seen your dead father, the time has come to say that I have seen thesaints and the dead.\" He told this to his wife. Thus the word spread. His wife told otherwomen, \"look, my husband is like this,\" and they told other women. She went aroundtelling.And the people who had bad omens, Uetsu knew how to see and explain [the meaningof the bad omens]. Everything that a person saw in those bad omens, he would fix andadvise, \"I saw such and such.\" He didn't have to wait for night, he would just rollhimself up in his hammock, then the spirit would come and stay just a short while, noteven an hour. Then he would get up and say, \"you saw that bad omen? Somebody isgoing to poison you. But our Lord has left it so that nothing will happen to you.\" Thushe was showing his capacity.So because of these consultations that people made with him, he began attractingmore people. More people came. They wanted him to turn into a king for them, a chief.There were those people who rowed a canoe for him like a king, a chief, a president. Hehad rowers, he had people who gave food to him, he had people who accompanied him.Even the people wanted him to be king. But he didn't want this. Our Lord gave himorders, but ones that didn't allow that he put himself as chief. He wanted to be equal tothe other people. Equal-neither superior nor inferior.In this work of attracting people, he went up the Icana and Aiary rivers. He traveled alot on the Aiary river, from Jandu [near the mouth of the Aiary] to Seringa Rupita [at"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"the headwaters of the Uarana, a tributary stream of the upper Aiary]. He went to livewith Hohodene kin, the deceased Pedro Fontes [grandfather of the narrator]; he wasPedro's brother-cousin [i.e., of the same phratry but different sibs].18 He was anAdzanene [younger sibbrother to the Hohodene, of the Hohodene phratry], but he was anelder brother because of his mother, he was the son of an elder brother. He traveled allover the Icana area and its tributaries, all the Rio Negro. He spoke many languages:Venezuelan, Baniwa, Curipaco, Werekena. He held many, many fests in thecommunities of Nazare, Ambauba, Taiauassu, Tucunare - all on the lower Icana.[Q: What happened to him?] Well, after he became a wise man, when people camewith the thought of poisoning him, during the night, in his dream, he was advised, \"thatperson is bringing poison for you, so watch out for him.\" He would greet the person andsay, \"look, you have the bad intention to poison me.\" He was really proving that healready knew that others were wanting to destroy him, to do evil.Until there came a time when God didn't advise him anymore. Because the time forhim to leave this world had come. Then, people poisoned him. God himself didn't sayanything to him, for it was already time for him to leave this world. [Q: But whopoisoned him?] Para thayri, Parathana. The land of the Parathana lies below [the rapidsof] Ambadba, on the Para stream. So he went back to the upper Guainia, because healways traveled there. But there, many people came together, and in order for there notto be so many people he went to another place. But in each place, people came together.[Q: Where was he buried?] On the Guainia. His tomb is on the Ake River. But his bodywas divided in two. One part was buried in Macarenta on the Ake; another part inYauita in Venezuela. [Q: Why was it divided like that?] Because he really was a saint.Today, people pray to him. His tomb serves as a place for people to come to consulthim. When a person sees an evil omen, people ask that he bless and protect them. And ithas worked, the tomb is working even today.He said that he himself would return six days after his death. His wife took care of hisbody. Six days passed and she took care of it. Then it began to rot, dripping water. Hiswife let the water drip into a pan. Then the people who had poisoned him, his enemies,spoke to her, \"you're suffering with this dead, let us take care of him.\" His enemies said.A day before he would come back to life, she left him, she put his body in the hands ofhis enemies. Then the day came. Those who were keeping watch over him began toscream because he made an omen. That was the end of his life. If he had come back tolife, he would never again die. He would be immortal. Like Jesus. He wouldn't die. Thatends this story. After him, there was never again another person like him."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Interpretation of the Tradition of KamikoWitchcraft and sorcery, as we have seen, are critical questions for the Baniwa. Inanother study (1998), I have shown how witchcraft accusations within a communityreflect actual interpersonal conflicts and explosive tensions in intercommunityrelations, producing a discourse that attributes all occurrences of witchcraft-real orsuspect-to designated individuals marked as witches. If poison and witchcraft have thepotential to literally destroy a community, even from within, what are the means thatthe Baniwa have to protect themselves against it or even to prevent outbreaks ofwitchcraft? One of these certainly is the shamans' cures through which, in the encounterwith the Owner of Sickness and poison, Kuwai, the shaman can request the medicinenecessary to cure the cases of poison in This World. Another mechanism is to preventpeople from using poison-that is, to discover who has poison within the community andwage a campaign to eradi cate it. Again, it is the pajes who, through the clairvoyancethat parikb gives them, know who has poison and where it is hidden (either buried or atthe bottom of a stream). This was the way Kamiko and Uetsu initially controlledwitchcraft in Baniwa communities.In order to prevent future outbreaks, however, they had to shape communitysentiments against the use of any substance that might ruin the health and well-being ofthe people. Thus, they counseled the people against poison and they organized fests toencourage the collective sentiment of happiness among the members of a communityor, in other words, of comunitas among an \"assembly of believers\" (Sullivan 1988). Theprophets took advantage of the fests to preach and to act against those who had poisonby exposing them in public and giving them advice. In short, both prophets sought tocreate a sentiment of community unity and \"throw away\" everything that could provokemisunderstanding, conflict, envy, jealousy, resentment-all motives for practicingwitchcraft.The two prophets were messiahs, or saints in the terminology of Amazonian popularCatholicism, for, as the story relates, they resisted the attempts of the white man to killthem by suffocation, thus demonstrating the superiority of their knowledge over that ofthe two \"learned men\" (doutores) from Caracas (a characteristic of many messianicmyths). The irony of history, however, is that what ended up destroying the twoprophets did not come from outside but from among their own people. It was thereaction (revolta) against them of the poison-owners and those who practicedwitchcraft, for having exposed them in public. In the case of Uetsu, witches killed threeof his sons; and, inexplicably, he was unable to avoid their deaths by poisoning."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Revealing, advising, and seeking to create a collective sentiment proved to beinsufficient to combat or prevent the treachery of the witches.Uetsu then adopted a more radical stance than that used by his father who, victimizedby the witches, simply went away and like Christ didn't seek to avenge himself. Uetsusought \"to die\" by taking the very potent mixture used by the Wanhiwa (Guahibo)Indians of the Ilanos of Colombia, which combines caapi with parikb. In shamaniclanguage, \"to die\" means to go farther in shamanic journeys to the Other World in orderto acquire deeper knowledge. As a result Uetsu developed the power to foresee, not justto reveal and advise as before. This new power was acquired through communicationwith the souls of the dead and with Din (God) himself. Thus Uetsu could foretell when aperson was about to suffer an attack from a witch, and he could change what mostafflicted and terrified people-evil omens, signs of inevitable death.In order to avoid being a victim of peoples' envy and sure poisoning, Uetsu refused tobe considered a \"king, chief, or president,\" as people wished; that is, he refused tosolidify a hierarchical position of centralized authority among the people, although it isevident that he had many followers who accompanied him from village to village andtook care of him, and that he was capable of attracting many people to his fests andceremonies. His power came from his knowledge and not from an accumulation ofpolitical prestige, goods, or force. There is thus no basis for sustaining the argument,suggested by some anthropological analyses, that prophetic movements representperiodic efforts to install chiefdoms; to the contrary, the tradition of Uetsu supports theidea that prophetic movements were more in line with states of egalitarian comunitas.Both prophets, however, were inevitably subject to the determinations of destiny. TheBaniwa say that the times of coming into this world and leaving it are predetermined, or\"marked.\" Uetsu stopped receiving divine messages and was poisoned; and once againwickedness and weakness prevailed, preventing him from returning and becomingimmortal (had his wife resisted his enemies and gathered all his mortal remains, as heinstructed her, he would have revived). Nevertheless, his \"knowledge,\" or wisdom,remained in this world, together with his mortal remains at his tomb, in order to be ableto help his kin and those who requested his protection following his burial.Uetsu's body was \"divided\" into two parts (a reminder of dismembered Catholicsaints, or even further afield, the myth of Inkarri, whose body was quartered and buriedin separate places) both of which continue to protect his people. The significance of thedivision of Uetsu's body, however, is still not yet clear to me: the other traditions that I"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"am aware of say that Kamiko's tomb is on the Ake River but say nothing about the tombof his son in Yauita. Furthermore, different from most of the other traditions ofKamiko, this says that the prophet was \"removed from the area\" and sent far away,\"beyond Manaus,\" which requires further clarification.In comparing the mortal deaths of each of the prophets with others who have arisenafter them, Kamiko sought to die \"like Christ\" -that is, revive in another place butwithout seeking vengeance, another reform in Baniwa ethics-but for many Baniwa hecontinues to be a protector. It was the same way with Uetsu, who would have died andrevived \"like Christ,\" although he sent an evil omen against his enemies, implying thatthey inevitably died shortly afterward. Many Baniwa visit Uetsu's tomb because theystill consider him a \"saint,\" and they leave coins and other items on the tomb to ask hisprotection. This prophetic consciousness (in both belief and practice) is reflected in therespect with which the Hohodene today have for another powerful paje who died in the197os. He was the father of one of my shaman-teachers and the master of various otherpajes who considered him a prophet, a \"wise man.\" According to what one of hisexapprentices explained to me several years ago, Guilherme (or Kudui) was of the Hohodene phratry; he was an exapprentice of the master-paje Kumadeyon, of the Dzauinaiphratry, who in turn was exapprentice of the paje Heriwaipe, a disciple of Kamiko. Inthe mid-195os, Kudui already had considerable fame among the Baniwa, and he advisedhis followers before dying that, \"when I die, my soul will leave my body, but I willremain with you still.\" That is, his body was buried (significantly on the island calledWarukwa, the mythical home of the creator/transformer Nhiaperikuli), but \"his thought[that is, his wisdom] still continues alive.\" His \"soul\" made the normal journey of thesouls of the dead, but later \"it came back and entered his body again, so that he couldexplain things for us,\" an exapprentice explained. People today also leave payments(coins) on top of his tomb and ask for his protection against sicknesses, evil omens, etc.,as they do with Kamiko, Uetsu, and all other wise men or prophets. In all these cases,we see a prophetic consciousness (in an earlier work [1998] I called it \"millenarianconsciousness,\" which perhaps is too Western in its connotations). The prophets, it isworth repeating, are not just any pajes but rather only those who have reached a superiorlevel of knowledge, and whose knowledge -acquired through the constant use of parikband caapi- transcends mortal time.Baniwa conversion en masse to evangelical protestantism in the 1950s and 1g6os wasthus nothing more than a deja vu experience for many. Recall that Kamiko and Uetsucounseled the people to \"throw away\" poison and to live in peace and harmony. Several"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"times in the past in Baniwa oral histories, practices and institutions have beenabandoned with the objective of producing a desired change. For example, Baniwa sibs\"abandoned\" the institution of warfare because it was leading to the end of their society-that is, warrior sibs were \"finishing off with people.\" With the objective ofreconstructing social alliances and guaranteeing a prosperous future, they \"threw away\"all of their weapons of war into the river and forgot them. In the same way, the prophetscounseled the people of various communities to \"throw away\" poison and abandon thepractice of witchcraft. Later, Sophie Muller, the North American missionary whosparked Baniwa conversion to evangelicalism told them to abandon their practices ofdrinking caxiri, smoking tobacco, and celebrating the ancient rituals. She told the pajesto \"throw away\" their instruments (rattles, stones, crystals, etc.-many of which areconsidered the shamans' weapons) into the river.There is also a notable similarity in the way in which the practices considered to behighly secret (witchcraft, shamanism, sacred flutes, and trumpets) are exposed in publicbefore being abandoned. Kamiko and Uetsu publicly indicated the people who hadpoison as well as their hiding places for it, making these people pile up their poison inthe central plaza of the village, where he then counseled them before ordering them tothrow the poison away. The converted disciples of Sophie Muller likewise went aroundto villages where they told the men to pile up the sacred flutes and trumpets-consideredhighly secret and prohibited from the sight of women and children under pain of deathby poison if exposed in public-on the central plaza of the village before they threw themaway or burned them. In the dialectical tension between states or conditions of humanexistence that are perceived to be threatened by the real existence of evil or acatastrophic end-that is, the predominance of the dark side of consciousnessand those ofharmony, unity, and prosperity-the light side of consciousness-then the means by whichsociety takes the first step to restore order is to \"throw away,\" abandon, or provoke arupture with the instruments or material of destruction and then reshape peoples'consciousness.Final ConsiderationsTogether with their campaign to eradicate witchcraft, Kamiko and Uetsu sought tocreate a new religious order by incorporating Christian ritual practices such as baptism,marriage, and Christian names with fests celebrated in the traditional styles of thepudali drinking fests. They sought to create a new mode of consciousness and a newway of living together-in short, a utopia-free from what most ruined peoples' lives:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"witchcraft. In relation to the white man, there was never any question from thebeginning that the prophets' wisdom could overcome the efforts of the \"learned men\" todestroy them.In a similar way, Sophie Muller left the control of evangelicalism in the hands of thepastors and deacons she trained, thus producing the means by which evangelicalknowledge could be transformed into the basis for the production of a new generation ofbelievers who, from then on, would reproduce this process. As I have argued elsewhere(iggg), the Baniwa understood that conversion would reestablish their communitarianway of life, drastically disorganized by the extractivist regime. To be sure, the marginalperiod of transition to the new religion was marked by intense conflicts, above allbecause what was being \"left behind\" (such as the pudali drinking fests) hadtraditionally served to administer intercommunity relations and create solidarity amongaffines, while the new order imposed another opposition between believers andnonbelievers, thus realigning already-existing political divisions into religious ones butwithout the means to administer this opposition. Thus, hostilities and (possibly)witchcraft accusations increased initially among groups as a result of the shiftsproduced in community political alignments. Furthermore, neither the explanationsoffered by the evangelical missionaries for deaths nor the means for overcoming lethalsicknesses proved to be adequate, unlike the \"knowledge\" of the prophets that survivedtheir deaths and that had a built-in guarantee of protection against evil omens. Thus,even evangelical crentes (believers) continued visiting their tombs long after Protestantconversion had solidified.Both utopias were instigated and plagued by the same destructive force: witchcraft. Inthe same way that the wise men suffered losses due to the revolt of their enemies, fromthe beginning the Baniwa detected weak points in the utopia of the evangelicals. Theproblem of evil and wickedness continued to exist, but because converts had \"thrownaway\" nearly everything that was capable of combating witchcraft (except medicinalplants, antidotes to poison, and curing spells) there was no way to go back to them, andeverything indicates that today among the crentes the abuse of witchcraft is increasingdue to new forms such as macumba introduced by the Mestizos of the city of SaoGabriel. Even so, the majority of the Baniwa continue to profess the crente religion andare also converting to the newer pentecostal religions such as the Assembly of God andSeventh Day Adventism. At the same time, however, they continue to visit the tombs oftheir wise men, nourishing the hope that perhaps through discipline and a rigorouslyordered life, or through the immortal knowledge of the wise men, the problem of evil-"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"even if it can never be eradicated because it is inherent to the nature of existence-can atleast be controlled.NotesThe research on which this paper is based was conducted in 1976-1977 for mydoctoral dissertation; and in 1997,1999, 2000, and 2001 with the generous assistanceof the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, and as collaborator of the Socio-Environmental Institute (isA) / Institut pourRecherche surDeveloppement (IRo) inthe project\"Socio- Cultural and Economic Risk Factors for HIV and Tuberculosis inthe Region of the Upper Rio Negro (Brazilian Amazon) (1998-2000).\" I am gratefulto the Hohodene shamans and elders of the Aiary River who have always taught mewith great patience and wisdom.This essay was first prepared for presentation at the session of the Society for theAnthropology of Consciousness and the Society for Latin American Anthropologyduring the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association, NewOrleans, November 2002.1 I am here distinguishing witchcraft from sorcery in a way that is different from thedefinitions used by Evans-Pritchard in his classic study (1937). For the Zande,witchcraft refers to a substance in the body of certain persons that emanates from thatperson causing injury to health and property (9); sorcery is magic that is consideredillicit or immoral and involves bad medicines and/or spells. For the Baniwa, I usewitchcraft to refer to the manipulation of poisonous substances (in contrast to theemanation of substances from the witch) for the purpose of killing. Sorcery, on theother hand, is the use of evil spells to harm or kill; anyone can practice either or both,although individuals may specialize in certain kinds of spells or in poisoning.2 Various people drew attention to the idea that manhene \"affects the blood\" of thevictim; \"sucking the blood\" inside the victim's stomach and thus producing anemia.Others observed that victims vomit so much blood that they have difficulty inrecovering from the loss; hence the body \"dries out.\" This is why tuberculosis isconsidered by traditional Baniwa to be a form of manhene.3 In my research I was able to determine fourteen different kinds of manhene; spacelimitations, however, do not permit presenting them here. In Goldman's research(1963:268-69) with the neighboring Cubeo of the Querary and Cuduiary rivers inColombia he was able to determine a number of plant poisons equivalent to those the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Baniwa knew.4 In this, they demonstrate patterns that are similar to the Cubeo. In his classicmonograph, Goldman writes that \"the arts of killing or of causing serious illness areto the Cubeo mind extraordinarily well developed. As the Indians see it, most deaths,illnesses, and misfortunes are products of human malevolence.... All ... live in dreadof sorcery\" (1963:266).5 In the early 195os, the Brazilian ethnologist Eduardo Galvao also noted that therewere three specialist roles in Baniwa society: the mariri, or shaman, who uses maracarattles and snuffs the hallucinogenic parikd to perform cures; dzuri, or chant-owner,who uses primarily orations and tobacco, mutawari; and the mah-eminare (equivalentto the manhene iminali, poison-owner), who are the sorcerers, or matidra in linguageral (Galvao 1954:164-66). My definition of sorcerer differs from that of Galvao,being restricted to the blowing of spells to inflict harm and not the use of poison tokill. On Baniwa shamanism, see Wright 1992,1996,1998; on chanters, see Hill 1993.6 For the Cubeo, Goldman distinguishes between the methods of killing undertaken bythe yavi (jaguar) shamans, and the \"nonprofessional sorcerer\" whom the Cubeofeared even more: \"The arts of sorcery, which include the arts of poisoning, areknown to all men and are believed to be used by all men\" (1963:266).7 Dreams often serve as warnings in Baniwa culture. Thus, if one dreams of a monkeyor sloth, or of being drunk on cachaga, these images refer to the danger of beingpoisoned by manhene.8 Here one is reminded of Overing's analysis of the \"aesthetics of conviviality\"(Overing and Passes 2000).9 I use the word \"spell\" and not \"chant\" to distinguish these speech forms from thoseused in curing, which may be chanted, and the special set of initiation chants calledkalidzamai. Given their very nature, these spells are never chanted but rather spoken,or thought, in secrecy. The word \"oration\" likewise is not an accurate description,referring more to the speech of community leaders.10 As with manhene, dreams may reveal to a person if she or he should be aware ofpossible sorcery attacks. For example, if a person dreams of many snakes, or ofelectric eels, or of tocandira ants-all of which have poisonous bites or stings-theseare signs of impending hiuiathi."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"11 In the research I have been conducting since 1999 with Dr. Luiza Garnelo of theUniversidade de Amazonas, we have identified some twenty different conditionsclassified under the category of hiuiathi.12 Goldman makes some very interesting observations on Cubeo yavi shamans, amongwhich he describes the method of \"dirt killing\" (identical to iupithatem) which theyavis had learned from \"Indians from the Rio Negro in Venezuela\" (1963:266-67).13 A more complete account is found in The Call of the Curassow and the Land of theGuahibo Indians (1990), the diary of two adventurers and filmmakers, Felix DiGio-vanni and Paul Beer, who in 1940-1941 traveled to the Ilanos of southeasternColombia to make a documentary film on the Guahibo of the Vichada. According tothe authors, the Guahibo were \"held in high esteem\" for their \"occult powers\" toavenge deaths and were frequently sought to perform such services by the Baniwa ofthe Atabapo River, \"to circumvent their enemies and appease the death of their lovedones.... It is their belief that a person dies because an enemy has cast a potent spellover him, from which he is unable to recover. It follows, therefore, that it is the dutyof his kinsmen to avenge his death\" (107-9). Morey and Metzger's 1974 monographon the Guahibo includes further observations that refer to the shaman's capacity toundertake vengeance at a distance, although they suggest that the sorcerer is often\"of another band\" of Guahibo: \"In most cases, the sorcery is attributed to anotherGuahibo (although almost never to a close consanguineal), emphasizing the lack ofspecific fears of other, foreign tribes\" (111). The ethnographers make no reference,however, to services performed for other peoples, such as the Baniwa.14 The response \"fear of reprisal\" was what the shamans repeatedly offered to me whenI pressed them to find out why they themselves, knowing that a certain witch hadkilled numerous people in a village, didn't simply eliminate him. Because, they said,if they themselves took vengeance, then the family of the victim could take the dirtto the Guahibo, who would then tell who was responsible and send a counterattackagainst them and their family. If it is the shaman of another distant group (and noteveryone can or is willing to make the long and dangerous journey), the question isdislocated to the outside, to shamans who are considered more powerful than theirown. And the victim of the Guahibo shamans, besides confessing the names of allthose whom he has killed, \"will bite his tongue\" and not tell who it was that paid theWanhfwa to take vengeance against him. It is an effective system, even more sobecause iupithatem is like certain kinds of witchcraft poisoning or manhene(remembering that a literal translation of this word is \"one does not know\") in that itleads to madness and there is no way of bringing it under control or of curing it by"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"orations or shamanic extraction.Baniwa shamans, however, do admit to having the power to attack other shamans ata distance and even to kill them. They say they also have the power, if paid well, toeliminate whole villages with a single blow of lightning. Thus their powers are notlimited to curing, although in relation to manhene, they insist that they do not getinvolved but rather seek the Guahibo to undertake vengeance. Finally, I think that itis consistent with the Baniwa ethos (as it is to many other South American peoples)to attribute greater shamanic powers to outside or other groups. In the history ofBaniwa prophetic movements, for example, the most powerful prophets were fromthe outside, or distant Baniwa phratries to the north. As mentioned, the Baniwa alsobelieve that the most potent poisonous plants come from the hills of southernVenezuela.15 In Morey and Metzger's 1974 monograph, they clarify the nature and power of theGuahibo shaman's rock: \"The shaman also has his magic rock (wanali), a piece ofcrystalline rock which detracts light, said to have been given to him by kuwai or oneof his familiars. The light from the crystalline mass is believed to have a deadlyeffect. Supposedly it is only necessary for the shaman to wave it in front of, or pointit at, his victim, to induce sickness or death. The rock is also used in the interests ofjustice. One ceremony involving the discovery and punishment of the partyresponsible for a death is as follows: the shaman cuts off the little finger of the lefthand of the corpse and boils it in a specific type of tree sap, all the while chantingthe appropriate formula. The rising vapor is said to flow to where the guilty sorcereris and force his humpe [spirit] to leave his body and come-whereupon it is cut up anddestroyed by the shaman wielding his magic rock (1974:113).16 The Baniwa relate that the Guahibo acquired these extraordinary powers in thefollowing manner: In ancient times, there was a shaman called Huiti Uanakale wholooked for shamans' powers, or malikhai. He obtained much power but began to losecontrol and to kill people. He transformed into an enormous black jaguar. After hehad killed many people, he went on to kill his own family: his wife's father andmother, his own wife, children, and other families. As he became more and more of amenace, his kin got together and killed him; it was Huiti Uanakale himself whorecommended that they kill him. He instructed them to burn his body, but insteadthey simply cut off his head and threw it into the river. The head floated downriverstill with its brains and the knowledge of how to cause all sicknesses and also how tocure them."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"When the head reached a place a bit above Juivitera (on the Icana River), theGuahibo shamans called Dzauinaikada got the head, took out the brains, and got allthe shamanic powers in them, thus learning all sorts of evil things. After the Guahibohad taken out the brains, the head continued on downriver, but already empty. In thattime, the Guahibo shamans were of a people called Padali (note Koch-Grunberg'sreference to the people called Pidzari), who were affines of the Baniwa of the AiaryRiver. After they had learned all these things, they began to transform into jaguars,forest-spirits, and other animals; they threw sickness-giving spirit darts onto peopleand ate people.The story goes on to tell of a man who secretly overheard four Guahibojaguarshamans planning to kill and devour the people of his village. The manforewarned the people who eventually killed the four shamans. Nevertheless, otherGuahibo had succeeded in getting their power to kill.This story reveals that the Guahibo were ancient dwellers of the Aiary, affines tothe Baniwa. They obtained extraordinarily dangerous powers to transform and killfrom an ancestral jaguar-shaman, who had lost control over his powers, and they thusbecame true \"jaguar-shamans\" or, as the Hohodene today say, parikb jaguars (dzatodzauika), permanently roaming on the edges of this world, seeking to kill and devourtheir victims. The Baniwa were able to get rid of the Guahibo as immediate andinternal threats, although these jaguar-shamans continue to be owners of dangerouspowers to kill at a distance.I am grateful to Dr. Luiza Garnelo for referring me to this story, which she obtainedin her fieldwork with the Baniwa of the Icana River in Brazil.17 The pussanga charm comes from a thin, crawling vine called munutchi that producesa powerful perfume. Girls who wish to cause harm use the leaf on boys, which causesstrong headaches: \"They start to go crazy, as though drunk, they want to run away, toflee.\" In the same way that a man who is jealous of a woman can ruin her life withpoison, women can ruin a man's life by using munutchi.18 The narrator said that, during the tests, Uetsu would perform marriages andbaptisms. He even gave the narrator's elder brother his name, which means that hewas at the height of his power when the narrator's elder brother-at that point aroundsixty-five years old-was born in the 1940s. The narrator's father, who in the 1970Swas around seventy years old, served as a rower for Uetsu."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"ReferencesACIRA (Associacao das Comunidades Indigenas do Rio Aiari) and FOIRN (Federacaodas Or- ganizacoes Indigenas do Rio Negro), eds. 1999.

Anthropologists have analyzedthese beliefs from various theoretical frameworks -as a reflection of social structure andrelationships and as a functional regulator of social equilibrium-or have examined theiruse in political and moral questions and/or in changing gender relations, or even haveshown how witchcraft and sorcery beliefs and practices are the product of social andcultural change (Dole 1973; Douglas 1991; Lyons 1998; Marwick 1965; Turner 1957;Zelenietz 1981).The \"theory of the unity of knowledge\" (Douglas 1991)-that is, that \"those who cancure can also kill,\" and the resulting ambivalence of shamanic power are welldocumented in many Amerindian societies (Brown 1988; Buchillet 1990; Crocker 1985;Hugh-Jones 1994; Overing-Kaplan 1975; Vilaga 1999). Crocker (1985:237), forexample, depicted the Bororo shaman as an \"ambiguous, suspicious personage\" andBrown (1988:104), after alluding to the \"dubious social status\" of the Aguaruna shaman,illustrated how, during the curing session, he strove to show his zeal in curing as a waynot to be suspected of trying to bewitch the sick.For the Desana Indians of the upper Rio Negro region, the great majority of illnessesthat affect people today are attributed to sorcery.' There are various forms of doingsorcery, one of which is based on evil spells that are cast in the direction of the futurevictim. Evil spells, along with their counterparts, therapeutic spells, are part of thecurrent shamanic repertory of one category of traditional healer (the kumu). As I haveshown elsewhere (Buchillet 199o), the kumu's abilities to cure and to kill derive fromthe same source: they are two complementary and intersecting developments of thesame creative mythic speech. It remains, however, to explore the implications of thisconception for the transmission of shamanic knowledge and for the kumu's therapeuticpractice. In this essay, I focus on the Desana's beliefs about poisoning and sorcery,seeking to clarify the social contexts in which sorcery suspicions occur as well as toshow their importance in indigenous cosmology and mythology. I address theimplications of these beliefs in one form of sorcery-the harm produced by evil spells-for the transmission of shamanic knowledge and the kumu's therapeutic practice. I showthat, in a certain way, sorcery beliefs impose some heavy limitations on the kumu'swork and on the dissemination of shamanic knowledge in this indigenous society."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"The Desana of the Upper Rio Negro RegionThe Desana Indians, or 14mttkoho masa, \"People of the Universe,\" are a Tukanoan-speaking people who live with other groups of the same and/or other (Arawak andMaku) linguistic families in the upper Rio Negro region of the northwest Amazon(Brazil) and in the Colombian Vaupes? Numbering approximately 1,460 individuals inBrazil, they are divided into some sixty local communities along the Uaupes Rivera (atributary of the upper Rio Negro) and its two main tributaries, the Tiquie and the Papuri,and also along some of their navigable streams-in particular, the Umari, Cucura, andCastanha rivers of the Tiquie and the Urucu River of the Papuri.The eastern Tukanoan peoples claim a common origin and history and form ahomogeneous sociocultural group, whose main characteristics include: a commonidentity established in mythic history (until the dispersion in the Uaupes region of thevarious groups' ancestors) and in ritual practices and representations; the use oflanguages belonging to the same linguistic family; and a system of kinship andmarriage founded on linguistic identity. Within this homogeneous system, the group issubdivided into exogamous units of patrilineal filiation, differentiated by language,territory of historical occupation, and a specialization in material culture. Members ofthe group are related to the other peoples of the region through a complex system ofmatrimonial alliances and/or ceremonial and economic relations. They are sedentaryand their subsistence is based on shifting cultivation of bitter manioc (Manihotesculents Cranz) combined with fishing, hunting, and gathering (fruits, insects).This apparently homogeneous system should not hide, however, several differencesamong the various groups of the region or even between the sibs of the same languagegroup. There are, for example, gradations in shamanic knowledge and also differentattitudes concerning the shamans' knowledge and practices. In fact, the distribution ofshamanic knowledge is unequal in the region. Certain groups, like the Desana, areacknowledged by others (as they recognize themselves) as specialists in matters oftherapeutic or evil spells. Others, like the Arawakan Baniwa, are renowned for theirextensive knowledge of poisonous plants and plant remedies. There are also differencesin relation to certain aspects of the kumu's therapeutic practice between the linguisticgroups (for example, spells are recited either silently or sung, or may be consideredsecret or not).Like many other indigenous groups of lowland South America,' the Desanadistinguish among various categories of traditional healers according to the source and"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"nature of their power and knowledge and curing practices: the jaguar-shaman (yee) andthe blower of spells (kumu). The yee, who derives his power from direct contact withspirits during a trance induced by the ingestion of hallucinogenic snuff (Virola spp.and/or Anadenanthera peregrina), is said to have the ability to transform himself into ajaguar in order to accomplish his goals and, in ways similar to the classical shaman asdescribed in the ethnographic literature, effects cures by means of blowing tobaccosmoke, massage, and sucking out pathogenic objects from the body and spitting themaway. The yee is described as being able to see the illness inside the patient's body andto divine the cause of the evil, a capacity strictly associated in Desana thought with theinhalation of the hallucinogenic snuff. By contrast, the kumu's skills and reputationstem from his great knowledge and mastery of mythology and of spells to protect, cureand/or harm. Their curing ritual consists of the inaudible recitation of highly formalizedtherapeutic spells over the opening of a gourd (Lagenaria siceria Mol.) containing aliquid (water, boiled manioc juice, manioc flour gruel, or fruit juice, etc.) that is latergiven to the patient to drink, or over a plant that the kumu then rubs onto the patient'ssick body-part. This liquid or plant gives the spell a material support and transfers it tothe patient (Buchillet 1990, 1992).In the past, these shamanic specialists had complementary functions: the yee effectingthe diagnosis through a visionary or ecstatic state and through the sucking out from thepatient's body harmful objects that symbolize the disease substance: the kumu\"undoing\" (as the Indians say) the disease process and restoring the bodily integrity ofthe patient through specific spells. These two functions, traditionally reserved for men,could be assumed by a single individual if, evidently, he had been trained in bothpractices. Among the Tukanoan-speaking groups, the yea (plural form of yee) havevirtually disappeared as a result of the intolerant campaigns waged against them by thefirst Catholic Salesian missionaries. Since their installa tion in the region in thebeginning of the twentieth century, these missionaries denounced shamanic practice as\"charlatanism,\" destroyed the ancient communal households, robbed the yee'sdiagnosing and curing instruments (gourd rattles, wooden darts, quartz crystals, snufftubes, etc.), broke the pots of hallucinogenic drugs, etc. They are, in other words,responsible for the gradual disappearance of the jaguar-shamans, whom they perceivedas the principal obstacles to Christian influence and as the main opponents to theirpresence and authority.Whereas some yea fled from the missionaries to the lower Rio Negro, others,considering that there was no chance for traditional culture to survive, refused to pass"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"on their knowledge to apprentice shamans and also eventually abandoned their practice.Certain features of the kumu's curing session-for example, its private and silentcharacter-probably explain why this specialist survived missionary intolerance. As wehave seen, the kumu's practice is essentially based on the inaudible recitation of spells.Unlike the classic shamanic curing session, it does not require any public ceremonywhich must, or may, be attended by others. It is a solitary ritual. As I have shownelsewhere (Buchillet 1992), there is nothing to hear or even see. For this reason, thecuring session is not thought of as a means of acquiring shamanic knowledge, as isusually the case in indigenous societies. Moreover, it is not a way for the kumu todemonstrate his knowledge or his skills to others in order to assert his reputation.Exogenous Pathogenesis as Etiological Category amongthe Desana PeopleAccording to the Desana, the majority of traditional (or indigenous) illnesses are theresult of exogenous aggression. This emphasis on exogenous pathogenesis is explicit inthe vernacular term most commonly used to designate \"illness\": doreri. As a substantiveform of the verb dore (\"to send to,\" \"to give an order to,\" to command\"), doreri qualifiesthe way the ailments that are imputed either to aggressions of aquatic and forest spirits(or animals) or to human malevolence are transmitted.'In the first category (wai [yuk-u]-mash doreri, literally \"sicknesses of the water andforest peoples\"), illnesses are the result of an error of the sick person (dietarytransgression, breaking rules concerning the cooking of game animals, abusive use ofhunting charms, excessive hunting, etc.) and/or of others (the kumu's involuntaryforgetting of animal or spirit names during the recitation of protective spells in the lifecycle rites or during the shamanic ritual to decontaminate food, for example). Illnessesattributed to aquatic or forest animals and spirits generally appear in an ambiguousfashion through a set of imprecise symptoms: headaches, fevers, nausea, diges tivedisorders, vomiting, nightmares, nonanxious recurrent dreams, muscular pains, backpains, sores, and so forth (see Buchillet 1983).In relation to the second category, it should be noted that the indigenous languages ofthe region possess various terms to refer to sorcery-that is, to the conscious andintentional act to cause harm to a specific person or community, depending on theidentity of the person who practices it and/or on the means used to do it. Sorcery hasgreat importance as a cause of illness and death in sib genealogies, and it is one of the"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"main causes of disorders that affect human beings today. It can be done through avariety of means, some of which presuppose a high degree of specialized knowledge ofevil spells, or a special knowledge of poisonous plants.Nima ttt6ri refers to the common form of sorcery using cultivated or wild vegetalpoisonous substances that are secretly put in the victim's food or drink and/or applied orrubbed onto an object that he or she uses. It is generally practiced during communitydrinking parties (widely known in the region by the lingua geral term of caxiri, referringto a mildly fermented beverage made from manioc mixed with seasonal fruits) orduring intercommunity ceremonial exchange festivals, known as dabucuri, in whichfood or objects are exchanged. The effects of these poisonous substances, which are saidto work rapidly, are quite varied depending on the nature of the plant used, but theyfrequently include digestive disorders, coughing, spitting blood, appetite and weightloss, etc.The more serious ailments, which can eventually result in death, are supposedly curedonly by specific counterpoisons. The use of poisonous plants to cause harm, misfortune,or injury is accessible to anyone and is not reserved to one sex: men or women whoknow about some plants can make use of them against others. In contrast to the Baniwa,there is no specialization in the use of poisonous plants (the \"poison-owner,\" asdescribed by Wright in this volume); nor does this form of sorcery require a high degreeof esoteric knowledge or skill. To manipulate poisonous plants is, however, considereddangerous. For this reason, there are protective rules that are to be followed by theperson who makes use of them. In particular, he or she must be careful not to touch theplants with his or her hands in order not to be poisoned. Several deaths recorded in sibgenealogies were actually interpreted as a consequence of the failure to respect thissimple precaution. According to several Desana, there is a special place in Baniwaterritory replete with poisonous plants. This place is located near the Uapui rapids onthe Aiari River, the mythical birthplace of all the Arawakan-speaking peoples of theregion. There, Kuwai, the mythic hero of the Baniwa and Tariana peoples, was burned todeath because he \"killed\" young boys who were being initiated. All the plants that latergrew on this spot are said to be poisonous.' As a precaution, everyone who goes theretoday to get poison ous plants must put the liquid of specific plants in his or her eyes inorder to avoid being poisoned.Dohari refers to the harm caused by evil spells that are silently cast, by a kumu or bysomeone who knows evil spells, in the direction of a person when he or she is nearby, oron a cigarette when he or she is spatially distant. It is said that the smoke of the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"cigarette transports the evil spell to the intended target. Spells can also be blown on acigarette butt left by the victim and then buried in front of his or her house. Through theuse of specific spells, the kumu can introduce into his victim's body objects, plants,substances, or animals, making them develop inside the body and/or causing the bodypart affected by the foreign element to deteriorate. Plants and objects can also bemanipulated by the kumu so that they affect a person through simple physical contact,provoking illnesses.Dohari is a form of specialized sorcery that is based on acquired knowledge, theaccess to which is limited to certain specialists. It can inflict all kinds of diseases,varying in severity, which can either be easily cured or are highly resistant to therapy.The victim will either recover fairly quickly or die. This depends on the intent of thekumu who may choose to send an illness that the sib or the language group of the victimdoes not know how to cure. In this case, the victim will die. Some of the ailments arelocalized, affecting a determined part of the body as, for example, inguinal tumor withno sores or wounds, breast tumor, local swelling, menstrual colic, etc. However, somewasting away and/or chronic illnesses, which produce persistent weight loss (such astuberculosis), are also attributed to dohari. It can also be the cause of various kinds ofmisfortunes, as, for example, making a good worker turn into someone who does notwant to work anymore, or making a person turn into an alcoholic or addict to coca-powder or tobacco; making a woman barren, abort repeatedly, die in childbirth, givebirth to dead or defective children, or have a difficult delivery; cause unpleasantdreams; prevent a person from marrying another; and so on. But an evil kumu canequally intervene in cycles of nature by, for example, destroying crops or affecting thefertility of plants and animals. He can also provoke floods, thus preventing people fromgoing to their manioc gardens or to fish, and making trees and plants weep (seediscussion below). Illnesses attributed to spell-blowing are only curable by the sorcereror by another kumu if he knows its mythic origin (i.e., how the mythic hero brought theillness into being) in order to reverse the disease process.Yee-weheri refers to sorcery practiced by the jaguar-shaman through the projection ofa pathogenic object (dart, thorn, tuft of hair, tiny stone, quartz crystal, fur, piece ofcotton, etc.) into the victim's body, thus provoking various kinds of physical disorderssuch as, for example, rheumatic pains, local swellings, or tumors. It is also said that hecan throw an illness onto his victim's body like a garment.Birari refers to collective assault sorcery effected either by the kumu who recites anevil spell on a cigarette that he buries at a definite spot at the entrance of a village, or by"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"a yee through a lightning bolt. It differs from individual forms of sorcery in thedimension of the attack and from epidemics attributed to contact with the whites andtheir objects, on the basis of spatial and temporal contiguity: whereas collective assaultsorcery affects three or more persons of a single community at the same time, theepidemics attributed to contact with the whites disseminate from a starting point,gradually affecting all the communities of the same river (see Buchillet 1995). Variousepidemics of fevers (possibly of malarial origin) and of diarrhea reported in the regionwere attributed to collective assault sorcery. Birari is a strong motive for members of avillage to abandon it because it is \"too poisoned.\"'Bib-soarine is the term used to refer to countersorcery, which consists in sendingaggression back to the sorcerer. There are different techniques for doing this, but themost usual consists in taking remains of the deceased's body (hair, nail clippings, bodilyexcretions, facial or bodily dirt) that are then cooked in a pot with pitch and variouskinds of peppers. The ritual is performed secretly, in an isolated place, in order not to beseen. When the content of the pot starts to boil, it is said that the sorcerer begins tosuffer from stomach and abdominal pains. From time to time, the kumu, or a member ofthe victim's family who uses this technique of countersorcery, goes back to hiscommunity to verify if someone is complaining of pain. If the presumed sorcerer livesin another community, the kumu supposes that he is suffering. Then, he decides tocontinue or not. If not, he takes the pot off the fire and the presumed culprit is relievedof his pains. If he decides to continue, he lets the pot boil for a long time until thealleged sorcerer dies. It is said that when the sorcerer's identity is discovered, a bee fallsinto the cooking pot. In reality, it is the kumu who strikes at a nearby bee and thenthrows it into the pot. The bee is said to represent the spirit/heart of the sorcerer. Whenit falls into the pot, the pains in the sorcerer's stomach and belly increase, he begins topuff and blow, bloody foam comes out of his nose and mouth, and he dies. Some Desanasay that the kumu can also blow a spell onto a cigarette. The smoke of the cigaretteserves to unite the heart/spirit of the sorcerer and then takes it back to the kumu. Theheart/spirit arrives in the form of a bee that the kumu strikes and throws into thecooking pot. This is the technique of countersorcery generally used by the kumu who,unlike the yee, does not have the visionary power that allows him to divine the identityof a sorcerer and to kill him through a lightning bolt or the projection of disease ontohis body. At the same time that it per mits the identification of the sorcerer, thistechnique sends the aggression back to him, killing him. It is considered to be aninfallible means for finding the culprit. In other words, it is not necessary for thealleged sorcerer to admit his guilt: his very death reveals it. Various deaths in Desana"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"genealogies are imputed to countersorcery and several people admitted that they mayuse this technique of retaliation in specific circumstances.It is no exaggeration to say that the great majority of the adult population of the upperRio Negro region has relatives or friends who believe that they have been the victims ofsome form of the sorcery attacks described above. In the following sections I examinethe beliefs and practices related to dohari, the form of specialized sorcery practicedthrough evil spells that are cast on a person or on an object that he or she uses.The Social Context of Sorcery Suspicions and the Origin of Envyand Sorcery in the WorldThe Desana are rarely at a loss to explain why someone would want to cause harm tolocal group members or to anyone else with whom the relationship is close. Theirexplanations invariably center on envy, jealousy, revenge for conflicts over theft in themanioc gardens, refusal to give or to lend something, meanness, insults, anger, orvengeance for some harm or injustice done by the victim. All these are motives for thedesire to harm another or to suspect someone of using sorcery against another. Facedwith an ailment, the sick person will examine his or her relations with relatives andneighbors in order to identify in his or her recent or past conduct the signs of an enmitythat could possibly explain the sorcery attack.Sorcery suspicions can also arise between persons not related and even belonging todifferent language groups but in close contact with each other. For example, one manwas suffering from rheumatic pains in one knee that he attributed to an evil spell cast onhim by a Maku Indian after a conflict with him. According to him, the Maku used tosteal coca plants (Erythroxy- Ion coca var. ipadu) from his manioc garden to make cocapowder for his own use. One day he scolded him, accusing him of stealing the cocaplants. The Maku Indian responded furiously that he would never again eat his cocapowder. Later on, this man began to suffer pains in one knee which he immediatelyattributed to an act of sorcery by the Maku Indian, thinking, \"he is doing harm to mebecause I scolded him.\" According to KochGriinberg (1995 [1903-19051:277), sorcerysuspicions against Maku Indians were in the past a strong motive to lead an attack ontheir houses and steal their women and children.The Tukanoan-speaking peoples frequently use Maku people as a scapegoat. If aTukano Indian dies from a mysterious illness, the ritual healer tries to divine theidentity of the enemy who bewitched the deceased and, very often, the suspicion falls on"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"a Maku Indian. The family of the deceased goes to revenge the \"crime\" and attacks theculprit and robs women and children to sell later to the whites.Competition over women, frustrated love affairs, or personal rejection are also strongmotives to harm people. The refusal of a matrimonial union by a woman or by herparents can lead to a sorcery attack as a kind of revenge of the type \"if she can't bemine, she won't be anyone else's.\" Depending on his intent, the sorcerer can send a mildor a lingering illness to the woman. He can also send a disfiguring illness to make herugly as a way of preventing her from marrying someone else. After she has married, hecan interfere with her ability to give birth, making her abort repeatedly or causing her togive birth only to females. Many women's illnesses, such as barrenness, difficultchildbirth, stillbirth, and recurrent miscarriages have been associated by the kumua(plural form of kumu) with the refusal of the parents to give their daughter as a spouseto someone.Prestige, status, wealth, or success (material or political, for example), howevertemporary or qualified (i.e., depending on the person's work), inevitably arouses envyand ill will among neighbors, close kin, and others not so lucky or successful. Becauseof this, a prudent person will never boast of his accomplishment or wealth so as not toarouse the envy and resentment of others. Such resentment often leads to evil desiresthat result in actions performed either by the man or the woman harboring the antipathyor jealousy toward the person-if he or she knows how to do it-or through a specialisthired for this task. But, unlike what seems to happen, for example, among the Kuikuru(Dole 1966) or the Aguaruna (Brown 1988), sorcery suspicions rarely lead to publicaccusations or result in overt violence or confrontation against the alleged sorcerer thatmay eventually lead to his homicide. They circulate, above all, in malicious gossipand/or in private conversations. Should vengeance be sought it will be in secret, viacountersorcery. Nevertheless, veiled suspicions and accusations have sometimesobliged the presumed sorcerer to disappear from the community, going to livetemporarily or permanently in another village. In such cases various yea or kumuasuspected of being responsible for several diseases in their own community were thusobliged to flee and take up residence elsewhere.Sorcery is not solely used against common people, nor are envy or jealousysentiments experienced only by common people. A headman or a political leader withgreat visibility, a yee or a kumu known for his frequent successes in therapy or even amaster of dances and chants (bard), can also become the object of envy, resentment, andother antisocial sentiments. One man well known for his great ability to chant related to"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"me how during a festival in another village he suddenly lost his voice, then immediatelyblamed the headman of the other community for putting sorcery on him because of theheadman's jealousy of his great knowledge. He then threatened the headman withretaliation if he didn't recover his voice, which, fortunately, he regained a few dayslater. This ever-present possibility of being bewitched generally prevents the kumufrom talking about his knowledge to someone else. In fact, in contrast with the shamansof other indigenous societies, such as the Warao (see Wilbert 1996), for example, whogain their status and reputation by demonstrating their talents and skills, the kumuavoids speaking about his knowledge and power to another kumu or even to members ofhis own community. He would never openly assert, for example, that he knowsmythology perfectly well, that he is the only one who knows a certain potent therapeuticor evil spell, or that he is the only one who is able to cure a serious illness. He shouldnot be obligated to demonstrate his talents or enter into a kind of dispute or competitionof power and knowledge with another kumu-a situation that will only produce illnessesand deaths in the community. The following narrative was told to me by the kumuAmerico, from Cucura River:\"One day, in a moment of tension and enmity, during a discussion, one kumu began toboast of himself by saying he is very knowledgeable and that he is able to steal theheart/spirit of a person. Another kumu answers that he too is very knowledgeable. In theheat of the discussion they decide to show to each other their knowledge, their shamanicpower. They begin to insult each other, and one says `You don't know anything! I willshow you how to do this' [i.e., how to steal the heart/spirit of a person]. Furious, theother casts a spell in his direction or against other people, causing illnesses.According to some Desana, in the past there were power disputes between kumua,mainly over questions of hierarchy; but the correct way of being a shaman prohibitsthese kinds of struggles, which can only provoke various kinds of bodily disorders anddeaths. Nevertheless, it is necessary to point out here that, as a way of preventingconflict with another person if he refuses to teach him or her a special spell (forexample after a curing session), the kumu can resort to some subterfuge based inmythology. In the Desana myth of the origin of night in the world, Namiri mas±, the\"Master of the Night,\" who did not want to teach the primordial ancestors of humanitythe rituals to install the alternation of day and night in the world, made them fall asleepduring his explanations by making them fix their attention on the designs of the bencheson which they were seated. Today, the Desana kumu can make use of this stratagemwhen he is explaining a spell to a sick person or to a member of his or her family who is"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"not a direct relative in order to prevent him or her from listening attentively to it. It isimportant to specify here that, for the Desana Indians, spells are secret-they constitutethe property of specific sibs and, traditionally, can only be taught by the father kumu toone of his sons.A lack of respect for a very knowledgeable man (a headman, a yee, or a kumu, forexample) or even the simple refusal to give him something he requests, are also said tobe strong motives for sorcery. Various epidemics of malaria or diarrhea that, in the past,devastated specific communities of the region were attributed to the ill will of a yee orof a kumu, who was angered because he felt that he had not been shown respect orbecause a member of his own family refused to give him something he asked for.Finally, sorcery can be used as a way of calling attention to the disappearance of avery important man and, at the same time, serves as a form of retaliation for his death.In 1993 a man from the Cucura River, Dorvalino, related to me how his grandfathermade it rain for ten days after the death of Garafa, a very knowledgeable kumu: \"Garafawas very old. He walked entirely bent over. His family didn't treat him well. They didn'tgive food to him. When he died, my grandfather was so furious that he made it rainwithout stop for ten days. He did this to take revenge on the family of Garafa (who didnot treat him well when he was alive) and also to call attention to the fact that a veryknowledgeable person, a great connoisseur of mythology, was dead. He made it rain forten days. People could not go to the manioc gardens because of the rain. They could notgo to fish or to hunt because of the rain. It seems likely that the trees, the termite nests,were weeping. All of nature was crying. One day, after a reunion, various communityheadmen asked my grandfather to make the rain stop.\"This form of revenge for the death of someone important, which can put humansurvival itself at risk, is well documented in mythology. The Desana myth of Baaribo,the \"Master of Food,\" shows how he wept for the death of his youngest son, who waskilled by his elder brother because he had sexual relationships with his sister-in-law:\"Baaribo was weeping for his son. To accompany him in his weeping, he made it rain.He invited also the birds, the animals, the fishes, the stones, the trees, the trunks, thetermite nests ... to weep with him for the death of his loved son. He wept for the deathof his son with the whole world.... He made it rain and he wept with the entire world. Hewanted to sink into the earth with all the plants. Because of the death of his son, hewanted to punish all of humanity\" (Fernandes and Fernandes 1996:83). Based on thispassage of myth, there is a spell that is used to weep for the death of an importantperson or for someone who during his life was disdained by members of his own"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"community: \"For example, the son of a headman, angered because of the death of hisfather, does as Baaribo did in this myth. [As in the myth] summer ends. When someonegoes to the forest, to fish or to the manioc garden, he only meets animals weeping.Afraid of this, the persons who do not know where to go anymore, die of hunger\"(Fernandes & Fernandes 1996:83).Indigenous political leaders are also subject to envy and jealousy because of theirgreater visibility. Two indigenous leaders in the region died recently of very strange anddebilitating illnesses that, in one case, Western medicine couldn't diagnose properly.Another one was, at various times, strongly warned to stop his work as a leader if hedidn't want to be killed (i.e., to be poisoned or bewitched). As in many other societiescharacterized by an egalitarian ideology, greater visibility, prestige, wealth, orknowledge - even when acquired by much work-are not tolerated. In fact, envy,jealousy, and the desire to poison or bewitch another have always existed in the world,and there is general agreement in the region that Bupu, \"Grandfather Thunder,\" isresponsible for this state of affairs. He is considered the creator and master of harm, themaster of evil intentions and deeds,' and a myth credits to him the first act of evil in theworld. Angered because Boreka, the principal Desana ancestor, and his younger brotherToaramtt-yee, did not consult him before undertaking the transformation of humanity,Bupu, who wanted to be the master of the universe, magically put a poisonous snake(Bothrop sp.) under the tree that the two brothers intended to use to make thetransformation canoe that would serve to transport the primordial humanity to the upperRio Negro region.' The snake bit Toaram}r-yee, who then died, but Boreka brought himback to life through a therapeutic spell (see Buchillet 1983). This was the first evil actin the world, and it is considered to be the origin of sorcery.Various Desana myths clearly depict the ambivalence in relationships among mythicancestors and, above all, the sentiment of envy (idturiri ). Once introduced into theworld, envy became a malignancy that grew by itself. Today, people are said to do harmto others if they are seen to work well, fish well, have numerous sons, have high-yielding manioc gardens, etc. Envy, the desire to do harm, and illnesses are consideredto be the heritage left by the mythical ancestors and, today, they constitute aneverpresent threat or possibility.The Mythical Origin of the Illnesses That AffectHumanity Today"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"According to indigenous ideology, all illnesses which are imputed to evil spell-blowing (dohari) have a mythical origin.10 Some are the consequence of the disregardof a cultural rule by some mythical ancestor. The Desana myth of the introduction ofthe pupunha palm fruit (Guilielma speciosa Mart.) into the human world is, forexample, one of the origin myths of inguinal tumor and localized swellings. Accordingto this myth, the De sana culture hero, married to a woman of the water-people world,wanted a pupunha pit, which belonged to the water people, in order to plant it in thehuman world. Because his father-in-law refused to give him one, the Desana culturehero took advantage of the moment when the pupunha fruits were cooking,\" in order toget the pits that he then hid in various hollows of his body (groin, armpit, mouth, anus,behind the knee, etc.) to prevent his father-in-law from recovering them. Today,swellings may occur in every part of the body where he concealed the fruit pits. Inreality, this myth is essentially about matrimonial alliances and dietary categories. Thecreation of the inguinal tumor refers to the antisocial attitude of the Desana's fatherin-law, who broke the rule of food exchange between affines by refusing to give to his son-in-law the fruit pit that symbolizes his own world (see Buchillet 1983). Other mythsalso associate the creation of a determined illness with some transgression. In all ofthem, the creation of a determined illness-which was inherited by humanity-establishes,by contrast, the social, ritual, or cultural norm transgressed. It is, in a sense, the symbolor the metaphor of the infraction of a specific rule.The creation of an illness can also result from the attempt by a mythical hero to tryout his knowledge in order to test its efficacy. One myth recounts how, for example,Butari goamtt involuntarily created numerous ailments when he wanted to verify thepositive (therapeutic) and/or negative (illnessproducing) potency of the varioustherapeutic and evil spells he knew. In a sense, these myths constitute an a posteriorivalidation of the real efficacy of the spells that form the current repertory of any kumu.But they also illustrate a fundamental point in indigenous thought about the reversiblecharacter of therapeutic spells; that is, that the use of a therapeutic spell out of contextruns the risk of reverting its power, transforming it into a pathogenic weapon.The mythical creation of an illness can also result from a joke or game of somespecific mythic hero. For example, the ailment known as w-Hm6r6r5, a kind of throatinflammation that continues today to affect the Desana people, is the consequence ofthe two mythical brothers called Diroa chewing various kinds of peppers in order tomake a cord with their spiced saliva. This illness is the product of their game.In fact, every illness has one or more specific myths that recount how it was created in"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"mythical times. In this sense, each ailment and also each symptom are the physicalexpression of a specific mythic event. In the context of illness, myths are known asbayiri pagltsttma \"the fathers of the spells\"; that is, they are the \"trunk\" or the \"root\" ofthe spells (Buchillet iggo). The relation between mythic narratives and the origin ofillnesses is a form of esoteric knowledge. Outside of the specific circumstances of akumu's training, the narrator of the myth does not specify that a speci- fled action of adetermined mythic or cultural hero gave rise to a particular disease. The knowledge ofthe etiological dimension of the myth is traditionally reserved to the kumu, being partof his training. To know the origin of a specific illness (i.e., how it was formed duringmythical times) gives the bearer of this knowledge the power to cure it. But thisknowledge can also be used for aggression.In fact, the revelation of the mythic foundation of an illness reveals its essence. As thekumua frequently say, \"only the one who knows how a specific illness was created inmythology is able to cure it\" or, alternatively, \"to cure a specific illness you have toknow how to provoke it\" (Buchillet 1983, lggo). It is important to point out, however,that in order to cure or cause a specific illness, the kumu's knowledge must not belimited to the mythology of its origin.According to Americo, \"to put sorcery on someone or to succeed in curing someoneyou have to know the mythology very well, not only the myth related to the specificillness you want to cure or to provoke, but all mythology. Every word of a specific spellhas many senses, it has also many correspondences with other myths.\"Therapeutic and evil spells are constructed around the actions of mythic heroes orancestors that were sanctioned by (or led to) the creation of specific illnesses imputedtoday to the blowing of evil spells. The disclosure of the points \"where one pushes outthe spells\" (Beksta 1968; Buchillet 1983) as that of the mythic origin of the illnesses, isan essential part of the kumu's apprenticeship. A true kumu knows how to cure as wellas kill. The intimate relationship between therapeutic and evil spells is well attested bythe shamanic denomination of the latter: bayiri pera maara \"the companions of the(therapeutic) spells\" (Buchillet lggo). Spells are the essence of the kumu's power. Theyconstitute-like the darts, crystals, arrows, etc. of the yee-his defenses and his weapons.As we have seen, like magical darts, they can be shot into the victim's body and causevarious ailments. In other words, spells are efficacious in themselves, and they mayaffect the intimate experience of the individual."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Consequences of Sorcery Beliefs for the Transmission ofShamanic Knowledge and for the Kumu's Therapeutic PracticeIt seems likely that the knowledge of the means to cure and to harm was notwidespread in the past. According to the Desana, therapeutic and evil spells were firsttaught by Boreka to other Desana ancestors, who later on passed on their knowledge tothe ancestors of certain Tukanoan groups as part of their cultural patrimony, beforetheir dispersion in the Uaupes area. Americo states: \"In Ipanore [on the middle Uaupesriver], the ancestors of humanity knew nothing [i.e., how to cure and how to do evil].After Boreka descended from the sky, he began to teach the other Desana ancestors themeans to cure and the means to do sorcery.... He explained to them, as we are doingwith you: `this mythology provoked this or that illness.' The learning lasted a long time.It is Boreka who created the therapeutic and evil spells. As he was very old, he knewexactly what happened [in the world], he knew perfectly well how all these things[illnesses] were created. This was not the case of the Pam-Hri masa [name of theprimordial ancestors of humanity] who were totally ignorant when they arrived inIpanore. Later on, our ancestors began to divide their knowledge with some otherlanguage-groups ancestors.It is for this reason that the Desana are recognized as specialists (as they acknowledgethemselves to be) in matters of therapeutic and evil spells. Since their transmission byBoreka, spells have been passed down almost virtually unchanged\" through thegenerations along the patrilinear line, from a kumu to one of his sons.13 A spiritual linebinds the actual kumua to the first ancestors holding this knowledge and, according toindigenous ideology, this shamanic genealogy is essential to the efficacy of the spells(see Buchillet 1983, 1992).Spells that belong to a specific sib cannot be passed on to members of other languagegroups or even to other Desana sibs 14 They are, along with the sets of personal names,songs, musical flutes and trumpets, body paintings, and weaving designs, the ritualproperty of the sib, a symbol of its identity. For this reason, ideally, each sib (and, afortiori, each language group) has a specific knowledge in matters of therapeutic andevil spells and also of the mythic origin of the illnesses.15 However, such strongemphasis on spiritual genealogy by the Desana kumua must not be taken too literally. Infact, it does not preclude them from teaching a cousin, a nephew, or even a sonin-law(who is always of another group, according to the rule of languagegroup exogamyamong the Tukanoan-speaking peoples) some therapeutic spells that might help themface certain family problems (difficulties in delivery or minor ailments). But they will"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"never teach them evil spells, the knowledge of which is traditionally restricted to a son.Needless to say, the kumu's cousin, nephew, or son-in-law are in no way considered askumua, and their skills for curing are limited to the family sphere.At the same time that they point out the importance of the spiritual genealogy thatbinds the actual kumua to their ancestors, old Desana kumua complain of the frivolityof their colleagues of other language groups who agree to teach therapeutic spells forspecific illnesses, including the corresponding evil spells, to anyone. This critique iswell-founded. For some of the other language groups of the upper Rio Negro region-as,for ex ample, the Arawakan Tariana peoples, with whom I have been working since1999-therapeutic spells are not secret and, theoretically, they can be taught to anyoneinterested in them. However, given local beliefs about the prevalence of sorcery,Tariana kumua think that it is better for a person who is interested in knowing a spellnot to learn it with someone of another language group. This is to prevent an innocentman from being taught an evil spell, instead of a therapeutic one, without himsuspecting it. This, according to one Tariana kumu, actually happened in the past, withthe result that the man who learned the spell killed, without him understanding why, hisown sick kin during a curing session.The importance of sorcery beliefs in Desana society also has consequences for thekumu's therapeutic practice. In order not to be suspected of intending to bewitch a sickperson, he will never propose to attempt to heal him or her, even if he knows the illness.In this way, he can even let the sick person die. According to Americo, \"the kumu isvery afraid of explaining to others [an unrelated person] his knowledge.... He prefers tolet the others die than to be forced to say and show what he knows. If he is invited tocure someone, he must accept to do it, but he will never say first that he knows how tocure a specific illness, in order not to be obliged to explain afterwards what he did,which spell he used.\"This is something that health professionals who work in the upper Rio Negro regionhave great difficulties understanding: it is too distant from their own ideology based onHippocrates's oath, which claims the right and the obligation to treat any sick person,even against his or her own will. For the Indians, the sick, or his or her family in case heor she is very ill, has to ask the kumu to treat illness, and in this case he can't declinethe demand. The household that requested his service will then prepare the object (partof a plant or liquid) on which he will recite the spell. Generally, after the curing sessionthe kumu explains more or less precisely to the patient or to a member of his or herfamily the spell he used against the illness. This is to protect himself from being"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"suspected of having bewitched his patient in case the illness worsens. However, thepreciseness of his explanations greatly varies according to his proximity with thepatient. For the Desana kumu, only a member of his own biological family has the rightto know exactly the text of the spell used. For relatives and/or nonrelated patients, hewill simply give the name of the spell he used and make a rapid summary of what hedid through the spell: \"I did this,\" \"I took this or that,\" etc.\"Are the Kumua Morally Ambiguous?It remains now to examine whether the intimate relationship reported betweentherapeutic and evil spells is a motive for doubting and fearing the power of the kumua.In other words, do they use their knowledge in harmful ways against others? In fact, allkumua with whom I have worked are convinced that sorcery is something verydangerous. As Raimundo from Umari River explained to me in 1985: \"Sorcery is likethe coca-powder calabash: it always goes back to the sender. For example, I am seatedhere with my coca calabash: I pass it to my neighbor who passes it to his neighbor andso forth, until the calabash returns to me. It is the same for sorcery: I put something[through evil spells] inside the body of someone else. One day, this thing will bereturned to me and I myself will be bewitched. This is the danger of sorcery!\"Because of this latent danger of sorcery, and of the specific reasons related to thekumu's training, the Desana kumua with whom I have worked admitted that they willonly make use of evil spells for one highly justified reason: to retaliate the death froman illness induced by sorcery of a family member (parents, wife, or child). With theexception of this circumstance, all affirmed that they never intend to make use of theirknowledge against others, even when they are invited to do so by someone withpayment. Such conviction expressed by my informants in a way has to do with thekumu's training itself.As I have shown elsewhere (Buchillet lggo), therapeutic and evil spells are taught intwo separate phases of learning. Myths and therapeutic spells are taught first. When thefather decides that his son understands perfectly well both the spells as well as themultiple dimensions embodied in myths, the neophyte is initiated into the world of evilspells. In the second phase, the training is closed by a ceremony, performed by thefather for his son, which has two main purposes: first, it prevents the novice from beingspoiled by the evil spells he has learned; second, it leaves the two forms of knowledgedormant in separate parts of his body. It is as if this ceremony, which highlights thedangerous character of the shamanic knowledge of the kumu, conferred to him the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"power of oblivion, and the knowledge is only supposed to be remembered in a concretesituation (the curing of a sick person, for example). Whereas the therapeutic spells areput into his brain, the evil ones are placed in his belly, where they are covered andmaintained at the bottom by numerous calabashes and/or baskets. This ceremony is saidto prevent the novice from an untimely use of his knowledge. It protects him from thedangers of experimenting \"just to see,\" which would do nothing but provoke needlessillnesses. As described earlier, the dangers of testing the knowledge out of context arewell illustrated by a number of myths. The ceremony also prevents the two kinds ofspells from getting mixed during the curing session-the kumu remembering at the sametime both the therapeutic and the evil spells-thus involuntarily worsening the state ofhis patient. Finally, it exercises a kind of inner control over the kumu's own emotions,thereby preventing him from reacting aggressively in a moment of tension, enmity, oranger. According to Raimundo: \"With this ceremony, the kumu does not worry anymoreabout what he knows; he will not speak about his knowledge or even think ofexperimenting with what he has learned. It is just when he meets a sick person that hewill remember the therapeutic spells.... If he does not have this protection, hesuffocates. The two knowledges stay on top of his tongue, the evil spells disturb histhoughts. When he wants to cure a sick person, the therapeutic spell gets mixed with theevil one, and the sick person worsens. When he has this protection, he only remembersthe therapeutic spell, the evil one stays at the bottom of his belly ... When he has thisprotection, he does not even think of bewitching someone in a moment of anger, oftension.\"ConclusionThe data examined in this paper show that, as in many other societies, indigenous orothers, sorcery suspicions arise mainly in contexts of envy, jealousy, resentment, orsituations of inequality, etc., and are frequently attrib - uted to disturbed, problematic,or alienated relationships. But suspicions, as we have seen, may remain vague andunformulated, and accusations are seldom made in public. If we attempt to analyze thematerial on harm through evil spell-blowing in the context of the distinction establishedby Evans-Pritchard (1937) between witchcraft and sorcery, it can be seen that, a priori,the distinction has no precise counterpart in Desana thinking. This is the case for fourspecific reasons: first, evil presumes a deliberate and conscious action; second, the curemust be addressed to a specific person (or community, in the case of birari) in order tobe effective, and in this way the cure presupposes a clear idea about the identity of theperson against whom the evil deed will be directed; third, evil spell-blowing is"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"considered to be a learned skill; and fourth, because of the mythic origin of illness,aggression, and cure, the kumu may choose which kind of bodily disorder or misfortunehe wants to provoke. In this way, for the Desana Indians evil depends above all on amalefic intention and a certain knowledge about the means to do it.As we have seen, however, evil spells, the knowledge of which is said to have beenstrictly reserved in the past to the kumu's son as apprentice, are made dormant in a partof his body so that he does not have to worry about them. At the same time, old Desanakumua today complain of the high incidence of illnesses associated with the blowing ofevil spells. In 1986, Feliciano, from the Tiquie River region, told me that \"in the formertimes, there were not as many illnesses as today: the kumua knew how to defend[people] against them, how to undo the process of illness ... Nowadays, everyone wantsto do it, everyone wants to recite a spell without being prepared to do it. The one who isnot well prepared tries immediately to exercise his knowledge; he attempts to prove[the efficacy of] what he knows, provoking, in this way, numerous illnesses for otherpeoples. The one who was well prepared by his father-that is, the one who passedthrough this ceremony [that leaves the shamanic knowledge dormant] - does not do this.He does not even think about this!\" Another example was given to me in 1992 byWenceslaw, from Urucu River: \"There are some kumua [i.e., the pseudo-kumua], theones who go here and there, who try to learn something with one or with another, whowere not trained by their father. Once they know something, they want to experiment tosee if it works. The kumu who has learned with his father does not think this way. Theone who has learned here and there wants to experiment his knowledge to see if itworks. Doing this, he creates numerous illnesses, he ruins children, he ruins old people,he ruins women.\"The region's high incidence of illnesses that are commonly associated with the sorceryof the kumua is, in reality, based on the carelessness or irresponsibility of people who,after learning some spells (be they therapeutic or evil), want to experiment with them,thus causing numerous illnesses and deaths. In fact, the question is not to know if thekumua are, like the Bororo shamans (Crocker 1985), morally ambiguous and stronglysuspected of doing sorcery by members of their own local groups. Unlike the Aguarunashamans (Brown 1988), they don't have to emphasize before others their efforts atcuring as a way of repelling suspicions of their supposedly malevolent intents. What Ihave tried to show here is that, given the prevalence of sorcery beliefs in indigenoussociety and the nature of shamanic knowledge, Desana culture itself has imposedspecific rules related to the kumu's training and therapeutic practice in order to restrain"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"the dissemination of shamanic knowledge in indigenous society. It is to prevent its useout of context, or by a \"wrong\" person (i.e., one who does not belong to the shamanicgenealogy), or by a person with a malefic intent who would do nothing but provokeneedless illnesses. It seems likely that, just as for the Piaroa (Overing-Kaplan 1975) orthe Wari' (Vilaga 1999), illnesses grow above all out of the lack of control and masteryof a knowledge that has to do with the creation of the world, and thus is so dangerousthat it needs to be contained and left dormant in the kumu's body so that he will forgetit.Notes1 The data on which this article is based were collected between 1980-1981 and19842000, in my fieldwork with the Desana shamans (kumua), of the upper Rio Negroregion (Brazil). My work in 1980-1981 was financed by a doctoral grant from theFrench Foreign Office, and in 1984-2000 by IRD (ex-0RSTOM, Research Institute forDevelopment) and the Brazilian cNPq (National Council of Scientific and TechnicalResearch) under a scientific agreement between France and Brazil. I would like toexpress my profound respect for the great knowledge of the kumna, as well as, mygratitude and thanks to them for their patience and interest they always demonstratedin teaching me. I also thank Robin Wright for his useful comments on the first versionof this essay.2 G. Reichel-Dolmatoff worked almost twenty-five years with the Tukanoan peoples,including Desana Indians, of the Colombian Vaupes, and published numerous articlesand books on shamanism, cosmology, ritual, oral tradition, and so on. On the DesanaIndians, see, for example, Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971, 1976, 1978, 1979a, 1979b, and1989.3 In Brazil, the word Vaupes is written as Uaupes.4 See, for example, Crocker 1985 for the Bororo, and Wright 1998 (and this volume)and Hill 1993 for the Baniwa/Wakuenai peoples.5 There are two other terms for illness. The first one (puriri, \"pain\") refers to commonillnesses that \"come by themselves\" and cannot be attributed to a malefic intention.Named as aamrlko puriri \"illnesses of the universe,\" they have existed since thebeginning of the world, and they may happen at any time and affect anybody withoutanyone knowing why (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, insensibility of the legs,malaria). The second gloss (behari) has two connotations: \"transitory\" and \"that"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"passes from one to another\" (i.e., contagious). It is the term used to refer to illnessesassociated with contact with the whites and their objects, the characteristics of whichare their strong virulence, their sporadic character, and their highly contagiouscharacter (e.g., smallpox, measles, influenza; see Buchillet 1995). These illnesses,related to certain characteristics of manufactured objects (including food), are notconceived as the result of white malevolence against the Indians because the Indiansdo not know how these were created by the whites. This is why doreri, which carriesthe notion of an exogenous aggression, cannot be used to designate these illnesses.6 According to the Desana as well as other indigenous groups of the region, it is becausethey live near the place where Kuwai was burned to death that the Baniwa peopleshave a highly developed knowledge of poisonous plants and herbal medicines,including counterpoisons.7 See Brandhuber 1999 on the consequences of beliefs in sorcery (i.e., abandonment ofvillages, migration) among Tukanoan-speaking peoples.8 Thunder is also the master of the hallucinogenic snuffs used by the Yee to induce avisionary and ecstatic state.9 According to Desana mythology, the ancestors of humanity embarked on thetransformation canoe at the mouth of Milk Lake (which the Indians associate todaywith the Baia de Guanabara in Rio de Janeiro) and, after ascending the Braziliancoast and descending the Amazon River, they began to ascend the Rio Negro andsome of its tributaries before returning to Ipanore, on the middle Uaupes River,where they put their feet on the earth for the first time. During their subaquaticjourney, they stopped in numerous places where they performed special ceremonies.Each place is associated with a phase of physical growth and human development(for two Desana versions of the origin myth, see Lana and Lana 1995, and Fernandesand Fernandes 1996).in Part of this section makes use of Buchillet 1990.11 The pupunha palm fruit must be boiled in order to be consumed.12 Except for newly introduced elements, such as manufactured objects.13 It is not clear to me which Tukanoan ancestors were taught by the first Desanaancestors and how the ancestors divided their knowledge between them, because,theoretically, the knowledge of each sib and language group is unique (i.e., the"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"existence of specific ideas concerning the mythic origin of diseases and, as such, ofspecific spells).14 The knowledge of one kumu is relatively closed and limited in scope because,ideally, it can only be passed on to one of his sons. Nevertheless, it is important tonote that kumua can exchange potent therapeutic and evil spells between them,diversifying in this way their very knowledge.15 It is important to keep in mind that the \"same\" illness (according to Westernmedicine) can have various mythic origins depending on the sib and/or languagegroup. Moreover, as we have seen, the kumu's knowledge is traditionally restrictedto that of his sib. For this reason, he may not know other mythic origins of a specificillness and may not be able to cure it.16 Spells consist of, first, a list of the names of objects, spirits, animals, and substancesassociated with the mythic creation of the disease that the kum u wants to cure or toprovoke; second, of a description of the neutralization by the kum u of their harmfulcharacteristics; and, finally, of a representation of the restoration process of thepatient's bodily integrity through the activation of beneficent animals, plants, andpowers. To neutralize the dangers represented by some plants, substances, animals,and spirits, and to activate the positive characteristics of other plants, animals,objects, and spirits constitutes the basic structure of any therapeutic spell. All theverbs in the spell refer to the actions of the kumu, who says what he is doing to eachpart of the plant or animal considered harmful, or beneficent, to his patient: \"Ibreak,\" \"I put into pieces,\" \"I pull out,\" \"I chew,\" \"I wash,\" \"I refresh,\" etc. In thisway, both therapeutic and evil spells should be understood as performative actions inAustin's sense (1962): they do not describe actions but constitute, through theircorrect utterance, the doing of these actions (see Buchillet 1990, 1992).ReferencesAustin, J. 1962.

ClastresBy putting our terror in abeyance, we can placate it of any silence perceived in theso-called savage other. The advantage to doing so, with particular reference to the topicof sorcery, would be to grant Amerindian societies the power to produce, and place inprominent positions, a radically different kind of humanity. Thus, we constantly run therisk of misunderstanding how culture and society perform their work of constructinghuman subjectivity and, of course, how culture and society take on their particularforms in relation to the human subject (Habermas 1987; Rorty 1989). It seems to methat by the tactical procedures of putting terror in abeyance and allowing difference aradical yet positive subjectivity we may more comfortably pose the question as to why,in Amerindian societies, death is invariably interpreted as murder and is to be explainedas the work of the dark shaman.Can we indeed, from such procedures, go so far as to expect and to accept without fearan altogether different interpretative space for the killer savage? That is, given ourbeliefs about subjectivity, can we fearlessly embrace an intellectual terrain that does notreduce murder to a \"moral wickedness\" and/or to \"the most heinous kind of criminalhomicide\" (Little, Fowler, and Coulson 1980:1374)? It could certainly be argued that ithas been our prejudice toward homicidal violence-orientating from the knowledge thatits source can only be attributed to a universal autonomous subjectivity-that has for solong forced us to ignore the shaman of the dark void and instead place most of ourscholarly efforts into analyzing the shaman associated with the light of life.For analytical purposes, let me push further through my hypothetical aperture toassume that, in our Western tradition, our desire to speak and to be heard stems from avery specific understanding about being. At the cultural and historical foundations ofour notions about existence, we have cultivated the firm if not easily retrievable beliefthat \"to be\" (in general for all kinds of existence, but more specifically for humanexistence) is \"to be as presence.\" Through our confidence in being as presence, weinterpret, among other things, how various modes of silence operate as a form of terror.The tyranny of silent modes works precisely because, in our understanding, silencethreatens our ideas about being as presence."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"We clearly attribute some elements of absence to silence. Having done so, and havingalso associated absence with a lack of being, we place certain modes of silence in thesame category as nonbeing. The ways in which we intellectually fuse the notions ofsilence and absence with, for example, death, exemplifies how the meaning of nonbeingmay emerge. The various modes of silence transform into extremely capable forms forcontrolling the tactics of terror.Within the various institutionalized modes of silence such as, for example, themonastery, the isolation cell, or even the experiential field site of the anthropologicalfieldworker, our Western ideas about the autonomous self receive their exposure to theritual processes of being as presence. Such exposure actively engages the ritualizingprocesses of transformation supplied by silence. Here the initial movement to silence,by the self, mimics death, but only to achieve the further transformation of a ritualrebirth or a return of presence to being. The cultural creation of new social identitiesoften depends on this crucial work performed by silence. Through the silence of self-abnegation, the monk seeks withdrawal from the hectic secular world in order to be\"reborn\" in the halcyon sacredness of the divine. Through the enforced silence of self-contemplation, the prisoner supposedly imbibes \"reform\" or \"rehabilitation\" -that is,from incarcerated delinquent to liberated moral conformist. Through the silence of self-removal (from home to foreign places and from body to text), the anthropologist canusually attain the legitimate credentials of an ethnographic field researcher. In this lastmode, note particularly how achieving the legitimacy of the autonomous subjectivitypertaining to the field researcher comes to depend on the presence of theanthropologically researched other.Take, for example, the ethnographic instance by Clastres (1998) offered in theepigraph above, which appears (at least to me) to demonstrate how his text anxiouslyattempts to give presence to an Atchei silence of being. From the wild and chaotic\"primitive\" spaces of the Paraguayan forest to the tame and ordered pages of his\"civilized\" anthropological text, Clastres carefully and sympathetically uproots thetyranny of the iroiangi (Atchei silence) and literally gives to it the presence of asavagery. In his perhaps romantic view of them, he additionally extends to their savagesilence the knowledge of a liberty. He ponders and becomes enlightened by theknowledge that as soon as the silent and free \"savage\" successfully communicates withus-that is, when such a being acknowledges our presence by breaking silence andbecoming present-that being loses its \"last freedom.\"' Is it not extremely revealing,however, how the social being of our aspiring ethnographer -having been denied its"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"presence by the silence of the iroiangi- anxiously endeavors supplement andtransformation into the silent presence of writing?'You maybe skeptical. Consider, nonetheless, some of the reasons why we continue tocall Amerindian masculine force, Islamic male honor, and/or African patrilineage\"terrorism\" or \"brutality\" when they turn against what we consider to be the vulnerablebodies of women. In the mainstream of our culture, these signs of barbarism signal theobvious result of cultures without justice, without democracy, without God, and withoutstatehood's representation of the treasured autonomous self. They exemplify the denialof access to the individual 3Consider also, for the specific purpose of counterposing an alternative interpretationof Amerindian sorcery, the modern notion that every individual possesses the potentialfor violence-a force capable of rising up from the deep recesses of an unguarded domainto become the orchestrated property of war (Deleuze and Guattari 1987). Every societyrecognizes this potential of the individual and, in its own particular way, seeks toconscript this forever imminent force into its service. Whenever it works on behalf ofinstitutional forms, the violence of the body usually becomes something other thansimply a negative force (Leach 1977; Riches 1986). Certainly it can disrupt such forms,but it can also reinstate them and bring about the known boundaries of social roles andpolitical community. When disruptive and negative, the terrorism and brutality ofbodily violence reveals the warrior savage. In this guise, as mentioned, the savageconfirms our civilized presence. Could this perhaps be why most of us can reel off thenames of modern-day serial killers but cannot remember the name of even a single oneof their victims? Our fascination for the killer savage provides the evidential field inwhich to confirm the actual potency of bodily violence transported from the gaps to thecenter. On the other hand, our horror of the killer savage also assures us of our anxiousmoral presence at the center. For us (or at least for those of us in the ideals of bourgeoismodernity), our moral presence seeks to be represented by the state with itsappropriation of our poten tial for violence. There at the center, but on our behalf, thestate is given the legitimate right to possess and use violence and, as such-that is, inbeing used as justified force-violence often loses its character of savagery and becomescivilized. Thus from beyond or even from inside the boundaries of our community, thewarrior savage provides us with the necessary grounding for our moral presence.Indeed, when we can no longer see the specter of war on the horizon or in our midst,when we no longer hear the roar of battle and, instead, stand facing an empty field ofsilence, we confront more than a mere dark and formless void. The silent being of the"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"savage denies our civilized presence.Clastres's tongue-in-cheek use of the term savage when referring to the Amerindianperson and/or society places the burden of interpreting on us. At one level we want tounderstand this savage as the ideal lack or absence in us of barbarism. Savagery and itsbarbarism are out there, in the forest, hiding behind primordial beliefs. We in fact needthem there, on the boundary or limit, as \"the visible frontier of our culture\" (Clastres1998:141). They help to bring us into being. Imagine the alternative, imagine theirsilence and, of course, to our horror, our own lack of being as presence. At another levelwe seem to want to understand the savage as existing within the confines of our control,within the reservations, ghettos, prisons, and asylums of modernity. Here given thestatus of \"ward of the state\" or even that of legal citizen, the savage Amerindian has, byoccupying the lower ranks, historically helped to shape the form of our socialhierarchies. We are already afraid that they may not be responsible enough to commit toand be loyal to the concept of the nation-state. Hence we give to them an autonomoussubjectivity, which should proclaim on its own behalf its own identity, its needs, and itsrepresentation in the modern world. Yet, we remain uncertain and fearful. Suppose,alternatively, we were no longer unsure and afraid of the silence of the savage?Suppose, alternatively, we were more secure and courageous in our knowledge andexperience of the world? Suppose we were to put in abeyance the glorious tyranny ofany silence from the savage? How would we re-interpret Amerindian being-particularlywith reference to the dark shaman?Attempting to Give Voice to SilenceIn our relations with and imaginings of the Waiwai-a Carib-speaking people who livein the remote forests of southern Guyana and northern Brazil-we have sought to suturethe gaping wound of their silence and bring them and our selves into the substantivemodern world. Not, however, without some impositions.We can certainly say we imagined ourselves as Christians seeking the conversion ofpagans bereft of our god's wisdom and divine grace. We sought to be self-sacrificingand generous (as can be attested to by the early work in British Guiana by Thomas Youdof the Church Missionary Society [Riviere 1995:10]). We came from London in 1904 asJesuit priests (notably, in this case, Father Cary-Elwes), but the Waiwai were on thevery furthest boundary of our diocese and it was difficult to maintain missionaryactivity with them (Butt-Colson and Morton 1982; Bridges 1985). We came from Texasin 1950 (led principally by the Hawkins family of the Unevangelized Fields Mission"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"[Yde 1965:4]) driven by Protestant missionary zeal to uplift the godless Waiwai fromtheir \"degradation and decline\" (Dowdy 1964:x). We were armed not only with themoral duty of our religious faith but also with the acquired knowledge and discipline oftrained linguists (Hawkins 1952, 1962; Hawkins and Hawkins 1953; Hawkins 1998).Our practical mission was to translate the \"word of God,\" to give a literate voice to theWaiwai. For us as missionaries, the Waiwai spoke about their need \"to be saved\" fromsavagery; for us as anthropologists, translating the \"word of science\" the Waiwai spokeinstead about an empiricism that could save them from a savagery.In this particular case with the Waiwai, anthropology confronts what it perceives as anorder in human relations and assumes a causal power behind this order, giving to it theidentity of a moral politics'Waiwai subjectivity becomes political, and strangely its character-if not its form-comes to resemble the modern Western soul. Waiwai subjectivity appears to mouth, inthe anthropological translation, a rather familiar discourse about autonomy. In thisdiscourse Waiwai subjectivity finds itself expressing a \"sovereign political unit\"conceptualized and constituted as the residential space of the village.' Said to be \"anextension of social principles and the kinship system\" (Fock 1963:231) the wholeWaiwai political system substantiates through an appropriation of the individual by thefamily and through the subordination of the family to the residential unit of the village.During our early period of contact with the Waiwai, we missionaries andanthropologists performed the work of salvage -the former wanted to save the lost soulsof the savage and the latter wanted to save some remnants of their dying culture. Weboth targeted what we understood to be an autonomous subjectivity or its indentation asWaiwai culture, and we both found reassurance for our own modern souls in the savagepresence of the Waiwai. The strange irony remains, however, that we carried out thiswork of salvage by imagining and giving to the Waiwai souls of our own making.Consider, for example, my very own role in the affair.Consider my traditional anthropological attempt to orientate the subject: I have beenworking since 1971 with a Waiwai community who in 2000 moved from Akotopono orAkomitu-pono (Mortar Village) to Masakinaru (Mosquito Village) on the upperEssequibo River. In 1986, under the leadership of Mawasha, the community movedfrom their upriver village of Shepa- riymo (Big Dog Village) to Akotopono. Thepopulation of Akotopono in June 1998 was 230: 133 males and 97 females, with 3 malesand 3 females under the age of twelve months, 28 males and 19 females between one"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"and five years of age, 29 males and 22 females between six and fourteen years of age,57 males and 42 females between fifteen and forty-four years of age, and 16 males and11 females between forty-five and sixty years of age. There are, however, four otherseparate village communities calling themselves Waiwai who live on the New River inGuyana and on the Rio Mapuera, Rio Anawa, and the Rio Jatapo in Brazil. ShepurItopon(Howler Monkey Rock Village) on the Rio Mapuera is, with a population of 1,147, thelargest of all the Waiwai villages.It is interesting how, in presencing the subject in the text-that is, in seeking tocompensate for the physical absence of the Waiwai with the positive reality of ourliteracy-I attribute to them a territorial and numerical presence based on an assumedindividual autonomy. At the same time, notice how I am able to claim for myself ananthropological authorship. But let us not complicate the issue any more than it hasbeen already-let us concede the fact of our humanizing project. Much more pressingquestions persist.What if Waiwai representations of being did not correspond to the more familiar oneswe have constructed for them? Indeed, what if the fundamental relation between theformed institutions of their society and the collective ideas of being was such that anincorrect interpretation of one provided a disfigured representation of the other? Evento begin to answer these questions, it seems to me, we would at least have to reflect alittle on our own politico-religious intuitions, informed as they are by deep historicalnotions about \"the magician-king and the jurist-priest\" (Dumezil 1948; Deleuze andGuattari 1987). For it appears that this privileging of the two \"heads of politicalsovereignty\" derives from our preconceived notions about domination over anautonomous and bodily specific subjectivity. In this imagining, the very existence of thepolitical becomes the compliance of the self to the state or, indeed, that of the statewithin the self.Resonance, Spiritual Vitality, and the Dark ShamanLet us not return, however, to the now well-turned issues of the Amerindian societyagainst the state and their definitions of political power (Clastres 1989,1994; Overing1983-1984; Riviere 1983-1984; Santos-Granero 1993).1 Let us in particular stay awayfrom the whole evolutionary question about whether or not Amerindian peoples haveany prior knowledge of the state or possess any individual desire for its accumulatedpower of \"rigid segmentarity\" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987; Gil igg8).' Let us insteadfirst assume \"there is no opposition between the central and the segmentary\" (Deleuze"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"and Guattari 1987:210), for surely \"there are already just as many power centers inprimitive societies; or, if one prefers, there are still just as many in state societies\"(211). The issue then becomes one of tracking the resonance that operates within andbetween centers.We may trace the resonance of political power, in the case of state societies, from asingle accumulated primary point at the center of concentric segmentary circles. Fromthis point, power resonates outward from one concentric vibrating segment to another.Made rigid by being appropriated as echoing and reechoing redundancies, theconcentric resonating sequences of power can be experienced as the repeated discoursesabout, for example, social and economic classes and racial and gendered oppositions.These repeating and rebounding sequences behave as if they were the benevolentlycared for truths of the primary center. Thus does every resonance of state power soundlike the echo and not the source of a percussion of parts.In the case of the so-called stateless societies of Amerindians we may trace theresonance of political power, from their various supple segments back to their localizedindependent sequences. Here the resonators of power remain dependent on particularspecificities within their own local domains: the various fragments of their universecannot be made redundant at a single primary point of intersection. The resonators ofAmerindian power can and do indeed illuminate by their vibration the \"lines between allthe points or spirits\" (Deleuze and Guattari 1987:211), but this power expresses norigidity-it is pliant-always susceptible to the countervailing resonance of other centers.When listening for the sound of shamanic power in lowland South American societies,for example, we do not hear any accumulated resonance at a single primary point; thatis, we do not find any high priest or paramount chief whose individual power originatesfrom a fixed and crystallized ritual space of \"an office.\" Like the layered fragments ofthe Amerindian universe, the segments of shamanic power echo the sounds attributedonly to their specific spirit. Each segment emits its own sequence of spiritual power. Inthis way-that is, as the resonator of a supple segmentary power (or as the sutured woundof a silence) -the shaman can be known through the source of an oscillatory current.Yet, in order to reinforce or prolong its sounds, the percussive movement of shamaniccurrents has to rely on the adjacent segments occupied and oscillated by other shamans.In other words, shamanic source sequences are assisted in their sound production andyet kept within their own segments by the current from other spiritual resonators. Aninter esting feature of these \"forces from the outside\" is the interpretation of theiroscillatory current as negative shamanic resonance."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"In this regard-that is, as a negative spiritual resonator-the sutured wound of anominous silence congeals as the knowledge construed about dark shamans. In contrastto the more familiar and positive resonances of the light shaman (Eliade 1989; Wilbert1972) experienced within their therapeutic and apotropaic spaces, it is instead, I wouldargue, the strange and negative vibrations of the dark shaman that reveal the most aboutthe supple segments of Amerindian societies. Let me go ahead and propose that, insteadof the healing and protective forces of the light shaman, it is rather the deadly anddestructive forces of dark shamans -particularly in the role of spiritual hunter/warrior-that operate to sustain the suppleness of segments in Amerindian societies.A distinctive vitality of being has been attributed to the shaman; such vitality hasbeen recorded as possessing the ability to transcend the corporal body of its host(Crocker 1985; Eliade 1989; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1997; Roe 1982; Sullivan 1988). Inwhat we in anthropology understand as the dream or trance state, the substantive vitalityof shamanic being is said to move from the somatic space of the body or the structuralspace of shamanic practices into alternative domains (Basso 1992; Furst 1972; Harner1973; Levi-Strauss 1972; Rouget 1985). The factual evidence of the body remains,sustaining its dreaming or ecstasy in the material substance of the body recognized byall in the local community- \"that's so-and-so dreaming in his hammock or swooning inecstasy.\" The transcendent vitality, interacting with other beings in the dream orcosmological world, is not hindered by the limitations of corporeality. Its knowledge ofcosmological beings and landscapes empowers it or gives to it the capacity to interactor move effectively within such domains. When it heals as the transcendence of thelight shaman, it does so by searching, finding, and successfully returning the dislodgedvitality to the body of the patient. When it causes affliction and death as thetranscendence of the dark shaman, it does so by the very same abilities and knowledgebut with the resulting dislodgment and/or permanent loss of the patient's body. Thus dothe harmful and deadly conclusions of the dark shaman's resonance echo on the otherside of an inverted complementarity. They fit with the positive form of shamaniceffects; they resonate off health, well-being, and life. In both instances, however, it isthe body that acts as the convincing signifier.Much of the literature suggests that the individual bodies of shamans and those oftheir patients or victims have little if any choice in the matter of being occupied orvacated by their vitalities (Crocker 1985; Levi-Strauss 1972). The eternal mystic sourceof vitalities radiates a power that gives life to and takes it from individual bodies.Presumably because of the more fre quent, distant, and traumatic separations of the"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"shamanic body from its vitalities during a dream or trance, the social category of theshaman receives and sustains an ambiguity of dependency and pity from society. Thecommunity depends on the peculiar placement that the mystic vitalities maintain in thebody of the shaman. It is, however, also perturbed by the hold these vitalities have onthe shaman, for they can send the shamanic body into \"seizures of small deaths\" wheremomentarily the local community can no longer communicate with its privilegedmember. It would be fair to say that while the effect of shamanic power depends onworking through the body, the individual shamanic body places no direct claim on suchan effect. In Amerindian societies, this power belongs (if this is even the right word) notto vulnerable human beings but to eternal spiritual entities. Shamanic bodies merelyconduct the current of spiritual power into the world. When they kill, however, as thebodies of dark shamans, spiritual vitalities frequently take on the deadly resonance ofthe predator.The sick are healed and the healthy are afflicted; either way the body becomes thetarget of a consuming shamanic resonance. The \"mystic human causation of affliction\"(Crocker 1985:21) needs the body. The body is the site for the echo of health and life,sickness and death. The body is the space for the shamanic apparatus of resonance. Inthis space, even within the time of the body, life and death echo as the resonance ofshamanism. As the space of death and the end of the body the corpse vibrates the dirgeand echoes the lethal passage of the dark shaman. The corpse sounds the presence ofdeath and, as \"the object of a collective representation\" (Hertz 1960:28), floats as thedominant signifier of the dark shaman in lowland South American societies. It is theeffect of a surplus of power. In this regard, all death means murder, all murder themalicious work of the dark shaman. Here the dark shaman sutures, with consumptivespiritual vitalities, the cut between the signifying corpse and its signified meaning ofdeath. In the shape and character of the predatory shaman, spiritual malevolence huntsdown the body of its prey. It eats the vitality of its victim. Separated from and unable toreclaim its vitality, the body of the victim dies. The corpse, the death, and the darkshaman fuse into a single dreadful scar. Together they resonate the oscillatory trace of ahealed wound; they indicate the former condition of a rupture. In other words, the veryfact of the vulnerable wound of human mortality is known and has meaning in thepredatory work of the dark shaman. At the level of anthropological interpretation, thiscan explain why, even though the corpse may still be speaking with a shaky voice orstaring in quiet pain, the \"decomposition\" (Descola 1996:365) of the social person oftenprecedes the dying body. Hence the obsequies are more for the social person than theindividual body. What the living body does is allow spiritual vitalities to permit the"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"person to invigorate social relations and society itself. But, as the object of the darkshaman's predation-as the effect of a surplus power-the corpse and death providesociety with the means to restore and retain social personhood even as the individualrots away.As hunter and/or warrior, the dark shaman occupies that conceptualized predatoryspace between the social and the political (or between what anthropology and politicalscience would call the social relations of society and its distributive means of power).The dark shaman resides in the nightly crevices between every segmentary center ofAmerindian society and, as such, actively functions against any possibility of aconcentrated political power at a rigid center. No repetition of segments can coagulateto form a single rigid center capable of appropriating in the political the shamanicpower to kill. The death-dealing arrows of the dark bewitching shaman keeps the socialsegments supple, never allowing them to accumulate at one point as the surplus of asingle entity. Death comes to everyone. It comes in the dark horizon of the westpropelled by the bewitching shaman. The redistribution of any surplus power placedinto healing by the light curing shaman is, therefore, the energy effect of the darkshaman's complementariness 8 The surplus can only be forced into its distributive modeby the hostile act of the dark shaman who causes the \"little deaths\" of sickness as wellas death itself to appear in the first place.' Without the violence of the dark shaman,there is every reason to believe that the surplus power of the light shaman couldtransform itself into a rigid segmentarity within the political domain. Without the darkshaman's ability to initiate death, the shamanic power of life-streaming from the eastlike the blazing light of the sun-could dominate, as the political, all the supplesegmentarities of transcendent presence.The Case OpenedSunday, June 29,1993, Akotopono. From the other side of the village, from the tightcluster of huts near the river, a tremulous wave of heart-felt grief kept repeating itself.It lifted me from my hammock, carried me across the open plaza, and placed meunnoticed among the mourners. Around the corpse of Yaymuchi (Little Eagle), thewailing seethed like a stormy sea.No longer a young man, perhaps in his early fifties, Yaymuchi had belonged to theage-grade of active and respected married men (porintomo- komo). The communityparticularly cherished him for his knowledge of building traditional Waiwai houses, awisdom teetering on the brink of extinction. He was admired most, however, for his"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"calm leadership in communal work-an almost daily feature of Waiwai village life.Perhaps it was after all this very attribute, of his being able to lead by example throughan indomitable will to complete any task he began, that ultimately contributed to hisdeath. He had climbed for his arrow-lodged high in a palm after missing its target ofhowler-monkey meat-and in doing so he passed through a cluster of caterpillars whosepoisonous hairs had brushed against his skin. For three days afterwards he bled from hisnose and chest, gasping for air through his swollen throat, but he made it all the wayback from the hunt to the village. Signaling to his son and other companions not toassist or follow him, he left the canoe, walked up the embankment to his house, andcollapsed dead in his hammock.From the wood fire by the cold pale body, a dim yellow light glowed feebly. It barelygave form to Yaymuchi's corpse sagging in its hammock. Standing over him, withgourd in hand, his daughter bathed his body with warm water, as if seeking to keep itfrom death's frigid grip. With each decant, she cried out for him to respond. His son,held up by his weeping wife, swayed from side to side, groaning from the wound of hisgrief. All around the fire and from the deep gloom beyond a chorus of sorrow keptrising and falling, rising and falling, rising and falling again. Shoulder to shoulder theystood crying, calling, smarting at the sudden loss. His death had broached a questionthat all in the village sought desperately to answer: who had used deadly spiritualviolence to kill Yaymuchi?Yaskomo: The \"Catcher\" of Spiritual VitalitiesIn Waiwai collective ideas about human fatality, all death results from the intentionalimplementation of spiritual violence. Waiwai interpretation assumes that even thoughhuman practitioners cannot strictly own spiritual forces, they work, nonetheless,through their human host and require the moral will of humans to initiate their technicalfunctioning. The corporeal body of a victim dies because its ekati, its life-givingspiritual vitalities, have been permanently removed by mystical missiles deliberatelyset in motion by the malicious intent of human breath.10 The victim's body suffers itsloss of life from the aggressive actions of an individual killer's chanted words propelledinto the wind by puffs of breath. Given through some stolen particle of the intendedvictim's body (like fingernails or clipped hair) or through some intimate object of itsrecent contact (a morsel of food or a favorite fire fan), the ekati of the quarry arestalked by erem- silent predatory words. Gained from the mystical vocabulary ofhelping spirits, the deadly words either directly force the ekati of the intended victim"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"out of its corporeal host or further influence some other means to achieve the eviction.The temporary separation of the victim's ekatY causes illness; permanent separationresults in death. What occurs is a desperate struggle of breath against breath, vitalitiesvibrating against vitalities. If the grappling vitalities collapse into each other, becomingone with eternity beyond the targeted body, the victim dies. Being ejected and unable toreturn to the corporeal body of its host, the spiritual vitalities settle with their originalcollective source in the stratified celestial realms of the cosmos (kapu). Here, ideallyafter death, the distinctive parts of an individual's vitalities reside. The ekati of thehuman eye, for example, takes up occupancy between the earth and the first stratum(Maratu-yena, Guan-people) of the celestial realm. The ekati of the human chest, if notplacated by the vengeance of kinsmen, will angrily roam the earthly stratum in solitaryphantom form. It is, therefore, the conspicuous corpse that immediately arouses thespeculation of the village community.Because in Waiwai society everyone can claim access to the death-dealing force ofspiritual violence, the specific individual identity of the killer is initially very difficultto ascertain 11 Either through contract or personal use, and in its accessible form oferem, the constant availability of spiritual violence directly contributes to the specifickiller's anonymity. As in the case of Yaymuchi's death, open access to and availabilityof spiritual violence evokes the inevitable question of \"who done it?\" And yet, becausethe Waiwai consider tono (the ballistics of deadly breath) to be an exclusive part ofshamanic knowledge, the profile of the killer is already known. Once implemented andhaving achieved its result of death, spiritual violence resonates as the echo of deadlywords chanted only by a yaskomo, the \"catcher\" of spiritual vitalities.The Waiwai word yaskomo comes from the verb yasf (to catch or to hold) and thecollective particle komo. It has been suggested that yasf \"means magical power,supernatural gift and medicine man\" (Fock 1963:75, n.1o). Consider, nonetheless, thatwhen referring to snared prey, the most commonly used verb is nasiya. The impression Iobtained was that nasiya not only referred to the action of successfully capturing game,but also to the distinct substantive corporeality of the meat caught. Whenever speakingspecifically about the snaring or catching of spiritual vitalities, however, the Waiwaiused the word yasi more often. In its shamanic context, yasi carries the meaning of aheightened spiritual association with the divine precisely because of the greaterfamiliarity that the ekati of the shaman has with divine domains and entities. Divinefamiliarity and its consequence of yasi identify the shaman more with the spiritual thanwith the material world. Revealingly, in this regard, the other category of person in"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Waiwai society to be designated with the collective particle of komo is that of child,referred to as rikomo.Waiwai culture provides the understanding that children are not yet fully toto(human). That is, in the aspect of their vitalities, children are, like shamans, more ofspirit than of matter. The child and the shaman belong as it were to dual communities-the ethereal and the material. With both the child (particularly babies and infants) andthe shaman, however, the hold on them seems greater from the community of spirit thanfrom the community of matter. Their bodies are the tenuous materials for the animationof spiritual vitalities that have stronger bonds with their divine sources. The movementof infantine and shamanic vitalities between communities can be dangerous to the moresedentary vitalities occupying the bodies of adults in the material domain. In the case ofa newly born child, for example, the members closely related to each other as husbandand wife and as new parents to the baby in the material social world have to be vigilantabout what enters and leaves their bodies. For instance, still containing the residue ofspiritual potency, heavy foods like meat and cassava bread could, if consumed by theparents, attract the volatile vitalities of the baby and, in the process, \"catch\" thevitalities of the parents and return them to the world of spirit. As part of whatanthropology understands as the couvade (Menget 1979; Rival 1998; Riviere 1974),Waiwai restrictions on certain foods during the early period of an infant's life functionto protect adult vitalities and to assist them in the social construction of parenthood,which comes out of the spousal category. As part of Waiwai understanding, these foodrestrictions are practiced precisely because of the collective perceptions about andbeliefs in the volatile vitalities of the rikomo and yaskomo. In their familiarity withboth worlds and in their ability to move into and out of the body, as well as between thesocial communities of humans and spirits, the spiritual vitalities of the child and theshaman echo as the resonance of a divine power capable of ensnaring life itself.Both rikomo and yaskomo conceptually signal to the living the fundamental messageof human mortality. The birth of a child pushes the categories of husband and wifealong the identity trail to take on the role of parent. In becoming a parent, a Waiwaiindividual sees in ever-closer proximity the dark horizon of personal death. Every sonand daughter weaned from the coherent source of divine power confirms and bringscloser that moment of contact with the dark shaman. Death and the dark shaman are\"knotted\" together at the end of the trail and at the end of the day.In Waiwai, kamo-yemi-topo-i-a refers to twilight and the coming of night. It conveysthe idea (in free translation) that \"the final loop in tying up the sun has been made.\" The"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"end result of the movement of the sun through the day is the knot of night on thewestern horizon. Sunlight and mortality always face west; they are like the dawn, kamo-yepataka-topo-i-a, \"coming directly from the east, facing and moving toward the night.\"At midday, kamara-kataw, \"when the jaguar is in between,\" from where death begins itsmove into the night, the sun stares fixedly like the eye of a jaguar upon its prey. InWaiwai ideas, just as a jaguar would stalk, kill, and eat its prey and as a hunter wouldcatch and tie up his game, the dark shaman hunts and kills his victim like the nighttying up the day. It is a catching and tying up done with the fatal rhythms of shamanicbreath.With the whispered syllables of lethal breath, an approach has been made. Amovement has occurred both within the material world from day to night and from lifeto death, and between the material and the spiritual worlds from ewto (the village, \"theplace where people live\") to kapu (the celestial realm). The movement of words has arhythm. The resonance emanating from the chest of the shaman has a cadence, themetrical movement of which reveals not only the location of the shaman but also, in itseffect of death, the community of its victim. After the corpse-by dying-exposes thelethal effect of shamanic breath, the relatives of the deceased immediately respond withthe unmistakable mournful sounds of grief.12 Waiwai ritual wailing is the counterpointto the silent predatory words of erem, and in its response to the resonance of the darkshaman it echoes the social solidarity of the community in which the deceased lived. Italso seeks to place the dark shaman firmly outside the village community where lethalshamanic rhythms can more reassuringly be identified with other village communities.Like laughter and the shared expression of joy, mournful wailing and its meaning ofsadness help to reveal Waiwai ideas about social solidarity. In this regard, it is verymuch in concordance with their traditional ceremonial dialogue of oho-karY (Fock1963:216), which was performed after every death.The Waiwai oho occurs in various social contexts that give this single genre theimpression of producing functionally distinct formal dialogues. The previousethnographic record states there was oho for marriage contracts, trade, communal work,festival invitations, and for the public display of grief (Fock 1963: 216-19).13 In itstraditional structured form oho involved only two participants, both seated on lowstools facing each other not more than a few feet apart. It was invariably an exchange ofdialogue between men, particularly senior men who were not \"ashamed\" to speak inpublic and possessed \"a deep chest of words\" they could use. Women did participate,but normally only with a man. The \"oho-opener\" (Fock 1963:216) or \"lead speaker\""},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"(Urban 1991) began the dialogue with a single line of speech that ended in a rise ofpitch. The lead speaker would continue with these speech lines until ready to pause,whereupon the speech line ended in a noticeable fall of pitch. At this point, therespondent countered with an affirmative oho. The declarative speech lines of the leadspeaker and the affirmative counter of the respondent comprised a \"form-defined cycle\"(Urban 1991:127) of dialogue. With the participants alternating as lead speaker andrespondent, the dialogue cycles would continue until one of the participants ran out orhad \"emptied\" his chest of words. The overall chanting effect of the cycles soundedmore like song than talk, yet their semantic content and \"form-defined dialogicality\"(Urban 1991:127) conveyed to the audience-by \"indexical and iconic\" (123) modes(like, for instances, the back channel responses of oho) -a parody or caricature ofnormal, everyday discourse 14Specifically with the death-oho or \"oho of lament,\" a resident close relative of thedeceased must cautiously interrogate at least one representative of every household inthe village. Until the public lament for the dead has been performed, everyone beyondthe resident close relatives of the deceased is a murder suspect. Particularly beyond thehousehold cluster of the deceased 15 everyone becomes a potentially hostile stranger-adark shaman waiting to attack the remaining and related spiritual vitalities of thedeceased's relatives. The accumulated exchanges of vitalities between members ofhousehold clusters make it extremely dangerous for the living when one of their owndies. Tiny particles of vitalities belonging to those with whom the deceased lived getcaught, tied up, and carried away along with the dead individual's vitalities. Theircapture may make their owners karipera (sick), and may even be interpreted as causingthe he ewa (pain) of the grief felt by the living for the recent dead. What the closerelatives of the dead want most from those outside their household cluster and fromthose within their village community is reassurance of amicable intentions toward theirbeing. In other words, they want to be reassured of no further loss of vitalities tothemselves from the departure of resident members and, concomitantly, from thehostilities of dark shamanism. Thus, in regard to the form-defined dialogicality of thedeath-oho, the participants do appear to evoke a public display of normal, everydaydiscourse for the good reason of wanting to resume the regular flow of amicablerelations - or at least, in the mimicry, of wanting to suggest that the flow of normalconversation implies the resumption of normal relations.Often, however, the actual semantic content of oho does not cite the normal and theeveryday (see Fock 1963:302-12). Yet where the declarative lines of the relative of the"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"deceased mostly question, the affirmations of his partner fill with the entreaties offriendliness. What remains most instructive is that the form-defined dialogicality of thedeath-oho forces the semantic content to conform to a formula-albeit an exaggeration ofnormal discourse. As such, the formula can successfully serve the function of mediating\"in situations that are likely to give rise to conflict\" (Riviere 1971:306). The socialboundaries, at which hostilities could begin within the village community, apparentlyoccur between the conjugal household clusters where the everyday exchanges ofspiritual vitalities seem less reciprocal and hence more vulnerable. Thus, with thedeath-oho, it could be concluded, the icon of normal discourse in ceremonial dialogueseeks to jettison the dark shaman beyond the boundaries of the village community.As the counterpoint to erem, the death-oho resonates as the formal opportunity todeny any accusations of personal guilt and to affirm innocence. What is interrogatedand displayed in the discourses of lament are the innocence of every village memberand the demonstrative sociability of the community. It seems that the ideologicalWaiwai focus settles on a dual concern for the quality of human mortality and theknowledge of human character with its capacity for violence. Knowing about theemotional disposition of those with whom one lives appears to be of crucial interest.Locating where bad intentions reside, and making sure-when they erupt-to deter themfrom accessing violence, become the required aspects of social harmony. When thisfails, however, even without knowing the murderer's identity, knowledge about hostileintentions remains the leading evidence toward exposing the killer.The Waiwai configure violence in the same intellectual frame as eating; in their view,the ultimate rational conclusion for all killing has to be for food. This notion containssocial, allbeit ambivalent, approval when the object of violence carefully confines itselfto vegetable and animal life (Hugh-Jones 1996; Viveiros de Castro 1998). In the case ofhomicide, however, the interpretation of killing in order to eat the victim does not altersignificantly, but the question of legitimacy makes the victim's death more problematic.To kill another human being illegitimately is likened to the actions of the solitary,antisocial jaguar devouring its prey: the murderer kills and eats the body of the victimwithout cooking it and without sharing it: the decomposing body disappears like foodinto the carnivore's mouth. In converse, to kill legitimately-that is, to hunt or to feud inhonorable vengeance-is to behave like a proper social being governed by the moralobligations of society, wherein cooking and sharing of the victim's body locate thehunter and the warrior firmly inside the community. A successful hunter will not onlymake sure the animal he has killed is transformed into cooked meat before it is"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"consumed, but also goes to some length (even after collective hunts and communalmeals) to make sure he never eats the meat of an animal he himself has killed.Likewise, the avenger of a dead relative will, after the cremation or burial of thedeceased, take the remaining bones, place them in a hollow bamboo and \"recook\" them.If the bamboo bursts in the heat of the fire, the murderer will die. While an illegitimateact of violence tends, therefore, to locate the murderer outside of society and, in fact,makes him or her the target of a legitimate use of violence, legitimate violence, on theother hand, succeeds in reaffirming the hunter and the warrior inside society as beingsof esteem and prestige. Nevertheless, in both cases it is hostile human intentionalitythat remains the initial source of violence, while the spiritual force it stimulatescontains the actual cause of death. The cannibalism of illegitimate violence alwaysresonates in erem. Lethal mystical words, like projectiles from the mouth, can bringabout the death of another human, and death, in Waiwai ideas, can only be initiated byill will for the explicit purpose of illicit consumption.Only those people motivated by their own ill will actually make use of deadlyspiritual force. In such cases, public knowledge and recall about the existing nature ofrelations between community members provide the resident community of the deceasedwith the identities of possible suspects. In addition, public perception about past eventsand about bodies capable of igniting emotions leading to violence also helps to establishthe identity of the guilty. The shared and unofficial obligations of the living to therecently murdered victim begin with having to locate and assemble the evidence of theactive presence of individual human malice. Such evidence can be achieved withrelative ease because the range of expectant emotions assumed to be felt by people withill intent are generally known to result from specific observable actions. The actionsproducing the felt emotions, which tend to lead to and govern a matching set ofresponses, actually expose the presence of the bad intent that activates and usesviolence. Recalling and perceiving, for example, that so-and-so had been on theretreating side of a dispute, allows observers to assume that the retreating individualhad, for example, felt some riwo (anger) or ki i (frustration or emotional turbulence)and became possessed with ki i ito (ill will or, more correctly, \"to be dangerous\")enough to seek retribution against his or her opponent. The subsequent sickness or deathof the offending disputant who caused the anger confirms both the bad intentions of theshamed person and the actual effect of the angry person's violent retribution. Takentogether, the felt emotions of human malice and spiritual violence cause sickness anddeath, but they also provide the very clues for answering the question as to the identityof the individual contributing to the ailment and/or fatality."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"In Waiwai moral philosophy, everyone should exercise the social responsibility toguard against wrongly arousing one's own destructive desires. The general availabilityof violence as a weapon and the link between ill will and the actual use of violenceseemingly compel collective social harmony to depend on the individual's emotionalcalm and bodily discipline. Here where violence can only be accessed through humanintent and practice, it is, in an analytical sense, the result of an articulation between theattribute of individual human will and the resources of spiritual energy. In this sense,violence is inalienable to the individual, because only the individual can transform itsforce into the product of destruction. Yet, in being irreducible to the individual,violence is, in its potential, the culminating sum of a culturally built identity. Theindividual, in becoming a social person, consciously ascribes to the body and thespiritual vitalities an acquired knowledge of ownership over the potential use ofviolence-a knowledge actually constituting the movement of personhood.Graphically expressed on the adorned body with traditional signs of adulthood andgender, but also more substantively in the achievement of marriage and the making ofchildren, the emotional base for the will to violence becomes a known property, subjectto customary displays of control by the individual. Being able to exhibit constraint overthe emotional base to violence expresses both an individual's commitment to societyand the affective means toward collective social harmony. It could be said that Waiwaiculture has, in such cases, indirectly persuaded individuals to perform, on behalf ofsociety, the fundamental task of managing social turmoil. Here the onus of control doesnot rest in any rigid, centralized institution of governing, but rather in the supple,overlapping, multifaceted realms of personhood and household clusters. In these socialdomains-that is, actually through personhood and residence-the individual retainslegitimate access to the use of violence. In other words, the individual uses the moralconstraints in kinship and marriage to police human intentionality and to secureharmonious residential fellowship. It is, however, precisely because morality becomesmeaningful only within these domains that the constant availability of violence keepsindividual control and collective harmony vigilant.The social and cultural requirement of living together offers the opportunity forexpressing, monitoring, and managing the amicable relations of collective social life.Without the fact of residence with others, the need for emotional calm, the potential forviolence, and the ideal of community fellowship could not find their current form andmeaning. For the effect of residence to best perform its tasks, however, the patternedties of kinship and the institution of marriage must also be active, for they are the very"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"means through which affection can be shared and violence denied. The dominant moralobligations to love rather than hate and to be kind rather than hurtful toward thoserelated to you and toward those with whom you live have to be in constant practice. Yeteach individual's capacity for affection is counterpoised by the known potential forviolence from the dark shaman. Indeed, as mentioned, the very occurrences of sicknessand death confirm the deliberate implementation of spiritual violence and the presenceof the dark shaman. Whenever sickness and/or death occurs, the veracity of violenceand the dark shaman acknowledge themselves from within the collective substance ofsocial knowledge and, at the same time, reaffirm the open character of theiraccessibility. While on the one hand it is the access to and availability of violence thatdirectly contribute to the murder's anonymity, and indirectly produce the inevitabledemand for suspects, it is, on the other hand, the murderous ill will of somatic emotionsthat exposes itself to the community of the deceased as the incriminating evidence ofguilt and as the definitive means of confirming the identity of the murderer.The Case ClosedYaymuchi died because he had incurred the ill will of an individual unable orunwilling to control his or her emotions; the fine virtues of a cultural constraint couldnot or were unable to restrain the inherent violence of a bodily passion. As far as themembers of his village were concerned, this was due in part to Yaymuchi's unnecessaryabsence from the protective feelings of family and friends. That is, his recent visit tothe Trio village, where he was a stranger and an obvious target for feelings ofanimosity, contributed to his death. Strangers have no grounds for feeling affectiontoward other strangers and, with this lack, fall into the category of potential murderers.In the minds of his grieving friends and relatives, therefore, Yaymuchi's assailant livedin another village -a malignant shamanic force outside the immediate constraints ofresidential filial and affinal moral obligations. Thus contrasting with the amicableimmediacy of residential relations, it can be argued that, among the Waiwai, death andthe dark shaman serve to keep secure the ideological constraint of a supple politicalsegmentarity. In these ideas, violence and shamanism can never be transformed into therigid repetition of segments; they cannot, for example, be concentrated at a primary ordominant theocratic center.Parting RemarksI have assumed throughout this essay that one reason for the difficulty we have in"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"modernizing the savage soul has been our initial incomprehension of its silence. Whilesavage subjectivities sustain a discursive existenceperhaps in an idiom offractionalized, interactive, dependent being-their statements appear to us not asdiscourse but as silence. When giving them our voice, we seemingly seek to give tothem an understanding of our autonomous and constantly desiring selfhood. In addition,we seemingly wish them to take on the self-assertive work of proclaiming an identity-asubjective being that would willingly search for its own subordination first to theconcept of having an identity and, second, to having that identity represented in theworld. What, we ask ourselves, is the most ideal citizenry for the modern state?Arguably, for us, it is the assemblage of disciplined souls. There appears to be nogreater horror to the modern state than the possibility of a presence that not only refusesto obey but also does not even recognize the command and the voice responsible forgiving it. It occurs to me that until modernity takes up a more flexible position-a moresupple mentary posture with regard to those who may have other ways of being in theworld-it will always confront this other as savage, and, indeed, it will never find apositive accommodating space for such otherness in its world. Until such time, the darkshaman of death will remain in the twilight between the dim crevices of society blowingthose dangerous mystical words we will never truly hear.NotesParts of the ethnography for this paper were presented in the session \"Violence andPopulation: Bodies and the Body Politic in Indigenous Amazonia\" at the annualmeeting of the American Anthropological Association, Philadelphia, November1998, and at the festschrift for Peter Riviere in Oxford in December 1998. A verytruncated version of the theoretical parts of the essay was presented at the conference\"Indigenous Amazonia at the Millennium: Politics and Religion,\" New Orleans,January 2001. I wish to thank all those who offered comments on my ideas at thesegatherings. I also wish to thank Edith Turner and Christopher Crocker for theirreading and comments of early drafts of this essay; I, of course, have to take the finalresponsibility for its content.1 As can probably be ascertained from the epigraph quote, I have been particularlyfascinated by what to me has been the consistent preoccupation by Clastres with theissue of silence. Inhis Chronicle of the Guayaki Indians, he purposely givesintentionality to Guayaki silence (1998:17); it is the very substance of a \"health\" and\"freedom\" (96, 97); and it even metamorphoses into the social \"invisibility\" of a thirdgender (293). Again in his more famous Society against the State, and in probably his"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"most brilliant essay, \"Of Torture in Primitive Societies,\" the central concept of themarked body as memory can only begin to resonate with full meaning when silenceexpresses \"courage\" (1989:184) and \"consent\" (185). My fascination, however, goesbeyond Clastres, for in much more subterranean styles, many other authors havepursued the topic of Amerindian silence. In two very sophisticated examples, the veryintellect and imagination of Amerindian subjectivity takes on a \"thing-like\" culturalpresence (Urban 1996: xiii, 65, 71, 173) and \"metaphysics of sociality\" (Overing andPasses 2000:12), but only, it seems to me, from our shared understanding of apossible uncommunicative silence on the part of the subject.2 This is yet another reason why we can never safely imagine a being of humannesswithout an articulated voice-not necessarily a being human without language, butworse, a human being with a language (as in the case of the Atchei met by Clastres)that did not use language to empower its own individual identity.3 This for me is the clear message I receive from the purposefully horrific openingscenes of Discipline and Punish. In understanding myself and my society as just,lenient, and moral, I perform the modern act of identifying as the \"true\" criminal notDamiens the regicide, but rather his torturers and executioner. We are no longer thisbarbaric, this uncivilized. We have \"progressed\" to a more lenient and humane formof punishment. We now offer the body of the condemned more democratic andrational forms of punishment, ones that reduce pain, yet, nevertheless, clearlymanifest their external power over the modern soul (Foucault 1979).4 Think here of the early debates in anthropology about whether or not \"tribes\" withoutleaders had any form of government and, indeed, any politics whatsoever (Barclay1982; Fortes and Evans-Pritchard 1975; Evans-Pritchard 1974; Gluckman 1982).5 I am quoting Fock 1963:231, but I am also including myself in this category of theauthor.6 I should add, however, that in my own interpretations of Foucault's presentations onpower, I do not understand him to be following the classic Marxist definition,whereby access to and amount of power possessed are criteria for defining power. Infact, with regard to the \"micro-physics of power\" he goes out of his way to say, \"inshort this power is exercised rather than possessed; it is not the `privilege,' acquiredor preserved, of the dominant class, but the overall effect of its strategic positions-aneffect that is manifested and sometimes extended by the position of those who aredominated\" (1979:26-27)."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"7 One of Clastres's more daring and penetrating attempts at illustrating what it takes forAmerindian societies to defeat the state can be seen in \"What Makes Indians Laugh\"(1989:129-5o). Here we see that after the distribution of supernatural power to itsshamanic location, the Amerindian \"kills\"-in the comedic genre of myth and with theequally powerful but natural effects of human laughter-the danger of this potentialpower lurking in the \"distant\" and \"external\" spaces.8 In this regard, the dark shaman is the \"sensual code\" into which the \"floatingsignifier\" of spiritual power becomes thought about and objectified (Gil 1998:93-105).9 Here, as the means of spiritual violence, the dark shaman is irreducible; shamanicpower cannot be reduced to any kind of rigid apparatus of power like that pertainingto the state. In this sense it is \"deterritorialized\" beyond the zones of enclosedpolitics (Deleuze and Guattari 1987:351-56).in Ekati is thought of as a vigorous spiritual substance whose ability to influencematerial life stems from being, in origin, the source of all living things.11 Perhaps here is where the debate between religion and rationality could begin-that is,at the point of intersection between human reason and the mystical. In this regard Iadmit it becomes somewhat problematic for me to continue using the term\"mystical,\" particularly where the context could infer a meaning of \"divine mystery.\"In the Waiwai case, however, I am, so far, in agreement with the view that \"in aninquiry into witchcraft as a principle of causation, no mysterious spiritual beings arepostulated, only the mysterious powers of humans\" (Douglas 1970:xvi).12 I find it absolutely fascinating that given what I understand about the greaterrelevance that the Waiwai place on spiritual being, the marking that \"ritualizedlamentation\" reveals can just as meaningfully be said to mark \"a return after aprolonged absence\" (Urban 1996:153) not to the living but to the eternal communityof spirits. Indeed it makes just as much sense to say in the case of the Waiwai that a\"person who has been, for some time, only\" phenomenally accessible \"is made onceagain\" (153) noumenally real-through death.13 While not having occasion to see oho in its traditional and more structured form, Ihave many times witnessed aspects of its formal features in different ritual contexts.In its core character and aims, oho remains today very much an element of Waiwaisocial life."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"14 Piwa, an old Waiwai when I knew him, once simulated a traditional oho for me,playing the parts of both lead speaker and respondent. I have to say the two mostnotice able features of his reenactment were how the oho captured the musicalaesthetics of Waiwai flute playing and seemingly mimicked the dawn chorus of aflock of karapa (horned screamer [Anhima cornuta]).15 I would here like to note the interesting comparison between a Waiwai householdcluster (also called \"neighborhood\" [Howard 1991:53]) and a Trio village (Riviere1970). The Trio are the Waiwai's east or northeastern neighbors in Surinam. I wouldargue that outside of the natal household and in terms of the social relationsentrusted to bear the most weight for coresident trust and harmony, it is today'sWaiwai household cluster that resembles a traditional Trio village. Marriage bringsnew households into social existence. The Waiwai prefer and practice uxorilocality.The ideal and usual residential cluster in a Waiwai village would therefore be a corehousehold comprised of one married couple with their unmarried children (andperhaps even a widowed parent) and, in close proximity, other conjugal householdsheaded by men related to the core household as son-in-law and/or brother-in-law. AWaiwai village can be viewed as consisting of clusters of conjugal households boundto one another by relationships of extended kinship and affinity. In other words, whathas been called for the Trio an \"agglomeration\" (Riviere 1970:246, 1971:294) ofthree to five autonomous villages would be the rough equivalent of a Waiwai villagetoday. I would even go so far as to suggest that this was the case even when NielsFock first visited the Waiwai at the time when missionary activity had already drawntraditional villages into today's intravillage household clusters. The relevance ofthese suggestions is that the Trio's sip sip man (mild strong talk) of the turakane(ceremonial dialogue), spoken only between agglomerates of the same group, andtheir nokato (severe strong talk), spoken only with people who live \"further away, inone of the other two groups\" (1991:304) of agglomerates, show similar patterns ofoperation to the Waiwai oho. Within Waiwai traditional villages, within today'sWaiwai household clusters, and within Trio traditional villages no ceremonialdialogue would have been brought into action. In both ethnographic cases, the so-called function and meaning of ceremonial dialogue -that is, \"mediation in situationsthat are likely to give rise to conflict\" (306) -would, I argue, be the same.ReferencesAnderson, Benedict. 1983.

Humble immigrantswho traversed the Bering Strait, tens of thousands of years ago, originally diffused itthroughout the Americas, and it is now found all over the world in multiple guises.Typing the word \"shamanism\" in an Internet search mechanism will uncover a universeof neoshamanic products: vision quest classes, ayahuasca tourism, healing consultancy,shamanistic aerobics, promises of illumination, and spiritual holism. Every Internet siteoffers some definition of shamanism, generally in the spirit of Mircea Eliade: that is,the ancient technique of ecstasy, the base of all religious phenomena, not itself areligion. All sites draw heavily on the ideas of trance and the soul's journey in order topropose a loving linkage with all beings in the world, a holistic transpecific andmultidimensional network.The notion of auxiliary spirits also appears in some Internet sites. According to one:\"Shamanic work is done with the aid of a helping ally of some sorts that the shaman hasbefriended. They work together as a cooperative team, with the ally being anintermediary between different levels of reality and the shaman, an engineer of alteringstates of consciousness.\" Among these allies, animal and plant spirits abound, with ahegemony of felines and narcotics. A praised partner is the jaguar, whose wisdomincludes the capacity of understanding the patterns of chaos, of facilitating soul workand empowering the self, of shifting shapes and psychic sights. A cherished vegetal isthe ayahuasca, which \"focuses and aligns the patient with the archaic essence ofspirituality,\" all the way down to the cellular level.'To a specialist in Amazonian shamanism, the most noticeable fact about this myriadof neoshamanic sites and rites is not its profusion but rather the absence of blood andtobacco. Although hallucinogens are extremely important for shamanic practice in someparts of Amazonia, their consumption is not as widespread as that of tobacco. Nicotianarustica, the most common species cultivated in the tropical forest, is \"the principal andnearly universal intoxicant used\" in the region (Wilbert 1987:4). Consumed either aloneor in combination with other drugs, tobacco is the hallmark of shamanic activity.The other neglected substance is blood. I do not refer here to the use of human oranimal blood in shamanistic ceremonies, which, as far as I know, is absent inAmazonia, nor do I refer to the link between shamanism and cannibalism or, moregenerally, predation. We know that one of the shaman's functions is to favor huntingand warfare expeditions. We also know that shamans are held capable of magically"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"killing their adversaries and that many Amazonian people do not clearly differentiatethe shaman from the witch. These facts are manifestations of a deeper schema, whichstructures the relationship with all others in the cosmos and connects shamanism toother social practices like warfare and hunting. Elsewhere, I have explored at length thisstructural correlation, and will only note its demonstration here (see Fausto 1999a,1999b, 2oo1a). I will focus, rather, on jaguar symbolism, which may reveal new aspectsof this correlation.The association between the shaman and the jaguar, whose capacity for killingmeasures only with that of humans, has been known since the first centuries ofcolonization. Consider that \"the [Guarani] magicians, or more properly imposters, whoarrogate to themselves full power of warding and inflicting disease and death, ofpredicting future events, of raising floods and tempests, of transforming themselvesinto tigers, and performing I know not what other prenatural feats, they religiouslyvenerate\" (Dobrizhoffer 1970 [1784]: vol. 1, 63). For the missionaries, the shamans'ability to transform themselves into the feline stood as evidence of their intimaterapport with the devil, the Great Transformer.' The priests were also looking for atransformation, but an internal one, which should happen once and for all: conversion.They abhorred native masks and facial painting, manifesting the deep-rooted Catholicsuspicion toward the masquerade.' In Amazonia, on the contrary, these are centralelements of a transformational world (Riviere 1994), in which the key transformingsubstance is tobacco, and jaguar-becoming is the most common metamorphosis. AsReichel-Dolmatoff writes, \"shamans and jaguars are thought to be almost identical, orat least equivalent, in their power, each in his own sphere of action, but occasionallyable to exchange their roles\" (1975:44). Another author affirms that \"if one conceptcutting across geographic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries among South AmericanIndians can be singled out, it is that of qualitative identity between jaguars and shamansand accordingly their interchangeability of form\" (Furst 1968:154; Wilbert 1987:193).We also know that the jaguar haunts another important semantic domain and socialpractice in Amazonia: warfare and cannibalism (literal or symbolic). This is also a well-known fact since the sixteenth century. Consider now that \"this same Kenyan Bebe hadthen a great vessel full of human flesh in front of him and was eating a leg which heheld to my mouth, asking me to taste it. I replied that even beast[s] which were withoutunderstanding did not eat their own species, and should a man devour his fellowcreatures? But he took a bite saying, Jau wara see: `I am a tiger; it tastes well,' and withthat I left him\" (Staden 1928 [15571:110). In this event, narrated by the German"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"seafarer Hans Staden, a Tupinamba chief identifies itself with a jaguar while savoring ahuman leg. Perhaps he does it only to tease his unwilling guest (and future food). Butthere is something else about this odd dialogue-a revealing misunderstanding: Stadenthinks of cannibalism as eating the same, whereas Cunhambebe equates it to eating likethe jaguar and occupying the position of a predator, not of a prey.' Modernethnographies contain many examples of the identification of warriors with jaguars, andof killing with (symbolic) cannibalism. One may thus ask: What is the common threadthat links warfare and shamanism to the jaguar? And what is it to eat like the jaguar?To address these questions, I will resort to my own data on the Parakana, a Tupi-speaking people of southeastern Amazonia. Their population totals some eight hundredindividuals dispersed in seven villages along the Xingu and Tocantins river basins. Theywere drawn into state administration in the 1970s and 1g8os, but theretofore theypracticed warfare and strongly relied on the hunting of big terrestrial mammals. Theemphasis on these two activities increased during the twentieth century, especiallyamong the western Parakana-a fact that may have reinforced the predatory aspect oftheir shamanism (Fausto 2oo1a). I do not mean to imply, however, that predation isabsent in the shamanism of other Amazonian peoples where warfare is less central apractice or one that went into disuse longer ago.' Much to the contrary, I claim thatthere is an intrinsic link between warfare and shamanism.A Stench of BloodStrictly speaking, there are no shamans among the Parakana, only dreamers. No oneattributes this role to himself, and no one is publicly recognized as being a shamans Thedifference between a dreamer (opoahiwete-wa'e) and a shaman (moropyteara) concernsthe ability to heal: only the last is held capable of extracting the pathogenic agents thatcause diseases, known as karowara. Few dreamers admit to having seen one in theirdreams, because it is equal to admitting the possibility of being a witch. The stigma isstronger than the prestige, thus discouraging the institutionalization of the shaman'srole. This is perhaps one of the effects of the emphasis on predation among theParakana: to make the shaman an unfeasible figure.But what exactly is karowara? Why is seeing it equal to being a witch? The Parakanaare not very loquacious on these questions. But we can explore the concept in acomparative way, because it is a very common one among Tupi/Guarani-speakingpeoples. Ordinarily karowara is associated with cannibal spirits, who cause diseases byeating, from the inside, the flesh of humans. Among the Wayapi, for instance, it is a"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"synonym for the an- hanga (the Tupi/Guarani cannibal monster) and one of the shamans'offensive weapons (Gallois 1988). Among the Asurini do Xingu, Karowara areanthropomorphic spirits with whom the shaman interacts and who may penetrate ahuman body and eat it up (Muller 199o).The best comparative data about the karowara are provided by the Asurini doTocantins, a people very close in language and culture to the Parakana, who do haveshamans in the strict sense of the term. The definitive experience of a novice shaman isthe dreaming about the jaguar, from whom he has to extract the karowara. Before doingthat, however, he is submitted to a test: he has to eat the jaguar's food, which is rawmeat full of blood. If he fails, he wakes up vomiting; if he succeeds, he is ready to sucka karowara from the jaguar, which he will retain in his mouth as the source of his curingpower (Andrade 1992:132-37). During his professional life, he will repeat this act manytimes, but instead of keeping the karowara he extracts from his patients he will spit andinter them.Before dreaming about the jaguar, the novices are ritually trained by an establishedshaman. He prepares the teeth of some animals and insufflates them. The teeth start tomove by themselves, becoming a karowara. The shaman inserts the karowara into a longcigar, which the novices smoke during a ritual known as opetymo (\"eating tobacco\").'They absorb the karowara and have to learn to control it and not be controlled by it-ahard task for a beginner. This is why menstruating women are advised not to attend theritual: the novice may lose control of himself and, smelling the scent of fresh blood,attack the women (Andrade 1992:128).In sum, to be a shaman among the Asurini do Tocantins implies eating like the jaguar,and by our (and Cunhambebe's) definition, to be a cannibal. We also begin to see thateating like the jaguar implies a form of cuisine or, better, its absence: cannibalism isequivalent to homophagy and hematophagy, eating raw meat and blood.Some Parakana facts support the association between blood and shamanic power thatwe find among the Asurini do Tocantins. As with the latter, they do not think of thekarowara as spirits. In fact, they rarely postulate the existence of spirits. Karowara arepathogenic objects controlled by shamans, with no autonomous volition but rather onlya compulsion to eat human flesh.' Although very few people admit to dreaming aboutthe \"master of the karowara\" (karowarijara), the Parakana hold that to acquire a curingpower a shaman must suck the karowara from this entity, which is variously describedas a bat, a capybara, or an anthropomorphic creature. The presence in this series of the"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"capybara, a large vegetarian rodent, may cause wonder, but it is easy to explain. TheParakana, as do the majority of the Tupi/Guarani, consider the capybara to have thestench of blood. The smell is classified as pyji'oa (\"odor of blood\") whose verbal formis pyji'o. All things that pyji'o are connected in some way to shamanism, particularly towitchcraft. That is why one should never eat capybara, or even bring a dead one to thevillage. Nevertheless, there is an animal that has been consumed, despite its smell ofblood: the Parakana cooked selected parts of the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) andgave them to young men to make them dream. The giant otter is called jawataranga,which I gloss as \"the worn jaguar.\"9 This otter is a very aggressive predator: it is for thefishes what the jaguar is for the mammals.The more significant evidence of the association between blood and shamanic powerlies elsewhere. Among the Parakana, the main way for a man to develop his capacity fordreaming is to follow the road of the jaguar; that is, to be a predator (not only ofanimals, but above all of humans). Killing is conceived as a form of symbolichematophagy because it is said that it \"makes the killer's mouth smell of blood\"(mojoropyji'o). This stench never disappears: the killer can only resort to the tobacco to\"perfume his mouth\" (mojoropi'e) and counterbalance the taste of blood.10 However, aswe will see, it is precisely this combination of blood and tobacco that potentializes thedreaming, that makes someone have shamanic power.The Faithful EnemyDreaming is a form of interaction with all the entities of the cosmos in their conditionas persons-that is, as subjects endowed with intentional agency and perspective. Whatqualifies an entity to be dreamt about is to have a different perspective from that of thedreamer's. In other words, all oneiric interlocutors are \"others\" (amote), or moreprecisely, \"enemies\" (akwawa).11 But in the dream these enemies do not act as enemiesbut as allies or, better, as a very particular kind of ally: they are termed \"pets\"(te'omawa) and \"magic prey\" (temiahiwa). They are faithful enemies, prey turned intoadopted pets that are under the control of the dreamer.As I have shown elsewhere, this conversion of fierce others into famil Tars by meansof an idiom of adoption is a central feature of both shamanism and warfare in Amazonia(Fausto lggga, 2001c). In warfare, there is a widespread notion that the killer establishesa privileged relationship with the victim's spirit, which gives him a surplus of agencyand creativity. This surplus manifests itself as a capacity to name or rename people, toproduce new songs for the rituals, to favor the hunting or even to fertilize the women"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"and produce new children. Shamans also have a special creativity that stems from therelationship with their auxiliary spirits, the majority of which are animal spirits-that is,as kinds of \"magic prey,\" as the Parakana would term them. The shaman's and warrior'spower and job are very similar, although shamanism focuses mainly on the relationshipwith nonhuman others, whereas warfare concentrates on that with human others.The interesting fact about the Parakana is that they have conflated these twooperations. A dreamer interacts with all entities of the cosmos, be they humans,animals, plants, stars, natural objects, or artifacts. There is, however, a hierarchy: not allpeople dreamt about the more powerful others, among whom are human enemies(sometimes described as monstrous), the jaguar, and thunder. The most ordinary dreamtenemies are animals, which the Parakana call ma'ejiroa, a collective noun thatdesignates both a set of objects (\"stuff\"), and the animals in their condition of prey(\"game\").` Objects and prey can be classed within the same category because they arenot credited with much agency. They are at the ground level of a hierarchy whoseorganizing principle is the capacity for predation. Humans and the jaguar (or jaguarlikebeings) occupy the ceiling.Among the Parakana, the most powerful dreaming experience is called \"bringing inthe enemy\" (akwawa-rero'awa), which is associated with the healing of diseases.Because the dreamers are held incapable of extracting the karowara (the pathogenicobject), they bring their familiar enemies to perform the cure. This type of dream iscomposed of two parts: First, the dreamer's double (a'owa) meets an enemy people andbrings them to the village. Second, he awakes, and interacts with them, as the Parakanasay, \"in his real skin\" (ipirete), that is, in wakeful state. One who has such potentfamiliars will have a very long and productive life 13 Whenever ill, he will be cured bythem, and will also learn many enemies' names and receive many enemies' songs togive to his kin. He will be at the center of ritual life and kinship, a center from whichflows symbolic goods captured in the outside to produce persons and relationships inthe inside.The jaguar occupies a very productive place in this system. The human enemies aboutwhom the Parakana dream partake of some of the feline's attributes, particularly itsalimentary ethics. Consider an example from one well-know dreamer, Koria. He dreamtabout the karajb, the most terrifying oneiric enemies and the most helpful pets\" Thekarajb took Koria to their village when he was ill. Their main shaman, \"the one whoknows how to make people stand up\" (oporopo'omohowa'e), came to him, shaking hisvictim's bones as if it was a maraca. He made an incision on Koria's belly. Then,"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"according to Koria,he sucked my blood that was flowing out, ate it up. He cut me again. Ate it up. Hepulled out his little cutter. Again, he stuck it in and pulled it out. Then, he suckedfor the last time.-Come on, stand up!I stood up.-That is why you come to our encounter, in order for us to cure you, he said.He left me. He vomited my exblood. Then he said to his sister:-Bring me water to wash my mouth.She brought it in a long pot. He drank and let it drop, dropping perhapscompletely the stench of my blood (jerowypyji'oa).The curing act is clearly described as a form of hematophagy, although the karajbshaman washes his mouth and vomits afterward. When Koria describes the karajbalimentary habits, we come to know that they eat a red-tinted flour that makes one fly,as manioc beer does. We may relate this to a Tapirape dreaming narrative, in which theshaman's auxiliary spirits effectively drink blood as beer: \"He [the shaman] refused todrink it, because he understood that the kaui was human blood. Ikanancowi saw thespirit drinking from the kaui pot and immediately after vomiting blood; he saw anotherone drinking from another pot and excreting blood\" (Wagley 1976:242). Among theenemies that the Parakana dreamer familiarizes, we count also the jawararijb, a monsterwho sucks people's heart and blood. We could adduce other examples here of auxiliaryspirits who are characterized by hematophagy, as is the case of Titipiur among theAchuar (Descola 1993:356-57), but it would divert us from our central personage, thejaguar.The jaguar is, of course, one of the Amazonian shaman's most praised auxiliaries andthe source of a very powerful shamanism. Among the Parakana, dreams about jaguarsare always associated with metamorphosis, and sometimes are directly connected to ajaguar killing.15 Some dreamers are capable of \"bringing in\" a real jaguar during theironeiric experience and, subsequently, of transforming themselves into one. Themetamorphosis is termed jyromonem, which literally means \"to put a continent on,\""},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"that is, \"to dress.\" The dreamer brings the jaguar and enters its skin,\" and, endowed withall its abilities, he goes to the forest to hunt and eat. He may also employ his newlyacquired \"natural\" tools to cure himself or to kill an antagonist, normally a kin. Here isone song that explores this ambiguity of jaguarbecoming:The song is latora's or, better, latora's as jaguar, because, as we will see below, themetamorphosis may imply not only an alteration of form but also of point of view. Fornow, however, let us explore other jaguar facets of Parakana shamanism. We need toexamine them further, particularly in the ritual context, because neither the alimentaryethics of the dreamt enemies, nor the allomorphosis of the dreamer permit us to fullyunderstand the centrality of the jaguar in Parakana cosmology.Killing jaguarsSongs are one of the dreamt enemies' main gifts. For the Parakana, to dream is equalto receiving songs from the enemy dreamt about. If you say that you have dreamt but donot remember the songs, you are either a very poor dreamer or a liar. The mostunspecific term for \"song\" is je'engara, which is formed by the verb \"to speak\" (je'eng)and the agentive nominal- izer \"ara.\" A song is a special kind of speech, characterizedby a surplus of agency. Birds, for instance, do not ordinarily \"sing\" (je'engan) but rather\"speak\" (je'eng), although of course they can sing in dreams, where they appear aspersons to the dreamer.Most of the time, however, the Parakana employ another word for song: \"jaguar\""},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"(jawara). A common epithet for the dreamer is \"master of the jaguars\" (jawajara).Recall that the enemies familiarized by the dreamer are his \"pets\" (te'omawa) and thatthe reciprocal of \"pet\" is \"master\" (-jara). The dreamer is thus both a master of thejaguar songs and of the dreamt enemies. But what is the relation between the songs andthe enemy who gives them? Here I argue that the songs are a partible part of theenemies familiarized in dreams\" In offering a song, the enemy gives a part of himself, ajaguar-part so to speak. Now, what is a jaguar-part? As I understand it, it stands for thecapacity to hold a particular perspective on a relationship; that is, of occupying theposition of subject in a relation (see Vilaca 1992:51). The songs therefore are packs ofagency, quanta of intentionality, that can be transferred from the enemy to the dreamer.Of course, they are not an abstract pack of agency, which circulates as if it was somekind of generic energy. Each song has an owner and a history that starts with thedreaming event and ends with its ritual execution.The Parakana conceive the act of singing during the ritual as a \"killing\" (ijokatawa)and designate it literally \"to kill\" (joka). Because masters never slay their pets inAmazonia, a dreamer cannot sing-kill their own songs during the ritual. They have togive it to a third party, who will be the executioner. During the festival, he will sing thejaguar song and bodily represent the dreamt enemy. He thus condenses in his personboth perspectives: his own and the enemy's (who may be, remember, any entity of thecosmos). What allows this ritual conflation is the song, that part of the dreamt enemywhich is transferred from him to the dreamer, and from the dreamer to the ritualexecutioner.Killing a song produces two effects: first, the executioner matures and develops hisdreaming abilities, much in the same way as does a warrior after killing an enemy(although in an attenuated form). The jaguar-part permits then the socialization of theenemy's intentionality, which is already part of the dreamer's. The jaguar songmultiplies the effects of a homicide, in much the same way as the trophies manipulatedin some warfare rituals 18 The second effect is that the jaguar song dies and, for thisreason, cannot be sung again in the ritual but rather only intoned in ordinary situations.It cannot be killed twice. The song preserves the memory of the ritual killing, but afterthe fact it is void of intentionality. It has been surrendered to the executioner, who willbecome himself a dreamer (or a more expert one) and will put the ritual machine inmotion again to produce new dreamers and capture new songs.A Scent of Tobacco"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The Parakana ritual during which the songs are \"killed\" is known as opetymo, thetobacco festival. It is also know as paje, which means \"shamanic power.\" It is nowonder that participation in the ritual \"makes one dream\" (mo-poahim); opetymo is aninitiation into the science of dreams, as much as a warfare ritual.\" We have seen thatamong the Asurini do Tocantins this same ritual is explicitly conceived as a way oftransmitting the shamans' curing power to the novices. This transference is replicatedby the dream about the jaguar, from whom the novice extracts the karowara after eatingits food. We also saw that there is a close link between acquiring shamanic power andcannibalism. The question I would like to propose now is what does the tobacco have todo with it?To answer this question, let me start with a commentary about blood symbolismamong the Parakana. How is it conceived when it is out of the body; that is, when itbecomes \"someone's exblood\" (rowykwera)? Its most prominent feature is its odor,which is highly contaminating. Someone's exblood affects other people without anyphysical contact, causing the swelling of the spleen, an intense fatigue, and analhemorrhage. It is usually men who are affected, either by the victim's blood or bymenstrual (and postpartum) blood 2° That is why menstruating and new-motheringwomen cannot cook, nor can they sleep with their husband. The victim's blood is evenmore endangering. During posthomicidal seclusion the killer must drink very bitterinfusions made from the inner bark of two species of Aspidosperma in order to\"extinguish the spleen\" (tomano ipere oja), and to avoid other deleterious consequences21 These infusions are universal blood neutralizers, and preadolescent girls may takethem to retard menarche and avoid having children too young.Although also used by men during posthomicidal seclusion, tobacco has a verydifferent function that has nothing to do with the spleen. The killer smokes it to\"perfume the mouth\" (mojoropi'e), counterbalancing the savorodor of blood (pyji'o). Inthis olfactory-gustative register the tobacco and the blood have opposed characteristics.Nevertheless, they must be combined to potentialize the dreaming capacity. On the dayafter having dreamt about the jaguar, the Asurini novice cannot eat food, only smoketobacco. The same is true of the killer after the homicidal act.For the Parakana, as for many other Amazonian peoples (Levi-Strauss 1966), tobaccois consistently disjointed from honey, which is associated with love, sexual relations,and heaviness; that is, with a state of \"earthly\" satisfaction that prevents interactionwith dreamt enemies. Honey and sweet porridge are at the center of another Parakanaritual, the flute festival, which inverts every single aspect of the opetymo22 It is a ritual"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"turned toward the inside, to the relations between the men and the women. In the past, itwas also performed for a woman recently captured in a war expedition. By acting outthe role of wife and lover, she was introduced into the game of sex and marriage. As theParakana say, she was \"to put her heart into the flutes\" (toji'omonem takwara-pope) andstay long with them, menstruating, procreating, and loving.Blood and tobacco, on the contrary, are outward substances. They cause the necessarybodily and psychic dispositions to meet others, but in two different ways: tobaccomakes one light and amplifies one's capacities to see and dream; blood makes one fullof powerful intentionality and enhances one's predatory dispositions 23 In the Parakanacase, I would like to suggest that the tobacco is a sort of white perfumed blood. In thepast, whenever they run out of tobacco (a very common occurrence during periods ofnomadism), they employed the leaves of a liana to fill the cigars used in the opetymo,which are ordinarily made of enrolled tauari bark filled with tobacco 24 This liana iscalled \"blood-liana-alike\" (ipowyrona), and contains a great quantity of white sap. It isvery similar to another liana, which is its prototype: a \"blood liana\" (ipowy'a) thatcontains a red, bloodlike sap. The red sap is used to fix the charcoal-rich black dye withwhich the Parakana paint their lanceolate arrow points, especially those used in warfare.They believe that the mixture of red sap and charcoal causes a lethal hemorrhage. Insum, the Parakana smoke the leaves of the white-sap-rich liana to dream, and use thered-sap liana to kill their enemies and large terrestrial mammals.The complementary opposition between red and white liana resonates with that ofblood and tobacco during the opetymo. The Parakana while ritually killing the jaguarsong, smoke the cigar. Intoxicated with it, the executioner may fall and dream. TheAsurini do Tocantins insert a cannibal principle (the karowara) into the cigar.Absorbing it the executioner may run crazily, looking for blood.Although I cannot generalize from the Parakana and Asurini cases alone, I would liketo suggest that in Amazonia the symbolism of blood and the symbolism of tobaccoconverge in both being \"outward substances.\" As food for future thought, let me alludeto some instances that hint at this suggestion. First, there are examples of a directassociation between tobacco and the jaguar. The Akawaio of Guiana call a variety of thetobacco plant \"tiger tobacco,\" comparing the mottling of the leaves with the fur of thejaguar. According to Wilbert, \"tiger tobacco is of a very special potency, and its effectson the human body relate it to shamanic combativeness and to the shaman-jaguartransformation complex\" (1987:151). The link between the jaguar and the tobacco alsoappears in mythology. The Toba-Pilaga of the Chaco, for instance, recount a myth in"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"which a woman-jaguar is incinerated after having eaten many of her kin. From herashes, the first tobacco plant sprouts (Metraux 1946:60-62; Levi-Strauss 1964:107-8).Second, there are some interesting references to blood in the myths about the origin ofthe tobacco that are compiled by Levi-Strauss in The Raw and the Cooked (1964:108-13). The Terena myth begins with a woman who poisons her husband by spillingmenstrual blood on his food. Informed of her malice, the man gives her honey mixedwith the embryos of a snake he had killed. In revenge, she tries to devour him. Whilechasing him, she falls in a pit that he had dug to trap game. The husband fills up the pitand surveys it; nearby he finds the tobacco plant. The plot revolves around the relationship between predator and prey, with husband and wife alternating these positions. Theman who begins as an eater of menstrual blood ends up as a smoker of tobacco leaves.In a Bororo myth, we find a parallel reference to embryos and the snake. The plotstarts with the men coming back from hunting. The women go to their encounter tofetch the game. One of them carries an anaconda, whose blood drips and penetrates intothe woman. She gets pregnant. The \"son of the snake blood\" goes in and out of themother's belly at his will. Frightened, the mother asks her brothers to kill the unbornbaby, which goes out and is killed. The men incinerate the corpse, and from the ashestobacco and other cultivated plants appear. In this myth, the prey's blood impregnatesthe killer's wife but the son is not human and has special capacities. Once more the plotstarts with blood contamination and finishes with the origin of tobacco.In another Bororo myth, some men, while preparing newly caught fish for the grill,find tobacco in the belly of one of their prey. They smoke it. The aroma attracts themaster of the tobacco, who appears in the form of a bat-that is, of a bloodsucker. Headmonishes the men not to swallow the smoke but to exhale it instead. But his request isin vain. For their disregard, the master of the tobacco transforms them into otters. Themyth begins with men eating properly cooked food but finishes with theirmetamorphosis into eaters of raw fish, as a punishment for them having eaten thesmoke of tobacco. The spirit who transforms them is both a hematophagous being andthe master of the tobacco.Third, and finally, let me approach blood and tobacco from an axis that organizes thislast myth: of transformation. We do not need to dwell on the well-known fact thattobacco is the transforming substance par excellence in Amazonia. But what about thetransforming quality of blood? Menstrual blood has a central role here. It is a sign offertility, it marks that a transformation is going on in a woman's body and implies the"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"possibility of her transforming future people inside it. It is not surprising, therefore, thatwarfare rites and male initiations thrive on the analogy with the reproductive andtransforming power of menstrual blood, and sometimes establishes an explicitconnection between the shedding of the victim's blood and menstruation 25Among the Parakana this analogy has a mythical foundation. Originally, it was themen who menstruate. One day the armadillo shot the moon. The men told the womennot to leave the house, but they came out to the plaza and the moon's blood dripped onthem. Thereafter they menstruate, and men do not. The men, however, now can shedtheir victims' blood and can become a dreamer. As dreamers, they can name infants,give songs to adolescents, favor the hunting, and even capture future-infants(konomiroma), who they deposit inside the women. The difference between men's andwomen's creative capacities is that the former have to be acquired, whereas the latterdevelop naturally.26This fact founds the politics of gender of Parakana shamanism: women are notsuppose to dream, and only exceptionally smoke tobacco. A justification I heard for thisdisencouragement is that women are too prone to catch karowara in their dreams and touse them against people. Fertile women already have a stench of blood, and engaging inshamanism would mean a dangerous hyperconjunction. Significantly, the dreamingactivity of post-menopausal women is well accepted.Mature men, on the contrary, must dream. When a man refuses to go to war and isashamed of dancing in the opetymo, people say he is a child. Taking part in the killingof enemies and songs is essential for maturing. Those who have shame (jeroji) cannotfamiliarize enemies through the dreaming and be fertile in the giving of names andsongs to their kin. The stench of blood connotes this fertility and creativity, the capacityfor producing transformation. This is the case because Amazonian peoples conceive ofhomicide as ontological predation; i.e., as a form of devouring some vital constituent ofthe victim's person and acquiring a surplus of intention- ality.27 The smell of blood thatimpregnates the killer without any physical contact is a central signifier for thinkingabout this acquisition. That is why posthomicide taboos focus so much on blood and itsstench.28 As a substantive quality, blood odor expresses an abstract notion in a sensiblecode; namely, that to kill is to establish a special rapport with the victim, a rapport thatimplies fertility.29In light of this we can now answer a question posed earlier: What is to eat like thejaguar? It is to consume the victim's activity, of which blood is a strong signifier,"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"without its neutralization by fire. Everyday food, on the contrary, requires the removalof all traces of blood through cooking. Cooking is a technique for eating meat withoutthe danger of being in touch with the subjectivity of the animal eaten3° After all, no onecan be a jaguar all the time, and not everyone can be a jaguar sometime. This must be aritualized and controlled activity because being a jaguar is an ambivalent necessity.Whose Eyes Are Mine?The Parakana attribute intentionality to various entities of the cosmos. Some persons,mostly adult men, are capable of interacting with these entities through the dreaming,where they establish with them a special relationship of adoption. As we have seen, thedreamer is the master, the dreamt enemy is the pet. The former seems to control thelatter, imposing on the enemy his own perspective. This is fair enough: the enemyfamiliarized in dreams does not act as an adversary, because he surrenders a part ofhimself to the dreamer and asks for nothing in exchange. Nevertheless, the actualrelationship is much more ambivalent than that, as is the figure of the shaman in mostAmazonian indigenous societies. It is not difficult to understand why.All dream narratives that I have registered concerning the \"bringing in of the enemy\"contain the following theme: the pets may act as captors and keep their master as a pet,which means adopting and turning him into one of them. In other words, they reversethe sense of familiarization. This is a very common motif in Amazonia, particularly inregard to the notion of \"soul loss,\" a morbid state caused by the undesirableexteriorization of a vital constituent of the person.In the Parakana case, the possibility of reversing the relationship between master andpet points to the fact that the dreamer's enterprise is a dangerous one that may result inhim surrendering his perspective to benefit the other's. The danger, however, is not onlyhis own because it involves his kinfolk. He may see them with the eyes of the enemies;that is, he may see his kin as if they were others. In some oneiric narratives, the themeis stated explicitly: the dreamt enemy wants to change the dreamer's point of view.Consider the following dialogue extracted from a dream narrative of a man who hadbeen shot in his leg. The wounded dreamer encounters his enemies:I was among them. They asked me:-Was it your kin who shot you?"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"-No. The enemy killed me, I answered.-Tell us where your kinfolk are, so that we can kill them all.-Ok. Let's go, I said without conscience.I translate here the Parakana's expression awai yma as \"without conscience,\" but itliterally means \"not (being a) person.\"31 When the dreamer surrenders his perspectivehe becomes other, and thus a danger to his kin. The same is true of killers. In the past,when returning from a warfare expedition, the warriors had to abandon their bow andenter into seclusion. Their folks, particularly the women, would remember them thatthey are kin, not others: \"Do not have anger toward us,\" they would say. All measureswere taken to avoid a complete alteration of the killers' point of view.However, to be a killer or a shaman in Amazonia unavoidably implies the cumulatingof more than one perspective, and a certain capacity of alternating between them oremploying both at the same time. Not all perspectives are equal. Because agency isvariously distributed among the entities of the cosmos, and the capacity for predation isa hallmark of powerful agency, the shaman, as the warrior, is commonly associated withpredators like the jaguar. To become a puissant shaman one must entertain a specialrelationship with ferocious beings, eaters of raw meat and blood. This relationshipimplies a sharing of perspectives. The shaman's ambivalence stems from his serving, inperson, as a point of articulation between his perspective and that of his ferociousfamiliar spirits.The most obvious manifestation of this fact is the shaman-jaguar metamorphosis,where the former actually become the latter, as Wilbert clearly shows for the Campacomplex: \"Campa jaguar shamans can adopt a jaguar form upon embarking on their far-flung journey in search of food. Human food does not nourish them when they are injaguar form. Rather, werejaguars of this kind eat people, which appear to them aspeccary. They travel long distances so as to avoid eating their friends and kin.Especially during the months of March through June were -jaguars are on the prowl ofchildren or in shamanic terms young `peccary,' and again, as jaguars, shamans areunable to distinguish their own human children from others. Thus, when in the form ofjaguars, shamans are jaguars: they see like them and they think like them\" (1987:194).In the same vein, Vilaca writes about the Wari' shaman: \"The negative facet ofshamanic agency concerns his capacity to turn into an enemy at any moment, attackinghis own people, and possibly causing death. Such action is unintentional, almost a"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"'technical failure': the shaman's vision becomes deficient and he starts to see his kin asenemies or animal prey. The effect is as if his different bodies merge in such a way thathe, as Wari', adopts the animal's point of view\" (1999:250).The alteration of perspective, the intimate rapport with dangerous spirits, the capacityof magically killing people, the cannibal connotation of the initiation and the healingpractice, and the going-jaguar-all these facts contribute to making the Amazonianshaman a redoubtable figure.ConclusionAmazonian shamanism is not a loving animism, as its middle-class urban vulgatewant us to believe. It is better understood as a predatory animism: subjectivity isattributed to human and nonhuman entities, with whom some people are capable ofinteracting verbally and establishing relationships of adoption or alliance, which permitthem to act upon the world in order to cure, to fertilize, and to kill. As I suggestelsewhere (Fausto lggga), however, the capacity of familiarizing other subjectivities, ofhaving them as allies, depends on predation in warfare and hunting.Whereas neoshamanism is turned on the remodeling of individual subjectivities,indigenous shamanism is concerned with producing new persons and socialrelationships from the stock of human and nonhuman subjectivities existing in thecosmos. The question is, then, how can one acquire a surplus of intentionality andagency, and avoid being deployed of his or her own? If there is no ontologicaldifference between predator and prey, how can one maintain oneself in the position ofpredator and not of prey? Amerindian warfare and shamanism seem to revolve aroundthis question.Understandably enough, the predatory act is the lost fact in modern, urban, middle-class shamanism, which purged the phenomenon from all its ambiguous attributes. It isthus no wonder why the jaguar, although a recurrent figure, is depicted as an endangeredspecies and not as a dangerous predator. Neoshamanism subjects others' thoughts toWestern thinking and moral standards: there must be good and bad, both a light and adark side, and a clear-cut frontier in order to demarcate a basic contrast of ethic. Thereis no such dichotomy in South American shamanism, which thrives on ambivalence.One of the difficulties of the sixteenth-century missionaries in translating Christiantexts to indigenous languages was to find a suitable equivalent for God, because there"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"was no such thing as an indigenous supreme divinity to be translated into a unique(although trine) God. Further, to make things worse, once the missionaries had chosenone among various possibilities, they had to rid him of his ambiguous attributes. If Godwere a jaguar, their task would have been much easier.What does it mean not to base a cosmology on a clear-cut opposition between goodand bad? What kind of society does so? These are questions that have haunted Westernthinking since the sixteenth century. Nevertheless, the answers have always been a morerepetition of the very dichotomy that causes the questioning. Choose your side: thenoble or the fierce savage? Hobbes himself actually preferred the latter, whereasRousseau would have favored the former. Nowadays some people make a living byselling one or the other image, while others just comfort their hearts in defending one ofthem. The choice is less motivated by facts than by the approach one has to one's ownsociety. Again, no novelty here. The \"state of nature\" had the same function forsixteenth- and seventeenth-century philosophers: it was a way to distinguish betweenthe original and the artificial in human nature so as to judge European society at thetime.In any case we must recognize one fact: the very culture that bases its ethics in auniversal distinction between good and bad has developed (among many other things)an insurmountable capacity for violence and de - struction. Indigenous cultures thatprospered in ambivalence, on the contrary, were not so successful. A famous Jesuitmissionary once said, maybe in a burst of despair, that the best form of preaching forpeople like the Tupinamba was with the sword and the spear. He was only partiallyright. The Europeans conquered South America with the word and the sword, a mix lurethat proved to be much more efficient than the fine blend of blood and tobacco thatcharacterizes Amazonian shamanism.NotesI wrote this article during my stay in France as visiting researcher at the Laboratoired'Anthropologie Sociale (CNRS/College de France). I would like to thank PhilippeDescola for the invitation to France, and the Coordenadoria de Aperfeipoamento dePessoal do Ensino Superior (CAPES) for providing the means for my sojourn. Mythanks also go to Aparecida Vilapa for her comments on a first version of this text,and above all to the Parakana among whom I collected the data presented here.

Father Dobrizhoffer, for instance, seems to prefer thefirst alternative, whereas Ruiz de Montoya was inclined to accept the second. Theformer quotes a dialogue he had with the Abipones about the metamorphosis intojaguars: \"'You daily kill tigers in the plain,' I said, `without dread, why then shouldyou weakly fear a false imaginary tiger in the town?\"You Fathers don't understandthese matters,' they reply, with a smile. We never fear, but kill tigers in the plain,because we see them. Artificial tigers we do fear, because they can neither be seen norkilled by us\"' (1970 [1784]: vol. 2, 77-78).3 Recounting his encounter with a Guarani group yet unconquered, Dobrizhoffer writes:\"His [the cacique's] son, a handsome boy of ten years old, had all his face paintedwith small black stars. You think', said I, to adorn your face with these stars, but youhave disfigured it most wretchedly. Come, behold yourself in this mirror.' Havinglooked at his face a little while, he hastened to some water to wash it, and he, whowith his naked limbs, had just before come to me a perfect Pyracmon, when he hadwiped off the soot, seemed transformed into a Daphnis\" (1970 [1784]: vol. 1, 78). Onthe church's attitudes toward the masquerade in the Middle Ages, see Schmitt 2001.4 Viveiros de Castro suggests that Cunhambebe's statement may be understood as \"ajaguar-becoming, where `jaguar' is a quality of the act, not of the subject.... Even ifthe object of becoming is imaginary, the becoming is real, and the ferocious alterity isa quality of the verb, not its predicate\" (1992:271). On Staden's account, see Forsyth1985 and Whitehead 2000.5 I have analyzed the historical transformations of Guarani shamanism in order to showthat there has been an almost complete dissociation between the shaman and thejaguar, and the replacement of predation by the concept of \"love\" (mborayhu). I havecalled this process \"dejaguarification\" (Fausto 2oosb). There are interesting parallelsbetween the Guarani case and other examples of historical transformation of shamanistic systems in Amazonia. I am thinking especially of the Yanesha (Santos Granero"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"1991), and the upper Rio Negro peoples (Hugh-Jones 1994; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975;Wright 1992).6 When talking about shamans and dreamers, I employ the masculine pronouns. Amongthe Parakana, as in most Amazonian societies, the great majority of dreamers aremen and the activity is supposedly restricted to them. This does not mean that thereare no women who dream, but that the activity is genderized as male, even when thedreamer is a woman.7 The word opetymo seems to result from the combination of the noun petym(\"tobacco\") and the verb 'o (\"to eat\").8 There is a specific term to speak of the concrete forms in which the karowara maypresent themselves in the patient's body. This term is topiwara and comprehendsmonkey teeth, some species of beetles, stingray stings, and sharp-pointed bones; insum, every tiny, pointed object when animated by a shaman. Among other Tupi/Guarani-speaking people, topiwara are the shaman's auxiliary spirits, the majority ofwhich are animal spirits.9 Jawataranga can be analyzed as jawa(ra)-tarang-a (jaguar-to wear out-nominal- izer).Other Amazonian peoples seem to draw the same association between the giant otterand the jaguar. Among the Yagua of Peru, for instance, the former is named \"aquaticjaguar\" (Chaumeil and Chaumeil 1992:27).in Once the Parakana told me that just after contact some killers vomited whenever theytook Western medication, and this vomiting made them lose their paje (shamanicpower). They supposed that there was an incompatibility between the drugs and thestench of blood in their mouths, and they believed to have discovered an efficientneutralizer for it.11 Akwawa is a general category for all entities in their condition as a person, who arenot a member of ego's group. In other words, all \"real\" enemies and all dreamtinterlocutors.12 In the first sense, one may say: \"The white man is distributing his stuff\" (omajarangaka Toria oma'ejiroa). In the second sense, one may say: \"I going to hunt and kill thegame\" (aata weha ijokao ma'ejiroa).13 Let me briefly note that an important connection here that I cannot develop in thisessay is the idea that homicide is linked to a long life and the curing of diseases. The"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Parakana say, for instance, that one kills an enemy \"for his illness\" (ojemonawa-p6oja). On this theme, see Fausto 2oola:3o8-14.14 For a thorough exploration of this dream, see Fausto 20ola:358-62, 2001c.15 A man who has slain a jaguar may bring its corpse to the village and dance with it inorder to favor the dreaming about a jaguar.16 In this case, the Parakana do not say that it is the dreamer in \"his real skin\" (ipirete)that enters into the beast, because the skin here is the jaguar fur. When I asked Iatoraabout who effectively dressed it, he said: \"I, indeed\" (ije ete).17 I am drawing hereon Strathern's notion of partible persons (1988:178-79) withoutconceptualizing, however, all relations as gift exchange.18 See Fausto 1999a, where I argue that the ritual killing in the opetymo is connected toreal killings. See also Fausto 1999b, where I develop the idea that a central feature ofAmazonian warfare is the producing of many effects from a single death.19 Two opetymo were realized after a warfare expedition: one just after the warrior'sreturn, the other to mark the end of the posthomicide taboos. In this occasion, thekiller announced his intention to dance and make his victim's hair fall as a referenceto the corruption of the corpse.20 Once a man said to me that women do not suffer from the swelling of the spleenbecause they do not shoot people (which is not entirely true in what concerns westernParakana history). A woman contended, however, that the proximity to a killer mayoccasionally contaminate them with the victim's blood.21 These trees are regionally known in Portuguese as carapanauba and quina. TheParakana call them, respectively, marawa and inajarona.22 Whereas the latter is a diurnal rite of individually executed songs, focused ontobacco smoking and the killing of male enemies, the former is a nocturnal festivalof collectively danced instrumental music, associated with eating honey and withsexual relationships between lovers.23 To be precise, the ParakanS do not exactly associate blood contamination withpredatory disposition. This state is connected instead to another part of the victim:the kawa- hiwa. This term is composed of the word for \"fat\" (kawa) and the suffix"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"ahiwa, which occurs in key shamanic terms like \"dream\" (ipoahiwa), \"song forcuring\" (karahiwa), and \"oneiric prey\" (temiahiwa). As I understand it, ahiwa is amodifier that indicates, at the same time, fierceness, danger, immateriality, andfertility (see Fausto 2oosa:316- 17).24 Tauari (Couratari sp.) is a Lecythidaceae, whose inner bark is commonly used inAmazonia as a cigar wrapper. The Parakana call it petyma ywa, that is, \"cigar ortobacco tree.\"25 I point to this analogy when I analyzed the symbolism that makes initiation (andwarfare rites) a kind of ritualized male menarche and a mode of male procreation(see Fausto 1999a:947; 952, 2oosa:456-68).26 \"Naturally\" is here the correct term, if we take it for not depending on intersubjectiverelation. Preadolescents may take infusions to retard the menarche but not to spur it.Menstruation just happens to them. What depends on intersubjective relation is thedevelopment of the breasts. The Parakana say that boys \"make breast\" (mokom) ongirls by having sexual relations with them.27 For the expression \"ontological predation,\" see Albert 1985, and Viveiros de Castro1993:192. For a description of the phenomenon, see, among many others, Fausto2oosa, Viveiros de Castro 1996a; Vilaga 1992; Lima 1995; Sterpin 1993; Journet1995.28 For the Yanomami, see Albert 1985:341-81 and Lizot 1996; for the Wari', see Vilaca(1992:107-13); for the Matis, see Erikson 1986:194-97; for the Arawete, seeViveiros de Castro 1992:240; for the Juruna, see Lima 1995:203; for the Nivacle ofthe Chaco, see Sterpin 1993:43; for the Kayapo, see Vidal 1977:156-57, andVerswijver 1992:194-201; for the Timbira, see Carneiro da Cunha 1978:103-5, andDaMatta 1976:85-87.29 The literature is full of examples in which the killer's digesting of the victim's bloodreplicates the familiarization of the victim's spirit. The Wari' provides the most clearinstance. After the homicide the victim's blood-soul penetrates the killer's body andmakes him fat, a fact that is compared to a female pregnancy. During the seclusionthe blood is digested and transformed into semen, which will inseminate the women.Homicide leads thus to the constitution of two rapports of filiation: an actual one(the killer fertilizes the women with the exblood, now sperm), and a spiritual one(the killer is conceived as the \"father\" of the victim's spirit) (see Conklin 1989:239-41; Vilaga 1996:120-23)."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"3o For some Amazonian peoples cooking is not enough, and a shaman must treat thefood before it is safe for consumption.

But, afterward, the deaths began. The witchcraft diseases[kurihe] arrived. We became few. In the time the white men came [again]; theybrought [back] the witchcraft diseases, the old ones, the witches. The witchcraftarrows flew. Many died. -Kuikuru elder, quoted by B. FranchettoIn the upper Xingu River region of southern Amazonia, matters of life and deathand of \"good\" and \"evil\" are intimately tied to conceptions of witchcraft. It is, theXinguanos firmly believe, the root cause of most misfortune and illness. Mishaps canoccur by accident, and nonhuman spirits and \"monsters\" can cause sickness and death.The witch-the assault sorcerer or \"dark shaman\" -stands out most clearly, however, asthe embodiment of evil in the world. Although human in form, witches lack empathyfor other humans and act for purely personal motives: rivalry, spite, jealousy,vengeance, and the like. Spirits can also show indifference to human suffering andpurposely do harm, but they exist outside of human society. They can be good or bad,and, while dangerous, they are not considered inherently evil-if you make theappropriate observances but otherwise don't mess with them they generally do littleharm. Witches, on the other hand, exist within society as humans, yet they also workagainst human society and need little or no provocation to persecute their victims.We might therefore view witchcraft as the antithesis of society, its dark side or alterego. By its antisociality, however, witchcraft is a root meta phor for sociality; itimplicitly defines what is socially appropriate, good, beautiful, disciplined, moral, andultimately what is human, through witchcraft's inappropriate, bad, uncontrolled,immoral, inhuman-ness. Witches are precisely what humans ought not to be:individualistic, self-serving, and opportunistic, parasites that victimize and kill innocentpeople who are often powerless to resist. Dark shamans control or channel a destructiveevil force, a raw coercive power that undermines the most basic moral valuessharing,humility, charity, etc.; the many over the one -and threaten human life. Notsurprisingly, witchcraft is met with an equally deadly response, a similarly destructivepower: execution. This coercive power, this institutional violence, is viewed aslegitimate, even socially sanctioned, and is administered through ritualized trials,ordeals, and social dramas. Counterwitchcraft is thus both a juro-political instrumentadministered by chiefs and prominent men, and an ethno-medical technique applied byshaman and counterwitches to rid society of spiritual parasites and pathogens."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Witchcraft is a central concern of Xinguanos, and in the upper Xingu as elsewhere inthe region it has been widely noted by ethnographers. Actual instances of presumedwitchcraft, counterwitchcraft, or accusations and executions, however, are rare, andethnographic cases involve isolated cases or solicited descriptions of past instances.Furthermore, in contrast to native Amazonian perspectives, which often place greatemphasis on dark shamans and their ways, witchcraft has received relatively littleattention in regional ethnology. Like the related issues of politics, ritual, and ideology,in general witchcraft has been overshadowed by anthropological inquiry into domesticeconomics and human ecology, mythology, and kinship, in part due to the long-heldassumption that power was absent or subdued among Amazonian peoples (Clastres1987; Levi-Strauss 1943; Steward 1949). For Amazonia there are no classicethnographies or broad comparative studies of the topic-such as exist for Europe,Africa, Melanesia, and North America-from which to frame regional comparisons.Nevertheless, the upper Xingu is one of the better-known places of Amazonianwitchcraft. In fact, case studies from the upper Xingu have provided definitiveexamples of how witchcraft functions as a mechanism of social control (Dole 1966);how it operates within the context of chiefly rivalry and politics (Ireland 1996); andhow witchcraft and power relations, within the triad of chief, shaman, and witch,fluctuate according to differing historical contexts, particularly regarding disease(Heckenberger 2ooob). Researchers have noted witchcraft throughout the twentiethcentury, and virtually all the ethnographies from the 19501 forward recognize it as acentral feature of Xinguano peoples. They describe it in the form and manner Iwitnessed in the lggos (see, e.g., Basso 1973; Carneiro 1977; Dole 1962, 1966; Gregor1977), and my experiences agree with most of what they say.Witchcraft was a critical element of my ethnographic experience. Seven people diedduring my first stay with the Kuikuru (Carib-speaking Xinguano), five of whom werefirmly believed to be the victims of witchcraft. The experience was for me verypersonal, emotional, and immediate because several victims were members of myadoptive family, the family of the primary chief, and people for whom I care a greatdeal.' Although each person died of a different illness with different symptoms, thedeaths were seen as linked, particularly those most closely related to the chief. It was inthe eyes of the Kuikuru an epidemic of witchcraft, and the aim, in the eyes of many, wasto upset the balance of power in the village and more broadly. Indeed, a war wasbrewing just beneath the surface, within society, and emotions and stress ran high.Witchcraft was not part of my research \"design\": I did not go looking for it or ask"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"questions and seek answers about it. But, unavoidably, it became a central aspect of myresearch: it found me. Witchcraft must be understood historically, it is not a constantinstitution but rather varies in direct proportion to the frequency of illness, misfortune,and death experienced in a region. I was fully cognizant of the fact that much of thehistory of witchcraft over the past five centuries was tied to \"the great dying,\" thesobering reality that from the sixteenth century onward many people died in epidemics?What I realized only later was that, as today, the vast majority of these deaths wereattributed to witchcraft, in one way or another. I wasn't prepared for the centrality ofwitchcraft in understanding Xinguano history.Three things in particular about witchcraft stood out in my mind. First is the intensityof the experience. It is about illness, death, and loss, and because these issues are notviewed as natural but typically the actions of other members of the community it alsorevolved around jealousy, fear, and hate. In other words, witchcraft is extremelyemotional, particularly for the people most immediately affected by it and for everyonein the midst of it. Second is the intensity of political climate: the atmosphere wascharged and the divisions between people and interest groups were accentuated. Third,in the midst of such an agitated or turbulent social climate, is the efficacy of singularevents and people. There is much more to witchcraft than social role playing or workingout structural rules; it is, as we might expect of something so central to life and death,defined by contingency, negotiation, and strategy.Xinguanos and OthersXinguano (upper Xingu) society refers to a population of closely related communitiesthat inhabit the topographic basin formed by headwaters of the Xingu River as theydescend from the northern flanks of the central Bra zilian plateau into the Amazonbasin. The Xinguanos are settled agriculturalists and fisherpeople, who live in large,more or less permanent villages, internally ranked according to birthright and politicalpower and integrated into a broader political body, Xinguano society. The regionalsociety is pluri- ethnic and composed of diverse communities (twelve in 2003),speaking five distinctive languages: two Tupian languages (Kamayura and Aueti), twoArawak languages (Yawalapiti and Mehinacu/Waura), and four dialects of one Cariblanguage (Kuikuru, Kalapalo, Matipu, and Nafuqua). They all differ somewhat from oneanother, in part related to their divergent histories in the region, but all generally sharethe same cultural values and traditions, and all form a moral community and definethemselves as a people. They are \"human,\" what the Kuikuru call kuge,3 and other"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"peoples, whether indigenous or not, are considered a little less human: prone toviolence, unpredictable, and wild (nikogo) -like witches.Xinguanos are not typical of broader Amazonian cultural patterns, at least not thosetraditionally viewed as typical of all or most of the region by anthropologists workingthere: that is, as small, egalitarian, politically autonomous, and impermanent \"tropicalforest tribes.\" Xinguano peoples are also notable for their unique way ofaccommodating cultural pluralism within a peaceful, if not always harmonious, way oflife. Virtually surrounded by groups that valorize aggressive masculinity andbellicosity, Xinguano actively avoid open hostility and abhor violence and murder.Ritualized \"warfare\" occurs between Xinguano communities, specifically in the contextof the intertribal spear-throwing competitions between two villages, and, moregenerally, the wrestling matches that occur between villages, especially the chieflyfuneral ceremony.' Open hostilities or warfare between communities is virtuallyunknown, although armed conflicts between Xinguanos and other indigenous groupshave occurred multiple times in the past, even though seldom at the instigation of theXinguanos 5Violence, aggression, and blood are epistemologically linked: blood causes aggressiveor violent tendencies, it makes people violent and people are stigmatized, dangerous,for having human blood \"on their hands.\" This belief is rooted in creation myths, for theKuikuro did not accept the bowl of blood offered them by the creator. This distinguishesthem from their neighbors, traditionally warlike groups of Tupian and G8-speakingpeoples, and from white people (who did accept the blood offering), and it permeatestheir lives, most obviously in their food restrictions on game (Heckenberger 2001). Thisbelief forms the ontological foundation of otherness for the Xinguanos: it is what makesthem \"good,\" \"peaceful,\" and \"beautiful,\" and what makes others much less so-\"wildIndians,\" white people, and witchesthose against whom war must occasionally bewaged.There is one major exception to Xinguano taboos against bloodshedwitches, as withother dangerous and life-threatening animals, like jaguars, anacondas, poisonous snakes(there are food taboos for these creatures but they are killed routinely). Killing witchesis not only accepted in some situations, but is sanctioned by chiefly decree and at leastpartial public opinion. Overt aggression seldom occurs outside of the witchcraftcomplex, the immoral and covert actions of witches and the overt and legitimate(although dangerous and stigmatized nonetheless) actions of counterwitches, diviners,chiefs, and executioners, bent on rooting out and eliminating the hidden evil lurking in"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"the midst of human society. Their response is commonly decisive, whether throughritual or warfare, and retaliation against enemies is equally decisive, with the single-minded purpose to destroy the enemy, whether within or without.Triangle of Power: Witches, Chiefs, and ShamansWitchcraft, following convention, describes the aggressive and immoral use ofsupernatural techniques (Walker 1989:3). In the anthropological literature, witchcraft iscommonly addressed from either a sociological and psychological perspective: theformer focused on the functions of witchcraft and the actions it entails, the latter onbeliefs and the effects they have on individuals. But, as Lawrence notes, \"sorcery andhealing must be placed in the total cosmic framework that people conceive to exist: notonly in the human socio-political structure and not only in the religious system butsimultaneously in both\" (1987:21). On the one hand, witchcraft is in the realm ofinstitutional violence, along with feuding and warfare, but, on the other hand, it liessquarely in the domain of the supernatural, like shamanism.In an overview on sorcery and witchcraft in Melanesia, Stephen (1987) helps framecertain issues relevant to Amazonia, as Africa had once before helped define problemsin Melanesia. Indeed, Amazonia shares much in common with Melanesia-andelsewhere, for that matter (i.e., \"witchcraft\" in \"precapitalist\" societies and theidiosyncracies of the region or its cases will shed light on very general issues). AsStephen notes, witches and sorcerers (shamans)' both channel spiritual power, although\"their mediation of that power is in opposite directions.... The sorcerer acceptsresponsibility for life and death and thus gains influence; the witch is forced to takeblame for misfortune and death and thus faces social ruin\" (251). The sorcerer, Stephensuggests, is defined by cosmic responsibility, controlled/active use of cosmic power,support of the moral order, and is socially rewarded. Shamanism is an instrument of thepowerful. The witch, in contrast, is defined by cosmic blame: the uncontrolled/passiveuse of power for destructive ends and against the social and moral order. It is a positionheld by the weak, the antisocial, and the punished.Stephen further notes that in societies \"with marked structural inequalities-as betweenjunior and senior, wife-givers and wife-takers-sorcery within the community may(although not necessarily) be deemed appropriate to maintain the relationship ofdominance or privilege. Where the only important structural differentiation is betweeninsiders and outsiders, then sorcery will be deemed proper only against the enemy or itsuse may be eschewed altogether\" (273). This also rings true for Amazonia, although we"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"might frame the question differently, as focused inward versus outward, based notmerely on what is seen as proper but what is deemed possible. It is a war within societyover power, between rivals but not openly enemies.Witchcraft is about power, it is, like power in general, about the ability of someindividuals to coerce or control others due to their special status or role. Witchcraftoccurs primarily in the context of rivalry and threats between individuals of certainsocial statuses; that is, it occurs against certain individuals by certain individuals. Thusthere is a close relationship between witchcraft and the chieftaincy, as there is betweenwitchcraft and shamanism. But this invisible power is a double-edged blade, a weaponof the weak, because its boundless threat humbles even the most powerful. And thepowerful, because they have the power to indict others of it, mete out the only form ofviolent punishment known to the Xinguanos; counterwitch ordeals and execution.Power is diffusely distributed in Xinguano communities, but we can distinguish twoprimary sources of it through the interpenetrating dimensions by which individualsacquire influence and control others. The first is secular and involves the personalefficacy and success of individuals, in trade, industry, and family, for instance, and isachieved without significant interaction with or control over supernatural forces. Thesecond source directly involves the supernatural as well as some special abilities to\"channel\" the generally unseen forces of nature and the cosmos: that is, \"invisible\"power. All adult men and women have some capacity to control \"spirits,\" most notablyin the numerous rituals that involve forest and aquatic spirits, but some individuals havesignificantly greater means to control cosmic power. For example, chiefs controlancestral power, shamans control the spiritual power of nature, and witches (darkshamans), like curing shamans (those who do not enter trance to commune with spirits)control several forms of practical magic.In Amazonia, there has been a common tendency to conflate diverse social roles underthe generic term shaman, which has come to refer to any religious specialist or healer;that is, men and occasionally women who have some special, typically achieved, controlover supernatural forces. The Kuikuru have shamans who can go into trance andshamans who cannot, herbalists who also heal the sick, and the unknown or suspectedwitches and known counterwitches. Unlike some places, where shamans primarily act asintermediaries or conduits of spiritual forces that generally affect human conditions,Xinguano shamans largely deal with illness, both kwifi oto (create or exacerbate it) andfiati (diagnose and, hopefully, remedy it). When they cannot remedy it and the patientdies, they can only implicate the source of the illness through trance, and it then falls to"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"the family or the chief to mete out justice. Powerful shamans, those who can inducetrance, may divine the source of an ailment or misfortune, a witch or spirit, but the jobof dealing with this spirit is largely up to others. Shamans do not, generally, do battlewith evil spirits but rather merely look for them. Once found, the spirit or witch must bedealt with through ritual.Good shamans, intermediaries between the world of body and spirit, can channelspiritual forces to diagnose misfortune and treat illness. Dark shamans, masters ofwitchcraft, stand in opposition to them, creating and guiding illness and misfortune,also in the liminal realm between humans and evil spirits. Xinguano witchcraft andshamanism are about health and illness and the bodies of people, but not all bodies areequal. Thus, another social role and institution almost invariably comes into play, thatof chiefdom.In some social contexts witchcraft colors all social relations, through fear, anger, andpowerlessness (Basso 1984), but witchcraft and shamanism are also costly business-thatis, it is expensive to support the ritual actions used to counter witchcraft and noteveryone has the means to do it. Witchcraft executions are not only personal affairs ofrevenge between the aggrieved and their presumed assailants, but also juro-politicalinstruments of social control and moral judgment. Ideally, an execution should becarried out with the authorization of the primary village chief, even though chiefspublicly denounce both witchcraft and witch executions and commonly criticize othersfor indulging their authority to liberally-unjustlykill witches (Gregor 1977; Ireland1986).The term chief (or headman) is no less problematic. Xinguanos have chiefs (aneti ),'men and women who rise to unusual prominence owing in large part to hereditaryprivilege. They also have \"great\" men and women, individuals who rise to publicprominence due to their notable political actions: they act \"like a chief\" in publicevents. Further, they sometimes become de facto chiefs, and their power rivals that ofthe \"great\" chiefs, the aneti hekugu. Then there are a variety of men and women, whodue to their heritage (aneti nsono, or secondary chiefs) or their achievements-forexample, as bow-masters, wrestlers, singers, dancers, story tellers, or crafts persons -areconsidered \"great,\" but generally they do not aspire to political leadership.'Each person is constructed by a complex interplay between heredity, the achievementsand motivations of the individual, and, for lack of a better word, serendipity. Chiefs areborn to power: a chief is a person born of an aneti line, although they can become"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"anything they wish, or are coerced into becoming. Chiefs can be shamans, they can bealso good musicians, craftsmen, and so forth, or, as is commonly the case, good at manythings (loki ). The reverse is not true: although diverse factors cumulatively defineindividuals, if a person is not born of the right bloodline or of the right substance, aneti,they will never become a chief, although chiefly rank is not isomorphic withprominence or political power (Heckenberger 2001). Further, an established or \"sitting\"chief is not generally thought to be a witch. In fact, owing to their public prominence,chiefs and their families are the preferred targets of witchcraft: chiefs and witches aretraditional enemies. In this context it is important to note that although it is uncommonfor chiefs to be witches, witches are often their accomplices or henchmen.Like chiefs, witches are not born but made. Indeed, we might say that chiefs are bornto power (legitimate power) and witches to evil (illegitimate or immoral power). Likechiefs, witches are taught by their fathers through an arduous process, one that involvesa long apprenticeship that changes the body and mind of the initiate. Such changesinclude procedures like replacing the eye fluid in order to see better at night, attachingpoisonous ants to the fingertips to harden them against poisons lethal to the untrainedhand, and spending time in a covered pit beneath a bonfire to prepare for the inevitableantiwitchcraft, the kune (see Carneiro 1977 and Gregor 1977 for more description).Thus, like chiefs, not everyone can become a witch, it is highly secretive and typicallypassed down from father to son. Not all sons of witches become witches, however, andonly rarely does accusation implicate directly fathers or sons (I was also told thatwomen become witches).Unlike chiefs and witches, shamans do not inherit special substance, specialknowledge, or corporeal discipline from their parents, grandparents, or older ancestors.Individuals may well aspire to become shamans, although they typically decide tobecome one after receiving a vision while gravely ill. Shamans generally are not seen asinheriting their shamanic qualities, although the predisposition does run strong in somefamilies and varies within the region. With the Kamayura, for instance, chieflyauthority and shamanism are closely linked. In fact, shamanism is something of avillage specialty among the Kamayura, and the most powerful shamans are the reigningchiefly family. During my time in Amazonia the Aueti chief was a specialist incounterwitchcraft, which, as was pointed out to me, is something of a village specialty.Each villager is said to know something about witchcraft, because the counterwitch, theprimary chief in this case, uses some of the same techniques (making charms) andsubstances (often considered poisonous to others) that the witch uses, and some"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"counterwitches, I was told, may even be reformed witches. There are eight shamansamong the Kuikuru, only two of whom can divine or go into trance, at leastindependently from the others (occasionally groups of shamans will perform a \"soul-recovery\"), but neither of these two are primary chiefs.Chieftaincy is about power. Although it is not only about power, the dominant idiomis hierarchy, the type of hierarchy that creates pervasive structural inequalities and isconsidered characteristic of transitional societiesbetween \"egalitarian\" society and thestate is the chiefdom. Witchcraft is likewise about power, and is intimately tied to thestrategies and negotiations of people. Dole (1973, 1966), suggests that the \"occasionalkilling of a supposed sorcerer is a process of social selection through which antisocialindividuals are eliminated. Witchcraft is a social ill, and there can be no doubt thatsociety will try to purge itself of these `marginal' people, and it seems likely that`marginal' people are often implicated.\" Dole (1966) and Carneiro (1977) both describesuch instances, in the former case through an example of a powerful shamansuccessfully implicating a witch, and, in the latter, how an accusation was deterred dueto the threat of retaliation. Ireland (1996) forcefully argues, through precisegenealogical histories spanning over a century, that there is much more to witchcraftexecutions than this: it is not only about struggles between the powerful and the weakbut about power more generally, including between the powerful. Witchcraft conformsto certain planes of social structure -in other words it commonly involves specificsocial roles, notably chiefly rivals. Thus, while perhaps there is a correlation between\"marginal men\" and suspected witches, as Dole suggests, some rather prominentindividuals are also \"suspected,\" on occasion.Witchcraft and Disease\"The great irony about Kuikuru witchcraft,\" Carneiro notes, is that although \"itprobably does not exist\" in terms of Western explanations of illness, \"nothing is morefirmly rooted in the mind of a Kuikuru than the notion that most of his afflictions aredirectly due to sorcery, and that a number of persons he comes into contact with everyday are witches\" (1977:222). Illness and death are always seen as the result ofmalevolent forces, witches, evil spirits, and monsters: etseke. In the upper Xingu, actualinstances of witchcraft are rare and are generally known through accusations andcountermeasures, as elsewhere in the Americas (Walker 1989:3). It is not somethingcarried out in public, but instead is a series of actions done, to great extent, in secret. Itis a very sensitive and emotional topic, one that people do not talk about freely or"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"spontaneously. Accusations, divinations, and executions are likewise private anddangerous affairs.There are various medical techniques, esoteric knowledge, and specialists to treatillness, many of which are put to work, often repeatedly, when someone is not well.Regardless of diagnosis and treatment, however, all agree that the root of illness, whatcauses it, is spiritual not biological in nature. Cures are naturally spiritual, first andforemost, although practitioners-shaman, herbalists, and, today, health monitors(indigenous \"nurses\") -treat both the symptoms and the cause. Thus, while manyKuikuru who have been exposed to Western medical practitioners and ideas for overhalf a century have a good notion of the epidemiological theory of disease transmission,they believe that witchcraft lies at the heart of most illness and death. Why one persongets sick and recovers while others die, or why one person gets ill, or their house getsstruck by lightning, or they get bitten by a snake, and others don't, is because they weretargeted by some evil force, usually witchcraft.There are many spirits that can also do harm; in my household alone, I saw varioustypes. Among the more dramatic were three attempted soul recoveries, all on the samesmall boy (discussed below) and in each case from forest and water spirits (see Basso1973; Carneiro 1977). The spirit of the ihagaku (jawari)9 was thought to have caused anillness in the chief's mother who was already weakened by long-term illness, andappropriate ceremonies and basic shamanistic treatment were conducted. At one point Iwas thought to have been attacked by Ahaca, the spirit called \"father of the forest,\" afterhaving spent the day in an archaeological site far from the village and deep in the forest(I was diagnosed and treated for malaria). In another case an elderly woman from aneighboring house, long thought bewitched, was apparently killed by Tuangi(Mavutsini), the creator for seeing his magical shell necklaces stashed in the forest (orso she told a kinswoman in a dream after her death). These attacks can lead to death, butdeath usually is attributed not to a failed offering but a misdiagnosis.The more common source of human suffering is witches, both flying witches andother changelings, who take on other forms to travel great distances and steal intoneighboring villages.10 Some are so powerful that they can raise an evil wind thatdestroys whole villages, others can bring pestilence or predation to crops, or drawmosquitos or lightning to villages or individual houses. In one case a witch brought ajaguar to the door of one Kuikuru family to lie in wait for its unsuspecting victim, inthis case a young boy who was killed by it. Although some witches are believed to beable to breathe illness onto people, witchcraft generally involves the use of diverse"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"\"charms\" (Gregor 1977), and assault sorcerers or witches are \"masters of charms\"-whatthe Kuikuru call kurife oto. The Kuikuru recognize two primary techniques, bothinvolving tiny fragments (exuviae) of the intended victim: the witch secrets away thecharm, which leads to prolonged sickness and death, or, more commonly, they shoot itinto the victim with a tiny arrow and the victim then soon dies.'1Witchcraft is cited in Xinguano narratives as a general force that seems to come inwaves. According to the Kuikuru, the \"old ones\" -the old evilhad returned in the time ofKarl von den Steinen (Kalusi): witches have always been there to threaten society, butwere of varying strengths and number. I was told of witches that could conjure an \"evilwind\" that infected whole villages, who had, in fact, laid waste to several villages in theearly- to mid-twentieth-century epidemics. The destruction of whole villages is alsoremembered by the Waura for this time (Ireland 1988). These narratives no doubt referto epidemics in the area, but, as Ireland suggests, traditional \"theories of disease cannotaccount for an epidemic of communicable disease, unless it is viewed as the result of anepidemic of witchcraft\" (1988:170).Disease and witchcraft are linked and, therefore, witchcraft and countermeasures aredirectly correlated with the frequency of illness and death. In the past, in recentcenturies, there have been several episodes of catastrophic depopulation due toepidemic diseases, each eventually running its course and leaving the survivors morebiologically and culturally \"adjusted\" to the reality of epidemics, at least temporarily,but also taking staggering tolls on regional populations. The first wave of direct contactwas in the mid-1700s, when bandeirantes seeking fame and fortune in the remotehinterlands of colonial hegemony, as often as not reaped in human souls, \"descended\"and \"domesticated\" Indians as converts and slaves, and with them also came disease.Catastrophic diseases apparently struck even earlier based on the decreased village sizeand abandonment of large tracts of land. Epidemics of \"witchcraft diseases\" occurredwhen the white man (Steinen) returned.Witchcraft is very real in the eyes of the Kuikuru and, in fact, there are physical clues(markings, charms, visions in dreams) referring to its exis- tence.12 As is commonlythe case, however, it is the beliefs that people have about the abilities and actions ofothers, rather than direct observation or knowledge of the dark ways, that guides theactions people take to avoid attacks or to counter them (see Middleton and Winter1963:4). The fact is that any death can be attributed to witchcraft and any person, orvirtually any person (chiefs are seldom seen to be witches), can be a witch. Witches,like other individuals, are socially constructed through suspicion, innuendo, accusation,"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"and, notably, ritual techniques that attempt to root out the guilty: witch trials and huntstypically involve indictments and often have a verdict. Witchcraft is thus not only aboutthe number of deaths but also certain deaths or types of deaths, particularly those ofchiefs.The Witch-HuntIt was the height of the rainy season when I first arrived in the Kuikuru village inJanuary 1993. Village life was relaxed, as this was a relatively slow time owing to theheavy rains. The mood was also upbeat because there was much to be happy about:leadership was strong; crops were plentiful; the village population, some 330 persons,was the largest it had been since the 18oos; their anthropologist had come to town witha new motor boat, gifts, and novelties; and the end of the rains, the time of harvest andfestival, was coming. Things were good.The prosperity of the Kuikuru village and the community's satisfaction with itssituation was in part a reflection of strong village leadership, in particular the primaryvillage chief-the hugogo dto. This was manifest in public opinion, support of the chief'sprojects and aspirations, and, ultimately, the request by the community at large toconstruct a taj)fe (chief's house). The tajife is one of two structures in the village thatare built by the community but are \"owned\" by the chief and comprise his symbolicestate. A beautiful village is embodied in the chief as the \"owner\" or \"custodian\" (oto)not only of the tajife and kuakutu (men's house), but of the village center itself-thehugogo, just as the chief is objectified in the beautiful village, the constructions, themonuments, that the community builds in the name of and places in guardianship of thehugogo bto,13 who, so objectified, represents the center, the ancestors, the community.Lurking just at the edge of this prosperity was misfortune, in this case the maliciousactions of witches. Death is a part of life, and Xinguanos are no stranger to it.Witchcraft, at least the threat of it, is therefore omnipresent, but it is not really acommon part of daily life. Fears, suspicions, and rumors about someone not feelingwell, about minor illnesses, or about things that happened in the past are common, butthings that herbal remedies or basic shamanic healing \"cure\" are passed over quickly.People often get seriously ill and die, but many people recover and many deaths go bywith only little debate and no redressive action. Only grave illness, serious misfortune,and death typically result in \"witch scares,\" and usually when such problems occur innumbers. And, further, only some deaths demand full-blown witch-hunts, and these donot happen every day."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"A death in the family. I was away from the village when the deaths began in lateMarch 1993. I had gone to Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro for a couple of weeks to collectfurther supplies and report back to the outside world that all was well. When I returned,however, things were not well, particularly for my new Kuikuru family, that of thechief, the hugogo dto. His eldest son and heir had died several days before I returned.This death and three more in close succession, including the toddler sons of the hugogodto and another chiefly (aneti) couple, colored many aspects of village life for the nextnine months. In fact, the formal mourning period only ended some thirteen monthslater, in August 1994, at the completion of the kuarup, the chiefly funeral ritual that isthe keystone of Xinguano ritual life.Little could have prepared me for the changes that had transpired in the village inthose brief few weeks, and nothing would be the same afterward. At 11 P.M. when Iarrived back in the village it was dark, much like the first time I had strolled into theKuikuru village. But now a difference could be sensed immediately. The men's house inthe center of the village had been reduced to a skeleton, with only a few stubby postsand a pile of rubble vaguely discernable. And something else was amiss, somethingmore deeply evocative: soon after I had entered the imposing central plaza (a quarterkilometer in diameter), I could hear a low wailing emanating from the houses that layacross the plaza-where I lived-opposite the port road from which I had entered thevillage.The chief's son-heir apparent to the line of ancestral power that long ago had passedthrough his great-grandfather, his grandmother, and then to his father-had died the mosthorrible death, in the Kuikuru eyes: it was just at the time when he was preparing hispublic debut from more than a year of household seclusion (a rite of passage that allKuikuru pass through, but that is particularly long and important for chieflyindividuals). The death of the chief's son only confirmed what he had long felt: hisrivals were responsible for the death and illness of his family members, including bothhis mother's long-term illness (she had been essentially confined to her hammock thewhole year I was there) and his own personal ailments, which he had been treated forrepeatedly, both in and out of the village. A couple of days after I returned, a relative ofthe chief arrived from a neighboring village to pay his respects. During his brief visit heimplicated a man in a third village as the witch. This man-a \"known\" witch-remainedthe primary suspect throughout the four-month witch-hunt that began upon the son'sdeath and afterward. The chief was certain throughout the investigation that the witchdid not act alone but was supported by political rivals, yet he was never fully certain, or"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"certain for long, who precisely they were.A strong suspicion of guilt is sometimes enough to prompt a kinsman to avengehimself on a suspected witch, but this is a wholly personal act and is not viewed aslegitimate by society. To justify an execution there are trials that should be performed,namely the kune counterwitchcraft ritual that, if conducted properly, will reveal thewitch (see Carneiro 1977). The trial in volves the help of a shaman and a counterwitchand is usually carried out only by prominent families because it is extremely expensive.Furthermore, the execution must be authorized by the village chief. In the present case,because the bereaved was the village chief there was therefore no justifiable way to seekvengeance except through the meticulous operation of the kune.Trip to the Karaja. On April 4, three days after arriving back in the village, I left againto accompany the chief and two of his young brothers on an expedition to visit anelderly Karaja man, who lived some five hundred miles away on the Araguaia River.The night before, the chief had explained to me that, after his son's death, the familyhad begun preparations for the kune. In preparing the body for burial, they had removedseveral parts (head hair, the fleshy tip of the right index finger, and a small bit from thethumb palm of the left hand) to be incorporated into the kune charm. These pieces,exuviae, were all carefully guarded in a coffee can in the small house where I now lived.For security, the chief set armed guards at both doors of the house, as well as sentinelsat each of the three major road entrances to the village: the witch could take on one ofmany forms (e.g., a jaguar, a deer, a dog, an airplane) and come into the village in thedark of night to steal the exuviae, which were intended for charms meant not only toidentify but to kill them.At mid-day we set out for the village of the Karaja, traveling upriver to the first stopat the border post of the Parque Indigena do Xingu. We arrived at the post as dusk fell,which was profoundly unsettling to my companions because in the small, openmotorboat we were especially vulnerable to attack by the witches in one or another oftheir night guises. This trepidation continued during our overland trip to the Braziliantown of Canarana, but as we put distance between us and the post it began to subside.The old Karaja shaman was in Sao Felix when we arrived, but the chief and hisbrothers went with him to the village of Santa Isabel the next day. I was not present asthe shaman tied the hair of the deceased son into four small \"dolls\" in human form to beincorporated by a Xinguano specialist into a counterwitchcraft charm. Indeed, I did notsee the dolls until the day, a week or so later, that a specialist in counterwitchcraft"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"(considered a kind of \"good witch,\" but a witch nonetheless) incorporated them into thefinished charms. I did, however, help prepare the payment of several kilos of glassbeads and other valuables.Death of the second son. On our return to the Kuikuru village on April 13 more direnews awaited us: two more Kuikuru were gravely ill-the youngest toddler son of theKuikuru chief and a pregnant woman. Although things were already astir and witchcraftwas on the tip of many tongues, the issue of witchcraft and the identity of the witchbecame more intense with additional illnesses, particularly after a young Kuikuru girlreported that she had been visited by the suspected witch. The witch had, reportedly,secretly visited the Kuikuru village one night and, among other things, asked the younggirl about the whereabouts of Afukaka and several villagers. He also hinted that he hadindeed killed the chief's son. I learned then that this witch had once lived in the Kuikuruvillage and was considered responsible for the death of several other Kuikuru. He wasforced to flee when the brother of one of the victims had attempted to kill him.The ill feelings about the death of the chief's eldest son were exacerbated by theincreasingly grave illness of the youngest son. Further tension, over the propertreatment of the toddler, emerged between a FUNAi nurse, who had arrived in thevillage while we were away, and the Kuikuru shamans, of which there were eight in1993. Soon after I arrived in the village, the nurse sought me out to convince me, so thatI might convince the chief, that his son was mortally ill from meningitis, she thought,and that he needed to be taken to Brasilia as soon as possible for treatment. On the otherside, several shamans explained to me that this would be a serious mistake because thechild's soul had been \"stolen\" by a spirit, and to remove him from the village, to furtherseparate him from his disembodied soul, meant certain death. Although the chiefacknowledged the sincere concern and reasoning of the nurse, he agreed with theassessment of the shamans, and he allowed them to attempt a soul recovery (see Basso1973; Carneiro 1977).The soul recovery required a collective effort of multiple shamans, smoking togetherin a circle sequestered in the house of the patient, thus joining their forces with theprincipal shaman in a trance. First they attempted, to no avail, to recover the soul fromthe stump of a large tree behind the house where they thought a forest spirit hadsequestered it. They then attempted, without success, to recover it from the nearby lake,and then again from the tree trunks that lay, like fallen giants, in front of the house (theremnants of the permanently canceled project to build a chief's house). Shamanisticdiagnosis is not an exact science, and various things were tried, but more and more the"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"chief became open to the idea of radical measures: taking the patient to the city. We setoff to meet a plane coming from Brasilia, via the FUNAI Posto Leonardo, where, afterfurther efforts by a Kamayura shaman in the Yawalapiti village adjacent to the post, theyounger son died before the plane arrived.On returning to the village, the body of the deceased child was prepared, washed,painted, and adorned. Like his older brother, hair was collected from the body as werethe flesh of the right index fingertip and left palm. The body was interred in a deep (twometer) single pit and a small pot was placed over the head. The fingertip was placed ona heated griddle in the village center. The heat caused the tip to jump, signifying thefinger of the deceased victim pointing to his assailants. The appropriate body parts weregathered and guarded overnight with those of the older brother. Early the next day, wewere off to the Aueti village, some four or five hours away by foot and motorboat, toprepare the next step of the kune.Trip to the Aueti. We walked for about an hour from the Curisevo River port to theAueti village, and we spent much of the time talking-the chief, his younger brothers,and I-about the histories of the area, the relations between the villages, and the plantsand animals we encountered along the way. But I could feel a tension building as weneared our destination. Our talk became less jovial, more serious, and then simply diedout as we approached the village. The memories of the events that brought us hereclosed in upon us, just as the closed space of the forest opened into the fields andparklands encircling the village. We were here on serious business, here to traffic withwitches, good witches in this case, but witches nonetheless: holders of a deep, ancientknowledge that is the root of most human suffering.Unlike most Xinguanos, who often travel to visit relatives in other villages, majorvillage chiefs generally do not informally visit other villages. Their presence is a publicaffair, the occasion of unusual formality and ceremony, and is typically a harbinger ofmajor happenings or special, usually ritual, events. Relations between the Aueti and theKuikuru are especially tense. Not only do the two speak entirely different languages butfew close ties of kinship link the two villages.We were met in the village with the usual friendly reception that Xinguanos extendedto any visitor, the same hospitality that had made my transition into the Kuikuru villageso smooth. The youngest brother and I, less encumbered with the formality of highoffice and renown, made the rounds that afternoon; the chief and his next youngerbrother did not venture out but stayed in the chief's house, where formal visitors are"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"received. We ate fish and beijii in the chief's house and the chiefs talked amongthemselves, and queried me about the white man, my work, and other things. Much of itwas about the surge of witchcraft and the deaths in the Kuikuru village.Early the next morning, the task at hand took on a concrete form. The Kuikuru andAueti chiefs discussed the payment: two shell necklaces and three shell belts. Afterpayment was made, we went to a clearing in the forest close behind the chief's house,where the Aueti chief, the counterwitch, prepared the charms to be brought back to theKuikuru village to place in the kune pot.The kune. The kune, well described by Carneiro (1977), is a form ofcounterwitchcraft, a pot in which the charms of counterwitchcraft are boiled. However,the kune is more than an inanimate object-it is spiritlike and it must be fed and caredfor, it is the capture and control of raw spiritual force. To conduct the kune, the chiefpartitioned off a third of his house with sheets of black plastic. The hearth was set up inthe house of the chief's \"uncle\" and stepfather-in-law, where he and his family had setup residence. The kune was begun two days after we arrived back at the village on April21. During the first week of the kune, evidence was mounting that the witch was indeedthe man implicated earlier.The chief contracted one of the two shamans (of eight) who could successfully enterinto trance through inhalation of large doses of tobacco smoke. Even though the shamanwas a close relative of the chief (their fathers being first parallel cousins), the shamanwas subtly implicated at various stages of the witch-hunt, either as an accomplice or anactual witch. He had been, in fact, indicted for witchcraft some decades before, whichresulted in his move along with his kinsfolk to the Yawalapiti village in the mid-1970s.In several conversations, the chief told me that he questioned the shaman's truthfulnessor motives; nonetheless, throughout the kune ritual the shaman came to the house inwhich I lived every few nights to counter the actions of the witch who, in an effort ofself-defense, was trying to spoil the kune pot by placing charms meant to corrupt it.The shaman would come to the house and go into trance by inhaling large quantitiesof tobacco smoke, during which time he could consult with diverse spirits regarding theactions of the witch, the location of the kurife planted in and around the village todestroy the kune. One elder chief from another village plainly described what I alsosuspected; he said, \"you do know that it is that old shaman that is helping your friend[tending the chief's counterwitchcraft device] who is planting the charms\" (see alsoGregor 1977). This shaman produced various small charms consisting of small pieces of"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"twine or other discarded knickknack-the exuviaewrapped in beeswax around a smalltwig (the Kalapalo use larger ones, he once told me). Various people described\"sightings\" of things that demonstrated witchery: the witch screaming at night andplunging into the river to escape the intense burning sympathetically produced throughthe counterwitchcraft; a set of jaguar footprints over the deceased's grave, a sure signthat the witch, in the guise of a jaguar, had visited the village.The kune lasted nearly four months. During much of this time, the shaman cared for itnearly every other night, and the chief and his family labored through the strenuoustasks of providing water and fuel for it. But in the end it did not kill the witch. Severalfailed execution attempts were made, but the chief tired of the whole business, himselfvaluing human life so much that even the shadow of a doubt was unacceptable. Theindicted man was neither a threat nor a rival to the chief. The man was indeed marginal,having been repeatedly accused of witchcraft and forced to flee village after village, butwas no longer a member of the Kuikuru village. The primary suspect throughout thewitch-hunt was a man from a neighboring village who had lived in the Kuikuru villageabout ten years before, seeking refuge from the Kalapalo village of Aiha due to anearlier accusation. He fled Aiha to the Magiapei (Nafuqua) village, but returned to Aihawhen his situation in the Nafuqua village deteriorated, once again as a result ofwitchcraft accusations. (This supports Basso's (1973) observation that one accusationleads to another; that is that witches have a life history).A threat more insidious than witches, because there is virtually no way to retaliate,comes from the witches' accomplices: people who contract witches to avenge someperceived threat or slight from their political rivals. In the present case, the chief wascertain that, in the case of both of his sons, multiple people conspired in the attacks onhis family, including the chief felt, his grandfather (his namesake), his mother, his twosons from his first wife, and younger son of his second wife.Five years after the egitse (kuarup) funeral ceremony was held in 1994, the ihagaku(jawari) was held (in lggg) to mark the end of the long kua- rup cycle and the end to theformal mourning. However, regarding the veneration of the dead, there are constantreminders for the living. Still today, the principal bridge-a massive construction of tree-trunk footings sunken deeply into the wet ground, large (one to two feet wide) logs withflat tops or, commonly, hand-hewn boards from large trees-is \"owned\" by the son. Manycomplain of the difficulties of arriving at the Kuikuru village; when I arrived in fact, atthe height of the rainy season, we waded through high water ranging in depth from thighto chest level. Still, I look back at it fondly and sadly. It was not just any death."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"ConclusionDuring my stay in the Kuikuru village I spent many hours in my hammock thinkingabout witchcraft. In fact, it was hard not to because, given the recent deaths, scarcely aday went by when I wouldn't hear some mention of witchcraft. The problem I oftenthought about was visibility, the inability to visualize things at different scales ofanalysis and, thus, the common pitfall of retrodicting present conditions into the past or,worse still, assuming that invisibility meant irrelevance. No matter how central orimportant the institution of witchcraft is in the present, how can we be certain that itwas so in the past; in other words, how do we extend our observations about theethnographic present into the past? Or, more precisely, how do we compare differenttypes of things, different types of \"bodies,\" at different spatio-temporal scales?We are on firm ethnological ground to suggest that witchcraft has very ancient roots,perhaps leading back, in one form or another, to the earliest groups who entered theAmericas in late Pleistocene times. At the minimum it is a central feature of manyAmazonian peoples, particularly Arawak and culturally related groups (e.g., Bakairi,Karaja) in southern Amazonia. In one form or another witchcraft relates to a medicaltheoryshamanism and so forth-from elsewhere, a thousand years ago or before. Theroots of witchcraft run deep and to speak of the ultimate causes in the past of somethinglike witchcraft, something for which there are few historical clues as to its existence, letalone its nature, one must suspend history. There is little point, therefore, in searchingfor the \"ultimate\" or \"root\" cause of the witchcraft complex itself, its existence, whatoverarching function it served, or what \"caused it\" at its moment of origin. Like mostthings, the absolute origins of an institution-the origin of the related ideas andpractices-are hard to fix very precisely.We can, however, consider proximate (historical) causes and their immediate effects,gauged in terms of real people, communities, institutions, families. Surely there havebeen significant changes in the institution of witchcraft but we can at least be fairly surethat it, in some form or another (something like kwifi oto), existed in the past, and thatshamans and chiefs battled with witches (we can more clearly retrodict contemporarychiefs, at least, into the past due to the continuity of their \"place,\" the spatial metaphorof their person, the plaza; see Heckenberger 2001). What is constant is that humanagents negotiate between the past (tradition), the present historical situation, and thefuture they have in mind for themselves. The prob - lem is twofold: first, there is thefrequency and nature of illness and death, and, second, there is the nature of the socialand political relations in relation to it. What differs is the historical contexts through"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"which the institution, changing and reinterpreted but showing substantial consistencythrough time, actually passed through over time, the actual social relations and actionsthat are tied to it and that reproduced the meanings through action.The Xinguano case demonstrates once again the efficacy of the unseenthe cultural,social, and political forces that lie behind the more visible material conditions ofsubsistence technology and demography. It is not possible to fully address the questionof historical efficacy here (see, e.g., Foucault 1980; Sahlins 1981), the effects of thingsseen and unseen, the \"reality\" and social agency of things, whether human or not. Whatis clear, however, is the efficacy of witchcraft to move people to action. It is some thingseemingly so esoteric as to be overlooked altogether in many considerations of politicalpower and economy, cultural evolution, and human ecology, as well as mythology andkinship, because these notions are antimythic (forgotten) and antisocial.Xinguano witchcraft, which by and large is only visible in the fairly narrow timeframe of the present or recent past, provides several important insights into Xinguanohistory. First, it demonstrates that history is far more complicated, structurally, at alllevels, than is commonly portrayed: its situation is complex. Witchcraft alsodemonstrates, in particular, the importance of political factors, power, ideology, andritual in structuring people's lives, and, therefore, that narrow views of culturalstructures or changes in them that ignore the importance of culture in favor of ecology,behavior, or adaptive fitness will surely fall wide of the mark in understanding culturaldiversity and change in Amazonia. Witchcraft also suggests that broad characterizationsof, for instance, shamans, chiefs, and witches, particularly as generalized types, ignorethe marked variability within and between Amazonian societies: that is, simply put,there are innumerable interests involved that resolve into diverse and flexible socialroles, and that actors mold cultural, social, and ecological \"structures\" to their wills,actively.However, the structures that mold people, that constrain subjects as they areconstructed in the context of diverse power relations, operate at diverse social scales;that is, of the persons. The person, in other words, is fractal and resolves into different\"bodies\" at different scales: among which we might recognize, for conceptual if notanalytical purposes, a distinction between a historical person (the \"cultural body\"), asocial person (the \"body politic\"), and an individual in the world of social and historicalrelations (the \"mindful body\") (see Scheper-Hughes 1994; Wagner 1gg1). Analytically,these correlate, crudely, with quantifiable social entities (communities, families,individuals), and although each of them is commonly visible they operate, or have lives,"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"at different spatio-temporal scales. That is, our models of the nature or origin ofwitchcraft or its influence on other things, sociological or psychological, political orreligious, structural or contingent, are scale dependent. They operate over the long-termof historical periods, the demographic curves of epidemic depopulation recovery overgenerations; the middle-term of operating systems and the actual institutions or schemathat underlie them-shamanism, chieftaincy, or witchcraft; and the short-term of actualacts that generate these longer histories and larger bodies.My interest is Xinguano history, particularly its history on a large scale, the \"big\"picture of major patterns over generations, centuries, and millennia. Little was knownabout this history in 1992 when I went to the field, but from an anthropologicalperspective this history began late, after about 1885 when reports from the ethnologicalexpedition led by Karl von den Steinen first brought news of the area and its people tothe attention of the Western world. The year I spent with the Kuikuru is to some hardlyan event, but it is significant in the view of decades or generations; further, we cannarrow the \"event horizon\" to more discrete moments in time that, likewise, had atremendous influence on the flow of things.Notes1 I stayed with the Kuikuru from January to December 1993; the deaths occurredbetween March 26 and December 25, 1993. Witchcraft was an issue that came up, inone way or another, in each of my subsequent visits to the Kuikuru village in August1994, November 1995, October 1996, July 1999, and August 2000, as well as duringthe several months between 1991 and 1997 when I traveled with Xinguano leaders inBrazil. The National Science Foundation (1992-1994), Social Science ResearchCouncil (1992-1994), William T. Hillman Foundation (1995,1999), and the Universityof Florida (2000) are all gratefully acknowledged for grants that supported myresearch in the upper Xingu.2 Heckenberger 2oooa. Archaeological evidence that corroborates the long-termpresence of Old World epidemic diseases in the upper Xingu, documenting a massivereduction in village and regional population after approximately 1550-1650, onlybecame available through this research (Heckenberger 1996, 20oob).3 Unless noted, I use Kuikuru terms throughout, although the same terms exist in otherlanguages as well.4 These rituals, known as the jawari and kuarup, following the Kamayura terms (iha-"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"gaka and egitse by Kuikuru) are well described in Agostinho 1974 and Basso 1973,among others.5 The best-known example is the 19301 assassination of the Yawalapiti chief andabduction of multiple women by the Aueti, and the subsequent retaliation raid byYawalapiti and allies (Coelho 2000). According to some, the Yawalapiti chief waskilled in this attack because he was a suspected witch. But, this was not the view heldby the Yawalapiti, who saw the attack as open warfare and murder.6 There is no distinction made here between a sorcerer and a witch (see also Carneiro1977). It might be noted, however, that what Melanesianists commonly refer to assorcerer is more or less synonymous with what Amazonianists call shaman; and thuswitches are dark shamans.7 Aneti is the word for any member of the chiefly \"class\" born of a chiefly rankingmother or father, but it is also used to refer to anyone who, de facto, operates like achief.8 Basso describes these bow-masters as specialized warriors, although my ownexperiences lead me to conclude that this status is more generalized, referring to menwhose acumen with the bow makes them particularly good hunters and fishermen, oruseful in those times when armed conflict arises. Note that some individuals showmarkedly different feelings about aggressive conflict or \"bravado\" within the confinesof the general nature of Xinguano soft-spokenness.9 Here Kuikuru words are used with Kamayura (Tupi-Guarani) words, as generic terms,in parentheses.1o These are commonly jaguars or other animals, but on occasion a \"one-eyed\" airplane.ii See Carneiro 1977 for a discussion of the many details of the witchcraft complex,including apprenticeship, techniques, and countermeasures (see also Basso 1973 andGregor 1977 for general discussions).12 This is not always the case because I observed among the Kalapalo, for instance, thatthe ete bto occupied, or \"owned\" the chief's house; and among the Kuikuru andYawalapiti, at least, the hugogo bto owns the center, the men's house, and the chief'shouse.13 Carneiro 1977 provides an excellent summary of the divination ritual based on"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"interviews he conducted in 1975 (although he never witnesses a kune ritual).ReferencesAgostinho de Silva, Pedro. 1974.

I suggest that the demarcation represents one facet ofthe Kulina cultural paradox of \"siblingship,\" the paradox that all members of anendogamous village are close kin (\"siblings\" in the Kulina metaphor) and yet many arealso potential marriage partners (Pollock 1g85b:2000). Shamanic sorcery is a form ofdiscourse about the public performance of siblingship, while nonshamanic sorceryengages the zone of sexuality and affinality. Moreover, the social disruptions of contactwith Brazilians over the past sixty or seventy years and the reconfigurations that haveresulted in the matrix of Kulina social life have shaped and nuanced these forms ofsorcery and their semiotic potential for discursive commentary on social life.The Kulina are an Aruan-speaking group living in western Brazil, where some 2,000group members live in villages scattered throughout the Purus/ Jurua region of theBrazilian states of Acre and Amazonas.' The Kulina are closely related to the Deni(Koop 198o).2 My research was conducted among the Kulina of the upper Purus River,in particular among the community that lived in the village called Maronaua in the late197os and 198os, many of whom now live in the village called Sobral at the site of theabandoned rubber-tapping camp locally known as the Seringal Sobral. Maronaua was arelatively large village of roughly 130 people when I first arrived in 1981. Some 30 orso former residents had recently moved to Sobral but returned often for visits and stillregarded themselves as members of a single local group that had, perhaps temporarily,fissioned over a political dispute.Shamanic SorceryThe ability to perform shamanic sorcery derives from the incorporation of a substancecalled dori into the bodies of young men undergoing shamanic training. Senior shamansplace dori from their own bodies into the bodies of initiates. Ideologically, all youngmen undergo this training as a part of socialization into adulthood, and consequently allKulina men possess this corporeal potential for commission of sorcery. In other words,the ritual context of shamanic training is also the rite of passage into adulthood for allyoung men.Dori is a complex substance that condenses multiple semantic realms. I havedescribed the concept at some length elsewhere (Pollock 1992; 1994a; 1996), and thus"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"will give a somewhat abbreviated perspective here. Dori is the substance that permeatesand largely defines the bodies of men. It creates maleness and the properties ofmaleness; adult male gender in humans (and possibly in animals) is attributed topossession of dori (Pollock 1985a; 1992). Dori is related to semen; when adolescentboys undergo shamanic training and acquire dori, they must not engage in sexualrelations or their dori will be lost along with the newly forming semen, the corporealmark of their adult male identity. Dori is described as a dangerous, caustic substancethat would be poisonous to its owner/possessor if not acquired in the carefullycontrolled setting of ritual training; this poisonous property makes it the shaman'sweapon.Dori gives shamans the ability to heal, but it also renders adult men capable ofinflicting harm, even killing, human enemies and game animals. As a sorcerer, ashaman extracts a portion of the dori from his body and mystically hurls it into the bodyof his victim. There it grows until it kills the victim. Kulina sorcerers may opt merely toharm an enemy, and in such a case shamans can extract the dori from the body of thevictim before death results.The qualities of male gender with which dori invests adult men are found in theirmost basic, raw form in the jaguar, the dzumahe 3 The jaguar is regarded as a solitary,dangerous hunter, a carnivore who hunts at night when the spirit forms of animals andshamans are about in the forest. These qualities are often most socially notable in theirabsence. A brief mention of a case I have described elsewhere illustrates this point. Ayoung adult man I call Awano lived at Maronaua at the time of my first research in thatvillage. He spent a great deal of time tapping rubber, which is a Brazilian, or karia,rather than Kulina economic activity, although Kulina sometimes tap small quantitiesof rubber to buy Brazilian commodities. In spending his time in this way it was felt hewas neglecting his proper duties as a husband and sonin-law, in particular through hisfailure to be a productive hunter. Early one morning Awano was subjected to a ritualintended to \"give him the ability to kill.\" Awano's skin was burned on his upper arm andthe poisonous secretions of a large frog were rubbed into the burn. The frog poisoncaused him to convulse, vomit, and temporarily pass out. While such intentionalpoisonings are widely known in indigenous Amazonia, and have even been explained asa form of (unintentional) therapy for intestinal parasites, the Kulina explicitly describedthis poisoning as a kind of injection of dori intended to jolt Awano back into adultmalehood, especially as a hunter. Indeed, burning the upper arm as a site for theapplication of the frog poison explicitly mimics the Brazilian/Western practice of"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"injecting medications into the muscles of the upper arm: Awano received, in effect, amedicinal dose of dori in a particularly potent form.Dori, then, is present in a number of forms, and is in other animals and even in a fewplants. Dori, as the quintessence or exaggerated form of male gender, is normallybalanced by the \"tame\" or socializing qualities of female substances such as breastmilk, which balances male semen in the formation of a child, and the fermented maniocbeverage called koidza' that women prepare to \"tame\" and resocialize hunters returningfrom the forest. Male animals possess dori, and thus are prohibited as food for parentsof an infant who is nursing; the dori of male animal meat interferes with the taming or\"completing\" effects of mother's milk.Sorcery IllnessDori is also the generic term for sorcery-induced illness, the illness caused when asorcerer hurls or injects a portion of his dori in the body of a victim. As an illness, doriis treated in the context of a curing ritual called tokorime. The tokorime ritual is heldonly in the dry season, and normally at night, although especially difficult cases of doriillness may lead to the ritual being extended into the daytime. In the tokorime curingritual, shamans become transformed into the adzaba spirits, and invoke the spirit formsof animals to assist in curing. Shamans, typically two or more in alternation, enter thevillage from the nearby forest and sing with the women of the village, who form a largesemicircular ring around the sick patient. The shamans snort tobacco snuff and enterinto a trance, in which they become transformed into the adzaba spirits who suck out thedori on the afflicted area of the patient. In curable cases of dori, the process is repeatedfor several hours, and the patient is pronounced healed.Dori illness is understood to be the result of a sorcery attack, and when the patient iscured in the tokorime ritual, the sorcerer is typically identified as a senior shaman inanother village. Doho, the headman of the village called Santo Amaro, several daysdownriver from Maronaua and Sobral, was commonly identified as the sorcerer-causeof episodes of dori in the upriver villages. In these cases, accusations of sorcery againstshamans such as Doho in other villages certainly direct public sentiment outward,preserving the ideological harmony of kin living together within the village. The act ofaffirming the conviction that village consociates would never harm each other throughsorcery is arguably more important than identifying or punishing the sorcerer. Forexample, on the several occasions during my research when Doho visited Maronaua, hewas happily greeted as a favorite cousin and in-law, and when I pointed out that he had"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"caused numerous cases of dori in the village, people responded with a kind ofdismissive reply that Doho would never seriously harm anyone; indeed, in thediplomatic context of intervillage ritual it seemed bad form even to mention theseearlier accusations.When a patient dies of dori, the entire nature of the incident changes; the Kulinaassume that the sorcerer is present in the village, and it becomes critical to identify andkill the sorcerer. Not surprisingly, men identified as sorcerer-killers are sociallymarginal or lacking in political resources and support within the village. In the mostdramatic case that I witnessed, a prominent elderly man died after two frantic days ofnonstop curing rituals. The sorcerer implicated in his death was a visitor from a villageon the Envira River-an old friend who had the misfortune to arrive in Maronaua just ashis friend and host, a double irony, took ill with a respiratory infection. In the end, theaccused sorcerer was clubbed to death and his body was thrown in a stream.The denial of a proper burial is prescribed for sorcerers killed in revenge for theirfatal dori attacks. With a normal burial, the spirit, kurime, of the deceased travels downto the underworld village of peccary spirits, where the human spirit is eaten andtransformed into a white-lipped peccary, the hidzama. Shamans call these peccaries upinto the forest where they can be hunted and eaten. The process is a cyclical one inwhich spirit substance is continuously reincarnated as human then peccary, each a kindof food for the other (Pollock 1993a). Sorcerers, however, are denied this reincarnation;for several days their spirits wander the village where they were killed, but ultimatelythey are eaten by a jaguar and are not reincarnated as either peccary or a human.Jaguars, incidentally, gain a measure of their malign nature from eating the spirits ofsorcerers.Sorcery accusations, or the threat of such accusations, have long been regarded as aform of social control, a view that is perhaps not so much wrong as incomplete (see, e.g.Douglas 197o; Geschiere 1997: 215-23). Among the Kulina the possibility of beingaccused of sorcery is without doubt a concern for men whose behavior places them atvarious social and cultural margins, though it did not, in my experience, coerce theminto conforming to more acceptable social norms. At Maronana, and later at Sobral, forexample, a man I call Bodo was often spoken of as a possible sorcerer, and with eachcase of dori in the village his name was mentioned until it became clear that the patientwould recover, whereupon suspicion was redirected to a man in another village. Bodoclearly feared the consequences of a patient's death, however, and he periodically leftthe village to travel to his mother's village of Santo Amaro when complaints about his"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"behavior became too loud or frequent. Bodo was regarded as lazy; he rarely hunted andtoo often chose the easy option of fishing. He lived with his father-in-law despitehaving three children, a point at which he should have built his own house. And thus itwas not simply his wife who complained of too much fish and not enough meat; hisfather-in-law should have been able to rely on Bodo to hunt for the household, butcouldn't. When things got too uncomfortable for Bodo he retreated to Santo Amaro, andI have heard that his returns to Maronaua and later to Sobral were also flights frompossible sorcery accusations at Santo Amaro.The cultural logic and techniques of shamanic sorcery are straightforward, but thesocial conditions of sorcery are complex. Indeed, I have suggested that, the Kulina usesorcery as a displaced discourse on other social issues; a brief discussion of sorcery-caused illness will make this clear.Dori, in the form of an illness caused by a shaman-sorcerer, is said to resemble astone in the body that grows unless it is extracted. The symptoms of dori illness arevague and may include almost any discomfort, pain, or unease that an individualreports. However, not all pains or discomforts are diagnosed as dori; rather, a diagnosisof dori is highly contextual. Virtually all nonfatal cases of dori are diagnosed onlyfollowing interhousehold conflicts. That is, aches, pains, and other discomforts aregenerally ignored or appropriated to a nonmystical illness category, but outbreaks ofviolence between households are invariably followed by diagnoses of dori and tokorimecuring rituals (Pollock 1996). Diagnosis of dori and shamanic curing do not evenrequire sickness to precipitate the process. In the case of the elderly man mentionedearlier, his death and the revenge killing of his sorcerer-murderer were followed byserial shamanic treatment of virtually every resident of the village. Moreover, ingeneral after the successful cure of dori illness, a second ritual is held in which allvillage members dance for hours at night in a large circle in the center of the village,singing songs that have themes of order and beauty in the world. I refer to dori illnessand its treatment as a displaced discourse because the Kulina believe that dori is causedby harmful sorcery attack and do not explicitly connect the illness and the precipitatingepisodes or context of interhousehold violence, yet my data show that this relationshipbetween interhousehold violence and dori illness is constant and predictable.It is clear, then, that dori illness, ideologically the result of sorcery attacks, is atanother level a response to disrupted interhousehold relations: that is, public failures ofconviviality, according to Overing and Passes (2000). It takes the form of projectingblame outward to shaman-sorcerers in other villages, and affirms the social value of"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"harmony and cooperation-again, conviviality is an appropriate term-that underliesrelations among village members. Even in the case of fatal sorcery attacks, the sorcereris identified among those who have no kin ties to village members, or whose claims tokinship have been compromised by their chronically antisocial behavior. In each casesorcery is declared to be something that the close kin comprising the village-acommunity of siblings, actual and metaphorical-would never commit against oneanother.Sorcery is thus articulated with siblingship as something of its opposite. Siblingship isone metaphor for village membership: \"we are all siblings,\" as people say to underscorethe relations of cooperation and support, peacefulness and mutuality, that characterizesibling relations. Sorcery is the metaphorical opposite: antisocial, dangerous, secret,and potentially fatal. Sorcery accusations directed out of the community implicitlyassert the expectations of conviviality of community membership: \"our siblings\" wouldnever harm us; harmful sorcerers are found in other villages.Those dangerous sorcerers are, ideologically, affines. Despite a preference for villageendogamy and cross-cousin marriage, Maronaua and Sobral, the sites of the kurubumadiha group of Kulina,5 regard the members of the Santo Amaro village, the pitsimadiha, as potential and in many cases actual affines, and each forms the primary locusof attack sorcery against the other. For example, Bodo, mentioned after, was a pitsimadiha who married into the community at Maronaua (young men in Maronauaoccasionally travel to Santo Amaro looking for eligible young women for marriage).Sorcery's articulation with siblingship thus reveals a complex dimension to this issue,one that I describe as the paradox of siblingship for Kulina. Specifically and briefly,villages composed ideologically of siblings are also ideologically endogamous: some ofthese siblings must be converted into potential affines for marriage. The paradox lies inthe fact that many village members are simultaneously siblings and affines, and therelations expected of affines, from sexual access to sorcery attacks, are prohibitedamong siblings (Pollock 2001). The Kulina are not unique in this regard; some of thesocial consequences of this kind of paradox were explored a number of years ago byEllen Basso among the Kalapalo (1970, 1975) and by Joanna Overing among the Piaroa(Overing-Kaplan 1972,1973). I will not explore here the broad range of the interestingconsequences of this paradox or dilemma for the Kulina (see Pollock 1985, 2001), but Iwill pursue briefly the implications of the paradox for violence and sorcery.Interhousehold violence is not common in Kulina villages, but violent acts can be"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"very aggressive and village members become extremely distressed when, for example, awoman attacks her husband's lover with a machete or a burning log, or men threateneach other with shotguns or knives. Violent disputes between individuals are oftenresolved, however, and harmony is typically restored after a tokorime curing ritual andits subsequent ritual of social reconciliation. A more serious and complex case is wortha brief examination to illustrate the more subtle forms that violence can take. When Ifirst arrived in Maronaua in the dry season of 19811 found that tokorime rituals werebeing conducted every night in the village. Over the next several weeks I learned thatthe village had become divided the week before my arrival over a dispute between thesenior headman, Rimana, and his younger brother, Waki.The details of the dispute are complicated and more ideologically than physicallyviolent. Rimana led a faction that looked to the Brazilian National Indian Foundation(FUNAI) for future support of the village. Rimana had received vague promises of anairstrip, health care, and even electrical generators. And, just as important, FUNAIwould support Rimana's political position. His brother Waki, however, had alliedhimself to the Catholic missionary organization, the Conselho Indigenista Missionario(ciMi). A Brazilian family had been placed in the village by court, and this family,although technically missionaries, had adopted the cIMi position of looking afterindigenous rights rather than pursuing any overtly evangelical goals. A large quantity ofmedications had already been supplied to the village by crM1, which had also built aschoolhouse where the missionaries hoped to start literacy training. Waki, the youngerbrother and a weaker political figure, was supported by the ciMi missionaries, whofound him a more pliable ally than Rimana.The resources designated by FUNAI to the region were overtaxed, and it is unlikelythat the organization could ever have provided the material benefits that Rimana sought.Rather, I believe that FUNAI'S implicit goal was to encourage Rimana to expell theciMi missionaries, who were regarded as troublesome and illegal intruders in thisindigenous area. Some time not long before my arrival, the missionary family returnedto Maronaua from a trip to Brasilia, and their return precipitated a series of angrydisputes between Rimana and Waki over their presence. Rimana insisted that themissionaries leave the village, while Waki, recognizing that the missionaries were anextremely valuable source of support for his own political aspirations, refused to allowthem to be expelled. Rimana then announced that he would take his own supporters tothe abandoned rubber-tapping camp down-river, the Seringal Sobral. Unfortunately forRimana's plans, many of his political supporters and allies were reluctant to move;"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Maronaua had good hunting, established gardens, and substantial houses. To many, evento rebuild houses, which the Kulina adapted in a variation of the local Brazilian caboclostyle, was more effort than the dispute seemed to justify. After all, people told me,FUNAI was merely a promise but the ciMi missionaries were already in the village,acting daily to help people. This Rimana took only a small group of about thirty peopleto Sobral, about one week before I arrived.As this brief and somewhat simplified account suggests, my arrival in Maronaua moreor less coincided with a particularly serious political conflict, one that was, moreover,between two brothers. While not physically violent, the dispute disrupted or threatenedthe conviviality of village relations and the obligatory harmony of siblings -in this casea pair of especially powerful siblings-and the social tensions that it provoked wereimmediately translated into a virtual epidemic of dori illness. Indeed, by the time Iarrived in the village I found tokorime curing rituals being performed all night, everynight, for numerous patients. Significantly, the sorcery attacks' ideological projection ofblame outward onto sorcerers in the Santo Amaro village was so marked that evenRimana returned to Maronaua to assist in the tokorime curing rituals (a participationthat doubtless was also a form of self-immunizing from accusations of sorcery). Isuspect that, over their history, Kulina villages have periodically divided along similarsocial lines and in comparable disputes, and the resulting communities ultimately cometo regard each other as distinct madiha groups that are also the loci of sorcery attacks.Affines and EnemiesDori is not the only form of illness that can be caused by the intentional use ofmystical forces; the Kulina describe another illness, one caused by the (mis)use of thehallucinogenic drug ayahuasca. While at one level dori sorcery might be understood asa discourse of siblingship and conviviality, the complex of beliefs surroundingayahuasca illness draws on concerns about affinity and the social tensions of sexuality.Together, both reveal facets of the paradox of kinship and affinity in a Kulina village.While Kulina do not use ayahuasca in shamanic practice, they do take it regularlyduring the dry season in nighttime rituals. Ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis caapi) allows itsusers to communicate with spirits in the sky. Its use is not associated with curing butrather is connected with visions of the future and of the mythic past. Notably, bothKulina men and women take ayahuasca; the Kulina regard it as an introduced drug theyacquired from the local Panoan-speaking peoples, and they call it by the same Panoanterm, rami, that is used by the Kaxinaua and the Sharanaua along the upper Purus."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"The focus of my original research among the Kulina of Maronaua was traditionalethnomedicine (Pollock 1994a, 1996), and in abstract discussions of illness Kulinaoccasionally mentioned a rather mysterious condition called ramikka dzamakuma,\"ayahuasca fever\" or \"ayahuasca sickness.\" Ramikka dzamakuma is caused when a manwishing to seduce a woman prepares an infusion of ayahuasca by boiling the vine, andthen smears her hammock and clothes with the liquid. The drug acts initially as anaphrodisiac, and produces the desired amorous effects. However, within a few days thewoman falls ill and may die unless she is treated by a special variety of shaman called awiwimade (literally \"storyteller\"), who is skilled in the specialized use of ayahuasca.The serious threat posed by this illness lies in the fact that only the local Panoan Indiansare wiwimade shamans, and they are usually happy to let Kulina suffering from illnessdie.Ramikka dzamakuma is somewhat mysterious inasmuch as it appears to be largelymythical or hypothetical; no one suffered from this illness during my research and noone could point to a case that was unambiguously ramikka dzamakuma. I interpreted theillness as having a kind of virtual or potential character, a logical entailment of Kulinanotions of illness and personhood but rarely if ever a reality in practice. Like beliefsabout aphrodisiacs in other cultures, ramikka dzamakuma is also a fantasy aboutsexuality and sexual access, and from this perspective it offers some insights intoKulina notions of affinity and sexuality as opposed to siblingship and conviviality.The description of the preparation and use of ayahuasca as an aphrodisiac issuggestive; it mirrors a complex of beliefs and practices surrounding illness and itstreatment, and it is in this sense that \"ayahuasca fever\" is immanent in Kulina notions ofillness and personhood. The ayahuasca prepared for \"normal\" consumption in vision-inducing rituals is mixed with a variety of other plants to produce the desiredhallucinogenic effects, and the mix is taken by drinking. However, to produce theaphrodisiac the vine is boiled alone and is applied to the hammock and clothes where itwill be absorbed into the skin. When powerful substances, especially powerful-smellingsubstances, penetrate the skin they produce transformations in the person, and ramikkadzamakuma works a fundamental transformation on the person who takes it in thisinappropriate way. While milder-smelling substances can be used to enhance one'sattractiveness, strong-smelling substances produce more profound effects: tobaccosnuff transforms shamans into spirits; good-smelling substances are rubbed on a corpseto help transform the dead into a peccary spirit. Ayahuasca used as an aphrodisiac drugtransforms the victim, but at the price of poisoning her."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"The paradox of ramikka dzamakuma- that the potion that is used to attract and seducea lover will ultimately kill her-condenses and expresses the more general Kulina viewof affines and potential affines. These are relationships surrounded by behavioral taboosand prescriptions, expectations and rules. While the metaphor of siblingship extends toall community members a free and easy conviviality and the linked identities of sharedsubstance, sexuality and marriage demarcate that a community of \"siblings\" be dividedinto two groups: kin and affines-that is, those with whom sex is forbidden and thosewho are potential or actual sexual and marriage partners. It is the affinal side of thesocial universe to which an attitude of shame is extended, to which obligations ofhunting and gardening are owed, and to which sexual access is available. At a marriageritual, affines lash one another with thick whips made of tapir hide attached to a handle.To court or seduce a sexual partner is a metaphorical act of aggression, and just assorcery attacks are typically attributed to members of affinally related communities, sotoo is the mystical illness of ramikka dzamakuma caused by the aggressive act ofseduction between potential affines.Siblings and SorcerersI have relied here on the highly apposite concept of \"conviviality\" proposed byOvering and Passes and their colleagues to capture the sense of cooperation and easy, ifobligatory, hospitality that surrounds life in the Kulina villages where I have worked,inasmuch as it appears to describe life in so many indigenous Amazonian communities(Overing and Passes 2000:14). Conviviality is not merely a cultural prescription (asOvering and Passes note it may even be incompatible with prescriptions and formalrules for social life), it is also a shared psychological style of experiencing one's \"self,\"and although my interest in this essay has been focused on developing a culturalaccount of Kulina sorcery, it is tempting to introduce a psychological perspective aswell. As Stephen has commented in her study of Mekeo magic, humans in social lifeseem to display a desire for a well-defined, bounded self (1995:320), even when incultural terms local conceptions of personhood present the \"unbounded\" person sofamiliar in lowland South American research. In a Kulina community, where thepermeability of personhood is stressed and a fluid, open self is valued, desire for abounded self must be repressed. Moreover, the \"openness\" of personhood, the culturalassumption of overlapping identities and shared substance among community members,leaves the self vulnerable to attack or penetration by sorcerers; the very openness that isboth the prerequisite and consequence of conviviality is also the vulnerable point atwhich sorcery penetrates. It is not surprising, perhaps, that the Kulina image of"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"sorcery's malign weapon is an intrusive, penetrating mystical substance that draws onthe same logic of shared substance that unites members of a community.If Stephen is correct, and if such a psychological style also entails that the desire for abounded sense of self be repressed in order to achieve the openness of social life, wemay understand how assaults on that self trigger such violent responses. Among theKulina, fatal sorcery attacks require the killing of the sorcerer by dramatically violentmeans, by bludgeoning, in the cases I have witnessed, and reportedly in other cases byarrows, shotgun blasts, and axe blows. Affinity and sexual access, which demarcate theself through behavioral prescriptions and social obligations, are threats to thepermeability of the self that is always at risk in siblingship; ramikka dzamakuma, thedual face of seduction and murder, captures the violence of this threat to the experienceof one's self in a Kulina community.In a Kulina village one's metaphorical siblings represent the universe of conviviality,and vice versa, but affinity and sexuality represent the major threat to the harmony ofsiblingship; the preference for village endogamy continually entails that some of these\"siblings\" be converted into affines or potential affines and the openness of the self thatone experiences in relations with one's siblings is continually threatened by theintrusion of relations based on more-explicit rules of conduct, structure, and calculationof reciprocity. Attack sorcery by shamans, and the metaphorical violence of the seducer,represent, in effect, too little regard for the conviviality of siblingship on the one hand,and too much desire for the sexual access of affinity on the other. They frame theessential tension of Kulina social life, the paradox of siblingship and affinity and ofsorcerers and seducers.Notes1 I use an orthography for the Kulina language that is based on the InternationalPhonetic Alphabet, but I should acknowledge that to do so is partly a political act. TheSummer Institute of Linguistics (sIL), a fundamentalist Protestant missionaryorganization, developed an orthography for the Kulina language that it has used in itsethnographic publications, educational materials, and Bible translations in Peru (e.g.,Adams 1962, 1963). The SIL orthography is based on the Spanish values of letters(e.g., where I write madiha the SIL writes madija), and thus I find it less useful thanmy own, especially when roughly go percent of Kulina live in Brazil. Unfortunately,literate madiha in both Peru and Brazil are also writing madija. So it goes."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"2 I suspect from the Deni ethnography that they are in fact a Kulina group that hasbecome regarded as separate and to some degree distinct. Their language appears tobe at least a closely related dialect of Kulina. Even their name, deni, is the Kulinapluralizing suffix used with the name of each Kulina local group; the Kulina atMaronaua are the Kurubu madihadeni, for example: the kurubu fish people.3 In the upper Purus dialect of the Kulina language the /o/ often becomes /u/ and theterminal /i/ becomes /e/. In the SIL orthography the term dzumahe is dsomaji.4 Claire Lorraine (2000) has noted that among the Kulina of Amazonas the term koidzarefers to a ritual in which large quantities of the drink are consumed. Among the Kulina of the upper Purus, the term koidza refers to the drink itself, and the Brazilianterm mariri has been adopted for the ritual.

From ordinary handicrafts to specializedshamanic practices, every skilled activity of the Arara is to be controlled by a firmprecept of vigorously avoiding the suspicion of greed or stinginess. This is most evidentin regard to shamanic knowledge and exercise.Most conditions of Arara social life, as symbolically conceived by them, are sodependent on certain shamanic activities that the practice of shamanism becomesthreatening for the community and risky for practitioners. Using shamanic skills forpromoting collective well-being is one of the stronger moral imperatives attached toindividual skills. It seeks to avoid the use of shamanism to practice sorcery, whichamounts to a selfish appropriation of shamanic powers. As an inappropriate use ofshamanic skills, Arara sorcery is a violation of the very foundations of sociality.Banishment, which means isolation, is the destiny of those who are suspected of sorceryand therefore accused of egoism and selfishness. This is what happened to Tchibie andher first husband. Their history is amazingly simple, and their adaptive responseastonishingly awkward. Their destiny was a byproduct of Arara sanctions against thosewho are suspected of sorcery, found guilty and finally condemned to leave theircommunities. Furthermore, because they were living in an area subject to massive andviolent nonindigenous invasions since the 1970s, they also had to hide from contactwith intruders 5Political autonomy and economic independence are at the foundation of Araratraditional social organization (Teixeira-Pinto 1993b, 1995a). The existence of smallsubgroups, of about thirty to forty people living dispersed over a wide area, has alwaysbeen the pattern of Arara social life, and is still in practice today. The largest Ararasettlement, the Laranjal village, includes many different and autonomous subgroups,each having their own gardens, hunting paths, and even a particular schedule to bathe inthe river or visit the FUNAI facilities in search of health care or industrial tools andgoods. Yet, a tight network of interaction and collaboration among the differentsubgroups underlies the independence of each subgroup. The difference between formalindependence and real isolation, which led Tchibie and her family to continuousincestuous matches, points to the opposition between living according to an established\"social contract\" that sustains Arara society as an enduring and consensual moral"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"community, and living in complete abandonment of it.Sorcery and the Moral Bounds of ShamanismI argue here that through the analysis of the conditions of sorcery we can perceivesignificant aspects of Arara sociality, which paradoxically are revealed in its disruption.The accusations and consequences of sorcery can reveal the limits of what we may callan Arara \"social contract\" based on the nature of the moral conceptions that inform andcreate most of their practices, whether collective or individual. A contrast betweenbeing alone, selfish, and violent and being generous, reciprocal, mutual, and integratedwithin a network of cooperation and interdependence is presented as the two majorlimits of the native moral spectrum of possible human ways of acting. In this essay Iwill review the argument that the potential use of shamanic powers to produce damageto others is at the core of Arara definitions of sorcery, even though this is already acliche, a commonplace, and even a trite statement about sorcery. But the Arara includea further aspect to this issue that I find absorbing: because all Arara adult men must beinitiated into and are at least partial practitioners of shamanic tasks, all of thempotentially and permanently can be suspected of being sorcerers. Possessing someshamanic abilities is part of what is expected of a male person. Moreover, most of Ararasocial life is thought of as being produced and reproduced by shamanism. Thus sorceryappears as a typical instance of a common yet essential skill that can turn into adangerous practice that threatens the very possibility of collective life. Thischaracteristic of sorcery reveals the fragility of the foundations of Arara social life, andin this sense sorcery is not only a moral deviance of correct shamanic actions but also,and mainly, a defiance of society as a whole and a conceptual challenge for the Araraunderstanding of the moral aspects of sociality.Part of what is considered as something only a shaman can accomplish in the world isthe production of ideal metaphysical conditions that make social activities logically andsymbolically possible s Another part is the control over several regular cooperativetasks such as gardening, and the organization of rituals (not to mention daily healingand physical care) that are accomplished through shamanic intercession. As importantas shamanism is for general aspects of social life, it is also a permanent source ofdanger and threat. This fragility of life's status is an essential aspect of the Arara way ofunderstanding human relationships, and it is at the foundation of the moral gist ofsociality.The moral constraints and closeness of formal ties of friendship and cooperation"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"between individuals are what control the potential use of shamanic powers formalevolent purposes. Evoking many other Arara institutions, shamanism also has thestatus of being something that has to be used as a \"gift\" (that is, something that existsunder the exclusive condition that it will be given to someone else [see Lefort 1967]). Inno morally acceptable way can a shaman act on his own behalf. Hence, along with itsharmful utilization, shamanism for any self-benefit stands as one of the main causes ofsorcery accusations. Yet the threads that connect the use of shamanic arts and craftswith attitudes toward others are extremely fragile and constantly subject to rupture.Denying the decisive quality of Arara shamanic powers (that it has to be used only insomeone else's favor) means ignoring the main properties and values needed to sustaincollective life. In this sense, sorcery is an instance of an anticollective action, a supremesign of egoism, and an exaltation of the individual over the collective, and should berecognized as such through the banishment of contumacious suspects. At the heart ofArara social life there is this manifest contradiction: the same conditions that makeconviviality possible are precisely what can also put it at risk. Sorcery is the practicethat reveals this contradiction most clearly.My arguments have obvious inspiration in other authors, ethnographies, and analyses.However, in the interest of simplicity and brevity I will not offer comparisons ordetailed citations.' A much lengthier work on Arara and Amerindian moralities is along-term project that I have just begun to undertake.The Form and Meaning of Autonomy and Dispersion,Difference and ConstraintThe Arara were the last Carib-speaking people to accept permanent contact withBrazilian national society. There were, however, many indigenous groups historicallycalled Arara in the Xingu and Iriri river basins who had similar histories of beingaffected by indigenous and nonindigenous groups induced by the occupation ofAmazonia throughout the century. More recently, the construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway, along with the growth of the many towns that developed fromcolonization projects along the new road, have been the source of the main impact onthe traditional indigenous population.'Historical information about the Arara points to a pattern of territorial dispersionbetween the Tapaj6s and Tocantins rivers (see Nimuendaju 1932; Tocantins 1877; Vonden Steinen 1894). Linguistically, the Arara belong to the same dialectic family as the"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Apiaca of the Tocantins (extinct), the Yaruma (extinct), and the Txicao-Ikpeng (livingin the Xingu Indigenous Park). All of these are peoples whose spatial dispersion in thearea between the Tocantins and Tapaj6s rivers covered the valley of the middle Xinguand Iriri rivers where the Arara were recently found (see Menget 1977: ch. 2). TheArara occupy a marginal geographical position when compared with the largerdemographic concentrations of the Carib-speaking peoples of the Guyanas and thetributaries of the upper Xingu River (cf. Basso 1977). For a long time they shared thesame area with several Tupianspeaking peoples (Shipaya, Curuaya, Mundurucu,Juruna), and the G8speaking Kayap6. Such extreme historical influences are importantfor understanding Arara singularities among other Carib-speaking peoples.Much of the reality of the Arara way of life is a subtle adaptation of traditionalpatterns. Instead of the traditional dispersed local groups, now many differentresidential units emerge as the smallest sociopolitical units. Nevertheless, local groupshave retained their main status of independence and autonomy, all despite living mostlywithin a single village. Their main settlement, around the Laranjal Indigenous Post, isin fact a conglomerate of distinct social units, each with a slightly different history ofrelationships with each other. If it weren't for its peculiar history of isolation and incest,the Cachoeira Seca-Iriri subgroup could simply be seen as another typical Arara socialunit. However, the independence and autonomy of each subgroup go along with thenetwork of multiple connections between them. Due to its peculiar history, theCachoeira Seca-Iriri group has no connections of any kind with the others, a sign of itsimposed seclusion.A residential unit is built on a combination of two distinct norms: uxorilocality and acertain degree of personal autonomy. Uxorilocality is required for a first marriage, butprestige, personal affinities, solidarity, and cooperative agreements can influence anyresidential arrangement (Teixeira-Pinto 1995a). If affinal ties are important aspects forsetting up a residential group, another condition is that a household should behave as areal cooperative unit: coresident adult men should always be helpful and reciprocal witheach other in the tasks the group must collectively perform (hunting during the dryseason, preparing the communal garden during the rainy season, etc.). Each householdis centered on an elderly headman, and ideally, living with him are his unmarried sonsand daughters, and eventually his sonsin-law. Yet since the Arara tend to bepolygynous, uxorilocality becomes a very relative and unstable principle.There are many matrimonial strategies to prevent the difficulties created byuxorilocality vis-a-vis a man's multiple marriages. In bypassing the paradox of"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"uxorilocality in the context of polygyny, affinal ties replicate: a man marries two sistersor a woman and her sister's daughter. A marriage with a very young girl can likewise bearranged, thus avoiding uxorilocality. At the most, the best matrimonial strategies arethose that can add wives without appending in-laws.Unlike the postmarital unit to which a man belongs, the natal group receives the signsof consanguinity and its related circumstances. Those who are born within the sameresidential group are defined as mutually iebY, people who partake of the same physical\"substances\" (Teixeira-Pinto 1993b). This community of substance realizes practices ofgifting, sharing, and cooperating in an extremely generalized fashion. But when a mangets married, he leaves behind him his natal family and consanguineal kin, and beginsto live with his father-in-law and his affinal kin in the new household. While there, aman becomes a member of a hunting team, which is much more than an economicactivity: belonging to a household implies the establishment of a large set of formal tiesof solidarity, cooperation, and moral commitments between those associated throughshared residence. By and large, the shift from the natal group and consanguineal domainto the new affinal household arena corresponds to the passage from an informal groundof conviviality to a strict field of formal interactions.The relationships of a man with his natal group, however, never cease. Occasionalmeetings and planned rituals, usually held during the dry season, reconnect a man withhis natal relatives. These gatherings invariably begin with a large collective hunt thatone household offers to another. The hunters are to act as guests visiting another localgroup's settlement. Nowadays where living arrangements are basically within a singlevillage, hosts and guests share the same arena, but observe traditional roles: a householdteam leaves the village for a prolonged stay in the forest where they must kill as muchgame as they can, while the other household remains in the village preparing largeamounts of piktu,9 which must be offered in exchange for the meat. All of this activityforms an exchange cycle of meat for drink, which will be sustained until the end of thedry season: a residential group initially hunts to offer the game to another which willreciprocate with the piktu. Afterward they both change roles.The demographic and the postmarital residential patterns, along with the exchangecycle between households, imply a very clear dynamic whose formal structure,sociological mechanisms, and associated moral aspects can be seen by observing bothhouseholds, natal and postmarital, to determine the nature of the connections that areestablished between the individuals. The mutual individual associations with natal kinand with the new coresidents are a very significant characteristic of Arara social life."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The complex logical, symbolic, and psychological connections between individuals area significant feature for defining the nature of personal bonds that entail socialinvolvement and the moral commitments among them.A household, while not being a named entity with a clear jural status, does act as acorporate group, although it does not constitute in itself a \"house\" in the analyticalsense (see Levi-Strauss 1981, 1986; Carsten and Hugh-Jones 1995). Households do havepolitical independence and economic autonomy enough to secure their freedom inrelation to the strategies for interacting with other households. The matrimonialalliances that anchor their existence are always defined by the headman's wider politicalmotives. It is important to agglutinate a group of individuals because a large andefficient hunting team provides prestige to the headman in the network of interactionthat involves the several households.Further, the dry-season hunting routine also has its structuring function within thehousehold team. All men of the same household must hunt together during the entireseason. They arrange themselves into a team with an internal organization that decideson the length of stay in the forest as well as the preferential places to build thetemporary hunting camps. Although they do not act as a single unit in carrying out theirhunting objectives but rather divide themselves into many formal partnerships, Araramen are always expected to act in pairs.There are two different types of formal partnerships. The first, which occurs on aregular basis, is called ibirinda and is associated with the collective hunt throughout thedry season: wandering around with a fellow in the forest suffices to establish a formallink of ibirinda between two men?° The second, called uoktangat, occurs duringconflicts and hostilities against traditional enemies: a joint act of killing an enemyproduces a sort of deep identification between the partners11 Between the two formalpartnerships the only sociological difference is that an ibirinda association always isinitiated between people who live within the same household, while the war partnership,uoktangat, connects people from two distinct groups. Both partnerships are permanentand last even in a situation where the initial condition for their existence has alreadycome to an end. Each time a collective expedition is realized, former pairs of ibirindacan join or new ones can be formed. Because the collective hunt is the primary maleactivity during the dry season, the ibirinda partnerships are constantly created, renewed,or remade. Likewise, even though there were neither traditional combats nor enemies tobe killed in the customary way, there were still five pairs of uoktangat living in thevillage of Laranjal in 1994."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Within a household the nature of the ties that unite men are not homogeneous: thereare parents and sons, uncles and nephews, grandfathers and grandchildren, siblings,brothers-in-law, sons-in-law, and fathers-inlaw. Yet the formation of huntingpartnerships must obey certain exclusive criteria: the unit of parent and son, or twosiblings, or grandfather and grandchild cannot act together. The basic relations thatsettle partnerships are real affinal ties (a son-in-law with his father-in-law, twobrothers-in-law together, etc.). Besides the affines, an unmarried maternal uncle and hisnephew (keeping in mind that the Arara are basically uxorilocal) are also recognized asvirtual and privileged partners for hunting. The reason that prior relations amonghunters excludes them from formal partnerships is that the compulsory solidarity thatcomes from consanguinity would make the ethical imperative completely useless. Thatis, it is because they are built on relations of real affinity (and on the mother's brother-sister's son links) that the ibirinda or uoktangat partnerships, emerging from hunting orraiding, are distinguished from pure kinship and consanguinity.Between these \"partners\" extremely formalized ways of cooperation and solidaritytake place. Actually, the extreme formality of typical Arara ways of behaving draws theattention of anyone who visits them for long or even for very short periods of time. Infact, in both the most ordinary activities (gardening, hunting, harvesting) to ceremonialpractices (drinking manioc beer, playing flutes, dancing) and the more extraordinaryand highly ritualized procedures associated with their famous \"bellicose passion\" (raids,killing, dissection of an enemy's corpse; see Teixeira-Pinto 1997) the Arara constantlyoperate in pairs. Indeed, \"to act in pairs\" appears to be a pervasive metaphor for ageneral Arara ideal for social ties. To act in pairs means that each person establishesconnections with another to accomplish what they are supposed to do. However, to actin pairs doesn't imply any sort of immutable connection between two specificindividuals that once established would prevent them from being connected to anotherpartner. Rather, it only means a model of relation that can connect n persons in sets oftwo.Because the Arara are much more inductive and seductive than coercive, a call forcooperation (mate ibirindamitpYt uro) is a spark for Arara sociality. Nevertheless, evenwhen not formalized through that explicit request, the simple act of asking someone todo something is a very effective way to be connected with somebody else and tobecome involved in a situation in which they must meet expectations to render aid.There are two main sets of cooperative activities, one that is structured by very formaland predictable rules, and another that is built around more informal and unpredictable"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"practices. The first is connected with dry-season collective hunting and the warexpeditions and killing of enemies in the past, while the second is associated with year-round ordinary hunting and the daily consumption of manioc beer.Even though it is quite possible to go alone for occasional hunting, Arara huntersprefer to invite someone else to accompany them. There are different expertises inhunting techniques and variations in skill, in addition to the fact that two hunters cankill and carry more game than can one. But none of these facts alone are responsible fortheir preference for going hunting with a partner. There is no good in being alonebecause it can trigger a general feeling of sadness, gloominess, and melancholy. In theArara glossary for personal affective states, there are at least three emotional qualitiesassociated with loneliness: tYmorangne, tYpongne, and ipo pra, the trans lation ofwhich obviously presents many problems. Their contextual roots can help us tounderstand the differences. Tipongne is connected to the sensation of feeling \"unhappy,\"while ipo pra is a sort of nostalgia or yearning for, or missing, someone. Timorangne isa more generic and diffuse feeling of \"distress\" without a definite causation but alwaysassociated with the wider condition of being in the world. The all-embracing categorythe Arara use to describe this terrestrial existence is otamnoptana, the noun derivedfrom the verb otamnoptobot that denotes the \"loss\" of anything 1z Relativelywidespread throughout Amazonia, the idea of an initial catastrophe giving form to theactual world has not just a descriptive value for the Arara but also serves as the mainfoundation for their morality. For them, geomorphology immediately brings to mind thecosmological history of privation and the subjective conditions of living in theterrestrial domain. For this reason, the connections between individuals are not only anecessary adaptation but a temporary solution for an isolated individual's hardships.In this sense the symbolic and psychological links between two formal partners aremuch more important than any sociology could anticipate. By being ibirinda oruoktangat two formal partners always have many reciprocal obligations. Besidescollaboration in practical activities, to assist each other in any sort of disablement,especially when one is returning from the forest, is among their main duties. Because ofthis, being partially skilled in the shamanic arts for curing a partner comprises part ofthe attributes expected of any adult man.Even in relation to practical activities, two formal partners are connected in a deeperway. Among the ibirinda for instance, the one who kills game must give it to the otherpartner to carry the whole time. When arriving at their destination, the one who killedthe animal chooses the way that the meat should be prepared by the partner who carried"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"it from the forest, or even by a former ibirinda. During a hunt it is extremely rare thatjust one partner has success in killing. So together they do in a joint way something thateach one of them could be doing independently: killing, carrying, preparing, etc. Agreater ethical imperative seems to transform the apparently simple possibility thatsomething fully achievable individually may in fact be accomplished in an independentway: an imperative of complementarity and an ethic of solidarity and cooperationsolidly joins those who are involved in a common task.In brief, the general picture of what goes on among the ibirinda is as follows: a slainanimal is carried by the partner of the one who killed it; if both are successful, each onewill carry the game of the other. As they arrive in the village, they lay the game on theground and address the partner, saying \"that's your game.\" If both carry game, both willdo the same, formally returning the game to whom it belongs. But they don't even touchthe game they kill; instead they almost immediately choose someone else (a formeribirinda partner) and ask him to cut up the flesh. After the game is cut into pieces, thehunter (or hunters) asks someone else (the third actor on the stage besides the hunterhimself, yet always a former partner) to cook the game. When cooked, the hunter finallyasks his father-in-law or the oldest man present to help him, after which the hunter andall the others feel free to do the same. What is going on here? Game, even one animal,can generate a network of sharing and the circulation of food (or goods). Hunting(which presupposes a hunter!) is appropriated in a very collective way, creating, using,and reinforcing the social ties between the hunters. If there is individual achievement, itis incorporated into community life. Between a hunter and his game, deep links ofinterindividual connections are established.But this is not the only formal partnership, neither is it the only illustration thatformal ethics of solidarity, cooperation, and complementarity play a very importantrole. In the case of the distribution of manioc beer, piktu, almost the same thinghappens. Piktu is made mainly by women by masticating, and then later fermentation.In the daily drinking gatherings, every man shows up with large bowls full of drink.Each offers generous portions to another (an old man and formal partners are among thechosen) always holding the pot (a calabash) with his own hand. But after a little whilehe gives his whole bowl full of piktu to the same person who drank first, who will takecare of the distribution from then on. Because every man shows up with a bowl thecharacters may change, but the \"script\" and the overall model will remain: each one willdistribute the piktu that was produced and presented by another. Thus, the collectiveappropriation of manioc beer is another reaffirmation of the very nature of Arara social"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"connections among individuals. Everything must always be done in relation to others.Henceforth, despite being sociologically divided into many different social units andenjoying a reasonable degree of personal autonomy, the Arara end up being linked to anetwork of multiple connections that crosscut the multiple fields of sociality.The great gatherings and rituals enacted during the dry season also have the objectiveof affirming and sustaining on a more permanent and regular basis the relationsbetween autonomous and independent social groups and, concurrently, the formalengagements between nominally free individuals. It is in this context that trust andsuspicion mediate individual adhesion to the Arara \"social contract,\" and that the use ofshamanic powers and its infringement that characterizes sorcery appear embedded inthe moral dimension of Arara sociality.The Shaman as Giver: Producing Well-BeingAll Arara shamanic tasks are related to special ways of accessing occult powers. Aninfusion called omiatchembili, made from a vine I was not able to identify, has some(but not major) importance 13 Certainly it is central to initiation into the shamanic arts,but afterward it can be left aside as its primary condition. Prepared through a gradualand constant cooking of the vine leaves and stem, the infusion is to be taken after longsessions of vomiting provoked by the exaggerated ingestion of warm water. After lyingdown in their hammocks in a temporary camp far from the village, every man mustdrink the infusion for hours and hours (even days). Weakened from expelling allpreviously consumed food and intoxicated by the infusion, the men probably areinduced to have visions defined as the entrance into the supernatural world. This visualfamiliarity with metaphysical being is one of the meanings of initiation.As stated, the infusion and the trance it purportedly induces are not absoluteconditions for the shamanic practice. There is no public session of shamanism duringwhich the consumption of any substance occupies an important place. Most of theshamanic activities are secret labors done in the forest. It is after the shaman's returnfrom the forest and his relating of what he has done, seen, or discovered that the othersnote the shaman's deed. However, the social legitimacy of the shamans' words seems tocome from the fact that they are supposed to have acquired the technical competence toidentify and comprehend metaphysical beings, occult signs or omens, having alreadybeen initiated and having practiced the consumption of the infusion. Such metaphysicalbeings are said to act on this terrestrial level where most things are immediately visibleto skilled eyes,14 and in such a way they can be perceived even in unaltered states of"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"consciousness. Thus trance is, technically speaking, not a sine qua non for gainingaccess to metaphysical realities.At present, every man is not only entitled to be initiated but actually obliged to do so.For healing purposes all men must develop such technical abilities as only shamanismcan provide. A \"real person\" must have the necessary skills for acting as healer for hiskin and his formal partners (see below). Yet this generalized initiation (avoiding anygendered discussion) has many consequences for the social dimension of Ararashamanism. In general, an obvious consequence is the extreme proliferation of activeshamans and the corresponding dispersion of shamanic capacities and dilution ofcompetence to deal with metaphysical causalities and casualties.Further, there is the dissipation of the frontiers between the cosmological levels of thevisible and the invisible, the natural and the supernatural, the physical and themetaphysical. Because the existence of such limits is always a possible basis for theemergence of specialists in its crossing, the Arara assume a different cosmologicalconfiguration that seems to unravel even more the tenuous lines that would give theshaman's role any major specificity. It is in the traditional forms of healing and lookingafter the many problems that could affect the person that this dilution of shamanicpowers manifests itself much more clearly.Every adult man should know how to perform some healing procedures, in part to takecare of his own wife (or wives) and children but also, or mainly, to comply with thesocial obligations toward formal partners. In general, any severe health impairmentgoes along with afflictions that affect the person. Only wounds with open skin infectionor other clear, even if small, manifestations are defined as injuries that take placeentirely on the body in its physical sense. Shamanic healing procedures apply by andlarge to diseases in which the person's afflictions have an important role, whether ascause or as foreseen consequence.The Person: Afflictions, Control, and HealingDespite their conceptual independence, the person and the body are intrinsicallyconnected on the physical level 15 If not all body illness compromises the person, anydisablement of the person reflects on the body, and the body is also the means to gainaccess to the person's condition and its afflictions. It is through the concretemanipulation of body parts, components, and substances that a shaman can produce acure. Also, the body components and substances are the elements through which sorcery"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"can afflict the person.The main body attribute is its capacity for movement: a body without life is simply\"still matter\" or an inactive \"thing.\" An organism without movement is not a properliving thing. To be alive, as the Arara understand life and the living, is to have thecapacity of otchitotketpit-moving, being animated, and being able to \"go away\" fromone place to another. The idea of movement, which broadly is the capacity to shiftthrough different places, goes along with the very notion of life. However, even thoughthe end of bodily motion is a criteria for the identification of life, it is not the definitivesign of death. Death is also a process. It is common to say that \"someone died a little\"after a serious accident, a major fight, or a wound that produces abundant bleeding evenfor a little while. With the end of bodily motion one continues to \"die\" gradually, untileverything consummates in full. Even during one's lifetime, a process of continuousmortification is entailed by the gradual loss of the person's vitality. Many processesplay important roles in this continuous mortification during the lifetime: the immanentaging of the \"hard parts\" of the body, serious accidents impacting on the \"soft\" parts ofthe body, pathogenic factors associated with infections or other alterations produced inthe person through body lesions or wounds, and even different sorts of direct predationby malign beings that dominate metaphysical settings.The person's vitality is tied to the vital substances that circulate inside the body (seeTeixeira-Pinto ig8g). Identified by the radical /kuru/, the vital substances are the objectof an incessant search as a condition for the maintenance and reproduction of life.Almost all body liquids and secretions are marked by the radical: blood (imdnkuru),sperm (ekuru), saliva (ilaptchikuru), breast milk (mongukuru), urine (tchikuru). All ofthese are metabolic transformations of the substances /kuru/ acquired during life. Therealso are free kinds of /kuru/ substances, such as some tree secretions (ieikuru) or thebitter cassava juice liberated through pressing manioc tubers (ekuru). These freeoccurrences of /kuru/ substances are defined as the natural food of some metaphysicalbeings that wander about within the world, and they are considered extremely dangerousfor the human being. The free occurrences of /kuru/ substances are also the subject ofcountless classes of taboos. Touching, seeing, or even talking about them in certainsituations (the proximity of a hunt, for example) can produce the physical state ofuopra' (see below). They must avoid touching blood (circulatory as well as menstrual)and any other tacky and viscous substance that recalls male sperm. Everything thatseems to have /kuru/ in free form represents danger because it is the favorite nutrient ofthe harmful living beings that circulate in the world and the chief factor attracting their"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"malefic actions.Existing in all living beings, the /kuru/ substances circulate in the world in a veryprecise way: if animals have it, it is because they have gotten it from other animals orplants that have gotten it from the soil that, in turn, got the substances from the deadanimals that lie directly on the earth. A precious source of vital substances is fermenteddrink, mainly those that are elaborated from root crops whose profitable parts growinside the earth, the many species of potatoes and cassavas that the Arara cultivate. Theearth is responsible for the overall processing and circulation of vital substances. Thus,the reason that the Arara do not put a dead body in the earth is that a dead body stillkeeps part of its vital liquids and thus would be reintroduced within the /kuru/ circuit. Itis precisely to avoid the deceased's direct contact with the soil that they lay the corpsedown on an elevated platform. A dead person buried on a platform above the groundrepresents the antithesis of the fermented drink made from vegetable roots grown insidethe soil.Elsewhere (Teixeira-Pinto 1997) I have shown that, while opposed to fermented drink,an Arara corpse lying on a platform is the logical counterpart of a sacrificed enemy,which is ritually transformed into a decorated skull, set on top of a tree trunk, andreduced to the symbolic (fertilizing) value of fermented beverage. During an impressiveceremonial, a large amount of beverage is left at the base of the trunk, just as it wasbrought by the ritual character represented by the decorated trunk. Also, the womendrink large quantities of the brew while claiming they are \"taking a child from thetrunk,\" a clear reference to the reproductive meaning of both the beverage and thekilling of an enemy.The human acquisition of the /kuru/ substances comes mostly through consumption ofthe fermented drink: the roots that they use in its preparation absorb the substances thatanimals lose in the soil (see Teixeira-Pinto 1989). The different manners of consumingthe piktu produce modifications in the person's status, their place within the socialworld, and the many formal relationships of cooperation and solidarity that the Araracultivate. The joint consumption of fermented drink creates and informs the social andsymbolic context that involves the person. On the other hand, the interruption of theprocess of acquisition is what defines death as a gradual and uninterrupted loss of theperson's vitality.The Arara fear hot things placed on or \"inside\" the bodies because they could burn anddry up organic substances. Further, there is no good in eating hot things because doing"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"so could \"dry up the inside.\" The risk is greater for those who more often practiceshamanism. They should keep intact their vital substances that provide them with theconditions of access to the metaphysical powers (which have vital substances as theirpreferential food). Major burns or bleeding is damaging to a shaman's ability, for adried man loses contact with other living beings in the world. Physical impairment,illness, and states of indisposition are also defined as alterations in the substancescirculating inside the body. For these a shaman might prescribe or conduct therapies. Itis through the same symptomatology that a shaman can identify evidence thatsomething of sorcery is inside the body of a sick person.Changes in a person's state must receive treatment based on alimentary taboos. Thefirst, uo pra, is an indisposition associated mostly with menstrual blood that isidentified in cases of constant failure in hunting. Emanations from menstrual blood(imandem) of a careless woman who, during her period, prepares food or touchesobjects later manipulated by the men, can penetrate through the fingernails, go upthrough the fingers and arms, and reach the shoulder articulations. To avoid it, apartfrom the many restrictions imposed on women when menstruating, all the adult menmust use an armlet (mbYa) around the biceps of the left arm (the one that holds thebow).Not always does this armlet avoid the penetration of harmful emanations frommenstrual blood into a man's body. Each failure or error in the hunt (the importance ofwhich will depend on a subjective evaluation that takes into consideration a man'straditional performance in the hunt) entails the suspicion of an uo pra state. Hunters cansubmit to rites to remove the bad luck and reestablish good hunting fortune. The uo'prastate is not embodied in the mistakes or accidents involving a man, although theseempirically reveal the bad luck: it is the animals that feel the strange emanations of aman contaminated by menstrual blood and then run away from the hunter's sight orbehave in a strange or atypical manner and thereby tangle up the shot. The animals canalso feel the emanations that come with the arrows (or bullets or cartridges)manipulated by someone who could contaminate. But not every animal can fullyperceive a state of uo pra. At times it is the peccaries (or the tapirs, etc.) who foreseethe magical infections, and they do so in such a way that for each individual animalspecies avoiding a hunter there exists a specific therapy or native medicine.There are four classes of medicines used for problems related to the state of uo pra, allof which act through the same general principle: pieces of an animal skin are rubbed onthe hunter's arms and face.

Surprisingly, there are no medicines for problems in thedeer hunt (kariami): the only procedure to overcome eventual failures in hunting a deeris to play the tididi, the flute made out of an enemy's skull.Broadly speaking, everything that \"gets into\" or \"gets out\" of a human body canchange the person's state. Emanations from menstrual blood, a child who is born (thefetus is made by the semen that goes out of the father's penis to the mother's uteruswhence it will come out after the proper time), or any alterations imposed by livingbeings or malicious attitudes are only instances of the sorts of things a person's statecan be subject to. Accordingly, every possible way of treatment and cure is also aprocess of introducing or removing something from a sick body.There exists a mild form of sorcery (tchano) that is made of thorns put on a hammockor in a tree in the usual path of the victim, which then penetrates the skin and infectsvarious vital organs. It can, however, be removed by simple massages and shamanicextractions. The many general infections produced by the hidden forces of the forest arealso conceived either as direct penetrations (strange beings invading the victim's body)or as indirect contagion (a metaphysical being who sees those who are careless in theforest and then spits some sort of miasma that invades the victims). Death, ormortification, is seen as a loss, extraction, or deprivation of the person's vitalsubstances.The distinct ways of proceeding with shamanic anamnesis, treatment, and cure alwaystake into consideration the way a person is constituted, and thus each involves slightlydifferent processes of \"getting into\" and \"getting out\": food, drink, medicines, orpathogens are elements that can change a person's state. Yet we have already seen howthe medicines act through transmission of odors to the skin of a patient. Therapy byextraction, one of the most evident procedures performed by shamans, is calledikurukit- pit-a verb that also denotes the common action of cleaning, wiping, andwashing. The shaman, without any trance or special preparation, massages, fastens,twists, wrings, and sometimes blows over the hurt or sore body parts. An anamnesis isperformed mostly when there is no physical evidence of lesion or injuries because thereis a risk of tchano or other extrasensitive source of infection and contamination. Todifferentiate between a simple illness (abudup) and a pathological state of diffuseetiology is something that only a skilled shaman is capable of doing. The shamanic"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"therapy of massages and extractions, ikurukitpit, acts on objects and substances that aremerged or conflated with those that normally give vitality to the person. The associationbetween the substances that naturally compose a regular human physiology and thosethat penetrate through exogenous processes can lead to the aggravation of the morbidstate and, eventually, start the process of mortification because the pathogenic agent candamage the circulation of the vital substances in the body and impair its capacity formovement.Besides the aromatic therapies and those done through massages or extractions, therealso are some treatments based on diet. Food taboos apply to two different changes in aperson's state: when they are uo pra, as in the situations described above, and when theyare amfli; just after the birth of a new child or when a wife is \"too pregnant\" as they say.Both uo pra and amfli are included in a more general pathological situation calledmangupe, in which dissimilar etiologies can lead the person to bodily or mentalinstability, unexplained weakness, or undetermined aboulias (akarak puinan). These aretypes of indisposition in which there are no discernible wounds, lesions, or pains, andthus cannot properly be considered a disease (pain and \"illnesses\" are abudup). Forthese states of unexplained weakness there exists a remedial herb bath (manguepti) andfood restrictions. The difference between the dietary restrictions for uo'pra and amililies in the fact that the one who protects himself after the birth of a new child, apartfrom the quantity of food and the sort of meat he can consume, must also eat alonewithout any contact or physical proximity to others.Apart from his healing function a shaman must also perform two other tasks, bothdealing with metaphysical powers. First, a shaman's expertise provides the logical andsymbolic conditions for success in hunting practices. Second, it is the shamans who arein charge of collective protection against the perils and risks of living. The first task isachieved through a very simple shamanic ritual that is performed at the beginning of anew period of the year when men hunt collectively (during the dry season), while thesecond task depends on the chances or even the need of encountering the powerfulmythical jaguar (okoro).The Hunt: Game for Assuring Collective Well-BeingTechniques of identification, search, attraction, and persecution of animals comprisethe empirical side of any hunt. There are many complex techniques but virtually all areshared by all adult men. The transformation of these hunting techniques into a socialeffective reality is done only by means of their subordination to and control by a set of"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"social imperatives of cooperation, solidarity, and generosity (mostly connected with theformal partnerships and the acquisition and sharing of meat and fermented beverages).On the other hand, all hunting activity is also placed under the symbolic model thatdefines meat as equivalent to fermented beverage. Every game animal obtained is to beexchanged for fermented drink. There is a clear complementarity between those whoproduce the brew in the village and those who kill animals in the forest, just as there iscomplementarity between game and fermented beverages. It is this logical associationthat embodies the deep foundations of the Arara social world. Furthermore, thetransformation of animal flesh into meat to be appropriated by humans impliessymbolic mechanisms essential for the understanding of the very nature of Ararasociability.Nearly every animal species is under the metaphysical control of spiritual beingscalled oto, who act as the animal owners or wardens. It is only through a kind ofagreement between humans and the oto that the former can hunt. This agreement has atwofold expression, the first of which is through the musical festivities that precede thehunters' return from their long expeditions, in which the Arara give notice to the otothat the humans have killed many animals (see Teixeira-Pinto 1997, chs. 1, 4); and thesecond is through animal domestication (iamft). What exactly then, is the importance ofthe oto for human existence?Apart from the minor food taboos imposed on specific occasions, the Arara have adiet with only a few restrictions. Indeed, they do not abstain from anything: they eattoads, vultures, electric fish, and almost everything that crawls, walks, flies, or swims.Virtually omnivorous, the Arara exclude from their diet only creatures that, even thoughapparently animal in nature, surpass a \"natural quality.\" Sloths, anteaters, owls, andotters (as well as other mustelids) tend to be avoided by the Arara because they areanimals that are not under the protection and control of an oto. In effect, to have an otoas a metaphysical patron is an exclusive condition (although a paradoxical one) for ananimal to be edible. The practical condition of being edible is to be \"huntable,\" and thusto have a spiritual warden is the precondition for being subject to human predation.The Arara end their big collective hunt by the end of the dry season, when it is time toresume agricultural work. With the rains coming, the collective hunting activities beginto cease, and the drinking, the parties, and the gatherings in general also decrease.Gardening seems almost to be an asocial or even antisocial activity; Arara sociability ismost generally associated with hunting and drinking. Indeed, everything happens as ifthe abundance of meat and fermented drink were the exclusive elements that could"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"make Arara social life possible. But the interlude that comes with the rains andagriculture lasts just until the next dry season. Before a new dry season comes it isnecessary to prepare for it as a new suitable time for hunting.While the other men are still busy with the gardening work a solitary shaman takes awalk into the forest, where he goes to execute an oral rite. Pounding on the forest floor,shaking the foliage, and beating the trees, the shaman repeats many times:These words are a nonliteral translation of the formula used by a shaman: the wordiamit designates both pets and foster children. The shaman talks to a specific oto,requesting the young of a particular species so that it can be raised by humans. The otoare said to keep such animals inside a big box, and when it is opened mature and younganimals are liberated together, and humans can find the young in the forest.The Arara have special houses for pets. The relation between iamft, breastfeeding, andalimentary interdiction is significant, because a pet must be fed as immature humansare: with women's breast milk. Breast milk is mongukuru-something full of the vitalsubstance that composes, forms, and sustains the organic processes that partiallyconstitute the person. Feeding the pets with human milk means they becomeconsubstantial with humans, and this is the main reason why the Arara prohibit thekilling and eating of pets.On the other hand, if those who raise pets as iamit cannot kill and eat that particularanimal, those who demand young animals from an oto shall for a certain period stophunting for the species under the control of that specific oto. However, there is nothingto limit the action of all other men who, roaming in the forest, can meet the animalsconceptually liberated by their oto: in other words, a shaman asks for pets, and then thehunters come through and kill the other animals that were also liberated. Thus, a mancan kill animals only with the proviso that someone else (a shaman or any adult man)refrains from doing so through the interdictions that come with the iamitmagicalformula. This is in actuality a very tricky strategy, which helps us to identify another"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"aspect of the iamit institution. If the one who asks for pets is forbidden to hunt thatanimal species, would it necessarily mean that he can't eat that species? Nobody saysthey cannot eat it if somebody else kills them!What is the symbolic nature of the meat that Arara eat? Appropriately, it lies in theconception that meat is something that exists under the sole condition of being given inexchange for fermented drink. Thus the conceptual nature of meat nullifies theagreement celebrated between humans and metaphysical powers through the iamitformula. The interdictions on hunting and the restrictions on eating imposed onsomeone (or a few hunters) are the real conditions for hunting and eating by many. Theiamit shamanic formula for obtaining pets, as a symbolic condition that makes huntingand the acquisition of meat possible, emerges as a sort of deliberate human perfidy.Even though acting as a trickster is a common characteristic among Amerindianshamans, here the Arara seem to have added a little extra.The very foundations of human relationships-that is, the symbolic attributes of meatbeing equivalent to fermented drink-involve betrayal, fraud, and perfidy regarding thesupernatural beings that provide the means for its achievement. Human existence andsociability depend on a kind of treachery. The effectiveness of the iamit magicalformula lies in its circumlocution, which restricts the iamitfrom killing but at the sametime deceives and deludes the animal's metaphysical warden, thus redoubling theprobability of success in hunting by other men. The most interesting thing here is thatsuch trickery is the initial circumstance of the real possibility of social life, because itdepends on the exchange system of fermented beverage extracted from root crops forthe meat of animals hunted under the metaphysical conditions of the iamit formula.Every year at the end of the Amazonian rainy season, a shaman goes to the forest toperform another iamit ritual, which is done explicitly to prepare the animals' spiritualwarden for the great slaughter of the oncoming dry season when the men resumecollective hunts. A single shaman in the forest is thus symbolically capable of settingforth again the general framework that supports full life in society: the betrayal of thecosmological powers whose existence entitles the animals to be hunted, exchanged, andeaten. This is done as a condition for community well-being, the very existence ofhuman sociality. It could be stated that a single shaman going to perform the iamftritual in the forest is acting in the strict sense of the other's collective living. It happensto have almost the same meaning as other typical shamanic tasks: the encounters withthe mythical jaguar."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"The Jaguar: Perils and the Shamanic AnticultA shaman encounters an okoro without anybody seeing or knowing. Unlike manyother Arara traditional activities, it is not possible to go to one of these encounters witha jaguar accompanied by anyone else. An encounter with okoro is defined as a solitaryand unwitnessed task. What is learned during initiations is that, while in an allegedaltered state of consciousness caused by the direct consumption of the omiatsembflfinfusion, or after its regular use over a long period, one can see, observe, and identifymany metaphysical beings, of which the jaguar in the context of shamanism is certainlyone. Both the direct consumption of the infusion and the trance state itself do not seemto be absolutely necessary to the shamanic practice, however. It is said that many okorowho are well-trained in shamanic techniques and in other magical practices couldachieve without ingestion of any substances a mental state in which they can contactsupernatural beings. It is also said that a persistent practice of encounteringmetaphysical powers, together with self-control, can enable a shaman to recognizewithout too much effort signs of a supernatural being's presence and activitiesunperceived by normal eyes.What the shaman does when he encounters an okoro is called ikurukitpit, the sameconcept used to designate shamanic therapeutic massages and extractions. The term alsodesignates the act of \"cleaning\" or removing any filth or impurity from some object orbody. For healing practices the meaning seems quite evident: the penetration of strangeobjects or substances into human bodies causes a corporal imbalance, which can berecovered by shamanic massages and \"extractions.\" In the healing setting, ikurukitpitactually suggests a \"cleaning\" of impurities that contaminate and harm a sick body. Inencounters with the jaguars, however, the same term that is used for a very specificactivity leads to some interpretive problems. A literal association would lead us tosuppose that the proximity of okoro -the immediate cause of which is to promote theshaman's encounter with the jaguar-should be also considered as a kind of\"malfunction\" (like an illness or any indisposition) to be dealt with and controlled bythe exercise of ikurukitpYt. Yet illnesses and any unascertained organic indispositions(abudup, mangupe, etc. -the most common sicknesses that normally require shamanictreatments) have very precise etiologies and prescriptive therapeutics: they are\"penetration effects\" caused by invisible agents and eliminated by shamanic massagesand extractions. It is said that okoro approaches humans because they are \"angry\"(ikurin), and it would be to appease the jaguar that the shaman goes to an ikurukitpYtsession. If there is nothing extraordinary about an aggressive jaguar, why should a"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"shaman go to an ikurukitpit okoro, as if he were about to perform a sort of shamanichealing? The answer to this lies in the jaguar's twofold nature: they can be either thehateful divinity Akuanduba or a deceased Arara relative. The Arara define death as aprocess of liberation of the person's components. Through the multiple beings intowhich a corpse is transformed, most of them harmful to the living, any death reveals aquantum of violence and aggressiveness that are embedded in the temporary junctionsthat forge a live human body. A corpse transformed into a feline is just an emblem ofthe overall condition of living in this world.16However, aggressiveness, violence, and predation, which are what a jaguar epitomizesas the natural precondition of the world, must not be allowed to exist among livingrelatives: everything in Arara social life is explicitly thought and done to avoid andremove the hazards of untempered behaviors that can prolong misfortunes among theliving. An Arara myth recounts how, after an almost perfect life in the sky, the Ararawere condemned to live a very afflictive life on earth (which is nothing but the leftoversof the mythical sky's ground), and unrestrained and uncontrolled behavior would leadthem to a tremendous open clash, equal to that which destroyed the originalcosmological architecture. Akuanduba, the most powerful supernatural being in theArara pantheon, inflicts punishment on them in many ways, such as sending noxiousbeings to harm people, transforming corpses into jaguars to scare those who are stillliving, and masquerading himself as a black jaguar, the largest and most terrifyingpredator.None but a very powerful shaman can approach a black jaguar. On a more regularbasis the shaman's aim is to seek out those jaguars that are the reappearance of deceasedrelatives in a new bodily form. Wapuri, one of the most prestigious shamans at the timeof my fieldwork, once told me he would go to meet a jaguar just to stimulate itsmemory that the people alive in the village are still its \"relatives\" and thus should notbe prey of its voracity. And so a shaman goes searching for those jaguars that in life arerelated to the living Arara. Here the act of ikurukitpYt seems to recall its earliermeaning as a technique to return a body to its regular state.The deceased bodies, through the transformations they are submitted to and the newliving forms they assume, return to adhere to previous aggressive and violent ways ofbehaving. Therefore the ikurukitpYt action, when seeking to recover the originalrelations between a jaguar and the ones that are still alive, would have as its meaningthe removal of much of the ag gression, violence, and virtual predation that dead peoplehave while under the jaguar skin. These are ways of acting which must be banned from"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"the community as a whole. Thus a shaman directs himself to controlling the dangers ofhostility, aggression, violence, and predation that accompany a dead person garbed in afine jaguar skin. Its very presence among the living proclaims that hostility, anger, andbelligerence are intrinsic qualities of this world, and it demands immediate shamanicaction. What is interesting here is that ikurukitpYt as a shamanic action toward thejaguar as a dead person's specter does not apply to any of the many other \"spirits\" that adeceased body releases after the end of the body's movements: tcharupangma,ikaualangma, and editen. It is only the okoro that is subjected to the extreme loss ofmemory that entails the deep forgetfulness of the former affiliation with the livingpeople. Being solitary and, above all, a predator, a jaguar is the paramount embodimentof what should not constitute the rules, values, and ways of behaving among livingpeople.Death is also a revelation of the nature of the Arara person. The multiple beings intowhich the corpse's parts are transformed are the embodiment of the essential parts ofthe person during the transitory life of the physical body, and most of these beingsemerge into a nonsocial way of living. It is precisely around the body (its fabrication,reproduction, and maintenance through the consuming of food and drink that are theobjects of human exchanges) that social ties among the living are built. Thus thefragmentation of the body after death, the postmortem destinies of the bodies, point to asolitary existence due to the loss of the qualities that characterize social life.In the Arara imagination, solitude always goes along with aggressiveness, violence,and the chance for predation. The loss of ties of solidarity implies solitary beings. Therevealing of the violent constituents of the person is connected to the loss of ties amongthe living (kinship, affinity, partnerships, and social links in general). In this sense theexpected results of the shamanic action, when he evokes the former relations betweenthe dead and the living, is to recover the ties of solidarity. The shaman therefore acts inthe name of solidarity ties that must be in force among relatives and thus avoids theaggressive and violent nature intrinsic to the person's constitution, despite the fact thatdeath constantly reveals its own aggressive nature. Although part of being alive canalways be revealed by the nature of being dead, a shaman is expected to act in the nameof the living and reflect the values and rules for being alive.By renewing the connections that once joined the jaguar and the living, the shamanexpresses the precaution that the living must maintain against hostility, aggression, andviolence among humans. Everything here suggests a kind of \"inverted ritual ofpassage,\" because reconverting a potential predator into a relative is like bringing a"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"modified being back to its previous state. Hence the action of ikurukitpYt okoro aims atregaining a peaceful and gentle relative from a wild and predatory jaguar through theshaman's symbolic agency on the metaphysical scene. It is then quite clear thatshamanic encounters with jaguars have nothing to do with any kind of worship or cult,but rather very much the contrary. And it is also an inversion of the shamanic formulaaddressed to the oto. As I describe above, the iamYt oration is designed to establishlinks between humans and animals so that animals can become, through a tricksterstrategy, objects of human predation that, once hunted and reduced to the mere status ofmeat, accompany fermented drink as the nourishment for human bodies and socialsolidarity. On the other hand, when approaching the jaguars, a shaman intends to avoidits predatory passion and set apart any belligerence, hostility, or violent behaviorprecisely by reconstructing the links between the dead and the living.The control over virtual violence through its conceptual subordination to thesolidarity that must define all relationships among the Arara is what is symbolicallyengraved on the shamanic actions toward the okoro. Thus a shaman's periodicencounters with the jaguars symbolize the opposition between life and death in such away that the degree of the dissimilarity between being still alive (enge) and beingalready dead (irumbot) becomes valuable for the moral aspects of human living. But itis not the simple opposition between life and death that plays an important role here.The simple fact of being alive (engouete) does not produce any good for the moralgrounds of human existence. It is the set of associations between death, aggression, andloneliness, on the one hand, and life, sociality, and the moral commitments to apeaceful and generous way of life, on the other, that fulfills the meaning of existence.However, solitude, and therefore aggression, predation, and death are the naturalattributes of living in the world after the original catastrophe. And they are thecosmologically imposed conditions from which human sociality must escape. Byaiming to avoid the solitude that can lead anyone to selfish and aggressive behavior, theArara have built up a strong network of multiple formal individual connections.Conclusion: Sorcery's OutrageAs the very shamanism that is its source, Arara sorcery does not involve any obscuretechniques, hidden skills, or mysterious science, nor is any specific initiation into itneeded. It works in exactly the same way as the shamanic arts; or, rather, it works inexactly the reverse way from shamanism, though taking advantage of the same corpusof knowledge about the functioning of the world and its connections with states of the"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"person and the body. It is on the person's and the individual's bodies that sorcery makesitself evident. Sorcery acts by forcing magical \"penetrations\" into a body, thusjeopardizing the normal physiology of the corporeal \"substances\" that compose a bodyand sustain the more subjective aspects of the person.Sorcery can be produced through a healing procedure, through magical formulasaddressed to metaphysical powers asking for help to harm someone the next time he isfound wandering in the forest, or through any other means normally available toshamans. It is always manifest as sudden changes, considered inscrutable or beyondordinary understanding, in bodily functions and/or the person's affective states. It is justlike the predation process imposed by malicious cosmological beings or by shamanicprocedures that, instead of extracting harmful agents out of sick bodies, introducepathogens inside them. Because of it, sorcery is a kind of inversion of the expected roleof a shaman. There is only one way to differentiate between the two possible causes ofailments (a foreseeable attack by cosmological beings and an outrageous attack by adeviant shaman, which can be any adult man), and that is to think back to try todetermine whether in recent history someone would have any reason to be upset andwish to cause any harm.The motivations a shaman can have to act in such a way are defined as otchinme, aconcept comparable to jealousy, selfishness, or acting in \"self- benefit\"-that is, notacting toward the benefit of others. Previous quarrels, disputes, serious disagreements,or even political aspirations are among the reasons one can use to make an accusation ofsorcery against someone. At first everything appears just as a suspicion without anactual suspect. Being a victim of sorcery is the first complaint; then, after beingannounced in a public meeting on the village patio, normally during a gathering fordrinking manioc beer, the complaint can evolve to a formal accusation, depending onthe acceptance of the assertions. This is the kernel of the whole process: convincingothers of the seriousness of the facts and symptoms described and the probability ofbeing produced by sorcery. If in the previous days the person who is claiming to be avictim of sorcery has actually been involved in a conflict situation with another person,the chances of being victimized by sorcery increase. This is the main reason why everyman ought to avoid becoming involved in serious disputes, quarrels, or any situationthat can develop into a suspicious or a straightforward accusation of sorcery. Beingthought of as generous, kind, and cooperative slightly increases the chances of not beingaccused, and bad behavior, even on occasion, can lead to inclusion on a list of suspectsof those considered capable of acting as a sorcerer. There is no clear evidence of"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"identifying the source of sorcery as always being from the outside. On the contrary,given the sociological and moral dimensions of shamanic powers, the tendency is tolook to the inside of the local group or to a nearby household to try to discover theguilty one. It is quite clear, then, that the only possible limit for not being included on alist of suspects of sorcery lies in the moral aspects of interindividual social bonds.The technical possibility of using the same shamanic competence to cause damageinstead of well-being puts the whole society on a dead-end route. Because the onlychance of existing in this world includes being dependent on shamanism, it is existenceitself that appears to be fragile and unstable. There is no way of understanding humansociality without understanding the risk of being subject to sorcery, as there is no otherway of determining any cosmological support for human sociality. What sorcery does isexactly reconnect human existence with the undesirable cosmological conditions ofliving on this terrestrial level. And this is the greatest risk that human sociality issubject to. This is the conceptual challenge that sorcery presents: human socialitydepends on the inversion of the cosmological determinants, which in turn depends onshamanic powers to create the conditions for living outside the violent cycle ofpredation that characterizes the whole world, which are the same powers that canreintroduce the harmful cosmological forces into human social existence. Yet, whilehuman sociality depends on a collective agreement, its rupture depends only on anindividual decision: a shaman who decides to break the moral imperative to use hisskills only for the benefit of others. Because this is what everyone should avoid by allmeans, there is a virtually universal agreement about the punishment to be applied: thatis, banishment, an imposed isolation that is the admission of individual autonomy (to befully experienced now) and, paradoxically, also the reaffirmation of the very nature ofhuman sociality. As understood by the Arara, there is a striking fragility within sociallife, for it depends on the strength of the moral commitments between individuals.Otherwise, the only other choice would be living alone.Tchibie was in the first generation of a family condemned to live on its own, with theonly chance of reproducing itself through incestuous unions. For many years, Tchibieand her family lived a secluded life, which was not interrupted by any nativeinvolvement but rather by FuNAI's intervention. It was the massive nonindigenousintrusion into the Arara's traditional territory that led FUNAI to contact them. Mostlikely, from the Arara point of view, they would have remained cloistered within theirown misfortune of isolation and incest.

Here, despite the evident interest of the case, they appear only asan example - one taken from real life- of what can happen to those who break themoral rules linked to the powers of the shaman. For a general analysis of Ararakinship and marriage practices, which include polygyny, intergenerational unions,and, in particular circumstances, the formal possibility of incest in the form of amarriage with a half-sister, see Teixeira-Pinto 1995a and 1997.3 The Arara have two contiguous yet officially distinct territories: the first, which isquite small but completely legalized, is reserved for the Arara of the Laranjal; thesecond, which is larger but recently interdicted and under different sorts of economicand political pressures, is reserved for the Arara of Cachoeira Seca-Iriri. In general,the chances for the physical and social reproduction of the Arara as a whole dependboth on the conservation of the two areas and on the rejoining of the broken tiesbetween the two segments of the population.4 The official name of the reservation where the Indians were settled is CachoeiraSecaIriri.5 Between 1970 and 1980, the nonindigenous population in the region increased bymore than 200 percent due to Brazilian government policies for the occupation ofAmazonia.6 See chapter 1 of Teixeira-Pinto 1997 for a discussion of the connections betweenshamanism and the conditions for activities such as hunting and gardening."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"7 My views on several aspects of Arara shamanism and sociality is clearly influencedby some of Overing's inspiring analysis on both topics (1985, 1990, 1993, 1999) aswell as works by Perrin (1995), Hamayon (1982), and Langdon (1992 and 1996).Regarding the subject of \"morality,\" many insights were gained from reading thecollection edited by Howell (1997).8 See Teixeira-Pinto 2001 for a more in-depth presentation of the Arara's recent historyin relation to contact with Brazilian national society.9 A fermented beverage made of masticated manioc flour and warm water.in Modified by the possessive t, ibirinda literally means \"my other.\"11 Uoktangat is obscure even to the Arara; they told me that it is \"just a noun.\"12 See below for a short description of Arara cosmology. See also chapter 2 inTeixeiraPinto 1997 for a more detailed description and analysis.13 The largest concentrations of the vine are in the northern areas of the Araratraditional territory, but after the construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway theArara were restricted to the southern part of their area, where there are only a fewplaces they can find the vine. However, I am quite sure that the limited importanceof the infusion has no connection with the territorial constraint.14 The history of the formation of the present Arara cosmos defines this terrestrial levelas the domain to which flows everything that remained after a primordialcatastrophe. The primordial cosmos was shattered after a fight between two peoplerelated through the category ipari (matrilateral cross-cousins or, in general, anaffine). The land on this terrestrial level is said to be what was left of the primevalcosmological floor, which broke up and fell from the sky after the combat. That floorwas also the edge of the domain where every benign being used to live. Beyond thefrontiers of that level there were only different kinds of malicious beasts withatrocious behavior living in a permanent cruel quarrel-in short, a horrifyingexistence. With the cosmological breakup, the coexistence of all types of livingbeing began to be an imposed necessity. As a result of all of this, even extraordinaryand evil creatures can now appear on the terrestrial plane.

This person status is analogous to thecosmological attributes associated with the terrestrial level, where the human bodyreceived its actual morphological constitution. The tense conceptual compositionbetween unity and multiplicity is what is expressed in both the person and theterrestrial domain (see Teixeira-Pinto 1993a and 1997).16 In other works I have presented a full description of the metaphysical transformationof deceased persons and the consequences of this transformation for Arara social life(see Teixeira-Pinto 1993a and 1997, ch. 2).ReferencesBasso, Ellen. 1977.

While thefirst specialist is initiated in his art by men, the second depends on the yuxin themselvesto confirm his power. Despite this apparently clear distinction, it is my intention here todemonstrate that this terminological dualism conceals a conceptual continuum ofoverlapping practices and specialists that follows the logic of Cashinahua dualisticthought in general.The Cashinahua sociological and cosmological thought system is characterized by adynamic dualism in which alterity is produced from sameness and sameness fromalterity, where each element of an opposed pair (moiety dua/moiety inu, Boa-water/Inka-fire) partakes of its opposite, and form lies in the bounded and relativelystable intermixing of complementary opposites (bone/skin, body/spirit, male/female,kin/affine, etc.). In such a world, body, identity, and the problem of alterity are notissues of category or classification but rather are relational and philosophical issues.It has been shown in the literature on Pano-speaking peoples that whereas somepeoples have a myriad of intermarrying groups, the Cashinahua stress their moietysystem. The many spirits, deities, and mythical characters, some of which are held incommon by different Pano-speaking groups, are organized by the Cashinahua into acluster of dualities, in which the master of water beings is the boa/anaconda and issemantically linked to the moon, while the master of the sky, called Inka, has thunderand lightning and the jaguar and the harpy eagle as his representatives and issemantically associated with the sun. This cosmological dualism, based on thecomplementary qualities of the perishable and the imperishable, is used in moietysymbolism and in ritual language. This dualism, however, involves a dynamic andcomplex relation between terms that insistently questions a substantialist definition ofidentity and difference. Through recurring inversions of role and position in the namingsystem and ritual, and through constant definitional paradoxes in discourse, the questionof sameness and otherness becomes salient as the central theme around whichCashinahua ontology revolves. Cashinahua discourse on the activities of dark shamans,and on the possibility that any human being could turn into one, is consistent with this"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"view. If the Tupi-speaking Kagwahiv say that everyone who dreams has a bit of ashaman (Kracke 1987), the Cashinahua would say that everybody who has someknowledge has a bit of a dark shaman.The puzzling concept of nawa, stranger, as opposed to huni, human being, isparadigmatic to Cashinahua (and in general Panoan) ambiguity in relation to a fixeddefinition of boundaries between self and other, and will suffice to illustrate my pointabout Cashinahua dualism. Nawa can be used as a term to denote \"real\" otherness:strangers and potential enemies, like the white colonizers or mythical inkas (cannibalgods). When such people or game animals are invoked or named in ritual songs, theyare always called nawa. But nawa is also used in the ethnological literature to refer to abroad range of different Pano-speaking peoples (the Nawa of the Yurua-Purus region,including the Cashinahua, Yaminahua, and others), or as part of an ethnonym attributedto and by Panoan neighbors, in which case it comes to mean \"people,\" as in such formsas cashi (vampire bat) -nawa (people) or yami (stone axe) -nawa (people). Nawa canalso be used in terms denoting one of the moieties or name-giving sections inside one'sown community.This shows that a single concept can occupy all the different positions of a scale goingfrom the pole of complete otherness and enmity to the pole that includes the collectivenotion of self, denoting membership in one of the subdivisions that define the interiorof one's own community. This does not mean, however, that the term nawa loses itsintrinsic relational character while huni occupies the pole of identification. No matterhow close it comes to the concept of self, nawa will always mean someone other thanoneself. This is the reason why no one will ever refer to himself or herself as nawa, norwill the word nawa be used to refer to a person who one wants to feel close to. In thissense nawa remains the other, although an other that can easily be transformed into thesame, by switching points of view. Nawa and huni, enemies and kin are opposites, butenemies can become kin, and kin can become nawa. The Cashinahua universe is auniverse in constant transformation where different beings and complementary rolesoccupy contiguous positions.Thus even if among Panologists the Cashinahua have been famous for their dualisticthought, I will demonstrate that the Cashinahua place more emphasis on continuity thanon mutual exclusiveness. The same holds true for the pair of specialists in Cashinahuadiscourse on the practice of dark shamanism. Both the \"owner of medicine\" (dauya) andthe \"one with the bitter substance\" (mukaya) have their dark side, being healers as wellas sorcerers.' In between these two poles there is a continuum of other specialists who"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"also deal with the subject of healing or killing by means of the use of substances ormanipulating energies or beings called yuxin. Thus the opposition established betweenthe two kinds of shamans conceals a broad spectrum of different specialties, giving usthe strong impression that the figures of the dauya and the mukaya play the role oflogical limits of two different kinds of methodologies for dealing with well-being andmisfortune that are to a certain degree more coexistent than mutually exclusive ineveryday practice and discourse.When analyzed in this way, Cashinahua practices related to illness and healthresemble much more those of other Panoan groups such as the Katukina (Lima 2000)and Yawanahua (Perez 1999). One striking difference with these groups, however, is thefact that among the Cashinahua healing practices are more diluted into an overridingconcern with well-being and growth and less crystallized into fixed roles andspecializations? Thus what seems to be part of a standard initiation for everyknowledgeable adult male among the Cashinahua is seen to give rise to a spectrum ofspecialized healers among the Yawanahua and, to a lesser extent, the Katukina. In thisway, whereas xinaya for the Cashinahua means no more than a \"knowledgeable man (orwoman)\" whose knowledge includes a wide variety of healing plants and ritual songs,for the Yawanahua xinaya indicates a special kind of song healer, openly recognized assuch by his community.All scholars who have studied the Cashinahua, myself included, have been puzzled bytheir lack of stress on the shamans among themselves relative to the great deal ofemphasis they place on shamanism in their cosmology, in which the agency of otherbeings, plants and animals included, can be used by humans to affect the well-being ofother humans without the use of physical violence. This is the reason for the heuristicuse of comparative sources in this paper. Not only is it healthy, for theoretical reasons,to transcend the rigid, and to a certain point artificial, ethnic boundaries imposed byethnologists on their subjects of study, but in this case comparative data are extremelyrelevant because they reveal both the surprising homogeneity of a regional indigenousthought system with respect to dark shamanism and the particular position that theCashinahua occupy in this field.Thus, among the Cashinahua the invisibility of knowledge related to sources of healthand illness-producing substances and songs is not accidental, and it is my aim here toanalyze the reasons for this concealment -not of practices but of roles and publiclyrecognized power. Therefore, whereas among the Culina, the close neighbors andtraditional enemies of the Cashinahua, almost all males are shamans or sorcerers,"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"according to what they, the Cashinahua, and Culina scholars (Pollock 1992) say, theCashinahua affirm that they have lost all of their powerful specialists-sorcerers andshamans alike. This state of affairs, however, is not seen as a weakness but rather as theresult of a conscious control of knowledge and power that has not been lost, because itis out there even though safely concealed from excessive exposure and use.Nevertheless, the dauya, and the mukaya continue to occupy an important place inCashinahua discourse, and I describe below the way they function in discourse aslogically distinct and necessarily complementary. It should be noted, however, that thenonexclusive character of attributes re - lated to the mukaya or the dauya is consistentwith Cashinahua dualism, where identity always entails a participation in the identity ofone's opposite (Lagrou 1998). This is also consistent with the Cashinahua worldview inwhich the distinction made between matter and soul does not correspond to the classicalmind/matter dualism of Western thought traditions. Thus, because plants are imbuedwith as well as vehicles of spirit matter and energy (yuxin), it is not possible to sustainthe classical explanation that plant medicines treat illnesses with a \"natural\" causewhile shamanism treats illnesses due to \"supernatural\" causes (Kensinger 1995:211,215). Ambiguity here is not used to conceal a lack of clarity but rather to reveal anunderlying complexity of thought and action. If I have known mukaya and dauya poisonusers only through discourse and never in practice, the real persons I have known wereall somewhere in between, with several male and female adults knowing a good dealabout plant medicines and poisons as well as about yuxin beings, their fertile and lethalomnipresence, and ways of dealing with them. In this essay, I intend to present theeveryday practices of the \"knowledgeable\" adults whom I observed in the field, alongwith the discourse about \"real\" dark shamans, who are almost always placed at a safedistance in space and time.Dauya, A Category of AccusationDau indicates medicine as well as poison, and it is in the sense of \"poison user\" thatthe sorcerer gains existence in Cashinahua discourse as a cate gory of accusation, readyto emerge in periods of conflict and village fission. While today, as in the pastaccording to earlier documents (Capistrano de Abreu 1941119141 ;4 see also Kensinger1995 on the fifties), the source of danger from the inside seems to reside much more inthe possible use of sorcery in the form of poison by kin, the source of danger from theoutside has been attributed to the use of shamanism by close neighbors, especially theKulina or, occasionally, the Yaminahua, a closely related Pano-speaking group."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Panoan peoples vary in the emphasis they place on the presence or recentdisappearance of sorcery, and they embrace a great variety of techniques ranging fromsongs and poison put in contact with bodily substances of the victim to the moreclassical Amazonian shamanic darts that are sent to kill people at a distance. ManuelSampaio, the young Cashinahua leader of a recently founded village called NovaAlianca, put the question in the following terms:When people knew the use of poison and shamanising, kinsmen killed kinsmen.When people started to die from the white man's illnesses, we lost a great amountof people. We decided that we needed to grow, if not we would disappear. We hadalready diminished very much. Now our villages are growing. Many new childrenhave been born and the Nation [nagao] of the Cashinahua has become big again.In this new village, which is celebrating its third birthday today, eighteen childrenhave been born and only two have died. This is so because our village is a happyvillage. Nobody should ever kill kinsmen again. Today the Culina still kill theirown people with duri. They also kill our people with duri. Our old people stillknow the poison which can kill but nobody knows how to take away duri.In similar terms, during E. Coffaci Lima's fieldwork she encountered several PanoanKatukina who stated emphatically that for them sorcery was a thing of the past. She alsostates however, that there were a few episodes in her stay where her suspicions werearoused. One of Lima's interlocutors stated, \"When I was a child, of the size of this boy[pointing to a boy of twelve years old], people were dying all the time of rao\"(2000:151). Note that the term rao, the Katukina equivalent of the term dau, whichamong the Cashinahua clearly refers to substances of plant or animal origin, can alsorefer to a bewitching oration (153-54). Thus, the Katukina took the decision to eradicatewhat was seen to be a permanent inclination toward instant vengeance through sorcery(rao) each time someone had been insulted. The explicit motivation for this collectivedeclaration of intentions was to let the population grow and to permit kin people tocohabit in the same village.The same decision was taken by the Yawanahua (Perez 1999:151), where pepper andtobacco powder have fallen in disuse because of their explicit associations with sorcery.Perez mentions a community meeting organized by the old and new village heads wherea collective agreement was made not to use sorcery anymore. Among the Yawanahuathe use of poison as well as killing songs are known, and people say both were used withfrequency in internal conflicts. Among their neighbors, the Katukina, the Yawanahuaare held responsible for several deaths that have occurred (Lima 2000:153, 155)."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Among the Marubo, on the other hand, sorcery is still held to be responsible for themajority of sudden and unexplained deaths: \"Some informants affirm that sorcery isvery much used today, since `all illness has this cause.' ... They say that in the old days\"wrong songs\" were only used by very angry people, but now people are angry all thetime with each other, there are fights between different big houses, they want to killeach other ... For this reason, they affirm, this rapid depopulation is occurring, witheven the smallest children dying\" (Montagner Melatti 1985:170). Among the Marubo,along with the Shipibo and Yaminahua, poison is much less frequently used thansorcery songs.If the Katukina accuse the Yawanahua of sorcery through songs, the Yawanahua holdthe Cashinahua responsible for the death of Antonio Luis, a famous warrior whoobtained many wives through raiding against his Pano enemies and in this way becamethe founding father of the actual Yawanahua community. The method of killing used bythe Cashinahua sorcerer was to add poison to the tobacco snuff of the great leader andshaman (Perez 1999:16).When Kensinger first arrived as a missionary among the Peruvian Cashinahua in the1950s, it was the medicine man, huni dauya, whom he feared as potential \"agent of thedevil\" and not the mukaya, the shaman (1995:225-27).5 Actually, Kensinger never knewa practicing mukaya, even if some Cashinahua would say today that in those days theystill existed. If they existed, the Cashinahua systematically denied it at the time, or onlywould admit that some used to have muka but lost it (Kensinger 1995:218).Still, with regard to the \"witch doctor\" whom Kensinger finally befriended after thelatter healed his infected foot with herbal medicine and with whom he ended upcollaborating in the field of healthcare, we read the following: \"I was expected to treatthe \"symptoms\" while he addressed his treatment to the \"cause(s),\" particularly wherehis diagnosis included supernatural agencies\" (1995:227).This statement is particularly important for my argument, although it goes against theidea that the dauya would treat natural causes of illness and the mukaya the supernaturalcauses (Kensinger 1995:214). Perez (1999) equally has called attention to the necessityof including healing with plant medicines in the field of shamanism, but he still defendsthe opposition be - tween illnesses with mechanical causes that are to be healed throughplant medicine, and illnesses caused by the intentional agency of yuxin beings, orsorcerers, to be healed through healing songs."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Many examples I collected (Lagrou 1991, 1998) of illnesses treated with herbalmedicine involve the treatment of those caused by spirit beings of the forest world:when a baby cries at night it is understood that a yuxin is attempting to abduct its soul,and thus herbs are burned to frighten the spirits away; when an adult has been caught byyuxin the treatment is herbal baths and medicine squeezed in the eyes (to treat the eyesoul); if the yuxin of game animals come, not to steal the wandering soul but totransform the body of their victim into one of them, once again humans use plants tocombat them.Let me illustrate my point with a case study I followed in my fieldwork. Six monthsbefore my arrival, six-year-old Philomena started to suffer from what seemed to me tobe epileptic attacks. The first hypothesis, given to me by her parents, was that kuxuka,the dolphin, had transformed into a handsome man and attempted to abduct her whenshe was alone by the river. She then fell in the water and almost drowned, but was savedby her father. That night she had her first fit. Eye drops, baths, and smoking, all ofwhich were deployed to ward off kuxuka, did not help her recover, and having observedseveral of the girl's fits, Augusto Pinheiro, the herbal doctor (dauya), decided that theproblem was the \"peccary child.\" Antonio Pinheiro, a middle - aged man who waslearning the art of healing with Augusto (his adoptive father and brother-in-law),described to me the phenomenology of the peccary child as follows: \"The peccary childbites its tongue and pushes us violently away, striking out randomly. Aah!, aai!, itscreams, foaming at the mouth and trembling. She caught this illness because herparents ate peccary while her mother was pregnant or maybe when she was nursing.\"Augusto prepared a mixture of ten plants, each of which had the name of a part of thepeccary's body (peccary hair, skin, testicles, ears, etc.) and told the parents to wash theirchild with it at night and in the morning. The problem eased and after several weeks theparents left the herbal doctor's house and returned to their village. A month later,however, the problem started again. Two possibilities were proposed: either the illnesswas not provoked by the peccary but by some other animal causing similar grimacesand spasms, or the parents were not observing the prescriptions of sexual continenceand fasting. Augusto was convinced that the parents had not kept the food and sextaboos during pregnancy or nursing, but he was equally sure that they were not able toobserve the taboos correctly during this time. Only when he was sure that they werekeeping their fast would he be able to cure the illness and exclude the other, moredangerous possibility of it being due to a capybara child. As Antonio stated, \"Thecapybara child's teeth chatter, xenx xenx, they bite. Without medicine you die\" (Amen"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"bakeira hawen xeta xenx xenx amiski hawen mestekina dauuma mawamiski).The naming of the illness, such as peccary child, capybara child, etc., as well as thediagnosis through observation of the bodily movements of the child who is unconsciousand possessed by the illness-causing agent, suggest strong evidence for exploring aninterpretation of illness as a dangerous and uncontrolled process of becoming other andnonhuman. The body mimics its invader in such a way that its human existence isplaced in danger. The yuxin could be taken away by the peccary to cause the body todie, or it is also possible that the whole person might disappear, as seems to havehappened to several youngsters in the villages of Peru who, I was told, got lost in theforest where they transformed into wild animals and never were seen again. Sad orangry people, unsatisfied with their relationships with close kin or spouses, are said tobe prone to hear yuxin callings at night, and then disappear as they \"sleep walk\" into theforest.This example clearly shows that herbal doctors (dauya) and their counterparts, poisonowners (dauya), do deal with the world of yuxin and not just with \"natural\" or\"mechanical\" causes, whatever these might be thought to mean for the Cashinahua.Matter is the vehicle of yuxin. Animals with a strong yuxin are not only killed butconsumed raw with the intent to communicate with the yuxin of their owner (as is thecase of the ritual killing of the boa and the oropendola bird I describe later on). Plantsubstancesfrom ayahuasca, tobacco, and dade to the manifold plant extracts squeezed inthe eyes-are used to alter perception; to see the world differently (a recurrent theme inPano mythology). And it is the same idea of increased power through materializationthat can be held responsible for the success of shamans who can visualize thepathogenic agents they extract from the bodies of their patients (Levi-Strauss 1974:205-26).The idea that poison is materialized yuxin is also manifest in the precautions taken bythe sorcerer, not only after killing when he is saturated with the blood of his victim,' butat the very moment of touching the poison. He who does not observe the diet and talkproperly to the poison at the time of touching it will die. Only he who knows how to talkto the poisonous plant will escape. Sometimes merely passing by a poisonous plant canbe lethal. According to Antonio: \"The poison to kill is red. When you pass it, you say, `Iknow you already,' and you keep going. You look at it from a distance. If you say, `Inever saw this medicine'; you die. Or if you touch it without knowing, you will reallyget ill. There is a plant medicine used by the dauya in order not to die when he touchespoisonous leaves.\""},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Like the vine and leaves of ayahuasca7-said to be the transformed body parts of thefirst man who learned to drink the brew with the snake peopleit is claimed thatpoisonous plants are the transformed body of the first sorcerer, an old woman namedYuxankudu. And that is the reason, explain the Cashinahua, why they \"have yuxin\" (aquality to be distinguished from \"to be yuxin\").The myth of origin of poisonous plants was told to me by Antonio in the followingway:Yuxankudu (the old grey woman) was the first one who knew how to use poison.She used to kill when she was desirous of human flesh; children, men, and womenalike she killed. One day Yuxankudu was sitting in a corner, counting pieces ofcharcoal. For each piece of charcoal she pronounced the name of her victim andthe reason for his or her death. A little girl, her granddaughter, was listening. Theold woman mentioned that she had gone to the riverbank to get clay for herpottery. She leaned forward so much that her thing, xebi (vagina), became visible.Her son-in-law saw it and took her with force. Then he fled away, but she turnedin time to see his back. She cried. At a small river she got poison with a conch,cooked it, and kept it with her. When she arrived home, she mixed the poison intothe food of her son-in-law. He got a high fever and diarrhea, and then he died.Thus went the story of the old woman. The girl went home and told the widow'swife what the old woman had done. His kin decided to kill her. The old womanheard them and fled. Tawaxeni- buxka, a blind man, got up from his hammockand told the victim's father where the old one had hidden. They went after her butshe kept running away. It was time to organize nixpupima (a rite of passage forgirls and boys) in her village. Thus the people went to her hiding place and toldher, \"Grandmother, there will be the party of your grandchild, come and baptizeyour namesake.\" And the old one went. One brother came jumping with a corncobstuck in his buttocks and she laughed. Then another brother appeared and hit herwith a club. She died. They burned her in the fire and from her blood grew poison.In the beginning everybody knew, but they forgot and now people know the leavesbut don't know how to touch it without dying.\"Another myth, collected by Capistrano de Abreu (1941119141:194-95), associates theorigin of poisonous plants with a great deluge, which meant the beginning of a newexistence. The sky fell to earth because the inhabitants of the sky cut down too manytrees. Everybody on earth died, only Macari and Maticiani survived, each clinging to ahigh tree. They married and had two children, Muru and Batan, the ancestors of the"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Cashinahua. Until that time illness did not exist. But poisonous leaves fell down toearth, rain soaked them, they putrefied and the wind stirred them up, dissipating illnesswhere it passed.What can be learned from this story is that the Cashinahua associate the origin ofillness with the existence of poisonous plants, much more so than they associate it withthe power of human thoughts, songs, and words. It is this source that sorcerers are saidto tap when they want to kill. The poison can affect its victims in various ways. Theconsumption of poisoned food causes violent vomiting, dizziness, high fever, andalmost immediate death. Sometimes the dark shaman attacks his victims directly,scratching their foreheads with the long nail of his right thumb. He hides his poisonunder the nail of the thumb of his right hand as well as inside his bamboo earrings,which are capped with wax or resin.But poison can also act without direct contact with the victim's body. Thus a poisonedarrow flying over the victim's head or a poisonous leaf burned over a fire are believed tocause death. The smoke, carried by the wind, can cause deadly dysentery and fever,killing whole villages. People take considerable care to dispose of and bury excrement,hiding it from eyes with potentially evil intent. Otherwise a dauya might find it, mix itwith poison and cook it in a banana leaf over a fire. If this happens, a person will firstfeel a terrible headache around midnight, and will then be afflicted by a deadly diarrheaand start vomiting uncontrollably.The young Budu, Capistrano's informant (1941 [19141:150-54), had known a dauyathat had been killed because he was accused of putting poison in the excrement of theson of Budu's namesake. Also, the sudden death of his own mother had been attributedto an old dauya. As in the previous case, revenge had been taken on the supposedsorcerer. The old man lived in the same house as Budu's mother and she died shortlyafter an incident in which she had been laughing with her kin and the old man feltoffended, thinking they were laughing at him because he was thin. He became veryangry. When Budu's mother went to the river to take a bath, he followed her and putpoison in her skirt. On her way back she started to feel the pain, and she died the samenight. Because he was considered to be the only dauya, \"man with medicine,\" in thelonghouse, the old man was killed and burned.Antonio reported to me in detail the same procedure of hiding poison in the woman'sskirt. At night the woman first feels a headache, then starts vomiting and risks death thesame night. When a sorcerer has recently killed someone, Antonio explained, he dyes"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"his hands black with genipapo and the whites of his eyes become red (he is \"full of,\" orcontaminated by, the blood of his victim). The dauya is, in Antonio's words, a furiousperson with no sense of humor: \"If you make fun of his bald head, because dauya arealways bald, if you think it's funny, he puts poison on you. If you are stingy [yauxi] withhim, he puts poison on you. If you refused to have sex with him, he puts poison on you.If you were stingy with me [he gives here a mischievous smile] I could poison you. Ifyou scolded me, I could poison you, if I were a dauya. A dauya never eats meat and doesnot smell any perfume. When he kills someone he spends a month without talking toanybody. He cannot touch a woman. I do not want to know about dau, I do not want todie.\"From the following description we can see that we are dealing with a phenomenologytypical of sorcery accusations. The description of the character of the sorcerer is apersonification of antisocial behavior and power abuse, a kind of man who would neverbe tolerated in a village. Among the Krah6, who are Timbira-speakers of the state ofMaranhao, the figure of the sorcerer serves the same role of antithesis of socialbehavior, contrasting with the generosity of the village head. His sorcery is thecrystallization of social retention and lack of reciprocity, and serves therefore as ametaphor for death itself (Carneiro da Cunha 1978:12-17). On the other hand, amongthe Cashinahua, not all deaths imply revenge and the search for someone to be accused.Sorcery accusations appear only as an explanation for sudden, unexplained deaths ofhealthy and strong people. When Budu's mother died, her yuda baka (body soul)appeared to her kin people and revealed the identity of her murderer (Capistrano 1941[1914]:143).Only once did I hear about suspicions that an old man might be preparing himself toput his knowledge of poisonous plants into practice. This happened not in the context ofa sudden and unexplained death calling for revenge but rather in the context of a villagefission, in a tense and conflictive atmosphere. During an ayahuasca session, the villagehead's son had a vision in which the father of the leader of the separatists wanted topoison him. This vision worried the boy's close kinsmen seriously, but once thesecessionists left and left the village in peace, the fear and animosity calmed downagain. This episode is another illustration of the fact that, for the Cashinahua, it is thedauya and not the mukaya who more clearly represents the figure of the dark shaman,ready to emerge in accusations during episodes of conflict.In the village of Fronteira, an incident between government representatives and themourning widow and brothers of a young healthy woman who was about to give birth"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"but died suddenly could be understood in the same terms of sorcery suspicions arisingin situations of sudden loss and tense social relations. The pregnant woman had aheadache and was subsequently medicated by her brother-in-law, who had access to thevillage pharmacy in the absence of the nurse. He gave her a whole tablet of painkillersand an injection of unidentified content, and she died immediately of what seemed to bea brain hemorrhage. When her husband arrived home the same day and was informed ofthe tragedy, all the men involved in the accident got drunk to cope with the situation.At that moment a delegation of two government representatives from FUNAI whowere working with indigenous peoples arrived at the village. The drunken widow, hisbrother, and his brothers-in-law approached the two men, asking them for explanationsof the following paradox: why had the doctor and nurses of a vaccination campaign amonth before decided only to vaccinate pregnant women? Was it a campaign toexterminate the Indians? Was the woman who had died that day the first of a series ofvictims to come? How did they explain this coincidence, which seemed to be theconfirmation of a rumor that had been circulating on the Purus River ever since thedoctor and nurses had visited all the villages, vaccinating only pregnant women? Thegovernment representatives had no answer to the villagers' angry questions, and theyhad to spend the night hiding in the governmentowned radio house in the village toprotect themselves from the mourners who threatened revenge. Only the next day, wheneveryone was sober again and the anger had subsided somewhat were the governmentofficials able to leave their hiding place and begin negotiating with the mourningcommunity.This incident follows the same logic of traditional sorcery accusations: the nurses hadapplied their dau in the powerful form of injections (which penetrate the skin asmagical darts) on healthy people and, worse, on pregnant women. People weresuspicious and now the suspicions had been confirmed: the injections were starting toshow their lethal effect. At this moment, as though to confirm the interpretation, thegovernment representatives arrived and were threatened by the mourners. The eventalso shows another important aspect of Cashinahua experiences with illness aftercontact: the cause of illness may come from the outside much more frequently thanfrom the inside.Mukaya: At the Top of an IcebergAs mentioned above, dark shamans or sorcerers -people who cause harm to their ownkin-appear more often in Cashinahua discourse in the form of dauya \"poison users\" than"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"in that of specialists who talk to other beings, yuxin, loosely translated as spirits. Thusfor the Cashinahua the more one can materialize harmful energy, the more effective itbecomes. The dauya acts or is supposed to act at the limit between the visible andinvisible use of violence, at the limit between the use of material and immaterial meansof inflicting harm. The mukaya goes one step further on the path of dominating andvisualizing invisible power. And we will see that other techniques, in which materialsubstances are used to invoke invisible powers, can be placed somewhere in between thedomains of the dauya and the mukaya, and are used and known by the majority of adultmen and women.Whereas among the Culina, shamanism expresses the quintessence of masculinity-with the accumulation of duri, the shamanic substance, the result of a successfulconcentration and domestication of youthful male desire (Pollock 1992:25-40) -amongthe Cashinahua hunting and shamanism, at least in its restricted mukaya version, aredealt with as logical opposites (Kensinger 1974, 1995; Deshayes 1992). The first sign ofa man's calling to become a mukaya is his failure to kill animals, not because theyescape him but because they talk to him. Thus what characterizes the mukaya amongthe Cashinahua is his extraordinary capacity of communication with other beings, atechnique that can easily be used to cause harm to other human beings because it is theyuxin who control and cause illness and death.Not only for men is the call of muka (the bitter shamanic substance) considered to becounterproductive in terms of gender performance, but it is also dangerous to womenbecause women with muka are said to become compulsive wanderers.' Duringpregnancy, the interference of yuxin produces deformations in the child's body, which iswhy exceptional births, like babies with six fingers or a closed ear, are called yuxinbake (spirit's children) (Lagrou 1998:47, 69-74).This incompatibility of dominant male and female roles with the requirements andrestraints put on a mukaya may be one of the more important reasons for its lowpopularity among Cashinahua men and women, while among the Culina almost everyadult male is said to have some duri. Thus, among the Cashinahua there are manytestimonies of men and women being called by the yuxin, yet almost none of thesecallings is answered in a positive way. When someone has been caught by the yuxin -aprocess described in terms of a violent assault and combat resulting in the victim'sfainting (\"dying\"), followed by the planting by the yuxin of muka in his or her heart -thevictim will look for the mukaya's alter ego, the dauya (medicine man), who willprescribe or treat him or her with herbal baths or, in extreme cases, make them eat"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"rotten fish or meat in order to keep the yuxin away.It is important to point out once again the method used by the Cashinahua to defendthemselves against incursions of the yuxin. The yuxin represent nonhuman beings; theyare characterized by their alterity with respect to what most strongly defines humanidentity. Humans have their agency, perception, and cognition (in the form of manifoldsouls) embedded in a fixed and solid body that has been molded by close kin livingtogether. This thinking body has strong emotional roots embedded in memories ofcaring. Yuxin beings, to the contrary, are wandering beings with no roots and no fixedform; they belong to a realm mostly invisible to human beings, and although they arenot immaterial their relation with matter is one of fluidity and transformation, not oneof solidity. For the Cashinahua the most effective way to keep away these floatingbeings and images of change and alterity is to make them invisible, sealing off the bodywith smoke, painting, protective baths, and food-that which most clearly defines theconstitution of a living human body.I only know of one woman, Delsa, who acknowledged that she was a follower of thepath of a shaman. She did not claim to have muka and was therefore called a yuxian(someone who lives with yuxin) instead of a mukaya, but her prayers had the power toheal thanks to her spiritual snake husband, Yube Xeni. Delsa, the first of two wives ofthe leader of the village Fronteira, became a yuxian following a frightening experiencein one of the most dangerous places of otherness known to the Cashinahua: the hospital.The story she told me goes as follows. While pregnant with her last child, she was intown accompanying her husband. When she was about to deliver, the doctors wanted tooperate on her in order to sterilize her. They were acting in accordance with the wishesof her husband. Delsa, however, refused vehemently. She said that if she herself nolonger wanted to bear children, she could use her own methods to achieve this. InCashinahua society it is women and not men who control fertility.Thus, with the threat of control being taken from her while in the hospital and about todeliver, Delsa \"went crazy.\" She screamed and punched, not allowing the doctors to getaway with sterilization. During her fit, Delsa also had visions. It seems that the hospital,the place where people go to die, has a large quantity of yuxin wandering around. Aftera certain period of time, later back in the village, she learned to gain control over hervisions.Delsa started first of all to receive the visits and teachings of her deceased father, whohad also been a yuxian (shaman), and later on she \"married\" Yube Xeni (the snake"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"yuxin). From that moment Yube Xeni came to make love to her at night, and because ofher new yuxin husband Delsa said she no longer had sex with her human husband. Oneof the signs of her alliance with the world of yuxin was her deformed mouth-people saythe yuxin are eating her mouth away-while another sign is her successful healing offever in small children.Although Delsa is a yuxian and not a mukaya, she does share some of the mukaya'scharacteristics: for example, both are chosen by yuxin and their conviviality impliesboth sexual abstinence and sexual alliance with yuxin beings.' Delsa's initiation startedat the moment she was at the end of her period of fertility and thus would not interferewith gender-specific sensibilities and the production of human beings. Her initiationthrough visions and dreams with a deceased kinsperson, in this case her father who hadalso been a shaman (yuxian) and who decided to transmit his power to her, as well asher sexual union with the powerful snake Yube Xeni, shaman par excellence, showsobvious similarities with the initiation of other Panoan song healers and shamans,especially among the Katukina (Lima 2000:134- 43). However, no materialization ofspiritual power had been involved in Delsa's case and no mention was made of herpowers to produce illness.The mukaya, on the other hand, belong to a category of shamans, famous inAmerindian ethnographic literature, characterized by their ability to materialize thespiritual power harnessed inside the shaman's body, which may cause harm or killvictims from a distance. The imagery involved resembles that of warrior's shootinginvisible arrows or darts to equally invisible enemies. The healing powers of this kindof shaman invariably involve the power of making visible harmful objects that havebeen extracted by sucking them out of the victim's body. Anthropologists and theirPanoan interlocutors alike tend to attribute the quality of shaman (translated as paje) toonly this kind of practitioner.It is difficult to know who was responsible for making this phenomenology a kind ofparadigm of shamanism, whether it was the anthropologist looking for the `real' shamanor an indigenous tendency to establish a hierarchy of powers dealing with the invisible.The fact is that some Panoan groups affirm never to have had such shamans (pajes)-such as the Yawanahua (Perez 1ggg:11o), Yaminahua (Townsley 1988; Calavia 1995),Shara- nahua (Siskind 1973:43), and Cashibo (Frank 1994; Perez 1999:114), whileothers affirm that they do or did, such as the Marubo (Montagner Melatti 1985:401),Shipibo (Illius 1992), Katukina (Lima 2000:128-29), and Cashinahua."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"It is interesting to note that the Panoan groups given above that claim never to havehad shamans capable of extracting and sending bewitching substances are exactly thegroups where another version of shamanism, manifest in the use of bewitching andhealing songs, is very much alive (Perez 1999:114). Still, among the Marubo andKatukina, who do or did have their version of the mukaya-which they called romeya(\"the one with tobacco,\" a tobacco materialized in the same way as muka, a bitter andmagical substance in the body) -song healers and sorcerers nevertheless do play a veryimportant role. While Lima (2000:128) calls attention to the reproduction of a dualismof shamans among the Katukina who value their (deceased) romeya (real shaman) overtheir song healers (rezador, shoitiya, or koshoitiya) because the latter do not have thepower to heal sorcery, Perez (1999:110-14) stresses the fact that the Yawanahua neverused this kind of dualism. All shamans are said to be capable of gradually accumulatingdifferent kinds of powers, those of plant healers (niipuya) along with those of the xinaya(song healers), and, at the top of the ladder, the yuvehu (plural of the important entityyuve) or tsimuya, the one with bitterness, who is characterized by his power toincorporate spirits. The Yawanahua do, however, distinguish clearly between illnesseshealed with plant medicine and others healed through magical songs, in a much moreradical way, it should be said, than do the Cashinahua themselves.Further reflection on other interesting similarities and differences between Panoangroups is beyond the scope of this essay, but some provisory conclusions can be drawnnevertheless. One fact that stands out regarding the variety in Panoan sorcery andhealing methods is that the dauya among the Cashinahua might be seen to be to themukaya what specialists in healing and bewitching songs are to the mukaya's equivalentin other Panoan groups. In other words, if almost everywhere the supposedly \"real\"shaman, the one Panoans share with their neighbors, tends to disappear, thosespecialists most strongly feared as sorcerers remain: among the Katukina, Yaminahua,and Yawanahua they act through bewitching songs, while among the Cashinahua theyact through poison.If the power of sorcery found shelter in other techniques that seem always to havecoexisted with the technique of sending darts, what then would have been lost with theabsence of a mukaya, labeled as the only \"real\" shaman? One strong attribute of themukaya was his capacity to call and communicate with yuxin spirit beings at free will.It is, therefore, the privilege of communication with the spirit world that has been lostwith the figure of the mukaya. In another work (Lagrou 1998) I have shown how thiscommunication and the perception of yuxin is diffused throughout everyday life. If we"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"use the capacity of this kind of communication as a criterion to define the shaman, wewould be once again in the position to affirm with the Kagwahiv that almost \"everyone... has a bit of a shaman\" (Kracke, 1987).Almost all of the techniques that have recently been described for the Katukina (Lima2000) and especially for the Yawanahua (1999) as characterizing different trajectoriesand initiation methods to become song healers (in Portuguese, rezadores) whose songshave both the power to kill and to heal, I have registered as isolated techniques used byadult men and women in private or collective rituals with the intention to enter intocontact with yuxin beings and their powers (Lagrou 1991, 1998).Thus there are the different rituals involving the killing of a boa (yube xeni) and theconsumption of different parts of its body by men and by women, separately, to obtainluck in men's hunting expeditions, or to enhance a woman's intelligence in the learningof designs or to obtain fertility or control it (Lagrou 1991, 1996). The same ritual,however, can also be realized with the intention to bewitch someone by means of theyuxin of the boa. All old men, I was told, know how to kill by speaking to the yuxin ofthe boa, because they ate its heart. In this way they have become like yube himself, andtheir words have power. A list of the names of men who per formed the ritual,accompanied by a long period of fasting and abstinence, would follow this speech withthe yuxin. Interestingly enough, these ritual performances would not give rise, amongthe Cashinahua, to special roles and statuses; this was, my interlocutors would say,something all old people knew and had done several times in their life. Although theirblowing and songs were considered to be powerful and extremely dangerous, these menwere not called healers (Lagrou 1998). It is interesting to note that among the Katukinathis same encounter with the boa or anaconda, without killing or consuming it, impliesthe beginning of an initiation process in the arts both of song healing and of shamanism.The encounter produces dizziness in the hunter and can be completed with thetransference of rome (a shamanic substance of which the anaconda is the owner) (Lima2000:132-38).Another Cashinahua private ritual that is practiced in the woods is part of a sequenceof initiation rituals of which, preferentially, every adult should have taken part at leastonce in his or her life. I refer here to the ritual consumption of different parts (leaves,stem, root) of a plant called dade. I never witnessed such a ritual, however, and itscontent is surrounded by mystery. Dade is administered to small children to strengthenthem and enhance their concentration. Women take the plant to get pregnant or,conversely, as a temporary contraconceptive (Lagrou 1998:72). In the case of"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"contraception, the ritual is performed before menstruation. The consumption of dade isfollowed by some months of strict dieting, and its effect and consequences are said tobe equivalent to those of the ritual killing and consumption of the boa. The acquisitionof the capacity of communication with yuxin is one of the possible consequences of theencounter with dade. Thus it is the use of a substance, a practice in which the dauya isspecialized, that will give extraordinary power to a person's words, a practicetraditionally ascribed to the mukaya.In one of my conversations with Cashinahua villagers, we discussed the danger andpower of twins, whose words were said to have the power to kill because of their statusas spirit children (yuxin bake, yubebu) conceived through intercourse with the spirit ofthe boa. To emphasize their strength, twins were compared to dade: \"When one [of thetwins] dies, you cannot tell the other, otherwise the other also dies. He is like yube xeni[boa]. He has the power of kuxuka [the dolphin]. He is like dade.\" This same dade issaid by the Yawanahua to be a hallucinogen used in the initiation of song healers andshamans (Perez 1999:18).Finally, there is the ritual use of ayahuasca, which is another example of how muchthe world of plants is imbued with yuxin agency and how much this agency is prone tomaterialize in plants. It is this relation between energy and substance that approachesthe two kinds of specialists one working with substances and the other with words-insuch a way that they can only in theory be considered to be mutually exclusive.Song healers among the Shipibo, Marubo, Yawanahua, and Katukina all make use ofayahuasca in their healing rituals. In some cases, such as the Shipibo, Katukina, andMarubo, the patient is present at the healing sessions, while in others the patient isabsent, such as among the Yawanahua where prayers are sung over a cup of manioc beerthat will be offered to the patient who is asleep at home in his hammock (Perez1999:115). During these healing rituals, however, the healer does not use the drinkalone.In contrast with many other reports on the ritual intake of ayahuasca, the Cashinahuado not restrain from meat or fish at dinner before taking the brew. They say that if theowner of the ingested animal appears in a vision, something that is considered almostinevitable, they will deal with him through song. It seems almost as though they eat theanimal to see its yuxin in a vision. Ayahuasca can be taken by all adult men andadolescents, and in some cases by women. I witnessed only one woman taking the brew;she was from another village and was accompanied by her husband. Elderly people tend"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"not to take ayahuasca, alleging they are already too tired and that their eye soul (beduyuxin) has already learned how to dream?°Ayahuasca is taken with the intent to get information about distant places and theirbeings, the hiding places of game, the real intentions of opponents in conflicts, themotives of visitors, future events, and illness-causing agents. It is also an event wheresorcery can be used, and thus the Cashinahua of the villages where I worked (CanaRecreio, Moema, Nova Alianca) were wary of taking part in the ayahuasca ritual oftheir more distant kin and neighbors in the village of Fronteira, who were famous forputting sorcery in the brew through their strong thoughts and songs. Two or threespecialists of the vine were considered to be especially dangerous in this sense, and, inthe eyes of their relatives living in villages nearby, they could be dark shamans.As with all other methods of dealing with the world of yuxin, the ritual intake ofayahuasca has two sides-it can either heal or inflict illness, depending on how it is used.Although I did not witness any healing session with ayahuasca, one session wasdescribed to me by Antonio Pinheiro in the following terms: \"When the vine brew isprepared, the patient is called to come close. You ignite the lamp. You tie up hishammock, and then you tie up yours. You sit very close to him. Then you drink the vineand when you are drunk, you sing, sing, sing, and sing until you find his illness. If theyput poison, they will discover it. If they put something else, illness, you discover it.Then you tell him on the spot, if he will be all right, you tell him, `you will be all right,friend,' or whoever, right? Or father, brother, uncle, of any kind, you tell him: `you willbe all right.' If he will die, you tell him also, `ah, I think you will not escape. There is noway.' In this case the people cry. You would feel sorry, wouldn't you?\"Induced by my questions, Antonio explained that if the cause were muka it wouldhave to be sucked out, but only if it had not yet spread out, because in that case thevictim would invariably die. A close look at this description of a healing session withayahuasca shows us that, more than about healing itself, Antonio is speaking about theuse of this ritual to help the healer to discover the cause. Kensinger (1995:211)mentions this same possibility for a mukaya to use nixi pae (ayahuasca) to acquire moreinformation, a new song, or the indication of another plant.Other Cashinahua, however, were emphatic in stressing that what defines a mukaya isexactly his ability to discover the truth about illness or future events by means of hisdirect intercourse and communication with yuxin, without having to resort to the help ofayahuasca or any other substance. It should be noted, though, that if all of these"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"instruments and means to induce trance states do not identify the mukaya's practicesand capacities (because his power resides in not needing any psychotropic substance)they will have an important role in the process of initiation and preparation (Kensinger,1995:211). Other methods used by someone wanting to become a mukaya include veryintensive dreaming and solitary walks in the forest with the intention of being caught byyuxin. During the seizure the yuxin will plant their substance in the shaman's body.Regarding the use of substances by the mukaya to enter a trance state, an exceptionshould be made for tobacco snuff (dume). Romeya, the equivalent of the Cashinahuaterm dumeya (\"the one with tobacco\"), indicates among the Marubo and Katukina aspecialist with attributes very similar to those of the mukaya: he can call spirits at will,and he has a magic substance in his body that he can materialize in the form ofshamanic objects and then send to victims in the form of invisible darts. He can alsosuck out the same kind of objects from the bodies of his patients. The name of the bittersubstance that has been introduced into his body by the spirits (yuxin or yove) is rome:tobacco. The link is intrinsic. The Cashinahua also have a myth about a very powerfulshaman with the strength to conquer all the powerful monsters inhabiting the paths thatseparate the houses of his kin. This shaman, whose name is Dume Kuin Teneni (tene,real tobacco, a dumeya), has a body smell so bitter that each time he takes a bath thefish die as if by poison.Tobacco snuff is not, however, a privilege held for shamans. Common men can usetobacco snuff to help concentrate on hunting, or they can use it in combination withayahuasca in order to clear their vision. Yet, when prepared in a special way, tobacco isthe quintessential healing substance. According to Antonio: \"Pure tobacco, we use toheal illness. It is a mixture of, in our language, ashes of xiun, yapa, and biunx. Thewhite man calls them murici, manixi, and yande. These really strong ashes are mixedwith the tobacco powder. If you have illness in your body, any kind of illness, and painin your bones, you sniff tobacco powder, get drunk, and you can cure. You pass yourspittle on the person and spread it out over his body.\"Tobacco helps the mukaya to enter a trance state and take off in search of the lost soulof an ailing child. As Antonio further states:When a child is ill, it cries all the time. It cries. The one that is calling is her soul.Her mother calls, Huwe! [Come!] The child is sleeping. It is her soul that iscrying from far away. When it arrives, the child wakes up immediately. Thus themukaya sniffs the tobacco powder to get drunk, to be able to find her, right? He"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"goes to the forest, to try to find her soul in the cemetery, or else, just in the forest.Sometimes he stays for hours in the forest trying to find her. He returns from theforest with achiote from the souls, genipa from the souls, smoked meat from thesouls, beads from the souls. He also brings with him a parrot's young, bawa bake,an orange-winged parrot's young, txede bake, and a parakeet, pitsu. Sometimesalso a monkey's young. He brings them at the spot, together with the child's souland accompanied by many souls. The mukaya playing flute and the souls, yuxin,all decorated as in the katxanawa ritual. Then the mukaya does the following: Atthis point Antonio passes his hands under his armpits, rubs his hands, puts themtogether in the form of a horn and blows in the supposed patient's fist. Afterwardhe blows on its heart, on the front and on the back. Finally he blows on the feetand on the knees. Then he continues with the mukaya's words.... Always saying,`heneai mi peai!' [let go, you are all right]. He turns her face, the `dead' child'sface. Then she starts to move, her body is warming up, her heart is beating, sheopens her eyes and says: `I was sleeping.'This detailed description of the recovery of a soul by a mukaya shows Antonio'sprofound familiarity with the scene, although the Cashinahua say they have not seenpracticing mukayas since the 195os. Antonio, himself a modest healer (rezador),confessed to me his desire to become a mukaya, but his second family was too youngand his wife was against it. For a mukaya the prohibition to eat any kind of sweet foodor meat is not limited to periods of initiation or practicing but rather holds for the timehe wants to keep the muka in his body. As soon as the diet is violated, the mukadisappears. Not only can a mukaya not eat meat, he is also not allowed by the yuxin tokill game. Yet another severe restriction, difficult to combine with everyday life, is theprohibition of sexual intercourse.The Initiation of a mukayaSources agree on the fact that the mukaya gets his knowledge and power from thespirit beings and not from men. This was what Capistrano's young informant told him inthe beginning of the century: \"It was the yuxin who taught the huni kuin who got theirmuka from the yuxin\" (1941 [1914]:161). Kensinger states: \"The shaman learns his artfrom the spirit beings who give him his muka\" and that \"any person, male or female,with a propensity for dreaming may become a shaman\" (1995:217). And Antonioaffirms the state - ment with details: \"A mukaya does not need to be deku (dexterous),nor unan (intelligent, learned), because it is the yuxin who acts. Yuxin heals throughhim. Muka is yuxin acting in his body. It is in this way that he learns with the spirits.\""},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"The same idea seems to hold for the Katukina (Lima 2000:143) and is accepted as apossibility among the Shipibo-Conibo and Marubo,1' who all share the kind of shamanmost closely related to the mukaya of the Cashinahua. Other Panoans (Lima 2000) andespecially the Yawanahua (Perez 1999) would not conceive of this possibility ofinitiation without human masters. It is important, however, to recall at this point thatthe kind of specialist discussed here is absent among those groups that stress theinitiation of healers over their election by the yuxin themselves.12 It should be noted,however, among the Yaminahua of the Purus River (Townsley 1993) as well as theYawanahua that healing and sorcery songs are composed of mythic themes. To be ahealer among the Yawanahua means therefore to possess a solid knowledge of thismythical universe, a knowledge only obtained through initiation by another xinaya (theone with knowledge).At this point it is necessary to invoke the existence of a third important figure amongCashinahua specialists. This figure, who is called the txana ibu (\"the song leader\"; alsotranslated as owner of the oropendola birds) is said to xinan haidaki-that is, \"to know alot\" (note the similarity of this term with that for \"healer\" among the Yawanahua;xinaya). The importance of the presence of a song leader for the well-being of a villagecannot be stressed enough (see Lagrou 1998; see also Kensinger 1995, McCallum,1989). The song leader is responsible for the performance of prophylactic songs at allimportant public rituals and private rites of passage; for example, at the end of theseclusion of a newborn child, where in that case the song leader sings for protectionwhile passing the genipa paint onto the child.I call attention to the importance of the song leader because he seems to me to be themissing link to understanding the apparent contradictions between the existing data onCashinahua shamanism and the new information that has recently become available forother Panoan groups, thus constituting a continuum of shamanistic practices wherepreviously much less was known. Although no explicit healing powers are attributed tothe txana ibu's function, it nonetheless comes very close to the healing specialistsdescribed by Perez, Lima, and Montagner Melatti for other Panoan groups. Txana ibuundergoes a long period of training under the guidance of a master song leader. Hissongs are necessary to invoke the benevolence of all yuxin beings that underlie theabundance, fertility, and well-being of everyday life. His songs also intend to make theyuxin beings happy (benimai pakadin), and his help is invoked when unpretentiousprayers or blowing is required. I use the word unpretentious because I never saw any ofthese \"knowledgeable men\" claim recognition for a successful healing. The only help"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"requested was for him to pass some of his strength and knowledge onto a weak personthrough massage with his own sweat. The txana ibu is a kind of instructed adult who hasexperienced several initiation rituals associated among other Panoan groups withshamanic power: the ritual killing and consumption of a boa, of dade, of ayahuasca andtobacco snuff, and of pepper (in this case from the beak of an oropendola bird, in orderto obtain an infallible memory as part of his consecration as new song leader).This is not to say that the song leader of the Cashinahua is equivalent to thehealers/shamans of the Yaminahua, Yawanahua, Katukina, and others. Much to thecontrary, the differences are as important as any similaritiesfirst because the txana ibuare not considered to be healers and, second, because their power does not seem to havea dark side. The txana ibu does not claim knowledge of bewitching songs. Yet if hisritual songs are performed wrongly, the results for the community can be disastrous.Also there is the specialization of the txana ibu that is systematically combined withthat of dauya, the specialist in plant medicine. And it is because in the case of illnessthe txana ibu's prayers and silent songs are always accompanied by herbal medicine thatthis side of his activity in the field of healing has been left in a shadow. KnowledgeableCashinahua men are not famous for their power of healing and killing through song -only the prophylactic and propitiating purpose of their praxis is stressed-but they arefamous for their knowledge of poison. This is why, in my view, the dark side ofshamanism among the Cashinahua is to be found in the use of poison, a practice forwhich the transmission of knowledge by a master is indispensable. Thus a specializationbetween Panoan groups seems to exist, where some stress their knowledge of the powerof songs and words while others are famous for their control over the power of lethalsubstances.Let us return here to the different forms of initiation of a mukaya. In situations ofemotional vulnerability, an individual can be caught by the yuxin. This is one way ofobtaining the shamanic substance muka. Accidents of this kind are not exceptional, andseveral of them were told to me. In all cases, however, kin people intervened withherbal baths and plant medicine squeezed in the eyes to interrupt the victim'sacquaintance with the world of yuxin and to make them stop dreaming (Lagrou1991:32-44). But a person can also actively look for an encounter and alliance withyuxin beings. Such an individual will become listless, wander alone in the forest, andcome back without game. A young Cashinahua, Osair Sia, described an initiation byyuxin to me in the following terms: \"A shaman [paje] can give life and take it away. Tobecome a shaman, you go alone into the forest and decorate your body with bark and"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"palm leaves. You lie down on a crossroads with arms and legs spread out. First comethe nightly butterflies, called husu, covering your whole body. Than come the yuxineating the husu until they touch your head. You embrace them with all your force. Theyuxin become transformed into a murmuru palm tree, full of thorns. If you are strongenough and do not let go, the palm tree will transform into a snake that coils itselfaround your body. You hold on; it transforms into a jaguar. You go on holding it in yourgrip and thus it goes until you are holding nothing. You succeeded in the test and go onto explain to the yuxin you want to receive muka. The yuxin will give it to you.\"Antonio described to me the transference of the muka substance itself: \"Then, theysay that when he `dies,' the soul puts, he plants, sempa, you know. We call it sempa[resin] in our language.\" I then asked him, \"What kind of a mixture is sempa?\" Hereplied, \"It is a mixture of sempa and muka. He is going to plant muka in his heart.When he plants muka and sempa and tamakana, they say that when it is big, when it isgrowing, it starts to whistle. The soul [yuxin] in his heart whistles, whistles until it isgrown up and big. People say: `this man does not want to eat meat any more,' becausehe has sempa, the meat will turn into sempa.\"A very similar account, with the addition of more-precise details, can be extractedfrom the eyewitness story from the early lgoos of Capistrano's young informant: \"Whenthe yuxin gave muka, they went to get dau; they made a pagoca, like a pill, of dau; theymade a little ball, put it in his whole body, a small ball of dau in his body; in his body tobecome a mukaya\" (1941 [1914]:161).13 We learn from this text that the material usedby the yuxin to materialize their power in the initiate's body is called dau, plantmedicine. Thus we can conclude that the one who has medicine incorporated in his ownbody, the bitter medicine of the yuxin, muka, does not need to use medicine any more.He is medicine and poison himself.Capistrano's informant also claimed to have seen the muka of a shaman, calledYawabiti, he had known as a child: \"When he [the mukaya Yawabiti] showed them hismuka, I saw it. The muka were a small ball of poison (dau), a small piece of a knife, heshowed them a small wood splinter, he showed a bead; I saw everything.\" And heconcludes: \"Nobody would have the cour age to scold Yawabiti, the mukaya. If theywould scold him, he would throw muka on them and they would die if Yawabiti threwmuka on them\" (163). The richness of detail here leaves no doubt that the mukaya wasonce a shaman of flesh and blood. Yet when accusations of sorcery appear, also withrespect to the past, as in the rich documentation gathered by Capistrano, the target issystematically a dauya and not a mukaya."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"We can organize the different causes of illness in Cashinahua etiology following thewords of Capistrano's informant Budu: \"A Cashinahua can die from illness or frompoison\" (140). Illness can be due to all kinds of causes: the revenge of yuxin in the caseof transgressions of food taboos or when people invade a yuxin's territory; attacks bythe souls of the dead who throw muka on their victims or kidnap their soul; long-lastingillnesses that don't kill but cannot be healed either, causing a clearly localized pain inthe stomach, heart, or chest, attributed to an attack with duri by the Culina (this kind ofillness needs to be healed by foreign shamans); and, finally, illnesses, such as headacheand intestinal parasites, considered to have been originated at the beginning of time .14Illnesses accompanied by strong diarrhea and vomiting that cause a sudden andunexplained death, on the other hand, are not real illnesses but rather have a sorcerer astheir cause. These are illnesses for which there has never been a cure, the Cashinahuasay, not even when there still were mukayas around. This kind of death has only oneanswer: the sorcerer is killed and burned. People still fear the older generation for theirknowledge of poisonous plants, but no records following those written down byCapistrano have registered the accusation and execution of a sorcerer during this lastcentury.ConclusionI hope to have shown here how Cashinahua discourse and practice related to the darkside of shamanism partakes of a thought system characterized by a dynamic dualismwhere identity depends on the inclusion and incorporation of alterity and where selfpartakes of the identity of other. This thought system does not separate soul from matteror energy from substance. When harm is inflicted on human beings, the possibility ofthe agency of a dark shaman is invoked. Panoan literature shows two methods ofinflicting harm from a distance. The first is one that depends on the use of words andsongs; it is a method intended to make yuxin beings act in accordance with the wishesof the bewitching agent, and is manifest to the Cashinahua in the figure of the mukaya.The second method, embodied in the figure of the dauya, depends on the use ofsubstances that can or cannot be put into direct contact with the victim's body. Whereasother Panoan groups have been shown to specialize in the first cluster of techniques, theCashinahua clearly consider themselves to be more efficacious in the latter. People whodon't claim a specialist's role, on the other hand, do use a rich variety of techniques todeal with yuxin beings with the intent to cause prophylactic or lethal effects on theirown lives or that of other human beings, showing through daily practice that everyone\"has a bit of a shaman\" and that matter is as much imbued with yuxin agency as the"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"words and songs of shamans.Notes1 See especially Perez 1999 on the Yawanahua, and Montagner Melatti 1985 on theMarubo.2 It should be noted that the difference in question is not one between healer andsorcerer, as seems to be the case among Peru's Arawak-speaking Matsingenka whodistinguish terminologically between the healing shaman (seripi'gari) and the sorcerer(matsika'nari) (Baer 1992:87). The Panoan Shipibo of the same region, on the otherhand, clearly state that it is of the nature of the shamanic healing act itself that \"toremove nihue [the illness causing agent] from a sick body\" means \"to cast it onanother living being who doesn't possess enough xinan [knowledge, power] to repulseit. Thus, in curing one, he is always bewitching another\" (Illius 1992:75-76). Thissituation results from the fact that the shaman cannot destroy the substance. Alsoamong the Arawak-speaking Kulina, traditional neighbors of the Cashinahua inBrazil, shaman's and sorcerer's roles are linked. \"The shaman's role in illness is notlimited to the treatment of the dori [illness-causing agent]. He also identifies theenemy shaman who is presumed to have caused the illness, normally (with nonfatalillnesses) a shaman from another village\" (Pollock 1992:32). Shamans and sorcerersare not distinguished terminologically: both are dzupinahe. Their antisocial aspect istranslated as bruxo (witch) and feitigaria (sorcery) (Pollock 1992:39).3 This characteristic approximates the Cashinahua to other Panoan relatives, like theMatis (Erikson 1996). Erikson called attention to the fact that among Panoans the roleof the shaman is a temporary and delicate matter and is much less stressed andinstitutionalized than among many other Amazonian groups (Erikson 1986: 196, 205),although the data of Townsley (1988, 1993) for the Peruvian Yaminahua of the PurusRiver; Illius (1992) on the Shipibo-Conibo; and Montagner Melatti (1985) for theMarubo do not seem to confirm this hypothesis. Among the Matis (Erikson 1996 andn.d.) no specialists in the use of \"bitter substance\" have survived the trauma of contactwith Western society. The class of bitter substances includes ayahuasca, tobaccosnuff, toad poison, and the shamanic bitter substance muka. The author argues thatafter contact, and after the loss of most people in the older generation, nobody feltstrong enough to handle these dangerous substances. Therefore, the Matis seemed tohave specialists only in the domain of sweet (bata) substances. The Matis argued thatthey were all \"children,\" having lost their old ones, \"those who know.\" But thissituation is seen as transitory by the Matis themselves who seem to have reintroduced"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"the ethnically important but \"bitter\" and dangerous practice of tattooing, as well asthe use of toad poison. This happened after Erikson's last visit in 1982.4 Capistrano de Abreu is a well-known Brazilian historian of the late nineteenth andearly twentieth century, who is famous for establishing the basis of a new approach tothe history of Brazil. Alongside his brilliant career as historian, Capistrano devotedmany years to the study of the language and mythology of the Bacairi of Mato Grossoand the Cashinahua of Acre. Capistrano worked with two Cashinahua informants athis house in Rio de Janeiro, where he compiled what was until recently the mostcomplete collection of myths transcribed in vernacular language, with interlineartranscription and literal translation.5 Kensinger befriended the headman because he cured him, but he became the \"witchdoctor's\" rival: \"I suspect that my distrust of him was greater than his distrust of me;after all, I thought he was the devil's agent\" (1995:225). He adds, \"My missionarycolleague objected that accepting treatment from the witch doctor would be to dabblewith the Devil's medicine\" (227).6 To be impregnated with the blood of one's victim is a very widespread idea amongAmazonian people (see Albert 1985, for the Yanomami; Viveiros de Castro 1986, forthe Tupi), and it has also been noted for the Panoans by Erikson (1986).7 Ayahuasca is a strong hallucinogenic brew widely used in the region. The basicingredient of ayahuasca is the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. Different groups in theregion use a variety of plants to enhance the effects of the vine, but most frequentlyused is a leaf from the Psychotria viridis tree, which is considered to be responsiblefor the vivid visions produced by the brew. This leaf is the only addition to the vineused by the Cashinahua. For a description of its chemical composition and ritualsetting, see Der Manderosian et al. 1970:7-14.8 According to Antonio: \"M. P. almost learned it. We would not let her because she is awoman. When someone has muka, she wanders around everywhere. She was walkingaround like crazy with the spirits. We took hold of her and put the plant yuxin nemaniin her eyes. If she would see spirits again, we would bath her with tuduan. And if shewould continue, we would give her rotten fish.\"9 This \"mystical marriage,\" however, is not as clear for the mukaya as it is for someother Panoan groups, as among the Katukina (Lima 2000:138), the Marubo(Montagner Melatti 1985:409-10), and the Shipibo-Conibo (Saladin d'Anglure andMorin, 1998:60). Yet it should be seen as no accident that the myth of origin of the"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"use of ayahuasca among the Cashinahua, said to be experienced by every noviceintroduced to the experience of the hallucinogenic brew, is about exactly the sametheme of mystical marriage with the snake woman-a member of the snake peoplewho own the brew. Ayahuasca is one of the substances used on a regular basis byalmost all Panoan novices in the arts of shamanism, although in some groups, asamong the Cashinahua, its use is not restricted to apprentices of shamanism.in Where the Peruvian Cashinahua tend to distinguish between a dream soul (namayuxin) and the eye soul (bedu yuxin) (Kensinger 1995; Deshayes 2000), theCashinahua from the Purus River on the Brazilian side of the border consider eye anddream soul to be one and the same (Lagrou 1991, 1998; McCallum 1989).11 Arevalo Valera 1986:152; Montagner Melatti 1985:416; also Lima 2000:143.12 Yaminawa (Townsley 1988; Calavia Saez 1995); Sharanawa (Siskind 1973a), alsoLima 20oo; and Yawanawa (Perez 1999).13 The transcription in Cahinahua has been adapted to actual linguistic standards andthe interlineal translation in Portuguese. The English translation is mine.14 Deshayes (2000:30-31) calls this last kind of illnesses \"memory illnesses\" becauseits origin is situated in mythic times. Thus the origin of headache could be found inthe myth of the jaguar mother-in-law who used to eat her grandchildren. Her sonkills her and burns her body; a piece of burning wood touches his forehead andcauses the first headache. The myth of origin of intestinal parasites, an example Icollected, explains that intestinal parasites came about as a result of the sexualintercourse of a woman with a giant earthworm. Furthermore, when the woman's newhusband, the jaguar, was cleaning and thus healing her, she did not wait until the endof the ritual, and therefore people will always have intestinal parasites.ReferencesAlbert, Bruce. 1985. \"Temps du sang, temps des cendres: Representation de la maladie,sys- teme rituel et espace politique chez les Yanomami du sud-est(Amazoniebresilienne).\" Ph.D. diss., University of Paris-X (Nanterre).Arevalo Valera, G. 1986. \"El ayahuasca y el curandero Shipibo-Conibo del Ucayali(Peru).\" America Indigena 46 (1): 147-61.Baer, G. 1992. \"The One Intoxicated by Tobacco: Matsigenka Shamanism.\" In Portals"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"of Power: Shamanism in South America, ed.

Until very recently, however, the consensusopinion was that Peruvian Arawaks had abandoned these practices around the 197os as aresult of the mass conversion to Evangelism, Adventism and Catholicism, the rapidexpansion of formal education and health services, and greater integration into a marketeconomy. Confirming evidence of this opinion came from the fact that no actual casesof child witchcraft were reported in the literature after 1970.2 It thus came as a surprisewhen, in the mid-lggos, several anthropologists and other professionals working withPeruvian Arawak communities involved in an armed struggle against the communistorganization Shining Path and the Tdpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA)began to report that accusations of child witchcraft had resurfaced?Most of this information was passed on by word of mouth among specialists workingwith these Arawak groups. It was (and still is) believed that if child witchcraft becamepublic it would only reinforce existing prejudices about the \"savagery\" of Amazonianindigenous peoples. Similarly, the first (and until now the only) written references onthe reemergence of this phenomenon were succinct and very cautiously worded (seeFabian Arias 1994:297, 1995:165; Fabian Arias and Espinosa de Rivero 1997:62). Evenserious international organizations working directly with or assessing the situation ofthe Ashaninka in past years, such as UNICEF-Peru, Made- cins sans Frontieres, and theUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights, do not mention this practice in theirpublic documents.

It is thus with great trepidation that I have decided towrite this essay, and I do so with the conviction that it would be worse if this topic wereto be exploited by sensationalist journalists. In an insightful essay on the creation ofnew cultural \"traditions\" by the Tukano of the Vaupes River basin, jean Jackson askedthe sensitive and very pressing question: \"Is there a way to talk about making culturewithout making enemies?\" (1989:127). The challenge for me, as well as for all of thecontributors to this volume, is to find ways of talking about cultural practices that areodious to Western sensitivity without either making enemies out of those who practicethem or providing their enemies with arguments to deny them their rights."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"In a previous essay I inquired into the possible origins of the belief in child sorceryamong Peruvian Arawaks (Santos-Granero 2002). I argued there that the historicalsources lacked all evidence suggesting that Peruvian Arawaks believed in childwitchcraft in contact times or during the colonial era. And I proposed that this belieforiginated in the attempt by Peruvian Arawaks to appropriate mimetically the mysticalpowers that missionaries attributed to St. Christopher and the Christ child in preventingplagues and epidemics. In this essay, I explore the sociological rather than theontological aspects of the practice of child sorcery.Native Beliefs and RationaleThe first reference to Peruvian Arawak child sorcery appeared in 188o in a report byFranciscan missionary Bernardino Gonzalez on his sojourn among the Yanesha. In thereport he asserts that natives believe that illnesses and deaths are the result ofwitchcraft, and that they even attribute these afflictions to their own children andclosest relatives (see Izaguirre 1922-29: vol. 10, 400). A decade later in 1893, FatherGabriel Sala (1975:438- 39) expanded on these beliefs, offering a detailed descriptionof the plight of Yanesha child witches. Later, French diplomat and traveler OlivierOrdinaire, in an account of his 1885 trip from Peru to France through the Amazon,stated that the Ashaninka and Asheninka believe that child sorcerers are responsible formany diseases. Franciscan missionary Tomas Hernandez reported similar beliefs in1896 among the Nomatsiguenga of the Pangoa Valley. Whereas early accounts providea more or less detailed depiction of the external or visible aspects of the practicessurrounding child sorcery, they say very little about the rationale behind them. How dochildren become sorcerers? Why and how do they bewitch people? Why is it necessaryto torture them? Why do accused children accept their fate without resistance? Why,instead of defending them, do their relatives join in the ritual torture and execution?And why are child witches killed and their bodies disposed of in such cruel ways? Toanswer these questions I shall resort to the scant and fragmentary literature on thesubject, complementing it with my own field data on the Yanesha.The Ashaninka and Asheninka believe that child sorcerers (matsi, maci, or machi) areinitiated in the art of witchcraft during their sleep (Weiss 1975:292). In their dreams,they are visited by any of a number of demonic teachers (kamari maci) who are underthe orders of Korioshpiri, the \"father\" or \"ruler\" of all demons. These demonic teachers,which include birds (cuckoos, nocturnal swallows), insects (grasshoppers, crickets), andthe souls of other live or dead human sorcerers, appear to the sleeping child under"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"human guise (Tessmann 1999:51; Weiss 1975:292). The evil spirits of the dead(shiretzi) are also reported as possible teachers of witchcraft (Rojas Zolezzi 1994:239).The visiting demons place animal or fish bones, palm-leaf slivers, or other smallobjects in the child's palm, and then knock them off so that they will get buried in theground. Once buried, these objects cause somebody to fall ill. Demonic teachers urgethe child to bewitch someone, likening victims to edible forest animals. They also givethem human flesh to eat so that they develop a taste for it. After repeated visitationsfrom demonic teachers, the targeted children begin to dream that they themselves burythese pathogenic objects. With the passage of time, they lose their human nature andbecome demonic witches.The Nomatsiguenga also believe that children may learn witchcraft from a number ofdemonic teachers, particularly various kinds of birds (Shaver and Dodd 1990:103).Among the Yanesha, it is believed that a child becomes a sorcerer (amasenet) whenanother adult or child sorcerer rubs her or him with a special plant (Smith 1977:103), orwhen children paint each other with the juice of the flower of the ranquech tree (speciesnot identified). These substances penetrate into the child's heart, endowing him or herwith evil powers. If a shaman does not treat the affected children by sucking thesesubstances out of their bodies, they will inevitably lose their humanity and becomedemonic sorcerers. I was told that children could also become sorcerers if asenac, thecurved-billed hummingbird, flies over them. This bird is considered to be an assistantof Yosoper, the chthonic ruler and master of all demonic beings, and thus it plays animportant role in the dissemination of evil (Santos-Granero 1991: 113-14). In addition,both the Yanesha and Ashaninka believe that children can learn sorcery directly fromactive children sorcerers.What persons are most likely to become, or be accused of having become, matsi oramasenet? Among the Palcazu and Pichis Ashaninka, the accused were adult women orgirls and only very rarely a boy (Ordinaire 1988:93; Elick 1970:212). Other sourcesclaim that both girls and boys could be accused of being sorcerers, although more oftenthan not the accused were little girls (Perez Marcio 1953:166; Brown and Fernandez1991:152). This is also true for the Pajonal Ashaninka (Rett Bragg, personalcommunication). In general, sources on the Ashaninka and Ashaninka coincide in thatthe accused was \"the most defenseless member of the community, usually a girl child,especially if it is an orphan or captive taken in a raid\" (Weiss 1975:292; see alsoPalomino Arana et al. 1936:513; Uriarte 1982:211). Orphan children accused of sorcerywere generally fatherless rather than mother less (Navarro 1924:24). Among adults, the"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"most vulnerable to accusations of sorcery were women who did not have husbands todefend them (Navarro 1924:24; Torre Lopez 1966:64; Weiss 1975:292).Among the Yanesha, the accused were mostly \"orphans, widows and des- titutes\"(Batlle 1905:248). One early source states that shamans generally blamed someone\"weak and powerless, some poor orphan, who has nobody to defend him or look afterhim\" (Navarro 1967:395). Sources on the Yanesha are not consistent as to genderpreferences among children accused of sorcery: some suggest that boys and girls wereequally accused (Sala 1975 [18931:438); others that men, women, and children could beaccused, but that more often than not the accused was a girl child (Smith 1977:103-4;Bullon Paucar 1976:152). I was told that both girls and boys could be accused, and thesame was reported for the Nomatsiguenga (Shaver and Dodd 1990:103).Bad-tempered, sulky children were primary targets for accusations of sorcery.Children who were disobedient or disrespectful of adults were also suspected ofwitchcraft. The same happened, however, with children who stood out because of theirpleasantness or sagaciousness (Sala, 1975 [18931:438). In all these cases the commontheme is that these children do not behave as children are expected to do. Although themarked tendency is for children devoid of kinship relations (orphans, war captives) tobe accused, one of the most astonishing aspects of Peruvian Arawak child sorcery is thatquite often the accused children are close relatives of their victims and even membersof their extended households, including biological and classificatory children, siblingsand spouses (see Stahl 1932:36; Torre Lopez 1966:64; Weiss 1975:294; Shaver andDodd 1990:103).Child witches may, for a certain time, be unconscious of their evil powers, and thusact as such unknowingly. However, most sources suggest that once children induced tolearn sorcery become conscious of their powers, they use them purposefully. This isespecially true when they become older. It is important to note in this regard that adultwomen and men accused of sorcery \"are understood to have been witches sincechildhood who somehow escaped detection\" (Weiss 1975:292). In other words, althoughthey are adults they fall within the category of child sorcerers. It is also important tokeep in mind that child sorcerers-whether actual children or adults-are considered to bedifferent from \"professional\" sorcerers who have become so during their training asshamans 4Child sorcerers who are still unconscious of their evil powers give vent to them whenthey become angry with someone. Once conscious of their powers, they can put them to"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"work by reflecting angrily on their victim. For both the Ashaninka and the Yanesha,anger, especially when expressed openly and violently toward a relative, is a dangerousfeeling; it not only disturbs the balance of power but it also leads to witchcraft (Elick1970:213; Smith 1977:104; Santos-Granero 1991:101). When child witches are angry atsomeone, they instruct their demonic helpers to gather bodily secretions (mucus, hair,fingernails), scraps of leftover food (animal and fish bones, manioc fibers, chewed cocaleaves), or other objects that have been in close contact with the victim (chonta-woodsplinters, palm-leaf slivers, thorns, and more recently plastic bags, fishing lines, nails,bottlecaps, broken glass, or small pieces of metal), and bury them in the floor of thevictim's house. Child sorcerers may also visit the house of their victims to rob a scrapof food refuse from them or search clandestinely among the garbage surrounding thehouse to gather a bit of leftover food (Tessmann 1999:51).The Ashaninka and Asheninka insist that the objects excavated by accused children\"are not simply discarded refuse, but rather are found tied or wrapped in a leaf, orotherwise showing evidence of being especially prepared\" (Weiss 1975:293). Childwitches ritually manipulate and bury these objects. Through notions of \"contagiousmagic\" (Frazer 1996:13) the buried objects are thought to enter into the body of thevictims and make them ill. Also, the soul of child sorcerers can visit the victim while heor she is asleep and thrust the prepared charm into the victim's body (Tessmann1999:51). These actions may be accompanied by singing and other ritual operations.Child sorcerers can also direct their \"death wish\" to cause a poisonous snake to strikethe victim (Tessmann 1999: 51; Elick 1970:213).When someone falls ill, the patient's relatives resort to a friendly shaman (seripiari, orsheripiari among the Ashaninka in general; pa'llerr among the Yanesha) to cure him orher. Shamans use a variety of techniques to cure patients, including blowing tobaccosmoke over the victims' bodies and sucking from their bodies the pathogenic objectsthat a variety of nonhuman agents (ants, termites, wasps, stone or salt spirits, demons,and erring shadows) might have introduced into them. If this therapy does not work itindicates that the illness is the product of human witchcraft, so shamans strive toidentify the person responsible for sending the evil charm. They do this throughdivination, consultation with their mystical helpers in dreams and astral voyages, orinterpretation of their patients' dreams (Elick 1970:214; Weiss 1975:293; Santos-Granero 1991:103-21). If the child witch belongs to the victim's household, they grabher or him immediately; if not, the victim's kinsmen or warriors designated by theacting shaman assail the household of the person identified as a witch and bring her or"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"him to the patient's house (Elick 1970:214; Stahl 1932:35).Once the child witch has been detained he or she is subjected to harsh punishments.Such punishments have two objectives: first, to force child sorcerers to reveal wherethey have hidden the evil charms that have made the patient ill, and, second, to makethem cry, because it is believed that by crying they will forget the evil arts they havelearned (Weiss 1975:293; Rojas Zolezzi 1994:240). To achieve this hot peppers may berubbed into their eyes, or they may be hung upside down over a smoking fire or tied ona smoking rack (Sala 1975 [1983]: 438; Eichenberger 1966:122; Shaver and Dodd1990:103). Accused children are also confined to an attic above a smoking fire in orderto make them cry, thus preventing their demonic teachers from finding and helpingthem. In addition, accused children are starved because they are believed to feedmystically on human flesh (Weiss 1975:293). From time to time the confined childrenare forced to search for the pathogenic objects they have purportedly buried, diggingthem out with a stick. While they do this they are beaten with sticks or vines, whippedwith stinging nettles, or submerged in water until they almost drown (Torre Lopez1966:64; Weiss 1975:293; Shaver and Dodd 1990:103). Peruvian Arawaks believe thatchild sorcerers \"are invincible in the face of death, and ... that tortures cannot kill them\"(Shaver and Dodd 1990:103). It is precisely because child sorcerers are considered to beno longer human, in fact, that they are tortured in ways that would otherwise beregarded as extremely cruel.Accused children generally submit without resistance to the demands of theiraccusers, a fact that has puzzled missionaries and scholars alike. This submission seemsto be linked to the widespread belief that child sorcerers may, at least for a while, not beconscious of the powers they possess. In such cases, children accused of being sorcerersdo not protest their innocence, for they feel \"that the accusation itself constitutes proofthat [they] must be what they say\" (Elick 1970:214). In fact, neither the intentionality orlack of intentionality of alleged child sorcerers is important; both accusers and accusedbelieve that child sorcerers are under the control of maleficent forces (Torre Lopez1966:64-65). If accused children do not offer resistance, as is often the case, it isbecause after repeated accusations they come to believe (and to dream) that they aresorcerers.The life histories I collected of Yanesha men accused of being sorcerers when theywere children indicate that, generally, accused children had already been singled out aspotential sorcerers and had a record of minor accusations. Indeed, Yanesha shamans(pa'Ilerr) and priestly leaders (cor- nesha') held periodic cleansing rituals for children"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"who showed signs (such as hot temper, gloominess, disobedience, and disrespect) ofhaving been introduced into the arts of witchcraft. These rituals included confinement,ingestion of tobacco concentrate and other herbal concoctions to induce vomiting,special diets based on cold, boiled, and saltless foods, vigils, sexual abstinence, andcleansing of the evil substances that turned them into witches.Equally puzzling is the fact that parents of accused children rarely try to defend them;they can even turn against them with unusual fury. I would argue that this is in partassociated with the ideology of kinship. Bewitching someone from another lineage orextended household is a very grave misdemeanor that puts at risk the delicate balance ofsolidarities that hold together the different households composing a given settlement.But bewitching someone from one's own extended household, let alone one's ownparents, is an even graver offense. If the transgressors dared to breach the norm ofsolidarity among close kin it means that they are, doubtless, under demonic control(Torre Lopez 1966:64). Parents whose children are accused of bewitching someonefrom another extended family might try to defend him or her, but if the social pressureis too strong and they persist, they risk being killed themselves (Perez Marcio1953:168). In contrast, parents whose children are accused of bewitching them or aclose relative often reacted violently against the accused.If the victim improves, the accused child is beaten, ritually cleansed, and released. Ifthe victim dies, the child witch is invariably condemned to death (Stahl 1932:36). Thetype of execution depends on the wishes of the victims, their relatives, and the actingshamans. Child sorcerers can be bludgeoned (Sala 1975 [18931:439), garroted(Ordinaire 1988 [1885):93; Stahl 1932:36), drowned (Perez Marcio 1953:168), stoned(Bullon Paucar 1976:70), shot with arrows, or burned alive (Navarro 1967:395;Izaguirre 1922-29: vol. 12, 114). They can also be buried head first and face down intoan armadillo hole (Weiss 1975: 293), left in the forest tied to a tree to be devoured byjaguars, or covered with honey and tied up naked to a tree close to an anthill (PerezMarcio 1953:168). The corpses of dead children witches are generally burned and/ordisposed of by throwing them into a river.These extremely cruel and otherwise unusual forms of execution and body disposalare intended, first, to prevent the demonic teachers of the dead children sorcerers torevive them, and, second, to prevent the \"shadow soul\" of the dead child witch fromstaying in the area and teaching the art of witchcraft to other children. If the bodies ofexecuted child witches were simply to be thrown into the bush, their mystical helperscould breathe life into them again (Weiss 1975:435). Their souls would join those of"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"their demonic teachers, becoming one of them and eventually teaching other childrenthe art of sorcery (Weiss 1975:293,437). To destroy children witches in body and soul,the Ashaninka not only burned and disposed of their bodies, but also destroyed andburned all their belongings (Uriarte 1982 [19381:212).Sources describe the execution of child sorcerers as carried out in the midst of a grandnocturnal celebration -in which large amounts of manioc beer is consumed-that isorganized by the relatives of the deceased and the shaman who had treated him or her(Izaguirre 1922-29: vol. 12, 114; Navarro 1967:395; Palomino Arana et al. 1936:513).The objectives of these celebra tions are not clear, and the only source that discusses thesubject asserts that they celebrate \"the death of the innocent [child accused of sorcery],and that of the person who died\" (Uriarte 1982:211). In other words, they seemsimultaneously to have the traits of a funerary ritual in honor of the deceased and of acleansing ritual on behalf of the community.Child witches blamed for the death of a person were not always killed. As a result ofincreased missionary influence and state presence, beginning in the 1920s somePeruvian Arawaks began to hand over accused child sorcerers to white and Mestizocolonists or to traders in exchange for manufactured goods, such as cloth, pots,machetes, and shotguns (Weiss 1975:293; Brown and Fernandez 1991:152). Althoughthis custom saved many lives, it also led to an active trade in children who were treatedby their owners as servants and slaves (Palomino Arana et al. 1936:513). To saveaccused children sorcerers from being executed or sold as slaves, Catholic andAdventist missionaries also became involved in this trade (Gridilla 1942:67; PerezMarcio 1953:175).Situating Child SorceryMost information on Peruvian Arawak child sorcery is generic; very few actual casesof child sorcery are reported in the literature and those few are quite sketchy. A reviewof these cases is indispensable, however, to situate this practice in social time andspace. I present here three of the most detailed and reliable cases reported in theliterature, together with a discussion on the historical circumstances in which each tookplace. As we shall see, most of these cases took place in contexts of external pressure,violence, epidemics, social disruption, and collective movements of resistance orevasion, often with messianic overtones.Case 1: Maria Josefa Leon, Nomatsiguenga girl of Pangoa, 1896."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"In 1896, Domingo, the brother of Churihuanti, chief of the Nomatsiguengasettlement of Pangoa, died of severe stomach pains. The local shaman was calledinto identify the witch that was responsible for his death. He blamed MariaJosefa, a fatherless nine-yearold girl, and condemned her to be shot with arrowsor burned alive. After passing this sentence, the relatives of the dead manorganized a ritual drinking celebration. At night, while they were celebrating,Maria Josefa managed to untie herself and escape. She took refuge in the house ofa Chinese man who had settled in the colony that had grown around theneighboring Franciscan mission. Alerted of Maria Josefa's escape, Churihuantiand his followers pursued her. However, the Chinese colonist took the girl to themissionaries, who, in turn, turned her over to colony authorities. Three timesChurihuanti, his relatives, and followers went to the colony to demand that thegirl be returned to them or that the missionaries kill her. But each time theirdemands were rejected. This generated great resentment among the local natives.(Reported by Franciscan missionary Bernardino Izaguirre [1922-29: vol. 12, 114-40])Two years before these events took place the Franciscans had founded a mission andcolony close to the Nomatsiguenga settlement of Pangoa (Izaguirre 1922-29: vol. 12,111-50). By then the Nomatsiguenga knew that, coming from the west, the white men(viracochas) had occupied most of the Chanchamayo and Chorobamba valleys,displacing the Asheninka and Yanesha from their lands; destroying the native ironworksthat had functioned since the Spanish were expelled from the region in 1742; takingover the salt mines of the famous Cerro de la Sal; and even removing the remains ofJuan Santos Atahuallpa, the charismatic leader of the 1742 uprising, from his tomb andshrine in the uplands of Metraro. They also knew that, from the east, white rubberextractors and their native allies were carrying out raids against the Asheninka,Asheninka, and Yanesha to procure women and children in order to transform them intosexual slaves, domestic servants, and peons. Nonetheless, the craving for iron tools,firearms, and the mystical powers that had allowed the whites to create, or usurp all thefine things the natives possessed led Churihuanti, the settlement chief, to welcome themissionaries and the fifty Andean families that came with them to cultivate coca, sugarcane, and tropical fruits.Peace between natives and foreigners lasted a short time. In 1895, the missionariesreprimanded Churihuanti and his people for killing and robbing an Irish miner who hadentered the area with the aim of looking for gold. This engendered much resentment"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"among Churihuanti's supporters, who from then onward began to harass the colonists byentering into their houses without invitation, stealing their possessions, and eating theirfood. The sudden death of Churihuanti's brother in early 1896 took place in this contextof deep antagonism. The missionaries' decision to protect Maria Josefa, the allegedwitch, from Churihuanti made matters even worse.By then, the loyalties of the Nomatsiguenga were divided. The majority supported theaggrieved Churihuanti and his relatives; but a few families sided with the Franciscans.In subsequent weeks tensions mounted, and new conflicts arose between the localNomatsiguenga and the foreign colonists. Some conflicts ended in killings. Churihuantiattempted to persuade the Nomatsiguenga families loyal to the missionaries to join him,but to no avail. As a result, Churihuanti threatened to kill them and their alien friends.After gathering a party of two hundred warriors from the Perene, Ubiriqui, Yurinaki,and upper Tambo river valleys, Churihuanti attacked the missionaries and settlers, whotogether with a group of loyal Nomatsiguenga families had taken refuge in the missionhouse. The local shaman extended his mystical protection over the confederates,assuring them that the bullets of the foreigners would not injure them; they only had toblow in their direction to turn them into leaves. Although many indigenous warriorswere killed in the confrontations that followed, the native alliance defeated theforeigners, forcing them to abandon the region. The fleeing missionaries took MariaJosefa with them.The case of Maria Josefa was not isolated. Late-nineteenth-century sources are full ofreports of children accused of being sorcerers. In 1893, Sala (1975 [18931:439)suggested that epidemics and the killing of child witches were driving the Yanesha toextinction. Carranza (1894:31) noted that the practice of accusing children of causingdisease through witchcraft was extensive among the Ashaninka. And Izaguirre (1922-29: vol. 12, 146, 158) recounts several instances in which Franciscan missionariesrescued children accused of sorcery among the Ashaninka and Ashaninka. Doubtless,then, the 18gos was a period when accusations of child sorcery were common.Case 2: Conija, Asheninka girl of Yurinaki, circa 1923.Around 1923, Comabe, an Ashaninka man living in the settlement of Yurinakion the confluence of the Yurinaki and Peren6 rivers, became ill. Comabe hadconverted to Adventism earlier that same year. When he fell sick, hisnonconverted neighbors called Chollaco, the local shaman, to determine who hadbewitched him. Chollaco went to Comabe's house and, after drinking manioc beer,"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"chewing coca leaves, consuming tobacco concentrate, and invoking his spirithelpers, he accused Conija, Comabe's daughter, of being the guilty witch.Chollaco appointed the girl's older brother to punish her and force her to unburythe evil charms that had made her father ill. Conija was separated from the rest ofthe family and locked in the attic, where she was starved and subjected to smoke.From time to time she was forced to go down and dig up the dirt floor with a knifein search for the charms she had allegedly buried to bewitch her father.Throughout these searches she was constantly beaten and insulted. This went onfor several days, but because her father increasingly got worse the shamancondemned her to death. By then Conija was extremely thin and weak. Herbrother took her to the riverside, bludgeoned her, and threw her body into theriver. Because Comabe still did not recover, the shaman repeated his detectionritual. This time he accused the sick man's wife. However, to avoid being tortured,Comabe's wife hanged herself. Shortly after, during one of his visits to Yurinak,Adventist missionary Ferdinand Stahl cured Comabe, and the latter returned tothe Adventist faith. (Reported by Adventist historian Alejandro Bullon Paucar[1976: g6-97])The 19206 was a period of great change and strain for the Yanesha and Asheninka ofthe upper Perene River Valley. In 1891, Peru granted British holders of Peruvian bondsone million hectares in this area. By 1920, the British-owned Perene colony had planted650 hectares of coffee along the left bank of the upper reaches of the Perene River, thusdisplacing many of the native families that lived there (Barclay 1989:112). Becauselocal natives were considered to be unreliable, the colony depended until 1922 onimmigrant Andean laborers (Barclay 1989:121). This situation began to change in 1922,when Adventist missionary Ferdinand Stahl obtained permission from the colony toestablish a mission in Metraro.Stahl was very successful in both attracting the Asheninka to the mission and inpersuading them to work for the colony (Barclay 1989:124). Part of his success was dueto the fact that the messianic and apocalyptic elements of Adventist discourse coincidedwith similar \"traditional\" Peruvian Arawak beliefs. The site Stahl chose for his missionenhanced even more the messianic appeal of his discourse. Metraro was the place whereJuan Santos Atahuallpa-the eighteenth-century messianic leader who, at the head of amultiethnic army, expelled the Spanish from the Selva Central regionestablished hisheadquarters. It was also the site where he was buried. His tomb, lodged in a largeceremonial building, had been the object of annual pilgrimages and celebrations until"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"1891, when his body was disinterred by Peruvian authorities and transferred to thehighland town of Tarma (Santos Granero 1992:256).By the time Stahl settled in Metraro, the Yanesha, Asheninka, and Asheninka wereexperiencing strong external pressures. European and Andean colonists had displacedmost of the native inhabitants from the valleys of Chanchamayo and Chorobamba andwere now advancing downriver along the Perene Valley. Further havoc had been causedfour years earlier in 1918 during the pandemics of influenza that swept the world. Allthese events were taken as signs of the impending end of the world, and Stahl'sapocalyptic preaching could have only confirmed this perception. Soon, the Asheninkaidentified the missionary as Pawa, the solar divinity, who had come to save them(Bullion Paucar 1976:74). The news that Pawa had arrived spread rapidly throughout theregion, frequently preceding Stahl himself.Stahl's presence and growing success generated conflicts with nonconverted localgroups. Sarate, the chief of a large Asheninka settlement close to the headquarters of thePerene colony and a man renowned for his brav ery, became a sworn enemy of Stahl,using his influence to hinder the latter's evangelical efforts (Stahl 1932:53; BullonPaucar 1976:72-74, 141-47). People in several other settlements were also firmlyopposed to his presence (Bullon Paucar 1976:83-85, 139). In fact, by curing Conija'sfather and persuading him and other settlement members to return to the Adventistfaith, Stahl and the converted families gained the enmity of Chollaco, the local shaman,and of his supporters (Bullon Paucar 1976:99-103, 180-81) (see fig. 1).Despite this opposition, by 1928 Stahl's fame and prophecies regarding Christ'ssecond coming and the imminence of the Last judgment had extended far beyond thearea in which he preached, generating a mass religious transformative movement that,according to Bodley, \"promised the total destruction of the White man and the return ofa messiah (1970:111). All along the Perene and Tambo rivers, as well as in parts ofPangoa and the Gran Pajonal, the Ashaninka and Ashaninka concentrated in largesettlements modeled after the mission at Metraro. They stopped using liquor andtobacco and believed that Christ's coming would end in a cataclysmic event duringwhich the earth would be burned and the unbelievers would diea notion that must haveintensified the conflict between converts and nonconverts (Bodley 1970:111).All these notions led to an increase in the accusations of child witchcraft, as becomesevident from reports by Adventist missionaries and historians (Stahl n.d., 1932;Herndon 1963:127-28). Franciscan missionaries operating in the region during this"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"period also noted this phenomenon (Navarro 1967:391, 394-95; Gridilla 1942:67). Infact, accusations of child sorcery reached such a point at this time that, in 1922, theCatholic Church founded the mission of Puerto Ocopa in the lower Perene River region,with the specific purpose of \"rescuing children and youngsters condemned to thissacrifice\" (Torre Lopez 1966:83; Ortiz 1978:208-8). By 1927, all thirty-five children inthe charge of the Franciscan nuns of Puerto Ocopa were orphans who had been boughtfrom their accusers (Gridilla 1942:67).Case 3: Oijani, Ashaninka girl of the Perene River, circa 1939.Around 1939 a man died in an Ashaninka settlement close to the Adventistmission of Sutziki on the Perene River. The local shaman identified Oijani, aseven-year-old girl, as the guilty witch. She was described as a beautiful girlwhose large, black eyes have a deep gaze that captivates-a sure sign, according tonative parameters, that she was a witch. The shaman determined that Oijanishould be executed the next day and her body burned. Her father accepted theshaman's verdict. Her mother did not but pretended she did, for she had decided toescape with her daughter to the neighbor ing Adventist mission of Sutziki. She didnot tell her plans to her husband because she was not sure that he would agreewith her. That night, Oijani and her mother escaped in a canoe toward Sutziki,seven hours distant downriver by canoe. Shortly after, someone realized that theyhad escaped and alerted the kinsmen of the dead man. Led by the shaman, a partyof forty men composed of the victim's relatives and other members of thesettlement went after them. The pursuers overtook the two women when theywere landing in the mission; they chased them but were intercepted by convertedmission Indians. This allowed the mother to reach the mission house, where sheentrusted Oijani to the care of the mission director (see fig. 2). The pursuersthreatened the director with convoking a general Indian uprising and setting themission on fire, but he did not give in, arguing that the child was now his. Aftertwo days of threats and negotiations, the pursuers left the mission promising theywould come back to fetch Oijani, but they never did. (Reported by Adventistteacher Manuel F. Perez Marcio [1953:168-75])"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"Figure 1. A photo of Chollaco, an Asheninka shaman of the settlement of Yurinaki,192os.

Eventually Chollaco also became Adventist.(Bullon Paucar 1976)Oijani's plight took place during one of the worse periods of Peruvian Arawak history;a period characterized by recurrent epidemics and the deaths of thousands of people.

In previous years Stahl's teachings had disseminated by word ofmouth throughout the Selva Central, generating a vast transformative movement thatwas beyond his control. Central to this movement was the spontaneous relocation inlarge settlements structured like the Adventist mission of Metraro. The most importantamong these was Las Cascadas, located on the upper Perene River (Bodley 1970:112).The high population density of these settlements favored the spread of measlesepidemics and other illnesses (Bodley 1970:115), and in 1928 hundreds of people diedalong the Perene Valley and adjacent areas -often, entire families were wiped out.Fearful of epidemics and disappointed because \"the anticipated transformation failed tooccur\" (Bodley 1970:114), followers of the movement deserted the messianicsettlements.Beginning in 1929, a new group of Adventist pastors founded three new missionsalong the Perene River, the largest of which was Sutziki, with the purpose of regroupingfamilies that had been attracted to the 1928 messianic movement (Perez Marcio1953:116; Barclay 1989:125). The prosperity of these missions, however, was short-lived. In 1933 the region was again struck by an epidemic of measles that in Sutzikikilled 120 out of the 300 inhabitants (Barclay 1989:126). The missionary of Sutzikireported that the Asheninka and Ashaninka believed that the epidemic had been broughtby the white men to wipe out the Indians (Barclay 1989:127). A medical doc torworking in the area at the time reported that the epidemic killed many adults, and thatfollowing indigenous practices this resulted in an explosive increase in accusations ofchild sorcery (Pinto, cited in Ortiz 1978:197).

They also threatened to attack the air base of San Ramon, built in1928, presumably because they believed that the white men had brought the disease byplane. The killing of child witches spread like fire throughout the region. Themissionary of Sutziki reported: \"As a consequence of the epidemic, groups of savageskill the sick and the unprotected infants they find along the river banks\" (Barclay1989:127).In 1937 new outbreaks of malaria affected the Chanchamayo Valley and the upperPeren6 region, resulting in extremely high mortality: 2,281 died in 1937 and 2,382 in1938 (Ortiz 1969: vol. 1, 543). Many of the deceased were native people. In Decemberof that same year a massive earthquake was felt throughout the entire region, causingmany deaths and injuring many people (Ortiz 1967: vol. 1, 450). This catastrophe wasfollowed by a new epidemic of measles in 1939 (Ortiz 1978: 196). The accusation ofOijani took place in this context. There is little information on the 1939 epidemic, butwe know that accusations of child sorcery increased as on previous occasions. Notsurprisingly, the Adventist mission of Sutziki and the Catholic mission of Puerto Ocopabecame, in the early 1940s, a refuge for numerous accused children, who became knownas los salvados de la muerte, or \"those saved from death\" (see fig. 3) (Perez Marcio1953: 175).Child Sorcery at PresentThe subject of present-day Peruvian Arawak child sorcery has been shrouded insilence, but a few cases have been reported by professionals working with PeruvianArawak communities and some have appeared into the national press. I have chosen thefollowing three cases because they depict very different situations. All took placeamong the Ashaninka of the Tambo River area, but it must be noted that the rise inaccusations of child witchcraft has also been reported among the Yanesha of thePalcazu basin, the Ashaninka of the Pichis and Satipo valleys, and the Ashaninka of theGran Pajonal uplands.'"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Figure 3.

The authorities handed over the boys tothe local rondo (Self-defense Committee), and the ronderos beat the children and theirparents. After doing so, they expelled the family from the community. (Compiled fromreports in Fabian Arias 1995:165; Fabian Arias and Espinosa de Rivero 1997:40; andBeatriz Fabian Arias, personal communication)Case 5: Silverio Paredes Imposhito, Ashaninka boy of M. [placename withheld], 2000.In October 15, 2000, Silverio Paredes Imposhito, a twelve-yearold Ashaninka boy ofthe native community of M., on the Tambo River, was found guilty of stealing 300 soles(approximately US$1oo) belonging to the community's health center. Silverio, hismother, his maternal grandfather, and his four younger siblings -each from a differentfather-had arrived in M. some years earlier, escaping from the violence that hadafflicted their community. The boy was very bright and always said that he wanted to goto high school once he finished elementary school. Since his arrival, however, there hadbeen several petty thefts. In three cases, the fatherless Silverio had been singled out asthe thief and punished accordingly. Because of his recurrent misdeeds, people began toregard him as a possible child sorcerer. In October 14, when it was found out that thecommunity's money was missing, the local authorities demanded in a public assemblythat whoever had stolen the money should return it. Next day 200 soles appeared in thehealth center. The authorities suspected Silverio, who, they found out, had given 12soles to a little boy, telling him that a third party had given him the money to deliver itto the little boy's mother. At dawn on October 16 the chief of the community, thelieutenant governor, and the health officer, together with the president and severalmembers of the local Self-defense Committee, captured Silverio. He was pressed toconfess. Because he refused, they tied him to a tree where there was a nest of tangaranastinging ants. Fifteen minutes later, Silverio confessed his crime, saying that he hadrobbed the money so as to be able to go to high school. The authorities untied him andtook him to his home, where he said he had hidden the remaining missing money. Butafter searching in vain, Silverio passed out and never regained consciousness. He diednext morning, on October 17. (Compiled from accounts in El Comercio, November 3-4,"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"2000; Expediente 2000; and oral sources)Case 6: Simon, Ashaninka man of S. [placename withheld], 2001.In 2001, Valerio, the chief of the community of S. on the Ene River, fell ill. Heimmediately suspected that the sorcerer responsible for his illness was hisneighbor, Simon, with whom he had recently quarreled over land issues. Theinhabitants of S. had asked the government to recognize their settlement as a\"native community\" and to provide them with communal land titles. Simon, whowas a \"displaced\" (desplazado) man from a community along the Tambo Rivervalley, opposed this move. He declared publicly that he did not want to \"live incommunity,\" thus prompting suspicions that he sympathized with Shining Path,which had taken a similar political stance against the government-sponsoredjuridical figure of comunidades nativas. In order to determine who had bewitchedhim, Valerio sought the services of the local shaman. The latter confirmed hissuspicions. He told him that Simon had made him ill by hiding an evil charm in atree hole. The chief's relatives then abducted Simon. They believed that theMinistry of Agriculture, which was reluctant to grant land titles to thecommunity, had persuaded Simon to bewitch the chief. They beat him and thensubmerged him in the river repeatedly to make him confess that this was the case.Because Simon did not confess, some proposed that they should kill him.However, to avoid reprisals from the police they decided instead to expel himfrom the community. (Reported by Santiago Concoricon, Ashaninka mayor of theRio Tambo district, personal communication)These three cases took place in the context of extreme violence created by severalforces: the insurgent activities of Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru RevolutionaryMovement, (MRTA), the counterinsurgent actions of police and military forces, and theillegal activities of powerful gangs of drug traffickers. Below, I offer an abridgedaccount of the situation in the Ene and Tambo river valleys, where the cases givenabove took place. It should be noted, however, that similar conditions have held duringthe past fifteen years in other areas inhabited by Peruvian Arawaks.The Communist Party of Peru, most commonly known as Shining Path, began itsmilitary activities in 1g8o in the highland department of Ayacucho. When in 1982 thepolice and, later on the army, began to put pressure on the insurgents in the Andes, theytook refuge in the Ashaninka territory along the Apurimac and Ene river valleys. Atfirst they used the region as a temporary refuge area. Later on, they decided to settle"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"more permanently and transform the region into a \"liberated zone\" where they couldtrain recruits and provision themselves, and from where they could attack strategictargets in the rest of the country. They found support among the Andean colonists whoin 1979 had begun to settle in these valleys, displacing the local Ashaninka populationfrom their lands.In 1983 Colombian drug dealers also entered the area and began recruiting Andeancolonists and local Ashaninka to cultivate coca. To put an end to the opposition by theFranciscan missionary of Cutivireni, drug traffickers burned down the mission,including its church, in 1984 (Gagnon 1993:81). Shining Path took advantage of thissituation and positioned itself as an intermediary between traffickers and localproducers. This strategy succeeded. By 1985, Shining Path had struck an alliance withlocal drug dealers to secure permanent funding and arms (Hvalkof 1994:24). That sameyear, both groups consolidated their hold over the area and closed navigation along theEne River. To increase their control, the insurgents forbade the local Ashaninka totravel to the nearby valley of Satipo to work in the coffee plantations; they also forbadethem to cultivate cash crops, such as coffee and fruit, and forced them to concentrate inthe production of food staples. This created much resentment in some Ashaninkacommunities, which saw their few sources of cash income disappear. In 1886, ShiningPath began to expand its activities to the Ashaninka settlements located along theTambo River.The modus operandi of Shining Path in the Ene/Tambo area was based on five steps:incursions to sack missions and projects promoted by nongovernmental organizations orrich merchants; indoctrination of the native population through community meetings;recruitment through persuasion or force of young men and children to train themideologically and militarily in \"popular schools\"; creation of dispersed military campscomposed of native militia and support personnel under orders of Shining Pathcommanders; and establishment of \"support bases\" and \"open popular committees\"grouping people from several military camps and native communities (Espinosa deRivero 1995:121).At first, the revolutionary political discourse put forth by Shining Path attracted manyAshaninka. By calling for the destruction of the exploitative \"old order\" and announcingthe advent of a more-just \"new order\" in which the Ashaninka were to become\"millionaires,\" the discourse by Shining Path shared many elements with nativemessianic myths-particularly with that announcing the return of Itomi Pawa, the son ofthe solar divinity, to this earth to bring justice and welfare to the Ashaninka (Rodriguez"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Vargas 1993:53). Members of Shining Path intentionally underlined these similaritiesand even adopted shamanistic practices reminiscent of previous nativist movements.Thus, for instance, native witnesses report that in Shining Path camps they were fedsoup containing scraps of metal, and that they were told that this would make themimpervious to the bullets of the army (Fabian Arias and Espinosa de Rivero 1997:34).Shining Path encouraged the dissolution of native communities (under the pretext thatthey were a remainder of the \"old state\") and their replacement by support bases. By1989, the movement had managed to create fiftyseven support bases, each composed oftwo hundred to three hundred people, organized in five open popular committees(Fabian Arias and Espinosa de Rivero 1997:33). Life in these bases was strictlystructured and disciplined. Shining Path columns were divided into \"leaders\" (mandos)and \"mass\" (masa). The leaders, mostly individuals of Andean descent, made alldecisions and determined what could or could not be done; the mass, composed mainlyof natives, was supposed to carry out unquestioningly subsistence and militaryactivities. Shining Path commissars distributed tasks, imposed schedules, organizedmeetings, and established vigilance turns. They ruled camp life under the model of\"three self-criticisms and fourth execution.\" Those who manifested discontent, dared todissent, or attempted to escape were punished; if they persisted, they were killed. As aresult of war, malnutrition, epidemics, suppression of dissenters, and political purges,many native people died in Shining Path camps (Espinosa de Rivero 1994:16-17).In 1989, the army began a large military offensive in Ayacucho against Shining Path.The insurgents retreated into the Ene and Tambo valleys. By then it had becomeapparent to Shining Path leaders that the Ashaninka were not natural allies and had littlerevolutionary potential. Thus, they escalated the forced recruitment of Ashaninka men,and increased suppression of those communities that were reluctant to cooperate. Tocrush all local opposition, Shining Path attacked the local Ashaninka federations - theOrganization Ashaninka del Rio Ene (OCARE) and the Central Ashaninka del RioTambo (CART) -which they had attempted, unsuccessfully, to infiltrate. In November1989, they killed three leaders of OCARE, including its long-time president, IsaiasCharete, and one of the victims was crucified.By 1990, Shining Path had achieved control of the whole Apurimac-Ene- Tambo riveraxis. As a consequence, fifty-one out of the sixty-six native communities that existed inthis area disappeared as such (Espinosa de Rivero 1994:4). By then, however, themovement's authoritarian ways had alienated the sympathies of most Ashaninka. In July1990, CART decided to organize its own self-defense forces. Shortly after, three of its"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"leaders were kidnapped and killed by Shining Path, marking the beginning of a generalTambo Ashaninka uprising. In only two months the Ashaninka managed to push theinsurgents upriver, beyond the community of Poyeni, which then became the boundarybetween the upper Tambo River, controlled by Shining Path, and the lower Tambo,controlled by the Ashaninka. The Tambo River communities agreed to contribute afixed monthly quota of men to the garrison of Poyeni to keep watch over the border andraid Shining Path camps to liberate their brethren.These actions were all carried out without intervention of the army. However, intaking advantage of the new situation the army established military bases from 1991 to1994 in the communities of Puerto Prado, Otika and Poyeni (Tambo River), Cutivireni,Valle Esmeralda and Kiteni (Ene River), and Puerto Ocopa (Perene River). From 1991onward, the Ashaninka selfdefense committees initiated a counteroffensive againstShining Path in coordination with the army. In three years, the Ashaninka self-defenseforces managed to liberate around four thousand of the ten thousand Ashaninka thatwere thought to be under the direct control of Shining Path (Fabian Arias and Espinosade Rivero 1997:31). By 1995, the \"displaced,\" \"recovered,\" or \"repentant\" (arrepentidos)Ashaninka population increased to around eight thousand.Most displaced Ashaninka sought refuge in the seven garrisoned communities or inthe Tambo River communities that managed to retain their freedom. These refugecommunities became heavily populated supercommunities known as niicleospoblacionales, or \"population nuclei.\" Because many young and adult men had died inthe armed struggle or were still under control of Shining Path, a large part of thepopulation was made up of broken families: widows, single mothers, and children, oftenorphans under twelve, who together composed up to 8o percent of the population ofrefuge communities (Rodriguez Vargas 1993:100). High population densities generatedconflicts over land and women, aggravating the depletion of local natural resources andmalnutrition. Density has also favored the spread of contagious diseases (diarrhea, skinrashes, tuberculosis), as well as recurrent epidemics of cholera, measles, and dengue.The cholera epidemics of 1991-1992 killed dozens of people in refuge communities,thereby inducing entire families to flee deep into the forest.Life in refuge communities is as highly regimented as in Shining Path camps,inspiring deep rejection among the displaced Ashaninka who have managed to escapefrom Shining Path control. Other conflicts between local and refugee populations springfrom the fact that refugees came mainly from remote interior communities, whereaslocal populations in refuge communities are among the most integrated. As a result,"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"locals consider refugees as less \"civilized\" than themselves, whereas refugees dislikeand reject the foreign \"civilized\" mores of the locals. But, above all, locals sus pect thatrefugees maybe acting as spies for the insurgents. Consequently, refugees are constantlywatched over, constrained in movement, discriminated against, insulted, and harassed.The situation of violence in the region has decreased in recent years. Although theAshaninka and the army have not been able to totally suppress Shining Path, the numberof attacks has been reduced to a minimum. However, the impact that two decades ofviolence has had over the Ashaninka population is still discernible in the deep divisionsthat scar Ashaninka society.The Enemy WithinAccusations of child sorcery intensify during periods of great social disruption causedby external pressures over native lands, resources, labor, and bodies, but also overnative cultural representations, values, and practices. These are times of violence andturmoil. Native people are displaced by force from their lands; they see their familiesseparated, their landscape transformed by alien economic practices, their ironworks,health centers, and development projects destroyed; their shrines, sacred places, andchurches desecrated; and their trading networks interrupted. These are also times ofrapid economic change witnessed by the adoption of new tools and technologies, theprohibition to carry out certain productive activities, or the impossibility of practicingnormal subsistence tasks. Changes in the sexual division of labor also occur as a resultof new market activities, the demands of a war economy, or the adoption of new socialmores. And changes in religious beliefs, political ideologies, and worldviews followthereafter.Above all, social disruption brings times of massive deaths, with entire families andeven whole settlements wiped out by epidemics of influenza, malaria, measles, dengue,and cholera. Times when the sick are abandoned by their relatives with a little food toeat or are killed by locals fearing contagion when they escape to other communities;and when swarms of agonizing people crawl to the river banks in search for water toquench their thirst or cool down their bodies burning with fever. Times also when nativepeople die in military confrontations with foreigners, often under very unevenconditions: bows and arrows against rifles, shotguns against machine guns. Times, infact, when the dead are so numerous that it becomes impossible for survivors to burythem, and they end up being eaten by carrion birds or buried hastily in mass graves."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"As unspeakable and disruptive as these externally induced circumstances are,however, they do not account fully for the escalation of accusations of child sorcery.Following Brown (1991), 1 suggest that Peruvian Arawak child sorcery, likeAmerindian millenarian movements, cannot be considered to be a simple response toexternal conditions-namely, colonial or neocolonial domination. Instead, child sorceryis intimately linked to the deep internal social fractures that develop when differentpositions and strategies are taken with respect to the presence of foreign agents.A quick review of the cases I outlined above shows that accusations of childwitchcraft always proliferate in contexts of internal conflicts between those whosupport and those who oppose the new faiths, dogmas, political ideologies, and forms ofknowledge introduced by foreign, mostly white, \"modernizing\" agents.6 As different inaims, methods, and rationales as they are, the activities of Franciscan missionaries,Adventists pastors, Shining Path or MRTA commandos, and state officials all have theeffect of polarizing native peoples into defenders and opponents of modernization andchange. In fact, the written evidence suggests that reaction with respect to these agentsof change has often been pendular, with an initial phase of receptiveness, hope, andacceptance followed by a phase of disappointment, hostility, and open rejection. This isclearly what happened to Churihuanti and his followers in the 18gos, to those whoconverted to Adventism in the 1g2os, or to those who voluntarily joined Shining Path orthe MRTA in the 1g8os. In all these cases, the option to modernize and the hope for abetter life promised by the new faiths, dogmas, orthodoxies, and forms of knowledgebrought in by the foreigners was followed by \"traditionalist\" backlashes calling for thedefense of the status quo.'I put \"traditionalist\" in quotes because, in each occasion, the defended status quo isdangerously similar to the utopias promoted by foreigners in the immediately precedingperiod. Churihuanti and his allies were probably angered when Peruvian authoritiesremoved Juan Santos Atahuallpa's remains from his Metraro shrine. But the eighteenth-century Juan Santos was himself a foreigner who advocated hybrid beliefs and culturalpractices combining Christian, Andean, and Amazonian motifs. The Catholic Ashaninkaof the Eno River became furious when drug traffickers and Shining Path burned downthe chapel of Cutivireni, crucifying one of their leaders and forbidding them to carry outsalaried activities. But, in the past, their ancestors had burned down Franciscan missionposts and had resisted attempts at involving them in market activities. Similarly, theAdventist and Evangelical Ashaninka of the Tambo, Perene, and Pichis rivers opposedShining Path and the MRTA for their antireligious discourse, their attempts to"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"dismember the native communities created in 1974, and their restrictions againstgrowing cash crops. But their ancestors frequently opposed the Adventist andEvangelical missionaries and rejected the legal notion of native communities because itthreatened the unity of their ethnic territory. In brief, elements that in each past erawere conceived of as symbols of op pression and of threatening change become insubsequent eras symbols of identity, ethnic cohesion, political autonomy, and culturalpride.Historical evidence shows that, confronted with new ideas and cultural practices,many Peruvian Arawaks embraced change in the belief that it would improve theirlives. The cases discussed above also show that, frequently, the accused childrenbelonged to families aligned with foreigners or manifested a personal inclination for allthings foreign. Maria Josefa's family was probably one of the first to support theFranciscans. The fact that she had a Christian name and sought refuge among theforeigners suggests that at the time when she was accused she had already been baptizedand was familiar with the foreigners. Conija's family had recently converted toAdventism. We are told, however, that the new faith was still not firmly implanted inYurinaki, and that many-including Chollaco, the local shaman-opposed it. Finally,Oijani's mother seems to have been receptive to Adventist preaching; otherwise wecannot understand her decision to take her daughter to the mission of Sutziki inopposition to her husband's wishes and at the risk of her own life.Contemporary instances of child sorcery accusations are no different. The two TamboAshaninka boys were recovered children; children whose families had joined-we do notknow whether voluntarily or forcefullythe Shining Path movement, and were still fondof guerrilla songs and symbols. Silverio was also a child displaced by violence; hisconstant thefts proved, in the eyes of community members, that he had been badlyinfluenced by Shining Path. In addition, he manifested an excessive craving for Westernformal education, a craving that led him to steal the 300 soles that led to his death.Finally, by refusing to incorporate himself into the community, the displaced Simonproved his neighbors right in suspecting that he was a supporter of Shining Path, withits adamant opposition to the legal construct of \"native communities.\" By attempting toobtain individual titles for his lands, Simon was also seen to support the ministry ofAgriculture. At the time, the Ministry advocated a modernizing neoliberal agenda thatsought to impose private property as the main form of property in rural Peru.Professionals working in refuge communities in the Tambo and Ene river valleysassert that children and adults accused of sorcery \"were frequently refugees that had"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"fled from Shining Path camps\" (Fabian Arias and Espinosa de Rivero 1997:83). Aleader of the Ashaninka Emergency Commission told me that the Tambo and EneAshaninka believe that most refugees became sorcerers while living in Shining Pathcamps deep in the forest, where the evil spirits of sorcery abound. Anthropologists,social workers, and other professionals working in the Pichis River valley haveinformed me that during the 1989 Ashaninka uprising against the MRTA, people whosupported the Ashaninka Army took advantage of the situation by killing many womenand children reputed to be sorcerers -most of whom were widows and their daughterswho sympathized with, or supported, the MRTA.In contrast with the past, it is not necessary at present to actually bewitch someone tobe accused of being a sorcerer. Other types of evil doings, such as stealing communalfunds, teaching \"dirty politics\" to local children, or supporting anticommunity politicalinitiatives are considered to be equally grave offenses. The common denominator of allthese acts is that they are antisocial; they threaten the integrity of the bodies ofindividual Arawak men and women or that of the body politic as a whole. Childsorcerers infringe on the mandate that solidarity must exist among close kin; they bringin epidemics, they subvert the children of the collectivity by transmitting alien ideas,and they deprive the community of its resources. But above all they contaminate thecollectivity by resorting to, passing on, and letting loose a wide range of evil powers. Itis because of this that child sorcerers are perceived as the \"enemy within,\" the rottenapple that infects the crate. Accordingly, they must be cleansed; if this is impossible, orif it fails, they must be purged.'In the past, only shamans-acting out their dark side-were entitled to identify childwitches; at present they share this prerogative with other, more secular, authorities.Periods of intensification of accusations of child sorcery among Peruvian Arawaksresemble \"witch-hunts\" in the broad sense; that is, an intensive searching out andharassment of those who hold unpopular views. Witch-hunts take place in contexts ofrapid social change, social disruption, and personal stress (Schoeneman 1996). In thiscontext, accusations can be derived either from ideological conflicts affecting thesociety as a whole, or from interpersonal conflicts induced by social change. Witch-hunts are always aimed at maintaining the existing social order or power structure. Theyare led either by those who want to preserve the status quo and orthodoxy vis-a-visthreatening new ideologies and mores, or by those who, having imposed a neworthodoxy and status quo, want to eradicate all vestiges of the old, competingorthodoxy. The persecution of Christians accused of all kinds of crimes and misfortunes"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"during Roman times exemplifies the former situation; the hounding out of pagans oncethe Roman emperors had become Christian, and Christianity became the state's religion,exemplifies the latter situation.In either case, the objective is to cleanse and purify society from individuals or groupsthat are perceived as polluting it: either \"others\" as specific subgroups that differculturally from mainstream society or as categories of people who belong tomainstream society but who have become \"others\" in the eyes of their own people byvirtue of their acts or thoughts. German and Russian Jews, Spanish Moors, centralEuropean Gypsies, and American Japanese exemplify, in different times and places, thefirst type of situation; witches in sixteenth-century Europe, clerics during the MexicanRevolution, kulaks under Stalin, and communists in the United States in the 1950sexemplify the second type. These others are singled out as responsible for the social,cultural, economic, and political crises afflicting their societies, either because theychampion new subversive ideas or because they cling to old values and beliefs. They areenemies within, not only because they are perceived as being essentially different-generally \"less than human\"-but, above all, because they embrace different ideas andideologies. Let us remember that Hitler pursued Jews not only because he consideredthem to be the antithesis of the Aryan race but, more important, because they weresupposed to be communists plotting the destruction of the German state.Child sorcerers fall into the second, and worse, type of others: people like us whohave become others in disguise, and who for this reason are all the more dangerous. Theritual execution, or expulsion, of child witches, and the ritual celebrations surroundingthese acts, seek to purge society of undesirable subversives. On the one hand they aremeant to destroy child sorcerers in body and soul, obliterating all trace of them from theface of the earth. On the other hand, they have the character of an expiatory sacrificeaimed at \"controlling the evil\" and \"disarming the forces of chaos\" let loose by them(Torre Lopez 1966:83-84). In brief, the ritual executions of child sorcerers are what wecould call \"rituals of identity\"; rituals aimed not only at eliminating the dangerousothers and the evil powers that threaten society, but also at bridging the social fracturesinduced by social change and restoring a sense of uncontested self-identity.Whereas witch-hunts in Cameroon (Geschiere 1997), South Africa (Comaroff andComaroff iggg), and Zambia (Colson 2000) are about occult economies and themystical struggle between the old and the young to obtain the magical powers that willensure them a portion of the riches promised by globalization, modernity, andmillennial capitalism, Peruvian Arawak child sorcery is still about fighting"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"revolutionary utopias and the evils of modernization. By directing their accusationstoward children and women belonging to families that had embraced change, or whothemselves manifested an inordinate interest in the new ideologies and modes ofbehavior, Peruvian Arawak shamans and leaders sought to contain change. Thus,selective accusations of child witchcraft can be seen as forms of social control anddefense of existing power relations; namely those linking village headmen and localshamans to their constituencies or clienteles.This in no way means that I support an interpretation a la Gluckman (1955) orDouglas (1970), for whom witchcraft accusations act as conservative mechanismsensuring the preservation and reproduction of the status quo. On the contrary, followingThomas Schoeneman, I suggest that witch hunts are self-defeating. As witch hunters\"work to expunge the menace and maintain the incumbent power structure, [they]change the culture and its internal relationships\" (Schoeneman 1996). Among PeruvianArawaks, accusations of child sorcery seem to be aimed at families or kindred groupsthat, because they have little power within their settlements, ally themselves to foreignagents of change in an effort to gain leverage against current holders of political power.By concentrating their accusations on those who have embraced change, witch huntersdeepen existing social and ideological fractures. They induce pendular reactions, withphases of witch-hunt and rejection of change followed by phases of openness to changeand rejection of traditional values and practices. It is through this social and ideologicalhistorical dynamic that Peruvian Arawak child sorcery constantly engenders socialchange. As a consequence of these pendular changes, the defended status quo of today isexceedingly similar to the utopias promoted by foreigners in the immediately precedingperiod: the accused of today become the accusers of tomorrow; whereas the innovatorsof today become the diehard conservatives of tomorrow.'NotesI would not have been able to write this essay without the support of many personswho trusted me by providing information on the very sensitive issue of child sorcery.I particularly wish to thank Beatriz Fabian Arias, the first person to report thereappearance of accusations of child sorcery among the Tambo Ashaninka, who wasvery generous with her time and information; Lucy Trapnell, who shared with me herextensive knowledge of the Peren6 Ash6ninka and Pichis Ashaninka, and took timeto answer my many questions on the subject; and the Ashaninka leaders-JudeJumanga, Miqueas Sanchoma, and Sebastian Martinez of the Ashanika EmergencyCommission, and Santiago Contoric6n, mayor of the district of Rio Tambo-who were"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"extremely candid, sharing with me their concern about the recent intensification ofaccusations of child sorcery. I would also like to thank Frederica Barclay, OscarEspinosa de Rivero, Leslie Villapolo, Blanca Reyna Izaguirre, Evangelicalmissionary Rett Bragg, Father Teodorico Castillo and Mother Leonilda and MotherViviana of the mission of Puerto Ocopa, and Judges Carlos Leiva and PedroGonzalez of Satipo for their invaluable help. Finally, I would like to thank Olga RLinares, who, as always, improved my English.1 For practical reasons, I will refer to these four Arawak groups as Peruvian Arawaks.The two Peruvian Arawak peoples of eastern Peru among whom child sorcery has notbeen reported are the Machiguenga of the upper Urubamba River and the upper Madrede Dios River, and the Yine, or Piro, of the lower Urubamba River.2 Whether this lack of information indicates that the belief in child sorcery wasabandoned, had simply subsided, or was concealed from the eyes of outsiders is nowopen to question. Anthropologist Lucy Trapnell (personal communication) told methat many years after she did fieldwork in an Ash6ninka community located in theupper Perene River she found out that, at the time that she lived there (1976), two boyshad been accused of being sorcerers and were constantly harassed by their accusers.Similarly, many years after she worked in an Ashaninka community in the PichisRiver valley she was told that while she was there (1979) a boy accused of sorcery hadbeen executed. Also, anthropologists Soren Hvalkof and Hanne Veber (personalcommunication) affirm that the practice of killing child witches has persisted amongthe Asheninka of the Gran Pajonal during the past decades.3 I use the terms \"child sorcery\" and \"child witchcraft\" interchangeably, for I argue thatEvans-Pritchard's (1980:227-28) distinction between \"sorcerer\" and \"witch,\" based onhis Azande material, does not apply here.4 Men (but not women) can also become sorcerers during their training as shamans,when in dreams they are drawn toward evil by a variety of demonic agents (seeSantosGranero 1991:114). Peruvian Arawaks distinguish this type of sorcerer fromthose initiated as children by asserting that the former are \"professional\" sorcerers;that is, specialists to whom one may resort to inflict mystical harm on one's enemiesin exchange for some kind of payment.5 Lucy Trapnell (personal communication) told me that accusations of child sorceryhave greatly increased in the 199os in the Pichis River valley. In 1995, in acommunity located in this area, a five-year-old girl was accused of bewitching her"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"mother; when her mother died, she was executed and buried with her, with theconsent of her father. Evangelical missionary Rett Bragg (personal communication)informed me that the notion that grave illnesses are caused by child sorcerers-mostlyyoung girls-is widespread among the Pajonal Asheninka. In 1996, an Asheninka girlwas accused of being a witch and was punished by having her eyes rubbed with hot-pepper juices. Anthropologist Frederica Barclay (personal communication) told methat accusations of child witchcraft have reappeared among the Yanesha in the pastdecade. In 2000, leaders of the Federacion de Comunidades Nativas Yanesha(FECONAYA) were asked to mediate in at least two cases of child witchcraft.6 This is valid for periods of intensification of accusations of child sorcery. Duringintermediate periods, when accusations decrease, the nature of the conflicts that giverise to them seems to differ substantially. I suspect that the differences in the kinds ofpersons accused during periods of intensification or decline in accusations is alsorelated to the dominant mode of identifying child witches: whether through divinationrituals in charge of shamans or through patient's dreams. I plan to examine theseissues in a future essay.7 In fact, whenever the activities of foreign agents have threatened the status quo,Peruvian Arawaks have rapidly coalesced into large military confederations to drivethem out, as manifested in the uprisings against the Franciscans (1896), theAdventists (1933), the MRTA (1989), and the Shining Path (1990) (see, for example,Renard- Casevitz 2002).8 At present, cases like that of Silverio are rare. Children accused of sorcery are mostlygiven away, as if they were orphans, to local normative families or tonongovernmental organizations devoted to the protection of orphans and otherchildren displaced by situations of violence (Fabian 1995:165). In other cases, childwitches have been given away to Catholic and Adventist missionaries or to theauthorities of nearby military bases, again as if they were orphans. Most of theaccused children are removed from their communities by native authorities ortraditional leaders who are more ac quainted and have more contacts with members ofthe national society. Some of these authorities charge a certain amount of money foreach child they hand to individual families in the cities of Satipo, La Merced,Huancayo, and Lima. Parents of accused children offer little resistance to the removalof their children, but in some cases they have joined efforts to inquire about the fateof their child among the missionary organizations and military authorities to whomthey were handed. Some of the alleged children witches have returned to theircommunities after a few years. In general, however, returnees have had problems"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"reincorporating into their communities both because community members aresuspicious of their activities and because during the time they were away theyadopted foreign mores and values. More often than not returnees end up moving toother communities where it is not known that they had been accused of sorcery.9 This is certainly the case with the Adventist Ashaninka and Yanesha. Whereas in the192os and 1930S they were the main targets of accusations of child witchcraft, atpresent they support the elimination or expulsion of children suspected of havingbecome sorcerers while under the influence of Shining Path and the MRTA. To justifytheir position they cite the Bible precept that states \"do not allow a sorceress to live\"(Exodus 22:18).ReferencesAmich, Jose. 1975 [1854].

Asclassificatory paradigms in anthropology they have not proved to be particularly fruitfulfor comparative purposes. Acts of secret aggression in Amazonian cultures defy thelabels of sorcery or witchcraft as defined by the African model, and the terms have beenfrequently used interchangeably, emptying their analytical value as universalcategories. In a similar way, attempts to essentialize shamanism and shamans have notresulted in fruitful insights. On the contrary, such efforts have often led tosimplifications and misconceptions about shamans and witches as social actors, withoutrevealing the central ideologies and moral philosophies that underlie shamanism.Fortunately, the authors in this volume move away from a classificatory approach tothese themes, directing them instead to the analysis of contemporary concerns inAmazonian ethnology, and in doing so they have been highly successful. Theysynthesize and underscore many of the new theoretical preoccupations and paradigmsthat have recently emerged, revealing the ambiguity and complexity of assault sorceryand shamanism as social, cultural, and political phenomena.' The particularities as wellas common themes of Amazonian cosmologies are also revealed, and the essayscontribute to the growing understanding of the organizing principles that distinguishtheir views of the universe and social praxis. The focus on assault sorcery as processrather than category has also yielded insight into the native notions of humanity,personhood, intention, and consciousness.Just as there is a great variety of social actors (glossed as shamans, singers, healers,herbalists, etc.) performing rituals and administering substances for beneficial purposesin the Amazon, there is an equal complexity in the kinds of individuals who send harmto others and the methods they use, whatever their designation may be in nativeterminology. In cases where the shaman's position is ambiguous, such as the Kulina andCashinahua, the aggressor may be the same person who heals. In other groups, such asthose of the Rio Negro area and the Warau of Venezuela, the classes of specialists aremore elaborated and less ambiguous.' Those who cause harm are distinguished frombeneficial shamans. Thus, categories of secret aggressors are culturally specific, andthere are no distinguishing features, such as conscious intention, manner of acquisitionof knowledge, nor methods employed, that cut across these cultures to permit theconstruction of a uniform definition of assault sorcery or their agents. The substancesand techniques that kill-songs, spells, and invisible arrows, darts, or other projectiles-may be the same as those employed for beneficial aims. Rio Negro poison-owners areclassed as aggressors by their knowledge and use of poisons, but anyone who knows the"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"proper spells can do harm. The Panoan people distinguish between categories oftechniques but not between categories of shamans. The aggressor may be the other-representing a nonhuman, the enemy, another resident or ethnic group, or in-laws; or heor she may come from within the heart of the community itself, as among the Kulina,the Arawak of Peru, and the Arara. The accused may be brothers or sisters, healingshamans, deviants, or children. The case of the Arawakan children tortured intoconfessing misdeeds shows the outer limits of the phenomenon. They are distinguishedfrom professional sorcerers and are marked by social marginality and the absence ofextensive kinship ties.We have been shown a dark side of the Amazonian universe and its inhabitants withharrowing images of darkness, predation, vengeance, and putrid stench. Although theparticulars of this Amazonian cosmology differ from group to group, what is commonis the notion of a universe propelled by the cyclic flow of vital energy that alternatesbetween the processes of life and death, construction and destruction, health and illness,equilibrium and disequilibrium, and the production and reproduction of social life. Theconcept of energy is a key metaphor related to notions of the soul, power, desire andintention. Secret attacks bringing misfortune as well as preventative and restorativerituals are manifestations of the activation of this energy. Assault sorcery, like curingshamanism, is at the heart of Amazonian cosmology and society.Discussions of South American cosmologies (e.g., Viveiros de Castro 1996) haveemphasized that important plants, animals, special locations, and invisible beings areattributed the status of humans. These entities may differ corporeally from humans but,like them, they possess intentionality and \"agency.\" Amazonian cosmology is about an\"intentioned universe\" (Viveiros de Castro 1996:126). Negative reciprocity representedthrough ag gression, predation, hunting, and violence is essential to social processes,and illness and death are associated with images of asocial forms of behavior andeating, such as the practice of cannibalism or the consumption of blood, the jaguar's rawmeat, or rotten and putrid food. Thus, Warau dark shamans, or Patamuna kanaimds,perform the important function of using their negative powers to maintain the balanceof the universe in a world where the netherworld-human relations depend on predation.The Parakana do not differentiate ontologically between predator and prey, and it isimportant to maintain the position of predator and to avoid becoming the prey. GeorgeMentore argues that the deadly and destructive forces associated with the shaman asspiritual hunter/warrior sustains the suppleness of Amazonian societies. Thehunter/warrior qualities of the shaman are found also among the Arara."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"This relation between shamanism, hunting, predation, and cannibalism is notnecessarily as central to all the Amazonian cultures as it appears to be for the groupsmentioned above. A good Cashinahua hunter cannot be a good shaman. However, one isstruck by the shared images throughout these ethnographies associated with death andillness. Both are generally caused by aggressive activities and forces in the occult sideof reality, whether they be instigated by humans or not. \"Being eaten from the inside\" isan extremely widespread image of illnesses that are attributed to invisible attacks.Putrid smells and other rotten qualities, particularly the stench of tobacco and blood,represent the decay of death as well as secret uncontrolled aggression.Secret attacks are attributed to two kinds of figures, specialists (shamans, poison-owners, etc.) and deviant individuals who are marginalized by the social process. Inboth cases, the motives for aggression often depict human emotions associated withhate, vengeance, jealousy, envy, fear, compulsion, and desire. These negative qualitiesare projected onto both humans and nonhumans. To Carlos Fausto's quote \"Amazonianshamanism is not a loving shamanism\" we can add that humanity is not pictured asloving but rather as a group of beings full of contradictions and ambiguities that can beset in motion to bring misfortune to others. Donald Pollock's discussion of Kulinapsychology is important because he interprets their vision of human desires asparadoxical, which avoids an essentialist negative or positive view of humanity.This paradoxical or ambiguous nature of humans implies also a lack of a clear-cutdefinition of the essential characteristics of wrongdoers. The observation that theParakana do not distinguish between good and evil as essential qualities is true for mostof Amazonian morality systems. Good and evil are relational and highly contextual, andwhat may be evil for one could be beneficial for the other. Native philosophy seems toimply that if death exists as a necessary evil for the cyclic universe, so also do negativehuman desires as the necessary opposite of human love, sociability, and collectivity.What constitutes a moral evaluation depends on one's involvement in the specific event(Read 1967).Within specific contexts, accusations of assault sorcery are associated with antisocialbehavior, deviance, marginality, and solitariness, but not necessarily withconsciousness. Control of aggressive emotions is lost and the violent constituents of theperson are released with the rupture of sociality. This rupture may occur in ongoingsocial life or in the rupture between life and death, when the dead forget theiraffiliations with the living and attack their own group. Waiwai moral philosophycounsels that everyone should guard against wrongly arousing his or her own"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"destructive desires. The histories of Baniwa witchcraft accusations in this volume pointout how the antisocial person is one who loses control over his thoughts and emotions.The Baniwa poison-owner is \"no longer like a person,\" and his true body resembles thatof a monkey. Echoing the theme of predation, uncontrolled violent emotionsapproximate the image of the jaguar, macaws, or other predators, and the distinctionbetween human and animal becomes blurred.Not only are sociability and solidarity collective processes that work to controlindividual motivations, they also are responsible for the exclusion of the accused. Anunderstanding of the processes of exclusion can only be accomplished through allanalysis of concrete events, such as that of Schultz (1976 [1960]), which details themarginalization and execution of a Krah6 shaman.' The shaman's identity as an evilshaman was constructed through his excesses-his deviant behavior that set in motion theprocesses of social exclusion. The loss of kinship and social alliances were importantfactors leading to exclusion and execution. We see the same process in the examples ofthe Arawakan children and Tchibie, the old woman excluded from Arara society foryears. They are socially constructed sources of evil and their identity is created throughcollective interaction and accusation.The link between witchcraft accusations and social conflict has been researched byvarious ethnographers ever since Evans-Pritchard (1976 [1937]) pointed out thataccusations indicate social conflicts. Indeed, \"sociological\" analysis has been successfulfor cross-cultural comparison. Several studies in this volume highlight the locus ofsocial conflict: they shed light on ambiguities in gender and kinship relations as well ason public political conflicts. Pollock, along with Elsje Lagrou and Robin Wright, havecharacterized such accusations as social discourse, pointing beyond purely sociologicalconsiderations. They, as well as others in this book, have highlighted how the socialprocesses of exclusion and the notions and activities surrounding invisible assaultsconstitute a moral reflection on the ambiguities of humanity, sociability, andcosmological forces.The studies from the Xingu and the Amazon-Orinoco region describe the extensivepolitical powers of the specialists in assault sorcery, particularly in the face of newcontexts. Michael Heckenberg confirms Bastos's observation published in the mid-1g8os that Xingu shamanism is more concerned with the realm of worldly politicalrelations than with cosmological preoccupations.' New situations, including contact notonly with other native groups but also with non-Indians and the political and economicprocesses of the state, have generated new uses of secret powers. Existing sorcery"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"systems are the result of historical developments brought about by colonialism as wellas internal forces. Salomon (1983) explored the transformation and operation ofshamanic politics during the Spanish colonial rule in Colombia and Ecuador. Taussig's(1987) postmodern ethnography of the interplay of the imaginary and terror betweencolonialism and shamanic practices stimulated others to examine the role between thestate and shamanism (see Thomas and Humphrey 1994). The articles by Robin Wrightand Silvia Vidal and Neil Whitehead continue this interest. Shamanic powers havetraditionally been important in the interethnic relations throughout the Amazon.' In theRio Negro, the messianic movements of the last century drew on shamanic powers andmyth, joining Indians and non-Indians in search of redemption. Wright's history ofaccusations shows extensive shamanic networks that extend from the Rio Negro to theGuahibo in the north and to the urban migrants and Mestizo population of Sao Gabrielda Cachoeira. New practices, such as Afro-Brazilian macumba, are incorporated into thearsenal of traditional techniques to defend or provoke harm. This exchange of sorcerytechniques between ethnic groups resembles a similar phenomenon in the shamanicrelations between the ethnic groups of contemporary Peru (Gow 1994).In the Venezuelan context, sorcery practitioners who work to influence employment,loans, and political elections have important economic and political roles. In bothBrazil and Venezuela there has been a rise in the number of Indian organizationsnegotiating for full citizenship and political power during the last twenty years. Conklin(2002) has recently argued that a generic shamanism emphasizing healing knowledge isplaying a role in Indigenous politics in Brazil. The documentation here of assaultsorcery provides a view of an important alternative route to empowerment in the largersociety by showing how native traditions permeate what is generally perceived to be amodern democratic process, and there is a need for more studies of this nature.The phenomenon of the child witches related by Fernando SantosGranero is of adifferent nature, although it is also related to the discourse of accusations. Marginalchildren, not professional sorcerers, are accused of sending misfortune through intenseemotions and are tortured until confession. The cruel treatment of suspected sorcerers isnot new in the region. Califano and Idoyaga Molina (1983) have described how theMashco, of the same linguistic group as those described by Santos-Granero, torturedand killed women accused of being witches. In the case of the children, suchaccusations and what can be seen as witch hysteria correspond to moments of crisiscreated by contact with the outside society. This correspondence was also perceived byGray (1997), who states that the Arakmbut's contact with the greater society from the"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"1950s to the lggos led to periods of increased conflict, epidemics, and crises thatresulted in accusations directed toward women, followed by attempts at assassination.In sum, the focus on secrecy and aggression has underscored the multiplicity of kindsof practitioners, techniques, and accusations that characterize the theme of shamanismin the Amazon. Its complexity and heterogeneity go far beyond the general notions thatwe hold about shamans, witches, and sorcerers and relativize the relation between goodand evil. This book has contributed to the growing knowledge about Amazon cosmologyand social relations by emphasizing its dark side. It supports the growing recognitionthat notions of nature and supernature as well as of good and evil are not perceived withthe same duality as they are in European philosophy. It has also helped us gain a betterview into the nature of power, which is present in various forms and degrees in theuniverse as well as in society. In the Amazon, power is linked to notions of emotions,person, intention, and consciousness as well as to the perceptions of the cyclic nature ofthe universe. Shaman specialists are able to access power to a greater extent thanordinary humans and have cultivated their knowledge for the intentional exercise of it.However, it is clear that they do not have a monopoly on secret assaults, and that thistopic goes beyond that of shamanism. The secret aggressor, no matter how classified,points to the notion of person as constituted through social discourse and cultural andhistorical processes.For some time it has been apparent that any cross-cultural definition of shamanism isdifficult to establish, and as Vitbesky has argued, it is characterized by a \"chameleon-like elusiveness\" (1995:184). Besides confirming Vitbesky's observation, the essays inthis volume also demonstrate this elusiveness to be true for cross-cultural definitions ofwitchcraft and sorcery. On the other hand, it does not support Parkin's (1991:2)suggestion that witchcraft and sorcery deserve no privileged place as analyticalcategories. The ethnographies here move beyond categories and focus on secret assaultsas forms of symbolic, social, and political processes. The privileging of secret assaultscontributes to the new themes and theories that have emerged since the 1970s. Asdiscussed above, some of these ideas are specific to the growth of Amazonianethnology. Others, however, pertain also to general paradigms circulating inanthropology as a whole since the 1g8os: challenges to the nature/culture debate;notions of agency, personhood, and emotions; sociality and conviviality as constituentfactors of social life; and the interplay of society, history, and power.'Notes"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"1 The reference lists at the end of each chapter are an excellent source for the majorthemes and preoccupations currently in debate.2 This does not eliminate ambiguity, as shown by the various essays on the region andalso by Hugh-Jones's (1994) discussion of horizontal and vertical shamans.3 Murphy 1974a and 1974b provide two case studies of the process of the destruction ofthe social person, although the situations therein do not lead to sorcery accusations.4 Dole 1973 [1964] previously recognized the importance of the political role of theshaman among the Kuikuru of the Xingu.5 In the mountain region of Colombia, existing pre-Colombian networks (see Langdon1981) were extended to the non-Indian society after the conquest and today make upthe complexity of actors and images portrayed in Taussig 1987.6 See Ortner 1994 for a discussion of the evolution of these ideas since the 1960s.ReferencesBastos, R.

In reading these chapters wereceived an impression of overlapping and interweaving themes that define a regionaltexture of ethnographic information. At the same time we could discern parallels withanalyses from New Guinea, whose volatile and dynamic societies, filled withinterpersonal conflicts and loyalties, show close resemblances in general to the ethos ofmany societies in Amazonian South America. Much has been written about shamanicpractices in South America: it is the classic case for such accounts. The chapters hereingreatly deepen our understanding of these practices, in terms of the training andknowledge required for them, what stimulates and maintains them, and how they havemutated in contexts of change, such as Fernando Santos-Granero describes for easternPeru and the Shining Path guerrilla movement. Above all, many (but not all, see RobinWright on the Baniwa) of the chapters reveal the ambivalence of the world of theshaman, and the overlap between shamans and sorcerers expressed in the vision of lightand dark shamans as discussed, for example, by Johannes Wilbert. These studies arehistorically grounded, showing how formations of ideas are profoundly shaped byhistorical experiences. Wilbert, although stressing the ideology of balance in the Waraovision of the cosmos, recognizes that the uneasy duality of Warao ideas has emergedfrom a history of disease, depredation, and internal gerontocratic exploitation byshamanic elders.In our comments here, we select a number of themes that link these Amazonianportraits of rivalry, power, and disempowerment to comparable materials from NewGuinea. Overall, it is very striking that through the chapters a pattern of rivalry,jealousy, and vengeance is found as one of the strong motivating forces for theactivities of dark shamans as sorcerers or witches. A minor aspect of this central themeis that in comparing terminologies used in the chapters we find arising the olddefinitional question of the distinction between witchcraft and sorcery. When weexamine indigenous terms for what Evans-Pritchard called \"mystical attacks\" we find acomplex of significations that blend together or juxtapose elements relating toconscious agency, spirit action, the use of charms, the exercise of bodily powers, theimposition of terror, and the like. For this reason, no hard and fast distinctions betweenwitchcraft and sorcery can be made. Readers of these studies have to realize, however,that what one author calls witchcraft another may label as sorcery (see Stewart and"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"Strathern 2003). No matter what the specifics, the overall theme remains the same: thedark shaman or sorcerer concept is a recognition of the patterns of aggression betweenpeople that are fed by passions and generated out of the same complexes of socialrelationships in which positive affect is expressed.It is perhaps for this reason that the pervasive ambivalence of the shaman's powers isexhibited, as among the Kulina described by Donald Pollock, for whom shamanicpowers are gained through the actions of senior shamans placing dori power into thebodies of initiates. Dori is related to semen and is dangerous if not used in a controlledway, so that its holders can heal others but also use it to inflict harm. The idea that thebody is the locus of power and that power is a kind of substance is one that fits wellwith many ideas from New Guinea. The Kulina concept of dori closely resembles maleideology among the Etoro of Papua New Guinea, as described by Raymond Kelly(1993), according to which the transmission of semen into the bodies of initiates bothmakes them grow and gives them knowledge. The workings of the ideas of the effects ofthe harmful use of dori is further comparable to notions formerly present among theGebusi (who belong to the same region as the Etoro): interhousehold relations aredisrupted by sickness, but blame is directed outward to sorcerers beyond the collectiveset of village siblings, and revenge is taken on the sorcerers, ideologically seen asaffines. Among the Kulina, jaguars, in turn, are said to eat the sorcerer's spirit. (In theGebusi case those who executed revenge killing on a sorcerer would eat the sorcerer'sbody, see Knauft 1985; Kelly 1993). The form that sorcery ideas take is that doriassumes the shape of a stone in the body that continues to grow unless it is extracted(comparable to the image of a tumor). Again, such a notion is closely paralleled byideas from New Guinea, where healers are classically said to extract objects projectedinto people's bodies by sorcerers. In a related notion, the Melpa speakers of MountHagen had an idea that kum stones could jump up from a streambed where people drankwater after eating pork and would then lodge in their throats, making them thereaftergreedy for flesh and turning their minds to cannibalism. In turn, this Melpa idea of kumis similar to the concept of karowara among the Parakana as discussed by Carlos Fausto,who states that karowara are \"pathogenic objects, controlled by shamans, with noautonomous volition, only a compulsion to eat human flesh.\" In Melpa ideas, however,the kum can exist as wild entities, autonomous in themselves, that a ritual expert couldcapture, tame, and bend to his or her own will. A kind of symbiotic arrangementbetween \"expert\" and \"pathogen\" is thus envisaged in both Melpa and Parakana cases,for in the latter, according to Fausto, \"to acquire a curing power, a shaman must suckthe karowara from a creature spoken of as the \"master of the karowara.\""},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Such parallels, with their concomitant differences in detail, do not seem to be theproducts of chance. They are, rather, a result of the overarching similarity of two basicideas: first, that human life is set into a cosmos of interpenetrating powers that includesthe environment and its wild creatures such as the jaguar; and, second, that powerresides in the human body and its substances and is affected by the ingestion orexpulsion of substances. Thus, for the Parakana, blood and tobacco together encompassthe shaman's powers. For New Guinea as a whole (i.e., West Papua/Irian Jaya and PapuaNew Guinea) we have argued these two points at length (Stewart and Strathern 2001).Both concepts amount to a basic form of ethnophi- losophy that we can characterize as aImmoral theory: substances and their powers constitute life and death within a cosmosin which balance is sought and fitfully attained. Within such a cosmos the practice ofhunting, with its dangers, its shedding of blood, its demonstration of power, and itssetting within the domain of the \"wild,\" easily acquires a special symbolic significance.And also in such a cosmos sensory powers beyond that of sight can assume greatimport. In particular, hearing and smell, both vital for the process of hunting, enter intopeople's picture of the cosmos and its spirits.In what we conventionally refer to as the \"social\" side, then, we have a narrative of theviolent potentialities inherent in relationships; while on the \"cultural\" side there is theimagery of the body and its substances, set in a dynamic cosmic flow. This vision of theworld is one that makes it particularly open to forces of change, which in turn can eitheroffer opportunities to people or oppressively close off opportunities they once had. Theoverall process of change amounts to an exposure of self to outsiders, starting withaffines in the community itself and ending with forces of the colonial or postcolonialstate. The impact of Christianity stands out here, as it does also in New Guinea. A desireto incorporate others in order to gain advan tage from them struggles with a fear of theirpowers and the experience of misfortune though interactions with them. A major pointhere is that in circumstances of change fears of sorcery/witchcraft may find heightened,rather than diminished, contexts of expression.Silvia Vidal and Neil Whitehead bring out these points very clearly in their essay onGuyana and the Venezuelan Amazon. They indicate how \"occult forces\" are a part of\"regional and national political processes,\" as Peter Geschiere (1997) has shown them tobe in Cameroon politics in West Africa. They also delineate the processes, againfamiliar from Africa, whereby in unstable times messianic movements led by prophetswere instrumental in reshaping political and ethnic groups. Shamanic and prophetictraditions converge in the image of Kuwai, a monstrous primordial being whose power"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"is invoked in ritual cycles by shamans. These strong indigenous ideas, entering intomillenarian movements, made their way into festivities for Catholic saints, and furtherinto national politics, for example with the idea that the president of Venezuela had hispersonal shaman whose magic saved him from a bomb attack by leftist guerrillas.Interestingly, while the volatility and dangers of political life have become very markedin Papua New Guinea's Highlands regions, rumors there surround allegations thatpoliticians raise their personal militias at times of elections, depending on guns notmagic; while at local levels fears of witchcraft and sorcery can be intense, waxing andwaning with the incidence of sickness, drought, and epidemics, and flourishing on themills of rumor and gossip about the unseen realms of power that constantly shadowlocal contexts of life.Vidal and Whitehead raise the comparative question of why and how \"occult forms ofritual action become the accepted processes of the state\" in some places and not inothers. Perhaps in Papua New Guinea it is the relatively strong institutionalizedpresence of the various Christian churches and an ideology that the nation is a\"Christian country\" that make a difference there. But it should be noted that forms ofChristianity and ideas of the occult feed off each other, as demonstrated by theCharismatics' slogan of waging \"a war against Satan.\"Among the Duna of Papua New Guinea, some individuals in 1999 attributed theputative rise in the activities of witches to the coming millennium, and the Seventh-DayAdventist compound attracted women who were at risk of being accused as witches inthe nearby Baptist community. At local levels, then, witchcraft and Christianity areclosely intermingled. Rumors and gossip spread fears widely, as Michael Heckenburgeralso notes for the Xinguano. The deaths of members of important families were morelikely to provoke witch-hunts than deaths in general from sickness, so we find the usualcorrelation between witchcraft accusations and local politics. While these idioms, as wehave said, are not marked at the national level, we do not suppose that this situation isnecessarily stable, given the pervasive and fluid local context of ideas about occultpowers.One striking difference at the cosmic level seems to be the importance of themythology of Kuwai, a fact that is remarked on in a number of essays herein. In PapuaNew Guinea there is no single overarching figure, other than that provided in Christianideology by the singular representation of God. But it is equally striking to see how thisapparent difference at the mythological level masks a similarity at the practical level."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"In his work on the Baniwa Wright notes that the first ancestral death was supposedlycaused by \"poison,\" and that Kuwai \"left all forms of poison in this world as vengeancefor his own killing.\" Revenge, then, lies at the heart of all subsequent \"mystical\"killings. And in practice revenge remains a powerful element, as both motif and motive,in social life.' This fundamental emphasis is shared by Papua New Guinea societies.Kuwai's doings seem to percolate through a number of Amazonian contexts. DominiqueBuchillet indicates for the Desana that Kuwai himself was a murderer who \"'killed'young boys being initiated,\" and plants that grew where he died were said to bepoisonous. George Mentore on the Waiwai writes that for these people \"all death meansmurder,\" attributed to the work of dark shamans. Marnio Teixeira-Pinto on the Araraargues that treachery is seen as lying at the heart of sociability itself. And Elsje Lagrou,on the Cashinahua, notes that dau \"means medicine as well as poison.\" What thepermutations of these views of social life appear to indicate is the double-sidedness oflife itself with its bright and dark sides: no conviviality without anger, no goodcompany without violence (as Bruce Knauft [19851 put it for the Gebusi of Papua NewGuinea);' no healing without killing, whether this is done by the same or differentpractitioners; no social act of aggression without its response in revenge; and no lifewithout death-thus completing the cosmological cycle.Perhaps revenge is too narrow a word for this cosmic principle, which Garry Trompf(1994) has called a \"logic of retribution,\" around which contested and contestingnarratives of legitimacy constantly play. This is what the dark shaman stands for, asKuwai's myth tells us. And it is this that the shifting images of shamans, witches,sorcerers, healers, and ritual experts capture, whether in Amazonia or in New Guinea.The figures of terror and redemption blend into each other, conceptually and across thecontinents.At the broadest level these studies capture the shifting dimensions and configurationsof feelings from which the phenomenon of terror in general emerges, or can emerge, inhuman interactions. In the realm of terror, physical acts take place in a wider cosmiccontext of the imaginary. Death is interpreted as murder, a sidelong glance as an act ofwitchcraft, an ambiguous phrase as evidence of sorcery. Imagination, built oncirculating suppositions and ways of locating meaning in the world, creates aheightened sense of fear associated with events and social processes. The ideas involvedmay not be clearly articulated but rather be part of what James Fernandez (1986) calledthe inchoate and Michael Taussig refers to as \"implicit social knowledge\" by contrastwith \"conscious ideology\" (1987:366). As Taussig explains, submerged memories of the"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"historical past and its continuing impact on the present are involved. He condenses thispoint into the phrase \"history as sorcery.\" Among the Putumayo of Colombia, whom hestudied, such ideas form around fears of the dead, especially the dead of precolonialtimes whose pulverized bones are thought of as arising and becoming an evil wind thatblows to harm people, particularly those whose blood is weak. This vision of the ancientdead comes from the history of \"the violent arrival and colonization by the Spanish\"(372), in which many people were killed. As the pagan dead, the remembered figuresmay reasonably be seen as malevolent and vengeful. They occupy \"the space of death\"and \"have been enfolded and iconicized into the bowels of the Christian cosmos asAntichrist figures.\" As a result, \"the history of the conquest itself acquires the role ofthe sorcerer\" (373). Shamans in turn invoke some of these images of the past, bendingthem to their own ambiguous activities as healers. The evil wind of the past blows intopeople's blood and it is the shaman's job to expel it with song. Taussig argues that theimages of terror blend with the practices of healing, and his study shows how aspects ofterror can be replicated and multiplied over time, along with the accumulated historicalsensibilities and vulnerabilities of a particular people. When these processes are furtherdispersed across national borders in globalized contexts of communication we can seethat the ambivalent figure of the shaman who uses senses of terror to offer practices ofhealing finds its counterparts on the stage of international politics.Most significant here is the ultimate role of terror in shaping and reshaping identities.The global structure of politics has recently been reshaped in this way, with the declineof East-West confrontations and the rise of dispersed movements wielding violence as apolitical tool and operating in the thickets of \"religious\" fundamentalist rhetoric andethnonationalist aspirations. Terror operates in these contexts as the ultimate weapon,forcing people out of an expansive sense of connections with others and contractingthem into its own \"space of death.\" In the face of such terror, the world has twocontradictory, but related, appearances: one, as a globalized set of networks of powerbreaching all boundaries; the other, as a multitude of states trying to close thesebreaches. Contemporary politics has its own shamanic figures who move across thisgeographical landscape.Notes1 We discuss this idea further in Stewart and Strathern 2002. For an important study onthe poetics and politics of death generally among the Patamuna people, see Whitehead2002. Whitehead's detailed study raises many issues for comparative analysis, as hehimself expresses in his conclusion."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"2 On the Etoro people referred to earlier see Kelly 1993.ReferencesFernandez, James W. 1986.
