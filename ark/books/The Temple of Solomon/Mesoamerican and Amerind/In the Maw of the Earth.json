To appreciatethe significance of this volume, one has to recognize that the interpretation ofcave use within a framework of religion and ritual is a relatively recent develop-ment. That is not to say that archaeologists and anthropologists have only re-cently begun to investigate caves. The history of cave investigation can be tracedback more than 150 years, beginning with memorable descriptions by Stephensand Catherwood of such caves as Bolonchen and the Gruta de Chac (Brady1989:Chap. 2). At the end of the nineteenth century, a number of archaeo-logical studies of surprisingly good quality had been carried out in the Mayaarea, including Henry C. Mercer’s (1975)The Hill-Caves of Yucatan,Edward H.Thompson’s (1897)Cave of Loltun, Yucatan,George Gordon’s (1898)Cavernsof Copan, Honduras,and Eduard Seler’s (1901) description of the caves of QuenSanto in the Highlands of Guatemala. After this early period, prior to WorldWar I, when the above reports represented some of the best methodological ex-cavations being carried out, cave investigations all but disappeared as a focusof archaeological investigation between the World Wars. Descriptive cave re-ports reappear after World War II, but it is not until about 1985 that a self-conscious subdiscipline focused on cave utilization begins to emerge in the Mayaarea (Brady 1997).The development of interpretive models of cave use contrasts sharply withthe history of field investigation that has been sketched above. The first majorsynthetic statement does not appear until 1959, with the publication of J. EricThompson’s ‘‘The Role of Caves in Maya Culture.’’ Thompson begins the arti-cle by noting that ‘‘the considerable body of information’’ on cave use had neverbeen brought together. Combining ethnohistory, ethnography, and archaeology,Thompson enumerates a number of uses of caves, all of which are related to ritual"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2In the Maw of the Earth Monsterpractices. Significantly, he never mentions habitation as a use. He treats evenreports of temporary refuge in times of unrest skeptically and notes, ‘‘But onemay doubt that this kind of occupation was sufficiently prolonged to have hadmuch effect on their contents; most caves in Central America are too damp to besuitable for long residence’’ (1959:129). This represents a sharp break in archaeo-logical thinking in that it appears that almost all previous writers had assumedwithout question that cultural remains in caves were related to habitation.This groundbreaking study appears to have gone pretty much unnoticed, inpart because it appeared in a publication of Hamburg’s Museum für Völker-kunde. Indeed, Ed Shook, an avid bibliophile and Thompson’s colleague at theCarnegie Institution of Washington, confessed in an interview that he was un-aware of the article’s existence (Edwin Shook, personal communication, July 21,1998). A revised version published in 1975 as an introduction to the reprint edi-tion of Henry Mercer’sThe Hill-Caves of Yucatanwas more significant to thediscipline. The accumulation of data in the sixteen years between the two articlesallowed Thompson to elaborate the second work into eight named and num-bered functions: (1) sources of drinking water; (2) sources of ‘‘virgin’’ water forreligious rites; (3) religious rites; (4) burials, ossuaries, and cremations; (5) artgalleries, perhaps in connection with religious rites; (6) depositories of cere-monially discarded utensils; (7) places of refuge (a minor use); and (8) otheruses. All of the ritual functions were mentioned in the earlier work. It is inter-esting, however, that a nonreligious function, ‘‘sources of drinking water,’’ wasadded (but dispensed with in a single paragraph) and ‘‘places of refuge’’ was ac-corded status as a minor function. Most of the newly described functions werepulled from a lengthy section of the first paper, ‘‘Other Uses of Caves,’’ so thatthe section in the second paper called ‘‘Other Uses’’ consists of only two shortparagraphs.A serious shortcoming of Thompson’s reorganization is its tendency to frag-ment the central role of caves as loci of religious rituals. In the original article,‘‘Religious Rites in Caves’’ is the first activity discussed, but it is relegated to thethird function in the second article. Thompson must be credited with callingattention to the use of virgin water, but he clearly became enamored of his dis-covery, as indicated by his elevating it to the second function. From all evidenceit is an extremely minor function that should have been treated as an activityassociated with the religious role of caves.He further fragmented the central role of caves in religious ritual by ele-vating several obscure ceremonial uses of questionable importance to the level ofindependent functions. Thus, ‘‘art galleries’’ and ‘‘depositories of ceremoniallydiscarded utensils’’ should also have been treated as behavioral aspects of caverituals.It is possible that Thompson saw each cave as having a single, narrowly de-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Introduction3fined function. In discussing Zopo Cave, he suggests that it may have been dedi-cated to earth gods, but he raises the possibility that it was devoted to lineagefounders, as if these two focuses are incompatible in the same cave (Thomp-son 1975:xxxiii). Since he defined these uses so tightly, they applied only tocaves, and there was little that related to the larger body of surface archaeology.Thompson’s fragmentation of a central focus on ritual also made it more difficultto contextualize the functions within the larger social system. It is unfortunatethat he made no attempt to indicate how cave-focused rituals articulated withinlarger religious systems or to assess the importance of caves within Maya society,because there was no one else in the field at the time who was capable of doing so.One aspect of cave use that would clearly indicate the social importance ofsubterranean features is the relationship between caves and surface architecture.In his earlier work, Thompson (1959:128) says, ‘‘Mention should made of cav-erns beneath buildings, notably the High Priest’s Grave at Chichén Itzá, butdiscussion of them would vastly extend our subject.’’ This is intriguing becauseit suggests that Thompson was aware of multiple examples that would requirean extended discussion. At the same time, the comment is near the end of thepaper, so it would appear that he did not consider the matter as important asthe other uses that formed the core of the article. In the later work, where spacecertainly was available, the issue was relegated to ‘‘other uses’’ where Thompson(1975:xlii) simply says, ‘‘One should also note Maya structures built over cav-erns, of which the High Priest’s Grave at Chichén Itzá is the most importantbecause of the human bones, worked jades, pearls, and vase of Mexican onyx, allseemingly thrown into the cavern before the aperture was closed.’’ Thompson’sfailure to develop this theme is interesting in view of Heyden’s work (discussedbelow).In evaluating their impact on the field, it must be recognized that the implica-tions of Thompson’s syntheses were not immediately accepted by archaeologists.While Thompson defined caves as spaces where ritual activities occurred, thisdid not automatically end archaeologists’ thinking of habitation as the majorcave function. Brady found that throughout the 1980s, the most persistent ques-tion archaeologists asked was why Naj Tunich should not be interpreted in termsof habitation. Only after a decade of publications did habitational and utilitarianinterpretations begin to disappear in the 1990s, although they still cropped upin some publications on Central Mexico (Hirth 2000; Manzanilla et al. 1996).Also on the negative side, relatively uninformed archaeologists working on cavesoften used Thompson’s article to mask the fact that they had no understandingof what was occurring at their site. Interpretations often consisted of wedgingtheir data into Thompson’s very static categories.These comments are not meant, however, to minimize Thompson’s contri-bution. When cave archaeology finally emerged in the Maya area in the 1980s,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"4In the Maw of the Earth Monsterit coalesced around these syntheses, and they formed the foundation on whichthe field has been built.At the same time that Thompson’s revised synthesis appeared, Doris Heydentook a very different approach in a series of articles interpreting the cave beneaththe Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan (Heyden 1973, 1975, 1981). Because shewas attempting to explain the placement of a single feature at a particular site,her work focused on the meaning and significance of caves rather than on theirfunction. For Heyden, the placement of the cave beneath the pyramid couldbe understood only in the context of the role of caves in myth and cosmovi-sion. While Thompson used ethnography and ethnohistory, Heyden drew evenmore heavily on these sources, perhaps because fewer archaeological data wereavailable for Central Mexico. This, along with the focus on meaning, tended toembed her work in an explicit social context.Heyden (1975:134), it is important to note, directly addresses the questionof the importance of caves in Mesoamerica. The prevalence of -oztoc,Nahuatlfor ‘‘cave,’’ in the site names of Central Mexico and the presence of the cavemotif in site glyphs, led Heyden (1975:134) to conclude, ‘‘They constitute animportant element in town sites.’’While Heyden was cautious in her wording, others recognized the impli-cations of her argument. René Millon (1981:235), for example, says explicitly,‘‘Nevertheless, the stubborn fact remains: the pyramid must be where it is andnowhere else because the cave below it was the most sacred of sacred places.Whether or not the Teotihuacanos believed that the sun and the moon had beencreated there, the rituals performed in the cave must have celebrated a systemof myth and belief of transcendent importance.’’The articles about the cave beneath the Pyramid of the Sun were not Hey-den’s only contribution to cave studies. In ‘‘Los ritos de paso en las cuevas,’’Heyden (1976) explores the possibility that caves were regularly used in rites ofpassage. She examines documentary evidence to show that caves played a rolein a number of rituals from birth to death. These ceremonies may have beensome of the most important in the society. She is probably the first to suggestthat at least a portion of the ascension ritual of rulers was held in caves (Heyden1976:21). It is also interesting that, whereas most investigators have connectedcaves with ceremonies in the agricultural cycle, she has related cave use to theindividual life cycle. Unfortunately, the article has tended to be ignored, perhapsbecause it was published in Spanish. It is hoped that with the publication of anupdated version in English in this volume, it will receive more attention.In other articles, Heyden considers the role of caves as an important feature ofthe sacred landscape (1983) and their association with birth and fertility (1987a,1987b, 1991). Her work is significant in developing a model of the meaning ofcaves that can be used to explore why they were being used in a particular man-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Introduction5ner. The articles on the cave beneath the Pyramid of the Sun are particularlynoteworthy because they ascribe an importance to caves that is of an entirelydifferent order from anything suggested in the literature at that time she waswriting.On the negative side, the often-noted separation of Mesoamerica into Cen-tral Mexico and the Maya areas is quite apparent in the writing of both Thomp-son and Heyden, as neither cites nor appears to be aware of the other’s writ-ing. If Heyden, in particular, had been aware of Thompson’s synthesis and hadseen the reference to the High Priest’s Grave, it might have suggested that thecave/architecture relationship she noted at Teotihuacan was part of a widespreadpattern.Barbara MacLeod and Dennis Puleston’s ‘‘Pathways into Darkness: TheSearch for the Road to Xibalbá’’ (1978) differs significantly from previous works.While professing to draw from a broad range of sources, including epigraphy,iconography, and ethnography, the authors actually utilize relatively little pub-lished material and do not even cite Thompson’s or Heyden’s work on caves.Instead, the article relies on MacLeod’s and, to a lesser extent, Puleston’s field-work. This in itself sets the work apart as being the first theoretical discussion byarchaeologists with extensive cave experience, since neither Thompson nor Hey-den had actually worked in caves. That experience allowed the authors to dis-cuss artifacts within their original archaeological context and permitted them tomake convincing suggestions about behavior, such as the placement of children’sskeletons in rimstone dams, which suggests child sacrifice. Their main theoreti-cal thrust is to associate caves with the Underworld, a model that is constructedfrom thePopol Vuhand Lacandon Maya ethnography. In discussing rites andactivities within caves, however, the authors mention rain ceremonies and referto cave-focused deities as the owners of the mountains, game, or lightning andas the givers of maize. All of these activities and figures tend to be associatedwith the earth in indigenous thought rather than with the Underworld.In the final theoretical article to appear before the beginning of a formal cavearchaeology, Mary Pohl and John Pohl (1983) propose that rituals resemblingthecuchceremony (involving the sacrifice of a deer and a peccary) may havebeen performed in caves by the ancient Maya. The outline of thecuchceremony,drawing on Mary Pohl’s (1981) earlier work, is quite convincing, but only themost circumstantial evidence is presented to tie the ritual to caves. A centralfeature of thecuchceremony, the raising of a pole to represent the world tree, isrelated to several native informants who identified ribbed stalagmitic columnsas ceiba trees, the world tree of the Maya. The authors note as well that deerbones and sacrificial blades have been recovered from caves. Finally, they sug-gest that caves may have played a role in some part of accession rituals. Hereagain, they produce little evidence to mount a convincing argument for such a"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"6In the Maw of the Earth Monsterconnection. Nevertheless, the article is important for recognizing caves as ‘‘themost sacred precincts of the Maya’’ (Pohl and Pohl 1983:28) and for raising thepoint that they were important enough to be the site of the society’s highestpolitico-religious ritual.It is quite clear from the preceding summary that when the subdiscipline ofMesoamerican cave archaeology arose around 1985, it had a remarkably smallbody of theoretical and interpretive material to draw on. A critical factor in thislack of development was the absence of cave specialists. While the lack of spe-cialists affected all aspects of cave research, one of the most seriously impactedareas was cave scholarship. Other than Thompson and Heyden, none of theearlier investigators were aware of the large corpus of published material thatalready existed. Later work, therefore, did not build on the foundation laid byearlier studies. Lacking a dialog with comparative material, reports rarely roseabove the level of elementary data presentation and, as a consequence, almostnever produced meaningful interpretive conclusions.The major early works by cave specialists since 1985 attempted to address thelack of scholarship. There appears to be a self-conscious attempt to order andsynthesize the data so that patterns begin to emerge. Juan Luis Bonor (1989)provides a number of topical summaries in the early chapters ofLas cuevas mayas:Simbolismo y ritualand then attempts to compile an encyclopedic inventory ofall known Maya caves. Brady’s (1989) dissertation presents a chronological de-velopment of cave investigation and contains hundreds of references. A chapterentitled ‘‘Use and Meaning of Caves’’ covers a number of themes and containsliterature reviews, and Brady conducts comparative analyses for each section ofthe site report, including such things as ceramics, artifacts, and skeletal material.Finally, the forty-seven-page bibliography is meant to serve as a guide to thecave literature. He later replaced it with an annotated bibliography,Sources forthe Study of Mesoamerican Ritual Cave Use,which formally defines the field’sliterature (Brady 1996, 1999).This synthetic thrust is no better illustrated than in Andrea Stone’s (1995)Images from the Underworld: Naj Tunich and the Tradition of Maya Cave Paint-ing.Before this work, one could reasonably question whether there was enoughevidence to justify ‘‘Art Gallery’’ as one of Thompson’s (1975:xxxvi) major cavefunctions. Stone’s exhaustive survey of all known Maya cave painting sites as-sembles a huge body of data that is far more extensive than the field realizedat the time. Stone, like Brady, also tends to view cave use in a Mesoamericanperspective, so that data from sites in Central Mexico are presented as well. Sheuses her data as well as information from iconography, epigraphy, archaeology,ethnography, and ethnohistory to provide an extensive discussion of cave use.A second change resulting from the formation of a specialized subdisciplineis that interpretation is now led by field investigators, which has altered the di-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Introduction7rection of interpretation in a number of interesting ways. In earlier interpre-tive works, writers using folklore, iconography, ethnohistory, and ethnographytended to deal with the concept of the cave rather than with any physical reality.This relegated archaeological evidence to a minor role. Even when archaeologi-cal data were invoked, they tended to be used very uncritically. For example,Thompson, who was the best at employing such data, simply notes the pres-ence of sherds on the floor of caves as evidence for the collection of virgin water,something that no cave archaeologist would accept today. Since the 1980s, how-ever, archaeology has been at the forefront of Mesoamerican cave studies, andthe archaeological record is regularly used as the critical evidence in musteringsupport for an argument. This expansion of the cave literature has meant thatinterpretations have tended to be less speculative and more heavily grounded indata.This orientation is evident in art history in the contrast between AndreaStone’s work and that of Karen Bassie-Sweet. The core of Stone’s (1995) bookis data that she collected herself, augmented by a careful combing of publishedsources. She is clearly mindful of cave context and comfortable with archaeo-logical data. Bassie-Sweet (1991, 1996), on the other hand, had little experiencewith caves at the time she was writing and rarely uses archaeological data. Thehighly speculative nature of her proposals also appears to be a throwback toearlier interpretive efforts.Finally, the role of ethnography in cave studies has been extremely curious.Sapper (1925:192) may have been the first to suggest that the ancient Mayaprobably treated caves as sacred places, much as the modern Q’eqchi’ do. Thereare also a number of early ethnographies, particularly from Oaxaca (Beals 1945;Parsons 1936) and the Maya area (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934) that recordsubstantial amounts of data on caves, but none of these provide what could beconsidered an extended theoretical discussion of these features. In the postwarperiod, moreover, mention of caves declines as ethnographers steered away fromwhat they considered an ‘‘idols behind altars’’ topic. Caves tend to be mentionedonly in passing since World War II, so, although all of the interpretative writersmentioned above made explicit and extensive use of ethnographic analogy, eth-nographers have not played a central role in the resurgence of cave studies. Thisis illustrated by the fact that there are few article-length publications dealingwith cave ceremonies. Interestingly, the first article that we have found devotedto a cave ceremony is Jarslaw Petryshyn’s (1969; see also Barrera Vásquez 1970;Uke 1970) description of a Lacandon rite, which has been translated for thisvolume. For Central Mexico ethnographic articles focusing on cave ritual arealmost nonexistent (Grigsby 1986).Evon Vogt was a notable exception to this generalization about the role ofethnography, in part because he had been interested in using ethnographic data"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"8In the Maw of the Earth Monsterin the interpretation of the ancient Maya for over forty years. Although he didnot focus primarily on caves, Vogt’s proposal that pyramids represent sacredmountains has proved particularly useful to cave archaeologists (1964a). He alsonoted the importance of cave shrines in communication with the supernatural(1964b; see also Blaffer 1972 and Laughlin 1977 on Zinacantan).Vogt’s (1969, 1976) enthnographies provide some of the most extensive dis-cussions of the use of caves, and his (1981) analysis of sacred sites within a land-scape approach has heavily influenced the thinking of the current generation ofcave archaeologists. Fortunately, there does appear to be a resurgence in interestin caves within ethnography, as evidenced by recent contributions concerningall areas of Mesoamerica (Christenson 2001; Knab 1995; Kohler 1995; Manca1995; Monaghan 1995; Pitarch Ramon 1996; Sandstrom 1991; Wilson 1995).Origins of This VolumeThe present volume grew out of an invited session, ‘‘Integrating Ethnographyand Archaeology: Caves in Modern and Ancient Maya Ritual Life,’’ at the1994 American Anthropological Association meetings in Atlanta, Georgia. Anemphasis on the complementarity of ethnography and archaeology is evidentin the present volume. Among our contributors, Abigail Adams, James Brady,Doris Heyden, and Evon Vogt were participants in that session. Dennis Ted-lock and Jaime Awe also gave presentations. The other major contribution tothe volume is a cave session organized by Patricia Austin and Keith Prufer at the1997 Society for American Archaeology meetings in Nashville, Tennessee. Thatsession broadened the focus of the present volume from the Maya to encom-pass all of Mesoamerica. Jaime Awe, Cameron Griffith, Sherry Gibbs, CliffordBrown, Keith Prufer, Janet Fitzsimmons, and Andrea Stone were participantsin Nashville.In assembling this volume we have endeavored to encapsulate the breadth ofcurrent knowledge of cave use in ancient and contemporary Mesoamerica. Whatbecomes apparent is the strong continuity between the archaeological past andthe ethnographic present with respect to the use of caves by indigenous peoplesof Mesoamerica. Ethnography and archaeology link caves to fundamental be-lief systems of peoples who see themselves as an integral part of an animate andlife-sustaining earth. These systems transcend religious doctrine and implicatethemselves in every facet of political, spiritual, and social existence. There is noaspect of Mesoamerican life that is not linked to the belief in a living world,the central features of which are the powerful symbols of mountains, water, andcaves. We have found that caves are points of access to the central focuses ofthese belief systems. The true sources of power exist inside the mountain, in a"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Introduction9mythical time and place that has been vividly portrayed in all available mediumssince the dawning of social history. Caves are portals—places where humanshave attempted to intervene and mediate with the forces that make the universeanimate.This book draws on the experiences of anthropologists and art historians whohave set out to explore the relationship between humans and the sacred earth.The authors come from varied perspectives and backgrounds and look at theirdata as archaeologists, linguists, and ethnographers. They all, however, reach asimilar conclusion: that Mesoamerican peoples’ use of caves is and has been afundamental part of the character of their social life.The chapters by Stone and Moyes bring new perspectives on the use of cave-spaces by the Maya, as well as insights into the interrelationship between artifactdistributions and cave morphology. The idea that caves were utilized in a mannerthat took into account their spatial layout is not new (Brady 1989:415; 1997),but these are sophisticated and synthetic explorations both of which find dis-tinctive patterning in cave deposits that demonstrate repeated and purposefulordering of archaeological features. The authors examine enduring Maya pat-terns of directionality—vertical and horizontal—and cruciform that have beenaptly discussed in ethnographic (Hanks 1984:136; Sandstrom 1991) and icono-graphic literature (Coggins 1980; Freidel and Schele 1988:426n7) in cave con-texts with favorable results.Stone (Chapter 10) uses pan-Mesoamerican cognitive models to propose thatthe intentional ordering of cave-spaces was a critical element in the structuringof ritual activities, and that this ordering was accomplished in both traditionaland innovative ways. She draws heavily on iconographic models of the cosmicgrid, with its horizontal and vertical divisions, color-directional symbolism, andconcepts of the multilayered universe, to support her proposal that caves repre-sent an ideal laboratory in which spatial analyses can illuminate specific ritualbehaviors. She astutely notes that cognitive models she believes motivated theplacement of cave artifacts are extremely difficult to verify from archaeologicalevidence alone, especially where contexts have been disturbed by looting, naturaldisturbances, or other degradations.Moyes’s chapter (Chapter 11) takes spatial analysis into the cave, as she looksfor patterning in cave morphology and artifact distributions that may producearchaeological ‘‘signatures’’ useful for comparative analyses. Like Stone, she as-serts that the formal and repetitive characteristics of ritual behaviors should beexhibited in the material remains of the activities in meaningful ways that aredetectable by archaeologists. Moyes’s laboratory is the spectacular cave ActunTunichil Muknal, located in central Belize—a largely undisturbed five-kilometertunnel that contains evidence of repeated and long-term ceremonial use. Sheapplies technologically sophisticated Geographic Information System (GIS) to"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"10In the Maw of the Earth Monsterfacilitate a global assessment of artifact placement and distribution patterns. Herstudy indicates that multiple cognitive spatial models resulted in clearly boundedclusters of artifacts that have internal patterns within larger intentionally mod-eled groupings.Awe, Griffith, and Gibbs (Chapter 9) also focus on Actun Tunichil Muknal,though their interest lies in the two shaped slate monuments on a high ledgedeep in the cave. The two monuments are carved to resemble a stingray spineand an obsidian blade, implements associated with autosacrifice by bloodlettingin Pre-Columbian texts and art. They argue that cave monuments are a regionaltradition in central Belize and document two additional examples from Labe-rinto de las Tarántulas and Actun Chechem Ha, and that slate was a preferredmedium for these monoliths. They also link the use of the cave and the stelaeto nearby surface sites where similar carved monuments are found.Chapters by Adams and Brady and Stuart and Vogt take ethnoarchaeologi-cal approaches to the investigations of cave utilization by the modern and thePre-Hispanic Maya. Both papers draw heavily on the terrestrial orientation ofMaya religions and conclude that elements of modern ceremonial behaviors werealmost certainly present in ancient ritual activities. Adams and Brady (Chap-ter 12) look at Q’eqchi’ Maya cave pilgrimages, the identification of pilgrimswith the earth deity, the Tzuultaq’a, and the offerings to this deity. Their dataare important, since they detail not only specific types of offerings made dur-ing pilgrimages, but also the ritual importance of the objects offered. They alsodemonstrate that while rituals performed in caves are solely the domain of men,women are a critical element in the acquisition of ritual paraphernalia and offer-ings made outside of the cave. Participation of each person involved in petition-ing the Tzuultaq’a is conditioned by gender, and the deity is marked by bothfemale and male attributes.Vogt and Stuart (Chapter 7) also utilize ethnographic data from the well-studied region of Highland Chiapas combined with the recent identification ofthe hieroglyphic toponym for cave to discuss long-standing continuity betweenpast and present cave-focused ceremonial activities. Their ethnographic analy-sis illuminates how deeply intertwined earth symbolism and features from thenatural world form a broad system in which metaphor and action create a sacredand animate universe. The recent interpretation of a glyph meaning‘‘ch’een,’’or‘‘cave,’’ has far-reaching implications for our understanding of how the Mayainteracted with the sacred landscape. While archaeological and analogical datahave increased interest in and understanding of cave utilization in ancient Meso-america, the role of elite segments in these activities has been largely conjectural.This new evidence from indigenous texts indicates that caves were an importantconcern of elites and refocuses discussion on the larger implications of politicaldiscourse on the sacred landscape."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Introduction11Pure ethnographic research is at the heart of chapters by Petryshyn and Sand-strom, both of whom approach cave ceremonialism from very different perspec-tives. The chapter by the late Jaroslaw Petryshyn (Chapter 13) is included herefor its description of a cave ritual by the Lacandon of Chiapas. Descriptions ofcave rituals are, by virtue of their secretive nature, rare in the ethnographic lit-erature. Petryshyn’s account, based on fieldwork conducted in 1968, is the first toreport on a Lacandon religious ceremony in a cave. The cave described is namedafter the god Tsibaná, who is consulted during heavy rainfalls and is prayed tofor success in agriculture. He resides in a cave that bears his name. Petryshyn’saccount leads us from the village to the cave and guides us through a detaileddescription of the protagonists and events that transpired.Sandstrom’s chapter (Chapter 3) examines earth symbolism and cave-focusedrituals of the Huastecan Nahua of Central Mexico. He demonstrates that in-digenous knowledge of the earth manifests itself as an intersection betweenscience and religion, with all objects and beings having sentient and animatequalities; this knowledge is the ‘‘symbolic rendering of empirical fact.’’ Elabo-rate myths become an explanatory mechanism that perpetuates and invigoratesthese beliefs. Nahua cave-focused activities and beliefs are but one manifesta-tion of these complex relationships. Sandstrom’s data point repeatedly to therole of ritual specialists in mediating human needs with earth deities in the cavecontext, a theme revisited in most of these chapters.Heyden’s chapter (Chapter 2) is a synthetic review of literature regarding theuse of caves in the Valley of Mexico. She draws data from both early colonialdocuments and modern ethnographic accounts. She contrasts those events thatcan be loosely defined as ‘‘rites of passage’’ with other specialized ceremonialbehaviors. Heyden was one of the first researchers to examine the link betweenmythology and cave utilization, and her data are rich and detailed. The meta-phors for creation and birth, so prevalent in Mesoamerican myths, link cavesto the origins of humans and deities alike. Like Sandstrom, Heyden finds thatrain and water are dominant themes in cave-focused beliefs and actions, andthat the importance of deities responsible for these life-giving elements is pan-Mesoamerican. Her work also strongly implicates earth-focused belief systemsin the healing and illness complex, with caves being the focal point for offeringsand prayers to ensure health and well-being.Prufer (Chapter 8) examines the roles of ritual specialists as a fundamentalsocial feature in traditional societies and proposes that archaeological data caninform us on the types of actors involved in ceremonial cave activities in the past.Drawing on data from one of the most extensive cave surveys in the Maya Low-lands, he examines cave morphology, artifact types, and artifact distribution pat-terns to support his proposition that there were two fundamental types of pro-tagonists represented in Classic Period cave contexts: political actors attached"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"12In the Maw of the Earth Monsterto ruling institutions; and shamanic individuals, who were more peripheral tostatecraft and the posturing of elites. These actors likely used spaces in very dif-ferent ways and toward differing ends. Political aspirations were expressed inlegitimation ceremonies held in open and well-lighted cave spaces. More re-stricted specialists operated in dark cave interiors. Rockshelters are an importantpart of this equation, with evidence of repeated mortuary use and evidence oflarge-scale burning and massive offerings.Two chapters deal with the archaeology of caves in Oaxaca. Rincón (Chap-ter 6) examines the little-known wealth of cave sites in the Coixtlahuaca Basinlocated in the northernmost section of Oaxaca’s Mixteca Alta. He notes earlymissionaries’ accounts of cave cults that flourished throughout the highlands ofMesoamerica on the eve of the Spanish conquest, with special attention to in-terior cave paintings and examples of ceremonial behaviors. He compares theseaccounts to archaeological data from several spectacular cave sites in the basin,with the aim of better understanding the continuity between Pre-Columbianand historical use of these sacred spaces.Fitzsimmons (Chapter 5) reports on the archaeology of Blade Cave, locatedin the Mazatec region of Oaxaca, and one of the few caves from this region eversubjected to archaeological investigation. Her detailed descriptions of artifactdistributions link the historical and prehistoric use of the cave to local and re-gional sites and places the region in a framework of larger Mesoamerican cavetraditions.Two chapters focus on the prehistoric use of caves in the Yucatán Peninsula,a region where subterranean spaces were both sacred portals and the sources oflife-sustaining water. This region is particularly difficult to understand archaeo-logically, in part because caves were used for both secular and religious purposes,a phenomenon that is uncommon elsewhere in Mesoamerica. The chapter byBrown (Chapter 15) proposes that caves and cenotes at the Postclassic capitalof Mayapán were more important in determining settlement patterns than theywere in the relatively well watered highlands. He stresses that both their utili-tarian function and their ideological significance are deeply intertwined. Cavefeatures became cosmological centers of Yucatecan communities, and this sig-nificance is reflected in both the spatial arrangements of architecture in the land-scape and the written and oral history of the Maya.Rissolo’s chapter (Chapter 14) focuses on caves in the Yalahau region ofQuintana Roo, near the surface site Tumben-Naranjal and the secondary cen-ter of San Cosmé, which are linked by a three-kilometer-longsacbe(literally,‘‘white way’’; a raised road). This region is wetter than Brown’s study area in thenorthern Yucatán, and though there are many water-bearing caves and cenotesat Yalahau, they are neither the only nor the most accessible sources of water.Still, these water sources were the locations of considerable ceremonial activity,"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Introduction13even when it was difficult to access very modestly sized pools. Rissolo documentsthe regular maintenance of cave passages and the frequent occurrence of rockart near the pools. The draw of these caves was both the presence of water and,possibly, the specific symbolic importance of water from underground spaces. Inaddition, access to many caves may have been restricted; vertical and modifiedentrances indicate that at least some caves were hidden or their use was dis-couraged. Like Prufer, Rissolo recognizes that rockshelters were conceptuallythe same as caves, though they may have functioned as more open and publiclyaccessible spaces.Finally, in our concluding chapter we examine the role of cave studies in mod-ern anthropological and archaeological thought. We review the production ofcomparative models and appraise the value of regional and local analysis. De-spite growing interest in sacred landscapes in the study of prehistory, there is stillstrong skepticism about methodological approaches used to understand ancientreligious thought and action. We attempt to look at the history and causes ofthis skepticism and propose new directions for the field of Mesoamerican cavearchaeology.ReferencesAndrews, E.

These rites are not restricted to the passage of a person from one socialstatus to another in the course of that individual’s life, but also ‘‘mark recog-nized points in the passage of time (new year, new moon, solstice, and equinox)’’(Turner 1987:386). Nevertheless, there are many rites that affect people and thatare not ‘‘of passage.’’ Here I shall discuss some ceremonies as they have beenpracticed in caves in Pre-Hispanic and early colonial Mexico as well as today.CreationThe first rite of passage in the life of an individual, of a group, or of a cosmicevent is creation, birth. The sun and the moon are said to have been born in acave, according to the early chroniclers Antonio de Herrera and Ramón Pané(Herrera 1945:305; Pané 1974:96). As Mendieta said in the sixteenth century,referring to the creation of the Fifth Sun in Teotihuacan, ‘‘after [Nanahuatzin]threw himself into the fire and was transformed into the sun, another [divinepersonage] went into a cave and came out as the moon’’ (Herrera 1945:87).Even the sky was created in the interior of the earth, which can be interpretedas a gigantic womb, a cave. The ‘‘Histoyre du Mechique’’ describes the jour-ney made by the gods Tezcatlipoca and Ehecatl into ‘‘Tlalteutl [or Tlaltecuhtli],who is the earth itself ’’: Tezcatlipoca entered Tlaltecuhtli’s mouth and Ehecatl,the navel, ‘‘and both joined at the heart, the center, of the earth, and there theyformed the sky, the low-level sky’’ (Histoyre du Mechique 1973:105). A similarmyth reported by Gossen (1972) tells us that among the Chamula of Chiapas"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"22Central Mexicothe Sun lived in the center of the earth before moving up into the sky. Cavesare important in Chamula cosmovision; the earth is laced with caves that even-tually reach its edges, and the earth lords live in mountain caves, where theycontrol ‘‘all forms of precipitation, including accompanying clouds, lightningand thunder’’ (Gossen 1972:136–137).Many gods, too, were created in caves. The Florentine Codex refers to theplace where the oldest of the deities, the god of fire, Xiuhtecuhtli, resided, inthe middle of blue water, in the navel of the earth (Sahagún 1969b:19, 41, 88–89). As has been mentioned, the navel, or center, of the earth is the equivalentof a cave, the womb.Maize, the basic cereal of Mesoamerica, one of whose names is Cinteotl,Divine Corn, was born when the deities went into a cave where the god Piltzin-tecuhtli was in intimate contact with the goddess Xochipilli, and from this rela-tionship Cinteotl was born (Histoyre du Mechique 1973:110). Sixteen hundredgods were created in Chicomoztoc from a great flint knife that fell from the skyand was shattered there in the cavern (Mendieta 1945:83).Humans also came from caves. The womb of the earth was the place of cre-ation of ethnic groups. It had many names; the best known is Chicomoztoc,‘‘Seven Caves.’’ Another is Tamoanchan, the paradise of the Mother Goddess,the place of birth, thecincalli,or house of maize (Seler 1963, 1:25). Garibay de-finescincallias the cavern that is ‘‘the place of the origin of humanity’’ (Durán1967, 2:584). Seven groups emerged from Chicomoztoc, the caves ‘‘from whichtheir ancestors came,’’ where ‘‘their fathers were born in caves’’ (Durán 1967,2:218–219). According to Pané (1974:22, 93), ‘‘all humankind was created intwo caves.’’ Not only do the chronicles mention these cave-births, but they areportrayed in pictorial codices, among them theAtlas de Durán,the Codex Xó-lotl, the Codex Selden Roll, and theHistoria Tolteca-Chichimeca(Figures 2.1,2.2, 2.3, 2.4).The Florentine Codex cites Mexica women who said that ‘‘in us is a cave, agorge...whose only function is...toreceive’’ (Sahagún 1969b:118), and alsoto give life. A child created in the human cave was called ‘‘a precious necklace, arich feather’’ (Sahagún 1969b:118). When a woman was about to give birth themidwife took her to the steam bath, thetemazcalli,also calledxochicalli,‘‘houseof flowers’’—since the flower is a sexual symbol related to the uterus, and thetemazcallirepresents an artificial cave, a place of birth (Sahagún 1969b:151).Rites in Caves TodayThe Tzeltales of Pinola, Chiapas, believe that the spirit of each person is in hisor her heart or throat but also is found in caves high up in the hills, where mon-keys, who like to steal the spirits, cannot reach them (Hermitte 1970:49–50)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Rites of Passage and Other Ceremonies23Figure 2.1.One of the sevengroups that emerged fromChicomoztoc.

In order todistinguish her baby from the others she tied a colored ribbon to the infant andthen went outside for a moment. On returning she found that her child haddisappeared, though the ribbon was still there. The cave, she felt, had stolenher baby. A priest then exorcised the cave and placed a cross at the entrance.Later, these rites were no longer held there nor did the cave steal more infants(Gregorio García, personal communication with M. E. Smith, May 1970).Graniceros,who carry out their rites in caves, are said to control the weather."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"24Central MexicoFigure 2.3.Chicomoztoc, place oforigin, showing the seven cavesof creation.

The late Guillermo Bonfil (1968) describedgranicerorites in the cavesat Iztaccihuatl and Popocatepetl. Supposedly, there are schools to traingrani-cerosin these mountains. According to Bonfil, thegraniceros,the controllers ofmeteorological phenomena, belong to a strictly controlled organization. In order"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Rites of Passage and Other Ceremonies25to become a member and attend the cave ceremonies a person must have been‘‘called from above’’—that is, designated to work on earth with the supernaturalpowers that manage rain, thunder, lightning, and the climate. But only thosewho have been struck by lightning are eligible for this important task. If theysurvive the baptism by lightning, they cannot deny their destiny and must jointhe organization (Bonfil 1968:99–128).Cave rites ensure a child’s health and well-being. For example, in Chalma, aplace famed for pilgrimages, there is a cave with a Christian shrine within it. Theumbilical cords of children are frequently left in two caves for its saint, the Señorde Chalma, one at the bottom of the hill, and one at its summit. Some parentsleave the cord at a sacred cypress tree. As a result of this ceremony the childwill be fortunate throughout his life ( John Hobgood, personal communication,1974).Many caves are said to be inhabited by little men called ‘‘cheneques’’ in someregions. The land immediately beneath the earth is Tlalocan, the abode of therain god Tlaloc, who also fructifies the land so the plants will grow. This vastarea is considered by some to be a gigantic cave. Nevertheless, this subterraneanworld—Talocan, as the Nahuatl-speaking people of the Sierra de Puebla callit—is identified in different ways in different places, but it is always beneath,‘‘tlalticpac,’’the earth’s surface. It is called the ‘‘sacred earth’’ by the Nahua of thesierra, who also refer to Talocan as the Underworld. Entrance to this place ofnatural riches, of sustenance, is through caves that are guarded bychenequeswhokeep out the undesirable, for example, people who kill deer when they do notneed their meat, who simply wound animals, or who destroy vegetation need-lessly (García de León 1969:294–295n 20). The Lord of the Animals lives ‘‘in apalace’’ or great cave that is located in a part of Tlalocan found directly beneaththe San Martín Tuxtla volcano in Veracruz, according to some accounts (Garcíade León 1969:294–295n 20).In the region of Xico, Veracruz, the Owner of the Hills and all the flora andfauna there is Juan del Monte Cuauhxibantzin, thetlamatine mayor(tlamatinesare the localtlaloques,divine personages who control rain, lightning, and thun-der). Juan lives in caves with his wife, doña Juanita Cuauhxibantzin. Accordingto an informant in Xico, don Anastasio, Juan del Monte is the earth itself, andpeople must ask his permission and that of his wife to take something fromthem, for example, a tree they cut down. Another informant, don Luis, tellsthat the first time he planted his fields he inspected the land to see how manycaves were there. When he found the largest one he made an offering in it to‘‘Saints’’ Juan and Juanita and requested permission to plant. Don Luis explainsthat the divine couple has a corral within the cave where animals are kept (forthey are also lords of the animals), and when they are approached correctly, withofferings, they put the animals in the corral so the seeds just sown will not betrampled (Noriega Orozco 1994:20, 40, 96, 123, 126)."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"26Central MexicoIn the Isthmus de Veracruz region, the Earth Lord, the Chaneco, who con-trols water, plants, and animals, resides in Talogan, as it is called there, the sub-terranean world rich in the products of nature, where caves, which are the Cha-neco’s home, abound. In these caves, as well as on certain hills and at waterfalls,healers and shamans retire to dedicate themselves to ascetic practices duringtwenty-one Fridays (Münch 1983:173). At the nearby Cerro de las Pulgas thereis a cave with hieroglyphs on its walls that are considered to be magic symbolsleft there by the ancestors. It is here that those who are initiated as healers aretaught about natural phenomena, the properties of medicinal plants, the cyclesof rainfall, how to cure illnesses, when they should observe sexual abstinence,and how to offer copal incense to the Chaneco, earth god (Münch 1983:173).Knab, who dedicated many years to fieldwork in San Miguel Tzinacapan,reveals the importance of caves in the cosmovision, healing practices, and every-day beliefs of this town in the Sierra de Puebla. In ‘‘Geografía del inframundo’’(1991) he lists four entrances to the Underworld, two of which are through caves:the north entrance by the ‘‘cave of the winds,’’ which is the access to the world ofthe dead; and the south entrance, Atotonican, a hot spring at the back of a cavewhere clouds are produced. The other entrances are Apan, a large lake (east),and Tonalpan (west), on a mountaintop where the sun stops and continues onlyafter midnight. Linda Manzanilla et al. (1994:156) note that two of these en-trances or caves have toponyms that also exist near Teotihuacan: Apan in the eastand Mount Tonalan to the west. They suggest that the Sierra de Puebla mythand a Teotihuacan version of sacred geography may be based on an archetypicalMesoamerican conception of the underworld. It is now well known that caveshave played an important part in planning, history, and myth in Teotihuacan(Heyden 1975, 1987).In Tzinacapan, thecurandero(curer, practitioner) analyzes problems in a cave,eachcuranderoin his own special cave. He travels to the underworld in dreams tosearch for the soul of his client. The practitioner’s job is to restore the essentialharmony between the three essential aspects of the soul: thetonal,or spiritualsource, which can become separated from the body; theyolo,or internal animat-ing force—referred to as the heart in Sierra Nahuatl, and thenagual,or alter ego,which is born and dies at the same time the person does. Equilibrium amongthese three aspects, according to Knab (1991), especially in the case of illness, en-sures social, spiritual, and natural environmental harmony. In the case of illness,the curer diagnoses the problem by means of dreams, in which he travels throughthe underworld. The dreams are not interpreted as a psychiatrist would, but areused by the healer to observe, in dreams, the geography, the features of the ter-rain of Talocan, the Underworld, in order to compare their symbolism, theirfeatures, with those in everyday life on the earth’s surface (Knab 1991:36, 48).Numbers are important in Tzinacantan and often indicate when thecurandero"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Rites of Passage and Other Ceremonies27must go to the cave. Each geographical feature in Talocan has its own number,and these numbers indicate the distance of a river, lake, and so on, from the cen-ter of Talocan. Fourteen is the very center, and the most beneficial numbers thatthe curer dreams are those that coincide with aquatic sites.This is a complicated concept, not easy to understand. The number thecuran-derodreams, for example, determines the day or time when the client should goto the cave with offerings and to request permission to cultivate the earth, toirrigate it, and to prepare the seed. When maize is to be planted, the practitionersees in dreams the place and number that will determine agricultural success. Ifthe practitioner dreams of a river that is in tenth place in Tlalocan, this meansthat in ten days the rains will begin to fall and in ten days offerings should bemade and the seeds prepared for the first planting. Permission to plant is alwaysrequested of the sacred earth by leaving offerings at the cave. The ‘‘root’’ of anewborn, that is, the umbilical cord, is also planted in the sacred earth or in themilpa or under the floor of the house (Knab 1991:32, 33, 47–48). Thecuran-deroin his cave continues to send his dreams to Tlalocan to determine whichagricultural rites are to be carried out and when.The farmer who requests permission of the earth to sow seeds within her mustalso give thanks with offerings at harvest time, and if he has removed too muchwater for his plants, he takes flowers and candles to the water hole. If he or anyother inhabitant of Tzinacantan kills too many animals, he must take offeringsto the cave in order to pay for damages to the environment (Knab 1991:53).In Tzinacantan the people leave abundant harvest offerings at the caves (Knab1991:54). Some informants, however, believe that Tlalocan gives rather than re-ceives. Prócoro Hernández, who lives in Cuetzalan near Tzinacapan, says thatwater from the numerous caves in the area is pure because it comes from Tlalocanwhere there is no contamination. Money and power are also guarded in caves;therefore it is necessary to propitiate the beings within (María Elena Aramoni,personal communication, cited in Aramoni Burguete 1990:145–146). ‘‘Every-thing we need comes from Tlalokan madre, Tlalokan padre’’ (the earth), saysinformant Juana Nazario (Aramoni Burguete 1990:150, 153).LifeinaCaveJosefina Romero was born in a cave in Tlalpan, Mexico City, in the 1930s, aswere her five brothers and sisters. The cavern—for that is what it was—gaveits name to the street, Calle de Cuevitas. The enormous cave was formed froma number of chambers. Smaller ones that led off the main area served as bed-rooms, kitchen, and so on.

Candles and oil burners provided light. ‘‘Aside fromcandles, there were dishes with petroleum, my mother soaked rags in this, therewere six on each side,’’ says Josefina. The entrance to the cave was very large.There was no door, because when Josefina was a child burglaries were rare inthat semirural area. Near the entrance, Josefina’s mother had her treadle sew-ing machine, and there was a table for meals and cutting fabric, for the childrento do homework, and for any other activity that required a flat space. The cavewas warm during the cold months and cool when it was hot outside. The fathersold charcoal and firewood—the latter could be collected in the neighborhood—which could be stored in one of the chambers. Mr. Romero was also acurandero,a healer, as his daughter Josefina would become.Curing was done by first sprinkling holy water—brought from the nearbySaint Augustine Church—on the floor of the cave, then by sweeping the floor;after this, cleansing ceremonies,limpias,were performed with different herbsand flowers. One of the major ceremonies carried out in the cave was the ritualdance, the Concheros. This dance, in which men, women, and children par-ticipate, and which supposedly is reminiscent of Aztec rites, is dedicated bothto religion and to pleasure and is performed along semimilitary lines, withstrict control over the participants. Josefina’s father was captain of his seventy-member group, all of whom practicedconcherodancing inside the cave, everymember carrying a candle. The cavern was so large that at times it accommo-dated one hundred dancers.Mexico City, however, grew to the south, the cornfields disappeared and be-came major avenues, buildings were constructed. Probably it was all this activitythat caused the cave to collapse with the whole Romero family inside. One ofthe new structures was a hospital, whose employees witnessed this disaster andthought everyone had been killed. Rescuers dug out the family, all of whomwere alive. The altar was untouched, and Josefina believes that the cave itselfprotected them. Not long after this Insurgentes Avenue covered what once wasthis grotto home.Caves can be dangerous. Sorcerers who are hired to harm people take ‘‘good’’offerings to a famous cave near Cuetzalan, the Chivostok. The offering consistsof copal, black hens, and liquor, among other things.Brujos,or sorcerers, can‘‘steal the soul’’ of individuals and perform other diabolical acts, but if the per-sons who have ordered these fail to cover the cost of the offerings and thebrujo’swork in the cave, themaleficio—the evil act or spell—has no effect (AramoniBurguete 1990:157).The Mixe area, like most of Mexico, is dotted with caves, all of which play asignificant role in religion and myth. They are used for curing and other rituals.The presence of archaeological objects indicates long, continued use. Among theMixe of Oaxaca, a great cavern in a hill called Tsinyuikyoy, ‘‘Enchanted Hill,’’"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Rites of Passage and Other Ceremonies29is said to be the home of the lords of rain and lightning. At midnight, whenthe big cave opens its mouth, people leave offerings of turkey, copal, incense,and other things (Aramoni Burguete 1990:147). Another cave,ma·sˆung hut,thecave ‘‘of the infants,’’ is considered to be the navel of the world, since the Sunand the Moon, the Four Winds, Thunder, and all things in the heavens and onearth are said to have issued from there (Lipp 1991:48). People, many of themcoming from far away, go to the caves to petition for wealth, and on New Year’sDay rites are carried out inside a cave on Granary Mountain for this reason.Many Mixes go to caves to ask for money and cattle from the divinities within.In return for riches granted, Ene, one of the divinities, asks only for sacrificialfowl (Lipp 1991:48).Tepoztlan, in the state of Morelos, is surrounded by dramatic mountains thatare the home of numerous caves. Rites have been carried out there since Pre-Hispanic times, and many continue to be observed today. Fiestas in honor ofSan Juan are held here, where much attention is paid to propitiating theaires,orwinds, calledhuentli.June 24 is the Day of Saint John, and the festivities beginon the twenty-third, when a good harvest is requested of thehuentli.Offeringshere and at a neighboring town, Coatetelco, are made to the sacred landscape,mainly in caves but also on the hills, in a lake, and even in ruins on a mountaintopcalled Moctezuma’s Place. These offerings to thehuentliare miniature vesselssimilar to some found in archaeological context and contain small amounts ofchicken,mole,and tamales. At Coatetelco these offerings are left very early onJune 24, and at 8:00pmaltars with food for thehuentli(bread,mole,chocolate,tamales wrapped in banana leaves) are placed in the church, accompanied bysongs and ceremonies. It is said that in the late nineteenth century a statue ofSaint John was placed in the lake at Coatetelco for a day so he would be sure toprovide the area with water all year (Druzo Maldonado, personal communica-tion, August 1994).San Andrés de la Cal is a village a short distance to the south of Tepoztlan.In theRelaciones geográficasit is called Acuecueyacan (Acuña 1985:185). Thereare many caves here, and offerings are made in most of them. When a processiongoes to the caves to propitiate thehuentli,a woman accompanies the procession,blowing a whistle to call these winds.At Xoxotzin hill, near Jojutla, offerings to thehuentliandtotheforcesofrainand agricultural sustenance are made on May 3, the Day of the Holy Cross, whenthe land and plants are honored all over Mexico. Until recently,graniceros,thosewho ‘‘control the weather,’’ climbed this hill during the festival in order to touchthe stones there. Dampness or lack of it on their hands told them if the comingmonths would bring rain or not (Druzo Maldonado, personal communication,August 1994).The great cave at Oztotempa, Guerrero, is well known. It is a natural fault"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"30Central Mexicotwo hundred meters in diameter and two hundred meters deep. At the bottomof this gigantic hole are four caves, says one informant, each one with a gardenwhere seeds of all kinds grow, but principally corn of many colors. These para-disiacal caves are guarded by four giants, each one related to a world quadrant.These giants—much like thetlaloqueof Pre-Hispanic myth—control the dif-ferent types of wind and rain and crack whips to make the noise of thunder.Tradition has it that when the Augustinian fathers came to this region in 1533,they destroyed themomoztlis,native altars, and the people threw their stone idolsinto the cave in order to preserve them, although they were then inaccessible.Today the people of thirty communities near Oztotempa petition for rain andthe blessing of seeds at the great hole. Participants start coming about two weeksin advance; the main ceremonies are on May 1 and 2, in honor of the Day of theHoly Cross on the third. About two thousand persons take part. At least onehundred crosses elaborately decorated with flowers, mostly marigolds, are takento the edge of the cave, where there is also a small chapel. Formal organizations,such asmayordomías,organize the rites, which include native dances, music, andofferings of food and candles in the church. Most important is the difficult six-kilometer climb up the mountain to Oztotempa from Attiaca or Zitlala, wheremost of the preparations have been made. At intervals each heavy wooden crossis again covered with garlands of flowers and candles and incense are burned.Farmers (as here all the men are) carry seeds to the chapel to be blessed. There isconstant music and songs, or, rather, prayers that are recited in a singsong voice.Offerings of food, flowers, and candles are placed around each cross around thecave and special offerings called ‘‘canastas’’ (baskets) are prepared.Canastasareparts of a maguey on a framework of twigs and covered with flowers, bread, fruit,chocolate, cigarettes, turkey cooked without salt, greenmole,fruits, and copal.As participants proceed to the cave they offer a prayer to each cross, and finallyprayers and incense are offered to the four world quadrants, to the cave, thewinds, the Cross, Saint Mark, Saint Isidore, and Saint Francis. Then turkeys,chickens, and thecanastasare thrown into the cave. With these rites the ar-rival of rain is ensured. If it does not come, the keepers of waters, winds, andagricultural benefits in the Oztotempa cave must be propitiated all over again(Sepúlveda 1973).There are ritual caves in the Chilapa and Tlapa municipalities, also in themountain region of Guerrero. One such cave is the Lagunita at Colotapec, re-cently closed off becausebrujerías,or witchcraft rites, were practiced there. Rockcarvings on the cave floor that supposedly were magic symbols caused authori-ties to take their drastic action. Before this, people from different villages cameto leave chickens, liquor, cigarettes, candles, bread, and cut paper in honor ofSaint Mark on his feast day, and also during Holy Week and at Christmastime.At the entrance to the cave there is a stalagmite two meters high that the people"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Rites of Passage and Other Ceremonies31believe is a statue of their saint, and here they place their offerings. Deeper intothe cave a stalagmite joins a stalactite, forming one column, which is said torepresent Jesus Christ. This sacred image also receives offerings. Even fartherin, a small cavity is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and candles are placed here,as well as liquor below it, on the cave floor (Samuel Villela, personal communi-cation, August 1994). It will be remembered that liquor has always been a ritualoffering in Mexico.On May 3, at Atenxoxola, at another cave, there are festivities for the HolyCross that include a rite of passage, the changing of themayordomoin charge ofthe ceremonies. Inside the cave there is a sacred spring (now blocked off with ametal railing because pilgrims at times bathed here) and six places where offer-ings are left. The offerings are curved branches covered with paper adornments;food, candles, and cigarettes are also left. In one of the chambers of the large cavetwo stalactites are identified as the Virgin Mary and a little goat. The goat alsoreceives offerings so that it will protect the people’s animals (informant RobertoMarcos Tepetlayehuca, reported by Samuel Villela, personal communication,August 1994).Death also finds its way into caves. After all, caves form the entrance to theUnderworld, which is not only Tlalocan, place of riches, but also Mictlan, Landof the Dead. Burgoa (1934:336), more than three hundred years ago, wrote ofcaves in the Mixtec region of Oaxaca that served as ‘‘doors to the inferno’’ andalso as funeral chambers for the ‘‘putrid mummies of their kings and lords.’’In northern Mexico there are many dry caves where ‘‘well-preserved remainsof Indians wrapped in cloth have been found,’’ according to some old accounts(Aveleyra et al. 1956). The colonial chronicler Pérez de Ribas describes a casein which a man was pulled by invisible hands into a cave where the skulls andskeletons of other unfortunate persons were found. Hearing his cries for help,the townspeople together with two priests went to the cave, where the priestsexorcised the man and all the skeletal remains, then they baptized the entirelocal population. Of course these bones were not what had been left after thedevil had consumed the humans, as some thought, but must have been fromancient burials; nevertheless, they served a purpose in converting the people toChristianity (Pérez de Ribas 1944:213).In many of the Pre-Hispanic monthly fiestas the sacrificial victims were in-terred in caves. Children offered to the mountain-water goddess, Iztaccihuatl,whose image was kept in a cave in the dead volcano, were sacrificed in the samecave (Durán 1977:248, 250). Herrera (1945:307) says that when a cacique, orruler, died, his body was preserved by a fire ritual and then, mummified, wasplaced in a cave. Motolinía (1941:50) describes the sacrifice to Tlaloc of chil-dren whose bodies were placed in a cave, which was then sealed until the ritualwas repeated the following year. It has been suggested that this human offering"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"32Central Mexicoto rain deities and to a cave may have taken place in the cave (see Figure 2.4)beneath the Pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan (Heyden 1975). Today in Zon-golica, Veracruz, it is believed that babies who die before they are baptized aretransformed intotlatzinihkeh,bearers of thunder and lightning who live in caves(Martínez and Reyes 1970:544).Caves, like mountains and water holes, are sacred all over the world. In Mex-ico caves have always been used for rituals. The rites cover the life cycle of peopleand of phenomena; they observe all steps from birth to death.AcknowledgmentsA version of part of this chapter was published in Instituto Nacional de Antro-pología e Historia,Boletín,época 2, no. 19, (1976).

Probably as a result of El Niño, the region was suffer-ing from the worst drought in living memory, and the corn and other crops onwhich these people depended for food were threatened by the extreme condi-tions. The air was filled day and night with thick smoke from innumerable forestfires burning out of control more than a hundred miles to the west in the cen-tral highlands of Mexico. People were worried about the drought, and, clearly,something had to be done.The pilgrimage was organized by Encarnación Téllez Hernández, known byeveryone as Cirilo, a powerful shaman, or ritual specialist, from the Nahua vil-lage of Amatlán (a pseudonym) where I have conducted ethnographic field re-search since 1970.2I knew that the situation must be grave for the people ofAmatlán and their neighbors because of the enormous cost of organizing sucha pilgrimage measured in money, goods, time, and effort. I learned that Cirilo,a man in his early seventies and a renowned ritual specialist, had visited theseimportant caves only twice before.As a longtime resident in the village, I was invited to contribute to the effortand to document the ritual events. In this chapter, I will discuss the logic of thepilgrimage in the context of contemporary Nahua religion and worldview. Inparticular, I would like to offer an interpretation of how Nahua views of caves,pyramids, and sacred mountains offer insight into indigenous thought in theMesoamerica culture area. I make the case that contemporary beliefs and prac-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"36Central Mexicotices of the Nahua and other Native American groups provide valuable informa-tion by which we can better understand enigmatic aspects of the rich archaeo-logical and ethnohistorical record of Mesoamerica (Heyden 1981:28; see Stone1995:11–12, for a discussion of cultural continuity in Mesoamerica).Northern Veracruz, where Amatlán is located, forms part of a region alongthe Gulf Coast in East-Central Mexico known as the Huasteca. Named for theMaya-speaking Huastec who today live in the northern parts of the region, theHuasteca is composed of portions of six states: Veracruz, Puebla, Querétaro,Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, and Tamaulipas. The Huasteca is renowned through-out Mexico as a wild and lawless frontier inhabited by cowboys, ranchers, andIndians. In addition to the Huastec, members of Pame, Otomí, Tepehua, Toto-nac, and Nahua ethnic groups also live in the Huasteca, typically in small, re-mote villages far from paved roads and urban amenities. According to the 1990census, 431,805 Nahua (people who speak the Nahuatl language) aged five yearsor older live in the ninety-two municipalities that make up the Huasteca re-gion (Sandstrom 1995:184). Most people make a living through slash-and-burnmilpa horticulture mixed with small-scale animal husbandry and temporarywage labor on local ranches or in cities. With few reliable government servicesand little or no access to financial institutions, the indigenous peoples of the re-gion are dependent on their crops and the weather in a way that is difficult formost Euro-Americans to understand.Despite missionary efforts by the Catholic Church in the Huasteca begin-ning in the sixteenth century and the more recent incursion of U.S. Protestantmissionaries, a large number of indigenous people in the Huasteca continue tofollow the beliefs and practices of Native American religions (see Sandstrom1994, 2001a). Ethnographers have begun to document and clarify some of thesereligions (Báez-Jorge and Gómez Martínez 1998; Gómez Martínez 1999, 2002;Ichon 1973; Leynes and Olguín 1993; Martínez de la Cruz 2000; MedellínZenil 1982; Mönnich 1976; Reyes García and Christensen 1976; Signorini andLupo 1989; Williams García 1963). Beliefs, rituals, and myths among differ-ent indigenous groups trace to common Mesoamerican roots and demonstrateremarkable correspondences to religious practices recorded by the sixteenth-century chroniclers, despite local variations brought about by internal develop-ment and nearly five hundred years of traumatic historical events. Participants inlocal rituals address a pantheon of spirits that traces directly to the Pre-Hispanicera or syncretizes Native American and sixteenth-century Spanish Catholicsacred personages. Ritual events involve ancient or syncretic practices such asconstruction of elaborate altars, blood sacrifice, sacred paper cutting, divinationthrough casting corn kernels or crystal gazing, circumambulation of sacred sites,chanting, dancing, pilgrimages to distant sacred locations, and the dedicationof offerings to springs, mountaintops, and caves."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua37The Nahua of northern Veracruz commonly use the Spanish loanwordcuevafor ‘‘cave.’’ When pressed, they call a cave ‘‘teotlacoyontli,’’ meaning ‘‘divine hole’’or ‘‘sacred hole.’’ They call the sacred hills that dot the landscape ‘‘santo tepemej,’’a mixed Spanish-Nahuatl phrase meaning ‘‘sacred hills.’’ For the Nahua andother indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica, the landscape is a cognized environ-ment (Rappaport 1979:5). Each bog, spring, plain, or hill is named and plays arole in the religious conceptions of the sacred landscape. The people identify verystrongly with their local environment, which for them is an emotionally chargedfield where cosmic forces are played out. Almost every ritual entails visiting anatural site that has sacred connotations or, in some cases, one of the ancientPre-Columbian ruins that are ubiquitous in the Huasteca. I asked a number ofvillagers to draw a map of the region for me, assuming that they would outlinethe area. Instead, they drew a series of dots corresponding to named features ofthe landscape. The dots were orientation points, significant to anyone familiarwith the region.It was difficult for me at first to grasp the degree to which the Nahua attributemeaning to the geographic features of their surroundings. For example, peopledivide their communities into units based on some physical feature of the set-ting. They often identify more strongly with the named section in which theylivethanwiththevillageasawhole.Inapracticecalled‘‘caltocayotl,’’ the Nahuaname their individual houses after an anomalous or striking geographic feature.Families may also practice toponymy, whereby they assume the house label astheir surname. Thus a man named Juan Hernández Hernández, to distinguishhimself from others with this common surname, would take on his house nameand be known as Juan Tlamaya, or Juan Flat Place, to his neighbors (see Sand-strom 2000).Much of the dynamic of Nahua religion derives from close observations ofthe processes of nature. Natural phenomena incorporated by the Nahua into arich symbolic system include not only the human body and certain psychologicalstates such as fear or anger, but also animal behavior, weather phenomena, geo-logical features, topography, light, plant life, and changing states and sources ofwater, for example, fog, mist, dew, hail, clouds, springs, streams, rivers, lakes, oroceans. I suspect that the ideology of the great urban religions of Pre-HispanicMesoamerica as recorded by the chroniclers was also largely based on close ob-servation of natural phenomena (see Bassie-Sweet 1996:xvi; McKeever Furst1995). At one level of analysis, contemporary Nahua hold rituals to achieve a bal-ance between humans and personified forces of nature such as rain, wind, plantfertility, the sun, and earth. The rituals are a type of exchange so that people arepositioned to receive from the spirit realm the flow of benefits that are neces-sary for their lives. But the Nahua have a complex view of the cosmos and theplace of humans in relation to these natural forces (see Sandstrom 1991, 1998)."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"38Central MexicoThus, at a deeper level of analysis, they use nature as a metaphor for thinkingabout the world, about each other, and about the events in which they are en-meshed. Their myths are filled with tales of animals whose experiences are theconsequence of their nature.The human life cycle of birth, growth, maturity, old age, and death is alsomirrored in the life cycle of the corn plant. Even the human body is modeled onthe corn plant, considered by the Nahua to be the source of human life (Sand-strom 1998). The tassel is the hair, the stalk, the body, and the roots are thefeet. People told me on many occasions that the mature corn plant awaiting theharvest was an old woman holding the precious ear of corn wrapped in leaves,like a baby in swaddling clothes. Of course, people in all cultures to some extentturn their observations of nature into metaphors to describe and understand theevents of their lives. We say that greedy people are pigs or that an aggressiveperson who demands money is a shark. But for people from Judeo-Christian orIslamic traditions, it is imagery from sacred scripture that occupies their religiousconceptions in the same way that observations of nature do for the indigenouspeople of Mesoamerica.For the Nahua, human beings represent an anomaly in the natural order.With their willful behavior and speech they can disrupt the smooth workings ofthe cosmos in a way that no other sentient creature can. Humans are modeled onnature, but at the same time they are apart from nature. Through their actions,people tend to disturb the natural flow of benefits that circulate throughout theuniverse. Their thoughts and behavior create obstacles to the normal operationof natural forces that supply humankind with life’s necessities. The thoughts andactions of humans, although set apart from the workings of the natural world,sometimes have dire consequences for the natural processes that surround them.Extreme behavior of any sort, especially acts of disrespect, lack of generosity, orgossip and lying, can wreak havoc and cause disease, death, or misfortunes suchas drought or earthquake.From the Nahua perspective, nature is not always beneficent, and absolutegood or evil does not characterize the major spirit entities. A benevolent mani-festation of the earth mother,tonantsij,may kill if she feels neglected, while eventhe feared spirit of death,miquilistli,can be entreated to spare a patient’s life.In the Nahua view, nothing happens without a cause. The disastrous drought of1998, according to the shaman Cirilo, was caused by rich (i.e., nonindigenous)people failing to respect the earth. He accused them of soiling or polluting theearth through their activities and neglecting to enter into proper exchange withthe earth spirit in compensation. Here we have an example of class conscious-ness entering into the interpretation of natural disaster, all encompassed withinthe context of Nahua religious belief. The purpose of the pilgrimage to the caveswas to dedicate offerings directly to the water spirit and to her various alter egos"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua39and helpers. Through the vehicle of these offerings, the people hoped to removethe obstacles placed there by the activities of the rich and to restore the benefitsintrinsic to the exchange between humans and the forces of nature.Preparations for the pilgrimage of 1998 took several months. Nearly half ofthe residents of Amatlán had converted to one Protestant sect or another by thelate 1990s, and so Cirilo sent word to ritual specialists and interested partici-pants in neighboring villages to advise them about the pilgrimage and to involvethem in the planning. Altogether, fifty or sixty people, including Nahua andOtomí, agreed to contribute to the effort through gifts of money and labor andto ascend the sacred mountain to deliver the offerings to the caves.For Cirilo the pilgrimage was the event of a lifetime, and he worked very hardto make sure that it was organized properly. He amassed food and offerings, con-tracted with guitarists and violinists to play the sacred music, collected moneyand made needed purchases at regional markets, notified keepers of the shrine atthe base of the sacred mountain, and secured permission from regional govern-mental officials to hold the pilgrimage. He prepared himself and his family fora ritual observance that would disrupt their daily routine for nearly two weeks.Cirilo asked me to participate, and I gladly accepted. I was joined by my wife,Pamela, who has accompanied me to the field since the mid-1970s, and by ourfifteen-year-old son, Michael. All of us eagerly took part in the exciting prepa-rations. I also received permission to invite two Mexican anthropologists, twograduate students in anthropology (one a native Nahuatl speaker), and a videocamera operator to attend the ritual and accompany us on the pilgrimage. Cirilowas clearly pleased to have the visitors along so that they could witness thebeauty of this heartfelt appeal for rain.The Huastecan Nahua understanding of how and why it rains is a combina-tion of religious belief and scientific observation. Put another way, their under-standing is a symbolic rendering of empirical fact. Amatlán is located in thefoothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental range, which runs along Mexico’s eastcoast. To the west of the village, the chain of mountain peaks, some reaching oversix thousand feet, forms a continuous wall or escarpment. About seventy miles tothe east of the village lies the Gulf of Mexico. The climate of the region betweenthe mountains and the Gulf Coast is tropical and humid, supporting the north-ernmost reach of tropical forests in the Western Hemisphere. Steep and choppyfoothills give way to coastal plain as one approaches or moves northward alongthe coast. Until very recently, the region was penetrated by few roads, and it ishere in this remote area where some of the most traditional Native Americansin Mesoamerica live. The rainy season begins around mid-May, when moisture-laden air from the gulf is lofted upward, moving westward toward the moun-tains. The onset of the dry season begins in about mid-November and ends withthe buildup of clouds and eventual rainfall the following May. Even in good"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"40Central Mexicoyears the rain is unevenly distributed throughout the region. One area may benearly flooded while milpas just thirty-five or forty miles away will be too dryto sustain crops. The problem faced by the people of the region is that there iseither too little or too much rain in a given period at a given location. The Nahuararely ask directly for rain during their rituals. Instead, they ask for balance andharmony so that the right amount of rain will fall on their fields.The people have observed these weather patterns and have developed elabo-rate myths to explain them. They link the irregular rainfall patterns to the un-stable personality of a water spirit who lives at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.The Nahua call this spiritsahua,a modification of the Spanish San Juan (SaintJohn), an obvious blending of a traditional Native American spirit with a biblicalfigure who is closely associated with water. This important spirit was born insidea squash, a clear analogy to birth inside a dark cave.Sahuawas a disobedientand violent child who frequently injured his companions and age mates in fits oftemper. As he grew to adulthood he became even more violent and threateningto the people around him. Finally, the people acted and threw a party for him.Aftersahuabecame drunk, the people jumped on him and pinned him down,took him to the Gulf Coast and chained him to the bottom of the sea, wherehe remains to this day. His fits of rage are reflected in the numerous storms thatcome from his watery domain to the east. In this myth, the Nahua recognizethat rain originates from the Gulf and that rainwater is ultimately water fromthe sea.The Nahua and other indigenous peoples of the region link rain to a sacredmountain that lies near the Nahua town of Ichcacuatitla in themunicipioof Chi-contepec, northern Veracruz (see Williams García 1957). The mountain is calledPostectli or Postectitla, meaning ‘‘broken place’’ or ‘‘broken hill’’ in Nahuatl,and it is where participants in the pilgrimage directed their appeal for relief fromdrought. Postectli is a remarkable landmark that can be seen for many milesaround. Although it looms on the northern horizon, about ten hours’ walk fromAmatlán, it is clearly visible from high places in the village. The mountain isthe gigantic remnant of a volcanic core that juts up almost vertically some twothousand feet from the surrounding plain. The enormous rock stands alone anddwarfs everything else around it—a most impressive natural formation. From adistance, the rocky core gives the impression of having been broken off at thetop, hence its name. This singular mountain is so high that its peak sometimesthrusts up into the clouds as they move from the gulf to the mountains. Vil-lagers told me that when the distant peak was obscured by clouds, it was a suresign that rain was on the way.They also told me that near the summit of Postectli there are two caves, oneof which is home to the thunder spirit and the other to an alter ego or aspect ofsahuacalledapanchanej. Apanchanejmeans ‘‘water dweller’’ in Nahuatl, and in"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua41Spanish, she is calledla sirena,‘‘the siren.’’ The spirit is conceived as a femalewith long hair and a fish’s tail in place of legs, much like a mermaid in Euro-American tradition. Among her many functions she protects women from abu-sive husbands and is mistress of the fish. Most important, from her cave homeon Postectli she sends rain to the fields.Apanchanejexists in many forms (Gómez Martínez 1999). Villagers describedher sometimes as a girl and at other times as a woman, a man, or even a lizard.While her home is Postectli, she also lives wherever there is fresh water, andpeople leave offerings to her at springs, streams, pools, and lakes. She is servedby the clouds (mixtli,singular in Nahuatl) who take the form of twelve dwarf-like old men called ‘‘pilhuehuentsitsij.’’ These servants of the water spirit carrywater from the gulf to the cave at the top of Postectli so thatapanchanejcan dis-tribute the precious liquid to the growing fields. Thepilhuehuentsitsijare dressedin black clothing with rubber sleeves and are ranked in status. Each carries awalking stick that is struck as he travels along, causing lightning and thunder.Nahua conceptions of weather and the origin of rain are phrased within asymbolic and religious framework, but they are reasonably accurate as modernscientific formulations. In fact, the clouds form as the moisture-laden air comesin off the Gulf of Mexico, carrying water to the fields. Rain is indeed imminentwhen the peak of Postectli is obscured by clouds. Water does exist in changingstates and locales. One question that needs to be addressed, however, concernsthe symbolic and empirical basis for the Nahua conviction that water emanatesfrom caves.It is highly likely that the symbolic link between water and caves is based onstraightforward observation (see Vogt 1969:387, for a similar observation amongthe contemporary Maya). Many caves are moist, and water can be seen drip-ping from the ceiling or pooling in cavities deep in the interior. Some researchersmaintain that Pre-Hispanic people believed the earth was floating on water andthat caves were passageways to this primordial liquid (Bassie-Sweet 1996:21; seealso Redfield 1941:118, and Redfield and Villa Rojas 1964:164–165, for relatedbeliefs among contemporary Maya, but see also Villa Rojas 1945:134, whoseinformants were unable to draw the connection between caves and the sea). Forthe Maya, caves became sources for so-called virgin water—underground waterthat had never flowed on the surface of the earth. Archaeologists have found an-cient Maya pots left in caves beneath dripping stalactites to collect the preciousliquid for use in rituals (Thompson 1959:124ff.).The Aztecs may have had a similar belief regarding cave water: ‘‘The ceremo-nially bathed [victims] or those who die the flowery death were bathed in sacredwater. The old men of thecalpulliwould get the water; they got the water there atUitzilopochco; there indeed was [the spring called] Uitzilatl, in a cave (Sahagún1950–82, pt. 3, bk. 2:141; see Bonor 1989:102–104, and Stone 1995:34–44, for"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"42Central Mexicoa general account of Mesoamerican cave symbolism; see Alcorn 1984:80–86,for an account of modern Huastec beliefs about caves). However, I have notfound corresponding beliefs among the Huastecan Nahua regarding caves andvirgin water. The people of Amatlán sometimes conceive of the earth as a rounddisk, like acomali(a clay griddle for cooking tortillas) surrounded by water. Theearth’s surface is also conceived of as the back of a giant lizard or caiman float-ing in the water. But I have not documented a belief that caves are passagewaysto a primordial water source. Nor have I confirmed that because people observewater inside caves do they directly associate caves with the origin of rain. TheNahua of Amatlán, however, have elaborated a complex set of beliefs linkingcaves with water. They symbolically connect the two phenomena in the contextof yet another widely held conception of the earth, namely, that it exists in theform of a human body.In 1980, Alfredo López Austin, inCuerpo humano e ideología: Las concepcionesde los antiguos nahuas(published in English in 1988 asThe Human Body and Ideol-ogy: Concepts of the Ancient Nahua), established the central symbolic importanceof the human body in Pre-Hispanic thought. Likewise, a number of anthro-pologists, among them, Turner (1967:90) and Douglas (1978:101), argue thatthe body is the source for symbolic systems and classifications for most of theworld’s cultures. The religions of Mesoamerica present what may be an extremecase of the metaphoric use of the human body. Along with other ethnographersworking in Mesoamerica, I have found that the human physical form continuesto be a key symbol in the religious ideology of contemporary indigenous people(Sandstrom 1998; see also Armoni 1990; Galinier 1990; Signorini and Lupo1989).Once I became aware of the importance of the body as a metaphor for theNahua, I began to see evidence of its use in many symbolic contexts. Shamansinformed me that the earth itself (in Nahuatl,tlali) is alive and exists in humanform. The soil is its flesh, rocks are its bones, and water is its blood. The moun-tains correspond to the earth’s head, the plains beneath the mountains are itsbody, and the feet are in the underworld.3In sum, for most Nahua, the earth is literally alive and requires recompensefor any human activity that disturbs or injures its physical body. Here is an ex-ample of one of the challenges to understanding Mesoamerican religious tra-ditions, for as noted earlier, the earth is simultaneously described as a circulararea surrounded by water and as the back of a caiman. For the Nahua, the spiritsexist in multiple, constantly shifting forms that make systematic classificationand analysis by outsiders very difficult.Pamela Effrein Sandstrom and I have described elsewhere how the humanform represents the principle of animation in contemporary Nahua religioussymbolism (Sandstrom and Sandstrom 1986:279). We argue in that work that"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua43religion for the Nahua and other indigenous groups in Mesoamerica is basi-cally pantheistic; that is, the cosmos itself is the deity, and all apparent diver-sity and separation among objects and beings is illusory (Sandstrom 1991:238–239; Sandstrom and Sandstrom 1986:275–277; see also Heyden 1981:6; Hunt1977:55; Monaghan 2000:27–28). Pantheism differs from polytheism in thebelief that a fundamental unity underlies apparent diversity, with all of the spiritspersonifying aspects or manifestations of a single divine principle. Pantheismalso differs from monotheism in that God and the creation are indivisible. InChristianity, for example, God is separate from and responsible for the creation,and pantheism is thus considered to be heresy. The pantheistic nature of indige-nous Mesoamerican religions helps explain why traditional deities seem to meldinto one another, their attributes and changing guises in constant flux, alwaysreinterpreted and reinvented. Witness the multiple manifestations of the earthdescribed previously. The apparent fluidity of the Mesoamerican pantheon ofspirits is problematic and confusing only to people socialized in a monotheisticor polytheistic tradition.Viewing indigenous Mesoamerican religions as pantheistic also helps explainwhy spirit entities so often are simultaneously conceived as salutary and danger-ous. Deities cannot easily be relegated to good or evil domains, because they areexpressions of a sacred unity that encompasses all that exists. In pantheism thecosmos itself is alive and everything in it surges with divine energy. In this sys-tem of thought, distinctions between animate or inanimate, alive or dead, andgood or evil are meaningless. The human form in Nahua religion symbolizes thesacred animating principle that lies at the heart of existence.The human form truly permeates Nahua religious conceptions and explana-tions of natural phenomena. For them, the sky is a giant anthropomorphic mir-ror, with its feet lying in the east and its head in the west. Divination crystals aresaid by shamans to have a head, a body, and feet. As already noted, the Nahuaconceive of the corn plant as having human form and describe the growth ofthe corn plant as reproducing the stages of human development. Thus, whenyoung, the corn plant is a brother-sister pair, each with hair the color of cornsilk, and called, respectively, Seven-Flower and Five-Flower. When it is readyto harvest, the mature corn plant is conceived of as an old woman holding theswaddled baby—the ripened ear of corn—in her arms.Examples of how the Nahua use the human body as a metaphor for thinkingand talking about the world could be extended indefinitely. Probably the clearestexample of the importance of the human form for the Nahua can be seen in theiruse of remarkable, anthropomorphic cut-paper figures to represent spirit entitiesin their rituals. The shamanic art of paper cutting traces to the Pre-Hispanic eraand survives only in a small region of East-Central Mexico (see Sandstrom andSandstrom 1986). Given the abstract nature of the religion and the reluctance of"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"44Central Mexicomost ritual specialists to discuss esoteric aspects of their work, the paper figuresprovide valuable, tangible clues about the content of Nahua beliefs and ritualpractices. Shamans use scissors to cut the shapes from handmade or industri-ally manufactured paper. For a simple cure, the ritual specialist may cut only afew dozen images. For the pilgrimage to Postectli, the participating shamansprobably produced about sixteen thousand cut-paper images. Depending on theritual occasion, images may be created to represent literally anything in the cos-mos, including disease-causing spirits, seeds, water spirits, aspects of the earth,and even inanimate objects such as walking sticks, hills, clouds, or the dew. Theimages may vary in form, size, and color; however, at the center of each cuttingis a small human form, typically with the hands held alongside the head. Cutfrom the body or from the silhouette of a figure are iconographic representa-tions that allow people to identify the spirit. For example, wavy lines cut in thebody identifymixtli,the cloud spirit, while rib holes cut from the body identifydisease-causing spirits of the dead.Figures 3.1–3.18 (see the following section) are a sample of some of theimages cut by Nahua ritual specialists. They include a number of water and hillspirits as well as a disease-causing wind spirit and the spirit of the sun. Notethe human form at the center of each image along with the identifying icono-graphic features. It is this human form that symbolizes the animating principleof a particular entity and links the spirit to the sacred cosmos of which it is an in-dissoluble part. The human form also symbolizes the unity that lies at the heartof apparent diversity and communicates the living nature of the universe. Ritualspecialists often cut a great number of different paper images to represent spiritentities relevant to the particular ritual occasion at hand. But in the end, theseparate spirits return to the unity from which they are temporarily abstracted.On the one hand, contemporary Nahua deities are thought of as sentientbeings with individual personalities and ever-changing characters, filled withthe contradictions and uncertainties of human experiences of the world. Theycan also be interpreted more like impersonal energy fields instead of discretepersonalities. They distill Nahua experience with the natural and social environ-ments and thus serve as analytical devices for understanding and managing acomplex, multifaceted universe. The Nahua extend experiences with the bodyto encompass key aspects of an unpredictable and insecure world. They are ex-plicit in stating that human activities such as planting a field or burning brushannoy the earth, in much the same way a human being would be irritated bybeing poked or burned. Cirilo, the lead ritual specialist in the pilgrimage to thesacred caves, was equally explicit in stating that the earth enjoys food, Presidentebrandy, and tobacco, just as humans do. Through ritual offerings, he and his fel-low shamans attempt to redress the imbalances that accumulate in the humanand spirit interchange brought about by selfish and antisocial conduct."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua45Not surprisingly, one of the greatest uncertainties for the Nahua is balancingtheir need for water. The Nahua know that water in the form of rain fertilizesthe fields and makes the crops grow. As mentioned previously, they also knowthat the water ultimately comes from the sea—the Gulf of Mexico—and it iscarried inland by thepilhuehuentsitsij,dwarfish old men dressed in black, whoare clearly metaphors for the clouds. The water is distributed byapanchanej,thewater spirit, from her cave at the top of Postectli. The cave, then, is a source offertility, and it is from caves that life-giving water makes its way to the growingcrops that support human populations.The close connection between the earth and the fertilizing rain is ancient inMesoamerican thought. The name of the Aztec rain deity, Tlaloc, for example,contains the root for earth (tlali). But the key to understanding the contempo-rary Nahua association of caves with water lies in their conception that the earthexists in human form. They say that the mountains are like the earth’s head andthe water is the earth’s blood. I conclude that caves as a metaphor for fertility arelike vaginas or wombs—body parts that are productive of human life and all thatmakes human life possible (see Brady 1988; Heyden 1991; also Grove 1970 for apioneering study linking caves to eroticism and procreation in Mesoamerica). Inmenstruation, the vagina-womb yields blood, the carrier ofchicahualistli,or thesupreme energy source for life, just as caves produce water, the earth’s blood andthe source of life for the corn. The vagina-womb also gives forth water immedi-ately before the emergence of a baby. No villager ever articulated the parallelsbetween vagina or womb and cave, and I am uncertain whether anyone makesthe connection consciously. However, examination of ritual practice and themesin myths makes a convincing case that such a symbolic connection is an impor-tant feature of Nahua religious belief. Nahua use of the human body as a keysymbol in their religious conceptions is an ancient idea, widespread throughoutPre-Hispanic Mesoamerica, and the contemporary concept should help ethno-historians and archaeologists interpret their research findings.One of the most important deities or spirit entities for contemporary Nahuaistonantsij,‘‘our sacred mother,’’ who is known to outsiders as the Virgin ofGuadalupe. This female deity has roots in the Pre-Hispanic era and spans thedivide between Pre-Christian and postconquest Catholic Mexico. Guadalupe/tonantsijenjoys an enormous popularity in contemporary Mexico, where she hasattained the status of patron saint of the country. For the Nahua of Amatlán,tonantsijis closely associated with the earth and both human and crop fertility inher guise as a manifestation or aspect of the water spirit (Sandstrom 1982). TheNahua often tell how she dwells in the cave on Postectli from which vantage sheoversees crop growth and the human production of children. In the cave withher are her own children, the seed spirits who control the fertility of specificcrops. In the mythic past,tonantsijallowed these seed children to leave the cave"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"46Central Mexicoand live in villages like Amatlán so that they could better support the humanpopulation. There they remain to this day. Here again we have caves associatedwith female spirits responsible for fertility.Nahua shamans keep on their altars a special sealed box handmade fromteo-cuahuitl,or ‘‘sacred wood,’’ which houses a permanent collection of cut-paperimages of the seed spirits. Each image is dressed in a tiny cloth outfit that cor-responds to traditional Nahua male or female costume. Male images are dressedin white shirt and white pants, and female images are dressed in long skirts withembroidered blouses (like adult women) or one-piece dresses (like girls). Thefemale images are provided with necklaces, earrings, hair combs, and other tinyadornments, while male figures may have hats. In some boxes, the shaman hasprovided miniature furniture and other accouterments to make the spirits feelat home. From fifty to one hundred images may be preserved in the woodenbox, which is opened only for major crop-fertility rituals. On such occasions, thepaper images are removed and undressed and their clothing carefully washed,dried, and then replaced in an unhurried, daylong ceremony.Shamans told me that for the seeds to continue to provide for the people, itis important that they be treated hospitably and kept in comfortable surround-ings. People must refrain from fighting or causing trouble in the village, or thestrife and disharmony will cause the seeds to return to their cave home, with theresult that people will starve. For Pre-Hispanic peoples as well, humans wereentrusted with corn only if they behaved properly (Bassie-Sweet 1996:12). Thespecial wooden box on the ritual specialist’s altar represents the cave home ofthe seeds.4Tonantsijherself is the subject of a winter solstice ritual calledtlacatililis(‘‘birth’’ in Nahuatl), held between December 21 and 24. During this time theparticipating shamans remove the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe from hershrine, and a procession of unmarried girls, over the four-day period, carries thestatue from house to house and performs a brief ritual at each stop. Each house-hold erects a small altar to receivetonantsijin hopes that she will bless the familyand crops with fertility.Tonantsijis carried throughout the village in a woodenbox representing her cave home, which is sometimes painted blue to associate itwith water.There are many additional examples of how the Nahua connect fertility withcaves, but I will limit the discussion to just a few. I have recorded portions ofan elaborate myth cycle chronicling the adventures of Seven-Flower, orchicomexochitl,the most important manifestation of the corn spirit (Sandstrom andGómez Martínez, Forthcoming). Corn is such a crucial part of the diet thatthis spirit has come to stand in for all of the crops grown in the fields. As men-tioned earlier, Seven-Flower is conceived of as a small blond boy who, along withhis sister Five-Flower, ormacuili xochitl,is responsible for bringing corn to the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua47people. Seven-Flower’s mother istonantsij,who, just before he was born, livedwith her mother.Tonantsij’smotherwasakindofwitch,ortsitsimitl,and wasextremely jealous of her beautiful daughter. She was so afraid that the daughterwould marry and abandon her that she kept the girl in a large clay vessel called achachapaliand let her out only when the girl went to the spring with her carryingpot to supply the house with water. The clay vessel clearly represents the cave-vagina-womb enclosure where fertility, personified bytonantsij,is safeguardedfrom potential suitors.In one version of the mythtonantsijfinds a crystal in the spring and puts itin her mouth so that her mother will not see it. She accidentally swallows thecrystal and becomes pregnant. In another version, she meets a handsome youngman on the trail back from the spring and, as they are parting, he promises tosee her again. When she turns to look at him, she sees a beautiful deer boundingaway. That evening, the mother hears talking and laughing from inside the clayvessel. She peeks in and sees that a flea has gotten in with her daughter and thatthe two are engaged in animated conversation. The flea is really the young man,who in transformed guise, is the deer spirit,masatl.In the end, the daughterbecomes pregnant and eventually gives birth to the corn twins. Here again wehave cave symbolism closely associated with fertility.Seven-Flower’s grandmother so resents the male child that after several epi-sodes in which she tries various ways to kill him, he escapes and goes to hide outin a cave in the interior of Postectli. Here we have an example of bad behaviordriving the seed spirit back to the cave dwelling. At the time of these events, themountain was whole and served as a link between the earthly and the celestialrealms. During the corn spirit’s absence, the people begin to starve and even-tually are driven in desperation to search for him. The search proves fruitlessuntil villagers notice red ants carrying kernels of corn from a cave on the moun-tainside. After several failed attempts to break open the mountain and releaseSeven-Flower, the people persuadesahua,the water spirit who lives in the Gulfof Mexico (and an alter ego ofapanchanej,who, as mentioned previously, washimself born in a cavelike squash) to use his force against the mighty rock. Hesucceeds in smashing the mountain in a fiery cataclysm, thus freeing the cornspirit from his cave enclosure. Again we witness water acting to yield the life-giving crop and save humanity from starvation, and we also see that corn itselforiginates in a cave. The myth provides an explanation for the broken appear-ance of Postectli today and records the primordial events that separated humansfrom the celestial realm.Like most sacred symbols, caves have multiple meanings or perhaps representmultiple aspects of a complex meaning system. In addition to their associationwith the vagina or womb and fertility, caves for the Nahua may represent am-biguous places or transitional passages between states of being. In one episode"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"48Central Mexicoof the Seven-Flower myth cycle, the corn spirit’s grandmother tries to kill himby locking him inside a sweat bath. The sweat bath, calledtemascaliin Nahuatl,meaning ‘‘stone house,’’ is frequently employed by Pre-Hispanic peoples as ametaphor for a cave (Heyden 1981:17). She tricks him into entering and thenpiles on firewood in order to roast him alive. After a lengthy period, she opensthe door and the boy emerges unscathed. Seven-Flower then tricks his grand-mother into the sweat bath and she is reduced to ashes. He asks the toad to carrythe ashes to the sea in a closed clay vessel reminiscent of the cave where the cornspirit was conceived. The toad hears rustling noises in the vessel and, contraryto instructions, opens it to see what is inside. This act releases all of the stinginginsects in the world. Interestingly, when the toad throws the ashes into the sea,they turn into the caiman, whose back becomes the earth on which people live.In this narration, the sweat–bath cave is a place of trial and impending death.The Nahua tell another story about a monkey who kidnaps a woman andkeeps her in a cave to prevent her from escaping and to hide her from her rela-tives. The monkey is very strong and places a huge rock in front of the entrance.Eventually the woman gives birth to a hairy child who in the end kills his animalfather and releases his mother from captivity. Here we have a cave as a prison,with mother and child caught between the human and the animal realms.The counterparts to caves in Nahua thought are the mountains. As men-tioned, Amatlán is located in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental and theterrain is punctuated by steep hills. Each of these hills and peaks has a nameand a role in local mythology. During field research, when I constructed a mapshowing the locations of sacred hills named by shamans, I was surprised at thenumber they identified. I was also surprised to learn that the sacred geogra-phy extended many miles in all directions from the village, including even thefamous mountains Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl as far away as Mexico City.Most traditional Nahua consider hills to be spirit presences standing guard overthe inhabitants of villages. Hills are also considered to be the source of desir-able things such as wealth and rain. As we might expect among a people witha pantheistic religion and worldview, the landscape is literally alive and plays asignificant role in Nahua thought. Hills are looming presences, and their sheermass ensures that they possess a large share of the cosmic divinity. They are theface and head of the earth and a commanding presence always standing watchover the ‘‘earthly sprouts,’’ as shamans refer to human beings in their chants(Bassie-Sweet 1996:11; Sandstrom 1998).What seems particularly to intrigue the Nahua are anomalies of geography,for example, hills associated with lakes or caves. The sacred pilgrimage site ofLa Laguna in the nearby state of Puebla is a small pond located near the sum-mit of a mountain. Postectli is a bizarre geological formation that features caveentrances near its summit. Other sacred sites include deep holes on the side or"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua49top of mountains, or springs flowing from cave entrances. These sites are rankedin importance by shamans, and each is visited during specific ritual occasions.It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of hills in the religious ideologyof the Nahua. During rituals to cure a patient with a particularly serious af-fliction, the ritual specialist, the patient, and the patient’s family will visit thepeak of a hill to dedicate offerings to the hill spirit. The offering is designedto enlist the help of the hill spirit in watching over the patient and protectinghim or her from harm. I have witnessed ritual offerings in Amatlán that wereheld to protect elected village authorities against disease or harm during theirterm of office. The ritual specialist symbolically cleansed each man, dedicatedofferings to house guardian spirits, and led the men to the peak of a nearby hill.There the specialist laid out a complex altar on the ground to feed the spirit ofthe hill in hopes that it would watch over the men while they carried out theirofficial duties on behalf of the village. Nahua shamans also cut a special paperimage calledtlamocuitlahuijquetl(‘‘guardian-witness’’) that people hang in theirhouses to ward off misfortune. The spirit entity reports potential danger to thehill spirits surrounding the village so that they can intercede and act to pro-tect the inhabitants of the house. The image is cut with two oblong openingson each side of its body. I was told by a shaman that these openings representempty pockets, which the spirit fills with ‘‘good things’’ to bring to householdmembers when it returns from its visits to the hills.Echoes of the Nahua past can be recognized in the stories they tell about theorigin of the sacred hills. Shamans told me thatmontesuma,an earth spirit, wascarrying the sacred Popocatepetl to its place outside of Mexico City when hedropped parts of it along the way. These pieces of the primordial divine moun-tain became the local sacred hills. It is interesting that this mountain should holdsuch an important place in the myths of the Nahua, who live so far from the cen-tral highlands. Popocatepetl was sacred to the Aztecs and, as far as I know, hasnever been visited by anyone from Amatlán. The spiritmontesumahas a namesimilar to that of two Aztec emperors, but although I inquired in Amatlán, noone seemed aware of the connection (see Parsons 1970:221–222).The close link between hills and the caves may be seen in the way contem-porary Nahua view the many Pre-Hispanic pyramid ruins that dot their region.Stone ruins are calledcubesin the local Spanish dialect andtetsacuali(singu-lar) in Nahuatl (see Figure 3.7, discussed in the next section, in which the ruinsare anthropomorphized as a spirit cut from paper). Nahua shamans told methatmontesumabuilt the great pyramids and the national cathedral in MexicoCity in a single night in the period that preceded the present era. En route toMexico City, the earth spirit stopped along the way to build the local structuresand the now partially ruined colonial church in the regional center of Ixhuatlánde Madero. Shamans were in agreement that the ruins covered cave entrances"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"50Central Mexicoleading to Mictlan, the ‘‘place of the dead’’ (Brady 1997:603; Brady and Veni1992:163; Stone 1997:202). I have witnessed many curing rituals in which acleansing was performed at the site of pyramid ruins to lure wandering spirits ofthe dead back into the Underworld. Many people avoided going near the ruinsbecause of lurking spirits of the dead, while some claimed that the ruins wereinfested with poisonous snakes, and they avoided them for that reason.We can see that pyramids, like sacred mountains, are believed to have beencreated by a manifestation of the earth spirit and are associated with caves inNahua thought. However, the caves located beneath pyramids represent a tran-sition zone between the living and the dead rather than the vagina-womb theyseem to be in relation to caves associated with the sacred hills. Some villagers dosay that the ancient pyramids are like sacred hills; others simply say that theyare associated with the earth (see Vogt 1964:194).Given the importance of mountains and caves in Nahua religion and facedwith a devastating drought, it is understandable that the villagers would want toorganize a pilgrimage to the most sacred mountain and to the cave home of thewater spirit, the source of human and crop fertility. People heeded Cirilo’s calland began arriving in Amatlán several days before the actual trek to Postectli.They each brought offerings of food, money, and a willingness to labor on be-half of the greater cause of bringing rain to the fields. Cirilo’s house and hissmall attached shrine became the focus of activity that continued day and nightuntil the morning of departure. In one room, men sat in a circle making thethousands of palm and flower decorations required for such an elaborate offer-ing. Inside the shrine, enduring the sweltering heat of the drought, sat a dozenshamans cutting the thousands of paper figures that such an offering requires.As preparations got under way, a violinist and a guitarist joined the workingshamans to play the repetitive and rhythmicxochisonis(a Nahuatl-Spanish ne-ologism meaning ‘‘flower sounds’’) that accompany all important Nahua rituals.The shrine was filled with aromatic copal incense smoke and lighted candlesthat also marked the sacred occasion. Periodically, Cirilo’s wife and daughter-in-law prepared and served food for the growing crowd of helpers. Throughoutthis preparatory period, Cirilo was busy greeting newly arrived guests, takingpart in cutting paper images, clearing the altar in his shrine, and removing theseed spirits from his sacred wooden box-cave so that women could wash thedoll-sized cloth outfits. He also purchased needed items and gathered the morethan three dozen chickens and turkeys that would become bloody sacrifices tothe powers that control rain.Nahua rituals are colorful and exciting events that may best be described asorganized anarchy. On the one hand, many activities are going on simultaneouslyand to the outside observer chaos appears to reign, and yet everyone seems toknow what to do and is aware of what is coming up next. The shamans exert"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua51very little apparent authority and, although they are frequently at the center ofactivity, participants rarely consult them. A number of ritual episodes precedethe actual pilgrimage. Shamans and helpers lay hundreds of paper images on thefreshly cleaned altar tables and, after extensive ritual preparation, sprinkle themwith the blood of sacrificed chickens and turkeys. They then decorate the altarwith green leaves, palm and flower adornments, food and drink, lighted candles,and many additional items. They lay out a smaller array beneath the altar tablethat includes bloody paper figures, candles, food and drink, all set before a pairof elaborately dressed, seated paper images of the male and female aspects of theearth spirit. Helpers prepare an altar outside of the shrine dedicated to the SunSpirit, Tonatij. This outdoor altar is connected to the altar inside the shrine bya marigold-covered vine, almost like a symbolic telegraph wire.Shamans prepare paper images of disease-causing spirits of the dead for aritual that will clear the area of malevolent spirits that might be attracted tothe offerings. This ritual is held in the middle of the night, when such spiritsare likely to be lurking about. The shamans and helpers walk in procession to aspring located in a hollow beneath a giant ceiba tree, where they dedicate offer-ings to the water spirit,apanchanej,and her helpers, the clouds. Upon return-ing, the procession circumambulates the outdoor shrine to the sun and dedicatesofferings to this important member of the Nahua pantheon. At each offeringsite, people array lighted candles, palm and flower adornments, offerings of food,drink, cornmeal, tobacco, alcohol, and paper figures, and the shamans kneel andchant as the musicians fill the air with their flower sounds.About a week after the people first began to assemble at Cirilo’s shrine totake part in numerous ritual events, the participants prepared for the actual pil-grimage to Postectli and the ascent to the sacred cave of the water spirit. Thetrek began at dawn and included about fifty people. Participants were loadeddown with birds to be sacrificed, adornments, and the ritual items that would beused in the offerings. Leading the procession was a shaman holding the sacredwalking stick (cuatopiliin Nahuatl,bastónin Spanish) representing the thunderspirits who carry water from the Gulf of Mexico to the cave on the mountain.Last in the long procession came a helper carrying a smaller walking stick. Thepilgrimage took nearly twelve hours over the rough terrain of the Sierra Madrefoothills, with temperatures reaching 130 degrees Fahrenheit in the sun. Severalpeople collapsed from heat exhaustion during the trek. Each time this happenedeveryone rested until their fellow pilgrim was ready to resume walking. All alongthe trail, the shamans stopped at different springs and wells and left a smalloffering. As we passed through remote villages, people left their houses and ap-proached us with additional offerings to take to the sacred mountain. Some ofthem had tears streaming down their faces as they handed us the items theywished to donate."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"52Central MexicoAfter about seven hours on the trail, we could see Postectli looming dark onthe horizon, a gigantic form jutting up from the surrounding plains and shim-mering like an optical illusion in the tremendous heat. We walked for almost fivemore hours until we came to the Nahua town of Ichcacuatitla, which lay in theshadow of the imposing monolith. That night the shamans dedicated anotheroffering inside a rustic shrine maintained by the townspeople to accommodatepilgrimages such as ours. At dawn the next day, without having slept for severaldays, we began the ascent to the caves.At the base of Postectli, the shamans gathered everyone and told them theywere about to enter sacred space. They were cautioned not to relieve themselveswithin the precincts of the mountain. After scattering to find cover from pryingeyes, the group reassembled and began the trek up Postectli. The trail woundback and forth across the face of the mountain and in many places required a ver-tical climb. People moved slowly but deliberately, bending under the weight oftheir load as they picked their way up the rough trail. Along the difficult trail—in fact, all the way to the peak—musicians somehow managed to play the flowersongs as they struggled up the steep side of the mountain. It was truly a magnifi-cent feat and drew praise from all of the participants. About a third of the wayto the summit, everyone stopped at a wide ledge and put down their load. Twoof the shamans laid out an array of images of malevolent disease-causing spiritsand dedicated an offering to them to remove harmful spirits that might be at-tracted to offerings intended for the mountain and the forces controlling rain.Other shamans constructed an altar table and on it they laid out hundreds ofpaper images, sprinkling each with the blood of birds they sacrificed on the spot.Women danced before the altar with baskets that contained additional offer-ing items balanced on their heads. Several shamans knelt before the altar andchanted simultaneously, although not in unison. Individual participants, manyopenly weeping, then stood one by one before the altar and beseeched the spiritsto acknowledge their plight and provide rain for the fields. While these eventswere going on, two shamans carrying a white chicken climbed up the rock facebehind the altar. They carefully imprisoned the chicken in a small fissure inthe rock by placing sticks over the opening to prevent its escape. The chicken,secured in its own little cave in the cliff, was an offering to the clouds (see Moto-linía 1941:50, for a description of a similar ritual sacrifice to Tlaloc using humanvictims).Following the construction and dedication of the altar, we resumed the climbup the increasingly steep and dangerous trail. At two points, seventy-five-footropes affixed to outcroppings were needed so that we could pull ourselves upthe treacherous slopes. Almost delirious with heat and exhaustion, the proces-sion stopped at another small flat area overlooking the plains lying nearly fifteenhundred feet below. Again the shamans constructed an altar, laid out paper fig-"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua53ures, sacrificed fowl, and sprinkled their blood on the images. They chanted ina heartfelt manner, imploring the water spirit to provide the blessing of rain. Atlast, we began the climb to the summit, led by the shamans, who carried thesacred walking sticks, and by the musicians, who continued to play the ritualmusic. Several people stayed behind, too exhausted and overcome with heat tocontinue.The procession was soon strung out along extremely narrow and precari-ous trails beneath the cover of scrub forest. After about a twenty-minute climbpeople stopped and stood in a place on the trail, unable to move forward or back-ward nor to pass one another. Up ahead the shamans knelt before a small caveentrance. The cave was not very impressive—really just a cleft in the rock andnot big enough for a man to enter. They laid out an array of paper figures andofferings and chanted before the opening for nearly half an hour. The cave is thehome oftlatomoni,the spirit of thunder and assistant to the water spirit (see itsdepiction in paper in Figure 3.9, discussed in the next section). Unfortunately,I was unable to get as close as I would have liked to witness the details of theoffering. The offerings appeared to be simple and the chanting relatively brief asthe people in the procession waited patiently on the dangerous, uncomfortabletrail.We continued to climb for several minutes more and turned onto a side trailthat led horizontally to the cave ofapanchanej.The cave itself was very difficultto access, and most people stood once more in place on the trail and observedtwo shamans approach the entrance. In appearance, it was a vertical slit aboutthe height of a man, slightly wider at the bottom, with rounded edges. Its re-semblance to a vagina was truly remarkable. In front of the cave was a kind ofspillway that led close to the edge of the cliff. The trail was actually above thecave, and the shamans had to descend several feet to gain entrance. The spillwaywas filled with a large deposit of remnants of previous offerings, including pot-tery, animal bones, and fragments of cut paper. Clearly, this was a spot visited bymany processions each year and had been a sacred place for hundreds of years, ifnot more. No water flowed from the cave’s entrance during the month of June,and a grown man could not quite fit inside the opening. The shamans managedto set up a display of paper images and other offerings handed down to themby the onlookers. They leaned the walking sticks on either side of the entrance,and one ritual specialist lay on his back and wedged his body into the cave as faras could. His right hand reached several feet into the cave entrance and he leftofferings there for the water spirit. After he dedicated the offerings, a femaleshaman announced loudly to the waiting people, ‘‘Now let us go to our real father[mero tata].’’ The shamans at the cave site picked up the walking sticks, crawledback to the trail, and led the procession on another twenty-minute ascent to thevery peak of the sacred mountain."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"54Central MexicoThe summit of Postectli is a rounded rocky outcropping perhaps one hundredfeet across. The rocks were so hot from the sun that even to brush against onewas to risk a serious burn. At the highest point, the Catholic Church had erecteda cement cross with a cement bench placed before it, a not very subtle symbol ofindigenous religion’s conquest by Christianity. It is a marvel how anyone couldhave carried the bags of cement and water to the summit to construct theseitems. Far from acknowledging Christianity’s supremacy over Native Americanreligion, however, the Nahua and Otomí of this region have largely incorpo-rated the European religion into their own. For the Nahua the cross stands forthe Sun Spirit, Tonatij, who, in turn, is associated with Jesus Christ. The sunis an otiose creator deity that literally animates the cosmos with its light andheat (Sandstrom 1991:247–248; see also Figure 3.18, discussed in the next sec-tion). Thus, the cross at the summit of Postectli is perfectly appropriate fromthe perspective of the participants, who want to include the sun in any majoroffering. Around the base of the cross are remnants of hundreds of candles, theresidue of a large number of past offerings. As if to provide a lesson about theprecariousness of human existence, the melted beeswax and paraffin create anextremely slippery area near the edge of the cliff (see Burkhart 1989).Ifapanchanej’s cave is a metaphorical vagina, then the female shaman’s com-ment about the peak’s being the real father indicates that the shamans, at least,see the mountain as a metaphorical phallus. In fact, from a distance the moun-tain unmistakably resembles a giant phallus. Because the water-earth complexis clearly female and centered around cave symbolism, I was eager to see whichof the spirits in the Nahua pantheon would receive the offerings we were aboutto make and would, thereby, from the perspective of the participants, embodythe male principle. I had my suspicions about the spirit’s identity but had neverbeen able to confirm them.As the musicians played the sacred music, shamans began to construct threealtars. The first was to one side of the summit close by the nearly vertical dropto the plains far below. They set up the second altar on the cement bench bythe cross. For the Nahua, the cross itself has sacred attributes and is thereforeworthy of offerings, although, as mentioned, it is also closely associated withthe sun. The third altar was constructed of a wooden hoop perhaps three feet indiameter, with its interior space woven with vines. The hoop was fastened at itscenter to the end of an eight-foot-high upright pole, like a tabletop. Shamansplaced offerings on the circular platform as helpers unfurled long colored-paperstreamers and fastened them to the hoop. The paper strips led away from thehoop, like spokes from a wheel, and nearly covered the top of the mountain.Here was incontrovertible proof of the identity of the male principle in Nahuareligious thought. The structure was an image of the sun with colorful light raysemanating from the circular altar at the center (see Gómez Martínez 2002:113)."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Cave-Pyramid Complex among the Contemporary Nahua55This was yet another clear link to the Pre-Hispanic era, as the shamans chantedand dedicated offerings to the solar disk, the outward manifestation of the sunand source of animating power for the living cosmos.With the dedication of the offerings to the sun, the pilgrimage came to anend. The exhausted but satisfied participants quietly began the long and haz-ardous trek back down the mountain. The feeling of solidarity and anticipationthat was so strong among procession members as we ascended Postectli beganto dissipate as we retreated into our own thoughts and selves for the trip down.Below awaited our normal lives and daily routines, far from the mountaintopabode of the thunder and water spirits and the celestial realm of the sun.When we neared the bottom, a loud thunderclap sounded out of the hazy,smoke-filled sky. This noise set the people talking about how the offerings andthe pilgrimage had been a success; the thunder simply affirmed their feeling thatthey had really accomplished something with their effort and sacrifice. Withintwo weeks the rains came and soaked the fields. We later learned that the harvestthat following season was the best they had seen in years. Cirilo, the shamanwho organized the pilgrimage, seemed satisfied that we had done everythingcorrectly and thatapanchanej’s anger at people’s disrespectful behavior was ap-peased for the time being.Evidence I have presented from the contemporary Nahua of the southernHuasteca region leads to the conclusion that caves, mountains, and pyramidsare part of a symbolic complex that has its roots in Pre-Hispanic antiquity. Inthe pantheistic religious philosophy of the Nahua, the earth is a living being andthe mountains and caves appear to be metaphorical sexual organs closely linkedto crop and human fertility. Stone pyramid ruins, constructed by the earth spiritmontesuma,who also created the sacred mountains, appear to be symbolic ofother types of mountains or perhaps of the earth or even the underworld. Theytoo are associated with caves, but more as transition passages between the realmsof the living and the dead. It is conceivable that mountains and pyramids aremirror images of each other for the Nahua.Natural mountains like Postectli are linked to caves that are the sources ofwater and generalized fertility, as well as associated with the masculine principleof the sun. Pyramids, on the other hand, are linked to caves that are the sourcesof disease-causing souls of the dead (theejecatl,or malevolent wind spirits) orare passageways to Mictlan, the dark and gloomy place of the dead. In fact, forthe ancients pyramids were sometimes burial places of the elites (Bassie-Sweet1996:117) and caves were often used as tombs (Heyden 1975:137; 1981:20).From the mountain caves come rain and life, while from the pyramid caves ema-nate malevolent winds and death. Postectli is the home oftonantsijand the seedspirits, while pyramids house poisonous snakes (a considerable threat in thistropical region)."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"56Central MexicoCave symbolism is very well developed among the contemporary HuastecanNahua. I have shown that cave analogs exist in many forms, including clay ves-sels, special boxes, thetemascali,and the inside of a squash. Heyden lists clay jars,boxes, and chambers in pyramids, among many other places, as ‘‘artificial caves’’for Pre-Hispanic peoples (1981:22). Caves are interior places where supernaturalevents occur or where dramas are enacted that determine the fate of the humanrace. They are the homes of important spirit entities and the source of water.They are ‘‘stone warehouses’’ that are the sources of crops and valuable items (seeGrigsby 1986). Because of their importance in Nahua religious ideology, cavesare also the object of pilgrimages, as we have seen. They are central features incontemporary Nahua myths and ritual symbolism. At the same time, caves arealso the source of destructive forces and disease and so can be dangerous placesthat are fearfully avoided. They are neither wholly good nor wholly bad. In thewords of Eva Hunt (1977:108), ‘‘caves are imagined simultaneously as womb-vaginas and as mouths that swallow dead souls, entrances to the underworldfrom which man once emerged and to which he returns after a short journey onthe earth’s surface.’’ In sum, caves are aspects of a living universe that contain allof the positive and negative values and contradictions of the world at large. Inthe religious ideology of the contemporary Huastecan Nahua, just as in that oftheir Pre-Hispanic forebears, caves produce the same ambivalent feelings thatpeople exhibit toward their spirits, their environment, and other human beings.IllustrationsFigures 3.1–3.18 are samples of the paper images cut by Nahua shamans foruse in rituals.

Use of the word ‘‘shaman’’ for people like Cirilo is controversial in anthropology.Some researchers believe that the term should be used only for ritual specialists amongSiberian peoples, who originated the concept (Kehoe 2000). Others recognize a con-nection between the activities of ritual specialists in Mesoamerica and their Arctic andSubarctic counterparts. See Sandstrom (2001b) and Huber and Sandstrom (2001) for adiscussion of the controversy.3. In the ‘‘Histoyre de Mechique,’’ a sixteenth-century manuscript in French, there isan account of the creation of the world with interesting parallels to the ethnographic datapresented here. The myth states that the gods Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipuca broughtdown from the heavens the goddess Tlaltecutli, whose joints were eyes and mouths thatbit like a wild beast. Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipuca changed into huge serpents, grabbedTlaltecutli, and split her in two. Half went to the heavens and half fell to earth. Theother gods were ashamed of the treatment shown Tlaltecutli and ordered that from herwould come all of the fruits of the earth that humans required to live: ‘‘To accomplishthis from her hair they made trees, flowers, and grass; from her skin, tiny plants and smallflowers; from the eyes, wells, springs and small caves; from the mouth, rivers and largecaverns; from the nose, valleys and mountains’’ (‘‘Y para hacerlo, hicieron de sus cabe-llos, árboles y flores y yerbas; de su piel la yerba muy menuda y florecillas; de los ojos,pozos y fuentes y pequeñas cuevas; de la boca, ríos y cavernas grandes; de la nariz, vallesy montañas’’) (‘‘Histoyre de Mechique,’’ 1965:108; my translation; also see Gibson andGlass 1975:340).4. The boxes containing the seed images have always intrigued me. Over the years Ihave seen many such boxes on altars, but when questioned about them, people simplyasserted that they contained the seeds and that once or twice a year offerings were dedi-cated to them so that the fields would be productive. I have been unable to locate ref-erences to seed boxes in the ethnohistorical literature and so their origin has remained amystery. However, while I was writing this chapter, a colleague in Mexico informed methat workmen on a construction project had uncovered a sealed stone box at the TemploMayor in Mexico City, the very heart of the Aztec capital. Sections of the inner city havebeen systematically excavated, revealing a massive complex of pyramid bases, chambers,and even wooden beams used by Aztec engineers to shore up the soil.

The box dates from just before theconquest. We saw no paper figures like those cut in Amatlán or evidence that the boxcontained symbolic representations of seeds. However, it is suggestive that a box obvi-ously dedicated to the fertilizing principle of the rain contains paper and figures drawnon paper.ReferencesAlcorn, Janis B.1984Huastec Mayan Ethnobotany.University of Texas Press, Austin.Armoni, Ma.

Mountains, large rocks,caves, springs, rivers, trees, roads, features along the seashore, or landmarks withstrange or unique forms were identified with mythological events in the remotepast, the creation of the world, the origin of human groups, the deeds of an-cestral heroes, or places inhabited by powerful spirits or deities. This ideologyexplained the origin of the world and celebrated the central and special place ofone’s group in the natural order.Among the diverse landscape features, mountains and caves stand out as themost important (Vogt 1969:375) and together come to represent the larger con-cept of the sacred earth. Water, an essential element for life, is thought to bestored within mountains and can often be accessed through caves. The com-bination of earth and water symbolizes fertility itself, and most living thingsare thought ultimately to spring from the earth. Caves play a major role in thisrespect as the metaphorical uterus of the earth (Brady 1988; Heyden 1991). Ac-cording to the ‘‘Histoyre du Mechique’’ (Histoyre du Mechique 1965:110), Cin-teotl (maize god) was born in a cave and emerged to the surface of the moun-tains and fields to bring food to human beings. In the same vein, Relief 1 atChalcatzingo represents the god Tepeyolotl (Heart of the Mountain), or a rulerimpersonating him, invoking the rain in the interior of the cave in order to pro-duce the fertility necessary for human sustenance. The uterine theme is alsoevident in Olmec altars at La Venta and San Lorenzo that have been shownto be thrones (Grove 1973). These monuments depict human figures emergingfrom caves represented by the open mouths of jaguars. Ethnographic evidencestrongly suggests that the scene is a statement that the ruler or his ancestor wasborn from the earth and therefore was directly related to the earth deities (Brady1989:55–64)."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"70Central MexicoFigure 4.1.A representation of the quincuncial model of the Mesoamerican universe.Drawn by Mario Dávila, after Matos Moctezuma (1988).Overlaid on any specific landscape was a more general Mesoamerican conceptof the universe as a quincunx, that is, a plane with four corners. These cardi-nal points established the directions of the universe where diverse deities lived(Figure 4.1). At the center of the plane was an imaginary axis, often embodied asthe Tree of Life. The tree was located above a mountain. Its roots were anchoredin the underworld and its foliated branches reaching the heavens, establishingthe union between sky, earth, and the underworld.The center was, above all others, the most sacred of places, a place of prestigeand of inexhaustible abundance (Eliade 1958:379–382). The center is where thecreation of the world and the creation of humans took place.A common feature of settlements in traditional societies is that they arelaid out so as to conceptually place them at the center of the cosmos (Eliade1954:12). Thus, a community’s sacred mountain or its artificial substitute, thecentral pyramid, came to represent the sacred mountain at the cosmic center.It should be noted that the identification of communities in Central Mexicowith mountains is strong.

In the fol-lowing section, we will describe how these concepts of sacred landscape actuallytook material form at the site of Acatzingo Viejo.Acatzingo ViejoThe site of Acatzingo Viejo is located about 4 kilometers southeast of thepresent-day town of Acatzingo, Puebla, Mexico, and just south of the Puebla-Veracruz highway. The site was surveyed and recorded by the ProyectoAcatzingo-Tepeaca in 1995. All that remains of the site is a 7-meter-high pyra-mid, which is flanked on either side by low lateral platforms. The site was prob-ably more extensive at one time, judging by the sherds and artifacts strewn acrossthe heavily plowed fields that surround the remaining architecture. Test exca-vation established that the site was occupied from the Late Classic/Early Post-classic into the early Colonial Periods (Sheehy 1995). As part of that project,a series of small caves along the edge of the site, some 450 meters east of thecentral plaza (Figure 4.3), were recorded by Medina Jaen (2000).As part of a project conducted by the Mesoamerican Research Foundationunder the direction of Tim Tucker, the caves were remapped in August 2000.The study of these caves provided an opportunity to demonstrate the histori-cal character of the Map of Cuauhtinchan No. 2, which had been drawn ofthe area. It was possible to observe from the top of Cerro Tlaxcanyo, next tothe town of Tepeaca, that the region delimited by the volcanoes Popocatépetland Iztaccihuatl to the west, the Malinche Volcano to the north, the Pico deOrizaba to the east, and the Sierra Tentzón to the south had been faithfullyrendered by the indigenous artist. Relative position of landmarks was depictedwith exactness, while there was greater imprecision in scale, as the cartographermanipulated distances to fit the important features into a rectangular format.The map was made in the sixteenth century with the purpose of legitimizingland claims in light of the confusion and dispossessions created first by Aztecdomination and later by the Spanish conquest. It also presents a historical ac-count of the Toltec-Chichimec migrations and their settlement in the towns ofthe Valley of Puebla. During the mapping of Acatzingo Viejo, it was possibleto establish the geographic location of a group of caves that appear on the Mapof Cuauhtinchan No. 2.The current study focuses on this complex of caves built along a natural es-carpment approximately 5 meters high. Six caves have been excavated into thefairly sheer face of volcanic ash (Figure 4.4). Five of the six are located south ofa recently constructed road leading to a Pemex installation.

The ceiling is heavily smoke blackened. Allan Cobbremoved a small amount of black soot with a pocketknife and heated it witha cigarette lighter. The smoke that was given off had the distinctive odor ofburned rubber, and pieces of burned automobile tire were noted on the floor ofthe cave.Cave #3, located only five meters to the south of Cave #2, is similar in sizeand form to the latter (Figure 4.6). The character of the cave is quite different,however, because the entrance is low, only eighty centimeters high, so one hasto stoop or crawl to enter the cave, and the chamber is considerably darker. Fewdetails about this cave are available because a large portion of the floor has beendestroyed by four large looter’s pits or trenches, and what has not been destroyedhas been covered by backdirt. The ceiling, however, shows a good deal of smokeblackening.Approximately fifteen meters south of Cave #3 is a small open feature desig-nated as Cave #1 (Figure 4.7). A floor-to-ceiling column at the entrance dividesthe cave in half. The most interesting feature is a small altar at the back of thecave that was created by a stone slab that rises thirty-five centimeters from thefloor. The area behind the slab was filled with earth to create a level surface. Apaintbrush was used to sweep the loose soil from a small area on top of the altarto reveal a hard, fire-blackened surface. A corncob, several chicken feathers, twoagave spines, an obsidian blade, and a sherd were noted on the surface of thealtar. The placement of the agave spines raised the possibility that they had beenused as bloodletters. Each of the spines was wiped with a Luminol swab to checkfor the presence of hemoglobin, but the results were negative. A hard black sub-stance appears to have been spilled on the wall along the back of the altar. Weheated a sample and once again it gave off the odor of burned rubber. On thefloor of the cave were several pill bottles and aluminum casings that once heldantibiotic tablets.Cave #5 is located just to the south of Cave #1, but the mouth was so ob-scured by plant growth that it was originally overlooked. Like Cave #1, Cave#5 is small and completely in the light zone (Figure 4.8). The floor is extremelydry and covered by a layer of fine powder. Four corncobs, dry orange peels, andseveral mango pits were noted in the dust.Cave #6, the southernmost grotto in the escarpment, consists of two cham-bers (Figure 4.9).

Thesouthern chamber extends far enough back and the passage is low enough thatone enters a twilight zone.

Thus, the cave may have been considerably higher in Pre-Columbian times. It may also have been larger. Two small passages at the end ofthe southern chamber are now impassable, but this may be the result of recentcollapse. A large piece of ceiling collapse in this area is lying on a disintegratingplastic bag, indicating that the breakdown occurred recently.Cave #4 is the only cave located north of the access road and appears to havebeen damaged by the construction. Rocks and soil from the grading have enteredthe cave and covered part of the floor. The ceiling shows fire blackening, indi-cating recent use (Figure 4.10).In evaluating the discoveries it should be stressed that all the caves are locatedin a small, crescent-shaped segment of escarpment. The escarpment is smallenough that it placed some constraints on the size of the caves so that all wouldfit. This suggests that the placement in this single, naturally bounded featurewas intentional and important. The fact that they were placed in close proximityto each other made it possible to view all at the same time when the underbrushwas cleared. Thus, the close proximity within a naturally bounded landscapefeature suggests that the caves were meant to be part of a single complex.The fact that the caves are found in a stratum of nonkarstic volcanic ash isalso significant, because it is clear that the features are not natural and must havebeen excavated. This is important because it means that the form and placementof the caves reflect conscious decisions rather than the whim of nature. Elabo-rate artificial caves may provide important data about exactly what the structureswere designed to represent. In examining the map of the escarpment, it is clearthat the area destroyed by the construction of the road was large enough to con-tain a cave similar in size to the other six. Interviews with local informants veri-fied that the road had destroyed a seventh cave. The layout of the other six alsosuggests that one should have been placed where we suspect the destroyed caveto have been. Thus, in its original form, the Acatzingo Viejo complex consistedof seven cavities.During the first study, Medina Jaen (2000:303) collected ethnographic dataon the area. One of the more interesting accounts by a resident of San Cristóbalde los Nava states that the caves connect to the Malinche Volcano, approximatelythirty-five kilometers to the northwest. In this respect, the caves at AcatzingoViejo, like many natural caves in Mesoamerica, are believed to be connectedto other important features of the sacred landscape through unrealistically longpassages. Medina’s informant also relates that in his youth he attempted to findthe passage and the seven barrels of gold that, according to his parents, weresupposed to be buried there. We would suggest that the presence of seven bar-rels is not simply coincidental but is directly connected to the existence of sevencaves."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Figure 4.9.AcatzingoViejo Cave #6.

Drawnby John Fogarty andAllan Cobb."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Constructing Mythic Space79DiscussionIn attempting to put the Acatzingo Viejo discoveries in a larger social, histori-cal, and theoretical framework, we would note that geographer Erich Isaac hasproposed that, as ideal polar opposites, there are two basic religious orientations.The first seeks the justification of human existence in the act of creation itself,while the second orientation finds it in a divine charter or covenant. Ritual, inthe second case, will repeatedly reference the covenant, and landscape modifica-tions will be minimal. In societies that see creation as the central justification ofhuman existence, Isaac (1962:12) says that ‘‘the attempt will be made to repro-duce the cosmic plan in the landscape with greater or lesser effect upon the land,depending on the elaborateness of reproduction attempted.’’ While the conceptof the covenant is not unknown in Mesoamerica, cosmology definitely focuseson the act of creation.This observation is supported by García-Zambrano’s discussion of contact-period rituals of foundation throughout Mesoamerica. He notes that people at-tempted to find a spot with certain types of features:Essentially, Mesoamerican migrants searched for an environment with specificcharacteristics that comprised several symbolic levels...Suchaplacehadtorecall the mythical moment when the earth was created: an aquatic universeframed by four mountains with a fifth elevation protruding in the middle of thewater. The mountain at the core had to be dotted with caves and springs, andsometimes surrounded by smaller hills. A setting like this duplicated, and for-ever would freeze, the primordial scene when the waters and the sky separatedand the earth sprouted upwards. (García-Zambrano 1994:217–218)The fact that there were once seven caves at Acatzingo Viejo immediatelysuggests a relationship with the Chicomoztoc. Perhaps the best-known rep-resentation of Chicomoztoc is that found in theHistoria Tolteca-Chichimeca(Kirchhoff et al. 1976), containing seven internal chambers. It should be noted,however, that within the indigenous sources there is no consensus on Chico-moztoc’s physical form. In some ethnohistorical documents the mythical placeis portrayed as a linear arrangement of seven discrete caves. The linear arrange-ment in the Codex Vaticanus A (1979) and in theAtlas de Durán(Durán 1995)closely resembles the arrangement noted at Acatzingo Viejo (Figure 4.11). Webelieve that this alignment of seven caves is definitely a re-creation of the Chi-comoztoc made by the Chichimec as a reconstruction of their mythical placeof origin. Unfortunately, as already mentioned, the seventh cave was destroyedin about 1993 by the construction of a road that leads to a Pemex installation;however, ethnographic data confirm the existence of the now-lost cave."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"80Central MexicoNahua groups conceived of the archetypical homeland or place of creationand origin as the Chicomoztoc, or Place of the Seven Caves. All of the importantsixteenth-century chronicles, both indigenous and Spanish, make reference tothis place and present pictorial representations in some of the codices. TheHis-toria de los mexicanos por sus pinturas(Garibay 1965:36–39) mentions an islandcalled Aztlan (Place of Whiteness or of the Herons) that was surrounded by alake. On one of the shores was a mountain named Colhuacatepec or Colhuacan(Twisted Hill), which contained the seven caves. The same document says thatin this place, located northwest of New Spain, the god Camaxtle hit a rock witha stick and four hundred Chichimec emerged. Durán (1995:Chap. 1) consideredAztlan, Colhuacan, and Chicomoztoc to be different names for the same placeof origin located to the north of New Spain, near Florida. The seven Nahuatribes that populated the Valley of Mexico—the Xochimilca, the Chalca, theTepaneca, the Culhua, the Tlahuica, the Tlaxcalteca, and the Mexica—all camefrom this place (Figure 4.12).TheHistoria Tolteca-Chichimeca(Kirchhoff et al. 1976:161) and the Map ofCuauhtinchan No. 2 (Yoneda 1981:123) narrate and illustrate a different storyof the exodus from Chicomoztoc. In these sources, it was the seven Chichimecpeoples—the Cuauhtinchantlaca, the Totomiuaque, the Acolchichimeca, theTzauhcteca, the Zacateca, the Malpantlaca, and the Texcalteca—who settled inthe Valleys of Cholula and Puebla who emerged from the caves (Figure 4.13).The Map of Cuauhtinchan No. 2 illustrates the significance of the act of leavingthe cave as a metaphor for the act of creation symbolized by the New Fire cere-mony. This ritual portrayed the exit of human beings from the womb of theearth as the start of time (Figure 4.14). The same document also mentions thatin Chicomoztoc the Chichimec performed penance for four days, fasting andletting their blood. These rituals may have been understood to have producedaltered states of consciousness, because Chimalpahin refers to Chicomoztoc asQuinehuayan (Place Where One Is Possessed). Ruiz de Alarcón also noted therelationship of bloodletting and trances: ‘‘After he had placed it (offering), hesacrificed himself by shedding his blood, for which he carried a point made froma sharpened sliver of cane . . . They say that some fainted or fell asleep, and inthis ecstasy they either heard, or fancied that they heard, words which their idolspoke to them’’ (Coe and Whittaker 1982:80–81).The perforation of the septum of the Chichimec chiefs in a ritual that madethemtlatoanis[rulers] was also performed in Chicomoztoc. This symbolized theconversion of the nomadic Chichimec into the civilized Toltec. Thus, in thiscase, the caves played a role as places of transformation and legitimization ofthe lineages and genealogies of the groups that held power.Chimalpahin (1998:Vol. 1) describes the mysterious place as ChicomoztocTzotzompa Quinehuayan, There Where the Seven Holes in the Rock Are.

Sahagún (1975) places it in Cerro Coliuhquitépetl on theterritorial boundary between the Mexica and the Michuaca (Tarascans of Mi-choacán). Kirchhoff et al. (1976) locate it in Cerro Culiacán, near the town ofSan Isidro Culiacán in the state of Guanajuato. Jiménez Moreno (1942) puts it inthe Tula-Xilotepec region in the state of Hidalgo, and Chavero (1887) places itin the region of the present city of Culiacán in the state of Sinaloa. Both Torque-mada (1964) and Clavijero (1978) identify it with the ruins of La Quemada inthe state of Zacatecas.Most modern authorities tend to consider Chicomoztoc to be a mythicalrather than an actual place. Chicomoztoc represents the idea of the emergenceof human beings from cavities in the body of the earth. This idea was applied byAztec shamans and sorcerers in their incantations to the human body whereinthe seven openings were referred to as seven caves (Ruiz de Alarcón 1982:223).As time passed, the guardians of the Mesoamerican tradition preserved theirsense of identity and origin by re-creating Chicomoztoc at their sites either bytaking advantage of natural caves or by excavating caves. In this sense, all thechroniclers and historians are correct, because many Chicomoztoc existed in allparts of Mesoamerica (see, for example, Brady 1991).Also important is the location of the ceremonial plaza at Acatzingo Viejo,above the escarpment containing the row of seven caves. The caves are, therefore,associated with the site’s core and major pyramidal structure. The complex is notunique in this respect, but, rather, appears to be part of an established CentralMexican tradition. At Totimehuacan, Puebla, Spranz (1967) discovered an arti-ficial cave beneath the principal Late Preclassic pyramid. The Great Pyramid atCholula is built over a spring and possibly an artificial cave (McCafferty 1996:5).Perhaps the best-known example is the artificial cave, shaped like a uterus, be-neath the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan (Heyden 1973, 1975, 1981). Wesuspect that the many segments of stone drains found in the cave are part of asystem that channeled rainwater from the pyramid into the cave. As the cavefilled and water flowed out the entrance, it would appear that the cave was builtover a spring. There are a number of impressive artificial caves in and around thecentral ceremonial complex at Xochicalco, including the well-known Observa-tory (Hirth 2000:216). In many ways, the Aztec Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlanreplicates all of the symbolic features of the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihua-can. According to the legend recorded by Alvarado Tezozomoc (1975:63), theTemplo Mayor is built at the spot where the Aztecs found an eagle on a cac-tus holding a serpent.

The Acatzingo Viejo complex should,therefore, be seen as part of a pattern found in numerous places which datesfrom the Preclassic all the way to the conquest.The question that arises is why the ancient inhabitants of Acatzingo Viejowould construct this symbol at their site. In his study of the rituals that ac-companied the founding of a new community, García-Zambrano (1992, 1994)argues that throughout Mesoamerica indigenous peoples looked for spots thatrecalled the mythical moment of creation. The cave was the critical element;thus, ‘‘these cavities, when ritually dedicated to the divinities, became the pul-sating heart of the new town, providing the cosmogonic referents that legiti-mized the settlers’ right for occupying that space and for the ruler’s authorityover that site’’ (García-Zambrano 1994:218). Nor is there any doubt about whatthe cave was supposed to represent. García-Zambrano (1994:217–218) observesthat, ‘‘many times, the grotto was manually excavated to approximate its shapeto that of the mythological cave with internal niches. The grotto alluded to themythological place of origin that preceded all intent of migration: Chicomoztoc,Apoala, Tulan Zuyua, and Chalchiuitlapazco.’’ The Acatzingo Viejo cave com-plex, therefore, was the ritual heart of the community that legitimized the verysettlement. We can see in the Map of Cuauhtinchan No. 2 (Yoneda 1981:130)that the cave complex has a clear relationship with the founding of the town ofAcatzingo Viejo. The rulers Itztlapoca (Obsidian-Smoke) and Apanecatl, whocame from Tepeaca in the year 4 Calli (Figure 4.15), are depicted as seated nextto the cave (Kirchhoff et al. 1976:218). Thus, the seven caves symbolize theestablishment of the settlement and the origin of a new ruling dynasty.Just as pyramids are artificial re-creations of the primordial mountain, the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Constructing Mythic Space85Chicomoztoc represents the cave from which humans emerged. Taken together,the two constructions became a powerful statement that Acatzingo Viejo wasbuilt at the very center of the cosmos, because the primordial mountain and theplace of human creation both define this spot. The importance of centering sitesis a well-recognized Mesoamerican preoccupation (Freidel et al. 1993:123–172).The cave complex also represents the generative womb of the earth that is, at thesame time, the guardian of the natural forces such as wind and water. This relatesto Eliade’s observation of the center as a place of inexhaustible abundance. Thus,the holiness of the complex made it an appropriate landmark around which tobuild a temple. The mountain/cave symbol came to represent the very basis ofethnic identity. As noted, this relationship between people and the mythic Chi-comoztoc was so deep that people were identified with the cave itself throughoutMesoamerica.AcknowledgmentsThis research was made possible by the generous support of the MesoamericanResearch Foundation, directed by Tim M. Tucker. The mapping of the caveswas carried out by Allan Cobb and John Fogarty. Arturo Montero also partici-pated during part of the investigation.

To date, onlyfour major archaeological caves have been reported in any detail. Our knowl-edge of Oaxaca is particularly incomplete because the cave sites are locatedamong only two or three ethnic groups (Figure 5.1). Pre-Hispanic cave use iscurrently known from the Cueva de Ejutla burial site in the Mixtec/Cuicatecregion (Moser 1975, 1976, 1983) and Cueva Cheve in the Cuicatec Highlands(González Licón and Márquez Morfín 1994; Steele and Snavely 1997). In theMazatec area, there are reports for the Cueva de Tenango (Winter 1984), andthe caves of the Cerro Rabón (Bitterli 1996; Hapka and Rouvinez 1994, 1997).The purpose of this chapter is to report on a fifth cave, Blade Cave, also in theMazatec area.Blade Cave, located approximately 120 kilometers north-northwest ofOaxaca City, was discovered in 1985 by a group of speleologists who, since thattime, have fielded expeditions to Huautla de Jiménez, Oaxaca, in an attempt toprove that the Huautla cave system is the deepest in the world. The chambersin Blade Cave containing archaeological material were discovered on April 12,1985, by Frank Bogle and Paul Wojtkowski. I directed the archaeological explo-ration of the cave between 1985 and 1987 as a member of the Huautla Project,which was codirected by Jim Smith and Bill Steele. The cave, named for an 18-centimeter-long bifacially chipped blade, was reported to the Oaxaca RegionalOffice of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia. In the Mexican lit-erature, the cave has been referred to as the Cueva de los Pedernales (Winter1990:124).The cave is set in a karst formation about eighteen hundred meters abovesea level in the approximate center of the Sierra Mazateca. The area is isolated,and the small cave entrance is only occasionally visited by local goatherds.

The chambers arewet with active formations. Water drips from the walls and ceiling and poolsbehind shallow rimstone dams.MethodsThe cave was surveyed using standards developed by the Cave Research Foun-dation in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky (Freeman 1975:59). The mapping wascarried out using a Suunto compass together with a Suunto inclinometer to mea-sure vertical angles, and distances were measured with a tape measure.When the cave was discovered, the absence of recent tracks and the presenceof easily transportable artifacts such as ceramic vessels and jade suggested thatthe chambers were undisturbed. Three chambers containing archaeological ma-terial were located. Each chamber was divided into zones to facilitate recording.Zones contain a cluster of cultural material or a recognizable geological entity.Zone boundaries were arbitrarily defined to encompass artifact concentrations.The research design was adapted from that developed by Watson (1974:28–29)in Salts Cave to record material qualitatively by its nature and relative density.The technique focused on describing the interrelationship of ‘‘clusters’’ of arti-facts rather than individual pieces. Each zone was photographed and sketchedand a written description was made."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Pre-Hispanic Rain Ceremonies in Blade Cave93Chamber DescriptionsThe three archaeological areas in Blade Cave are referred to as Chambers 1, 2,and 3 (Figure 5.2).

Chamber 1 contains Zones A, B, C, and G;Chamber 2 is divided into Zones D, E, and F; and Zones H, I, and J are inChamber 3.Chamber 1Chamber 1, as noted above, is divided into four zones: A, B, C, and G (Figure5.3). Because of the complexity of the deposits, Zone C is subdivided into areas.Zone AZone A measures 2.5 meters × 1.5 meters, with the floor sloping gently down-ward toward the entrance (Figure 5.4). There is some evidence of periodic flow-ing water and movement of sediments. The sediment in this zone contains ablack soot deposit.Human skeletal remains are spread over much of this zone and extend towarda boulder in Zone B. All the skulls are fragmentary, but there appear to beenough skull fragments to make up at least four individuals. Although most ofthe bones littering the surface are disarticulated, the remains of a single indi-vidual in a somewhat less disturbed condition were found along the cave wall.Robert S. Hemperly, DDS (personal communication, 1985) describes an an-terior mandible fragment as being that of a large, robust individual of aboutthirty years of age. We noted seven intact long bones, but these were in poorcondition. Along the border with Zones B and C, twenty phalanges were re-vealed in a fifty-centimeter-square section of floor where the sediment is beingeroded by water dripping from the ceiling. The scattered positions of the bonesmay indicate that they were disturbed by animals or water activity. Along thecave wall are a number of ceramic sherds, the largest of which is a broken, two-centimeter-deep, pie pan–shaped gray bowl with a twenty-two-centimeter rimdiameter.Zone BZone B is a 2-meter × 2.5-meter area defined around a large, elongated boulderlocated in the middle of the floor (see Figure 5.3).

Inaddition, a dog mandible has been placed on the boulder.On the floor between the boulder and the skeletal remains in Zone A is ascatter of beads. The beads vary in size and shape and are made of jade, coral,and shell, with jade being the most common. Finally, a broken cream-coloredjar sits on a flowstone mass along the cave wall. Half of the vessel, from rim tobase, remains.Zone CZone C, located at the western end of Chamber 1, is slightly over 3.5 meterssquare. A cache of forty-three ceramic vessels and other artifacts was depositedagainst the western wall (Figure 5.6). The artifacts are sitting on a raised areaformed by rimstone dams and flowstone which rises as it approaches the cavewall (see Figure 5.3).area 1Area 1 contains a small rimstone pool of water formed by an extension of theflowstone rise (see area labeled ‘‘Rimstone Dam Area’’ in Figure 5.3). Jade, shell,and coral beads cover the bottom of the pool. Similar beads, varying in size andshape, are densely scattered on a flowstone peninsula (labeled ‘‘rise’’ on Figure5.3). Bones of small animals occur frequently, including several mandibles simi-lar to those of a small dog. Six broken stalagmites, each measuring about sixtycentimeters in length and fifteen centimeters in width (Figure 5.6, A–F), havebeen placed on the flowstone peninsula.Six ceramic vessels have been placed in this area, as well. Three of the vessels(C5, C7, and C15) are shoe-pots. Inside the shoe-pots are bones of small ani-mals, fragments of turquoise, and stone, mostly jade, beads. The beads vary incolor from cream to green to deep blue. One shoe-pot, C7, is mammiform inshape with a rim ten centimeters in diameter and seems to have been used forwater catchment (Figure 5.7). Shoe-shaped vessels have also been found in theMazatec region in the Cueva de Tenango (Winter 1984).Vessel C14 (labeled ‘‘spiral’’ on Figure 5.6), a red-slipped jar, has three gougedspirals beginning at the base of the neck and extending around the vessel’s bodyto the base. A hollow bridge connects a spout to the vessel’s neck (Figure 5.8).This style of bridged spout dates the vessel to Monte Albán I in the Valley ofOaxaca sequence (Caso et al. 1967:Fig. 125A). Next to vessel C14 are two ob-sidian blades. There is also a ceramic disk (7 centimeters × 4.3 centimeters) in theform of a human eye.

The rectangles may have beeninlays which, along with the eye, were used in a mosaic. Mosaics have been re-ported from both the Cueva de Cheve (Steele and Snavely 1997) and the Cuevade Ejutla (Moser 1975).C16, a red bowl with a rim diameter of 13.5 centimeters, contains an arrayof jade beads and two carved jade plaques (Figure 5.9). One, 4 centimeters ×3 centimeters, is carved on three sides with a partial face containing one eye andone earplug. The second carved jade is a face, 2.5 centimeters × 1.5 centimeters,with recessed eyes. The piece is drilled in two places for suspension. With theselapidary objects are two fragments (5 centimeters × 4 centimeters) of sandstone.Next to this bowl is a rectangular bead (3.5 centimeters × 1 centimeter).The sixth vessel (C6) on the rimstone dam is a gray bowl incised with a doublewavy line and crosshatched motif that is repeated on both the exterior and theinterior. This bowl is similar to those in Area 4 (see Figure 5.6).area 2The strip of sediments on the cave floor (see Figure 5.3), extending to the flow-stone which rises to the southern wall, has been designated Area 2 (see Figure5.6). A moderate quantity of small animal bones, canine teeth, and beads ofjade, coral, and shell are visible in the mud. Eight ceramic vessels (C3, C4, C8–13), mostly dark gray, were documented in this area. Two vessels (C3 and C4),one inside of the other, sit in the center of the flowstone rise. The larger (C3) isa dark-gray bowl; C4 is a black vessel with an incised decoration. Six additionalvessels, three of which are dark-gray spouted forms, are embedded in the cavesediment. All contain green and white beads.area 3Twenty ceramic plates and bowls have been placed, often in stacks, on the flow-stone along the eastern wall in Area 3 (see Figure 5.6). There is little culturaldebris scattered on the flowstone rise, but many of the vessels contain bones andbeads. Several vessels are well-formed plates and bowls with bright red exteri-ors and black interiors. The largest plate in the cache, thirty-four centimetersin diameter, has a flared rim. A twenty-nine-centimeter-diameter bowl restson the plate. There are also more crudely made, matte-finish orange plates andbowls. Where the two colors of plates and bowls are stacked among others, theorange vessels occur above the red and black vessels. The examples from BladeCave correspond to the following Tehuacan Valley types: El Riego Gray, Qua-chilco Gray, El Riego Orange, and Quachilco Red. These ceramics characterizethe Late Santa María and Early and Late Palo Blanco phases (MacNeish et al.1970:102–176).

Seven vessels (C1, C2, C17–19, C39,C40) were recorded against the cave wall at the contact of the flowstone with thefloor sediments (see Figure 5.6). Some of the vessels have settled into the mud.Five of these are light gray vessels, several with incising (Figure 5.10). Graywareoccurs in various periods of the Tehuacan Valley and the Valley of Oaxaca se-quences.

Here we recorded four cranial fragments, a few long bones, and twenty-eight human teeth (see Figure 5.3) . According to Hemperly (personal commu-nication, 1985), the teeth may belong to as many as eight individuals: (1) one"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Pre-Hispanic Rain Ceremonies in Blade Cave103with white teeth; (2) one whose teeth have an orange pigmentation; (3) anotherwhose teeth have dark pigmentation; (4) a person with pitted teeth (a geneticor pathologic developmental defect); (5) someone with large teeth; (6 and 7)at least two children under six years of age; and (8) a child over six years ofage. There are no significant cavities in any of the teeth. A trauma-inflictedgroove was noted on one tooth, which may have been caused by an accident orby deliberate filing. It is possible that more teeth are concealed by the cave floorsediments.One gray vessel, C42, has been set along the southern wall. The form of therim indicates it may have contained a spout, but the handle is missing. Twolarge fragments of red vessels, C43 and C44, are almost completely buried inthe sediment. The visible portions, however, suggest that they probably belongto a single broken vessel.Zone GZone G was defined as the area between the entrance to Chamber I and theborder with Zones A and B (see Figure 5.3). The floor of the chamber slopesat a ten-degree angle, causing water to flow intermittently toward the entrance.Water has deposited sediment and a few human long bones in this zone. Noceramic or stone artifacts were observed.Chamber 2Zone DZone D serves as a narrow passageway leading from Zone C in Chamber 1 toZone E in Chamber 2. The passage is flanked by floor-to-ceiling columns. Halfof a dark-gray jar sits on one column. Two rimstone dams encircle small pools.In the second pool are six sherds of an orange monochrome vessel. A black ob-sidian projectile point about 3.5 centimeters in length was observed in a narrowspace along the side of the passage but could not be reached.Zone EThis zone was defined around a small room approximately 3.75 meters ×3 meters. The floor of this room sits about one meter below that of Zone D andis covered with sediment. In the middle of the entry to the room is a 1.5-meter-tall stalagmite that has been modified to resemble a face (Figure 5.11). Fromthe top of the stalagmite to the nose measures one-half meter. We named the"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"104Oaxacastalagmite the Guardian because of its watchful appearance. Five vessels wereplaced along its base and staggered toward the cave wall (Figure 5.12).An empty black hemispherical bowl (1) appears to have a hole punchedthrough the bottom. A sherd of an orange spout is resting between vessels E1and E2, but the rest of this vessel was not located (sherds—rather than wholevessels—are quite rare in Blade Cave). Next to the bowl is a blackflorero(E2),or vase with a double-bridged spout. One bridge connects to the neck and theother to theflorero’s round base. Inside are at least twelve gastropod shells andseveral jade beads. A black tripod bowl (E3) with square supports sits besidetheflorero.The bowl contains charcoal and several small jade beads as wellas mud.Vessel E4 is an orange animal effigy vessel (Figure 5.13). The single verticalspout has a bridge that connects to the back of the animal’s head. Much of thetop of the vessel is broken and missing. It contains an obsidian blade and roundjade and bone beads.The fifth vessel (E5) is small, seven centimeters in diameter, with one verticalspout, which is bridged below its rim. This black vessel contains one obsidianblade and at least two bone beads. On the cave floor directly behind this vesselis a very flat, three-centimeter-square jade disk, which has two holes drilled forsuspension.Leaning against the front of the Guardian are four broken stalagmites stand-ing on end. They measure 8 centimeters to 10 centimeters long and 4 centimetersto 7 centimeters in width. A 10 centimeter × 2 centimeter obsidian blade wasfound close to a semirectangular (10 centimeters × 13.75 centimeters) slate palletabout 2 meters from the cave wall. Hundreds of pieces of turquoise are scatteredabout the muddy floor. They are rectangular, generally 1 centimeter × 2 centi-meters, and vary in color from white to light blue-green. In addition, bones ofsmall animals are mixed with a dense scattering of jade, coral, and shell beadson the floor. A 5-centimeter-deep hole in the sediments formed by ceiling drip-water revealed more beads in the sediment.

Inthis narrow section two workedOliviashells were found two meters apart. Thepassage continues to climb and doubles back on itself. In this upper passage, aceramic incense burner appears to have been smashed by two broken stalagmitesthat are lying in the midst of the sherds. I estimate the incense burner to haveoriginally been about twenty-five centimeters tall. Elbows can be identified asprotruding from the censer’s sides and would have functioned as handles. Thearms ended in closed fists at the central bowl of the vessel.Continuing up the passage, a small vessel (10 centimeters × 15 centimeters)was encountered upside down on a stalagmite. The fit was snug. Two obsidianblades were also found in this section of the passage. Nearby was about half of awhite shell earspool. Its original diameter would have been about 4 centimeters,with a 2.5-centimeter central hole. Jade beads were scattered throughout thisarea, and charcoal was abundant.Zone JZone J is on a high ledge that is reached from the top of the Zone I passage. Toreach the ledge, ancient visitors had to swing out over a fifteen-meter verticaldrop overlooking Chamber 2. Four dark, wide-necked, spouted vessels ( J1, J2,J3, and J4) were recorded. They are incised with a step-fret motif similar to thaton the vessels in Zone C. To place one of the vessels on a ledge that is behind aflowstone column, someone had to have made a difficult and dangerous exposedfree climb.Another area included in Zone J is reached by squeezing through formationsto a balcony overlooking the lower section of the cave. More red coral pendantsand beads, similar to those in Zone H, are scattered in a 1.5-meter area closeto the edge of the balcony. Since the balcony is located 15 meters directly aboveZone H, it is likely that the beads and pendants spilled from this upper ledge.DatingDating relies on ceramic cross-dating to sequences from the Valley of Oaxaca(Caso et al. 1967) and the Tehuacan Valley (MacNeish et al. 1970). Two ofthe most common vessel forms in Blade Cave are a flat-bottomed bowl with-out curved walls and a jar with a vertical spout connected to the vessel neckby a bridge. These forms are characteristic of the Late Formative and Clas-sic Periods II and IIIa in the Valley of Oaxaca (Caso et al. 1967:Figs. 197A,192A, 285D, 263E). The incised motif on vessel C1 closely resembles those"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"108Oaxacaon the Quachilco Gray and El Riego Gray vessels from the Tehuacan Valley,which implies a Late Santa María phase or Early Palo Blanco phase for theBlade Cave vessel (MacNeish et al. 1970:Figs. 71, 91, 92). The step-fret inciseddesign on vessels C17, C39, J1, J2, J3, and J4 also occurs in those two phasesin the Tehuacan Valley (MacNeish et al. 1970:Figs. 70 and 91) and in MonteAlbán II, II–IIIa, and IIIa in the Valley of Oaxaca (Caso et al. 1967:Figs. 209B,251D, and 270D). Shoe-pots—C5, C7, and C15—and the effigy animal headvessel—E4—may date to the Early City-State stage. Several of the nonceramicartifact types are also common in this stage (Winter, personal communication,1987). The Blade Cave artifacts apparently represent the early part of this stage,because there are no polychrome vessels or metal adornments. Thus, the ar-chaeological chambers at Blade Cave contain evidence of use from the EarlyUrban stage (ad1–300) through the Early City-State stage (ad750–1250; seeTable 5.1).Interpretation of ArtifactsIn our investigations at Blade Cave we have amassed an abundance of detailedcontextual information on ancient Mazatec cave ritual. Ceramic vessels ap-pear in many cases to have held perishable offerings. Frequently, items denotingwealth, such as beads and pendants of jade, stone, shell, and coral, were includedin these offerings or added to the vessels later. Such items were also found strewnaround the floor in utilized areas. Objects of personal adornment have beennoted as being a common feature in the Maya cave artifact assemblages (Brady1989:322). The material recovered at Chichén Itzá from the Cenote of Sacri-fice, another cave feature, shows that jade was often offered individually, but alsoaccompanied other offerings, such as plates of copal with jade beads stuck in theresin (Coggins 1992; Proskouriakoff 1974). Andrews (1970:52) reports findingjade beads strewn in the mud and ashes in different areas at Balankanche.I have noted blood sacrifice on numerous occasions in the Mazatec andCuicatec regions, an important aspect of contemporary cave rituals. In addi-tion, the practice is documented in ethnographies of the Mazatec ( Johnson1939:133; Weitlaner and Hoppe 1969:520), the Cuicatec (Holland and Weit-laner 1960:392; Steele and Snavely 1997:26; Weitlaner 1969:445), the Mixe(Beals 1945:87–90, 93–94; Hoogshagen 1966:314; Lipp 1991:48–49, 144–145),the Mixtec (Ravicz and Romney 1969:373, 399), the Tepehua and the Toto-nac (Starr 1908:256–257), and the Zapotec (Beals 1935; Parsons 1936:43, 225,238, 294, 411, 508). Evidence for such modern ritual activity in caves is gener-ally in the form of remains of chickens and turkeys. In addition to chickens andturkeys, the Trique sacrifice sheep or goats (Nader 1969:413), and dog sacrificesoccur in the Mixe and Zapotec regions (de la Fuente 1949:306)."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Pre-Hispanic Rain Ceremonies in Blade Cave109Evidence of blood sacrifice is present at Blade Cave in animal remains suchas dog mandibles and the bones of other small animals. It is likely that the largebifacially chipped blades found in the cave were originally hafted in woodenhandles and used as knives in such sacrifices. Holland and Weitlaner (1960)found three large blades, hafted in their Pre-Hispanic handles, still being usedfor sacrificial purposes in the Cuicatec area in 1957. When not being used, theknives were stored in a cave.Covarrubias (1946:189) notes that Zapotec ritual consists of making offer-ings of food, flowers, jade, ceramic vessels, incense, and the blood from smallanimals and human beings who bled themselves. Obsidian prismatic blades aregenerally thought to have been used in such autosacrificial rites (Brady 1989:326–327; for detailed discussions of Maya bloodletting, see Furst 1976:182;Schele and Miller 1986:175–185). In the Valley of Oaxaca, there is evidence thatthe practice of bloodletting often accompanied rituals involving curing or peti-tions for rain or fertility dating back to the Village stage (1500–500bc) (Winter1989:87; for a discussion of Oaxacan bloodletting, see Flannery 1976:341–344).Obsidian blades are often reported from cave contexts. In the Cuicatec re-gion, obsidian blades were found scattered on the rectangular stone platformconstructed in the entrance room of Cueva Cheve (Steele and Snavely 1997).Winter presumes that the obsidian blades recovered from the Late City-Statestage Mazatec cave site of Cueva de Tenango were used in bloodletting rituals(1989:89). According to Winter (1984), slate pallets are thought to be bloodcollectors and have been found associated with prismatic blades. Thus, the pres-ence of prismatic blades in all three Blade Cave archaeological chambers andthe recovery of slate pallets in Zones B, C, and E offer strong evidence of auto-sacrificial bloodletting as part of the Blade Cave rituals.Human skeletal material is abundant in the Blade Cave assemblage. It is notcertain, however, what these individuals represent. Burgoa (1934a, 2:121–123)describes a tradition of cave burial in Oaxaca, and Moser (1975, 1976, 1983) hasdescribed one of the caves. While the osteological material has been disturbedby animals or water in Blade Cave, the context does not resemble the formalburials described by either Burgoa or Moser, so I am reluctant to attribute thehuman bones to mortuary ritual.DiscussionWhile the interpretation of artifacts has focused on ritual behaviors, little hasbeen said about the meaning of the rites or to whom they were dedicated. Inorder to explore these questions, cave use must be contextualized within Oaxa-can culture. Caves, first of all, are seen by inhabitants as sacred places and thespecific dwelling places of many supernaturals (de la Fuente 1949:265). This"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"110Oaxacamakes them a focus of worship, a fact reflected in the Mixe use of the same wordfor church and cave shrines (Beals 1945:64). The principal deity of the earliestpeople at Monte Albán was the jaguar/baby-faced god of rain and lightning,who lived in a cave and who, according to Burgoa (1934a:Chap. 28, quoted inCovarrubias 1946:78–79), was the ancestor of the Zapotec rain-lightning god,Cocijo (Covarrubias 1946:153, 181–183).Another widespread belief revolves around a figure often called the EarthLord, who is thought of as thedueño,or owner, of the animals, the land, andits fertility. Mitla Zapotec deities include the ‘‘owners’’ of the caves (Parsons1936:210, 214–215, 509–510). In the Cuicatec region, most beliefs focus on amystical figure called the Señor del Cerro, who dwells in Cerro Cheve. The soulsof curers are said to go to the mountain and its caves (Weitlaner 1969:444–446).The Mazatec also fear the Masters of the Earth, who live underground ( Johnson1939:136–137).The petitions for rain are among the most important ceremonies conductedin caves. In order to make rain, the Mazatec specialist will pray in a cave. If itthunders as he enters, the spirits are angry. It is said that thunder is controlledby little old men. As part of the ritual the Mazatec will sprinkle water so it willrain ( Johnson 1939:136–137). The most important Mixtec ritual is also directedtoward the invocation of rain (Ravicz and Romney 1969:373, 394). The Mixe,like other groups, also associate rain with caves (Beals 1945:68, 90, 94; Hoogs-hagen 1966:316; Lipp 1991:49). The Zapotec believe that rain is formed deepin caves in the earth (de la Fuente 1949:265–266). Among the Ichcatec, if thedios de la lluvia(god of rain) has been given offerings of food, fowl, flowers, andincense, which should be buried, the next day a white cloud will appear at dawnand it will rain (Hoppe and Weitlaner 1969:503).The foregoing has focused on the importance of caves, earth, and water be-cause the investigators believe that the ceremonies conducted in Blade Cave wereprimarily petitions for rain. This interpretation was suggested by the discoveryof the Guardian in Zone E of Chamber 2. Modified or sculpted stalagmiteshave been reported in both ethnohistorical and ethnographic contexts as beingdirectly associated with rain.The seventeenth-century Dominican chronicler Francisco de Burgoa (1934b:478–481) reported an incident between a priest, Father Jerónimo Abrego, andChocho caciques. Father Jerónimo told how the Lord withheld rain because ofsin, to impress on the native population the need to come to the Lord every dayto ask for daily bread. A cacique answered, ‘‘My father, this may well happen inother pueblos, but here we have a very obliging god of the rains and we try toserve him in all that he asks of us, and for that he usually blesses us with suffi-cient water and extra seeds for our sustenance.’’ When the priest asked, ‘‘Wheredo you have this god?’’ the chief replied that his temple was in a great cave."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Pre-Hispanic Rain Ceremonies in Blade Cave111Father Abrego went to the cave and destroyed everything, breaking the idolsmade from altered stalagmites. The priest converted the people when the godsfailed to kill the priest (Burgoa 1934b:478–481).Burgoa (1934a, 1:318A) relates another, almost identical, incident involvinga Father Benito Hernández and mentions such idols as being in other caves (Bur-goa 1934a, 2:122). In 1652, four Mixtec men were accused of having entered acave near their community center to engage in traditional idolatrous acts. Oneman was said to have gone into the cave in the company of the other three withwax candles, copal incense, and fire and to have delivered a prayer for rain beforea carved-stone idol, which is likely to have been a stalagmite (Spores 1984:152–153).Perhaps to accommodate the Catholic priests, on New Year’s Day in 1889, inthe Mixe region, people entered a cave to venerate two stalagmites considered tobe Saints Peter and Paul. Nevertheless, these Mixe brought tamales and turkeys,leaving the heads there and spattering the blood around the stones (Miller andVilla Rojas 1956:211).Caves are still considered sacred places throughout the Mixteca Alta. Raviczand Romney note that among the Mixtec there is ‘‘a widespread association ofidolandhillorcavewithasettlement...IntheAlta,oneormoreelders officiatein a cave, making offerings on altars of natural stone before a stalagmite or carvedstone representing Sabi (Savi, Sawi), Rain’’ (1969:394). Inside one cave there isa stalagmite called the Archbishop, which is an object of veneration (Byland andPohl 1994:202–203). The connection between these stalagmite-idols and rain isalso found in the Mixe area. Lipp (1991:49) notes, ‘‘Some men who had removedone of these artifacts [idol] from a cave became frightened on the road when itbegan to thunder tumultuously and so returned the piece to its proper place. Thesame thing occurred to another man who believed he was being chased by redthunder when returning from a mountain with an idol he had found there . . .When another person brought an idol down from a mountain, thunder and rainbegan so furiously that the entire village became frightened.’’Perhaps the most convincing demonstration of the relationship between cave,speleothems, and rain comes, ironically, from outside of a cave. Schultze Jena(1938:65) observed a stone shaft with sculpted human features, which was calledSáwi. Packed around the shaft were small stones that represented rain. The shaftwas enclosed within a constructed rock enclosure which was called Wé’e Sáwi,House of Rain. Monaghan (1987:420–421) notes that this term refers to par-ticular caves that are rain shrines. Thus, even outside of the cave, rain is invokedusing very clear cave and stalagmite symbolism.The above descriptions appear to offer solid data on which to base an inter-pretation of the Guardian figure. The sources seem to suggest that the figurerepresented a rain deity and, therefore, that the ceremonies within Blade Cave"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"112Oaxacawere petitions for rain. Furthermore, I suspect that Blade Cave functioned veryspecifically as a Mazatec equivalent of the Mixtecve’i save,‘‘house of rain’’ or‘‘rain shrine.’’ Modern Mixtec rain shrines are located in caves that frequentlycontain pools of fresh, pure water. Rain shrines are damp inside, even at theheight of the dry season, and the people say that the drops of water that fallfrom the ceiling of the cave are ‘‘raindrops’’ (Monaghan 1995:107). Both the wetcondition of the cave and the intensity of utilization that has been documentedhere suggest that Blade Cave functioned as this important type of site.ConclusionsThe harsh environmental conditions surrounding the cave, including the steep-ness and rockiness of the climb to reach it along with the perilous drop intomany cave entrances, means that visiting the site was no casual affair. The sea-sonal winds, rains, mud, and swollen streams for half the year would have pre-sented the same challenges to the Pre-Hispanic traveler as they do today. YetBlade Cave presents abundant evidence of frequent utilization. This utilizationappears to date from the Early Urban stage (ad1–300) and during the EarlyCity-State stage (ad750–1250).The use of stalagmites with pecked faces to represent rain deities has beenso well documented in Oaxaca that there can be little doubt that this is whatthe Guardian figure at Blade Cave is supposed to represent. As I have argued,this figure provides the evidence for what I consider to be the dominant ori-entation toward rain ceremonies. However, as Ravicz and Romney suggest inthe ethnographic context, communities strongly identify with these idols. Sincethese ‘‘houses of rain’’ are community focuses, it is quite likely that Blade Caveplayed an important role in the politico-religious life of its community. The pres-ence of jade, turquoise, ceramic vessels, obsidian blades, coral beads,Oliveshells,and the remains of what may have been elaborate mosaics suggests elite-levelparticipation in, and therefore direction of, rituals in Blade Cave.It is unfortunate that resources did not permit us to attempt to locate theurban center to which Blade Cave was attached. If a second expedition can bemounted, the clarification of the political affiliation would be a high priority.AcknowledgmentsSpecial thanks are due Dr. James E.

Over the ages, flowing water has sculpted deep canyons andnumerous caves and caverns. Some of these caves are truly spectacular in termsof size and the antiquity of use by humans. A great number of small caves androck shelters were also formed as running water undercut softer deposits, namely,layers of conglomerates and welded tuffs along the contacts of faulted limestoneblocks.The subterranean enclosed areas, or chambers, of caves and caverns varygreatly in size. In some cases, they measure kilometers in length, while othersare nothing more than shallow depressions a few meters in depth. Rock over-hangs along the area’s deeply incised streams also present cavelike features andare decorated with paintings that suggest they were used for ceremonial pur-poses.The purpose of this chapter is to present a context for understanding theritual use of caves in the Mixteca by referring to recent discoveries in the Coixtla-huaca Basin. This basin occupies the northernmost section of the Mixteca Altain the mountainous region known as the Sierra Madre del Sur (Figure 6.1). Oneof these caves provides a unique opportunity to understand the role that land-forms seem to have played in the cosmology and religion of the region. I draw oncolonial-period documentation, Pre- and Post-Hispanic codices, and artifactualmaterials found in caves, including paintings on walls, to make inferences aboutthe ancient cave rituals that were performed.Owing to their great numbers and to the very antiquity of the tradition, cavesfigure prominently in the origin, traditions, and ritual lives of the Mixteca’s in-habitants: the Chocho-Popoloca, the Ixcatec, and the Mixtec.

References to the prevalence and significance of cavesas places of worship are found in the codices and in the written accounts ofthe colonial Spanish from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. The Pre-Hispanic rituals of the Mixteca Alta, however, were not as well documented bythe Spaniards as they were for Central Mexico. Nevertheless, some of the ex-tant documentary sources refer to several of the better-known cave-shrines ofthe Mixteca Alta. The codices provide simplified views of what appear to becave ceremonies (Figure 6.3). These sources usually portray one elite personagemaking an offering, although the nature, circumstances, or purpose for whichthe rituals were carried out is somewhat unclear. Colonial-period reports por-tray cave rituals as mysterious, pagan cults for devil worship that took place inremote locations, far from villages and their churches. Ritual activities not re-lated to the Catholic Church necessarily had to be performed secretly, since theentire community was expected to congregate for catechism and mass and con-vincingly demonstrate that all its members embraced Christianity. Few refer-ences indicate why the rituals were performed; instead, they focus on attemptsto eradicate them through Christian indoctrination and persecution of thosepracticing them.Understanding Cave PowerCaves and mountains constitute points of reference along the horizon that areused in demarcating and asserting a community’s dominion over its territory.Throughout Mesoamerica, temples or pyramids were often constructed on ornear these powerful landforms, and settlement configuration was influenced bytheir presence (Brady 1997; Heyden 1976). The community enclave, includingits mountains and caves, forms a sacred conceptual unit that is honored and up-held by its loyal inhabitants (Rincón Mautner 1997:130). Ravicz and Romney(1969:394) report that there is still a ‘‘widespread association of idol, hill or cavewith a settlement’’ for the Mixtec, with supernatural power mostly concentratedin promontory features. Indigenous people have long sought divine interventionby contacting supernaturals and ancestors at these nodal, isolated points in thelandscape. Such places constitute true sacred centers, close to the divine and notso accessible as to be used daily (Carmagnani 1988:26, 30–31).

Itscaves and oracles were visited and consulted even by peoples living far from theregion (González Licón and Márquez Morfín 1994; Martínez 1991:225; Spores1967:25–27, 179; Spores 1983:344; Spores 1984:144–145, 152–153; Vázquez deEspinosa 1944:153). Yet, as this chapter will demonstrate, the evidence for ritualuse of caves in this region is much older. Idols kept in temples, as well as thestalagmites found in caves, were revered for their powerful oracular-divinatoryfunctions; they were believed to accurately foretell the future or provide nativecurers with the power to heal disease (Dahlgren 1979:313–314; Spores 1984:150–152). Even ancient rock paintings found on a cave’s walls were believed tohave been drawn by the deities that inhabited them. For instance, in 1501, in acave near Coixtlahuaca, the ‘‘Devil’’ foretold the arrival of the Spanish, picturedon horseback together with chickens from Castille, some seventeen years beforetheir arrival (Martínez 1991:225). Moctezuma II is said to have sent a delega-tion to consult the great oracle at Achiutla, in all likelihood a cave, to discoverthe purpose of the Spaniards’ coming and to foresee the fate that awaited hispeople (Burgoa 1934a:276–277).In his late-seventeenth-century chronicle, the Dominican Burgoa (1934b:337–341) refers to several cave shrines that the first missionaries of his orderencountered in the previous century, when they began to convert the people ofthe Mixteca Alta to Christianity. One of these caves was located in the regionof the central Mixteca Alta near Chalcatongo, a village known in Mixtec asÑuu Ndaya, which translates as ‘‘Land of the Dead.’’ This Mixtec name mayrefer to the large cave on the mountain of Cervatillos that was a royal necropo-lis, the final resting place for rulers of the important lineage of Tilantongo andother places. This cave was probably an ossuary where the relict bundles of thekings were deposited. It is believed to have been completely destroyed in the six-teenth century by Benito Hernández, one of the Dominican missionaries work-ing in the area. Several scholars have posited that this cave is represented in theCodices Bodley, Zouche-Nuttall, and Colombino as a temple with a skull andcrossbones on the roof (Byland and Pohl 1994; Jansen 1982:249; Jansen andPérez Jiménez 2000:117–120; Pohl 1994). A priestess named 9 Grass presidedhere and was consulted by members of the nobility. The oracle and priestess seemto have played an important role in mediating and ending factional disputes,either by reducing political tension through arranged marriages or by encourag-ing warfare. Jansen and Pérez Jiménez (2000:119) state that the cave’s locationremains unknown."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"122OaxacaAnother powerful cave is located at Cahua Laki, or Devil’s Rock, along thehigh cliffs that surround Apoala, a Mixtec-speaking village in the eastern Mix-teca Alta. A flying snake penetrated this rocky outcrop ( Jansen 1982:104), cre-ating a cave approximately fifty meters in depth. The cave is also known asthe Cave of the Monkey That Frightens because, from a distance, the largestalagmite in its interior resembles an anthropomorphic figure (López García1997:278). This cave is believed to have been inhabited by the ancestors ofApoala’s residents when they emerged from the tree at creation. Classic- andPostclassic Period potsherds and a few intact vessels have been found inside thecave ( Jansen 1982:106). One of the legends mentions that newborn childrendisappeared at the cave, so the priests blessed it and placed crosses at its entrance(López García 1997:278).Despite extensive acculturation, caves continue to be used for ritual purposesby communities throughout the Mixteca. As in ancient times, all space is be-lieved to belong to a deity; its use by the community is validated by periodicreciprocity in the form of offerings and sacrifice. Thus, ritual ceremonies mustbe performed in a cave to propitiate its ‘‘owner.’’ These deities and forces arestill believed to control occurrences on the earth’s surface.1For instance, manyof the rituals practiced in caves focus on rain prognostication and are related tothe agricultural cycle (Broda 1991:465–467; Grigsby 1986; Ravicz and Romney1969:394; Spores 1983:344). Petitioners seeking divine intervention approachthe hill or mountain spirits through a cave or by climbing to a mountain sum-mit. In times of drought, masses are said on mountaintops. In the more isolatedpueblos of this region, an individual’s extraordinary good fortune or wealth isoften regarded by other members of the community as the result of an arrange-ment made with thechanequeortlapizque,names for the guardian spirit that‘‘owns’’ a cave in the vicinity of their town.Creation, Human Origins, and the Beginning of ReciprocityThroughout Mesoamerica, the earth and naturally occurring phenomena areoften explained as being imbued with animating qualities, a ‘‘life’’ that closelyresembles the attributes observed in animals and plants. This dynamic character-ization based on resemblance serves as the basis for a classification system that isrich in metaphor and composed of fluid categories that represent a continuum ofshared traits. These shared characteristics are most obvious in animals, to whichhumans are related through thetonaconcept (Ravicz and Romney 1969:394).This concept connotes qualities of warmth and animation (i.e., becoming liveand moving). Air flowing from a cave entrance is comparable to the earth’sbreath flowing from a giant mouth."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Sacred Caves and Rituals from the Northern Mixteca123Many indigenous groups view the earth as an anthropomorphic female, fierceand monstrous in appearance with avian and reptilian attributes. One of thesurviving Tolteca-Chichimeca traditions records how, at the time of creation,the earth came to be. The Earth Goddess was brought down from heaven andtied down over the primeval waters by two gods, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca,who had transformed themselves into giant serpents (Garibay 1985:108). Theysqueezed the goddess with such force that they split her in two and made theearth from her back. In order to make up for the injury and suffering she hadendured, all of the other gods descended from heaven to console her, but de-creed that all food necessary for human sustenance must flow from her. In orderto make this possible, they made trees, flowers, and herbs from her hair; shortgrasses and flowers from her skin; pools, springs, and small caves from her eyes;rivers and caverns from her mouth; and valleys and mountains from her nose.The goddess cried at night, craving to eat the hearts of men. She would not stopwailing unless she was fed and would give no fruit unless she was soaked with theblood of men. This account refers to the beginning of reciprocity, whereby a por-tion of the goods obtained from the land—blood (life), smoke, incense, flowers,and food—has to be given back to the earth via ritual offerings. Through thisexchange, humans can appease and renew their pact with the gods and restorethe balance between the spaces still occupied by the divine and those in whichthe community is embedded (Carmagnani 1988:47–48).The scene where the goddess is tied up by the large snakes seems to be of greatrelevance to the establishment of the Chocho-Popoloca in the CoixtlahuacaBasin as it is represented on many of the basin’s codices orlienzos(colonial-period indigenous paintings on loosely woven cotton sheets) as a sacred moun-tain (see Figure 6.15). I will refer to this mountain again in the section oncodices.There is a belief in the Mixteca that caves are made by a supernatural creaturethat splits mountains and rock outcrops. This supernatural cave maker has beendepicted with a turtle’s carapace or the segmented abdomen of an insect hold-ing stone knives in its hands (see Figure 6.12). This creature seems to be one ofthe twins mentioned in the legend compiled by García (1981:328) at Cuilapan.Both twins bear the name 9 Wind, the calendrical name given Quetzalcoatl,whose Nahuatl name also means ‘‘precious twin.’’ According to the story, oneof the twins would transform himself into a small winged serpent that woulddart through the air and penetrate rock walls making a great noise (thunder).Even his name, Wind of Nine Caves, is clearly associated with caves. Like hisbrother, he adopted the animal figure as a sign to everyone that he had the powerto transform himself. The creature can be identified as ayahui,which means‘‘sorcerer’’ in Mixtec (Smith 1973:60–64) or axiuhcoatl,which means ‘‘fire ser-pent’’ in Nahuatl (Furst 1978:61). ‘‘Sorcerer,’’ ‘‘priest,’’ and ‘‘shaman’’ may be"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"124Oaxacaequivalent terms. In Apoala at certain times of year, balls of fire cross the skylate at night. These are believed to penetrate and exit the walls of the high cliffsthat surround this village, passing from one rocky cliff to another (López García1997:280). (A rare form of lightning, known by climatologists as ball lightning,is slower and its glow dimmer than other forms of lightning and could perhapsaccount for this phenomenon.) The attributes of this creature may have also beeninspired by the firefly.Indigenous groups like the Chocho of the Coixtlahuaca Basin shared anotherTolteca-Chichimeca tradition: their ancestors originated from the paramountsacred place known as Chicomoztoc, or Seven Caves. Even the gods were bornfrom this legendary place when a flint blade fell from heaven and struck theground (Mendieta 1971:83). The emergence from Seven Caves is recorded ontwo of the Coixtlahuaca Basin’s colonial-period codices: Codex Coixtlahuaca Iand Codex Tlalpitepec. The Ixcatec to the northeast also recorded their ori-gins from a cave on Codex Seler I, a lost canvas painting from the village ofSanta María Ixcatlan. According to a sketch made of its general layout, therewas a cave near the center with lines radiating from it (Rincón Mautner 1996b).The late-sixteenth-century report states that the name of the village was derivedfrom the offerings of cotton left inside a ‘‘round’’ cave (which was called Oloztoc)during the celebration of certain ceremonies (Velázquez de Lara 1984:227). Al-though it provides no direction from the village, the report states that the cavewas located about three leagues away. Furthermore, the villagers believed thatthe cave had been made by a ‘‘famous captain’’ who had sought to irrigate his cot-ton fields. I have identified the cave mentioned in the report and on the SeldenRoll and other codices as the Colossal Natural Bridge (Puente Natural) on theNdaxagua River (Río Rosario) (Rincón Mautner 1995:58; 1996a; 1999), which,it seems, was claimed by both Coixtlahuaca and Ixcatlan in the late sixteenthcentury. This cave will be discussed in detail in the next section.The Abode of the Wind God: Sacred Entranceinto the Coixtlahuaca BasinThe Colossal Natural Bridge is a cave with double entrances located in the ex-treme northern end of the Coixtlahuaca Basin. It is a tunnel which seems tohave functioned as a sacred subterranean entrance into the basin (see Figure 6.1).Following the streambed up from the Xiuquila River through the tunnel, thesteep canyon of this now dry watercourse opens up into a broad, well-wateredvalley that lies within the basin. The cave is known to the local people as thePuente Natural, or the Colossal Natural Bridge. Since a number of documen-tary sources (including several Coixtlahuaca codices) refer to this cave, it has"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"Sacred Caves and Rituals from the Northern Mixteca125been possible to place it in cosmological, historical, and ritualistic contexts. As Iwill describe in the section on codex depictions, the cave-tunnel was believed tobe the place where Quetzalcoatl descended from heaven. In addition, it was theentrance used both by priests bearing deity bundles and by ancestors of the prin-cipal lineage on their way to becoming lords of Coixtlahuaca. Rock art foundin its interior suggests protracted ritual use. A Late Postclassic Period carvedmountain lion femur found on the cave’s floor provides additional insights intothis important cave, its sacred nature, and its link to the deity Quetzalcoatl.This cold, dry, and drafty cave formed in a faulted limestone block throughwhich a stream once flowed. The name Ndaxagua, or Río Rosario, which I havegiven the cave, is derived from the name given to the area around the stream’sheadwaters where springs still flow. The limestone tunnel that formed by theundercutting of this stream is approximately 250 meters in length, 50 metersin height, and 50 meters in width. The cave-tunnel is generally oriented alongan east-west axis. It has a steep grade, dropping approximately 100 meters overits length, so that its vertically elongated eastern opening is approximately 100meters below the horizontally elongated western opening. Viewed from a prom-ontory across and above the Xiuquila Canyon, this cave opening resembles avulva. In contrast, the western cave entrance, as viewed from the vantage pointof the Cerro Escalera, resembles an enormous, gaping maw (Figure 6.4).Because of its orientation, shape, and two very large entrances, the Colos-sal Natural Bridge must have been regarded as a very special cave. Access to itis difficult, as it lies in a deep, steep canyon filled with enormous boulders; itssize dwarfs the human visitor (Figure 6.5). Much of the pictorial corpus foundinside the cave consists of images consonant with native views of the Under-world, a place of foreboding where sacrifices were made and visions were sought.Most of the images found along the northern wall seem to have had a divinatorypurpose.The Pictographic Record on the Cave’s WallsThe anthropomorphic and animal figures, along with calendar glyphs, depictedon the walls of the Colossal Natural Bridge inform us of a ritual complex de-rived from an elaborate Classic and Postclassic Period cosmology. The rock artcontains a number of styles that are difficult to date, though it seems reason-able to assume that they correspond to different epochs. What may be someof the earliest paintings consist of rhomboid designs and small stick figures ofhumans and animals. In sharp contrast are the elaborate glyphs with cartouchesand bar-dot numerical notation produced during the Classic Period (ad300–750). This formal style was in use throughout a broad area and is now recognized"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Figure 6.4.Steep cliffs above the dry canyon of the Ndaxagua River frame the westernentrance to the cave-tunnel.

In referring to Ñuiñe-style glyphs, I use the same letter designationthat Zapotec glyphs from the Valley of Oaxaca receive based on the classifica-tion scheme proposed by Caso (1928, 1947) and discussed and elaborated onby Urcid (1992). These same designations have been applied to materials fromMixteca Baja Classic Period sites by Moser (1972, 1977, 1983) and RodríguezCano (1996:79–89).The aforementioned sixteenth-century report describes figures with ‘‘headarmor resembling duck heads’’ (Velázquez de Lara 1984:227–228). At least fivepaintings found inside the cave depict anthropomorphic figures with protrudingbeaklike, buccal masks (Rincón Mautner 1999:Figs. 59, 62, 64). These beakscover only the mouths of the figures and suggest lips in the act of blowing orwhistling. A reasonable interpretation would seem to be that such masks con-note breath or wind. Circular lines billow out like whirls from one the largest ofthese figures (Figure 6.6). The buccal masks are similar to the representationsof Classic Period urns from the Valley of Oaxaca and Postclassic renditions ofQuetzalcoatl as Wind God in Motolinía (1979:7), Seler’s (1963:2:70) interpre-tations of Codex Borgia, the polychrome vessel of Nochixtlan, and the works ofother scholars (Nicholson 1971, 1978; Paddock 1994)."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"128OaxacaThe cave’s interior is cold and windy, with very strong gusts during thunder-storms. The sound of thunder and rushing water during and after a rainstormresonates within it. The wind’s strength varies seasonally as well as under highlylocalized weather conditions, and yet there is also a daily rhythm to wind flow.During the morning, the wind blows gently and steadily from the east throughthe cave and out the western entrance. As the day warms, the force of the wind,which continues to blow from the east, intensifies. By late afternoon it tendsto calm; and as night approaches, the wind direction reverses, blowing fromthe mountains and out through the eastern opening. The changing wind direc-tion—within the cave’s interior from night to day and from season to season—as well as the depiction of figures with buccal masks support the hypothesis thatthis drafty tunnel was the abode of the Wind God (Rincón Mautner 1995:55–57). However, given that the cave is a passageway into the Coixtlahuaca Basin,it is interesting to note Durán’s (1967:1:81) reference to Tlaloc, the Rain andEarth God, as the ‘‘Long Cave’’ or a subterranean road. As stated above, thereport from Ixcatlan refers to the tunnel passage as having been made by a ‘‘fa-mous captain,’’ in all likelihood, Quetzalcoatl (Rincón Mautner 1995:58–60;1999:Fig. 46).2High on the northern wall of the cave, near its eastern opening, is a groupof paintings consisting of dates and the figures of a seated personage and a fullskeletonized figure (Figure 6.7; Rincón Mautner 1999:Fig. 64, 271–278). Thecomposition in red pigment is difficult to see because of the calcium carbon-ate that has been deposited on it. The panel covers an area of approximately250 centimeters × 100 centimeters. A full drawing of the entire panel may beseen in Figure 6.7. The seated personage near the center resembles the seatedrulers along the right side of the registers on the Lápida de Noriega attributedto Period IIIb–IV (ad500–750) at Monte Albán (Caso 1965:Fig. 18; Marcus1983:Fig. 7.5).3The cave figure is similarly attired with a buccal mask, a robe, acape, and a conical hat. The robe and cape are decorated with spots or markings,suggesting that it is a garment made from an ocelot or jaguar pelt.4The figurepoints toward the cave’s interior, with a right hand on a left arm. The bent rightarm holds a rod that projects upward. Above the figure’s head is a mountainglyph with an eye or opening that resembles a crocodilian eye or the entrance toa cave. A human skull (glyph H) rests on the mountain glyph.To the right of the seated figure, the head of a lord (glyph X) is drawn inprofile with an elaborate headdress representing glyph U projecting from a bandabove his forehead. The coefficient that accompanies this glyph unit is the nu-meral one. The glyph for the day 2 Alligator (glyph V), characterized by a croco-dilian eye depicted above a row of at least three sharp teeth, is also represented.There is a strong possibility that this glyph might also represent the MonteAlbán IIIa rendition of a raindrop (glyph C; see Urcid 1992:1:139–143; 2:Fig."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Sacred Caves and Rituals from the Northern Mixteca129Figure 6.7.Drawing of a Late Classic Period panel inÑuiñestyle painted on the northernwall near the eastern cave opening of the Colossal Natural Bridge, Tepelmeme, Oaxaca.Drawing by the author.4.70). A quadripartite banner protrudes above this glyph and is crowned by adiadem of circles and streamers. Next to it is a cluster of glyphs that are notenclosed by cartouches. These include a trifoliate plant on a snakelike coil (aheadless coiled snake, glyph Y?) with the numeral eleven below it and above it,the representation of a monkey’s head (glyph O) with a volute emerging fromthe mouth area like a speech or sound scroll. In front of the monkey’s face is atwo-legged vessel.Another cluster of dates may be seen to the right of the seated figure’s back. Acouple of these day signs also incorporate the crocodilian eye and are accompa-nied by the numeral one, suggesting origins: 1 Alligator, 1 Serpent.5In addition,there are the dates 5 Reed (glyph D, Urcid 1997:Fig. 8) and 10 Moth or Owl(glyph F). Although the interpretation of the latter glyph, which is enclosed byan elaborate cartouche, may seem ambiguous, these two signs may be equivalent,since there is a moth in the region with a wing coloration pattern that mimicsthe face of an owl.To the left of the seated figure and toward the cave’s interior is the repre-sentation of a skeletonized figure whose heart is still in place. The depictionof the heart as a trispiral, also described as a ‘‘three scrolled swastika’’ (Acosta1959:Fig. 18; Urcid 1992:2:Fig. 5.31), is similar to representations found on acarved stone monument from San José Mogote (Flannery and Marcus 1983:58;Urcid 1992:2:187).

The eye and tears are remarkably like those ofthe crying captives depicted in the last scenes of Codex Zouche-Nuttall as theyare being sacrificed (Rincón Mautner 1999:Fig. 65). In the codex, one of theprinces on the scaffold is being approached by an armed and threatening war-rior who wears a skeleton mask and a headdress of flints and stars (Figure 6.8).Interestingly, the skeletonized figure on the cave wall also seems to direct itsattention at the symbol of the teary eye.6Continuing along the northern wall near the cave’s center is a scene depict-ing the masked man or deity with outstretched arms presented in Figure 6.6.

The deer’s head resembles images of the Zapotec corpusbeginning in Monte Albán IIIa, where it is classified as glyph G (Caso 1928:34;Urcid 1992:1:118–120). Spots of red pigment stain the deer’s outline, suggestingthat the intent was to portray the animal as having been killed or sacrificed afterit was caught. When an area is affected by extreme drought, deer, the largest ani-mals in the forest, succumb to dehydration and present symptoms that includean edematous, swollen tongue that can no longer be retracted into the mouth. Asimilar rendition of a deer in the context of drought is represented in the CodexDresden (López Castro 1983:Pl. 45), where a clear allusion is made to the RainGod as holding torches as if scorching the earth with drought.On the south wall, at the western entrance to the tunnel, is a rare exampleFigure 6.9.Drawing of the Rain God, Cocijo, or Xicani, the sacrificer, depicted inFigure 6.6, who here is facing a deer that seemsseverely dehydrated.

Ratherthan clusters of glyphs with possible divinatory ritual significance, like those de-scribed above, this linear text is in sequence and meant to be read from left toright. The text appears to be older than the panel near the eastern tunnel en-trance, possibly dating to the poorly documented Early Ñuiñe phase (200bc–ad300; see Rincón Mautner 1995:49–53; 1999:261–262; also mentioned by Bus-tamante 1997:52–53, and Spores 1997:62–63). The tentative age ascribed tothis composition is based on a stylistic comparison with materials from the Val-ley of Oaxaca. Four glyphic units compose what is one of the largest pictographic‘‘texts’’ ever reported for Mesoamerica. The composition is unique because ofits extraordinary beauty and rarity and its remarkable condition. Most knownexamples of Ñuiñe writing consist of glyphs sculpted on boulders that were onceassembled in a specific sequence, almost all of which have been displaced fromtheir original positions. Since the Ndaxagua text is painted rather than sculpted,it is one of the only known examples of Ñuiñe writing that retains its sequence.The first glyph unit in the painted text refers to the burning of an offer-ing, perhaps copal, pitch pine branches (ocote), rubber, cotton, or tobacco, tothe Rain or Lightning God, Cocijo (Córdova 1987:141) on the day 10 Owl(glyph F).

The principal qualifying element abovethe mountain glyph appears to be the representation of a very special mortu-ary bundle. Several elements may be discerned, including a headdress decoratedwith circles and what may be an eye and facial stripes. Surmounting the bundleis a flower and above it what resembles a cut conch shell, flowing water, or anunfolding fern tendril. A sound scroll and a leaf project to either side of thebundle. Two human footprints descend from the mountain glyph in the direc-tion of a coiled rattlesnake with a retroflexed snout. A leaf- or bladelike ele-ment emerges from the mouth, while barbs project from the lower jaw. As inthe codices, human footprints are used to indicate direction and movement.A few meters beyond the threshold of the western cave entrance is a repre-sentation of a standing sacrificial victim whose arms are tied behind his back(see Figure 6.10). He is bleeding or ejaculating into the stream that flows intothe cave. Even though he lacks the buccal mask and clothing, I originally inter-preted the unusual representation of the naked, bleeding sacrificial victim by thewestern cave opening as a penitent Quetzalcoatl (Rincón Mautner 1995:62). Ibased my interpretation on Motolinía (1979:7), who referred to the ribbon orleather strap tied to Quetzalcoatl’s shoulder. Consistent with this interpretationis its reference in theLeyenda de los solesof the Codex Chimalpopoca (CódiceChimalpopoca1975:121) in which Quetzalcoatl bleeds his penis over the bonesof a male and a female to create the people of the Fifth Sun. The stenciledarm and hand in front of the naked figure at the threshold of the cave could beloosely interpreted as the ‘‘signature’’ of a sacrificial victim (usually a slave; seeSahagún 1989:1:162), although the custom was for the imprints of both handsto be placed on the threshold of the master’s doorway.The Colossal Natural Bridge’s Classic Period pictorial legacy probably in-spired and served to preserve more ancient mythical-historical traditions. Theevidence strongly suggests that the people using the cave during the Postclas-sic Period appropriated and reworked several of the ideas from the cave paint-ings and incorporated them into their cultural tradition, which survived in thecodices and bone scepter discussed in the next sections. The masked seated figurepointing the way through the cave-tunnel (Figure 6.7) brings to mind the ac-count of Quetzalcoatl leading his people through the mountain as described andillustrated in Codex Ríos (Figure 6.11; Ehrle 1900; see also Rincón Mautner1995:58n 29; 1999:Fig. 46). The Ñuiñe text on the cave wall also illustrates thebasic theme found in the Selden Roll, in which this deity’s relic bundle is takento the Mountain of the Intertwined Snakes. This place name is closely associatedwith Coixtlahuaca, which, in turn, means ‘‘Plain of Snakes.’’ I have also dis-cussed how the bleeding naked man depicted on the cave wall could have beeninterpreted as a portrait of Quetzalcoatl and ancestor to the royal Toltec lineages"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"134OaxacaFigure 6.11.Quetzalcoatl and Xipe lead the people through a cave-tunnel, asrepresented in Codex Ríos (Vaticanus A).

Many of theseactivities seem to be have been directed at vision seeking and the pursuit of anoutcome that was favorable to human survival. Whether for rain propitiationor ruler making, the basic themes are those of fertility and renewal. Evidently,the cave’s pictographic record invokes the powerful theme of transformation byreferring to life, sacrifice, and death. In all likelihood, the Colossal Bridge wasa place used for rituals associated with the shaman’s or ruler’s transformationduring vision-seeking experiences. Transformation is also evoked by the relativesize of the paintings found near each of the tunnel entrances. The elements inthe panel by the eastern entrance are small compared with the very large glyphsof the text and the full-sized, naked human male on the opposite wall, by thewestern portal.The choice of pigments for these compositions may also be of significance.While the panel is painted red, the glyphic units in the text combine black,white, and red; the naked man, to the right of the text, is also painted red.Depictions of the Colossal Cave-Tunnelin the Coixtlahuaca Basin CodicesInferences about the ritual significance of the cave at the Colossal Natural Bridgemay be drawn from a number of sixteenth-century paintings, known as ‘‘lienzos,’’"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Sacred Caves and Rituals from the Northern Mixteca135that belonged to the rulers of communities in the Coixtlahuaca Basin. Severalof these paintings refer to two landforms: the cave-tunnel described previously;and a sacred mountain. Their eventual appropriation, in the reenactment of cre-ation, seems to mark the establishment of the Chocho-Popoloca in the region.Upon arriving in the Coixtlahuaca Basin, the priests leading the people may havebeen looking for certain signs, which they recognized on these two landforms,so they decided to settle.The cave-tunnel is most clearly depicted on the Selden Roll as the open mawsof two earth monsters that face opposite directions (Figure 6.12).8Quetzalcoatlis in the upper register, seated above a multitiered, star-studded heaven. Foot-prints lead down from heaven to the gaping upper maw that corresponds to theeastern cave entrance. Two pairs of chanting attendant priests face each otheracross the maw. Their names all incorporate the day sign Flint.Below them is the western entrance decorated with seven hearts.9Ayahuiholds a flint knife in each hand and foot. Flint blades adorn his hair, which istied in a topknot. The upper entrance and the spaces where four priests oncestood can also be seen on the now-defaced Gómez de Orozco fragment (CasoFigure 6.12.Quetzalcoatl seated in heaven and footprints marking his descent into theColossal Bridge. The two cave entrances are represented as the open maws of two earthmonsters. Redrawn by Keith Prufer after Selden Roll A. 72."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"136Oaxaca1954). There is also a line of footprints that returns to heaven, which may be areference to Quetzalcoatl’s transformation into Venus upon his demise.On the Selden Roll, another group of four priests pays homage to Quetzal-coatl’s mortuary bundle at a palace or temple oracle decorated with theollin,ormotion sign, located just outside the cave. In a room located beyond the entranceto this building are seated two naked men, who appear to be giving some formof response. Flames project from their mouths. Their prominent fangs suggestthat they possess special powers. The priests are then shown carrying Quetzal-coatl’s bundle to a mountaintop, where they make an inaugural or foundationfire (see Figure 6.15). The ceremony seems to have been performed not only totake possession of the land, but also to extol the earth’s creation at the placewhere Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca tied the Earth Goddess (Rincón Mautner1995:61–62; 1997:136).The Colossal Bridge is incorporated into the story of the migration from Chi-comoztoc on the Codex Tlalpitepec. Two lines are drawn leaving Chicomoztoc,recognizable by seven dark circles around the larger open maw of an earth mon-ster, the convention used in depicting caves. The line on the left connects to aspring and a cave with a deer’s head, which would represent the passage throughthe Colossal Natural Bridge.The connection of these two caves seems significant. In all likelihood, theline represents the path taken by the priests who are shown on several Coixtla-huaca codices as deity bearers. This may have also been the path taken by Que-tzalcoatl through the underground passageway of the Colossal Natural Bridge(Rincón Mautner 1999:309, Figs. 66 and 76). The second line from Chico-moztoc follows a circuitous path along the right-hand side of the composition,perhaps depicting the wanderings of a migrating people. It leads up to a doublemountain place where the Lord 12 Flint and his spouse ruled.10These rulers hadfour children, each of whom married into the principal royal houses of Cholula,Culhuacan, and Mexico-Tenochtitlan.11The fourth child, Lord 7 Water, trav-eled south to the Mixteca and appears to have led his people into the Coixtla-huaca Basin through the cave-tunnel on the Ndaxagua (Rincón Mautner 1995;1997:136–137; 1999:Fig. 76; 2000:Table 3). On Codex Tequixtepec I, he is de-picted on the far right in the lower corner above a locative glyph depicting afanged, crenellated earth monster that represents the cave-tunnel (Figure 6.13).Later Colonial Period codices from Coixtlahuaca do not portray the Colos-sal Bridge with the earth monster/open maw convention. Since the indigenousreligion was being replaced by Christian beliefs and cave cults were being ac-tively discouraged, the glyph of the open maw, used in referring to caves, appearsto have been substituted for another place-sign in most of Coixtlahuaca’s othercodices. The substitute place-sign that possibly represents the cave-tunnel ofthe Ndaxagua on these other codices is also found on the Selden Roll, yet its full"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Figure 6.13.The cave-tunnel represented as the crenellated earth monster mountainseparates the rulers of the lineage into those who ruled outside the Coixtlahuaca Basinand those who became established at places within it.

A large sound scroll, in the form of a snake, emerges from themouth of this humanized pot (see Figure 6.15). The pot may represent a mortu-ary bundle. Human footprints lead from the mouth alongside the snake. A date1 Rabbit/7 Death is associated with this glyph for Pot Hill which also occurson Codex Tlalpitepec (Caso 1961:257) as the Hill of the Pot and Clawed Ser-pent. As in the Selden Roll, human footprints along the clawed snake’s back onCodex Tlalpitepec indicate the direction of movement. Interestingly, the repre-sentation of a mountain with a mortuary bundle, as well as footprints associatedwith a rattlesnake, are thematically similar to part of the Classic Period textthat was painted near the cave’s western opening (Rincón Mautner 1995:55;1999:Fig. 58).On Codex Coixtlahuaca I, the cave-tunnel is represented as a clay pot be-tween mountains through which a stream passes to an open maw below.12Thesnake emerging from a pot represented on Codex Tlalpitepec resembles the de-piction of the cave on the lower section of the narrow painting known as CodexTequixtepec II. On Codex Tulancingo I, the cave is represented as a pot behindthe founding ruler, Lord 6 Rain-Heart, with the date 1 Rabbit/7 Death (coinci-dent with the date associated with Pot Hill seen on other codices). On CodexBaranda, the cave-tunnel is represented as three egg-shaped hills behind a pot.Quetzalcoatl’s ScepterFew cult objects or materials that could be identified as ritual offerings havebeen recovered from the cave-tunnel on the Ndaxagua (Rosario) River. Numer-ous small corncobs, as well as abundant Classic and Postclassic Period ceramicpotsherds, lie scattered between the cobbles and boulders of the streambed thatconstitutes the cave floor. No remains of the cotton offerings, which the 1579Ixcatlan report states were customarily left in the cave during unspecified cere-monies, have been identified (Velázquez de Lara 1984:227–228). Likewise, noremains of hallucinogenic materials such as mushrooms or tobacco, which thisreport does not mention, have been discovered. In all likelihood, use of suchmaterials in rituals would have been common. From the description of the cavesetting and the paintings, it seems logical to infer that the cave was regarded as asacred place and that people visited it on special occasions. Furthermore, the cavehas been looted many times. In the early 1960s, a local schoolteacher who visitedthe cave found an engraved bone near the western entrance (Rincón Mautner1995). Remarkably, the bone’s engraving provides additional information aboutthe cave, how it was perceived, and the beliefs that may have been associated"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Sacred Caves and Rituals from the Northern Mixteca139with it (Figure 6.14). Furthermore, as an object, it seems directly related to theevents described in the codices that describe the arrival and establishment of theChocho in the Coixtlahuaca Basin.In an earlier study (Rincón Mautner 1995:59–60), I proposed that the bonecould have been an object similar to the scepter that Quetzalcoatl is shown hold-ing in the Selden Roll (see Figure 6.12). The scepter in the painting seems tohave been adorned by feathers; the bone has three holes to which feathers couldhave been fastened.13Furthermore, 9 Eagle, the last priest in the group thatis bringing Quetzalcoatl’s relic bundle through the cave-tunnel and out of theNdaxagua canyon (Figure 6.15), seems to be holding a similar object, though itlacks the decorative feathers. This priest also carries the shell trumpet and anincense burner. Power objects such as the bone and the mortuary bundle pro-vide a direct link with the deity. Perhaps as a way of legitimizing his authorityand right to govern, the ruler would require such objects. More important, if thebone was the handle to a fan, it may have been used in blood sacrifice to blowair on the wound made by the ruler in order to alleviate his pain. In doing so,he may have been summoning the Wind God to aid in his vision quest.Both the exquisite design and the account on the bone suggest that it musthave been a highly prized object. Three symbols for turquoise, cotton bolls, andthe numerous references to water underscore its precious nature. In the upperregister, Coixtlahuaca’s tutelary deities, Mixcoatl and Quetzalcoatl, are repre-sented. Both gods lack several of the accouterments that characterize them. Forexample, Quetzalcoatl lacks his buccal mask and cut conch necklace. The secondfigure is a warrior who wears the preeminent sign of rulership, thexiuhuitzolli(turquoise) crown; however, the cloud serpent behind him secures his identity asMixcoatl. Mixcoatl was one of the most important personages of ancient Mexicoand regarded as both a great warrior and a great hunter by the Chichimec andas Quetzalcoatl’s father.14The masked warrior figure, depicted as descending into the open maw ofthe earth monster and armed with darts, is also Camaxtle-Mixcoatl, the hunter(Rincón Mautner 1999:299, Fig. 69). He may be following his prey, a rabbit thatemerges from the opposite cave entrance, engraved as a second gaping maw onthe opposite side of the bone. The ‘‘descent’’ into the Underworld could perhapsrefer to a celestial event, in which case the figure would be the closely associatedwith Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, the Lord of the Dawn (Nicholson 1971:426).This interpretation of the scene on the bone is consistent with the cave-tunnel’s orientation, since the morning star, Venus, can be seen before sunrisefrom the cave’s lower entrance, which opens to the east. Outside the cave open-ing where the rabbit emerges are three kneeling male deities involved in a cere-mony. The most ornately dressed is the Sun God, a deity associated with jewelsand wealth.

This would appear, however, to be anothernaked male who is holding his hand close to his mouth. Masks on mortuarybundles and small stone sculptures are often depicted with a fang protrudingdown from the upper jaw on either side of the mouth, much like old people whoare depicted with a ‘‘toothy’’ grin from which only the two upper canine teethprotrude. The flying fanged figures on the bone might be associated with soulflight, as the figures seem to be dead (i.e., they have no pupils and their eyes areclosed). Smith (1973:65–71) and Furst (1978:20–21) refer to the ascending anddescending properties of fanged figures asxolotls.The sharp fangs seen in thesefigures, as well as on most earth deity representations, suggest that they are anattribute derived from the fangs of the rattlesnake, the animal that unequivo-cally embodies earth symbolism. It seems that the dead are transformed intofanged earth spirits upon entering the Underworld, as represented by a cave orafter interment in a grave or tomb. More recently, the Mixtec termñuhu,mean-ing ‘‘earth’’ (Smith 1973:66), has been interpreted as referring to ancestors andspirits (Byland and Pohl 1994:114).Inside the cave is the God of Death dancing over an unnamed personagewho is lying on a Tlaloc tree. This dancing god resembles the skeletonized figureon the cave wall (Figure 6.16). Since it is usually rulers or deities who are de-picted on ritual, ceremonial, or luxury items such as this bone, it seems probable"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Sacred Caves and Rituals from the Northern Mixteca143that the person on the tree might be a future ruler seeking a vision, or perhaps adead or dying ruler. TheHistoria Tolteca-Chichimeca(Kirchhoff et al. 1989:171,Facs., p. 35) mentions that it was customary for a future ruler to lie down in thebranches of a tree for four days and nights without food or drink. Only after hehad endured this suffering was he fit to be initiated as ruler. His nasal septumwould then be perforated in a ceremony that marked his anointing as king.In the alternate interpretation, that of a dying or dead ruler, the scene de-picted on the bone closely resembles the Classic Period depiction of Pacal onthe sarcophagus lid in the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque. Furthermore,because the bone seems to represent the cave entrances at the Colossal Natu-ral Bridge, which are located at each end of an east to west–oriented tunnel, itis possible to infer that the ruler’s head on the bone is pointing north while hefaces the cave’s eastern opening. Pacal was interred with his head to the north(Carlson 1976; 1981:196). These two interpretations are not inconsistent withone another, as the ruler must conquer his fear and come to terms with his ownmortality. Being close to death from food and drink deprivation, he could haveendured by entering a state of trance. His near-death experience would preparehim to face the hardships of his role. The cycle would be completed once hesuccumbed to his own death.ConclusionsThis chapter on ancient ritual cave use in the Mixteca Alta gives only a briefglimpse of a rich cultural tradition of considerable time and depth. Reciprocitybetween the gods and the people makes life possible and allows humans to at-tain their aspirations. The idea of reciprocity was, and still is, at the heart of cavecults. Caves provide a point of reference for the beginning of time and the sub-sequent order, legitimacy of rulers, and assistance in times of need. Placing thefew instances of Early Colonial Period recorded cave use in a broader historicalcontext reveals that people in several Mixteca communities were suffering somesort of stress. Their rulers and priests were seeking to alleviate the strangleholdof drought, famine, and disease by turning to their religion when Dominicanpriests caught and made examples of them.Artifacts recovered from caves in this region are not well documented. Mostoften they are the result of accidental finds rather than of systematic explo-ration, mapping, and excavation. Yet the depictions of caves and rituals in Pre-and Post-Hispanic codices underscore their importance in the indigenous wayof life.The difficulties encountered in interpreting the figures, symbols, and, espe-cially, the day-bearer signs painted inside the Colossal Natural Bridge are a re-"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"144Oaxacaflection of the small size of the Ñuiñe corpus, the lack of a comparable cavewith which to develop a more appropriate contextual framework, and an ap-parent variability in the conventions used in representing day bearers. Furthercomplicating interpretation is the fact that several groups of paintings are fromdifferent time periods.The codices refer to the cave-tunnel by linking it to the stories of Quetzal-coatl’s descent from heaven, his passage through the Underworld, and the estab-lishment of the royal lineage in the Coixtlahuaca Basin during the Epi-Classic/Early Postclassic Periods. Quetzalcoatl’s and Mixcoatl’s mortuary bundles aretaken by the priest bearers from the temple outside the cave and enthroned onthe summit of the Mountain of Intertwined Snakes, where an inaugural fire ismade that commemorates the Earth’s creation.My findings about the cave-tunnel in the northern Mixteca, remarkably, sup-port the unity of Mesoamerican concepts regarding the order of the cosmos:from creation to the origins of the people; fertility; sacrifice, death, and ances-tor worship; kinship ties, rulership, shamanic transformation, and vision quests;and even spatial orientation. Overall, the ideas appear to be patterned so thatthey crosscut time, geography, and linguistic and cultural boundaries. In the in-digenous view of history as a structured, cyclic phenomenon, the ideas of pre-vious inhabitants, or the ‘‘ancestors,’’ are incorporated and reworked, and dailylife and history become the repetition of myth.Cave cults have proved to be particularly difficult to eradicate throughoutthe Mixteca and Coixtlahuaca Basin. Despite Christianity’s relative success, thebeliefs associated with caves remain deeply entrenched in the Mesoamericancultureofthisarea.Notes1. Within the broad Nahuatl-speaking area, the beings that own and inhabit cavesare referred to astlaloques(servants of the rain god, Tlaloc), astepeyolotli(hearts of themountain), or even as thundering deities, the original owners of maize and other foodsnecessary for humankind’s sustenance (Broda 1991:470–471).2. There seems to have been a generalized belief that ‘‘bridges,’’ or subterranean pas-sageways through mountains, and even underground houses, were made by Quetzalcoatl(Sahagún 1989:1:217–218).3. The ruler portrayed seated inside a cave is a very ancient Mesoamerican idea. For-mative Period renditions include Monument 1 at Chalcatzingo, Morelos, and Mural 1 atOxtotitlan, Guerrero.4. The custom of using garments made from jaguar pelts was widespread amongmembers of the Classic and Postclassic Period nobility. Other Classic Period represen-tations can be found on polychrome Maya cylinder vases. Likewise, the personages onthe doorway and wall of the A Portico and one of the warrior factions portrayed on thebattle scene mural at Cacaxtla wear jaguar pelt uniforms."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Sacred Caves and Rituals from the Northern Mixteca1455. Urcid (1996:52, Fig. 5) has reinterpreted this glyph as an unfolded version ofglyph U. I had originally interpreted it as a snake (Rincón Mautner 1995:47, Fig. 10a).The central elements resemble the downward-curving buccal mask of the ‘‘jaws of thesky’’ motif (Urcid 1996:Fig. 4); however, its other qualifying elements, such as the croco-dilian eye, the double bifid tongues, cranial crests, and tassel, which I referred to in myearlier interpretation, would be missing in the ‘‘jaws of the sky’’ symbol. The ‘‘jaws of thesky’’ occurs frequently in several contexts. A comparison of the profile view of glyph U,mentioned in the above description of the panel, and other examples suggests that the‘‘snake’’ and glyph U are probably different glyphs, or perhaps the same glyph used indifferent contexts. One has definite reptilian attributes; the other is avian (i.e., the broad-beaked bird). Urcid (1992:1:173) has suggested that the presence of human attributeswas a way of asserting that glyph U does not represent naturally occurring entities. Yet,no human attributes can be recognized in either of these glyphs. Further complicatingthe interpretation is the fact that glyph U in profile from the Colossal Natural Bridgeappears to be a qualifier for glyph X, and Urcid (1992:1:177) mentions that glyph X, asa noncalendrical sign, also occurs with coefficients.6. My interpretation of the ‘‘eye with tears’’ symbol as a starlike celestial body likeVenus is based on the context in the cave: the symbol is next to a skeletonized figure.Eyes, which may be considered modified versions of this symbol, are portrayed alongthe bottom of bands representing the sky in Postclassic or Colonial Period pictographicmanuscripts like the Selden Roll. On this document there is also a representation of apath of flints and stars taken by one of the deity bearers, which may represent either anight journey or shamanic flight.7. In this chapter, I am revising my earlier interpretation of this figure with out-stretched arms as a representation of the rain and lightning god, Cocijo (Rincón Mautner1999:265–268, Fig. 59). As Xicani,yahui,or shaman, the figure is involved in the ritualsacrifice of a deer, which, as is explained in the text, is related to drought and to rainpropitiation. During the Colonial Period, blood sacrifice of goats and sheep in caves nearCoixtlahuaca seems to have replaced the sacrifice of humans and deer.8. Burland (1955:14) refers to the lack of footprints between the two cave entrancesas a hiatus in the account on the Selden Roll that divides the heavenly preamble fromthe earthly story (see Figure 6.12).9. I identify the maw of the earth monster decorated with seven hearts on the SeldenRoll as the western entrance to the cave-tunnel. Burland (1955:14–16) refers to this rep-resentation as the ‘‘Hill of Flowers,’’ ‘‘Cave in Flower Hill,’’ and ‘‘Cave in the Hill ofFlowers’’ (see Figure 6.12).10. This Lord 12 Flint and his spouse, who had the same name, were the third rulersof the dynasty. They ruled at a place that is represented on Codex Tlalpitepec as a moun-tain with a blooming agave plant. On Codex Tequixtepec I, the same rulers are shownat a place characterized by two snow-capped mountains. A tree emerges from the saddlebetween the peaks. The saddle incorporates the representation of either a river or a basinfilled with round elements that resemble tamales or the hominy used in pozole. Thesame place is referred to in Codex Coixtlahuaca I as a river filled with similar objectsand festooned with green feather headdresses at the foot of twin peaks. These place-signs may all refer to Tamoanchan or Tollan. Furthermore, the snowcaps may refer toeither Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl, or to Poyauhtecatl (Pico de Orizaba) and the SierraNegra, which sometimes is covered by snow.11. The reference to the children of the 12 Flints indicates that Coixtlahuaca’s ruling"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"146Oaxacafamily was kin and equal in stature to the highest-ranking noble houses of PostclassicCentral Mexico.12. The representation of the open maw on the Codex Coixtlahuaca refers to a dif-ferent limestone bridge, orpont d’arc,which is located on the Xiuquila River, not farfrom the cave-tunnel. The top of this second natural bridge has been transformed intoan irrigated grove of fruit trees and coffee known as the Huerta de Juquila (i.e., Xiu-quila). The grove lies about four kilometers downstream (north) from the confluence ofthe Ndaxagua and the Xiuquila Rivers (Rincón Mautner 1999n70, Fig. 74).13. A bone scepter or fan handle from the Tenango Cave also has perforations towhich feathers could have been attached (Winter 1989:76).14. Mixcoatl is a deity often associated with both Camaxtle and Tlahuizcalpantecuh-tli (Nicholson 1971:426–427), with a celestial or star-associated role, as the transformedsoul of the sacrificed warrior (Seler 1904a:264–265). After re-creating the earth, Tezca-tlipoca changed his name to Mixcoatl and honored the gods by lighting fires with firedrills.

Whether we look at the karstic limestone lowlands, thepiedmont regions to the south, or the volcanic terrain of the highlands, cavesand hills have long provided essential models for an interrelated set of crucialconcepts in cosmology and ritual (Awe 1999; Bassie-Sweet 1991, 1996; Brady1991, 1997; Brady and Veni 1992; Brady et al. 1996; Burnett et al. 2002; Frei-del et al. 1993; Gossen 1999a; MacLeod and Puleston 1979; Schele and Freidel1990; Stone 1995; Thompson 1959; Vogt 1969, 1993, 1981).In this chapter we attempt to discern widely distributed and conservative pat-terns in the ways caves and hills have been understood and used by the Maya.We focus on ethnographic data and also the results of recent advancements indeciphering textual sources from the Classic Period. The two vantage points,one Pre-Columbian and the other modern, show a remarkable degree of over-lap, and we believe it is from these convergences that we can discern the long-lasting and most-essential Maya beliefs surrounding the surface and interior ofthe landscape.Our detailed ethnographic treatment will focus on the relatively well studiedregion of Highland Chiapas, although many of the shared patterns we see amongthose communities are certainly more widespread. We conclude with an ex-amination of how caves are ambivalent, boundary-line settings (between thisworld and the supernatural world) that, as posited by Edmund Leach and VictorTurner, actively generate ritual."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"156The Maya RegionFigure 7.1.The animated mountain, orwitz,from an Early Classic Maya vessel. Drawn byDavid Stuart.Mountains and Caves in Ancient Maya ReligionA number of years ago Vogt (1964) made the observation that Maya temple-pyramids of the Classic Period replicate sacred mountains and their summitshrines, examples of which can today be found throughout much of Chiapasand Guatemala. This idea has been borne out by several lines of evidence,not the least of which is the extensive comparative body of evidence concern-ing mountain-pyramids both within and outside of Mesoamerica (Scully 1991;Townsend 1982). More specific support comes from the textual and icono-graphic evidence of Classic sources, which explicitly name or label ritual archi-tecture aswitzob,or mountains (Stuart 1997). Indeed, the animate mountainimage (Figure 7.1) is one of the most common elements of ancient Maya ico-nography and is used to specify the names of ritual locations and shrines. Wewill discuss below certain evidence that suggests an explicit conceptualizationof temple-shrines as the cave interiors of mountain-pyramids.For the present-day Maya, the essential connections of people and commu-nities to the earth generally are expressed in the cosmological architecture ofcaves and mountains. For the ancient Maya, one could argue that much thesame was true, since ceremonial centers were literally constructed as arrays ofmountain-pyramids and cave-temples. And, as is true today among numeroustraditional communities (to be discussed below), iconographic and epigraphic"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Ritual Caves among the Ancient and Modern Maya157evidence strongly suggests that mountains and their architectural counterpartswere conceived in ancient times as residences of ancestors and possibly co-essences (animal-spirit companions) of humans. Perhaps the most explicit rep-resentation of this concept appears on a selection of sculptures from El Peru,Guatemala, depicting largewitz(‘‘hill’’) masks beneath the feet of standingrulers (Figure 7.2). Within the two eyes of the masks, as if they were windowsfor seeing into the earth, we find portraits of ancestors, in one case, a male anda female figure meant to represent the mother and father of the king. The fu-nerary pyramids of Classic architecture, holding the actual remains of ancestorswithin tombs, sometimes referred to as ‘‘houses’’ (atotob) in the afterlife, can alsobe seen as reflecting the same spatial relationship (Figure 7.3).Excavations and archaeological surveys conducted since the 1960s clearly at-test to the importance of caves in the ritual geography of the ancient Maya, butuntil now there has been no evidence of caves being mentioned in the inscrip-tions of that period. The recent suggestion by Stuart that a common elementof the script readsCH’ENorCH’EEN,‘‘cave,’’ would, if correct, change thissituation drastically.1The ‘‘Cave’’ HieroglyphThe sign in question (Figure 7.4) is the so-called impinged bone element, whichhas been the topic of considerable discussion among epigraphers. It is one of themost frequent glyphs known in the Classic inscriptions and in the codices. If infact its reading isCH’EEN, there is every indication that caves were a centraltopic of discussion in Maya inscriptions.The details of the evidence in support of this new reading are presented else-where (Stuart 1999), but a few basic points can be made here. The representationof the sign is difficult to discern, but early variants clearly show a bone motifwith side indentations within the standard rounded form of a main sign. In laterexamples a half-darkened field was added, and the bone was sometimes changedinto a mandible or, more commonly, a detached eye. Also, there are similaritiesbetween these variants and the sign readMUKorMUKNAL, ‘‘burial,’’ whichalso shows a half-darkened field but with a skull within (see Stuart 1998). Thesign in question therefore has strong visual affinities with themes of death andthe Underworld.The associations can be expanded once we see that the glyph correspondsto a recurrent motif in Maya iconography: eyes and bones against a darkenedbackground. In iconographic settings this seems to specify some blackened spacewith Underworld associations, as shown, for example, on the Vase of the SevenGods (Figure 7.5). The thematic connection to death and the Underworld is"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Figure 7.2.El Peru,Stela 31, basal register.Photograph by IanGraham; courtesyCorpus of MayaHieroglyphicInscriptions.Figure 7.3.A royal tombnamed as a ‘‘house’’(atot) of the deceased.Painted wall from Tomb6, Río Azul, Guatemala.Drawn by David Stuart."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Ritual Caves among the Ancient and Modern Maya159Figure 7.4.The putativeCH’EEN,‘‘cave,’’hieroglyph in its Earlyand Late Classic forms.Drawn by David Stuart.Figure 7.5.The Vase of the Seven Gods.

Drawn by DianeGriffiths Peck, after Coe (1974).echoed by the appearance of the same motif on bats’ wings, as represented onNebaj-style polychrome vases and other decorated ceramics of the Classic Period(Figure 7.6).For many years before theCH’EENreading suggested itself, there existedstrong indications that the ‘‘impinged bone’’ hieroglyph served in some way as alocation sign, because of its very close association with place names (Stuart andHouston 1994:12–13). For example, the sign may follow the verbal signOCH,meaning ‘‘to enter,’’ where it must somehow specify a place that is enclosed orthat is hollow. A parallel verb phrase in the inscriptions isOCH-WITZ, mean-ing ‘‘enters the mountain’’ (Figure 7.7), referring, perhaps, to the descent into acave for some sort of ancestral ritual. The sign also often takes the locative prefixsigntu-, fort-u-‘‘inhis/herits...,’’sometimesinassociation with different"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"160The Maya Regionverbs. On an inscription on Panel 1 from El Cayo, for example, we find the verbphrasemuhk-aj t-u-?,meaning ‘‘he was interred in his ‘x’,’’ possibly in referenceto the burial of an individual within a cave. In other instances, we find the pre-fixTAHN-na,fortahn-,‘‘within . . . ,’’ before this possibleCH’EENsign, asin a recently discovered text from Temple XIX at Palenque (Figure 7.8). In thisusage, the bone sign seems to alternate withHA’, ‘‘water,’’ in parallel texts.If we consider the evidence in sum, we have the following assumptions withwhich to work: (a) the sign is a logogram, or word sign, that refers to a kind oflocation or space into which one can ‘‘enter,’’ ‘‘sit,’’ or ‘‘be buried’’; (b) visually,the sign has strong death associations, with a special connection to Underworldand bat symbolism; and (c) the sign’s phonetic value ends in the consonant -n.Taken together, an attractive hypothesis in agreement with all three points isthat we have a sign with the valueCH’EEN, ‘‘cave.’’ Admittedly, other readingsmight exist, but the convergence of the evidence around ‘‘cave’’ makes consider-able sense in the numerous contexts in which we find the sign.One important example is from a painted text from the walls of the ritualcave of Jolja, Chiapas, which we will feature in our ethnographic treatment ofthe Chol Maya (see also Alejos García 1994:95; Reise 1981; Stone 1995:87–90;Thompson 1975:xxxvi). The text opens with the revealing phrase (applying thenew reading)hul-iiy t-u-ch’een,‘‘he arrived in his cave’’ (Figure 7.9). The walls ofthe cave exhibit many other Pre-Columbian paintings, including several hiero-glyphic texts, indicating that it was a pilgrimage or ritual center in ancient timesand continues to be in modern times (Bassie et al. 2002:5–10). This particu-lar inscription would seem to record the ‘‘arrival’’ at Jolja Cave of a Maya lordduring the Early Classic Period. It provides an interesting parallel case to moreextensive and later texts from Naj Tunich, Guatemala, which record ‘‘arrivals’’of various visitors over a several-year period (Stone 1995).An important and recurring ritual term in the inscriptions ischan ch’een,‘‘sky-cave.’’ This consistently appears in connection with local toponyms, seeminglyto describe some quality or category of place. A typical example is in the archi-tectural dedicatory expression found at Palenque:pat-l-aj Lakamha’ chan ch’een,‘‘it is built at Lakamha‘, the ‘sky-cave.’ ’’ The combination of the terms is curi-ous, and we know of no direct parallel in historical Mayan languages. Nonethe-less, it is interesting to entertain the possibility that ‘‘sky-cave’’ presents a spatialopposition that indicates some universal totality, rather like the K’iche’ term‘‘mountains-grass.’’Chan ch’eenthus may be a Classic Period term correspondingto the idea of ‘‘world.’’An alternative interpretation is perhaps more interesting and far-reaching inits implications. We have noted that ‘‘sky-cave’’ is intimately associated withlocal place names, likeLakamha’for ancient Palenque. In a great many cases,place names associated with the ‘‘sky-cave’’ references are simply emblem glyph"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Figure 7.6.‘‘Cave bat’’ from Nebaj-stylepolychrome (K4018).

The ‘‘caves’’ mentioned in such references, rather than describ-ing buildings, might be far larger in conceptualization, corresponding to thenames for the kingdoms themselves. That is, we see some evidence to suggestthat a good many place names in the Classic inscriptions, including emblemglyphs or polity names, are specified ascave namesin origin.The well-known emblem glyph of Tikal, for example, was probably readMUTorMUTULin ancient times and appears with the signCH’EENina variety of inscriptions (Figure 7.10). One setting is in the simple statementtan-ch’een Mutul,‘‘inside the cave of Mutul.’’ In another context, the glyphicplace name Yax Mutul is graphically fused with the owl-like head variant of theCH’EENsign to indicate the cave location of a bound captive who, presumably,is about to be sacrificed.

An important text discovered in 1998 in TempleXIX at Palenque (see Figure 7.8) closes with the dedicatory phraseut-iy tanch’een Lakamha’,‘‘it happened before thech’eenat Lakamha’,’’ referring, it wouldseem, to a culminating ritual which took place at or within the building. Inter-estingly, Temple XIX is located directly in front of the mountain spring fromwhich emanates the Otulum stream, passing through the heart of Palenque’sceremonial center. Lakamha’, ‘‘Large Waters,’’ was the name of Palenque in an-cient times and probably more specifically applied to the present-day Otulum.The construction of the site of Palenque around this stream and its point ofemergence from the mountain very likely says something about the spring’s cere-monial and conceptual importance.A similar architectural pattern can be seen at Dos Pilas, Guatemala, wherethe major acropoli of Dos Pilas’s center and the neighboring complex of ElDuende were oriented northward to align directly with conspicuous, upwellingsprings (Stephen Houston, personal communication, 1990; Brady 1997). It canbe no coincidence that the toponyms associated with these acropoli are based onthe wordha’,just as we find at Palenque (Stuart and Houston 1994). Moreover,the references to these places in the Classic inscriptions routinely refer to themasch’een,in this instance, probably meaning ‘‘spring,’’ although large caves arealso associated with these groups (Brady 1997).The associations of caves with the ancient ceremonies of rainmaking are wellestablished, at least in some areas of the Maya Lowlands (Andrews 1970). Onevery important example is La Pailita Cave, located in the central Petén of Guate-mala and reported by Graham (1997). Inside the low overhanging shelter was a‘‘life-size’’ masonry effigy of the rain god Chaak, seated on a throne and coveredwith modeled stucco. The figure held an axe against his chest and was wearing abreechclout, a pectoral ornament, and elaborate earspools. Its style and the vastnumbers of sherds found nearby suggest a Late Preclassic or Early Classic datefor the sculpture and many of its associated ritual activities.In the Classic Maya evidence, we therefore see that toponyms correspondingto individual communities or, sometimes, to larger polities were identified, inlarge part, with caves or, by extension, springs. We believe that this pattern inthe Classic sources is a direct reflection of the ancient Maya (and Mesoameri-can) belief pattern in which caves are seen as places of political and commu-nal foundation. In the following section we describe specific manifestations ofthese beliefs as they are found among traditional Maya communities of High-land Chiapas."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"164The Maya RegionEthnographic PatternsTzotzil MayaThe rugged limestone and volcanic mountain terrain reaching into the clouds ofHighland Chiapas is the visible surface of the Tzotzil world, a large quincunx inquadrilateral form called Balamil. The center of this visible world is a ‘‘navel,’’located in the ceremonial centers of each of the contemporarymunicipios.Theworld rests on the shoulders of the Vashak-men, the local version of the ‘‘four-corner gods’’ or ‘‘sky bearers.’’ Vinahel, ‘‘the sky’’ above the earth, is the domainof the sun, the moon, and the stars. ‘Olon Balamil, the Lower- or Underworld,is also a quincunx. The visible sacred world is characterized by strong emphasison two basic features of the natural topography:witzandch’een.Almost all the mountains and hills near Tzotzil settlements are the homesof Totil-me’iletik (literally, ‘‘Fathers-Mothers’’), or ancestral gods. They are theremote ancestors of the living and are the most important deities, judging by thefrequency with which people think about them, pray to them, and perform ritu-als dedicated to them. They are pictured as elderly Tzotzil Maya living eternallyin their mountain homes.Next to the ancestral gods, the most important deity is Yahval Balamil, the‘‘Earth Owner,’’ who lives inside the earth. Obviously descended, with sometransformations, from a Pre-Columbian Underworld god, Yahval Balamil is nowpictured in many Tzotzil communities as a large, fat Ladino living undergroundwith piles of money, herds of cows, mules, horses, and flocks of chickens (Vogt1969, 1981, 1993). He also owns all the water holes and controls the lightning andthe clouds—believed to emerge from caves—as well as all the products of theearth that people use—trees cut to build houses, mud used for walls, limestoneforlime,andsoon.In Zinacanteco belief, the Earth Owner rides on a deer and uses iguanas asblinders for his mount and a snake for a whip. The shell of a land snail is hispowder horn for making skyrockets and shooting his shotgun, both of which arethe bolts of lightning. It follows that one cannot use land, or any of its products,without compensating the Earth Owner with appropriate ceremonial offerings.Vogt has had a number of interesting conversations in which he has at-tempted to convince Zinacantecos that clouds form in the air, rather than incaves. One of these conversations took place in a hamlet on the rim of theChiapas highlands while watching storm clouds in the Grijalva River Lowlandsseveral thousand feet below. Vogt finally had to concede that, given the em-pirical evidence available to Zinacantecos living in their highland terrain, theirexplanation does make sense. For, as the clouds formed rapidly in the air andthen streamed up and over the highland ridges in much the same way that fog"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Ritual Caves among the Ancient and Modern Maya165comes in from the Pacific and pours over the coastal range in northern Cali-fornia, they did give the impression of coming up from caves on the slopes ofthe Chiapas highlands. Given the Zinacanteco’s premises and the evidence ob-servable from the day-to-day behavior of clouds, their belief is understandable(Vogt 1969:387).The Zinacanteco caves are visited and ceremonies performed there annually.To illustrate: ‘Avan Ch’en (He Shouted Cave, named for an episode in a myththat relates how the Earth Owner came to the door of the cave and shouted) isone of the important caves visited by the procession of shamans from the water-hole group called Bik’it Vo’ (Small Water, from the water hole’s diminutive size)in the hamlet of Paste’. Here, during the K’in Krus (Day of the Cross) ceremonyin early May at the end of the dry season, the shamans offer candles, copal in-cense, and lengthy prayers that urgently petition the Earth Owner to send thesummer rains (Vogt 1969).Every Zinacantecoch’eenprovides a means of communication with the EarthOwner, but this communication is regarded with the deepest ambivalence. Onthe one hand, there are glorious myths about how men have acquired greatwealth in money and livestock by entering caves to visit him. Perhaps the mostfamiliar tale relates how a man emerged from ‘Avan Ch’en with a silver cruci-fix and sacks full of coins loaded on a mule. He met a local Ladino, who wasastonished by the Zinacanteco’s riches and challenged him to compare wealth.As they unloaded and counted their respective piles of coins, the Maya’s pilegrew larger and larger and outstripped that of the Ladino. The magical crucifixhe had acquired from the Earth Owner made money (a scarce commodity) forthe Maya!On the other hand, Yahval Balamil needs many workers, and there is alwaysthe danger that a man may be captured and forced to work inside the earth untilthe iron sandals provided by the Earth Owner wear out. Furthermore, evil Zina-cantecos practicing witchcraft may enter caves and sell the souls of their victimsto Yahval Balamil. Indeed, a really dangerous witch can sell the souls ofentirehamlets to the Earth Owner.This ambivalence—a combination of hopeful enticement and sheer terror—that Zinacantecos have toward caves and Yahval Balamil is well illustrated by anexcerpt from Vogt’s field journal on the all-night lineage and water-hole cere-monies performed in the hamlet of Paste’. These include prayers and offeringsto the four-corner gods, to the ancestors, and to the Earth Owner. Vogt has par-ticipated in a number of these all-night affairs. Here is a quote from his journalof May 6, 1960 (Vogt 1969:694–695):At 4:30a.m., the procession of shamans climbed down the steep trail toBan-kilal Sch’ut Ch’en(literally ‘‘older brother his stomach cave’’) which is a deep"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"166The Maya Regionlimestone sink. Here the ritual had some very special aspects. The shamanswere much quieter, and there was an aura of fear hovering over the procession.With piles of copal incense burning in the censers, the candle offerings weretied together and stuck up into a natural hole in a limestone rock which is saidto be the huge stomach ofYahval Balamil,himself ! The chanting of the prayersseemed endless, especially on the part of...theshaman who specializes incuring people who have had their souls ‘‘sold’’ to the earth-owner.The most common form of witchcraft in Zinacantan is‘ak’chamel,literally,‘‘giving illness.’’ Shamans calledh’ak’chamel h’ilolare specialists in giving illnessand also in counterwitchcraft, that is, throwing the illness back at one’s enemy.These witchcraft rituals are performed in front of crosses in caves near the ham-lets in which the participants live. The ritual may consist of using small candlesof seven colors, which the shamans cut in half and light upside down; alterna-tively, they cut the small candles into thirteen pieces and burn them as they saytheir evil prayers (Vogt 1969:406–410).In the Tzotzil Mayamunicipioof Chamula, the earth is believed to be lacedwith caves and tunnels which eventually reach its edges. Earth Owners live inthe mountain caves and provide all forms of precipitation, including the asso-ciated clouds, lightning, and thunder. Snakes are the familiars and the alternateforms of Earth Owners. Only Earth Owners, snakes, and demons inhabit theinternal cave networks of the earth (Figure 7.11) (Gossen 1974:21).In the Chamula worldview, caves are also symbolically linked to the sweatbaths that every household builds and customarily utilizes daily for family baths.The sweat bath–as-cave is a strong association in Chamula, and there is a rockshelter in the hamlet of Laguna Petej called Pus Ch’en (Sweat-Bath Cave),which is said to represent an Underworld sweat bath where the sins of the deadare baked away before judgment (Groark 1997:26).Moss Mountain (Tzontevitz), the highest in the central Chiapas highlandsand the most sacred of all mountains to the people of Chamula, lies to the eastof the ceremonial center and within Barrio San Juan, the highest-ranking of thethree barrios (Gossen 1974:20). The co-essences, or animal-spirit companions,of the Chamula have two aspects, a senior and a junior. The senior aspect livesin a corral on the third level of the sky, where it is tended by the senior aspectof Saint Jerome (a saint often shown in Spanish images with a lion lying at hisfeet), known in Tzotzil as Totik Bolom (Our Father Jaguar). The junior aspectof the animal spirit lives in a corral in Moss Mountain, where it is tended by thejunior aspect of Saint Jerome (Gossen 1975:450–451).In Chamula the shrine on the summit of Moss Mountain consists of a caveon the western side of the mountaintop. The crosses are placed inside the cavein such a manner that Chamula praying to the crosses face east toward therising sun.

This mountain, and the shrine at San Juan’s Window, there-fore, mark the sacred abode of the community’s principal ancestor and also thedwellingplaceofanimalalteregosofalloftheliving...[SanJuan]is,quiteliterally, the ‘oldest’ Chamula ancestor whose soul is greeted on the Days of theDead.’’According to Linn (personal communication, August 8, 1998), Chamula cur-"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"168The Maya Regioning parties visit the shrine on top of Moss Mountain and leave offerings whenan illness is especially serious—for example, if the animal soul is in grave dangeror if the patient is under the spell of a strong witch. Cargo holders also visit theshrine on Saint Jerome’s (Father Jaguar’s) Day, decorate the crosses, and leaveofferings. Gossen (personal communication, August 7, 1998) adds that follow-ing the 1994 Zapatista takeover of San Cristóbal, the Chamula cargo holders,accompanied by the shamans, made a pilgrimage to the Moss Mountain shrineto enlist the aid of the mountain gods in keeping the Zapatistas out of Chamula.The similarities in cosmological symbolism between the Chamula San Juan’sWindow on top of the most important sacred mountain and the temple-shrinesof Classic Maya pyramids—possibly thechan ch’een,sky-cave, mentioned inClassic Maya glyphs—is striking. We suggest that there is an unmistakable con-tinuity here from the temple-shrines atop Classic Maya pyramids to the conceptunderlying San Juan’s Window in contemporary Chamula. We also suggest thatthe symbolic linkage of sweat baths to caves in Chamula may be another con-tinuity from the symbolic sweat baths that Houston (1996) proposes were thefunction of the sanctuaries inside the temples of the Cross Group at Palenque inthe Classic Period. Significantly, these sanctuaries are replete with ‘‘cave’’ hiero-glyphs, and the iconography displayed within the Temple of the Foliated Cross,in particular, marks its space as an artificial cave.According to Holland (1962), mountains have a crucial role to play in SanAndrés Larrainzar, another Tzotzil community:These sacred mountains are referred to asch’iebalin Larrainzar, and asch’ibalin other Tzotzil dialects2...Conceptually then, the sacred mountains maysuggest the family tree and mythological places of origin of their respectivepatrilineages. The companion animals of the same patrilineage all occupy thesame sacred mountain...Thesacredmountains, like the heavens of the Maya,have 13 horizontal levels. For the Tzotzil, the sacred mountains symbolize thesky, and to ascend one is tantamount to rising into the heavens. Each levelis presided over by distinct ancestor gods. The strata of the sky are presumedconnected by the sacred cottonwood tree; while those of the sacred mountainsare imagined as linked from bottom to top by a huge stairway, in many wayssuggesting the ancient Maya pyramids. Each level has a certain number ofcompanion animals which correspond to specific individuals in the patrilineage.Each companion animal has a specially designated stool; pine needles withflowers are scattered about the floor, and each seat is surrounded on three sidesby pine branches . . . The social relations of the spirit world are rigidly struc-tured along generational lines just as they are in Tzotzil society. The companionanimals of the elders and curers are lineage gods which occupy the highest levelof the sacred mountain...theyprotect and defend their inferiors by providing"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Ritual Caves among the Ancient and Modern Maya169for their physical needs and curing their illnesses, and in this capacity they actas intermediaries between men and the gods.The elders are responsible for punishing transgressors with witchcraft. Inthis capacity, they transform themselves into malevolent entities, such as owls,hummingbirds, eagles, king vultures, butterflies, rainbows, whirlwinds, and ballsof fire, and appear to their enemies as omens of death. The companion ani-mals, ornaguales,of the most powerfulprincipales(elites) of Larrainzar occupythe most important seats in the thirteenth level of the sacred mountain. Thecompanion animal of theprincipalofprincipales,a giant jaguar, has the mostimposing position, from which he consults directly with the ancestor gods inmatters concerning the rule of his inferiors. Holland (1962:6–8) adds: ‘‘Adams’(1961) archaeological survey shows that the Classic Maya migrants into high-land Chiapas settled on steep ridgelines, bluffs, hilltops, and sharp pinnacles,probably for defensive reasons. In late Post-Classic times there was a shift fromthese headland settlements to more concentrated settlements around the largervalleys, probably accompanied by the dispersed hamlet pattern. As this hap-pened, the original headland settlements may have evolved into the sacredmountains and places where ancestor worship developed.’’Tugrul Uke (1970) has published an interesting account of a counterwitch-craft ceremony he witnessed in a cave near San Andrés Larrainzar center. Usingaguardiente,copal incense, and white candles and praying before a large crossinside the cave, the San Andrés Larrainzar shaman and his wife reportedly suc-ceeded in ‘‘cutting the hour’’ of (i.e., ritually killing) three enemies who wereattempting to kill him. The photos of the shaman and his wife performing theceremony are especially vivid.Guiteras-Holmes (1994:60–62) reports that in the Tzotzilmunicipioof Che-nalho the rain clouds come from caves in the mountains that are doors to theabode of the Rain God, who is called Anhel.3A small frog, called X’antun,is the custodian of access to the caves. On certain days the doors to the cavesare open, which means, on the one hand, that the caves are dangerous, becausepeople are exposed to direct contact with the beings who have the power to pun-ish them. On the other hand, it is on these days that prayers may be receivedby the rain gods. At the three agricultural ceremonies performed each year, thepeople gather on the hillsides to fire off skyrockets to urge X’antun to open thedoors of the house of Anhel so that he can be prayed to directly and people canask for life and sustenance from the Holy Earth. Guiteras-Holmes (1994:60)adds, ‘‘Anhel is the rain god, the lord of the mountains, the corn-giver, the mas-ter of beasts, and the god of the waters. He watches over the cornfields plantedaround the foot of the mountains and on the summits and procures the neces-sary rain for them.’’ Anhel is owner of the thunderbolt produced by pounding"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"170The Maya Regionon his drum. He appears in dreams as a saint image or a man. Some nights heis perceived as a head rimmed by fire and with a long tail.

He inhabits a single mountain and all of them (Guiteras-Holmes1961:290; 1994:60–61).The maiden mother of maize, X’ob, is the beautiful daughter of Lord of theMountains and the Rain, the daughter of Anhel. She gives people the ability toeat maize, thech’ulel,or inner soul, of their sustenance. She is both one and in-finite. There is ax’obfor every cornfield, for each ear of corn (Guiteras-Holmes1994:62).Totilme’il is the father-mother of life, an ancestor. In his animal epiphany,the hummingbird, he is guardian and preserver of people (Guiteras-Holmes1961:292). When the world was inhabited by gods, thetotil-me’illived on theearth (Guiteras-Holmes 1994:63).Kohler (1995:18–19) describes the mountain gods of another Tzotzil com-munity, Chalchihuitan, as beingyahwal witz,or ‘‘owners of the mountains’’;they are also calledanhel.They live in the interior of the approximately one hun-dred sacred mountains in the Chalchihuitan region.Anhelalso means ‘‘light-ning,’’ which serves as the guns of the mountain gods. The mountain gods areowners of important animals hunted for meat; they are the providers of rain;and they are guardians of the vital essence of maize, theshch’ulel ‘ishim.Thesegods resemble Ladino ranchers engaged in keeping livestock, but their corrals donot contain cattle; rather, they contain white-tailed and red (brocket) deer. Thewhite-tailed deer serve as their mounts. Snakes and toads guard their residences.From the mountains the gods send clouds and rain.In a myth, one of the mountain gods has three daughters: Me’ Bot, or Motherof Hail; Me’ Taiv, or Mother of Frost; and Me’ Chom, or Mother of the Corn-fields. The last resembles anindígena;the other two are Ladinas. The three ofthem eat only incense and candles.The mountain gods have diverse characters; some are magnanimous; othersare miserly. Together with the sun god, these mountain gods are most commonlyprayed to in agrarian ceremonies and also for treatment of illness.Tzeltal MayaReporting on the Tzeltalmunicipioof Oxchuc, Villa Rojas (1969:205) empha-sizes the importance of sacred caves: ‘‘Eachparajeis bound by religious ties toa given cave where a cross, the supreme sacred symbol, is kept.

He reports that thech’ulel,or inner soul, of a person isfound in the heart and also in a cave in the interior of a mountain. There are fourof these caves, each occupied by the inner souls of members of the four phratriesthat comprise patrilineal clans.The sacred mountains are located outside the territory of Cancuc in what isconceived of as the directions of the four corners of their world (Pitarch Ramon1996:35–36). All these sacred mountains are pyramidal in form and divided intothirteen horizontal levels. On the three upper levels are the inner souls of theCancuqueros: the top level comprises the eldest; the second level down, personsaged twenty to forty; and the third level down, persons under twenty years ofage (Pitarch Ramon 1996:37–38). Thech’iibalis a ‘‘nursery of souls,’’ a ‘‘gar-den of infancy.’’ In thisch’iibalthe souls of infants of all of the phratries areembraced and cared for; they are nursed by women older than twenty, carriedaround by women under twenty, while men bring food, play with them, and takethem on journeys. The women who care for the souls of infants are not theirCancuc mothers, but are, rather, their fathers’ sisters, because infants belong tothe father’s phratry in this patrilineal system (Pitarch Ramon 1996:40–41).In these great houses in the mountains, religious and civil officials are selectedand installed. All of these officials are subordinate to a woman called the Muk’ul-Me’el, who is in charge (Pitarch Ramon 1993:53).Long prayers are chanted for these sacred mountains during curing cere-monies, for example (Pitarch Ramon 1996:38; Vogt’s translation):Holy living mountains,Venerated living mountains.Where you are gathered,Where all of you are,Holy mothers,Holy fathers,Great House,Great Mansion,On your benches,On your stools,"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"172The Maya RegionOn your [Ladino-style] chairs,On your large chairs,With yellow-feathered chickens,With yellow-haired dogs,With yellow chairs,With yellow stools.Mauer (1983:114–116) reports that the residents of Guaquitepec, a Tzeltalcommunity in themunicipioof Chilon, believe that the mountains are alive andare the seat of a great power—bayel stul.The mountains, calledch’ul witz(ch’ulis the Tzotzil word for ‘‘holy’’ or ‘‘sacred’’), are the fountains of life for thepeople; it is there that they plant maize, gather firewood, and draw their water,which gushes out from the mountains. Three or four mountains are ‘‘really alive’’(Mauer 1983:116), and their caves are residences for the Virgin—the mother ofmaize, the Angel—the protector of wildlife, as well as various saints and a cross.The people are afraid to enter these caves except to make offerings and pray, be-cause the mountain gods might become angry and shut the doors to the caves.The earth, Ch’ul Lum, is considered to be a benefactor, but also wishes to con-sume everything it produces. Lightning is called Chahwk, and is considered tobe the wife of the Ajaw, the Lord of the Cave.Nash (1970:5–6, 23–26, Pl. 1 and 2) reports that the Amatenango ances-tors, Me’tik-Tatik, live in a cave in a sacred mountain called Amawitz locatednorthwest of the center. On the summit of this mountain is a rock supportinga shrine called Hol Shan (Head of Palm). Behind this shrine is the Cave of theAncestors, in which the ancestors are believed to live. It was from the mouthof this cave that the ancestors looked out over the valley and advised the peopleto settle in the valley below, where there was a better water supply than on themountain. On the Day of the Cross, May 3, the shamans and religious officialstraditionally visited the Cave of the Ancestors to light candles and incense. Theleading shamans went into the cave, where there was a lake and a beautiful field,to ask the ancestors for rain and good crops; then they emerged and told thepeople what the ancestors had said.According to Hermitte (1964:54–59), the caves in the hills surrounding theTzeltal community of Pinola are inhabited by many powerful deities—Thunder-bolt, Meteor, Whirlwind, and the Sombrerón (Man with the Big Hat)—allmaking these places dangerous for ordinary persons. Thunderbolt and Meteoralso reside in water holes. The animal-spirit companions are kept in the cavesand guarded by the powerful deities.

The caves are far from eachother, but the souls that inhabit them can communicate easily by flying or bytraveling along subterranean passages between caves.Tojolabal MayaWhile there is scant information on sacred mountains and caves per se in theethnological reports on the Tojolabal, early archaeological reports by Blom(1954) and Johnson (1954) give accounts of caves in which were discovered urnscontaining human ashes (from cremation), human bones, as well as textile frag-ments in a pot in Chiptik Cave. Lenkersdorf and Van Der Haar (1998) suggestthat Chiptik Cave may be Cueva Chawal, in which the contemporary Tojolabalperform ceremonies (see below).Humberto Ruz (1982:63) reports on a supernatural figure called Niwan Pu-kuj (Large Demon), or Niwan Winik (Large Man), who dwells in a large cave.He sits on an armadillo and has a large deer as a mount.Lenkersdorf (1996) and Lenkersdorf and Van Der Haar (1998) also empha-size the importance of sacred caves where ceremonies are held, especially for K’inMayo (La Fiesta de Mayo), beginning on May 3 and lasting until May 9. In thecommunity of San Miguel Chiptik these rituals take place at ‘Olom Ha (Cabezade Agua—Headwater), a spring at the base of a mountain where a small riverwith a swift current originates, as well as at the Cueva Chawal, which is locatedon the side of a mountain and believed to be the home of San Miguel Arcángel,the patron saint of the community. The rituals include processions to the cavesin which men carry banners that are kept in the church (along with the flutesand drums). Flutes, drums, violins, and guitars are played; both men and womendance; skyrockets are fired; copal incense is burned; and prayers are offered toSanMiguel.OnMay4thereisapilgrimagetothefieldstomakeofferingsandpray for the crops.

Hence, the worship atcaves provides access to the givers of life and springs of water (some emanatingfrom caves), which are the vital sources of water for the region.Chol MayaPérez Chacón (1988:214–215) reports that for the Chol community of Tila themountain called San Antonio contains San Antonio Cave, which has a cross"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"174The Maya Regionand a stone image of the Señor de Tila, a black Christ figure that now serves asthe patron saint of Tila.Holy water is believed to emerge from the head of the stone image in thecave.

They also report thatstalactites are believed to be breasts, and likening the dripping of water onto theground to the ‘‘breast-feeding’’ of the earth. Stalagmites are called erect penises,and when the two cave formations meet, a man and a woman are mating—allof which are powerful symbols of fertility. It is no wonder that the Maya breakoff pieces of these cave formations and place them on their family altars.A myth about the origin of the church of Señor Tila is related in the commu-nity. There were three attempts to build the church. The first was at Misija, butthe site was visited by Señor Tila, and he was displeased because the location wastoo humid. The second attempt occurred at Chulum Chico, which Señor Tiladecided had too many anthills. The third unsuccessful attempt took place in thecemetery of the town of Tila, but Señor Tila did not like this site either. Finally,on the fourth try the present site of the church met with Señor Tila’s approval.But then people from San Cristóbal came to make off with the riches in thechurch, so Señor Tila left to hide in the cave in San Antonio Mountain. Aftersome time elapsed, Señor Tila returned to his proper niche in the church, whichis the site of large pilgrimages every year in January (Pérez Chacón 1988:308–315).According to Whittaker and Warkentin (1965:81–85), as happens amongthe Tojolabal, Chol men and women perform ritual dances in sacred caves, butthese occasions often result in adultery when the women’s round skirts come offand the men throw the women down (i.e., copulate with them), either in thecaves or in the woods on the way home. Whittaker and Warkentin (1965:135–138) also describe the ‘‘cave god’’ and the ‘‘cave devil,’’ who can grab a person’s‘‘ch’ujlel’’ (soul, spirit); it is where the ‘‘ch’ujlel’’ of ‘‘xwujt’’ (translated as ‘‘witchdoctor’’ by the authors) can talk to the cave god who has sold the spirit of an illperson to the devil. When the witch doctor goes into the cave to ask that thespirit of his patient be released, the cave god throws the spirit out flying.Cruz Guzmán et al.

(2002:8–10) also note that the Day of the Cross ceremonies per-formed by the Chol on May 3 contain many Pre-Columbian elements, becauseMay 3 occurs at the beginning of the rainy season. The setting-up of the crossassures that ‘‘the water will start flowing again’’ in Jolja Cave (see Whittaker andWarkentin 1965:77–78). Bassie et al. also suggest that the Tumbala region wasof importance to the Maya for quetzal feathers. The indigenous name for Tum-bala was K’uk’ Witz (Quetzal Mountain), which, along with other evidence, hasled Audrey Korelstein (1988) to hypothesize that male quetzals were trappedfor their colorful plumage in this mountainous region at the northern edge ofthe Chiapas Highlands.Manca (1995), Marion (1994), and Morales Bermúdez (1999) have deepenedand extended our knowledge of the ritual use of Chol sacred caves. Manca, whoworked for the Secretaría de Salud Pública in Tila, reports that caves have a spe-cial place in Chol culture. They are the dwelling places ofxibaj(evil spirits) aswell as ofwitz chen(good spirits), the place of origin of the Chol people them-selves, and of the Black Christ (the patron saint of Tila); they are also the site oftrials that make up the rite of passage for a person becoming axjut(shaman) andthe place where the shamans take their patients for curing ceremonies. In theorigin myth of the Chol, Ch’ujtiat (Holy Father, who is both primeval fatherand mother) created the earth by taking it out of his navel. The earth was verysoft at the beginning, softer than water or a cloud, more like a soft breeze. Sym-bolically, Ch’ujtiat’s stomach, full of new life, was like a cave. In Chol, a caveis calledch’en tun,literally, ‘‘hole rock.’’ A cave near Tumbala became a privi-leged place where the ancestors of the Chol were born and where they settled. InTila the patron saint is the Black Christ, who appeared in a nearby cave (Manca1995:224–225).Another important origin myth reported by Manca (1995:225–226) is thatof thetigre( jaguar). When the hero twins were traveling over the earth, theyencountered a large cave with many rocks in the form of jaguars. Only one of"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"176The Maya Regionthe twins had the courage to touch one of the jaguar rocks, which turned intoa live jaguar. The other twin was so jealous that he killed his brother and threwhim toward a lake. The jaguar watched and then approached the dead brotherand brought him back to life. After that, the jaguar was his constant compan-ion, hisnagual.The jaguar is the most powerful animal companion and alwaysserves as the spirit companion of a Chol shaman.The myth also describes how Ch’ujtiat first found maize in a cave. A bolt ofgreen lightning cracked open a rock under which he discovered kernels of maize(Manca 1995:226).Caves also have a crucial role to play in the making of a Chol shaman (Manca1995:229). A novice shaman not only pays his respects to the saints in thechurches, including the important Black Christ, but also must also show hiscourage by meeting the spirits of the Underworld in a journey through the cavecalled Tumbuluch, or Cha’ba Otiot (Sacred House) by people living in Tila.This cave is located on the southwestern edge of the town of Tila, accordingto Bassie (personal communication, May 30, 2002), who reports that Tumbu-luch is the name of a stream that flows adjacent to the cave and that the localpeople call the cave Cha’ba Otiot. Further, the novice must visit Uran, the Lordof the Mountains, the Lightning, and the Animals. The animals are ferociousuntil they are calmed by Uran after he receives two bottles ofaguardienteandgrants the novice shaman’s request that he be taught how to cure illness. In thecuring rituals performed after this experience, the shaman takes patients intothe caves to pray to the Underworld spirits, both thewitz ch’en(good spirits)and thexibaj(the evil spirits).Ethnographic Patterns and VariationsThese ethnographic data clearly highlight the crucial importance of caves andmountains in the cosmology of Highland Chiapas. For the most part, thesesacred caves are located at the base, or in the sides, of mountains. Whethercaves are also found under, or closely linked to, prominent Pre-Columbian ar-chaeological sites in Chiapas, as Brady (1997:614) hypothesizes for centers inthe Maya region, is not yet clear.The common elements in this ethnographic depiction of the sacred geogra-phy that emerge from our Highland Chiapas data include the following:1. Caves and mountains are closely interrelated geologically and symbolically.2. The caves and mountains are believed to be inhabited by either the essences(inner souls) or the co-essences (animal-spirit companions), or both, of allliving members of the group that pertains to the cave and/or mountain."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Ritual Caves among the Ancient and Modern Maya1773. The souls of living members of the community are ‘‘embraced’’ (i.e.,guarded, cared for) by mountain deities described most frequently as an-cestors or by the souls of older living members looking after the youngermembers, especially the infants (see the Cancuc data).4. The mountain caves are portals to the Underworld and the source of light-ning, thunder, clouds, and rain, which are controlled by the mountain godswho live in these caves with their virginal daughters. These daughters spendtheir time fluffing cotton, which will be transformed into rain clouds by thefertilizing lightning bolt of Anhel. The rain-laden clouds then issue forthfrom the mouths of caves, beginning the rainy season and bringing life tothe land (Morris 1987:105–119). Sometimes the lightning is used to pun-ish living members who have misbehaved, but more often it is employed tobring the rainfall needed for the maize fields. In nearly all cases, importantsacred caves are ones from which springs or streams emanate. They pro-vide the crucial water for the household, for livestock, and for garden plotsduring the long winter dry season.5. Cave ‘‘doors’’ are believed to be open on certain days, and the entrancesare sometimes guarded by toads or snakes. We note that snakes are alsocommonly seen on Pre-Columbian images of thewitz(hill) mask.6. The shrines for communicating with the mountain gods are now almostalways Catholic-looking crosses locatedat the entrances to or inside of cavesand at the foot and summit of sacred mountains. Rituals which includeofferings of copal incense, rum, and burning candles take place at these crossshrines.7. Where one mountain is of central importance to a community, it is alwayslocated to the east; hence the ritualists face the rising sun when communi-cating with the gods.The basic variations we perceive in this Highland Chiapas ethnographic de-piction are as follows:1. In some cases (in Zinacantan and Chamula), a marked differentiation occursbetween the Fathers-Mothers ancestral deities living in ‘‘houses’’ inside themountains and the Earth Owners who inhabit caves. The ancestral Fathers-Mothers are pictured as elderly Indians; the Earth Owners are portrayed asgreedy Ladino landowners.2. Some communities (San Andrés Larrainzar and Cancuc) believe mountainshave levels like pyramids and describe the higher levels as containing theco-essences of the eldest and most powerful members of the communities.3. Some (San Andrés Larrainzar, Oxchuc, Cancuc) believe the animal-spiritcompanions of different patrilineages inhabit different caves or mountains;"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"178The Maya Regionothers (Chamula, Zinacantan) report that all of the co-essences dwell in onemountain. Further, Zinacantecos report that while all of the co-essences arekept in four corrals in the mountain east of the ceremonial center, ancestraldeities inhabit both mountains located around the center and local hills thatare the abodes of ancestors of water-hole groups and patrilineages.4. Some (Chalchihuitan, according to Kohler 1995) do not have ancestors in-habiting sacred mountains, but do have mountain gods who are owners ofwild animals such as deer that are ridden by these gods.5. The use of caves for shamans’ performance of witchcraft ceremonieshas been reported for Zinacantan (Vogt 1969:406–412) and San AndrésLarrainzar (Uke 1970), but is undoubtedly widespread in the ChiapasHighlands.6. Manca’s interesting data on the Chol (1995) add a number of distinctivepatterns that merit further investigation in the Tzotzil and Tzeltal com-munities of Highland Chiapas. These patterns include the belief that theChol people originated in a cave; that the patron saint, as well as the jaguarwhich serves as an animal-spirit companion, especially for shamans, andthe first maize seeds were all found in caves; and that caves are involved inthe initiation of new shamans, who must make a journey through a largecave and display courage in encounters with the spirits of the Underworld.Later, these shamans take their patients into caves as a crucial part of curingceremonies.This variation we now see in the Chiapas highlands is most probably the re-sult of different historical episodes in the encounter between the Pre-ColumbianMaya and the conquering Spaniards. There has been, to use Watanabe’s (1990)felicitous phrase, ‘‘recombinant patterning’’ in Maya syncretism. The syncretismof Maya and Spanish elements in the concepts of ancestors and Earth Ownersliving in caves in sacred mountains serves to situate contemporary Maya com-munities morally, historically, and physically. As Watanabe (1990:144) writesabout saints, ancestors, and Earth Owners, ‘‘Saints substantiate the ongoingvitality of local life; ancestors anchor the ever-changing present into the undeni-able precedents of the past; and earth owners personify inescapable encompass-ments by natural as well as human realities.’’ These human realities include, ofcourse, Ladinos’ control of the political and economic system, as well as theirlarge landholdings in many parts of Chiapas. Hence, the Earth Owner is nowperceived as a greedy landowner by many of the contemporary Maya.The Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya approach to variation from community to com-munity concurs with the interpretation offered by Gillespie andJoyce(1998)of the fluidity found in the Pre-Columbian Maya deity imagery. The authorsview the Pre-Columbian deities pictured and described in the sculptural iconog-"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Ritual Caves among the Ancient and Modern Maya179raphy and glyphs as serving as metaphorical representations of dynamic socialand cosmic processes. The contemporary Earth Owner may be variously per-ceived as a mountain god who controls the lightning, thunder, clouds, and rainfor the Maya crops; as an angry ancestral god who uses lightning bolts to punishunacceptable behavior; or as a fat, greedy Ladino landowner who needs manyworkers on his plantations and requires those whose souls have been ‘‘sold’’ tohim to work until the iron huaraches he provides wear out.ConclusionsBy their very structure, caves in the limestone formations of Maya country arepassageways between the visible world of the earth’s surface and the interior ofmountains and the nether regions of the Underworld. In this borderline posi-tion, caves are prime examples of the boundary between the natural and thesupernatural, between the human and the superhuman domains of the Mayacosmos. Turner (1964) and Leach (1964), among others, posited that these am-biguous, boundary-line settings were sacred and generated taboos and rituals inhuman societies.Pre-Columbian and contemporary Maya data reinforce this hypothesis. ThePre-Columbian use of caves for elaborate rituals has now been widely demon-strated. As Brady (1997:603) describes so cogently, ‘‘the most sacred locationsare those that combine the fundamental elements of earth and water in a uni-fied sacred expression of the power of the earth...thecenote, a cave feature,defines the center. According to Eliade (1969:37–47), the center is where thethree levels of the universe meet. Caves, as breaks in the earth’s surface, wereseen by the Maya as entry points into the Underworld and, therefore, as featuresthat transcend world levels.’’ A multiplicity of shrines with Catholic-lookingcrosses at the edge of or in caves near contemporary Maya communities, as wellas the widespread use of enigmatic plants, such as the bromeliads, in decoratingthese cross shrines, underscore this symbolism among the modern Maya.Bromeliads are ‘‘air plants’’; that is, they grow on trees, but have no rootsin the ground, nor are they parasites. Rather, they derive their water from themist or raindrops that fall into the plants. They are nourished by leaves fromthe host tree that drop into a kind of nutritious soup that forms at the base ofthese plants. Plants that live in the air on the branches of trees, but that are notparasites, form a meaningful, and appropriately ambiguous, symbolic icon foruse in rituals performed at the mouths of or in caves at the edge of this world—that is, in the passageways to the supernatural world inside mountains or deepinside the Underworld of the Maya.Whether or not the Classic Maya utilized bromeliads to decorate shrines at"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"180The Maya Regionthe entrances to caves, we do not know. But that caves in Maya country were,and are, the focus for elaborate rituals marking the passageways into the Under-world with its earth owners who control the clouds, lightning, thunder, rain,springs, and streams that provide the necessary water for people, animals, andcrops, is abundantly clear. As recent hieroglyphic evidence may suggest, how-ever, caves in Classic Maya cosmology were seen as the abode of many types ofgods and as the location of important ‘‘creation’’ events (a notion that has obvi-ous parallels elsewhere in Mesoamerica). In these capacities, caves also were keyelements in defining the religious and even political identity of ancient urbancommunities. Future work will refine these interpretations, but both ancient andmodern evidence reveals an essential and meaningful continuity in how caveswere used and conceived of in Maya thought.Notes1. The transcription of Maya hieroglyphic signs (i.e., theCH’EENglyph) followsthe widely accepted convention of using boldface to express sign values. (The internalvowel of the Classic wordch’eenis reconstructed as long, although this is not always seenin modern forms.) Italicized words less specifically apply to modern or Classic Mayanterms or phrases under discussion (i.e., the wordch’en). We should also note that for his-torical and modern Mayan words we have retained the spellings and orthographies ofour sources, rather than modifying them for overall consistency.2. The wordch’ieb’alorch’ibalseems to be a noun derived from the rootch’ih,‘‘togrow.’’3. Anhel is derived from the Spanish word for ‘‘angel,’’ introduced in the sixteenthcentury. It is also used in other Tzotzil communities.ReferencesAdams, Robert McCormick1961 Changing Patterns of Territorial Organization in the Central Highlands ofChiapas.American Antiquity26:341–360.Alejos García, José1994Mosojantel: Etnografía del discurso agrarista entre los Choles de Chiapas.Univer-sidad National Autónoma de México, Mexico City.Andrews, E.

Until the 1990s, however,ch’e’endid not form an integral part of mostdiscussions of Pre-Columbian Maya society. Since the 1980s, caves have becomeincreasingly recognized in archaeological and epigraphic investigations of settle-ments and ideology. The rapid evolution of Maya cave archaeology since the1990s has spurred developments in both field methods and interpretation. Ar-chaeologists are now investigating more specific questions concerning the natureof rituals performed in caves and the types of actors involved in those events.Initial investigations of caves in the southern Maya region tended to focus onlarge caves, perhaps because the extensive dark zones facilitated attributing thearchaeological contexts to ritual activity. What is needed, but has not yet beenachieved, is a detailed examination of how variability in cave morphology, arti-fact assemblages, and relation to surface sites affects the types of activities con-ducted in caves. Archaeological, ethnohistorical, and ethnographic data indicatethat caves were used for a variety of purposes, including large-scale pilgrimageactivities, public politywide ceremonies and validation of space, the seclusionof shamans, mortuary activity, group and individual rituals related to agricul-tural success, personal health, and the accumulation of wealth and social status(Adams and Brady 1994; Brady and Prufer 1999; Gossen 1974:294; McGee1990:58–59; Sanmiguel 1994; Schackt 1984:18–19; Villa Rojas 1969:241).While it is well established that caves used in Pre-Columbian times werethe loci of ritual activities, there is a good deal of variation within each cave interms of patterns of utilization. At a minimum, there appears to be a widespreaddistinction between twilight-zone public-ritual activities and activities in morerestricted dark-zone areas. Brady (1989; also see Brady et al. 1992) first pro-posed, based on contexts from Naj Tunich, Guatemala, that variability in cave"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists187artifact assemblages between cave zones might reflect the status of participants.He posited that in Naj Tunich’s large semilight entrance area, public ritualswere conducted and speculated that these might have involved elite communitymembers as protagonists. Conversely, artifact distributions indicated that darkinterior cave passages might have been restricted to more private ritual activities,though these activities might also have been intended to facilitate elite ritualagendas. While Brady’s distinction appears to be accurate, it addresses only asingle dimension of the complex social and religious interrelationships in whichcave sites were embedded—those involving elite members of a political organi-zation. In order to understand how a particular cave, or part of a cave, was used,one must address all of the major social components that were operating in thatparticular situation.The basic concept that different parts of caves were used for different activi-ties also seems well established (Prufer 2002). If we assume that there are dis-cernible patterns to these activities (reflected in artifacts, cave types, or by com-parison or contrast with surface site contexts), the isolation of specific contextswill allow us to investigate those activities more accurately and perhaps identifycategories of social actors. It seems likely that ritual specialists were deeply in-volved in all aspects of cave and rockshelter activities, both public and private. Itis also likely that the same ritual specialists were involved in activities at surfacesites. However, ritual specialists are notoriously ambiguous, and some of theiractivities may be more individualized, less public, and less clearly defined in thearchaeological record.I first review the status of ritual specialists called ‘‘shamans’’ in current an-thropological thought. The study of ritual and ritual specialists has been fraughtwith contention and lack of consensus regarding the role of inspirational prac-titioners in modern and traditional societies and categories and definitions ofritual actors. Next I discuss several ethnographic studies that examine the mul-tiple ways ritual specialists operate in different societies—as actors in political,healing, illness, and formal religious arenas. If we more clearly elucidate the rolesof contemporary and historical ritual specialists, it becomes easier to understandhow broadly these types of individuals may have affected prehistoric societies.I then examine ethnographic and ethnohistorical data from Mesoamerica toshow that regionally based analogical models can inform archaeological inter-pretation. Finally, drawing on archaeological data from the Maya Mountains ofsouthern Belize, I focus on a number of cave contexts in order to identify vari-ability in artifact and cave types and distributions that may indicate the activitiesof different types of ritual practitioners."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"188The Maya RegionRitual Specialists in Anthropological PerspectiveThe discussion of ancient Maya cave use almost always refers to some type ofspecialized religious activity and, therefore, in all likelihood, to the actions ofritual specialists. Since the role of ritual specialists in nonindustrial societieshas received considerable attention in the anthropological literature, this hasstrongly influenced the way archaeologists interpret contexts considered to havebeen utilized by such specialists. They play an important role in both technologi-cally modern and traditional societies, and examination of ethnographic studiesindicates that ritual specialists operate in multiple ways in different societies.Here, I refer to the specialists involved in many ritual cave activities as ‘‘sha-mans.’’ I do not do this without acknowledging that there has been a great deal ofcriticism of the use of this term to describe a wide range of ritual specialists, andthat there are problems associated with generalized cultural evolution that tendto obfuscate religious complexity (Geertz 1966; Taussig 1980:221). Among thestrongest criticisms is that ‘‘shamanism’’ refers to a specific type of inspirationalreligious practice found only in archaic, minimally complex tribal societies, pri-marily in Siberia, where the term was coined (Hamayon 1994; Laufer 1917).However, since the term has gained wide currency in describing the activities ofmany types inspirational religious practitioners, I follow the lead of Thomas andHumphrey (1994:3), who assert that replacing the problematic term ‘‘shaman’’will not lead to ‘‘more conceptual precision.’’The study of shamanism, among the many forms of religious expression, hasremained one of most widely addressed and, sadly, one of the least agreed upon.Durkheimian and Weberian focuses on the sacred versus the profane and on evo-lutionary processes of the rationalization of religion have tended to cast the sub-ject of ritual specialists into ahistorical and decontexualized frameworks. Theseignore the imbeddedness of different forms of religious expression in society andreplace historical contexts of multifaceted and changing ritual behaviors withlaundry lists of typological features.Eliade (1964:182), perhaps the authority most frequently cited by archaeolo-gists, has described the shamanic practice as ‘‘psychopomp,’’ the practitionersas guardians of the human soul, and their practice, shamanism, as a ‘‘techniqueof ecstasy.’’ This shamanic ecstasy ‘‘signifies the soul’s flight to heaven, its wan-derings about the earth, or its descent into the subterranean world, among thedead’’ (Eliade 1964:8). Eliade’s shamans undertake these ecstatic journeys forfour reasons: first, to meet the celestial god face to face and bring him an offer-ing from the community; second, to seek the soul of a sick man; third, to guidethe soul of a dead man to its new abode; or fourth, to add to their knowledgeby contacting higher nonhuman beings (1987:205).In his discussion of North American shamanism, Eliade (1964:298–299), on"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists189the one hand, accepts Park’s (1934) definition of shamanism as ‘‘all the prac-tices by which supernatural power may be acquired by mortals, the exercise ofthat power either for good or evil, and all the concepts and beliefs associatedwith these practices.’’ On the other hand, Eliade qualifies shamanism, distin-guishing the ecstatic qualities of the shaman from those of the priest and fromthe ‘‘antisocial’’ actions of the sorcerer. Such distinctions clearly are not onlysimplistic in assignment of roles, but, as will be discussed below, largely inaccu-rate. Even Eliade (1987:205) acknowledges problems with differentiating sor-cery from shamanism when he discusses the difference between ‘‘white’’ and‘‘black’’ shamans and emphasizes that, among the Siberian Altaic people, thelatter is more adept at negotiating travel to the Underworld. He asserts that,among ‘‘North American’’ shamans, the normally ‘‘benevolent’’ shaman may beinterpreted within his or her community as being malevolent and engaging insorcery, witchcraft, or revenge (1987:217). He also insists that the role of sha-man is restricted to individuals whose ‘‘soul is believed to leave his body andascend to heaven or the sky or to the underworld’’ (1987:202), thus excludinginspirational practitioners whose activities revolve around spirit possession.Some archaeologists have adopted these points, but this restricted notion ofshamanism has been challenged by Lewis (1989:43–44). Lewis argues that thedistinction represents a ‘‘Hegelian contrast’’ and notes that shamanism and spiritpossession frequently co-occur, even among the Siberian and Central Asian peo-ples who provide the examples Eliade drew on. Russian ethnographers haveleveled similar criticisms at Eliade’s generalized theories of shamanism. Basilov(1997:47nk) points out that Eliade’s 1951 treatise on shamanism is ‘‘helpful forits scope but remarkably inaccurate on details of Siberian shamanism.’’Ultimately, the problem is that Eliade is a true believer in shamanic com-munication with the divine, a bias that tends to be reflected in his writing. Hetherefore insists on distinguishing ‘‘true’’ shamans from ‘‘hucksters,’’ a point thatignores completely their performance of many of the same social roles and fur-ther detracts from any analysis, culture specific or comparative, of how shaman-ism affects religious or ideological systems in a society.This is not to ignore the contributions of generalized comparative studies.They have illuminated some of the remarkable similarities in shamanic prac-tices worldwide and, likely, through time. These include the shaman’s ability tomediate forces on the celestial, the terrestrial, and the underworld planes; thepresence of a ‘‘cosmic’’ axis, or world tree, linking these planes—general fea-tures that link shamanic training in different parts of the world; and the roleof the shaman in preventing or mitigating soul loss in the healing and illnesscomplex (Alekseev 1997; Eliade 1964:110–139, 217, 259–267, 298; Eliade 1987;Furst 1994:4–8; Layton 2000). Overreliance on these types of assessments pro-vides context-free models based entirely on imagery that does not necessarily tell"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"190The Maya Regionus what shamans do, nor do these models necessarily apply to all inspirationalpractitioners in all places at all times (Humphrey 1994:192).‘‘Shaman’’ is currently used to define a dizzying number of religious actorsrepresented in a plurality of social forms, ranging from hunter-and-gatherersocieties to industrial states. Since the 1980s, anthropological studies have fo-cused on the place of shamanism in the context of history and political com-plexity and have linked aspects of its practice to the development and decline ofstate formations (e.g., Atkinson 1992:314–315). These studies, it is important tonote, reveal the complex manner in which shamans operate in both religious andpolitical arenas. Shamanism is no longer seen just as ‘‘elementary or primitive asa symbolic system or form of religion’’ (Hamayon 1994:76), but as operating onany number of political, religious, social, and economic levels in societies of vary-ing political and economic complexity. It is also viewed as constantly changingin response to political and historical circumstances (Atkinson 1992; Graham1995; Hill 2002; Layton 2000:179; Taussig 1987).In extreme cases, shamanic ritual can sometimes be seen as being about non-ritual social and cultural processes, as opposed to being a direct reflection of them(Turner 1992). In many cases, shamans may be seen as being ascriptively placedoutside of the structure of a social system, or as voluntarily placing themselvesoutside of the normative behaviors of the ‘‘status occupying actors’’ (Turner1974:233).Regardless of whether ritual specialists operate with the sanction of status-occupying actors, or on the fringes of the social structure, they are generally po-litically motivated (Atkinson 1992). It is precisely the indeterminacy and ambi-guity of their practices and beliefs that make shamans such a pervasive andpotent force across a range of social, political, and temporal boundaries.The foregoing discussion has important implications for the archaeologicalreconstruction of behaviors in relation to the sacred landscape of caves. The ap-plication of the traditional generalized model of shamanism will tend to mini-mize variability in the interpretation of contexts and to confine these interpre-tations to the realm of belief. To remedy this, archaeological data need to beinterpreted in light of the potential breadth of shamanic practices in contempo-rary and past societies rather than assigned specific functions or traits. Deficientinterpretation is partially due to the tendency of archaeologists ‘‘to accept thosemethodological conventions of...comparative religion, and history that favorbelief systems’’ rather than to see ritual and the actions of religious practicesas a ‘‘disciplined and skillful behavioral practice’’ that leaves material residues(Walker 1995:70). As the next section will show, ritual specialists operate on dif-ferent social, political, and ideological levels in modern and premodern society.By being aware of the range of possible roles they play, it may be possible toilluminate wider social, economic, and political processes."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists191Variations in Shamanic InstitutionsThis chapter began with a discussion of variability in the use of caves basedon both geomorphological qualities and types of religious expression. In otherwords, I suggested that cave ceremonies involved at least two types of activity(public political/religious, and private sociomedical/religious), possibly deter-mined by physical setting, and likely by the involvement of different types ofritual protagonists. To support this distinction, I have selected three examples toillustrate the roles of shamanism in different types of social organization fromdifferent parts of the world at different times. They cannot be compared in termsof specific transposable features, nor can they be used as equivalents for the an-cient or modern Maya. What they do is demonstrate some of the variabilityin the ways shamanism can be deeply intertwined with systems of power andauthority, often in contested ways.Hugh-Jones (1994) compares ethnographic data on the training, status, andsymbolism associated with Amazonianshamanism from such diverse groups asthe Yanamamo, the Achuar, and the Bororo, as well as other Arawakan andTukanoan speakers. Among these distantly related linguistic groups he distin-guishes two ideal types of shamanism: vertical and horizontal. Vertical shaman-ism is characterized by hereditary transmission of knowledge within a small elitesegment of society; the actors are morally unambiguous and powerful and playan important role in ritual activities related to social reproduction. More closely(though not exclusively) associated with ranked societies, vertical shamans areconcerned with matters of descent and are recognized as possessing knowledgein the form of mythological canons. They engage in verbal transmission of powerand are generally older and less active than horizontal shamans. They officiateat rites of passage and, when engaged in healing, avoid the use of hallucinogensas well as direct contact with patients.By comparison, Amazonian horizontal shamans are associated more withegalitarian societies that place emphasis on the forest, societies where secularand sacred power are more clearly distinguished. They are morally ambiguous,transmission of knowledge is nonhereditary, and they are only marginally in-volved with rituals of social reproduction. Horizontal shamans are consideredpowerful, as opposed to knowledgeable, are associated with jaguars and hunting,are considered aggressive, and are feared. In healing they may rely on halluci-nogenic substances and have direct contact with patients. Their dangerous andmarginalized nature associates horizontal shamans with messianic prophets ofmillennial cults (Hugh-Jones 1994:46–47).Shamans among the Tukanoans of the Vaupes River (Hugh-Jones 1994:38)are divided into two categories:yai( jaguar), orpayéand ̃kubu(priest).1Thepayéutilize hallucinogenic snuffs from which they derive visionary powers that"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"192The Maya Regionallow them to cure. The power of these snuffs comes from jaguars, as well asfrom thunder and lightning.Payéare also marginalized individuals, living awayfrom the community and often feared and ostracized.Payéare taught by non-relatives, and there may be payment in exchange for training. The Desenapayéhave knowledge of their ecosystems that makes them economically important.During hallucinogenic trance states, they visit animal masters to obtain infor-mation about the location of game and fish, then pass that information on tohunters (Hugh-Jones 1994:38–41).Jaguar imagery is common in Amazonian shamanism. Among the CanelosQuichua of eastern Ecuador, jaguars represent the animal transformation ofthe shaman (Whitten 1976:847), and among the Kogi of northern Colombia,jaguar lords and shaman priests inhabit the darkness and the netherworld, whichstands in opposition to shamanic forces that are associated with light (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1987:106).The powers of the ̃kubucome from their extensive knowledge of mythichistory. The traditional knowledge associated with the position is transmittedpatrilineally and based on the commitment to memory of extensive myths, spells,chants, and ceremonies. This knowledge is used throughout their career in theexecution of their duties: making food safe; diagnosing and curing illness; divin-ing; conducting community rituals; and mediating with ancestors (Hugh-Jones1994:41–42).Descriptions of the role of shamanism and chiefship in precolonial easternPolynesia suggest that the two institutions competed for access to divine forcesthat controlled crop fertility, success in fishing, and the general welfare of thepeople. Thomas (1994:15–16; see also 1988) points out that, although in a crudesense ‘‘chiefs tend to be more prominent when shamans are marginal and viceversa...theformsofagencyarethemselvesmutable and subject to various trans-formations according to political, historical and cultural circumstances.’’ Henceone should not assume that shamanism is unrelated to dominant forms of hier-archy. While chiefship was the preeminent form of authority in the Tonga-Fiji-Samoa area of eastern Polynesia (a colonizing force that migrated from west-ern Polynesia), its scope and effectiveness were not uniform everywhere. Strongcompetition existed between conquering chiefs and indigenous leaders, and au-thority was sometimes diluted through junior lines that remained when sacredindigenous persons withdrew in the face of ‘‘usurping chiefs’’ from other islands(Thomas 1994:17).It is thought that ecological decline in the Marquesas Islands precipitatedby swidden-induced erosion and compounded by increased food production de-mands for elaborate feasting, although an exceptional case, led to the decline inthe power of divine chiefs. The loss of irreplaceable soils produced an overdepen-dence on breadfruit, which is susceptible to periodic drought and to destruction"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists193during episodes of warfare. The chiefs lost their ritual preeminence as a result ofbeing unable to protect the fertility of food production. At the same time, thereis evidence that while the power of chiefs was in decline, the ritual stature ofshamans was on the increase. This was in part due to the chiefs’ rarely having anypower outside of the individual tribal valleys, while shamans, calledtau’a,wererecognized as potent forces across whole islands. The chiefs emphasized their‘‘vague’’ relationship with ancestors as a form of power; this was contrasted withstrong identification oftau’awith gods. Further, thetau’aappear to have been in-stalled by institutionally-sanctioned priests of the chiefdom, which could indi-cate an indirect link between the shamans and the chief (Thomas 1994:21–23).Here, the relationship between political institutions and shamanic individualswas a mutable one in which shamans operated within mainstream institutionsand on the fringes of society, and shamanic influence was gained at the expenseof chiefly authority (Thomas 1988:60).We also see examples of the intertwining of political divinity and actions ofritual practitioners who operate outside of ascribed political roles, and the mar-ginalizing of shamans elsewhere in Polynesia. In nineteenth-century Hawaii, itwas observed that shamans were a ‘‘very eccentric class of people [who] livedapart in desert areas’’ (Thomas 1994:18, citing Malo 1951). This marginalizingis documented by their presence primarily in peripheral places, such as the smalland remote island of Niihau. In the Marquesas there is also a correlation betweenshamanism and political decentralization in the southern islands, which weremore politically fractured, and less shamanism in the northern islands, wherechiefship was more centralized and society more ranked (Thomas 1994:27).Humphrey (1994) points out that Asian shamanism can manifest itself inmore than one form, operating alongside and at the same time contesting po-litical hierarchies. Drawing examples from historical documents of the twelfth-and thirteenth-century Mongols (though not from Chinese dynastic states),she suggests that ‘‘inspirational practices were deeply implicated in the forma-tion of inner Asian states. Even after such states were bureaucratized and theirritual made liturgical, ‘the marginal’ was still necessary for the legitimizationand identity of the center, just as the imperial court was for the self-definitionof people of the periphery. Shamanic and inspirational practices were contextsfor making such links’’ (1994:193). She goes on to assert that when the Mongolstates were in their formative processes, shamanic discourse, with its empha-sis on prophecy and interpretation, especially as it related to cosmic or natu-ral events (the example she provides is that of efficacy of hailstorms in dimin-ishing the potency of ones’ enemies—success at warfare being seen as divinesanction), was an integral coalescing factor. Once a state coalesced, shamanicimagery was replaced with ancestral kinship imagery, with an emphasis on per-sonal power, though still not without appropriating ‘‘the cosmic imagery of sha-"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"194The Maya Regionmanism’’ (Humphrey 1994:194). However, it is likely that the balance of thesetwo competing enterprises was factored differently between the center and theperiphery. At the center, once the state was firmly established, it developed litur-gical, ‘‘backward-looking,’’ and highly ritualized religious practices, as opposedto the more spontaneous and decentralized shamanic activities that helped fueltheir development (Humphrey 1994:208).These examples indicate that archaeologists need to distinguish betweenritual activities performed for political reasons (legitimization of power or of re-lationships to ancestral deities) and those performed by specialists involved inthe illness and healing complex and other activities that are not clearly linked tothe political fortunes of ruling elites. The categories are not static; institutions ofritual specialization compete with each other for access to authority and power,and the social roles of specialists can change along with political institutions.The Faces of Shamanism in Maya SocietyRitual specialists in contemporary Maya societies engage in many of the types ofactivities that characterize shamanism in the foregoing examples. Hence, thereis no reason to believe that in the past these specialists did not engage in ritual-political/religious discourses from within existing hierarchies and at their mar-gins. An exhaustive discussion of all the manifestations of shamanism in presentand historical Maya societies is not possible here, but a few examples illustratethe variability and complexity of Maya shamanic practices. What is clear aboutMaya shamans and their activities is that they do not constitute a fixed canon;their activities are variable within and between groups, though they all partici-pate in larger Mesoamerican ideologies (Monaghan 1995:307–312; 2000:32).In the early historical period, and as early as 1552, chroniclers recognizedthat religious expression presented itself in different forums, each with its ownpractitioners. Shamans, called ‘‘witches’’ or ‘‘sorcerers’’ by the clergy, were con-sidered less of a threat to the church than were more institutionalized forms ofindigenous religion, referred to as ‘‘idolatry.’’ Indigenous state religion, thoughit was hardly liturgical, tended to associate itself more with Maya elites and po-litical systems. Even within the institutional state religion, there was more thanone sphere, operating at both the community and the household levels, as evi-denced by the presence of household lineage gods as well as community gods(Farriss 1984:290–291, 507nn7, 8). There is some evidence that specialists whocontinued to practice indigenous religions in the sixteenth century came fromgroups of local schoolmasters (Scholes and Roys 1938:605), who may or maynot have been elites.Modern shamanic practices are incorporated into official hierarchical insti-tutions in many indigenous communities. Thecofradía,or cargo system, present"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists195in many Maya communities, though of Spanish origin (Foster 1959, 1960), alsoclearly contains syncretic elements of Pre-Columbian institutions. In SantiagoAtitlán, not all the offices of thecofradíaare shamanic. Two, however, are occu-pied by shamans who are responsible for the performance of rituals, and theinstitution itself functions as a vehicle to assist the sun in its daily path acrossthe sky (Carlsen and Prechtel 1994:86). The first shamanic office is that of thenabeysil,who is the priest in charge of sacred bundles. He holds the positionfor life and must take a vow of celibacy. The second is the position ofteninel,which is a held for only one year. The termtenineltranslates as ‘‘to shoulder,’’and the cargo holder is responsible for carrying the deity Mam once a year dur-ing Holy Week (Carlsen and Prechtel 1994:86). Both the sacred bundle and theconcept of burden have clear Pre-Columbian ideological counterparts (Freidelet al. 1991; Mendelson 1958; Price 1974; Schele and Miller 1983).That shamanism would be associated with hierarchical institutions is not sur-prising, given the imbeddedness of ritual institutions in many Maya societies aswell as the ecological focus on terrestrial deities and landscapes that character-izes Mayan religions (Monaghan 2000:24–25). In the Tzeltal Maya communityof Oxchuc, the indigenous political and religious institution of thecalpuleis ar-ranged both hierarchically and by ascribed status. Institutionalized communityauthority is integrated into seven offices, four of which are achieved by progress-ingupastricthierarchy.Theofficesfromdzunubilon up are sacred and open onlyto people with superior knowledge, recognized moral status, and expert experi-ence in church ritual and in the indigenous ceremonies practiced in the caves,water holes, and special mountains. These cargos are thus obtained not by auto-matic advancement, but by special merit, which is usually not acquired until anadvanced age. The top three offices represent an intersection between achievedlife statuses and ascribed supernatural qualities: while individual knowledge isparamount, the high representatives of thecalpulemust also have a powerfulnagualthrough which they can learn about the private lives of their subordinates(Villa Rojas 1985:420–421).Not allnagualowners are community leaders, however. The common namefor those who possess anagualisagchamel,which translates to ‘‘maker of dis-ease,’’ a term that is not favored by some people because of its associationwith sorcery. The termpikabal,which means ‘‘pulse taker,’’ is used to refer tothose who possess anagualbut are involved in the illness and healing complex.This category is more ambiguous and contested. Competition amongpikabalesmay take the form of accusations of sorcery.Agchamelescan also, under unusualcircumstances, sell malevolent services to others (Villa Rojas 1985:531–532).However, the ambiguity of such individuals has been documented elsewhere,and in many cases there is considerably more speculative accusation of sorcerythan admission of being engaged in harmful acts (Nash 1967).Watanabe (1992) discusses the presence of at least four types of shamans"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"196The Maya Regionin the Highland Guatemalan community of Santiago Chimaltenango. Threeare recognized under the general rubric ‘‘chmaan,’’ which translates literally as‘‘grandfathers.’’ The skills of these ritual specialists are not institutionalized,though they are consulted to resolve a number of critical issues, including successin agriculture and rectifying personal misfortune or illness. However, there is aclear hierarchy in the epistemology of curing. Each specialist has a specific rangeof potential cures, and failure by one leads to consultation of a more powerfulspecialist (Watanabe 1992:188). The first line of defense against a presumed ill-ness is the consultation of a femalexhb’ool,or herbal curer. Most illnesses areregarded as ‘‘afflictions of God’’ that necessitate restoring the patient’s soul to aprevious state of equilibrium.Xhb’oolalso operate as midwives and use anoint-ments ofaguardienteand herbs sprayed into a patient’s face to return the blood tonormal. If the cure does not work, the patient consults anaj q’iij,which literallytranslates as ‘‘person of the sun/day(s)/time.’’ These individuals are diviners anduse a combination of calendrical knowledge and casting of seeds to ascertain thenature and cause of an affliction. Theaj q’iijis consulted to determine propitiousdays for community rituals and projects, thus making him a consultant for insti-tutional practitioners. In cases of affliction, theaj q’iijdetermines if the cause isan offended spirit making trouble for the patient. If this is the case, a number ofcostumbres(literally, ‘‘customs,’’ but the word refers to culturally specific actions)in the form of interventions, are prescribed and are performed by theaj q’iijonbehalf of the patient. These include the offering of candles and incense (poomte chaamb’aj). The offerings are considered neither a payment nor a sacrifice, butare ‘‘things for praying to god’’ (Watanabe 1992:190–191). This is not a singlecommunity phenomenon. The activities of such diviners (day keepers) are alsodiscussed in detail, with striking similarities, by Barbara Tedlock (1992) for thenearby community of Momostenango.Should the prayers of theaj q’iijfail to resolve the misfortune or illness, amore drastic type of intervention is called for. Theaj meesis the most powerfultype of shaman. His name literally means ‘‘person of the table,’’ which refers tothe small stools or tables he uses as an altar.Aj meescommunicate directly withthewitz,or mountain lords, on behalf of clients, and this consultation comeswith a heavy price: the patient becomes the ‘‘child’’ of the altar of theaj mees,and when he dies his soul is sent into the employ of the specificwitz(earth lord)to whom theaj meesis beholden.Aj meesare known for their extensive knowl-edge of sacred geography and can recite the names of many mountains and othersacred places (including the cross in front of the community church). The spirits,when they respond, do so in the form of small speaking saints who carry whipsmade of snakes and speak in deep voices in Spanish (Watanabe 1992:188–189).Theaj meesis the only shaman powerful enough to confront the power ofaky’aawil,who is the most dangerous and malevolent of the ritual special-"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists197ists. Watanabe’s informants were necessarily vague about the specific powers ofky’aawilindividuals, since they bring sickness and slow death to those whomthey bewitch. The power of theaj meesand theky’aawilmay be close to equiva-lent, since it takes an exceptionally strongaj meesto locate the sorcery perpe-trated by theky’aawil.There is an element of foreignness associated with theaj mees,who is de-scribed as not being from the community or as having been an immigrant fromanother community. Theseaj meesindividuals are said to be the reason why sha-manism has fallen into disfavor in recent years (Watanabe 1992:189–193).Carlsen and Prechtel (1994) outline a hierarchy of shamans in Santiago Ati-tlán that includes a category titledaj’mes.They dispute, however, that the termrelates to practitioners’ association with the ‘‘mesa,’’ or table-altar. Instead, theyclaim that the word translates literally as ‘‘sweeper’’ and that among Atitecostheaj’mesis a practitioner who ‘‘sweeps one’s road.’’ Their typology of Atitecoshamanism also represents a hierarchy of curing powers, ranging from midwivesto herbalists to day keepers to snakebite specialists to theaj’mes.They also havea category of malevolent sorcerers who remain the most poorly defined and leastidentifiable in the community of specialists (Carlsen and Prechtel 1994:100–104).Similarly, Barbara Tedlock (1992:74, 111, 124–126) discusses a category ofshamans in the hierarchy calledajnawal mesa.These individuals are considereddangerous, hold séances at midnight, and intervene with the Earth Lords whodwell in the mountain. They are highly feared and often thought to be witches(ajitz) who can cause illness. They are also greatly respected and often chosenas lineage heads and civic leaders, attesting to their potential for movement ina ritual hierarchy.In Yucatán hierarchies of religious specialists calledh’men(plural,h’menob’)include a plethora of differences in practice and status (Bartolomé 1978). Whilethe most commonh’menob’are herbalists (dzadzac), there are two types of di-viners, one of which uses corn (theah-kin) and another of which is responsiblefor predicting weather and past or future events (theah-boot). The latter diag-noses what type of ‘‘air’’ causes an illness and exorcises it. Those who deal withphysical trauma are called ‘‘bonesetters’’ (utskinah-bac), and those who deal withpsychological and emotional conflicts are referred to as ‘‘great teachers’’ (nohochmaestro). While any of theh’menob’can preside over collective rituals for agricul-ture, hunting, beekeeping, or rain prayers, the overlap of the roles is evident inthat whichever one officiates at the rain ceremony is referred to asnohoch maestro(Bartolomé 1978:78).Owing to the ambiguous and often marginalized nature of shamans, the lit-erature is frequently uneven in reporting their activities. Accounts thus mayreflect general community mistrust, to say the least, and, more likely, fear of"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"198The Maya Regioninspirational practitioners who operate outside of mainstream institutions. Sig-nificantly, shamanic practices that involve practitioners who utilize caves orthose who intervene with cave-associated deities (such as thewitz) sometimesseem to involve individuals who are more likely to be distrusted, feared, orotherwise marginalized. In discussing the multilayered universe, Hanks’s infor-mant, an inspirational ritual practitioner, acknowledged but asserted ignoranceof Underworld deities. In this shaman’s view of Yukatekan cosmology, the skywas vertically hierarchical in terms of celestial spheres, while the spirits of theUnderworld were viewed as horizontally equivalent, which may indicate a privi-leging of celestial religious hierarchies over those considered more dangerous.Hanks believed that there were other shamans who ‘‘traffic[ked] with under-world spirits [and who] differentiate[d] sectors of the underworld.’’ However,due to the ‘‘top secret’’ and dangerous nature of this type of knowledge, his in-formant was unable to provide Hanks with any information concerning thesepractices (1984:134, 160n4).The Tzotzil fear caves for their association with sorcery and because theyare portals to dangerous Earth Lords (Fábrega and Silver 1973). Sorcerers’ ma-levolent activities are believed to take place deep inside cave passages. Whilethere are someh’ilol(healing shamans) who are willing to make journeys intocaves to recover those souls sold to the Earth Lords, ‘‘this procedure is highlyreprobated and informants will furnish few details,’’ though features cogni-tively associated with caves, such as rockshelters, springs, or small cave openings,are utilized in parts of pilgrimage circuits and community rituals (Fábrega andSilver 1973:260–261). That the use of features in the landscape can be secretis evidenced in Silver’s (1966) analysis of Tzotzil shamanism in Zinacantan,Chiapas. He found that the most powerful shamans (h’iloletik) are divided intotwo groups: those who cure and those who can cause illness. The latter utilizecaves for malevolent activities, operate independently of the usual shamanic in-stitutions, and have different paraphernalia. Many ‘‘good’’h’iloletikare reputedto have no knowledge of how caves are used, though some secretly use caves torecover souls taken by witchcraft (Silver 1966:45, 219). However, like Hanks,Silver found informants extremely reluctant to discuss these activities.Caves and Shamans: A View from the Maya MountainsArchaeological data are inherently difficult to interpret in terms of assigning so-cial roles to actors in religious activities. However, variability in cave data mayindicate the presence of different types of ritual specialists in Pre-Columbianceremonial activities. In our study area, two small Late Classic communities inthe Maya Mountains of southern Belize (Figure 8.1), investigations since 1992"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists199indicate that both cave type and proximity to settlement may have been fac-tors in different types of utilization. These Maya Mountains communities offera rare and relatively unspoiled laboratory in which to explore community-widecave utilization. Located in a rugged, remote, and unpopulated area of Belize,eleven Early to Late Classic communities and over one hundred caves have beendocumented in the karstic flanks of volcanic mountains. Owing to the difficultterrain, the number of cave sites recorded likely represents just a fraction of thosethat exist. We investigated two moderately sized Late Classic centers locatednear the headwaters of the Bladen Branch of the Monkey River (Figure 8.2) andforty-seven caves and five rockshelters near the sites of Ek Xux and MuklebalTzul over a four-year period (Prufer 2002).There, Brady’s conceptual framework appears to be supported. Activity incaves with cavernous semilight entrance rooms appears attributable to publicceremonial activities and to activities performed in rockshelters, which are, forthe most part, well lighted and easily accessible. It is likely that all the caves andshelters were part of ritual circuits traveled by different specialists as part of theirreligious duties. Such circuits are fundamental to the organization of specialist-mediated activities across the Maya area (Hanks 1990:337; Redfield and VillaRojas 1934:176; Sosa 1985:343–344; Wauchope 1938:143).Caves located at the eastern margins of the two communities appear to haveevidence of public use. Specialized artifacts from these sites have correlates withexcavations from within the civic ceremonial areas of the surface sites, in somecases possibly linking these activities to local elites. Repeated use and smashingof large effigy censers, multiple non-elite mortuary interments (both primaryand secondary), complex architectural modifications, and generally outwardlyfocused altar constructions appear to be represented.At Chab’il Uk’al, a rockshelter located 250 meters east of the Ek Xux sitecore, we uncovered evidence of multiple and likely extended use—probably forpublic rituals—as well as associations between the shelter and ceremonial struc-tures at the surface site. The rockshelter is a low west-facing overhang sur-rounded by large boulders, which gives the site an amphitheatre-like appear-ance, with the hypothetical audience potentially looking into the rocksheltertoward a stone altar (Figure 8.3). When the site was discovered in 1992 by ad-venturers (who were later responsible for its looting), a large, approximately one-meter-high effigy censer was standing atop a stone altar at the back of the rock-shelter, facing outward. The vandals photographed this feature, copies of whichare on file with the Belize Department of Archaeology (Figure 8.4).By the time we investigated the site in 1997, it had been vandalized and thecomplete censer was missing. However, the area was strewn with fragments oflarge cylindrical flanged effigy censers.

However,we discovered that most of the pieces were not present at the site; no completerims, bases, or flanges were represented in the assemblage. This led us to specu-late that either portions of the vessels were removed from the site after they weresmashed, or that the vessels were broken elsewhere and only pieces were placedat the site. Two facts favor the former possibility. First, we know that at leastone complete censer was present at the site prior to its being looted—the onethat was photographed in 1992. Second, the copious amounts of incense residueon the censer fragments and the large amount of partly burned resin found atthe site support the premise that these vessels were utilized then destroyed aspart of activities performed in the cave.We found two fragments of similar censer material in the semilight zone of alarge cave to the west of the site core, and a single fragment in the light zone ofa cave located slightly east of Chab’il Uk’al. We found effigy censer fragmentsin only one of the other twenty-four caves we investigated in the Ek Xux settle-ment area. However, during excavations at Structure 23, a small temple on theeastern margin of the site, we recovered numerous effigy censer fragments simi-"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists203lar to those found at Chab’il Uk’al. Effigy censers were not recovered any otherexcavations at Ek Xux. Interestingly, Structure 23 is the closest nonresidentialbuilding to Chab’il Uk’al, and if the space between the two sites were clearedof vegetation, the rockshelter would be clearly visible.The 125candelerosrecovered from the rockshelter provide another link be-tween Chab’il Uk’al and the surface site materials. While these are occasionallyfound in other caves in the region (as isolated finds), they have never been re-covered in such quantities. However, at Ek Xux Structure 15, a temple buildingassociated with a stela plaza and located at the western edge of the site, we re-covered two caches containing 104candelerosduring excavations. Hence, the twodominant types of artifacts found at Chab’il Uk’al have correlates at the mostcomplex groups at Ek Xux (and not in any other excavated site contexts) and onlyvery limited correlates at other cave sites. It is likely that activities conductedat Chab’il Uk’al were somehow linked to ceremonial activities of political-elitesegments of the community. As Rice (1999) has noted, effigy censers are linkedto the activities of elites in Classic Period contexts. That these activities werepolitical does not preclude them from being shamanic; in fact, some of the ma-terials found at the site, including modified calcite crystals and evidence of theburning of incense, indicate that ritual specialists were involved in activities atChab’il Uk’al (Brady and Prufer 1999).If Chab’il Uk’al was a cave site used for public ritual associated with elite seg-ments of the Ek Xux community, the rockshelter and cave entrance of MayehalXheton, located near Muklebal Tzul, may have had a similar function (see Figure8.2). Like Chab’il Uk’al, Mayehal Xheton is located on the eastern margin ofthe surface site, though about six hundred meters from the site core. Modifica-tions to the rockshelter suggest that activities were focused outward. The cavecan be divided into roughly two general areas: a well-lighted entrance that re-sembles a rockshelter; and a series of dark-zone passages (Figure 8.6). With theexception of one difficult-to-reach upper passage, the rest of the cave has beenlooted, likely since 1992. Looting may have been by the same person or personsresponsible for the looting of rockshelters in the Ek Xux Valley about the sametime.The entrance chamber (Figure 8.7) consists of a series of platforms belowthe entrance to the cave’s dark zone. This area has clearly been looted; the onlyartifacts we recovered were a small collection of sherds, several of which hadalready been disturbed (some were set on rocks outside of the drip line). Theopening has a cathedral-like appearance. Portions of the rockshelter floor havebeen leveled and a series of plastered and painted masonry platform altars faceout toward a series of large limestone outcrops on which an audience could havesat. The largest of the plastered platforms measures6×1.5meters and is 30centimeters high.

Behind the central platform a large rock blocks access to and the view ofthe entrance to the cave’s dark zone. On top of this rock there is a small abstractpetroglyph. Behind this rock a talus slope leads up and into the cave. This slopeat one time had a narrow stairway along one edge, and remnants of that façadeare still intact. This stairway terminates at a series of walls that restrict accessto the entrance to the dark zone.Mayehal Xheton is a complex and interesting cave site. The opening area isvery much like a rockshelter in appearance. The investment of labor in levelingthe floor and constructing the complex plastered and painted platforms atteststo its importance. I would argue that the focus of these platforms was not intothe cave, but outward, toward an audience that could have been seated on theadjacent outcrops. The largest platform abuts a boulder that blocks the view intothe cave from the platform altar, but not that of an audience viewing the entireperformance area. In other words, the platform is like a stage, facing out towardan audience. There is evidence of burning on top of this plastered and paintedplatform, and behind the boulder a layer of ash and carbon thirty centimetersdeep indicates multiple burnings of what was likely incense. One possible sce-nario suggested by this arrangement is of an actor on the platform altar withincense burning behind him or her while others ascend or descend the stairwayleading into the cave, all of which an audience could watch. Displays like thiswere likely intended to impress upon an audience the links between the actorsinvolved and the ancestral beings and Earth Lords who were rooted in the earthand accessed by way of the cave. In all likelihood, these types of displays were ofa political nature, intended to reaffirm the connections between status-holdingindividuals and their legitimating supernatural forces inside the cave (which isitself a metaphorical and physical link between the surface world and the interiorof the earth).Once inside the cave, the entire context and function changes. Spaces in thedark zone of Mayehal Xheton were likely not public areas, and an audienceprobably did not view activities performed there. The focus inside the cave wasbetween the actors and whatever forces they intended to supplicate or make re-quests of.While the focus of activities at Chab’il Uk’al and Mayehal Xheton may belinked to public ceremonial activities, possibly associated with politically domi-nant community segments, activities in other rockshelters suggest a far moremultifaceted role for caves. Mortuary practices at three other rockshelters in theEk Xux Valley appear to have involved nonelite segments of the community,though they may well have been of a public nature. The sites, Mohibal Kanchi,Mayahak Cab Pek, and Saki Tzul all contain multiple interments accompaniedby simple grave furniture (see Figure 8.2). Burials, both primary and secondary,single and multiple, contain males and females of all ages. The pattern of rock-"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"206The Maya Regionshelter mortuary activity at Ek Xux is significant because there is no evidence ofother mortuary activity anywhere at the surface site. Preliminary testing over aperiod of three years failed to find any evidence of burials either in the site coreor in outlying residential structures.This pattern contrasts dramatically with Muklebal Tzul, located less thanthree kilometers to the south, where 20 percent of all residential structures con-tain substructure chambers, and half of those chambers contain burials. It shouldbe noted that, with the exception of one tomb that we found during an excava-tion, we documented all tombs based on the presence of collapsed roof slabs orvisible entrance shafts or doorways. To date, every excavated structure has con-tained at least one tomb. There are likely many more that have not collapsedor that have entrances that are obscured. The excellent vaulted construction ofthe buildings and tombs has likely preserved a large number that have not beenidentified. Further, fewer than ten structures at the site have been looted, andthose that have all contain tombs. Interestingly, while the Ek Xux Valley has atleast four major rockshelters, the valley that circumscribes Muklebal Tzul hasonly one (Mayehal Xheton), and it is devoid of mortuary activity.At Mohibal Kanchi rockshelter, there is evidence of what may be the inter-ment of a family unit. The site is located less than one hundred meters froma series of residential groups, and less than three hundred meters from the sitecore. During the profiling and expansion and salvage of a looter’s pit, we en-countered a male buried face up and fully extended. The secondary burial of achild (around nine years of age) had been carefully placed across his knees. Weoriginally thought the child was also a primary burial until we noted in situ thatthe two humeri had been reversed and the vertebrae were not in their properorder. The skeleton had been carefully arranged to imitate a properly articulatedburial, but with significant misordering of specific bones (Figure 8.8).Kneeling on the shoulders of the male were the flexed, but properly articu-lated, remains of a female in the fetal position. This individual’s head had beenremoved and placed alongside the cranium of the male (Figure 8.9). We foundthe remains of an infant (younger than one year) fifty centimeters to the northof this group. Skeletal pathologies indicate that the two adults led fairly difficultlives, with evidence of arthritis, healed fractures, and degenerative damage totheir spinal columns consistent with carrying very heavy loads (Saul et al. 2002).We found four stingray spines beneath the skull of the male. No other gravegoods were directly associated with the burials, but artifacts found in surround-ing looter’s fill and on the cave surface include carved jaguar (P.onca) canines, acarved limestone polishing stone (likely for polishing plaster),4and a variety offragments of slipped and unslipped Late Classic ceramics.Another rockshelter, Mayahak Cab Pek, is located at the western margins ofthe Ek Xux Valley, 250 meters from the nearest settlement and over 5 kilometers"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists207Figure 8.8.Plan of human burials at Mohibal Kanchi.from the site core. It was used as a cemetery from the Protoclassic through theLate Classic, the entire time Ek Xux was settled. Our excavations at MayahakCab Pek uncovered evidence of three types of mortuary treatment. First, wefound the remains of an adult male, face down, with his articulated head rest-ing in a large Protoclassic Caribal Red, Peten Gloss dish (Figure 8.10). Along-side the cranium and inside the dish, we found the partial remains of a bird egg(genus/species as yet unidentified). The flexed remains of an infant, placed ona bed of rocks, were found slightly to the east of and below the feet of the male;this may have been an earlier, unassociated interment.Second, in another excavation unit, we recovered the primary remains of afemale and an infant. These burials were flexed and interred in a circular pit, thencovered with a layer of heavy rocks. Third, a large subsurface, rock-lined cairncontained hundreds of disarticulated and mixed human bone fragments, repre-senting at least three individuals. At Mayahak Cab Pek, little attention seemsto have been paid to the presence of previous burials when new interments wereundertaken. During the construction of the cairn, the lower limbs of at least twoindividuals buried less than thirty centimeters below the current ground sur-face were cut off. We found a large number of calcite crystals in association withthe burials. Other artifacts found include abundant Late Classic ceramic sherds,primarily bowl and large jar forms, which mirror the types of materials found innearby caves.

Unfortunately, it had been disturbed bylooters, making an assessment of the integrity of the interments impossible. Aspire-lopped conch shell that likely functioned as a horn was recovered from thisfeature. With less than 5 percent of the rockshelter excavated, it seems likelythat we have found only a fraction of the burials and types of interments presentat the site.At Saki Tzul rockshelter, a large overhang located nine hundred meterssoutheast of Ek Xux, investigations have just begun, but are revealing a simi-lar pattern of mortuary use. Multiple subsurface interments, accompanied bysimple, if any, grave goods, are thought to occupy most sheltered areas. We foundhuman skeletal materials across the surface of the shelter, and probing revealedadditional burials. We excavated the complete skeleton of a female whose bodyhad been disturbed by digging activity sometime in antiquity. We found nu-merous bones of other individuals intruded into this burial. There is a strongpossibility that Saki Tzul may have functioned as a mortuary site for the Ek Xuxcommunity.These rockshelter burials are intriguing on a number of levels. Features suchas the cairn at Mayahak Cab Pek, where large amounts of skeletal material rep-resenting numerous individuals were deposited, indicate specialized treatmentof human remains. Such deposits were probably constructed and filled with re-mains in a manner facilitated or conducted by some type of ritual specialist. Thepresence of modified limestone crystals there and in other burials is an indi-cation of the presence of some type of religious practitioner (Brady and Prufer1999). Other contexts, such as the placement of the cranium in a bowl, or a fe-line figurine and stingray spines as grave goods, surely were the result of emiclysignificant activities of a religious nature, though ascribing specific meaning toa category of specialists is not possible. More puzzling is the presence of rock-shelters with multiple burials surrounding Ek Xux while none are present at therockshelter near Muklebal Tzul. Clearly, preferences for mortuary treatment dif-fered between the two communities, with emphasis at Muklebal Tzul placed onthe construction of substructural tombs (which may have been cognitively seenas pseudo-caves) while the residents of Ek Xux preferred to utilize rocksheltersto inter the dead.If publicly utilized caves and rockshelters contain difficult-to-interpret evi-dence of use by elite members of communities or those able to mobilize extensiveresources for site modification or as cemeteries, evidence of dark-zone activity iseven more ambiguous in terms of identifying the role of protagonists who uti-lized these caves. Cave dark zones often contain remains of objects mentionedin the ethnographic and ethnohistorical literature as possessions of shamans in-volved in divination or in the illness and healing complex. Materials such as cutcrystals, wooden benches, disarticulated skeletal material, and organic materials"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"210The Maya Regionsuch as cacao beans and copal incense, have been recovered from the dark zonesof caves in the southern Maya Mountains. While the evidence that these ob-jects were utilized exclusively by shamans is not conclusive, it is worth bearing inmind that cave dark zones are imposing environments, physically dangerous andenvironmentally inhospitable. In addition, cave dark zones are ethnographicallyknown to be feared places, the abode of particular deities and demons, nego-tiation with whom can have perilous effects and is generally left to the devicesof specialists versed in such activities (Gossen 1974:87; Hofling 1991:185–192;Vogt 1969, 1990:122). (For more detailed discussion of why caves are considereddangerous, see Chapter 7, this volume.)The majority of the caves we investigated near Ek Xux and Muklebal Tzulare small and have dark-zone areas. Generally, there are two patterns in the useof these caves. Cave entrances have smallscatters of ceramic materials just insidethe drip line. Dark-zone chambers have evidence of burning and offerings ofcomplete and partial ceramics, organic materials, and lithics. Most of the cavesare small, and the restricted size of many of the interior chambers indicates thatactivities were limited to one or a few individuals. This, coupled with the knowl-edge that those utilizing the caves did not enjoy the luxury of battery-poweredlights, but were likely utilizing hot, smoky torches, probably further speaks tothe restricted nature of dark-zone cave activities. The vast majority of artifactsrecovered from these caves are ceramic offerings, the most common being sherdsof bowls or large jars used for burning incense. These are often accompanied byother ceramic materials such as complete, though empty and often inverted, jarsand complete or partial bowls not used for burning.This pattern is by no means all-inclusive or representative of every cave in thestudy area. There is a good deal of variation, with some dark-zone caves contain-ing unique or unusual artifact assemblages. Near Ek Xux, the Chiue Hix Cavecontained a large number of fragmentary Peten Gloss Ware polychrome platerims. At least twelve vessels, none of which could be reconstructed, were repre-sented, forming the largest class of artifacts in the cave. At nearby RaspaculoCave, a small, dark chamber less than forty centimeters high, the assemblagewas dominated by waxy slipped, thick-walled plain censers. Many of the sherdswere heavily burned, and none could be reconstructed beyond a quarter of theoriginal vessel. While these types of artifact-specific assemblages are not thenorm, they do speak to the individual nature of many cave activities.Certain types of artifacts recovered in dark zones indicate the activities ofshamans, and their contexts in inaccessible dark zones make them unlikely can-didates for association with elite activities. We recovered a carved wooden benchin the dark zone of a difficult-to-access cave located in the Muklebal Tzul Valley.The bench, measuring almost 2 meters × 35 centimeters, was found in asso-ciation with several monochrome vessels showing evidence of incense burning."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists211Two forked wooden sticks of unknown function were embedded in the earthnext to the bench and braced by small rocks at their base. We recovered a similar,but smaller, bench or stool accompanied by a decapitated, but reverently treated,individual from a small mortuary cave outside of this study area (Prufer N.d.).Benches and stools fit well in underworld and shamanic contexts. Figurinesfrom burials at Santa Rita Corozal, Tikal, and Jaina Island depict supernatu-ral individuals seated on small four-legged stools (Chase and Chase 1986:16;Coe 1973:56; Moser 1973:56). A seventeenth-century account from HighlandGuatemala describes a cave where a wooden ‘‘idol’’ was found standing on alow stool surrounded by offerings of food and incense (Gage 1958:281). Ob-jects such as benches likely served both as ‘‘altars’’ on which ritual objects wereplaced and as seats through which powerful individuals could negotiate super-natural relationships with ancestors and underworld deities. Many contempo-rary Mayan groups use tables as household altars. Among the Highland K’iche’,for example, celestial deities are given space on top of the table, while stonesplaced under the table represent the terrestrial deities (D. Tedlock 1985:164).The placement of benches or stools in an underworld setting likely representsa metaphorical model of the universe utilized by specialists, as they are by themodern Maya, and described in extant mythological descriptions, such as thePopul Vuh,where benches are used by deities (D. Tedlock 1985). These types ofobjects are also associated with elite power and the legitimization of divine an-cestry. Benchlike altars are portrayed on Classic Period iconography as the seatsof powerful individuals, and these seats are often depicted as poised between thematerial world and the supernatural realms where ancestors reside (Schele andMiller 1986:112). However, it is likely that, given the nature of these objects asfacilitators of mediation between human and supernatural realms, they were notthe exclusive purview of elites, but instead had a more basic function as part ofshamanic tool kits.Several larger caves have multiple chambers. At Xmuqlebal Xheton Cave,located at the margins of the Muklebal Tzul Valley (see Figure 8.2), we founda large mixed-artifact assemblage, as well as numerous trappings of specializedritual activity, in the dark zone (Figure 8.11). The cave consists of six chamberson three levels and is difficult to access, requiring ropes to negotiate the verticalentrance. The majority of the vessels in the cave were large unslipped jar forms,of which thirty-two were recovered. We found these both as isolated vessels andin clusters. The majority of these were inverted, but of those found upright, fourhad large bowls covering them as lids. Seven were stacked, and, in one case, theywere stacked four high.

The artifact has been radiocarbon datedtoad700 +/-35, calibratedad690–781 (AA36481), making it contemporane-ous with the occupation of Muklebal Tzul. Most Maya depictions of figurinescome from ceramic or monument iconography, where they are clearly shownas the ritual paraphernalia of elites and symbols of status and power, most fre-quently as God K (Coe 1980:254, and Fig. 55; Coggins 1988; Reents-Budet1994:Fig. 1.3). This is not God K, however, and it is likely an ancestral deity orhistorical personage, possibly from the nearby Muklebal Tzul site (Prufer et al.2003). While it may represent an elite individual, it remains that these types ofobjects are also associated with a number of other types of individuals, includingmerchants (Thompson 1970:137) and shamans (Landa 1941:160; Redfield andVilla Rojas 1934:107–109; Roys 1965:xvi; Wisdom 1940:431).

Expanding discussions of the roles of shamanic and inspirationalpractitioners to include political, social, and medical levels can only enhance ourability to interpret observable cave contexts that otherwise might be merely de-scribed as the result of ritual activities. Maya ritual specialists, like their counter-parts in all other societies, were deeply involved in complex social and politicalnetworks that were never static, but subject to change in both motivation andexpression. The remains of these individuals’ activities are manifested differentlyin different contexts. Comprehending the potential dimensions of these mani-festations may help illuminate the deep complexities of Pre-Columbian beliefsystems.While the role of ritual specialists has long been linked to elite institutionsand the fortunes of divine kingship, the presence of shamanic individuals oper-ating outside of mainstream political institutions or at the margins of society hasbeen inadequately discussed in archaeological literature. Caves, however, are thebest context in which to explore the roles of these individuals in ancient Mayasociety. Well-preserved in situ deposits representing the indisputable remainsof ceremonial behaviors allow archaeologists to begin to explore data in termsof what types of ritual protagonists were responsible for their deposition. Com-parative ethnographic, ethnohistorical, epigraphic, and archaeological surface-site data can be more fully utilized as analogical tools when target contexts areclearly defined remains of ritual activities. Overcoming these obstacles is thefirst step in being able to determine who was involved in these activities andwhy.As discussed above, the blending of public and private cave activities is re-flected in rockshelters located near the settlement zone of the ruin Ek Xux.These contain multiple interments with unelaborated grave furniture as well as avariety of artifacts commonly associated with dark-zone cave activities. In somecaves with both large entrances and extensive dark zones, there are clear differ-ences between artifact types found in the semilight zone and those found in thedark zones. These data imply that it may be possible to discern the activities ofat least two types of ritual practitioners. First, those who operated within the"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Shamans, Caves, and the Roles of Ritual Specialists215political hierarchy may have utilized semilighted cave areas as an arena for publicrituals intended potentially to legitimate elite ancestral ties and the sanction ofearth deities; it is likely that some of these individuals were ritual practitioners,elites, or both. Second, some specialists who operated in the dark zones of caves,out of view of the public, may have been individuals not so politically aligned.The dark and dangerous nature of those zones, both physically and in Mayaspatial conceptions, likely made them the purview of specialists involved in theillness and healing complex; material evidence reflects what were likely small,highly private rituals aimed at earth deities for more individuated purposes.A principal point of this discussion has been variability among and betweendifferent types of caves. Further, this chapter asserts that caves were fundamen-tal ritual features in the ancient Maya worldview. Contemporary and historicalaccounts of the role of caves in creation mythology and the afterlife reinforce theconcept that ‘‘nature’’ is a culturally defined term. Caves were not just naturalfeatures worshiped by the Maya—they represented principal avenues for com-munication with venerated deities whose activities were believed to affect allsegments of society. These features were utilized, replicated, and embedded inall aspects of Maya ceremonial life. Ritual specialists mediated the relationshipsbetween earth-focused spiritual forces and society, not just at the level of po-litical authority, but also with regard to the needs and aspirations of non-eliteMaya. Caves represent the principal locations that reinforced the ability of ritualspecialists to negotiate power relationships within communities in a variety ofways. Our ability to interpret the multifaceted dimensions of Pre-Columbianreligions is dependent on our understanding of the potential breadth of the socialactors involved.AcknowledgmentsThis chapter is based partially on fieldwork conducted with the Maya Moun-tains Archaeological Project (MMAP), directed by Peter Dunham, to whom Iam grateful for support.

All the animal crania were disturbed from their original context by the looters,though they can be seen atop a rock in a photograph taken by the looters in 1992. Weobserved that all of the crania (which are friable because of age) displayed what appearedto be kill holes in the right parietal bones, leading us to speculate that they may have beensacrificed or damaged as part of the cave ritual. While other mammal bones were foundin the rockshelter, they do not represent, in total, the remains of the animals whose craniawere recovered. It remains possible, but not likely, that the mammals were the victims ofpredator attacks after the site was abandoned.3.Candeleros,which were likely used for burning incense, have been found at numer-ous sites, including Copan (Willey et al. 1994:214–218).4. Similar limestone blocks were found in a cave in an adjacent valley. The sides ofthese stones, while polished from use, are not smooth enough to have been used to bur-nish pottery. One of the recovered blocks had residues of limestone plaster on its longi-tudinal surface, leading to speculation that they may have functioned to polish plaster.They have also been found at Copan (Willey et al. 1994:242).5. This is a feature not uncommon in Late Classic iconography (Schele and Miller1986:143, 152). While there remains a possibility that the object may be a shield, its posi-tion tucked under the arm matches that of numerous objects depicted on ceramics andmonuments that have been interpreted as fans. Coggins and Ladd (1992:270) note thatone of the figurines recovered from the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichen Itza may be hold-ing a handled fan in the right hand. In Late Classic iconography, a clear image of sucha fan tucked under the arm is shown on the Chama Vase from the University Museumof Philadelphia (Kerr Archive, Vase K-593; see www.famsi.org/kerr).ReferencesAdams, Abigail, and James E.

Because these monuments resemble stelae found in Mayasites, we are applying the term ‘‘stelae,’’ although we recognize that the caveexamples in western Belize are shorter than most surface-site monuments andbear no inscriptions. It is equally important to note that, unlike speleothems,which were sometimes placed in an upright position and rarely modified, thestelae in these caves were produced from either slate or limestone and gener-ally display evidence of modification. The monuments were also erected withinrecessed cave chambers and are accompanied by cultural materials that are as-sociated predominantly with ritual activity. Because stelae are chiefly discoveredwithin the central plazas of major surface sites, and because they are traditionallyassociated with ancient Maya rulership, the occurrence of these monuments insubterranean contexts offers intriguing new data on Pre-Hispanic Maya cave ac-tivity and has important implications for our understanding of Maya cave ritual(Figure 9.1).Archaeological ContextBetween 1992 and 1998, the WBRCP recorded a total of four stelae in threecaves in the western Cayo District of Belize. Two of the monuments were foundin Actun Tunichil Muknal, one in Laberinto de las Tarántulas, and the other inActun Chechem Ha (Awe 1994a, 1994b). Actun Tunichil Muknal and Labe-rinto de las Tarántulas are located approximately 2.5 kilometers from each other(Figure 9.2) in the upper Roaring Creek Valley. Chechem Ha Cave lies approxi-"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"224The Maya Regionmately 20 kilometers to the west of Tunichil Muknal, within a range of lime-stone hills that overlook the western banks of the Macal River (see Figure 9.2).Actun Tunichil MuknalActun Tunichil Muknal (Cave of the Stone Sepulchre) was first discovered,named, and explored by geomorphologist Tom Miller in 1986 (Miller 1989,1990). A British speleological expedition (Marochov and Williams 1991; Rob-erts 1990) visited the site in 1989 and published the first map of the cave systemin 1991 (Figure 9.3). The investigations conducted by the WBRCP began in1993 and continued into the summer of 2000.Actun Tunichil Muknal is approximately five kilometers in length and hasa perennially active stream, which flows through the major cave passage (seeFigure 9.3). The cave has five entrances. From north to south these include theMain and Upper Entrances, the Sinkhole Entrance, and the South Entrance.In addition, the cave is also accessible at its western extremity. The Main (ordownstream) Entrance resembles a double gothic-like archway with a deep bluepool below and serves as the primary access point into the cavern.During the course of archaeological investigations, we identified four majorloci of prehistoric Maya activity in the cave: the Upper Entrance Chamber, theSinkhole Entrance, the Stelae Chamber, and the Main Chamber. The UpperEntrance Chamber contains several small alcoves, one of which has a low ma-sonry platform and is one of only two sections of the cave with cultural materialdating to the Early Classic Period. The Sinkhole Entrance can be divided intotwo sections: a high, narrow, breakdown room; and a series of narrow and inter-connected tunnels and crevices. The latter contain numerous fragments of bro-ken pottery, including some Early Classic material amid a predominantly LateClassic assemblage.The major area of ancient cultural activity in Tunichil Muknal is the MainChamber. This large area lies about 500 meters south of the Main Entrance andis within a high-level passage that splits off from the river passage upstream thenrejoins the streamway about 50 meters to the southwest of the Stelae Cham-ber. The Main Chamber is approximately 350 meters long and about 50 metersat its widest point. Its floor consists of a series of travertine dams that descendgradually toward the eastern entrance of the chamber.The northwestern section of the room is covered with an area of active caveformations amid a series of massive columns. Cultural remains within the MainChamber include more than one hundred whole and fragmented Late ClassicPeriod pottery vessels, severalmetateandmanofragments, small pieces of jade,pyrite plaques from a mosaic mirror, chipped stone tools, and the skeletal re-"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Cave Stelae and Megalithic Monuments in Western Belize225Figure 9.1.The Maya area of western Belize, with major caves and associated surfacesites.

The chamber is 4 to 5 meters wide, 5.3 meterslong, and between 3 and 4 meters high. Except for a slight rise in elevation tothe east, the floor is relatively level (Figure 9.4). Because the eastern edge of thechamber descends almost vertically toward a deep pool, the most feasible accessis a 70-degree climb to the western end of the ledge.We discovered most of the cultural remains in the Stelae Chamber withinthe western half of the ledge. Along the central axis of the chamber are twomonuments (Stelae 1 and 2) that are held in a vertical position by several bro-ken stalagmites and stalactites placed around their base (Figure 9.5). Both stelaewere produced from slate that was likely acquired from the Roaring Creek Riveror from a slate face deep inside the river passage (see Marochov and Williams1991:41).Stela 1 is 1.22 meters high, 22 centimeters wide at base, 30 centimeters wideat center, and tapers to about 11 centimeters at the top (Figure 9.6). The aver-age thickness of the monument is 8 centimeters. Nine carved scallops on eitherside of the stela give it a form that strongly resembles that of a stingray spine. Acomparable analog to Stela 1 from Tunichil Muknal is Sculpture (CPN 15031)from Structure 8L-74 from Copan that, according to Ashmore (1991:209, andFig. 6), was ‘‘interpreted as depicting a stingray-spine bloodletter.’’Stela 2 (Figure 9.7) is 1.10 meters high, 21 centimeters wide at base, 19.5centimeters wide at center, and tapers to 6 centimeters at the top. Thicknessvaries between 6 and 8 centimeters on average. Unlike Stela 1, Stela 2 is notscalloped along the sides, but the top is carved to a point, possibly in an at-tempt to render the monument in a form akin to that of an obsidian bloodletter.Lending some support to this interpretation is the presence of two thin obsidianblades with tapering points (bloodletters) at the base of the monuments (seeFigure 9.4b).Several other cultural remains (Figure 9.8) were found on the floor of thesmall chamber, including a small slate artifact (Figure 9.4F; Figure 9.8f ), a crus-tacean element (Figure 9.4H), and fragments of five, possibly six, pottery vessels(Figure 9.4 A–E; Figure 9.8 a–e).A slate tablet (Figure 9.9) was located 2.33 meters west of Stela 1. It is 25centimeters wide, 52 centimeters long, and averages between 3 and 5 centi-meters in thickness. The top end of one side of the tablet is crudely carvedin the form of a simple face with large fangs across the mouth. The circulareyes and fanged mouth of the carving exhibit features that are characteristic ofChac and Tlaloc-like depictions in Postclassic effigies of these deities (Taube1992:133–136; and personal communication with Awe, 2000).

The other pottery included sherds ofa Cayo Unslipped jar (cf. Gifford 1976) (see Figures 9.4C, 9.8c) and fragmentsof a nearly complete Modeled-carved vase (Figures 9.4E, 9.8e, 9.10) with closeaffinities to vessels from Footprint and Chanona Caves (see Graham et al. 1980).A study of Modeled-carved vessels by Helmke (1999) notes that this ceramictype bears general similarities to Terminal Classic, Pabellon Modeled-carvedpottery from the Petén (Adams 1971:49–51; Sabloff 1975:195–204), but sharesgreater similarities with Terminal Classic/Early Postclassic specimens from theBelize River Valley region.Laberinto de las TarántulasLaberinto de las Tarántulas (Tarantula Cave) is located within a large hill about1 kilometer east of Roaring Creek and approximately 3 kilometers downstreamfrom Actun Tunichil Muknal, 1.7 kilometer north of Actun Yaxteel Ahau, and3.5 kilometers north-northeast of Cahal Uitz Na (see Figure 9.2). A local milpafarmer first brought the presence of the site to the attention of the WBRCPin May 1996, and exploration began shortly thereafter. During the initial re-connaissance, hundreds of arachnids of varying size were encountered in thewinding cave passages, hence the name of the site.Tarantula Cave has two entrances, both located on the western flanks of thehill. The main entrance (Entrance 1) is a small opening about ninety centimetershigh by three meters wide (Figure 9.11). This opening leads into a low domedchamber that is approximately five meters in diameter and three meters at itshighest point. The floor of this entrance room is littered with Late Classic pot-tery fragments and displays substantial evidence of recent human activity (loot-ing).At the southern corner of the entrance room there is a narrow crevice thatdrops sharply downward to a narrow passageway. This passageway then gradu-ally spirals upward until it reaches the Stela Chamber, which is situated abovethe level of the entrance room (see Figure 9.11). The Stela Chamber measures9 meters long (northeast to southwest) by 4.5 meters wide (northwest to south-east). As Helmke et al.

In themiddle of the room, ‘‘the Maya erected dry-laid retaining walls on the easternand western flanks of this pile of breakdown. The walls retain soil and colluviumthat were transported to the chamber to create a level surface atop the pile ofbreakdown. It should be noted that without these architectural modifications itwould have been difficult to erect the stela. Consequently it appears that the re-taining walls were constructed to facilitate the erection of the slate monument’’(Helmke et al. 1999:208).The stela was found lying on its side almost at the center of the floor areaof the small chamber. It is quite possible that the monument was originally setin a vertical position and was only recently dislodged by looters (Figure 9.12).This interpretation is suggested by the presence of a small pile of boulders en-circling a depression at the center of the room, by several chips and flakes of slatethat appear to have been recently broken off the monument, and by widespreadevidence of looting throughout the cave.The stela is 1.06 meters in length, 27 centimeters wide at its base, 36 centi-meters wide at center, and tapers slightly to 23.2 centimeters at the top (Figure9.13). Its average thickness is 3 centimeters, and this is fairly uniform from topto bottom.

This small ceramic assemblage included Roaring Creek Red: Roar-ing Creek Variety, Cayo Unslipped types, and fragments of a Cabrito Cream–polychrome vase, all dating to the Late Classic Spanish Lookout Complex inthe Belize Valley. In front of the pile of rocks that may have originally held thestela in a vertical position we found flecks of charcoal and some ash. Passagesthat lead from the Stela Chamber also contain nine complete and seven partialvessels.Chechem Ha CaveActun Chechem Ha (Cave of the Poisonwood Water, also known as Vaca FallsCave) is a relatively small (approximately 250 meters long) but complex cavelocated on a steep hill on the western bank of the Macal River. With only asmall area in the main tunnel that has active drip-water formations, ChechemHa is also best described as a dry cave. The site was discovered by a local farmerin 1991 and was initially explored by members of the Belize Department of Ar-chaeology and mapped by British spelunkers that same year (Williams 1992). In1996, 1998, and 1999, the WBRCP remapped the cave, excavated several units,and point-plotted all cultural remains within the site (Figure 9.14).The entrance to Chechem Ha is a small 1.5 meter high by 2.5 meters wideopening high on the western face of the hill. Beyond the entrance a high narrowpassage gradually descends into the cave interior until it eventually constrictsinto an impassable tunnel about 245 meters from the entrance. Several alcovesand small chambers are located at different elevations above the floor of the mainpassageway. The Stela Chamber is at the end of a low tunnel (Tunnel 2) thatextends from Chamber 3. Tunnel 2 is initially narrow but then widens slightlybefore dropping sharply downward to the Stela Chamber.The recessed Stela Chamber is approximately 245 meters from the entranceto the cave. The room is 9 meters wide by 15 meters long and more than 20meters high (Figure 9.15). The stela is set in a vertical position at the center ofthe chamber and is encircled by a ring (1.9 meters in diameter) of roughly hewnlimestone blocks (Figure 9.16). In front and along the east side of the stela thereis an upright speleothem approximately 40 centimeters in height (Figure 9.16).A small cavity at the top of the speleothem contains ashes and flecks of charcoal.Unlike the monuments at Tarantula Cave and Tunichil Muknal that were, and"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"234The Maya RegionFigure 9.14.Actun Chechem Ha plan view.

Preliminary analysis of the faunal material has identified re-mains of jaguar, gibnut (paca), tapir, and several birds (Howard Hecker, per-sonal communication with Awe, 1999).Most of the ceramic remains in the Stela Chamber at Chechem Ha are con-centrated along the sides of the room and are predominantly represented by LateClassic jar forms. The caretakers of the cave provided us with fragments of threeeffigy censers, which they reported finding beside the western wall of the cham-ber, approximately three meters from the stela (personal communication withAwe, 1999). These vessels are hollow, cylindrical in form, and have projectingwings or flanges on either side. The front of the censers are modeled to repre-sent faces with large rounded eyes, wide mouths, crooked projecting noses, andappliquéd cruller designs above the nose. These decorative elements are typicalof Terminal Classic (ad700–900) effigy censers depicting the Jaguar God ofthe Underworld and are generally classified as Pedregal Modeled in the Peténand Belize (Adams 1971:57; Awe 1985:263–267; Sabloff 1975:114–116).We discovered cultural remains in addition to the materials in the StelaChamber in practically all other areas of Chechem Ha Cave. Most of these re-mains, however, are concentrated in high, difficult-access alcoves and cham-bers. Along the main passage, about ten meters beyond the entrance, are severalsherds of Savannah Orange and Reforma Incised that suggest that the prehis-toric use of Actun Chechem Ha (or, at least of the cave entrance) may extend asfar back as the Middle Preclassic Period (600–300bc). Farther along the mainpassage there are a few fragmented basal flanged vessels of the Early Classic (ad300–600) Dos Arroyos Orange Polychrome type, and Late Classic (ad700–900) Mount Maloney Black bowls. On Ledge 6, high above the Main Tunnel(Figure 9.14), there is a large unslipped jar containing several small, immaturemaize cobs. Morphological study of the maize revealed that the cobs share nu-merous similarities with species of maize still cultivated in the Maya Lowlands(Morehart 2002:168–172).Two other chambers in the cave contain several large jars (Cayo Unslipped),many of which are covered by inverted Mount Maloney Black bowls. Othervessels in these rooms include shallow dishes that have been identified asBenque Viejo Polychrome and Platon Punctated Incised, both dating to theLate Classic.ComparisonsPrior to this report, there have only been two cursory accounts of ‘‘possible’’stelae in the Maya area. The earliest account was published by Samuel K. Loth-rop in 1924. According to Andrews and Andrews (1975:70; see also Bonor 1989:"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"238The Maya Region154), Lothrop (1924:132–133) ‘‘described a cave at Tancah which had a largenumber of petroglyphs and a crude stela.’’ Unfortunately, none of these authorsprovide a detailed description of the actual monument, and they present onlylimited information about the context in which the stela was discovered. Wetherefore have no information about the size of the stela, its raw material, itslocation within the chamber, or the nature of associated cultural remains.The second account is considerably more informative, but the presence of anactual cave stela may be debatable, since it derives from our interpretation ofdata previously recorded by E. Wyllys Andrews IV. In his description of Balan-kanche Cave in the Yucatán, he (1970:12) reports discovering several artifactsin a section of the site designated as Group IV. The latter was a small domedchamber that represented the ‘‘limit of human penetration in this direction.’’Andrews (1970:12) notes that the offerings in Group IV were ‘‘scattered arounda large slab of rock, which was propped up perpendicularly, apparently to imitatea stalagmite (figs. 7; 47, b). In front of this central slab of stone was a hearth,with several centimeters of charcoal from burnt offerings, including a numberof shell and jade beads.’’While Andrews’s interpretation of the cultural remains in the chamber maybe valid, a close examination of his Figure 7 indicates that the ‘‘slab of rock’’in the room can be more accurately described as a megalithic monument andthat, rather than imitating ‘‘a stalagmite,’’ the monument more likely representsa stela (Figure 9.18). The form of the monument, its erect position at the cen-ter of the room, and the contextual distribution of the associated remains in theGroup IV Chamber all support this interpretation.Apart from the two Yucatán examples, the available literature describes onlyone other possible stone stela or megalithic monument in a Lowland Maya cave.Deep within Naj Tunich, in a passage of extremely difficult access referred toas K’u Multun, Stone (1995:128, and Figs. 5-45, 5-46) reports that explorersdiscovereda stone structure, which appears to have functioned as an altar, accompanied byvotive offerings and a painted inscription (Figure 5-45).The altar consists of a meter-high heap of rocks shoved up against the wall(Figure 5-46). A flat rock lay at the top of the pile, though nothing was on it.Propped up by this mass of rocks is a vertical stone seventy centimeters high.The vertical rock bends and tapers nearly to a point over which the Maya hadhungtwoollarims...Thestonescomprisingthealtarwereinalllikelihoodlaboriously hauled up from the North Passage.Based on the description provided by Stone, we propose that the K’u Multunfeature in Naj Tunich most likely represents a stela/altar complex.

AfterAndrews (1970).portant to note that, like other examples of this possible cave stela/altar complex,the K’u Multun monument is comparable in size to that of Chechem Ha, wasaccompanied by evidence of burning, and was associated with votive offerings.Despite the apparently limited distribution of cave stelae, several other in-vestigators (see, e.g., Brady et al. 1997) have recorded a number of subterra-nean caverns (in western Belize and the Petén) where speleothems could havebeen purposely erected in a manner very similar to that of the monuments de-scribed above. At Petroglyph Cave (about 15 kilometers east of Tunichil Muk-nal; see Figure 9.2), for example, Reents (1980:18) reported the discovery ofa 1.6-meter-long stalagmite that was held upright by numerous small rocks atits base. ‘‘Much pottery, obsidian, carved shell, and ash’’ were found in the fill"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"240The Maya Regionaround the stalagmite (Reents 1980:18). In Te Tun Cave (approximately 5 kilo-meters east of Petroglyph Cave) Bonor and Martínez (1995) discovered a col-umn carved with crude faces above a formation that was modified to resemblean altar. They (1995:257) further suggest that the carved column strongly re-sembles a stela and that the altar could very likely represent a ‘‘Cauac monster.’’At Actun Kabal (about 10 kilometers south of Chechem Ha), McNatt (1996:90) reports the discovery of ‘‘two upright stones about 0.5 m tall and 0.2 mapart, supported by rock rubble. One of these stones was a broken stalagmite.Immediately in front of the uprights was a meter-square area of flat stones.’’ Ina chamber deep within this same cave, Stone (1995:130, and Fig. 9.5-48) notesthat there is a ring of stones that joins an ‘‘altar like structure’’ upon which thereare three speleothems set in vertical positions. A similar arrangement of threevertically set speleothems in association with an altar has been reported in a cavein the Bladen area of southern Belize (Prufer 1995).In southwestern Belize, about fifteen kilometers from Chechem Ha, Rio FrioCave E also contains evidence of a speleothem monument. In his publication ofAnderson’s excavations at Rio Frio, Pendergast (1970:8) reported thatthe principal feature in Rio Frio E apart from the pottery mass is a huge sta-lagmite of unusual shape, almost certainly moved to its present position, pre-sumably from its original growth spot in the cave. The body of the stalagmiteis a somewhat irregular hemisphere, with the flat surface resting on the cavefloor; atop this is a small spherical section, giving the object the appearance ofa seated human figure (Plates 3 and 4). Anderson examined this unusual ob-ject closely during his first visit, and found that there was a row of eight smallcircular depressions down the front, accentuating the effect of a cape cover-ing the body. He also recovered burnt wood, charcoal and sherds coated withcarbonized material from a roughly circular shallow depression in front of the‘‘head.’’Although Anderson interpreted the above speleothem as an idol, it is ouropinion that the figure more likely represents an altar with a monument at itssummit. We would also suggest that the eight circular depressions at the front ofthe figure have little to do with a ‘‘cape,’’ but actually represent crude steps thatlead up the altar to the small monument above. That the spherical section, iden-tified by Anderson as the ‘‘head’’ of the figure, more likely represents a monu-ment is further supported by the discovery of ‘‘burnt wood, charcoal and sherdscoated with carbonized material from a roughly circular shallow depression infront of the ‘head’ ’’ (Pendergast 1970:8). The association of altar/stela/burntofferings appears to be a typical characteristic of the apparent Lowland Mayacave stela tradition suggested in this chapter, and although many idols (mostly"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Cave Stelae and Megalithic Monuments in Western Belize241wooden) have been discovered in caves, it is possible that the Rio Frio Cave Efigure more likely represents a stela/altar complex.As in western Belize, several caves containing speleothem ‘‘monuments’’ havebeen discovered in the eastern region of the Petén Province of Guatemala (seeFigure 9.1). At Naj Tunich, Brady et al. (1992:78, Fig. 3; also Brady et al. 1997)and Stone (1995:130) report the discovery of a restricted-access chamber con-taining an altar with six stalactites set in vertical positions above it. Furthermore,‘‘The open space south of the altar is dominated by a large stalagmite, 1.82 min height’’ (Brady et al. 1992:78). West of Naj Tunich, at the Cueva del Río ElDuende near Dos Pilas, the Petexbatun Regional Cave Surveyfound a segment of stalagmitic column, approximately3mlongand0.5min diameter, lying on its side near the middle of the passage. A search of thearea failed to find the place from which the shaft had originally come, and theweight of the piece ensures that it could not have been moved any great dis-tance by natural forces. It was concluded that the shaft had been moved to thatlocation by the Maya and could have been set vertically at one time, althoughthere is no evidence for the latter. (Brady et al. 1997)Brady et al. (1997:736) also report that in Xetish Cave, which is ‘‘one of themost sacred locations for the Ixil Maya,’’ there is ‘‘a large stalactite set in thecenter of a great stone altar six feet high and 10 feet long.’’While it may be argued that the assumed use of speleothems as monumentsor stelae is questionable, it is important to note that the association is not with-out precedent. This is particularly true when we consider that at Yaxchilan alarge speleothem was, in fact, carved and used as a stela (Tate 1992:132), andseveral other uncarved speleothems are believed to have served as monumentsat the site (Maler 1903:154, 157–158, 179, 183).Despite the Yaxchilan examples, however, the use of speleothems as monu-ments or stelae at either subterranean or surface sites is rare. In contrast, theiruse for practical and nonmonumental purposes is relatively common in the MayaLowlands (see Brady et al. 1997). For example, they have been found carved intofigurines at Downer’s Cave near the Sibun River and in unmodified form withinan axial cache in Ballcourt 3 at Baking Pot (Ferguson 1999; see Figure 9.2).Implications and DiscussionThe recent discovery of the stelae at Actun Tunichil Muknal, Tarantula Cave,and Actun Chechem Ha, the presence of similar monuments within caves in theYucatán, and the possibility that speleothems may have been erected as monu-"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"242The Maya Regionments within some caverns in the Petén and Belize provide intriguing new infor-mation on ancient Maya cave rituals. In order to fully appreciate the significanceof these discoveries, however, there are several crucial questions that need tobe addressed. For example, was the erection of cave stelae temporally sensitive?Are there similarities in the spatial/contextual distribution of these monumentsfrom one site to the other? What kinds of rituals were associated with thesemonuments in caves, and why did the ancient Maya erect them?In regard to the first question, data from western Belize suggest that the ap-parent cave/stela tradition in this subregion of the Maya Lowlands spans theLate Classic to Early Postclassic Periods (ad800–1000). In the Yucatán, specifi-cally at Balankanche, cultural remains associated with the monuments suggesta similar Terminal Classic to Early Postclassic date (ad900–1200). The place-ment of vertically set speleothems in caves is also a contemporaneous (TerminalClassic) activity in both the Petén and Belize, and the speleothem stela (Stela31) at Yaxchilan is believed to be of Late Classic date (Tate 1992:132). The avail-able data, therefore, suggest that the practice of erecting stone and speleothemmonuments in caves was a Late Classic to Early Postclassic tradition in the east-ern Maya Lowlands. It must be noted, however, that the database is limited,and future investigations could very well extend the time frame for this culturalactivity.The contextual distribution of cave monuments also seems to reflect a similarpattern from one site to the other. At Balankanche, the small Group IV Cham-ber, which contains the stela, is very difficult to get to and is one of the tworooms farthest from the entrance (see Andrews 1970:Fig. 2). The same is truefor the stela rooms in Chechem Ha and Tarantula Caves. At Actun TunichilMuknal the Stela Chamber is not the room farthest from the entrance, but thelocation of the ledge high above the streamway and the necessity of travers-ing several deep pools and a complicated breakdown passage before reachingthe monuments clearly demonstrate that accessibility to the Stela Chamber wasboth limited and challenging. Difficulty of access and distance from the entranceare characteristics that are also shared by the rooms with the stone monumentin the K’u Multun chamber in Naj Tunich (Stone 1995:128), by the room withthe six vertically set speleothems in the same cave (Brady et al. 1992), and bythe chamber with the altar and speleothems in Actun Kabal (Stone 1995:130).What kinds of rituals were associated with these monuments? While thisquestion is more difficult to address, a careful examination of the artifacts as-sociated with the monuments can provide important clues to the activities thatwere conducted around them. In front of the monument at Balankanche, An-drews (1970:12) found ‘‘a hearth, with several centimeters of charcoal fromburnt offerings, including a number of shell and jade beads.’’ Within the smallroom there were also about ten large ‘‘Tlaloc effigies, hour-glass censers...a few miniature metates and manos, and a dozen miniature pottery censers.’’"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Cave Stelae and Megalithic Monuments in Western Belize243Additional offerings included ‘‘a variety of Chichen Slate vessels,’’ other un-slipped ceramics, and a ‘‘censer bowl with long hollow handle.’’ At ChechemHa Cave there is a small speleothem with a hollowed-out section containingashes directly in front of the stela. The Tunichil Muknal chamber had two ob-sidian bloodletters and fragments of charcoal at the base of the stela. Around themonuments were also a Molded-carved vase with a glyphic Primary StandardSequence, a carved slate slab with a depiction of Tlaloc, four ceramic dishes,and fragments of a large olla. At Rio Frio Cave E, Anderson (in Pendergast1970:8) found ‘‘burnt wood, charcoal and sherds coated with carbonized ma-terial’’ in the circular depression in front of the upper portion of the speleothem.The stone monument in the K’u Multun chamber in Naj Tunich was associatedwith a large amount of charcoal, several pottery fragments, a piece of unworkedjade, two fragmented ceramic vessels, and a painted Calendar Round date ofad692 (Stone 1995:128–129). According to Stone (1995:128–129),That the Maya performed ceremonies at this altar is evidenced by eight pilesof charcoal found in interstices and depressions within the mass of rocks. Mostof the burning took place toward the top of the heap. The front surface of thetapered vertical stone was smoke-blackened from a fire set behind a small rockresting on the top of the rock pile . . . All available evidence points to the ideathat a ceremony was performed at the altar that included smashing the plate,painting the inscription, and burning small fires on the altar.The presence of charcoal within all the chambers containing monumentsthus suggests that the burning of organic materials was an activity that accom-panied most of the ceremonies conducted before these monuments. Given thelarge number of censers at Balankanche and the censers purportedly found atChechem Ha, it is likely that one of the primary organic materials burned mayhave been incense.Offerings of animals and/or shellfish and human autosacrifice may also haveaccompanied the burning of incense. This is suggested by the animal remainsfrom Chechem Ha, Tarantula Cave, and Balankanche, by the obsidian bladesrecovered at the base of the stelae at Tunichil Muknal and at the base of thePetroglyph Cave speleothem monument, and by the forms of the Tunichil Muk-nal stelae. It is equally possible that the smashed ceramic bowls at TunichilMuknal may have been used for holding bark paper on which blood was col-lected. Iconography depicting this practice is widespread in the Maya Lowlands(particularly at Yaxchilan) (Schele and Miller 1986:175–184) and is believed tohave accompanied most elite rituals. Coincidentally, the carved stalactite stela atYaxchilan depicts ‘‘three figures, two of them standing facing each other, wear-ing the pointed hipcloth and letting blood with inserted penis perforators’’ (Tate1992:132)."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"244The Maya RegionFinally, why did the ancient Maya erect these monuments in caves? In a vol-ume that examines the relationship between Maya iconography and cave ide-ology, Bassie-Sweet (1991:120) suggests that ‘‘Classic Maya stelae that recordPeriod Ending events were erected to commemorate publicly the private orsemiprivate cave rituals of the Period Ending ceremonyafterthis ceremony hadoccurred...[and]theshape of the stela echoes the shape of the stalagmitefound in the cave where the ceremony was performed.’’ Thus, she argues, theerection of stelae at surface sites ‘‘may have been a memorialization of an earlierceremony in which the completion of a calendrical period was marked by thesetting up of a speleothem in a cave’’ (Brady et al. 1997:728).While Bassie-Sweet’s (1991) proposition is certainly intriguing, there are in-herent problems with her hypothesis. If, for example, the erection of Late Clas-sic stelae at surface sites indeed followed the previous erection of speleothems incaves, we should expect the frequency of vertically set speleothems in cave sitesto be relatively high. Unfortunately, this does not appear to be the case, for thereare far more caves reported without vertically set speleothems than with them.Given this limited distribution, Bassie-Sweet’s proposition would perhaps havegreater validity if the practice of erecting these monuments began in the latestages of the Classic Period, not too long before the stela tradition was discon-tinued and many of the sites in the Central Lowlands were abandoned. Thiscould account for the relatively low frequency of stela and speleothem monu-ments in the caves from this area.The stelae reported in this chapter further call into question Bassie-Sweet’sproposed close connection between stelae and speleothems, since the Mayaclearly eschewed the use of immediately available speleothems for slabs of slateand limestone that had to be modified and transported to particular chambers.Hopefully, future investigations will provide additional data that will allow usto more fully address these questions.In contrast to Bassie-Sweet, and in reference to the speleothems in Naj Tu-nich, Actun Kabal, and the possible stela in the K’u Multun chamber in NajTunich, Stone (1995:130) suggests that the vertical thrust of these monumentsis significant because ‘‘the ancient Maya attached notions of sanctity and statusto verticality, evident even in the form of Maya Temples and stelae.’’ Stone(1995:130) adds that ‘‘Maya art usually associates the highest figure in a com-position with the highest rank or with supernatural status...[andthecontem-porary Maya] associate vertically elevated piles of stone with notions of sacred-ness...Thus, the vertical stone of the Naj Tunich altar might be understood asa marker of sacred space; theollarims placed at the summit certainly emphasizethe altar’s vertical thrust.’’We concur with Stone (1995), but, given that caves in general were consid-ered sacred places by the Maya, we suggest that, in addition to demarcatingsacred space, stelae and megalithic monuments may have been erected in par-"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Cave Stelae and Megalithic Monuments in Western Belize245ticular chambers and caves that were exclusively reserved for rituals that wereconducted by individuals of high status.ConclusionsIt was previously assumed that the stela cult and the practice of erecting mega-lithic monuments was an ancient Mesoamerican tradition that was limited toimportant surface sites. The discovery of vertically set monuments in ActunTunichil Muknal, Tarantula Cave, and Actun Chechem Ha in Belize, at Balan-kanche, a cave near Tancah in the Yucatán, and possibly at Naj Tunich, Petén,dispels this notion and suggests that in the eastern subregion of the Maya Low-lands this tradition may have been extended to important subterranean sites.The data from these caverns further suggest that the practice of erecting stelae/monuments in caves was a late development that likely began in the Late Clas-sic Period and continued into the Postclassic Period. The ceremonies conductedbefore these monuments may have included the burning of incense, animal sac-rifice, and bloodletting.Furthermore, we hypothesize that the ancient Maya may have erected thesemonuments and speleothems in caves as a means of marking sacred space andof demarcating chambers that were reserved for rituals performed by people ofhigh status. It is our hope that future investigations will add to the number ofcave sites with stelae/monuments and provide information that will allow us tobetter understand the nature of the ceremonies that were conducted in thesesacred places by the ancient Maya.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank members of the Belize Department of Archaeologyfor granting us permission to conduct research in western Belize and for theircontinued encouragement of our cave research.

Although this fact shouldbe a foregone conclusion, the taphonomic and spatial characteristics of artifactsfound in Mesoamerican caves are rarely analyzed with the goal of discoveringwhat those guiding principles were. This kind of approach, which fits under therubric of ‘‘cognitive archaeology,’’ defined as ‘‘the study of past ways of thoughtas inferred from material remains’’ (Renfrew 1994:3), can be applied produc-tively to the study of artifact distribution in caves in the Maya area. Cave artifactassemblages are end products of a sequence of human actions guided by an ide-ology of space that encompasses caves and the larger landscape (Stone 1995:Chap. 3). The spatial component of the picture is particularly weighty, as cavesare extraordinary kinds of spaces, and from this fundamental truth springs awealth of beliefs and corresponding ritual functions directed toward them.In ancient Mesoamerica, caves were the most impressive enclosed spaces, interms of size and complexity, experienced by the vast majority of people (at least,those who ever visited caves), since Mesoamerican architecture was not overlyconcerned with the creation of large interior spaces with public access. The im-position of conceptual order on cave space must have played a role in the properconduct of ritual and probably was accomplished in a variety of prescribed andinnovative ways. In this chapter, I will attempt to define some ‘‘ways of thought’’that enabled the ritualist to establish order and determined the placement ofofferings, as can be observed in several archaeologically attested situations. I amespecially interested in the placement of offerings in extremely high and lowpositions within Maya caves and how these seemingly anomalous deposits canbe viewed as a symbolic ordering of space. I will argue that spatial ordering wasa tool of agency in the effort to achieve metaphysical balance and thereby assurea positive outcome for the ceremony."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"250The Maya RegionSpatial Primacy in MesoamericaTo approach this idea, it will be necessary to consider certain aspects of phe-nomenological classification which informed Pre-Hispanic thought and whichendure as general operating principles and in specific content (though muchof this has obviously changed) in many modern Mesoamerican communities,making them accessible in ethnographic writing. Hunt (1977:53) remarks onthe astonishing complexity of classification systems in Mesoamerica, particu-larly how taxonomic levels are superimposed to form dense paradigms. Perhapsthe best known of these is the association of cardinal directions and colors withcertain gods, birds, trees, and so on. While the primacy of time as the princi-pal axis of organization is often emphasized, especially for the Maya (see, e.g.,León Portilla 1973), I am concerned with the role of space, which I believe is andwas paramount in the constitution of symbolic structures and the imposition oforder in a ritual setting.Ancient Mesoamerican religion is characterized by the fact that positions inspace and movement through space play an inordinately important role. Thisrole is so complex that it defies general description and possibly could neverbe understood in all of its nuances. The best-known features of what might betermed Mesoamerican cognized spatial models are the static, structural compo-nents made durable in art and architecture, for instance, the well-known cosmicgrid with its horizontal and vertical divisions, color-directional symbolism, andmultiple layers. The importance of this and other spatial schema in Mesoameri-can representational systems cannot be overstated. Pictorially, they are evident inthe near-insistence on spatial frames to situate protagonists and events in explicitlocations (something not found or found only rarely in other Pre-Columbianart traditions). Cognized spatial models frequently underlie the arrangement ofbuildings within architectural complexes or influence the form and iconographyof individual buildings.1Of particular importance are four- and five-part divi-sions, reifying the structure of the universe (Coggins 1980). Quadripartition ismanifest in the fourfold nature of such gods as Tlaloc and Tezcatlipoca, amongthe Aztecs, and the Chaaks among the Maya. Here, spatiality is intrinsic to thedeity’s persona. Quincunxial arrangements, alluding to the four directions plusthe center, are found in some archaeological deposits, such as the five jade headsfound in a Preclassic cache in Structure 6B at Cerros, Belize (Freidel and Schele1988:555ff. and Fig. 7).Even the emphasis placed on toponyms in Maya hieroglyphic writing (Stuartand Houston 1994) is symptomatic of a lococentric mind-set. Many toponymsare supernatural locations and fix protagonists within a mythical but exactingspatial framework. That framework’s precision is evinced in the use of num-bers in the names of supernatural locales, such asna ho chan,‘‘first five sky,’’ and"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"A Cognitive Approach to Artifact Distribution251wak muyal,‘‘six cloud.’’ The numbers both imbue space with a numerologicalpersonality and position it with unerring precision in the cosmic grid.The deeper meaning of this spatial exactitude in Mesoamerican religion andart is not easily grasped, since it is probably grounded in many realms of humanexperience and practice. Obviously, space is an intrinsic property of reality, aswell as a basic ontological category, and one would be hard-pressed to communi-cate without some reference to it. Yet, the peculiar emphasis on spatial referencein Mesoamerican religion suggests that something more fundamental is at stake.It could be argued that space, particularly as it exists in the natural environment,is itself part of the continuum of the sacred which embraces everything in theworld (Sandstrom 1991:Chap. 6). This means that the spatial environment par-takes of the same divine essence as the gods. Indeed, the gods, with their linkageto particular environmental niches, such as caves, cenotes, mountains, and sky,and their cardinal multiplicity, are in some measure anthropomorphic extensionsof sanctified space.Such a belief in the inherent sanctity of space has implications for agency.The dynamic quality of space makes it a vehicle for achieving order and, moreto the point, equilibrium. Creating order means putting things in their properplace. Because this idea flows from universal physical experience (actually mov-ing things in space to create an orderly arrangement), it has universal applicationas a metaphor and is attested in our own expression, ‘‘to put someone in his orher place,’’ meaning to make someone manageable and contrite who has beenunruly—basically, creating order out of chaos. Using the metaphorical propo-sition that order is the manipulation of things in space (including, for our pur-poses, their directional alignment) (Lakoff and Johnson 1980), I would argue asa working hypothesis that creating spatial order had deep epistemological im-plications in Mesoamerican thought and may partly account for the intensity ofspatial referencing described earlier.Establishing spatial order is an underlying theme in Mesoamerican ritual,and detailed knowledge of how to do this is typically the domain of the ritualexpert. One striking contemporary example can be found among the Tz’utuhilof Highland Guatemala (Carlsen and Prechtel 1994:97). In Santiago Atitlánthe curer, oraj k’un,begins the ritual proceedings by addressing in prayer pointsin space around the community, including the twelve sacred mountains. Theyare conceived as occupying a series of concentric rings revolving around San-tiago Atitlán. These locations are addressed in a precise order, beginning witha point on the outer circle, from which a circuit is made in a counterclockwisedirection. The process is repeated, moving in one ring at a time until the curerarrives at the heart of this conceptual universe, Santiago Atitlán. The journeyproceeds through a kind of circular grid, allowing theaj k’unto pay respect to the‘‘entire world,’’ conceived as topographic nodes in a schematically constructed"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"252The Maya Regionenvironment. In this case, both verbal acknowledgment and esoteric knowledgeof the spatial structure is the key to opening up a path of communication to thespirits who will aid in the curing process.Another illuminating contemporary account of spatial ordering and ritual inMesoamerica is Hanks’s description of the Yucatec Mayasaántiguarceremony.Hanks (1984:136) goes so far to say that ‘‘there is not a single type of ceremonyperformed by [Yucatec] shamans that does not embody the directional prin-ciple.’’ This extends, for example, to the directions altars and offerings face, thedirection of bodily movements, whether in processions or scattering gestures,and cosmic directions (both horizontal and vertical) associated with the spiritswho are invoked. Spatial considerations permeate every aspect of the ceremony.The invocation of a series of spirits in thesaántiguarceremony follows a preciseorder based on their native residence in the cosmic structure: first the high onesare invoked, then the low ones. Furthermore, when ah’meninvokes these spirits,they are ‘‘moved’’ in the sense of being ‘‘lowered’’ from heaven to the earth andare ‘‘set up’’ in the four corners. Indeed, the act of prayer,reésar,is virtually syn-onymous with the notion of moving spirits (Hanks 1990:304). Here, too, theritual expert is an agent in creating a kind of situational spatial order for a givenoccasion, which is an index of the enduring order of the universe.Hanks (1984:138) further elucidates the relationship between agency andlocation. In Yucatán, spirits have narrowly defined spheres of influence whichmay extend to particular regions; a god may preside only over the south, for in-stance. As mentioned earlier, spirits also occupy a precise cosmic location, suchas a particular cardinal direction, level of heaven, or physiographic feature. Loca-tion is part of that god’s essence. Thus, it is understandable when in Chan Kom,theh’menutters the name of a cenote to invoke a particular rain god (Redfieldand Villa Rojas 1934:205). For Maya ritual specialists the capacity to effectu-ate change has a logical, systematic relationship with location. Put another way,location is a tool of agency. I would expand on this by saying that the spatialorder created through the performance of ritual is more than a symbolic replica-tion of an ideal cosmic order. Rather, it is motivated by the epistemological basisof causality and serves as a mechanism to influence the course of events. Theritual expert’s imposition of spatial order, whether in speech, visual symbols, orbodily movements, is an instrument for effectuating change.Cognized Spatial Models and CavesThis chapter takes the position that cognized spatial models, which empowerreligious specialists to impose order in ritual contexts, are relevant to the issueof cave artifacts and their location. First, it must be understood that the distri-"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"A Cognitive Approach to Artifact Distribution253Figure 10.1.Late Classic polychrome tripod plate with the entire rim chipped off.

Photograph by George Veni.bution of cave artifacts is neither haphazard nor casual, even though the openarena of a cave may suggest otherwise. Most cave artifacts, like caches foundin architectural contexts, were deposited in a deliberate manner with respect totheir placement and condition, which sometimes have been dramatically altered(Figure 10.1). We must keep in mind, however, that preexisting conditions incaves, such as their potential for flooding, may have, in certain instances, in-fluenced the ultimate choice of where ceremonial objects were deposited. Inaddition, postdepositional disturbance is always suspect. Yet, some caves are suf-ficiently remote to ensure that their archaeological contents have remained rela-tively intact since ancient times and dry enough to obviate the flooding issue.These caves can serve as laboratories for conducting spatial analyses that attemptto understand ritual behavior.Yet, a review of the literature reveals how little has been written about thespatial patterning of artifacts in Maya caves. Some thought has been given tofunctional behavior and natural spatial divisions within a cave, for instance, dif-ferences between the entrance and the tunnel system, which coincide with day-light and dark-zone distinctions. Brady (1989:402) posits that artifact distribu-tion in the dark, interior tunnel system of Naj Tunich reflects a preference forprivate, small-scale activity, seen in the selection of restricted spaces for ritual.The illuminated entrance, on the other hand, may have functioned for more"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"254The Maya Regionpublic kinds of large-scale activities. Like Brady, I have suggested that remote,hidden parts of caves were especially attractive for ritual activity as gauged bythe presence of deeply sequestered cave art (Stone 1995:239). Brady (1989:415)also draws a distinction between wet versus dry areas of Naj Tunich, with thewet areas being special points of attraction for ritual activity. The importance theMaya placed on cave water for ritual usage, as well as for everyday consumption,has long been known (Thompson 1959:124–126).What has been ignored is a functional-spatial analysis based on a more con-ceptual understanding of cave space rather than on the mere identification offunction with the cave’s natural morphology, such as the presence of alcoves orrooms, or its physiography, such as the presence of water. The rationale behindthis type of analysis is that the rooms and alcoves exist; therefore, they wereused because the space was available and perhaps fit requirements of remotenessor aesthetic attraction. However, that some kind of cognitive spatial frameworkwas imposed on caves and that this had something to do with artifact deposi-tion also seems likely in at least some instances. As a comparison, we can look toplacement of artifacts in architectural contexts. These appear to be structured bya cognized spatial system, since buried objects are found in patterned locations,along a central axis, in the corners of buildings, and so forth. Burial crypts, likethe one from Río Azul, where the walls are marked by directional glyphs andeven the intercardinal points are marked (Adams and Robichaux 1992:Fig. 1),show clearly that the space of ceremonial architecture was mediated by con-ceptual spatial schema. I would assert that cave space was symbolically orderedin some fashion and that the artifacts left within were mediated by that order.Furthermore, caves present more extensive spaces than those used for cachesand burials in architecture, making conceptual order even more necessary foreffective functioning. We may also surmise that rituals performed in caves byspecialists, who typically are the most knowledgeable about such things, wereguided by conceptual spatial schema.Approaching spatial issues in this way may not have been attractive to re-searchers in the past, since cave space does not seem to link in an obvious waywith the cardinally oriented grid basic to Mesoamerican cognized spatial sys-tems. I agree that determining actual directionality in the dark zone of a cavewould have been impossible for the ancients, but I would also maintain thatmanipulation of relative spatial positions still allows for this kind of approach.Ethnographic Cognized Spatial ModelsEthnographic cognized spatial models are not all cut from the same cloth andcan express varying sets of terms related in a symbolic network that might bedescribed as a system. Gossen (1974:Fig. 5) has discussed one such cognized"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"A Cognitive Approach to Artifact Distribution255model for the Chamula Tzotzil that paradigmatically aligns time, the state ofthe universe, types of people, genres of discourse, and other phenomena withhorizontal, planar space radiating out from center to periphery.2In his studyof the Maya of western Yucatán, Hanks (1990:86–87) outlines a model whichmaps the human body onto the earth so that the body has different regionsassociated with different winds, just as the larger environment does; this is akind of body-earth metaphor which has implications for perceptions of space(see also Monaghan 1995:98). Something analogous is described for the AtitecoTz’utuhil, what Carlsen and Prechtel (1994:Fig. 4.1) call the ‘‘world as body.’’Here, the body is a microcosm of space and time and also the organizing prin-ciple of the dualities that constitute the wholeness of the universe; thus, theright and the left side of the body paradigmatically align with male and female,day and night, and so forth.Different cognized spatial models can be held simultaneously in a given com-munity without conflict, since they stem from the same basic precepts and gen-erally express transformations of one another. For instance, Hanks (1990:305)also describes a more classic view of cosmic space as a vertically stratified orbwith seven celestial layers, below which are the earth, water, and, at the lowestdepth, fire. The direction up is paradigmatically superimposed with east and isthe direction of the sun, with west, down, the direction of the moon (see Bricker1983; Coggins 1980). Cognized spatial models showing different variations onthe vertical and horizontal structure are described by a number of researchersworking in Maya communities (among them, McGee 1990:61; Redfield andVilla Rojas 1934:205; Vogt 1970:3–4).The more immediate issue of how these cognized models may have struc-tured the spatial component of cave ritual in their respective communities isadmittedly rarely addressed in the ethnographic literature. Alcorn (1984:200)mentions that, among certain Huastec groups, ritualists who visit caves and theirofferings are positioned to face an abysslike drop. Alcoholic libations are pouredat the four corners of the abyss as well as on the offering. Acknowledgment ofthe four corners of the abyss links cave space with the cosmic grid.Of greater interest is the dynamic use of cave space in terms of movementthrough it during the course of a ritual. Evidence suggests that some forms ofMesoamerican cave ritual involve a sequence of stops on a predetermined cir-cuit.3Among the K’iche’, who make pilgrimages to caves manually excavated involcanic ash at the archaeological site of Utatlan (Brady 1991; Brady and Veni1992), rituals proceed along prescribed routes punctuated by stopping pointswhere prayers are recited and incense and candles are burned. As reported byTedlock (1983) and Earle (in Stone 1995:128), these stopping points generallyare at the entrance, the beginning and end of passages, and passage junctures.Anyone who has visited the Utatlan caves, including me, has seen debris frommodern ceremonies accumulated at these points. This arrangement of stopping"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"256The Maya Regionpoints seems to define the boundaries of the cave in its extremes and at thecenter.The question arises as to whether these ritual circuits in caves are Pre-Hispanic or derive from practices associated with behavior in a Catholic church,where the petitioners cross themselves and genuflect at the entrance, walk tothe altar and do the same, and then perhaps proceed to a side altar for anotherprayer; or the kinds of processions associated with Catholic ceremonies, suchas the Stations of the Cross. Carlos Navarrete (personal communication, 1998)has seen a performance of the Stations of the Cross in a cave in a remote partof the Cuchumatan Mountains.If the cave processions are strictly Catholic in origin, they cannot be used asevidence in reconstructing the Pre-Hispanic context. However, before anythingdecisive can be said, more information of an ethnographic and archaeologicalnature should be gathered. Most likely, we are dealing with a cultural phenome-non, namely, making prescribed movements with sequential stopping points aspart of a ritual event carried out in a landscape that has Pre-Columbian rootsbut that has blended with Catholic practices. One look at Landa’s description ofthe complex processional circuits made during the Yucatec New Year ceremonyor Sahagún’s descriptions of certain Aztec ceremonies, which include a seriesof ordered movements in the landscape (Aveni 1991), confirms Pre-Columbianprecedents for this idea (also see Reese-Taylor 2002). García-Zambrano (1994)provides additional early colonial evidence from Central Mexico for ritual pro-cessions in the landscape following Pre-Columbian spatial principles, such ascardinal orientation and the incorporation of sacred topographic features. Pro-cessional activity within caves structured by conceptual spatial schema seemslikely to have been a Pre-Columbian practice.Knab furnishes an ethnographic account that is especially illuminating re-garding movement within caves and cognized spatial models (1991). Althoughhis study concerns Nahua speakers from the Sierra de Puebla (1991:40), he de-scribes a spatial system that emerges out of pan-Mesoamerican ideas and is,therefore, relevant to the issue of Maya caves. Knab’s material concerns healer-diviners, their apprentices, and their use of dreams for curing, all of which in-volve journeys through caves. However, the only activity occurring in physicalcave space is in entrances, where healer-diviners go to pray; the rest of the cavejourney is of a metaphysical nature. Certain caves in the region are seen as en-trances of a particular character—some associated with winds, others with therealm of the dead, and so on—but they all lead to an underworld landscapecalled Talocan (a Nahuat pronunciation of the Nahuatl wordTlalocan) whosespace was highly structured and where the healer’stonal,or life force, needed tojourney to cure disease.Thetonal’s excursions must proceed in an orderly way for it not to perish in"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"A Cognitive Approach to Artifact Distribution257battles with Underworld foes. Thetonalfirst must visit the four sides of Talo-can, which provide a means of emergency escape, before visiting the center, orTalocan Melaw, where the great gods live (Knab 1991:40). The sides and cen-ter are what Knab calls ‘‘determinate places’’ marking the boundary structure ofthe Underworld. Indeterminate places are spatially nebulous and generally com-prise topographic and geological structures: mountains, rivers, plains, as well asunique cave features, such asatet(literally, ‘‘water-stone,’’ a Nahuat term for cal-citic formations), wind places, and the heart of the mountain (Knab 1991:47).Indeterminate places have associated numbers, such as the fourteen rivers; thesenumbers, recited in prayer, provide another means of classifying space (e.g., somenumbers are good, some are associated with heaven).Knab’s study reveals that the healer-diviner’s detailed knowledge of spatialorder, that is, how to move through Talocan, is an instrument of power. The pathof his movement, based on stops at prescribed locations, influences the spiritworld and the success of his venture. We are reminded of the Yucatec situationdescribed by Hanks (1984) in which theh’men’s ordering of space entails a pre-cise sequence of deity invocation, with the deities ‘‘lowered’’ from the sky intocardinal positions; this process essentially collapses a vertical hierarchy of spiritsonto a horizontal plane. Again, the skill of spatial manipulation makes the ritualexpert an effective agent.Knab’s study also provides particularly interesting fodder for speculationabout the role of cognized models of space in caves. He suggests a spatial struc-ture of boundaries, sides, and a center and a conceptual topography with num-bered points of reference, features that do not depend on cardinality per se.These ideas recall an unusual painting in the cave of Tixkuytun in Yucatán(Barrera Rubio and Peraza Lope 1999:Fig. 6; for a color plate, see Stone 1995:Pl. 4). The painting shows ak’ancross with bar and dot numbers (Figure 10.2).One wonders if this enigmatic image might be mapping out a cognized spatialmodel related to the cave, with numbered places in the corners and at the edges.That the painting is on the ceiling, in line with the horizontal plane of the cave,makes this idea even more intriguing.Another cognized model with spatial implications for caves is the so-calledhot-cold system of classification, found in a number of present-day indigenousMesoamerican communities. The hot-cold system appears to have its roots inboth Europe and the New World. Neuenswander and Souder (1977:97) havesuggested that a hot-cold, wet-dry Hippocratic system introduced by the Span-ish was so compatible with a Pre-Hispanic system of classification that the tworeadily fused. Certainly, the hot-cold system as reported in the literature evincesparadigmatic categories consonant with Pre-Hispanic beliefs, such as linkingthe moon with water (Greenberg 1984:172).The hot-cold system is grounded in the concept of an ordered and balanced"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"258The Maya Regionuniverse as a prerequisite for a healthy life. Order manifests itself in the balanceof opposing forces and is essential as much for the human body as for the macro-cosm. A normal, healthy body must be in a state of equilibrium with respect toelements of hot and cold; restoring equilibrium is one of the primary roles ofa religious specialist. Knab (1991:34), for instance, notes that human life de-pends on equilibrium among the three soul forces of the body, and the healermust restore this when it is out of kilter. Similarly, Sandstrom (1991:313) statesthat among contemporary Nahua the source of misfortune is the disruption ofharmony in the universe and that all rituals seek to restore equilibrium in thespirit world.In the hot-cold system, heat ultimately derives from the sun. The category‘‘hot’’ is associated with anything heated by the sun; things that are high, suchas mountains; fire; daytime; liquor; masculinity; strength; aggression; power;sexual activity; social engagement of all sorts, including holding political office;and the colors red and yellow (Neuenswander and Souder 1977:107). Needlessto say, caves fall into the cold category. This puts them in a paradigmatic rela-tionship with things that are wet, cool, dark, low, weak, and feminine, as wellas with water, the moon, nighttime, and the color white (Greenberg 1984:177;Neuenswander and Souder 1977:107). A balance of these classificatory bina-risms is seen in the Mixtec mountain-cave symbol, where the mountain is highand dry and the cave is low and wet; thus, the vertical opposition depicted in thesymbol is in a paradigmatic relationship with the opposition between wet anddry (Figure 10.3).The high-low dyad is a productive classifying principle in the hot-cold sys-tem. Hanks (1984:134) states that for at least one Yucatec ritual expert in hisstudy area, hot and cold were explicitly fused onto a system of high and low,Figure 10.2.Red painting in the caveTixkuytun, Yucatán.

High im-plies order and temporal priority and is inherently good, while low, in the senseof below the earth, the realm of caves, implies chaos, ambiguity, and, at theextreme, evil.Greenberg’s (1984) study of Mam curing practices and the hot-cold systemsheds further light on the high-low opposition set. She describes how Mamritual entails movement through different categories of space to achieve balance,as ‘‘shamans need to marshal the power of both [meaning high-hot and low-cold places] to restore balance in the cosmic order’’ (1984:107). Ritual for theMam typically involves the healer-diviner moving on a processional route fromcold, low places, such as by a river, through liminal doorways, to high places,such as a mountaintop shrine (1984:182). Passing through contrasting spatialcategories in this structured manner can be viewed as a living enactment of theMam’s symbolic transformation of the landscape (Tilley 1999:179). Given theiranalogical associations, caves could certainly constitute a low place in this topo-graphic balancing act.High and Low in Cave Artifact DistributionThe spatial implications of the hot-cold system are interesting for thinkingabout possible cognized spatial models imposed on caves and resultant patternsof artifact distribution. In the hot-cold system, high and low are classificatoryoppositions. The hot-cold system also views high and low as a vehicle for achiev-ing equilibrium. Vertical opposition is especially important in ethnographic ac-counts of curing ceremonies where restoring balance addresses the source of ill-ness.

These heightsand depths are sometimes so extreme that the model of ‘‘readily available space’’does not satisfactorily explain them. One can reasonably surmise that extremevertical positions in caves, whether in deep pits, on high shelves, or in ceiling-level rooms, figured into the performance of rituals in which objects were leftbehind.As a type of ritual action aimed at restoring cosmic equilibrium, the high-low classificatory opposition may have been implemented in a cave by movingthrough extreme positions on a vertical grid. Caves that exhibit high-low pat-terns in the spatial distribution of activity areas could be explained by this model.One case in point is the aforementioned manually excavated Utatlan caves, allthree of which have or had a ceremonial function. This is especially obvious inthe largest cave, Cave 1, which extends under the main plaza of the archaeo-logical site (Figure 10.4). The dating of these caves is problematic, though theycertainly postdate the standing architecture, that is post–ad1400 (Brady andVeni 1992:157). Toward the back of the 68-meter tunnel of Cave 1 is a 7.2-meter pit with a passage extending for 8.8 meters at the bottom (Brady andVeni 1992:160).

I saw on the bottom an old metalcan which had served as a makeshift censer and other debris left behind froma ceremony. It would be instructive to ask some K’iche’ who use this pit—andthe cave is still used as a sacred site—about its significance. Thus far, no onehas ascertained this information. But, certainly, going into the depths, rela-tive to the level of the main passage, holds significance for the present-dayK’iche’.Farther back in time, Naj Tunich offers several examples of what appear tobe a high-low contrast in artifact distribution. One is found in the entrancechamber of Naj Tunich, on the so-called Balcony at the rear of the entrance hall(Stone 1995:Fig. 5-9). On a flat shelf seven meters up on top of a column, JamesBrady (personal communication, 1998) found a small collection of obsidian andpottery sherds. Originally, there were substantial quantities of sherds; however,most had been brought down by modern visitors. The effort to put objects atthat height, which required support, such as a ladder, to reach the shelf, indicatesgreat motivation for some important purpose. I would suggest that someonesought a high place, not to hide the sherds, which would make little sense, sincethey have no intrinsic value, but because of an attempt to perform a balancingact of high and low space in a ritual context.A section of Naj Tunich discovered in 1988 during an expedition I orga-nized illustrates a dramatic high-low contrast. At the back of the main tunnel aceiling-level passage, which we call K’u Multun, was found to contain a roughstone altar and an extensive hieroglyphic inscription on the adjacent wall (Stone1995:Figs. 5-45–5-46). K’u Multun represents a high position, about ten metersabove the Main Tunnel (Figure 10.5). At the back of K’u Multun is a drop thatdescends to the level of the Main Tunnel, although it leads to an entirely differ-ent section, called Naj Tunel (Stone 1995:Fig. 5-2). Here we found a stalagmitewith a short inscription (Stone 1995:Figs. 5-40–5-41).4There is an obvious parallel between the stone altar in K’u Multun, which iswide at the base and topped by a vertical stone, and the stalagmite with inscrip-tion, which is also wide at the base and tapers to a point. The style of writing ofthe stalagmite text is similar to that of the long inscription on the wall of K’uMultun. In other words, it seems possible that the ritual that entailed paintingthe K’u Multun inscription and constructing the altar was part of a sequence ofacts performed by the same people, who descended the shaft to Naj Tunel andpainted the stalagmite. If this is the case, then the two events have a markedcontrast in vertical elevation in terms of an individual’s perception of movingthrough the cave: an ascent to K’u Multun and a descent to Naj Tunel. This canbe explained, according to the proposed model, as deliberate movement throughhigh and low space to enact symbolic order, which, as I have argued, was a featureof rituals seeking metaphysical equilibrium."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"262The Maya RegionFigure 10.5.Cross section of the north end of Naj Tunich, Guatemala, shows thecomplex arrangement of high and low spaces.

From the floor of the cave, onehikes up on a precipitous ridge about 25 meters (Figure 10.6) to an area called theLedge of Offerings, a sloping floor dense with artifacts (see McNatt 1996:87,for a description). At the back of the Ledge of Offerings is a 10-meter-high wallwith footholds which the Maya climbed and continued to ascend in a narrowpassage that wends its way up. We found ollas collecting drip water at variouslevels in this remote upper passage (Stone 1995:Fig. 2-5). The sense of heighthere, particularly climbing up to the Ledge of Offerings, is impressive and musthave had some bearing on the significance of the space. The sense of heightis also tangible in the altar chamber of Hokeb Ha, which is elevated over thecave’s ground-level entrance. Palacio (1977:6) believes that the Classic Mayaentered the altar chamber (where the famous Hokeb Ha Vase was found) froman opening overlooking a sheer 4-meter drop and used a ladder or tree vine forthe ascent.

The vertical dimension was as important as the horizontal in sym-bolically mapping the universe. As Kubler (1985:246) observes, differentiationby height was ‘‘an urgent requirement’’ of the ancient Mesoamerican architect.There can be no doubt that the architect’s keen interest in vertical discrimina-tion, while guided by aesthetic and design choices, was fundamentally an expres-sion of the cosmic spatial grid that was an ordering principle of Mesoamericanreligion.The multifaceted spatial focus of Mesoamerican religion, ritual, and art, Ibelieve, stems from principles of ordering, expressed through utterances, ges-tures, and material objects and intended to act on the spirit world in the hopeof affecting the human world. The urge to order may also have a basis in a per-ception of the external world as the meeting ground for human-supernaturalinteraction, rather than an emphasis on the individual mind as the locus of inter-action, as we find in many Western and Eastern religions. Ordering the space ofthe external world was an instrument for grappling with outside forces. Knowl-edge of spatio-conceptual systems was a tool of agency for certain trained indi-viduals. All of this is pertinent to caves, as they are instrumental spaces in thisquest to influence the spirit world and deal with disease, drought, and otherthreats.Unfortunately, the cognitive models which I have discussed and believe moti-vated the placement of cave artifacts are extremely difficult to verify from ar-chaeological evidence alone. The exposed condition of artifacts in caves, thevariability of cave space as arenas of order, and the likelihood of individual inno-vation in the imposition of order makes such verifications even more formidable.But it is worthwhile to consider these ideas and test them against future dis-coveries. Enough evidence of cave artifacts left in extremely high and low posi-tions has already come to light to establish the presence of a pattern of spatio-ritual behavior and to dismiss the notion that these are anomalous placements.The application of this spatial model to field archaeology has several impli-cations. First, the model demands routine investigation of potential areas of ex-treme vertical placements of artifacts. This may entail technical climbs or theconstruction of bush ladders many meters long. Nevertheless, if this model iscorrect, artifacts will be discovered that may have been overlooked.Second, artifacts found in extreme locations will have to be given greater con-sideration. In the past, isolated finds have often gone unreported, and many areknown only through firsthand experience or anecdotal information.Third, archaeologists should be attentive to positional contrasts of related de-"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"A Cognitive Approach to Artifact Distribution265posits. For instance, parts of the same vessel may be sequestered in two locationswhich are dramatically different on a vertical grid.Finally, to give full consideration to these issues, more imaginative and thor-ough ways of analyzing the spatial distribution of artifacts will have to be sought.Archaeological data recording should attempt to incorporate vertical as well ashorizontal strategies and become more three-dimensional in its presentation.Notes1.

The aim of my research is to demonstrate that by taking a cogni-tive-processual approach, an intensive study of a single site can increase ourknowledge of cave ritual and aid in our understanding of ancient Maya spatialcognition within caves. This new approach (Renfrew and Bahn 1991:431–434;Renfrew and Zubrow 1994:xiii) draws on cognitive, mathematical, and com-puter sciences in an attempt to develop techniques that can be used with ar-chaeological data. Underlying the method is the premise that the archaeologicalrecord was produced by the human mind and was therefore patterned by mentalprocesses.The artifact record clearly demonstrates that caves have been intensely uti-lized throughout Mesoamerica from the Preclassic Period to the ethnographicpresent. All available archaeological, ethnographic, and ethnohistorical evidencesuggests that in the Maya Lowlands, caves were used exclusively for ritual pur-poses (Brady 1989). Cross-culturally, dark zones of caves are useless even fortemporary habitation except in extreme circumstances (Farrand 1985:23) andare used almost exclusively as ritual spaces (Faulkner 1988; Hole and Heizer1965:47). According to Chard (1975:171), most ‘‘caves’’ used for refuge wereactually rockshelters. Particularly in tropical areas, caves are dank and often in-fested with bats and insects, which carry a number of deadly diseases, includinghistoplasmosis, rabies, and Chagas. In his survey of caves in the Maya Lowlands,Brady (1989:5–6) concludes that ‘‘habitation within the dark zone is practicallyinconceivable.’’The ritual context is advantageous to the archaeologist, since it provides aninterpretive paradigm to be used in cave studies. Another advantage is that theformal and repetitive characteristics of ritual behavior facilitate its study in the"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"270The Maya Regionartifact record. As Rappaport (1979:176) observes, ritual is repetitive and mustbe performed in prescribed ways. Although Turner (1982:81) argues for an or-ganic and improvisational aspect of ritual behavior, he proposes that the looserelements operate only within the framework of the formal structure. Vogt (1965)provides ethnographic evidence for the existence of such a framework in theMaya area. He describes a phenomenon in the Tzotzil Maya village of Zina-cantan that he terms ‘‘replication’’: patterned aspects of ritual behavior observedin a variety of contexts, settings, and scales. Therefore, we may expect that arti-fact deposition in ritual contexts will not be haphazard and that some spatialpatterns will reflect repetitive behaviors.In his article on the structure of archaeological data, Aldenderfer (1987:95)describes archaeological ‘‘signatures’’ and defines them as ‘‘unambiguous indi-cators of a behavioral process.’’ Ball (1993:180) adds that signatures are behav-ioral units created by humans whose patterns correlate with group activities thatare represented archaeologically as patterned associations between artifacts andtheir contexts. Ritual behavior is likely to leave signatures due to these formaland repetitive characteristics and should produce identifiable spatial patterns. AsMarcus and Flannery (1994:56) have observed, ‘‘artefacts used in ritual shouldexhibit a pattern of use and discard which is non-random and yields insightsinto the nature of the ritual itself.’’Stone (1997; Chapter 10 here) has suggested that cave ritual may be studiedby examining the spatial patterning of artifacts within caves and comparingthem with spatial models reported by ethnographers and ethnohistorians. Ana-logical arguments that link the ethnographic present to the archaeological pastmay be established using the Direct Historical Approach (Marcus and Flannery1994; Wedel 1938). Despite objections to this method from Kubler (1973), inMesoamerica cultural continuity allows for particularly strong analogical argu-ments. In this case, the success of the argument is largely dependent on (1) thedegree to which it relates to a specific question; (2) the pervasiveness of theethnographic analog over time and space; and (3) the rate of the analog’s knownoccurrence. A commonly occurring referential analog is more likely to be cor-rect partially because of probability. Additionally, if distinct recognizable pat-terns or specific elements of the referential analog can be sufficiently isolated, astrong inference may be made when those patterns or traits are identified in thearchaeological record.This study employs a Geographical information system (GIS) to helpidentify spatial patterns of artifact deposition in the Main Chamber of ActunTunichil Muknal. Patterns are interpreted using strong ethnographic and ethno-historical analogies that are pervasive over time and space. The research dem-onstrates that applying technology to intrasite analyses can enhance our under-standing of ritual practice in caves."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Cluster Concentrations, Boundary Markers, and Ritual Pathways271The SettingThe Western Belize Regional Cave Project (WBRCP), under the direction ofDr. Jaime Awe, has conducted field research at the cave of Actun Tunichil Muk-nal since 1996. The Main Chamber of the site was the area chosen for analysisbecause of its secluded location, which left it undisturbed by looters, and be-cause it was the area most intensively and extensively utilized by the ancientMaya (Moyes and Awe 1998, 1999a, 1999b).A GIS was created for the chamber to facilitate the evaluation of artifactdepositional patterning on a global scale. The advantage of a GIS is that it pro-vides an easily manipulated database, a means of visual display, and a tool for theanalysis of spatially referenced data. The display capabilities allowed the entireMain Chamber to be viewed on a single map, facilitating global assessments ofartifact placement and distribution.Actun Tunichil Muknal (ATM) is located in the Cayo district of Belize ona tributary of the Roaring Creek River (Figure 11.1). It was discovered in 1986by geomorphologist Thomas Miller (Awe et al. 1997; Miller 1989, 1990), whoproduced a map of the cave system (Figure 11.2). The system is composed of afive-kilometer tunnel along which the ancient Maya used several loci. The MainChamber, located in a high-level passage that splits off from the main tunnelsystem five hundred meters from the cave entrance, is the most remote area ofutilization in the system (Moyes and Awe 1998, 1999a, 1999b). The east-facingentrance to the tunnel system is through a keyhole-shaped archway approxi-mately eight meters high that towers over a blue green pool (Figure 11.3).The chamber measures approximately 183 meters in length, 35 meters at itswidest point, and 5 meters at its narrowest. The area encompasses 4,450 squaremeters. It is oriented on an east/west axis that is entered through a squeeze inthe easternmost section of the chamber. The ceramics from the Main Cham-ber were classified using the type-variety system and cross-dated with JamesGifford’s (1976) Barton Ramie collection. They date toad830–950, the Termi-nal Classic Spanish Lookout phase ( Jaime Awe, personal communication, 1997;Moyes 2001).The chamber is composed of a number of rooms and passageways partitionedby large areas of breakdown, stalagmitic columns, and large, isolated boulders.Based on these configurations, the Main Chamber was divided into the follow-ing smaller areas: (1) the Creek; (2) Boot Hill; (3) the Passage; (4) the BurialChamber; (5) the Ransom Chamber; (6) the Cathedral; (7) the Angel’s Room;(8) the West Wall; and(9) the Crystal Sepulcher (Figure 11.4). Some of theseareas were named by previous cavers, and none of the names are intended toreflect Maya thought or traditions.Much of the floor of the Main Chamber consists of a series of rimstone (or"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"272The Maya RegionFigure 11.1.Actun Tunichil Muknal, located in the El Cayo district of Belize on a tributaryof the Roaring Creek River.

The dams create a honeycomb of gour pools that cover the cen-tral portion of the floor area and descend gradually toward the eastern entrance(Moyes 2001; Moyes and Awe 1998, 1999a, 1999b). Initial speculation was thatthe chamber had been dry for quite some time. However, in July of 1997, torren-tial rain caused the chamber to fill with water. Natural drainage began almostimmediately, but some standing pools persisted for three weeks. It is likely thatthe chamber has been wet on and off since ancient times, which would accountfor the thick calcite buildup."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Figure 11.3.Keyhole-shaped entrance of Actun Tunichil Muknal.

In ritual contexts, ceramic vesselswere commonly smashed during ceremonies, and water turbation could not ac-count for their condition. Additionally, ceramic sherds did not exhibit evidenceof water erosion, such as smoothed edges.In some areas, artifacts located on top of rimstone dams were situated in anupright position and had been lightly cemented to the floor by calcite. This in-dicates that, from the time of deposition, water rarely flowed over the dams and,even when this occurred, it was insufficient to cause artifact displacement, muchless, breakage. The combined evidence indicates that water movement was nota major factor in artifact deposition within the chamber.MethodologyPaper maps were produced using tape and compass and were drawn on a scale of1:60 using a two-dimensional top-plan view. A total of 1,408 artifact fragmentswere piece-plotted on one-meter grid squares, which were then entered ontothe base map. The GIS was created from the base map using ESRI software.Maps were digitized using ArcInfo and imported into ArcView 3.1 for analysisand display.Artifact breakage presented a problem in the quantification of the data be-cause from one to thirty fragments could represent a single artifact. While inthe field, ‘‘in situ’’ refitting was undertaken by searching the immediate area forlike fragments. Only ceramic sherds ten centimeters or greater in length werecounted. With few exceptions, these fragments were located within one to twometers of each other. Based on in situ reconstruction, the 1,408 fragments couldbe reduced to a minimum number of 718 discrete objects. The majority of theassemblage consisted of ceramic sherds and speleothems. Speleothems are de-fined as ‘‘any secondary mineral deposit that is formed by water’’ (Gary et al.1972:679); however, in this case, the artifact category is limited to stalactitesand stalagmites.Using the minimum number, ceramics accounted for the majority of the as-semblage (77 percent); followed by speleothems (16 percent); animal remains(4 percent); groundstone objects such asmanos, metates,and celts (2 percent);chipped stone such as obsidian and crystal (1 percent); slate (0.7 percent); and astelalike monument. Nine percent of the assemblage was so encrusted in calcitethat these artifacts were impossible to identify positively.Although this method aided in the quantification of artifacts, artifact pointsdid not provide adequate information for evaluating spatial distributions. First"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"276The Maya Regionof all, it is unclear whether the ancient Maya considered a fragment of an objectto be an offering. This information would greatly influence the way spatial datafrom sacred contexts could be handled. Since researchers have not addressedthis issue, a different way of looking at the data was developed. The alternativemethod does not rely on specific data points as a unit of analysis, but on thespatial distributions of clusters of points.Creating a Cluster Coverage Using GISAn examination of the artifact distribution revealed that, in many cases, arti-facts were deposited in small groups that could provide a unit of measurementindependent of the number of artifact fragments in the cluster. Because likefragments from discrete artifacts tended to be in close spatial proximity to oneanother, they could be encompassed within a single cluster. However, identifi-cation of clusters posed some problems. Although some artifact clusters, suchas those placed in niches (Figure 11.5), were well bounded and easy to iden-tify, others were not. Difficulties arose when evaluating artifact scatters in openspaces, where clustering was more difficult to define. To address this issue, ak-means cluster analysis was conducted to aid in the identification of optimalcluster configurations.The program is a pure locational analysis developed by Kintigh and Ammer-man (1982). It was applied in this context to determine whether specific artifactclasses could be placed into a set of groups based on their pure spatial location.These groups, should they exhibit robust patterning, could then be related tospecific morphological features in the cave. In this research context, this ap-proach is superior to point-pattern methods such as nearest-neighbor analysis.Point-pattern methods are generally concerned with the evaluation of the de-gree to which the individual members of a single artifact class have a tendencyto be distributed randomly across a space, homogeneously, or clumped togetherwith reference only to members of that class (Bailey and Gatrell 1995:75). Whilethese methods are powerful, they assume that the spatial relationship of themembers of that single class of artifacts vis-à-vis one another is intrinsicallymore important than the degree of spatial proximity of those artifacts to mem-bers of a different artifact class.In contrast, pure locational clustering is not specifically concerned with asingle artifact class, but instead with the degree to which members of differentartifact classes are found in close spatial proximity. The content of these clus-ters can then be evaluated to gain insight into past behaviors. This approach hasthe advantage of not weighting a priori any specific artifact class. Instead, themethod seeks to define ‘‘natural’’ groupings of objects across a space. While it is"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Figure 11.5.Ceramic sherds stacked and cached in a group of stalagmites.

The k-means algorithm allocates each point to one of a speci-fied number of clusters and attempts to minimize the global goodness-of-fitmeasures by using the SSE (sum squared error), which is the distance from eachpoint to the centroid of the cluster. Some programs allow the operator to viewplot files of the SSE data in order to determine the number of clusters that pro-duced the best goodness-of-fit configuration, but these programs can handleonly small data sets. In order to handle the large Actun Tunichil Muknal dataset, it was necessary to run the program in SPSS. Unfortunately, SPSS does notgenerate SSE plots, and although SSEs were numerically generated, they wereproduced by using a linear function, which was ill suited for the ATM spatialdata.A new method using GIS functions was developed in order to determine theideal number of clusters to be requested for the k-means analysis. Although oneoption was to estimate the number based on perusal of the data, this was rejectedfor two reasons: first, it would have introduced bias into the data and defeatedthe purpose of numerical clustering; second, not all of the points were well clus-tered, and decisions on the number of clusters present in these areas would havebeen difficult, if not arbitrary. Instead, the aid of another computer program,LDEN (local density analysis) was enlisted.Local density analysis, proposed by Johnson (1976, 1977), is a global measuredesigned to compute densities of artifact classes within a fixed radius of eachpoint. Using thex,yspatial coordinates from the 1,408 artifact fragments gener-ated by the GIS program, an LDEN was conducted on the data. The LDEN wasiterated in 0.25-meter increments beginning at zero and increasing to 3 meters.The program was directed to produce a plot file of the results. The plot file dem-onstrated that the highest local density coefficients of the spatial data occurredat the 0.25-meter radii.Using ArcView, a 0.25-meter buffer was produced surrounding each of the1,408 artifact points, and overlapping buffers were dissolved by the program,which resulted in 252 polygons. The k-means analysis was then initiated usingthe spatial data (x,ycoordinates) from the 1,408 artifact fragments and directedto generate 252 clusters.Before importing the data into ArcView for further analysis, this numberwas tested for goodness of fit. To do this, the cluster number designation of 252was tested against higher- and lower-numbered configurations by examining thecoefficient of variation (CV) ofx,ypoint coordinates within randomly selected"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Cluster Concentrations, Boundary Markers, and Ritual Pathways279clusters from each set. The CV is defined as the ratio of the standard deviationto the mean:CV =sXIt is used to compare variables with unequal means by comparing the relativevariability of a frequency distribution. Relatively less dispersed variables havelower coefficients of variation.To test the CV, k-means cluster configurations were generated for eight vari-ables, including the 252-cluster configuration. The numbers chosen were 240,250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, and 264. Seven numbered clusters from each con-figuration generated by the k-means were chosen at random for analysis. Theywere cluster numbers: 9, 23, 44, 78, 158, 175, and 176. The CVs for thex,ypointcoordinates for each cluster configuration were added and compared. The resultsof this test showed that cluster configuration 252 had the lowest combined CV(.026554), demonstrating less dispersal in the variables and producing the bestgoodness of fit.Using the 252 k-means cluster configuration, a cluster-attribute table wasproduced in ArcView. Each of the 1,408 artifacts was assigned a cluster num-ber between 1 and 252. Numbers were highlighted and graphic polygons werecreated using artifact points as nodes. Clusters contained between 1 and 30 com-ponents.The graphic was converted to a shapefile and imported into ArcInfo. To-pology for the new cluster coverage was built and reintroduced into ArcView.The advantage of building the coverage from artifacts generated by the k-meansas opposed to clusters generated by the GIS program was that the k-meanspolygons were smaller and possessed their own unique irregular shapes, whichincreased the accuracy of spatially driven analyses.Cluster Concentrations, Linear Scatters, and Boundary MarkersIn viewing the artifact clusters there were three identifiable patterns of arti-fact deposition: (1) concentrated clusters; (2) linear distributions; and (3) iso-lated clusters located in peripheral areas (Figure 11.6). Cluster concentrationsoccurred in the eastern and middle sections of the Main Chamber in the areasof the Burial Chamber and Boot Hill. Closely spaced clusters suggested intenseusage in these areas. The Burial Chamber was the area of highest concentrationas evidenced not only by the number of clusters but also by the most variationin artifact classes (Moyes 2001; Moyes and Awe 1998).Linear distributions were defined as multiple clusters of artifacts that fol-"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Figure 11.6.Cluster concentrations, linear distributions, and isolated clusters located inperipheral areas of the Main Chamber of Actun Tunichil Muknal.

Fourlinear distributions are located in the Main Chamber, each associated with oneof the cardinal directions (see Figure 11.6). The first is the eastern pathway. Itcommences just above the tunnel stream and follows the only negotiable pathleading to the entrance of the Boot Hill area. Artifacts located along this routeconsist of jar sherds, dish sherds,metatefragments, speleothems, and an obsidianblade found inside a smashed jar. Charcoal was found on the floor of the routeand inside jar sherds.The next two linear distributions are located in the middle section of theMain Chamber. The northern pathway commences just inside the entrance tothe Ransom Chamber and runs along the south wall of the northernmost area ofthe Main Chamber. The artifact scatter consists of jar sherds and speleothems,and at the terminus of the scatter is a human skeleton.The southern distribution runs along the southernmost wall of the BurialChamber. The route runs between a group of large boulders that creates a par-tition between the Burial Chamber and the Passage. It leads to the remainsof three individuals as well as a dense artifact distribution in the center of thechamber. Charcoal is found scattered along the wall, and the artifact assemblageconsists of a speleothem, an animal bone, and, primarily, jar sherds.The final and most explicit example is the western linear distribution. Theartifact distribution runs along the westernmost wall of the cave over a largearea of breakdown. Located at both termini are human remains; an additionalskeleton was found in the area of breakdown near the route’s center. Carbonscatters and ash lenses are most abundant approaching the area of the Crys-tal Sepulcher. Artifacts found along the route consist of jar sherds and brokenspeleothems as well as special finds, including a smashed shoe-shaped vessel,a carved speleothem bead, a large bowl, and a dish. The artifact distributionacross the breakdown delineates the easiest and, indeed, the only passage acrossthe conglomeration of roof fall that separates the Angel’s Room from the WestWall areas (Moyes 2001; Moyes and Awe 1999a, 1999b).Isolated clusters—the third category of patterning—are located in peripheralareas such as along the outermost walls of the Main Chamber or at the termini ofcrawl spaces or alcoves. Seven clusters of this type were identified (Figure 11.7).Each cluster consists of a single artifact. Of these, three are smashed and fourare almost intact.The group of artifacts located farthest from the cave entrance provides themost dramatic example of an isolated cluster (see Figure 11.2). A small subsid-iary tunnel accessed through the Crystal Sepulcher originates at the west end ofthe Main Chamber and eventually rejoins the river. This tunnel is almost devoidof artifacts, except for a small cluster of speleothems and the sherds of three jars.Isolated cluster 1 (I1 on Figure 11.7), located at the terminus where the passage"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"282The Maya RegionFigure 11.7.Isolated clusters in the Main Chamber of Actun Tunichil Muknal.rejoins the main tunnel system, is a single jar sherd containing a charcoal placedon a clay mound (Michael Mirro, 1998, personal communication).Isolated cluster 2 (I2) is located in the northwest part of the Main Chamberin a small room adjacent to the Angel’s Room.

It is located high above the floor of the Main Chamber andconsists of approximately three-quarters of an unslipped jar smashed into threefragments. The sherds contain a scatter of charcoal and ash.In an area of breakdown east of the Cathedral, located approximately sixmeters above the Main Chamber floor, is isolated cluster 4 (I4). The artifact isa single, intact shoe-shaped vessel placed within a group of stalagmites (Figure11.9). Isolated cluster 5 (I5), a hollow bone tube, is located in a flat sandy area13.5 meters east of I4, near the northernmost wall of the cave. The tube was fash-ioned from an animal long bone and is 8.1 centimeters long and 1.5 centimetersin diameter. One end is smoothed and the other is fractured.Isolated cluster 6 (I6) is located in the Boot Hill area along the southernmostwall of the cave. The artifact is a red-slipped bowl situated on a shelf high abovethe floor of the chamber near the cave ceiling. The last example is I7, locatedin the area of the Creek. Placed against the cave wall at the entrance to a smallalcove is half of a wide-necked, unslipped jar.Although some isolated clusters were located in areas of high elevation, otherswere not. This pattern of deposition seems to indicate that the remote positionFigure 11.9.Isolated cluster I4, an intactshoe-shaped vessel placed within a groupof stalagmites.

The placement of artifacts at a high elevation is coincidental withthe cave walls’ upward curve along the periphery. The pattern of these periph-erally placed artifacts does not suggest that intense activity occurred in theseareas.Models of Ritual Space and Artifact PatterningThe Quincuncial ModelYears ago, Eliade recognized that, cross-culturally, the world is perceived as hav-ing a center or navel from which extend four horizons projected in the four car-dinal directions. He referred to this square constructed from a central point as an‘‘imago mundi’’ (Eliade 1959:42–45). According to Eliade (1959:45), this para-digmatic cosmological model becomes ‘‘the archetype of every creative humangesture, whatever its plane of reference may be.’’ Encountering this spatial modelover time and space throughout Mesoamerica should not be surprising. Evi-dence for its presence among the Pre-Columbian Maya can be found in theCodex Madrid, in the layout of tombs at Río Azul (Adams and Robichaux1992:412), and in site construction typified by the twin pyramid complexes atTikal (Ashmore 1991:201).Ethnographers report that the earth is thought of as a four-sided, horizontalflat plane that sits beneath the overarching dome of the sky (Gossen 1974:34;Holland 1963; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962:114; Sosa 1985:417–423; Vogt1976:13). In one of the most well recognized models, Gossen (1974:34) illus-trates that the sun was thought to move in a vertical circular pattern around theflat earth plane. The sun’s rising and setting on summer and winter solstices de-lineated the four corners of the plane, and its zenith and nadir marked the centerof the square-earth model.Much of our ethnographic knowledge of Maya spatial cognition also comesfrom the work of Hanks (1984, 1990) and Sosa (1985), who both worked amongthe Maya in Yucatán. They recognized that the directional principle was thecognitive spatial model at the heart of ceremonies performed by shamans andnote that among the contemporary Maya, the quincuncial model is the basicspatial model used in ritual.Hanks (1990:299–302) dichotomizes the sacred and the profane use of direc-tionality by differentiating between cardinal ‘‘directions’’ and cardinal ‘‘places.’’Cardinal directions constitute ‘‘an abstract coordinate system, presumably fixedby features of the natural environment (terrestrial and celestial), relative to whichany actor can orient himself or any other object’’; cardinal places serve to define"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Cluster Concentrations, Boundary Markers, and Ritual Pathways285a schematic totality of spatial zones. Cardinal places used in ritual discourse maybe thought of as representing ‘‘miniuniverses.’’ They are conceptualized as a cen-tral point surrounded by a four-sided polygonal structure whose sides are createdby joining the four intercardinal points.This concept, described as a ‘‘frame’’ by Douglas (1966:63–64), dividesreality, both temporally and spatially, between that which is within the frameand that which is outside it. In Hanks’s model, the frame represents a totalizedspace conforming to any scale, from a household altar to a milpa to a communityto the entire cosmos. Although the earth itself is described in terms of the frame,in practical usage, a frame can also represent a ‘‘minicosmos’’ at a smaller scale.Therefore, the frame may be nested within progressively larger social spaces inthe way that a Chinese box may open into another and another.Hanks’s work is instrumental in providing an understanding of the purposeof the frame. Through shamanic discourse that invokes the cardinal directions,spirits are brought down from their celestial realm in a procedure referred to as‘‘binding the altar’’ (Hanks 1990:336–337). At the culmination of a ceremony,they are sent back to their spiritual abode, and the altar is said to be ‘‘untied.’’Sosa (1985:470–471) notes that the ‘‘tying,’’ or binding, of ritual space is mod-eled after the Maya understanding of the cosmological order and references thesun delimiting the boundaries of the cosmos in its daily circuit around the earth.Hanks points out that binding of the altar is best thought of as creating asecure place. He explains that the ‘‘altar is secured in the sense that spirits arebound to absolute locations around it, at once protecting the shaman from at-tack by any marauding spirits in the area and also preventing the lowered spiritsthemselves from wandering around’’ (1990:337). Even fully beneficent spiritscan cause damage when loosed, and the protective procedure creates a zone ofspiritual safety so that powerful beings may be manipulated. Hanks (1990:349)summarily states: ‘‘Without its perimeter, a place has no unity and is potentiallydangerous. The frame may have the same protective quality when operating ona larger spatial scale at the community level. Barbara Tedlock (1992:82) reportsthat at Los Cipréses in Highland Guatemala the priest-shaman makes a four-part pilgrimage to the mountains surrounding the town. This ritual circuit isreferred to as either the ‘‘sewing and the planting’’ or the ‘‘stabilization’’ of thecommunity. The latter is a metaphor for the firm placing of a table on its fourlegs so that it will not wobble or tip over in times of natural or other disasters.At the village of Chan Kom in Yucatán, during theloh(meaning ‘‘redeem’’or ‘‘free’’), a curing ceremony, the participants traverse a ritual circuit to each ofthe four entrances of the village and at each point bury crosses, obsidian, andsalt in the road in order to prevent evil winds. Afterward, they proceed to thecenote to throw in thirteen wooden crosses so that ‘‘the winds [will] not comeout of it again’’ (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1962:176). Sosa (1985:343, 344, 451,"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"286The Maya Region452) describes the similarloh kàahritual in the town of Yalcoba, but adds that itis a nighttime ceremony to propitiate the cave-dwelling deity Yum Baláam, whoprotects the populace from evil winds that cause disease. This guardian possessesfour aspects that correspond to the corners of a quadrilateral structure. Duringcuring ceremonies, oneh’men(priest-shaman) walks a ritual circuit encompass-ing the community and leaves offerings at the corners while another remains atthe centrally located church.Hanks (1990:345) reports that in the ‘‘fixed earth’’ ceremony, a household ritedesigned to drive away a malignant spirit, the yard is spatially bound, or ‘‘lockedin,’’ by traversing its perimeter and ‘‘putting in’’ guardian spirits by showingthem their ‘‘boundary stones.’’ A similar pattern of perimeter definition occursin ceremonies for the laying out of a milpa. The perimeter is always cut first,prayers for protection from snakes proffered, and, finally, offerings left at thefour cardinal points and the center (Hanks 1990:362–364).Awe and I (Moyes and Awe 1999a, 1999b) have suggested that the four linearscatters established inside of the Main Chamber are analogous to ritual path-ways described by ethnographers. Viewed collectively, the pathways correspondquite literally to the four cardinal directions (see Figure 11.6). However, for thisto correlate with the Maya frame representing the layout of the cosmos, a centralfeature is required. Using GIS to view the chamber, the centrally located arti-facts were examined. In the center of the Burial Chamber was a stack of threemodified speleothems. I have argued elsewhere (Moyes 2000, 2001) that the3-speleothem-cluster completes the fifth central element of the quincuncialframe by representing the 3-Stone-Hearth or axis mundi (see Figure 11.6).Freidel et al. (1993:68–93) suggest that hearths often represent the centralfeature in Maya cosmograms, particularly the 3-Stone-Hearth associated withthe 4 Ahau 8 Kumk’u creation event of 3114bc. Taube (1998:427–432) drawsan analogy between Maya household architecture, in which the hearth is thecentral feature, and the architectural configuration of temple structures as ‘‘godhouses.’’ As with Maya houses, four posts support the roof of temples, and thecenter is the 3-Stone-Hearth, which represents both a place of creation and axismundi connecting the sky, the earth, and the Underworld.This analogy may be extended to caves, since they are thought of as houses ofdeities, particularly rain gods (Guiteras-Holmes 1961:153, 281; Holland 1963:93; Nash 1970:141; Reina 1966:181–182; Thompson 1970:267–268; Toor 1947:473), and ancestral spirits (La Farge 1947:127–128; Nash 1970:19, 45; Thomp-son 1970:314, 316; Vogt 1970:6). Stone (1995:35–36) argues, using linguisticevidence, that caves are thought to be houselike structures. This agrees well withLas Casas, who noted centuries ago that the Maya word for ‘‘temple’’ was alsoused for ‘‘cave’’ (cited in Thompson 1959:122).The 3-speleothem-cluster located in the Main Chamber is notable because"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Cluster Concentrations, Boundary Markers, and Ritual Pathways287of its odd configuration of deposition. There is a high degree of confidencethat the stones are in their original context because they have been firmly ce-mented to the floor with calcite. The three speleothems are stacked togetherwith two on the bottom of the stack and the third on top. Taube (1998:433)notes this specific arrangement in epigraphic representations of the 3-Stone-Hearth (Figure 11.10). Of the 116 speleothems deposited in the Main Cham-ber, this is the only instance of this particular configuration. Additionally, theclustered speleothems were modified from their natural cone shapes to a morerounded appearance, closely resembling hearthstones.Taube (1998:431–440) has identified iconographic elements that accompany3-Stone-Hearth imagery: centrality, jaguars, fire, and water. Each of these ele-ments is present in association with the 3-speleothem-cluster. First, the clusteris absolutely central not only to the Burial Chamber, where it is located, but, ona larger spatial scale, to the Main Chamber itself. Besides this element of cen-trality, the element of jaguars is also present. A small-scale detail map of theimmediate area illustrates the provenience of two jaguar bones—a pelvis and ametatarsal—found in a cache located within five meters of the three-speleothemcluster (Figure 11.11).Evidence of burning in the 3-Stone-Hearth symbolism would be expectedas well. Although large areas of charcoal scatters are present along the walls ofthe Burial Chamber, any carbonized material located among the rimstone damsat the center would have floated away or been covered by flowstone. There is,however, some evidence of previous burning, since the speleothem on the topof the stack exhibits charring (see Figure 11.10).The element of water is represented by the wet nature of the chamber itself,as evidenced by the intermittent pools formed by the rimstone dams coveringthe floor. Additionally, the three ‘‘hearthstones’’ were constructed from speleo-thems. Lexical evidence suggests that the Maya were cognizant, at least empiri-cally, of the process of speleothem formation in which water was converted intostone. The Yucatec word for speleothem isxix ha tunich,or ‘‘drip-water stone’’(Barrera Vásquez 1980:946).In his summary of Maya cave use, Thompson (1959:124–127, in Mercer1975:xv–xxii) suggests that, among the Maya, jars found in caves were meantfor the collection ofzuhuy ha,or ‘‘virgin water,’’ to be used in rituals. In a per-sonal communication (2000), Barbara Tedlock suggests that the correct spell-ing issuhuy,which translates as ‘‘pure,’’ as opposed to ‘‘virgin.’’ Barrera Vásquez(1980:741) definessuhuy haa’in Yucatec as water springing from a hole. Accord-ing to Tedlock, in practice, this becomes water that is caught, such as rainwateror dew, or that comes from a spring. Water from the center of the source is par-ticularly desirable for ritual purposes, since water from the banks or edges ofthe source is considered to be polluted.

Theconcept is also present in Central Mexico. Aramoni (1990; also see Chapter 2here) notes that in Tzinacapan, water coming from caves in the area is believedto be pure because it originated in the Underworld.The creation of stone from dripping virgin water would likely imbue speleo-thems with special meaning, as Brady et al. (1997:725) have suggested. Thisimplies that the 3-speleothem-cluster in the Main Chamber represents specialhearthstones fashioned from pure water.

Early colonialdictionaries, the Chilam Balam of Chumayel, and the Chilam Balam of Kauaall make reference to, or show maps of, a circular earth model. Taube also pointsout that in Pre-Hispanic Central Mexico, the circular earth could be character-ized by a round, flat mirror or a round calendar stone. A round, globular turtlecould also represent the circular earth, as evidenced by the Late Postclassic stonetortoise altar figures discovered at Mayapán or in Classic Period depictions ofthe Maize God rising from a cleft in a turtle carapace found in Maya iconog-raphy. Taube (1988b) has suggested that turtles also represent time/space modelssignifying the twenty-yearkatuncycles in Postclassic Yucatán.In both contemporary and colonial representations of the circular world, across or axis divides the circle into quadrants (Taube 1988a:168). Evidence sug-gests that this was an ancient cosmological construct as well. An Esperanzaphase bowl depicting turtles with crosses on their backs was found in TombA-VI at Kaminaljuyu (Kidder et al. 1946:185). Additionally, pecked designsillustrating two concentric circles divided into quadrants by crossed lines werefound at both Teotihuacan (Aveni 2000; Aveni et al. 1978) and Uaxactun (Smith1950:21–22, Fig. 15a). It has been suggested that these are time/space models"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Cluster Concentrations, Boundary Markers, and Ritual Pathways291that correlate calendrical cycles with astronomical events (Aveni 2000; Broda2000).More than one spatial model may operate simultaneously, however. For in-stance, both the circular and the quadrilateral worlds were referenced in ritualsthat established community boundaries. In his study of ethnohistorical docu-ments, García-Zambrano (1994) points out that, to establish communities, theZapotec, the Maya, the Mixtec, the Tarascans, and the Otomí conducted foun-dation rituals to establish or reestablish territorial boundaries. According toGarcía-Zambrano (1994:220), the outward meaning of the ceremonies was toerect a ‘‘mini-cosmos’’ through ritual. The minicosmos was represented as anabstract time/space model of the universe in the form of a square within a circle.The circle represented time and the square, space.This complex of rituals began with the identification of five mountains. Fourwere considered the periphery of the community, and the fifth, along with itswater hole, became the center. From the central mountain, a group carryingropes constructed of boughs and grasses that enclosed the space beat the bound-aries of the new community, establishing borders along community perimeters.Although the visual referents for the demarcation of the boundaries formed asquare with the four cardinal mountains, the procession followed a circular pat-tern. This pattern of movement agrees well with Gossen’s (1974:34) model ofthe cosmos in which ritual circuits are depicted as moving in an oval pattern.Following the beating of the boundaries, the group moved to the top of thecentral mountain, where two additional ceremonies occurred. A smaller circle ofboughs, mirroring the larger circle used to mark the peripheries, was constructed(Alva Ixtlilxóchitl 1975:220). This was set on fire to sacralize the center and topromote the transit of the sun through the sky. Following this event, arrows wereshot to the four cardinal directions. The arrows marked the territorial bound-aries and divided the land into quadrants. This ritual enactment incorporatedboth quincuncial and circular patterns. The resulting spatial pattern was mod-eled by García-Zambrano (1994:220, Fig. 3) as a set of squares encompassedby a circle (Figure 11.13).García-Zambrano’s model agrees well with Hanks’s (1990:350) observationthat, among the Yucatec Maya, there is interplay between round and quadri-lateral space in cosmological models. Hanks’s informant provided a drawingof a cross section of his conceptual universe, which illustrated the earth as aquadrilateral flat plane inside a sphere (1990:305, Fig. 7.3). Similarly, Holland(1963:14–15), working in San Andrés Larrainzar, describes a model in whichthe sky is thought of as a cup over the flat earth. Viewed from above in twodimensions, these circular sky–flat earth models would look like a square earthcontained within a circle, strongly resembling the model of foundation ritualsreported by García-Zambrano."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"292The Maya RegionFigure 11.13.Ritual pathways, three-speleothem-cluster, and boundary markers in theMain Chamber of Actun Tunichil juxtaposed with García-Zambrano’s illustration of thespatial model of foundation rituals.

In the study of material culture,it is the manifestation of that behavior in the artifact record that is of interest.Although Hanks’s model of cardinal places emphasizes the intercardinal pointsas the corners of the spatial frame, García-Zambrano emphasizes the cardinal"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Cluster Concentrations, Boundary Markers, and Ritual Pathways293points. However, in terms of behavior, they are in agreement, since, in foun-dation rituals, the ‘‘arrowing,’’ or ritual marking, of the cardinal directions isdirected to the intercardinal points, just as the Maya priest-shaman uses themto establish cardinal places.As a part of foundation rituals, stone markers and/or stelae were set alongborders to provide permanent boundary designations. These provided an endur-ing visual representation of the community boundaries to warn trespassers thatthey would not be tolerated (García-Zambrano 1994:219). Hanks (1990:356)reports a similar type of boundary marking in the modern community of Ox-kutzcab. Several major boundaries separate the community from its neighborsand are marked with stone mounds. The markers are thought to have beenplaced in the woods by foreigners, wealthy men, or the town and may also de-lineate the property lines of wealthy ranch owners. They define the permanentlimits beyond which one cannot go when choosing land for milpas. Anyone whocrosses these markers is denounced.Hanks (1990:388–389) also points out that, among the Maya, every spacehas ayùumil,or ‘‘lord owner.’’ This concept includes all space from the expanseof the cosmos to the ownership of land. Not only do spaces have owners, butowners have spaces both in the corporal and the spiritual realms. This plays acentral role in shamanic practice, particularly in the effort of the priest-shamanto keep spirits from wandering.Marking of boundaries is also present in Zinacantecan K’in Krus rites orwater-hole ceremonies reported by Vogt (1969:690–695; 1976:111–115). Theserenewal rites encircle the culturally utilized parts of the local environment as-sociated with particular lineage groups in order to compensate the Earth Lordfor the use of natural resources (Vogt 1976:114). Features of the natural land-scape, such as caves, water holes, and rocks, as well as local officials’ house-crossshrines, determine ritual stations. Offerings are given to the Earth Lord at sta-tions constrained by geographical landmarks. As Vogt (1969:391) suggests, thedefinition of territorial geographic space is an important feature of Maya spatialcognition.The placement of the seven isolated clusters in the Main Chamber (see Fig-ure 11.7) does not correspond to the quincuncial model that is so often usedin Maya ritual. Their position along the outside walls of the chamber (I2–I6)and in areas where further access is terminated (I1, I7) suggests that these arti-facts are boundary markers. Their location along the natural perimeters of theMain Chamber appears to enclose the frame created by linear scatters and cre-ates a configuration similar to that reported for foundation rituals. A comparisonbetween illustrations of the cluster patterns found in the Main Chamber andGarcía-Zambrano’s spatial model illustrates the similarities between the uses ofspace in both instances (see Figure 11.13). I suggest that the placement of arti-"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"294The Maya Regionfacts along peripheral boundaries within the cave interior represents the delinea-tion of social space and is analogous to the beating of boundaries in foundationrites or K’in Krus renewal rituals. Although stone markers were used to reifyboundaries in foundation rituals, artifact deposits appear to have been substi-tuted to mark cave perimeters permanently.ConclusionsGeographic information systems have most frequently been employed in ar-chaeological studies for large-scale regional analyses and predictive modeling ofsettlement patterns and land use, but the potential of GIS as a tool for the orga-nization and analysis of spatial data within a single site has hardly been explored.The use of a GIS in Actun Tunichil Muknal demonstrates that it is a powerfultool for the mapping and display of cave interiors. The GIS was vital in detectingglobal artifact patterns and made it possible to compare artifact patterns locatedwithin the cave to ethnographic spatial models.Strong analogies can be drawn from numerous ethnographic and ethnohis-torical studies of Maya ritual behavior patterns and can be used to explore thearchaeological record. They demonstrate the pervasive use of the quincuncialtemplate that references the creation of the cosmos. Although models of thecosmos made by the Maya themselves are commonly based on a quincuncialstructure, they may be elaborated in more complex spatial models that utilizetime/space/sky configurations in which the four-sided model is encircled.In this chapter I have examined depositional patterns of artifacts from theMain Chamber of the cave. The analysis demonstrates that artifact pattern-ing corresponds to García-Zambrano’s spatial model of foundation rites. As anexpression of the basic quincuncial model, linear scatters of artifacts representritual pathways that correspond to the four cardinal directions. The central fea-ture of the model is marked by the 3-speleothem-cluster at the center of thechamber, which I argue represents the 3-Stone-Hearth at the center of the cos-mos in Maya belief. Artifact deposits located in isolated areas function as bound-ary markers that express the encircling configuration. These data suggest thatestablishing boundaries was an important means of ritually defining a safe socialspace within the cave.AcknowledgmentsFirst and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to Jaime Awe, directorof the Western Belize Regional Cave Project, who has provided innumerable"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Cluster Concentrations, Boundary Markers, and Ritual Pathways295insights and has been continually supportive of my work.

This chapter presentswork with rural Q’eqchi’ Maya and others whose ritual is centered on sacredsites known as the Tzuultaq’a (literally, ‘‘Mountain-Valley,’’ not ‘‘god’’ or simply‘‘mountain’’). We draw primarily from fieldwork among contemporary subsis-tence agriculturalists of San Juan Chamelco in highland Alta Verapaz, whereAdams, a cultural anthropologist, has carried out research since 1991, includingjoint research in 1993 with Brady. This chapter also incorporates observationsby Brady, an archaeologist specializing in Maya cave use, of rituals held in 1988and 1989 at the Lowland Petén site of Naj Tunich by Q’eqchi’-speaking Maya.In what follows, we discuss the Tzuultaq’a, then describe in detail a January1993 ritual held in rural San Juan Chamelco, and conclude with the theoreticalimplications of such ethnography for the archaeology of cave use.We note that care must be taken in drawing direct analogies to ancient prac-tices, since the world and social parameters of the people with whom we workedare considerably different from those of ancient Maya peasants, and certainlyfrom those of the ancient Maya elite. Yet there is ample evidence of culturalcontinuities in ritual practices across the centuries (e.g., Carlsen 1997; Chris-tenson 2001; Farriss 1984; Fischer 2001; Freidel et al. 1993; B. Tedlock 1982;D. Tedlock 1996).At the most general level, it is clear that sacred sites must be analyzed withina framework that relates each site to its place within local, regional, and supra-regional systems of interconnected landmarks. These sites range from humbleroadside altars to well-known caves to Spanish colonial churches still in use torecently constructed evangelical Protestant churches (A. Adams 1999) to majorpilgrimage centers such as Esquipulas that draw devotees from across national"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"302The Maya Regionboundaries. In this, our work benefits from the post-1980s ethnography that seesrural Maya as deeply engaged in regional and extra-regional processes, a modelat odds with that of the bounded, defensive, ‘‘closed corporate community.’’We emphasize that the sacred sites known as the Tzuultaq’a are stages forcreating relationships, including gendered relationships, between people, com-munities, and extralocal polities. In other words, the sites do not just ‘‘stand for’’existing entities; they are critical in the creation and negotiation of relationshipsbetween such entities. Today, the Tzuultaq’a are vitally important for the culturaland spiritual revitalization movements of the Verapaz’s Q’eqchi’-speaking ma-jority. These sites are also used, at least indirectly, by most other ethnic and po-litical groups in the region, including Ladinos (Hispanic-identified Guatemal-ans), for civic ceremonies, rites of passages, and healing. The elite in the region,including the Catholic Church, other foreign missionaries, and the Guatemalanmilitary, have also played a major role in both terminating and reappropriatingthe practices oriented toward the Tzuultaq’a. It should be noted as well that ar-chaeological excavations of lowland sites have contributed to the reinitiation ofworship at these sites (see Demarest and García 2002).The practices noted in this chapter have theoretical implications for studiesof ancient Maya gender relations, particularly the gendering of everyday spiri-tuality in non-elite or peasant society around the metaphor of human and agri-cultural fertility (see alsoJoyce2000:7). We highlight the centrality of humanfertility as an ongoing metaphor for organizing practices and ideology concern-ing milpa agriculture, including agrarian rituals such as those carried out withincaves. As recent scholarship has documented, it is critical to avoid drawing con-clusions about Maya gender practices based on Western cultural assumptions(Freidel et al. 1993;Joyce2000; Schele and Miller 1986; Sigal 2000).We further emphasize that it is critical to avoid another set of ‘‘western’’assumptions during analysis of the ancient Maya’s material record. While theethnography of contemporary Maya societies demonstrates considerable hetero-geneity of social organization, archaeologists tend to apply analogies of virilocalresidence and a patrilineal basis to descent drawn from the western highlands,neither of which hold particularly for the ‘‘eastern’’ Maya such as the Q’eqchi’.In our research, the rituals at sacred caves and other sites were part of a spirit-possession cult in which elder Q’eqchi’ Maya women played a primary role, al-though women did not physically enter the caves and leave offerings. It requiresa nuanced approach to the material record left within the actual caves to discernthe high ritual profile of women, femininity, and gender in general."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites303The Tzuultaq’a: Sacred Sites in theLandscape of Alta Verapaz, GuatemalaThe strong terrestrial orientation of Q’eqchi’ Maya spirituality undergirds con-temporary worship, even after five centuries of indigenous appropriation ofChristian missionizing, both Catholic and Protestant. Alta Verapaz is the re-gion of Guatemala where Fray Bartolomé de las Casas attempted his ‘‘peace-ful conquest,’’ using the Catholic Church’s cross and not the Spanish military’ssword. Located some four hours north of Guatemala City via an asphalt high-way that was completed in 1938, Alta Verapaz is often described as unique—protected from colonial exploitation because of its Las Casian legacy and al-leged isolation. At the time of the Spanish invasion, the region was settledby Q’eqchi’, Poqomchi’, Lacandon, Acala, Chol, and other Maya groups thatmoved there in the Postclassic. The Q’eqchi’ heartlands, defined by themuni-cipiosof Cobán, San Pedro Carchá, and San Juan Chamelco, are based on theprecolonial settlements of Q’eqchi’ speakers and on thereduccionesenforced byLas Casas and the Dominican order. Q’eqchi’ Maya have emigrated from theseheartlands, both seasonally and permanently, since before the Spanish arrival.The Pre-Columbian record documents their fame as efficient traders through-out Lowland Guatemala and Belize (Cortés y Larraz, cited in King 1974:24;see also Wilk 1991:53). During the Dominican colonial regime, there was nowage labor in the Verapaz. To meet tribute requirements exacted in silver andcacao, Q’eqchi’ men migrated in large numbers, many traveling as far as Salva-dor to work on Spanish indigo, cotton, cacao, and cochineal plantations (Sher-man 1979:87). The introduction of coffee, and the accompanying Liberal landand labor grab, stimulated a massive and permanent Q’eqchi’ emigration fromthe heartlands to the lowlands of the Petén and Belize, beginning in 1880, andthen again in 1902 (Thompson 1970:24; Wilk 1991:42). In the highlands, theforeign-initiated expansion of coffee reorganized the physical and social land-scape so that by the mid-1930s over 90 percent of Verapaz’s indigenous peoplewere part of the plantation system (McCreery 1994).In the 1950s, government agrarian reform and land development programsbuilt roads and opened untitled lands in the uncultivated lowlands along thePolochic River and in northern Alta Verapaz. Immigration into these areas in-creased 312 percent between 1950 and 1964 (Arias 1967:8–9). The immigrantsmaintained relations with heartland towns through family relations, commerce,and ritual life.Today, most Verapaz residents speak Q’eqchi’ Maya, the fourth largest ofGuatemala’s twenty-one Mayan-language groups. Q’eqchi’ is the only Mayalanguage that is growing in both numbers of speakers and territory. There are an"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"304The Maya Regionestimated 361,000 Q’eqchi’ speakers throughout Mesoamerica, of whom some90 percent are monolingual (Cahuec del Valle 1993). Q’eqchi’ has retained a cer-tain degree of linguistic integrity in that speakers from the traditional heartlandscan understand Q’eqchi’ as spoken by those who have settled in the lowlands ofthe Verapaz, Izabal, Petén, and Belize.In using the term ‘‘sacred geography,’’ we are looking at what is for theQ’eqchi’ Maya the actual landscape that must be dealt with in all economic, reli-gious, and political activity. Contemporary Q’eqchi’ Maya and other residentsof Guatemala’s Department of Alta Verapaz make pilgrimages to various sites inthe highlands, and in the lowlands of the Verapaz, Izabal, the Petén, and Belize,to invoke their relations with the supernatural. At the center of their worshipis the figure of the Tzuultaq’a. The use of a term meaning ‘‘mountain-valley’’to refer to the earth deity is a widespread pattern in Maya languages (Bunzel1952:264; La Farge and Byers 1931:224; B. Tedlock 1993:454).The term ‘‘Tzuultaq’a’’ is used to refer to the thirteen principal sacred moun-tains of the Q’eqchi’ heartland and to the beings who inhabit caves withinthose mountains. Most Q’eqchi’ know some, but rarely all, of the Thirteen,who are revered by people from the traditional heartlands and those who mi-grated to the lowlands (De la Cruz Torres 1967:283; Schackt 1984:19, 26;Siebers 1993; Wilson 1995:56). When used in prayer, the expression ‘‘thir-teen Tzuultaq’a’’ embraces all the Tzuultaq’a because the number suggests com-pleteness in Q’eqchi’ (Schackt 1984:20). The Thirteen—Qana’ (Our Mother)Iitzam, Qawa’ (Our Father) Tulux, Qawa’ Chiaax, Qawa’ Chimam, Qawa’Xucaneb’, Qawa’ Raxon, Qawa’ Raxuntz’unun, Qawa’ Kojaj, Qawa’ Saquipek,Qawa’ San Vicente, Qawa’ Ixim, Qawa’ Sa’Mastoon, and Qawa’ Siyab (Siebers1993)—are significant throughout the Maya world; sites such as Xucaneb, Cojaj,and Iitzam regularly receive pilgrims from Guatemala’s Western Highlands and,less frequently, from Honduras, Mexico, Belize, and elsewhere.The Tzuultaq’a are personages with legends, gender identity, and personali-ties (Gordon 1915; Schackt 1984). They are known by titles meant to integratethem into the Catholic system: San Pablo Xucaneb, Santa María Itzaam. WhileQ’eqchi’ acknowledge and worship other divine beings, many people—includ-ing Catholic lay officials and evangelical Christians—observe respect for theTzuultaq’a. For traditionalist Q’eqchi’ Maya, or for those who make the agrariancult their priority, the impact of other deities is weak in comparison with that ofthe mountain-valley spirit. Carlson and Eachus (1977:38) note that ‘‘this atti-tude very probably stems from the bifurcation of the universe by the Kekchi intotwo jurisdictional areas:coša‘sky’ andrucic’oc‘earth.’ The vast distance whichseparates the deities of the sky from the physical world of earthlings effectivelyweakens any possible influence of Qawa’ Saq’e ‘Our Lord Sun,’ Qana’ Po ‘OurMother Moon,’ and Kaq Cahim ‘Red Star’ (Venus).’’"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites305The Tzuultaq’a are said to be ‘‘the owners’’ by Q’eqchi’, who petition thesebeings directly for the resources necessary for subsistence agriculture and hu-man health. The Tzuultaq’a hold—and withhold—water, land, trees, wild game,corn, beans, chiles, squash, and other crops. People point out that one can see thecrops inside the caves, captured in the shapes of the stalactites and stalagmites.If one does not ask permission, the Tzuultaq’a send strong winds, hail, wild ani-mals, pests, bats, or assaults from one’s own tools. In fact, human negligence ofduties to the mountain-valley spirits is said to have caused the ecological degra-dation of the highlands that has accelerated since the 1950s. Intolerant foreignmissionaries (both Catholic and Protestant), immigration to the lowlands, andthe civil war in which the Verapaz served as a major battleground caused peopleto abandon their agrarian rituals. Consultants in the highlands have said thatthe Tzuultaq’a left their area in the 1970s, and went to the lowland Franja Trans-versal del Norte—but have returned, because the highland peoples are remem-bering their offering (in Q’eqchi’,mayejac) to the Tzuultaq’a. The consultantsacknowledge that the increased yields are directly caused by the commercialfertilizer that Q’eqchi’ subsistence agriculturalists use, but they point out thatfarmers can afford to buy the fertilizer only if they have good relations with theTzuultaq’a.We have noted a strong association of sacred mountains and caves with water:these usually have a spring or stream inside. Sometimes it is said that the Tzuul-taq’a has much water stored inside. The Cave of Cojaj, however, one of thethirteen principal Tzuultaq’a, drops in several levels. We were unable to explorethe lower levels, as each required a technical descent. In the upper levels, thearea used exclusively by today’s Q’eqchi’ pilgrims, there is no evidence of water.Nevertheless, it is important that local residents believe the mountain is fullof water. In September 1992, rumors spread that an earthquake was imminent,which would split the mountain and cause a flood. Some community membersliving below the mountain moved to the opposite side of the valley.This association of mountains and caves with water is widespread. BarbaraTedlock (1986:128) states that the K’iche’ consider a mountain with a waterycave to be the ultimate source of rain and clouds. Vogt (1969:387) notes thatthe Tzotziles believe that rain clouds come out of caves and go up into the sky.Christenson (2001), in his analysis of the central altarpiece in Santiago Atitlán,makes the same observation for the Tz’utuhil Maya: caves store rain and rainclouds. A similar association of sacred sites with water has been noted for theLacandon (Tozzer 1907:81).Apart from the Thirteen, the Verapaz landscape is alive with the many Tzuul-taq’a that surround and give each local community its identity (see also Wilson1995:53). Rural communities relate to at least one local Tzuultaq’a, but in manycases identify up to four Tzuultaq’a in the hills around their settlement. These"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"306The Maya RegionTzuultaq’a live in theirrochoch pec(stone houses) overlooking the community.The wordmountain-valleyindicates the ideal ecological unit for the Q’eqchi’economy, which is a valley where milpa can be planted and where houses arebuilt, surrounded by wooded mountains that provide trees, rain, game, medici-nal plants, and other forest products. The word can be used in everyday speechto indicate a geographical unit, but as Schackt (1984:18) notes, the concept isloaded with divine significance.In the karstic zone of Alta Verapaz, many other geographical features lendthemselves to use as sacred sites. Caves, particularly in association with watereither real or imagined, are the best example of a sacred nexus (Schackt 1984:18),but we found that other landscape features such as bluffs, cliffs, boulders, over-hangs, and riverbanks provide potential locations for ritual activity and may beconsidered Tzuultaq’a. Schackt (1984:25–26) documented that Q’eqchi’ immi-grants to Belize chose a boulder as a focus for their ritual activity in the areabetween their milpas and the forest. In San Juan Chamelco, Catholic catechistswho participate in the post–Vatican II church reforms may not use the ‘‘tra-ditional’’ caves but will offermayejacat a boulder on the edge of their milpa.Adams has documented cases in which women offermayejacto the Tzuultaq’aon river- or stream banks, which again points to the association of water withthe worship practices directed to the Tzuultaq’a (see also Wilson 1995). Thesecategories of less-imposing sacred sites are not unique to the Q’eqchi’ but havealso been noted among the K’iche’ (McDougall 1946), the Tz’utuhil (Lothrop1933:81–82) and other groups (Termer 1957:164–166).Furthermore, built features such as crossroads and churches also serve asTzuultaq’a. In today’s postconquest syncretic context, Cobán’s Calvary churchand Tactic’s Chi-ixim sanctuary are considered the most outstanding Tzuultaq’aof the region (see also Cabarrús 1979; Siebers 1993; Wilson 1995). Catholicchurches were constructed on hills and, it is said, over lakes and caves.Finally, on the roads between communities and between barrios of towns,little chapels and altars have been set up formayejac.These are marked withMaya crosses, but also by certain rocks or rocky niches. These minor sacred sitessignal a critical aspect of all Tzuultaq’a: their role in the relationship betweengroups and polities, as discussed below.Sacred Sites as Markers of TransitionThe word ‘‘Tzuultaq’a’’ has another deep meaning in everyday life. The word in-dicates journeys across the region: people talk of their experience traveling fromcommunity to community as ‘‘Xo-nume chiru Tzuultaq’a’’ (We passed throughthese hills and valleys). People also say that in dreams the Tzuultaq’a may appear"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites307in the form of or ‘‘like a road.’’ In the Verapaz, ritual serves as a critical meansof extra-community outreach based on the Maya key symbol of the road (be’;see A. Adams 2001). The mountain-valley spirits, the Tzuultaq’a, are the mostpowerful ‘‘roads’’ and travelers of the Verapaz.Many ethnographers have documented the role of the Tzuultaq’a as sacredsites in the highlands and the lowlands and described these as the heart ofQ’eqchi’ Maya identity. One describes the Tzuultaq’a as the ‘‘container for allexpressions of Q’eqchi’ collective imaginings’’ (Wilson 1993:123). As AbigailAdams notes (2001:202), a more indigenous and useful imagining would be theMaya cross, rather than the bounded container. In fact, the Maya cross, with itsfive points, is the marker used on local roads to indicate the Tzuultaq’a. EachTzuultaq’a marks the crossroads and transition between Verapaz communities,and between the competing interests at stake in the Verapaz.Viewing Maya sacred sites as junctures of encounters and social fields hassignificant implications for archaeologists. In pilgrimages to worship sites, thepower of movement from one stage to another is invoked continually (see alsoChristenson 2001). Q’eqchi’ travel to their sacred sites on various occasions,such as during the rituals concerned with subsistence agriculture, illness, rites ofpassage, and commerce. The most important are rituals concerning the annualagrarian cycle: before the clearing of fields, planting, weeding, and, in particular,harvesting corn (Goubaud Carrera 1949:35–36). At Naj Tunich, pilgrimagesbecome much more frequent starting on May 3, the Day of the Cross, and con-tinue during the month until the onset of the rains. Some Q’eqchi’ farmers willmake offerings to the sacred sites before planting beans and those in the PolochicRiver Valley before planting rice and cardamom.During major life-cycle passages such as marriage, or in the cases of illness,personal risk, birthmarks or defects (awas), people supplicate the Tzuultaq’a forthe health of the person affected and for the safety of his or her soul (Bringhurst1986; Heyden 1976; Wilson 1995). Q’eqchi’ will offermayejacduring commu-nity events as well, particularly during the change of sacred office, such as theannual rotation of thechinames(individual couples responsible for organizingand financing the rituals and major fiestas of the barrio oraldea hermitas), theordination of Maya ritual practitioners, and the yearly spiritual renovation andoffering made by Q’eqchi’ healers (aj ilonel). The installation of Catholic priestshas also been celebrated with vigils and cave pilgrimages to petition the localTzuultaq’a, as occurred at the Lowland Polochic Valley town of La Tinta inJanuary 1993.The sites also play an important role in preparations for marketing and travel.Both women and men will stop at roadside shrines on their way to market centersto pray and to leave offerings of candles,pom(incense), and sometimes flowers.Sixteenth-century sources mention travelers performing self-sacrifice at such"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"308The Maya Regionshrines (Tozzer 1941:222). Q’eqchi’ women makemayejacto sell in the localmarket. In La Tinta, cooperative members carry out a vigil and offering for theTzuultaq’a every six months to ensure success and lack of corruption in theirwork.TheMayejacRitual for the Planting of CornSince 1992, Adams has participated in a number of Q’eqchi’ community prepa-rations for corn planting and other occasions, and in January 1993, Adams andBrady joined members of a rural community, Chajaneb, in their ritual prepara-tions before clearing fields at the beginning of the dry season. This communityhad a highly organized spirit-possession cult centered on the Tzuultaq’a. Herewe provide a processual description of the event, with references to other ex-periences and the literature, in order to draw conclusions.Chajaneb is a forty-five-minute walk from San Juan Chamelco’scabecera(lit-erally, ‘‘head town’’), along a regularly maintained gravel road, now with busservice (which did not exist in 1993). The community includes relatively levelland in the mountain valley in which the county seat is located, but also steeplyinclined lands rising up to the bluffs of Pa’apa Mountain. Most of the landsare held by the small resident farmers, a majority of whom must work in an-other capacity, including as seasonal agricultural laborers in the lowlands. Sev-eral wealthier town residents and foreigners also own land in the communityfor recreation, cash crop production, and commercial tourism. The communityhosts one of San Juan Chamelco’s four rural (and often unstaffed) health cen-ters, and has an elementary school and teacher. While the community was nota battleground during the violence, and although San Juan Chamelco suffered arelatively low level of disappearances and direct counterinsurgency, most of thecommunity’s men had personal experience with the military due to the forceddraft and mandatory civilian militias in which every man had to serve, oftenseveral nights a month, through 1994.The community also reflects the religious pluralism of most of Guatemala:its residents ally with reform Catholicism, traditionalist Maya practices, threeevangelical Protestant denominations—or sometimes combinations of these.The people who hosted us are traditionalist Catholics who participate in someaspects of reform Catholicism. They, and most residents of Chajaneb, markthe beginning of work having to do with corn planting with ritual observances,whether these be house rituals, a special Catholic mass, a Protestant prayerservice, or—in the traditionalists’ case—mayejacto the Tzuultaq’a. In Chaja-neb during our observation, the participants began their preparations by col-lectively setting a date for making offerings to the Tzuultaq’a and for the work"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites309schedule. For a period of days (in Q’eqchi’,oxlajuu koxaar—forty, thirteen, andsix days are all mentioned in the literature and in Adams’s fieldnotes) priorto themayejac,participating men and women abstained from various things,including sex, certain foods, and angry words or actions (see also A. Adams1999; Goubaud Carrera 1949:314; Sapper 1897:283; Siebers 1993; Thompson1970:173; Wilson 1995). Sexual abstinence appears to be a requirement beforecave rituals throughout the Maya area. Redfield (1941:314) notes such a prohibi-tion in Yucatán; McGee (1990:53) among the Lacandon; and Barbara Tedlock(1986:134) for K’iche’ rituals in Utatlan.In the days immediately before themayejac,community women and somecouples together assembled the necessary elements of the offering. Each house-hold contributed offerings or funds for the purchase of offerings in a majormarketplace. Household elders then went to the Calvary churches of Cobán, toChi-ixim in Tactic, or to other Catholic chapels to pray and leave part of theoffering. Community members also visited the families in town with land inChajaneb and collected money to buy offerings for those households. We wereinvited to contribute and to join the ritual as part of this process.The evening before the cave pilgrimage, the families gathered in the simplewood-and-thatched-roof home of one elder (in Q’eqchi’, thexbenil xtzuul,the‘‘first of the hill’’) to carry out an all-night vigil. Respected elders and ritual offi-cers from other communities were invited. While Adams was invited to sit withthe men, the community women either worked in the kitchen or took seats onreed mats in the main room. The women were separated from the men, who wereseated on benches around a rustic table near the house’s spectacular altar. Bothmen and women prayed and prepared themayejacofferings, which includedco-palpom(an aromatic tree resin), candles,rax cacao(untoasted cacao),saquicaalt(uncolored turkey broth), pottery in which to carry and burn the offerings, corntamales or porridge, turkey or chicken meat, blood, and sometimes flowers. Inother vigils not influenced by the reform Catholic admonition against alcohol,boj(the local fermented corn beer) is often served and offered on the altar.At 11:30, word spread that ‘‘they had arrived.’’ It turned out that the Tzuul-taq’a were also attending the vigil. An elder seated on thepetateshad entered intotrance and her voice rose above the bustle of the room. She spoke in an attenu-ated, whistling, high-pitched tone. One of the male guests rose from our tableand went to the woman’s side. He began to call out her indistinct words. Thefirst message: ‘‘Tell the gringa to stop taking pictures.’’ (The vigil’s hosts hadasked Adams to take pictures and give them copies.) Soon the elder announcedthe names of the Tzuultaq’a who were present. Several children, big and small,got up and put on special headdresses made of poinsettias. They danced as eachTzuultaq’a requested a favoriteson,played by a harpist, a violinist, and a drum-mer. The young dancers, seven girls and seven boys, were called ‘‘ángeles’’ and"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"310The Maya Region‘‘sumaatineb,’’ a Q’eqchi’ word which means ‘‘answered word or couple.’’ Afterseveralsones,a man supported the entranced and exhausted woman. Her shawlwas thrown over her head and shoulders.It turned out that the possessed woman was highly respected as a person withaq’un ch’ool(sensitive heart). She was said to have received the Tzuultaq’a manytimes and delivered important messages. The all-night vigils were, indeed, op-portunities to host the Tzuultaq’a and receive through the spirit medium specificinstructions for the following day’s visit to their homes, therochoch pec,to leavethemayejac.At daybreak, certain men, led by a community elder, prayed, then went toone of the community’s sacred sites, and then to Qawa’ Xucaneb, one of thethirteen principal Tzuultaq’a. It should be noted that these pilgrimages are notnecessarily restricted to points in the Q’eqchi’ area but may incorporate particu-larly sacred sites such as Esquipulas. This has been observed both in the areaof San Juan Chamelco and in the Petén, where one pilgrimage circuit includedjourneys to Esquipulas, San Pedro Carchá, and Naj Tunich. Adams found thatin many rural communities of San Juan Chamelco, Cobán, and San Pedro Car-chá, traditionalist men and women aspired to travel to Esquipulas as pilgrims.The visitation of sites outside of one’s area is not a phenomenon restricted toQ’eqchi’ Maya, in that Naj Tunich has drawn pilgrimages from as far away asMazatenango in the K’iche’ area.When the participating men arrived at Xucaneb with the offerings, they re-moved their belts, other metal items, and their hats before entering. We alsonoted this practice in one of the pilgrimages to Naj Tunich, where the leader ex-plained that metal was offensive to the ancestors (antepasados). One of Wilson’s(1995:71) consultants explained the custom as being due to the fact that ‘‘onemust not go in front of theTzuultaq’aasarichman.’’DuringthepilgrimagetoXucaneb, pilgrims burnedpom,lighted candles, and poured the untoasted cacao,blood, andsaquicaaltin the mouth of the cave. Once this ‘‘feeding’’ was com-plete, each one picked up one of the walking sticks left at the cave entrance andcontinued deep inside to an altar. There, the participants invoked the names ofthe thirteen principal Tzuultaq’a and then made their requests for the harvest,rain, sun, family health, and wealth. They exited, leaving the sticks at the en-trance, and returned to their homes to eat turkey soup with their families and thecommunity. While the selected men had been on the journey to leave the offer-ings, the rest of the community had been preparing the celebration meal, thepaabank,for their return. On their way home, the Chajaneb pilgrims stoppedat the local chapel of Xucaneb community to pray. They planned to visit theirneighboring community’s Tzuultaq’a with some minor offerings as well."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites311Organization of Q’eqchi’ Maya Sacred GeographyThe regional nature of Q’eqchi’ sacred geography as set out here, as well as thedescription of a set of cave ceremonies which took place during a single pilgrim-age, have important implications for archaeologists working with cultural land-scapes and with caves. Q’eqchi’ people think of their landscape, and organizetheir practices, in terms of relationships among different locations. Any singlesacred site, or community, is integrated into a regional network of sites.Q’eqchi’ sacred geography is mapped on a number of territorial scales, thelargest of which revolves around the thirteen Tzuultaq’a which encompass theentire Q’eqchi’ area. The invocation of the thirteen principal Tzuultaq’a dur-ing the ceremony at Xucaneb has correlates in other parts of the Maya area,where the names of all the important caves and cenotes in the region are invoked(Góngora Cámara and Preuss 1990:144; Redfield 1941:117; Redfield and VillaRojas 1934:349–350). The pilgrimages observed in the Q’eqchi’ area and at NajTunich include at least a local site, one of the thirteen principal Tzuultaq’a, and,today, a ‘‘syncretic’’ site (a Catholic chapel or church). A similar pattern hasbeen observed at Esquipulas, where pilgrims stop at the Hill of San Sebastián,the Piedra de los Compadres, the Cross of Paste, and the caves along the RíoMilagro, in addition to the Basilica of the Black Christ (Smith 1979).The pilgrimages as a process also integrate local communities and local pro-duction areas with regional commercial centers. The pattern of visiting both alocal cave and a regionally important cave that may be associated with a promi-nent center of production or distribution has implications beyond simply thestudy of sacred geography and pilgrimage. The exchange of local produce in themarket for the purchase of items at a regional center is an economic componentthat may have been important in Pre-Columbian systems of regional and inter-regional exchange (A. Adams 1991:113; McBryde 1969, 1:247–248). In Pre-Hispanic times, when warfare between sites may have made trading expeditionsacross disputed territories difficult or impossible, economic activity carried onunder the idiom of the pilgrimage may have been especially important.The practice of visiting multiple sites, both a local and a regionally impor-tant cave, suggests that even smaller, less-imposing caves may have been affectedby visits from nonlocal pilgrims. The transformation of local produce for thepurchase of ritual items at a regional market, however, might make such visita-tion difficult to detect. It is generally assumed that assemblages from regionallyimportant pilgrimage caves should contain a greater variety of artifacts from agreat many production centers, which would reflect the pilgrims’ places of ori-gin. The actual situation could be complicated if ancient Maya customs weresimilar to those practiced today. Today, Q’eqchi’ will pick flowers, which theysell, and then buy flowers from the market near the pilgrimage site, which they"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"312The Maya Regionmake as offerings. The majority of the pottery offered in Xucaneb comes fromthe four regional markets of Cobán, Chamelco, Carchá, and Chamil. Therefore,it might not be possible, using neutron activation analysis of Pre-Columbiancave ceramics, to reconstruct the origins of ancient pilgrimage routes. Further-more, it is important not to assume that major sacred sites, such as Xucaneb,which received visitors from all over the Maya world, were associated with majoreconomic centers; today Xucaneb is a small rural community without a marketor any particular production specialty beyond subsistence milpa production. It ispossible that the communities associated with the Thirteen were, in antiquity,distinguished political or economic centers, but excavations of the considerablecontemporary ritual activity in Xucaneb would not correlate with levels of secu-lar community development (see also Turner 1979).In the highland Q’eqchi’ regional system, each community has specific wor-ship sites. The sites Adams has documented are located on all peripheries of thecommunity. They do not serve as official survey markers, but do highlight themajor extensions of the community and the primary ecological zones that belongto it. In the January 1993mayejac,the Chajaneb pilgrims incorporated othercommunities’ sites into their route and invited elders and guests from other com-munities to participate in themayejacvigil. The sacred sites, therefore, mark thelimits and zones between communities, as the roadside altars also mark the pas-sage between communities, altars where travelers passing through foreign landscan make their offerings and petitions to the Tzuultaq’a. Thus, the participationof the two communities in a pilgrimage to local landmarks is a revalidation oftheir political boundaries performed within the context of ritual and ceremony.We also know from the ethnohistorical record that the ancient Maya placedshrines and altars along roads very much as the Maya do today.The military as a regional institution has also had a primary impact on localand regional sacred sites. In the Verapaz, the military dubbed its major base onthe outskirts of Cobán the ‘‘Home of the Soldier Tzuultaq’a.’’ The military hadconsiderable reach into local communities and individual lives, including rituallife, through forced recruiting and surveillance of community movements. Inthe Verapaz, in fact, the military created ‘‘model villages,’’ into which indigenousrefugees were forcibly resettled in the 1980s (see Richards 1985; Wilson 1995).We note that during much of the more than thirty-six years of violence, ruralMaya were unable to carry out either their ritual or their economic life freely.The military’s actions contributed to eradicating indigenous worship centeredon the Tzuultaq’a by murdering indigenous ritual leaders, restricting movementwithin the region, and destroying sacred sites (see also A. Adams 1999; Siebers1993; Wilson 1995). In this context, the worship movement that we were in-vited to join was redeveloping, under considerable tension, between neighborsbefore war ended in 1996 with the signing of the Guatemalan Peace Accords."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites313We would also note the long history of other regional institutional actorsin the appropriation and termination of sacred sites. In all of Mesoamerica,the Catholic Church, since the colonial era, has actively suppressed, termi-nated, or redirected the use of indigenous ritual sites. The Spanish practice ofplacing churches on top of indigenous sites and temple foundations is well docu-mented, with the Templo Mayor in Mexico City being the outstanding example.Most of the Catholic pilgrimage destinations were spots that had previouslybeen the focus of indigenous devotion (Ortiz de Montellano 1990:16). Amongthe cave sites that suffered this fate are Chalma in Central Mexico (Bennuzzi1981; Campbell 1982:10; Carrasco 1950:149–150) and Esquipulas in Guatemala(Brady and Veni 1992). Less-celebrated sites were undoubtedly terminated inlarge numbers by the actions of the clergy. Gage’s (1958:279–285) looting ofa cave shire and the destruction of the idol was probably copied innumerabletimes across Mesoamerica. More recently, various U.S.-introduced evangelicalProtestant denominations have, at one time or another, worked quite closelywith the Guatemalan state and been intolerant of the agrarian cults centeredon the Tzuultaq’a. Today, however, the Catholic Church and several Protestantdenominations are proving to be important in the revitalization of culturallysensitive worship, including elements concerning the Tzuultaq’a.The violence that ended in 1996 in modern Guatemala does not provide adirect analogy to the political and cultural situation in Pre-Columbian times.Instead, we wish to point out that local ritual sites are of interest to regional andforeign actors in times of warfare and invasion. At Dos Pilas, the cave under anatural hill that was modified into a huge pyramid was ‘‘terminated,’’ apparentlyafter the final defeat of the site. The entrance to the longest tunnel was blockedby yellow clay and the entire entrance was sealed with stone (Brady 1997:608–609). At Naj Tunich, the entrance to the tunnel system was blocked by a stackof cut formations and the tombs on the balcony were looted (Brady 1989). Thispattern appears to be quite ancient. A small cave containing a number of buri-als of important individuals appears to have been looted in the Late Preclassic(Garza et al. 2001).Finally, these sites can be renegotiated and regenerated. In the town of SanJuan Chamelco, at the time of the study, an evangelical Protestant family waspreparing an addition to their house which would engulf a roadside shrine—a large wooden Maya cross covered by a shed roof—on their property. Theyconsulted with traditionalist ritual elders, followers of a faith other than theirs,and helped the elders organize a work party to move the cross and shed downthe road. In another case, in 1976, a Cobán Q’eqchi’ elder dreamed of a sacredsite, which his family and a group of young Maya followers interested in renew-ing traditional Maya practices searched for and found. They began a series ofvenerations at the site, located on the outskirts of Cobán, Alta Verapaz’s depart-"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"314The Maya Regionment capital, and built a small house and altar there. The sacred site has sinceevolved into a renowned pilgrimage destination for Q’eqchi’ Maya, both urbanand rural, and other Maya working in the spiritual revitalization movement (seeA. Adams 2002; García 2002). Real estate exigencies in one of these cases andregional political and ethnic resurgence in the other two led to the relocation ofsacred sites. Such relocations would appear in the archaeological record as denseartifact deposits reflecting heavy utilization but with little or no developmentalhistory.Finally, archaeologists have noted that their work in locating and excavatingLowland Maya caves has resulted in renewed pilgrimages initiated by contem-porary Q’eqchi’ Maya. Naj Tunich reemerged as a pilgrimage center after pic-tures were published in the Guatemalan newspaperPrensa Librein 1980. Duringthe second season of archaeological survey at Naj Tunich in 1982, one of theworkers reported that the Q’eqchi’ living in Tanjoc, a village some twenty kilo-meters from Naj Tunich, had heard rumors about the size and grandeur of thecave. They were convinced that this was the home of the corn god and wanted tocome to Naj Tunich before the rains started to make offerings for a good harvest.Unfortunately, the field season ended without our hearing any more from thepeople of Tanjoc. Various problems prevented Brady from returning until thespring of 1988. In the intervening six years, news of the cave had spread by wordof mouth to the villages surrounding Naj Tunich. When work began in 1988 atleast a dozen villages, most located within thirty kilometers, were making visi-tations to the cave (see also Demarest and García 2002 and García 2002 forreports from Cancuen, in Lowland Alta Verapaz).Cave Ritual and Pilgrimage as a Gendered SystemThe issue of gender, especially in relation to access to certain types of featuresin the sacred landscape, is now receiving more attention in Maya archaeology,ethnography, and epigraphy. In this section, we contribute to a more contex-tual gender analysis of sacred site use, particularly in terms of how the genderedprocesses of rural Q’eqchi’ Maya worship can inform analysis of the genderedrelationships of ancient Maya. In discussing these issues, we draw on feministarchaeological analysis of gender as something that one does, rather than assomething that one is (see also Joyce2000). The perspective of gender as per-formed is critical in understanding Verapaz ritual today, in which gender is acriterion conditioning the type of participation in worship of each person—menand women—involved in petitioning the Tzuultaq’a.Considering how little ethnographic effort has been focused on caves in gen-eral (see Chapter 1 here), it is not surprising to find how little attention has been"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites315paid to the larger gendered context of Maya men’s and women’s ritual practiceconnected to these sites. Our research concerning a Verapaz prohibition againstwomen physically entering caves, and a related Q’eqchi’ term,muxuq,is illus-trative.A search of the ethnographic literature reveals a widespread prohibitionagainst the use of caves by Maya women. This is not restricted simply to theQ’eqchi’ (Carot 1989:25–26; Gould 1968:167; Wilson 1990, 1995:68) but ap-pears to be shared across the entire Maya area (Blom and Duby 1957:348; Caye-tano 1982:6; Gómez N. 1974:8; Hernández Pons 1984:39; Redfield 1941:119,121, 314; Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934:139; Shook 1952:250; Thompson 1975:xxi; Toor 1947:34–35; Villa Rojas 1969:210; Wisdom 1940:374–375). Wewould also note that this is not simply a recent development, since the pat-tern was noted by Stephens (1962, 2:16) in the 1840s and by Tozzer (1907:149;1941:106n, 128n) at the beginning of the twentieth century among the Lacan-don.In the Verapaz, women are said to bemuxuq,and therefore unable to entercaves; men are nevermuxuq.The manner in which the Q’eqchi’ word is handledin the literature reveals a gendered blindness. In the Q’eqchi’-Spanish dictionar-ies developed by Catholic and evangelical Protestant linguists (Haeserijn 1979;Sedat 1955), the word is translated as ‘‘to not be worthy of, to profane’’ (in Span-ish,desmerecer, profanar). These scholars connectedmuxuqwith biblical conceptsof sin and sex. They were also very influential religious leaders in the bilingualreevangelization movement and in Q’eqchi’ ethnography. Wilson (1990:83), forexample, follows their interpretation in translatingmuxuqas ‘‘profane’’ and ana-lyzes the injunction ‘‘Maamuxuk aawib’’ (Do not profane yourself by having sex[before the corn planting]) as evidence that ‘‘sex is felt to bemaak,which canbe translated as ‘sin’ or ‘culpability.’ ’’Adams, however, found that there had been little research on what turnedout to be a complex topic. For example, everyone she consulted said that bothwomen and men were equally likely to sin or equally likely to be devout. There-fore, although men are notmuxuq,they can be just as ‘‘profane’’ as women. Thiscontradicts any simple gloss ofmuxuqwith Western concepts of ‘‘sin or sex.’’Muxuq,it turns out, means ‘‘to pass a shadow over people or their personal itemsand tools.’’ A Q’eqchi’ language teacher related the word tomuquk(to hide) andmu(shadow). Women learn to perform—or to avoid performing—muxuq,be-ginning when they are little girls. They are enjoined to hold their skirts closeto their bodies when they pass people and to avoid stepping over peoples’ pos-sessions, food, or bodies (in Q’eqchi’,maamix a’an;see also Eber 2000, for ex-amples from Chiapas Maya). Similarly, in cases of emergency where a Lacandonwoman must chant, she ‘‘catches her skirt between her knees as she squats totend the god pot’’ (Davis 1978:56). More specifically,muxuqrefers to what is"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"316The Maya Regionhidden under Q’eqchi’ Maya women’scortes(skirts made of several yards of fab-ric and which can be made even more voluminous by wearing several underslips).Women’s bodies are perceived as ‘‘casting shadow,’’ while men’s bodies, specifi-cally, their genitals, do not. The word thus indicates that women are sources ofshadow.There is, therefore, nothing inherently profane about Q’eqchi’ women thatprohibits them from holding ritual office or from entering sacred spaces. Rather,in ritual processes, certain qualities associated with women and men are elicitedin certain contexts. In Alta Verapaz, both men’s and women’s bodies serve sym-bolically in the ritual process to model certain practices and avoidances. If theirperformances are not effective, their bodies—and their households and com-munities—are the sites of reprisal, in the form of hunger, accidents, illness, andviolence.Q’eqchi’ men and women, in fact, aim to enhance women’s performanceofmuxuqby wearingcortes.At the turning of each year, men and women gotogether to choose newcortesfor the women, which are purchased by the men.During the many year-end holidays, women and men step out together, withthe women newly amplified in fresh, fullcortesand several slips, sweeping out awide circumference of influence.Doingmuxuqalso enables women to serve as the best trance subjects, the bestembodiment of the Tzuultaq’a who are invited to visit during the evening vigils.Women are said to be particularly suited to this form of discourse because oftheir bodies’ affinity with the mountain-valley being, the coldness of their geni-tals, and their ritual position seated on the earth on reed mats. In ritual, women’saffinities with the mountain-valley spirits are emphasized in their dress, such asthecorteand thetupuy,the red woven hairband that can be several feet long andis directly related to the snakes said to guard the cave entrances to the Tzuultaq’a.Like the Tzuultaq’a, women are associated with the, at times, dangerous flowof water, or fluid. Water is a vital and paradoxical resource in rainy Verapaz.Because of the karstic geology, heavy rainfall causes temporary but destructivefloods and erosion. In many areas, water falls and then drains away throughporous limestone to the water table without forming useful rivers. Like water,the genital fluids of men and women are humorally considered ‘‘cold,’’ poten-tially powerful, but also dangerous. Women, however, are said to be open, whilemen are closed. They play different roles in receiving and being received by theTzuultaq’a.Furthermore, in researching the ritual implication ofmuxuq(initially, with aninterest in the cave prohibition), it became apparent to Adams that an ‘‘indige-nous asymmetry’’ had been further skewed by different Western-informed di-chotomies. Adams interviewed several ritual elders, both men and women, ruraland townspeople, people involved in ongoing local traditionalist rituals and in"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites317regional and national cultural-revitalization movements. Those consulted pre-sented different positions on the issue ofmuxuq.Some said that women couldnot enter caves, period, while others drew on reform Catholicism and a re-visionist reading of the Bible to find examples of women entering caves. Somevoiced Pauline perspectives and equatedmuxuqwith an inherent state of femalesin, rather like the foreign missionary dictionary writers. Others presented JohnLocke–like analysis, judging that increased equality for women would reflectthe progress of Q’eqchi’ peoples—and therefore women should enter caves now.In the spiritual-revitalization services observed by Brady at Naj Tunich, womenyoung and old entered the caves with the men of their communities to leaveofferings and make their petitions. The women gathered around the cave altarsbehind the men.We note that the arena of worship is one in which people ‘‘do’’ gender quiteexplicitly, with more heightened restrictions and possibilities than in many secu-lar areas. Q’eqchi’ Maya men and women, in fact, enjoy notably more egalitar-ian (in the Western sense) relations and statuses than those documented in theethnography of the western highlands. Abigail Adams (1999) observed muchmore flexibility and economic, ritual, and even political power and partnershipin everyday life.In the Verapaz rituals centered on the Tzuultaq’a, gendering affects the pil-grims and others at four levels: first, those who prepare themayejac,principallythe men and women household members; second, those who send themayejac,who can be men or women; third, those who deliver themayejac,who,again,canbe men or women, depending on the context; and, fourth, those personages whoreceive themayejac,the Tzuultaq’a. Throughout these levels, the heightenedawareness of gender complementarity marks proceedings, as it does in otherritual settings. In the Verapaz, women and men are named as a couple to ritualduty; in wartime or when other events remove their menfolk, Q’eqchi’ womenare expected to assume all of the couple’s ritual duties.For single men or women, ritual office is much more limited. In fact, the spiritmedium whom we observed has not served in this capacity since her husbandleft her for another woman. She is, however, always invited as a ritual elder tothe spirit-possession events.In practice, as we noted in the pilgrimage description, the ritual process openswith the separation of the sexes, as men and women practice sexual abstinence,maintain a spatial separation during the night vigil, and preserve a strict divi-sion of work in their ritual offices. In Q’eqchi’ agrarian rites in whichmayejacisleft in a cave, on a bluff, or under an overhang, women may be prohibited fromentering or from joining the pilgrimage, as they are forbidden to participate inrites performed by a number of other Maya groups. However, women do leavemayejacby rivers, roadside altars, and in the chapels and altars of the commer-"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"318The Maya Regioncial and syncretic ritual centers, such as the Calvary chapels. The sacred sites ofrivers, roads, and market centers are feminine or inclusive: these intraregionalor extra-community sites are accessible to women. There are many situations inwhich women—for example, widows and woman healers who make offeringsbefore planting, arranging a marriage, or renewing their healing powers—sendtheirmayejacwith male pilgrims, who then make the offering in the woman’sname.Furthermore, women alone, in groups, or, more rarely, with their spousescarry out all the marketing needed to obtain the material offerings made dur-ing the series of rituals. In fact, a 1993 study by Q’eqchi’ linguist EleuterioCahuec demonstrates that Q’eqchi’ women travel beyond their community farmore regularly than do men (Cahuec del Valle 1993).Under certain circumstances, Maya women and girls assume roles, other thanthat of spirit medium, that stand out in their community. For example, a younggirl reported repeated dreams and visions to her parents, who recognized themas a call from their community’s Tzuultaq’a. In this case, with the assent ofthe community’s ritual elders, her mother took her to the cave entrance of themountain-valley spirit, where the child saw a golden line leading into the caveand heard a voice inviting her to follow it inside. She followed the line inside,but then decided to return. As an older woman, she was, like the spirit mediums,considered a woman ofq’un ch’ool.The act of ritual also regenders men, who must follow the ritual restrictionsas closely as women do. Within the all-male pilgrimage groups, men are regen-dered. Q’eqchi’ Maya organize their ritual officers in three pairs, moving fromthe ‘‘first,’’ orxbenil,to the ‘‘sixth,’’ orxwaquil.The first and second officersare the paired senior officers, often referred to asprincipalesin the literature.Within the pair, the junior, second, officer is female in relation to the first, thexbenil.In the next pair, the junior, fourth is considered female to the seniorthird. Within the final pair, the sixth couple is considered female in relation tothe fifth, officer, couple. When the men enter the cave, therefore, to leave thecommunity’s offerings and petitions, some do enter as female.Sacred sites themselves are gendered. Each Tzuultaq’a has its title of lordor lady (qana’orqawa’). The mythic stories about these personages, particu-larly those concerning Qana’ Iitzam, the only female-marked Tzuultaq’a of theThirteen, include gendered scenarios of courtship, seduction, and sexuality thatoften severely transgress sanctioned community practices. The Tzuultaq’a dem-onstrate gender complementarity as well; each has traits considered both mas-culine and feminine. This gender complementarity appears in descriptions ofthe Tzuultaq’a: in dreams, faints, or trances, the beings may appear as men orwomen. An urn in the Salesian Order’s Regional Museum at San Pedro Carchádepicts the Tzuultaq’a with both feminine and masculine features."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites319The centrality of sexuality as it relates to fertility is also captured in descrip-tions of the cave’s internal spaces. One consultant told Sergio Garza that thestalagmites and stalactites omnipresent in Verapaz caves were gendered as maleor female, respectively; when these unite to form a column, fertility has beenachieved (Burnett et al. 2002).We have not noted any difference in the description of the rituals or con-tents of the offerings left in caves sacred to male as opposed to the single femaleTzuultaq’a. However,manos, metates,spindle whorls, and other weaving instru-ments that are closely associated with women are commonly found in caves.Does this indicate that women were present at cave rituals, or did the genderidentification of the objects change in their movement from a utilitarian to aceremonial function? This is certainly possible. Christenson reports (2001:131)that Santiago Atitlán’s image of San Juan Carajo has a hollowed-out placewithin it containing bits of old cotton, twelve needles, and a spindle whorl,which may relate to the creation of the world by weaving. Villa Rojas (1945:71)notes that the sacred breads used in indigenous rituals are prepared and cookedby men. In Zinacantan, when the water holes, normally the domain of women,are ritually cleaned, only men do the work; no women are present (Vogt 1976:102).Ethnographers have noted that flowers are usually exclusively women’s con-cern, but flowers are commonly encountered in caves, the domain of men. Spin-dle whorls and bone needles, parts of a weaving assemblage that is almost em-blematic of female status, are regularly found in caves (Brady 1989:264–265,269–271, 300–303). We would argue that these items are present precisely be-cause of their gender association and the need to unite male and female in allritual performance.ConclusionsThe ethnographic data presented here have a number of implications for ar-chaeological investigations of precontact indigenous sacred geography. First,ancient Maya sacred geography was probably at least regional in scope, in whichany given site was integrated into and functioned within a hierarchical networkof sacred landmarks. Thus, the common archaeological practice of investigatingindividual caves as independent entities ignores the complex social relationshipsinvolved in the utilization of the site and that contributed directly to formationof the artifact assemblage. Our observation of modern pilgrimages in both theQ’eqchi’ area and at Naj Tunich documents that pilgrimages are not focused ex-clusively on a single important site. Rather, a number of stops are made along apilgrimage circuit. Thus, pilgrimage activity plays a role in the deposition of cul-"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"320The Maya Regiontural material even at sites that are not important or impressive enough to havebeen the central focus of a pilgrimage cult. Furthermore, even the highly local-ized sacred sites may have religious and political significance to many peoplesresident in the region.While archaeologists have only begun to study caves, we are suggesting thatthe field of study must be amplified. Although caves are the best example ofthe sacred landmark, they are by no means the only one. The problem for thearchaeologist is recognizing the less-visible types of sites, such as overhangs,niches, and altars, which can provide a fuller reconstruction of prehistoric sacredgeography.The implications are not limited to the study of religion. Archaeologists havehad a long-standing interest in discovering economically important trade routesand political boundaries. As we have noted, shrines and altars are often locatedalong roads and crossroads, so the detection and mapping of these less-imposingsacred features may help define economically important features in the land-scape.Archaeologists too frequently harbor very simplistic notions of religion andritual as narrowly focused on spiritual matters of little importance. In emphasiz-ing the performative aspect of sacred sites such as caves, we are drawing attentionto the fact that the Tzuultaq’a are places where people create community andextra-community political, economic, and spiritual relationships. For archaeolo-gists interested in political boundaries, we have shown that, in the absence ofclear markers, these frontiers are defined, negotiated, redefined, and celebratedin ritual. Thus, the political evidence that an investigator seeks is apt to be foundin ritual deposits rather than in any overtly political remains.While the material culture used in the modern rituals is more meager andless elaborate than that recovered from archaeological contexts, the pattern ofacquisition of ritual paraphernalia provides an interesting model to be testedagainst ancient practices. Q’eqchi pilgrims regard certain categories of itemsas more appropriately acquired near the pilgrimage destination rather than asitems brought from home. The economic implications of such a belief shouldbe immediately apparent. The greater the pilgrimage visitation, the larger thevolume of material purchased locally and, therefore, the greater the economicimpact on the resident population. If pilgrims had brought goods from home totrade for the necessary ritual items, the patterns of circulation and depositionwould be the reverse of what one might suspect. Foreign goods would enter themarket and be exchanged for items of local manufacture that would be used inritual. A pilgrimage cave might, therefore, have a very homogeneous artifact as-semblage produced from local raw materials. Foreign goods, on the other hand,would tend to enter the market, circulate through the society, and be depositedin contexts not directly associated with the pilgrimage location itself."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Ethnographic Notes on Maya Q’eqchi’ Cave Rites321The ethnographic model presented here, it is important to note, raises thepossibility of relating the gendered ritual practices of contemporary ruralQ’eqchi’ Maya to the material record of earlier Maya ritual. One clear gainwould be a much fuller picture of all actors—male and female—involved in ritualactivity.The gendered ideologies centered around the Tzuultaq’a and their role inanchoring the metaphors of fertility are also instructive for the archaeologicalrecord. For example, we support Martínez Marín’s (1972) observation that Pre-Hispanic pilgrimage centers tended to be dedicated to rain and water deities. Inexamining the thirteen most important sacred mountains/caves in the Q’eqchi’area, we noted the strong association with water and with rainmaking—andwith the identification of the female with water sources.We caution care in drawing analogies based on the practices of contemporarysubsistence farmers operating within a postcolonial, late-capitalist landscape ofHighland Guatemala about ancient Maya practice. However, the gendered na-ture of rural Q’eqchi’ Maya worship can inform analysis of how commoners inthe ancient Maya world organized ritual.Finally, we note the highly regenerative aspect of the Maya sacred landscape.Sites where practices were terminated by either force or abandonment are nowbeing renewed, and new sites are being brought into worship circuits and so-cial networks. The resiliency of contemporary Maya spirituality and its materialmanifestations is critical in understanding and excavating the centuries of Mayalandscape use.ReferencesAdams, Abigail E.1999 Word, Work and Worship: Engendering Evangelical Culture between High-land Guatemala and the United States.

Asection discussing Petryshyn’s plans for a larger ethnographic project has beendropped as irrelevant because it was never completed. Other sections have beenexpanded with excerpts from a number of Petryshyn’s unpublished articles thatrelate to caves, religion, and mythology among the Lacandon. The sources ofthese excerpts are indicated in the notes. I have also augmented Petryshyn’sdiscussion of certain points with data from other ethnographic sources on theLacandon. In this way, Petryshyn’s original article was used as a vehicle forbringing together the meager data on Lacandon cave use. Much of this informa-tion is drawn from obscure German, French, and Spanish sources, so the articleis a particularly valuable synthesis for English-language readers. All of my addi-tions have been highlighted or inserted as notes. Petryshyn’s single footnote hasbeen incorporated parenthetically into the text.—P.R.C.IntroductionThis article focuses on a cave pilgrimage in the Lacandon area. The Lacan-don live in the forests of eastern Chiapas and western portions of the Peténin Guatemala.2The Lacandon call themselves Hach Winik (literally, Real, or"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"A Lacandon Religious Ritual in the Cave of the God Tsibaná329True, or Very People) in their own tongue, that is to say, inhash t’aan(thereal, or true, or very language). They constitute one of many Maya groups. Tooutsiders the Hach Winik have been described as Caribs, Lacandon, Lacan-tun, and Maséwal, Masséwal, etc. (Petryshyn 1973b:272a). The wordLacandonseems to be the one preferred by most writers and familiar to most readers ofanthropological literature. This is one of the reasons why the term is also usedin this article. As a name, it is first mentioned in reports of Cortez’s march toHonduras in 1524 (Squier 1858:556). The term ‘‘Lacandon’’ is itself a distor-tion. It derives fromlacamtun,which means ‘‘large rock’’ (Scholes and Roys1968:40; Villa Rojas 1967:29),lacantun,or ‘‘stone standard’’ (Brasseur de Bour-bourg 1866:2), or the name of a river in the rain forest of Chiapas known asLacantun (Sapper 1897:258; Seler 1960–1967:3:582).Lacam tun(large rock) isbelieved to be the historicalpeñolorpeñón muy grande(very large rock, rockyisland) of Lake Miramar, Chiapas, presumably historical Laguna del Lacandónfound in earlier sources (e.g., Villagutierre Soto-Mayor 1701).3However, theLacandon themselves never accepted this or any other derivation of that name,hence none of these terms have any meaning for them. They regard themselvesas the real people, Hach Winik.Only a few scientists have devoted attention to questions regarding the reli-gious role of caves in the Lacandon area. This kind of contribution, while makingsome observations regarding findings in caves, the appearance of caves, and re-marks made by the native people, can be regarded as only partially empiricalbecause of the authors’ failure ever to attend an actual Lacandon cave ceremony.For whatever reason, cave ceremonies are rarely mentioned in the anthropologi-cal literature. The author, while conducting research on mythology among theLacandon of Nahá during an expedition in 1968, became the first to report inthe scientific literature a Lacandon religious ritual in a cave.4The Lacandon PantheonThe pantheon of the Lacandon of Nahá is represented by thirty-six deities. Theentire universe directed by these deities can be divided into three parts: the sky,the earth, and the underworld. There are thirteen gods of the sky, fourteen of theearth, and nine of the underworld. Each god has a wife, except Kianthó, themost important god of the earth. He has two wives. Naming a goddess, the La-candon of Nahá simply use the wordaknail,adding to this the name of thegoddess’ husband. The residents of Nahá know only two goddesses by their truenames. The relation of the gods with each other is friendly, or as the peopleof Nahá say in their language, ‘‘imbohó.’’ The gods meet each other as friends,relatives, or family members. They talk, eat, drink, and smoke cigars in mutual"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"330The Maya Regionfellowship, and their personal relationships manifest attitudes of positiveness,benevolence, friendship, hospitality, and joviality.5The Hach Winik are organized into patrilineal clans calledonen.6Eachonenconsists of an animal name and another, unspecified, name. In discussingonen,the Hach Winik mention only the first part of a combined clan name. Only afterfurther conversation do they provide the complete name. The people at Nahá aredivided into two clans: Ma(a)sh-Kásyaho, and K’ek’en-Kóho. Like the people,the majority of the gods in the Hach Winik pantheon also belong to these twoclans. The gods living in caves around the lake—Mensabok, Itsanohk’uh, andTsibaná—are all terrestrial deities. Mensabok and Itsanohk’uh belong to theonenK’ek’en-Kóho, while Tsibaná belongs tout supra.The Lacandon pray to their gods mainly in their own temples, which are ofgreat simplicity and consist only of a palm-leaf roof on posts without any walls.7Normally, just one person uses those temples. In the case of the temple visitedby the author, Mateo Tschankín and Tschankín’s son-in-law, called Antonio,who all lived close to each other, shared the temple. Several distinct offerings aredisplayed in there. Most common is copal (pom;Yucatec:pom) and, during spe-cial occurrences, the alcoholic beveragebalché,which is produced from rituallystamped sugarcane, water, and the bark of thebalchétree through a twenty-four-hour fermentation process. Thebalchéis placed in front of the temple in twocanoes.Besides temples there are two other types of places of worship (meaning indi-vidual residences of gods) to which the Nahá Indians make pilgrimages: the an-cient Maya ruins, which are interspersed throughout the tropical jungles; and afew caves found on the edges of lagoons, where the Lacandon of Nahá worship.8Caves were regarded as being sacred9and were thus the most secretly kept sites.10They were further thought to be the work and the residence of the Lacandon’snative gods11and were actually regarded by the Lacandon as natural temples forthe gods.12One typical cave in which the author witnessed a worship ceremony will beclosely analyzed. The cave described here is named after the god Tsibaná. Hisname means ‘‘draughtsman of houses’’ or ‘‘housepainter.’’ Bruce (1965) regardsthis god as the god of the Arts. According to Tschankín of Nahá, Tsibaná wasthe god of house painting and monuments.13Under his auspices, the houses ofthe gods Mensabok and K’ak’ were constructed. According to Tschankín’s ver-bal account, Tsibaná is consulted during heavy rainfalls, which can devastateagricultural fields (kóor;Yucatec:kol), and is prayed to for beneficial weatherfor the cornfields. He resides in a cave at a lagoon of the same name. However,Tsibaná is less important than Mensabok.The god Mensabok, whose full name is K’ak’ Mensabok, probably wouldbe translated as ‘‘fire-producer of soot.’’14He is mainly associated with hunt-"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"A Lacandon Religious Ritual in the Cave of the God Tsibaná331ing with the traditional bow and arrow. Praying to Mensabok means success inkilling deer and eating them, as well as the killing of jaguars, which are not con-sumed. Mensabok also brings success in hunting for pheasant, puma, and wildboar. Mensabok has a cave residence on the lagoon that bears his name.The PilgrimageAfter a long stay in the Lacandon area, we succeeded in winning the natives’confidence and, as a result, we were finally invited to a cave ritual. The caveis located on the shore of the holy Lake Mensabok, in the tropical jungles ofChiapas. The lake’s name is derived from three lakes or lagoons that are con-nected through channel-like waterways. One of these is named after the godMensabok, another, located to the southeast, after Tsibaná, and a third, locatedeven more to the southeast, is called K’ak’. The lagoon of Tsibaná, where thecave bearing the same name is located, is at 17°2'N and 90°29'W, and is situatedto the west of the Usumacinta River.The ceremony was observed in the middle of March 1968. A small groupof pilgrims of the settlement Nahá, located southwest of the holy lake, begantheir journey at six o’clock in the morning. The group consisted of the followingpersons: Enrique ( Jorge’s son); his younger brother K’imboy; Manuel, a Tzeltal-Maya from the neighboring Tzeltal settlement called La Colonia Lacandona;and the author. The latter [Manuel] walked in front of his fully loaded mule(tsimín;Yucatec:thultimín) and ahead of the author. Manuel accompanied thepilgrimage, but did not take part in the ceremony, which will be explained later.Enrique and K’imboy both carried modern rifles (ts’on;Yucatec:dz’on) hauledon their backs and loaded nets (baay;Yucatec:baay), which were attached bystrips of fiber to their foreheads. In these nets they carried the cult parapher-nalia and native provisions. The boy, K’imboy, carried a bow (tschurúr;Yucatec:tschulul)andadart(chrr;Yucatec:halal, hul) with an end made out of wood,with which he wanted to shoot some small, colorful birds, whose skin he wantedto give to his mother. All married Lacandon women carry these bird skins; theyhang from their hair, which is bound at the neck. Usually the bird skins aretaken from macaws (mo;Yucatec:moo;Spanish:guacamaya),pito real(achpanorpan;Yucatec:ahpamorhpam,a type of toucan), or other small birds. A fine-looking collection of such bird skins is located in the museum at Na Bolom.The Museum für Völkerkunde in Vienna is also in possession of some examples.K’imboy’s dart and bow, which he donated to the author, are located today atthe Museum für Völkerkunde in Vienna. For more regarding the classificationsof Lacandon darts, see Sapper (1897).The two Lacandon both had leather bags, which traditionally hang from the"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"332The Maya Regionright shoulder. Enrique’s bag (poschá) is of the modern variety, which can bebought at stores in San Cristóbal or Tenosique. K’imboy’s bag (hatschposchá),however, was made according to the old Lacandon way from the skin of a youngdeer (yuk;Yucatec:yuk). Quite often, Enrique smoked a large, very good smell-ing Lacandon cigar (hatschk’uts), whereas K’imboy was satisfied with a moderncigar (hunik’uts). All members of the group carried machetes (maská;Yucatec:maskáb) in their right hands.For twelve hours we wandered through the thick bush, often chopping withmachetes, and passing the time talking and joking, all the while having surpris-ing adventures. Finally, we reached Pepe Tschankín’s field (kóor)attheholylakeof Mensabok. We had a healing sleep in hammocks (sing.k’an;Yucatec:k’an)on the floor of the unwalled field hut, roofed with palm leaves.The next morning the pilgrims, guided by Tschankín, traveled in two canoes(sing.tschem;Yucatec:tschem) to the cave where they worship the gods Mensa-bok, Tsibaná, and K’ak’. After the ceremonies in the three caves were observed,they were carefully recorded and compared. As a result of this comparison, itwas deemed that the ceremonies in all three caves were similar. Since ritualsconducted in the three different caves, for different deities, do not seem to differin their execution, they were all are deemed as being of the same type. Hence,only one cave ritual is presented as an explanation of all three ceremonies ob-served around Lake Mensabok. The cave presented in this account is the oneidentified as being utilized for the worship of Tsibaná.The cave of the god Tsibaná can be entered only from the lagoon. Comingfrom the lake into a small bay, the pilgrims left their canoes in front of a veryhigh and steep rock slope that reached far into the lake. Atop the slope a cleftwas barely visible, appearing from far away to be a shadow. We reached this cleftafter a short but exhausting climb, and it turned out to be the entrance into theholy cave of the god Tsibaná.The Lacandon choose such remote places of worship in order to hide themfrom foreigners. The Tzeltal-Maya, Manuel, who accompanied the pilgrims toMensabok and helped them throughout the trip, was neither invited to cometo the caves nor did he try to participate. He stayed in Pepe Tschankín’s fieldhut, because he knew of the Lacandon’s reservations concerning outsiders par-ticipating in cave ceremonies.As part of worshipping the cave god, the Lacandon utilized a sacrifice censer,which is always a bowl that also represents a god.15I have observed that thesecensers all portray god K’ak’, who is identified in the Nahá region as having along neck. All the other heads depicted on the censers are unidentifiable to any-one except the person who made them.16During the ceremony in the cave, itwas made clear why foreigners are not allowed to observe or participate. Suchforeigners might be regarded as evil by the gods or could be seen as having a"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"A Lacandon Religious Ritual in the Cave of the God Tsibaná333bad influence upon the gods. Among the Lacandon, it is thought that the un-sanctioned presence of foreigners in a place of worship could cause earthquakes,death, or other catastrophes.On a rise in the lower section of the cave, below the entrance, I observedseveral human skulls that were not deformed and that were lined up along theleft side of the wall.17The lack of skull deformation is one of the many piecesof evidence that they were deposited in the cave in modern times.Next to the skulls lay a number of censers, many of which were broken, andwhich did not seem to be arranged in any pattern. The word for censer,wlakilkuh(u-lak-il-kuh), literally translates as ‘‘the god, his pot’’ (one could translate thisas ‘‘holy vase’’ or, considering its function, ‘‘censer’’). In addition, there were anumber of square boards with handlesschikar*(sing.schikár), upon which restedballs of copal, which had been placed there before the ceremony.18Fragmentsof several previous offerings were observed scattered across the floor, which wascovered with snakelike roots from trees coming from the cave entrance. [*In theruined temples visited by foreigners, where many visitors go,schikarcannot befound anymore; they have been stolen. The Lacandon complain about this. Theexistence of boards within the cave emphasizes the point that foreigners nevervisit the cave; the holy lake is navigated only by the Lacandon.]In the left corner, the highest area in the cave, stood part of a large censercovered with burnt copal. This censer represented the god Tsibaná.19The rightcorner of the cave stretched far into the back of the room, narrowing into thedark, which, according to the Lacandon, leads into the deep rock. The mysteri-ous atmosphere of the cave was reinforced by the darkness and the soot-coveredwalls.20The whole cave appeared to be a long, irregular room.Right after entering the cave, Pepe Tschankín and K’imboy crouched againstthe right wall, where they remained for the duration. The celebrant, Enrique,descended into the cave in order to carefully choose one of theschikárcopalboards from a large pile. He put the chosen board on the floor in front of him.Having done this he unpacked from hisbaaya bowl that was wrapped in bananaleaves and filled with copal. He then started his soft and conversational prayer,which transformed into modulated singing until then unknown to the Westernworld. While doing this he formed with the fingers of his right hand small ballsof copal and set them in ordered rows on the board.21After completing theschikárritual, he approached Tsibaná’s censer22and puta few balls of copal on the layers of burnt resin residues that completely coveredthe holy sacrifice bowl except for the modeled godhead. He then set fire to thecopal and periodically throughout the ceremony would add one or two balls ofcopal. When the holy fire got stronger it lighted the entire chamber, so that onecould see the room’s size clearly.Meanwhile, Enrique was singing. He prayed to Tsibaná. In his prayer, in"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"334The Maya Regionwhich the god was addressed as father, he mentioned several times the sacrificethat he celebrated through his poetical and ceremonial songs. He asked the godto look at his sacrifice and accept it. In doing this, he asked Tsibaná to protectthe cornfield from bad (too heavy) rainfalls,23which could devastate it, and toprotect the cornfield throughout the years in order that he (the celebrator) couldbring his harvest to the god. Quite often, Enrique moved a ritually wrappedpalm leaf above the holy fire. The leaf and other paraphernalia were left in thecave after the ceremony.The faces of the Lacandon participants during the ceremony looked veryopaque and dejected, one could almost say frightened. Leaving the cave, how-ever, they were impartial and friendly. This strange behavior was later explainedduring a conversation while rowing on the lake. It is the Lacandon belief, alreadymentioned, that the presence of strangers (also women;24see Blom and Duby1955:350) during a cave ceremony could cause earthquakes or other bad luck,even death, if these individuals were judged by the gods as bad. However, asnothing negative had happened so far, Pepe Tschankín, Enrique, and K’imboywere happy, smiling, and satisfied.The wind played with the Lacandon’s thick, long, dark hair and loosetunikas[tunics] while the pilgrims rowed back in their canoes on the high waves, inwhich fragments of the sky and the surrounding landscape were vividly reflected.Summary1. This article represents the first eyewitness account of a cave ceremony in theLacandon area.2. It should especially be emphasized and confirmed that the holy caves, towhich the living Nahá Indians conduct pilgrimages, are(a) carefully selected by the Lacandon by using their own certain criteria;(b) kept secret as such;(c) the individual residences of gods;(d) places of worship and devotion;(e) used as places of sacrifice; and(f ) used as burial places (bone houses).3. The scientific results concerning the role of the contemporary Lacandonholy caves generally correspond with J. Eric S. Thompson’s (1959) resultsof his own research in Yucatán and British Honduras as well as those ofauthors concerning other parts of the Maya area, even though some localderivations of the culture are visible."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"A Lacandon Religious Ritual in the Cave of the God Tsibaná335AcknowledgmentsThe author thanks doña Gertrude Duby of Na Bolom for the personal intro-duction into the Lacandon settlement Nahá.

Permission to produce this translation was kindly given by Dr. Peter Kann of theMuseum für Völkerkunde, Vienna.2. This section is excerpted from Petryshyn (1973b).3. Of the island in Lake Miramar, Boremanse (1993:325) says, ‘‘This island waspillaged by the Spanish in 1559 and again in 1586. Finally, ‘El Lacandón’ became thename of the entire region as well as the name of the tribes in that region. The term hascome to describe roughly any group of nondominated Indians living in the forests ofChiapas and Petén.’’ Stuart (1996) identifies the Classic Maya name for stela aslacamtun,‘‘big stone’’ or ‘‘banner stone.’’ The name Lacandon, therefore, has an old root; how-ever, it was connected to ancient monuments and was most likely never connected topeople.4. Petryshyn may be correct in this in that the Lacandon appear to be reluctant toshow these sites to outsiders. After Tozzer accompanied a pilgrimage to the cave-homeof the god Icananohqu on Lake Petha, he stated, ‘‘The writer was not allowed to landfrom the canoe, nor were any of the family other than the father and the eldest son, whocarried out the ceremony’’ (Tozzer 1907:149). McGee (1990:58) states, ‘‘One final classof ritually important sites are cave shrines. Although there are apparently several suchsites, I have been allowed to visit only one that is situated in a rock overhang on the shoreof Lake Itsanok?uh near the community of Mensabak.’’ Blom and Duby (1955:440) re-late, ‘‘A young Tojolabal did not know the way to the cave, or—as we suspect—was afraidof showing us the cave.’’The Lacandon reticence to take outsiders to caves may reflect an older Maya pat-tern that was more generally observed. At the end of the nineteenth century, Sapper(1897:282f.) noted that there were only a very few people who ever entered caves. He(1897: 283) states that he was never actually able to see anybody entering a cave. It wasonly from other persons that he learned that people conducting cave ceremonies had topractice sexual abstinence for forty days and pray for three days prior to entering a cave.5. Material from this section is taken from Petryshyn (1968b).6. Material from this section is drawn from Petryshyn (1973a).7. When Tozzer conducted fieldwork among the Lacandon during the first years ofthe twentieth century, secrecy surrounded the godhouses. He noted (1907:92), ‘‘Greatsecrecy and privacy in regard to the rites inside the sacred hut, together with its contents,are carefully observed. In many settlements this hut is surrounded by a screen of palmleaves to protect it from the prying eyes of the occasional Mexican visitor. Sometimes"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"336The Maya Regionwhen there are important rites in progress all of the trails leading to the settlement arestopped up with underbrush. Any attempt at approach to the sacred enclosure is abso-lutely denied to outsiders.’’8. In another publication, Petryshyn (1973b:272a) describes the important places ofworship: ‘‘These places include the palm-thatched temples of today, holy ruins of the an-cient Mayas, and the sacred caves, which are the most secret sites. The ruins and the cavesare believed to be the work and the residences of the native gods.’’ Boremanse (1998:27)states, ‘‘The Hach Winik visualize the form of residence of the earth and celestial deitiesas a mere reflection of their own. Once the gods lived on earth. The earthly gods dwelledincavesinsidethecliffsthatarecommonlyfoundontheshoresofthelakes...Whenthey ‘died’ (i.e., pretended to die) the deities...went beneath the surface of the ground.Their spirits, however, continue to occupy these shrines.’’9. Sapper (1897:283) found that this practice was widely distributed at the end ofthe nineteenth century: ‘‘In the Alta Verapaz the religious ritual was most likely held bythe Indians in caves because many ceramic effigies are found in caves. Even in times ofreligious-political turmoil, as in the year 1885, the Indians still conduct religious ritualsin caves, offering flowers and the like...AlsointheHighlandsofChiapas, among theTzotziles and the Tzentales, caves seem to function as locations of religious rituals. Atleast, ceramic effigies can be found in those caves, which are still objects of venerationamong those Indians.’’10. Jacques Soustelle (1937:53) notes building activity inside a cave and remarks onthe entrance’s being ‘‘closed in part by a wall of stones of small and regular size, stackedwithout cement’’ [cette ouverture est en partie fermée par un mur de pierres de petitesdimensions, régulières, superposées sans ciment]. He mentions, however, that the wall isancient, and the Lacandon ascribe its construction to the sun (Soustelle 1937:53).11. Jacques Soustelle reports (1937:52) that ‘‘to this should be added that the Lacan-don of San Quentín regard this cave (and the ones I will be talking about) as the nightresidence of the sun’’ [Il faut ajouter à cela que les Lacandons de San Quentín considè-rent cette caverne (et celles dont je vais parler tout à l’heure) comme l’habitat nocturnedu soleil]. Georgette Soustelle (1961:43) gives much the same information and stressesthe great importance of the cave for the people around San Quentín. Duby and Blom(1969:292) state, ‘‘Numbering 34 in 1946, the group had a priest, ceremonial huts, andcensers, and, in spite of poor soil for farming, lived at Sökrum (white earth) for religiousreasons—to be near the cave where K’in, their main god, disappears at night to make thetrip under the world.’’ Jacques Soustelle (1937:51) makes a case that many of the ceramicsfound in the cave bear sun images. He (1937:53) further notes that neither the ceramicsnor the walls can be ascribed to today’s Lacandon. They, rather, regard the caves as sacredliving places of their gods [pour eux les cavernes, grottes, abris sous roche, sont presquetoujours des lieux sacrés habités par des dieux (le soleil,Metsabok, Itsanok’u)]. For themthe caves and rockshelters are even today sacred places inhabited by their gods.12. In another publication, Petryshyn (1968a; my emphasis) mentions that this cavewas regarded as the temple for Tsibaná: ‘‘The Lacandon also pray in the ancient Mayaruins [and] in the cave (temple) of Tsibaná’’ [Los Lacandones rezan también en las ruinasantiguas mayas [y] en la cueva (templo) de Tsibaná]. This appears to be part of a widerpattern pointed out by Thompson (1959:122), who notes ‘‘the sixteenth century use inYucatan of the termactuntosignifybothcaveandstonebuilding...Thisappears tosupport Las Casas’ inference that caves and temples were partially interchangeable asscenes for religious rites.’’"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"A Lacandon Religious Ritual in the Cave of the God Tsibaná33713. According to Cline (1944:Table 1), Tsibaná (whom he calls Tsivana) translates as‘‘house of writing,’’ and the god lives in a cave with paintings. According to Boremanse(1993:328), Ts’ibatnah can be glossed as ‘‘paint the houses.’’ McGee provides interestingdata that relate to this in his description of the Cave of Mensabok (1990:59): ‘‘Also nearthis site are a series of cliff paintings. Approximately thirty to fifty feet above the lake area series of simple designs painted in red. Although many designs are unrecognizable, sev-eral are clear and depict outlines of hands, a monkey, and a couple of anthropomorphicfigures. Also pictured in black (described in Bruce 1968) is a more sophisticated draw-ing of a serpent, jaws open wide and swallowing some object. When questioned as towho made the drawings, the Lacandon answer that it was the god Ts?ibatnah, ‘Painterof Houses.’ ’’ Tsibaná’s name, then, may be derived from the painted caves which areequated with houses. Boremanse (1998:27) states, ‘‘The gods are thought to dwell inhuts, as the Lacandon do. To humans the palm leaves of which the roofs of the gods’houses are made look like stones, but the gods see the stone structures and the rocks asthatched huts. Now it is interesting to note that both rocks, especially around the lakes,and the ruined temples are usually found in clusters, not alone. The people therefore be-lieve that their deities live in clusters of households, just as they do; they see in thosegroupsofrocks...amodeloftheirownpatternofresidence.’’14. Mensabok in Yucatec means ‘‘hacedor de polvo negro’’[maker of black powder orsoot] (Barrera Vásquez 1980:521) and is derived from the Yucatec wordsabak,‘‘soot.’’Cline (1944:113) states that ‘‘Metzabok is a santo who lives in a cave on a lake. He makesrain by burning copal, and the smoke turns into rain clouds. Then the Santo makes windwhich brings the rain by waving the tail of a big guacamaya (macaw) which he keeps.When the wind comes then there is rain.’’15. Jacques Soustelle provides similar information from the 1930s. He notes (1937:42) that at the time the ceramic type ‘‘ ‘a bràs’ [was] to be found among the Lacandon...They [were] placed in great numbers in the caves of Mensabok at the lake bearing thesame name, where these ceramics [had] been left as offerings’’ [‘‘à bras’’ se rencontre enusage aujourd’hui chez les Lacandons...Ilenexisteentrès grand nombre dans la cavernedu dieu Metsabok au bord du lac de même nom, où on les a laisses comme offreandes].According to Soustelle (1937:41), ‘‘This type of censer is characterized by an anthro-pomorphic representation that is reduced to a simple head with two arms and probably aspinal column [Ce type d’encensoir est charactérisé par le fait que la représentation an-thropomorphe n’est pas réduite à une tête, mais comporte deux bras et probablement unecolonne vertébrale]. Soustelle emphasizes that the whole anthropomorphic shape of thecenser facilitates its active role in rituals.16. Boremanse (1993:328) describes the censers thus: ‘‘The pot has a stylized anthro-pomorphic head, whose lower lip protrudes like a spout and receives the offerings of ritualfood and drink.’’ The censer itself is not the most important part. Boremanse (1993:328)goes on to explain that ‘‘when they decide to make an incense-burner for the deitieswhose home they have come to in order to pray, they take some of these little stonesto their home and deposit them at the bottom of the clay pot (u läki k’uh,‘the pot ofthe god’), which serves as a censer...Fromthismomenton,thegodispresent in thetemple and humans may communicate with it through the sacred stones (u kanche’ k’uh,‘the seat of the god’) contained in the censer, on top of which they burn copal resin . . .[H]umankind must communicate with them by means of sacred rocks. Without theserelics, there could be no communication between humans and deities and the clay potswould be powerless.’’"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"338The Maya Region17. Boremanse (1993:327–328), who visited the cave of Mensabok in 1974 and 1979,offers this interpretation of the skulls: ‘‘Undoubtedly, these were originally burialgrounds, although they have been raided and profaned many times since their creation(the Lacandon confirmed that the tombs were profaned and that most of the objectscontained in the tombs were stolen by foreigners). Situated at the entrance of the caveisamoundofrocks(u mukulan,‘the grave,’ ‘the tomb’), which quite probably explainsthe human bones (skulls, jaws, and femurs) scattered about everywhere. In all likelihood,offerings accompanied these remains, but such objects would have since been stolen.Aside from some fragments of pottery, nothing is left of these funeral gifts.’’ McGee(1990:58–59) offers additional details: ‘‘Most interestingly, there are skeletal remainsof at least four individuals in association with the god pots and bowls. Arranged onthe ground between piles of bowls and god pots are four skulls with the flattened fore-head cranial deformation common to the Prehispanic Maya, one pelvis, four femurs, twohumeri, one fibula, one tibia, and a small assortment of other unidentified bones. TheLacandon say the bones are the remains of gods who at one time took human form. Whenthey returned to the sky they discarded these bodies. Although none of the material atthe site has been dated, judging from the number of artifacts piled at the site it has beenan important ritual place for a significant length of time.’’ In her description of the samecave in 1943, Gertrude Duby (Blom and Duby 1955:350) mentions the skeletal materialon the surface but not the presence of looter’s pits, so it seems quite likely that the loot-ing occurred during the second half of the twentieth century. This also suggests that thebones on the surface are not simply material scattered about as a result of looting, but,rather, represent bones that were originally placed on the surface. Speaking of the cavesin this area, Blom and Duby (1955:222) mention that ‘‘in those caves—many of themunexplored—there are to be found secondary burials or bone deposits and human skele-tons, as well as fragments of large vessels of crude manufacture.’’ The photographs ofthe skulls and bones presented by both Boremanse and McGee do not show either ad-hering dirt or discoloration, which one would expect of bones that had been buried forcenturies. The situation may have been analogous to practices in the Tzeltal area, where‘‘a few generations ago, the most distinguished members of each lineage were buried inthe cave’’ (Villa Rojas 1969:215).18. Jacques Soustelle (1937:41) also notes, ‘‘In a cavern located next to the Lacandonsettlement of San Quentín we found the fragments of a censer half full of burned copal’’[Dans une caverne située près du campement indigène de San Quentín, nous avons trouvéles débris d’un encensoir à demi plein de copal brûlé].19. This is an ancient concept with roots dating at least to the Early Classic (Houstonand Stuart 1996, 1998). Objects like censers, stelae, and buildings were regarded as livingbeings with a soul and thus received a proper name. The erection of stelae, in many cases,meant the erection of a ruler or a god (Stuart 1996), the object being the embodiment ofa ruler or god.20. The cave appears to be quite similar to the cave dedicated to Mensabok. Bore-manse (1993: 328) says, ‘‘Deep inside the rocky interior walls of the cave is a stone altarbelonging to a god and a goddess (his spouse), owners of the cave and a nearby lake. Thestone representing the god stands taller than the stone of the goddess. It is impossibleto distinguish the original shape of the stones, because they are completely covered withsoot and the residue left by the burnt copal. The True People burn the incense on the head(uho’or) of the stone, inside a circle of small pebbles glued onto a resinous substance.’’21. It appears that the Lacandon believed that the gods descended to theschikárto"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"A Lacandon Religious Ritual in the Cave of the God Tsibaná339take this offering. One Lacandon chant records, ‘‘The gods pick them (the offerings) up.From how many small caves do they descend and stand on the board. I want you to de-scend and stand on the board. Surely the wind comes, and the rain comes’’ Davis (1978:147).22. Petryshyn, in fact, states that he approached the god, not the censer: ‘‘Nach derVollendung...näherteersichdemGottTsibaná’’(Petryshyn1968a:174). Tozzer (1907:149) stresses this same point in saying that the ‘‘god was supposed to be actually presentduring the performance of the rite.’’ Here, the object is the embodiment of the god, andthe object becomes the god himself. The censer most likely is being awakened to lifethrough the performance of the censing ritual and turns into the god during the ritual.This suggests to me that the many effigies in Classic Maya art used during precessionprobably represented the gods themselves, who were thus physically present during therituals.23. Jacques Soustelle also notes the association of cave pilgrimages and rain. He statesthat ‘‘the objective of the pilgrimages to Lake Mensabok, during which a great numberof offerings to the god are left in the cave, is obviously to obtain the rain at a favorablemoment’’ [le but de pèlerinages au lac Matsabok, au cours desquels on dépose dans lacaverne du dieu des offrandes extrêment nombreuses, est évidement d’obtenir la pluie aumoment favorable (Soustelle 1937: 21).]. The pilgrimages seem to be heavily associatedwith the agricultural cycle and not so much with underworld deities.24. In 1943, Duby (Blom and Duby 1955:350) entered the cave of Mensabok alone.On returning to her Lacandon companions she asked,‘‘What happened, Enrique? Why did you leave?’’‘‘Metzabok does not like women entering his house. I was afraid of an earthquake. Thewhole hill would fall, kill us. Now everything is all right, Metzabok is content, theLacandon is content.’’Duby (Blom and Duby 1955:348) was aware of this general prohibition againstwomen when she had asked to visit the cave: ‘‘One day I asked Chank’in at that time ifhe wouldn’t take me to the Sacred Lake [Laguna Sagrada]. It was an audacious proposi-tion, his women did not participate in religious ceremonies, it is not permitted for themto enter the godhouse, and I had the presumption to want to visit the house of a god!’’ReferencesBarrera Vásquez, Alfredo1980Diccionario Maya Cordemex.Ediciones Cordemex, Mérida, Mex.Blom, Frans, and Gertrude Duby1955La selva lacandona.Editorial Cultura, Mexico City.Boremanse, Didier1993 The Faith of the Real People: The Lacandon of the Chiapas Rain Forest.

Located between the more celebrated areas of Yucatán and theCaribbean coast, this zone of open savannas and low, forested hills, known asthe Yalahau region, has only recently yielded evidence of extensive settlement bythe ancient Maya (Figure 14.1). Due in part to the region’s inaccessibility andrelatively low elevation, it has not been an attractive target for scholarly cave ex-ploration. A rather ambitious, peninsula-wide survey of caves by Reddell (1977)provides barely a glimpse beneath the surface of the Yalahau and is essentiallylimited to a single, previously reported, and presumably nonarchaeological cavenear the community of Nuevo Xcan (Reddell 1977:249). Similarly, the valu-able atlas of Maya caves assembled by Bonor Villarejo (1989) does not list anycaves for the inland area of Quintana Roo north of Coba. It is likely that the re-gion’s high water table (which is thought to be indicative of cave-poor terrain),the absence of massive civic-ceremonial centers (on the order of Chichén Itzáor Coba), and the introverted nature of localejidoshave all contributed to theregion’s archaeological isolation.In 1993, Fedick and Taube (1995) directed an archaeological reconnaissanceof the region. This pilot field season led to the development of the Yalahau Re-gional Human Ecology Project—a long-term, interdisciplinary research effortfocusing on the relationship between the ancient Maya and the environment ofnorthern Quintana Roo. After a few serendipitous visits to local caves in 1993, Ibecame aware of both their frequency within the Yalahau region and their omni-present signs of human activity. It was clear that a regional archaeological projectwas no more justified in ignoring caves than in ignoring any number of surfacefeatures—be they natural or cultural. At the very least, these caves could pro-vide the project with a more complete view of the region’s unique environment."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"Beneath the Yalahau343Figure 14.1.The Yalahau region and nearby archaeological sites.At best, they could offer a wellspring of information concerning the region’sprehistory. In cooperation with ongoing surface investigations, the Yalahau Ar-chaeological Cave Survey was initiated in 1995, for the purpose of documentingand evaluating the nature and extent of ancient cave use in the region.Between 1995 and 1999, twenty caves of archaeological interest were inves-tigated (Figure 14.2). They were located with the assistance of local guides andplotted using a global positioning system (GPS) receiver.

In addition to caves, all potential surface-water sources encountered dur-ing the survey, including wells,aguadas,open cenotes, wetlands,bajos,and thelike, were recorded.While the Yalahau Archaeological Cave Survey was designed to address awide range of topics, this chapter concentrates on two separate but related as-"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"Beneath the Yalahau345pects of ancient Maya cave use. First, a comparative study of a number of caves inthe survey provides insights into the physical and cultural criteria for the selec-tion and appropriation of specific caves for specific purposes. A cave’s locationrelative to surface sites and topographic features as well as its speleological char-acteristics profoundly influenced its use. This comparative study will attempt toarticulate the relationships between caves, surface sites, and natural features tobetter understand how the Maya conceptualized, transformed, and interactedwith caves. The second topic concerns the internal spatial organization of thecave environment. In the Yalahau region, spatial relationships between naturalfeatures, artifacts, and cultural modifications within the caves themselves appearto be deliberate and meaningful. By examining such patterns, it is possible to re-construct the movements of the ancient Maya both to and through the region’scaves.Water and Caves in the Yalahau RegionThe occurrence of surface water is rare in the karst terrain of the northern low-lands (see Veni 1990). The rapid and complete infiltration of rainwater across thepeninsula is facilitated by the porous limestone stratum, known assascab,whichlies beneath the hardened surface caprock (Isphording 1975:244, 246). The ce-notes of the northern lowlands often provided the only access to the water table.Morley (1946:12) sums up the implications for archaeological settlement pat-terns: ‘‘In a country devoid of surface water as northern Yucatan, these cenoteswere the principal factor in determining the location of the ancient centers ofpopulation. Where there was a cenote, there, inevitably, a settlement grew up.’’In the Puuc region of western Yucatán, when localaguadasand cisterns (chul-tunob) dried up, the Maya were forced to procure drinking water from the manydeep caves of the region—often at great effort (Andrews IV 1965; Mercer 1896:91–94; Stephens 1843:2:98–104; Thompson 1959:124; Zapata Peraza et al.1991; see also Isphording 1975:246–247). This has seriously affected archaeo-logical thinking about caves and cenotes, which tend to be viewed exclusively asutilitarian water sources.In the Yalahau region, by contrast, fresh water is abundant and readily avail-able because of the presence of wetlands. This low-elevation area, referred togeologically as the Holbox fracture zone, is characterized by linear depressionsand swales which follow an underlying system of horst and graben featureswithin the horizontally bedded Tertiary carbonates (Tulaczyk et al. 1993; Weidie1982). A highly localized rainfall anomaly has contributed to an unusually thickfreshwater aquifer lens (Isphording 1975) and pronounced dissolution activity(Southworth 1985). Consequently, water is available at or near the surface—if"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"346The Maya Regionnot within the low-lying wetlands, then via the region’s numerous small cenotesand ancient wells (Winzler and Fedick 1995; see also Bell 1998). Wells surveyedby Winzler and Fedick (1995) at the site of El Naranjal are as shallow as twometers, and a five hundred–hectare wetland forms the northeastern boundary ofthe site’s architectural core (Fedick and Taube 1995).Caves are a common occurrence in the upland portions of the Yalahau re-gion. However, access into many of the water-bearing caves is difficult—oftenrequiring the negotiation of vertical drops and long crawlways. It is importantto note that these water-bearing caves are neither the only nor the easiest meansof water collection in the region. This point is illustrated in the relationship be-tween Actun Pech and its nearby wells. The cave, located four kilometers south-east of El Naranjal, consists of a seven-meter-deep vertical-walled shaft. A long,narrow, horizontal tunnel extends from the bottom of the shaft to a small inter-mittent pool, sixty-seven meters into the passage. The section of tunnel leadingto the pool is littered with pottery, and debris was piled along the walls to facili-tate movement through the crawlway. The tiny ephemeral pool appears to havebeen the final destination of this arduous crawl, as no evidence of cultural ac-tivity exists in the fifty-five meters of tunnel which extend beyond the pool—save for the sherds of a cached vessel found in a small niche above and behindthe pool.Approximately six hundred meters from Actun Pech is an ancient well thatprovides perennial access to the water table. Near this well, we identified a clus-ter of residential mounds and an additional well. It seems unlikely that the an-cient Maya would have ventured into Actun Pech in search of drinking waterwhen it could have been more easily and regularly procured from local wells.Rather, the water collected from Actun Pech and other caves discussed belowwas likely valued for its remote and sacred origin; as Stone (1995:239) states,‘‘The sanctity of space was proportional to its lack of accessibility.’’ In this re-spect, the situation in Actun Pech is fundamentally different from that describedby Stephens at Bolonchen (1843:2:96–104), where drinking water was collectedfrom the cave when all other means were exhausted. It suggests that the wet-lands, open cenotes, and wells that surround caves such as Actun Pech servedas the primary sources of drinking water, while the caves may have representedmore restricted or sacred environments and were therefore reserved for ceremo-nial activities.The importance of this fact cannot be stressed too strongly. Because cavesin the Yalahau were not the only, and therefore indispensable, water source, noreven the most accessible, we would not expect evidence of cultural activity tobe associated with simple utilitarian water collection. As already noted, archae-ologists have tended to focus on caves/cenotes as water sources to the exclusionof all other functions. While it has been pointed out in the ethnographic lit-"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Beneath the Yalahau347erature (Brady 1997:604) that cenotes used for drinking water are also impor-tant ritual features, this point seems to have had little impact on archaeologicalthinking. The removal of the water-source function from the caves of the Yala-hau region allows us to separate the ritual function from the utilitarian function.The ritual pattern isolated here allows us to identify the underlying meaningcarried by these features. Those insights can then be applied to caves/cenotesthroughout the peninsula to provide a more comprehensive appreciation of theirmultifaceted significance.This, however, does not necessarily preclude the collection of drinking waterfrom certain caves, which, arguably, could have been a ritualized, albeit rou-tine, activity. Seasonal trips into the cave at Bolonchen, for example, were nocasual affair but were marked by ceremonial activities in the nearby village. Atthe Gruta de Chac, the unique nature of the site was underscored by genderreversals in which men, as opposed to women, did the actual water collection.Stephens (1843:2:16) observed, ‘‘We noticed that there were no women, who,throughout Yucatán, are the drawers of water, and always seen around a well,but we were told that no woman ever enters the well of Chaac; all the water forthe rancho was procured by the men, which alone indicated that the well was ofan extraordinary character.’’Although many of the features within the caves of the Yalahau region ap-pear to focus attention on water, there is no reason to assume that the collectionof virgin water, as described by Thompson (1975), singularly characterized an-cient Maya cave use in the region. It is perhaps more reasonable—and consistentwith our increased understanding of Maya cave use—to envision the presenceof water in caves as creating a sacred environment (see Brady 1989:415; Bradyand Stone 1986:22; see also Brady 1997) in which a range of religious activitieswas conducted.The Cultural Context of Caves in the Yalahau RegionThe Yalahau Archaeological Cave Survey focused particular attention on thearea surrounding the site of El Naranjal and the secondary center of San Cosmé,which are linked by a 3-kilometer-longsacbe.These sites and their correspond-ing plaza groups and rural settlements are located in the southernmost portionof the Yalahau region. The site core of El Naranjal, oriented along a roughlynorth-south axis, is 1.2 kilometers in length and 0.4 kilometer in width and con-tains twenty-three major structures (see Fedick and Taube 1995). Studies at ElNaranjal suggest that the primary construction episode at the site, as well as itsperiod of greatest occupation, occurred during the Late Preclassic to Early Clas-sic Periods. This chronological assessment is based on the occurrence of early ce-"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"348The Maya Regionramic types, radiocarbon assays of charcoal samples extracted from constructionplaster (Mathews 1998), and the presence of the Megalithic architectural style(Mathews 1998; Taube 1995). A number of smaller sites in the southern Yalahauregion also exhibit evidence of a strong Late Preclassic/Early Classic occupation(Mathews 1995; Rissolo 1998; Taube 1995). Ceramics dating to the same periodwere recovered from the Gruta de Xcan (Márquez de González et al. 1982).Located approximately twenty kilometers west of El Naranjal in Yucatán, it isthe only reported cave site in the vicinity of the Yalahau survey area. The centerof El Naranjal and nearby sites appear to have been abandoned after the EarlyClassic and reoccupied during the Late Postclassic (Lorenzen 1995, 1999). Thislater phase is characterized, in part, by the construction of shrines and stairwayson the ruined monumental architecture of the site (Lorenzen 1995, 1999).The examination of caves in concert with regional archaeological investiga-tions of surface sites and features moreaccurately reveals patterns of cave useand the ways in which the Maya interacted with the landscape. Simply stated,the wider natural and cultural systems within which caves exist provide cluesto the nature and meaning of cave activities, the status of the individuals in-volved, the origin of those individuals, and the period during which those ac-tivities took place. Conversely, chronological and functional data recovered fromcaves can be integral components in the reconstruction of the ancient social,political, economic, and ideological organization of surface sites.This was amply demonstrated in the investigation of Actun Toh, which islocated 7.9 kilometers southwest of El Naranjal (see Figure 14.2). Directly belowthe entrance shaft of this dome-shaped cave is a 3.6-meter-high, roughly pyra-midal terraced structure (Figures 14.3 and 14.4). Although the structure is inan advanced state of disrepair, its well-dressed blocks clearly reflect the Mega-lithic construction style characteristic of the region’s early occupation. The ter-raced slope of the structure in Actun Toh terminates at a crude altar and arti-ficial floor. One of the pathways that lead away from this floor passes beneatha panel of simple carved faces (Figure 14.5) and down a stairway to a small,debris-filled pool (see Figure 14.6). This pattern will be discussed in greater de-tail below.We conducted controlled test excavations in Actun Toh in order to determinethe age of the floor. An analysis of the pottery from the deep but apparentlyhomogeneous subfloor construction fill reveals the presence of such Late Pre-classic groups as Tancah, Sierra, Nolo, and Xanabá. Protoclassic to Early Classictypes include Carolina Bichrome Incised and Sabán Burdo. The fact that thebasal riser of the pyramidal structure rests atop the floor, and given the structure’sdiagnostic stylistic attributes, it is likely that the architectonic modification ofthe cave occurred during the Early Classic. Additionally, the presence in thesubfloor fill of chronologically sensitive types such as Tituc Orange Polychrome"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"Figure 14.3.Terraced structure in ActunToh.

MiddlePreclassic ceramics are all but absent in the northern portion of the peninsula,including nearby surface sites, but are commonly found on the floors of caves inthe Yalahau region. Cave ceramics corresponding to the Nabanche complex (seeAndrews V 1988) also include Achiote, Chunhinta, Joventud, and Kin. Theirpresence provides a unique opportunity to examine not only early cave use, butalso the earliest of regional occupations.Late Classic ceramics have yet to be identified in any significant quantity atsurface sites, leading to the proposal that the region experienced a long hiatus(Fedick and Taube 1995:10; see also Mathews 1998:158–168). However, theyappear quite frequently in the region’s caves. In Actun Toh, we recovered a smallbut significant quantity of Late Classic Saxché Orange Polychrome sherds aswell as numerous Late to Terminal Classic Vista Alegre Striated sherds. A nearlywhole, Late Classic, Petkanche Orange Polychrome vase was found in ActunTacbi Ha, located 1.3 kilometers east of El Naranjal (Rissolo 1995; Figure 14.2).This cave also contained deposits of Terminal Classic Muna Slate and SacalúmBlack-on-slate.The apparent discrepancy between cave pottery and our current model of re-gional occupation could be explained if caves, such as Actun Toh, were focalpoints of ceremonial activity within an area of non-nucleated Late Classic to"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Beneath the Yalahau351Terminal Classic settlement.

No major ceremonial cave sites have yetbeen reported near the low-elevation site core of Coba, and it is conceivablethat residents of this Classic Period urban center could have traveled thirty-fivekilometers northeast toward the Yalahau region in search of suitable caves.With this in mind, it is apparent that a more complete story of the role ofcaves in Maya culture cannot be fully realized through archaeological cave in-vestigations alone, and that the archaeology of surface sites cannot be ignored.Suffice it to say that archaeological strategies necessary for the effective inves-tigation of cultural process at surface sites should be carried into the cave envi-ronment as well.Identification of Cultural Criteria for Cave SelectionIt is a fact of nature that no two caves are physically identical, yet our use of theterm ‘‘cave’’ to subsume all of these features suggests a rather monolithic rela-tionship between the Maya and these subterranean environments. At a certainlevel, the generalized concept of ‘‘cave’’ is valid and has meaning; however, theMaya were no doubt acutely aware of both the dramatic and the subtle physicalattributes of different caves. Moreover, they were likely conscious of the distri-bution of different ‘‘types’’ of caves across the landscape as well as caves’ spatialrelationships with local natural and cultural geography.A common form of cave that develops in the horizontally bedded limestoneof northern Quintana Roo is the collapse dome. These caves are characterizedby voluminous dome-shaped chambers, the ceilings of which are sometimesbreached in the center by narrow shafts leading up to the surface. A cave’s open-ing to the outside not only provides access to its interior, but also functions asa symbolic interface between the subterranean and the terrestrial worlds. En-trances can range from tiny holes barely wide enough to penetrate to gapingchasms. Actun Toh, Actun Tacbi Ha, and Actun Tam Ha exemplify the collapsedome form.An additional broad, quasi-taxonomic factor to consider, especially in rela-tion to collapse domes, is cave size. Stone (Chapter 10 here) mentions that caveswere unique in ancient Mesoamerica in that they offered people exposure tolarge enclosed spaces, which essentially did not exist in their built environment.This observation has powerful implications in terms of the dramatic contrastbetween caves and the surface world and the unparalleled sensory effects that"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"Beneath the Yalahau353caves must have impressed on those who visited them. There is little doubt thatthe expansive character of Actun Toh, for example, contributed to its apparentimportance. The caves of the Yalahau region are quite small in comparison tothe enormous caverns of the southern lowlands or the hills of western Yucatán.However, it is more meaningful to evaluate chamber size in relation to nearbycaves so that relative grandeur is measured only within a regional context. Thus,Actun Toh, regardless of its absolute size, must be recognized as one of the grandcaverns of the Yalahau region.The interface between collapse domes and the surface is subtle and mislead-ing in that the small entrances belie the enormity of the open space below. Need-less to say, access to such caves was difficult, and the ancient Maya were forcedto span large vertical distances with ropes or wooden ladders. Just as buildingscan serve as screens to control access to private plazas, challenging and natu-rally restrictive entrances limit casual interaction with certain caves. Thus, thesame desire to conceal space in ceremonial architecture may have motivated theancient Maya to select and appropriate such caves for restricted use.Early on, Thompson (1959:122) pointed out the significance of cave accessbut did not explore the aesthetic and symbolic qualities of cave entrances thatappear to reflect (or complement) the Maya perception of space. As he men-tions, the importance of restricted access is also evident in the artificial reduc-tion of cave entrances. In Actun Haleb, located 4.5 kilometers southeast of ElNaranjal, a crude terrace was constructed at the mouth of the cave that effec-tively reduced the size of its entrance. Blom and La Farge (1926:156) identifiedsimilar modifications in Zapo Cave, as did Seler (1901:162) at Quen Santo andCarot (1989) in the Alta Verapaz. Perhaps small, vertical portals like that ofActun Toh were especially valued for their natural ability to provide a sharp anddramatic transition between physical and ideological realms.In their discussion of elite activities at Naj Tunich, Brady and Stone (1986:23) raise a relevant question: Why, if caves were such an important part ofancient Maya worldview, do so few caves exhibit the ‘‘formal vocabulary’’ ofelites. They suggest that by invoking the concept of the cave in site architecture,Maya elites did not consider it necessary to venture into the physical cave envi-ronment, which thus attributes evidence of extensive and intensive cave use tomostly non-elite individuals. Increased documentation of the relationship be-tween caves and monumental architecture has altered this idea significantly (seeBrady 1997; Brady et al. 1997a; Martos López 1997). In the Yalahau region, itis possible that the art, architecture, and offerings found in the caves might verywell represent the ‘‘formal,’’ or elite, vocabulary of the ancient Maya of north-ern Quintana Roo. Moreover, the naturally restrictive and culturally restrictedaccess to certain caves suggests their exclusivity.As in the case of Actun Toh, the presence of relatively sophisticated archi-"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"354The Maya Regiontectural modifications and a rich ceramic assemblage are likely a result of thespecial status ascribed to the cave’s physiography. Therefore, it appears that, inthis instance, cave geomorphology determined the social aspects of cave utiliza-tion, because the cave combined a number of features that were important to theancient Maya. For example, all three collapse domes share the mound-stairway-pool configuration, which takes advantage of the caves’ physical environment.Size cross-culturally connotes grandeur and power, so it is noteworthy that thecollapse domes also represented the largest enclosed spaces in the region. Finally,the entrances are naturally restrictive, which contributed to further cultural con-straints. For all these reasons, it appears that the elite specifically appropriatedcollapse domes, with physical and architectural modifications standing as a tes-timonial to this appropriation.Rockshelters as CavesIn attempting to study ancient Maya cave use, it is important to mention thatthe geologic definition of ‘‘cave’’ (or ‘‘cenote,’’ for that matter) has little mean-ing within the context of this discussion and can obfuscate our understanding ofthe Maya appropriation of underground spaces. Recent ethnolinguistic studieshave explored the emic classification of caves and related topographic features(e.g., Brady 1997; Brady and Ashmore 1999; Brown, Chapter 15 here; see alsoVogt and Stuart, Chapter 7 here), and it is clear that the Maya concept of ‘‘cave’’includes a number of features not included in our Western concept. While se-mantic analyses among the modern Maya are important in steering the directionof research, it remains for archaeologists to document the palpable evidence ofunderground utilization in order to define the boundaries of the ancient Mayaconcept of ‘‘cave.’’At least in archaeology, caves and rockshelters tend to be dichotomized asgeologically and functionally different types of sites. Straus (1990:256) says, ‘‘Acloser look reveals that these two categories [caves and rockshelters] are quitedifferent in terms of their formation and infilling, and that each of them in turnis made up of a wide variety of phenomena.’’ Nevertheless, it must be recognizedthat the Maya emic classification of these features might be quite different. Un-fortunately, the linguistic data from modern Maya groups is not clear on whetherrockshelters were consistently classified and used as caves (Brady 1997:603). TheYalahau Archaeological Cave Survey attempted to address this issue directly byinvestigating five rockshelters within the study area.We identified architectural features in each of the five rockshelters includedin the survey. Actun Xooch, the most intensively modified rockshelter in thesurvey, is essentially a large sinkhole with a semicircular alcove along its periph-"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Beneath the Yalahau355ery. A crudely terraced slope leads down to the floor of the sinkhole. Extend-ing from the base of the slope is a raised causeway or floor that supports a lowoffertory platform. This rectangular platform, which consists of two courses ofroughly dressed blocks, is connected to the back wall of the alcove and is posi-tioned beneath a narrow shaft leading to the surface. Items found at the base ofthe offertory platform include a tiny unslipped biconical cup and fragments ofa Postclassic Chen Mul censer—including what appear to be modeled ceramiccacao pods. In Actun Maas, a small rockshelter located 2.7 kilometers southeastof El Naranjal, we found censer fragments adjacent to a crude stone altar thatwas placed beneath a prominent flowstone formation.Clearly, rockshelters were fully incorporated into a generalized emic conceptof ‘‘cave’’—even in a region where deeper and darker caves exist. Our inclu-sion of rockshelters in the classification of caves rests not only on the similari-ties between their material remains and those of cave sites, but also on the rec-ognition of physical similarities between rockshelters and caves. In addition totheir shared trait of openings in the earth’s surface, both rockshelters and cavescontain natural phenomena, particularly speleothems, which do not exist else-where in the natural world. In other words, the Maya perceived of rocksheltersas having more in common with caves than with other natural features. Further-more, my data suggest that the ancient Maya did not rely solely on such traits asdarkness, complete enclosure, and remoteness to determine whether to appro-priate an underground space. However, the naturally extroverted configurationof rockshelters, their smaller size, and their lack of water may have resulted ina more non-elite type of ritual use.By certain measures, a rockshelter like Actun Maas and a collapse dome likeActun Toh represent opposite ends of a morphological cave continuum in theYalahau region. The shape of a cave and the way in which it presents itself tothe surface are highly variable. Rather than attempt to quantitatively classify ordefine caves, it seems more reasonable to apply an anthropocentric approach toour evaluation of underground spaces. In doing so, we can appreciate the com-plex nature of human interaction with these environments.Be that as it may, the sacredness of a cave was not necessarily determined byits size. The narrow, artificial caves at Utatlan in Highland Guatemala (Brady1991; Brady and Veni 1992) and the shallow Dzibichen in eastern Yucatán (Stone1995:74–86) attest to this fact and are considered to be sacred places today.The massive volume of enclosed space characteristic of a number of caves in theYalahau region may indeed have been a factor in their selection for a particu-lar type of elaboration, but this does not exclude smaller caves from intensiveceremonial use. For example, the shallowest, brightest, driest rockshelter andthe deepest, darkest, wettest cavern share powerful ideological associations, re-gardless of their disparate physiographical characteristics. First and foremost,"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"356The Maya Regionboth function as ‘‘entry points’’ into the subsurface world (Brady 1997:603). Ithas been demonstrated that even human-made caves (found in both karstic andnonkarstic regions) belonged to this sacred realm (Brady and Veni 1992; see alsoBarba P. et al. 1990; Heyden 1975, 1981).Cave ResourcesIn addition to a cave’s dimensional and locational attributes, the presence of ex-tractable resources was no doubt a factor in both its selection and the nature anddegree of its utilization. Paramount among these material criteria was water.The relative abundance of surface water in the Yalahau region notwithstand-ing, the preoccupation with this scarce resource among the Maya of Yucatánand northern Quintana Roo has left an indelible mark on secular and religioustradition over the course of generations and across the peninsula. The wealthof ethnohistorical and ethnographic evidence that attests to the ubiquity andimportance of the cave-dwelling Yucatec rain deities (chako’ob) and cave-relatedfertility ceremonies need not be reviewed here. There is little doubt, however,that the enduring prominence of Chaak in the northern lowlands is likely aresult of regional geographic and climatic conditions. Since caves in generalare strongly associated with rain and fertility (see Brady 1989:42–53), and thepreciousness of water is so heavily emphasized in the northern lowlands, then,clearly, one would expect there to be a special relationship with those caves thatcontain water.The signs of human activity present in each of the water-bearing caves in thesurvey suggest that pools were a major focus of attention. (The spatial relation-ships between cultural features and pools are discussed in the following section.)The physical dimensions of pools do not appear to have been an important con-cern of the ancient Maya, and there does not seem to be a correlation betweenpool size and degree of cultural activity. Even among the modern Maya of theYalahau region, a cave need only provide access to the water table (via the small-est of pools) in order to be classified as ach’e’enorts’ono’ot(cenote) and to receivethe special attention befitting a watery place.Simply the presence of water in a cave was important, as was the process of itsextraction. In addition to leaving behind offerings and rock art, which markedwet caves as sacred spaces, the ancient Maya of the Yalahau were involved inactivities that ensured the continued availability of cave water. Surrounding thesmall pool in Actun Toh is a mound of debris that represents successive pool-maintenance episodes.

This practice has long since been abandoned in ActunToh, and during the survey project, the pool appeared to be nonexistent (leadingto the original assumption that the cave was dry). An archaeological excava-tion of the accumulated debris revealed the water table below. This practice ofancient cave maintenance was also identified in Pak Ch’en, where the periodicremoval of debris continues.As with the drawing of water from the Gruta de Chac, the maintenance ac-tivities noted above might have been highly ritualized affairs, judging from thedescription of similar activities in Zinacantan. Springs, often located in caves,are vital water sources around which social groups form. Lineages take theirname from their water holes, and myths tell how the group received access to thewater in exchange for cleaning and caring for the spring (Vogt 1976:99). Whilewater holes are generally the domain of women, the cleaning is done exclusivelyby men, and no women are present (Vogt 1976:102). The cleaning crews in-cludemayordomosand shamans, and musicians play during the work. Bricker(1973:114) has recorded some of the ritual humor that accompanies the clean-ing. Once again, the gender inversion noted by both Stephens and Vogt atteststo the nonquotidian aspects of water-source maintenance.In Actun Tsub, a natural aperture in the cave floor reveals a large pool eightmeters below. This opening was artificially augmented to facilitate a rope-and-bucket retrieval method. Additionally, a vertical shaft was chipped through thebedrock directly above the enlarged mouth of the well so that people on the sur-face could easily procure water. Such evidence is a clear indication of the impor-tance of cave water collection—perhaps more so than of broken pottery vessels,whose presence can be explained in other ways.In addition to the artificial shaft in Actun Tsub, a natural entrance providesaccess to the cave interior. This arrangement is similar to the cenotes at Telcha-quillo and Mani, as illustrated by Brainerd (1958:Maps 9 and 12, respectively).The pools in both cenotes can be accessed from the surface via vertical shafts(marked by collars) or by descending into the cave itself via secondary entrances.Thompson (1975:xxi) provides an ethnographic description that appears to re-late to this in noting that ‘‘the holy water used in baptism by the Maya of Quin-tana Roo is fetched from a secluded opening to the town cenote to which womennever come.’’ This suggests that some cenotes had both private and public (i.e.,sacred and profane) aspects. Redfield and Villa Rojas describe how the pursuitof remote and sacred cave water is the task of men (1934:139), while ‘‘the rim ofthe cenote is a woman’s precinct’’ (1934:70). The drawing of water from differ-ent parts of the same cenote or cave may have been the result of gender divisionsin Yucatec Maya society. Interestingly, in the ethnographic cases, both womenand men used the same water source, but the manner in which the water wascollected affected its perceived qualities."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"358The Maya RegionAncient mounds are located in the immediate vicinity of seven of the eightwater-bearing caves in the survey. It appears that such wet caves were impor-tant landmarks in the cultural geography of the region and were likely the focusof territorial organization and control. This is well illustrated by an unnamedcave north of Actun Toh whose vertical entrance lies within a small plaza, andActun Tsub is less than two hundred meters from a major Megalithic buildingplatform at El Naranjal.A cave need not possess a pool to be a site of water collection. Two of theshallow, dry rockshelters in the survey containhaltunes,which were placed be-neath the drip line (Figure 14.7). These stone troughs were reported early on byMercer (1896:Figs. 5, 39) and are quite common in caves across the northernlowlands. Ceramic vessels positioned beneath dripping stalactites have been re-ported in deeper caves throughout the Maya area (see McNatt 1996:85–86; seealso Thompson 1975:xv–xxii). Thompson (1975:xx; see also 1959:125) rightlyasserts that such vessels were likely intended to collect virgin water (zuhuy ha)for ritual purposes rather than for drinking. He mentions the site of Las Cuevasin Belize (1975:xviii–xix), where the stream outside a cave would have been amore practical source of drinking water than the dripping stalactites locateddeep within the cave’s interior. The availability of noncave water in the Yala-hau region presents an analogous situation and serves as an eloquent statementregarding the preciousness of cave water.The breakage and manipulation of speleothems has received increased atten-tion from archaeologists and is the focus of a detailed review and study by Bradyet al. (1997b). Stalactites and stalagmites, which were erected as monumentsoutside of caves, cached at surface sites, and used in altar construction withincaves themselves, were imbued with sacred qualities and likely functioned asportable symbols of the caves’ power.The practice of speleothem removal and breakage was identified in nearlyevery cave in the survey. Contrary to the findings of Brady et al. (1997b), in-tensive breakage was recorded both near and far from cave entrances. It shouldbe noted, however, that the caves in the Yalahau region are typically single-chambered affairs, and the entrance is usually visible from all areas of the cave.Nevertheless, a number of caves, such as Actun Tsub, have been almost com-pletely denuded. Soda straws can be seen hanging from the stumps of earlierstalactites, which have since been removed from the cave (Figure 14.8). Quiteoften, even the smallest of speleothems in the most inaccessible of alcoves hasbeen removed. This latter discovery lends support to the ceremonial value ofmore remote speleothems suggested by Brady et al. (1997b:727–728).The most compelling evidence for the sacred nature of speleothems is theirinclusion in ceremonial contexts (see Brady et al. 1997b:736–740).

Thereis little doubt that additional excavations associated with both civic-ceremonialand domestic structures throughout the region (combined with a watchful eye)will establish the practice of speleothem caching as a common cave-related tra-dition.It is unclear whether or not utilitarian activities account for at least some per-centage of the speleothems removed from caves in the Yalahau region. Certainly,their apparent ‘‘harvesting’’ from several caves begs for a satisfactory explana-tion. Even though speleothems represent a finite resource, their use as a sourceof calcite temper for pottery manufacture (also discussed but not endorsed byBrady et al. 1997b) cannot be entirely ruled out without further investigation.However, the economic need for calcite (in lieu of pedogenic sources) would notexplain the massive speleothem fragments lying on the floor of Actun Tacbi Ha.Also of interest in Actun Tacbi Ha (see Figure 14.9) is the use of speleothems forthe construction of a stairway in the cave (Rissolo 1995). Such a use, however,should not be considered utilitarian in nature, as the stairway was apparentlyused for the ritual procurement of water from a small cave pool.Not all caves in the Yalahau region are (or were) rich in speleothems.

We recorded three mining areas in Actun Toh—each reachedby a clearly marked path. The largest of these is an enclosed room, which isseparated from the main chamber by a low passage. Interbedded strata of poorlylithified dolomite and more-resistant limestone layers are visible in the walls ofthe room. The soft, white dolomitic powder was easily mined and removed; thesubsequently protruding limestone shelves were broken off and piled along thesides of the room’s entrance path. Pits in the floor suggest that the room’s expan-sion was vertical as well as horizontal. It appears that the room itself (measuringroughly four meters in diameter and two meters high) was artificially created bythis process. If so, as much as seventeen cubic meters of material was removed.While it appears that a considerable proportion of the cavities created bymining in Actun Toh are ancient, evidence of more recent mining is clear. Visibleon the walls of the largest mining pit are the unmistakable scars of a modern steelpick. When I consulted with my local guide on the matter, he was unable to offeran explanation but simply confirmed the obvious: that if the material was minedand removed for use assascab,the miner would have saved himself trouble andeffort by simply making use of one of the many nearbysascaberasat the surface.The guide’s reaction is equally telling of what an impractical and economicallyinefficient source forsascabthe cave might have been in antiquity. A yet-to-berevealed ceremonial use seems a more likely explanation, and perhaps this lineof inquiry might be pursued in future research.By examining activities such as speleothem removal, mining, or water collec-tion from an intraregional perspective, it becomes clear that the ancient Mayaventured into different caves for a variety of reasons. Just as the region’s ancientinhabitants were aware of unique ecological zones (e.g., areas of deep or fertilesoil, naturalbajos,well-drained uplands), they were likely knowledgeable aboutthe individual physical characteristicsof each cave. To some degree, each cave(as a natural entity) represented a unique place that both intersected and alignedwith the system of meanings thrust on it by the ancient Maya.Spatial Organization of the Cave EnvironmentI have discussed the importance of pools in caves and have introduced their as-sociation with subsurface architectural constructions in the Yalahau region, yetwe have not fully explored the patterned spatial relationships between naturaland cultural features in caves. In all of the water-bearing caves in the survey, thepools appear to have structured the nature of human activity between the en-"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"362The Maya RegionFigure 14.10.Rock art panel in Pak Ch’en containing a rain god image and vulva motifs.Drawn by the author.trance and the pool itself. Furthermore, the natural layout of caves has directedor channeled human interaction with cave space. This pattern is then reinforcedby cultural modifications to cave environments.If one descends into Actun Toh, a stairway leads down the pyramidal struc-ture and into an enclosed natural room (from which there is a single exit). Moreshort stairways and landings guide the visitor beneath a panel of carved facesand ultimately arrive at the pool. I observed an identical arrangement in Xca’ca’Ch’en, just over the border in Yucatán. Here, a beautifully constructed stairwayleads past similar faces and terminates at the entrance to a well, deep withinthe cave. Such stairways are also present in the cenotes of Mayapán (see Smith1953; see also Brown, Chapter 15 here) and in caves along the Quintana Roocoast (see Martos López 1994).Perhaps the most impressive expression of this pattern in the Yalahau regioncan be found at Pak Ch’en, where a stairway descends into the cave and guidesthe visitor along an extensive panel of carved images. Located on a boulder adja-cent to the path is a profile of a figure that has been identified by Taube as God C.Taube’s description of God C (1992:30) suggests that his image in Pak Ch’enmay have been intended to designate the cave as a sacred place. Nearby is a figurethat appears to exhibit both Chaak and Tlaloc features, which Taube describesas a common Late Postclassic development in rain god imagery (Figure 14.10).Surrounding this figure are at least nine distinct vulva motifs. The depiction"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"Beneath the Yalahau363of female genitalia often appears at rock art sites throughout Mesoamerica (seeApostólides 1987:175–177; Stone 1995:74–86; Strecker 1987; see also Brady1989:42–53). Rands (1955:343–344) notes that water is conceptually associatedwith the genital area. The association of rain god imagery with vulva motifs isalso found in Dzibichen (Stone 1995:74–86), which contains a similar stairway-pool arrangement. Here, vulva motifs, lightning serpents, and a codex-style de-piction of Chaak appear together on the cave wall. In Pak Ch’en, the pathwayterminates at a small pool. Located directly above the pool is a strikingly realis-tic rendering of a vagina, which no doubt marks the spot as a watery, womblike,and fertile place—the sacred epicenter of the cave.The use of space inside a cave for the purpose of focusing attention on waterreflects a degree of specialized effort that supersedes the strictly utilitarian ex-ploitation of this important resource. This is evident not only in the deliberatepositioning of stairways and rock art, but also in the creation of relatively sophis-ticated architectural features. Ceremonial architecture is not uncommon in cavesin the Maya area. The platform in Cenote X-Coton (Smith 1953) and the minia-ture temples in the Cueva de Satachannah (Martos López 1994:77) and AktunNa Kan (Leira Guillermo and Terrones González 1986) are telling examples ofthe transposition of ceremonial architecture into the cave environment as wellas the very system of meanings attached to such an activity.A close evaluation of the terraced structure in Actun Toh reveals that it is,in fact, a pyramid. Although it makes use of a natural slope and appears to bepyramidal only from a limited field of view, the mound’s terraced façade suf-ficiently represents the power inherent in such a structure. I would argue thatthe presence of the pyramid in Actun Toh is significant for two related reasons:first, the structure complements the sanctity of this grand underground cham-ber; second, it harnesses the potency of the humanly controlled, built environ-ment. In Actun Toh we see the symbolic expression of human authority over thenatural environment, just as natural forces are ‘‘captured’’ by the constructionof ceremonial architecture (Stone 1992). Perhaps in this conceptual inversion,the cave/temple within the mountain/pyramid becomes the mountain/pyramidwithin the cave/temple.I have no doubt that the replication of ‘‘cognized spatial models’’ (Stone,Chapter 10 here) aptly characterizes the positioning of cultural features withincaves. The arrangement of structures, pathways, altars, and imagery and theplacement of votive offerings in caves of the Yalahau region are noticeably pat-terned and deliberate. However, I would stress that, because of the physicallybounded nature of caves, the imposition or mediation of spatial order is, at somelevel, categorically different from such ordering at the surface. Irrespective ofthe generalized concept of ‘‘cave’’ alluded to earlier, caves do not provide theirhuman agents with a clean slate or an empty canvas on which to transcribe cos-"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"364The Maya Regionmic order. More so than in the less-bounded spaces of the surface world, thephysiography or natural layout of a cave will significantly influence, if not dic-tate, spatial ordering. The discretionary reading of caves in some way accountsfor the architectural alteration of water-bearing caves like Actun Toh but also forthe placement of shrines or offerings near prominent speleothems in the region’scaves. If, to some degree, function follows form, then the imposition of spatialmodels as described by Stone (Chapter 10) is no less meaningful or affective,but, rather, more fluid in nature.Perhaps the ancient Maya perceived an inherent natural order in caves. Inother words, the cave may have served as a metaphor for the built environment,just as we believe certain ceremonial buildings functioned as metaphorical caves.This can best be understood in terms of the reciprocal nature of metaphors asdescribed by Houston, which ‘‘allows us to resolve such questions by acknowl-edging the indissoluble, almost playful associations between semantic domains’’(1998:355). The semiotics of modern Western speleological terminology can berevealing and provide a structuralist conceptual framework in which to exam-ine the relationships between the ancient Maya and the cave environment. Ourlexicon makes use of such architectural terms as ‘‘wall,’’ ‘‘ceiling,’’ ‘‘terrace,’’ ‘‘bal-cony,’’ ‘‘column,’’ ‘‘shelf,’’ or ‘‘alcove’’ to describe natural cave features. This mayreveal an anthropocentric tendency to define space on a human scale, whereinflat places become floors, enclosed spaces become rooms, and constricted spacesbecome entryways. Furthermore, our use of such terminology is suggestive of animpulse to cognize caves as both otherworldlyandfamiliar, or perhaps to rec-oncile the disparity between realms by finding the familiarinthe otherworldly.Certainly, the architectural enclosure of natural ‘‘rooms,’’ which can be seen inthe caves of the Alta Verapaz (Carot 1989), in Actun Balam (Pendergast 1969),and in Naj Tunich (Brady 1989), indicates that such spaces were at least per-ceived as inherently roomlike in some way.The question emerges of whether caves represent the order of ‘‘community’’or the chaos of ‘‘wilderness’’ (Stone 1995:15–18). Stone skillfully negotiates theliterature on Mesoamerican sacred geography and attempts to find the place-ment of caves within binary models of reality. She offers as an example (1995:16)the Yucatecan concepts ofkaah,‘‘town or inhabited space,’’ andk’aax,‘‘forest’’(as described by Hanks 1990:306). It would appear that the essentially dichoto-mous spatial mapping of Maya reality assigns caves to the realm of wild anddisordered space.Stone’s evaluation is compelling and well supported ethnographically; never-theless, I would argue that caves should not necessarily be considered contra-dictory or antithetical to ordered space, as Stone suggests (1995:16). I have nodoubt that caves were, to a significant degree, considered wild places and weresubjected to the reactive imposition of spatial models (as described by Stone,"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"Beneath the Yalahau365Chapter 10 here). However, the Maya recognition and appropriation of a cave’snatural ability to mimic the built environment suggests that the notion of teleo-logically conceived space coexisted (but was not necessarily congruent) with theperception of cave as wilderness.I should stress that these interpretations are based on a comparative study inan area that is relatively new to cave archaeology. The proposal of a more flex-ible model with respect to the conception of cave space is essentially the resultof observations conducted in caves within this region.ConclusionsTo better understand the relationship between caves and the ancient Maya, itis necessary to look beyond a single cave and to evaluate a range of natural andcultural features both within caves and across the landscape. Emerging patternsof cave use revealed by research in the Yalahau region underscore the impor-tance of caves as sacred space. This is particularly noteworthy in northern Yuca-tán, where attention tends to focus on caves/cenotes as utilitarian water sources.The high water-table in the Yalahau region, which allowed shallow natural andartificial wells to replace the cenote as the critical water source, enabled theYalahau Archaeological Cave Survey to isolate the ritual function of caves andseparate it from the function as a water source. The extensive utilization of thecaves for ceremonial purposes documents the fundamental ritual importance ofthese landmarks. The survey’s findings suggest that similar patterns of ritual useshould be present in caves in other areas as well.While cave water sources do not appear to have been critical to the mainte-nance of human life, the Yalahau survey demonstrates that the presence of waterin a cave was a matter of paramount importance. Water sources were the focusof ritual activity even where long, arduous crawls were required to reach verymodestly sized pools. In some caves, we encountered evidence of regular mainte-nance, and rock art marked the presence of many of the pools. Thus, the region’sancient inhabitants were clearly intent on locating, marking, and transformingwater sources. These findings provide convincing evidence for the cosmologicalsignificance of water.Despite their individual morphologies, all caves appear to have embodiedpart of a widespread system of cultural meanings. However, research in the Yala-hau region appears to demonstrate that natural characteristics such as entranceshape, the presence of water, and cavern size were factors in the selection andappropriation of certain subterranean spaces for particular uses. The size of threeof the most voluminous collapse domes in the study area appears to have beenone of the principal factors in the selection of these caves for substantial elabo-"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"366The Maya Regionration. Entrance form was clearly significant as well. Narrow, vertical portalslike that of Actun Tacbi Ha concealed and controlled entry into these massivechambers.The investigation of a large number of caves within a single region is im-portant in presenting a range of cave morphologies that provide insights intoancient emic categories. Archaeologists typically make a distinction betweencaves and rockshelters, but the evidence suggests that the latter were fully inte-grated into the Maya concept of ‘‘cave.’’ All rockshelters we explored containedarchitectural modifications; several contained censer fragments and evidenceof speleothem breakage and removal. While rockshelters functioned as moreopen and accessible sacred places, the ancient Maya clearly perceived them ascaves.Viewing a large number of caves also suggests new interpretations of theinterplay between the subsurface replication of terrestrial domains and the in-clusion of caves into the controlled realm of the built environment. Clearly, ar-chitectural modifications on the scale of Actun Toh make strong political andsocial statements about the cave’s relative importance and its specialized and re-stricted use. Perhaps more important, these investigations provide compellingevidence for the conceptual and physical transfiguration of caves into orderedenvironments.The Yalahau Archaeological Cave Survey also noted that the Maya were ex-tracting resources from caves. However, the principles of economic efficiencydo not adequately fit the cases of cave mining, speleothem extraction, or waterdrawing to make a plausible case that these were utilitarian activities. Onceagain, the sacred origin of these objects or materials transcends their physicalproperties.The study of caves within their greater regional context, which includes sur-face sites and all cavelike topographic features, facilitates the identification ofsuch cultural patterning across time and space. Moreover, caves can be exposedas diverse in their physiography and use, yet retain their place in the unifyingconcept of sacred underground domains. Research in the Yalahau region demon-strates that caves were geographically and ideologically integrated environmentsthat were linked physically and symbolically to the cosmic and terrestrial realmsof the ancient Maya.AcknowledgmentsThe 1995–2000 field seasons of the Yalahau Archaeological Cave Survey weresupported in part by grants from the Anders Foundation, the Cave ResearchFoundation, the National Speleological Society, and the Graduate Division of"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"Beneath the Yalahau367the University of California, Riverside.

The city was the seat of a ‘‘joint government’’ (mul tepal),or political confederacy, that ruled a regional state for about two hundred years(ca.ad1250–1450) before the Spanish conquest of Yucatán in 1542. Accordingto native and Spaniard alike, the founding, governance, and collapse of the cityformed the most dramatic and singular topic in Maya history at the time of theSpanish conquest; in the chronicles, the rise and fall of Mayapán overshadowedall other preconquest historical events.Archaeologically, it is easy to see that Mayapán was a primate center in theregional settlement pattern: no other contemporary site in the Maya Lowlandsapproaches it in size. Because of its political and economic status, Mayapánprobably dominated all aspects of art and literature as well (Love 1994:8–13).The ruins of the city lie some 40 kilometers south-southeast of Mérida, Yuca-tán (Figure 15.1). The archaeological site measures 4.2 square kilometers in-side its 9-kilometer-long defensive wall, within which over four thousand an-cient structures are densely packed. The spatial organization of those structures,and especially how they relate to the natural landscape, is the theme of thischapter.Mayapán lies on a great limestone plain that has developed a distinctivekarstic topography and hydrology. Certainly no greater natural influence on an-cient Maya settlement patterns ever existed. The structure of the karst deter-mined where water was available in an arid environment. The character of thekarst also controlled where suitable land was available for residence. Through-out their history, the Maya had a preference for building their houses on highground, where good drainage and a cool breeze were to be found. The karst land-scape, therefore, governed the pattern of habitable land and the placement of"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"Figure 15.1.Yucatán, with location of Mayapán andother archaeological sites. Drawn byLynn Berg."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Caves, Karst, and Settlement at Mayapán, Yucatán375water sources; consequently, it controlled the underlying pattern of settlementwithin and among communities.Because the character of the karst varies across the peninsula for a number ofreasons, including climatic variation and structural geology, so too did the natu-ral strictures on ancient Maya settlement. Since the sociological, economic, andpolitical facts of Maya society varied across the peninsula for equally compli-cated reasons, the result is an endlessly complex interplay of nature and culture,of theme and variation.In this chapter, I explore one example of this patterned variation: how theMaya adapted the social, aesthetic, and religious aspects of their settlement atMayapán to the karstic landscape. The results of the inquiry are of interest notonly because Mayapán was one of the great historical capitals of Maya civili-zation, but also because some patterns found at Mayapán occur at other Mayacities.Residential Settlement and Karst GeomorphologyDespite the extensive literature on Lowland Maya settlement patterns and ar-chitecture, relatively little progress has been made in describing the distributionof settlement across the landscape. A glance at almost any archaeological sitemap demonstrates that the Maya preferred to build on high ground, an observa-tion also made by the early Spanish colonists (de la Garza et al. 1983:218). Be-yond that, and beyond the obvious fact that residential architecture occurred invarious types of groups or clusters, the spatial characteristics of intrasite settle-ment have not been specified successfully in any detail. Although excellent mapsof a few Maya sites exist, no one has created an accurate formal model of settle-ment within a site. Some scholars think that the settlement pattern was partlyrandom (A. Smith 1962:205); that belief is at least partly false.At Mayapán, a multitude of small artificial terraces take advantage of thecontours of the land to expand the flat living space of the hills and ridges. Theseconstructions are not random, because they relate systematically to the land-scape. Accordingly, the morphology of the karst terrain played a role in de-termining the distribution of the residential architecture. To understand thesettlement patterns, therefore, one must describe and understand the underlyingtopography.The distribution of water sources at the site played an equally important rolein the organization settlement at the site. In and around Mayapán, water occursonly in solution caverns and collapse dolines, more often in the former. Collapsedolines only occasionally reach base level; sometimes they are associated withsolution caves that do extend down to the water table. A. L. Smith thought there"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"376The Maya Regionwas a correlation between the density of settlement and the location of watersources at Mayapán; according to him, the densest settlement occurred aroundthe largest numbers of cenotes (1962:210–211).Karst is a varied and complex phenomenon. It is ‘‘terrain with distinctive hy-drology and landforms arising from a combination of high rock solubility andwell developed secondary porosity’’ (Ford and Williams 1989:1; cf. Jennings1985:1). Karst exhibits distinctive morphology at many scales, from tiny micro-karren (measuring less than one centimeter) to regional structures that measuremany square kilometers in extent. This patterned variation across many ordersof magnitude is fractal. Both genetic and morphological taxonomies have beendeveloped to describe and explain the many varieties of karstic forms. Geolo-gists and geographers (e.g., Dunning 1992:13–20; Miller 1982) have appliedthese typologies to limited portions of the Maya Lowlands. Unlike in some partsof the lowlands, such as the Bolonchen district, where kegelkarst predominates(Dunning 1992:16), the terrain at Mayapán resists simple classification.Williams (1972:772–773) calls the closest taxonomic equivalent to the mor-phology of the Mayapán karst ‘‘ridge karst.’’ Ridge karst is a variant of tropicalcockpit karst in which the cones between the cockpits appear more as culmi-nations on ridges than as isolated hills (Williams 1972:772). The scale of thispattern at Mayapán is small. The range in elevation is approximately five meters.The ridges meander eccentrically between solution dolines and are topped bysmall peaks that range in elevation from twenty-seven to twenty-nine meters(in the system of elevations given on the map; true elevations are about eightmeters lower [ Jones 1952:3–4]).This morphology is caused by denudation of the surface rock through solu-tion, corrosion, and corrasion, not collapse. Collapse dolines do occur at thesite, but are morphologically distinct from the ubiquitous solution dolines thatcreate the cockpits in the ridge karst. Collapse features are steep-sided, theyare often associated with solution caverns, and they often approach base level(around thirteen meters below the surface). Furthermore, the origin and evolu-tion of solution dolines is now well documented (Ford and Williams 1989:399–405; Jennings 1985:114–118), and it is widely acknowledged that they are notcaused by collapse.Geologists long supposed that karsts were chaotic, a random jumble of col-lapse and solution features (Ford and Williams 1989:422). Since the early 1970s,however, karst geomorphologists have demonstrated that this is not the case(Day 1978; Ford and Williams 1989:418–423; Jennings 1985:114–123; Troesteret al. 1984; Williams 1972). These researchers have employed morphometricmethods to show that karst features, including collapse and solution dolines andresidual towers and pinnacles, tend to have nonrandom spatial distributions. Thenonrandomness of the distribution is caused, first, by structural controls on the"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"Caves, Karst, and Settlement at Mayapán, Yucatán377solution and corrosion processes and, second, by spatial competition that limitsthe size and shape of solution features. For example, solution dolines normallyform around drainpipes that draw surface runoff into the subsurface hydrologi-cal system. The pipes tend to develop along joints and fractures in the limestone.The joints and fractures, in turn, often are distributed with some uniformity,because they are created by processes with geometric outcomes, such as, for ex-ample, stresses to which the rock responds by sheering or cracking systemati-cally in patterns dependent on its lithology. As the dolines become more numer-ous and grow, they press against each other, eventually limiting their size andgrowth. Ultimately, the whole surface is fully occupied by solution dolines. Assolution continues, only ridges, pinnacles, or mogotes remain before the surfaceis fully denuded. Thus, a genetic model of their development can explain theuniformity of the spatial distribution of surficial solution features.If the distribution of solution features were nonrandom at Mayapán, it wouldcarry important implications for the apparently chaotic distribution of resi-dential architecture. Elsewhere (Brown 1999:157–160), I have used nearest-neighbor analysis to show that the spatial distribution of residual knolls(b’uu’tun) is not statistically random at Mayapán, but, instead, tends toward uni-formity.The distribution of known cenotes at the site also appears to be patterned( Jones 1952; Figure 15.2). This begs the question, however, of the actual numberof cenotes and their locations. By ‘‘cenotes,’’ I mean watering places, because atMayapán these are often solution caverns with water in them; they may or maynot be associated with classic collapse dolines (Figures 15.3–15.8). A few, suchas X-te-Toloc, do not now have water in them, but appear to have held waterin the recent past. Even those cenotes that have collapse dolines, such as Ch’enMul, Itzmal Ch’en, and Ch’en Max, also have caves; frequently, it is the cave,rather than the doline, that reaches the modern water table. Locally, the termch’e’en(‘‘well’’) is used to denote such ‘‘caves-with-water-in-them,’’ rather than‘áaktun,the common Yucatec word for ‘‘cave.’’ In fact, the wordch’e’enis usedfor all natural water sources in the area, regardless of whether they are collapsedolines or caves, except for the lakes of the ‘‘cenote zone.’’The Carnegie Institution archaeologists asserted that there were twenty-sixcenotes within the city wall on the map of the site (A. Smith 1962:210, 265). Ihave been able to find only twenty-three on the final site map (Pollock 1957),but this is only one of several problems in estimating the total number of ce-notes at the site. I have identified one cenote at the site that does not appearon the Carnegie map (the unnamed cenote in Square P of Figure 15.2). It isnot clear why the Carnegie Institution archaeologists named certain cenotes butnot others. Caves apparently were not systematically investigated to determinewhether they held water—the only distinction between caves and cenotes.

The north entrance has a stairway, while the southern oneis a precipitous hole in the ground (Figures 15.3 and 15.4).Similarly, Cenote Zuytun Cab is marked as having four entrances, one ofwhich is indicated as having water. In reality, the four mouths lead to three ce-notes, one of which appears to be dry today, but which clearly held water in thepast. The other two cenotes contain large pools of water.

The tunnel is not passable now, but a breeze through it suggests thepresence of another entrance, now partially sealed, which probably was the mainaccess in antiquity. The mouth of the tunnel may be in one of the dolines southof the cenote. So, the map indicates one cenote where there are actually three.Moreover, one entrance is apparently lost.It is also known that some cenotes have been intentionally sealed, since be-fore the Carnegie Institution project, to prevent injury to cattle or to block upraccoon lairs. These have not been explored in modern times. Three such ce-notes were reported by Bullard (1954:245; A. Smith 1962:210–211), but do notappear on the site map. In sum, the Carnegie map is not an accurate indicator ofthe number and location of cenotes. (Since this chapter was written, Arqlgos.Eunice Uc and Carlos Peraza L. have found and explored a number of previ-ously unknown cenotes at Mayapán. I was also shown a previously unrecordedcenote in Square X [Figure 15.2] in the summer of 2002. The total number ofknown cenotes now may approach forty.)Nevertheless, from the Carnegie map, one can observe regularities in the spa-tial distribution of cenotes. For example, the two mouths of the Cenote Polbox,the Cenote Yax-nab, the Cenote X-te Toloc, the four mouths of the CenotesZuytun Cab, and the Cenote Cosil form a line running east to west across thesouthern part of the site. The large Cenote Sac Uayum, just outside the Great"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"382The Maya RegionWall, is not far south of that line. Similarly, the Cenotes Yax-nab, Ch’en Pie,Yo Dzonot, and Ch’en Kulu align north to south. These linear arrangements ofcenotes/caves could be developing along fractures in the bedrock.Fracturing in the Mayapán area may be associated with the Chicxulub im-pact crater. Mayapán lies just inside the rim of the crater, which is marked bythe ‘‘cenote zone.’’ The crater is a geological structure dating to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (Hildebrand et al. 1995; Perry et al. 1995; Steinich and Marin1996; Swisher et al. 1992). Small lakes that formed in collapse dolines or uvalasdistinguish the cenote zone. The nearest such lakes lie only a couple of kilo-meters from Mayapán. Associated fracturing could extend into the site.Residential Settlement and the Religious Connection to CavesIn addition to the patterned relationship between residential settlement andkarst geomorphology, domestic settlement also exhibits a ritual and religiousrelationship to caves. Descent groups’ worship of lineage ancestors created anassociation between caves and settlement units related to kinship groups. Theuse of caves for ancestor worship of corporate or territorial groups appears to bea pan-Maya phenomenon. The custom is better documented in the Maya High-lands than in the Lowlands. I will present some of the evidence from the high-lands first, and then discuss some previously unrecognized historical evidencefor this cult at Mayapán.A clear understanding of the structure of the cult can be gleaned from Vogt’sdescription of Tzotzil settlement patterns and social organization in themunici-pioof Zinacantan, Chiapas. Vogt (1969:127–180) and his students (e.g., Col-lier 1975:79–87) have documented in detail a system of patrilocal, patrilinealsettlement. Domestic residential groups in Zinacantan are composed of patri-lineally related kin living patrilocally. These domestic groups have importantsocial, economic, religious, and political functions. Land is inherited patrilin-eally. The domestic groups are economic units. Both men and women from thedomestic group cooperate economically in tasks ranging from land rental andfarming to sheepherding (Vogt 1969:129–130, 136). A cross symbolizing groupunity marks each domestic group. The domestic group is the smallest unit in thepatrilineage.Several adjacent domestic groups, which are spatially localized, form asna,or patrilocal patrilineage (Vogt 1969:140). These are self-conscious groups inthat they can trace their genealogical connections and live on adjacent lands in-herited from ancestors. Thesnashave some jural authority, some control of land,and religious functions. Thesnamay contain only one localized patrilineage orseveral. The patrilineages vary in size from those with one lineage, four or five"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"Caves, Karst, and Settlement at Mayapán, Yucatán383houses, and no more than 15 people to large ones with seven patrilineages, overforty houses, and over 150 people (Vogt 1969:141). Eachsnamaintains a numberof cross shrines in caves and on mountaintops that allow them to communi-cate with ancestral deities. The social group practices ceremonies that reinforcesolidarity and mark thesnaboundaries both geographically and socially (Vogt1969:141–144).Next in size in the social structure is the water-hole group, which can varyin size from two to thirteensnas.The water holes themselves are highly sacredand are associated with myths. Water-hole groups have religious functions andjural powers over some aspects of life. They maintain cross shrines, as the indi-vidualsnasdo, and perform similar ceremonial circuits and other group ritualsthat define and solidify the entire water-hole group. These too are related toancestor worship (Vogt 1969:147).Above the level of the water-hole group is the hamlet, orparaje.These aregenerally endogamous political and territorial units composed of one or morewater-hole groups. The hamlets making up themunicipioof Zinacantan unitefor certain ritual and political purposes.At a yet higher level in the kinship and settlement system are two systemsof patronymics: a Spanish surname and a Maya surname. The origin and func-tion of the one based on Spanish surnames is obscure, although it is known fromother Maya communities in Chiapas (Siverts 1969; Villa Rojas 1947). Vogt callsthese ‘‘phratries.’’ The Maya patronymic groups are, in effect, patriclans becausethey are descent groups composed of people whose genealogical relationshipscan no longer be traced. These name groups are exogamous and therefore per-form an important social function in regulating marriage (Vogt 1969:145). Thisis a simplified sketch of the social structure of Zinacantan. Many of the patternsare statistical and many anomalies occur; nevertheless, the patterns are robust.The Zinacanteco social and settlement system highlights the importance ofwater sources in Maya settlement. They are simultaneously and systematicallyinterconnected with settlement, religion, and social structure. This pattern is notnew: there is evidence for the system fairly early in the colonial period (Megged1999). This is not a localized phenomenon, either, but one that is certainly pan-Maya.Brady (1997) has reviewed the religious and cosmological importance of cavesand springs among various Maya groups. Caves are related to mountains andthe gods that inhabit them. These, in turn, are related to ancestor worship(Vogt 1969:378–379, 386–387, 595; Wisdom 1940:425). Among the Tzeltalesof Cancuc, for example, sacred caves are associated with the three (there wereoriginally four) exogamous, patrilineal, patrilocal clans. These caves were be-lieved to be caves of origin. The smallerparajeswere also associated with particu-lar caves, and there was a system of sacred household crosses (Guiteras Holmes"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"384The Maya Region1992:48, 111, 143–146). In Oxchuc, another Tzeltal town in the Chiapas High-lands, religious bonds tied patrilineal settlements to sacred caves (Villa Rojas1947:579). June Nash has documented a complex system of ritual cave use inAmatenango del Valle, a Tzeltal town between San Cristóbal de las Casas andComitán. She notes both ancestral spirit caves and more dangerous caves that areinhabited by malevolent spirits (Nash 1985:19–25). A similar system of ances-tor worship associated with caves of origin seems to have functioned historicallyamong highland Guatemala groups, like the Pokom, K’iche’, Kaqchikel (Miles1965:285), and Qéqchi’ (Gurnee et al. 1968). Thus, caves form major loci in thesacred landscape (see Vogt 1969:378–379, 386–387, 595).In the relatively arid area of northern Yucatán, where Mayapán is located,caves are, if anything, more important in determining settlement patterns thanthey are in the relatively well watered highlands. In Yucatán, cenotes are sacredand dangerous: they are thought to be entrances to the Underworld and dwellingplaces of thechaaks,the rain gods. They are sources of evil winds; the plants andanimals that inhabit them, especially tortoises, are sacred (Redfield and VillaRojas 1934:178, 205–206). A cenote is thought of as the cosmological centerof the village. At one time, the village cenote was marked by a cross, as werethe four corners of the town (Redfield and Villa Rojas 1934:114). However, thesocial and religious importance of water sources is poorly documented for north-ern Yucatán. The point is an important one for this investigation because of thepossibility that settlement at Mayapán was organized in relation to cenotes. Ithas been written, and often repeated, that Mayapán’s location was based on theexistence of a large number of cenotes there (A. Smith 1962:265). My concernhere is the ethnohistorical evidence for the significance of these cenotes.As a preliminary, it is important to recognize that the Yucatec Maya, liketheir cousins in the highlands, had patrilineages with varied social functions re-lated to landholding, residence, inheritance, marriage, and, apparently, politicsand warfare (Brown 1999). The presence of matrilineages (making the Yucatecbilineal) has long been suspected (Eggan 1934; Roys 1940, 1957). The matri-lineages probably had economic functions as well (Brown 1999).As noted earlier, the wordch’e’en,‘‘well,’’ is the common term of reference forthe cenotes of Mayapán. Although a few are namedts’ono’ot,literally, ‘‘cenote,’’most are caves with water in them and are referred to as ‘‘wells,’’ which describestheir social function. Most of the water sources, both inside and outside of thecity, have names and are well known fixed points in the landscape.Cenotes are mentioned repeatedly in the Books of Chilam Balam, which arecolonial-period native books written in the Yucatec Maya language but usingthe Roman script. The wordch’e’enand its derivatives,ch’e’enilandch’e’enob,occur seventy-eight times in the Books of Chilam Balam (Miram and Miram1988:2:322–323),actun(‘áaktun) and its derivatives (includingyactunil)forty-"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"Caves, Karst, and Settlement at Mayapán, Yucatán385two times (Miram and Miram 1988:1:4–5, 6:1456), andts’ono’otseven times(Miram and Miram 1988:2:397).Ch’e’enandactunfrequently occur together ina couplet or kenning of the form ‘‘t u ch’enil—/—T u y ac tunil,’’ which Edmon-son (1982:75) translates as ‘‘to the wells, to the springs.’’ Similar phrasing occursa number of times (pp. 79, 92, 94, 97, 105), suggesting a true kenning. I counttwenty instances of the parallelism listed in Miram and Miram’s (1988:6:1456)concordance of the Books of Chilam Balam, all from the Pérez and Tiziminbooks.What does this kenning mean? First,‘áaktunmeans ‘‘cave,’’ not ‘‘spring,’’ atleast in Yucatec Maya (Bricker et al. 1998:2–3). ‘‘Spring,’’ although poetical,is an unlikely denotation in northern Yucatán, where springs are rare. Second,‘‘wells’’ and ‘‘caves’’ are usually the same places in northwest Yucatán. The paral-lelism, therefore, does not contrast two ideas, but emphasizes one through repe-tition. Edmonson (1982:89) glosses the kenning as ‘‘towns and villages,’’ be-cause of, apparently, the close association of settlements with their water sources.I agree with this interpretation. ‘‘Generally speaking, the local names of north-ern Yucatan are those of the watering places: ponds, natural rock tanks, wells,and cenotes’’ (Roys 1935:2).The primordial association between towns and their cenotes is often over-looked today, as the ancient cenotes are paved over and water comes out offaucets. This connection is strongest at Chichén Itzá, but many town namesincorporate the names of cenotes, wells, or other water sources: Hopelchen,Dzitbalchen, Panabchen, Cacalchen, Bolonchen, Yaxachen, Kancabchen Dzo-not, Chikindzonot, Kancabdzonot, Yokdzonot. Less-obvious cases include Cu-sama (‘‘water where the swifts are’’) (Roys 1957:60) and Yaxa (‘‘green water’’)(Roys 1957:96). Other towns are named after adjacent lakes, like Chuaca(Chauac-Ha) (de la Garza et al. 1983:2:83), and some after caves, like Actuncohand Yoactun. The examples are too numerous to list all. The parallel with theNahuatl termaltepetlshould not be overlooked. Literally, ‘‘water-hill,’’altepetlisglossed as ‘‘community,’’ ‘‘town,’’ or even ‘‘city-state.’’ It is written with a glyphcomposed of a stylized representation of a hill with a cave at its base.Many places that do not appear to be are, in fact, named after cenotes. Telcha-quillo, which is called Chaak in Maya, is actually named after a now-unusedcenote in town. Cansahcab and Sotuta are named after their cenotes (de la Garzaet al. 1983:1:94, 145–146).In a number of cases, the name of the cenote, and hence of the town, comesfrom one of its characteristics: the name of the town of Pixoy came from thegreatpixoytree that grew in the town cenote (de la Garza et al. 1983:2:51);Teabo appears to have been named after the grove of plum trees (abal)initscenote (de la Garza et al. 1983:1:318); Dzitnup was corrupted in some way fromthenameofthecocoyoltree growing in its cenote (de la Garza et al. 1983:2:59);"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"386The Maya RegionTecay was reputedly named after the fish in the cenote (de la Garza et al. 1983:2:125). Thus, although some towns are named after people or animals, plants orgods, others are actually named after their cenotes. So many settlements are syn-onymous with the names of their cenotes that I believe Edmonson’s deduction iscorrect: ‘‘wells and caves’’ is a metaphor for ‘‘towns and villages’’ or settlementsin general.One of the passages in the Book of Chilam Balam about cenotes is particu-larly interesting because it mentions Mayapán (Edmonson 1982:94; originalemphasis):MayapanMayapanUchom ual eIt happened there againT u cal ch’enIn the pass of the wellT u cal y ac tunIn the pass of the springTan sacilBefore the whiteningChakanFields.T u kin tz’am cootAt the sun given the ditch,T u kin y an paaAt the sun there was a wall,Edmonson interprets this as the continuation of a description of sacrifices thatbegins on the previous page.Ualprobably means ‘‘then’’ or ‘‘later’’ (Barrera Vás-quez 1980:909) rather than ‘‘again.’’ It could also mean ‘‘perhaps’’ (Bricker et al.1998:299).Calreally means ‘‘throat’’ or ‘‘neck’’ and can be easily read this way.Thus, ‘‘In the throat of the well/In the throat of the cave’’ is clearer and moreaccurate. The next two lines clearly form a couplet because bothcootandpaamean ‘‘wall.’’Tukinin this context scans more smoothly as ‘‘on the day’’ or‘‘at the time,’’ rather than as ‘‘at the sun.’’Cootis used in modern spoken Yuca-tec to mean specifically the ubiquitous, dry-laid stone walls that mark prop-erty boundaries, which Bullard and I call ‘‘boundary walls’’ and which are called‘‘albarradas’’ in the local Spanish of the peninsula. I cannot adduce any supportfor ‘‘ditch.’’Paais used generally to denote larger, defensive walls in texts likethe Books of Chilam Balam. Edmonson readstz’amasaformofts’ah,‘‘give,’’but in this context it means to ‘‘square’’ or ‘‘smooth’’ stones (Barrera Vásquez1980:876). Thus:MayapanIt happened thenIn the throat of the well,In the throat of the caveBefore the fields"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Caves, Karst, and Settlement at Mayapán, Yucatán387On that day, analbarradawas squaredOn that day, there was a wall.This translation is clearer and more accurate than Edmonson’s, though lessgraceful. The passage is an affirmation of the importance of the caves and ce-notes at Mayapán and suggests their relation to sacrifice and ritual.The most important passage on this theme is also from the Tizimin (Edmon-son 1982:110; original emphasis):Tutz’oc ucuch katunThe burden of the katun is finishedTi to uil y okolMayapanWhich is one moon overMayapan,Ti uchom may cuThe cycle seat,U y etz’His setting,U ch’ibalHis lineage,T u ch’enilAt the wells,Ti y ac tunilAt the welling fountains.Ti x uchom cim cehilAnd there occurred deer deathMa ya cimlalAnd painless death.This passage indicates that caves and cenotes were ritually and religiously asso-ciated with lineages at Mayapán. The text is relatively clear and straightforward.The translation presents some of the same problems already discussed, such asthe rendering ofyactunilas ‘‘welling fountains.’’ Edmonson does, however, pro-vide the basic meaning. There is a parallel, nearly identical passage in the Pérezmanuscript of the Book of Chilam Balam (Miram 1988:3:90).Thus, the Books of Chilam Balam tell us that aspects of the cenote cult,so famous from Chichén Itzá, took place at Mayapán. The cult was probablyubiquitous. One may recall that the victims of sacrifices uncovered by Landa’sinquisition were uniformly dumped in cenotes, and also some of the witnesses in-terrogated admitted to keeping their idols in caves (Scholes and Adams 1938:25,94, 97). There is, of course, a great deal of archaeological evidence that caveswere used ritually in northern Yucatán (e.g., Andrews 1970; Thompson 1975),and, as we will see, the caves of Mayapán itself yield evidence of such practices.Most scholars, however, seem to connect the rituals only with a rain-bringingcult. The above passage from the Tizimin (and its analogy from the Pérez) is theonly evidence I know of that links the Yucatecan cenote cult directly to lineages,and presumably to ancestor worship. That it does so specifically at Mayapán isparticularly important. The parallels with the Highland Maya settlement andkinship model are remarkable and suggest that parts of Vogt’s model are prob-ably applicable to Mayapán."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"388The Maya RegionCivic and Ceremonial ArchitectureThe second portion of this chapter is about the relationship of civic and cere-monial architecture to the karst geomorphology at Mayapán and, more specifi-cally, to caves and cenotes. A large corpus of evidence has accumulated thatMaya ceremonial architecture and its spatial organization were related to an-cient Mayan conceptions of politics, religion, society, and the cosmos. Thereis good reason to believe, for example, that some Maya ceremonial centers canbe read as cosmograms (e.g., Ashmore 1989; Aveni 1980:218–286; Aveni andHartung 1986; Carlson 1981; Coe 1965; Coggins 1980, 1983; Fox 1991). Theiconography and architecture of individual buildings were imbued with cosmicand ritual symbolism. The orientation of buildings and groups of buildings wasrelated to astronomical phenomena of religious and calendrical significance. Thearrangement of whole ceremonial centers and even sites replicated celestial ar-chetypes.The best systematic explanation for these phenomena is Eliade’s account ofthe relationship between religion and cyclic history in ‘‘archaic’’ (i.e., non-Judeo-Christian) cultures (Eliade 1958, 1965; see also Aveni 1980:219; Gossen andLeventhal 1993; Kus 1983; Wheatley 1971). Eliade (1965:3) took as his prob-lem the ‘‘conceptions of being and reality that can be read from the behavior ofthe man of premodern societies.’’ He wrote thatthe chief difference between the man of the archaic and traditional societiesand the man of the modern societies with their strong imprint of Judaeo-Christianity lies in the fact that the former feels himself indissolubly connectedwith the Cosmos and the cosmic rhythms, whereas the latter insists that heis connected only with History. Of course, for the man of the archaic soci-eties, the Cosmos too has a ‘‘history’’...Butthis‘‘history’’oftheCosmosand of human society is a ‘‘sacred history,’’ preserved and transmitted throughmyths. More than that, it is a ‘‘history’’ that can be repeated indefinitely, inthe sense that the myths serve as models for ceremonies that periodically reac-tualize the tremendous events that occurred at the beginning of time (Eliade1965:xiii–xiv).He argues that for non-Western peoples, ‘‘reality is a function of the imitationofacelestialarchetype...realityisconferredthrough participation in the ‘sym-bolism of the Center’: cities, temples, houses become real by the fact of beingassimilated to the ‘center of the world’...Rituals and significant profane ges-tures...acquire the meaning attributed to them, and materialize that meaning,only because they deliberately repeat such and such acts positedab originebygods, heroes, or ancestors’’ (Eliade 1965:5–6)."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"Caves, Karst, and Settlement at Mayapán, Yucatán389It was this view of reality that led to the periodic regeneration of cosmos,society, and time through the ritual reenactment of the cosmogonic act (Eliade1965:51–92). In other words, the repetition of archetypical mythical acts sacral-izes profane space and the quotidian tasks of life. The repetition of archetypes,in turn, is a necessary element of life in cyclical time. Prominent among therepeated archetypes were ceremonies of ending and renewal. Eliade (1965:112–130) presents an impressive list, drawn mostly from the Old World, of ritualsassociated with cosmic regeneration, many of them, naturally, New Year cere-monies, not a few reminiscent of ancient Maya New Year rituals. These peri-odic recapitulations of cosmic birth take place in the context of great cycles oftime.To understand how Eliade’s theory helps explain the organization of sacredspace and architecture at Mayapán, let us examine a concrete example. Eliade(1965:12) argued that the architectonic symbolism of the sacred Center con-sisted of1. the Sacred Mountain—where heaven and earth meet—situated at theCenter of the World.2. Every temple or palace—and by extension, every sacred city or royal resi-dence—is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Center.3. Being anaxis mundi,the sacred city or temple is regarded as the meetingpoint of heaven, earth, and hell.There is a growing body of direct iconographic and epigraphic evidence thatthe Maya regarded their pyramids as sacred mountains (Fash 1991:100; Scheleand Freidel 1990:71–72, 427). The ritual and spiritual center of Mayapán wasStructure Q-162, also known as the Temple of Kukulcan or the Castillo. Itwas the largest and tallest pyramid at the site and was located at the centerof the largest concentration of civic-ceremonial architecture. It was, in short,the architectural focus of the site’s ceremonial architecture (Figure 15.9) (Shook1954:89):Even a casual inspection of the ruins of Mayapan would enable one to statethat the temple of Kukulcan (Str. Q-162), popularly known as the Castillo, wasthe most important architectural unit of the site. Situated on the northwestedge of Cenote Ch’en Mul, it occupies the central position in a tight assem-blage of lesser temples, shrines, colonnaded halls, and buildings of diversetypes. The terraced pyramid and the temple on its summit tower above thesurrounding structures, and the flatness of the land for leagues in all directionstends to magnify the Castillo’s height. In ancient times the white stuccoedtemple and pyramid must have gleamed like a beacon above the forested land."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"390The Maya RegionFigure 15.9.Part of a detailed map of the ceremonial center of Mayapán, showing therelationship of the Temple of Kukulcan to the Cenote Ch’en Mul. From Pollock et al.(1962); courtesy Carnegie Institution of Washington.Interestingly, the Temple of Kukulcan is a radial temple; that is, it exhibitsfour roughly symmetrical stairways descending the four sides of the structure.Coggins (1980, 1983) has written extensively about this architectural form. Shehas argued that radial temples were ritually associated with completion, spe-cifically, with calendrical termination rituals, likekatunendings and New Yearceremonies (see also Carlson 1981). This is shown not only by their plan, whichresembles a glyph for completion, but also by their astronomical orientation.Two radial temples in northern Yucatán are known to participate in astro-nomical hierophanies: the Temple of Kukulcan at Chichén Itzá and the Templeof the Seven Dolls at Dzibilchaltun. Since the Temple of Kukulcan at Mayapánis apparently a copy of the one at Chichén, the former may also have a specialastronomical orientation, especially because it too has a round temple, perhapsan observatory, nearby (Structure Q-152). At Chichén Itzá on the equinox theplay of light and shadow on the balustrade of the Temple of Kukulcan creates"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"Caves, Karst, and Settlement at Mayapán, Yucatán391the visual impression of a serpent. Apparently, this is not the case at Maya-pán, where the orientation of the radial temple is different. If there is an astro-nomical hierophany at Mayapán, it has been difficult to observe because of theruined condition of the building. Now that the Instituto Nacional de Antropo-logía e Historia (INAH) has excavated and consolidated the structure, perhapsa hierophany will become visible.There is direct evidence that the Temple of Kukulcan at Mayapán acted asanaxis mundithat united Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld. Like its ana-log at Chichén Itzá, the Temple of Kukulcan at Mayapán had nine terraces(Shook 1954:93), equal to the number of levels in the Maya Underworld (Ca-rrasco 1990:67). Carlos Peraza’s excavation of the Temple of Kukulcan has alsorevealed human figures with death imagery modeled in stucco on the southeastcorner of the Castillo substructure (Q-162-sub). This is the corner of the build-ing nearest the Cenote Ch’en Mul. In Postclassic Mesoamerica, death imagerylike this was associated with cyclic completion (Klein 1975).The connection to the Underworld is made palpable, however, by the pres-ence of a natural cave below the temple. Robert Smith (1953a:280; 1954) re-ported that an arm of the Cenote Ch’en Mul extended approximately west-northwest beneath the Temple of Kukulcan, but he does not seem to haveattached much importance to the fact (see Figure 15.8). It has since been dis-covered that caves or tunnels occur beneath several major pyramids in Meso-america, including the Temple of the Sun at Teotihuacan (Heyden 1975, 1981,1989) and the Temples of K’ucumatz and Tojil at Utatlan (Fox 1991). Thesetunnels and caves have been interpreted as being related symbolically to CentralMexican creation myths and to the Maya Underworld, Xibalbá, of the K’iche’MayaPopol Vuh.The cave beneath the Temple of Kukulcan probably possessedsimilar mythical significance for the Maya and likely determined the placementof the structure.The association between the radial temple, symbolic of completion and re-newal, and the underlying cave, symbolic of origins, is explained by Eliade’sparadigm in an interesting way. Instead of the cave’s being merely an entranceto the Underworld, Eliade (1959a:80–81; original emphasis) asks us to considerthat1) through annual repetition of the cosmogony, time was regenerated, that is,it began again as sacred time, for it coincided with theillud tempusin whichthe world had first come into existence; 2) by participating ritually in the endof the world and its re-creation, any man became contemporary with theilludtempus;hence he was born anew, he began life over again with his reserve ofvital forcesintact,as it was at the moment of his birth.These facts are important; they reveal the secret of religious man’s attitude"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"392The Maya Regionand behavior in respect to time. Since the sacred and the strong is thetime oforigins,the stupendous instant in which a reality was created, was for the firsttime fully manifested, man will seek periodically to return to that original time.This ritual reactualizing of theillud tempusin which the first epiphany of areality occurred is the basis for all sacred calendars; the festival is not merelythe commemoration of a mythical (and hence religious) event; itreactualizesthe event.The paramounttime of originsis the time of the cosmogony, the instant thatsaw the appearance of the most immediate of realities, the world. This...isthe reason the cosmogony serves as the paradigmatic model for every creation,for every kind of doing. It is for this same reason thatcosmogonic timeserves asthe model for allsacred times.And (Eliade 1959a:78–79; original emphasis),Since the New Year is the reactualization of the cosmogony, it impliesstart-ing time over again at its beginning,that is, restoration of primordial time, the‘‘pure’’ time that existed at the moment of Creation. This is why the New Yearis the occasion for ‘‘purification’’...Foritisnotamattermerelyofacertaintemporal interval coming to its end and the beginning of another...thesinsand faults of the individual and of the community as a whole are annulled,consumed as if by fire.The relation of a cave to the origin myth is relatively obvious in the case of theTemple of the Sun at Teotihuacan (Heyden 1975), assuming, of course, that theinhabitants of Teotihuacan shared later Nahua mythology. In the Maya case, itis reasonable to assume a connection with some version of mythological eventssimilar to those related in thePopol Vuh,in which the ancestral Hero Twins dieand are reanimated during their journey through Xibalbá. In the alternative,there might be a connection with Highland Mexican mythology and ritual, asCoggins has argued for many of the radial temples and their associated ritualbehaviors (Coggins 1980, 1983). We can see in this example the advantage of re-ferring to a paradigm like Eliade’s: the relationship between calendrical renewalceremonies and origin myths might not be evident to the archaeologist.Are there other especially sacred cenotes at the site? Several were obviouslyrelated to a variety of ritual activities. For example, both Itzmal Ch’en andX-Coton are associated with assemblages of civic-ceremonial architecture, theformer being the largest such assemblage outside of the main group. Today, andsince at least 1950, the Cenote Itzmal Ch’en has been the site of the annualch’a’ah-chaak(rain-bringing ceremony) of the men of Telchaquillo (Shook 1952).The cenote itself, which lies in the eastern extreme of the site, is unusually large"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"Caves, Karst, and Settlement at Mayapán, Yucatán393and dramatic. It is probably not coincidental that a visually inspiring cenote atthe most sacred of the cardinal directions should develop and retain a holy aura.The position of the Cenote X-Coton raises another and different issue (Pros-kouriakoff 1962b:130):The X-Coton temple and the shrines are located near one of the principal gatesof the city wall, and the course of the wall at this point seems to be deliber-ately deflected to contain the buildings, or at least to contain the area aroundthe cenote near which they stand. The buildings themselves are of Mayapandate, but a considerable amount of pre-Mayapan pottery was found in thevicinity, and there is some evidence that the cenote itself may have been usedfor burial in pre-Mayapan times...Itthereforeseems reasonable to think thatan ancient tradition associated specifically with X-Coton is responsible for theceremonial buildings in this locality. (See also R. Smith 1953b)These observations raise the question of the course of the city wall. There isa series of cenotes near the wall in the southern part of the site. The CenotesCh’en Max, Polbox, X-leth, Ch’en Kulu, and Ch’en Carro are all within about250 meters of the wall, most even closer. Like X-Coton, Ch’en Kulu also mayhave had a sacred or ceremonial character. In the cave, we found both a stonealtar figure (Proskouriakoff 1962a:331–333) with clear calendrical associationsand a feature of possible ceremonial or ritual function (Figures 15.5 and 15.6).The large bulge in the southwestern part of the great wall probably existed toembrace Ch’en Kulu and the other nearby cenotes.If the wall deviates to include this large group of cenotes, why then wouldit take a sharp inward curve between the cenotes Ch’en Carro and X-Coton,thereby excluding the large Cenote Sac Uayum? Bear in mind that the greatwall of Mayapán was the brand and symbol of the city. Rarely does the wordMayapanoccur in the native chronicles (such as in the Books of Chilam Balam)without the epithet ‘‘ich paa’’ (inside the wall), which thus became the rulingtrope or metaphor for the city, not unlike the ramparts of ‘‘holy Ilios.’’ Clearly,the course of wall would have been important in separating the sacred from theprofane and the center from the periphery. Surely, simplicity and conveniencewould dictate that a large cenote would be better within the city than outside it.Sac Uayum is a visually dramatic cenote. A shallow depression in the lime-stone surface opens on one side to expose a large cavern. Only a small amount oflight penetrates the cavern through the entrance and through another, smalleraperture in the roof. The walls are vertical or overhanging. The water is un-usually deep and clear. The cenote has a fearful reputation. Some local peoplebelieve that a feathered serpent lives in the cave. Children are prohibited fromapproaching it lest the serpent snatch them. Some local residents claim to have"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"394The Maya Regionseen the creature. Some say they have seen it swimming in the depths of thewater. One old man claims to have seen a feathered serpent in a nearby tree; ashe watched, it flung itself out of the tree and dove into the mouth of the cave.Although there is no direct evidence, it can be assumed that the legend of thefeathered serpent in the cenote is of preconquest age. It reminds one of the dan-gerous caves of Amatenango described by Nash (1985:23–26). The beliefs aboutSac Uayum provide an explanation for the deliberate exclusion of the cenotefrom the city, the absence of a gate in the immediate vicinity, and the lack ofresidential platforms surrounding it. Note that this dangerous and malevolentcenote is on the south side of the site, atnohol,the nadir. The presence of a sacredcenote in the east and an evil one in the south leads us to the idea of a quadripar-tite cosmogram. Perhaps the whole site, and not merely the ceremonial center,participated in the cosmogram.Some Mayanists have seen the relevance of Eliade’s ideas to the interpreta-tion of Maya religion (Aveni 1980; Brady 1997; Schele and Friedel 1990). Thereis evidence that these ideas are specifically applicable to Mesoamerica and theMaya. For example, the relevance of Eliade’s religious archetypes to the ancientMaya is strongly reinforced by recent reconstructions of Mesoamerican beliefsystems. Mesoamerican ethnohistorians, for instance, have developed some ofthe same paradigms as Eliade through examination of specific, local problems(Gossen 1986:5–6):At the very least, the symbol clusters noted below have both temporal andspatial persistence in Mesoamerican thought...1. Theabidingthemeofcyclicaltimeasasacredentity...itisclearthatsacred, cyclical, solar time has held powerful sway in both the ancientand contemporary Mesoamerican universe...2. A consistent delimitation of sky, earth, and underworld in the spatiallayout of the cosmos, with mediation among these realms as a key intel-lectual, political, and religious activity, for with successful mediationcome power, wisdom, even personal health, and community survival.Some variant of this spatial layout, with subunit segmentation and di-rectional symbolism, occurs throughout pre-columbian Mesoamerica...and persists in our time, particularly in the Maya area.Carrasco (1990) presents another extended treatment of this subject.Such correlations suggest that Eliade’s theory of religion is applicable spe-cifically to Mesoamerican and Maya cases, whether or not its claim of culturaluniversality can be substantiated. The extensive and detailed parallels betweenMaya religion and Eliade’s archetypes go well beyond those described here,"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"Caves, Karst, and Settlement at Mayapán, Yucatán395strongly implying that such an interpretive approach can be fruitful. The poten-tial advantage in doing so lies in the explanatory power of his approach. Eliadesought to establish a science of comparative religion, orReligionswissenschaft(Eliade 1959b). Although his methodology has been questioned, the allegedhermeneutical and psychological bases of his phenomenology allowed him andhis successors to make claims of cultural universality for their analyses (Allen1978, 1982; Dudley 1977).Tambiah (1985:257) offers three cogent criticisms of Eliade’s views: (1) theview is static and fails to account, therefore, for the variation and dynamismof the subject societies; (2) there is no evidence for the existence of ‘‘a priorontology,’’ that is, what Eliade calls ‘‘the mind of Archaic man’’ or pre-Judeo-Christian thought as such; and (3) it is impossible to separate the sacred fromthe profane or from the religious, political, and economic domains, because cul-ture is a holistic phenomenon. This last point represents a position widely heldby cultural and social anthropologists. Its opposite—that culture can be studiedanalytically—is equally widely held. In archaeology, the former represents an ex-treme cultural relativism in which knowledge of the past is almost impossible.This is not the place to debate the issue.Tambiah’s second point says less about Eliade’s view of ‘‘Archaic man’’ thanit does about his optimistic assessment of modern thought as being more lin-ear and historical than its predecessor. One should not therefore conclude thatEliade’s view of ancient religion is incorrect, because the error may lie in his viewof ‘‘modern’’ man.Tambiah’s first point is more valid, but does not, I think, reduce Eliade’sinterest to Mesoamericanists. The vividness, detail, and specificity of Eliade’sarguments do much to compensate for their technical lack of dynamics. Further-more, I do not think Eliade’s mode of explanation is invalid for failing to con-form to contemporary expectations of how explanatory models should be struc-tured. Eliade identified broad and widely applicable patterns of human thoughtand experience. That we do not fully understand how, when, and why they aroseand persisted speaks more to our ignorance about this domain of culture (or itscomplexity) than to the quality of his observations and interpretations.Summary and DiscussionThe geomorphology of the karst underlying Mayapán clearly affected the site’sresidential settlement pattern.

The mathematical and geo-metrical characteristics of both landscape and settlement at the site have onlybegun to be described and analyzed (Brown 1999:111–191).The caves and cenotes of Mayapán were used for a variety of rituals, andthey were probably major foci in the sacred landscape. The watering places werelikely associated with a ‘‘cenote cult’’ concerned with rainmaking. Caves and ce-notes were also connected to kinship and social organization. Caves must havebeen the dwelling places of lineage ancestors, as they are among the HighlandMaya of Chiapas and Guatemala. Other nearby caves may have been evil anddangerous.The civic-ceremonial architecture of the site was clearly organized in confor-mity with Mayan cosmological principles. The Temple of Kukulcan was shownto represent a sacred mountain linking Heaven, Earth, and Hell. The Under-world was literally present in the site cosmogram, in the form of a natural cavebelow the pyramid. The cave must have been a surrogate for the place of originwhere the cosmogony first occurred. The temple as a hierophany surely partici-pated in calendrical rites, either of the New Year orkatunendings, and probablyboth. The locations of other caves also influenced the layout of city. The posi-tions of the Cenotes X-Coton, Ch’en Kulu, and Sac Uayum, for example, almostcertainly affected the course of the city wall.I have not discussed many important characteristics of the caves of Maya-pán. They were, for example, used for burial. I observed human remains in YoDzonot and Ch’en Kulu, and the Carnegie Institution team also found burialsin several caves. Caves served as sources of raw materials, such as certain typesof calcite and clay, and produced stalactites, which at Mayapán were used as ele-ments in altars (Adams 1953). Much research on this topic remains to be doneat Mayapán and will undoubtedly produce greater insight into Maya society andreligion.AcknowledgmentsI thank the personnel of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia fortheir generous assistance and cooperation during my work at Mayapán.

The first change is simply in tone. The chapters presented here differfrom the earlier interpretive attempts that tended to be highly speculative andoften drawn from iconographic analysis, and provided only a generic interpre-tation of how caves were used. The current efforts, by contrast, tend to focus onthe explanation of a specific body of data from a specific site, so the discussionsare empirically grounded. The data used to support positions tend to be far moreextensive and broadly drawn from archaeology, ethnohistory, ethnography, andart history, so contentions are far more closely argued and convincing. Finally,the focus on such tangential issues as hallucinogenic drug use and altered statesof consciousness (MacLeod and Puleston 1978) has been replaced by attemptsto relate the cave data to larger religious, economic, and political issues in Meso-american studies. Thus, this volume exemplifies the development of cave studiesinto a mainstream area of research carried out by serious and well-known schol-ars addressing a range of issues central to their disciplines.More than anything else, however, the new direction in cave research is de-veloping out of an emerging recognition of the importance ofEarthas a sacredand animate entity in indigenous cosmology. David Stuart’s (see Chapter 7 here)decipherment of thech’e’englyph as ‘‘cave’’ offers dramatic confirmation of thisimportance. Scholars are already debating the meaning of the reading, since itappears that it does not always refer simply to caves. Simon Martin (2001:178)notes, ‘‘The wordch’een,‘cave’ is a recent decipherment, and seems to have aderived meaning of ‘town/city’ either because settlements were symbolically, orliterally, associated with particular caves; or because the word simply abbreviatedthe metaphorical coupletchan ch’een,‘sky-cave’ which referred to key populationcenters.’’"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"404In the Maw of the Earth MonsterA larger pan-Mesoamerican view allows us to understand what may be hap-pening here. In Central Mexico, human settlements are referred to asaltepetl,which means ‘‘water-filled mountain,’’ so that throughout Mesoamerica humanpopulations are referred to and conceptualized in terms of their associated ter-restrial landmark. Settlements are known and legitimized through this referenceto place.As features at the core of pan-Mesoamerican ideology, caves possess an im-portance and power that Mesoamerican specialists have been slow to appreciate.The evidence, however, is both clear and abundant. The cave complex at Aca-tzingo Viejo, Puebla, was important enough in the indigenous sacred landscapethat it was portrayed in the ethnohistorical Map of Cuauhtinchan No. 2 (Chap-ter 4 here), and caves in general figure prominently in this map. The ColossalNatural Bridge on the Ndaxagua River also appears repeatedly in the Mixteccodices (Chapter 6 here). In another place, Rincón (1997:135–136) explains,‘‘The Coixtlahuaca codices extol place and place-making by referring to theearth’s creation, especially to two unique landforms [a hill and the cave] foundin the Basin considered to be evidence for this event. Allusions to these twolandforms occur over and over in the Coixtlahuaca sixteenth-century painteddocuments. Their eventual appropriation, in a reenactment of creation, appearsto be of central importance to the foundation of the Chocho villages in theCoixtlahuaca Basin.’’The association of the Colossal Natural Bridge on the Ndaxagua with cre-ation is also echoed in the analysis of Acatzingo Viejo. The importance of worldcreation as a symbol of fundamental religious importance has been underappre-ciated by Mesoamerican specialists. Yet Eliade (1959:81) underscores this pointin seeing the creation of the world ‘‘as the paradigmatic model for every cre-ation’’ (see also Chapter 15 here). Erich Isaac (1962) asserts that religious land-scape modification is usually an attempt to model the primordial landscape.Ángel García-Zambrano (1994:217–218) suggests, furthermore, that it is themodel of that landscape that guides the search for all Mesoamerican settlement:‘‘Essentially, Mesoamerican migrants searched for an environment with specificcharacteristics that...hadtorecall the mythical moment when the earth wascreated: an aquatic universe framed by four mountains with a fifth elevation pro-truding in the middle of the water. The mountain at the core had to be dottedwith caves and springs, and sometimes surrounded by smaller hills. A settinglike this duplicated, and forever would freeze, the primordial scene when thewaters and the sky separated and the earth sprouted upwards.’’The strength of current cave research is that it has been able to take theseabstract expressions of indigenous cosmology and link them to material evi-dence in the archaeological record of the functioning of the ideology in ancientsocieties. For example, when García-Zambrano (1994:218) states that the caves"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"Concluding Comments405‘‘became the pulsating heart of the new town, providing the cosmogonic refer-ents that legitimized the settlers’ rights for occupying that space and for theruler’s authority over that site,’’ we see evidence of the Acatzingo Viejo rulers’need to establish this legitimacy in the excavation of a model of the primordialcave of origin beneath their site. While Acatzingo Viejo is a particularly clearexample of an artificial cave being constructed in a site’s core of public archi-tecture, it is by no means unique. One has only to look at Teotihuacan (Heyden1973, 1975; Manzanilla et al. 1994), Xochicalco (Hirth 2000), Zaculeu (Brady2002), Utatlan (Brady 1991), La Lagunita (Ichon and Viel 1984), and MixcoViejo (Brady and Veni 1992) to see that there is now a well-documented patternof cave construction throughout Mesoamerica. Furthermore, because the pat-tern of cave construction replicates the association of architecture noted withnatural caves (Brady 1997), it provides convincing evidence that the placementwas intentional. The theoretical and ideological reasoning behind the incorpo-ration of such symbols has been discussed at length (Brady 1997; Brady andAshmore 1999; García-Zambrano 1994).Another important characteristic of this volume is its intentional integra-tion of archaeology, ethnohistory, and ethnography. This grounds discussionsof archaeological data in models based on actual behavior of real people. Aselsewhere in the world, the caves that form the material or conceptual bases ofthese chapters are elements of landscapes made sacred by the actions of peoplewho mythologized, marked, and mapped places in the wilderness and then inte-grated them into their cultural geography (Taçon 1999:2). Once a site is madesacred, it carries with it a new range of rules for behavior in relation to the site,rules that often imply relationships with a ‘‘non-empirical’’ world (Carmichaelet al. 1994:3). As spatial and cognitive elements, landscapes are intertwined withtime, in that they are not static or abstract entities, but part of social practices(Gosden and Head 1994:113; Gregory 1985:315). Space and time are related inthat they represent a relationship between objects and actions. The productionof social space results in the creation of history (Soja 1985:91).Across Mesoamerica, religious symbolism has important terrestrial compo-nents, and these are most frequently manifested as mountains and caves, whichare the natural features considered the most sacred (Stuart 1997; Stuart andHouston 1994:86; Vogt 1969, 1997a, 1997b). In general, mountains in theseindigenous ideologies are referred to by the specific names of their guardiansor owners, who also represent deity or ancestral personages (Monaghan 2000:45n12). As these chapters (see Chapter 12 here) have shown, caves are conceptu-ally linked with mountains. Together, they represent the idealized manifestationof the power of the earth. A Q’eqchi’ Maya states explicitly, ‘‘Among four or fivemountains there is always one that is most important, especially if it has caves.If it has caves it is most powerful because it has water’’ (Garza 2003). Together,"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"406In the Maw of the Earth Monstermountains and caves are directly associated with ancestors, health, and personaland political success. Further, in the modeling of the earth as an element of theMesoamerican universe, relationships between humans and the sacredness of thelandscape are most clearly articulated by shamans (see Chapter 8 here; Gossen1974:34; Hanks 1990:304; Madsen 1955; Sandstrom 1991:236), a pattern thatthese chapters indicates was also evident in the past.While dealing in generalizations we need to be cautious in order to avoidthe perception of seamless and unifying theologies. Monaghan (2000:29) notesthat while Mesoamerican belief systems can be ‘‘characterized by a theology thatfocuses on the essential oneness of nature and experience, an obvious problemis how to explain the peculiarities.’’ Drawing from sources across a large anddiverse area that is not politically and socially unified risks reifying and essential-izing generalizations about belief systems. As with all comparative endeavors,what must be avoided is ‘‘confounding of a wide range of related forms with oneformfavoredwhich...allsimilarformsmustbeseen as striving’’ (Whitehead1986:81).It has been long recognized that there is thematic congruence in perceptionsof the sacred and animate earth across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Yet,it is also critically important to recognize that expressions of the sacred earthare embedded in a plurality of religious forms across Mesoamerica, and thatthese are viewed and acted on in different ways in different places. While thesacrality of mountains and caves is evident across the regions, features in a land-scape that are perceived as sacred by individuals or groups are ‘‘contingent onthe specific experience’’ of those people (Brady and Ashmore 1999:125). Dif-fering historical knowledge as well as linguistic and social trajectories carvedout unique forms of religious expression across Mesoamerica. We still believethat comparative methods have intellectual merit, not only because they reflectan underlying shared commonality in worldview (Kirchhoff 1968), but also be-cause, in the words of Gary Gossen (1986:5), regional synthesis ‘‘reinforces thetime-honored strategy for understanding the micro-view.’’ This volume encap-sulates both perspectives, working from local data to understand regional pat-terns while at the same time broadening our understanding of commonalitiesapparent across Mesoamerican theologies. Such breadth speaks to the fact thatthe cave complex is an essential feature of Mesoamerican cosmology and ide-ology and, as such, cannot be written off as simply a local or an idiosyncraticdevelopment.The studies presented in this volume also clearly indicate the ‘‘conservationand diffusion of a wide range of divinatory practices’’ across time (Treviño 2001:61) and offer examples of how analogical data can inform our interpretationsof the archaeological past. We would note that these contributions treat eventsthat range from remote antiquity to the present day. The persistence of caves"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Concluding Comments407in metaphor and belief in Mesoamerica is a critical element for both historicaland archaeological understanding of how landscapes integrate into cosmologyand worldview. They provide plausible examples of the continuities in symbolicsystems that have endured for at least three thousand years (Gossen 1986; Hunt1977:258–259).Today, caves are seen by most Mesoamerican people as points of emergenceand refuge in creation myths, as avenues of communication with revered an-cestors, and as feared places where human agency can produce uncertain con-sequences (Carlson and Eachus 1977:38; Heyden 1975; Thompson 1970:367;Vogt 1969:302, 303, 387; Vogt 1981; Wilson 1995:71–73). This was also truein the historical past. The seventeenth-century Kaqchikel (Cakchiquel) manu-scriptAnnals of the Cakchiquelsrefers to Xibalbay as an underground kingdomof great riches and power (Recinos and Goetz 1953:45–46). Cenotes, water-bearing caves, and wells served as boundary markers on colonial maps and weremarked as such with crosses (Marcus 1993:Fig. 5; Roys 1943:Fig. 1 and 176–190). The Florentine Codex states that, among the Nahua, the dead—accom-panied by offerings of pottery, paper, incense, and cloth—and a little yellow dogpassed through a place ‘‘where the mountains come together’’ on the way toMictlan (the Underworld). While this was happening to the soul, the body wasburned and placed in a hole dug by men but called a cave (Sahagún 1952:40–42; also see Sullivan 1972). Sahagún (1963:275–279) further lists eight typesof caves that were socially significant to the Aztec. These are discerned bothby physical characteristics (size, number of passages, presence of water, geo-logical formation) and by function (spying place, terrifying place, place of thedead, place of darkness). The research presented in this volume leads us to be-lieve that cave studies offer a rare opportunity to use the historical present as awindow into the less-clear past and to reveal the past in modern thought andpractice.This continuity is particularly important to ongoing archaeological debates.Archaeology has struggled for a century to find ways of approaching prehistoricideology, so it is ironic that there has been so much resistance to recognizingthis breakthrough. Many archaeologists’ resistance to the cave literature can betraced directly to the heavy materialist bias of mainstream processual archae-ology. The implicit model is an ecological variant of ‘‘economic man,’’ in whichimportant decisions are motivated primarily out of concern about maximizingecological resources, production, and economics. Added to this, the atheistic ornontheistic personal outlook of most archaeologists may contribute to the dis-missal of values that they do not share. When these two aspects are combined,it would be difficult to find a more culture-bound and inappropriate model toapply to a preindustrial, non-Western, agrarian people. Ethnography provides afar more complex model of human motivation that is grounded in groups that"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"408In the Maw of the Earth Monsterare historically connected to those whom archaeologists study. These sourcesunderscore the importance of caves for real people.Caves represent the optimal physical spaces in which to attempt reconstruc-tion of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican religions. Belief systems are difficult todetect in the archaeological record, and even more difficult to interpret. How-ever, the discussion of ritual or religious activities based on material remains isnot impossible, especially in contexts where religious ritual activities are clearlysuspected or known. Ethnography can inform these discussions, especially inthe context of what religious specialists do, rather than the elicitation of beliefsystems. By more clearly elucidating the roles of contemporary and historicalritual specialists, it becomes easier to understand how these types of individualsmay have acted in prehistoric societies.ReferencesBrady, James E.1991 Caves and Cosmovision at Utatlan.California Anthropologist18(1):1–10.1997 Settlement Configuration and Cosmology: The Role of Caves at Dos Pilas.American Anthropologist99(3):602–618.2002 The Implications of Artificial Caves for Our Understanding of Cave Func-tion.
