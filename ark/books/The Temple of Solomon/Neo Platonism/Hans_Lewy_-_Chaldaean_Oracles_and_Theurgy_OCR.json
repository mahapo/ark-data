With the first part of the title he associates the notion of incoherent and only partly intelligible fragments of a collection of Greek magico-mystical poems of later antiquity which, by a strange con-version, was elevated by the Neoplatonists to the rank of a script-ure of holy revelation. With the second part of the title, one is accustomed to associate a magical science which, in the twi-light of the Greek genius, took possession of philosophy and de-frauded it of its fruits. Both concepts finally go back to the Neo-platonist Iamblichus who was the first systematizer of the occult sciences : it was he, too, who adopted the doctrines of the Chal-dsean Oracles and incorporated them into his mysleriosophy to which he gave the name «Theurgy». The task of the present work is to bring light into this darkness and to elucidate the genesis of this last spiritual discipline of Antiquity. Thereby, some of the veils woven by its ancient transmitters and their modern adepts will be raised. The name and subject of theurgy were the creation of two hellenized Orientals, Julian the Chal-daean and his homonymous son, surnamed «the Theurgist», who flourished in the times of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. These Iwo men were the founders of a religious system the principles of which they enunciated in the so-called Chal daean Oracles, and in other writings. There is little need to comment on the import-ance of a detailed knowledge of a religious doctrine, the date of Β"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"1»111   INTRODUCTION   whose origin is ascertainable, for the understanding of the general state of ancient creeds in one of their most critical periods. Ma-ny of the matters followed up in this investigation may throw light on problems of special interest to the historian of religious thought. For the rest, we shall be content, if we succeed in making clear the inner connections of the Ghaldaean system and the origin of its elements. The broader aspect of its later in-fluence which coincides roughly with that of Neoplatonism will be viewed only in so far as it is indispensable for the comprehension of its sources. The vagueness of the concepts currently linked with the sub-ject of this work may be explained by the fact that the classical philologists, conscious of their duty to pave the way for the under-standing of ancient tradition, have neglected their obligation in this minor domain. They have more or less excluded the study of the Chaldaean Oracles from that of the religious documents of later Antiquity—a task which they have, in common with theolo-gians and orientalists, pursued during the last two generations with striking success. The fragments of this Collection, all of them quotations by Neoplatonic writers, were brought together, sys-tematically arranged and commented at the end of the last century (189^) by W. Kroll. This study was not followed up. Occa-sionally the teachings of the Oracles were compared with analog-ous religious ideas, but no one assumed the toil of testing Kroll's conclusions or even of taking up his researches at the point where he left off. The exccllence of Kroll's work is unanimously acknow-ledged. It undubitably constitutes a vast advance on that of his predecessors (whose rudimentary attempts need now no more to be recorded) and has widely promoted the research in this field. Yet truth compels us to^ say that its author did not reach the principal goal of his efforts. Kroll's particular merit lies in the elucidation of the complicated nature of the tradition and in"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHALDEAN ORACLES AND THEURGY  ״  establishing sound critical principles for the separation of the ge-nuine material from subsequent retouching. Beyond that, how-ever, he succeeded neither in connecting the single parts into a coherent unity nor in Satisfactorily explaining their content or ori-gin. One of the major rfeasons for his shortcomings has to be sought (as Bidez was the first to point out) in his neglect of the obvious relations between the theological teachings of the Oracles and the theurgical practices described by the same authors in these texts and in their other writings. Thus, Kroll not only sketched a rather one-sided picture of the character of these Ghaldsean doctrines, but he also deprived himself of one of the principal means of interpretation. Yet it would be injust to hold this or any other deficiency against him. His work falls into the first period of the critical investigation of the religious documents of later Antiquity. The results of these studies have since then sharpened the eye for many phenomena which, in his time, still flowed together in the nebulous picture of «syncretism». The fact remains, however, that the obscurity which still veils the mean-ing of most of the Ghaldaean Oracles prevents their true import-ance from being recognized. In many respects, indeed, they are still terra incognita for the investigator 1. 1 For the reasons mentioned above and in order not to expand unduly an already lengthy volume, we shall abstain from entering into a continuous debate with the opinions of Kroll and from noting (except in a few· instances of major importance) the agreement or difference between our views and those of our fore-runner. We shall simply restrict ourselves to quoting the relevant pages of his work. Since the appearance of Kroll's study (De Oraeulis Chaldaicis. Breslauer Phi-lologische Abhandlungen, VII. I. Breslau, 1894.76pp. Cf. also the short survey of his results given by bim in Rheinischet Museum, 1895, p. 636-639), two scholars have dealt with the same subject without adding anything new to the results of their predecessor. The first was L. H. Gray who, in the Appendix to Α. V. W. Jackson's Zoroaster (New York, 1898, p. 3 59*2 73) presented a η."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"1»111   INTRODUCTION   From this brief glance at the present stage of the research we may turn to the plan and the scope of our work. But first, its extent requires justification. The main reason for it lies in the state of the preservation of the Ghaldsean Oracles. These texts have not come down to us as a whole, but in the form of count-less quotations ranging in length from two or three words to a dozen lines, and scattered throughout the vast expanse of Neopla-tonic writing. It goes without saying that in such unfavourable circumstances it was not possible to arrive immediately at explicit results. Often, slight allusions had to be investigated as to their true reference and gaps to be filled up by hypotheses which, in their turn, necessitated a detailed proof. These disquisitions could have been abandoned dnly if the real aim of this attempt —the comprehension of the logical cohesion of the single parts of the Chaldaean system—had been given up. For it is indeed our conviction that we have to deal here with a system in the proper sense ·of the word. The arrangement of this investigation is conditioned by its aim and the peculiarities of the tradition. Gompleteness of material is the prerequisite of every attempt at explanation. For this rea-son, the first chapter will be devoted to the proof that, apart from some 300 lines of the Oracles collected by Kroll, about 100 reprint (distorted by many misunderstandings) of the Greek fragments of the Chaldaean Oracles collected by Kroll. Besides him, G. R. S. MEAD, The Chaldeean Oracles. Echoes from the Gnosis, vol. VIII-IX. (The thcosophical publishing society. London and Benares, 1908) published a highly coloured and very often too free rendering of the same fragments with short explanations which, too, are mostly borrowed from Kroll (who by writing Latin happily evaded the ingrateful task of translation). It is clear that as the aspect and the aims of Mead widely differ from ours, V) our methods could not conform to those used in his work. We may, however, gratefully acknowledge that in the task of putting these enigmatic verses into English wc were considerably helped by his courageous attempt."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"XVII CIIALDICAN ORACLES AND THEURGY lines are still extant which have not yet been recognized as such. These new fragments, which have come down to us through other channels than those followed by the main group, admit of a more discriminating view of the literary character of these Oracles and the intention of their authors, a view varying sensibly from that accepted hitherto. The demonstration of the Chaldaean origin of these fresh texts may serve also as a primary introduction to the trend of the ideas of their authors. In this section, anticipation of results which can be proved only later has been inevitable. By completing the collection of the extant material, our study fulfils the first condition for the reconstruction of the Chaldaean system of belief in its entirety. Chapters 11-v will be devoted to this task. Chapter 11 will be introduced by a brief account of the Neoplatonic sources, their nature and the principal rules for their critical examination; thereupon, the exposition of the sys-tcm of the «Intelligible World», the main theme of Chaldaean theosophy, will follow immediately. Chapter HI contains a des-cription of the Chaldaean mystery of the «Immortalization of the Soul», by which the Chaldaean Theurgists entered into competi-tion with other mysterv-cults of their epoch. Chapter iv will deal with the practices of the Theurgists and their relation to magic. In Chapter V we shall be occupied with Chaldaean demonology and its affinity with Persian dualism. The dispersion of the systematic description into several chap-ters often necessitates the separate treatment of related subjects. The disadvantage resulting from frequent cross-references may, we hope, be offset by the possibility of basing the procedure of recon-struction upon the original texts (offered in literal translation and quoted in Greek in the annotations) on which it rests. In this waY> n°t only may fresh life be given to the enquiry, but the critical reader may also be enabled to pursue independently the ״end of the arguments and to check the respective conclusions"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1»111   INTRODUCTION   or conjectures by reference to their premisses. This continuous control seems to be the more necessary, as the piecing-together of the system can be performed only by giving attention even to the smallest debris of tradition. The purpose of the second part of the present work is the detai-led investigation of the genesis of the Chaldaean system. The separation of the synthesis from the historical analysis may cause the reader the inconvenience of comparing the treatment of the same theme in the first and the second part (he will be spared this, however, as far as possible, by recapitulations). On the other hand, it avoids the intermixture of two different questions : that of the meaning of a single tenet within the framework of the whole system and that of its source. It is a basic rule that the origin of an idea implies nothing definite about its signi-ficance within the system in which it has later been embodied. Neglect of this rule has caused considerable confusion in two neigh-bouring areas of research : the philosophy of later antiquity and that of gnosticism. This has served as a warning to us. The separation of synthesis and analysis will be abandoned only when it happens that fragments of the Chaldaean Oracles which are not intelligible in themselves reproduce an opinion preserved more completely elsewhere. In the first chapter of the second part (Chap, vi) the obvious relations between the metaphysics of the Chaldaeans and that of the Platonists of their time will be fully dealt with. The respect-ive doctrines of the Oracles reflect, as will be shown there, a hitherto incompletely known variant of Middle Platonism which helps to explain the genesis of several traits of the philosophy of Philo and especially of Plotinus. In the second chapter of this second part (Chap, vn) the question of the contact between the Chaldaean Theurgists. and that complex of Oriental creeds to which they owe their ethnical designation will be answered. The"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CHALDAEAN ORACLES AND THEURGY  XIX  investigation of the religious background will allow us to give a broader characterization of the position and importance of the Chaldaeans within the spiritual movements of their time. We may add a short comment on the arrangement of the Appen-(jix. It will contain a series of preliminary investigations which are more than mere annotations, and a collection of all the extant fragments of Chaldaean writings It is true that these texts will have been already adduced in the foot-notes to the main investig-ation. A separate collection of the material, together with a short, reference to the appropriate pages of the investigation, may, how-ever, be useful to critical readers of this subject and especially to occasional users. The want of such a collection has often been felt and has possibly discouraged some students from a closer occupation with the whole subject. This brief sketch of the plan is intended to inform the reader to whom the title of this book is too compressed, what he may expect of it and, more especially, what he will not find therein. Of its inadequacies. the author is himself fully conscious. He knows that during his six years of occupation with the subject he has found his way only gradually and that more than a few points of detail seem to him uncertain. On the other hand, he acknowledges with gratitude that he could not have reached the aim which he set himself without the assistance he derived from the masterly researches in the history of religions of the later Roman empire by F. Cumont and J. Bidez, of Neoplatonism by K. Praechter, E. Brehier and E. R. Dodds, and from H. Jonas' searching analysis of gnostic structure of thought. It may be ap-propriate to conclude this introduction with a sentence of the great scholar mentioned first in this list of acknowledgments : * The expansion of the Oriental cults is, besides the development 1 See Postscript, p. 1*1."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1»111   INTRODUCTION   of Neoplatonism, the most important fact in the cultural history of the pagan Empire». The present work dealing with the coali-tion of these two spiritual movements may be regarded as an attempt to justify the truth of the above dictum of Cumont.

Who are the gods to whom the Chaldeans owed their wisdom? The Neoplatonists employ in their quotations various expressions : \"The god\". \"One of the gods\", \"The gods\", etc. While the plural remains un-explained, Damascius, one of the chief transmitters of the Chaldean Oracles, adds sometimes to the singular the attribute : \"The prophesy-ing\" 10. The oracle-giving god par excellence is Apollo ; he is evidently considered as one of the utterers of the Chaldean Oracles. After quoting an Oracle Proclus designates the priests of the Chaldean mysteries as those who \"preside at the sacraments of Apollo\" 11. The functions of the priests must be discussed further on. There is no doubt, however, that one group of the Chaldean Oracles was thought to have been com-inunicated to the Julians by Apollo. It can be shown that some of the Chaldean Oracles were ascribed to another divinity.

The principal work of Porphyry dealing with the oracular poetry bore the title On the Philosophy of the Oracles (•σερ) τ Us ix λογίων φιλοσοφ!:as); it comprised three volumes״a . We know it chitfly by the long excerpts inserted by Eusebius into his Praeparatio Evangelica. Porphyry's intention —as revealed in the title, and set forth in the introduction—was to demon-strate in this work the concordance of the cognitions of the philosophers with the oracles of the gods. The mental weariness, the distrust of the intellect, the spiritual disillusionment of the epoch, are expressed in Porphyry's introductory remarks : \"The utility of this collection can be appreciated most of all by those who having experienced at some time the birth-throes of truth (i. e. metaphysical perception) have prayed to receive a divine revelation, and thus to obtain through the trustworthy teaching of its spokesmen a surcease of׳philosophical perplexity\"21. This yearning for revelation accounts for Porphyry's readiness to admit the inspired character of the Chaldaean Oracles. It seems therefore strange that in his principal work on the philosophical significance of the oracles there has been found no trace of a utilisation of these Chaldaean prophecies 22 of which he speaks with such rcverence elsewhere. As a matter of fact, the philologists were at fault in this question. This was not for lack of a pointer to the true facts of the case. A quotation, trans-mitted by the Byzantine Neoplatonist Lydus and mentioning a basic Chaldaean concept, is plainly described in his introductory formula as \" See Bidez. p. 5a*, 18; p. 70* No. 50.

Our contention with regard tt this capital work of Porphyry is borne out by a scrutiny of the prophecies figuring in it, many of which are of Chaldaean origin.

(όχβτοι) and \"Might\" (xrfproi)27; and the main ontological and cosmoiogical ideas which can be discerned in the two texts are alike. We cannot interpret at this stage of our investigation all the details of this hymn. A full discussion of the subject will be found in a subsequent chapter, which treats of the Chaldean system as a whole. At this point, we shall in examining this text only deal with those doctrines which may be considered as having a capital importance for the Chaldean teachings. Porphyry's hymn recognizes a supreme ineffable Father of the gods who is called \"mystes\", because he does not disclose the mystery of his nature. His unity is emphatically affirmed in a series of predicates vv. 13-14 : \"Most kingly AH-Father and only Father of the mortals and the happy immortals\". Thus we meet in these verses with one of the main ideas of Chaldean theology, which insists upon the fundamental difference between the supreme king of gods and the other immortals18. The hierarchy of the supercelestial world is relatively the easiest to understand. Three powers must be distinguished : the supreme Father invoked power to fulfil I he prayer (v. 4; cf. PROCL., Hymn. 11.14, and the parallels adduced by LUOWICII, ad loc.). Next (v. 6) comes au exposition of the might of the god, in this case an enumeration of the \"Powers\" (Ιυνάμεΐί) subservient to him; its beginning is marked by ihe typical yap. The hymnic form accounts for the use of σοι instead of σον in v. .1 (NORDEN, loc. cil., 150 and 158. Cf. IOEII, Geburt des Kindes, p. 67, 11. 1) and of the participles in v. ·נ and 4 (see NORDEN, Affn. Theos, 166 f.). \" Already WolIT, p. 144, 11. 10-11 (after Thilo), has remarked upon this ler-minological concordance, but without drawing the obvious conclusion. A. D. NOCK, Conversion, 110, also points out a \"suspicious\" resemblance between the hymn of the \"Theosophy\" and the Chaldtean Oracles.

He is exalted above the \"Eternal Strength\" whose \"Vigour\" is fixed on the ethereal back above the \"cosmos\" (in the singular : meaning the world of the planets) and the \"starry heaven\" (the zone of the fixed stars). By means of the \"golden\" rays of His ״Vigour of Strength\", which are called \"Eternally flowing channels\", the supreme Father suckles the third hypostasis, the \"Intellect\" (1׳ow); it is the Intellect who is the actual maker of this world. He fashions the ״imperishable matter\" in accordance with the forms with which the Su-preme God has \"bound\" it. The specific relationship obtaining between the members of this triad : The Father of the gods, the feminine principle, the Intellect creator of the world, conforms exactly to the doctrine of the Chaldean Oracles 3(1. In his active aspect, the supreme God, the noetic primordial Fire, causes His \"Vigour of Strength\", known as the \"First Intellect\", to generate the ideas who form the \"Second Intellect\" (which is designated in the hymn as voSs). These ideas constitute the \"spiritual immortal form\" which the Supreme God has created before the corporeal world, and serve as a model for it. As He himself does not enter in to contact with matter, He has charged with the copying of this form the Second Intellect, whom the Chaldeans for this reason call \"the Artisan\". The relationship between the \"Second Intellect\" and his originator, the primordial Source of the Ideas, is described in the hymn quoted by Porphyry as that between a son and his mother. The feminine principle \"suckles this world-forming Intellect by means of the \"eternally flowing rays\", that is to say the Forms which spring forth from her; the Second Intellect is the sum total of these Forms. The second part of the hymn (vv. 13-19) contains a description of the ministering spirits. Its meaning is elucidated by a scholium added by Porphyry : ״This oracle gives knowledge of three orders of angels : those who perpetually stand before God; those who arc separated \" See cli.,״ n. 8C.

The Chaldean Oracles differentiate between various classes of angels. Unfortunately, we possess but scanty information on this subject. The first of the angelic orders figuring in the hymn is not mentioned elsewhere in the extant Oracles, but is known from Jewish angelology. It is compos-ed of the archangels who perpetually surround the highest God •2.י Some further details as to the second angelic order will be obtained later on from a new Chaldean fragmentM . This order comprises the ministering angels, who inhabit all the parts of the world (cf. the hymn, v. 14 : \"They are separate from Thee\"); and who, acting upon the decision of the \"Fa-tlier\", help the faithful in their need. The hymn describes them as the messengers of the \"First-born Intellect\", and of the \"Might\" of the Supreme God. As the \"Father\" has no contact with the lower world, these angels are sent forth by two of His hypostases. The third order (likewise not mentioned in the other extant Chaldean Oracles) is constituted by the angels who bear the throne of the Supreme God and praise Him perpetually in their chants. It is evident that the origin of these bearers of the Throne must be sought in Jewish angelology; there we find the Cherubs who form the mystic chariot of \" Wolff, 145 f.; Buresch, 104, No. 28 : (hi τρεί! τάζε is αγγέλων ό χρrןσμόs OVTOS IR/λοϊ των άεί τω &·εω •ααρεσΊύτων, των χωριζομένων χύτού χαί ει» αγγελίαs χαί 81 axovias τινάs αποστελλομένων χαί των φερόντων άεί τόν αύτοϋ Q-ρόνον.

The text of the Chaldean hymn is paralleled by magical oath-formulas, in-iluenced by these Jewish doctrines, which invoke the God \"Who rides on the chariot of the Cherubs and is hymned by the orders of the an-Is\" 0נ. It is an interesting fact that the hymn—as well as the Jewish apocalyptic writings—designates the angels as \"saints\" and \"sons of God\"יב · These traces of Jewish influence can be adduced in support of the Chaldean origin of the hymn. For Kroll has shown that this influence can be perceived in the doctrine of the Theurgists38. There is reason to suppose that the Chaldeans acquired their knowledge of Jewish teach-ing in an indirect way, through the medium of the Judaizing magical writings. These have probably brought also Jewish angelology to their ken, an angelology which at that time exercised a deep influence (proved by the magical papyri) on the votaries of the occult sciences. At this point we shall conclude for the time being the interpretation of the hymn. Many of the problems posed by the text (such as that of the identity of the \"sons\" who are supposed to chant this hymn) are best answered in the course of the general account of the Chaldean system which will be given in the next chapter. יי b καθήμενο! έπί των Χερουβείμ : LXX Ps.

Before resuming our research for further Chaldean Oracles we must inquire into the transmission of the hymn. It has been handed down in a late extract from the so-called Prophecies of the heathen Gods, a Christian compilation dating from the end of the 5th century, which is perhaps better known as the Theosophy of Tuebingen, a designation given to it by its editor Buresch, after the locality where the most important of its Mss. was found 3'J. The author of this work wishes to prove that the prophecies of the heathen gods and the utterances of the Oriental and Greek sages \"concord with the intention of the Holy Scriptures\"4\". With a view to this demonstration he quotes a series of oracles and amongst them the hymn which has engaged our attention. This is introduced by him in express terms as an extract from the second book of Porphyry's Philosophy of the Oracles. The source of the other oracles quoted in the Theosophy and ascribed, for their greater part, to Apollo is not indical-ed with the same explicitness. It seems probable that other oracles figuring in the Prophecies of the heathen Gods may have been extracted from Porphyry's celebrated work. Photius who knew the Christian compilation in its entirety, remarks that it contained among other matters also Chaldean Oracles'11. It may consequently be presumed that the \" K. BURBSCII, Klaros.

We shall see below (p. 96, 11. 67) that such a work was known already to Didymusof Alexandria, the teacher of Hieronymus. One thing is certain : the unknown Christian author, whose work was used byThe author of the Theosophy, has drawn to no small extent upon Porphyry's work On tin! Philosophy of ike Oracles.

At the same time, the scholium attached to it permits to regard ft as an extract from Porphyry's work On the Philosophy of the Oraclesfor Porphyry has added similar, almost literal, prose paraphrases to various other oracular poems quoted by him An examination of the termino-logy of the scholium should transform this supposition into virtual cer-taintv. The term \"noetic fire\" and the explanation of the Homeric expression \"to tear the heart away from\" (Odyss., I, 48) as \"soul's divi-sion with regard to the sensible world\" point unmistakably to Neoplatonic speculation\".

Two other words which describe him are \" incorporeal\" and \" immaterial\", both of which are habitually applied to transcendent entities. \"Self-manifest\" which, as the first word of Apollo's reply, is emphasised, points once more to the Chaldean origin of this Oracle. For it fits in with a passage of the first of Apollo's Oracles examined here which states that \" God\" becomes visible when the \" Father\" wills it, and that His fiery epiphany effects the mystic illumination of the soul. Proclus relates that the Theurgists used the magical art to bring about a \"self-manifestation\" (auro<pdveta) of the god Chronos; we shall see that this God is identical with the Aion of the Theoxophy59. Iamblichus does nothing but develop this Chaldean doc-trine when he affirms that the \" illumination\" of the im׳oked gods is \" self-manifest\" M.

The sphere of the ether is situated beneath this zone and draws from it its light. It is in this sphere that the sun, the moon and the planets (between which this text—as well as the first Oracle of Apollo—differentiates) move. Their light is \" feebler\", because the ray of the Primordial Fire becomes less powerful, as the distance between it and its source increases.

The three Oracles which have already been interpreted have given us knowledge of the mythical-symbolic language used by the Chalde-S״me This knowledge may be extended by a scrutiny of the three concluding erses of the Hymn transmitted in the Theosophy (No. 39) which has engaged our attention at the beginning of this chapter. These verses nre separated from the Hymn by a disquisition on the angelic orders inserted by Porphyry who seems to have been particularly interested in the subject, but are described by him as belonging to the same Oracle, and appear to continue, with no sign of a break, the text of the Hymn 5 .יAccordingly, we ·may legitimately infer that they reproduce the \" perpe-tual\" song of praise which the angels address to their Father—evidently corresponding to the Trisagion. The practice of alining a considerable number of divine predicates in an invocation of the Supreme Being has many counterparts in Oriental and Hellenistic doxologies 58. His omni-potence is described in the following terms : \"Thou art the Father; the Mother's radiant form; the Children's \" Several limes, in the Philosophy of the Oracles Porphyry quotes parts of the same oracle separately. Thus, the seven verses Iransmilted by EDSKBIOS, Praep. Eo.

The author of the oracle quoted n. 5G seems to have been desirous of imitating certain doxologies of chanting angels. We may cite, by way of comparison, a hymn 0 the angels, quoted, with a few variations, both by DIDYNDS, de trmitale, III, 9 1 י· ®·׳ XXXIX, 913 A) and EPIPHANIUS, Ancorahis, 35 ,ך, and probably ·ving from a common apocryphical source, which we have no means of identify-st^ J,hinc!'Ihe G,ory' Thine ie lhe Power' Thioc is the Force· Thine is U1e n&lh\" (Epiphan.

The doxology contains a series of symbolic terms, intended to express the identity of the Supreme Being with the entities in which He unfolds Himself. For, according to a fundamental Chaldean doctrine, the ״Fa-ther\" is the ineffable One, from which the entire hierarchy of the celestial beings and powers springs.

The term ״Nodding of Intellect\" is applied to the volitions of H.s m.nd «׳. \"In-ct\" and \"Nodding\" are, according to the Chaldean Oracles, two ״like-minded\" divine faculties. \"Nodding\" (νεϋμα), like many other Chaldean terms, derives from a line of Homer. The nodding of Zeus which shakes the Olympus {Iliad I, 5a7/8) serves in the Chaldean Oracles as a designation for the \"Father's\" will: \"The Father's Intellect commanded that all things should be divided into three parts. His Will nodded, and immediately all was divided\"70. \"Nodding\" is thus a poetical equivalent for \"Volition\" (Βοι/λι/), a faculty of the \"Father\", which, together with His Intellect, issues out of Him, when He is in His active aspect. The identity of the seven potencies enumerated in the same Oracle as being subject to the \"Great God\" and the Will of His \"Intellect\" is not certain, but this is only a natural consequence of the fragmentary state in which the Chaldean Oracles have been transmitted, of the fluidity of their terminology and of the intentional obscurity of their language. The last tendency is particularly noticeable in this Oracle owing to the accu-mulation of no less than six synonymous terms for Divine Strength within two lines. Two facts may, however, help to elucidate the exact meaning of this list. In the first place, as in the foregoing Oracle, the terms figur-mg in this passage may be supposed to signify noetic potencies. Since the First Principle and His Intellect are introduced in the first line as the ruling powers, only Aion and the Cosmic Soul can be taken into account. In the second place, other parallels in the Chaldean Oracles lead to the conclusion that the first entity of this sequence, \"Beginning and Source of Life\", as well as the last, \"Revolving Necessity\", refer to the Cosmic Soul, and that some of the synonymous terms used there for Strength also On ihe Chaldean hypostasis of the Will, see ch. 11, seel. 3, in particular N. /19. \" See ch.  05!  .11  ,וו."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"to CHAPTER I. appear in the extant Chaldean Oracles as designations of this entity וי Thus, we may be justified in inferring that the seven terms are all of them different periphrastic designations of the Cosmic Soul 1.י This terrnino-logical exuberance is paralleled by that in the foregoing Oracle; Aion not mentioned in this enumeration is, likewise, omitted in the doxology. The Oracle we have just examined is intended to proclaim the monar-chical rule of the Supreme God and to dissuade from the worship of infer-ior powers. A similar monotheistic tendency is evinced by the Oracle on the God Aion which ends upon Apollo's confession that Aion alone may fitly be called God, and that \"We, the angels are only a small troop of God\" 73. A statement which draws our attention to the yet unexamined problems of Chaldean angelology.

The debate between (he Christians and llie Heathens centred in the definition of the position of Ihe inferior gods. While these were regarded by llie Heathens as autonomous helpers of the supreme God, Ihe Christians refused to allow them even a limited indepcndance and attacked those who worship-ped the servants instead of the master (LI. PETERSON , Der Monotheismus als polilisches Problem, Leipzig 1935, 47 f.). For this reason, the Christians were wont to quote Heathen texts which represent the gods as angels (MINUC.

The substitution of the Will for the \"Father\" is due to the principle that the faculties 0Γ the Supreme Being must serve as intermediaries in all the relations sub-sisting between Him and the world.

This supposition is confirmed by the location of these spirits : they are said to \"abide scattered in the drifting world\". \"Drifting world\", χόσμο! άλη'μων, should be understood here as a pictorial designation of the planetarv cosmos, which is often termed similarly in later Greek poetry ~'J. Accord-ingly, we may infer that the Oracle which we are examining is pronounced by the sidereal angelsH0; the assertion of its Christian transmitter that it is uttered by Apollo as the spokesman of the (planetary) gods must be regarded as erroneous. This conclusion is in accord with the fact that by no means all the Chaldaean Oracles were attributed to Apollo ; as we have already pointed out81, some of them were ascribed to other celestial beings. As an example we may mention a Chaldean fragment in which the Souls describe —in the first person, as the angels do in the Oracle— their entering into the human bodies82. We may consequently take it as established that the Oracle contains a description of one of the principal functions of the order of the ministering angels. \" See ch. 11, n. 41). \" χόσμο* άλήτηί as designation of the plauetarv world is frequently used by Nonnus. άλήμων or άλήτηί is synonymous with wAat;»׳r;* or Ίπλάνηί. \" As 10 Ihe stellar angels see CUMONT, Lei anges du paganistne (quoted above p. 14, n. 3a), .p. 174 f.

First of all we may deal with the seemingly different literary tone of the Prophecies of the Theotophy (χρησμοί) as compared with the Chaldean Oracles (λόγια) collected by Kroll. The subjective note is much more perceptible in the first group. There we are confronted with Apollo's personal reaction to the questions. The God proclaims his intention to keep the. secret of his supreme knowledge; reproves the temerity of the questioner who presumes on his familiarity with natural science 83; gives practical instructions84; and humbly acknowledges the supremacy of the one and only God85. The realistic literary form of the Prophecies of the Theotophy may be regarded as another distinctive trait. These texts centain the exact wording of the questions and, in one case, even mention the name of the questioner (Theophilus)M.

The Logion of Proclus proves that the literary form of the Chald;can Oracles was much less simple and more variable than the quotations of the Neoplatonists would lead us to suppose. The interest of these philo-sophers was obviously engaged by the doctrinal passages of these texts, which, as they believed, corroborated their own teaching. Their distinct-ive literary form seemed, from this particular point of view, to be irrelevant. Accordingly, the choice of quotations made by the Neoplatonists could not but produce a deceptive impression.

In many Chaldean Oracles the god addresses directly the questioner, apostrophizes him the second person singular, or, if his words concern mortals in general, in the second person plural<J7. The tone of these divine utterances is sometimes very subjective. A case in point is the attack on those \"who do not know that every god is good. Ο fools, become sober\"08! The Chaldean Oracles speak with scathing contempt of the \"herd-animals\" and the \"somatics\"and stigmatize with bitter scorn the over-weening \"conceit of the puny humans\" ,0״; and again and again they express their reprobation for \"impure\" matter101. Moreover the Chaldean Oracles contain numerous imperatives, com-mandments as well as interdictions ,02. The gods of the Theurgists often seem to adopt the style of moralizing preachers of religion, which is also characteristic of some treatises in the Hermetic writings103. Thus, the expository mode was by no means as predominant in the Chaldean Oracles as the quotations of the Neoplatonists would lead us to believe. At this point we must recall that the first of the texts quoted in the present work from the Theosophy was not an oracle, but a hymn addressed to the Supreme God. The quotations of the Chaldean Oracles made by Proclus and his disciples also include passages from hymns to the celestial powers; among them a fragment from a prayer to the gods Cf., e.g., the lines quoted ch. 11, n. 181 as well as ch. ιν, η. ί>η and n. 68; ®nd approximately six other instances.

The Theurgists have been taught these prayers by the Chaldean gods. For they believe, in accordance with a basic principle of magical science, that only the gods themselves knew the spells that could compell their presence. Proclus often affirms that the gods them-selves had communicated to the founders of Chaldean mystagogv their own divine secrets and those of the cosmic orders ; a supernatural teaching that enabled these men to perform their conjurations.

It has been suggested that all the extant verses of the Chaldean Oraclcs are extracted from a didactic theological poem108. This is highly improb-able. For one thing the dialogue between the god and the human inter-locutor appears to be incompatible with the assumption of a continuous exposition. The variations in the use of doctrinal terms which are to be found in the Chaldean Oracles can be better accounted for on the suppo-sition that these (like the Prophecies of the Theosophy) form a collec-tion of oracular pronouncements; all of these must have been informed by an identical theological doctrine, but for the rest there was no external connection between them.

It can hardly be due to chance. We may suppose that the later Neoplatonists (perhaps already Iamblichus) have singled out one particular group out of the collection of the Theurgists in order to canonize it if we may use this expression. A parallel instance can be found in their treatment of the Orphic literature. One only of these texts, a long theogonic poem (ό Upbs λόγοβ), comprising 1U rhapsodies, which was likewise first introduced to the Neoplatonists by Porphyry, was considered by the later members of this school as the authentic document of Orphism; and it was the only one quoted by Proclus n0.

In the writings of the later Neoplatonists we find some infrequent citations of works of Julian the Theurgist other than the Chaldean Oracles. Thus Proclus quotes from a work bearing the title On the Celestial Zones (otherwise unknown) the paraphrase of a hymn to Chronos, with which the Theurg-ists conjured the god111. The next chapter will show that this God of Eternity is identical with the Aion of the Prophecies of the Theotophy, and that the very peculiar conceptions on which this hymn is based conform in every particular to the doctrines of the Chaldean Oracles. It follows that at least one of the other works of Julian also contained magical hymns of which he was the author and that these derive from a theosophical system identical with that of the Chaldean Oracles. It may thus be argued that the Oracles quoted by Proclus and the Prophecies quoted by Porphyry are extracted from two different collections of revealed Chaldaean verses. In any case, one thing is certain : the Chaldean Oracles quoted by Proclus and by his disciples do not differ either in their style or in their tenets from the Prophecies quoted by Porphyry. In conse-quence, the fact that the Prophecies of the Theosophy with which we are concerned are not mentioned in the writings of Proclus' school can by no means he regarded a sufficient reason for contesting the attribution of these texts to the Chaldeans 1'2. 2.

On p. $g he cites from Porphyry's Philosophy of the Oracles an oracle of Hecate as a parallel to the Chaldaean Oracles of Hecate, but without recognising the Chaldean origin of this text. The same is true with the quotation from the Theosophy (Nr. 15: see ch. 11, n. 63) adducedJby Kroll p. .68, n. 3. \"· The term \"theurgy\" is a Chaldean neologism; as to ils exact meaning and history, see Excursus IV."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"30 NEW CHALDjGAN ORACLES. f divine things\"), they were also the initiators into the rites and the mysteries of a sacramental community, the priests of which were able b־ their magical craft to render the higher powers subject to their will. Thus their secret cult is a blend of sublime mysticism, centring in the noetic Fire, and of magical materialism. Several of its ceremonies are described by Proclus and by the Byzantine Neo-Platonist Psellus (whose information derives from the Athenian philosopher). But to eke out our knowledge of the mystagogy of the theurgists we must once more have recourse to a series of oracles quoted by Porphyry in his Philosophy of the Oracles. The identification and interpretation of this new group of documents will form the subject-matter of the second half of the first chapter. A full account of the Chaldean ritual, the neglect of which by Kroll detracts—as Bidez has pointed out11''—from the validity of his conclusions, will be given in the course of an exposition of the complete theurgical system. The persons officiating at the secret gatherings were : the priests, the \"callers\" (xktfropes) and the \"recipients\" (ίοχεΓ5) '15. The preserved texts furnish no information as to the functions of the members of the first group ; those of the second invoked the gods with magical formulae and compelled them to appear; those of the third \"received\" the conjured god, and served as a medium for his oracle. We find in the works of Proclus only one verse referring to the function of the Chaldean \"recipients\" ; one of the Chaldean gods utters the enigmatic words : \"The recipient's wretched heart does not sustain me\"116.

The quotation transmitted by Proclus is more par-ticularly paralleled by the following verse of this group : \"Loose the Ruler at last. The mortal can no longer contain the god\"118. The Chaldeans and others apply the title \"Ruler\" (άναξ) to Apollo119: it is he who possesses the \"recipient\" and who demands to be loosed, as the mortal can no longer \"contain\" him. We may accordingly suppose that the \"recipient\" had \"contained\" the god120 for some length of time and that the latter had spoken out of his mouth. Either of the two quoted verses probably formed the conclusion of an oracle uttered by the god while sojourning in the body of his \"recipient\". In another verse cited by Porphyry the god himself imparts the knowledge of the magical rite which \"looses\" him : \"Spread out the cloud of linen, and loose the recipient\"121.

The Delphic priestess visited by the god is often compared to a woman that conceives123. The term \"recipient\" applied by the Chaldeans to their prophets originated in similar materialistic notions. It is a note-worthv fact that this term is only found in the Chaldean Oracles and in the two verses quoted by Porphyry; it is not encountered in any Greek text independent of Chaldean tradition120.

He relates there that a Chaldasan charged the failure of his magical operations upon another practiser of the occult arts: for the latter had bound the powers conjured by the Chaldtcan, who was unable to loose them130. Porphyry's narration is corroborated by Psellus, according to whom the Chaldeans used to bind and to loose the gods131. These texts enable us to intcrprete the meaning of the following verse of the Chalda5an Oracles, transmitted by Proclus : \"The sluggish mortal, who turns (his mind) thither (to the earth), is the loosing of the god\" 132. The Oracle signifies that the theurgist whose mind turns to earthlv thoughts is unable to hold the conjured up god and to prevent his taking himself off133. \"Hatt ich die Kraft dich anzuziehn besessen, so hatt ich As to these magical rites see HOPFNER, O.-Z., I, 878.

While, as regards the practicc of the rites of epirlesis and apolysix, the magicians had much in common with the Chaldeans, they did not seem to have recognized the need of an officiant—other than the \"caller\"— whose particular function was that of the \"recipient\". We do not find in the entire magical literature, consisting of the papyri and of the literary texts, a single mention of a \"recipient\" into whom the god or the demon enters and out of whose mouth he speaks. Moreover such a medium seems unnecessary, for the invoked god, or one of his ministering spirits, appear in person or enter into the \"caller\" 1:15. We may therefore sup-pose that the Chaldeans derived their conception of the \"recipient\" (as well as their idea of the function performed by Apollo) from oracular usage. This supposition is corroborated by an oracle of Apollo which Porphyry quotes in full; he is justified in considering this oracle a classical example of prophetic pneumatology : '·The stream separating from the splendour of Phoebus on high, and enveloped in the sonorous breath of the pure air, falls enchanted by songs and by ineffable words about the head of the blameless recipient.

The hymn of the \"Theosophy\" quoted above1/,u also considers the oracle-giving Apollo as identical with the ruler of the sun. According to the Chaldaean conception, the sun's existence is maintained by the noetic primordial Fire, while the solar rays bring about the mystic illumination11.׳' The luminous stream of prophetic pneuma likewise originates in the divine substance which the sun is deemed to be142. d) The prophetic pneuma, in the course of its descent from the etherial zone, is \"enveloped in air\". According to a kindred Chaldaean doctrine, the fiery spark of the human soul, during its descent from its super-celestial place of origin into the earthly body, acquires a vesture formed out of the substances of the spheres which its traverses143. The aerial envelope of the prophetic pneuma corresponds to the outermost layer of this psychic body; for, as the last of the cosmic zone to be traversed consists of air, this layer is formed out of that substance 1''׳,. e) In the prophet's body the luminous pneuma is transformed into a voice which utters the oracle.

Thus, the corporal organs of the \"recipient\" serve as the instruments of the god.   '   This conception which supposes that the human body is possessed by the god and that the \"recipient\", when in the state of enthusiasm, is entirely passive, conforms to notions that were widely disseminated in later Antiquity. According to Plutarch, the interrogators of the Pythia believed that the god—like the demon in the case of the soothsaying ventriloquists—entered into the body of the prophetess 145, spoke out of her mouth and used her voice as an instrument. Philo is persuaded that the words uttered by a genuine prophet do not belong to him, but to Another, Whose interpreter he is. He compares him to a musical instrument touched by God. His mouth and his tongue are organs which, in accordance with unknown laws, give forth melodious speech. Philo, personally, has experienced states in which an invisible pneuma speaks out of him 146. Similar views are evinced in the ecstatic speeches of the Christian gnostic Montanus, a contemporary of the author of the Chal-dean Oracles. Like the latter, Montanus delivers the speech of the spirit by whom he is possessed in the first person, and speaks of himself in the third. His \"spirit\" also uses the simile of the musical instrument. '•Behold, the man is like a lyre, and I fly up to him like a plectrum\"1\". The voice of the pneuma is compared in the Oracle to a pipe (or to a flute). The mystical character of this simile is obscured by the anato-mical aetiology, the precision of which has its counterpart in the expla-nation of the musical instrument given by Plutarch and Philo.

It is however frequently employed in Persian mystical poetry which expresses, with an unsurpassed plenitude, the potential motifs of mystical language. f) The realistic description of the epiclesis of the prophetic spirit and of his effluence is akin, in its insistence on material details, to the Chaldean account of the Fire which flows through channels (that is the solar rays) out of the sun to the earth, and is inhaled by the initiate.

Some information regarding these conjurations can be drawn from several of the oracles quoted in Porphyry's work On the Philosophy of the Oracles. The terminology and the tenets of these oracles point once more to a Chaldean origin. The first of the oracles which will now engage our attention is delivered by Hecate.

She is the Cosmic Soul, who manifests herself to the Theurgist and reveals her place in the divine hierarchy : \"I dwell behind the Father's thoughts, I, the Soul, who with heat, do ensoul all things\"50.י Proclus and the members of his school have also transmitted other Chaldean Oracles purporting to have been uttered by Hecate.

The passage in which, affirming die truth of her oracles, she recalls this descent has its counterpart '11 a Chalda5an Oracle which states that \"nothing unaccomplished rushes (i e. proceeds) from the Paternal Principle\" 155. Hecate is the goddess from whom the infallible prophecies of the \"wise spokesmen «f the gods\" derive. This function is common to her and to the Apollo of the Chalda;an mysteries. Both of them deliver oracles ; and as we shall see, Apollo, too, was invoked by the theurgists by means of binding spells. The similarity between the Chaldamn Apollo and Hecate is not only manifested in the fact of their being the two oracle-giving divinities ; it is also evinced by their localisation in the universe. Hecate proclaims that she is \"irradiated by Truth\" (αλήθεια.) and that \"about her stays firm Understanding striding with irrefragable words\". The verbs appear to indicate that the terms \"Truth\" and \"Understanding\" apply to astral powers '56. According to the popular belief adopted by the Chaldaeans, Hecate is the mistress of the moon 117; consequently she receives light from the all-seeing Sun, who as the abode of the oracle-giving Apollo was worshipped as a symbol of Truth 1r,s. \"Understanding\" who stays about the moon \"striding with irrefragable words\" (άρρήχτοισι λογΐοα) must accordingly connote the spiritual faculty of the planet Mercury-Hermes, the sphere of which revolves around that of the moon. This planet appears to have been endowed with this particular quality because Cf. cli. 11, n. 191. άμφιΚαίνω (in prose περιτρέχω, περίνολέω), is applied to the course of the sun in Iliad., VIII, 68, and to that of the moon in ps.

Thus this oracle of Hecate seems to prove that the planets, identified by the Chal-dean theurgists with the Greek gods whose name they bore, could also be designated by the distinctive virtues of these gods. Planetary virtues of a similar nature are mentioned several times in the Chaldean Oracles. Thus Hecate is once characterized as containing in herself the \"source of virtue\" 59,י a description due to her being the mistress of the moon; the supposed -faculty of which was in this case determined by her tradi-tional connection with Proserpina, known as \"The Virgin\" (K4p»>). According to another oracle \"Virtue, Wisdom and thoughtful Truth are manifested\" within Cosmic Soul (i. e. within the intramundane zone \"engirdled\" by this entity)160. The verb \"manifested\" indicates once again that we are confronted with an astral allegory. Virtue being the moon and Truth the sun, Wisdom placed between the two can be iden-tified, with some degree of probability, with the \"Understanding\" of the oracle of Hecate quoted by Porphyry, viz. with the planet Mercury; this explanation fails however to account for the omission of the planet Venus situated between Mercury and the sun. The faculties of \"Virtue, Wisdom and Good-rule\" which, according to a third oracle, \"are met together\" in the Chaldean paradise also seem to indicate planetary virtues161. Though the details of the proposed interpretations of these passages may not be equally convincing, we seem to have established that the Oracles described in the extant texts as Chaldean, as well as the Oracle of Hecatc quoted by Porphyry, designate the planets by the names of their qualities. This point of agreement lends further strength to the view which attributes to the latter Oracle a Chaldean origin.

Eo., V, β 4· Wolff, 155 f.) may be inferred from its describing Ihe moon as a permanent abode of ihe goddess (Ihe \"aery house\" behind which Hecale is slaying is the sun; consequently Ihe moon is her dwelling-place); this conception is opposed to that of the Chaldeans who believe that this goddess descends to the moon from her noetic dwelling-place when invoked by one of them. (The two last verses of this oracle are almost entirely identical with an oracle of Hecale, which Porphyry quotes imme-dialely afterwards; see Eus., Pr. Ευ., V, 8, & and Wolff 156). Another oracle quoted by Porphyry (Eus.. Pr. Eo., IV, 33, 7; W01IT151) can be shown to benon-Chaldean, as Hecate affirms in il her identity with Persephone and Artemis, and boasts her empire over the demons of the ether, air and earth. This unification of the three goddesses formed no part of doctrine of the Chaldeans who moreover in-voked Hecale as the \"driver of the aery, earthy and watery dogs\" (». e. demons; sec ch. v, u. 41), that is a different group of three elements. In three other 110η-Chaldean oracles quoted by Porphyry (apvd Eus., Pr. Eo., V. 8,6-7; Wolff 156 f.), Hecale complains of the magicians who compell her to appear against her will. It is true that the Chaldeans also employ binding-spells (sec nole 184), but tbese as well as the magical ritual are communicated to 111cm by ihe invoked gods themselves. Consequently a misuse of the power conferred by this knowledge could only result 111 failure, and would by no means have a coercive effect on the gods. Another trail common to all Ihe oracles of this group is ihe lack of any mention of the Supreme God. Against this must be held the doctrine of the Chaldeans who taught that Hecate like all the other celestial powers, was subject to the \"Father's\" will (viz. that of Hie Intellect) and that her manifestations during the conjuration of Ihe chaldeans were consequent upon his decision. Other oracles quoted in Porphyry's Philosophy of the Oracles may also be dis-linguished from those of the Chaldeans. For instance, the four fragments which contain instructions as to how to make and consecrate Hecale's statue and thus crealc the requisite conditions for a nocturnal apparitiou of the goddess (Nos. 1 and 3: Eus., Pr- Eo., V, 1a, 1-3; Wolff 130 f.

Thus this relationship reflects the competition between theurgy and the lower forms of magic 103. The remaining two oracles of Hecate quoted by Porphyry have recourse to fundamental Chaldean notions, and thus betray their origin. One of them is composed of two answers (resembling in this respect the Logion on the soul that we have shown to be Chaldaean)1M : ״Hecate when invoked during an unfavourable constellation of the stars, answered : '1 do not speak, I shall shut the gates of the long aerial tube. For ׳upon the most unpropitious vaults of heaven the horned goddessTitania 'approaches, looking at the malignant Ares'. And when some persons asked whether the gods themselves were subject to the domination of the stars, as they were heedful of it, Hecate began again : 'Free thyself from the bonds of nature in order that I obey thy bonds ! '0 man, what babblest thou, stricken with impotence? Desirest thou which did not belong to the Chaldaean doctrine; see ch. iv, 11. 103. There are also the anti-Christian Oracles of Hecate (Eus., Dein. Eo., Ill, 6; AUGUSTIISE, do. Dei, XIX, 93; Wolff 180 f.) expressive of the politico-religious tendencies of their time. According to the general scheme of magical oracles the conjured god declares his identity and names the place where he heard the invocation. Besides the lirst two oracles of Hecate quoted note 1, cf. also the beginning of an oracle of Hermes quoted by Porphyry (Eus., Pr.

In the second oracle, this Nature is called \"Strength\" (dXxrf), a designation familiar to us from the Chaldean Oracles which apply this term to the Cosmic Soul, i. e. Hecate 16.י At the same time they identify Hecate with Nature and Destiny (Heimarmene); for she rules the stars in accordance with the law of Necessity, and the terrestrial zone by means of the \"multifluous streams\" of demons descending from her. These maleficent spirits lead man astray and bid him to give way to his appetites ; for then his thoughts are no longer turned towards divine things, and he is in the־ power of the demons. For this reason, the Chaldean Oracles utter the following warnings : \"Nature wishes to persuade you that the demons are pure and the offsprings of evil Matter good and noble\" ; and \"The demons are beguiling the soul and drawing her away from the purifications\" ,ns. Man can only defend himself against the overwhelming power of the demons, if his body and his soul are always pure. This holds good to much greater extent for the theurgist : every rite designed to bring about a contact with the celestial powers has to be preceded by manifold lustra-tions : \"For before thou hast consecrated thy body, thou art not allowed to sec the gods\" '6,. If the theurgist fails to perform the magical rites according to the divine commandments, \"god turns man away from Himself and sends him through the agency of Living Power on vain paths\" 0״. \"Living Power\"—as well as \"Strength\"—is a term applying to Hecqte-Psyche-Physis-Heimarmene. The passage is meant to convey that the theurgist who commits a ritual fault is abandoned by Hecate to her demonic satellites who, by the delusions which they produce, bring about the failure of all the efforts of their victim. These doctrines on which Chaldean demonology is based not only help us to understand, the two oracles quoted from Porphyry, but also to prove their Chaldean origin.

In consequence, he is \"bound by Nature\", that is to say by the evil spirits subject to Hecate, and must avoid the men with whom he habitually consorts, in order to become capable of \"receiving the god\" 2.יי As we may infer from Porphyry's introductory remark, the oracle also taught other apotropaic rites which help to sustain the demonic onslaught. Some of these rites will be examined in the chapter treating of Chaldaean demonology nn. A similar doctrine underlies the first oraclc quoted from Porphyry, as is shown by the concordance between its introductory verse and the interrogative formula of the second oracle. The answer signifies that not the gods but the mortals are \"bound by Nature\", or, in other words, ruled by the stars. Hecate addresses a stern rebuke (the wording of which is almost identical with that of the second of the Apollonic oracles of the Throxophy examined by us)1'יי to the puny men who presume to gain knowledge of the secrets of the divine powers 1,5.

The magical formulae are also communicated to the theurgists by the gods. Proclus relates that the Theurgists were taught by the gods the name of the various divine powers ; when they used these names in their invocations, performing at the same time the appropriate magical rites, the gods granted them their wishes181. These divine names are divided into two classes, the \"unutterable\" and the \"utterable\" ; the latter are applied to the visible cosmic orders, while the former, also termed ״symbols\", or \"watchwords\", designate the invisible powers. Incom-prehensible save to the gods, they correspond to the voces mysticae which figure in the magical papyri182. They are the \"ineffable words\" which are mentioned in one of the oracles of Apollo that we have quoted, and are said to occasion the descent of this god's prophetic pneuma 18s. The same oracle attributes a similar power to songs (μολπαΐ). Accordingly it would seem that the invocations of the \"callers\" consisted of hymns interspersed with voces mysticae. If this was the ease they have numerous parallels in the incantations figuring in the magical papyri. Both the hymns and the voces mysticae had power to bind. They brought about the manifestation of the god by \"enchanting him\", by \"persuading him\", Oracles. Proclus introduces many quotalions from ihe Ch.

The \"binding\" of the mystic light is figured by the Chaldceans as the onslaught of the theurgist armoured with a luminous body and weaponed with magical words. An oracle of Apollo which has recourse to equally impressive imagery is transmitted in Por-phyry's On the Philosophy of the Oraclrs; it consists of two parts, a single hexameter and several anapestic verses. First Apollo communicates a binding spell; he that utters it gains power over the god : \"This name of Necessity is mighty and weighty\".

According to the magicians, the name is the potency of the gods. By possessing it, one can dispose of the strength of its bearer '39. We may accordingly infer that the first pronouncement of Apollo was preceded by a passage setting forth the manner in which a particular god could be rendered subservient by the utterance of his mystic name. The god referred to can only be Apollo. He himself teaches his theurgists the method which they must use in order \"to bind\" him. Thus this oracle conforms to the didactic type, in which the god himself communicates the \"ineffable names\" to which he \"gives heed\" 190. Apollo says that he will \"lift up\" the person who utters the compelling formula \"from his heart\". We must recall in this connection that, according to Chalda5an theology, Apollo dwells in the sun which, being situated in the midmost planetary sphere, is called the \"centre\" of the ethereal zone191. He is consequently supposed to draw up the theurgist with the solar rays. These are called by the god the \"holy forms by which the pure fire is pressed\". This expression also appertains to the terminology of the Chaldseans, who distinguish between the amorphous manifestations of fire and those provided with a form : \"When thou seest the most holy Fire flash up without a form as it leaps over the depths of the whole world, hear the voice of the Fire\" 192. This amor-phous fire of the lightnings differs from the rays sent forth by Apollo; for these are endowed with form. The process described in the last oracle of Apollo is frequently men-tioned in the texts treating of the Chaldaean cult; it is the so-called \"elevation\", the principal sacrament of the Chaldaean theurgists, which culminates in the union of the soul of the initiate with the ray sent towards him from the sun193.

A parallel to Apollo's bidding \"to hasten storming\" with the magical \"words\" towards the rays of the sun is provided by the following injunctions of the Chaldaean Oracles : \"Rush to the centre of the roaring light\" (viz. the sun, the centre of the starry spheres which revolve in the ether); · Cast in the mind the watchword of the manifold universe, and move with a firm step towards the fiery rays' 1υΓ'· The warlike imagery renders in both eases the compulsion exercised by the magical operation. The details of the mystery with which the oracle of Apollo is concerned will be discussed in the third chapter ; here we may round 01Γ our obser-vations by an interpretation of the two last verses of the oracle. In these, the oracle-giving god calls himself by his traditional name \"Paian\" and alleges his descent from the \"Immortal\" in justification of his venturing to reveal the mystery. These remarks of Apollo should be likewise inter-preted in accordance with Chaldaean belief. Apollo-Helios—as well as all the other gods of the Chaldaeans—\"is generated\" by the \"All-Father\". Like all the other celestial entities, he performs his functions when called upon to do so by a particular decision of this Supreme Being196. Apollo's reference to this Being is consequently meant to convey that the god's revelations are given with the consent of the transcendent Father of the gods19'. We have encountered a similar passage in the first oracle of Hecate, in which the goddess alleges her descent from the \"Paternal \"s Sec chapter 111, n. 5g and 70. \"     Cf. Theos. No. 37, quoted above nole  26׳.  \"' This statement may be held against the passage of the second Oracle of Aion (quoted nole 59), in which Apollo accounts for his 1101 answering the questions posed by an unauthorized person as to the nature of god.

In the two concluding vei-ses of this oracle of Apollo, the god makes himself nown. It would have been more normal for him to do this at the beginning of e oracle (see note 163); however in two other Chaldeeau Oracles transmitted by orphyry (see notes 5a and 15a) a similar self-introduction figures likewise at the ed״ of the text."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II. 88 Intellect\" as a crowning proof of the truth of her assertions1e8· A refe-rence to the Supreme Being may be supposed to have instilled in the Chaldean theurgists the conviction that the revelation vouchsafed to them derived from the \"Father\" considered as the fountain-head of all wisdom. We have seen that the Chaldean doctrine furnishes a complete expla-nation for this last enigmatic oracle of Apollo. Does this fact entitle us to include this oracle in the collection of the Chaldean Oracles ? Only metrical considerations militate against this supposition. This oracle is anapestic, the other Chaldean verses hexametric. There is however one exception, and it invalidates this argument. The first of the series of verses dealing with the \"recipient\" is a trochee : in spite of which, Proclus describes it as a quotation from the Chaldean OraclesltH). In face of this positive assurance that a trochaic verse figured in these Oracles, we may no longer exclude from them anapestic verses on no grounds but the metrical200. The style and the contents of these verses which give a powerful expression to the enthusiasm of the Chaldean theurgists harmonize (as well as those of the trochaic verse) with the other Chaldean texts. Rather than attribute to them a different origin, we must modify our conception of the literary character of the Chaldean Oracles. These varied in their form (a fact which attests the literary aspirations of the theurgists) as much as in their contents. This diversity of forms is due to the development of oracular poetry See nole 15a. See note 116. \"־ A chapter of Wolff's work (\" Oracula 11011 hexainetris, sed aliis melris cdila '· pp. 68-90) deals with oracles written not iu hexameters, hut 111 iambic trimeters, trochees and dislichs.

Every type of oracle employed by them has its counterpart in the non-Chaldean oracular poetry. Thus the hymn of the Theotophy to the Supreme Being examined at the beginning of the present work has a parallel in a hymn to the Ruler of the worlds, which is also supposed to derive from Apollo201. Oracles of Apollo and of Hecate conforming in the literary composition to those of the Chaldeans have already been mentioned 202. Those two oracle-giving gods were said to manifest themselves to the magicians and to instruct them in the nature and method of conjurations; it is this fiction which accounts for their reception into tho magical Pandemonium. The Chaldaean Apollo and Hecate derive from the magical conceptions of these divinities, not from the tradition of long-established seats of oracles. Hecate reveals the rites of her adjurations and the way to make and to consecrate her image to other adepts of magical art as well as to the Chaldeans. The theological themes of the Chaldean Oracles also originate in the oracular poetry of their time. The Logion that speaks of the yearning of the soul for its heavenly place of origin, is paralleled by three oracles dealing with the destiny of the soul after its separation from the body; two of these are ascribed to Apollo of Miletus and to Apollonius of Tyana respectively, the third is anonymous 203. In conjunction with these we may also mention the famous oracle of Apollo describing in answer to a 1׳s.-JUSTIN, Cohoriatio ad Graecos, c. 38, quotes from a hymn in honour of the παντοκράτωρ the following verse «6» πρώτον πλάσα* μερόπων, Αδάμ Se χιλέσσαί».

Besides these, numerous theological oracles of Apollo are extant. Amongst them are two answers to a question as to the nature of the interrogated god 203 ; further an answer dealing with the god Iao 20*1,, as well as the functions of various other gods207. We may also mention the god's reply when asked in what sense it is possible to speak of several heavens 208, and whether immortality may be obtained through an austere life 2u9. The most interesting oracle of this class is the god's answer when asked : which was better, the Word (the Christian Logos), the Intellect (the Nous of the philosophers), or the Law (the Nomos of the Jews)210. Apollo is ready with an ingenious answer to this conundrum, doubtless posed by a theologian familiar with the religious discussions of the time. There is no need to prove that these oracle have nothing in common with Apollo's historical prophecies. They neither foretell the future nor do they give advice as to how to deal with personal difficulties. Their purpose is the revelation of the divine mysteries and theological instruc-tion, and their literary form is intended by their authors to serve as a sanction for the ideas which they propagate. The stylistic principles proper to the genre were taken over by the Chaldsean theurgists, who wished to invest their religious system with supernatural authority. Their originality lies in the consistency with which they pursued their literary task. No exposition of the doctrine of the mysteries in oracular verse had existed prior to them, and their example found no imitators.

The latter, however, enlarged upon and span out the ideas which they found congenial, and their additions are not always easily recognizable for what they are ·5.י A further difficulty derives from the poetical diction of the Chaldean Oracles which tends to veil the essential meaning, hinted at, rather than expressed, in brief allusions and in obscure paraphrases. These texts.only follow in this respect the laws of their literary genre, in which the use of cryptic style was considered as obligatory3®. The saying of Heraclitus describing the oracular style of the God of Delphi who \"neither utters nor hides his meanings, but shows it by a sign\" applies likewise to the gods of the Chaldean Oracles. The description of the Oracles as mere riddles would, however, be inapt. For the deliberate opacity of these theological revelations must not blind us to their being founded in a definite system of thought, provided with a consistent terminology. Had the complete Collection come down to us, it would, assuredly, not have been unduly difficult to determine the real meaning of the text. If the task of its interpreter is often ungrateful, \" This is one of the major differences between the methods to be followed in extracting Chaldean quotations on the one hand and Orphic on the other from Neoplalonic texts. \" This peculiar diction (about which Excursus III may be compared) can serve in doubtful cases as a crilerium of the Chaldaean origin of a passage, especially in an abstract philosophical context which sets oil its particularities. Proclus often embellishes his prose with phrases drawn from the Chaldean Oracles, without ,·idicaling that they are quotations. His appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of 11>e Oracles is proved by his Hymns."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"CHAPTER II. 102 and if the problem he sets out to solve sometimes seems to partake 0( the nature of a jigsaw puzzle, the reason is to be sought in the fragmentary character of the tradition and in the necessity of keeping in check the constant temptation to adopt the Neoplatonic explanations. The particular conditions of the transmission of the Chaldean Oracles determine the methods to be used in extracting them from the texts in which they are embedded, as well as in interpreting them. This inves-tigation must rely in the first place on the direct quotations. The expln-nations of the Neoplatonists should be adopted only when supported by external or internal proof. Kroll was the first to apply himself consistently to the task of differentiating between the Chaldaean and the Platonic ideas ; in our analysis of the relevant texts, we shall have to appraise the extent of his success or of his failure. After having extracted the dis-persed fragments, the investigator should aim at a synthesis of the por-tions that are correlated ; and this should lead to a reconstruction of the entire system. In this research, \"binding\" and \"loosing\" should go hand in hand. Some suppositions will be made which temporarily will have to go without proof, the arguments in their favour belonging to a later stage of this investigation. As in all such attempts, only the complete reconstituted system can, by bearing the impress of truth, compel con-viction, and justify, at the same time, the various hypotheses necessitated by its reconstruction. \"II est impossible de ranger les pieces, a qui n'a une forme du total en sa teste\" (Montaigne). 2.

The characteristica of Hecate's statue give us likewise a clue to the meaning of other epithets applied to Hecate by the Chal· deans. Thus she is called \"possessor of lions\" either because one of her heads was provided with a lion's face, which was one of the charade-ristic insignia of her image, or because her statue was flanked with the figures of lions 1'4. We can also understand the significance of the pitcher affixed to the left hip of the statue,\"which does not give away its virginity \"5\"; it is the symbol of Proserpine the Virgin (Kipij), whom the principal figure of the image of the many-headed Hecate usually re-presented1'6; a fact which also accounts for Hecate being called in the Oracles \"Virgin of the Source\"״1 .

The latter, described by an other Oracle as the \"streams of Heimarmene\" will be studied at some length in the chapter dealing with Chaldaean demonologyl:l3. Zoe, Psyche, Physis (also called : Ananke) and Heimarmene are four manifestations of the Chaldaean Hecate 130. The first produces the pure life of the blessed immortals, the second ensouls the worlds, the third rules by the law of necessity over the spheres, the fourth, mistress of the demons, dominates the terrestrial zone. The reason for the diversity of the qualities attributed to this goddess is to be sought in the Chaldsan system of the universe. The diverse manifestations of Hecate-Psyche, regarded as the power that ensouls all the worlds, correspond to the diife-rence of these worlds. In the region of the stars, known as the \"ethereal world\", the action of \"ensouling\" produces regular motion, which in the absence of a contrary force bears the character of pure necessity and is accordingly a manifestation of Nature. Beneath the moon lies the \"hylic world\", where Spirit is opposed to Matter; there the demonic satellites of the latter are active, dominated by Hecate, who has \"ensoul-ed\" them. In the noetic region the soul is sublimated and transmuted into the pure principle of Life, by virtue of whose \"Strength\" she fills even the \"highest of all the worlds\".

Proclus' differentiating between several lime-gods is due to his assigning different properties of llie Chaldeean Chronos-Aion 10 the successive stages (see nole 66) of the procession of the divine entities.

These predicates correspond 10 the expressions '׳ever-moving course\" and \"without beginning and end\" (περιφορά αεικίνητος, άναρχος χαί ατελεύτητο«) ciled by Dam. II, 45. 9 f. The verb ύμνηται employed by him does nol make il clear whether Chaldean or other hymnic predicates are referred to; cf. ARISTOT. , de uulo, II, 1 and SINPLICIOS, ad. loc., p. 367, 91 (quoted by C.

The supposition that the Oracles on Aion quoted by Porphyry and Proclus and 'he Hymn in honour of Chronos paraphrased by Ihe Jailer refer 10 the same divinity may be proved indirectly by the fact lhal a conlamination of the two themes figuring 10 the Oracles of both groups is to be found in the ninlh hymn of Synesius, v. 65 s.

There are however, several possible explanations for this divergency : a) Proclus's knowledge of the Chaldaean Chronos derives from the work of Julian the Theurgist, entitled On the Zones (viz. the starry spheres)1r'5, which appears to have been in prose and to have contained astrophysical disquisitions150. This subject-matter gave the author the latitude to apply to the ineffable god a designation which describes him only indirectly, by his most characteristic quality, and Proclus may have imitated him in this respect. For the rest, Proclus, describing another Chaldaean magical rite, calls this god by a somewhat different periphrastic name \"the Ruler of Time\" (Χρονο^ρχηί)'5י. b) Dogmatic considerations prevented Proclus from designating as Aion the Chaldaean god of Time, whose attributes are inconsistent with those of Aion as described by Plato (who conceives this entity as \"eter-nally motionless\" and \"neither old nor young\"158). In order to do away with this discrepancy, Proclus endowed with these attributes Time (χρόνοι), defined by Plato as the moving image of Eternity ; thus the super-celestial god of the Theurgists was reduced to the state of an intramundane numen 15'. This solution was fraught with difficulties, of which later Cf. note 150. Kroll in P. W., s. v. Julianoe No. 9, p. 15 proposes 10 emend έι ׳ έ£&όμρ τών ζώνων; lie supposes that each book of the work treated a different zone.

The view that the utterance of the divine word coincides with its execution is not peculiar 10 the Bible, as Kroll 46, 9 seems to think.

The cooperation of these entities effects the division of the world into triads 168. This division fleets immediately only the intelligible world, for it is due to an act of the Paternal Intellect, and the \"Father is everything, but noetically\" 1ββ. The second fragment describing the functions of this Triad and the relationship obtaining between it and its creator reads : ״From these two yonder flows the bond of the first Triad, which is not the first, but the (bond) whose noetic (essence) is measured\" 170. This Triad is called here in obscure terms \"the first Triad which is not the first\" for the reason that the Paternal Monad which \"rules\" it, like-wise constitutes in its active aspect a trinity; thus the Triad with which the Oracle is concerned is in a sense the second of its kind. It differs from the triple aspect of the Paternal Monad in so far as its noetic essence \"is measured\". Consequently the Paternal Monad (the \"First Triad\") is regarded as an unmeasurable unity; this conclusion is confirmed by two Oracular fragments which mention the indivisibility of the Primal Being171. According to the Neoplatonic commentators, the \"two\", from whom the \"bond\" of the measurable Triad \"flows\", are a monad See notes Itך andך ft.

Accordingly, the action of \"measuring and delimiting the All\" attributed to the Chaldaean Triad is identical with the forming of the amorphous \"world-bodies\" into the \"many-shaped Cos-mos\". Before going on with our account of this Triad, we must inquire into the relationship obtaining between the general and the particular Ideas.

For this reason, the demiurgical Intellect is known as the \"doubly transcendent\", in contradistinction from the First Intellect designated as the \"singly transcendent\" IM. His duality is also expressed by the epic attribute \"equipoised\" (t. e. here, equal as to both sides or direc-tions).

In one fragment they are called the \"Principles\" (αρχαί), \"who by thinking the works thought by the Father envelop them with visible works and bodies\"190. The expression \"the works thought by the Father\" signifies the primordial noetic Forms of the visible world 191.

As further examples show the Chaldeean Oracles sometimes employ the plural to indicate the parts of one primal substance 194. At this point, we may take up again the problem of the \"measuring\" Triad, into the nature of which the texts referring to the functions of the First and Second Intellect have given us some insight. This Triad is said to have originated through a division of the All into trinities, and to \"measure\" and \"delimit\" the AH. On the other hand, it is by it that \"the noetic essence is measured\". The reason for these various statements must be sought in the relationship between the First and the Second Intellect, the tatter of whom is but the actualization of the thoughts of the former. He springs from him, and is sustained (\"suckled\") and ruled by him. If we consider the action exercised by the First Intellect on the intelligible world, we are justified in saying that his thoughts are the measures of this world. However, in order to exercise a similar action upon the sensible world, he must \"commit\" the realization of his thoughts to the Second Intellect. Thus, it is the latter who \"measures\" and fash-ions the AH, for which the primordial Idea serves him as a prototype. It is, accordingly, probable that he is referred to in the following isolated verse : \"In the Womb of this Triad everything is sown\" 195. According to D;1m. II 20C. 11 (Kroll 3g), the class of the άφομοιαττιχοί &εοι (who were identified will! the Chaldieaii άρχαί; sec Dam. II aoo, 19 f.) were called in the Oracles χρηνήιο! άρχή.

This explanation accounts for the tradition of the Neoplatonists as to noetic Chaldean Ennead. We must, however, bear in mind that the interpretations of this teaching current in the school of Proclus carry no weight, as they are based upon the theories of Iamblichus 1·6. The <<Chalda>an Ennead\" consists, as the cited verses of the Oracles make probable : a) of the Paternal Monad, which constitutes in its active aspect the Supreme Triad; b) of the triadic primordial Ideas, which immediately proceed from it; c) of the triadic particular Ideas, which spring from these197. We must admit that the extant fragments do not always differentiate between the Triad of the First and that of the Second Intellect; but this fluctuation must be imputed to the fact that the Second Intellect possesses only with respect to the sensible world an existence independent of the First, from Whom he is not separated in the noetic region, and Who contains him. 7. The Creation of the World.—The speculations of the Chaldeeans regarding the relationship between the First and the Second Intellect are bound-up with their teaching concerning the creation of the world. The fundamental conceptions of their cosmogony are set out in the prin-cipal Oracle (quoted in the foregoing section) which deals with the origin, the mutual relationship and the action of the Ideas. According to this text, the Second Intellect, known as the \"Artisan\", fashioned the world in the likeness of the \"imperishable form\" set before him by the Paternal Intellect. Matter was created before the world by the \"Father\", whose Intellect had taken this \"resolve\"; for this reason, matter is described as \"begotten of the Father\" 18״. ®!ριίχετιι xai βΐ; ό Q-tloi άριθμός έν τή τάξει ταύτη προελ))λυθεν, ώ> χαί αύτόί 0 ΧαλδαΓο; έν τοιβ λογίοκ- «ΊήσΒε γάρ έν τριάδος κόλπου έσπαρται άπαντα».

The following Oracle bears on this doctrine : \"From here (the \"Source of the Sources\", i. e. the First Intellect) springs in abundance the generation of manifold Matter\" 200. Thus, the creation of the visible world was conceived as an imitation of a spiritual prototype. The demiurgical Second Intellect used as his instruments the Forms (Ideas) contained in him. These are said in the principal Oracle about the world-shaping Ideas to \"break upon the bodies of the world\". The underlying conception is that these Ideas by virtue of their noetic fire exercise upon the Primal Matter of the world an action similar to that of the smith who melts iron in fire and moulds it with a hammer. For this reason, they are called in another Oracle \"implacable Thunderbolts\"—an obvious allusion to the emblem of Zeus interpreted πατρoyevrjs έσΐι (eonliiiued note 903).

Compare « ^ηγνύμεναι χόσμον •σερί σώμασι» (note 177··יי י °) wit 11 « άμείλιχτοί τε χεραυνοί » (note 909, v. 1) and « αμείλικτου -πτυρόί»(η01β 960). Tlie \" lightnings״ are the particular Ideas which spring from the First Intellect who is their \" primal source\" and which are \"flashing in divisions\": see n. 178 and 177 (ad v. 11). Cf. also PROCL., Tim. I 119,9 δημιουργία; γάρ σύμβολον ό κεραυνό;; seech, νιι η. 109. The Oracles also name then! εύλντα φέγγη (see 11. 966) and ύιτέρ τόν ΰύρανόν φώτα (PROCL., Rp. 11 155, 6 f.). The attribute αμείλικτο; signifies that the Ideas are characterised as αμείλικτοι δεσμοί (Hesiod. Theog. 658), which \"bind matter in forms\"; cf. Theot. 97, 11 «τύποισι έδησα;», quoted 11. 186.

The whole mass of matter subsisting in the world was called by them \"Body1' or \"World-Body\"204. The element of fire is charged with the fashioning of this world-stuff · \"For there was another mass of Fire, which worked all this by itself · that the World-Body should be perfected, that the World should bec3me visible and not seem membrane-like\" 205. This \"other\" Fire, which is distinguished expressly from the noetic fire, fashions the visible world ; which, without its action would, accord-ing to the Oracle, \"seem membrane-like\". The meaning of this las! attribute may be elucidated once more with the help of the Platonic Timaevs according to which the universe \"being bodily must be visible and tan-gible, and without fire nothing visible can come to be\" 206. The concord-ance of the two passages shows that the Oracular fragment is a mere para-phrase of the Platonic text207. 8.

The term \"fiery poles\" has more than one meaning; in this passage it iR applied to the four cardinal points localized in the sphere of the fue(j stars219. Thus, the Pneuma mentioned in the Oracle is differentiated by the indication of its noetic place from the \"terrestrial jmeumata\\ iden-tical with the demons214. The term \"Pneuma\" is used in the doxo-logy of the angels of the Theosophy as a designation of the Cosmic Soul215. Other fragments describe it as the envelope of the individual souls which descend into the human body216. As the \"ensouling\" of man and that of the world are conceived in the Chaldaean doctrine as analogous processes, we may assume that this Pneuma was also the en-velope of the portions of the Cosmic Soul, which fill up the hollows of the Cosmic Body and constitute its Wombs. The sensible World, ensouled by these portions of the Cosmic Soul, and endowed by the \"Thunder-bolts\" of the Ideas with Reason, receives from Pneuma the breath of life. Thus, if we consider the four classes of entities generated by the First Intellect, namely, the \"Thunderbolts\", the \"Wombs\", the \"girdling Fire\", the \"Pneuma\", all of which collaborate in perfecting the sensible world, we find that the first may be identified with the Forms, and the three others with diverse aspects of the Cosmic Soul217.

This brief description of the creation of the firmaments conforms to the basic conceptions of Hellenistic cosmophysics. According to these, the fixed stars are attached to their sphere (\"heaven\") 222, the circular motion of which is the cause of their revolutions223; the planets, on the other hand, are endowed with a double movement (called \"disorder\"), parti-cipating both in the revolutions of their spheres and in those of their epicycles. The only distinctive feature of the sole preserved prose quo-tation deriving from the writings of the second of the founders of Theurgy is the pronounced anthropomorphism characterizing the account of the demiurge's actions; this trait—also found in the corresponding passages of the Oracles—may be set down to the influence of the parallel descrip-tion figuring in Plato's Timaeus 224. The following fragment of the Oracles also refers to the creation of heaven : \"It is true that it is an image of the Intellect, but something corporeal is inherent in the product\" 2'25.

These passages seem to warrant the following reconstruction of the Chaldean doctrine : the proportion of Reason to Matter is not the same in all the regions of the Universe; it depends on the distance of a gjVen zone from the celestial place of origin. The noetic world is immaterial-it is pure Intellect. In the celestial vault (viz. the sphere of the fiXe(j stars)827, which adjoins the noetic Empyrean, the ideal element predo minates, but there is an admixture of \"something corporeal\". Because of this, the ray of the Ideas is said to be \"dimmed\", when penetrating into the world of the spheres 228. The material element is preponderant in the sublunar region, which is therefore called in the Oracles \"dark-glowing\" or \"light-hating\"229; the \"Thunderbolts\" of the Ideas are said to \"break themselves\" on its resistance230. As we shall see later on, the Chaldacans—in consistent application of the principle that ideality decreases proportionately to the distance from the noetic place of origin—conceive Hades as Primal Matter, touched by no ray of the supercelestial Fire231. 10. Eros.—The powers that preserve the world, as well as those that create it, have their place in the Chaldean scheme : they are supposed to be the guarantors of the harmonic existence of the Universe. Eros is one of the principal entities appertaining to this class; he is referred to in the following fragment of the Oracles. \"For the Paternal Self-begotten Intellect, thinking (of) works, sowed into all (works) the bond of Eros, potent through fire; so that the All should continue to love for a limitless time, and that the weavings of the Father's noetic Light should not collapse.

Thus Eros, who is interfused with all the Ideas (the thoughts of the me Intellect), causes the continuance of the movement of the cosmic b dies by instilling into them a common desire that the existing order f the Universes should be maintained. Another fragment, probably extracted from the same Oracle, treats of the origin of Eros : (The portions of the world are held together) \"by the bond of admi-!·able Eros, who first leapt forth out of the Intellect, wrapping his binding fire in the fire (of the Intellect), that he might mix the mixing-bowls of the Sources, presenting the flower of his Fire\" 253.

This superadded element endows them with the power of connecting the portions of the world subject to their action. The description of this mixture is that of a real happening. The \"Sources\", in the mixing-bowls of which Eros \"mixes\" his fire, are the Ideas which spring forth from the \"Primeval Source\", that is to say, from the Paternal Intellect236. Accordingly they are endowed from the outset with Eros' faculties, and are conse-quently capable of holding the world together237. Thus, the second fragment treating of Eros contains a quasi-mythical account of the origin and action of the Ideas s3e. The human soul, also, contains an admixture of the \"chaste Eros, the Binder of all things and their sublime guide\", as he is called in an Oracle treating of the composition of the soul's noetic substance23'.

The \"Connectives\" (συνεχεΤί) spring forth, ·Ί do all noetic entities, from the Supreme God, the \"Father\", Who does not exercise a direct action on the lower orders of the hierarchy, and is, for this reason, described as the \"First Connective, who himself subsists whollv outside\" 20,.׳ The function of \"connecting\" is entrusted by him to his Power from whom the \"Source\" of all Life (t. e. the Cosmic Soul) and of all divine thoughts (i. e. the Ideas) flows forth. The Supreme Transcendent Principle is, consequently, also called the \"Connective\" of all Sources\" (that is, the Ideas), or the \"Womb that holds all things together\"241; the latter expression alluding to his containing the pri-inordial Feminine Principle. This Womb causes the \" nourishing strength of potent Fire to flow through the agency of the Connectives\" into the Cosmic Soul 242. The latter entity acquires through this admixture the power of \"connecting\", and proceeds to transmit it, as well as her own qualities, to the orders subjacent to her. Thus \"Life\" cooperates in maintaining cosmic harmony.

This 8crulin presupposes an examination of the other world-preserving potency, named in the Oracles. Unfortunately, the direct quotations bearin on this subject have come down to us in a particularly fragmentary state moreover, the original meaning of these texts was distorted by the Neo' platonists, who sought to identify the beings named in the Oracular pas sages in question with the entities of their own ontological hierarchy In consequence, the task of discovering the true opinions of the Chal-deans entails rather laborious investigations. In the following analysis we shall chiefly rely upon the passages expressly stated to be quotations from the Oracles. The explanations of the Neoplatonists will not be held to carry weight, unless they can be proved to reproduce a genuine Chaldean tradition. The text of the Oracles and the interpretation of the Neoplatonists seem to lend colour to the view that the potencies that \"connect\" con-stitute a particular class of entities. But, the three passages treating of Eros the \"Binder\", and the fact that this attribute is also applied to the Supreme Being, or to the hypostasis closest to him, prove that this term designates in the Oracles a specific mode of action of the Ideas. This was personified owing to the general tendency of the Chaldeans to express in mythical terms the dynamic character of the noetic subs-tances. As we have seen, Eros is hypostatized for similar reasons; in reality,, he is only a mode of the First Intellect by whom he is secreted, but not endowed with separate existence in the proper sense of the term : for he may act only when \"wrapt\" in Intellect, from whom he springs213· We have found that Eros is interfused with all the noetic orders and brings about their cooperation in the task of holding the world together. The term \"Connectives\" seems to apply to a similar power appertaining to the active aspect of the Ideas. This view is corroborated by the fact that these Ideas are designated in an Oracle (which has been already quoted) י י Connectives of the AH \"244. When this function is especially emphasized, the name of this faculty is substituted for that of the entity. As this power pervades the whole Cosmos, the term in question is applied to diverse J״ See nole •13.1. — Sec 11. 173"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"131 THE CIIALD-EAN SYSTEM. subsisting in different parts of the worlds; thus, in the extant entities1 ^ ^ §un 245 an(j t0 80me undefined potencies of the Hylic Worldί,β (whose function will be dealt with later).

In the course of the present chapter, we shall gain some insight into the prin-ciples followed by the Chaldeans in the systematization of this doctrine. The task of \"connecting\", incumbent upon the Ideas, is practically identical with that of watching over the permanence of the intramundane order. One passage of the Oracles assigns to the \"Lightnings\" of the Ideas the function of \"watchers\", but it does not define the precise nature of this activity s\". Cf.

Accordingly ^ lynges are, essentially, magical names sent forth by the Supreme Fath into the spheres. An Oracle, which shall be examined in detail late!· on3M, may help us to explain this curious conception. According to this text, the Paternal Intellect has sown the magic words over the whole world, so that the human soul should succeed with their aid in appre-!lending the noetic beings. Thus, the magical names used by the theur-gists, in order to communicate with the supramundane powers, are iden-tical with the thoughts of the Supreme Transcendent Being. It is he who sends them forth so that they should be conjured by the adepts; for he intends them to serve as mediators between the theurgists and him-self. This conception accounts for the twofold definition of the lynges as the \"be3triders\" of the spheres and as the transmittors of messages. As the lynges are regarded as localized in the spheres, the conjuration of their \"ineffable name\" by the theurgist presupposes his knowing to which particular sphere they de3cend when invoked.

Leaving out of account this philosopher's C!ld'tions and misconceptions we find that in this hymn the Chaldeans 8 resent Aion as a divinity which rules the Empyrean World and con-«־ it in a circle; measuring its revolutions, as well as those of the fixed stars9 the sun and the \"third\" world180. These views conform to the description of Aions' movement figuring in the Oracle of the Theosophy. According to this text, there is to be found in the Empyrean \"a long path winding spiral-wise\", along which the \"fiery God\" wends his eternal way, \"mingling aeon with aeon\" 281. We may, accordingly, infer that the god Aion is identical with the noetic planet which, according to the Oracle on the \"three Rulers\" already known to 11s, is engaged in the ״first, holv course\" 282. Aion is, thus, conceived both as the chief of the \"Rulers\" and as the regulator of the movements of the two others; the Sec n. 15a.

The verb employed in this verse implies an astral being28/1. Hecate is named in-stead of the moon, her intramundane abode285. The verse must, accord-ingly, be understood as identifying the \"centre\" of the moon with the \"midmost\" of the three \"Fathers\", that is to say, with the Ruler of the sun. The term \"centre\" is used here (as in other fragments of the Ora-cles) with reference to the central position of the sun in the system of the planets 286. The mention of Hecate appears to indicate the nature of the third \"Ruler\".

This interpretation was inaugurated hy Porphyry (see Excursus II, n. 95) and elaborated by Iamblichus (CR. PROCL., Tim., I 308, 99 f.). As a consequence of this exegesis, the χοσμαγοί, the Chaldean synonym of Ihese τρεΓβ π ατέ ρε! (see η. 371). were also taken to refer to this \"intellective\" triad.

We may suppose that they were the mediators, with whose help the Theurgist communicated in the course of his invocation with the three \"Rulers of the mysteries\". A) The analysis of the Oracles treating of the world-preserving entities shows us that, according to the Chaldaeans, these were divided into different categories, which were designated by names descriptive of their various functions. We have encountered the following designations : \"Connectives\", \"Upholders\" :,3fi, \"Watching Lightnings\", \"Rulers\" (and the equivalents of this last term :i:)7). AH these entities belong to the class of the Ideas; and, in the last resort, their various names designate the diverse activities of the same order of being. Thus, the potencies which fashioned the world are identical with those which watch over the harmony of its existence. As all of them belong to one class, their functions are not clearly delimited; a circumstance which renders the relevant fragments of the Oracles particulary difficult to understand. At least some measure of justification must be allowed to the Neoplatonists, who used certain Chaldaean names of the world-preserving powers as attributes of their own divine hierarchy:,:w. Our enquiry into the nature of the world-preserving entities began with an examination of Chaldaean cosmology; and this was followed up by a discussion of theurgy in the proper sense of the word.

This connection is a consequence of the basic principle of '^system, which represents the entities that accomplish the theurgical eration as identical with those that rule the Universe; the selfsame °ower is drawn upon in the practice of magic and in the organization of the Cosmos. Believing this, the Chaldaeans could not but regard a full understanding of the forces of the Universe as a necessary preliminary to theurgy, which aims at dominating those forces. Accordingly, their exposition of the system of the Cosmos has a preeminently practical object, manifested in the choice of the various themes and in the way in which these are dealt with. There are many indications which show that the Chaldaeans are parti-cularly interested in the governance and the cohesion of the world This preoccupation is not due to love of knowledge for its own sake, but to the exigencies of magical world-orientation. In the Chaldaean system, the basic magical belief in the sympathy of all the powers of the world is bound up with the conception of a rational organization of the Cosmos, headed by a Supreme Intellect, who is both the originator of all the intelligences existing in the world and the goal of the human soul which aspires to par-ticipate in the eternal harmony. In order to ascend towards the First Prin-ciple, it is necessary to have the aid of the powers charged by the Supreme Being with the harmonious governance of the various parts of the Universe. This aid may be secured only through knowledge of the nature and the activity of these powers; a branch of science which is, accordingly, indispensable to the Chaldaean who wishes to perform the theurgical act. 1 'י .

The noetic powers subsisting in the orders of the cosmical hie-rarchy represent the energy which is at work in the Universe, and render thereby manifest the action of the Supreme Principle. At the same time, these powers are endowed with individual faculties and function as the executors of the Sup reme decree.

We have already treated at some length of the nature of Aion, the Supreme God. He reveals, without any intermediary, the inconceivable First Being; and is, for this reason, the Chaldaean God par excellence;1:|t| As he only \"manifests himself\" when impelled to do so by a decision of the Supreme Father, the Oracles exhort the pious to address their prayers to the \"Supreme King of all the blessed gods\", Whose Intellect and Will rule over all the other divine entities :t׳,w. The Chaldaean pantheon seems to be organized as a patriarchal hierarchy; headed by the Supreme God, its Creator and Overlord, called the \"Ruler\" and the \"Father of the blessed immortals\" ;1/l1. Besides the transmundane gods (the \"father\", Aion, Hecate), the Chaldeans recognize a second class of divine beings : the gods of the planets. In the Oracle on Aion transmitted in the Theosophy, Apollo affirms that \"no god encounters\" Aion in his course through the noetic sphere, neither the stars, nor the moon, \"nor I myself, who hold together with my rays and spread out in the whirl of the ether\" 3',2. This passage proves that the planets are regarded by the Chaldaeans as gods. They seem to be given the usual Greek names; for Apollo identifies himself with the sun 3\"3, and Ares and Titania figure in one or the other Chaldaean Oracles preserved by Porphyry as appellations of planets 3',י׳ . Moreover, we have seen that the designation of the sun as \"Truth\", of Mercury as \"Understanding\" or \"Wisdom\" and of the moon as \"Virtue\" may be explained as a metonymic way of naming the Greek planetary gods See p. 99 f. \"· Sec ch. i, n. 67 (v. 1 and 5).

The Chalda:an hierarchy of supercelestial entities assigns to the angels a rank next to that of the gods, and divides them, as we learn from the hymn of the Theosophy :צ6ו, into three groups : (a) the \"holy Rulers\" who constantly surround the Supreme Being; (6) the ministering angels who live \"far\" from Him, scattered all over the ethereal world, func-tioning as the transmittors of the messages of the Paternal Intellect : according to another Oracle of the Theosophy, they \"hasten\", at the command of the \"Father\", to the help of the afflicted pious :Mi:l.

The origi-nal bearers of the title \"ferrymen\" (ίιαπόρθμιοι) applied to the lynges, are Plato's good daemons who, like the ministering angels of the Theur-gists, \"interpret between gods and men, conveying and taking across to the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the commands and replies of the gods\" and who also mediate \"all prophecies and magi-cal incantations\" (Plato Conviv. 202 e). These good daemons are identified by the later Pythagoreans and Platonists with (Jewish and Persian) angelsThis assimilation is also one of the bases of Chal-da!an angelology. Their common sources account for the similarity between the Chaldeean doctrine of the lynges and the angelology of Philo, who regards the angels as pure souls, powers or ideas of God, assimilates demons and heroes; il is however certain that this classification originated wilh lhe later Neoplatonists ; see ch. v, n. 8. For the Platonists distinguish between good and evil demons, while the Chaldaeans use the term exclusively in malam partem; see ch. v, n. 14. The souls of the Theurgists who descend again upon the earth were considered by the Neoplatonists as belonging to the class of heroes; see ch. in, n. 19/1. Proclus, when treating of angelology, likewise invokes the authority of the Chal-deans; cf. Rp., II, 355, 20 άγγελοι...

As we have shown, the lynges are identical with the \"ineffable magi-cal names\" disseminated by the Paternal Intellect throughout the world so that they should help the human souls to accomplish the theurgical \"elevation\" (of which more later on). The personification of these names is due to the conceptions of magical science. The Hellenistic magicians regard the \"ineffable names\" with which they invoke the gods as hypostases of the divinities to whom they are applied and whose will they carry out:16״. Because of the latter function, the \"names\" could fitly be included by the Chaldaeans in the group of the ministering angels. The ministering angels are apparently also designated by the expression \"beauteous ears\", with which, according to the hymn of the Theosophy, the Supreme Being hears all things 370. This peculiar appellation may be explained once again by a passage of Philo'71, who compares the angels with the \"eyes and ears of the King\" (Persian titles), who hear everything and report the afflictions of the creatures to the \"Father\", —a description which again alludes to the disquisition on the g'ood daemons in Plato's Banquet. It concords, almost word for word, with the passage of the Oracle of the Theosophy dealing with the activities of the ministering angels.

As the world is ruled by noetic entities, the ways of communicating with them are also conceived as noetic. For this reason, the Chaldeans regard the science treating of the cognition of the intelligible world as being of basic significance. This central theme of Chaldaean theosophy, referred to in numerous Oracles, was of particular interest to the Neoplatonists, to whom we owe the preservation of several of the relevant texts. Some of these are of capital importance, as they enable us to form a sufficiently distinctive idea of the main characteristics of this doctrine, and of its relation to theurgy in the proper sen3e of the word. The most instructive of the texts of this group is a lengthy Chaldean Oracle quoted by Damascius from the monograph of Iamblichus on Chaldean Theology, that fundamental work of Neoplatonic oracular exegesis. This Oracle is couched in the obscure symbolic language characteristic of the Chaldaean Oracles; every word has a terminological significance, which may be discovered by a rigourous interpretation of the text and by a comparison with parallel verses : \"There is a certain noetic being (τι νοητόν) which thou must think with the flower of thought. For, shouldst thou incline thine intellect to It, and think It as if thinking something, thou shalt not think It. For It (the noetic being) is the Power of circumsplendent Strength, flashing with noetic divisions. In good sooth, one should not think that noetic being with vehemence, but with the subtle flame of subtle intellect, that measures all things—except that noetic being. Thou shouldst not think II in a forthright manner, but keeping the pure eye of the soul turned away, thou shouldst stretch out the vacant intellect towards the noetic being, in order to learn to know It; for It subsists beyond the (human) intellect\" ••73.

Two types of thought are contrasted in the Oracle : one seeks to attain to the noetic \"It\" (τ<), the other is turned to an object which is fixedly and actively regarded by the human intellect. Thought of the second type cannot bring about the cognition of the object of thought spoken of in the Oracle; for that is not a definable object. It \"subsists beyond the (human) intellect\", i.e., beyond the scope of this intellect's conceptio-nal thinking; and cannot be \"measured\" by it; for it is One, Infinite and \"Indivisible\" ;l7r\\ For this reason, he who would recognize it is 3 ώί τι νοών, ού κείνο νοήσει; · έστι γάρ άλκή! 4 άμφιφαούί δύναμι: νοεραι'ί στράπτονσα τομαΐσιν. 5 Ού ιή χρή σφοδρότητι νοεϊν το νοητόν έκεΐνο, 6 ϊλλί νόου ταναού ταναή φλογΐ πάντα μετρούση ך πλήν τό νοητόν έκεΐνο • χρεώ δή τούτο νοήσαι 8 [)1׳ γάρ έττεγκλινη: σόν ινϋν, κάκιϊνο νοήσεΐί] ι) ούκ άτενώί, άλλ' άγνύν άπόστροφον Λμμα φέροντα ι ο σήί ψυχηί τεϊναι κενεόν νούν έί τό νοητόν, 1 ι ύφρα μάθη: τό νοητόν, έπει νόου έξω υπάρχει».

Consequently, the apposition \"flashing with noetic divisions\" signifies the totality of the ideas that have issued forth from the First Intellect:,7H. The identity of the noetic essence with the thoughts of the Supreme Intellect is clearly stated in another Oracle (in which this view is opposed to other theories, of which more later on) : \"The (divine) Intellect does not subsist far from the noetic (essence), and the noetic (essence) does not subsist apart from the (divine) Intellect\" :m.

To ex-press their reception of this essence the Oracles employ the image of the \"plucking\" of the \"fiery\" (viz. noetic) flowers or fruits. This expression is used in the Oracles in the case of Aion and the Forms It is note-worthy that it also figures in another Oracle treating of the cognition of the Ideas. According to this passage, the souls of those, \"who think the works of the Father\" (viz. the Ideas), \"pluck the soul-nourishing flower of the fiery fruits\" 381. The \"flower of the intellect\" with which the highest noetic being must he cognized is, as we have seen, offshoot of that which is to be cognized. This homogeneity appears to be consequent upon the conception that a portion of the Paternal Intellect is commingled with the human soul, endowing it with the faculties of this Intellect from whom it descends 31״, The intellectual substance subsisting in the human soul cognizes the pri-mordial noetic substance because of its organic affinity with it. The co-gnition of the noetic being is an apprehension of like by like, or, more accurately, of the whole by one of its parts 383. The particular organ, which apprehends the noetic beings is variously designated in the Oracles. \"Subtle flame of the subtle intellect\" is an expression synonymous with \"flower of the fire\", which derives from a similar image ; the Greek word for flower (άνθο;) applying also to the finest qualities of a substance 38'1.

Finallyי \"eye of the soul\" is a well-known and widely used simile coined by Plato 380 with a view to expressing the ability of the human intellect to contemplate the ideas. Besides these figurative expressions applied to the organ of intellectual vision, we encounter in the Oracles a series of kindred hyperbolic desi-jrnations. These may be likewise found in the writings of the Platonists, from which they were taken over by the Chaldaeans. However, the latter differ from the former by the occurence of bolder flights of mystical fancy. The licence of poetic diction permitted them to express with less restraint the excentricity of their spiritual mood. One Oracle describes the organ of thought as a \"fiery intellect\" ;1H7, because the thinking portion of the human soul derives from the primor-dial noetic Fire. Another Oracle enjoins : \"Let the immortal depth of the soul be opened, strongly spread out all the eyes upwards\" :WH. The expression \"immortal depth of the soul\" is synonymous with the \"eye of the soul\" closed, according to the teachings of the Platonists, when human Psyche succumbs to bodily temptations 389. The term \"Depth\" is applied in the Oracles to noetic space 390 ; in our passage it figures as Iliad, IX, a 1 3 αύτάρ έ,τίί urupis ανθοί άνέπτατο, according to the variant preferred hy Aristarchus; cf.

The \"spreading out'1 of this eye \"upwards\" corresponds to the \"stretching out\" towards the noetic goal enjoined by the principal Oracle of this group. In another fragment, the glances of this \"eye of the soul\" are described as \"in_ flexible rays\" 393. The attribute designates the immediate character of this pure vision \"upwards\" ; it marks it difference from the cognition of the sensible objects towards which the human intellect \"inclines\"39' in oblique fashion. Other accounts of the supreme vision are focussed upon a different set of images; they do not describe the apperception of the spiritual organ of vision, but the soul's ascent towards the noetic goal. Equivalents of these spatial representations are known from the writings of Plato (es-pecially from the seventh and eighth book of the Republic, the Phaedrus and Phaedo) which enable us to explain the variations of Chaldeean ima-gery. The ascent to pure vision is seen in contrast with the lowly con-dition of the soul ensnared in the body and aspiring upwards to its place of origin, a conception also derived from Plato.

The reason for the twofold designation ״f this noetic substance is to be sought in the doctrine of the First Paternal Intellect who causes the ideas \"to flash in divisions\". It is these ideas who are the \"rays of the Father\". The soul ascending to the noetic goal is represented in the Oracles as a charioteer; an image obviously related to the myth in Plato's Phaedrus : ״Pull the reins of the Fire with a wholly unadulterated soul\" 39 \\ The term \"Fire\" is applied in this passage as in so many others to the noetic substance of the human intellect that subsists in the soul; in the course of the ascent it spreads, as it were, its wings and serves as the soul's vehicle 398. Accordingly, the power to elevate inherent in the human intellect is described in another Oracle as the \"Fire's wing\" 39(1.

Thus, the terms \"approach\" and \"touch'י are in fact equivalent to \"reaching out\" and \"stretching out\". These descriptions of the cognition of the noetic objects in the terms of the sensible world seem at first to be figurative accounts of purely spiritual experiences. This view appears to be confirmed by the signi-ficance which the Neoplatonists attach to the Chaldeean images : thev use them to figure the mystic act of spiritual self-perfection 8׳,״. How-ever, a closer examination of the quoted fragments and the comparison of these with another group of Oracles show that these images drawn from the external world reflect the internal experiences called forth bv the theurgical act. In the last verse we have quoted there is for the first time a clear men-tion of the particular noetic order, which brings about the vision of the Ideas. This is effected by the god Aion who sends forth all the noetic light spread out over the world. According to a quoted fragment it is from this Chaldaean deity that the \"mortal will obtain light\". This light is identical with the highest object of thought, the cognition of which is described in the principle Oracle of this group; a conclusion which is warranted by the following Oracle : \"Those who think the works of the Father (i.e. the Ideas), ...repose in God (without the article, i.e. Aion), inhaling the mighty flames that descend from the Father\" 0\"י• Aion, the \"Father-begotten Light\", receives his Fire from the Supreme Being and transmits it to those \"who think\", so that they are filled with it.

Accordingly, the gnoseological expositions and the figurative descriptions that have been quoted bear on spiritual experiences called forth by definite cultual actions, with which they are correlated. For instance, the spatial sue-cession of the degrees of the soul's elevation marked in the mystery by theurgical rites was interpretated in the quoted Oracles as symbolizing the qualitative sequence of an immanently spiritual experience. The practical identity of the cognition of the noetic objects with the mystery of the elevation of the soul towards the divine light is also proved by the passivity characterizing the organ of thought while the act of cognition takes place. This act is described in the principle Oracle of this group as a \"stretching out\" of the \"eye of the soul\" towards the noetic goal accompanied by the intentional suspension of all discursive thinking. This account defines the purposive character of this spiritual act, but not the way in which the perception of the noetic object may be achieved. The Oracle which states that the soul \"will obtain light from God\" proves that the functions of the organ of thought in the course of the act of vision are of a receptive nature. A fuller account will be found in the Oracles treating of the mystery which are quoted in extenso in the following chapter. They describe this act as a union of the soul with the divine light which inclines towards it. The soul absorbs it, is \"en-ebriated\" by it and \"reposes\" in it. These and similar images show that the process of \"cognition\" was not regarded as an autonomous act of apprehension, but as the state of being filled with the divine light. The intellectual concepts express mystical experiences. Human reason ls transformed from an instrument of dialectical thinking, into the organ receiving the divine light, through which the noetic object is imparted to the purified soul.

Plato compared the illumination accompanying the vision of the Ideas with that experienced by the initiate at the culminating point of the mystery '1\"1. The Chaldaeans, on the other hand, used the image of philosophical vision in order to represent the illumination of their initiate. Their equivocal mode of expression gave the Neoplatonists the possibility to interpret the injunctions of the Oracles concerning ritual ceremonies as figurative expressions of spiritual experiences; they could thus identify the Chaldaean mystery of the ascent of the soul towards the divine light with the Plotinian intellectual process of self-perfection which is inde-pendent of all external action.

These are described by Psellus, who draws upon Proclus, in the following passage : \"The Chaldaean says that we cannot be borne upwards towards god, unless we strengthen the vehicle of the soul by material sacraments. For he believes that the soul is purified by stones, herbs and conjurations and consequently becomes more agile with a view to the ascension\"6.

The Chaldean modification of this doctrine was determined by their neral view of the nature and the destiny of the human soul. The fragments give us some insight into their beliefs relating to this pro-blem. The most important text bearing on the composition of the human soul reads : ״Having mingled the Spark of the Soul with two like-minded facul-ties, with Intellect and divine Will (the Father) added to them as a third chaste Eros, the Binder of all things and their sublime guide\" e. Consequently, the human soul is composed of a spark of the Cosmic Soul, mingled with portions of the \"Paternal Intellect\" and of \"Will\". Both faculties of the Supreme Being are called \"likeminded\", as each of them conforms in its actions to the other<J. To them Eros is addled 10 χαλούσιν. The Chaldean Oracles are designated as χρη7μοί by Porphyry and by Damascius; cf. Excursus I p. In a preceding passage, Hierocles cites another Chaldean expression without stating its origin; see n. 66. KROLL, 47 could not find an indubitably genuine Chaldean text containing the term όχημα. Psellus (see n. /1) is suspect, as Proclus whom he follows could have inserted the expression.

The origin, nature and destiny of the human soul are the particular theme of another Chaldean Oracle. A feature of its literary presen-tation merits special interest, namely the fact that it is delivered by the souls themselves. Proclus, followed by Psellus, reports that the Chaldeans used to conjure up souls2(1. We may, accordingly, infer that our Oracle contained the answer given by invoked souls to the question as to their existence before they entered the human body and after this event21. Two verses of this oracle are extant : ״The Father of men and gods put the Intellect into the Soul, but us into the sluggish body\" 22, The disembodied souls who pronounce these verses differentiate between themselves and the soul (in tho singular); the latter cannot but be the Cosmic Soul 2.י· This surmise is borne out by the fact that \" PROCL., Tim., ILL, 316, 9 (Knon, /16) : φησί χαί το λόγιον «ταΰτα •πατήρ έ νόησε, βροτο; Si oi ίψύχωτο». \" See ch. iv, η. 93, 9&, 96. \" This was one of the subjects regarding which the Theurgists needed meta-physical indoctrination.

Julian's source was probably Iamblichus' commentary on the Chaldean Oracles; see ch. 11, n. 6 and CUMONT, Etude» tyriennet, 105 f. Porphyry (and Proclus after him) hold that the souls descending into the bodies are accompanied by good demons who defend them, as they enter the lower aerial sphere, against the attack of the evil spirits dwelling there; see Excursus XI, 3. Julian replaces these demonic companions by solar rays, who assure the \"safe\" (άσφαλοϋί) descent of the soul into the human body. This substitution is due to the belief that the solar rays are guided by angels (cf. JULIAN, Orat., IV, 141 B, 4 יA A; Epitt. ad Athen., 275 B; PROCL., •aepi τή: ιερατική: τέχιηί, P. 150, 22 F. e · Bidez) and that sunlight drives away the evil spirits (see n. 161). The de-81gnation of the solar rays as vehicles of the soul is certainly not to be ascribed 10 the chald®ans who held lhat the όχημα consist of ethereal, solar, lunar and aerial (see n. 26).

The ascent of the soul.—No continuous account of the theurgical sacrament of immortality has come down to us, but the Neoplatonic texts contain numerous fragments which directly bear on it, as well as numerous allusions to it, and these enable us to form an approxi-mate idea of this magico-mystical initiation.

Through the utterance of these magical \"watchwords\" the theurgist gains mastery over the invoked cosmic powers, and aids his soul to be united to the \"ineffable beauty\" of the supercelestial world. The use made of these magical words during the theurgical ascent is described in another fragment of the Oracles : \"Having clad thyself with the all-armoured vigour of sounding light and having equipped Intellect and Soul with three-barbed Strength (thou must) cast in the mind the watchword of the manifold Universe and move towards the fiery rays not scatteredly, but collectedly\"™. \" The σύμβολα and the συνθήματα are identical with the voces mysticae (άρρητα όνόματα ; seech.i, η. 18A), as is proved by the synonymous use of the three terms by Proclus (Tim., I, 9 11, 1 ; quoled n. 55.

These considerations enable us to gain an approximate idea of the nature and of the origin of the substances \"Light\" and \"Strength\" with which the intellect and the soul of the initiate are to be clad or armoured. Moreover, the attributes applied to these substances contain helpful indications : \"Sounding Light\" alludes to the sound produced by the revolutions of the spheres03. Accordingly, the \"vigour\" of the \"soun-ding Light\" may be taken to signify the ether, in which the spheres revolve, and out of whose substance the \"raiments\" of the soul are made11.'׳ The nature of \"Strength\" can likewise be divined with the aid of its attribute.

This threefold substance with which the initiate is to be armed, seems to be identical with \"Strength bound together by God\" by means of which, according to another Oracle, equivalent may be completed, στιβαρηΒόν or σποράΒην can, properly speaking, only determine a subject which is in the plural, but the number of the two par-ticiples proves that the Oracle adressed a single person.

Ιερουργία is a current term which was applied to all religious acts, more parti-cularly to sacrifices. It is for this reason that Proclus speaks of the ιερά έργ* of the cults.

The principles of their theology of Light have been examined at length in the last chapter 103; a short recapitulation will suffice for our present purpose. The \"Father\", viz. the Primal Fire, is in His transcendence inaccessible to perception; He manifests Him-self to men by means of a second divinity, emanating from Him, that is the \"Father-begotten Light\", who as an epiphany of the Inconcei-vable is named the \"Self-manifesting\" God, or simply \"God\". Eter-nity is one of the attributes of this second god; for this reason, he is designated as \"Aion\". One of the functions incumbent upon him is that of transmitting his noetic light and his eternal movement to the sun, which rules and gives light to the planets. Thus, the fire of the sun derives from the god Aion. There is accordingly no incongruity in the fact that the Oracles identify, on the one hand, the mystic solar ray with God, and, on the other, regard it as descending \"from the Father\"!׳׳״. The same conception underlies, as we have already seen 10r> the two Oracle-verses : \"The mortal, who approaches the fire, will cf. KROLL, 54.

NORDEN, Vergilius Aetieis Buck, VI, p. 996 draws a parallel between the Chal-dean paean and that chanted by the blessed soul in Virgil's Elysium (Aeneid. VI, 657).

As we have already seen, this light is conducted down wards by the three \"Rulers of the initiation\" set over the noetic, ethe real and terrestrial worlds, whose action is called forth by the magical invocation of the theurgists. The doctrine of the stations of the primordial light proves that the lofty conceptions of the theurgists were far removed from heliolatry which characterizes many of the religious currents of the time. Aion himself, the mediator between the solar light and the Supreme God, was not the ultimate goal, towards which the Chaldaean theologians aspired. Their religious consciousness was centred in the Supreme 'Father'. It was He who received the desire of the soul for deliverance107 and \"resolved\" to manifest himself in the Light of Aion l(W, which He sent to the sun 1118; wherefrom it descended towards the aspirant. Aion and the sun functioned as mere executors of His will, \"to whose Nod everything is subservient\" IM. To Him alone the believers must address their prayers״״ ; an injunction which Proclus obeyed, when he composed the magnificent prose hymn, inspired by the description of the theurgical elevation given in the Oracles : \"Let us become fire, march through fire. We know the agile way of return : the Father leads us, unfolding the ways of the fire\" 11 For this reason, it is not possible to regard έχείνου in the verse «06 xev έχείνου άψάμενοί •avpos αιθέριου ΙαΙσειέ ris ήτορ» (quoted ch. 11, η. &0ך) as an attribute of -srop6>.

At this point, magical doctrine is transmuted into mysticism; the theurgical elevation takes on the cha-acter of a union of the human spirit with the transcendent world of the supreme Intelligence.

This explanation is confirmed by a more detailed interpretation the analogy already known to us 1ae, which Proclus' master Syrianu8 traced between the sacrifice offered up by Achilles at Patroclus' funeral pyre and the Chaldaean sacrament of immortality. Syrianus asserts that all the ritual acts performed by the Homeric Achilles at the funeral pyre \"imitate\" the Chaldean mystery, \"as thereby (by the ritual acts) Patroclus' soul is elevated to a life separated from the body. For this reason, Achilles standing before the funeral pyre is said (in the Home-ric narrative) to invoke the winds ... and to pour out the whole night σώματιxiji φύσεως χα! οίον άναπνειν αυτήν τποιοϋσαι άπό τών έν σώματι μόχθων... εύλυτοί είσιν. He correctly adds άπό τής σωματικής φύσεως to έζωσΊήρε», but gives a spiritual interpretation of άναπνεϊν (οίον; cf. PROCL., Rp., 1, 9 ,5ן Γ.) which refers to a real action. As to the nomen agentis άνάπνοε! (= οί άναπνέουσιν), a typical Chaldean neologism, see Excursus III, 1 b. Psellus tikes έξωσίήρες to be an attribute in the feminine gender; it applies in reality, as proved by ivi-πνοεβ, to the class of the ecstatics. εύλυτοί, \"mobile\" (sometimes used in the Oracles as an attribute of the Ideas; cf. ch. 11, n. 901, 266) signifies in this pas-sage that the purified soul is easily attracted by the ray of the sun; cf. ch. 11, n. 3g8 and Excursus IX, ad v. 11. The deliverance of the soul from the body is also referred to in the promise of another Oracle (quoted ch. 11, n. 395) that\"onlv those who hasten naked upwards, towards the heights\" attain the divine. Proclus often identifies the Chaldean mystery with the doctrine of PLATO s Phaedo as to the voluntary death of the true philosopher.

Accordingly, the Chal-dean mystery is to be regarded as the \"drama\" of the death of the body and of the ascension of the soul to eternal life. Our insufficient sources of information do not enable us to distinguish with precision between the various phases of this action, but the attested details give us a clear idea of the internal cohesion and the meaning of the sacra-mental mystery as a whole; which may be imagined to have taken by and large the following course : 5.

Th^' the initiate invokes with magic formulae the three \"Rulers\" of the mystf! rays, marches towards the streams of light which begin to shine before him and appear to extend indefinitely upwards, enters the cone Γ light, inhales its divine substance, and filled with it, has the impreg sion that the solar ray draws up his soul and unites him with the centre of cosmic harmony. If we take account of the fact that this symbolic representation was accompanied by magical operations, invocations, reci-tals and above all, by numerous luminous visions, we shall perhaps be able to realize the sensual effect produced by the theurgical ritual upon the excited imagination of the neophyte. The reader who has followed our foreoging investigation will be able to determine for himself the part played by pure hypothesis in our attempt to reconstitute the external course of the principal mystery l:ls. We may add that this reconstruction is borne out by the fact that the two main operations of the Chaldaean sacrament, the conjuration of the soul and its elevation, are very similar to the rites familiar from the common magical practices of the epoch. The external rites of the first act of the mystery, which must be repre-sented as analogous to those performed by the Homeric Achilles, recall the ceremonial of the necromancers m.

The mimic action whicb followed upon the soul's separation from the body probably resembled the action described in the άπαθαναησμόβ of the Parisian magical text.

Thus, the sacramental action of the first phase of the mystery consisted in a free variation upon a real magical rite, to the ceremonies of which the Chaldeans gave a spiritual interpretation. The second act, the \"elevation\" of the soul by means of a solar ray, is largely in accordance with the instructions given for the soul's ascen-sion heavenwards in the well-known description of the sacrament of immortality found in the great Paris magical papyrus (erroneously cal-led \"Mithrasliturgie\" by Dicterich) 1.\"י The soul of the magic adept \"י Achilles' sacrificial offerings : sheep, wine, oil and honey, are those current among the necromants; HOPFNEII, op. cit., II, 339· This concordance may be accounted for by the affinity existing between the rites of the sacrifices for the dead and those which are intended to induce the θ-εοί χθόνιοι to release the soul of lhe invoked person (ROHDE, Psyche, I, 14-17). '\" Achilles, too, invokes Patroclus' soul, for he believes lhat she is in the neigh-hourhood of lhe grave (ROHDE, Psyche, I, 1 7 f.; cf. TERTULLIAN, De anima, c. 56 and BIDEZ-CUMONT,Mages hell.,U, 388, 3). The Homeric expression ψυχήν χιχλή-σχων (SEC Η. 197) concords with necromantic terminology ; cf. e. g. AESCHYL., Pers., 690 f.

'    Our reconstitution is further corroborated by the fact that the sign( licance of the Chaldeean sacrament concords with that of other content porary mysteries. The action of the principal theurgical sacrament repre sents the destiny of the soul of the initiate after his bodily death and is accordingly parallel to the mystery of Isis described by ApuleiUg and to the sacrament of immortality of the above-mentioned Paris manu-script, in both of which the Sp£μα μνσίικον of death, union with God and rebirth is likewise enacted 1:1'J. The fact that these two mysteries are described in texts dating from the epoch in which the Chaldeean sacra-mental community was founded, is by no means an accident. A theo-logical system of the end of the second century A. D. could not but centre in the aspiration to be delivered from the burden of the body and to ascend into a better world. \"The aim of the mysteries is to lead the souls upwards to that goal from which they made their first descent\". \"Ascent and descent, death and rebirth\", the natural \"pas-sion\" of the soul140—those were the objects of all fears and of all hopes.

It may be recalled that the ceremonies of the mystery cults, which cnact the death and resurrection of a god (Bacchus, Osiris, Attis, Adonis) are supposed to derive from burial rites. 140 OLYMPIODOR., Phaed., t a 1, G : ότι σκοπό; τών τελετών έοΊιν ειβ τέλοί άνα-γαγείν τβ« ψυχάί έκεΐνο, άφ' ου τήν πρώτην έποιήαατο κάθοδον ώί άπ αρχή׳ (see η. 45).

We shall now turn our attention to the promises held out in this supreme sacrament. The neophyte is reborn through initiation to a new superhuman life, the splendor of which was to be fully realised only after the soul's final departure from the body.

But this interpretation is put out of court by the fact lhat the Chaldaean theurgists rejected the conception of astral pro-vidence; cf. ibe Oraclc quoted ch. iv, n. 99, v. 6. This erroneous explanation is due (a) to a mistake in the translation of •αίνΐω ύπό which in this case docs not signify \"to fall under the influence\", but \"10 belong to a class\" and (b) to an arbitrary identification of the Chaldean term αγέλη wilh lhe astral spheres called by Nicomachus of Gerasa (who follows a Babylonian tradition) άγέλαι (or άγγελοι) 1 see BIDEZ-CUMONT, Mages hell., II, 283.

It is only the temporary residence of the soul, who yearns to abandon it. What part could it play in the existence of the blessed, who do not experience sensual pleasures, but spiritual joy ? For these reasons, among others lsfi, it seems prefer-able not to interpret the \"salvation of the body\" as bearing on after-life. An explanation conforming to the anthropology of the Chaldeans is suggested by a correct interpretation of their view on the \"salvation of the body\". This notion is, according to non-Jewish and non-Christian ״l See n. 178. We may also recall Chaldean angelology (see ch. 1, n. 39 IT.). M KROLL, 61,; see also ibid., 46, a and 70.

In accordance that usage, the Neoplastonists, who quote the relevant Oracular f^ ments, apply this salvation to the corporal state of the initiated This explanation is in harmony with the Chaldaean beliefs concern! the causes of human disease. They hold, in common with the ma\", rity of their contemporaries, that many illnesses are occasioned by evil demons who possess themselves of the bodies of men and work thei physical ruin 159. The apotropaic rites, by which the Chaldaeans tried to protect themselves against the demonic agents of disease, will he studies later on 1Gn. Here it may suffice to remark that the Chaldaean Oracles dealing with the \"salvation of the body\" do not apply to corporeal resurrection, but to the immunity against demonic infection with disease. The \"salvation of the body\" from perdition at the hands of the demons constituted the immediate reward of the Chaldaean initiate 1,11.

JULIAN, Orat., VII, 919 when he stales lhat Dionysus was deified through theurgy after his birlh, refers (as is shown by 9 90 R) 10 the divine child translated by Hermes out of his mother Semele's house destroyed by Zeus' lightning. This lightning was identified by Julian with the άναγνγόν ατϋρ of the Chaldeean mystery; cf. lhe passages quoted ch. v, n. 7 and OLYMPIODOR, Phaed., A, 9 4 f. According to Bar-desanes (ajpud PORPH., Abit., IV, 18, p. 958, 95 f.) \"the Indians gave their bodies to the fire in order to separate the soul from the body in the purest form\" (cf. ROHDE, Psyche, I, 31, 1 who adduces parallels from Indian literature). Iamblichus' theory of the sacrifices set out De Myst., V, 11-19 seems 10 derive from similar Chaldean ideas. He declares that burnt-olTerings cannot serve as nourishment to the demons, as Porphyry supposes, for fire destroys all material things, transforms them into a substance similar to that of the heavens, and draws them upwards towards the divine original fire. This interpretation of the faculty of lhe sacrificial flame concords, as is proved by the terminology (τ# τον •svpot άναγωγτ), elc.) with the Chaldean conception of elevation in mystic fire. It 1s however possible lhat the Chaldean interpretation of the incineration of the corpses of their initiates was similar to that propounded by Iamblichus with regard to burnt-offerings; and this philosopher might accordingly have derived his con-ception regarding the purification and the uplifting of all material things through fire not from the Chaldean notion of the mystery of immortalization, hut fr01\" their burial rites."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"219 T11EUHGICAL ELEVATION. the initiated The opposition posited in that text between death of f the ..image\" points to the latter term being applied to the body ang0uj othej. cryptic terms, this peculiar designation the hurnan^ ^ famous Homeric passage.

Consequently, \"Wisdom\" must be iden-tical with one of the planets situated above the moon; it must also be localized below the sun, as according to one of the extant fragments it is placed between \"Virtue\" and \"Truth\", viz. the sun ls:l.

According to Psellus (see 11. 196), the soul of Plalo abides wilh Apollo and Hermes, i. e. she belongs to the chain of souls which proceeds from one of those (jods (see below). Proclus himself believed that his soul belonged to the \"chain\" of Hermes (MARINUS, Vit. Procl., 28), whom accordingly he called \"rny Lord\" (PROCL., Crat., 68, 12:ύ δεσπότη» ημών). Thus he must have regarded as \" Her-metic\" the soul of the Neopythagorean Nicomachus of Gerasa which, as he be-lieved, had been transmigrated into him (MARINUS, loc. cit.).

The \"Conjunction\" (mtylaats).— It seems to be expedient to begin our enquiry with an examination of a text of Marinus, whose biography of his master Proclus contains a paragraph especially devoted to that philosopher's theurgical activity.

This practice of theurgy among the Chaldeans can be traced back to the founder of that religious' community.

On the next day, he betook him-self again to the place of the sacrifice.

Owing to this process of transmission, some of the names cannot be interpreted with certainty. The numina invoked in the first and the third place are known to us from the magical texts. The invocation of the lord of the day was a part of the current magical ritual21. The current notions of the magical craft of the epoch, elaborated by the theurgists, account like-wise for the conjuration of the \"teacher of sacrifice\"22.

Cf. the sentence •>λλά ταύτα μέν έν άβάτ015 σκηνοίς διανοίας άνελίττω, with which he breaks off his allusions to the Chalda5an doctrine of Aion; ch. 11, n. 138. Cf. e. g. ρ.

As the overwhelming majority of the Chaldaean Oracles is delivered by Apollo, it seems plausible to suppose that he is identical with the \"teacher of the sacrifice\". According to the belief of the magicians, Apollo who dwells in the sun imparted his power to certain stones and herbs and by this means rendered them suitable for magical purposes26. Thus, it would seem that the term \"masters of the hylic substances\" applies to demons who held sway over certain classes of material objects and were in the service of Apollo himself. The two other numina invoked constitute a separate group. Thev are gods of time. The \"Lord of Time\" is none other than Aion, the supreme god of the Chaldeans 2י.

The fact that the magician is bidden \"to name the business with a view to which he offered the sacrifice\" 91 shows that the main theurgical operation which was to follow could be adapted so as to correspond to any particular purpose which was pur-sued32. This latitude is probably due to the many uses to which this method was put. To obtain the service of a ministering spirit—this was apparently considered as the indispensible prelude to all theur-gical operations. The necessity of such a compact was consequent upon the Chaldaean teaching as to the rdle of the demons in the sublunar sphere 33.

The soul which the mystic cere-0i ' \"s caused to ascend, was likewise obliged to traverse the domain Τ the evil spirits and needed protection against their onslaught. The Chaldeans employed various methods designed to obviate this demonic menace. These apotropaic rites will be studied in the next chapter. One of them was apparently the \"conjunction\" with a mini-stering spirit, whose function it was to accompany the soul during the theurgical elevation. Proclus mentions repeatedly, in connection with the Chaldean mystery of immortalization, the order of the angels regar-ded as the conductors of the soul during her ascent:t8. These pas-sages do not indicate whether an angel of this order was sent forth to meet the ascending soul of the initiate, or whether it was assigned to its service before the commencement of the sacrament, but the second hypothesis is the more probable one because of the analogy which it presupposes between the mystery of elevation and the ascension of the soul after death. Another argument in its favour is furnished by a statement of Olympiodorus as to the sequence of the sacramental rites in the oiHcial mystery-cults. According to his information (which pro-bably derived from Proclus) the neophyte after having undergone a \"public\" and a \"secret\" purification, accomplished the \"conjunction\" followed by the \"initiation\" and the \"vision\" 3(l.

A statement of Proclus fits in with this line of argument. Accord ing to him, \"effluvia of chthonic demons and phantoms becam manifest\" during the Eleusinian mysteries \"terrifying those to be iQj tiated, drawing them away from the gifts of the gods and luring them towards matter\" As we shall see, the Chaldeans held similar beliefs We may accordingly surmise that the functi6n assigned to \"conjunc tion\" in the Eleusinian mysteries and in those of the Chaldeans was analogous. This assumption would explain the fact that in the quoted conjuration, which according to the Chaldeans was efficacious in brin-ging about \"conjunction\" with the \"Lords of the substances\" of the plants and stones, Apollo was invoked in the first place. He was the veritable mystagogue of the Chaldean sacrament of immortality and, as the ruler of the sun, the goal of the \"elevation\". For these reasons, his interest, before that of the other gods, had to be engaged in favour of the \"conjunction\" of the initiate with the ministering spirit, that necessary prelude to initiation. The only Chaldean magical rites known to us in some detail are those set forth in the quoted text of Psellus concerning the \"covenant\" with the \"conjoined\" spirit. They conform by and large to those current in general magic and corroborate accordingly our assertion that the magical art of the Chaldean theurgists did not differ in essentials from that of their competitors (the \"goets\"). 2.

The consecration 0/ Hecate's statue— The Chaldeans seem to have not only practised the conjuration of the corporeal form of the gods, but also the casting of a spell over their statues which they inspired with life. The ritual of this \"telestic art\" was universally observed in the later antiquity; it was part of the established ceremonial of the consecration of new cultual images״:. According to Proclus, who in this connection draws not only upon the Chaldean tradition71, one of the so-called telestic operations consisted in making the statues of the deities capable of receiving divine light, in vivifying them and in causing them to deliver oracles; all this was accomplished by special magical actions. Julian the Theurgist composed a book entitled τελεστιχοί which certainly contained instructions concerning this craft, and practised himself the art of \"consecrating\" during the campaign against the Marcomans which marks the beginning of his and his father's celebrity. It was then that he placed according to Proclus on the demarcation line against the barbarians a human head made out of clay and \"consecrated\" by him (t. β. charged with magical power); '63, 15 and SYNESIUS, Insomn., 5, 19G3 C, use the verb as it is employed in the Oracle, while Excerpt, ex Theodolo, 56, follow PAUL, Rom., XI, 17 (the three pas-sages are quoted by KHOLL, 56, 9).

We may accordingly suppose that when the magical instrument was set in motion, it affected per analogiam the revolving heavenly spheres, and attracted the celestial lynges. The process of the conjuration was possibly represented in the fol-lowing manner : when one of the planetary gods is invoked, the Supreme Being, from whom every \"Resolve\" comes, sends forth one of his lynges to the sphere of the planet invoked (\"they leap into the radiant worlds\"). This Ivnx descends onto the invoking theurgist, to whom he manifests himself as a ministering spirit prepared to transmit his wish to the Supreme God. This practice of theurgy is accordingly, judged by its action, a magic of the celestial sphere, a trait whose importance lies in the light projected by it on the origin of thfe Chaldaean magical art83.

Bidez supposes that Pro-1jus performed his magical operation according to a formula identical that of Julian, or at least similar to it; and this view has much to recommend itIt is a well-known fact that the ancient belief in the possibility of influencing the weather was founded to some extent on the belief in the action of the stars. The Chaldaeans practised this form of magics by \"binding\" the spheres.

As we have seen 7,י׳ these gods were identical with the rulers of the planets and with those of the signs of the zodiac. Now, Proclus declares with some emphasis that these gods of time render, while they were worshipped, the soil fertile, but that when they were neglected, \"all earthly circumstance became contrary to nature\" 88. This explanation of the draught proves that the Chaldaean worship of the gods of time must be regarded as a fertility-cult'. The magical use of the lynges impossible that the theurgists were already known to Nicomachus (who lived in the first half of the und century A.

Another fragment identifies Heimarmene with the mate rial principle in man. The injunction of the Oracles \"not to aggran dize Heimarmene\" 2:1 means : Do not aggrandize in thyself the dominion of the corporeal, as it is the abode of the demons. The concreteness of the expression proves the reality of the Chaldaean belief in demons · the evil powers take possession of that part of man which is left unde-fended against their assaults 26. These few texts bring out very clearly the demonic character of the Chaldaean notion of destiny. As the theurgists conceived it, Destiny is a power thought of as personal, which becomes individualised in its demonic satellites. The immediate effect of the Chaldaean initiation was to eliminate this danger. The theurgist who had accomplished the sacramental rites was immune against the action of the demons; for he belonged already to the \"Father's\" kingdom. The power of the demons is manifested in the dimensions of the region they inhabit, extending as it did throughout the entire intra-mundane space.

At every downward step upon the staircase leading to tlie crypt of Hecate, where the consecration was to take place, new troops of demons appeared, who terrified the imperial neophyte, but were driven away by his mystagogue, the Neo-platonist Maximus of Ephesus.

This affir-!nation does not seem to have been an invention of the Christian adver-sary. We should not, of course, identify this sign with the Christian symbol; but as we have seen39, the sign of the cross was regarded by the Chaldsans as the sign of the Cosmic Soul, i. e. Hecate.

An ascetical morality is one of the chief consequences of this demono-logy. The terrestrial world is given over to the evil powers, who menace not only the body but also the soul of man.

We\"earn the opinion of the Chaldeans as to the prince of the demons from a scholium of Psellus, which sets forth the alleged opinions of the theurgists as to Hades. This text based on the interpretations of Proclus has not been utilized until now in the investigations of the Chaldean doctrine. Its statements deriving as they do from different layers of tradition must be thoroughly examined with a view to dis-tinguishing between those that reflect authentic Chaldsan belief and later additions; the minuteness of this scrutiny will be justified by the results. The fragment reads : \"The Chaldsans divide Hades in manifold ways : sometimes (1) they call him god, chief of the terrestrial domain; (9) sometimes they name thus the region below the moon, (3) sometimes the midmost line of the ethereal and the hylic world, and (4׳) sometimes the irra-tional soul\" 88. Psellus ascribes to the Chaldsans four different definitions of Haties, the first of which contains a genuine quotation, while the three others use Neoplatonic notions. The questions as to the authenticity of these three definitions must be decided a priori : the statement that the Chaldeans professed four different opinions as to one subject is impro-bable on the face of it and at variance with the conclusions that can be drawn from the foregoing investigations.

We shall see that both factors have played a part in the production of these definitions8'1. A comparison of the four definitions shows that the first, second and fourth are modifications of the same fundamental conception; which must have been genuinely Chaldean in view of the fact that the first definition derives from a quotation. On the other hand the third definition seems to have originated in another complex of beliefs. It situates Hades in the \"midmost line of the ethereal and the hylic world\" The source of this information seems to be the Neoplatonic explanation of the eschatological myths of Plato. Referring to one of their pas-sages, Proclus situates the place of punishment of the departed souls \"in the midst of heaven and earth\", i. e., as he explains, the domain which is immediately below the moon s:'.

This story shows that the theurgists credited the \"goets\" with extraordinary magical abilities which might enable them even to frustrate the theurgists when these endeavoured to achieve \"s Cf.* PORPH., Regr., 29*, 16 f. and Bidez' note. Porphyry tells the story in order to prove that theurgy is an art (disciplina, τέχνη) which \"produces both good and evil among men and gods\". Because of this ambivalence, the philo-sopher warns against the pursuit of theurgy : p. 35*, 2 2 f. \"י \"Conqueritur, inquit (Porphyrius), vir in Chaldsa bonus (translated άνήρ τι! έν Χαλδαία χρηστό!) purgandae animae magno in molimine (μεγάλω έν άγώνι vel άθλω) frustrates sibi esse successus, cum vir ad eadem potens (άνήρ •περί τϊ αύτά δεινό!, see ch. 1ν, η. 16) tactus invidia adiuratas sacris precibus potenlias alligasset (τά! έπασθείσα! 81' άγιων ευχών δυνάμει! χατέδησε), nc postulate con-cederent\". Augustine adds (Regr., p. 30*, 2 2 f.) that the powers invoked by the Chaldsans were held in check by the fear of a mightier divinity (\"per metuni valentioris numinis impediti\"), i. e. the spirit conjured up by the Chaldsans adversary. This observation likewise derives from PORPHYRY'S De regressu. The \"vir in Chaldsa bonus\" was apparently Julian the Chaldsan himself, as supposed by Bidez after LORECK, Aglaopham., 99 f. The parallel tradition figuring in Psellus (see n. 109) renders this supposition even more probable. \"Bonus and \"conqueritur\" are ironical. 107 See ch. 1, n. 128-12.9 and ch. iv, n. 79."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"287 CLIALDICAN DEMONOLOGY ith the gods and ministering spirits.

G., VI, 103 and Mel. Cumont, I, 93, 5 f.) : \"The Chaldsans draw their gods down through flattering songs and bind and loose them (see ch. i, n. 130).

Apuleius was no magician, but was transformed into one (with refe-rence to his apology pro se de magia liber) by the legend of the mrd and ivth cen-lury A. D. Anastasius Sinaita (see ch. 1, n. 1) shows that tales of the rivalry between the two were known in the vnth century. Both men are mentioned as \"magicians of the fields\" in another of Psellus' works quoted by ALL.VTIUS, De templis Graeeorum, Rome, 1645, p. 177 (see KHOLL, Ρ• Η,·׳ s. v. JULIANOS, No. 9, p. 15. For unidentified quotations from Psellus preserved by Allatius see KERN, Hermes.

Despite th ־' prohibitions, Ahriman and his infernal satellites were recognized even worshipped as divine beings. This cult had officially an apotr0 paic character, and its rites differed from those performed in honour of the good gods of light110. Apparently, the Chaldaeans accepted a similar compromise. Iamblichus, treating of the fight waged by the theurgists against the demons, does not mention the Chaldsan belief as to the necessity of placating the powers of evil by sacrifices and invo-cations and thus obtaining some protection against their wiles; a view which runs counter to the spiritual doctrine which forbids every contact with the impure powers. Psellus, however, states that \"the Chaldsans worship the subterranean gods and transmit in their Oracles instruc-tions as to the various ways of sacrificing to them\" 111. The hymnic VI. p. 85, 1), \"explained\" the magic rites of the lustration of the lields—probably in his work -σερί άγα·yrjs (see Excursus IX d). The spiritual character of Julian's magic was held by his partisans 10 prove his superiority over other thaumaturgists. They affirmed that by the force of a word he could divide a stone with his hand (SOZOMENUS, I. 18, λίθον βία λόγου τή χειρ! Βιελείν). Those adepts probably referred to a־ well-known magical for-inula similar to that quoted P. Mag., XII, 3 4 2, τό χρυπτόν όνομα άρρητον... 05... ai ιπέτραί άκουσαν at ρήγννυται; for other parallels see PRADEL, Griechische Gebete. Rel. Vers, und Vorarb., Ill, 3, 1907, p. 396. The fact that Psellus has inserted the name of Apuleius into the passage indicates that the magician hostile to Julian the Chaldsan was anonymous in the original source. The identity of this magician with the antagonist of the Chaldsan referred to by Porphyry is proved by Psellus' remark lhat Apuleius \"bound\" the \"Seven-rayed\" so that he could not hold intercourse with the theurgist. Porphyry relates lhat the magician hampered the Chaldsan \"in a great spiritual endeavour under-taken with a view to purifying his soul\". The purification of the soul was effected by the solar rays, whose ruler is designated by the Oracles as the \"Seven-Rayed One\". Psellus' and Porphyry's narratives refer accordingly to the same theui-gical operation and consequently derive from the same source. That of Psellus is probably taken from Proclus, who knew its original form and divested it of )is anecdotic traits, preserving its biographic character. 110 BIDEZ-CUMONT, Mages hell., I, 60 f., 143 IT. 111 PSELLUS, Script, min., 446, 33 f.

Suidas' quotation probably derives from a lost work of Proclus, who may have drawn upon the Ύελεσίιχά of Julian the Theurgist (see ch. 1, n. 1). The fact that amulets were worn on each member of the body may be accounted for by the doctrine that there is sympathy between the seven or twelve members of the body and the planets or the signs of the zodiac. See F. BOLL, Aus der Offenbarung Johannis, 1914, 144 (Addenda to p. 61) as to the relevant astrological theories, and BEZOLD-BOLL, Sternglaube und Sterndeutung*, 105; 136 f. י\" See ch. iv, n. 92.

Accord1 to their conception, the transcending God \"generated\" primal matt^ moved by blind impulse; created through the medium of His Intell^' the noetic pattern of the visible world; and charged the Second lect with the task of fashioning the material cosmos, through the junction of the formative ideas and of amorphous matter. This mod of creation accounts for the fact that, though everything in the universe has a corporeal character, none of the substances found in the world exists without an admixture of formative reason. The two extremes of the created world are on the one hand the Forms which are void of all corporality, on the other primal matter into which no Forms have penetrated. The first constitute the supramundane noetic sphere, the second is the subterranean \"deep\" of the Tartarus. The amorphous matter lhat antecedes all becoming and all formative activity is called \"irrational\", as it has not received the spiritual quali-ties of the formative Ideas. The fact that this primal matter is the sub-stratum of all generated things accounts for the negative quality per-ceptable to a greater or less degree in all the portions of the world of sense. The various proportions in which matter is commingled with the Ideas determine the positive or negative quality of the resultant mixture. The penetration of the material world by the rational Ideas, springing from the \"first transcendental Fire\", is conceived as analo-gous to an illumination proceeding from a primordinal supramundane light. The greater the distance of the created world from the source of the Ideas, the poorer their quality. This gradation of the effects of divine action corresponds to the system of the universe, which includes the world of the fixed stars, the seven spheres of the planets and the lowly terrestrial zone.

Thus the universe is ruled by two opposed prin-ciples, the strenght of whose influence depends on their greater or lesser share in the mixture. Man is placed between the two antagonists, who wage their war in him and about him; he is the victor's prize. The system of the Chal-dsans centred in a conception of human life; it is but natural that their dualism should have left the deepest impress on their anthropo-logy. According to them, the human body is formed of the vilest of all creatured substances '6s. Because of this, all irrational impulse must be imputed to it. On the other hand, the soul sojourning in this material integument is of noetic origin. It is the divine principle in man and is held down by the predominance of matter in the \"hylic world\", which tends to strengthen the corporal impulses of man : a being determined by three factors, the body, the soul and material environment.

On the other hand, the soul of the ascete who eschews earthly passions rises aloft \"towards the rays of the Father\" »ד She is bidden \"not to incline\" during this ascent towards the \"dark-glowing world\" (the terrestrial zone), because the \"deep\" of primal matter void of divine essence is spread beneath it. These expressions which are clearly of Platonic origin, are not mere metaphors : they apply not only to the various stations of salvation or condemna-tion, but also to the actual portions of the universe (deep, earth air, moon, sun, ether, etc.) which correspond to these stations. The grades of qualitative purification have their spatial counterparts, which mark the various stages in the road to the supramundane Empy-rean.

The fear of the demons developed among them as in many of the religions of later antiquity an excessive spiritualism, which condemned Hyle as the diabolic principle. Thus the conviction of the Chaldeans as to the power of corruption inherent in material things was due not only to the Platonic doctrine which denies Hyle a share in the divine illumination, but also to the belief in the practical identity of the material with the demonic prin-ciple. By assimilating the antagonism between spirit and matter to that existing between the good and the evil demons they altered the nature both of matter and of the demons. For the Neoplatonists matter was nothing but an obscuring and defiling element which hindered man from uniting with the divine principle. For the Chaldeans it was more than that; not only a passive obstacle, but an active and even aggressive negative power. The man who yields to bodily impulse draws towards himself demons who take possession of him. Devotion to material things leads not only to the loss of man's \"ideal\" capacities, but also to his being vanquished by the powers of evil, who bring about his utter ruin.

This is an example of the theurgical method of classifying spirits according to the divisions of the universe to which the entities concerned were sup-posed to conform in their qualities. This method enabled the theur-gists to combat the evil powers by magical means depending for their validity on the universal cosmic laws.

However, the self-consistency of their doctrine, when considered as a whole, must not be allowed to conceal the fact that they borrowed the elements of their construction from diverse religious and philosophical doctrines of their time. A full understanding of their peculiarity is therefore attainable only by means of an examine-tion of the original relationship of these elements.

The consequent widening of the field of our study in this his. tory will make us acquainted with a whole series of phenomena in which a similar religious need is expressed and similar fundamental questions find adequate answer. It cannot be considered an accident that the origination of the Chaldeean system should be temporally coincident with the most flourishing period of the Oriental mystery-religions, of the Hermetic theosophy and of western gnosticism, as well as with the revival of the metaphysical tendencies of Platonism. The question of the immediate reciprocal influence of these systems becomes from this higher view-point the question of their spiritual similarity. Only on the basis of such a wide survey of contemporary religious movements can a more just evaluation of the peculiar accomplishments of the theur-gists be also, at last, attained. 2. The contemporary Platonism.— Most manifest is the relationship of the Chaldeans to the teachings of Plato. This dependence was stated openly—in a form appropriate to their magical notions—by the authors of the Chaldeean Oracles themselves. Psellus (t. e. Proclus) reports, on the ground of a direct statement of Julian the Chaldean, that he (Julian) conjured up the soul of Plato in order to question it at will, and made it the familiar spirit of his son, the future theurgist Consequently the Platonism of the Chaldeans claimed for itself the authority of an authentic self-interpretation of Plato, who speaks again, to a certain extent, in the Oracles of the Chaldeans.

The Chaldaeans were fully aware of'this relationship, as their polemics against divergent opinions prove, and saved themselves from critical contradiction by recourse to the infallibility assured by their inspiration. From this situation there arises, for a sober observer, the question as to the nature of this Pla-tonism which was known to the Chaldaeans. The treatment of this question leads us deeper into the history of this school of philosophy. Consequently before attempting it, we must call to mind a few of the principal data concerning the chief figures of this period of the Platonic school—(the period of \"Middle Platonism\")—data which will be indis-pensable for the understanding of what follows ־-. A sure point of departure for the nearer determination of that milieu in which the Platonism known to the Chaldeans must be sought, is furnished by the tradition concerning the place and time of the theur-gists. Julian the Chaldean and his son worked in Rome at the time of the' two Antonines. At the same period there lived in Rome the Platonists Numenius3 and Celsus, the latter of whom was made famous by his attack on Christianity4. Concerning the possible Roman י The best introduction to Middle Platonism is UEBERWEG-PIUECHTER , Die Phi-k»ophie de* AUertums \" (Berlin, 1ga6), S 70 (quoted as \"Praechter\"). E. ZELLER, Die Philosophie der Griechen, Teil III, 4th (and 5th) ed., unparalleled for his syste-matical treatment, was not able, for want of preparatory studies, to pay sufficient attention to the historical development of the doctrines of the school. Cf. LYDUS, Men*., IV, 80, p. 13A, 11 : Νουμήνιο! ό Ρωμαίο!. The fragments °f Numenius are cited according to the collection of E. A. LEEMANS, Numenius van Apamea, Gent, 1937.

More-over, it must be remembered that the spiritual power of Plato began at this time to extend itself far beyond the limits of the teaching in the Platonic school. The otherworldly dualism then everywhere prevalent recognized, in the sacral pathos of transcendental Platonism, the expres-sion of its own experience of life, and this long before Plotinus had expressed these religious impulses in strictly philosophical form. Middle Platonism itself shows, in this situation, the appearance of a transitional and preparatory period. Orthodoxy believing every let-ter found itself side by side with levelling eclecticism, logical scholasti-cism with mystical transcendentalism. The Platonism of the Chaldaeans shows close relationship to the last-named type, of which the represent-ative we best know was in their time this Numenius already spoken of׳. s Maximus of Tvre lectured in Rome at the time of Commodus, but represents the pre-Numenian phase of Platonism (ZELLER, III, 2, 319 f.). ' Justin Martyr was a Platonist before his conversion to Christianity (Apol., II, 12) and lived in Rome from ca. 150 on (died ca. 165). Valentinus came from Alexandria to Rome ca. 135 (lived there until 160). The most important of his Italian disciples were Ptolemaeus (active ca. 145-180) and Heracleon (died ca. 300). Tatianus, Justin,s pupil in Rome, was also influenced by Valentinus. PLOTINUS, in Enn., II,'9, apparently attacks Gnostics living in Rome; see n. 4·ל י The orientalism of Numenius is overestimated.

At the same time it must not, of course, be overlooked th* the Platonism of Plotinus actually differs not only in quality, but aj formally, from that of the Chaldeans. The Platonic precursors of the Chaldeans cannot be compared in systematizing power with Plotinus (no more can any of the other representatives of Middle Platonism) Moreover, the authors of the Oracles produce no dialectical discussions but only dogmatic results. It is plausible that they took over this dogmatic digest of a system from one of the teachers of the Middle Pla-tonic school, and that it may have resembled in its outer forms that of Albinus. They retained the doxographic character of these commu-nications, for it seemed to them that best fitted for the positive fashion of speech required in divine vaticinations. 3. The dependence of the Chaldeeam upon the contemporary Platonism (The doctrines of the ideas and of the sequence of the noetic principles).— The study of this point must begin with the proof that the Platonism of the Chaldeans presents neither a free selection nor an individual rearrangement of the original teachings of the founder of the school, but took over the results of a contemporary interpretation of Plato״ . This proof can be given most clearly by reference to the doctrine of ideas, which in the period of Middle Platonism went through a funda-mental reformation.

The Power of God.—The Platonic foundation of lhe Chaldaean teaching concerning the hypostases appears more significantly in their views on the divine \"Power\". This \"Power\" is the sum of the poten-tialities of the Supreme Being, the substance and medium of His acti-vity, and—since His energy acts immediately only upon the intelligible world—the designation of the totality of that world. The parts of that totality, the ideas, receive, by reason of the source of their substance, the name \"Powers\"71. The historic assignations of this teaching concerning the divine Power can be seen from the polemic of the Chaldaeans against other opinions as to its nature. They emphasize, on the one hand, that the \"Father' has, indeed, \"withdrawn\" Himself from all direct activity, ,'but He does not enclose His Fire within His Power\" 72, i. e. He witholds within His transcendence only His existence, not His efficacitv. On the other hand, they explain that \"the first transcendent Fire\" («. the \"Father\") \"encloses bis Power in matter not by acting, but bv thinking\" 7:1; 1. e. He enters into matter not immediately but by the mediation of His Second Intellect which forms the world. The opinion contested in the second oracular fragment is that of the Stoics, who supposed the original divine power (the \"noetic fire\") to permeate 71 See ch. 11, n. 46, 47, 95a.—\" See ch. 11, n. 45.—\" See ch. 11, n. 184."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"333 TIIE PLATONIC ELEMENTS 7/1 Against their view is directed also the explanation, found \"18\"\"other Chaldean Oracle, that God is \"all, but noetically\" 75.

Philo, in this passage, platonizes, as has often heen remarked already77, the Stoic concept of the immanent power of the divine within the world, and his platonizing is accomplished bv the identification of this power with the transcendent ideas. A similar modification is also the basis of the Chaldean view of the power of God. As the second fragment of the Oracle ruled out the Stoic doctrine of substantial immanence, so the first disassociates itself from the theory of an absolute transcendence of the Supreme God. The representatives of this view were the Peripatetics who exalted the divinity, sunk in bles-sed self-contemplation, above all participation in the world ?tl. Simi-lar repudiation of both the Stoic and Peripatetic doctrines, in the definition of the supreme Being, was undertaken by \"certain Platonists\" whom Porphyry cites.

From all th' it appears that, in the dogmatic formulas of the Chaldeean Oracles abov quoted there is reflected the actual controversy from which developed the \"dynamic\" concept of God found by the Neoplatonists. From the double negative limitation in the definitions of the Oracles it is possible to arrive at the explanation of the purpose behind the development of the Chaldaean doctrine of the divine Power : this doctrine is intended to constitute a compromise between an utterly sublimated concept of the divine principle, and the consciousness of a universe vaded by divine Powers. The Power is, indeed, as the unity of the divine nature demands, identical with the Supreme God. but is nevertheless, for the purpose of fulfilling its particular task. separated from Him. The Primal Being can restrain Himself within His transcendence only by means of making His Power the organ of all energies which work upon the world. Thereby the supracelestial world is transformed to the sum of spiritual substances endowed with divine energy. The necessity of this redefinition of the intelligible world fol-lowed from the reinterpretation of the ideas, which, formerly, the thoughts of God, now become His active Powers. This new teaching about the divinity as the whole of Power, and the Ideas as the partial Powers thereof, appears in the philosophical literature which has came down to us, for the first time in Philo. It is represented by him as synthesis of the Stoic view of the power immanent in the world, and of the Platonic doctrine of Ideas81. The polemic exclusions of the Oracles suggest a similar relationship. Plotinus, too, concedes power as the proceeding effect of the transcendent God 8.׳- The teaching of \" PORPH., Abst., II, 37, p. 166, 3 : b μέν vrpHros &eds.. . ούτε έν τινι Ώ·׳ ούτ1 έν&ε$εμένο* ε if έαυτόν. \" See Excursus XI. \" See η. 77· Cf. also NUMENIUS, p. 89, 3 f. \" ZBILER, III, 476 f., 548 f.

The Oracles represent the entities of the intelli-gible world as potencies which proceed from the Primal Being 83. This process is described by comparisons with sensible events—compari-sons drawing on various fields of experience. Most frequently appears a) the metaphor of flowing : from the Paternal Intellect flows forth the primary source of the Ideas; from these, the Forms; from the Cos-mic Soul her enlivening substance 8.'׳ To this type of metaphors—ema-native in the exact sense of the word—belongs also the figure of mixing. The First Intellect mixes in all things Eros and in the \"Connectives\" his own power; the \"Father\" mixes the Pneuma from a triad of (>sy-chical essences 86, In second place b) follow the metaphors of procre-ation. Power is called \"mother\" or \"maternal womb\", inasmuch as the \"Father\" procreates therein His thoughts. The Paternal (First) Intellect \"suckles\" the Second Intellect which \"becomes pregnant\" with the universe; 01• Aion resembles a monad which \"procreates\" a dyad8«. In connection with the metaphors of procreation occurs also the figure of sowing. \"In the womb of this Triad (the substances of tbe soul) are all things sown\"87.

The characteristic of such a doc-trine is lacking, viz. •: a consistent theory as to the fixed sequence of the potencies which proceed as a series of steps from the divine prin-ciple. The reason of this lack is to be sought, as we have shown before, in the fluctuating state of the Middle-Platonic theories (on which the Chaldeans are dependent) as to the sequence of the noetic hypostases. On the other hand it is withal clear that the Chaldean metaphors des-cribing the emanation are no mere figures of speech. In a few cases, truly, it can be recognized that the figurative representation is arti-ficial; so in the Oracular verse : \"The Father does not make fear flow in, but pours forth trust\"91. However, this example and others like it. prove only that the Chaldeans employed a certain concept of emana-tion in a stylistic device which they sometimes overworked 'ri. We have therefore in our judgment of the Chaldean doctrine of emanations to distinguish between a metaphysical principle of their philosophy, and the stylistic hypertrophy of this principle.

This axiom cer-tainly resulted, in many cases, in a conscious translation of specula-tive theories into realistic events, but nevertheless is not therefore to be understood as a mere stylistic device; it was, in fact, the consequence of an immediate mythical apperception of the divine energy. The reli-gious experience of these theologians shaped for itself a special form of expression, in which idea and picture blend in a peculiar unity of thought95. They not only take over the philosophic myths of Plato (especially of the Timaeus) in the images of which, so manifold in their connotations, they recognized the symbols of their own views: but they also penetrated the substance of Plato's teaching with their spirit. The reawakening of the mythical consciousness is perhaps to be considered as the most powerful cause of the inner transform-»tion of the Platonic Ideas from static concepts into \"!lowing\" \" See Excursus III. The classic example of the mythical reworking of philo-sophical thoughts is the didactic poem of Lucretius. The most significant example is provided by the Oraclc on the world-forming ·deas (quoted ch. 11, n. 177). Cf. also the second fragment on Eros (quoted ch· », n. 933). j Cf. Chr. F.

The interest, in the thinking God (metaphysics) is replace by that in the spiritual fullness of the hidden life of the transcendent G 4 (theosophy). The divine existence itself becomes the myth of an etem | interplay of Powers in which the dynamic of the structure of the uni verse is reflected. This divine existence unfolds itself in a plural'« of potencies which to the analytic thought of the symbolists constant/ provided new aspects for fresh concretization. Under the influence of this tendency the Chaldeeans presented their metaphysical conclusions not in abstract concepts but in sensible vividness. That they there, by attached themselves not to the Gnostics but to Platonic predeces-sors is clearly shown, when the four types of emanative metaphors distinguished above, are studied with respect to their general appli-cations and their sources. a) The image of flowing forth as representation of the way noetic enti-ties come into being is known both to Philo and to Plotinus, the two chief representatives among the Platonists, of the doctrine of emana-tions. The first uses the metaphor without proviso 97, while the second expressly repudiates the associated notion of a quantitative emanation 98— a limitation which the Chaldsans accomplish in the form of their refe-rence to the Supreme Being as \"indivisible\" 99. A second limitation of Plotinus concerns the cause of the emanative process : he will have it instituted neither by an intellectual nor by a volitional act of the Pri-mal Being, on the contrary it follows of itself by reason of the efRcacity latent in his nature '00. In this point the three systems differ. Philo \" As against both the phantastic hypothesis of Darmesteter that the Avestic doctrine of the Amesha Spenlas is dependent on Philo's of the Divine Powers, and the reverse hypothesis, which is represented especially by J. PASCHER, ή βασιλική bids (1931) and E. R. GOODENOUGH, By Light, Light (New Haven, 1 G35), it is still worth-while to compare what was said by BAUR, Christliche Gnosis, 71 f. \" Cf.

However, inasmuch as they made the Supreme Intelligence the practical ruler of the world, they allowed the religious dogma of the creative freedom of God to be equated with the metaphy-sical axiom of the rationality of His rule of the world. Consequently the factual division between the Plotinian and the Chaldean explana-tion of the dynamic of the emanative process is considerably diminished. For if Plotinus refers the efficacity of the Primal Being to mere natural necessity, and the Chaldeans to the \"Intellect\" of His \"Power\", it follows that the correction of Plotinus—who could have allowed the efficients named by the Chaldeans to pass as natural modes of the Sup-reme Being—is reduced to the conceptual firmness with which the lat-ter carried through the abstraction of the transcendental aspect of the divinity. His radical denial of any action of the Primal Being brought him, as is often emphasized101, into contradiction with the notion, which he advocated with equal firmness, of God's creative efficacity. There is no need here to enter further into the dialectical subtleties with which he attempted to eliminate the discrepancy which was implicit ״n this system 102.

In several Gnostic systems she is termed \"Power\" of the Primal Being; and in that of some Valentinians as His \"Thought\" who, assisted by His \"Will\", gives birth to the \"First-born Intellect\" and to \"Truth\" \"7. The last named version furnishes a further parallel- to the Chaldsan doctrine of the Supreme Intellect who, with the help of His Will, emanated the Ideas. On the other hand it may be remembered that the concept of the bisexual nature on a Graeco-Egyptian mysticism. This, as far as it concerns the locality, should he accepted (cf. WITT, 2A f. on the spread of Middle Platonism in Alexandria). However, it must be emphasized that the mythical elements in the doctrines 0Γ the authors in question can hardly be traced back to a specific Egyptian theosophy. This possibility is finally excluded by the addition of the Chaldseans to this group. Moreover, Plutarch (or his source) interprets the Isis-Osiris myth more Plalonico, as other representatives of the Platonic school (e. g. Celsus; see n. 260 and 265) do with other non-Greek myths. Their interpretations are speculative exegeses without traditional bases. Cf. A. D.

The figure of \"seeding\", one of the most common metaphors for the activity of the creator of the world 121, again presupposes a personalistic concept of God. Otherwise to be explained is the designation of the substance of the First Intellect as \"fiery flowers\" which are \"plucked\" by the noetic beings to him subor-dinate. This metaphor is basic both to the comparison, used also by Valentinus, of the Primal Being with a tree and of the entities which proceed from him with fruit, as well as to Philo's allegory of the Manna explained by him as the symbol of the divine Logos '22.

In the centre of their imagery there stands, not, as in that of the Platonists the sun which beams on all alike, but the primal fire, which divides itself into flashes of lightning.

Consequently we must consider the Chaldean symbolism of lightning as a deliberate modification of the Platonic symbolism of Light126. Herewith the inquiry concerning the nature and source of the Chal-dean doctrine of emanations is concluded. It has shown that the Chaldeans stand in the closest relation to a special form of Middle Pla-tonism of which the influence is reflected with varying intensity also in the writings of Philo, Numenius and Plotinus as well as those of the See ch. 11, η. 38ά.       ״       י\"     An abundant documentation on light-symbolism is collected, if not cn 1 examined, in J.

That lam-blichus drew this division not from the Oracles 142 but from a Middle-Platonic tradition is proved by its partial agreement with the Philonic are \"emanations of the powers contained in the Father\" (PROCL., Th.

Consequently, these demiurgic Logo! correspond to the Logoi of Philo (see HEINZE, Lehre vom Logos, 290 f., 278 f.) and their monad to the Logos. With reference to PLATO, Tim., hod, 6 and Conv., 302 e, 7, the Neopla-tonists identify these demiurgic gods with the \"leaders\" of the demonic souls. In the same way, Philo designates the powers of the Ideas both as partial energies of the Logos and as angelic souls (ZELLER, III, 2, 408). Thus the Platonists attach their doctrine of the divine potencies no less to that of the Ideas than to lhat of the Cosmic Soul (the \"source\" of the demonic souls). The variations result from the difference of the point of view : in one case, the personified exe-culors of the divine thoughts, in the other, the thoughts themselves are considered. lhe Chaldmans regard both the angels and the lynges as procreations of the divine Intellect (see ch. ״, sect. 12 and 14).

A Middle Platonic interpretation of PLATO, Tim., 3 8 c, 3 : τόν •ποιητήν xai •πατέρα τούδε τού •παντό! (see η. 3 5) seems to have influenced the elaboration of this division; cf.

Philo finds in Goodness not only the source of God's creative abundance, but also the subjective ground of his emanative activity 1׳,'·'. It is possible that his Platonic predecessors had also developed the representation of God's activity as emanative, which, as was remarked above, forms a characteristic of the \"dynamic pantheism\" of the latter Platonic school. From this tracing back of the Philonic doctrine of the powers of God to Philo's Platonic predecessors, it follows that also those elements of the Chaldaean doctrine which agree with Philo's depend from the same tradition 1r'°.

It is possible that the famous Aristotelian doctrine of a trans-cendent Divine Intellect which moves the heaven ώβ έρώμ,ενον (a doctrine current among Middle Platonists)153 has also exerted its influence here Thus the striking agreement of the appropriate verse of the Chaldtean Oracles just quoted with the last verse of the Dtvina Commedia : \"L'atmr che move il sole e I'altre stelle'' would be explained on the ground of depen-dance on a similar model.

The movement of the parts of the cosmos is not only a result of their possession of life. but also the source of all temporal transitoriness 173 and material limi-tation, of Ananke viz. Heimarmene. The personification of these two powers through Hecate also goes back to the doctrine of contemporary Platonists about the World-Soul. Four representatives of Middle-Pla-tonism refer to her as charged with the enforcement of the divinely ordained laws of the world m. They again base their theory on a pas-sage of the Timaeus •: The demiurge \"showed\" the souls which have just been created \"the nature of the universe, and explains to them the rules of fate\" : embodiment, wandering as expiation for earlier trans-gressions, and final deliverance 17®. \"Nature\" and \"Fate\" thus become domains of operation for the Cosmic Soul, which also receives rulership According to PLOTINUS, III, 7, 11 and 19, PORPHYB., Sent., c. 4/1, p. 45, 16 f. and PROCL., Ale., 519, 10 (who refer to PLATO, Tim., 38 b, 6), the Cosmic Soul creates Time.

Here it is enough to have established the fact that the three manifestations of the Chaldeean Hecate : Psyche—Physis—Heimarmene, derive from the Middle-Plato-nic speculation as to the Cosmic Soul177, The Cosmic Soul of the Chaldeeans is, like that of the Platonists, not only the originator of all life hut also the source of human souls. The Oracles describe the origin of these last in mythical figures : \"Having mingled the Spark of the Soul with two like-minded faculties, with Intellect and divine Will, the Father added to them as a third chaste Eros, the Binder of all things and their sublime guide\" This representation, to all.appearances, goes back to the exegesis of a famous passage of the Timaeus (41 d),—a passage described by Plotinus as divine riddle 'ד,—י in which the making of the individual souls is described. Plato explains there that the demiurge mixes, in \"· IAMBLICHUS, De fato, ap.

Accord-to the Timaeus (35 a) the demiurge makes the Cosmic Soul (the rocess of her mixture is a model for the mixing of the individual souls) by mixing at first from two substances—the indivisible and self-con-slant, as well as that which is divisible in the bodily region— a \"middle. third form of the substance\". By the undivided and divided sub-stances Plato means, according to the interpretation of the greater number of his ancient exegetes, the substances of the noetic and sen-sible worlds respectively181. If so, the three psychic substances men-tioned in the Oracle : Intellect, Will and Eros, can be explained as equi-valents of those given by Plato 18-. The undivided is equivalent to the Intellect, the divided to the Will, and the.mixing to \"Eros, the binder of all things\". The first and the third of these equations are self-explanatoryIM, so that only the second is in need of evidence. PLATO, Tim., 4 1 d, 4 f.

This fact is a new proof of their immediate depen-dence on contemporary Platonism, in which the centre of interest was occupied by just this essential work of natural philosophy, explained in a large number of commentaries (of which only scanty fragments have been preserved).

From the inquiry concerning the Platonic elements of the Chaldaeans' concept of the World-Soul, we turn to the question of the source of its identification with Hecate. To this a direct answer cannot be given, inasmuch as the tradition concerning the late forms of the cult of Hecate is not sufficient 19:1. As point of departure may be taken the fact that the Chaldaeans got hold of Hecate, as also of Apollo, through magic. This relationship finds its clearest expression in their appropriation of the statue used in the cult of this goddess of magic. The Chaldaeans carried through the transition from magic to metaphysics by interpre-ting the attributes of this figure according to the characteristics of the Cosmic Soul of the Platonists 194. The allegorical interpretation of a cult-statue was a usual means of giving a particular divinity universal character '95. This method, which was developed by the Stoics and carried further by the Neoplatonists, The Neoplatonists frequently reverse the relationship in using the relevant Chaldean Oracles to sanction the Platonic thoughts. 1,1 See Excursus II.

Internal evidence also argues in favour of this sup position. The Cosmic Soul is a metaphysical, not a mythical, concept and wherever it is found in ancient theology, there is to be presupposed some influence—however mediated—of Plato 200. Now nothing is known of an association of Platonic metaphysics with any sort of religious magical or cosmological notions related to Hecate, before the time of the Chaldaeans.

Psyche causes the fatal 1,6י ulsion which rules the world and man; she represents all-powerful ηΐην, in the reverence of which all the pagan religions of this time found themselves in accord. The Cosmic Soul of the Platonists is, however, not only the ruler of destiny, but also the redeemer from its rule Turned alike towards the sensible and towards the noetic realm, she personifies not only the compulsion of natural existence, but also the freedom of the mind. So she became, for the Platonists, the pro-totvpe of the need of men, and of their salvation. In this ambivalence of the metaphysical potency should be sought the real ground of her identification with the highest goddess of the Theurgists, and the key to the understanding of her character. Hecate, the pure, undivided life in the sphere of the divine, the motive power behind intramundane fate and ordainer of demonic servitude, personifies the essential thoughts of the soteriology of later antiquity : the dogma of the divine origin of the human soul, its fall and entanglement, its return and redemption. The Chaldeean Hecate encountered the human souls in forms always adequate to their internal conditions : for those sunk in the body she was necessity ; for the erring, demonic temptation ; for the renegade, a curse ; for those who recalled their divine nature, a guide; and for those who returned home, grace. This companionship during all phases of the existence of the human soul was at the same time self-encountering of the universal soul with her parts. She herself fell and cast down others, strayed and lead astray, was judged and was judge, and, in the indi-v'dual soul, she redeemed herself. .Her capacity to sympathize with 911 individual needs, without herself abandoning the norm of perfect existence, aroused between her and her worshippers a sympathy 111 ^ a genuine feeling of personal religion found expression.

On the act of out-stretchihg the rays of the soul follows a reaction of the intended object of thought, during which the organ of thought remains passive. Also the Chaldsan Oracles explain that when the knowing \"stretches out\" the \"flower of his intellect\" towards the divine, this sends down its light and fills the soul with itself22·1. A presupposition of this union is the organic relation of the organ knowing with the object known. The \"eye of the soul\" is a part of the Primal Intellect, which is mixed in with the substances of the human soul. When this is purified from all foreign components, the man soul. Personal experience of the superiority of this \"knowledge\", in which the soul (or her rational part, the Nous) became a mere receptive organ, convinced Philo of the fact that self-effacement of the human mind is a precondition of the union with the divine.

Through the association of the equation Hades-Hyle with the belief in a god Hades and his hylic demons, Hyle is changed from a cosmological principle to a personal potency. It becomes the practical procreator of powers, hostile to the gods, which cause the evil of the world—and explain it.

How they set this at one wit^^ existence of a god such as Hades, or of the hylic demons, can no 10 ^ be known 469. In any event it is clear that the metaphysical m \"·^ of the above-named demonologists found no support in their antl! pology. The hylic demons loose Matter from the divine causulit-which it owed its origin, and set it up against that causality as a p^ tically second evil principle. The question as to the nature of matter, which occupied the Plato. nists of whom we have spoken, was also treated in their epoch hy the Gnostics, and by them answered with formulae which at times are in close contact with those of the Chaldeans. Three of these Gnostic parallels will in the following pages be subjected to a detailed exami-nation. The Gnostics whose theories here interest us were, in contra-distinction to the Platonists cited (except for Plutarch), determined dua-lists. Their cosmology rest on the dogm of the original corruption of the preexistent matter. In the exposition of this view, which often look the literary form of a cosmogonic myth, they frequently refer to the description of Hyle in the Timaau of Plato. Since Plato's sup-position that matter was created and originally without qualities doubly contradicted their axiom, they chose, instead of expounding the pas-sages of the essential Platonic text, to correct it. This critical attitude appears significantly in the way in which Yalen-tinus, the principal representative of Western Gnosticism, applies the Platonic formula of \"flowing matter\". It serves him as a term for the primal matter from which the terrestrial soul of man was created and PLUTARCH, De dtf. orac., 10, 415 A (see n. 466) treats demonology and the doctrine of the preexistence of the evil World Soul as alternative solutions for the question as to the origin of evil; he decides, however, in favour of the second, the dualistic, hypothesis. Porphyry, who opposes the second solution (see Abtl-1, 40, p. 116, 11 f. and Excursus XI; ap. PBOCL.. Tim., 1, 3g 1, 4 ff. Cf. 1W-393, 14 ff. his collection of monistic testimonies from Plato), accepts the first thesis—a proof for the fact that the supposition of the existence of evil demons made unnecessary tiie derivation of evil from a second World Soul."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"340 T11E PLATONIC ELEMENTS it owes its inborn corruption 270.

Thus Lietzmann's hypo-thesis (Gesekiehte der alien Kirehe, II, Berlin, 1936, 270) of the dependence of esanes on Hermogenes loses one of its principal supports.

This is inserted into the cosmogonic process by dint of makin bin! the ruler of Hyle, which, however, really does not owe its evil tg him at all, for it was already evil by nature. In fact the doctrine that matter is evil is found also among the Marcionites without any men-tion of the ־־Evil One\": on the other hand one also finds there the substitution of the \"Evil One\" for matter 279. The account given by Theodoret represents therefore a contamination of the mythological and cosmological versions one by another. ג: . The division of Hyle into matter of three qualities is to be under-stood only relatively, since all Hyle is bad. The three qualities repre-sent only three grades of the same essentially inferior substance. The condemnation of the creation by reason of the deficient quality of its material was a fundamental doctrine of the Gnostic cosmology. 3. The distinction of the materials of heaven, of the sublunar world including the earth, and of Hades (viz. Tartarus) is a Gnostic trans-formation of the Platonic doctrine that the formed cosmos gradually becomes worse by reason of the declining activity of the noetic light. In the Marcionite version the Ideas (viz. the Logos), which give form to the unshaped primal matter, are lacking, for neither before nor THEODORET, loc. cit. : τήν ύλην κακήν τε ούααν καϊ ύπ' άλλω κακώ τελούσα»' τύν H &ημ:ονργύι> •αεριγενύμενον τού κακού, τήν ύλην λαβείν τε και έκ ταντν» &ημιονρ·)·ήσαι τά σύμπαντα, έκ μέν τοϋ χαθαρωτάτου τύν ούρανύν, έκ ίέ τοΰ λοιπό״ τά σΊοιχεϊα τά τέτταρα, έκ &έ τήί ύνοσίάθμηί (see 11. 370-376^01׳ AILVV **' τύν Τάρταρον. 1\"HIPPOLYT.

Since in this account lhe distinction of qualities is well grounded, we may assume that the doctrine of Hyle adopted by the Chaldeans formed the basis of the analogous speculation of the Marcionites known to Theodoret280. In the Gnostic testimonies cited here recur two of the characteristics attributed bv the Chaldsans to matter : the supposition of the con-tinued existence of an unimproved part after the great mass had been given form; and the identity of this sediment with Hades. It seems scarcely dubious that these points of agreement give evidence of a com-inon starting point. The more exact determination of this origin can-not, however, be accomplished without further deliberations. Direct influence of the Chaldeans on the Gnostics is already out of the ques-tion, for the reason that their doctrines give no sign of a relationship to this religious movement. The same goes for the reverse relation-ship. Also, the supposition of a Gnosticizing Platonism, as a media-ting link, finds no support in the history of this philosophic school. So we must look for another explanation of this correspondence. The way to this explanation is pointed by the origin and character of the Chaldean doctrine of the divinization of Hades. This religious doctrine, as was shown in the foregoing chapter, stems from Persia281.

One may consider Julian the Chaldaean himself, the founder of Theurgy, as the originator of this transformation. He composed—as did Origen, the chief authoritv for Porphyrian demonology—a theoretical treatise \"On the demons\" 28׳,, of which, indeed, no direct citations are preserved, but whose tendency can be determined on the ground of the Chaldaean Oracles, Julian's principal work. It is to be supposed that their author, true to his claim of inspiration by Plato and in conformity with the character of his Oracles, sought to bring the principles of his own demonology, mingled as it was with Iranian elements, into harmony with the dua-listic teachings of Plato, viz. those of the contemporary representatives of the Platonic school.

It seems doubtful whether he wojj have known that he thereby overstepped the limits of the Platonic dualism. His recession from the standpoint of the \"school\" explains itself, without the supposition of Gnostic influence, from the tenden cies implicit within the Chaldsan system itself. The so-called I1ylir world becomes, by reason of the demons lodged in and ruling over it the location of powers opposed to God which deprive it not only of the influence of the good principle, but also of the positive faculties in which it became participant through the formation of its primal material. Seen from the viewpoint of the demonology, the Platonic doctrine of the harmonius connection of the formed matter loses much if not all of its optimistic aspect. The confusion of the original chaos was not confined by the shaping of the cosmos, but continued to pro-pagateי itself, unhindered; and. on earth, a power of equal strenght worked in opposition of the divine. This practical depreciation of the distinction between primal matter and material world gave the Chal-dsans freedom for unrestrained expression of their hostility to all things called hylic.

In the community of this endeavour is*reflected a tendency of significance for the general history of religion : the Orient, after it has won the masses by the mystery-religions, sets out to bring over into its camp the educated also. It prepares itself for this task by association of its fundamental religious ideas with the theological elements of Greek philosophy. However, this mixture could not be accomplished without reciprocal modification of the Oriental religions by the action of the Hellenistic ideas. These manifest their immense vitality in many instances and assimilate or disintegrate the Oriental substance. The Orientalizing of Hellenic speculations runs parallel with the Hellenizing of Oriental religious doctrines, or, in per-sonal terms, the preachers of the sacred traditions of the East succumb ° ^he intellectual power of Greek theory and become the mouthpieces ^ ,ts fashion of thought and speech.

Therefore, if the inquiry as to the Oriental elements of the Chal-daian theology turn out in fact to be materially shorter than that on the philosophic motifs, the reason for this is not be sought in the lesser intensity of their influence. The limitation is rather imposed upon us by the paucity of our knowledge concerning the forms of Eastern religions to which the Chaldaeans were attached. We do dispose (thanks, above all, to the masterly studies of Cumont) of a concrete view of their general tendencies and even of a detailed knowledge of some of their principal creations, such as Mithraism as well as sun—and star—worship 1; but there are lacking not only the fixed details which would determine the various phases of their inner development, but 1 Tbe following works of Cumont will be frequently referred to in this chapter: β) Textes et monuments figures relatifs aux mysteres de Mithra (Μ.

Platonism was transmitted to the Chaldaeans by a school-tradition fixed in literary form and could therefore be dissected out of their Oracles by means of exact comparison with the preserved texts of this literary group. The religious beliefs of the Chaldsans, on the contrary, do not derive from a tradition fixed in book-form, but from the living creed of their Eastern home. The theology of these cults underwent, precisely in the second century A. D., a profound modification which could not attain expression in the ritual. The inquiry must therefore keep in mind also the religious ideas which developed apart from the liturgy and dogma. Similarity in this ideological sphere has the same right as that in tbe outer forms of the cult to be interpreted as sign of a com-mon origin. We shall see that it was precisely the speculations of Oriental priests which made possible the transition of the Chaldaean theurgists to Platonism and thereby gave them the right to call their system by the name of their Oriental home. 2. Aion. The question as to the relation of the Chaldaeans to the religion of Iran, which was already discussed in the chapter on demono-10gy> presents itself again in the treatment of their doctrine of Aion ׳-־. Here also the \"mythical\" substance is enveloped in a thick husk of philosophical notions. For the Aion of the Chaldaeans is not only u divinity, but also a noetic hypostasis. As such he comes, for the Pla-tonists, into relation with the idea of eternity which, according to the atcount of the Timaeus (37 c), was created by the demiurge as 1ץ model of time.

Ahura Mazda has many traits in com mon with the Supreme God of the Chaldsans. He is enthroned aho the heavens in a region of endless light; he creates, at first, Infinite Time, and, with the help of his Reason, the essence of the gods; and he is surrounded with potencies which, as to their nature, closely resemble archangels. These concepts of the Mazdaean belief concern-ing the Supreme Being were spread through the Greek world of the second century A. D. by means of various pseudepigrapha, composed by Oriental Hellenists and attributed to Zoroaster himself or to one 0( his later successors, the legendary founder of magic, Ostanes. In one of the chief works of this sort, the supreme, invisible God, surrounded by archangels, is contrasted with the earthly demons, the \"enemies of humanity\" -H.. There is reason to suppose that, as the demonology, so also the Chaldsan angelology goes back, in the last instance, to Iranian origins, of which traces have not been made fully unrecogni-zable even by the Judaizing transformation29. If the Mazdsan groundwork be still recognizable in the Chaldeans notion of the Supreme God, yet, on the other hand, the peculiar posi-tion which they assign to the god Aion ofTers proof of the penetration of Zervanism.

The Solar Theology.—In the Chaldaean system are found clear traces of another theology of the Near East which associated itself with Zoroastrism and which helps us to definite more closely the racial and intellectual descent of the authors of the Chaldaean Oracles : it is the solar religion. The sun takes, in the religious thought of the Chal-dsans, a place immediately following that of the supermundane gods. Its worship is founded on a highly developed physical cosmology 33. The sun forms the heart of the world, holds together the planets by means of its beams, and rules over the harmony of the etherial world. Its light derives from Aion, who governs it; its power, which generates Bundakishn, ch. 1, p. 1, Justi, according to the interpretation of H. S.

This solar theology went through, with the general change of religious consciousness, from pantheism to trans-ndentalism. Above the ruler of the planets was exalted a super-elestial divinity removed from this world, whom the sun served and from whom he, the formerly source of all cosmic and human intelligence, received his spiritual light38.

A similar place is also giVe to the sun in the system of the Chaldaean theurgists. They subordinate the ruler of the planetary world to a supramundane deity which makes its noetic light to stream into its subordinate, thereby transforming the letter's ravs also to noetic light. In the system of the Chaldaeans Aion is inserted between the Supreme Being and the sun. Thereby the formerly ruler of the universe is moved back one step further. This modification is most probably to be explai-ned by a synthesis of Iranian and Syrian religious elements. Ahura Mazda and Aion, the two supreme gods of Iran, are exalted over the intamundane sun-god of the Syrians and degrade him to be their ser-vant. At the same time, the supreme divinity of the Persian religion fuses with the supracelestial god of the transcendental Syrian theology and assumes his character41. But also the Iranian Aion changes his nature. He is described in the Chaldaean Oracles as a \"fiery god\" who travels his spiral route in the noetic region, \"rushing\"42. He has both the sound and the ecliptic route in common with the planets'13. The entire empvrean, which he, as the Oracles explain, \"leads round in a circle\", is affected by his movement'14. Consequently, as Aion is represented in the Oracles as the model of the planetary god, so is the noetic zone as the model of the planetary spheres. This view of Aion, as can be clearly recognized, has arisen through the projection of astral \" Corp.

The principal action of their initiation into immortality was the journey of the soul through the heavens (άναγωγη) 4r>. This ascent formed the content of the holy practices of many Oriental mystery cults of this period. It was celebrated in its most nearly .complete form in the mystery of the Mithraists 47. Their initiation consisted of the mimic representation of the descent of the soul from the region of its divine origin, and its reascent after severance from the body. The neophyte had to pass, first downwards and then upwards, through the seven doors—which symbolized the six planetary spheres and the sphere of the fixed stars—of a ladder graphically represented in the sanctuary; and he had finally to enter through the \"eighth door\" into the supra-mundane elysium. This belief in the descent and ascent of the soul through the spheres is, as Cumont and Bousset have shown, a creation of the late Babylonian astral religion, as transformed by Hellenistic \" The supposed infliicncc of Middle Platonic theorems concerning the movement of Aion (see n. 9) could not explain the origin of this belief, but only its theoretic formulation. \" On what follows, see WENDLWD'S summary (Hellenislisch-romisehe Kultur, etc.,1 1®1917° י ff·), based on the researches of BOUSSET, Die Himmelsreise der Seek, A\\r\\ ^' Rel''IV' 1901' 160 ff,; Goett' GeL Anz׳׳°7  1905׳ ד A·; !ט™!״!, Mhnuliturgie, 179 IT.; CIMONT, Rel.

In the mysterv of the Chaldsans itself, however, not the whole history of the soul but only its \"return\" was represented, and this also, not to its supra-mundane termination, but only up to the eun of which the noetic light directed by Aion, completed its purification. The solar theology deter-minates the extent and meaning of the journey through the heavens acted out during the Chaldsan mystery. On the other hand, the gene-ral descriptions of the journey of the soul given in the Chaldsan Oracles agree with those of the Mithraists. Their \"ladder with seven doors\" corresponds to the \"sevenfold ladder\" which the Theurgist had to climb 50. Whether the Oracles use this figure only as a metapho-rical description of an intellectual ascent to the apprehension of the noetic world, or whether they refer thereby to a specific practice in the celebration of the mystery, which was acted out apart from the \"ele-vation\" to the sun, can no longer be known.

As to the origin of the concepts which appear in this magical papyrus, opinions differ, and in fact, it is impossible to trace such a product of contamination to a single source5'1. The agreement with the views of the Chaldeans, which already struck Bousset and Dieterich (who were yet without knowledge of the existence of a Chaldaean mystery of immortality 55) proves that the beliefs mentioned derive from Syro-Iranian religious circles56. of a supreme Mithraic sacrament similar to the Chaldaean one whose existence is supposed in the text.

The notion that the soul descending from heaven takes on the characteristics of the planetary spheres through which it passes, before it enters into corporal existence, and that after death it makes its journey through the heavens in reverse direction and with opposite effect—this derives from the same religious circles as those in which the doctrine of the voyage of the soul through the spheres had developed : the later Babylonian astral theology58. Jt was widespread and, through association with other systems, assumed diverse forms. It appears again in the mysteries of the Chaldean theurgists, with, however, material variations.

A further divergence consists of the fact that the Chaldaeans replace the astral degrees of the ascent by phv-sical (air and ether) and retain only two of the planetary (moon and sun).

They determinedly contested the independent influ-ence of the stars on human life; for them the stars are simple executors of the divine Will, \"to Whose nod all is subjected\"63. Thus their relationship to the stars is not conditioned by any fundamental pre-judice, and is, even in part, outspokenly positive. Whereas, accor-ding to the view of the representatives of astral fatalism, the rulers of the spheres (the \"Archons\") had to be compelled by magical formulae to give the ascending soul free passage, in the Chaldaean mysteries, on the contrary, the sun and moon function as \"Rulers of the initiation\", who assist the ascent of the soul when invoked. In this positive atti-tude of the gods of the stars appears the principal difference between Chaldaean theurgy and Gnosticism.

Now, as against this, the Theurgists promise the souls of their neophytes no solar, but a supramundane paradise '\". Thus the ascent of the soul in the course of the mystery does not perfectly correspond with her final return after her separation from the body. Thence it follows that two dis-tinct views of the domicile of the released souls are mingled in the Chal-dsan eschatology. This fusion may be explained on the basis of the historical development of the Syrian religion, which was described above in its general characteristics. The enthronement of a supramundane god who degraded the sun to the position of a servant power brought about the translation of elysium into the supramundane sphere. The solar goal, indeed, maintained itself in the mystery, yet the original notion of the ascent to heaven as there acted out was replaced by another interpretation. As goal of the ascent the Chaldtean Oracles put the purification of the soul; the sunlight eradicates the material influences which had stained the soul during its earthly existence, and restores it to its pure, primal condition. This account derives also from Oriental Solar theology. The author of the Hermetic tract cited above, whose view as to the world-dominion of the sun derives from the same milieu as that of the Theurgists, explains that the soul of the mortal which is met by the noetic ray of this ruler of the planets is protected against demonic persecution71. This spiritual doctrine is associated in the system of the Chaldaeans with their fundamental concept of the nature of the mystery as a continually progressive lustration of the soul. The elevation to the sun is thereby made the last stage of the ritual °f purification. It is transformed from an eschatological to a cathartic act72.

The Oracles explain that il \"is borne aloft by the beams of the air, of the moon and of the sun\" 77, i. e. that, on magical appeal, special guides of the soul were sent forth from all three stations. In a fragment of a Chaldaean hymn, after ether, the sun and moon the \"guides of the air\" are mentioned \"H; these last, accordingly, undertake the transport for the first stage.

The basic belief of the dominion of supramundane potencies over the powers within the world demanded the exaltation of a metaphysical potency above the siderial world-rulers. To this tendency Aion owed his installation as chief of the \"Rulers of the initiation\" 84.

Roman contingents of this kind were levied in Syria. Mithra was represented as a mounted archer (sec F. SAXL, Mithras, Berlin, 1931, 77), and the first apocalyptic rider \"with a bow\" (Rev.

The luminous apparitions of the gods and spirits were explained as the outflows of the one primal Light which propagates them in order to enter into contact with the mortal by their means This identification had as consequence the comprehension of these gods and spirits as a single, unified organization subordinated to the will of the Supreme Being. The metaphysical henotheism served the Chal-dsans not only for the explanation of the origin, nature, and powers of the spirits, but also for the determination of their rank. When we turn from the inquiry as to the origin of the elements from which the Chaldsan system was composed, to the question of the motives of their composition, it is clear, that in determining the factors of this fusion both the disposition of its subjects and the character of the con-nected objects must be taken into account. The cooperation of these two efficients appears significantly in a closer study of the course of the intellectual development of the Chaldsans, as it is seen on the grounds of the foregoing analysis. It can be recognized that the transition from the beliefs of their Oriental home-land to Platonic philosophy conformed to a general process which gave to their individual decision the character of a necessary progress. The Solar religion of Syria had given rise to a theology in which substantial components of hellenistic speculation had found acceptance. The Theurgists thus learnt to know Solar religion of their native land in theoretical form and were already directed towards Greek philosophy by the tradition of their Eastern environment. This Syrian religion had gone through profound changes since its first encounter with Western speculation. The general tur-ning from an intramundane to a supramundane concept of God, which was accomplished in the religious consciousness of the period, took the form, in Syrian religious circles, of the enthronment of an omni-potent divinity of the heavens to whom the sun was subordinated, an of the increased readiness to accept dualistic elements of Iranian re 1 gion.

The development of the. religious ideas of their Oriental environment had therefore made the Theurgists virtual Platonists even before they went to school to the Platonic scholarchs. With full awa-reness of this affinity they carried through the unition of their Oriental priestly wisdom with Western philosophical speculation. Plato lent them the forms of expression with which to secure to the faiths of their native land a place among the theological systems of the Hellenistic-Roman world. Several points of convergence which presented opportunities for the fusion of the Middle-Platonic metaphysics with the Oriental religious doctrines transmitted to the Theurgists, have already been remarked : the concept of Destiny (t. e. the doctrine of the Cosmic Soul), the deino-nology (to which, according to Platonic view, angelology also apper-tained), and the metaphysical and anthropological dualism. The reli-gious dualism of the Persian religion was already cited by the earliest Platonists as a confirmation of the dualistic tendencies in the meta-physics of Plato 114. As the Platonists discovered in the Iranian theo-logy one of the basic views of their own theology, so the Chaldeans in the \"Mazdaizing\" theology of their native religion, could find the leading thoughts of Plato. There they met also with the essential traits of their doctrine of the fate of the human soul. The Platonic account of the divine origin of the soul, its descent into corporeal exis-tence, and its seduction, its severance from all things earthly and its redeeming ascent to the vision of Pure Being (an ascent which was cal-led, by the Platonists also, άν&γωγtf) and its final return to its super-mundane place of origin : all this must have seemed to the Chaldeans as the equivalent of their Oriental \"myth of the soul\". In this asso-ciation, also, the Platonists of their time hade made advances to them. Both Celsus and Numenius explain the Platonic eschatology on the basis See ch. vi, n. 383.

It is not impossible that attempted identi fications of the same sort, made by contemporary Platonists, showed the Chaldsans the way to the harmonization of their indigenous with the Platonic doctrine of the soul. Three further relationships of general nature between Platonism and the Oriental faiths of the Theurgists are here to be regarded spe-cially, since they make particularly clear the convergences of the two systems. The first concerns the religious tendency of Middle-Platonic philosophy. It had, under the dominant influence of the transcenden-tal mood, fully expanded the religious capacity of its metaphysics and assumed the character of a creed of salvation. Plato had fixed as the task assigned to human effort, the cleansing and the freeing of the soul from all things not divine (the \"striving for death\"); as its way the ascent to the vision of the primal divine Light; and as its fare the return to the divine place of origin. The Chaldean mysteries guaranted the fulfilment of these teachings. The Platonic ideas had taken the form of divine powers, which interfered, to awaken and to deliver, in dar-kened lives of men which were ruled by the prevailing force of the mate-rial. The Chaldsan gods and spirits fulfilled the same mission of sal-vation. The Platonists honoured a single, otherworldly, absolute being from which sprang and to which were subordinated all other divine beings. The Oriental theology, transmitted to the Theurgists, proclai-med the belief in an all-encompassing, all powerful deux exsuperantis-simus enthroned high above the stars, to whom the mundane gods as angels served 1,6.

The knowledge of tbe noetic is therefore the achievement of immorta-lization, for the sacramental operation of the mystery cumulates in an act of contemplation.

But all objective convergencies, viz. subjective associations, had not been sufficient, had not Platonism developed from itself the dis-position of a magical concept of god and the world, which first made possible the association with a magico-religious system. Plato himself had opened the door for this development by means of his doctrine concerning the nature of the demonic. The demons, thus Diotima explains to Socrates (Conv. a09 d 13 fT.), form the bond between god and man, inasmuch as they convey and take across to the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the commands and replies of the gods; by their mediation are accomplished also prophecy, mysteries and magic. This beginning was systematized by early Pla-tonists who made the demons partial powers of the Cosmic Soul But this demonological speculation expanded its full strength only in the second century A.

According to Ploti-nus127 the Cosmic Soul pervades the universe as a living organism and brings it about that the parts of the world work together as the parts of a body. This sympathetic connection of the \"members\" of the cosmic organism shows itself in the course of the stars, in the activity of the demons, in prophecy, in magic and also in the efficacity of prayer, which of itself progresses towards its goal by virtue of the natural con-nection of all psychic powers contained in the universe 128. While Plotinus traced back the magical coherence of the parts of the world to a cosmic organ of sensations, the Chaldaeans referred it to the supramundane Intelligence itself. Unfortunately, the Oracles which treat this central theme of Chaldsan theurgy are no longer preserved, so that we must reconstruct the theories concerned by means of the combination of sparse allusions contained in the tradition.

With this conclusion agree the state ments of other fragments of the Oracles : that the soul by nature pos sesses the knowledge of the \"symbols\", forgets them at its incarnation but is enabled by purification through the consecration of the mysteries to recall them and with their help to \"know the noetic\"וב1 . This view of the primal magical disposition of the soul rests, as can easilv be recognized, on a magical interpretation of the Platonic doctrine of the soul. The Chaldaeans put the \"symbols\" in place of the Ideas which the soul had beheld in its earlier existence 132. Thence follows a further argument for the assignment of the \"symbols\" to the class of the ideas. Finally, this assignment is confirmed by the result of the analysis of the Chaldeean view of the lynges lsa. These magical beings, which maintain the communication between the Supreme God and the Theurgists, are called in the Oracles, \"Powers of the Father\", i. e. Ideas, \"Transmitters\" of His commandments, i. e. angels, \"Un-speakable names\", t. e. magical formulae, and on the other hand spirits of the spheres which hold the planets in their courses. The \"symbols\" of the Chaldaeans are therefore identical with the spiritual powers which See ch. III, n. 55. 111 Sec ch. in, n. 56. Iamblichus interprets these Chaldeean ״symbols\" as referring to a natural faculty pervading all the portions of the universe and attaching them to the First Being.

The views of the Chaldeans on the cosmic power of the magical names of gods derive from the speculation of the magicians as to the origin and nature of the magical formulae. These were identified by them with the \"Secret Name\" through which the Supreme God rules the world 135.

This compound of beliefs incorporated into the body of Neoplatonic thought continued, under the surface of the official orthodoxy, to exist through the Middle Ages.

The general contents and the tendency of this work have been charac terized by BIDEZ, Vie de Porphyre, p. 88-97. Porphyry composed it after he had become Plotinus' pupil. This is shown by the differen tiation made by him between the first and second noetic principles (πατήρ and voDs) \",a distinction contested by Porphyry's former tea-cher Longinus 1'2. Porphyry expounds in this work the teachings of Plotinus also as regards other questions. He declares that only the intellectual apprehension of the divine enables the soul to be released, after its separation from the body, from the circle of births and to return to its noetic origin״ . Accordingly he refuses to admit the Chaldaean claim that this highest grade of immortality can be achieved by the theurgical consecration. Since this initiation purifies only the irra-tional part of the human soul 1/1, it effects only the ascent of tbe disem-bodied soul to the astral gods \"־', but not to the Supreme Being who dwells in the noetic zone. As the sojourn of the souls in the domain of the astral gods (as temporary companions of the angels assigned to these gods) forms only an interlude before a new incarnation lfi, the Chaldaean sacrament does not conduct to the highest goal. Thus, theurgy is useful merely to those who are unable to lead a philosophical life. It is they who are bidden to seek initiation into the Chaldsan sacrament17.

What we have said shows that Porphyry's work on the psychology of the Chaldsans belongs to the group of polemic treatises, by which Plotinus and his pupils tried to defend the supremacy of Plato's \"true philosophy\" against the aspirations of religious sects, especially of the Christians and Gnostics (see PORPH., Vit. Plot., 16). It seems pro-bable that it was for reasons of actuality that Porphyry composed this work, but tradition does not give us any insight into the personal side of his activity.

Porphyry ac knowledges freely the divine souree of the revelations written down in the Chaldean Oracles and declares only that they are intended for another public than the elite of the \"true philosophers1'. In various particular questions he agrees with the Chaldean Oracles and quoted them in corroboration of his own doctrines.

Likewise, he appeals to the Chal-dean Oracles in order to refute the doctrine proposed by the Plato-nist Atticus as to the eternity of matter '2'2. This method of consecra-ting metaphysical axioms by divine revelations was employed by Por-phvry already in his \"Philosophy of the Oracles\"23.

The Oracles declared that \"Not the sun and the moon, but the three Rulers purify\"24. We have shown that in their terminology these ״three Rulers\" (άρχαί) signify Aion, the sun and the moon.

This aporia can be solved, if we consider the later exegesis of the Chaldaean Oracles as well as Plotinian formulas which were apparently unknown to Augus-tine.

Porphyry's explanation of the triad \"Faith-Truth—Love\", the original meaning of which has been explained in the same section of the second chapter, rests likewise on a Platonic reinterpretation of a Chaldean doctrine. Hence it follows that Porphyry was not only the first Platonist who introduced the Chaldean Oracles to the Plotinian school and quoted their verses for sanctifying the axioms of the Neo-platonic ontology, but also the first who, by a radical reinterpretation, harmonized the teachings of the Chaldeans with the major principles of Neoplatonism.

The creation of the world is depicted after the pattern of a theogonyr>. Platonic notions are not infrequently replaced by epic equivalents\". Apart from Homer the Chaldaeans imitated—although to a much smaller extent—the style of the Greek philosophical didactical poems of earlier times ׳. Further, they show the influence of contemporary religious poetry, but we know too little of this type in order to fix the extent of their dependence8. The respective models have been quoted in the course of the investigation loc.

It seems therefore that the explanation adopted h Psellus is based upon the Neoplatonic view of the deification effected by the contemplation of the true Being7. The difference between philosophy and theurgy is explained by IAM BLICHUS, De Mytt., II 11. He states that it is not mere thinking which unites the theurgist with the god, for if it were so the philosopher would possess the means of a theurgical communication with the divine. opposed to them the theurgist achieves his goal through the correct ritual performance of certain magical actions (fyya), which may not be intelligible to the officiant, but whose significance is known to the gods who react in accordance with their own cognitions. The purity of soul and body are merely cooperative agents (συναίτιa) to the theurgical union. The divine volition is set in motion by the divine \"symbols\" (1. e. the magical formulae). Therefore the \"active union\" (»1 $ραστιχ!) ϋνωσιή is carried through not without thinking, but is not identical with the latter8. According to this theory, theurgy and philosophy are two different methods aiming at the same goal, the union with the gods. lam-blichus (who is followed by Proclus) uses, however, the term \"theurgy\" also in another, metaphysical, sense : human intelligence is unable to perceive the supreme God in His perfect nature; its strength suffices for the vision of the Ideas in their plurality, but not for their source, the undivided unity of the νοψτόν. This higher goal can be reached only with a superior organ of apperception, the \"flower of intellect\" (άνθοί νοϋ). Yet this apperception is no longer a process of intellection, but the result of a supra-rational state identical with the \"divine frenzy of Plato9.

It follows that the notion \"theurgy\" designates in the writings of the later Neoplatonists both a \"practical\" method of union with the gods (Spxaltxil ίνωσκ) and the supra-rational union with the highest order of the divine attainable to a human being. The source of this ambiguity is, as we have shown, to be sought in the Chaldean Oracles themselves which describe the ritual of the \"Elevation'1 by intellectual terms.

The teachings of this work are a free combination of Neoplatonic, Chaldsan and Her-metic doctrines.

With the transition into the magical sphere the meaning of the term changed : the invocation becomes an evocation a.

His source of information was the latter's commentary on the Chaldean Oracles, and as this work has not been preserved, Psellus' quotations serve us as main aid for the recon-struction of Proclus' exegesis and of the Chaldean texts treated by him there. The question of the relationship between Psellus, Proclus and the Chaldeans has been fully dealt with in two magnificent studies of J. BIDEZ, (Catal. des manuscrits alch. grecs, VI, Michel Psellus, Bruxelles 1998. Melanges Cumont, Bruxelles, 1936, p. 85-100). Bidez has published there many precious Inedila Pselliana and considerably enlar-ged the material concerning Chaldean theurgy. As we are less inte-rested here in Psellus than in the Chaldean documents transmitted by him, a short survey of the relevant works in which he mentions Chaldeans teachings may be sufficient. 1. Three works of Psellus deal exclusively with the doctrine of the Chaldeans : a) Ξήγησα των Χβλίαιχών βητΰν = Comm.

This fact accounts, as again Kroll, p. 4 notes, for the alterations undergone by several of these quotations. There are passages in which Psellus cor rected the beginning of an oracular verse transmitted to him by Proclus in an incomplete form in order to produce syntactic unity: cf. the quo-tations adduced ch. 11. 11. 24g ; 955 ; 998 : ch. 111, n. 88 ; 144. In tw0 cases, Psellus mistook a Proclean passage for a quotation from the Ora-fles : (1) Comm.. 1195 D the pseudo-Oracle μή έζόίξης, iW μ() £ξ,׳η ίχουσά τι derives from Plotinus (quoted by Psellus himself) I. q 0ύκ έζάξείί, ϊνα μή έξι η · έξελεύσεται γάρ ίχουσα τι, etc. (cf.

See also BREHIEH, Plotin, Enneades. vol. I, p. 131 f. Psellus' error mav be explained by the assumption that Proclus. his source, referred in this passage to the doctrine of the S•εολόγοι, whereby he did not mean the Chaldsans. but the Orphics (cf. Fragm. Orphic., 7, p. 84 Kern): see Excursus I d. (9) Comm. 1 139 Β (see below, ch. v, n. 133) the relative clause ύφ׳ f)v ό τήs άναίγκιjs 3•pivos derives from PLATO, Rep.. 69 1 a, 1. Kroll 63. who mentions this point, does not draw the obvious conclusion that this prose addition is no part of the quoted Oracle, but an interpretation appended by Proclus. This work is the source of Pletho's commentary on the μαγικά λόγια of Zoroaster (the name attributed by Pletho to the Chaldsan Oracles). This is the opinion of KROLL. p. 9, 9, but it was contested by BIDEZ-CUMONT. Mages hell.

That"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"475 PSELLUS AND THE tiftALD.EANS this is the true reason for Pletho's better text can be proved by several arguments : 1) Pletho does not quote any other fragment of the Chaldaean Ora-files than those to be found in Psellus' έζήγησιβ. 9) The readings of Pletho's quotations from the Chaldaean Oracles frequently concord with those of one of the eodd. deteriores of Psellus (Vattcanm gr. 0ך§. s XV, = v.) 3) Analogous attempts to complete and to correct the mutilated quotations from the Chaldsan Oracles transmitted by Psellus are to be found also in other passages of Pletho's treatise, but they are much less successful and sometimes even so faulty that they exclude the possibility of his having used another better source. We shall quote two examples : (1) the oracular fragment quoted below ch. v. n. 133 reads in Pletho's version (n° 2, according to the reprint of Opsopens' edition in MIGNE, P. G. CXXII, p. 1 1 1 5 f.) « μηδέ κάτω νεΰση;י κρημνοί χατά γήί υπόκειται έπταπόρου σύρων κατά βαθμίδα, ην ύπο δεινήί άνάγχηί ( ) 5-ρόνθί ε'σΊί». The emendator tries at vain to force the Platonistic expression (see above) into the metrical form. (2) the fragment quoted ch. III, n. 45 reads in Pletho's version (n° 1) : δίζεο ( σύ) ψυχής υχετόν, 'όθεν ή τινι τάξει σώματι Β-ητεύσαί επ\\ τάξιν (άφ' ifc ερρύη!)

Plato introduced the notion, as he explains Rep., 59 1c, with regard to mythical tales on the \"ascent\" of chosen mortals from the Hades to the light (e. g. of Sisyphus, cf. THEOCMS 703. SOPHOCI,., Philoct. 449, 69 5. See also AESCH., Agam., 1093. The lifting up of Semele by her son Dionysus from the Hades to the Olvmp was enacted in the Dionysiac mysteries and called άναγωγή Σεμέλη!; cf. DiETEnic.H, Nekyia, 111, 3. W. F. Otto, Dionysos, 65). These legends formed the point of departure of Plato's simile on the cave-dweller. With this Platonic meaning the term άναγωγη' recurs in Plotinus' Enneads (where, similarly as in Plato, the verbs άνάγεσθαι—with a refle-xive, not passive meaning, as in the Chaldeean passages—, άνα€α!νειν, άνω ίρχεσθαι etc., alternate with each other): cf. I, 3, 1 f.; I, 6, 6 f.; III, 8, 1 0 ; IV, 9, A ; V. 1 ; 1 ; V, A, 1. V, 7, 1. In these passages (adduced, for the most part, in the useful index to Plotinus composed by BnimEii. Plotin, Enneades, VI 9, Paris, 1938, p. 197 ff.). the complements are έπι το •αρώτον, έπι το (or eis το) iv, έπι τό νοητόν. As the Plotinian άναγωγη is, by nature, an introversive process, Plotinus sometimes employs the expression άνάγειν or άνέρχεσθαι έφ׳ έαυτόν, \"to ascend to himself\" ; cf. e. g. I 6, 9. IV 7, 10.

Iamblichus. the originator of this identification, employs in his work \"On the Mys-teries\" the term άναγωγη sometimes in the Chaldean (cf. Myst., VIII, 8, ρ 971, 13 άναγωγο) 3־e01. . . διά τίνων ιερατικών άνόδων; see also V, 11, P. 9 14, 8 f.) and sometimes in the Platonic sense (Myst., X, 6, p. 999, 10קד •apos άλήθειαν τήν νοητήν άναγωγϊ). The same remark applies to Proclus. Cf. Excursus V 9. E. The Chaldeans borrowed the term άναγωγη very probably from the terminology concerning the apotheosis of heroized mortals. Cf. e. g. Theognis 1 347 (on Ganymedes). EUR., Bacch.., 989 Zeus eis δ' Ολυμπον βρέ<$0! (Dionysus) άνιίγαγεν Β-εών. ΧΕΝΟΡΗΟΝ, Conviv., VIII, 30 (on Ganymedes). LUCIAN, Hermotim. 7; 746 (on Hercules). JULIAN. IMP., Oral., IV 154 D (on Romulus) and VII 9 19 Β ff. (quoted ch. III, n. 167). Besides, the term was intended to recall the widespread idea of the soul's journey through the heavens, which was termed άνοδοs, άνά£ασis (cf. P. Mag., IV, 59g, quoted ch. III, n. 138), άναψορά (cf.

The present excursus purposes to elucidate this special problem. Porphyry deals in the beginning of the relevant section with the question of the principles according to which sacrifices to the superhuman beings should 1 See C1M0NT, Rel.

As the answer to this question depends, in his opi-nion, on a correct distinction of their various orders, he quotes for this reason the theological doctrines of some unnamed Platonists, which briefly summarized, run as follows : After the Supreme Being, the Cosmic Soul and the \"visible gods\" (i. e. the planets) there follow in the divine hierarchy the powers called \"demons\" by Plato. The com-mon view that these demons are beneficent to those who try to conci-liate them by prayers and sacrifices, but take vengeance if they are neglec-ted, is erroneous and has led to a falsification of religion. In truth, two different classes of demons have to be distinguished : both of them consist of souls which, issuing from the Cosmic Soul, are clothed, in the course of their descent through the planetary spheres, with air-like envelopes (πνεύματα) constituting the passions. Those souls whose reason rules over their passions, are the beneficent demons. These inhabit the upper layer of the aery zone which extends immediately below the moon. From there they watch over the plants and animals, provide both of them with favourable conditions of climate and tempe-rature and impart to men the arts, the knowledge of the general (\"ency-clic\") sciences, of medicine and of gymnastics. To this group of good demons belong also the heavenly messengers called \"ferrymen\" by Plato; they are the mediators between gods and men, carrying *over to the gods the prayers of men, and to men the exhortations and signs of the gods. These good demons are not capable of harming men. Other souls, however, who have been overpowered by the passions of their \"pneumatic\" envelopes, are maleficent potencies. They inhabit and rule the aery space adjoining the earth and are the originators of human misery : they cause epidemics and drought, arouse fatal desires, stir up wars and riots, and also spread the belief that their own evil deeds are effected by the good demons. They even dare to impute their crimes to the celestial powers. As they, and on the first place their chief, aspire to the highest place, they slander the Supreme God by asserting that it is he who turns all things upside down; whereas he, like the good demons, is in truth capable only of good deeds.

Porphyry proposes similar views on the nature and activity of the diverse classes of demons in his allegorical explanation of the Pla-tonic legend of Atlantis. Fragments of this explanation, which for-med the beginning of his «ommentary on Plato's Timaeus, are preserved in Proclus' commentary on the same work. The latter quotes several passages from Porphyry's exegesis and refers to it frequently without mentioning the name of his source2. According to Proclus' report, Porphyry explained the war of the prehistoric Athenians with the inha-bitants of the legendary island Atlantis as an allegory of the struggle between the \"souls which strive upwards\" (i. e. the good demons) and the hylic demons, who attempt to \"draw downwards\" the human souls on their way to a new incorporation3. According to Proclus' schematic summary, Porphyry distinguished three classes of demons : the \"divine ones\" whose celestial existence has suffered no change; the individual souls of the departed which for a certain time, until new descent, dwell in the realm of the \"divine demons\"; and the evil demons'1. The first two groups are represented by the Athenians; and the third one by the Atlantics.

We may now turn to the question of the sources employed by porphyry. In De abstinentia he designates their authors rather vagely as ״some Platonists\", whereas in his allegorical commentary on the legend of Atlantis, he calls them by name. He declares there that he has combined the views held by Numenius with those held by the Neo-platonist Origen23. As Proclus reproduces, though in a very concise form, the basic concepts of these two authors, we are able to determine more closely Porphyry's relationship to his two models. We mav begin with the study of the explanation of Numenius. Accor-ding to Proclus, he interpreted the war of the Athenians with the Atlan-tics as \"contrast between nobler souls fostered by Athene, and between other souls concerned with the world of generation which also 24 belong to the god who rules over the world of becoming\" (1. e. the sublunar zone) 2s.

We may e. It 1 s. 53 [1098]), which agree with certain arguments of his interpretation of the legend of Atlantis (cf. PROCL., Tim., I, 189, 4 f. 190, ao f., who depends on Porphyry).

We obtain in this way as principal motif of Numenius' explanation of the legend of Atlantis the antagonism between the souls turned towards reason and those turned towards the temporal world. This opposition agrees with Numenius' basic doctrine of two antagonistic human souls : a rational and a hylic one. We may consequently presume that Numenius explained the war between Athens and Atlantis as the struggle between the λογιχαϊ and the άλογοι ψυχα/ 29 and the victory of the former as the triumph of reason over the passions. This surmise is confirmed by a closer examination of Porphyry's explanations of this mythical war. He interprets it as tbe struggle between rational souls (t. e. demons) and the agents of the hylic passions30. Since Porphyry, according to his own explanation, draws on two sources and Origen's explanation is based (as we will see immediately) on another view, we may infer that Numenius was the source of Porphyry's psychological dualism. We may therefore assume that Numenius identified the Atlantics with the psychical passions, by which the irrational (hylic) soul is dominated. It follows from this supposition that Numenius ignored the difference between the two classes of demons31. Thus, this view stems from Origen, Porphyry's other source.

The literary tradition as regards Origen is indeed very scanty, but the few facts which are reported suffice to answer lhe question as to his share in Porphyry's exposition of demonology. Origen (who should not be confused with his namesake and contem-porary, the Christian ecclesiastical writer), the pupil of Ammonius Sac-cas. master of Longinus (who was Porphyry's first teacher) and co-student of Plotinus composed only two works (both of which are known only by their titles) : a polemical treatise against Plotinus, in which lie defended the traditional view of the Platonists as to the identity of the \"First God\" with the demiurge33: and a work \"Concerning the Demons\" 3'1. It seems certain that in the latter treatise Origen pro-pounded the explanation of the legend of Atlantis quoted by Porphyry in his commentary on Plato's Timaeus35. A reflexion of the doctrine set out by Origen in the former work may be discerned in the introduc-tory passage of the lengthy quotation from the doctrines of the unna-med Platonists figuring in Porphyry's De abstinentia. The author of this quotation distinguishes only between two noetic principles : the \"First God\" and the Cosmic Soul36.

Accordingly, he may be regarded as the source of the relevant passage quoted by Porphyry :18. The classification of the good demons presented by Porphyry in his De abstinentia may also be traced back to Origen. Porphyry distin-guishes there three classes : the guardians of the animals and plants who accord them favourable climatic conditions; the helpers of men who impart to them the knowledge of the encyclic sciences, of medi-cine, gymnastics etc.; and the Platonic messengers of the gods who carry over the prayers of the men and the exhortations of the gods:'9.

Two facts may be mentioned in favour of this contention : first that the differentiation of the diverse classes of demons made by Porphyry becomes fully understandable only by their reference to the particulars of Plato's story of Atlantis; and secondly that Porphyry's allegorical interpretation of the myth of Atlan-lis names some classes of demons which are not mentioned in De absii-nentia44.

Porphyry employs there the same desi-gnation twice in the paraphrase of the mentioned oracle7 and stresses the importance of the classification of the gods proposed in this oracle. Consequently, we may not only infer that Eusebius borrowed his \"Hel-lenic Theology\" from Porphyry's \"Philosophy of the Oracles\", but also that Porphyry had propounded this theology not long after having quoted the lengthy sacrificial oracle. In favour of this supposition may be added that the \"Hellenic Theology\" concludes with an instruction concerning sacrifying and that this topic constitutes the main theme of this part of Porphyry's \"Philosophy of the Oracles\". Moreover, the ascription of the \"Hellenic Theology\" to this work of Porphyry is ren-dered probable by the context in which it is found in the work of Euse-bius. A little before the excerpts from the \"Philosophy of the Oracles\" begin anew. Eusebius, whose knowledge of Greek literature was far from being so comprehensive as it would appear from the list of the authors quoted by him, has borrowed from Porphyry many quotations and references without mentioning the transmitter8. We may now proceed to study the sources of the beliefs expressed in the \"Hellenic Theology\". The division of the beneficent powers : Supreme God, astral gods, good demons and heros has evolved from a differentiation usual in the writings of the Platonists9.

The \"Hellene\" may have been remin ded of the Pythagorean opposition of God who is identified with Light and the Darkness of Matter \"׳; but this Pythagorean doctrine cannot be regarded as the origin of the division put forward in the \"Hellenic Theology' , as it rests on metaphysical principles and not on the oppo-sition between the good powers of heavens and the evil powers of the netherworld. Bidez and Cumont have already pointed out that this opposition concords with the Iranian antinomy of Light as the good principle and Darkness as the evil (demonic) principle 11. Accordingly, the \"Hellenic Theology\" consists of a combination of the Iranian anti-nomy with Plato's antithesis of the Ideas of Good and Evil and his division of the celestial hierarchy. Elsewhere Porphyry discovers, through his method of interpretation, an allusion to this Iranian an-tinomy in a passage of Plato's Theaetetus dealing with the ethical-re-ligious opposition between Good and Evil12—a further proof that he has to be considered as the author of the \"Hellenic* Theology\" quoted by Eusebius. י י See ZELLER, I, 1', p. 45G f.

Sitot arrive a l'lnstitut, le manuscrit anglais de Lewy fut envoye k la composition. Kraus n'etant plus 14 pour veiller au grain, les choses trainfcrent comme s'etire, languissante, l'eau du Nil. Puis il fallut compter avec les ev6nements du Proche-Orient, rendant impossibles et impensables toutes relations entre « voisins». Les amis de Lewy en Israel ne purent rien faire, ni pour relancer le travail ni pour corriger les epreuves. Ce n'est qu'en 1956 que les plombs furent enfin liberes. Mais la malchance poursuivit encore l'ouvrage. Entre autres consequences de l'equipee franco-anglaise sur le Canal, le livre de Lewy resta confin6 dans les cartons de l'lnstitut. Le black-out qui suivit la guerre empScha tout service de presse et la diffusion vers ]'Europe. Se procurer un exemplaire de l'ouvrage devint des lors un exploit de bibliophile.

Ober die Bedeutung dieser DMmonologie ftir die chaldaische Theodizee soli im folgenden Kapitel gesprochen werden Wir wenden uns jetzt der Frage nach der Bedeutung der Marterie fai• die praktische Theurgie zu. Da diese auf den Voraussetzungen der allgemeinen Magie beruht, empfiehlt es sich, die dort herrschenden Ansichten iiber dieses Thema kurz zu rekapitulieren. Denken und Handeln der Zauberer begrundet sich auf dem Axiom einer sympathetischen Wechselwirkung zwischen der sinnlichen Materie und dem ubersinnlichen Geisterreich. Viele der in den Stoffen lebenden und wirkenden Geister gehorten ubergeordneten Machten an, die jenen bestimmte Substanzen anvertrauten, um ihr AVirken in der sichtbaren Natur in Erscheinung treten zu lassen. Einige dieser Stoffe waren den oberen, andere den unterirdischen Gottern durch « Sympathie » zuge-eignet. Nicht jeder an einen Stoff gebundene Geist gait also als unrein. Ober seinen Charakter entschied nicht sein Aufenthaltsort, sondern das Wesen der Macht, unter deren Einfluss er stand. Diejenigen Stoffe, die im Sympathieverhaltnis zu den oberen Gottern standen, waren Trager guter und hilfreicher Geister, die den unteren Gottern zugeeigneten Mate-rien wirkten schadlich. Die « Weisheit» des Zauberers bestand in der Kenntnis dieser Stoffe, der in ihr wohnenden Geister und deren magischem Zusammenhang mit den sie beherrscbenden Machten sowie in der Kennt-nis der sympathetischen Mittel, durch die die guten Stoffgeister gewon-nen, bez. der antipathetischen Praktiken, durch die die bosen paralysiert wurden. Das Gesetz der magischen Sym- und Antipathie suspendierte den dualistischen Gegensatz zwischen Geist und Stoff und fiihrte zu einer Wertung der Materie, die der der platonisierenden Damonologen widersprach. In diesem Widerstreit zwischen damonistischer und magischer Bewer-tung der Materie nahmen die Theurgen eine eigenttlmliche Mittelstellung ein. Auch sie glaubten an die Moglichkeit einer magischen Bannung hylischer Damonen, verwarfen aber diese Beschworungen, da sie die an die Hyle gebundenen Geistermachte fur von Herkunft und Natur unrein erachteten, und beschuldigten die niederen Zauberer (die « Goeten »)> dass sie ihre Erfolge diesen schadlichen Gewalten verdankten. Nur durch die Not getrieben setzten sie sich zu diesen unreinen Geistern in Beziehung. Sie mussten den Einfluss dieser hylischen Machte paralysieren, um von jenen nicht an der Kommunikation mit den reinen Himmelsmachten gehindert zu werden. Wahrend die Goeten also ihre magischen Fahigkeiten benutzten, um sich die hylischen Damonen dienstbar zu machen, bemiin-ten sich die Theurgen, deren Gegenwirkung auszuschalten. Ihre Heifer waren die Gotter und die von ihnen abhangigen Geisterordnungen. Dem Pandamonium der materiellen Welt stellten sie ein Pantheon der vom hochsten Prinzip ausgehenden reinen Himmelsmachte entgegen, a deren auserwahlte Diener sie sich betrachteten. Die Theurgen erst1'®?'1® die Oberwindung des Damonischen durch die Macht des Gottlicne · Dass dieses Gottliche dazu erst instandgesetzt wurde, nachdem es Eigenschaften des Damonischen angenommen hatte, 1st eine religio geschichtliche Erkenntnis, die das Bewusstsein der Chaldaer nicht rea!"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"637 ADDENDA sieren konnte, da ihr magischer Weltbegriff keinen Unterschied zwischen Geist und Kraft kannte. Diese « Hypophobie » der Theurgen scheint im Widerspruch zu ihrem Ritual zu stehen. Wahrend der magischen Operation, die die Verpflichtung eines « Hilfsgeistes» bezweckte, wurden u. a. auch die « Herren der Mate-rien > (d. h. der geweihten Pflanzen und Steine) angerufen. Aber in dem gleichen Hymnus werden auch Apoll und der «Zeitherrscher»beschworen, und hinter der letzten Bezeichnung verbirgt sich der hochste Gott der Chaldaer. Also standen die « Herren der Materienמ unter dem Einfluss einer oberen Gottheit, die ihre Kraft band und ihren Charakter bestimmte. Ahnlich sind auch die Riten der anderen uns iiberlieferten «hylischen Weihen » zu verstehen. Nur diejenlgen Stoffe, die in einem Sympathie-verhSltnis zu den oberen MSchten standen, gehorten der hoheren Ordnung an und waren gegen die depravierende Wirkung des Hylischen gefeit. Mit ihrer Hilfe bekampften die Theurgen den Einfluss der bosen Stoffdamonen und durchbrachen den Ring, den die Materie und ihre damonischen Trabanten um sie geschmiedet hatten. p. 423 η 82, 5 — ajouter 4 la fin de la note : Die Archonten der Sonnen- und Mondschei-be werden in der gnostischen Schrift Pistis Sophia erwahnt (Kap. 136).

R. DODDS1 [263] HANS LEWY'S posthumous book, the fruit of many years' devoted study, should arouse fresh interest in one of the most tantalizingly obscure of ancient Greek texts. The Chaldaean Oracles were a divine revelation in bad hexameter verse ; its authors were believed to be gods (speaking through the lips of entranced mediums ?), but it was given to the world, as Lobeck guessed and Bidez finally proved, by one \" Julia-nus the theurgist \", who lived under Marcus Aurelius. It is of serious concern to historians of religion, as the last important Sacred Book of pagan antiquity, and to historians of ideas, as one of the major influences which shaped the later development of Neoplatonism from Porphyry to Psellus. Unfortunately it has come down to us only in fragments. Verbatim quotations from it, totalling something like 300 lines, were collected in 1894 by Wilhelm Kroll ; and there exist in addition, scattered through the writings of Proclus, Damascius, Psellus and other Neopla-tonists, numerous reports of its teaching and of the magical rites practiced by its adepts. Some of the latter are cited by Kroll, and others have been brought to light subsequently, especially by Bidez,2 but they have not yet been systematically assembled.3 1. The Harvard.

R. DODDS 094 Lewy's book is the first really comprehensive examination of this material.4 It is the more to be regretted that his death [264] in 1945 prevented him from giving it the final revision which it obviously required, and that he was not there to see it through the press. For it cannot be said that he has been well served by his publishers and editors. Despite the unexplained delay of eleven years in its publication, it bears few marks of editorial care. Misprints abound everywhere,6 and the most obvious oversights stand uncorrected,® as does also the author's highly idiosyncratic English (he uses queer words like \" hypophet, ״ ״ goet, \" ״ hypertrophic ״ and ״ parodical ״). What is more serious is that a book which cries out for an index has been sent into the world with only the barest table of contents. The reader who wishes to consult the Greek text of a particular passage is dependent on a system of cross-references from one footnote to another ; and unfortunately many of the cross-references are wrong. These defects of presentation make the book harder to use than it should be ; but no student of later paganism can afford to neglect it on that account. It falls into two parts. Part I begins with a chapter which argues for the ascription to the Chaldaean Oracles of about 100 lines not hitherto recognized as belonging to it. The remaining chapters of this part present a synthetic account of \" Chaldaean \" doctrine, while in Part II the same material is handled analytically with a view to determining the sources of the system. This is no doubt a logical arrangement, though it means that every important fragment is discussed at least twice. But it has the disadvantage that the least secure part of Lewy's material — his alleged \" new fragments \" — is placed in the forefront and influences his treatment of the rest. I should have preferred to [265] see it placed last. For these \" new fragments \" differ from the old ones in that their ascription to the 4. Kroll confined himself to a brief though extremely valuable discus-sion in Latin. Individual aspects of the Oracles have been studied by Bidez (\" Note sur les mysteres nioplatoniciens, \" Rev. Beige de Phil, ct d'Hist., 7, 1928, 1477 ff.) ; by Hopfner in his Gr.-Aeg. Offenbarungs-zauber and elsewhere ; by Theiler (Die chald. Orakel u.d. Hymnen des Synesios, 1942) ; by Eitrem (« La Th^urgie chez les n60plat0niciens et dans les papyrus magiques \", Symb. Oslo., 22,1942, 49 ff.) ; by the present writer (\" Theurgy and its Relationship to Neoplatonism, \" J.R.S. 37, 1947, 55 ff., reprinted in The Greeks and the Irrational, 1951, 283 ff.) ; and by Festugifere, Riv. d'Hermis III, 1953, 52-59. It is unfortunate that only the two first-mentioned of these studies were available to Lewy. 5. False Greek words which may puzzle the reader include άγνβϊον for άγγείον (p. 265), φότιος for φόθιος (p. 277), σκυλίοισι for σκολίοισι (p. 303), κλίσεις for κλήσεις (p. 469). 6. E.g. \" second person \" for \" first person \" makes nonsense of an important passage on p. 6 ; φωτί is described as an ablative (p. 11) ! the 30 books of Iamblichus' commentary on the Oracles have become 3(J volumes \" (p. 68); on pages 10 and 88 the translation offered in the text conflicts with the explanation given in the footnote."},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"695 NEW LIGHT Chald. Or. rests on no ancient authority (for several of them a different and incompatible origin is in fact attested), but simply on their resemblance in diction and content to attested fragments. This is a type of argument which needs to be used with caution, since (a) there was a conventional \" oracle-style \" to which all soi-disant oracles may be expected up to a point to conform ; (b) the Chald. Or. belong, as Lewy himself points out (p. 312), to an age when the same religious tendencies were finding parallel expression in many different milieux, Stoic, Platonist, Hermetic, Gnostic or Orphic. And in fact the force of Lewy's argument seems to me to vary widely from case to case. His \" new fragments \" comprise (i) a group of doctrinal oracles which are included in the Christian collection of pagan oracles known as the Tiibingen Theosophia (edited by K. Buresch in his book Klaros, 1889) ; (ii) a group of ritual or magical oracles quoted by Eusebius from Porphy-ry's Philosophy of Oracles (edited by G. Wolff, Porphyrii de philosophia ex oraculis haurienda librorum reliquiae, 1856). According to Lewy, the two sources are reductible to one, since the first group were taken over by the Christian collector from Porphyry's book ; but of this proposition there is no proof, save for the two oracles, nos. 27 (plus 29) and 30, which the collector expressly calls Porphyrian.7 And in tact of all these \" new fragments ״ Theos. 27, a 19-line hymn to the Supreme God, is the one which agrees most closely in diction and content with the attested frag-ments of the Chald. Or. (the agreement was already noticed by Thilo and Wolff). If we are prepared to admit (against the opinion of Bidez) that Porphyry already knew the Chald. Or. when he composed his Philosophy of Oracles8 (as to which, see below), then we shall be strongly tempted to accept Theos. 27 as Chaldaic, though [266! Theos. 29, which the collector presents as a continuation of 27, may arouse some doubts.9 For most of the other oracles in his first group Lewy's case seems to me much weaker. And for the one which is most interesting doctrinally, the Aion-oracle (Theos. 13), I find it very weak indeed. According to the Theosophia, this oracle was delivered by Apollo in answer to one _ 7. Since Porphyry is quoted as source for two oracles only, the natural inference is that the remaining oracles do not come from Porphyry. 8. Acceptance of this view does not involve identifying the Philosophy of Oracles with the De regressu, as J. J. O'Meara has recently invited us to do. Lewy in fact follows the opinion of Eunapius, Bernays and Bidez that the Philosophy of Oracles is an early work from Porphyry's pre-Plotinian period : rightly, in my judgment (cf. Pierre Hadot in Rev. des Etudes Augustiniennes, 6, 1960, 205 ff.). 9. Theos. 29 introduces the notion of a bisexual Supreme God, which I cannot find explicitly attested for the Oracles ; and its description of this God as είδος, ψυχή and πνεΟμα is at least prima facie inconsistent With the Chaldaean transcendence-theology, though Lewy tries to recon-cile them.

DODDS 094 Theophilus, who asked him \" if he were God, or another \" ; according to Lactantius (who quotes part of it), it comes from the Apolline Oracle at Colophon (Claros). Lewy dismisses the latter attribution as \" certainly erroneous \" (p. 19, n. 46), but without sufficient reason.10 His own attribution to a \" Chaldaean \" Apollo involves serious difficulty. For the author of Theos. 13 Aion is surely the Supreme God,11 like the Iranian Zervan ; but the Chald. Or. placed Aion \" in the second rank of intel-ligibles ״, calling it ״ a light sprung from the Father. 12״ Further, if we are to believe Proclus,13 the personal Time-god whom the theurgists caused to appear in visible form, and who receives some of the epithets given to Aion in Theos. 13, was named not Aion but Chronos. Lewy suggests (p. 104) that Proclus may have substituted the name Chronos for Aion in order to avoid contradictions between the Oracles and the Timaeus ; but we find άκοιμήτου χρόνου, άπέραντον χρόνον, and χρόνου χρόνος in verbatim citations from the Oracles.14 To call Aion on this evidence \" the Chaldaean God par excellence \" (p. 158) is surely very rash. [267] For his second group of \" new fragments, \" the ritual oracles from Porphyry's book, Lewy makes in general15 a somewhat stronger case. He rightly interprets them as trance utterances, delivered in the first person by a \" god \" through a human medium,16 connects them with theurgic ritual practice, and calls attention to various points of agreement with known fragments of the Chald. Or. Was Bidez then mistaken in assuming that Porphyry had not yet \" discovered ״ the Chald. Or. when he wrote the Philosophy of Oracles ? Lydus, de mensibus 4.53, which Lewy quotes on p. 9, does not prove him mistaken : for Lydus' ΰπόμνημα τών λογίων may well represent, not the Philosophy of Oracles, 10. Cf. Picard, Ephfese et Claros, 715 ff. ; Nock, R.E.A., 30 (1928), 280 ff. ; Eitrem, Orakel u. Mysterien am Ausgang der Antike (Ziirich, 1947), 58 ff. According to Nilsson, \" the authenticity of this oracle is generally admitted, and can hardly be doubted \" (Gesch. d. gr. Rel. II. 458). 11. It is so understood by Wolff, Nock, Eitrem and Nilsson. Lines 3-4 yield little sense unless Aion is identical with the πατήρ μέγας (for we surely cannot, with L., make έαυτόν refer to Aion). The αΙών and αΙώνες of line 13 I take to be world-periods, whose sequence is governed by θεός αύτός, the Supreme God Aion : cf. P.G.M., xn. 246 ΑΙών αΙώνα τρέφων αΐώσιν άνάσσει. 12. Dam., Dub.

Their content as well as their metre seems to exclude the possibility of attaching them to the Chald.

It may seem odd, however, that an oracle-hunter so learned and diligent as Porphyry should have missed at this time a collection which had been in circulation for at least seventy years. On the other hand, none of Porphyry's oracles is quoted as\" Chaldaean \" by later Neoplatonists, and Lewy's argument from doctrinal agreement falls short of proof.17 On the whole it would seem prudent to continue to keep separate the three groups of oracles theosophical, Porphyrian, Chaldaean — rather than fuse parts of the first two with the third. We have seen in the notorious case of Posidonius how much harm can be done by treating as a \" fragment \" every passage which shows similarity to an attested fragment, and then using these \" new fragments \" as evidence from which to build up an enlarged synthetic picture. Lewy's long second chapter provides by far the most circumstantial [268] account of \" Chaldaean \" theology which has yet been produced. He has taken immense pains to dovetail together the smallest scraps of information that we possess, and to extract from them something which has at least the semblance of a coherent system. The task was no easy one: so vague and imprecise is the flowery verbiage in which the \" system\" is clothed that, as Nock once put it, \" it is very hard to be sure of the meaning of anything in the Oracles. \"18 Even after Lewy's work much remains doubtful. It is difficult to form a clear picture of the relation-ships between the various divine principles, of which the most important are the Father, the First or \" Paternal ״ Intellect, the Second Intellect which contains the Platonic Forms and creates the physical world, and the Cosmic Soul which is somehow equated with Hecate. In addition, a place and function have to be found for Chronos (and/or Aion), for Eros, for three World Rulers (κοσμαγοί or αρχικοί πατέρες), for a \" transmundane sun, \" for the planetary gods, and for entities called συνοχείς, ϊυγγες, etc. One cannot help suspecting that in the mind of the author or authors19 the hypostases of the philosophers and the gods 17. Lewy relies especially on the rar י use of the word δοχεύς tor \" me-dium \" (in place of the commoner κάτοχος), which he regards as a mark of \" Chaldaean \" origin. But can we be sure that it is in fact \" Chaldaean \"? It occurs in two of Eusebius׳ Porphvrian oracles, and in a trochaic (and surely therefore, pace L., non-Chaidaean) oracle quoted by Proc., in Remp. I. 111.28, probably from Porphvry ; but not, I think, in anv attested verbatim fragment of the Chald. Or. It is true that Proclus and other late Neoplatonists use it with reference to theurgv, but it remains possible that, like Eusebius (Prep. Ev. 3.16), they learned the term from Porphyry. 18. Gnomon, 12 (1936), 607, n. 3. 19. Lewy thinks (p. 36) that the Oracles were not a continuous didactic poem but (as the title Λόγια δι' έπών would suggest) a collection of sepa-rate oracles given on different occasions. And internal contradictions are certainly easier to account for on this view."},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"Ε. R. DODDS 094 and daemons of Greco-oriental cult are very incompletely fused. Chapter III deals with the descent and reascent of the human soul and with the rite of άναγωγή or άπαθανατισμός which Lewy considers \" the chief mystery of the Chaldaean sacramental community. ״ Details of the procedure are unhappily missing : in order to give the reader some picture of it (pp. 208 ff.) Lewy is compelled to draw on descriptions of parallel (?) rituals in Apuleius, Heliodorus and the great Paris magical papyrus. He thinks, no doubt rightly, that the symbolic burial mentio-ned by Proclus (Theol. Plat., 193.98) formed part of it : it was a ritual pre-enactment of death (p. 205).20 But I cannot agree with him when he goes on to connect the symbolic burial with the strange [269] assertion quoted by Psellus (Comm. in Or. Chald., 1141 Β) \" βΐη <δτι> σώμα λιπόντων \" ψυχαί καθαρώταται \" Those who have left the body by violence ״ cannot be equated with the Chaldaean initiates ;a1 they are surely the βιαιοθάνατοι, whom all ancient tradition represented as unquiet earthbound ghosts, and if so we must emend καθαρώταται to κατάρατοι (Kroll) or perhaps άκάθαρτοι. Chapters IV and V are concerned respectively with \" Chaldaean \" magic and \" Chaldaean \" demonology. On magic Lewy is a little disap-pointing ; this is not his main lield of interest, and he has overlooked the helpful analogy with modern spiritualism, which employs the same techniques with comparable results.22 But he is interesting and instruc-tive on demonology, particularly on the conception of Hades (pp. 279 ff.), not as the Underworld or its king, but as the evil \" lord of the terrestrial domain, \" corresponding to the Iranian Ahriman. He utilizes in this chapter (pp. 273 ff.) the demonology of de myst. 3. 31 (while admitting that not everything in that passage derives from the Oracles), and also the Aegyptius of Synesius. On the other hand, the much discussed demonology of Porph., de abst. 2. 37-43, which also posits a Prince of Darkness, is relegated to an appendix (Excursus XI), where from a comparison with Proclus, in Tim. I. 77.6. ff. Lewy argues that while its ultimate basis is Iranian its proximate source is the Περί δαιμόνων of the pagan Platonist Origenes.23 20. Not however, a symbolic suicide : I can find no warrant in the text for Lewy's statement that \" it is the initiate who at the bidding of the theurgists buries his own body \". 21. Cf. Olymp., in Phaed. 243.4, where ״ theurgic ״ death is distin-guished from death by suicide or violence. 22. Cf. The Greeks and the Irrational, 295 ff. Incidentally, I cannot accept Lewy's curious statement (pp. 253-254) that the soul of Plato became visible to the theurgist \" as a geometrical luminous figure . The geometrical χαρακτήρ was an evocative symbol, not a constituent part of an apparition. 23. Proclus, however, mentions two sources, Origenes and Numenius ; and Lewy's grounds for excluding the latter (of whom Zeller, Cumont and others had thought) are hardly decisive."},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"725 NEW LIGHT In the second part of his book Lewy investigates with great thorough-ness and wide learning the origins of the whole strange amalgam, distin-guishing ״ the Platonic elements \" (chap. VI) from \" the oriental ele-ments \" (chap. VII). The conclusion of chapter VI, that contemporary Platonism is \" the single source of the entire philosophical information \", seems to me to be [270] substantially24 correct. But second-century Platonism had many variant forms. Is it possible to be more precise ? Lewy looks for parallels (pp. 324 ff.) to the four divine hypostases of the Oracles, — the Father, the two Intellects, and the World Soul — and finds them (a) in the unnamed philosophers mentioned by Arnobius, adv. nat. 2. 25, (b) in the Gnostics criticized by Plotinus, Enn. 2.9.6. These do not take us much further ; as regards (b), Lewy holds firmly that similarities between \" Chaldaean \" and Gnostic doctrine are indica-tions, not of Gnostic influence as Kroll and Bidez thought, but of parallel and independent development from Platonic and Iranian premises (pp. 390 ff.). We can, however, add (c) Chalcidius,25 pp. 233.8 ff., who seems to draw here, as so often elsewhere, upon Numenius. And we have Numenius' own word for it that the recognized two Divine Intellects.26 Moreover, he announces his doctrine in a form which strikingly recalls the Oracles : while these say \" The Father entrusted all things to a Second Intellect, which all ye race of men call the First \" (Psellus, Comm. 1140), Numenius has \" It is as if Plato said ' Ye men, that Intellect ye guess at is not the First; prior to it is another Intellect, older and more di-vine י \" (fragm. 26). This can hardly be pure coincidence, and the hypothesis of a common source (Lewy, p. 320) does not help much unless we can identify it. There are a number of other points of agreement — most of them unmentioned in Lewy's book — between the Oracles and Numenius.27 In both systems the Supreme God, whom both call \" the Father \" and \" the monad \", is said to transcend all \" works \" (έργα, Oraclcs, p. 13 24. Provided the term \" Platonism \" is used in a wide enough sense to cover Numenius, whom antiquity on the whole preferred to call a Pythagorean. But Lewy is perhaps at times a trifle over-ingenious in identifying \" Chaldaean \" with Platonist doctrines. Thus I can see no close relationship between the fragment quoted p. 179, n. 8 (= Kroll, p. 26) and Plato, Tim. 41 d, or between the World Soul pictured as a girdle (ζωστήρ) and Tim. 36 e. 25. Cf. Theiler, Chald. Or. u. Synesios, 7. On Chalcidius׳ use of Numenius see now J. C. M. van Winden, Calcidius on Matter (Leiden, 1959). Numenian influence on the present passage is strongly suggested by the description of the Second God as latorem legis : Numenius had called him 6 νομοθέτης (fragm. 22). 26. Numenius, fragm. 26 Leemans. His \" First Intellect ״ is identical with the Supreme God, and this view seems to be implied in some frag-ments of the Oracles, whereas other fragments appear to distinguish them (Lewy, p. 322, cf. Kroll, p. 14). 27. Cf. Festugifere, R6v. d'Hermfes, III. 53 ff., IV. 132 ff."},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"Ε. R. DODDS 094 Kroll, Numenius, fragm. 21). [271] In both, the Second Intellect is dyadic (δυάς, Oracles, p. 14 Κ., διττός, Numenius, fragm. 25), since it is directed at once to the Intelligibles and to Matter. In both, Matter is evil, and informed by an active evil principle (the Chaldaean \" Hades \" Numenius' evil world-soul, p. 94 Leemans). In both, the human mind must make itself empty (κενεόν, Oracles, p. 11 K., the έρημία of Numenius fragm. 11) in order to receive God ; otherwise, as both tell us, the vision will be illusory. Finally, the statement of the Oracles about the Father πάντ' έστι γάρ, άλλά νοητώς (ρ. 19 Κ.), is an application of Numenius'' principle έν πάσιν πάντα είναι, οϊκείως μέντοι κατά τήν αύτών ούσίαν έν έκάστοις (ρ. 97.26 Leemans). These agreements must seem too many and too specific to be accidental, especially when we remember that we are dealing with fragments on both sides. Some sort of bridge must have linked the two systems ; but I find it hard to be quite sure which way the traffic ran.28 It could even have been a two-way traffic, since so far as our scanty knowledge goes Numenius and Julianus may well have been contemporaries. In the last of the instances quoted above the oracle-maker would appear to be applying the philosopher's gene-ralization ; on the other hand, the address to mankind is much more natural in an oracle than in a philosophical dialogue.29 Certainly a work like the Oracles would appeal to Numenius, who was, in Macrobius' words, occultorum curiosior,30 just as it did to his fellow-Pythagorean Nicomachus of Gerasa, the earliest extant author to refer to theurgy31. As to the oriental elements (chap. VII), Lewy concludes that the original theurgists (who were probably \" Chaldaean \" by race [272] as well as by spiritual inheritance) drew on a pre-existing \" Irano-Syro-Babylonian theocrasy \" (p. 425). Thus the Aion (or rather Chronos) of the Oracles represents the Iranian Zervan (pp. 401 ff.) ; the Έπτάκτις θεός of the Oracles derives from Syrian solar theology (pp. 409 ff.) ;32 the έπτάπορος βαθμίς recalls the Mithraic κλίμα ξ έπτάπυλος (p. 414) ; the άρχαί or 28. Cf. Les Sources de Plotin (Entretiens Hardt, Tome V). 10 f., 33 f. 29. This is hardly disproved by [Plat.] Clitopho 407 a ώσπερ έπί μηχανής τραγικ-ής θεός, βμνεις λέγων· ποϊ φέρεσθε, ώνθρωποι..., where the impli-cation is that such apostrophes were felt to be alien to the dialogue style. 30. Numenius, fragm. 39. His addiction to τελεστική (p. 100.19 Leemans), on which Julianus the theurgist was the great expert, is attested by fragms. 9 and 33. 31. Nicomachus, Exeerpta de musica, p. 277 Jan. Lewy thinks the reference an interpolation, since Nicomachus \" lived in the first naii of the second century ״ (p. 250, n. 83). But the earliest terminus ante quern for Nicomachus is given by the fact that Apuleius translated one of his books ; an Apuleius (bom about 123-125) may well have been activc quite late in the century (the date of his death is unknown;. There is thus no difficulty in making Nicomachus a contemporary Julianus. 32.

So far as I can judge, all these identifications appear plausible if not certain. And we can now add (as Nock points out, Specu-lum 34, 1959, 473 f.) the divine names ״ Ad ״ and ״ Adad ״ cited in the new portion of Proclus' commentary on the Parmenides (Plato Latinus III. 58-60). Adad appears to be the Syrian Hadad (Macrob., Sat. 1.23.17), Ad an invented name ; it seems safe to equate them respectively with the δίς (Ad + Ad) έπέκεινα and the δπαξ έπέκεινα who figure elsewhere in the Oracles. It is a curious jumble ; but as Lewy rightly points out, such syncretism was already in the air. Not only was there a coalescence between cults of diverse national origin, but Greek and oriental doctrine were drawing together. The sort of Platonists whom the theurgists read were already prepared to admit Iranian dualism (cf., e.g., Plut., Is. et Os. 46, 370 E), and to identify Plato's teaching about the soul's descent and return with its astral journey as described in the eastern cults (cf. Celsus apud Origen, c. Cels. 6.21 f.). Hence it was easy for theurgy to win acceptance as \" the last form of pagan religion \" (p. 441). Appended to the book are a series of excursuses. Some of these provide most useful factual surveys : e.g., on Neoplatonic modes of reference to the Oracles (Exc. I) ; on neologisms and rare words in the Oracles (Exc. Ill) ; on the meaning and history of the term \" theurgy \" (Exc. IV). Others are concerned with particular source-problems. Especially valuable is Exc. VI, where Lewy collects the widely scattered references to the Oracles in the works of Psellus, and shows, against Bidez, that Pletho got his knowledge of them solely from Psellus.33 To sum up, despite its faults — not all of which should be [273] laid at the author's door — Lewy's book makes a solid and indispensable contri-bution to our understanding of this latest phase of paganism. If we are to advance any further, what is now most needed is a comprehensive collection not only of verbatim fragments but of all references to the doctrines and practices of theurgy. It is a matter of deep regret that Lewy did not live to carry this out himself ; but he has done a great deal to prepare the ground for any future editor.34 33, To whom we also, it now appears, owe the preservation of the de mysteriis (see M. Sicherl in Byz. Ztschr., 53, 1960). 34.

Je voudrais enum6rer ici brifcvement les 616ments de solution d6j& proposds et, even-tuellement, les directions de recherche a envisager. I. — L'AUTEUE Pour commencer par un probleme mineur, il faut reconnaitre qu'il subsiste toujours des incertitudes et des imprdcisions concernant la personnalit6 du redacteur des Oracles. Tout d'abord, est-ce bien Julien le Thfeurge, qui v6cut sous Marc Aurfele ? Apres bien des hesitations, on s'accorde en g6n6ral & le penser, en s'appuyant sur les tdmoignages de « Suidas » et de Psellus, qui ont tous"},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"PIERRE HADOT 704 deux puise a des sources neoplatoniciennes1. Tous deux distinguent deux personnages du nom de Julien, le pere et le fils, qui ont v6cu k l'6poque de Marc Aurele. « Suidas2 » nous rapporte que le pere, surnomme «le Chald6en » n'avait compose qu'un seul ouvrage : « Sur les Demons » tandis que le fils, surnomme « le Th6urge », avait r6dig£ des livres se rapportant a la theurgie, a la teiestique3, et des Oracles en vers. Psellus de son c6te, parle bien de deux Julien « qui vecurent sous Marc Aurele4»' mais il dit une fois que c'est un Julien, vivant k l'6poque de Trajan, qui «a expose en vers les dogmes appel6s Oracles par ceux qui magnifient les dires de ces Chald6ens® » et une autre fois que c'est un Julien contem-porain de Marc Aurfele « qui a r6dig6 en vers ces opinions (des Chaldeens) que ceux qui sont aprfcs cdlebrent comme des Oraclese. » La mention de l'empereur Trajan est-elle une b6vue, comme le pense W. Theiler' ? Ou bien Psellus veut-il parler de Julien le pere ? Les n60plat0niciens eux-memes nous apportent sur ce point peu de renseignements precis. Proclus parle plusieurs fois des «Theurges qui v6curent sous Marc Aurele ». 1. Hesitations : En 1829, Ch. A. Lobeck (Aglaophamus, p. 102) est le premier a supposer que le r^dacteur des Oracles est Julien le Theurge. En 1839-1840, Thilo (De coelo empyreo, II, p. 14) a accepts cette hypo-th6se. W. Kroll, dans sa monographie sur les Oracles Chaldaiques (Breslau, 1894), l'admet lui aussi avec beaucoup de circonspection et de prudence. II y renonce en 1918 dans son article Iulianos de la Realencyclop&die (X, 1, col. 15-18). J. Bidez se contente d'affirmer que les deux Julien furent les premiers interprfetes des Logia (Catalogue des manuscrits alchi-miques grecs, t. VI, Bruxelles, 1928, p. 106). 2. SUIDAS, Lexikon, art. Ioulianos (n° 433-434 Adler). 3. A lire le texte de Suidas, on a l'impression que ces Telestika sont diffirents des Oracles en vers. Or une scholie du Philopseudes de Lucien (t. IV, p. 224 Jacobitz) parle d'un commentaire de Proclus sur ces Telestika de Julien, et l'on s'accorde en general k reconnaitre en ces Telestika les Oracles eux-m6mes (cf. L. G. WESTERINK, Proclus, Procopius, Psellus, dans Mnemosyne, 3» serie, 10, 1942, p. 276 ; E. R. DODDS, Theurgy and its Relationship to Neoplaionism, dans The Journal of Roman Studies, t. 37, 1947, p. 55). 4. Psellus, dans J. BIDEZ, Catalogue des manuscrits alchimiques grecs, t.

PSELLUS, DU premier discours sur le Fils (de Gregoire de Nazianze), dans fi. DES PLACES, Oracles Chaldaiques, p. 224. Dans son petit traite A ceux qui avaient demandi combien 11 y a de genres de discours philoso-phiques (£. DES PLACES, Oracles Chaldaiques, p. 222), Psellus parle bien de Julien le Th6urge qui opera un prodige pendant l'expedition de Marc Aurfele contre les Daces, mais il ne dit pas explicitement que ce Julien est le redacteur des Oracles ; ce Julien n'intervient qu'4 propos du theme des evocations de dieux, comme adversaire d'Apuiee dans une joute ae pouvoir incantatoire. 7.

L'empe-reur Julien lui-m6me semble ne connaitre qu'un seul Julien : « Cherche pour moi tout ce que Jamblique a ecrit sur mon homonyme... Pour ma part, je raffole de Jamblique en philosophie et de mon homonyme en theosophie9. » Rien, dans ce texte, ne permet d'ailleurs d'affirmer que Julien parle des Oracles Chaldaiques et du commentaire de Jamblique sur ces Oracles. On peut tout aussi bien supposer qu'il s'agit des ouvrages theurgiques de 1'« homonyme » de Julien. Est-ce aussi ces ouvrages theurgiques que Porphyre avait commentes dans son livre: είς τά Ίουλιανοϋ τοϋ Χαλδαίου10 ? II est vrai que J. Bidez avait identifie cet ouvrage avec un commentaire des Oracles dont parle Jean Lydus11. Mais il fau-drait, dans ce cas, supposer que, pour Porphyre, c'etait Julien le Chald6en, done le pere, qui aurait ete I'auteur des Oracles. Ou alors, il faut admettre que l'on employait indistinctement les expressions «Chald6en» et «Th6urge», et que, par suite, l'on distinguait mal entre Julien le Chaldden et Julien le Theurge. Ces hesitations de la tradition doivent nous inciter a montrer un tres grand esprit critique dans l'examen de ce probleme de « paternite ». Julien le Theurge est-il le seul redacteur des Oracles ? Ou bien les deux Julien ont-ils collabore a cette redaction12 ? Ne vaut-il pas mieux dire avec des Places, qu'il « reste plus silr de garder aux Oracles l'ano-nymat13 » ? Car, somme toute, !'attribution explicite des Oracles k Julien ou aux deux Julien est tres tardive et resulte peut-Stre d'une confusion entre les ceuvres theurgiques de ces deux personnages et les Oracles proprement dits14.

On peut penser que le redacteur des Oracles a voulu presenter ces vers comme l'expression des traditions ancestrales (πάτρια δόγματα, comme dit Jamblique), reveiees originellement par les dieux aux Chaldeens et aux Assyriens20.

III. — LES TEMOINS L&s Oracles ne nous sont parvenus que d'une fagon indirecte, grace aux citations que, de Porphyre 4 Psellus (et a Piethon), les ndoplatoniciens en ont fait. On s'accorde g6n6ralement a reconnaitre que Porphyre est le premier t6moin des Oracles28. Pourtant certains historiens ont pens6 pouvoir d6celer des traces de ces Oracles chez Plotin et m6me chez Numenius. 1. Numinius et les « Oracles » Depuis longtemps on a remarque la parente entre ce que nous pouvons encore fragmentairement connaltre de la pens6e de Numenius et la doctrine philosophique des Oracles2*. De part et d'autre on retrouve une distinction entre deux Intellects, l'un, paternel, qui est transcendant et pur de tout contact avec la matiere, l'autre, engendr6 par le premier, qui organise le monde sensible et pr6sente, en vertu de son double aspect, contemplatif et actif, un caractere dyadique25. L'analogie devient presque paralieie textuel lorsque l'on compare ce fragment des Oracles (p. 14 Kroll = fr. 7 des Places) : « Le Pfere a cre6 toutes choses en un 6tat de perfection et il les a livrtes au second Intellect, que vous appelez le Premier, tous tant que vous 6tes, race humaine » et ce fragment de Num6nius (fr. 26 Leemans = fr. 17 des Places) : a Comme Platon savait que chez les hommes Ie demiurge est seul connu, tandis que le Premier Intellect, celui qui est l'fitant en soi, est compietement ignore chez eux, pour cette raison il s'est exprim6 comme quelqu'un qui dirait : « 0 Hommes, celui en qui vous conjecturez 1'Intellect, n'est pas le Premier, mais il y a avant lui un autre Intellect, anterieur et plus divin. » On peut done penser que les Oracles ont subi !'influence de la philosophie de 22. Par exemple, chez JAMBLIQUE, De myst., VIII, 3, p. 262, 14 Parthey (p. 196 des Places). 23. Cf. H. LEWY, p. 7. 24. W. KROLL, De orac. chald., p. 14 η. 1. 25. Cf. A.-J.

R. Dodds28, opinion qu'il a d'ailleurs nuanc6e dans son compte rendu de H. Lewy en parlant plutftt d'6change r6ciproque : a two-way traffic29. H. Lewy lui-m&ne excluait toute in-fluence des Oracles sur Numenius80, mais doutait egalement d'une influence de Numenius sur les Oracles, en insistant avec raison sur les differences capitales qui, a c0t6 de ces analogies, separent profond6ment Numenius et les Oracles pour d'autres questions de la philosophie plato-nicienne. II songeait plutdt a une source commune ou k des developpe-ments paralteles autonomes31. II me semble, en tout cas, qu'il ne faut pas exag6rer la parente entre Numenius et les Oracles. Tout d'abord, la doc-trine des deux Intellects n'est pas propre k Numenius. Elle est assez repandue au 1er et au ne siecle aprfes Jesus-Christ32. Surtout il y a, entre Num6nius et les Oracles, d'importantes divergences doctrinales. Pour les Oracles, la matiere est engendree par le Pere33 (c'est-a-dire pour eux, par le premier principe), alors que Numenius est violemment hostile a l'idee d'une matiere engendree34.

Kroll (p. 5) a refuse de reconnaitre comme chaldalque cette formule qui ne peut provenir d'un hexamfetre. II pensait que Proclus avait, dans son commentaire des Oracles, cite ces quelques mots de Plotin et que, par inadvertence, Psellus avait cru qu'il s'agissait d'un Oracle. E. R.

Je pense en effet qu'il faut traduire 1 Oracle suivant (Kroll, p. 15, des Places, fr. 12) : ταναή μονάς έστιν καί δύο γεννφ de cette maniere : « La monade est etendue et elle engendre deux », et non pas comme H. Lewy et, £ sa suite, β. des Places : « II est une monade subtile qui engendre deux.מ Dans le contexte de la citation de cet Oracle par Damascius (Dub. et Sol., § 148), i] apparalt clairement que ταναή implique l'idee de deploiement et d'extension. Le vers est applique έ Ι'Αϊόη, parce qu'il est elan et tension (τετάσθαι, c'est l'etymologie de ταναή) vers la generation. Sur cette derivation de la dyade & partir de la monade, cf. les references donnees par J. H. Waszink dans 1apparat de son edition de Calcidius, § 295.

Eitrem42, sans se r6f6rer k une utilisation precise et litterale des Oracles par Plotin, a voulu, d'une maniere plus g6n6rale, faire deriver de Plotin lui-mfime la th6urgie neoplatonicienne! E. R. Dodds43 a remarquablement refute cette affirmation, en d6fi_ nissant le vrai sens de la mystique plotinienne. R6cemment, W. Theiler a cru decouvrir des reminiscences litt6rales des Oracles chez Plotin44. II s'agissait pour lui d'expliquer les allusions qu'Hierocies fait aux Oracles Chaldaiques : comme, selon son hypothese de travail, Hierocles ne fait que reproduire l'enseignement d'Ammonius Saccas, il lui fallait prouver qu'Ammonius avait connu les Oracles et il fallait, pour cela, decouvrir des traces chaldaiques chez Plotin, temoin de l'enseignement d'Ammonius. II pense done pouvoir reconnaltre ces traces dans trois mots employes par Plotin : πικρά (II, 3, 17, 23), όπισθοβαρής (VI, 9, 4, 22), άμφίστομος (III, 8, 9, 31). On conviendra que ces rapprochements sont bien minces, d'autant plus que ces termes n'ont rien de sp6cifiquement chaldalque. II est vrai que les Oracles (p. 61 Kroll = fr. 129 des Places) emploient l'image de l'amertume de la mati&re, qui apparatt chez Plotin. Mais c'est 14 une image qui vient naturellement έ partir du moment oil l'on considfere la mer comme Ie symbole de la matiere. L,Autre des Nymphes de Porphyre fait remonter cette m6taphore έ Homfere lui-m6me45. Et l'on peut voir chez saint Augustin comment cette liaison entre matiere, mer et amertume se presente facilement a l'esprit4e. D'ailleurs 1 Oracle (non-chaldaique) cite par Porphyre dans sa Vie de Plotin parle lui aussi des vagues ameres de la vie dans la matiere47. Quant & όπισθοβαρής il n'est pas du tout sftr que ce soit un terme propre-ment chaldalque. H.

Enfin, en ce qui concerne άμφίστομος, il faut bien constater que ce mot, lui non plus, n'est jamais cite comme proprement chaldalque par les neoplatoniciens. II fait probablement allusion aux multiples visages d'H6cate et, 4 cause de cela, il est utilise par Proclus pour decrire la situation de l'Ame50. Mais le mot est assez courant pour designer un fitre qui regarde dans deux direc-tions, et d'ailleurs Plotin ne l'emploie pas k propos de l'ftme, mais Apropos de 1'Intellect51, qui n'a rien A voir avec H6cate. Selon toute vraisemblance, Plotin n'a pas connu les Oracles Chaldaiques ou a refuse de s'y interesser. 3. Porphyre En ce qui concerne Porphyre, il n'y a aucun doute : il a connu et utilise les Oracles Chaldaiques. Mais dans quels ouvrages ? Un premier probl£me surgit avec sa Philosophie des Oracles. Nous connaissons ce traite gr&ce aux citations d'Eusfebe de C6saree, Firmicus Maternus, Lactance, Augustin, Jean Philopon62 et, comme l'a montre H. Lewy53, par l'interme־ diaire egalement de la collection chretienne publiee par Buresch54 sousle titre Prophetie des dieux palens (Theosophia Tubingensis). G. Wolff55 a tente en 1856 de reconstituer le plan de cet ouvrage. Un premier livre traitait des dieux : aprks une preface, il montrait successivement k 1'aide de citations d Oracles ce que doivent £tre la piete et le eulte envers les dieux, ce qu'est leur genre de vie, le sens des statues qui les repr6sentent, quelles formes ils prennent pour apparaitre, les lieux qu'ils fr6quentent, les sacrifices qu'il faut leur offrir, les jours oil il faut les invoquer, les nations qui sont les plus savantes dans les choses divines. Le second livre traitait des demons, le troisieme, des heros. On trouve dans cet ouvrage des reponses oraculaires d'Apollon, de S6rapis, d'H6cate. Jusqu'A H. Lewy, 49.

Le mot άμφίστομος est plusieurs fois employe par Proclus en liaison avec άμφιπρόσωπος qui est peut-Stre un terme chaldalque (In Tim.. t. II, p. 246, 19 et 293, 23 Diehl). Cf. H. LEWY, p. 355, A.-J.

Cette situation a peu de rapport avec celle de l'Hecate chaldalque. 52. Cf. G. WOLFF, Porphyrii de philosophia ex oraculis haurienda hbrorum reliquiae, Berlin, 1856 (reimpr. Hildesheim, 1962). 53. H.

Cette hypothe.se a 6t6 admise par certains historiens58, refus6e par d'autres59. Elle est loin, en tout cas, de faire l'unanimite.

Mais, d'un autre cdte, il semble bien etrange, comme le note E. R. Dodds60, qu'un collectionneur d'Oracles aussi diligent que Porphyre ait pu ignorer un recueil aussi important que les Oracles Chaldaiques, recueil qui circulait deja depuis un certain temps si l'on admet que Julien le Theurge ou les deux Julien en etait les r6dacteurs. Nous sommes ici en pleine enigme : pourquoi les Oracles dits Chaldaiques de la Philosophie des Oracles seraient-ils restes inconnus aux neoplatoni-ciens posterieurs ? Mais k l'inverse, comment Porphyre a-t-il pu ignorer les Oracles Chaldaiques en redigeant sa Philosophie des Oracles ?

Faut-il identifier ce commentaire avec 1'υπόμνημα τών λογίων dont parle Jean Lydus66 ? Une nouvelle difficulte apparait avec un texte d'fin6e de Gaza qui n'a pas encore ete explique jusqu'ici d'une maniere satisfaisante : έτη-γράφει δέ καθόλου τό βιβλίον, 6 είς μέσον προάγει τών Χαλδαίων τά λόγια66. C'est le mot καθόλου qui fait difficulte. Certains interpretes le conservent; ils proposent alors de traduire : « Porphyre donne comme titre general au livre qui les revile au public : Les Oracles des Chaldiens*7», ou bien : « Porphyre donne un titre general au livre qui revfele au public les Oracles des Chaldeens®8. » On voit que la premiere traduction fait apparaltre un livre de Porphyre : Les Oracles des Chaldiens qui est different de la Philosophie des Oracles et du De regressu animae, mais qui s'identifie peut-6tre avec l'ouvrage Sur les icrits de Julien le Chaldien. L'auteur de la seconde traduction voudrait reconnaitre dans ce «titre general », « La Philosophie des Oracles69. » D'autres interpretes corrigent en καθόδου ou περί καθόδου. Dans cette hypothese, on traduirait : «Porphyre donne comme titre : « De la descente » au livre qui r6ve1e au public les Oracles des Chaldiens. » Selon certains, ce titre se rapporterait a l'un des livres du grand ouvrage que Porphyre aurait 6crit Sur la matiere70. Selon H. Lewy, ce titre designerait l'un des livres du traite de Porphyre sur les Oracles Chaldaiques, le titre complet de l'ouvrage etant alors : « Sur les logia de Julien Ie Chaldeen, au sujet de la descente et de la remontee des Elmes»71.

C'est par Porphyre que certains auteurs latins comme Arnobe, Lactance peut-6tre, Victorinus et Augustin, et des auteurs grecs comme Synesius, ont connu les Oracles73. Surtout, comme je l'ai montr6 ailleurs, tout le ndoplatonisme posterieur, de Jamblique k Damascius, a re$u de Porphyre la probtematique A laquelle il essaie de rtpondre : concilier la lettre des Oracles et l'esprit du plotinisme, c'est-i-dire d'une part un systeme, celui des Oracles, dans lequel Dieu comporte en lui-mfime une multiplicite virtuelle : une Puissance et un Intellect, et d'autre part un systfeme, celui de Plotin, dans lequel Dieu est absolument un et simple. La solution de Porphyre consiste k admettre une certaine pr6existence de la seconde hypostase (l'Intellect ou Un-Multiple) au sein de l'Un. Les neopla-toniciens posterieurs, k partir de Jamblique, refuseront d'appliquer cette solution au niveau du premier principe, mais ils la conserveront pour expliquer la naissance de l'Un-Multiple74.

C'est sous l'influence de cette systematisation neoplatonicienne que nous avons tendance ά croire que les Oracles Chaldaiques proposaient originellement un systfeme phi-losophique coherent. On peut se demander legitimement si cela est justifie. Sans doute, on a parfaitement le droit d'etudier tel ou tel theme ou notion dans les Oracles. Et par exemple le livre d'O.

MYSTIQUE, MAGIE, THEURGIE, GNOSTICISME Un des grands merites du livre de H. Lewy est certainement d'avoir analyst avec beaucoup de soin les pratiques theurgiques chaldaiques83. Parfaitement conscient de l'originalite de ce phenomene religieux, H. Lewy ne s'est pourtant pas libere des confusions de vocabulaire qui regnaient encore au debut du xxe siecle, a une epoque 011 l'on englobait dans un m£me mepris le mysticisme et la magie, que l'on parvenait mal 4 distinguer84. Le sous-titre de l'ouvrage de H. Lewy est tout k fait significatif : apr£s le titre Chaldaean Oracles and Theurgy, les mots : Mysticism, Magic and Platonism semblent l'expliquer, comme si « mysti-cisme et magie » etaient les composantes de la theurgie. De m£me dans !'introduction, les Oracles Chaldaiques sont pr6sent6s comme un « poeme magico-mystique». Heureusement, depuis H. Lewy, les etudes de E. R. Dodds86, de CI. Zintzen8® et, tout particulierement, de F. W. Cre-mer87 ont defini avec beaucoup de clarte !'essence propre de la theurgie chaldaique en la distinguant aussi bien de l'experience unitive plotinienne que de la magie. A la difference de la magie, la theurgie n'exerce pas de contrainte sur les dieux, pour les forcer a apparaitre, mais au contraire elle se soumet a leur volonte en accomplissant les actes qu'ils veulent. D'autre part, a la difference de l'exp6rience unitive de type plotinien, la theurgie atteint l'union avec les dieux, non par un exercice spirituel, mais par des actions sacramentelles, des rites sensibles, incomprehensibles k !'intelligence : «L'accomplissement des operations ineffables qui depassent toute connaissance, selon un mode qui convient aux dieux, et la puissance des « symboles » indicibles compris par les dieux seuls pro-duisent l'union theurgique. Ainsi n'est-ce point par !'intelligence que nous accomplissons les choses sacrees : sinon cette operation sera un effet de notre intelligence et dependra de nous88. » Ce texte de Jamblique montre bien le supernaturalisme qui a envahi le platonisme tardif et qui s6pare si profondement Jamblique de Plotin et de Porphyre. 83.

Tout d'abord, il faut bien reconnaitre que le mot « mystique » est un terme mal defini, que l'on emploie souvent 4 tort et a travers. Cette imprecision provient probablement du fait que ce mot a 6te employe d'une maniere technique en des sens trfes differents. Levy-Bruhl l'employait a propos de la croyance des « primitifs » 4 des corres-pondances ou sympathies occultes entre les parties de l'univers90. Mais les psychologues et historiens de la spiritualite reservent le terme « mys-tique » aux etats psychologiques, analogues 4 l'experience unitive plo-tinienne, dans lesquels le sujet eprouve une union directe et immediate avec le principe fondamental de l'fitre·1. Normalement, si l'on parle de « mystique » plotinienne ou neoplatonicienne, il ne faudrait employer ce mot que dans le sens qui vient d'etre defini, done en le distinguant soi-gneusement des notions de theurgie et de magie qui font intervenir des rites sensibles. La mystique se caracterise pr6cis6ment par le detache-ment de toute activite corporelle : l'experience mystique est preparee par une asc£se interieure et des exercices purement spirituels. Mais il faut bien prendre garde au fait que le mot grec mustikos est employe par les neoplatoniciens dans un sens tres different de celui que nous venons de definir. II designe ce qui se rapporte aux mysteres, done aux rites religieux et theurgiques et, par extension, ce qui est cache, secret, mysterieux. On pourrait done employer le mot « mystique » a propos de la theurgie, mais a condition de bien pr6ciser alors qu'il ne s'agit pas de l'experience mystique au sens oil on peut l'employer 4 propos de Plotin. II me semble que la solution la plus sage serait de bannir ce mot, source de confusion et d'obscurite. Quoiqu'il en soit, il est important de constater que les Oracles Chal-dalques, s'ils proposent des techniques theurgiques d'union avec Ie divin, semblent connaltre aussi une autre methode de connaissance du divin, qui est tres analogue k l'experience unitive plotinienne. Un assez long fragment des Oracles (p. 11 Kroll = fr. 1 des Places) nous dit en effet qu'il ne faut pas chercher k saisir le principe en l'imaginant comme un objet determine parmi d'autres, mais qu'il faut tendre vers lui une 89. On trouvera un exemple de cette confusion en lisant la discussion qui suivit la conference de DES PLACES, La religion de Jamblique, dans Entretiens sur I'Antiquiti classique, t. XXI, Fondation Hardt, Vandceuvres-Geneve, 1975, p. 98-100 (B. Dalsgaard Larsen insiste avec raison sur la difference entre theurgie et magie). 90. L. L6VY-BRUHL, L'expirience mystique et les symboles chez les primi-tifs, Paris, 1938, ού l'on trouve une confusion totale entre mystique et magie (pouvoir sur les puissances invisibles). 91. Pour une initiation k ces probiemes, cf. l'article de M. de CEBTEAU, Mystique, dans 1'Encyclopaedia Universalis, ού l'on trouvera une biblio-graphie, k laquelle on ajoutera R. C.

Faut-il en conclure que les Oracles juxtaposent des m6thodes d'union avec le divin tr£s diff6rentes : une methode theurgique et une methode purement spirituelle ? On peut imaginer, pour reduire cette incoherence, que les pratiques theurgiques sont utilisees pour l'union avec les dieux inferieurs, et la methode purement spirituelle, lorsqu'il s'agit d'atteindre le principe supreme. Cette difference de methode correspondrait assez bien aux conceptions porphyriennes, selon lesquelles la theurgie ne fait acceder qu'aux dieux inferieurs et seule la theologie negative permet d'atteindre le Dieu transcendent93. On peut aussi penser avec F. W. Cremer que ce texte se rapporte aux dispo-sitions d'esprit dans lesquelles doit se trouver le theurge et qui s'opposent radicalement k celles du mage94. En effet, Ie fragment dont nous parlons insiste beaucoup sur le fait qu'il ne faut pas a concevoir cet Intelligible avec vehemence », mais avec une intelligence docile, pr£te k s'abandonner a son objet. Or ce qui distingue precisement la theurgie de la magie, c'est l'absence de vehemence, de contrainte, de menace, la docilite et la soumission 4 la volonte des dieux. Dans cette interpretation, le fragment n'aurait pas un sens « plotinien », il ne proposerait pas une union directe et purement spirituelle avec le divin, mais il se rapporterait aux dispo-sitions interieures necessaires a la reussite de l'op6ration theurgique. F. W. Cremer a bien souligne l'originalite de la theurgie : « Une confu-sion entre theurgie et magie n'est plus possible96. » On peut parler d'une utilisation par le theurge de certaines pratiques magiques, mais elles sont integrees k une demarche radicalement differente de la magie. Car la theurgie est une operation dans laquelle ce sont les dieux qui donnent une efficacite divine k Taction humaine, en sorte que Taction humaine re^oit son sens en raison d'une action et d'une initiative divines.

Quoiqu'il en soit, il est bien evident qu'il faudra tenir compte d6sormais dans l'etude des Oracles Chaldaiques des progrfes gigantesques faits dans les recherches sur le gnosticisme 4 la suite de la d6couverte de Nag Hammadi.

C'est tres t6t pourtant qu'il fut mis en conflit. Des ses etudes secondares et contre l'avis de ses parents, il milite au sein du gr-oup «Blau Weiss» un mouvement de jeunesse sioniste et prend parti pour le lyrisme nietzscheen de Stephan George contre l'impassibilite wilamowitzienne. Apris le lycee, il suit parallfelement les cours de l'ficole des Hautes fitudes Juives (siminaire rabbinique) et ceux de l'Universite de Berlin. A la pratique de l'hebreu, il ajoute alors celle du syriaque, de l'arabe et de l'arminien. Mais il s'enthousiasme surtout pour la philologie classique partagde, apres le depart 4 la retraite de Wilamowitz, entre l'idee et la lettre, Norden et Jaeger d'un c6te, Diels et Ed. Meyer de l'autre. Les analyses nouvelles et brillantes de Werner Jaeger le seduisent d'emblee, mais les sympathies « aryennes »qui sous-tendent 1'« humanisme hellenique » de Jaeger ameneront Lewy a rompre definitivement avec lui des la fin des annees 20. Par contre, il restera toujours trfes attache a la personnalite d'Eduard Norden, qui aura sur lui une influence decisive. Venait alors de paraitre l'etude de Norden sur la IVe figlogue de Virgile : Die Geburt des Kindes (1924), et c'est dans cette m6me voie de recherche des formes du discours religieux, inauguree en 1913 par Agnostos Theos, que Norden orientera Lewy. Philologue exclusivement classique, Norden voyait en Lewy — qui etait en plus orientaliste — celui qui pouvait prolonger vers !Orient des analyses jusque-14 limitees au domaine gr6co-romain. C'est done ainsi, sous la direction de Norden et dans la fideiite k la methode chfere & son maitre de lire les faits de l'histoire de la pensee 4 partir des faits de l'histoire des styles, que Lewy entreprit la redaction de sa dissertation inaugurate, Sobria ebrietas, pr6sent6e 4 Berlin en 1926 et publiee k Giessen en 1929. La mime annee, Reitzenstein dira, dans son compte rendu de la Deutsche Literatur-Zeitung, tout le bien qu'il pense de cet opuscule. Dis la fin de sa these, Lewy projette une edition des manuscrits arme-niens de Philon. Norden, Meyer et Wilamowitz — ce dernier lui obtient aupres de l'Academie Prussienne des Sciences une bourse de recherche pour l'Arm6nie sovietique, d'oii Lewy reviendra tris anticommuniste — l'encouragent vivement. Les rencontres de travail le rapprochent alors de Wilamowitz, dont il conservera la photographie sur son bureau k Jerusalem. L'arrivee des Nazis au pouvoir (1933) met un terme au projet d'edition du Philon armenien. Lewy emigre aussit6t en Palestine, oil il occupe a partir de 1934 la chaire de langue et litterature latines k l'Universite hebraique de Jerusalem. C'est 14 qu'il poursuivra jusqu'4 sa mort l'etude des questions qui s'etaient imposees 4 lui des l'epoque de Sobria ebrietas : rdle de Philon dans la rencontre du judaisme et de l'hell6nisme, corpus — reste inacheve — des vestiges et temoignages « paiens »sur le judaisme, l'antisemitisme et la litterature jud60-hellenistique — en somme, une refonte du Reinach de 1895 —, recherches sur les origines et le developpe-ment de la pensee de Julien, place du judaisme dans cette tentative d'une"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"723 NOTICE SUR Η.

Un troisieme point de l'originalite des recherches de Jahn a consiste a aborder l'etude des OC par le biais de leurs citateurs pre-byzantins, en l'occurence pa! le principal d'entre eux, Proclus. Le savant suisse est, en effet, le premier a avoir precede a une edition critique, a partir des trois manuscrits existants, des extraits par Psellus du commentaire de Proclus sur la philosophie chaldalque (Jahn 1891)4. Les annotations qu'il a composees sur ces Extraits sont toujours utiles a consulter. Toutefois, l'apport ultime de Jahn, et, bien malgre lui, decisif a l'histoire de la recherche sur les OC aura ete de susciter une emulation, en amenant un jeune et brillant philologue allemand, Wilhelm Kroll (1869-1939), a proceder au rassemblement de tous les fragments connus et a adopter pour cette mise en ordre le plan d'un manuel imaginaire de philosophie neopla-3. Ainsi chez Patrizi et Pic de la Mirandole (voir la-dessus les remarques pertinentes de Jahn 1900, 170), mais aussi chez la plupart des auteurs modernes et contempo-rains. A titre d'exemple, Cumont 1949, 361 (= 2009, 416): «L'epithete de chaldaque indique que (cette revelation) pretendait exprimer la sagesse presumee de l'ancien clerge babylonien, et !'importance qu'elle accordait au eulte du Feu, qui caracterise le mazdeisme, semblerait indiquer pareillement une otigine iranienne, reelle ou fictive.» Ce genre de points de vue est ttibutaire d'une conception generale de l'histoire des religions dominee par le pan-iranisme ou le pan-babylonisme. Jahn 1900,170 qualifie deja de creduli ceux qui s'imaginent que les OC proviennent reellement de la Chaldee et qu'ils y aient ete inspires par les dieux; a ses yeux, la monographic de Kroll 1894 est a ranger parmi les creduli, continuateurs de Patrizi et de Pic de la Mirandole (172). Effectivement, Kroll rattache le pretendu «eulte du feu» dans les OC a la religion des Perses, c׳est-a-dire au mazdeisme (Kroll 1894, 68; 1917b, 152). Jahn 1900, 170 declare avoir consulte deux orientalistes specialistes des litteratures «chaldeennes» archaiques (perse/moyen-perse, akkadien et syriaque), qui ont ete totalement negatifs sur la presence d'oracles analogues dans les domaines etudies par eux. J'ignore qui sont ces orientalistes consultes. L'un d'eux aurait pu etre le syriacisant Rubens Duval (1839-1911). II connaissait les textes grecs de l'Antiquite tardive et etait en relation avec les professeurs parisiens que firequentait Jahn. 4. Des trois temoins manuscrits des Eclogae de Proclus sur lesquelles se base l'edi-tion de Jahn, le texte du Vaticanus graecus 1026 avait ete deja publie par J.-B. Pitra, Anakcta sacra et ciassica, V/2, Paris et Rome, 1888, 192-196. Jahn, qui n'a pas connu cette publication, indique qu'il a profite d'une copie du manuscrit due a August Mau (1840-1909), alors membre du Deutsches Archaologisches Institut de Rome et bibliothecaire du meme Institut Qahn 1891, p. X). Kroll 1892,100 ayant mis en avant cette aide a Jahn refue de Mau, Jahn ne manqua de repliquer en faisant remarquer que Kroll 1894 avait beneficie pareillement et abondamment de l'aide de ses colle-gues allemands de Rome et d'Allemagne pour la collation des manuscrits du Vatican (adiutus subsidiis criiicis Romae coUectis, Jahn 1900,172), cf.

Kroll a 25 ans lorsqu'il la publie en tant qu'Habilitationschrift, ce qui lui vaudra d'etre nomme Privatdozent a l'universite de Breslau (1894-1898). Durant ces annees de Breslau, il travaille a l'edition du commentaire de Proclus a la Repuhlique de Platon (2 vol., Teubner, 1899-1901). A la suite de quoi, il succede a Eduard Norden comme professeur ordinaire a Greifswald (1899-1906), puis il ira a Miinster (1906-1913), ou il prend la succession de Georg Wissowa comme editeur scientifique de la Paulys Real-Encyclopadie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft5. Sa carriere universitaire s'achevera la ou elle a commence (Breslau, 1913-1935)6. La formation de Kroll est un concentre de ce que la philologie allemande produit de meilleur, et elle a pour cadre !'institution la plus btillante de ce temps pour l'etude de la philolo-gie classique comme science auxiliaire de l'histoire: l'universite de Breslau ou Mommsen, deja celebre, avait enseigne7. Apres ses etudes de philologie (1887), Kroll passera deux semestres a Berlin, ou il travaillera sous la direc-tion de Hermann Diels et Carl Robert, puis il sera promu a Breslau en 1891 avec une dissertation inaugurale sur les citations grecques et latines chez Symmaque8. C'est l'annee, souvenons-nous, ou Jahn publie son edition des extraits de Proclus. Kroll a 21 ans. Β rendra compte du travail de Jahn non sans une certaine condescendance (Kroll 1892a).

Grace a l'appui de Mommsen et dUsener, Kroll se rendra, l'annee meme de la publication de l'opuscule de Jahn, a Turin, Venise et Rome pour y explorer les fonds de manuscrits qui lui permettront d'ectire son De oraculis Chaldaicis10. La these dTiabilitation paraitra en 1894 avec (hasard d'imprimeur!) le meme nombre de pages que le De doctrina oraculorum Chaldaicorum de Jahn (78 p.).

Marie quatre fois et qua-tre fois veuf, il connut aussi la perte de plusieurs de ses enfants.

Inutile d'en dire davantage! 10. Un des grands resultats de cette recherche des temoins des OC aura ete aussi un nouveau dechiffrement, avec l'aide dTJsener, du palimpseste de Turin portant le commentaire anonyme sur le Parmenide de Platon (Kroll 1892). Kroll et Usener auront ete probablement les derniers lecteurs de ce manuscrit insigne, puisqu'il va disparaitre dans l'incendie de la bibliotheque de Turin en 1904.

D'apres Valere, Archimede avait l'esprit concentre sur des figures geometriques (formas) qu'il dessinait sur le sol (in terram). Plusieurs soldats de l'armee romaine (qui assiegeait Syracuse, 212 av. n. e.) firent alors irruption chez lui pour piller. Mais, comme les soldats avaient ordre d'epargner Archimede et de le ramener au general Romain, l'uri d'eux lui demanda qui il etait. Celui-ci absorbe dans ses raisonnements repondit: Noli, obsecro, istum disturbare («Garde-toi, je t'en prie, de le [istum] detruire»). Devant ce refus d'obtemperer et de declarer son identite, le soldat tue le savant, de sorte qu'Ar-chimede, «egorge, mela les lignes de son art a son propre sang» (obtruncaius sangutno suo artis suae lineamenta conjudit).

Les aires d'Stude La methodologie de la recherche sur les OC a la fin du xix® s., telle qu'elle est mise en ceuvre par Jahn et Kroll, reste d'actualite car il n'est d'autre fagon d'etudier une litterature fragmentaire que l'examen de la tradition textuelle, d'un cote, et l'analyse des contextes citateurs, de l'autre21. La premiere methode releve de la philologie, la seconde de l'hermeneutique. L'apport particulier de Kroll - au-dela de la question de l'etablissement de la totalite des fragments - a ete de situer les OC dans le cadre de l'idee de Mommsen, selon laquelle le melange des peuples et de leurs religions a partir de l'epoque helienistique s'etait traduit en philosophie par la fusion des Ecoles et la necessite de classi-fier. Au π* s. de notre ere, les OC sont un bassin collecteur du renouvellement de la religiosite par un melange de stoicisme, de platonisme, d'Aristote, de pythagorisme, dTiermetisme et de religions orientates: eulte du feu venu du monde iranien mazdeen, veneration d'Hecate propre a l'Asie mineure, religion solaire qui serait l'apport de la Syrie. Kroll donne a cet effort vers le syncretisme, dont les OC sont tributaires, le nom de «gnose paienne22». Or, si !'interpretation des fragments par les contextes citateurs s'est developpee de fagon si intense depuis, du fait d'une plus grande accessibilite aux ceuvres des neoplatoniciens23, en revanche la perspective de Kroll 1894, selon laquelle !'element proprement «mystique transcendant» des OC serait a chercher du 21. L'organisation materielle de ces Oracles en vers reste a ce jour inconnue.

Lewy les a repertories dans le ch. VII des Chaldaean Oracles and Theurgy, sans s'y interesser davantage. L'idee de Kroll ne manquait pourtant pas de pertinence. La «gnose paienne», selon lui ferment des OC, avait pour fondement doctrinal les liens qu'il percevait a juste titre entre Numenius la litterature juive et les gnostiques24, de sorte que les OC se trouverent inscrits par lui dans une sorte de triptyque interpretatif qui se lisait de gauche a droite selon la diachronie: Numenius - OC - Jamblique et les neoplatoniciens posterieurs25. L'originalite de Hans Lewy a consiste a lire le triptyque en sens inverse a partir du volet de droite, celui des citateurs et interpretes neoplatoniciens des oracles (ch. II-VI). Cette methode a eu pour consequence d'elargir conside-rablement les aires d'etude. Preoccupe de savoir ce que ces oracles etaient devenus, comment ils avaient ete compris et a quoi 11s avaient servi, Lewy etendit l'analyse des doctrines vers le domaine des pratiques et prolongea ainsi la metaphysique en direction de la theurgie. En devenant une sorte de fixa-teur ou de catalyseur de la diversite des croyances et des rites, le platonisme selon Lewy se substituait, de fait, a la gnose orientalisante selon Kroll.

Dodds 1960, 11 parlera, de son cote, de chainon manquant: «It has always seemed a little odd that the Oracles, composed under Marcus Aurelius, should have remained unknown until Porphyry discovered them, perhaps more than a century later. If I am right, the missing link will be Numenius, whose strong influence on Porphyry is attested by Proclus; Plotinus will have ignored the Oracles, recognising them for the theosophical rubbish that they are. And I see no chronological difficulty in supposing that Numenius was writing in the time of Marcus (161-180) or even a litde later.» Kramer 1967, 27-28. 66-68 est dans la lignee de Dodds: son expose de la metaphysique des OC est construit dans le cadre du sys-teme de Numenius.

It could even have been a two-way traffic, since so far as our scanty knowledge goes Numenius and Julianus may well have been contemporaries.»"},{"pageNumber":765,"pageContent":"739 LES ORACLES CHALDAIQUES 1891-2011 une collection d'oracles propre a la devotion privee des theurges, s'agrandit de domaines particuliers, jusqu'alors cloisonnes par les disciplines universitaires: litterature oraculaire publique revelee par l'epigraphie des derniers sanctuai-res pai'ens en activite (Apollon: Claros, Didymes), pratiques et hymnes dites «magiques» rassemblees par les papyrologues (Eitrem, Preisendanz), ceuvres de toutes sortes d'ecrivains et de poetes greco-latins se referant aux autorites de Platon, d'Hermes ou d'Orphee (nouvelles editions et traductions du cor-pus hermetique et des commentateurs neoplatoniciens). Lewy a ete le premier a percevoir les OC comme l'expression d'une religion harmonieuse, faite de dogmes et de pratiques religieuses, melange de scolastique et de theurgie, ou l'on se plaisait autant a classifier sans cesse les ordres triadiques qu'a entrer en contact avec le divin26. Selon la jolie formule de Jahn, les OC ont ete «comme une sorte de pepiniere de philosophie neoplatonicienne27».

L'une de ces dernieres est certainement la litterature ora-culaire. Bien qu'il se soit enhardi jusqu'a identifier comme chaldaiques des oracles issus des collections theosophiques (ch. I), Lewy avait bien vu qu'il y avait de ce cote-la d'autres thematiques a mettre en place, ne serait-ce que pour comprendre le cas Porphyre et la situation de La Philosophie a tirer des oracles.

L'oracle de Claros a trois temoins (Theosophie, Lactance, inscription d'Oinoanda), realise par Livrea 1998 et plus recem-ment par Chuvin 2009b, est un bon exemple d'une formulation renouvelee du divin sans qu'on puisse la definir par une etiquette particuliere d'ecole philosophique. On peut en dire autant de l'oracle latin anonyme sur le sacrifice anagogique, exhume par Stephane Toulouse d'ceuvres augustiniennes et sur lequel il a fourni une etude fouillee (Toulouse 2001): Non hi qui pecudum pertractant corque iecurque, / Sed quorum emundat prudens praecordia uirtus, / Excludenspositam subter labem uitiorum, / Remigo poterunt caelum penetrare secundo, / Aethera nec uacuum laetis transcurrere pennis; «Ce ne sont pas ceux qui sondent avec attention le cceur et le foie des betes, / Mais ceux dont la vertu de prudence purifie les entrailles, / Fermant l'acces a la souillure sous-jacente des vices, / Qui ont pu penetrer dans le del, d'un heureux battement d'ailes, / Et traverser dans le vol joyeux l'ether qui n'est pas vide» (texte et traduction de Toulouse 2001, 170). Ce type d'oracle theologique est bien dans la preoccupation des antiquisants platoniciens amateurs d'OC et faisant fleche de tout bois (ainsi Lydus, De mensibus, TV"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"MICHEL· TARDIEU 740 par les Peres de l'Eglise sous etiquette gnostique ou conserves en copte dans les Nag Hammadi Codices, sortes de conservatoire ou de laboratoire philo-sophiques.

Cette documentation nouvelle per-met d'ouvrir le chantier des materiaux, tant metaphoriques que conceptuels consideres jusque-la comme specifiques du chaldaisme ou du neoplatonisme naissant, alors qu'ils sont seulement des remplois (gnostiques, chaldaiques, patristiques, ou neoplatoniciens) de la religiosite commune30. L'elargissement des aires d'etude se juge aussi a l'exploration des auteurs latins, Chretiens et pai'ens, parmi lesquels un temoignage surprenant chez Ammien Marcellin31.

La religiosite des OC n'est pas specifique d'un courant particulatisable comme platonicien, medioplatonicien, neopktonicien. Ces etiquettes classificatoires sont peu utiles. En outre, k methode de salut dans les OC est comme chez les philosophes et les gnostiques une voeqa, %σία opposee aux sacri-fices traditionnels et a la divination. Pareillement, la subordination du demiurge au dieu supreme n'est pas specifique d'un courant particulier, elle est commune a toute la religiosite (gnostiques, OC, Numenius, neoplatonisme). 31. Ainsi Clerc 1989 voit avec pertinence dans les formules de la notice d'Ammien Marcellin a l'annee 363 (Res gestae, XXIII 6, 25) relative a la Chaldee (Chaldaeorum regio) — «terre nouraciere de la philosophie ancienne, ainsi que le rappellent ceiis en qui a resplendi la veritable Foi pour parler au nom des dieux (trad, pers.)» (altrix philosophiae ueteris, ut memorant ίρή apud quos ueridica uaticinandi fides eluxit) -, non pas une profession de foi a l'astrologie babylonienne (ainsi chez J. Fontaine, Ammten. Histoire, t 4, Commentaire, Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 1977, p. 77), mais un hommage a la theurgie et aux philosophes commentateurs des Oracles chaldaiques, autrement dit Jamblique et Julien. «La Foi fondatrice de Verite (c'est-a-dire opposee a la foi credule des chretiens) pour parler au nom des dieux (rendre des oracles, prophetiser)»: la formulation evoque la theorie chaldalque Foi-Verite-[-Amour], mais peut renvoyer aussi a 1'Abraham pai'en des neoplatoniciens."},{"pageNumber":767,"pageContent":"741 LES ORACLES CHALDAIQUES 1891-2011 Aux yeux des neoplatoniciens, les OC constituaient le sommet de l'ensei-gnement et de la philosophie. Comment s'explique un tel prestige? Franz Cumont mettait en avant deux raisons: la presence d'«une forme honorable de la magie, une sorcellerie clarifiee», autrement dit la theurgie. Ensuite, l'ensemble de la theologie des OC offtirait, selon Cumont, «une similitude frappante avec le systeme philosophique de Plotin», et d'ajouter: «C'est cer-tainement cette analogie qui leur a valu le prestige incroyable dont ils jouirent chez les neoplatoniciens32.» La premiere raison est concevable, la seconde pose le probleme de la connaissance des Oracles par Plotin, generalement rejetee33. H.-D. Saffrey, a son tour, avance trois raisons de l'accueil des OC chez les neoplatoniciens. Ceux-ci auraient ete seduits par la doctrine de Platon presentee par ces Oracles, ensuite leur contenu philosophique etait gage sur une revelation oraculaire, enfin les philosophes post-plotiniens ressentaient le besoin pour 1'ame humaine de recourir a une aide surnaturelle, la theurgie, pour aller a Dieu34. Ces motivations sont bien reelles mais je les formulerai autrement. Pour les neoplatoniciens, les OC constituaient d'abord un livre religieux, apportant, en partie en reference aux explications du Timet, les elements essentiels d'un recit sacre sur l'origine du monde et sa fin, et fournissant par la une solution au sort des ames et de soi-meme apres la mort en assurant le salut, ou purification, des ce bas-monde par la theurgie. La metaphore de Livre saint ou de Bible, qui a ete appliquee aux OC par les chercheurs moder-nes et contemporains depuis Kroll et Jahn, est done pleinement justifiee35. Ensuite, aux yeux des philosophes grecs, le prestige de ce livre religieux venait essentdellement de ce qu'il se presentait comme un monument de leur propre culture, e'est-a-dire en vers et sous la forme reconnaissable de ce que tous les gens cultives connaissaient par cceur et que l'on se recitait depuis l'enfance, une poesie homerique, un recueil compose des memes hexametres que ceux d'Homere et dans le langage immediatement identifiable comme homerique, 32.

Enfin, la methode de salut proposee dans ce recueil oraculaire est une vote universelk specifique de la philosophie barbare, c'est-a-dire de ce qu'il y a de plus ancien et de plus respectacle, aux fondements memes de la philosophie greeque37. Les oracles relevant de la philosophie barbare ne sont pas attaches, en effet, a des sane-tuaires publics, multiples et parfois localisables (ceux-ci ne sont pas exclus de la reflexion de Porphyre dans la Philosophie a tirer des oracles), ils relevent seulement de la religion privee, qui s'occupe de disposer les images divines a l'interieur du sanctuaire unique de soi-meme, temple sans murs ni clerge ni sacrifices. D'ou la designation du recueil comme «chaldalque», c'est-a-dire ainsi que l'avait bien compris Jahn, sans acception ethnique, ni babylonienne, ni perse, ni syrienne, mais repondant a une conception moniste de l'univers et theologiquement monotheiste ou abrahamite38: le poeme chaldalque se posait ainsi en courant rival du christianisme et en replique scripturaire aux Ecritures chretiennes. L'image du sacre dans les OC n'est guere aisee a restituer car elle nous est parvenue a l'etat fragmentaire et brouiBee par la reception neoplatonicienne. La recherche recente (H. Seng, L. SaudelH, A. Lecerf) a le merite d'attirer l'attention sur ce morcellement d'image. Cette troisieme edition des Chaldaean Oracles and Theurgy, entreprise a la demande repetee de l'lnstitut d'Etudes augustiniennes, a pour but de contribuer a l'effort de cette recherche actuelle. La forme que j'ai adoptee dans les divers inventaires devait etre necessairement 36. Ces mots nouveaux et obscurs contribuaient a aureoler par une sorte de magie le prestige des OC. Sur l'usage des vers homeriques dans les papyrus magiques, voir l'etude de Derek Collins, «The Magic of Homeric Verses», Classical Philology, 103 (2008), 211-236; pour !'utilisation prophylactique de vers d'Homere en codicologie: Zago 2010,137 η. 1 et p. 245-247. 37. Ainsi, les \"theologiens\" grecs, Orphee, Linos, Musee, sont dits avoir ete a l'ecole des \"theologiens\" pheniciens et egyptiens; Homere, les Sept Sages et Pythagore doivent leur formation aux Mages, Prophetes et Brahmanes; Democrite a converti en ethique les λόγοι des Babyloniens; Platon fut l'interprete de la philosophie egyptienne. L'incorporeite de Dieu et le monotheisme sont des avancees dues a la philosophie barbare (Theophraste ap. Porphyre, De abstinentia, II 26, 3; Numenius, fr. lb des Places). 38. L'abrahamisme comme fait culturel pai'en fait partie de 1 ,inductio Chaldaeorum de la «voie universelle», par rapport a laquelle Porphyre prend ses distances dans le De regressu animae (fr. 12 Bidez = 302F Smith). Dans le meme sens, voir le temoignage releve par Clerc 1989 concernant Ammien Marcellin. Sur la via universalis, Castelletti 2006, 78-79 (les OC dans la recherche d'une voie universelle du salut). Une reflexion nouvelle sur la philosophie barbare est le reexamen du fr. 160 dans la perspective du debat historique sur la reincarnation des ames humaines dans des corps d'animaux (Castelletti 2006,306-308).
