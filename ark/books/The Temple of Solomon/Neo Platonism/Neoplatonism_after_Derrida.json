Realizing that this term overlaps with “Platonism,” “ChristianPlatonism,” and so forth, we are uncertain whether the intellectualphenomenon to which it corresponds should be defined by theunknown deity of religious belief or by the allegorical theories of lit-erary commentators, by the unitary first principle of classical thoughtor by the Trinitarian God of the Church Fathers. From anotherviewpoint, the term “Neoplatonism” seems abundantly clear. By con-centrating on the “Platonism” element in the compound term, weassume that the intellectual phenomenon to which the latter refersmust involve the transmission of Plato’s own teachings about the sep-aration of the intelligible and sensible worlds, the existence of tran-scendent Forms or Ideas beyond space and time which correspondto logical universals or ethical standards, and the immortality of thehuman soul.Now it would be difficult to argue that “Neoplatonism” as a termwhich is simultaneously so obscure and so clear should not be astimulus to thought in such a hermeneutically self-conscious age asour own. Yet there seems to be a factor which would provide a dis-incentive for such a project. That is, that Neoplatonism as both ahistorical and futural possibility of thinking seems inextricably asso-ciated with the doctrine that Being (on, esse) is primal—the tran-scendent Forms represent Being in Plato’s dialogues, the hypostasisof Intellect constitutes Being in Plotinus’ Neoplatonism, and the GodofExodusconstitutes Being in its Augustinian counterpart. How couldone imagine thinking productively with philosophers of Being in anepoch where—as a result of Heidegger’s decisive critique of “ontothe-ology”—the word “Being” must either be crossed out or avoidedentirely?11The term “ontotheology” employed by Heideggerians in order to characterize"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"A reading of Neoplatonism in relation to Derrida may provideorientation on this question. The latter philosopher is probably uniquein supplying us not only with a paradigm of writing compellingly inthe aftermath of Heideggerian thinking but also with evidence of acontinuous engagement—sometimes explicit and sometimes implicit—with texts originating in the Neoplatonic milieu. Derrida’s interesta particular epoch in the withdrawal of Being has been a subject of debate inFrance for some time and more recently also in the English-speaking world. Thisepoch is where metaphysics considers (in an “Aristotelian” sense) a. beings as suchandb. the supreme being (see Heidegger’s “Introduction to ‘What is Metaphysics?,’”trans. W. Kaufmann in Pathmarks, ed. W. McNeill (Cambridge: Cambridge U.P.,1998), pp. 287–8), and (in a “Hegelian” sense) a. beings as such and b. beings asa whole (see his “The Onto-Theo-Logical Constitution of Metaphysics,” in Identityand Difference, trans. J. Stambaugh (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), pp. 54–6),these two interpretations often occurring in combination. For present purposes, themost important point to observe is that it is Neoplatonism which for a variety ofphilosophical and historical reasons tends to function as the catalyst in such dis-cussions of ontotheology. Although the present author’s viewpoint on this questioncan be left to emerge in the course of Neoplatonism after Derrida, we may note herein the spirit of a preface that demonstrations of Heidegger’s limitations as a histo-rian of philosophy and of the problematic application of the term “ontotheology”itself have not blunted the impact of Heidegger’s main philosophical arguments: 1.that European thought has always considered what can be determined accordingto the fixity of presence as somehow primary, and 2. that we must counter this byattempting to think temporality in a more radical way and to loosen the strangle-hold of objectifying and propositional discourse. For a thorough documentation ofthe debates about ontotheology see the recent publications of Wayne Hankey, “ThePostmodern Retrieval of Neoplatonism in Jean-Luc Marion and John Milbank andthe Origins of Western Subjectivity in Augustine and Eriugena,” in Hermathena165(1998), pp. 9–70; Cent ans de Néoplatonisme en France.

The development ofthat interest is certainly shown by his thoughtful readings of pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and of Augustine’s autobiographical con-fession in the early nineteen-eighties, all of this taking place incombination with a continuous study of Plato’s dialogues themselveswhich is revealed in a series of works from “Plato’s Pharmacy,”through the “Envois” of The Post Card, to “Khòra.” One should prob-ably concede that several countervailing tendencies of his personaloutlook decisively restrained Derrida from entering into greater inti-macy with the Neoplatonists. These include his commitments to acertain radicalism in the ethical sphere and to the cultural legacy ofJudaism from which the metaphysical Hellenizing of the Neoplatonistsdiffers markedly. Nevertheless, a reading of Neoplatonism in relationto Derrida is historically justified and philosophically promising.An adequate understanding of the relation between Neoplatonismand post-Heideggerian thought would seem to be a prerequisite forphilosophical discussions of the kind which took place recently betweenDerrida himself and Jean-Luc Marion.2This well-documented debatecenters on the relation between the “Above-Being” and the “Gift”in the context of pseudo-Dionysius’ thought: two notions fallingsquarely within the domain of Neoplatonism albeit extended in aspecifically patristic or Christian manner. It shows Derrida as defend-ing a viewpoint in which the Dionysian huperousionmaintains a con-tinuity with the Being of ontotheology and somehow remains anobject of affirmation in the constative sphere so that any excess of“givenness” which it might involve would be the presencing given-ness of a metaphysical principle rather than the givenness always tocome of the impossible possibility. Marion, however, is advocatinga position in which the huperousionof Dionysius exhibits a clear breakfrom ontotheological Being and can be conceived neither as theobject of affirmation nor as an object of negation but only with2For this debate see Jean-Luc Marion, “In the Name.

Caputo and Thomas Carlson respectively,we submit that the debate insofar as it depends on a Neoplatonicthinker like pseudo-Dionysius remains insufficiently contextualized. Itis therefore the aim of the present study to set important discussionsof this kind on a more secure basis.For someone attempting to think the application of Neoplatonicthought after the demise of ontotheology in relation to Derrida’swriting, two basic strategies seem possible. According to the firstapproach, we may endeavour to disclose “Neoplatonic” elementswithin the Derridean enterprise: a process which especially involvesfinding atemporalizing elements in a temporal phenomenon. Therefollows shortly an example of implementing this strategy in whichthe semiotic square utilized in discoursive analysis by those struc-turalist critics whom Derrida views as crypto-Platonists will have itsapplication extended from the semantic to the non-semantic sphere.It will therefore be possible to show that an elaborate set of figuresbased on this “(a)semiotic square” not only constitutes the architec-tonic of Neoplatonic thought but also supplies the formula forDerridean readings, and not only governs the hierarchical emana-tion of causal principles in metaphysics but also the axiological inver-sion of asymmetrical contraries in discourse.If the first strategy will be concerned with disclosing “Neoplatonic”elements within the Derridean enterprise, a second strategy will be concerned with the disclosing of “Derridean” elements withinNeoplatonic thought: a process which conversely implies finding tem-poralizing elements in an atemporal sphere. But one of the maindifferences between Neoplatonism and Derrida is the former’s pre-dominant emphasis upon constative discourse and the latter’s equalemphasis on the constative and the non-constative. Therefore, thedisclosure of “Derridean” elements within Neoplatonic thought willbest be achieved by bringing the non-constative aspects of Neoplatonisminto relief. There also follows shortly an example of implementingthis strategy in which a particularly close relation between perfor-mative utterance, non-propositional discourse, and textual juxtaposi-tion will be established with respect to Neoplatonic thought.Derrida published three essays entitled “Passions,” “Sauf le Nom,”xiipreface"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"and “Khòra” under separate covers in 1993. According to a noticeand a detachable insert which appeared identically in each volume,the three items, although readable as distinct works, may be viewedas constituting a single “Essay on the Name.” Given that this trip-tych elaborates many themes derived from the Platonic tradition, weshall employ it as the basis of Neoplatonism after Derridawhich willtherefore comprise an introduction dealing with general questions, acommentary on “Sauf le Nom,” an interlude dealing with a differentbut related question, a reading of “Khòra,” an extension of the com-mentary on “Sauf le Nom,” and a reading of “Passions.”3The chap-ters of our study need not be read precisely in the sequence givenhere. Although the first chapter numbered should probably also bethefirst chapter read, users of the book who wish to experimentwith the different possible orders of reading the remaining materi-als, and with the various possible hermeneutical standpoints pro-duced thereby, are invited and indeed encouraged to do so.Proceeding according to the strict pagination of the volume, thereader will find: 1. Derrida reads (Neo-) Platonism.This chapter has twopurposes. First, it provides a double discussion of the transmissionof (Neo-) Platonism and of Derrida’s reading of the transmission inwhich the highlighting of this tradition within the history of Europeanphilosophy itself constitutes a deconstructive approach to the latter.Secondly, it gives an illustration of the practice of textual juxtaposi-tion which emerges in chapter 4.2 as an important element in thedeconstruction of Neoplatonism; 2. What is Called ‘Negative Theology’?is a study of the relation between Neoplatonism and “negative the-ology” suggested by Derrida’s reading. The “Neoplatonic” elementsrelevant to Derrida’s enterprise are here disclosed through the appli-cation of the (a)semiotic square on the one hand to the Neoplatonichypostases of the One, Intellect, and Soul and on the other toDerridean general structures like DifferenceandTrace. It is argued thatDerrida’s failure to understand the overall significance of Neoplatonic3Since Derrida is nowadays so widely known in the English-speaking world,direct quotations from his principal works studied in this volume are given in Englishtranslation.

This chapter devel-ops within the context of Neoplatonism certain applications of thatfigure which we have termed the (a)semiotic square but which theNeoplatonists call remaining, procession, and reversion. Augustineshows in one of his earlier works that the third component of thisfigure consists of many superimposed operations of both a logicaland a hermeneutical kind;44.1.Of the Abyss continues the applica-tion of the (a)semiotic square to the Derridean general structuresbegun in chapter 2.

The notion of performativity is now intensified by the distinc-tion between performative utterance and performative experience.So far we have been discussing the content of this study. Regardingits form, we should briefly note first, that in composing our text onthe level of language a decision has been taken to proceed by writ-ing not in the polysemous style of Derrida but in the monosemousstyle of Neoplatonism; and secondly, that in composing the text onthe level of concept a further decision has been taken to proceednot be deconstructing Neoplatonism directly but by juxtaposing decon-struction and Neoplatonism. If both these decisions seem to implythe presentation of Derrida’s discourse in a “Neoplatonic” manner,4This chapter may usefully be read not only in the position stated here but alsoat the end of the sequence.xivpreface"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"it must be recalled that our “Neoplatonic” presentation is alreadyaffected by the “deconstructive” tendencies of textual juxtaposition,the reduction of propositional argumentation, and performative utter-ance.5Now an adequate justification for these decisions will emergein the reading of this volume and indeed, given the importance ofthe performative element just mentioned, should only emerge in thereading of the volume. Nevertheless, it is perhaps advisable to cor-rect at this point the potential misunderstanding of a reader whomight ask what central thesis regarding the parallels between Neo-platonism and Derrida is being advanced in the present work.Obviously, the answer is that there is no centeredthesis—such a thingwould be inconsistent with the deconstructive subtext of the Neoplatonicpresentation outlined above—although there are numerous decenteredtheses to be found. Having read the entire work, the more philo-sophical reader will perhaps appreciate this absence of a centre, andthe more academic reader at least the plurality of explanations.London, England and San Juan, Puerto Rico, March 2006.5These two decisions are intimately connected given that the juxtapositionalmethod, by transferring the disruptive element peculiar to deconstruction from themicro-structure of words and phrases to the macro-structure of paragraphs and seg-ments, permits the coexistence of polysemy within a ratiocinativephilosophical text.prefacexv"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEDERRIDA READS (NEO-) PLATONISM1Our theme will be that of deconstructing the text of philosophy oralternatively that of Derrida reading (Neo-) Platonism.2A more pre-cise account of what follows would, however, stress the simultaneityof the generic and specific aims.The “text” which is to be deconstructed with respect to philoso-phy corresponds not to that of a book—the everyday usage of theterm—but to that which exceeds the book—a peculiarly Derrideanconception.3In the latter case, text is understood as a container ofspaces each of which, if folded back upon itself, exceeds its own lim-its—text, space, and fold therefore indicating various aspects of theunderlying idea of reference to the Other.4According to Derrida’susage, text is quasi-synonymous with trace and writing. In differentintertextual situations, “trace” can be delineated in relation to thetranscendental phenomenology of Husserl where its connotation oftemporality is revealed, in the light of Lévinas’ ethical thought wherethe reference to the Other emerges most strikingly, and in relationto the psychoanalytic teaching of Freud where its connotation ofnon-causality is uppermost.5For Derrida, the handling of writing isperhaps more complicated than the handling of trace. “Writing” 1Earlier versions of this chapter were read at the University of Washington,Seattle (Solomon Katz Lecture) on 20 February 2001 and at the University of NotreDame (Philosophy Department Colloquium) on 11 April 2003.

For example, the specialized meaning of theterms is frequently suggested by introducing them with prefixes as“arche-trace” and “arche-writing.”7The possibility of metonymicallysubstituting the terms for one another and with terms like “difference”and “supplement” is also indicated.8One should also briefly men-tion some controversies surrounding trace, writing, and the like. Towhat extent can they be understood as “infra-structures?”9To whatextent are they “conditions of possibility” in the Kantian sense?10Inanticipation, one could also mention the link between trace, pres-ence, and absence established by Derrida in his reading of Plotinusthe Neoplatonist.The “philosophy” with respect to which the text is to be decon-structed is alternatively styled “metaphysics,” “logocentrism,” and“ontotheology.”11Primarily under the influence of Heidegger at thispoint, Derrida discerns a unity of a profound type underlying thehistory of western thought, although for Heidegger this unity repre-sents the tradition running (roughly) from Parmenides to Nietzschewhereas for Derrida it is in the tradition running (roughly) fromParmenides to Hegel where the unity resides.12This philosophical6For a discussion of writing see OG, pp. 6–10.7See OG, p. 56ff.

See OG, pp. 144–5.9Use of the term “infrastructure” here was advocated in Rodolphe Gasché, TheTain of the Mirror. Derrida and the Philosophy of Reflection(Cambridge, Mass.: HarvardU.P., 1986), p. 7, etc. Although it was originally suggested in his own work, Derridahas tended to avoid the ontological and transcendental connotations of such a term,preferring to speak of “most general structures...of textuality in general.” See“This Strange Institution Called Literature: An Interview with Jacques Derrida,” inJacques Derrida, Acts of Literature, ed. D. Attridge (New York and London: Routledge,1992), pp. 70–72.10Reference to “conditions of possibility” in this context was made by RichardRorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1989),pp. 123–4.

These are first, the primacy of constative discourse and theview of thinking and being associated with it15and secondly, the pre-occupation with oppositional structures and the similarly associatedviews of thinking and being.16The construction upon such under-pinnings is particularly evident in the cases of the Platonic dialecticand of the Aristotelian logic which develops and corrects it.Although Derrida accepts the Heideggerian notion of Being aspresence together with its implications for understanding the historyof philosophy, there is a certain shift of perspective. For Heidegger,the issue is closely connected with that of the difference—called atvarious points the “ontico-ontological difference,” the “ontologicaldifference,” and the “dif-ference”)—between Being and beings, whereBeing names the “X” sought by thinking and beings the first prin-ciples sought by metaphysics, where the difference between Being13Throughout this chapter “Being” (usually capitalized) corresponds to the Platonic“Being” (on) rather than to the Heideggerian “Being” (Sein). From Heidegger’s view-point, this Platonic Being is “ontic” in character.14See OG, pp. 3, 10–26. For Plato see further Jacques Derrida, “The DoubleSession,” inDI, pp. 184–94; for Heidegger also “Ousia and Grammè. Note on aNote from Being and Time,” in MP, pp. 29–67.15In this chapter, I shall use the terms “constative” and “performative” to sig-nify discourse which attempts to state certain truths without embodying those truthsin the mode of utterance and discourse which attempts to state its truths whileembodying those truths in the mode of utterance respectively. The term “perfor-mative” has had a complex history in J.L. Austin, J.-F. Lyotard, and Derrida himself.16This issue is treated especially in Jacques Derrida, “Structure, Sign, and Playin the Discourse of the Human Sciences,” in WD, pp. 278–80 (where the contextis the question of centering) and “Tympan,” in MP, p. x ff.

Derridawould find difference not only between Being and beings but alsobetween the disclosure and the concealment, the former differencealone being explicit in Heidegger’s writings.17After dealing with the “text” and the “philosophy,” what is meantby “the text of philosophy” can now be stated. In short, what hasoccurred in the history of the West is that the emphasis on the meta-physics of presence has been accompanied by a reduction in the sta-tus of writing. Paraphrasing this in specifically Derridean language,one might say that the sense of writing has been modified—in responseto the metaphysics of presence—from that of arche-writing to thatof everyday writing.18There is undoubtedly some empirical evidencefor the historical interpretation proposed here. This includes suchfactors as the Socratic-Platonic association of philosophy primarilywith oral discourse, the notion of language as primarily spoken andsecondarily written, and so forth.The “deconstruction of the text of philosophy” announced as atheme at the beginning of this chapter represents an attempt toreverse this situation. Although Derrida does not himself employ theterm with any frequency, Derridean commentators have established“deconstruction” as the name for the quasi-method19whereby thereader approaches what is to be read (i) through the selection of asingle detail or, perhaps more idiomatically in accordance with thesense of trace or track, a plurality of details in the object-text. Referringto this phase of the operation, Derrida speaks of remaining within17For these reasons, Derrida holds that his difference is “older than the onto-logical difference or than the truth of Being” (see “Différance,” in MP, p. 22). Agood analysis of this claim—together with discussion of the relevant Heideggeriantexts—can be found in Rodolphe Gasché, Inventions of Difference. On Jacques Derrida(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard U.P., 1994), pp. 100–103.18See passages listed in nn. 11–12, 14. See also OG, pp. 85–7 where Derridaconnects the devaluation of writing with the preoccupation with linear (alphabetic)writing. He argues that, if one admits the connection between linearity of languageand metaphysics of presence, then “the meditation upon writing and the decon-struction of the history of philosophy become inseparable.”19Derrida employs the term “deconstruction” in Of Grammatologyalthough it becomes less common in his later writings. On this question and on the rela-tion between “deconstruction” and the Husserlian “dismantling” (Abbau) and theHeideggerian “destruction” (Destruktion) see Gasché, The Tain of the Mirror, pp. 109–20. 4chapter one"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"the limits of a term or concept, of a “mimesis,” of the re-markingof that term (perhaps with emphasis upon the marking). A typicalinstance of the procedure would be to take one’s terms or conceptsas oppositions based on priority and posteriority (or superiority andinferiority): for example, literal and metaphorical or male and female.20The reader also approaches what is to be read (ii) through the dis-covery of one or more ambiguities or inconsistencies in the object-text. Referring to this phase of the operation, Derrida speaks oftransgressing the limits of a term or concept, of a “castration,” ofthe remarking of that term (clearly with emphasis shifted to the re-). A corresponding example of this procedure would be to reversethe priority and posteriority (or superiority and inferiority) of theopposed terms or concepts mentioned above.21The question of therelation between phases (i) and (ii) is of the greatest importance. InDerridean usage, this can sometimes be a semantic connection wherethe law of contradiction may be circumvented and sometimes a log-ical connection where the law of contradiction remains in force, thecase of combining or rejecting both the original and the reversedoppositions—the famous “double negation”—perhaps crossing theboundary between the semantic and the logical.22We have called deconstruction a “quasi-method.” This has beendone in order to emphasize that deconstruction is simultaneously atheory and a practice, therefore being from different viewpointsreducible and not reducible to a system and from different view-points disclosing and not disclosing definite truths. Although this issuecannot be taken up in detail here, it is worth noting that the sub-tle distinction between Derridean and Hegelian method (especiallyas regards the latter’s notion of Aufhebung (“sublation”)) resides in theprecise manner of applying the above criteria.20On “Re-mark” see Gasché, The Tain of the Mirror, pp. 217–24.21For the terms “castration” and “mimesis” see Jacques Derrida, Positions, trans.A.

Although the negativemoment is here named first, it is clear that the two operations are understood tobe simultaneous. 22There is no fully systematic presentation of deconstructive method in Derrida’sworks, undoubtedly because “method” is a problematic notion in this context. SeeJacques Derrida, “Letter to a Japanese Friend,” trans. D. Wood and A. Benjamin,in A Derrida Reader. Between the Blinds, ed. P. Kamuf (London and New York: Harvester,1991), pp. 270–76.

The more general answer to this question is that thistradition, which dominates western philosophical thought from theend of antiquity to the beginning of modernity but is often ignoredby historians of philosophy as they leap from Aristotle to Descartes,represents the posterior (inferior) term of a certain opposition. Therefore,to make it the central object of analysis is to perform a major decon-struction in itself. The more specific answer which is really a num-ber of specific answers is that the tradition superbly exemplifies theorientation to the question of Being as determined by presencetogether with the associated features of primacy of constative dis-course and preoccupation with oppositional structures, while simul-taneously inaugurating the destruction of that orientation togetherwith its associated features. Derrida has himself suggested all this ina footnote to his statement that metaphysics and language can sig-nal their own transgression: “Thus Plotinus (what is his status in thehistory of metaphysics and in the “Platonic” era, if one followsHeidegger’s reading?), who speaks of presence, that is, also of mor-phè, as the trace of non-presence, as the amorphous (to gar ikhnos touamorphou morphè). A trace which is neither absence nor presence, nor,in whatever modality, a secondary modality” (Margins of Philosophy,p. 66, n. 41).In the remainder of this chapter, we shall follow the guiding-threadof oppositional structure. It is undeniably the case that oppositionssuch as those of the ontological to the semantic and—within theontological domain—of the stable to the mutable, of the orderly tothe disorderly, of the causing to the caused, and of the intellectualto the non-intellectual, and—within the semantic sphere—of themonosemous to the polysemous form part of the common under-standing of Platonism. In a manner highly indicative of the com-mitment to metaphysics of presence which Heidegger and Derridahave identified, it is equally true that the priorities (or superiorities)attributed to the stable, the orderly, the causing, the intellectual, andthe monosemous over their opposites also form part of this prevail-ing interpretation. Through juxtaposition of Derrida’s reading ofPlatonism and Neoplatonism, of our reading of Derrida’s reading ofthose texts, and of our reading of Platonism and Neoplatonism, weshall attempt to exhibit the similarities and dissimilarities betweenphilosophemes and the simultaneous establishment and transgressionby philosophical writing of its own limits. The result of this endeav-6chapter one"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"our will be to some extent cognitive and perhaps a definite set ofactual propositions about Platonism or Derrida but to some extentinterpretative as rather the basis of an indefinite set of potentialpropositions. In other words, elements of temporalization and per-formativity must be embraced.Before turning to some passages in the writings of the Platonists,two preliminary clarifications should be made. The first concerns thehermeneutic decision to consider Plato himself in conjunction withthe tradition which he has created. The second concerns the hermeneu-tic decision to examine the ancient tradition of Platonism in con-junction with the medieval and even later traditions. In order tojustify these decisions, let us simply observe that the prevailing ten-dencies of interpreters to separate “Plato” from the Platonic tradi-tion and also to separate the ancient and the medieval traditions ofPlatonism depend in the first case upon a certain naivety regardingthe character of the interpretative process and in the second caseupon the importation into the study of certain external historio-graphical criteria. The naivety concerning interpretation resides inthe belief that at some point in time it was possible to distinguishadequately between what Plato thought and what his audience believedthat he thought. In fact, all historians know that disputes regardingthe master’s intentions began during his lifetime, were magnified inthe doctrinal division between the Old and the New Academiesreported by Cicero, and continue even today in universities wherecourses on Plato are given. The importation of external criteria isrepresented by the assumption that there is a significant break betweenancient and medieval Platonism with patristic Platonism being classedexclusively with the former or the latter according to the interpreter’sspecialization as a classicist or as a medievalist. In fact, the distinc-tion between ancient and medieval depends on elements of intellec-tual and socio-economic history quite extraneous to Platonic philosophyitself which as a consequence of its essentially transcendent and inte-riorized character maintains a striking degree of consistency throughouttime. Even the distinction between ancient and patristic and betweenpatristic and medieval requires caution, since many ancient Christianwriters preserved pagan philosophical materials intact, while the medie-val tradition itself contains classicizing, patristic, and scholastic ten-dencies side-by-side. Because of all these factors, we may refrain fromseparating “Plato” from the Platonic tradition and the ancient fromthe medieval tradition as though dealing with completely discrete units.derrida reads (neo-)platonism7"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Nevertheless, the (Neo-) Platonic tradition did represent a phe-nomenon which evolved through time, its changes taking place onmany levels and with different overlaps.23This scenario might besketched as follows:It is a peculiarity of the medieval as opposed to the ancient phaseof the transmission that Plato’s writings were largely unknown and,where known, known only in Latin translation. To be more precise,the translation into Latin of the Timaeustogether with the com-mentary attached to it by the fourth-century writer Calcidius wasvirtually the only channel for the direct transmission of Plato’s thoughtduring most of the medieval period. This translation is very accu-rate and the commentary, saturated with borrowings from the bestPlatonic and Aristotelian theorists writing in Greek during the pre-vious century, well composed. Apart from Calcidius, we find vari-ous writers who were influenced by Plato and, in the absence of theoriginal writings, able to pass on many of Plato’s teachings in someform. Among these indirect transmitters Augustine could not havedeveloped his remarkable blend of classical philosophy and Christianrevelation without the legacy bequeathed to him by the founder ofthe Academy. The elusive figure who at some time in the fifth cen-tury C.E. decided to present his own philosophical doctrine as thatof an early Pauline convert, the writer whom we name with con-cern for historical precision “Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite” butwhom medieval scholars simply called “Blessed Dionysius,” was like-wise totally dependent for his inspiration upon the tradition goingback to Plato himself. Boethius could not have composed his classicDe Consolatione Philosophiaeand an influential group of theological trea-tises without the Platonic legacy bequeathed to him in both Greekand Latin writings. Yet the Latin works of Augustine and Boethiusand the Latin translation of ps.-Dionysius—all of which were readcarefully throughout the Middle Ages—are not commensurate oreven comparable with Plato’s own texts. Moreover, the circumstancesof this transmission become even more complex in that, although23For analysis of the complex transfer between the ancient (Greek) and medieval(Latin) traditions of Platonism see Stephen Gersh, Middle Platonism and Neoplatonism.The Latin Tradition, vol. 1 (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1986), pp.1–50 and “The Medieval Legacy from Ancient Platonism,” in The Platonic Traditionin the Middle Ages, A Doxographic Approach, eds.

Here, we shall confine ourselves to citing threeexamples of (Neo-) Platonism: one from the ancient Greek traditionwhich had no influence on medieval Latin thought, one from theancient Greek tradition which had a major impact on the medievalLatin world, and one originating in the medieval Latin traditionitself.It will be recalled that two of the dualities identified as formingpart of the common understanding of Platonism were those of sta-ble and mobile and of orderly and disorderly, and that within thesedualities primacy of status was attributed to the stable and the orderlyrespectively. This conceptual structure is fundamental to Plato’sTimaeuswhere a cosmology is outlined in quasi-mythical form accord-ing to which a creative principle called the “Craftsman” reduces anapparently pre-existing material principle named the “Receptacle”which is characterized by mobility and disorder to a mathematicaland metaphysical order in line with an apparently pre-existing for-mal principle called the “Paradigm” whose essential features are sta-bility and order.24In late antiquity the interpretation of this text iscomplicated by the division of the stable and orderly principle intoa first principle called the Good and a second principle called Beingor Intellect, by the depiction of the relation between the Paradigmand the Receptacle—a relation to which the Craftsman is also assim-ilated—as a process of continuous emanation of power, and by thefusion of the mutable and disorderly principle with a “nature” calledMatter. It is this interpretation which underlies the important devel-opments on Plotinus’ treatise I. 8 “What Are and Whence ComeEvils?.” Here, the Receptacle is identified with matter, non-being,and evil and begins to lose its purely subordinate status first, becauseof the complex relation between matter and evil whereby the term24Plato, Timaeus29d–31a, 47e ff.derrida reads (neo-)platonism9"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"“matter” is primarily applied to the entire emanation with the excep-tion of its highest point but also to the lowest point of the emana-tion, while the term “evil” is primarily applied to the lowest pointof the emanation but also to the entire emanation with the excep-tion of some of its higher parts and secondly, because of the evenmore complex relation between being, non-being, good, and evil inwhich non-being (evil) is opposed to being as other than or contraryto being, and evil (non-being) is opposed to good within the sphereof being itself, the fact that evil can be called both non-being andbeing resulting from the homonymous rather than synonymous useof the term “being” in this context. It should be noted that the inter-pretation of the Receptacle as “place” has completely disappearedfrom this account.25(This paragraph will be called “Segment A”)Whereas in the previous example the nature of the implicit dual-ism has been modified by the increased role of the lower term, inthe next instance the character of the implicit dualism is transformedby a partial reversal of the higher and lower terms.It will be recalled that two further dualities identified as formingpart of the common understanding of Platonism were those of caus-ing and caused and of intellectual and non-intellectual respectively.This conceptual structure underlies an evolution traceable in lateancient texts whereby the teaching that the first principle is “beyondBeing” in Plato’s Republic26is developed into a doctrine that this prin-ciple is simultaneously beyond Being and coextensive with Being.The evolution takes place initially in Proclus’ interpretation of Plato’sParmenidesas teaching in the first hypothesis that certain attributesare denied of the One or Good and in its second hypothesis thatthese same attributes are affirmed of the henads or gods derivedfrom the One, denial and affirmation signifying transcendence of theattributes and immanence in the attributes on the part of the Oneand the henads respectively.27The evolution takes place subsequentlyin ps.-Dionysius’ interpretation of Proclus’ In Parmenidemas teaching25Plotinus, EnneadesI. 8 [51] eds. P. Henry and H.-R. Schwyzer, Paris-Bruxelles-Leiden: Desclée de Brouwer, etc. 1951–73. For the argument about emanation seeI. 8 [51] 3, 5–7, 15. The whole discussion should be compared with that in II. 4[12] where i. a distinction is made between intelligible matter (not associated withevil) and sensible matter (associated with evil); ii. Sensible matter is distinguishedclearly from “place.”26Plato, RepublicVI, 509b.27Plato, Parmenides137c–142a (first hypothesis), 142b–155e (second hypothesis).10chapter one"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"in the first hypothesis that certain attributes are denied of the Oneor Good and in the second hypothesis that these same attributes areaffirmed of the One or Good, denial and affirmation now signify-ing transcendence of the attributes and immanence in the attributeson the part of God who both “remains” and “proceeds” emana-tively.28Now the dialectical manipulation of these negative andaffirmative attributes which on the basis of the combined authorityof Plato and Scripture are called the “divine names,” is applied to“Being” and “Intellect” but not to “cause.” Therefore, given thatthe first principle becomes non-intellectual in the sense of transcendingintellect while it remains causal, we find a reversal of the traditionalpriority of the intellectual over the non-intellectual combined withthe maintenance of the traditional priority of the causing over thecaused.29(“Segment B”)The common conception of Platonism to which we have alreadyreferred includes not only the oppositions of stable and mutable, oforderly and disorderly, of causing and caused, and of intellectualand non-intellectual—which are ontological—but also the oppositionof monosemy and polysemy—which is semantic.30It is in this lattersphere that the lower term begins to lose its purely subordinate sta-tus in the view of certain ancient writers, since a preoccupation withformulating the criteria of monosemous discourse runs side by sidewith a willingness to pursue the ramifications of polysemous utter-ance. The requirement of a monosemous foundation of discourse isevident in the classical Platonic theory that stability of meaning ineveryday language depends upon the function of certain linguisticuniversals which are understood to be non-spatiotemporal “Forms”or “Ideas.” During late antiquity, these transcendent absolutes reap-pear in two slightly modified versions. First, we find the notion thatForms exist as thoughts in the mind of God in works like Augustine’sDe Quaestionibus Diversis LXXXIII, these Forms including the “Man”28See Proclus, Commentarius in ParmenidemVI. 1058–64 ed. V. Cousin (Paris, 1864)for the theory (after Plutarch of Athens and Syrianus) regarding the interpretationof the hypotheses; VI. 1064ff. for the interpretation of “hypothesis I” (the detaileddiscussion of the later hypotheses is not extant in Proclus’ commentary).29See ps.-Dionysius, De Divinis Nominibus, ed. B.R. Suchla (Berlin-New York: DeGruyter, 1990), 7. 2, 868B-7. 3, 872B. The Dionysian interpretation of Proclus’theory is discussed in Stephen Gersh, From Iamblichus to Eriugena. An Investigation ofthe Prehistory and Evolution of the Pseudo-Dionysian Tradition(Leiden: Brill, 1978), p. 153ff.30See Plato, Cratylus385e–391a (monosemy); 391d ff., 423b–434a (polysemy).derrida reads (neo-)platonism11"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"and “Horse” which are the transcendent principles of natural sub-stances such as men and horses.31Secondly, there is the notion thatForms exist as attributes of God in works like Augustine’s De ImmortalitateAnimi where Forms such as “Being,” “Life,” and “Intellect” are thetranscendent principles of existing, living, and intellectual things.32These two formulations are often present in the same author or text,and are transmitted in combination to the medieval world. The pos-sibility of a polysemous expansion of discourse is suggested in theancient grammarians’ techniques of etymological and allegorical inter-pretation. In the former case, a word under review might be sub-jected to addition, subtraction, or modification of its components,each of which could then denote a single object. In the latter case,the word being studied does not undergo decomposition and recom-position but denotes a multiplicity of objects distinguished as literaland figurative senses. That these methods are often practiced in com-bination is illustrated by the late ancient writer Macrobius’ Saturnaliawhere the name Apollodenotes rather abstractly that which is “notmany” by division into a(negative prefix) + pollònand that whichis “from the many” by reduplication as apo(preposition) + pollòn,but also more concretely signifies the Olympian deity in the literalsense, the physical sun in a first figurative sense, and the metaphysicalprinciple of the sun in a further figurative sense.33(“Segment C”)It is perhaps by now apparent that a proper understanding of therelation between Plato and Platonism and between ancient andmedieval Platonism is a pre-requisite for the adequate comprehen-sion of those issues—both ontological and semantic—which are oftenviewed by historians as specific either to Plato, or to ancient Platonism,or to medieval Platonism. Although an exhaustive analysis of theprocess of textual transmission from Greek into Latin would be nec-essary in order to grasp fully the relation between different stages ofthe Platonic tradition, it is hoped that the brief observations and31Augustine, De Diversis Quaestionibus LXXXIII, qu. 46, ed.

Clearly we have already cast some light on theontological questions associated with Platonism by considering laterdiscussions of the material principle and of the relation between neg-ative and affirmative theologies, and some light on the semantic ques-tions associated with Platonism by considering the later techniquesof etymology and allegorism.At this point, it will be instructive to turn to the modern readingof (Neo-) Platonism which we have chosen to discuss. Having ear-lier concluded that the real issues have frequently been obscured bymodern criticism of the historiographical kind, it is pleasing to finda contemporary author whose philosophical agenda has brought manyessential matters into focus. Indeed, Jacques Derrida has revealed innumerous essays written since that late 1960s—one thinks of “Del’économie restreinte à l’économie générale,” “La double séance,”“La pharmacie de Platon,” the “Envois” of La Carte Postale de Platon à Freud et au-delà, “Khòra”, and “Comment ne pas parler—Dénégations”—a sustained interest in questions pertinent to thePlatonic tradition.34With perhaps one or two exceptions, Derridahas not directly addressed in their original context the questionswhich we have been rehearsing. However, a series of accidents hasoccurred which he would say where not just chancesbut mes chances(méchant) and which Plotinus and Augustine would say were accidentsreintegrated within providence. This makes it possible to have Derridaat least indirectly address the Platonic tradition through a juxtapo-sition of texts.We may begin by revisiting the question of textual transmissionin the light of Derrida’s discussion of information-transfer in the essay“Envois.”35Although this substantial text is less a statement of theory34See Jacques Derrida, “From Restricted to General Economy. A HegelianismWithout Reserve,” in WD, pp. 251–77 and DS, pp. 173–226. For the other pas-sages see below. There are some earlier discussions of Derrida’s relation to Plato,although these could be described as “preliminary” at best. See Jasper P. Neel,Plato, Derrida, and Writing(Carbondale: Southern Illinois U.P., 1988), Catherine H.Zuckert, Postmodern Platos.

In the first place, Derrida establishes a schema ormodel according to which the process of communication takes placebetween a writer who is both present and absent in different waysand a reader who is similarly both present and absent. The actualprocess of communication is described by means of certain refer-ences to the postcard—a quasi-concept representing transfer as such—reinforced by further references to the media in general and tobiological/legal inheritance. The quasi-concept is extended to includethe relation between the text of a postcard and the text of a letterand also the relation between the text and the picture on retro andverso of the card. Moreover, the process of communication can bedisrupted by the fortuitous or deliberate detours of the missives—indeed this must occur—or by the destruction of the correspondencealtogether. Derrida goes on to indicate that the model describedapplies not only to his own “Envois,” but also to all intertextual rela-tions, and especially to that between Plato and Platonists—this lastpoint emerging from the incident which started the writing of hiscorrespondence: the discovery of an illustration depicting Plato andSocrates in a medieval fortune-telling book as reproduced on aBodleian Library postcard. In fact, Derrida illustrates aspects of themodel with references to the Platonic tradition throughout the text:for example, by speaking of the simultaneous presence and absenceof Plato as the writer of authentic and pseudepigraphic works respec-tively. The Bodleian postcard itself depicts the relation between Platoand his disciple Socrates with emphasis upon the medium of writ-ing, the legality of contract, etc. Plato was the author not only ofthe series of dialogues but also of an important epistolary collection.Moreover, fortuitous and deliberate detours have occurred in thephilosophical tradition in connection not only with Platonism, butwith Atomism, and with the relation between Platonism and Atomism.3636For the Plato/Socrates question (and the picture) see PC, pp. 145–6, 226–7,236, 251; for Derrida’s attitude to the Platonic corpus pp. 129–30; for the ques-tion of the Platonic tradition pp. 200, 226–7, 233–5.

Here, we shall confine ourselves to citing three examples ofDerrida’s Platonic reading, one from his earlier and two from hislater career.37According to the essay entitled Khòra,38this Greek word for “place”is one of the synonyms for the material principle employed in theTimaeus, Derrida using this philosophical notion as the starting-pointfor his own reading of the dialogue. The strategy here is basicallyto displace khòrafrom the context of Being to the context of writ-ing and thereby, since writing is conceived as implying the decon-struction of Being, to shift khòrafrom being a component in Plato’sontology to being a challenge to that ontology. To be precise, thetransition from the works of reason to the works of necessity togetherwith the introduction of the “third kind” (triton genos) in Plato’s cos-mological account39provides the opportunity for an extensive devel-opment which is then turned back on the original text. Its first phaseargues from the position that the third kind, the receptacle or nurseof becoming, place (khòra), evades the polarity of intelligible and sen-sible—Plato’s declared view—to the position that this principle alsocircumvents the opposition of Being and beings—as Heidegger sug-gests in one passage—through the intermediate position that it evadesthe dualities of being and discourse, of metaphorical and proper,and of logos and muthos.40The second phase extends place/the thirdkind beyond its superficial textual connections by activating eitherthe signified defined precisely as oscillation between the oscillationsof exclusion (neither/nor) and of participation (both/and), or thesignifier: the syntagmatic connection between khòraand genos, or thesignified and the signifier: the conceptual distinction of kinds of kindsexhibited in the polysemy of genosas gender (sexuality), race (ethno-graphy), etc.41This phase which is justified by reading Plato’s agno-sticism regarding place in intertextual combination with a negativetheology regarding being contains at least four subordinate phases:4237In order to reveal the textual analogies with what has preceded, we shall fol-low a structural rather than a chronological order in presenting the Derridean texts.38Jacques Derrida, “Khòra,” in On the Name, ed.

This clarification has two stages. First,Derrida approaches negative theology in an essentializing and con-stative manner by contrasting its features with those of the decon-structive method in terms of a set of five criteria.45These are: thatnegative theology belongs to a predicative or propositional mode ofdiscourse, whereas deconstruction does not, that the theological asopposed to the deconstructive method privileges the unity of theword or name, that negative theology assumes a super-essentialitybeyond affirmative predication and Being itself contrary to the prac-tice of deconstruction, that the theological as opposed to the decon-structive approach implies the retention of definite meaning, andfinally that negative theology promises the immediacy of some pres-ence to the subject whereas deconstruction does not.46Secondly,45HAS, pp. 77–82.

Thisprovides a reading of Plato’s Republic48where the Idea of the Goodis described as “beyond Being” (epekeina tès ousias) and of his Timaeus49where the Receptacle is described as “place” (khòra). Derrida isolatestwo features of each text: in the former, the fact that the Good com-bines the senses of non-being and maximalbeing and that the Goodis continuous with its metaphor of the Sun; in the latter, the factthat the Receptacle which is neitherintelligible norsensible does notbecome—at least in one possible reading —bothintelligible and sen-sible and that the Receptacle is no longer continuous with its vari-ous metaphors. Paradigm B—Christian.Derrida here reads several textsof ps.-Dionysius50as indicating some movement away from the essen-tializing approach to negative theology found in Plato through theintroduction of prayers, the multiplication of discourses (through cita-tion),51and the use of rhetorical apostrophe. The first and last fea-tures underline the importance of the performative aspect and thesecond feature the importance of the trace-structure of this kind oftheological discourse.52(“Segment E”)As a final stage in our juxtaposition of Derrida with the Platonictradition we shall revisit the general question of semantics withrecourse to the early essay “La pharmacie de Platon.”53Here, thewriter starts from the mythical passage in Plato’s Phaedruswhere thegod Theuth presents his discovery of writing to King Thamus forhis approval54and, bringing in a Freudian intertext concerning the47HAS, p. 82ff.

Derrida also makes use of Meister Eckhart at this point.51At HAS, p. 113 this multiplication of discourses is associated with the dialec-tic of affirmative and negative predications.52Derrida’s essay also includes a Paradigm C—Neither Greek nor Christian—based onHeideggerian texts.53Jacques Derrida, “Plato’s Pharmacy,” in DI, pp. 61–171.54Plato, Phaedrus 274c–275b.18chapter one"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"parricidal relation between father and son through the reference tothe “father of writing,” a Platonic intertext dealing with the Idea ofthe Good through the same reference, and a Marxian intertext con-cerning the relation between capital and interest through Plato’s ref-erence to the sun as “offspring” of the Good, develops an argumentabout the status of writing —also called différance, the pharmakon, thesupplément, etc. of great subtlety. This discussion can be understoodas simultaneously stating a theory of writing —namely, that writingis not posterior (inferior) to Being —and exemplifying the practice ofthis writing. Derrida reads Plato as stating the theory of writing inthree stages in which a hidden complexity in the relation betweendifferent signifieds is revealed. The first stage is where Plato rejectswriting and Derrida identifies King Thamus (and to a lesser extentTheuth) with the Idea of the Good and writing (and to a lesserextent Theuth) with the Sun. In the second and more complex stageof the argument, Plato actively read by Derrida—which means Plato’sown text read against Plato—reveals a distinction between a higherwriting interior to the soul and a lower writing exterior to it, showsthat these two writings are not totally separable from one another,and indicates by this fusion a certain re-evaluation of writing. Thethird stage is where Plato-Derrida identifies King Thamus, writing(and by implication Theuth) with the Idea of the Good which is“beyond Being.”55Derrida-Plato also exemplifies the practice of writ-ing in the second stage in which a hidden complexity in the rela-tion between the different signifieds and their signifieris revealed. Here,Plato’s assertions in the myth that writing is a remedy for memory—the positive evaluation of writing by Theuth—and a poison for memory—the negative evaluation of writing by Thamus—are con-nected through the lexeme pharmakon. In other words, the concep-tual relation between two aspects of the notion of writing is shownto be sustained by the linguistic relation between the lexeme phar-makonand these two aspects.56There are perhaps three importantpoints to grasp concerning this Derridean writing. First, that thiswriting is designed to overcome the distinction between the con-ceptual and the linguistic as such; secondly, that this writing exhibits55Derrida, Pharm., pp. 75–84 (stage 1); 95–117, 120–28, and 142–55 (stage 2);and 120–28 and 156–71 (stage 3).56Pharm., pp. 95–100.derrida reads (neo-)platonism19"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the infra-structural character described at the beginning of this chap-ter;57and third, that this writing serves to mitigate the rigid dichotomybetween monosemy and polysemy (“Segment F”).We have perhaps now reached the really critical point in ouranalysis. That it would be useful to write of Derrida’s reading of(Neo-) Platonism, of our reading of Derrida’s reading of those texts,and of our reading of (Neo-) Platonism, in all three cases with theintention of showing how philosophical writing simultaneously estab-lishes and transgresses its limits through the juxtaposition of textualmaterials has already been proposed. A detailed implementation ofthis proposal or at least the beginning of such an implementationmight proceed as follows.With reference to the question of textual transmission and infor-mation-transfer it becomes evident that both the Neoplatonists andDerrida view the Platonic tradition as writing. However, the differencebetween them is that the Neoplatonists treat the writing which isequivalent to the Platonic tradition as an external reflection of itsphilosophical truth whereas Derrida treats the writing which is co-extensive with the Platonic tradition as an internal critique of thatphilosophical truth. When one juxtaposes the manner of presentingthe history of philosophy in the “Envois” of Derrida with that ofpresenting the same thing in the work of a hypothetical Neoplatonist,the coming into relief of certain features indicates more than any-thing else the true natures of the Derridean and Neoplatonic notionsof the history of philosophy as writing. First, there is the use of thepostcard itself since this quasi-concept not only has a metonymicrelation to writing and trace—the presence or absence of the sender,the disruption or detour of the communication, the singularity orgenerality of the message, the visual or textual aspects of the com-munication, the presence or absence of the receiver being associa-tive features—but is itself an example of metonymic operation. ANeoplatonist would rather apply a metaphorical concept to his philo-sophical tradition: for instance, by comparing the presence of lightto visible things to the presence of truth in Platonic texts. Secondly,we find the seemingly un-Platonic writer Heidegger cited as an inter-text in the Derridean “Envois,” whereas equally un-Platonic thinkerslike the Atomists scarcely figure as intertexts in the Neoplatonists’57See pp. 1–2.20chapter one"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"own accounts. Third, there is the manner of linking the postcardand Heidegger. Here, one should note the further metonymic rela-tions between the “sending” (envoyer—schicken) of the postcard and theHeideggerian notion of “destiny” (Geschick) and between the rectan-gular format of the postcard and the fourfold quasi-structure of theHeideggerian “event/appropriation” (Ereignis)—which are connectiveelements—and the blatantly technological imagery of postcards, let-ters, telephones, and other media incompatible with the Heideggerianethos—which are disconnective elements.When we shift from the materials dealing with textual transmis-sion and information-transfer to those dealing with ontology and thedeconstruction of ontology, a more complex set of juxtapositionsbecomes possibleAll three of the Derridean discussions focused on the relationbetween Being (in the (Neo-) Platonic sense) and writing (as definedby Derrida). In segment D the khòraof the Timaeuswas displacedfrom the context of Being to that of writing and from the contextof being a transcendent signified to being simultaneously a quasi-transcendent signifier and a quasi-transcendent signified. In segmentE the essentializing and constative presentation of negative theo-logy—which corresponds to Being —was combined with or shiftedto a simultaneously essentializing and constative and non-essentializingand performative presentation of negative theology—which corre-sponds to writing. Segment F explicitly refers to writing. In this read-ing of the Phaedrus, writing as the pharmakon appears successively inthree forms: first, as something posterior and inferior to the Idea ofthe Good representing Being or what is “beyond Being,” and there-fore obviously corresponding to writing in the everyday sense; thirdly,as something neither posterior nor inferior to the Idea of the Goodrepresenting Being or what is “beyond Being,” and therefore corre-sponding to what Derrida elsewhere calls arche-writing, these twoforms of writing being mediated by the notion of a duality of higherand intra-psychic and lower and extra-psychic writing suggested byPlato. When we turn to the (Neo-) Platonic discussions, it becomesapparent that in two cases—segment A dealing with matter and seg-ment B dealing with the divine names—the relation between Beingand writing is not explicitly treated as problematic. On the otherhand, segment C does initiate a movement in that direction by com-paring the formulation of the requirement of a monosemous foun-dation of discourse in Augustine and ps.-Dionysius and that of thederrida reads (neo-)platonism21"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"possibility of a polysemous expansion of discourse in Macrobius.Thus, juxtaposition of segment A and segment B suggests a diver-sion and segment C an extension of Derrida’s reading of (Neo-)Platonism. Of course, the story is not quite so simple. The refer-ences to writing can be understood as applying on the one hand tothe graphic substance of writing and on the other to the generalstructure of writing, two phenomena which, although clearly to bedistinguished from each other, are never totally separated.58If wetake into account the Plotinian distinction between matter and eviland their interpretation as two overlapping stages in the emanativecontinuum, considering also the explanation of evil if not matter asbeing and non-being in different senses, then the Derridean notionof arche-writing or arche-trace comes more into view. If we add tothat equation the Proclean and ps.-Dionysian application of Plato’shypothetical method to the question of divine naming, where thefirst principle emerges simultaneously as non-being or non-intellectand as being or intellect in different senses, then a further approachto the Derridean concept of arche-writing or arche-trace becomespossible.59One might object to this extension of Derrida’s readingof (Neo-) Platonism on the ground that writing in this sense is notmentioned by Plotinus, Proclus, and ps.-Dionysius. Obviously, thispoint is correct. Nevertheless, that the essential traitsof this kind ofwriting i.e. its disruptive relation to metaphysics of presence and tooppositional structure can be found in the earlier texts is shown bythe following considerations:As we have already seen, the question of the relation between(Neo-) Platonic Being and Derridean writing is closely connectedwith the question of the metaphysics of presence. In fact, the Derrideansegment D, in describing how khòra evades the opposition of Beingand beings in Heidegger and the Derridean segment E, by explain-ing that negative theology promises the immediacy of presencealthough beginning to displace this through polysemy and deferral,state this connection explicitly. But how precisely do Platonism andNeoplatonism stand in terms of the metaphysics of presence?58See Derrida, OG, pp. 59–60.59The origins of the ps.-Dionysian theory in Proclus’ interpretation of the Parmenideshave not been understood by the majority of writers on the relation between decon-struction and negative theology. For one exception see Carlson, Indiscretion, p. 164(citing one of the present author’s earlier studies).22chapter one"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"A provisional response to this question may be essayed throughthe solution of two subordinate questions: namely, 1. Does the assump-tion of the epekeinaor “beyond Being” (as mentioned in the Derrideansegments E and F) represent a move away from the metaphysics ofpresence? and 2. Does the teaching regarding the khòraor “place”(as cited in the Derridean segment D) represent such a move? Derridahimself seems to answer the first question negatively in maintainingthe equation between transcendence of Being and maximal Beingand the second question affirmatively by activating the textual pos-sibilities of khòra although, in noting the performative aspects of neg-ative theology and the proximity between the Idea of the Good andplace, he tentatively answers also the first question affirmatively. Ouranswer to the questions will, however, place more emphasis uponthe concept of emanation60—something stated explicitly in the Platonicsegment A and, in the form of the dialectic of affirmative and neg-ative divine names, implicitly in the Platonic segment B. On thisbasis, it is possible to provide a.as negative answers to questions 1and 2: the One or Good is atemporal in being prior to the creationof time by the Craftsman, and the One or Good is substantial asbeing the cause of an emanation of a substantial character, whilethe Receptacle is atemporal in being prior to the creation of timeby the Craftsman, and the Receptacle is substantial as being theeffect of an emanation of substantial character61—atemporality andsubstantiality being the primary features, at least in the Platonic con-text, of the Heideggerian Being as presence. Using the same crite-ria, one can provide b.as affirmative answers to questions 1 and 2:the One or Good is temporal in being the cause of the Craftsman’screation of time, and the One or Good is not substantial as beingprior to an emanation of a substantial character, while the Receptacleis temporal in being the cause of the Craftsman’s creation of time,and the Receptacle is non-substantial as being posterior to an ema-nation of a substantial character. By answering the two questions inthe manner that he did, Derrida showed that he was intent on main-taining the separation of the Idea of the Good and khòraby ignor-ing the emanative continuum between them, or on preserving the60The account of emanation presented here is elaborated in more detail in chap-ter 2.61Here, cause and effect imply continuity while priority and posteriority implyseparation between the terms. derrida reads (neo-)platonism23"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"duality at the heart of the deconstructive method by denying themost deconstructive element of all.As we have seen, the question of the relation between (Neo-)Platonic Being and Derridean writing is closely connected not onlywith the question of the metaphysics of presence but also with thatof opposites of prior (superior) and posterior (inferior) terms. Anopposition between intelligible and sensible with primacy attributedto the former is identified as being fundamental to (Neo-) Platonismin the Derridean segment D and is shown to be substantially cor-rect by comparing the materials assembled here from the writingsof Plato, Plotinus, and ps.-Dionysius. Thus, the Platonic segment Astresses the dualities of stable and mobile and of orderly and disor-derly and the Platonic segment B the dualities of causing and causedand of intellectual and non-intellectual, in all cases with primacyattributed to the first term of the opposition. However, particularattention should be paid to the Plotinian and ps.-Dionysian materi-als in these two segments. Here, the usual priority within the oppo-sitions is combined, as a consequence of the complex semantic relationsbetween being, non-being, matter, good, and evil when conceivedas emanations and of the semantic shift within the divine namesfrom negation as deficiency to negation as excess, with a reversal ofthat priority. In other words, such textual materials also point towardsthe disruption of oppositions.We might here add a comment on the performativity to whichthe Derridean segment E alludes in explaining how negative theo-logy may be approached both in an essentializing and constative andin a non-essentializing and performative manner. The second aspectwould relate to the introduction of prayer—either in the basic sensewhere it corresponds to the negative moment or in the sense ofencomium where it corresponds to the affirmative moment—into thistype of discourse. Although this important notion of “address to theOther” is not paralleled in the ancient texts cited in this chapter,we shall pursue a comparison of the deconstructive and (Neo-) Platonicapproaches to this question elsewhere in connection with Augustine’swriting.Segmentation and JuxtapositionThe foregoing pages have sketched in outline—seemingly for the firsttime—the philosophical encounter of Derrida and (Neo-) Platonism.24chapter one"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Some brief comments on the method of juxtaposing segments extractedfrom (Neo-)Platonic and Derridean texts will form a coda to thisanalysis.The essay “La double séance” begins by tentatively asking thequestion “What is literature?”62The approach is tentative becauseof a certain suspension whereby the ensuing discussion takes placebetween the opposites of literature and truth—the between here alsobeing termed the “fold”, the “angle,” or the “corner”—although theinitial questions’s form “what is . . .?” presupposes the truth which isone of the opposites. This quasi-originary dualism so typical of Derridais immediately specified in two ways. The first way is visual. Mallarmé’sshort text Mimiqueis typographically displayed in the angle formedby a longer segment of Plato’s Philebusin order to serve as an epi-graph for some future development. The second way is textual. Anoral presentation is announced in the corner between a text alreadypublished (“la double séance I”) and a text about to be published(“la double séance II”), this material existing as a potential graft ontoa future commentary (on Philippe Sollers’ Nombres).63The early paragraphs of Derrida’s essay supplement these remarksabout form with various suggestions regarding content. In particu-lar, the relation between the quoted texts and a certain interpreta-tion of mimesis(stated in the case of Mallarmé and illustrated in thecase of Plato) is proposed as the main topic of discussion. This con-cept of imitation together with those of truth and meaning has gov-erned history while the notion of history itself has been based onthem. As far as the Philebusand other writings of Plato are con-cerned, imitation can be formalized in terms of a “logical” schemaof two propositions and six possible consequences: 1. Mimesispro-duces a thing’s double + a. the double is worth nothing in itself, b.the imitator’s value is only as great as the model’s value, c. themimesis is worth nothing in itself; 2. The imitator is something +a. the imitator adds something to the model, b. what is added isnever completely true, c. the imitator is an inferior replacement ofthe model.6462Derrida, “The Double Session.” inDS, pp. 172–286.63Derrida, DS, pp. 175–7, 183. 64Derrida, DS, pp. 183–8. Of course, the important point is not whether this isa reasonable account of Plato’s doctrine of imitation or not, but the fact that Derridaviews Platonic thought and systematic mechanism as closely associated.derrida reads (neo-)platonism25"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"We cannot pursue Derrida’s interesting discussion of literature,truth, and imitation beyond noting its main purpose: a deconstruc-tion of the Platonic notion of imitation which is based on the tran-scendent, on metaphysics of presence, and on the constative via theMallarméan approach to imitation which challenges transcendenceby being inherently temporal and performative.65For our presentpurposes, it will be sufficient to interrogate what we have termedthe visual and textual specifications of the between of literature andtruth. To some extent, the juxtaposition of segments of text as thebasis of a public performance reflects the structure of the MallarméanLivreor at least of the latter’s extant fragments edited by J. Scherer.However, the peculiarly deconstructive significance of the juxtaposi-tion of segments, although perhaps exemplified by the unfolding of“la double séance,” is only expounded theoretically in certain pas-sages of the associated commentary on Sollers.In “Dissémination,” many of Derrida’s remarks on the juxtaposi-tional technique of Sollers’ book seem particularly to address thedeconstructive significance of its procedure.66It is not difficult to rec-ognize this intention in the commentator’s references to a given tex-tual segment as deforming, contaminating, or rejecting another, andas modifying another text by insertion while radiating back towardthe site of its removal.67Duality is fundamental to this configuration,given that the textual samples can only be read within the opera-tion of their re-inscription. Each item is already a citation, a sciongrafted onto itself, a tree consisting entirely of a root, an incessantsubstitution. Reference to the Other is also fundamental to theconfiguration, implying a thickness of the text opening to the beyondwhich is at once null and infinite. One is thrown outside by thepower of reference which is however by no means a settled outside.The relation between discursive and juxtaposed textualities exhibitsthe subtle interplay characteristic of the relation between phoneticand non-phonetic language with which it is analogous. That Sollers’Nombrescan graft phonetic onto non-phonetic writing is highlysignificant. As Derrida explains elsewhere in connection with Freud,65Derrida, DS, pp. 188–94.66Jacques Derrida, “Dissemination,” in DI, pp. 287–366. The comments in thenext few paragraphs are based particularly on pp. 355–8 of this essay.67Derrida (quoting Sollers) explains that the ellipse is a form of motion whicha. preserves a contradiction and b. resolves it (Diss., p. 356).26chapter one"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"phonetic writing which has a linearity repressing meanings is to becontrasted with non-phonetic writing and the non-linear spacing outof meaning. Nevertheless, the contrast is not absolute since the non-linear graphism is always active within the so-called phonetic sequenceitself.68It is in this connection that the Egyptian hieroglyph (as interpretedwithin the Freudian Traumdeutung) and the Chinese ideogram (asexploited within Ezra Pound’s poetics) become relevant. Contrary tothe ideas of early modern interpreters like Athanasius Kircher andLeibniz for whom the Egyptian and Chinese scripts indicate the pos-sibility of a universal language of concepts or a transcendent divinelanguage both of which are obviously non-phonetic, Derrida drawsattention to other features of such scripts.69These are first, the com-bination of phonetic and non-phonetic elements analogous with thetransition between discursive and juxtaposing textualities describedabove and secondly, the requirement of interpretative decoding whichthe non-phonetic components of such a script imply.70Now Plotinuswho was himself Egyptian in origin also describes the hieroglyphs.According to his account, when the ancient wise men wished toexpress something profound, they did not employ these written let-ters which follow discursive thinking in the unfolding of words andstatements but rather certain images capable of manifesting as a sub-stratum of thinking the non-discursivity of the higher world (“SegmentG”).71The context shows that Plotinus is elaborating the contrasttypical of his thought between the non-discursive thinking of the second principle or Intellect and the discursive thinking of the third principle or Soul and associating non-phonetic writing with the linguistic expression of the former and phonetic writing with the linguistic expression of the latter. The Plotinian and Derridean interpretations of the hieroglyphs agree in stressing their combina-tion of non-phonetic and phonetic graphisms and the immanence ofthe non-phonetic in the phonetic.

These include: an explicitontological distinction between the thinking and the expressive modesin Plotinus only, the interpretation of what is expressed by the non-phonetic as atemporality in the case of Plotinus and as an “other”temporality in that of Derrida, and an implicit epistemological dis-tinction between the cognitive and the interpretative modes exclu-sively in Plotinus. For the Neoplatonist also, the assumption of ahigher reality which is transcendent and causal in relation to thelower remains paramount.As argued earlier, many of Derrida’s remarks on the juxtaposi-tional technique of Sollers’ book seem particularly to address thedeconstructive significance of its procedure. In fact, it seems rea-sonable to suggest that some of these comments are tantamount toa description of the deconstructive method itself. This is clearly thecase with references to the dynamic relations between textual seg-ments, the inherently citational character of such units being asso-ciated with the etymology ciere= “to move”/“to shake up.” Morespecifically, this dynamism is reflected in spatialization, temporaliza-tion, and the relation between the two.72This is how we should reada reference to the gap separating the text from itself which is man-ifested in the silent spacings of hyphens, periods, quotation-marks,and numerals, a note on the non-phonetic graphism’s having beeninserted, nowpunctuating, and being yetto mark the phonetic sequence,and a reference to the non-accidental intervention of spacing intothe time of language which therefore becomes not a pure contin-uum but a differential articulation.73Finally, juxtapositional textuality exhibits a tendency towardsgeometrization. This emerges clearly from Derrida’s comparison ofthe act of reading to the penetration of a surface by X rays and tothe removal of a painting from one frame to another. In this con-text, the dynamic transformation of geometrical shapes takes on aspecial importance. As one unfolds the semantic configuration of atext in reading, squares turn into cubes or into circles in a contin-uous gesture of non-closure.72Concerning Freud’s development of such ideas in connection with the anal-ogy of optical devices see Derrida, FSW, pp. 215–19.73For the last point see Derrida, FSW, p. 219. Derrida connects these ideas withthe non-linear notion of time developed by Heidegger.

This mightbe characterized as an evolving interaction between deconstructionand negative theology where there occurs simultaneously a reconfiguringof the relation between affirmative and negative modes as a relationbetween the procedures of exemplarism and substitution and a tran-sition from an ontological and quasi-linguistic to a linguistic andquasi-ontological viewpoint. In this chapter, we shall embark on thedouble enterprise of reading Derrida’s important essay in the lightof these criteria and of unfolding an unthought or unwritten elementin that essay. Although these questions will not be considered explic-itly until later on, they will be seen retrospectively to have beenimplied from the start in our discussion of Derrida’s textual relationto Neoplatonism through Heidegger, in the contrast between thereading ofnegative theology and the reading bynegative theologywhich constitutes the main conceptual opposition underlying theessay, and from time to time in our lateral exploration of decon-struction, infrastructures, and the like.Although “Sauf le Nom” is specifically orientated towards the prob-lematic of negative theology, having been originally published as areply to a group of essays on this theme,2it can be understood as1“Sauf le nom (Post-Scriptum),” in Jacques Derrida, On the Name, ed. T. Dutoit,trans. J.P. Leavey, Jr. (Stanford: Stanford U.P., 1995), pp. 33–85.2For a description of these circumstances, see ON, p. 34. Here, Derrida notes"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"a philosophical encounter between deconstruction and Neoplatonismin general. Leaving aside the question of whether Johannes Scheffler,the seventeenth-century German religious poet normally known underthe pseudonym of “Angelus Silesius,” who represents an intertextuallayer of Derrida’s essay, should be described as a negative theolo-gian or as a Neoplatonist, it cannot be disputed that Neoplatonicwriters rather than negative theologians in the narrow sense inter-vene at the most crucial points in the discourse. On one occasion,Derrida speaks of certain hyperbolic movements in the “Neoplatonic”(néo-platonicien) style going beyond God as being and as name.3Elsewhere in the essay one finds references to Plotinus as an exam-ple of a negative theologian but more importantly as proponent ofthe thesis that the Good can give what it does not have, one cita-tion mentioning the specific passages in the Enneadswhich supplythis formula, another noting that the formula haunts the westernphilosophical tradition until Heidegger.4Augustine is cited in a vari-ety of contexts. His ontology is contrasted with the negative theol-ogy of Silesius in one passage and identified with the negative theologyof Eckhart in another, these two references rightly suggesting the fer-tile ambivalence of Augustine’s metaphysical doctrine.5At one point,Derrida alludes to the psychological teaching regarding the “cogito”in both its Augustinian and Cartesian forms.6Moreover, the Confessionsare subjected to an extensive interpretation which moves along twotrajectories: the first whereby the text is seen less from the cognitivethan from the performative viewpoint, and the second whereby itsthat the first version of the essay was published in English under the title “Post-Scriptum” and with the subtitle “Aporias, Ways, and Voices” in the volume Derridaand Negative Theology, eds. H. Coward and T. Foshay (Albany: State University ofNew York Press, 1992), pp. 283–323. Having been unable to attend in person aconference organized under the same title as that of the volume, Derrida was invitedto respond in the form of a conclusion to the written versions of the papers readat the conference. A year after the production of this volume, the French versionof the essay was published as a small book entitled Sauf le Nom(Paris: Galilée, 1993).This included a. many inserts of varying sizes exploiting the polysemy of the phrasesauf le nom (i.e. “except the name”/“safe—the name”/”save the name!”), b. a detach-able insert entitled Prière d’insérer(“please insert”/”a prayer to insert”, etc.) linkingthe booklet with two others entitled Passionsand Khòrarespectively.

In fact, it is undoubtedly because Derrida approaches negativetheology not only in the context of Neoplatonism but simultaneouslyin the contexts of Neoplatonism and Heideggerianism that his 7SLN, pp. 38–40.8SLN, pp. 40, 53, 71, 74, 78.9SLN, p. 48.10SLN, pp. 72–3.

We shall indicatethe significance of Husserlian intertexts for Derrida’s project—at least indirectly—when discussing the concepts of repetition and ideality below. However, two ele-ments derived from Husserl which are introduced quite early in the text of “Saufle Nom” may be recorded here: 1. The notion of epokhèat SLN, p. 67. Here Derridaargues that the negative moment of theology has some affinity both with the skep-sis of skepticism and with the phenomenological reduction. Transcendental phe-nomenology, through its suspension of all positing of existence, is so similar tonegative theology that it could function as a propaedeutic to the latter. 2. (In anequally important but less explicit usage) Application of the analogy of arrows tointentions at SLN, pp. 61–2, cf. p. 74. The idea here is that the affirmative moment(or more precisely the combination of affirmative and negative moments) in theol-ogy can be likened to arrows aimed at but always missing their target. The man-ner in which Derrida wishes the analogy to be understood here is illuminated bythe public disagreement between Derrida and J.-L. Marion regarding the applica-tion of phenomenological ideas to negative theology. Using “God” as a paradigmof intention, we can say that for Derrida this represents an empty signifier operat-ing in the absence of intuitive fulfillment, whereas for Marion it represents anoverflowing intuition which “saturates” the intention.

At one point in his argument, Derridaexplains that the phrase Sauf le Nomproviding the essay’s title canbe understood as meaning both “except his name” and “safe, hisname” and therefore as illustrating the infinite substitution of nameson language’s boundary. Apparently, this process of substitution cor-responds to what Heidegger terms the es gibt(“there is/it gives”) andthe Ereignis(“Event/Appropriation) although strictly speaking it sur-passes all such philosophemes.12At another point in the argument,Derrida suggests that the structural plan underlying the essay “Saufle Nom” involves the discussion of negative theology not only as theintersection of two traditions but also through the interaction of twospeakers. Apparently, these processes of interaction correspond to theKreuzweise Durchstreichung(“crosswise cancellation”) by which Heideggererases the word “Being” and the Geviert(“Fourfold”) to which heclaims thereby to refer.13The numerous borrowings from the Germanthinker are mostly without explicit reference to their textual source.Nevertheless, it is possible to identify Der Satz vom Grundas the inspi-ration behind Derrida’s adoption of Angelus Silesius’ aphorisms asthe connecting element within his own discourse.14Sein und Zeitcanbe identified as the source of a certain existentialist element in “Saufle Nom”: for example, where Heidegger’s reference to death as “the11The frequent recourse to Heideggerian intertexts in the present essay is con-sistent with the strategy followed in the earlier text “How to Avoid Speaking.Denials” where Derrida thought he could most effectively treat negative theologythrough an intertextual discussion of three select authors: Plato, ps.-Dionysius, andHeidegger. The final stage utilized a cluster of texts in order to show first, thatHeidegger accuses Plato of failing to think adequately the transcendence of Daseinand the ontological difference and secondly, that Heidegger suggests avoidance ofthe word “Being” in his discussion of nihilism with Ernst Jünger and in the theol-ogy which he is tempted to write (see Derrida, HAS, pp. 73–142.

And secondly, how does Derrida use Heideggerian inter-texts in order to read negative theology?The question of why Derrida exploits Heideggerian intertexts indiscussing negative theology has an interesting answer.20It is thatDerrida elaborates this intertextual connection as a by-product ofwhat he probably believes to be a more crucial exercise: that of15See SLN, p. 44.

A glance at Heidegger’s intellectual biogra-phy reveals how the groundwork for such an interpretation can belaid. It is beyond dispute that during his earlier years, as a result ofsome innovative readings of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethicsand of cer-tain protestant theologians, Heidegger developed an extremely non-Platonic philosophy in which the practical predominates over thetheoretical, transcendent categories are converted into “factical” cat-egories, and the temporal and the particular are emphasized, thehermeneutical consequence of all this being what is loosely termedthe “destruction” of ontotheology.21According to the most percep-tive interpreters, Heidegger’s thought subsequently underwent changesin which a continuing explicit commitment to the destruction ofontotheology is accompanied by the implicit re-emergence of a prej-udice in favor of the contemplative, of notions enjoying some kindof transcendent status, and of a tendency towards the atemporal andthe universal—although this mature Heideggerian thought containsan ambivalent movement in one direction towards a quasi-Platonichistory of Being and in the other direction towards the non-Platoniclanguage of Being’s substitution with Difference, Ereignis, and the like.22Now Derrida is clearly sympathetic to such an account of Heidegger’s21The early period of Heidegger’s work which is especially documented by hisPhenomenological Interpretations of Aristotle—and reflected in Hans-Georg Gadamer’s laterhermeneutical approach—has been studied with great care by recent scholars likeTheodore Kisiel and John Van Buren. See Theodore Kisiel, The Genesis of Heidegger’sBeing and Time(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993).22The best example of such a “crypto-Platonic” reading of Heidegger by a writersympathetic to Derrideanism is John D. Caputo, Demythologizing Heidegger(Bloomington:Indiana U.P., 1993). Caputo makes a point of generally translating Heidegger’s keyterm Wesenas “essential Being” rather than as “coming to presence” (p. 222, n. 1.Cf. p. 125). Having traced the occurrence of this term through Heidegger’s writ-ings—especially in chapter 6 entitled “Heidegger’s Essentialism”—Caputo makesvarious statements interpreting this essence in a Platonic manner. For example, “Ifwe understand “Wesen” verbally, as what is coming to presence, is there not some-thing profoundly Platonicin thought’s step back from the lack of housing to the essenceof dwelling?” (p. 139—our italics); and again “This logic of essentialization. . . obeysthe most profound law ofPlatonicessentialism...Platonism’s most essential spiritreturns . . .” (p. 164—our italics). When Caputo further summarizes Heidegger’sposition on this issue by juxtaposing such statements as “the essence of technologyis nothing technological,” “the essence of language is not found in human speak-ing” in tabular form (p. 123), is he not clearly inviting his reader to understandthese statements as antitheses of affirmative and negative terms in the manner ofsome Neoplatonic theologian’s litany of divine names?

Heidegger and the Question, trans. G. Bennington and R. Bowlby(Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1989).24The question of Heidegger’s “Neoplatonism” is too difficult to address prop-erly here, a major obstacle for this project being the fact that neither Heideggerhimself nor his modern interpreters have developed an adequate understanding ofthe relation between “scholasticism” and “mysticism” which the term “Neoplatonism”completely undercuts. We shall confine ourselves to noting that Heidegger, in thecourse of many writings and with and without citing Neoplatonism by name, seemsto pursue a twofold approach of simultaneous critique and imitation in relation tothe latter: 1. Critique.In terms of general methodology, Heidegger is opposed to theformalizingtendency of philosophies like Neoplatonism (cf. his rejection of quantify-ing thought in works like The Question of Technology)—he also assumes that Neoplatonismrepresents an extreme version of the ontotheology whose destruction has been hiscontinual preoccupation (cf. many passages of the Contributions to Philosophy). In con-sequence, many specific oppositions can be established between Neoplatonic phi-losophy and Heideggerian thinking: for example, the Neoplatonists speak of Nothingnessas equivalent to superesssence, of being as the ground of other things; they affirmbeing as maximal and general; they speak of the metaphysical mind and of its atem-porality; and they postulate the dependence of the soul upon being. By contrast,Heidegger speaks of Nothingness as equivalent to finitude, of Being as equivalentto grounding itself; he denies Being as maximal and general; he speaks of the non-metaphysical Dasein and of its temporality; and he postulates the dependence ofBeing upon Dasein.(These oppositions are so frequent and so striking that one istempted to think of deliberate inversion or parody). 2. Imitation. In terms of gen-eral methodology, Heidegger is less antagonistic to the totalizingtendency of philoso-phies like Neoplatonism (cf. his notion of the single thought about beings as a wholein his works Nietzscheand What is Called Thinking?, etc.). This means that it is pos-sible to establish many parallels between Neoplatonic philosophy and Heideggerianthinking: for instance, the Neoplatonists’ remaining and procession corresponds toHeidegger’s withholding and proffering of the Geschick des Seins, while associateddualities like concealed/open, empty/overflowing, silent/saying are equally applic-able in either case.

This historical interpretation is of course based on theoblivion of Being or of the Difference.25From early in his career,Heidegger had maintained that the distinction between essence andexistence arose in the ancient world through a failure to think fun-damental Difference as Difference.26According to his later Nietzschestudy, there had been a primal self-disclosure of Being to the earli-est Greeks expressed particularly in their words phusisand alètheia,but this primal disclosure of Being as dynamic “presencing” (Anwesen)quickly turned into more rigid “presentness” (Anwesenheit) in the handsof Plato and Aristotle and then into even more rigid “permanence”(Beständigkeit), this maximal covering of the original self-disclosure ofBeing occurring in the application to it of the Latin term actualitasby the Schoolmen.27For these reasons the ancient distinction betweenessence and existence which marks the oblivion of Difference asDifference came to be treated as a causal structure linking real enti-ties.28Now if Derrida can be viewed as provisionally conceding thisHeidegger and Medieval Mystical Theology(Albany: State University of New York Press,1997).

Their answer seems tobe affirmative given that Heidegger had described his notion of Daseinin terms of Plato’s notion of epekeina tès ousias. One speaker does sug-gest that there is a difference between the hyperbolic element envis-aged by Heidegger, where the beyond corresponds to what is beyondthe totality of beings rather than what is beyond Being itself, andby Platonists or Neoplatonists, where the beyond represents what isbeyond Being itself and beyond God as either maximal being or lin-guistic referent. However, the other speaker reaffirms the similarityof the Heideggerian and Neoplatonic interpretations of the hyper-bolic element by arguing on the one hand, that Heidegger’s notion29An excellent illustration of Derrida’s double approach to reading Heideggercan be found in Jacques Derrida, Spurs.

In the first place, negative the-ology is said to be metaphysical but also to cross the boundarybetween Neoplatonic realism and Heideggerian Being: a situationconfirmed by a later observation to the effect that negative theologyradically contests the tradition from which it seems to come whileat the same time nothing is more faithful than this hyperbole to theoriginary ontotheological injunction.32However, the passage repre-sents not only a statement concerning the interrelation of philosophemesbut also an enactment of this interrelation. More precisely, it statesthat there is an ontological difference between Being and being(s) ofthe Heideggerian type which is produced by our transcending Dasein,and also that there is a henological difference between the Goodand Being of the Neoplatonic kind which is traversed by our soul’sreversion. It also enacts the Heideggerian movement of transcen-dence and/or the Neoplatonic movement of reversion by presentingthe first speaker’s view that the two philosophemes concerned aredifferent and the second speaker’s view that the two philosophemesare identical not as a doctrinal synthesis but as a narrative sequence.Finally, negative theology is said to be metaphysical but also to crossthe boundaries between Neoplatonic realism and Heideggerian Beingand Heideggerian Ereignis: a position restated in a later comment tothe effect that negative theology is situated between the Babelianplace—event, Ereignis, history, revelation, eschato-teleology, messian-ism, address, destination, response and responsibility, constructionand destruction—and something without thing.33Of course, the reading of negative theology in “Sauf le Nom”simultaneously against the background of Neoplatonism and Heideggerwill produce a result different from that arising from a reading ofnegative theology against the background of Neoplatonism alone.Such is the nature of intertextuality. Moreover, this reading will be31See Martin Heidegger, “The Essence of Ground,” trans. W. McNeill, inPathmarks, ed. W.

Themain strategies revealed in Derrida’s explicit reading of negative the-ology might therefore be classified as follows: 1. activity of critiquefrom a standpoint of proximity; 2. activity of critique and imitationfrom a standpoint of proximity, and 3. activity of critique and imi-tation from a standpoint of proximity and distance.34These can beviewed as having for deconstructionists an ascending order of value.Derrida’s essay contains perhaps one example of a philosophemesubjected to critique from a standpoint of proximity: that is, thenotion of the eye of the soul discovered among the aphorisms ofAngelus Silesius.35Obviously this doctrine regarding the highest orinnermost component of the metaphysical subject, here understoodwithin its broader Neoplatonic context, presents itself more as anobject of critique than as an object of imitation.An important philosopheme subjected to critique and imitationfrom a standpoint of proximity is the notion that negation andaffirmation represent a kind of retention and overflow. Here, Derridaspeaks of being at the edge of language in a double movement ofwithdrawal and overflow or of the signature which is simultaneouslya border, a relation to the other, and an overflow.36Since the meta-physical tradition has articulated a structure in parallel with this—Silesius is cited for the notion that the singularity of the unknownGod overflows the essence and the divinity37—Derrida is here exe-cuting an imitative strategy. Another important philosopheme sub-jected to critique and imitation from the standpoint of proximity isthe notion that one can give what one does not have. As appliedto the giving of a name, according to Derrida, this formula hauntsthe entire philosophical tradition.38The metaphysical parallels notedare Plotinus, where the Good is described as not only beyond being34Derrida would reject the technical terminology which we have applied to theclassification on the grounds of its spatial metaphorics.

First, there is what one might call the schema of self, God,and other. When Derrida cites from Augustine and Silesius the meta-physical notion that the movement of turning toward the self in acertain manner coincides with the movement of turning towardsGod,40his strategy is an imitative and proximate one. But when hedevelops this independently of such sources into a suggestion thatthe movement of turning towards an other somehow coincides withthe movement of turning towards God, the strategy shifts from prox-imity to distance.41A further philosopheme is the notion that Godas negative term corresponds to death.42Since this is presented in athoroughly Heideggerian and totally un-Neoplatonic manner it rep-resents critique and imitation of Neoplatonism from a standpoint ofdistance. What one might term the schema of without-beyond is alsoof significance. When Derrida argues that the phrase “without x” isequivalent to the phrase “beyond x” in Augustine or Eckhart andthat both expressions signify the metaphysical transcendence of somereal property,43his strategy is again an imitative and proximate one.But when he develops this independently of such sources into theidea that the phrase “without x” and “beyond x” are equivalent toone another and that both expressions signify the alternation of exem-plarism and substitution, the strategy shifts from proximity to dis-tance once more.44A further philosopheme is the notion that God’snothingness corresponds to the impossible.45This also represents cri-tique and imitation of Neoplatonism from a standpoint of distance,given that this constitutes a totally Heideggerian and thoroughly un-Neoplatonic approach.

Harmonics and Semiotics in Late Classicaland Early Medieval Platonism (Berlin-New York: Mouton de Gruyter, 1996), pp. 16–17,69–73, 139ff. Although the precise nature and function of the semiotic square willemerge as we proceed, in order to avoid potential misconceptions regarding itsapplication here, certain initial precisions are required: 1. Employment of the squaredoes not imply a complete semanticization of Derrida’s work.As will become clear after ouranalysis of his deconstruction of Husserl, the square applies to processes within thesemantic sphere (= henceforth the semiotic square), outside the semantic sphere (=henceforth the asemioticsquare), and both within and outside the semantic sphere(henceforth the (a)semioticsquare); 2. Application of the square to Derrida’s text is neitherunivocal nor uniform. The structure of the square itself can be interpreted in variousways. This is because neither a.the relation between the two semes nor b.the pre-cise form of the negation is specified at the outset.

Would not such a schematic conceptualization, especially con-sidering its possibilities of locating its four terms within the singleterm of a larger figure and sometimes as simultaneously locating thefour terms of a smaller figure within each of its own terms, be sub-ject to the criticisms already directed against the mise-en-abîme?52Asuperficial explanation of Derrida’s procedure is that formalizationis characteristic of negative theology and therefore any deconstruc-tion of negative theology will acquire some of this character.

At this point,54Aristotleexplains that although there are two modes of coming-to-be: wherea1 (à2) becomes a1a2and where (a1) à2becomes a1 a2—exemplified by“the man becomes musical” and “the unmusical becomes musical”—it is invariably the case that a1à2becomes a1a2. The product con-tains two elements: a substratum (a2) and a form (a1), while a thirdelement is presupposed by the change: the privation (à2). The sub-stratum before the change (a1à2) was numerically one but not onein definition, since to be a man is not the same as to be unmusi-cal. Later in the same work,55Aristotle embarks upon a more elab-orate classification. Leaving aside accidental changes—for example,“the musical walks”—change per se would seem to be of four kinds:i. from a1to a2i.e. from a positive term to its contrary positive term,ii. from a1to à1i.e. from a positive term to its contradictory, iii.from à1to a1i.e. from a negative term to its contradictory, and iv.from à1to à2i.e. from a negative term to another negative term.However, case iv does not constitute change, since change requiresterms which are opposites (either contrary or contradictory) while à1and à2are not related in this way. Case ii represents the changecalled “destruction.” It is not a movement, since the latter can onlytake place with something that already exists. Case iii represents thechange called “generation.” This is also not a movement since itscontrary is destruction and not rest. Case i represents movementwhich Aristotle goes on to classify in relation to three of his cate-gories: alteration in respect of quality, increase-decrease in respectof quantity, and transportation in respect of place.56It is easy to see that this account of change implies a semioticstructure similar to that represented in our rectangular figure men-tioned above. In fact, this type of conceptualization is relatively com-54Aristotle, Physics I. 7, 189b30–191a22. To pursue this problematic initially inthe context of Aristotle’s writings is a particularly effective strategy from our view-point. The Neoplatonists constructed many of their doctrines by transposing con-ceptual elements from the physical sphere described by Aristotle to the metaphysicalsphere described by Plato. The resultant doctrines include the famous teachingsregarding procession (diffusion of power) and reversion (actualization of potency)which in their turn underlie the ancient negative theology.55Phys.

With respect to the nature of the items, we are dealing withunconnected terms in the cases of physical change and the categoriesand with connected terms in that of propositions. The relation betweenthe terms a1and a2is initially specified as contrariety in the contextof the physical and propositional applications. Further with respectto the nature of the terms, we are dealing with a combination of(meta-) physical and logical features in the cases of physical changeand the categories but with logical features only in that of proposi-tions. Moreover, the physical theory alone introduces the notion ofa transition between terms.5957Aristotle, Categories 2. This kind of application was anticipated by—and prob-ably influenced by—Plato’s Parmenides. For a compact example of the exploitationof all four terms within the semiotic square see Plato, Parm. 160b–163b (= “hypoth-esis V”). It is interesting to note that the transition between terms becomes an issueat Parm. 162c.58Although based on Aristotelian materials, this conceptualization first emergesclearly in Apuleius’ Peri Hermeneias5, 86–88.59For a full discussion see Alain de Libera, “La sémiotique d’Aristote,” in FrédéricNef, ed., Structures élémentaires de la signification (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France,1976), pp. 28–48. Undoubtedly reflecting the influence of the Aristotelian school,we find the semiotic square utilized extensively in ancient grammatical treatises. Forexample in Varro’s De Lingua Latinathe square is applied to the classification ofparts of speech (nouns and adjectives—having case but not tense, verbs—havingtense but not case, participles—having both case and tense, and adverbs—havingneither case nor tense), and in Aelius Donatus’Ars Minorthe square is applied tothe classification of nouns and adjectives (masculine, feminine, common, and neuter).These examples are particularly important in demonstrating that the square can beapplied to the non-semantic sphere of accidence and to the organization of seman-tic properties alike.

Here, Derrida reverses the pri-orities—shifting the emphasis from a process where ideality orrepeatability forms the basis of repetition to a process where repeata-bility or repetition forms the basis of ideality—in a deconstructivemove.60We shall provisionally suggest that what is brought into reliefis a transition from a1à2to a1a2(or from à1a2to a1a2) with a1à2indicating the repeatability,à1a2a difference, and a1a2the repeti-tion or ideality.61More precisely, the critique of Husserl’s explanation of the ideal-ization associated with linguistic or mathematical meaningfulness maybe analyzed into three components: 1. Emphasis upon the possibility ofunfulfilled intention.62According to Derrida, Husserl had grasped thatexpressive intentions must be able to function without intuition andthat speech can therefore be linguistically coherent in the absenceof objects, truth, or consistency, although he had declined to elab-orate on this point. Derrida argues that Husserl should have gonefurther. He should have admitted that one can formulate not onlyexpressions like “the circle is square”—which may be converted intointuitable form on completion of certain substitutions of terms—butalso something like “green is or.” Since the latter embodies its owntype of repeatability, for example permitting a transition to the Frenchvert (verre) est ou (où), one can identify important “modes of sense”not pointing to any possible object. 2. Understanding of both object and60John D. Caputo, Radical Hermeneuticshas made a careful analysis of Derrida’sreading of Husserl on these questions.

However, he had been hesitant to apply this insight—which in Derrida’s own terms represents the effect of the produc-tive repetition mentioned above—to the transcendental subject aswell as to the transcendental object. 3. Reconciliation of the theory ofexpression and indication with the theory of internal time-consciousness.64AsDerrida points out, Husserl had maintained a strict dichotomy between“expressions” or signs which are meaningful through themselves andinternal to consciousness and “indications” or signs which are onlymeaningful “for something else” and externalized in the graphic orphonic. But this position is inconsistent with ideas stated elsewhere.In particular, Husserl had also argued that, because of the embed-ding of consciousness itself in the temporal flux, the putatively undi-vided unity of the present “now”—in relation to which the expressivesign had previously been defined—is actually a compound of pro-tentional and retentional “nows”—and therefore more analogous tothe indicative sign.6563See Caputo, Radical Hermeneutics, pp. 121–3, 139. It is precisely in relation tothis point that the respective readings of negative theology by Derrida and by Jean-Luc Marion will eventually diverge, Derrida’s position constituting a powerful rewrit-ing of that philosopheme and Marion’s a concealed return to essentially traditionalmetaphysics.

This argument will have important reper-cussions when the results of this deconstruction are applied to negative theology.See Derrida, HAS, pp. 79–80, 82–7 on the interpretation of negation as deferral. 65The critique of Husserl underlies Derrida’s subsequent elaborations on thetheme of “Spectre.” The latter names the situation whereby the notion of “livingpresent” is disrupted by repetition, negativity, and disjointure of time.

Our juxtaposition of Aristotle and Derrida naturally raises certainquestions. The first of these is whether the Aristotelian “semioticstructure” can be applied to Derrida. This can be answered in theaffirmative by citing references to the structure binding as “both...and” and releasing as “neither...nor” which is called articulation(“articulation”) in “Parergon”67—where the discussion concerns therelation between understanding and reason in aesthetics—, calleddouble bande (“double bind”) in “Speculer—sur ‘Freud’”68—where itconcerns the circulation of energy within the psyche—, and calledchiasme (“chiasmus”) in Positions69—where the discussion concerns therelation between literary and philosophical mimetologisms.

It is precisely this approachwhich seems to be shared by Aristotle and Derrida. With the for-mer, we find a variety of changes involving opposition contrastedwith that which is not involving an opposition and with the latter,a variety of terms in a certain mode contrasted with that which chal-lenges that mode of opposition.73However, one must also bear in mind certain fundamentaldifferences. On the one hand, differences between the Aristotelianand Derridean approaches are centred upon the relation betweenmeaning and our rectangular figure, since Aristotle applies the lat-ter’s combinatory mechanism to the organization of meaningful struc-tures: movements between really and conceptually distinct termswithin really and conceptually distinct categories. Derrida, however,is responding to the Husserlian doctrine of the unfulfilled intention.For him, the combinatory mechanism is equally applicable to ele-ments functioning in the non-semantic sphere—the phonemes andmorphemes—, to elements operating in the semantic sphere—thedenotations and connotations—, and to the various processes serv-ing to connect or disconnect these two spheres. This is why it is bet-ter henceforth to speak of an (a)semiotic square.74On the other hand,70See Jacques Derrida, “Passe-Partout,” in TP, pp. 5–8.71See Jacques Derrida, “Cartouches,” in TP, pp. 185–7, etc.72See Derrida, KH, p. 99.73The notions of articulation, double bind, and chiasmus (together with the rec-tilinear figures which they imply) are unfolded throughout Derrida’s writings. Viathe metonymy of penser →panser (“thinking” →“bandaging”) they play an espe-cially important role in Glas.74See also the important discussions of the “unmotivated trace” which is a con-tinuous process of becoming motivated in Derrida, OG, pp. 44–65 and of Plato’sanalogies between dialectic and the alphabet in Derrida, Pharm., pp. 156–71.

Derrida, however, takes his departure fromHusserl’s theory of expressive and indicative signs. He therefore asso-ciates time rather with the moment of non-ideality within the com-binatory structure, the nameless counterpart of the Husserlian flux,the moment of productive repetition.It has been our contention that a certain hypothesis clarifiesDerrida’s interpretation of the phenomena associated with negativetheology in terms of a formalization specifically vested in the semi-otic square. This is the suggestion that conceptual structures firstcoming into prominence with Aristotle have, when fused with adeconstructive reading of the Husserlian account of the constitutionof ideality, steered the project consciously or subconsciously in thatdirection. Our hypothesis does not represent a formalistic parody ofdeconstruction, since the semiotic square is not only an exhibitionof formalism but also an exhibition of the relation between formal-ism and non-formalism—just as it is not only an exhibition of ide-ality but also an exhibition of the relation between ideality andnon-ideality, and since deconstruction is precisely concerned withsuch a relation.75Sidenote: Two further notions governing the entire argument of“Sauf le Nom” and closely connected with the (a)semiotic squareshould be mentioned:76The first notion is that of voice. Since nega-tive theology is a complex variety of polysemous textuality—perhapsalphabetic letters at Theaetetus201e–203b—raises but cannot resolve the same issue.On the other hand, the Gnostic Marcus elaborates his theory that the primordialletters of the alphabet are the aeons emanating from Sigèwith no such inhibitions.See Irenaeus, Adversus HaeresesI. 14. 3.75As we have already argued with respect to the semiotic square, a1à2indicatesrepeatability, à1a2difference, and a1a2repetition or ideality. Therefore with respect,to the same square, a1à2 indicates repeatability, à1a2difference, and a1a2repeti-tion or formalism.76In addition to the detailed applications of the (a)semiotic square to be con-sidered below (see pp. 56–7, 89–92, etc.), one should also note 1. application oftwo terms of the square (a1à2, a1a2) to the two main sections of “Sauf le Nom;”2. application of three terms of the square (a1à2, à1à2, a1a2) to the three subsec-tions of each section of “Sauf le Nom.”50chapter two"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"a necessary component of any polysemous textuality77—, and Derridaoften speaks of the plurality of meanings in a text as a plurality ofthat text’s voices, it is not surprising to find his essay referring tothe different voices of negative theology. For example, in an impor-tant passage he notes that there are two voices in Silesius” apho-risms: one of the most radical critique and one of the most dogmaticassertion.78Now although Derrida does not specify the mechanismunderlying any distinction of voices and possibly has strategic rea-sons for not specifying it, we can state clearly that a voice repre-sents nothing other than a selection of privileged segments or pathswithin the application of an (a)semiotic square.79This brings us toa further notion: that of doubling. In a general sense, doubling is priorto voice. As something which has the closest possible relation to rep-etition—the latter requiring a minimal doubling in order to exist atall—it constitutes the beginning and end of textuality. The term“beginning” here must be qualified since its primary sense of unityhas already been excluded through the critique of Husserlian self-presence. This means that doubling is a beginning which is a non-beginning.80Likewise, the term “end” must be qualified through theexclusion of its connotation of unity through the same critique ofHusserlian self-presence. This means that doubling is itself alwaysdoubled.81Actually, doubling leads to the articulation, double-bind,and chiasmus which we have seen to represent different patternswithin the application of the (a)semiotic square. In these more specificsenses, doubling is posterior to voice.82That the notions of voice anddoubling are closely related is indicated performatively in the text77This idea clearly lies behind the strikingly decisive statement at SLN, p. 69 “Itrust no text that is not in some way contaminated with negative theology.”78SLN, pp. 66–7. At SLN, p. 35 Derrida speaks of the critical or negative voiceas the “voiceless voice”: (voix blanche).79One could add that the entire Heideggerian hermeneutic method dependsupon the selection of privileged segments or paths within the application of a semi-otic (and occasionally an asemiotic) square. This could be shown clearly throughthe analysis of Heidegger’s use of the formal indication (initial emphasis on oneterm within a complex), tautology (suppression of opposite pairs of terms), contra-diction (suppression of identical pairs of terms), and hermeneutic circle (successiveemphasis on one term and then another within a complex).80See Derrida, SP, pp. 88–9.

Thus, the initial exchange illustrates the main thesis regarding doublingi.e. that there is no originary unity.84See Derrida, “Restitutions of the Truth in Painting,” in TP, pp. 255–382.85In what follows we shall use “negative theology” not as a precise expressionspecifying the negative way of approaching the first cause which is contrasted withan affirmative way, but rather as a formal notation pointing to the entire discour-sive context surrounding the negative and affirmative ways of reaching the supreme.This use of the expression “negative theology” tends to predominate in the less spe-cialized literature and also—for better or worse—in Derrida’s writings on the topic.For purposes of comparison with Derrida’s discussion and our response to the lat-ter, it is worth noting the salient features of “negative theology” as stated definitivelyby the Neoplatonists. 1. This mode of thinking is based on an ontological contin-uum. In Neoplatonism, reality is understood as a continuum between superior andinferior—with the Good as highest term—and between simple and multiple—withthe One as highest term: since “the Good” and “the One” are alternate names forthe First Principle, the two continua are virtually synonymous. The processes ofnegation and affirmation which are on one level intellectual, logical, psychological,or linguistic in nature constitute on another level processes of ascent and descentrespectively or else processes of descent and ascent respectively in the ontologicalcontinua. (NB. It is because of the above that the Neoplatonists can speak of nega-tion as causative or generative); 2. Negation is the more important of the twoprocesses and embraces a variety of different senses. This variation is indicated bythe (Greek) terminology: a. apophasis(“denial”) represents negation in an unspecifiedsense as well as in the specific senses of marking higher, lower, or coordinate posi-tions within the ontological continuum, b. aphairesis(“abstraction”) is the specificterm for the removal of predicates or properties which manifests ascent within the52chapter two"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"(SLN 48a/Sauf 41a) The first interlocutor announces a repetitionwhereby the investigation of negative theology is begun anew startingorder of reality, c. sterèsis(“privation”) is the specific term for the removal of pred-icates or properties manifesting descent within the order of being, d. heterotès(“oth-erness”) represents negation in the relatively undefined sense of alterity, e. enantiotès(“opposition”) constitutes negation in the more definite sense of contrariety. (NB 1.Negation in an unspecified sense is often indicated by alpha-privative terms which,although grammatically negative, can be semantically either negative or affirmative;NB 2 Heterotèsis sometimes replaced by diaphora(“difference”). The latter termsignifies negation as the differentiation between species within a genus; NB 3.Enantiotèssometimes becomes, as a result of combining the senses of contrariety andcontradiction, a determinative negation); 3. Exploiting this terminology in a man-ner appropriate to context, philosophical writers establish three basic models for“negative theology.” The predominance of these models seems to follow a chrono-logical evolution from Middle Platonism, through the Plotinian system, to laterNeoplatonism. Model 1. the “Sigetic Model.” Here, Silence (functioning as an implicitnegative moment) is elevated above Speech (treated as an implicit affirmativemoment). This model occurs in two different versions depending upon whetherSilence is identified with Thought and elevated above Speech—examples can befound in Clement of Alexandria and Origen—or whether Silence is elevated aboveSpeech as identified with Thought—for numerous examples see Gregory of Nyssa.(NB 1. Silence is sometimes associated ontologically with what cannot be utteredand sometimes associated deontically with what should not be uttered; NB 2. Thismodel of negative theology generally implies the conventionalist view of language).Model 2: the “Discoursive Model.” Here, an unspecified “X” (functioning as animplicit negative moment) is elevated above the alternation of negation and affirmationindicating ascent and descent respectively in the ontological continuum or vice versa(functioning as an implicit affirmative moment). This model also occurs in twodifferent versions depending upon whether the higher “X” is specified as a supra-propositional item where the alternation of negative and affirmative is understoodas an alternation of propositions—several examples occur in Proclus—or whetherthe higher “X” is specified as a non-discoursive “striving” where the lower alter-nation of negative and affirmative is understood as an alternation of supra-propo-sitional items—for numerous examples see ps.-Dionysius—, it being obviously possibleto superimpose the second version upon the first in order to produce a more elab-orate structure. (NB 1. The propositions mentioned in the first version are treatedambivalently as logical and psychological in character; NB 2. In the first version,the supra-propositional item implies suspension of the law of contradiction; NB 3.The non-discoursive striving mentioned in the second version is treated strictly asnon-psychological in character; NB 4. This model of negative theology invariablymaintains the naturalist view of language); Model 3: the “Sigetic-Discoursive Model.”That the two previous models can be combined to form an extremely complexform of negative theology is indicated by several passages in Proclus. To this thereis an interesting counter-example: Gregory of Nyssa’s opposition of his own model1 to his rival Eunomius’ use of model 2; 4. Two further aspects of the “negativetheology” practiced by Neoplatonists should be noted: i.The manner of selectingterms for negation. In Plotinus, these tend to arise in the course of thought-exper-iments whereas in Proclus and ps.-Dionysius, they are mostly derived from the exe-gesis of texts; ii.The interpretation of negation as aporia: a combination ofNeoplatonism and scepticism coming to the fore in Damascius.

At thispoint the nature of this metalanguage is made more precise. Thelatter is propositional—of the type “S is P”—and formalistic. Moreover,it has no determinable referent with respect to subject, predicate, orcopula.(48e/42b) the first interlocutor restates the definition of negativetheology as a language while assuming the metalingual specificationof negative theology. An aspect of temporal circularity is introducedwhen he adds that we both follow the knowledge of the definitionand also pre-understand the definition.(49a/43a) The dialogic partner now develops the argument simul-taneously in several directions. Starting from the earlier specificationof language as propositional and formalistic, he suggests that nega-tive theology—which is henceforth mostly object-language rather thanmetalanguage—is a discursive formalization but an exhaustion ofthose discursive possibilities. The idea of temporality has clearlyinfluenced these definitions of negative theology—we shall call themthe third and fourth definitions of negative theology—which are likeNegation, Christian and Greek(Bonn: Hannstein, 1986). A less precise but still usefulstudy is: Deirdre Carabine, The Unknown God. Negative Theology in the Platonic Tradition:Plato to Eriugena(Louvain: Peeters-Eerdmans, 1995).86The axiom fully stated is “What is called ‘negative theology,’ in an idiom ofGraeco-Latin filiation, is a language.” The additional phrase raises the question ofthe translatability of negative theology which we reserve for discussion on p. 80ff.54chapter two"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"the earlier pair somewhat affirmative and negative in character.

He further comments that an implicit separation has beenmade with regard to negative theology between the latter’s onto-logical formalism and poetic metaphoricity and that this separationis something that not only deconstruction but also negative theologyin its metalingual mode might question.(49c/44a) The dialogic partner responds by returning to his firstdefinition of negative theology as language and his second definitionof negative theology as what exceeds and questions language. Aftermentioning once again the temporal circularity whereby we both fol-low the knowledge of the definition and also pre-understand thedefinitions, he now presents a revised first definition of negative the-ology as ontotheology and a revised second definition of negativetheology as a critique of ontotheology.(50a/45a) The first interlocutor concludes that negative theologyrepresents an inexhaustible exhaustion. He paraphrases this by say-ing, with an oblique further reference to the remainder, that it saysalmost nothing.(50b/45b) The dialogic partner now restates the definition of neg-ative theology as a language and the characterization of negativetheology as a discursive formalization with its possibilities almostexhausted, on this question extending the description to the met-alingual specification of negative theology. However, the discussionquickly shifts to negative theology as object-language which is nowdescribed in a new way as a corpus of statements linked either byfamily resemblance or under a regular logico-discursive type in amanner tending to mechanization of thought.(50c/46a) The original speaker provides an important explanationof this mechanistic formalization by interpreting it as the empty sym-bolic intending which—considering the question in terms of Husserlianphenomenology—destabilizes the full originary intuition. This nega-tive aspect of the theology can be counteracted by the positive aspectsof prayer and hymn.

This metalan-guage which has begun to assume so many features of negative the-ology that we might even call it “meta-negative theology” is indicatedby Derrida’s references to our pre-understanding of the definition ofnegative theology87and to an interpretation of that definition in theGraeco-Latin context.88It is important to note that the discourseabout negative theology studies its object by treating it not as aspecies within some genus but as a term which is both exemplaryand substitutable in respect of other members of a series.89For Derrida, negative theology (and also ambivalently the discourseabout negative theology) is to be understood from one viewpoint asformalization in the three senses of a proposition—for example, ofthe type “S is P” as represented by “What is called ‘negative the-ology’ is a language”90—, of an antithesis of affirmative and nega-tive—for example, the statement that negative theology is a languageand that it is a questioning of language91or that negative theologyis ontotheology and that it is critique of ontotheology92—, and of a set of propositions—for example, arranged according to family 87SLN, pp. 48e, 49a–c, 50b.88SLN, p. 48a.89SLN, pp. 49a, 51a.90SLN, p. 48d.91SLN, pp. 48b, 49c.92SLN, p. 49c.56chapter two"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"resemblance.93Negative theology (again without complete separationfrom the discourse about negative theology) is also to be understoodfrom another viewpoint as the exhaustion of formalization:94a notionwhich seems to indicate the situation where all the discursive possi-bilities have been realized including the possibilities of naming andreference as such.95In the course of his discussion, Derrida pointsout that exhaustive formalization is opposed to certain other kindsof discourse—for example, the languages of prayer and hymn96—inwhich metaphoricity is emphasized.97Although in its most basic inter-pretation, negative theology corresponds to the discourse which isexhaustively formalized, in a certain deeper sense it constitutes therelation between the discourse which is exhaustively formalized andthe discourse which is extended metaphorically.98Another important feature of the exchange between the two voicesis the introduction of temporal elements into the characterization ofnegative theology. These include the notion of pre-understandingand knowing after the definition of this theology,99the process lead-ing to the exhaustion of a formalization,100and the notion of whatremains to be thought after the definition of this theology.101Obviously,such temporal elements are atypical of the ancient presentations ofnegative theology but consistent with this passage’s modern intertext:Husserl.As we have already suggested, the next phase of Derrida’s firstdevelopment of the theme of negative theology is introduced by ref-erences to the remainder and to khòra.The importance of the remainder is indicated in the following passage:102– However much one says, then, that beyond the theorem and con-stative description, the discourse of negative theology “consists” inexceeding essence and language, by testifying it remains93SLN, p. 50b.94SLN, pp. 49a–b, 50a–b.95SLN, pp. 49b, 51a.96SLN, p. 50c.97SLN, p. 49b.98SLN, p. 50c.99See n. 87.100SLN, pp. 49a–b, 50a–b101SLN, pp. 49a, 50a.102SLN, pp. 54c–55a/Sauf 54a–c.what is called “negative theology?”...57"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"–What does “remain” mean here?

Here, wefind the attention of the two interlocutors shifting from a reading ofnegative theology to a reading of the interrelation of deconstructionand negative theology. The phases of this shift constitute the remain-der which must be thought of negative theology and the place inwhich one must think negative theology.We may follow the unfolding of Derrida’s discussion first withrespect to the deconstructive schema which it presupposes. Here,certain quasi-synonymous terms representing the overcoming of discourse such as “remainder,” “place,” “impossible,” and “un-decidable”104are found opposed to other quasi-synonymous termsrepresenting the discourse itself such as “trace,” “mark,” and“wound.”105Considering the situation in a primarily structural and103SLN, pp. 56c–57a/Sauf 58b–c.104For remainder see SLN, p. 58b; for place SLN, p. 58c, 59a; for the impossi-ble SLN, pp. 58c, 59a; for the undecidable SLN, p. 58c.105For trace see SLN, p. 61b; for mark SLN, p. 61c; for woundSLN, pp. 60a–b,61b.58chapter two"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"static manner the relation between the overcoming of discourse andthe discourse itself can be called a signature which is both illegibleand legible.106Approaching the matter from a simultaneously struc-tural and genetic and therefore simultaneously static and dynamicviewpoint, the relation between the discourse and its overcomingmay be called—using a class of terms poised between homonymyand synonymy which all have the general sense of relation to (an)other107—“ference,” “reference,” “difference,” and “transference”;108the relation between the discourse and its overcoming may also becalled “passion”:109a term which is exploited for both its active andits passive connotations. Roughly speaking, the “ference” class ofterms relates more closely to the text which is being read or writ-ten and the term “passion” to the reader or writer of the text.It is within this deconstructive schema which is familiar to us onthe basis of other texts that Derrida places a further account ofdeconstruction and an account of negative theology. The decon-structive element is centred on the notion of an event which is both“in” (dans) and “on” (sur) language110or the notion of a referencewhich is both “on the edge of ” (au bord du) language and “on theedge as” (au bord comme) language.111The negative-theological ele-ment is centred on a divine name’s relation both to “the nameablebeyond the name” (le nommable au-delà du nom) and to “the unname-able nameable” (le nommable innomable)112or a divine name’s relationboth to “an opening...openness” (l’ouverture, l’apérité) and to “a cer-tain absolute secret” (un certain secret absolu).113The combination ofthe deconstructive and negative-theological aspects is achieved in var-ious ways. In particular, Derrida’s comments about the absence ofa common measure between what is in and on language,114the unde-cidable question whether reference is or is not indispensable—whichis explicitly stated to govern the history of negative theology115—,106SLN, p. 60e, 61e.

We shall confine ourselves to a few points.The passage exploiting the intertext of Husserl is particularly impor-tant (50c). The beginning of this section explains how negative the-ology corresponds to the formalization implicit in the empty functioningof symbolic language, a point which reveals the extent to whichHusserl’s notion that an intention is never completely fulfilled by thecorresponding intuitive content has been developed in opposite direc-tions by Jean-Luc Marion—for whom the poor phenomenon repre-sented by the intuitive content is raised to the level of a “saturatedphenomenon”—and by Derrida—for whom the symbolic mechanismrepresenting the intention is lowered to the level of an empty signifier—and the extent to which these two opposed developments of Husserlianphenomenology have led to two equally opposed interpretations ofnegative theology.118The end of the same passage deduces a furtherconsequence of the Derridean reading: that negative theology bothcorresponds to one formalization implicit in the empty functioningof symbolic language and is subverted as the other formalizationimplicit in the transcendental aspect of phenomenology.Another aspect of Derrida’s first account of negative theology whichremains for us to think is the relation between that account and the116SLN, p. 58c.

The combined term whichDerrida implies to be typical of Neoplatonic thought should be com-pared with the neutral term typical of deconstruction which is sug-gested elsewhere: the remainder to be thought subsequently to theexhaustion of negative theology’s formalization. An (a)semiotic squarecan also be found to underlie the interrelation of deconstruction andnegative theology elaborated in the latter part of Derrida’s firstaccount. Here, the situation is predictably more complex given thatthe quasi-synonymous terms representing the overcoming of dis-course—remainder, impossible, undecidable—are items which areneither positive nor negative, while the quasi-synonymous terms rep-resenting discourse itself—trace, mark, wound—are items in transi-tion between the negative and positive.120The further deconstructiveelements to be added to this deconstructive framework include as apositive item that which is in language, as a negative item that whichis on the edge of language, and as a combined item that which ison language and on the edge of language. Similarly the negative-theological elements to be added to the deconstructive frameworkinclude as a positive item the divine name’s relation to an openingor openness, as a negative item the divine name’s relation to anabsolute secret, and as a combined item the divine name’s relationsto the nameable beyond the name and the divine name’s relationto the unnameable nameable.119See pp. 42–3. Of course, the application of the (a)semiotic square to whatfollows must be considered as falling in a range between the precise and the approx-imative (more precise in the case of negative theology and more approximative inthat of deconstruction).120On the quasi-synonymous term “place”—which must be handled differently—see chapter 4.1.what is called “negative theology?”...61"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The (a)semiotic square obviously has an important relation to thepassage exploiting the intertext of Husserl.

It is also becausethe square’s combinatory mechanism applies to elements function-ing in the non-semantic sphere that one can defend Derrida’s prac-tice of exploiting the practical and performative possibilities of negativetheology throughout the text of “Sauf le Nom.”121The final issue raised by Derrida’s first account of negative the-ology is perhaps that of “reference” (référence). Allowing for the pre-dictable polysemy of this term or group of terms, it is necessary todistinguish a more typically deconstructive and non-ontotheologicalsense of reference which is stated explicitly: “relation to the other”(rapport à l’autre) and a more typically Neoplatonic and ontotheolog-ical sense which is used implicitly: “relation to an extra-linguisticother”;122to distinguish further a more typically deconstructive andnon-ontotheological sense of transcendence associated with the firstkind of reference and a more typically Neoplatonic and ontotheo-logical type of reference associated with the second kind of refer-ence;123and to understand additionally the assumption that withreference the deconstructive and non-ontotheological sense predom-inates while with transcendence the Neoplatonic and ontotheologi-cal sense is privileged.

It is also important to notethat, since the deconstructive referential schema and the negative-theological schema so conceived are themselves juxtaposed in a rela-tion of undecidability, a multiplication of squares is taking place.124The importance of this entire section of text (roughly 48a–62b) isunderlined by Derrida himself when he concludes that as a resultof the various discussions which have been conducted the phrase“What is called ‘negative theology’ is a language” no longer has theintelligibility of a pure axiom.125The point might be paraphrased bysaying that Derrida and his reader began with the stability of anaxiom about negative theology and of an interpretation of that the-ology as axiomatic, that they subsequently shifted to what remainsto be thought about negative theology and to the place where decon-struction and negative theology must both be thought—a move requir-ing a deeper reflection on the “language” mentioned in the originalaxiom—, and that they have ended by disrupting the axiom aboutnegative theology and the interpretation of that theology’s axiomatism.124See pp. 42–3 and n. 51. The importance of the notion of reference forDerrida’s interpretation of the relation between deconstruction and negative theol-ogy is underlined at SLN, p. 60c where he concludes that the entire history of neg-ative theology plays itself out in the axiom that the referent either isor is notindispensable.

It is worth noting that the Heideggeriandifference between Being and beings—like any general structure of Derrida’s—canbe understood as a “condition of possibility” (see What is Called Thinking?II. 11, p. 243). Moreover, this difference is implicit in the structure of language (see ibid.II. 10, pp. 218–22, II. 11, pp. 241–2); it cannot appear otherwise than in someepochal manifestation as the Platonic participation, the Nietzschean Will to Power,etc. (see ibid.I. 7, p. 78, I. 8, pp. 83–4, I. 8, p. 86, I. 9, pp. 89–95, I. 9, p. 98,I. 10, pp. 100–104, II. 10, pp. 218–19, II. 10, pp. 226–8, II. 11, pp. 233–8); andit underlies the structure of a fourfold (see ibid.II. 10, p. 218, II. 11, pp. 240–42).Moreover, the Heideggerian difference between Being and beings—again like anygeneral structure in Derrida—mutates into further structures such as “Rift” (Riss)which represents a more hermeneutically developed difference, and “Vibration”(Schwingung) representing a less hermeneutically developed difference.

In referring to quasi-general structures, the framer of the definition shows that it is certainrelations other than the specifically logical one between generic andspecific terms which are at issue.128Earlier exponents of deconstructionhave advanced similar provisional definitions, although sometimes ina more context-specific relation to logic and ontology. For example,the excellent interpreter Gasché defines the purpose of the methodas being to account forcontradictions by groundingthem in infra-structures.129In following up the implications of this definition, we can perhapsproceed most effectively by dividing it into two components: first,the explanation and modification of asymmetrical contradictories andsecondly, the association with quasi-general structures which areunderstood and enacted.It will be useful to reinforce the first part of the definition by con-structing a sort of conceptual model based on a combination of tem-poral and quasi-spatial figures.130More precisely, this will consist ofwhat we shall call the “figure of (semi-) circularity” in which a pos-itive term a1à2is first displaced by a negative term à1a2which is then displaced by a combined term a2a1. The figure of (semi-) cir-cularity can be compounded with one or two partial figures whichwe shall call that of “transcendence” consisting of the displacementof the negative term à1a2by a neutral term à2à1; and that of “trans-lation” consisting of the displacement of the negative term à1a2bya different realization of the combined term as b2b1.131It should be128The definition does not take account of certain other characteristic featuresof the deconstructive approach. These include: first, the textual-historical environ-ment in which the contradictories and structures are presented to deconstruction(see pp. 1–5) and the simultaneity of deconstruction’s reflective relation to its cho-sen texts and self-reflective relation to its own method (see p. 79). Both these fea-tures have been discussed in relation to negative theology during the previoussegment.129The definition can be found in Gasché, The Tain of the Mirror, pp. 127–8,134–5, 142, 171.130Emphasizing the temporal aspect, one might prefer to call these figures“rhythms.”131The configuration has been established in order to conceptualize the inter-section of Neoplatonism and deconstruction and is nowhere presented in this man-ner in the writings of Derrida. For the outlines of Derrida’s own presentation seeespecially Pos., pp, 41–3, 71, 82 and SEC, pp. 329–30. Here, we find two struc-tures: i.

In the case of deconstruction, this unit is a duality ofopposites where one term is accorded primacy of value over theother term, an example of this being the oppositional pair of atem-poral and temporal with primacy of value assigned to the formeraccording to traditional metaphysics.132The opposition or opposi-tions which deconstruction found within any philosophical text couldbe presented by such a discourse either vertically, where one mightp. 82.

Here, Derrida refers either to the “overturning”of certain priorities or a “displacement” of complex systems (Pos., pp. 41–3, SEC,pp. 329–30. Cf. Pos., p. 82, Spurs, p. 81); or to the “grafting” onto a new conceptor the “irruptive emergence” of a new concept or the “reinscription” of a concept(Pos., pp. 41–3, SEC, pp. 329–30. Cf. Spurs, p. 95); or else to a “neutralization” or“constituting a third term” (Pos., pp. 41–3, SEC, pp. 329–30. Cf. DS, p. 207, n. 24; FRGE, p. 274, Spurs, p. 63). According to the passages quoted, the momentof overturning is a particularly complex one in that there is a displacement notonly of a conceptual order but of the non-conceptual order with which it is artic-ulated—an idea connected with the Derridean theme of the “remainder” (SEC, pp.329–30. Cf. FRGE, p. 274). For a good summary of the deconstructive method seeGasché, The Tain of the Mirror, pp. 137–8, 167, 170–73. There is more material andother examples in Harvey, Derrida and the Economy of Différance, pp. 28–36, 71–3, 77(where two of the moments, following Derrida’s Positions, are styled “castration” and“mimesis”), and Christopher Norris, Deconstruction.

It is important tonote that with respect to the configuration which we have outlined, Neoplatonismoften concentrates on the three moments of the figure of (semi-) circularity whereasdeconstruction specializes in the partial figures of transcendence and translation.However, it is quite clear that the entire system is presupposed by both approaches.132For example, see Derrida OG, pp. 139, 215, Pharm., pp. 137–8, Pos., p. 41.Cf.

As explained most fullyin the writings of Proclus, when a positive term a1à2is present thisimplies that some metaphysical principle “remains,” when the posi-tive term is displaced by a negative term à1a2, this indicates that the same principle “proceeds,” and when the negative term is dis-placed by a combined term a2a1, this indicates that the same prin-ciple “reverts.” Moreover, the displacement of the negative term à1a2by the neutral term à2à1shows that the principle being discussed“reverts” in relation to something ontologically prior, and the dis-placement of the negative term à1a2by a different realization of thecombined term as b2b1shows that something ontologically posterior“remains” in conjunction with the principle being discussed.140Thus far, we can clearly speak of a convergence between decon-struction and Neoplatonism.

It may form an oppositionwith another term and may possess a value greater than or less thatthat of another term. However such relations are external to theunit insofar as it is represented by the terms a1, à1, a2, à2.. In thecase of deconstruction, the unit (opposition) may be conceptual andenjoying logical connections with other concepts, or semantic withassociative connections with other semes or verbal and enjoying iter-ative connections with other words. In the case of Neoplatonism, theunit (non-opposition) is explicitly described as conceptual and as con-nected logically with other concepts although implicitly viewed assemantic and as connected associatively with other semes. It isundoubtedly because of the non-dualistic and non-discoursive natureof its units that Neoplatonism not only departs from deconstructionbut itself requires deconstruction. Thus, Neoplatonism invokes theopposition of theoretical and practical while assigning primacy to thetheoretical, the opposition of cognitive and emotive with primacyassigned to the cognitive, and the opposition of conscious and uncon-scious with primacy assigned to the conscious.141In continuing to follow up the implications of our definition ordeconstruction, we may turn from the question of explaining andmodifying asymmetrical contradictories to that of associating themwith quasi-general structures which are understood and enacted.Consideration of the second part of the definition should beginby recording the fact that Derrida does mention, as operative withinthe deconstructive method, certain “general structures” or “signify-ing structures.”142According to arguments developed in certain ear-lier texts like the essays “Force et Signification,” “ ‘Genèse et Structure’141It is perhaps obvious that one could move with respect to the figure of (semi-)circularity and the partial figures of combination, transcendence, and translationfrom considering the proximity of Neoplatonism and Derrida to considering thatof Neoplatonism and Heidegger.

These names are of twotypes: 1. Reflecting the negative moment of deconstruction wherebyterms which are subordinated, marginal, or non-existent in the philo-sophical tradition are given prominence (Writing, Trace, Supplement, Re-Mark, etc.), and 2. Reflecting the affirmative moment of deconstructionwhereby terms which are prominent in the philosophical traditionare given a transformed, parodic, or ironic sense (Difference, Khòra,etc.).146Among the most striking features of the Derridean general struc-tures are first, the inapplicability to them of any logical, epistemo-logical, or ontological determination.147However, this negativecharacterization is inevitably combined with an affirmative one.

The nature of thismutual reflexivity will become clear when we turn to the consider-ation of particular structures by name.There is an intersecting relation between the general structures ofdeconstruction and the hypostatic structures of Neoplatonism whichis of the greatest subtlety. Gasché has perhaps caught a glimpse ofthe situation in that he at one point describes the collectivity of thegeneral structures in terms recalling Plato’s Republicas “a systembeyond Being”154and—developing an approach which is particularlysuggestive for the present undertaking although provoking strong criticism from other quarters—somewhat “Platonizes” the presenta-tion of the general structures as a whole.155In order to explain the149FS, p. 4, n. 2; OG, p. 167.150FS, pp. 15–16, Pos., p. 40.151SSP, pp. 278–80, 286.152LI, pp, 50–52, SEC, p. 318.153SSP, p. 289.154Gasché, The Tain of the Mirror, p. 177ff.

It will also be necessary to take into account not onlythe ontological approach specific to Neoplatonism but also what onemight term the “stratification” of Being implied by the latter.In Neoplatonism also, there are restrictions on the applicability oflogical, epistemological, and ontological criteria. The first principlecannot be captured in propositional form or through conceptualthinking and,156although retaining the status of a principle or power,cannot really be described as One, Good, or Being.157Neoplatonismpp. 87–91. This important discussion (originally published as a review of The Tainof the Mirror) accuses Gasché of a Hegelian rather than Platonizing reading of Derrida.However, these two approaches would amount to roughly the same thing in thepresent context. For Gasché’s defence of his earlier position see Inventions of Difference,pp. 12–14. 156For the doctrine that the first principle is above conceptual thought see Plotinus,Enn.V. 1 [10] 9. 7–9, V. 1 [10] 11. 4–7, V. 6 [24] 5. 1–6. 35, V. 5 [32] 1. 6–2.25. Regarding the doctrine that the first principle is above propositional thoughtsee Enn.VI. 7 [38] 1. 29–43, VI. 7 [38] 38. 1–9, V. 3 [49] 10. 39–51. In inter-preting such passages one must bear in mind that 1. Plotinus distinguishes two kindsof conceptual thought, i.e. a. intellection (intuitive-atemporal), and b. ratiocination(discursive-temporal) where Soul possesses a. and b., Intellect possesses a. only, theOne/Good possesses neither; 2. The statement that the first principle cannot becaptured by conceptual thought means both that we cannot capture it thus (althoughwe also think conceptually) (see Enn.V. 6 [24] 6. 29–35) and also that it cannotcapture itself thus (since it does not think conceptually at all) (see Enn.V.1 [10] 7.5–7); 3. Conceptual thought can in a certain sense be applied to the first princi-ple. However, this means that we can capture it indirectly through the subsequentprinciple (see Enn. V. 3 [49] 14. 1–8) or that it can capture itself indirectly throughthe subsequent principle (see Enn. III. 8 [30] 8. 30–38); 4. Plotinus makes no dis-tinction between a. propositional form and b. discursive processes and therefore nodistinction between a. implication and b. inference.157For the First as “principle” (arkhè) see Enn. V. 4 [7] 1. 22–3, VI 9 [9] 3.49–54; for the First as “power” (dunamis) see Enn. III. 8 [30] 10. 1–3, V. 5 [32]10. 5–6, VI. 8 [39] 9. 42–8. The non-applicability of the term “One” is stated atEnn.V. 5 [32] 6. 26–37; the non-applicability of the term “Good” is stated at Enn.VI. 7 [38] 38. 1–9. For a nuanced answer to the question of applying the terms“One,” “Good,” and “Principle” to the First, such terms being applied as a kindof recollection of our indescribable union with the First see Enn.V. 5 [32] 10.10–17. The question regarding “Being” (ousia) is particularly complicated. The fol-lowing points should be noted: i. the First is not being (ousia) where being is equiv-alent to “form” (eidos) or a “this” (tode ti). See Enn. V. 5 [32] 6. 1–25, VI. 8 [39]12. 20–22; ii. the First can be described as being in the sense of “cause of being.”See Enn. VI. 8 [39] 12. 1–2 , VI. 8 [39] 19. 3–6; iii. one can say of the First thatit is “quasi-being” (hoion ousia). See Enn. VI. 8 [39] 7. 50–54, VI. 8 [39] 13. 47–53.At Enn.

However, to the extent that it is one it is particular in a certain sense(hence our “quasi-particular”). For universal Intellect containing particular intellectssee for example Enn.V. 9 [5] 8. 1–7, and for universal Soul containing particularsouls see for example Enn.IV. 9 [8] 1. 7–13. Since both Intellect and Soul con-tain the world of Forms in different ways, while the world of Forms is articulatedas a totality containing universality and particularity (see Enn. V. 9 [5] 12. 1–10and V. 7 [18] 1. 7–26), the relations between Intellect and intellects and betweenSoul and souls themselves are paralleled by those between their respective contents.159See Enn.III. 6 [26] 7. 1–44, III. 6 [26] 12. 1–14. 36 (Matter as final term);Enn.VI. 9 [9] 2. 29–31, V. 5 [32] 6. 1–11 (denial of Form to the One); Enn.

This arrangement—which is generallyimplicit in Plotinus but stated explicitly for the first time by Augustine—applies to“physical” space-time. In fact, Plotinus distinguishes from physical space a kind ofconceptual space—see Enn.V. 6 [24] 6. 13–15 on the space within Intellect andI. 8 [51] 14. 28–34 for the space in which Soul and Evil relate to one another—and from physical time a kind of conceptual time called “eternity”—see Enn.III.7 [45] 2. 1–4. 45. Plotinus’ thought about space-time (and quasi-space-time) is alsocomplicated by the assumption that the generation or emanation of the hypostases,in its highest or initial stages, represents a special kind of spatio-temporality.

In orderto answer this question, we must first list some of the most impor-tant “structural names” and attempt to sketch their meaning.165Although there are sound conceptual reasons for not arrangingthese names in a fixed order, “Difference” might be considered first.As several interpreters of Derrida have been able to show,166Differencecan be applied to each of the stages of the process whereby a pos-itive term a1à2(a duality of opposites where one term is accordedprimacy of value over another term) is first displaced by a negativeterm à1a2(the same duality of opposites but with the primacy ofvalue transferred to the other term) which is then displaced by a161See Enn.V. 1 [10] 11. 7–13, VI. 5 [23] 9. 1–13, V. 8 [31] 9. 1–14, etc.162See Enn.V. 4 [7] 2. 7–8, V. 1 [10] 5, 6–19, V. 3 [49] 11. 4–8, etc.163See Enn.V. 9 [5] 6. 1–24, V. 9 [5] 8. 1–8, V. 9 [5] 6. 1–15.164In what follows, we shall discuss these structures in a relatively context-freemanner, i.e. without reference to their specific textual origins. However, it is cru-cial to Derrida’s thinking that e.g. “Trace” originates in Lévinas (see Derrida, OG,p. 70), “Re-Mark” in Mallarmé (see Derrida, DS, pp. 251–2), etc.165The term “structural name” is non-Derridean. We have introduced it heretemporarily in order to allow a conceptual distinction between the processes of the(a)semiotic square (= our “structures”) and the Derridean general structures (our“structural names.”)166There is a particularly good discussion in Harvey, Derrida and the Economy ofDifférance, pp. 50–52, 71–3, 77.

Difference corresponds not only to stageswithin the figure of (semi-) circularity but also to those between thefigure of (semi-) circularity and the partial figures of transcendenceand translation. Thus, Difference can be applied to the stage wherebythe single negative term à1a2(the original duality of opposites butwith the primacy of value transferred to the other term) can be dis-placed by either or both of a term indeterminately negative or pos-itive in principle (a questioning of the meaning of the oppositionitself ) and a term indeterminately negative or positive in the con-text (a questioning of the meaning of the terms of the opposition).No doubt because of its philosophical history, Difference is appliedprimarily to logical contexts where, in terms of the relation betweenrepetition and ideality, the latter aspect is predominant. Such logi-cal contexts would include the Hegelian dialectical sublation and theHeideggerian ontological difference.167Another important structural name is that of “Trace.” Since thisrepresents for Derrida the minimal relation to an other,168it corre-sponds to that moment within the figure of (semi-) circularity wherethe positive term = duality of opposites with accented term is dis-placed by the negative term, or alternatively to that moment withinthe same figure where the negative term = duality of opposites withtransfer of accents is displaced by the combined and/or transcen-dent and/or translative term(s). However, Trace particularly repre-sents the duality of opposites itself constituting the positive term orthe negative term169—its non-unitary nature is constantly empha-sized—and particularly represents the accentuation of one term over167For a statement of the basic logical function see Derrida, Pos., p. 9.

Sincethese passages emphasize how Derridean difference contrasts with the other rele-vant philosophemes and therefore how it circumvents their “logic,” we are remindedthat the logical operation of Difference is simultaneously with and against logic.168The basic meaning of Trace (in close association with other structural nameslike Difference, Spacing, and Writing) is stated clearly in Derrida, OG, pp. 70–71.For further delineation of the conceptual ambit of the term see Derrida, DS, p. 241.

In a mannermore akin to that of “Re-Mark” to be discussed below, the term isutilized not only as a structure of generalized otherness (logical) butalso as a structure of generalized reference (logical-semantic).171Theperformative aspects of the Derridean Trace are also extensivelydeveloped. In one instance, the anagrammic connection between trace(=“mark” or “trail”) and écart(“gap” or “deviation”) reflects on theverbal level the conceptual association between necessary sequenceand random deviation, the fact of such a reflection itself producingan instance of that conceptual association.172In another instance,traceenters into semantic association with écriture(“writing”), inscrip-tion (“inscription”), signature (“signature”), and post-scriptum (“postscript”)in order to produce an extensive family of structural names whichcan be applied to parts of the (semi-) circular figure. When consid-ered together, these cases reveal the special relation between the ase-mantic and semantic spheres.Derrida lifts the term “Supplement” from the context of Rousseau.173This term is particularly important from the viewpoint of ourconfigurative interpretation since it represents simultaneouslythe momentwithin the figure of (semi-) circularity where the positive term =duality of opposites with accented term is displaced by the negativeterm and alsothe moment where the negative term = duality of opposites with transfer or accent is displaced by the combined and/or transcendent and/or translative term(s).174By speaking of the170See FSW, p. 230.171This is clearly stated in Diff., pp. 24–5.172There is an excellent discussion of this question in Johnson, System and Writingin the Philosophy of Jacques Derrida, p. 111ff. It should be noted that the double ver-bal connection of trace → écartis extended to a triple verbal connection of trace →écart → carré (“square”) by Derrida, Diss., pp. 352–3, 363–4, etc. The implicationsof this last move for the current undertaking will be obvious.173See Derrida, OG, pp. 141–64.174For the first point see OG, p. 215 (where the presence and absence are alsodescribed in the quasi-mathematical terminology of plus and minus); for the sec-ond point, OG, p. 157, and for the third point, Pharm., p. 167 (where the outsideof presence and absence is described as the Platonic epekeina tès ousias). At OG, p. 179 Derrida notes that this “logic of the supplement”—a phrase which clearlyindicates the systematic and schematic function of this structural name—allows usto enunciate contraries at the same time without contradiction.76chapter two"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Supplement sometimes as the presence which replaces the absence,sometimes as the middle-point between presence and absence, andsometimes as that which remains outside the system of presence andabsence, Derrida reveals clearly the unusually comprehensive rangeof function within the figure of (semi-) circularity and the partialfigures of transcendence and translation.Continuing to follow a sequence which can be only partially justifiedon conceptual grounds, we may consider “Différance” next: a pointat which a certain variation of linguistic usage brings questions ofspatiality and temporality to the forefront of Derrida’s discussion.With emphasis upon the spelling différence, the term signifies thespacing of a structure.175Thus, where difference corresponds eitherto the stages within the figure of (semi-) circularity or to those betweenthe figure of (semi-) circularity and the partial figures of transcen-dence and translation, these stages may be characterized as elementsof spacing. With emphasis upon the spelling différance, however, theterm signifies the temporalization of a structuring.176Given thatdifference represents either the stages within the figure of (semi-) cir-cularity or those between the figure of (semi-) circularity and thepartial figures of transcendence and translation, these stages may alsobe characterized as phases of temporalization. In a more precisesense, différence ↔différance indicates the fundamental articulationwhereby space and time are distinguished conceptually from oneanother in the first place.177No doubt because of its homonymicassociation, Différance is applied primarily to logical contexts where,in terms of the relation between repetition and ideality, the formeraspect is predominant. An example of such a logical context is theHusserlian notion of living presence.Another important structural name is that of “Re-Mark.” Thisagain represents for Derrida the minimal relation to an other,178sinceit corresponds to that moment within the figure of (semi-) circular-ity where the positive term = duality of opposites with accented term175See Diff., pp. 7–8. As the reader will note, we are taking the liberty of divid-ing “Difference” into two general structures for purposes of analysis. This is inaccordance with the general Derridean principle that difference must itself be alreadydifferentiated.176See Pos., pp. 8, 81–2, and p. 106, n. 42.177See OG, pp. 70–71, FSW, p. 219.178Excellent starting-points for discussion have been provided by Gasché, TheTain of the Mirror, pp. 217–24 and Gasché, Inventions of Difference, pp. 140–44.what is called “negative theology?”...77"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"is displaced by the negative term, or alternatively to that momentwithin the same schema where the negative term = duality of oppo-sites with transfer of accent is displaced by the combined and/ortranscendent and/or translative terms. However, Re-Mark particu-larly represents the repetition of the positive and negative terms’ displacements—often specified as addition, subtraction, or multipli-cation179—and particularly represents the asymmetry governing theseries of terms arising from that repetition. Perhaps to a greaterextent than in the case of the previous term Re-Mark crosses theboundaries between the logical, the semantic, and the syntactic. Ina manner more akin to that of “Trace” mentioned earlier, the termis utilized not only as a structure of generalized otherness (logical)but also as a structure of generalized reference (logical-semantic).180The performative aspects of the Derridean Re-Mark are also exten-sively developed. Here, we see not only the practice of performa-tivity—for example, where the proliferation of quasi-synonyms likepli(“fold”) and hymen (“hymen”) and of quasi-homonyms like marche(“step”) and marge (“margin”) reflects on the verbal level the infinitemultiplication implied by the original term on the conceptual level181—but also the theory of performativity—for example, where a nega-tive moment within the figure of (semi-) circularity identified withthe asemantic interval between semantic terms is displaced by a pos-itive moment within the same figure identified with the semanticterms surrounding the asemantic interval.182Difference, Trace, Supplement, Differance, and Re-Marktherefore consti-tute a list of important structural names. The reason why Derridain articulating the configuration and structure which we have describedapplies a variety of such names to elements in the collectivity ratherthan a single name to the collectivity as a whole is explained byconsidering the requirement of non-unity implicit in all the structuralnames but especially that of Trace. As we have seen, doubling is afundamental feature of deconstruction as opposed to Neoplatonism.183179See Derrida, DS, pp. 252, 258, 270.

Mutual reflexivity of the structures.As a result of our analy-sis of the structural names, it should be clear how each structuralname reflects the other structural names—a situation revealed byDerrida’s own references to “supplemental differences,” “supplementalre-marks,” “differential traces,” etc.—although each structural namereflects from its own unique position. The reader is invited to per-form a thought experiment by re-reading the segment from the dis-cussion of Difference onwards but taking into account everythingthat was learned after reaching the discussion of Re-Mark: an exper-imental reading which will indicate that Difference represents theduality of opposites constituting the positive term or the repetitionof the positive term’s displacement, and so forth. 2. Structural namescorresponding to the entire system. The most widely used in Derrida’s ear-lier works is “Writing.” Closely connected with this is “Dissemination”—a name emphasizing the partial figures of combination, transcendence,and translation—and “Economy.”184Derrida’s earlier works also referfrequently to “Spacing.” This term, however, relates to the individ-ual moments in the system rather than to the collectivity of thosemoments. It represents the more spatial counterpart of the moretemporal duality of repetition-ideality. 3. Structural names on the mar-gin of the system. Falling outside the system as we have described thelatter are a. Some structural names of a relatively predicative char-acter. These include “the Impossible” which represents the partialfigure of transcendence from a kind of existential viewpoint and canbe applied to all the other structural names with reference to theirtranscendent aspect—the structures can therefore be generally char-acterized as “conditions of possibility and impossibility.”185They also184For Derrida, the term “Economy” often possesses the unwelcome connotationof closure i.e. of a system lacking a transcendent moment. The latter is safeguardedby either a.stressing the disruption of the economy (see Jacques Derrida, The Giftof Death, trans. D. Wills (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1995),pp. 96–7) or b.stressing the distinction between a restricted and a general econ-omy (see FRGE, pp. 270–73). 185On this sense of “Impossible” see Jacques Derrida, Given Time I. CounterfeitMoney, trans. P.

In fact, given that the axiom on which the previous sectionof text was based actually reads “What is called ‘negative theology,’in an idiom of Graeco-Latin filiation, is a language” when statedfully, it would not be unreasonable to say that the next section oftext takes its starting-point from the qualifying phrase “in an idiomof Graeco-Latin filiation” which we have not studied so far.Derrida’s second development of the theme of negative theology188deconstruction itself as the experience of the impossible.

Once more, the discussion will be presented analytically.189(SLN 63d/Sauf 71a) The dialogic partner takes up a suggestionthat negative theology might be called a “paradoxical hyperbole.”Given that the context of translating philosophemes from one idiomto another has already been established, he observes that the expres-sion “paradoxical hyperbole” suggests the conceptual world of Greekphilosophy.(63e/71b) The first interlocutor is, however, more immediatelyconcerned with unfolding the meaning of the phrase as a combina-tion of affirmative and negative where one term also connotes excess.He therefore presents what we shall term the first intertextualsenseof negative theology by contrasting its localization and transporta-tion, its peculiar idiom and its universal translation, and its rootingand uprooting. The combination of affirmation and negation isannounced as the feature which will form the basis of a brief demon-stration or at least a working hypothesis regarding this theology.(64a/71c) The dialogic partner asks whether the translation of thisphilosopheme is related to the notion of friendship mentioned a lit-tle earlier.(64b/72a) The original speaker shifts briefly into the metalingualregister by replying that he is uncertain about the nature of nega-tive theology and is speaking tentatively on the subject. In the spiritof what is both a preliminary and a postscript, he merely wishes tointroduce the notion of negative theology implied in Plato’s Republicby means of the Greek philosophical terminology. On the basis ofthe famous passage of this work stating that the Good is epekeina tèsousias, it is possible to distinguish a schema of two terms: an affirmativeterm such as “X is . . .” and a negative term which is also an exces-sive term such as “X is beyond Being,” and a dynamic connection189The second discussion of negative theology has perhaps a more Heideggeriantone. In particular, we should note i.the implicit reading of the Neoplatonic antithe-sis of affirmative and negative divine names in terms of Heidegger’s duality ofBeing’s unconcealment and concealment (for the latter see Martin Heidegger, Whatis Called Thinking?II. 4, pp. 150–52, etc.); ii.the explicit reading of the Neoplatonists’hyperbolic divine names in terms of the Heideggerian transcendence of Dasein(seebelow, pp. 92–3). Also redolent of Heidegger is Derrida’s strategy of treating neg-ative theology first in a “Greek” manner and then in translative form.

First, the transcending move-ment corresponding to the dynamic relation between the terms ischaracterized affirmatively as an analogy and negatively as a frac-ture—this will emerge as one of the further intertextual senses ofnegative theology.(66a/76a) The dialogic partner responds to a quotation of Silesiusintroduced in support of the previous point by drawing attention tothe affirmative element represented by dogmatic assertion and thenegative element represented by the radical critique in these apho-risms. We shall call this the methodologicalsense of negative theology.(67a/77a) The first interlocutor continues to unfold the polysemyof “paradoxical hyperbole.” He observes that the complementarymoments of dogmatism and critique mentioned are not without rela-tion to the double bind of rooting and uprooting discussed at thebeginning of this exchange. Presumably, any one of the oppositionsunder discussion will exhibit such a chiastic structure.(67b/78a) The dialogic partner inserts a brief reference to Husserlianphenomenology by noting the parallelism between the negativemoments of critique and of epokhë.(67c/78b) The original speaker now presents the most elaborateinterpretation of negative theology anywhere in this text. Using thephrase “on the one hand” to introduce a listing of the more specificallynegative moments within this theology, he immediately passes to theplacing of a thesis in a parenthesis or in quotation-marks which rep-resents the negative side of what we shall call the ontological-aseman-ticsense of negative theology. Next, he begins a process of interweavingstatements of the methodological sense—negative theology conteststhe assumptions of a philosophical community—with statements ofone of the intertextual senses—negative theology involves the rup-ture of a contract. These processes are said to have initiated a seriesof recurrent movements, in other words a repetitive structure, and190For discussion of this passage see pp. 92–3.82chapter two"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"a sequence of outbidding excesses.191Using the phrase “on the otherhand” to introduce an inventory of the more specifically affirmativemoments within the theology, the speaker quickly passes to the main-tenance of the ontotheological viewpoint which represents what weshall call the ontological-intertextualsense of negative theology and tothe remaining as a countersignature which represents another of whatwe earlier termed the intertextual senses of negative theology. Therenow follows a sequence of further statements on the affirmative sideof negative theology in which this affirmative moment is stated eitherwith or without reference to the negative moment. This begins witha combination of what we shall call the first intertextual sense—neg-ative theology involves the necessity of a divine name—and what weshall call the asemanticsense—in negative theology employment ofthe phrase il fautmeans both that the divine name must be appliedand that it must be removed. Next comes a statement of the firstontological sense of negative theology which has not been mentionedso far: even to say “God is not,” or “God is neither this nor that,”or “Being is not” is still to declare Being qua being. Finally, thereis a statement of what we shall call the second intertextual sense—negative theology involves the referential transcendence of God—preceded and followed by comments about the relation to negativetheology of certain other discourses like promising, testifying, andpraying.(68a/81a) The dialogic partner picks up the reference to theseother discourses in order to initiate a shift, in understanding nega-tive theology, from stating a contrast between negative and affirmativeto stating their combination or possibly transcendence. Given his useof the other discourses, is Silesius really to be considered a negativetheologian?(68b/81b) The first interlocutor replies that Silesius both is and isnot a negative theologian—a situation which is by no means unusualsince negative theology always contains something of another dis-course while other discourses always contain something of negativetheology. This restatement of the first intertextual sense of negativetheology leads via a syntactical connection the significance of whichwill soon be apparent to a combined restatement of the first onto-logical sense and all three interpretedsenses.

It states the Being of God beyondthe idol or image that Being is—combination of affirmative and neg-ative sides of the first ontological sense with assimilation of negativeand excessive. It responds to the true name of God beyond the nameby which we know him—combination of affirmative and negativesides of the first interpreted sense with assimilation of negative andexcessive. In short, it desires to say what is proper of God.(69a/82a) The dialogic partner picks up the reference to the properin order to introduce the final phase of the exchange: a restatementof the first ontological sense of negative theology in which properand giving are substituted for being.(69b/83a) The original speaker points out that according to Silesius,if God has anything proper to himself, it is the property of havingno properties and that according to Plotinus, if the Good gives ofitself, it is the gift of what it does not possess. This restatement ofthe first ontological sense of negative theology is now syntacticallyconnected with a statement of the implication between the thirdinterpreted sense and the first intertextual sense of negative theol-ogy. As the speaker concludes, the process by which negative the-ology passes over the edge of itself in ontological productivity is alsothe process whereby it passes over the edge of itself in textual trans-latability. Clearly both the restatement and the statement deal withcombinations of the affirmative and negative sides of negative the-ology with assimilation of the negative to the excessive.The exchange between the two voices recalls certain features ofthe earlier exchange. The implicit distinction between negative the-ology and the discourse about negative theology is indicated in thereferences to the uncertain and provisional nature of the hypothe-ses to be formulated regarding this theology.192The emphasis uponthe formalization of negative theology which was the main theme ofthe earlier discussion is also retained, the only difference being thatof the three types of formalization mentioned earlier—the proposi-tion, the antithesis of affirmative and negative, and the set of propo-sitions—it is the second which now comes to the fore. The introductionof temporal elements into the characterization of negative theology192SLN, pp. 63d, 64b.84chapter two"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"is evidenced by the references to the preliminary and postscriptivenature of the discussion to be undertaken concerning this theology,193to the series of recurrent movements whereby different readings ofnegative theology have been proposed, and so forth.194However, thepresent exchange also extends the terms of reference of the earlierexchange considerably. In particular, the notion of translation195comesinto prominence where we are asked to think no longer simply ofthe original idiom but also of many formal analogues of negativetheology. This concept which appears briefly at the beginning andend of the segment is illustrated with a number of striking applica-tions—we have already been drawing attention to this feature bydistinguishing on the one hand the “ontological” senses of negativetheology together with the interpretations of those ontological senseswhich here represent the original idiom and on the other hand the“intertextual” senses of negative theology which here represent theformal analogues. Explanation of the principles underlying the var-ious applications of the concept is however reserved for a laterexchange between the two speakers.It is within the extended notion of translatable negative theologythat we are to understand the various features suggested by thephrase “paradoxical hyperbole.” This paradoxical element is clearlythe combination of affirmative and negative within the divine name(s)which represents the combination of positive and negative momentswithin the figure of (semi-) circularity.196Given that the presence ofparadox forces the interpreter to shift the meaning of one or bothof the terms involved in order to achieve meaningful continuance—a situation similar to that obtaining with tautology—it is not sur-prising to find the revelation of a dynamically polysemous structurewithin the combination of affirmative and negative to be a themeof the present exchange.For identificatory purposes, we have already assigned labels to thedifferent senses which Derrida himself seems to assign to such com-binations. These labels were:193SLN, pp. 64b, 69b.194SLN, p. 67c.195In what follows, we shall see an application of what we have previously termedthe “figure” of translation. See p. 64ff.196See above p. 64ff.

With 5 the application of the formula seemingly combines theontological and the intertextual approaches described above.198Finally,6 expands the framework of discussion from the semantic sphere—including the reading of Being and the reading of the text—to theasemantic sphere, 7 representing the relation between the more lim-ited and more expanded sphere themselves.The next phase of Derrida’s development of the theme of nega-tive theology is introduced by references to the remainder and tokhòraand concluded with references to khòra. We therefore find adiscursive structure which is simultaneously a repetition and an inver-sion of the discursive structure used earlier.The importance of both the remainder and place is indicated inthe following passage:199– Is this place created by God? Is it part of the play? Or else is itGod himself? Or even what precedes, in order to make them pos-sible, both God and his Play? In other words it remains to beknown if this nonsensible (invisible and inaudible) place is openedby God, by the name of God (which would again be some otherthing, perhaps), or if it is “older” than the time of creation, thantime itself, than history, narrative, word, etc. It remains to beknown (beyond knowing) if the place is opened by appeal (response,the event that calls for the response, revelation, history, etc.), orif it remains impassively foreign, like Khòra, to everything that takesits place and replaces itself and plays within this place, includingwhat is named God. Let’s call this the test of Khòra...– Do we have any choice? Why choose between the two? Is it pos-sible? But it is true that these two “places,” these two experiencesof place, these two ways are no doubt of an absolute heterogeneity.One place excludes the other, one (sur)passes the other, one does198One says “seemingly” because this is apparently the function of the extremelygeneral logical-semantic dichotomy of same-other at this point.

Each thing,each being, you, me, the other, each X, each name, and eachname of God can become the example of other substitutable X’s.A process of absolute formalization. Any other is totally other. Aname of God, in a tongue, a phrase, a prayer, becomes an exam-ple of the name and of names of God, then of names in general.It is necessaryto choose the bestof the examples (and it is neces-sarily the absolute good, theagathon, which finds itself to be, then,epekeina tès ousias), but it is the best as example: for what it is andfor what it is not, for what it is and for what it represents, replaces,exemplifies. And the “it is necessary” (the best) is also an exam-ple of all the “it is necessary’s” that there are and can be.–Il fautdoes not only mean it is necessary, but, in French, etymo-logically, “it lacks” or “is wanting.” The lack or lapse is never faraway.As in the case of the earlier passage200the attention of the two inter-locutors is now shifting from a reading of negative theology to areading of the interrelation of negative theology and deconstruction,and as in the case of the earlier passage the phases of this shift con-stitute the remainder which must be thought of negative theologyand the place in which one must think negative theology. However,although the general course of discussion is similar in the two cases,the distinction between the negative-theological and deconstructiveelements themselves is henceforth more difficult to maintain.Derrida’s negative-theological and deconstructive discussion unfoldsalong a trajectory formed by the identification of one of the anti-thetical moments of negative theology with the “exemplary” (exem-plaire) moment of deconstruction and of the other antithetical momentof negative theology with the “substitutive” (substitutable) moment ofdeconstruction.201Given the deliberate ambivalence of Neoplatonictexts as to whether it is the negative moment which represents excessin relation to the defect represented by the affirmative moment or200See pp. 53–6.201For exemplary see SLN, pp. 76a, 76c, 77b; for substitutive see SLN, p. 76a.88chapter two"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"the other way around, Derrida was perhaps wise not to specify whichantithetical moment of negative theology was to be identified withwhich moment of deconstruction in the present instance. Nevertheless,the identification of one or other of the two antithetical moments ofnegative theology with either the exemplary or the substitutive momentof deconstruction is shown by the presence of such features as thePlatonic epekeina tès ousiasand the simultaneity of conjunction anddisjunction in the same context.202But we should make more precise what is meant by the exem-plary and the substitutive. Clearly the exemplary is whatever termmay be postulated as “the best” (le meilleur) with respect to the seriesof related terms of which it is a member.203It can be identified withthe realm of the logically necessary and universal,204and with seman-ticism in general.205The substitutive is conversely whatever term maybe postulated as “the indifferent” (l’indifférent) with respect to the seriesof related terms of which it is a member.206It must be identifiedwith the sphere of the logically contingent and singular,207and withthe interplay of the semantic and asemantic.208That the contrastbetween the exemplary and the substitutive can be stated in bothexemplary and substitutable terms is indicated by what is termed theparadox of the example: i.e. the homonymy which exists in bothFrench and English between “(good) example” (bon exemple) and “(any)example” (exemple quelconque).209After situating and defining the philosophical problematic, a mech-anism combining the exemplary and substitutive with the terms Godand place can be activated.

Name is substitutable withGod—in that Name can be exemplary when it is a proper nameand substitutable when it is a common noun.212On the other hand,Name’s function is not analogous with God’s function—Name is notsubstitutable with God in that Name can indicate that reference isindispensable or that reference is dispensable.213At this point, a mech-210SLN, pp. 75b–76e.

The question of the relation between God and Name is herepresented in a simplified manner, given that Derrida has applied much effort toexploring the discoursive context surrounding this relation. Here, we should note—in connection with Name—that the relation between the exemplary and the substi-tutive corresponds 1. to the relation between reference (in the Fregean sense) andreference (in the Heideggerian sense) (see Derrida, OG, p. 110), 2. to the relationbetween proper name and common noun (see Derrida, OG, pp. 108–12, Glas, trans.R. Rand and J.P., Leavey, Jr. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press: 1986), pp.86b, 207b); 3. to the relation between proper sense and metaphorical meaning (seeDerrida, “White Mythology. Metaphor in the Text of Philosophy,” in MP, pp.233–4); 4. to the relation between ontological presence and differential play (seeDerrida, PC, pp. 356–60). For Derrida, Godenters into the equation because hisrelation to his world corresponds to the proper name’s relation to the commonnoun (see Derrida, “Edmond Jabès and the Question of the Book,” in WD, pp.181–2). For Derrida, the authorenters into the picture because his relation to histext corresponds likewise to the proper name’s relation to the common noun (SeeDerrida, Signéponge/Signsponge, trans. Richard Rand (New York: Columbia U.P., 1984),pp. 28–30, PC, p. 357).

Among the extensive possibilities openedup by such a process of translation,215the relation between negativetheology and deconstruction is discussed implicitly in terms of thedichotomy of exemplary and substitutive in one section,216and therelation between Neoplatonic negative theology and Christian neg-ative theology explicitly in terms of the same dichotomy on two sep-arate occasions.217In the former case the argument means thatnegative theology may be postulated as the best with respect to theseries of related doctrines of which it is the member, and that decon-struction may be treated as the best with respect to the series ofrelated methods of which it is a member; it also means that nega-tive theology may be postulated as the indifferent with respect to214SLN, pp. 75b–76c.

We may begin here with the question of anintertext.In one passage (64c–65a) there is an important citation of Heidegger.Here, Derrida establishes a connection between the Neoplatonicnotion of transcendence as applied to the status of God—the deity’stranscendence being indicated by a negative divine name just as thedeity’s immanence is shown by an affirmative divine name—and theHeideggerian notion of transcendence as applied to the movementof Dasein.219Since this connection through the term “hyperbole” isverbal but not conceptual, we may postpone its discussion untilanother occasion. However, the suggestion of a further connectionwhich is conceptually but not verbally hyperbolic requires a few com-ments here. This involves the structural identity and difference betweenthe movement of the Heideggerian Daseinwhich is sometimes calledtranscendence and the movement of the Neoplatonic Soul which isusually called reversion rather than transcendence.220The identity218At SLN, p. 73b the question of the similarity governing the relation betweenthe exemplary and the substitutive in the case of negative theology and decon-struction is raised. The answer is apparently: articulation of the relation betweenexemplarity and substitutability as such.219The connection is made via Plato’s notion of epekeina tès ousias.220In general, Derrida seems to assume the sense of “transcendence” elaboratedby Heidegger in Sein und Zeit. In the latter’s introd. §7, 38 three meanings of tran-scendence are distinguished: 1. that of Being —which is beyond every being; 2. thatof Dasein’s Being —the possibility of radical individuation; 3. that of Dasein’s disclo-sure of Being as transcendental knowledge together with the disclosedness of Beingas phenomenological truth to Dasein. Later in the text Heidegger introduces the fur-ther senses of transcendence: 4. that of world (Being and Time, trans. J. Macquarrieand E. Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell, 1962) §75, 389; §80, 419)—with which thequestion of “objectivity” is connected (BT §13, 60–61, §69, 350–51, 363–4) andwhich is founded on temporality (BT §69, 364, 366)—; and 5. that of the ecstatichorizonal unity of past, present, and future (BT §69, 360, 365). All these senses oftranscendence are closely related and opposed—as an “ontological” mode (BT §32, 153)—to the traditional notion of transcendence (BT §43, 201, §65, 326). Aftera further attempt to define transcendence in terms of the “ontological difference”(see EOG, pp. 105–7, The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, trans. M. Heim (Bloomingtonand Indianapolis: Indiana U.P.: 1984) §11–14, pp. 159–219), Heidegger maintainsthe basic concept of Daseinrealizing itself by surpassing itself without the technical92chapter two"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"between the two movements obviously resides in the feature of cir-cularity. But this identity is balanced by a set of differences sincefor Heidegger, there is no subject-object dichotomy where Daseinreturns from the possibilities which it projects whereas in Neoplatonism,subject and object are contrasted in that Soul returns to Intellectwhich produces it. In a general sense one might say that accordingto the Heideggerian approach transcendence is a hermeneutical mat-ter whereas according to the Neoplatonic doctrine reversion is anontological process.221Thus, for Heidegger the movement of Dasein’stranscendence involves the projection of various interpretative fore-structures within which to disclose beings by surpassing them whereasin Neoplatonism the movement of Soul’s reversion consists of pass-ing through various levels of reality which are themselves principlescapable of reversion. Moreover, for Heidegger, there is no atempo-ral-temporal dichotomy where Daseinprojects the three ecstasies oftemporality only in relation to one another whereas in Neoplatonism,atemporal and temporal are contrasted in that Soul constitutes thetemporal flow by emanating from Intellect which precedes it.Another aspect of Derrida’s second account of negative theologywhich remains for us to think is the relation between that account,the (a)semiotic square, and the figure of (semi-) circularity.222If oneconsiders the first ontological sense of negative theology where Godis said to have attribute xand not have attribute x, one notices anantithetical structure in which a positive term—the possession of anattribute—is contrasted with a negative term—the non-possession ofan attribute. The connection established by Derrida between theNeoplatonic and Heideggerian notions of transcendence requires aterm “transcendence” (see the discussion of the Nietzschean superman in WCT1.5, p. 48ff.)

Here, the movement of the Neoplatonic Soul calledreversion might be interpreted as a displacement of the negativeterm, through the mediation of the combined term, by eithera neu-tral term ora second realization of the combined term. This wouldconstitute a sequential process in which the figure of (semi-) circu-larity is completed by the partial figures of transcendence and trans-lation viewed as alternatives. The movement of the HeideggerianDasein called transcendence might be interpreted as a displacementof the negative term, without the mediation of the combined term,by botha neutral term and a second realization of the combined term.This would represent a sequential process in which the figure of(semi-) circularity is completed by the partial figures of transcendenceand translation viewed as simultaneous.223If one considers the restate-ment of the first ontological sense of negative theology where Godis said to have the property of not having any property, one detectsan antithetical structure in which a positive term—the possession ofa property—is contrasted with a negative term—the non-possessionof properties—together with a reversal of this antithetical structureso that a positive term—the non-possession of a property—is con-trasted with a negative term—the possession of properties.224This latter analysis relates particularly to the main citation ofPlotinus in Derrida’s essay (69b), the importance accorded to theNeoplatonic philosopher’s contribution to the argument being sug-gested by the unusual inclusion of a textual reference (EnneadsVI.7, 15–17) and a Greek quotation (kai tou didomenou to didon epekeinaèn). Among the ideas which Derrida finds in Plotinus’ text, the notionthat the Good gives what it does not have provides a crucial expla-nation of both the paradoxical and the hyperbolic element in neg-ative theology by showing that the Good has simultaneously a negativeaspect—non-possession of property xin the sense of inherence of xin itself—and an affirmative aspect—possession of property xin the223Since the comparison between the two philosophemes itself is one betweenan and...orand a both...and, the argument of this entire paragraph represents afurther instance of the multiplication of semiotic squares.224Further relations between Derrida’s second account of negative theology andthe (a)semiotic square or schema of (semi-) circularity are possible.

However, Derrida himself does not pursuethese interpretative possibilities to any degree.226Further questions concerning the relation between Derrida’s secondaccount of negative theology and the (a)semiotic square are possible.225Derrida’s apparent finding in Plotinus’ text of the further notion that the Goodgives without engendering —i.e. in a non-causal manner—would suggest what wehave termed interpretative distance (see pp. 38–41). In fact, Enn.VI. 7 insistentlymaintains the causal relation between the Good and other things, for example bysaying that one derives any utterance about the Good from its effects (Enn. VI. 7[38] 36, 6–10), and that the Good is cause of being, life, and intellect (Enn. VI. 7[38] 16, 27–9, VI. 7 [38] 17, 9–12, VI. 7 [38] 23, 19–22). Such references tocausality further imply that the negative theology of this treatise at least remainswithin a predominantly ontotheological context.226For the Good as simultaneously nothing and everything see Enn. VI. 7 [38]32, 12–13; for the three methods of discourse about the Good see Enn. VI. 7 [38]36, 6–8. Since Derrida cites Enn.VI. 7 as a test case for negative theology—andrightly so—it is also worth noting how this treatise does and does not illustrate thefeatures of negative theology on which he focuses in Sauf le Nom. At SLN, p. 49bDerrida mentions a) the poetical metaphoricity and b) the onto-logical formalismof negative theology. Now it is clear that Plotinus employs (a) particularly whendescribing the relation between Intellect, the intelligibles, and the Good in termsof light and vision (see Enn. VI. 7 [38] 16, 24–31, VI. 7 [38] 22, 33–6). However,it is equally clear that Plotinus avoids (b) both in emphasizing the polysemy withina single divine name like “Good” (see Enn.VI. 7 [38] 18. 1ff.) and in excludingpropositions of the firm “S is P” from discourse about the First (see Enn.

Adouble hospitality: the one that has the form of Babel (the con-struction of the Tower, the appeal to universal translation, butalso the violent imposition of the name, of the tongue, and of theidiom) andthe one (another, the same) of the deconstructionof theTower of Babel. The two designs are moved by a certain desireof universal community, beyond the desert of an arid formaliza-tion, that is beyond economy itself. But the two must deal withwhat they claim to avoid: the untreatable itself. The desire of God,God as the other name of desire, deals in the desert with radicalatheism.– In listening to you, one has more and more the feeling that desertis the other name, if not the proper place, of desire. And the attimes oracular tone of apophasis, to which we alluded a few min-utes ago, often resounds in a desert, which does not always comedown to preaching in the desert.– The movement toward the universal tongue oscillates between for-malism, or the poorest, most arid, in effect most desertlike techno-scientificity, and a sort of universal hive of inviolable secrets, ofidioms that are never translated except as untranslatable seals. Inthis oscillation, “negative theology” is caught, comprised and com-prehensive at once. But the Babelian narrative (construction and230In the passages analyzed here, the three models are illustrated with the term“Place.” It must be remembered that one can insert into this mechanism a.theterms “God” and “Name” here associated with Place; b. other Derridean generalstructures like Difference, Trace, and Supplement. 231SLN, p. 80a–c/Sauf 102b–103b.what is called “negative theology?”...97"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"deconstruction at once) is still a history.

Thereis where that happens and where there are those “things” called,for example, negative theology and its analogues, deconstructionand its analogues, this colloquium here and its analogues.In this passage, Derrida is discussing the opposition between lan-guage—expressed allegorically as the construction of the Tower ofBabel by the Shemites—and deconstruction—allegorically expressedas the destruction of that tower by God—, and making the specificpoints that language consists of the project of universal translationand the imposition of the proper name and that the oppositionbetween language and deconstruction is placed within Khòra.232Giventhat negative theology has been classified as a language throughoutthe argument of “Sauf le Nom,” we have here an account of theinterrelation between negative theology and deconstruction consis-tent with what has gone before. There is, however, a new element.That is Derrida’s suggestion that language oscillates between for-malism—“the most impoverished techno-specificity” (la techno-specifitéla plus pauvre)—and non-formalism—“a universal hive of inviolablesecrets...and intranslatable seals” (ruche universelle de secrets invio-lables...sceaux intraduisables)—and that negative theology is caught inthe oscillation. Although Derrida provides no explanation of whatthis collectivity of secrets is, he has undoubtedly introduced an aspectof negative theology which will demand a further reflection on ourpart.233232See Jacques Derrida, “Des Tours de Babel,” trans.

An attempt at read-ing this subtext will form our next starting-point.Derrida’s Circonfessionrepresents one part of the volume JacquesDerridaby Geoffrey Bennington and Jacques Derrida1in which theDerridabasewritten by Bennington about Derrida is juxtaposed withthe Circonfessionwritten by Derrida in response simultaneously toAugustine’s Confessionsand to Bennington’s Derridabase. The purposeof these texts and of their juxtaposition—as explained by the vol-ume’s introductory page, by various comments made by Derridahimself on other occasions,2and by statements in the Circonfessionitself—might be construed as follows: 1. (With regard to Augustine)To show Derrida’s care and admiration for Augustine and yet todeconstruct certain axioms in the Confessions, this project being a seri-ous play starting from certain analogies e.g. between the Algerianorigins and the mothers of Augustine and Derrida respectively; 2.(With regard to Bennington) To surprise Bennington, who has in hisDerridabaseattempted to systematize Derrida’s thought, in the man-ner of an interactive computer program, with material escaping thatsystematization; 3.

In commenting on Circonfessionin par-ticular, Caputo argues that the work amounts to a confession ofDerrida’s religion—a Judaism without God—and a testimony to acertain conversion. Although its deliberately disruptive relation toBennington’s text renders it elusive in respect of formal analysis, onecan distinguish among its primary themes that of circumcision: afigure convertible with scission or incision in general but especiallyrepresenting the cut from Truth. This relation to Truth, where theprimacy of the interrogative is elicited from a reading of Augustine’squestion: “What do I love when I love my God?” and the primacyof the performative from a reading of Augustine’s Iohannine notionof “making/doing the Truth,” is a non-transcendent one.5It is con-vertible with the relation to the Other, the relation to God—specificallyin the form of the name of God—, and the relation to Death. It isalso convertible with the secret truth which is the secret severed fromtruth. This secret—that there is no secret truth, conscious or uncon-scious, concealed below the surface of the text—is literature.6That the encounter between (Neo-) Platonism and Deconstruc-tion can be detected as a subtext of Derrida’s and Caputo’s decon-structive reading of Augustine emerges from a consideration of thequestions of reversion (or conversion), destination, temporality, perfor-mativity, and number (or rhythm).

In Neoplatonism—where the8For the notion of juxtaposition see chapter 1, pp. 24–8.9For the notions of exemplarity and substitutability see chapter 2, pp. 89–91. 10“Reversion” for Augustine represents an evolving complex of notions which issimultaneously Neoplatonic and Pauline. AtDCDX. 23ff. Augustine lengthily dis-cusses Porphyry’s De Regressu Animae(= “On the Return of the Soul”). If the opin-ion of most modern scholars that this work influenced Augustine already in hisearlier years and perhaps at the time of his conversion is correct, then we can tracean evolution whereby the pagan philosophical doctrine concerning the soul’s rever-sion, actualization, and formation, is gradually refined in terms of St. Paul’s teach-ing about conformation to God and human renewal.

In both his earlier more philo-sophical and later more scriptural works, Augustine’s application ofthis mode of thinking is characterized by an awareness of its differingconceptual implications with regard to different areas of speculation.We might classify the latter in a quasi-geometrical manner under theheadings of: i. “Anthropological configuration” (ethical-epistemological).A bi-directional structure of descent and ascent culminating in a self-transcending term or else—with the first moment unexpressed—auni-directional structure of ascent culminating in a self-transcendingterm. The stable element which occurs as a first term in the paganNeoplatonic doctrine appears as a third term in the Augustinianreworking. This is described as remaining; ii. “Cosmological con-figuration” (ontological). A bi-directional structure of procession (orunity) and reversion (or equality) culminating in a mediating or syn-thesizing term. The stable element which occurs as a first term inthe pagan Neoplatonic system again appears as a third term inAugustine’s reworking.

Why was the soul assigned tobody?, 5. What is the quality of the soul when joined to body?, and6. What is the quality of the soul when separated from body?14Thefirst question is answered by saying that, if “source” means origi-nating principle, the source is God or that, if “source” means con-stitutive principle or principles, the source is the soul’s own “substance”(substantia).15The second question is answered by saying that the soulis similar to God.16The answer to the third question takes up mostof the treatise and provides the latter’s title (quanta →de Quantitate).the figure of (semi-) circularity and the partial figures of transcendence and trans-lation, then deconstruction itself governs the relation between deconstruction andAugustinian Neoplatonism. 14Augustine, De Quantitate Animae, recensuitWolfgang Hörmann, CSEL 89 (Wien:Tempsky, 1986) 1. 1. The text of De Quantitate Animaecan be divided into two partsin accordance with its allocutionary structure: part 1 (DQA 1. 2–32. 69) a dialoguein which Augustine and Evodius address one another (with God, the illuminator asthird party) and part 2 (DQA33. 70ff.) a dialogic monologue in which Augustineaddresses himself (with God, the illuminator as further element). With respect toaddress and destination, certain parallels can be established between Augustine’stext and i. the combination of the Derridabaseand the Circonfessionwhere the struc-ture of the relation between Derrida, Augustine, and Bennington mirrors that betweenEvodius, Augustine, and God; and ii. the Circonfession itself where the ambiguity ofthe relation between Augustine and himself or God mirrors that between Derridaand himself, or you, or the Other, or God (the divergences being that in i. theleading role is shifted from the teacher (Augustine) in the first configuration to thedeconstructor (Derrida) in the second, and that in ii. the addressee’s ambiguity isincreased by substitutability from the first configuration to the second (God →you,the Other, God). These parallels are important because they reveal to what extentthe Augustinian movement of reversion which they embody overlaps with theDerridean movement of deconstruction.

Anim. 3. 4,the definitive answer supplied at 13. 22–14. 24 being followed bythe raising of certain supplementary issues. Augustine introduces thediscussion of the third question by pointing out that “quantity” couldmean either spatial extent—projection into 1, 2, or 3 dimensions—or extent of power (quantum valeat).18Although the fact that it isalready held by faith that God is incorporeal and that the soul issimilar to God would lead us immediately to such an interpretationof quantity, Augustine endeavors to reject the first and affirm thesecond interpretation of quantity by proving rationally a) that incor-poreal things exist and b) that soul is such an incorporeal thing.It is relatively easy to prove to Evodius that incorporeal thingsexist: in fact, it is suggested that he is alreadyin possession of suchknowledge. By means of a striking argument based on the implicitassumption that superiority of something implies that something’sexistence, Augustine proves that a tree is not nothing, that justice issuperior to a tree, and that justice is therefore not nothing. But atree is a corporeal thing in that, if one takes away from it the cor-poreal dimensions of length, width, and height, the tree is removed.On the other hand justice is something incorporeal in that, whenone takes away the same corporeal dimensions of length, width, andheight, justice remains. As a consequence of this reasoning, Evodiusis prepared to admit that incorporeal things are superior to corpo-real things and therefore exist but not yet that soul belongs to theclass of incorporeal things that are superior to corporeal things andtherefore exist.1917DQA36. 80–81. 18DQA3. 4.19DQA4. 5. That Evodius is already in possession of the knowledge that incor-poreal things exist follows from the atemporality of the transcendent truth which isaccessible through reminiscence and/or illumination. Since the history of Augustine’sendeavor to retain the transcendent object of knowledge while rejecting the pre-existent subject which knows has been written on many occasions, we shall notrehearse the details here beyond noting that Augustine’s allusion to the Platonicphilosopheme of anamnesistypifies his adherence to the so-called “metaphysics ofpresence” (see pp. 2–4). For an interesting recent attempt to read this positiondeconstructively and temporally see Jean-Louis Chrétien The Unforgettable and theUnhoped For, trans. J. Bloechl (New York: Fordham U.P., 2002), pp. 1–39.104chapter three"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Augustine replies that this further demonstration will require aseries of steps. As a first phase of this more circuitous process, Evodiusis induced to hypothesize that the soul has three spatial dimensionsin the same manner that the mind has three spatial dimensions ormore precisely that the soul, by being simultaneously inside and out-side the body, has a space co-extensive with the body’s space. Butthere is the relation between soul and memory to consider: does thisnot imply some greater extendedness? Augustine here explains thatthe soul, in being able to recall distant places, has a space extend-ing beyond the body’s space and therefore does not have spatial tri-dimensionality in the same manner that mind has spatial tri-dimensionality. Clearly this represents an altogether better concep-tion of the nature of soul.20A more detailed investigation of length, width, and height is needed,however: an analysis in which the possibility of thinking length—which can also be called the “line”—apart from the other dimen-sions comes to the fore. Augustine reiterates the necessity of applyinga roundabout method since we must not only attain knowledge butretain the knowledge—the superiority of retention is explicitly stated—and since we should not only follow someone’s authority but trustour own reason. Evodius invokes “reason” (ratio) to be their guide.Augustine counters that this task must be left to “God” (deus).21The second phase of the more circuitous process announced ear-lier consists of a geometrical exercise. In the course of a livelyexchange between Augustine and Evodius, a series of geometricalfigures is constructed and then arranged in a hierarchy of value.Among figures constructed by using three or four straight lines theequilateral triangle is described as superior to the isosceles or sca-lene triangle because it reveals a greater “equality” (aequalitas) in hav-ing all its angles and lines equal; quadrilateral figures are consideredsuperior to triangular figures because of the formers’ greater equal-ity: the quadrilaterals have angles opposite angles whereas the tri-angles have angles opposite lines; the square is described as superiorto the rhombus because it reveals a greater equality in having allits angles and lines equal; the figure constructed by extending a sin-gle line—the circle—is considered superior to the figures constructed20DQA4. 6–5. 9. 21DQA6. 10–7. 12.margins of augustine105"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"by using three of our straight lines because of the former’s greaterequality: no angle breaks the equality of the circle from whose cen-ter equal lines can be drawn to any part of the boundary.22Thisdiscussion in which superiority is represented by more equality iscomplemented by another argument in which superiority is repre-sented by less divisibility and less dependence. In the continuationof the dialogue between Augustine and Evodius, it is now the basicelements of geometry which are arranged in a hierarchy of value:the solid is divisible in three directions and depends on the plane,the line, and the point; the plane is divisible in two directions anddepends on the line and the point; the line is divisible in one direc-tion and depends on the point, and the point is not divisible in anydirection.23Having led Evodius through such arguments, Augustine underlinesthe fact which is most relevant to the discussion of soul. That is:although it is obvious that the nature of body depends upon thesimultaneous presence of length, width, and height, and that neitherlength, nor width, nor height can be present in body without theother two, the geometrical exercise has shown in practice that thecognitive part of the soul—the “intelligence” (intellegentia)—can per-ceive even the line separately. This in its turn proves that the dimen-sions of body are incorporeal and that the soul, since it perceivesits object by being similarto the latter and judges its object by beingsuperiorto the latter, must be not only similar to but superior to theincorporeal dimensions.24Finally—and here the function of the rea-son, which is the soul’s “more excellent and almost only sight” (excel-lentior et paene solus aspectus), in finding itself is stressed—this reinforcesthe conclusion accepted earlier that incorporeal things are superiorto corporeal things and adds the further conclusion that soul belongsto the class of such incorporeal things.25At this point, we should take a detour from the journey under-taken by Augustine and Evodius and consider what the initial dia-logue of De Quantitate Animaeis telling us about the soul’s reversion.That the two interlocutors have been implicitly articulating the phases22DQA8. 13–11. 17.23DQA11. 17–12. 21.24DQA13. 22–14. 23.25DQA14. 24–15. 25.

Of the various possibilitiesalready sketched in the abstract, it is the unidirectional and self-tran-scending model of the reversion which seems to be at issue betweenAugustine and Evodius.This model can be illustrated with a number of other texts.26Atleast in the philosophical context, the reversion begins with doubt:for a conscious being the act of doubting is always accompanied bythe certainty that one is doubting.27This initial truth guides whatAugustine often describes as an ascent through stages: for examplein De Vera Religionewhere our perception that perfect unity and per-fect equality cannot be found in corporeal things forces us to acknowl-edge the existence of a realm beyond space and time—an aestheticmotivation for ascent—and again where our realization that the ratio-nal life is subject to the mutability of error compels us to postulatethe existence of an immutable standard of truth28—an epistemolog-ical motivation for ascent—or in Confessioneswhere, having passedfrom an inquiry about the truth of judgments to the discovery ofunchangeable Truth, the soul passes from the bodily to exterior sense,from exterior sense to interior sense, from interior sense to reason-ing, from reasoning to intelligence, and from intelligence—“in theflash of a trembling glance” (in ictu trepidantis aspectus)—to Being itself.29The model of the reversion presented in these passages implies alogical and metaphysical structure which is at the greatest impor-tance for understanding Augustine’s thought: namely, an arrange-ment of terms in an order of superiority and inferiority. This ideahas already been a recurrent motif in De Quantitate Animae—one mayrecall the initial argument that incorporeality is superior to corpo-reality, the methodological comments that the non-3-dimensionaldefinition of soul is better than the 3–dimensional one and that theretention of a truth achieved by argument is superior to the attainment26Apart from the passage quoted below, for unidirectionality see DBV1. 2–3,DLAI. 12. 24ff., for transcendence DLAIII. 25. 76, DVR39. 72; 43. 80.27DVR39. 73.28DVR30. 54–31. 57.29Conf.

Such statements provide further evidence that thedialogue has been implicitly concerned with the reversion.In other texts, the arrangement of superior and inferior terms—which we shall henceforth call the axiological structure—is specifiedfrom three viewpoints: 1. Concerning the superior and inferior items. Augustinemost frequently speaks of God as superior to Soul and of Soul assuperior to Body30(“God” being substitutable with “Truth,” etc.)although sometimes he subdivides the Soul in order to speak ofReason as superior to Life and of Life as superior to sense;312.Concerning the modes of superiority. These are delineated either A. byassociating selected superior and inferior terms with the items, forexample, God has mutability neither in time nor space, Soul hasmutability in time but not in space, and Body has mutability in timebut not in space, and Body has mutability both in time and inspace;32or B. by associating certain active and passive terms withany pair of superior-inferior items in the hierarchy: for example,making and made, judging and judged, ordering and ordered, andsubjecting and subjected;333. Concerning the supreme item. Augustinenaturally assigns this status to God (“God” again being substitutablewith “Truth,” etc.).34The model of the reversion presented in these passages implies afurther logical and metaphysical structure which must be taken into30See Mus.

Of course, this theme will later be taken up by Anselm ofCanterbury.108chapter three"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"account: namely, an arrangement of terms as a set of negative andaffirmative oppositions. Although this idea has not been presentedsystematically in De Quantitate Animae—such a system world involvea sequence of terms such that each item in some respect or respectshas either a. a negative character in opposition to the previous item’saffirmative or b. an affirmative character in opposition to the pre-vious item’s negative character—nevertheless there have already beencertain tentative approaches to its formulation. For example, the ini-tial argument that incorporeal things exist and the second phase ofthe more circuitous argument that soul is such an incorporeal thingboth illustrate the abstractive process in showing that, despite thenegation of one, two, or three spatial dimensions, certain thingsremain intact. On the other hand, the first phase of the more cir-cuitous argument that soul is an incorporeal illustrates the refutativeprocess in showing that the comparison of the soul to the mind interms of tri-dimensionality must be denied.In other texts, the arrangement of negative and affirmative terms—which we shall henceforth call the combinatory structure (althoughit would be more precise to call it the combinatory-axiological struc-ture)35—is specified from two viewpoints: 1. Concerning the applicationof negative and affirmative terms. Augustine most frequently speaks of God(“God being substitutable with “Truth”, etc.) using the negation ofan inferior term and the affirmation of a superior term. He also fre-quently speaks of Soul, Body, or created things using the oppositeof the term which he uses in speaking of God.36Only on rare occa-sions does Augustine refer to God using the negation of a superiorterm and the affirmation of an inferior term;372. Concerning the modesof application of negation and affirmation. These can be subdivided into:A. application of discrete and single terms.

Given that the entire dia-logue De Quantitate Animaerepresents an account of the reversion, andgiven that on the one hand the work’s title and the first three ques-tions of Evodius recall the notions of substance, quality, and quan-tity mentioned in Aristotle’s Categoriaeand that on the other handthe answer to Evodius’ second question alludes to the book of Genesis’reference to God’s creation of man in his own image, then the rever-sion is articulated within a textuality which is both philosophical andbiblical.41The crucial role in establishing this intertextual frameworkin undoubtedly played by memory. This faculty performs a mediat-ing function within the reversion by combining a lower phase directedtowards sensible things with a higher phase directed towards thedivine Truth;42it has the ability to combine its contents—includingthe teachings of the philosophers and sacred writers—in a variety ofways;43moreover the faculty performs its mediating function withinthe reversion by leading the alteration of remembering and forget-ting typical of the lower phase towards the state of continuous visioncharacteristic of the higher phase.44That the cyclic process of soul should be understood textually aswell as metaphysically can be shown on the basis of works like De39See Mus.

The combination of negation and affirmation is some-times understood as simultaneous: for example in Contra Academicoswhere the ancient Academy is said to have held the Platonic doc-trine of forms in secret but to have advocated the skeptical methodof philosophy in public;47and sometimes as successive: for instancein the Confessioneswhere Augustine is declared first to have held theManichaean doctrine of corporealism but subsequently to have replacedit with the Platonic incorporealist viewpoint.48Returning now to the text of De Quantitate Animae, we see thatEvodius is convinced by the force of Augustine’s demonstrations thatincorporeal things exist and that the soul is incorporeal. However,he now accepts his mentor’s invitation to pose further questions.These are: 1. How is it that, as the body grows with age, the soulalso seems to grow?; 2. If the soul is extended spatially through thebody, why does it not have quantity. But if soul is not so extended,how is it affected in sensation throughout the body? Augustine agreesto give an explanation which he has already prepared and whichEvodius’ reason most evaluate. This explanation is the best that hehas been able to discover, unless God shall inspire him with some-thing better as they proceed.49Evodius’ first question is answered briefly by underlining the dis-tinction between “greater” (maius) and “better” (melius) and by showing45DVR37. 68.

As Augustine points out, just as the cir-cle is better than the square because it possesses more equality throughthe absence of angles, so is one soul better than another throughthe agreement between life and reason.51It is important to note thatthis argument does not question the usual ontological priority of theobject of analogy (the soul) and the source of analogy (the geomet-rical figure).52Evodius’ second question is answered at greater length by explor-ing the mechanism of visual perception and by showing that the soulcan experience something even if not located where the experiencetakes place.53Much of the argument involves the evaluation of twopossible definitions of sensation: namely 1. “a bodily experience ofwhich the soul is not unaware,” and 2. “a bodily experience of whichthe soul is not unaware directly.”54Here, once again the questionof equality comes to the fore. In conjunction with some remarksabout the correct methods of definition, Augustine points out thatdefinition 1. fails by containing too much (including something whichis not sensation) while definition 2. fails by containing too little (notincluding something which is sensation).55There is an interesting argument which might be considered as akind of appendix to the solution of Evodius’ second question.56Perhapsnot completely satisfied with Augustine’s explanation of the soul’sexperiencing even if not located where the experience takes place,the student cites the cutting of a centipede into two halves each ofwhich retains its motor function as empirical evidence for the spa-tial rather than non-spatial nature of soul. Although confessing his50DQA16. 27–20. 34.51DQA16. 27.52Augustine’s semiotic theory is based on the principle that the “reality” (res)—that for the sake of which something exists—is superior to the “sign” (signum)—thatwhich exists for the sake of something else.

According to this analogy, when the sound ofthe word Sol(= “Sun”) is divided by separating the letters into thenon-signifying components s+ o+ lor alternatively when the soundof the word Lucifer(= “Morning Star”) is divided by separating theletters into the signifying components luci(“to the light”) and fer(“carry!”), the fact that the conceptualized meaning57retains its integrityas much in the latter as in the former case proves that divisibilityof the bodily component into self-sufficient units does not entail thespatiality of the psychic component.Having provided something of an answer to Evodius’ query,Augustine comments that the lengthy discourse should be broughtto a conclusion and that his student needs training in further disci-plines in order to understand the truth of what has been argued.He adds that in the meantime Evodius should receive from him orrecollect through him “the quantity of the soul not in extent of spaceand time but in force and power” (quanta sit anima non spatio loci actemporis, sed vi ac potentia). The question whether the notion of a num-ber of souls—which Augustine interprets as referring to whether soulis one, one and many, or many—should be connected with thenotion of a quantity of (the) soul is subtly evaded. Instead, the teacherurges Evodius to listen to something profitable which will perhapsbe sufficiently onerosum(“weighty”/“difficult”) to deter one or bothof them from further inquiry into the matter.58The famous discourse concluding De Quantitate Animaein whichAugustine with suitable protestations of humility exhibits his ownpower in speaking of the power of the soul—we might say that heenacts the reversion of the soul by describing the reversion of thesoul—begins with an observation said to be within the reach of every-one that the soul by its very presence unifies the mortal body: itproduces and sustains the body’s unity (in unum...in uno), it dis-tributes the nourishment appropriate to each part of the body in an57The adjective “conceptualized” is important here since Augustine’s argumentdepends upon combining signification and thought (i.e. one must continue to thinkthe meaning of a word while it is divided into phonemic or graphic units).

Moreover, this discursive process corresponds to that processwhere, earlier in the dialogue, Evodius’ questions about the growthof the soul with age and the cutting of the centipede were answered.Augustine now urges Evodius to ascend—note the use of the imper-ative rather than the indicative at this point—to the “second degree”(alter gradus60). This is the first use in the present passage of the termgraduswhich has among its primary meanings that of dynamic tran-sition, the character of that transition as a more temporal “step,” asa more spatial “level,” and as a more indeterminately temporal orspatial “degree” being specified by the context. One could perhapsspeculate whether the absence of the word at the beginning of theonerosumwas for philosophical or rhetorical reasons.What is this second degree? It is where the soul’s more manifestlife is understood (intellegitur): its power of locomotion, its power inthe senses of sight, hearing, taste, and touch to distinguish theirrespective objects and to seek and shun objects suitable and unsuit-able to its nature, its power of sometimes withdrawing from thesenses and of connecting spatially and temporally separated things—specified as “power of habit” (consuetudinis vis)—which is called mem-ory. The degree of soul described here again from the degree of art,will later be termed sense. Augustine’s discussion of this degree ofsoul in general corresponds to the earlier discussion of Evodius’ ques-tions about the extension at the soul through the body as the basisof sensation.Evodius is now urged to ascend to the third degree and to think(cogitare) of memory: a memory which is no longer based on habit-ual impressions but on “things preserved” (retentae res). The latter aresaid to correspond to the contents of linguistic arts like grammarand rhetoric and mathematical arts like music, and to be of innu-merable varieties.61In this paragraph Augustine is clearly in a dou-bling process of describing from the degree of what will later betermed art the degree of art itself. Moreover, this discursive process59DQA33. 70.60DQA33. 71. 61DQA33. 72.114chapter three"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"corresponds to that process where, earlier in the dialogue, Evodius’original question about the quantity of the soul was answered bymeans of a geometrical discussion, and his further questions wereexplored successively by using dialectical, physiological, and gram-matical methods.From the fourth degree onwards there is clearly a change of tonal-ity. Although the point is not made explicitly by Augustine, we seemto have before us an ascent from reduplication of the present dis-course and of the earlier part of the dialogue to reduplication of thepresent discourse alone, and from a discussion of exclusively theo-retical matters to a discussion of simultaneously theoretical and prac-tical issues.62As the teacher explains at the beginning of the section,this is the point at which “goodness begins” (bonitas incipit) and—invoking pointedly the principle of superiority which has been atheme of the entire dialogue—where the soul dares to “rank itselfabove” (se...praeponere) the corporeal universe.The fourth degree which will later be called virtue involves mak-ing the soul pure and having the eye of the soul clear. Augustine’saccount stresses the gradual development of the virtues of temper-ance, fortitude, and justice and the process of overcoming the fearof death.63His reference to having the eye of the soul clear recallsthe first of the three levels of the soul’s ascent described in the ear-lier Soliloquiaby means of the analogy of sight, the second and thirdlevels there being looking (corresponding to the soul’s “reason” (ratio))and vision (corresponding to the soul’s “intellect” (intellectus)) respectively.64The account of the fifth degree, later to be called tranquillity, isrelatively brief. This degree involves not making the soul pure butkeeping it pure—the emphasis now being on the superiority of reten-tion over attainment—and not having the eye of the soul clear butprotecting the clarity of the soul’s eye. Something else of importancehappens here: namely, the soul “grasps its quantity in every respect”(omnifariam concipit quanta sit).65How does this conception of the soul’s62It should be noted that the word “action” (actio) begins to be applied to eachof the degrees. It should also be noted that the explicit imperatives are droppedafter the fourth degree. Presumably Evodius is no longer following a process whichbecomes centered on Augustine’s own performance. See DQA34. 79.63DQA33. 73. This account (and the others to follow) is, of course, from thedegree of art.64Sol.

Clearly in the sense that the earlierconception was that on the part of reason and the later that on thepart of reason in combination with virtue. In any case, this phasewould represent the discursive-conceptual limit of De Quantitate Animae.The account of the sixth degree, later to be called approach, isalso relatively brief. This degree involves directing the eye of thesoul towards its object and is unusually perilous. Here, those whohave not purified themselves in advance—the talk of the fourthdegree—will “rebound from the light of truth” (luce reverberantur veri-tatis) to such an extent that they will think not only that there is nogood there but even that there is much evil. For them the Psalmistprays: “Create a clean heart,” etc.66Augustine now describes his own or perhaps not even his ownascent to the seventh degree. The dynamic transition is from thatintellection of the things that exist supremely which corresponds tothe soul’s supreme looking —this than which nothing is more per-fect—to what should be called “no longer a step but a sort of remain-ing” (neque iam gradus, sed quaedam mansio) whither the previous stepshave led.67The language here exploits subtle ambiguities in thatgradushas shifted semantically from the more static sense of “degree”to the more dynamic sense of “step(ping)” and in that mansiohasthe double sense of “remaining” (verbal) and “a dwelling” (substantive).What is this seventh degree, later to be called contemplation?Strictly speaking, it can only be described after one has descendedfrom it—a further indication of the doubling tendency of the dis-course—as is the case with those greatest souls whom we believe tohave seen it and to see it now. For his part Augustine will simplydeclare that, if we hold to the course ordained by God, we shallcome through God’s power or wisdom to that supreme cause, author,principle or whatever name is suitable to “something so great” (restanta). Having understood this, we shall recognize “how great a dis-tance” (quantum inter) there is between vanity and truth. We shall66DQA33. 75.

There are three very impor-tant final points. First, the degrees of which we have been speakingshould rather be viewed as “actions” (actus). Secondly, to the sequenceof seven actions Augustine assigns 3 ×7 names: given “so great anabundance of measures” (tanta copia modorum), it is possible to divideup and name the same things in innumerable ways. Third, the actionsof which we have been speaking can be enacted “simultaneously”(simul).68Of these three points, the first justifies an interpretation ofthe process laying emphasis upon its practical aspects, and the thirdan interpretation of the process laying emphasis upon its doublingtendency.The text of De Quantitate Animaeitself ends shortly after the endof this discourse. In is final paragraphs, Augustine inserts merely thebriefest remarks by way of answering Evodius’ last three questionsabout the soul. There are some further comments regarding thebeginning of the true religion in the third degree.69However, Augustineclearly felt that on rhetorical and aesthetic grounds at least anydetailed discussion in the style of the first half of the dialogue woulddestroy the climatic effect.In summary, what are the salient points of Augustine’s final discourse?First, there is what the discourse reveals about the axiologicalstructure and the combinatory-axiological structure mentioned ear-68DQA34. 78–35. 79. the names are the following: 1. “animation” (animatio), 2.“sense” (sensus), 3. “art” (ars), 4. “virtue” (virtus), 5. “tranquillity” (tranquillitas), 6.“approach” (ingressio), 7. “contemplation” (contemplatio) or else 1. “of the body” (decorpore), 2. “through the body” (per corpus), 3. “about the body” (circa corpus), 4.“toward itself ” (ad seipsam), 5. “in itself ” (in seipsa), 6. “toward God” (ad deum), 7.“with God (apud deum), or else 1. “beautifully of another” (pulchre de alio), 2. “beau-tifully through another” (pulchre per aliud), 3. “beautifully about another” (pulchre circaaliud), 4. “beautifully toward a beautiful” (pulchre ad pulchrum), 5. “beautifully in abeautiful” (pulchre in pulchro), 6. “beautifully toward Beauty” (pulchre ad pulchritudinem),7. “beautifully with Beauty” (pulchre apud pulchritudinem).69DQA36. 80.margins of augustine117"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"lier. From the axiological viewpoint we find that there is a tran-scendence (dynamic) of sensation by memory from degree 1 to degree2. The movement is relative to the subject. In the transition fromstep 2 to step 3, soul passes from memory formed by habituationto memory containing rational truths. Again, the movement con-cerns the subject. Level 4 represents the transcending of levels 1 to3 where the combination of the theoretical and practical on the partof the subject surpasses the theoretical alone. The transcendenceinvolves addition of certain components. Level 4 also represents thetranscending of levels 1 to 3 where soul grasps its superiority tobody. This movement is relative to the subject. In the transition fromstep 4 to step 5, soul passes from achieving purity to retaining purity.Again the movement concerns the subject. The combination of rea-son and virtue on the part of the subject surpasses reason alone inlevel 5: the transcendence (dynamic) is both with respect to level 3of this discourse and the earlier dialogic argument. Addition of cer-tain components is the factor involved. Degree 6 introduces the max-imum of the existent truths. A transcendence (static) of the object isimplied. There is a transcendence (dynamic) of stepping by remain-ing in level 7 with respect to levels 1 to 6. The movement is on thepart of the subject. Degree 7 introduces the maximum of God asGoodness and Truth. A transcendence (static) of the object is implied.There is also a transcendence (dynamic) of non-simultaneous bysimultaneous actions in level 7 with respect to levels 1 to 6. Themovement is on the part of the subject. Finally, degree 7 introducesthe quantity of the transcendence itself between the invisible and vis-ible worlds. This transcendence is of object and subject and bothstatic and dynamic. The combinatory-axiological structure can beindicated more briefly: In the transcendence (dynamic) of sensationby memory from degree 1 to degree 2, the movement implies nega-tion of the inferior term “temporality” through memory’s retentionof images. Between level 2 and level 3 memory containing reasonssurpasses memory formed by habituation. Here, it is the nature ofthe rational memory’s contents which produces negation of the infe-rior term “temporality” and affirmation of the corresponding supe-rior term. In the transcendence (dynamic) of attainment of purity by retention of purity from degree 4 to degree 5, the movement im-plies negation of the inferior term “temporality” through the fact of retention. Level 7 represents the transcending of levels 1 to 6. Negation of the inferior term “temporality” and affirmation of the118chapter three"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"superior term “atemporality” is implied by the remaining. Level 7also represents the transcending of levels 1 to 6 where negation of theinferior term “temporality” and affirmation of the superior term“atemporality” is implied by the simultaneity of actions. An addi-tional point should be made regarding degrees 7 and 6. Degree 7which introduces the quantity of the transcendence itself betweenthe invisible and visible worlds exploits the mechanism of reversalof perspectives.70This means that the affirmation of the inferior andthe negation of the superior term—vanity and truth respectively—isconverted into negation of the inferior term and affirmation of thesuperior. Clearly the chiastic structure of degree 7—as an affirmativeelement—is intended to correct the reverberative structure of degree6—as a negative element.71Secondly, there is what the discourse reveals through its practicalaspects and doubling tendency. In Augustine’s weighty discourse thepractical aspects72consisted of the statement in degree 7 that thedegrees should be identified with actions—together with the assump-tion from degree 4 onwards that this identification is in effect—andthe redefinition in degree 5 of the soul’s quantity as a combinationof reason and virtue; the doubling tendency73consisted of the descrip-tion of animation in level 1, sensation in level 2, and art in level 3from the viewpoint of art in level 3, the transition from referenceto the earlier dialogue and reference to the present discourse betweenlevels 3 and 4, the description of virtue in level 4, tranquility in level5, and approach in level 6 from the viewpoint of virtue in level 4,and the descent subsequent to contemplation in level 7. In Augustine’sdiscourse the practical aspects and the doubling together explain thepresence of further elements seemingly introduced quite instinctively.These are i.the resort to the imperative form of utterance—obvi-ously allied with the practical—in the instruction to ascend, and ii. the employment of the performative mode of utterance—clearly margins of augustine11970On this idea, which is generally considered to be characteristically Porphyriansee Pierre Hadot, Porphyre et Victorinus(Paris: Études Augustiniennes, 1968), pp.110–11, 116, 119, etc.71Cf. Conf. VII. 17.72In Derrida’s Circonfession the practical is closely associated with the performa-tive and used to deconstruct the Platonic notion of transcendent Truth.

That the contemplator has been articulating the phases of areversion is indicated clearly by the references to ascent and to steps:it is hardly necessary to demonstrate this fact, as we did in con-nection with the dialogue between Augustine and Evodius, by estab-lishing connections between the terminologies used in the two partsof the work. Of the various possibilities already sketched in theabstract, it is again the unidirectional and self-transcending modelof the reversion which seems to be at issue with Augustine.However, things are clearly not quite so simple. In the philoso-phy of Plotinus, the cyclic process of constituting beings occurs intwo main forms: 1. a bi-directional cycle of remaining, procession,and reversion in which the third moment achieves a transcendenceof the initial state (we may call this the bi-directional and self-tran-scending model)—the reversion can be considered separately (andcalled uni-directional and self-transcending) in this model but not inthe next model: 2. a bi-directional cycle of remaining, procession,and reversion in which the third moment achieves a synthesizing ormediating position posterior to the initial state and anterior to a sub-sequent cycle of remaining, procession, and reversion (we may callthis the bi-directional and synthesizing model). Plotinus often com-bines these two models in the context of his wide-ranging philo-sophical discussions although model 1 works more effectively in theepistemological and ethical contexts and model 2 applies more nat-urally to the cosmological sphere.The situation is different with Augustine. In his thought, the cyclic74One should compare (contrast) with this the performative element in Derrida’sCirconfession. Among features of note are (i) the use of initials—for example, G forGeoffrey Bennington (Circum. 5, pp. 26, 30; 6, pp. 31, 33–4, etc.); (ii) word-play—for example, escarrefor coat of arms and bedsores (Circum. 17, pp. 87–8; 18, pp.91–3); (iii) the use of initials and word-play—for example, SA for Saint Augustinand savoir absolu(Circum. 19, p. 98; 20, p. 101, etc.). In addition to these features,the removal of periods from the ends of sentences throughout the text (in order toheighten the ambiguous and differential aspects of their syntax) is particularly note-worthy.120chapter three"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"process of constituting beings occurs in a greater variety of formsand in a manner which resolves some of the inherent tensions inthe Plotinian usage but produces others. The main forms (at leastin writing’s prior to ca. 401 C.E.) are 1. a bi-directional cycle oforiginal state, fall, and return in which the third moment achievesa transcendence of the initial state. This corresponds to the bi-direc-tional and self-transcending model of Plotinus as applied specificallyby the latter to the level of soul. It is employed by Augustine strictlyin the ethical and epistemological contexts; 2. a bi-directional cycleof procession, reversion, and order or—with an increased tendencyto stabilize the cycle into a structure—a bi-directional cycle of unity,equality, and concord in which the third moment achieves a syn-thesizing or mediating position neither posterior to an initial statenor anterior to a subsequent cycle. This model, which correspondsto a bi-lateral and synthesizing model in Neopythagorean arithmeticalthough it also connects more loosely with the logos theory ofPlotinus, can present a viable Trinitarian analogue. It is employedby Augustine mainly in the cosmological context.75The dependence of the Augustinian approach as much uponNeopythagorean arithmetic as upon Neoplatonic metaphysics leadsus back to the account of reversion in the final discourse of DeQuantitative Animaebecause of the enormous importance of numberin that process. In fact, Augustine’s references to the numbering ofthe degrees are so emphatic that we must understand his intentionsin the light of his doctrine stated in De Ordinethat number and rea-son are the twin foundations of all human knowledge, and also inthe light of his thesis argued in De Musicathat there are six levelsof number between the corporeal and the rational.76The suggestion75There are two important points to be noted regarding these Augustinian cyclicprocesses: 1. The two bi-directional cycles are occasionally combined to producean extremely complex situation. See Mus.VI. 17. 56 together with the analysis ofdu Roy, L’intelligence de la Foi, pp. 282–97; 2. In both bi-directional cycles there isa tendency to assign the moment of stability to the third term. See DMII. 6. 8,Mus.VI. 13. 40 together with du Roy’s analysis, pp. 232–3, 236, 291.76See Ord.

The numerical approach finds its reflection (or inversion) in Derrida’sCirconfessionwhere the course of life and/or writing is demarcated with the notionsof series, selector, and number. Series is associated loosely with the sequence ofevents (Cf. Circum.50, p. 266), with an ordering determined teleologically accord-ing to a moment where things turn around (Circum. 57, pp. 300–301)—otherwise,the Christian theological idea of the Logos in the beginning —, with a sequenceoccurring non-teleologically as one writes with no belief in survival (Circum.53, margins of augustine121"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"of some scholars that Varro’s book Hebdomades, a numerological trea-tise on the properties of the number 7 mentioned by Aulus Gellius,was one of the inspirations behind the sevenfold structure seems quitepossible.77Augustine was obviously much impressed by this type ofp. 284), and with a chain of texts connected through the es gibt(Circum. 26, pp.135–6). The third point which relates deconstructively to the second refers to theAugustinian notion of making truth and recalls the Derridean general structure ofiterability. Since the deconstructive series is a combination of the determined andthe arbitrary, the question of principles of selection arises. Citing from his earliernotebooks, Derrida proposes as means for imposing thematic or formal organiza-tion upon material a “selector” e.g. (in La Carte Postaleand Glas) the two columns,GL, the figure 7, or (in the projected Book of Elie) circumcision = the principle ofselection itself. Both approaches are rejected because Derrida wishes to be guidednot by the principle of selection is general (by what is of him, for him, or by him)but by the idiom which lets him write (the very thing, the other) (Circum. 52, pp.276–7). Now Circonfessionapplies number to the series as a principle of selectionquite extensively. There are 59 sections of the text which are called (among otherthings) 59 compulsions (Circum. 24, p. 125), 59 periods, each an Augustinian cogito= an “I am” deconstructed by an “I am dead” (Circum. 25, pp. 127–8), 59 yearsof Derrida’s age (Circum. 39, p. 208), 59 counter-exemplarities of himself (Circum.48, p. 255), 59 prayer-bands (Circum. 49, p. 260), 52 + 7 times of falling in love(Circum. 50, pp. 266–7), 59 conjurations, 7 days after a 52-week year (Circum. 51,pp. 272–3). The number 59 is connected with the number 4 (a key-number indeconstruction) as a determinant within one or more of the sections cf. referencesto the synchronization of 4 times within the same periphrasis (Circum. 21, p. 108)and to 59 4–stroke compulsions (Circum. 25, p. 127). There are 4 aspects of Jewishexegesis: 1. Pshat (literality), 2. R’Emez (allegory), 3. Drash (morality), 4. Sord (cab-balism) (Circum. 21, p. 110), 4 epochs displayed in El Greco’s painting The Burial ofCount Orgazand presumably corresponding to the moments of the Heideggerian esgibtor Ereignis(Circum. 29, pp. 150–51). What is the status of these numbers appliedto the series as a principle of selection? First, the numbers are not ideal numbers—as they are, in the last analysis, for Augustine—but numbers of repetition (cf. therepetition compulsion at Circum. 58, p. 305 + 24, p. 125, 25, p. 127). Secondly,they represent a combination of the arbitrary and the necessary just as languageconstitutes such a combination, a point illustrated by Derrida’s description of thefile-names (= the 59 periphrases) appearing on his computer-screen, of his attempt-ing to sort out the aleatory in a rigorous order, and of the invisible connectionlying behind the floating file-names (Circum. 53, pp. 282–3). As examples of thearbitrary and the necessary in respect of numbers, one may consider how the num-ber 59 represents Derrida’s age (arbitrary), while there are 52 weeks, each of whichcomprises 7 days, in a year (necessary), and yet 52 plus 7 making 59 exceedstheyear (arbitrary and necessary) (Circum. 51, pp. 272–3); or how the number 4 rep-resents the consonants in the word PaRDeS (= the orchard of El-Biar, Algeria)(arbitrary) and the initials of the modes of Jewish exegesis (necessary) (Circum. 21,pp. 108–10)—NB that the arbitrary predominates over the necessary is shown byDerrida’s reference to the sieving of singular events that can dismantle Bennington’stheologic program (Circum. 58, p. 305). Third, the numbers constitute readings ofAugustinian numbers, the day with no evening to which Derrida refers (Circum. 53, pp.281–2) recalling the cycle of 6 days of motion and 1 day of rest in Genesiswhich alle-gorizes the Augustinian reversion of the soul—the primary topic of our present essay.77See du Roy, L’intelligence de la Foi, p. 257.

By saying that it has an enormously complexpolyphonic structure in which, additionally to the doubling elementdiscussed earlier, there are at least three levels of reversion operat-ing simultaneously and with different phase-patterns. On one level,we have the Augustinian version of the uni-directional and self-tran-scending model of reversion. We have already discussed this mostobvious level of the discourse at length in the preceding pages. Ona second level, there reveals itself to deeper analysis a bi-directionalcycle of procession, reversion, and concord in which the third momentachieves a synthesizing or mediating position. A parallel instance ofsuch a cycle can be found in De MusicaI–II where Augustine explainshow the numbers 1 to 4 constitute a procession (progressus, progredi)from unity, the unitary character of each of the four numbers rep-resents a reversion (reditus, reverti) to that unity, and the agreementbetween the mean(s) and the extremes within the sequence 1 to 3produces a concord (concordia).79Using this parallel, we can say thatthe degrees 1 to 4 of the weighty discourse constitute a further cyclesuperimposed on the main system. On a third level, a careful read-ing discloses a bi-directional cycle of unity, equality, and concord inwhich the third term yet again achieves a synthesizing or mediatingposition. A parallel instance of such a structure can be found in DeMusicaVI—here, Augustine explains how every created thing bydesiring unity (unitas), self-identity (suique simile), and order (ordo) reflectsthe unity, equality, and charity within its creator—while an entiresequence of such structures occurs in De Vera Religione.80Using thisattracted to notions of harmonicity (presumably containing numbers as interpretedin our previous note).

REMAINS TO BE THOUGHT4.1Of the AbyssAlthough “Khòra” will eventually be combined with “Sauf le Nom”and “Passions” to form what Derrida terms “a sort of Essay on theNamein three chapters or three steps,”1consideration of the cir-cumstances of its original composition as a separate item may bestserve to orientate us as readers on the borderline between Decon-struction and Neoplatonism. Originally, Derrida had written “Khòra”as a “homage in the form of a question” to be included in thevolume Poikilia. Études offertes à Jean-Pierre Vernant.2Vernant had inseveral publications explored the contrast between the logic of non-contradiction famously exploited by philosophers and a certain logicof ambiguity typical of myth, and this contrast assists Derrida in hisproject of approaching Plato’s Timaeusby displacing the metaphysi-cal interpretation centered on the Demiurge and the Forms with adeconstructive interpretation based on the Receptacle.3In fact,Vernant’s emphasis upon the inversion of oppositions practiced bythe mythologists can be seen retrospectively as providing the basisboth for the replacement of the classical reading of Plato’s dialoguewith a deconstructive reading and for the initial phase of the decon-structive quasi-method itself.To be more precise, Derrida’s strategy in the essay “Khòra” canbe stated in the following simple terms. It is to expound within thecontext of the Platonic Timaeusthe transformation of a khòrawhichis a metaphysical principle simultaneously passive and impassive inrelation to the plurality of Forms into a khòrawhich is a deconstructive1See pp. 169–70, 183. 2Paris: Éditions de l’EHESS, 1987.3In fact, a quotation from the chapter “Raisons du mythe,” in Jean-PierreVernant, Mythe et société en Grèce ancienne(Paris: F. Malpero, 1974) dealing with thistopic is reproduced on the fly-leaves of both the French edition and the Englishtranslation of Derrida’s essay."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"structure simultaneously passive and impassive with respect to aplurality of discourses. In the first phase of Derrida’s reading, khòrabecomes the speaker Socrates who distinguishes himself from philoso-phers and from sophists as a third term, this metonymic shift fromthe khòradistinguished by the speaker Timaeus from intelligible beingand from sensible being as a third term being justified by the occur-rence of the word “kind” in both contexts.4Subsequent phases inthe Derridean reading —which depend on an association betweenthe themes of khòraand of the mise-en-abymewhich we shall discussbelow—proceed in a similar manner. At one point, khòrabecomesa series of seven embedded “fictions:” F1the discourse of the Timaeus,F2the discourse of the Republic, F3 Socrates’ summary of the dis-course of the Republicat the beginning of the Timaeus, F4Critias’story of ancient Athens and Atlantis heard from his grandfather, F5the elder Critias’ hearing of the same story from Solon, F6Solon’shearing of the same story from an Egyptian priest, and F7the storyin ancient Egyptian texts.5At another point, khòrabecomes kinds ofethnic differentiation, kinds of sexual differentiation, and even kindsof kinds.6Derrida’s strategy in the present essay is further to employ khòrain its expanded form as a device for circumventing the usual dichotomybetween muthosand logoswhich has bedeviled traditional readings ofthe Platonic dialogue, the ambivalence in the notion of muthositselfbeing indicated in the course of a detour through a passage fromHegel where both a failure to accede to the “Concept” and an adum-bration of the latter is attributed to myth.7Closely related to this iskhòra’s ability to circumvent the equally rigid dichotomies of originalversus translated concepts,8of literal versus metaphorical terminology—here an important note is appended regarding the assumption ofsuch dualism in the older interpretation of the Platonic khòraitself4“Khòra,” in Jacques Derrida, On the Name, ed.

In fact, khòraultimately rep-resents the processes of translation, metaphorization, and interpretationthemselves.10Although it would be valuable to explore the many convolutionsof Derrida’s interpretation of khòra, we shall confine ourselves hereto making some remarks on the basic nature and function of thisphilosopheme.11It may be most useful to begin with a considerationof khòraas a general structure in a relatively abstract and context-free manner and then proceed to an analysis of the notion as a gen-eral structure in a more concrete and context-sensitive mode. Acertain relation between khòraand negative theology has already beensuggested in the discussion of “Sauf le Nom.”12The following obser-vations regarding khòraas a general structure will further clarify thisrelation.9KH, p. 92. Derrida has apparently been consulting Albert Rivaud, Le Problèmede devenir et la notion de la matière dans la philosophie grecque depuis les origines jusqu’àThéophraste(Paris: Alcan, 1906) and Luc Brisson, Le même et l’autre dans la structureontologique du Timée. Un commentaire systématique du Timée de Platon(Paris: Klincksieck,1974) (KH, p. 146, n. 1).10KH, pp. 94, 99.11We shall not pursue in detail the contrasts between Derrida’s general struc-ture of khòraand the nature of the Receptacle, Matter, and Evil in Neoplatonism.For a preliminary orientation see the passages labelled “Segment A” and “SegmentD” in the chapter “Derrida reads (Neo-) Platonism” (pp. 9–10, 15–16). On theNeoplatonic doctrines themselves—which have involved many controversies—seeKevin Corrigan and Padraig O’Cleirigh, “The Course of Plotinian Scholarship from1971 to 1986,” in Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen WeltII. 36. 2 (Berlin: DeGruyter, 1987), pp. 575–8.

Introduction, texte grec, tra-duction et commentaire (Paris: Vrin, 1993). 12Since the essay “Khòra” first appeared in 1993, several commentaries haveattempted to situate khòra—sometimes with a detour through J.-L. Marion’s position—more precisely with respect to negative theology. See John Caputo, “Khòra. BeingSerious with Plato,” in Deconstruction in a Nutshell. A Conversation with Jacques Derrida,ed. J.D.

It oscillates between two types of oscillation: thedouble exclusion (neither/nor) and the participation (both this and that).19A third passage discusses the oppositions of muthosand logos and ofmetaphorical and proper, and states that khòracannot be identifiedwith the displacement of the negative term by a combined term orby a transcendent term.20Again, the structural name of khòramustbe identified with a non-displacing term in one semantic or ase-mantic category which underlies a displacing term in another seman-tic or asemantic category.With these two polarities, the thought of the khòrawould trouble thevery order of polarity, of polarity in general, whether dialectical ornot. Giving place to oppositions, it would itself not submit to any rever-sal. And this, which is another consequence, would not be because itwould intolerably be itselfbeyond its name but because in carryingbeyond the polarity of sense (metaphorical or proper) it would nolonger belong to the horizon of sense, nor to that of meaning as themeaning of being.21It should be noted that in all three passages, the dependence of thedynamic components within the figure of (semi-) circularity and thepartial figures of transcendence and translation upon the notions of17KH, p. 89/Jacques Derrida, Khòra(Paris: Galilée, 1993), p. 16.18See pp. 125–6.19KH, pp. 90–91/Khòra, pp. 18–19.20See n. 16.21KH, pp. 92–3/Khòra, pp. 22–3.. . . remains to be thought129"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"repetition, of time, and of doubling becomes apparent.22The resultingassociation between khòraand repetition is elaborated elsewhere inDerrida’s essay.

One must reply that, although the text includes some briefreferences to such structures as “Difference,” “Secret,” and “Gift”32—and these are presumably all substitutable with khòra—, it is theabsence rather than the presence of the structures so prevalent inDerrida’s earlier writings that is so striking.33A recent interpretation28On the question of time see n. 24.29See KH, p. 116. At KH, p. 106 a reduplicative idea—of “pre-inscription” (pré-inscription)—is added to the temporal.30See Derrida, FSW, p. 214; and Derrida, OG, pp. 107–8.31On inscription see further below.

Such an interpretation wouldbe consistent with the statements denying as well as asserting the iden-tity between khòraand the mechanisms of double exclusion (neither/nor)and double inclusion (both/and) at the beginning of Derrida’s essay.35Of course, there is no inconsistency for the deconstructionist inattributing both a function in the normal register and a function inthe special category to the general structure of khòra. Such a dou-bleness of function is characteristic of two other general structureswhich have figured extensively in the more recent Derridean texts:namely, “example” and “God.”36Indeed, the essay on khòraitselfdraws one phase of the argument to a close with a telling referenceto what has just been advocated “for example, for the sake of theexample” (par exemple, pour l’exemple) on the subject of khòra.37The interpretation of the general structure of khòraas somethingrelatively abstract and context-free must now be displaced towardsa consideration of the same general structure as a more concreteand context-sensitive element. However, this change of viewpointdoes not imply that the context-free presentation was dispensable.On the contrary, that mode of presentation was required in orderto permit comparison between the general structures of deconstructionand the hypostatic structures of Neoplatonism which are obviouslymore abstract in character. Nor does the change of viewpoint implythat khòrafunctions differently from the other general structures. Infact, the general structures of “Difference,” “Trace,” “Supplement,”and so forth must all be considered both as context-free and ascontext-sensitive elements in the manner proposed here.

On the first reading, she is the substratum forthe imposition of Forms whereas on the second, she becomes thesubstratum for the imprinting of philosophies.Within the discoursive aspect itself of the counter-movement,Derrida’s essay can be understood as elaborating a basic structure ofquasi-signifier and quasi-signified, an expansion of that structureaccording to the quasi-signified, and an expansion of that structureaccording to the quasi-signifier.51The basic structure consists of a substitutive relation through thesignifier—the initial x—between the Greek terms khòra(“place”) andkhaos(“gap/abyss”);52a relation of difference between the Greek word khòraand the French term milieu—a connection through thesignified—; a substitutive relation through the signifier —the hyphen-ation—between the French terms milieu(“middle/environment”) andis inherently a unity prior to a system whereas inscription implies a syntax to whichno unity is prior. See Derrida, OG, pp. 242–3 and VM, p. 115. The question oforigin is also discussed in connection with the general structure of Trace at Derrida,OG, pp. 61–2. Since the Greek word arkhèalso means “rule,” the political ramificationsof the deconstruction of origin emerge in passages like FRGE, p. 265 and Diff., pp.21–2. The ultimate source for Derrida’s elaboration of the theme is clearly Heideggerwho showed both the inherent contradictoriness and the inherent duality of theLeibnizian principium reddendae rationis sufficientis(“the principle of rendering a sufficientreason”) (see Martin Heidegger, The Principle of Reason, trans. R. Lilly (Bloomingtonand Indianapolis: Indiana U.P., 1991)) and furthermore identified the Leibnizian“ground” with an “abyss” as Derrida equates the Platonic khòrawith an abyss.

Morris, inDiacritics13 (1983), pp. 3–20.50KH, pp. 125–6.51These three structures mirror the synthetic (a2a1), affirmative (a1à2), and neg-ative (à1a2) moments respectively of the deconstructive method—something furtherindicating that the fourfold structure is both a semiotic and an asemiotic square.On this point see chapter 2, pp. 42–3 and n. 51.52See KH, pp. 103–4/Khòra, pp. 44–6, Cf.

Here, Derrida quotes further from Martin Heidegger,Was heisst Denken?(Tübingen: Niemeyer, 1954), pp. 174–5.

The figure of(semi-) circularity represented the process where a positive term isfirst displaced by a negative term which is then displaced by a com-bined term, the partial figure of transcendence the process wherethe negative term is displaced by a neutral term and the partialfigure of translation the process where the negative term is displacedby a different realization of the combined term.58The specificationof the terms was different in Neoplatonism and in Deconstruction.In the former case, the term to be displaced is a unitary element55KH, pp. 100–104. In the present essay, Derrida explains the classic sense of“Platonism” in terms of Hegel’s reading in his Lectures on the History of Philosophy.Obviously, he could have explained this classic sense also in terms of Neoplatonism.56See KH, pp. 104, 106ff., 121–4.57KH, pp. 98–9.58Chapter 2, pp. 65–7.. . . remains to be thought137X cancellationX figurexindefiniteness"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"whereas in the latter, the term undergoing displacement is a dual-ity of opposites. In the former case also, the term to be displacedmust form part of a logically-structured conceptual network whereasin the latter, the term undergoing displacement can enter into anycombination of conceptual, semantic, or verbal associations.59Neo-platonism understood the presence of the positive term as the “remain-ing” of a metaphysical principal, the initial displacement by thenegative term as the “procession” of the principle, and the subse-quent displacements by one realization of the combined term, bythe neutral term, and by another realization of the combined termas different “reversions” of the principle.60Another stage in the discussion of “What is Called ‘NegativeTheology?’” was our response to Derrida’s interpretation of nega-tive theology (and simultaneously the discourse about negative theo-logy) as formalization in the three senses of a proposition—for example,of the type “S is P”—, of the antithesis of affirmative and negative—for example, negative theology as a language and as a questioningof language—, and of a set of propositions—for example, arrangedaccording to family resemblance—although more precisely negativetheology (together with the discourse about negative theology) shouldbe understood as the exhaustion of this threefold formalization.61Theinterpretation of negative theology as formalization was shown todepend more precisely on the extent to which polysemy is also anissue. On the one hand, formalization as a polysemous term mayrepresent not only the empty functioning of symbolic language butalso the transcendental aspect of phenomenology. Here, negativetheology should be conceived as occupying a position of mediationor synthesis between two types of formalization.62On the other hand,formalization as representing a monosemous situation may be opposedto the polysemous context associated with the secret or metaphor.Here, negative theology must rather be understood as occupying aposition of mediation or synthesis between formalization and non-formalization.63As remainder, we should now attempt to think further 1.aboutthe figure of (semi-) circularity and the partial figures of transcendence59Chapter 2, pp. 67–8.60Chapter 2, p. 68.61Chapter 2, pp. 56–7.62Chapter 2, pp. 56–7, 60. 63Chapter 2, pp. 56–7.

Given that Proclusenvisages reality as a hierarchy of metaphysical principles each ofwhich is effect of a previous and cause of a subsequent term, remain-ing, procession, and reversion represent three aspects of the relation66See E.R.

Our immediateconcern will be with the juxtaposition of the first and second moments.67Proposition 35 states the fundamental law that every effect remainsin its cause, proceeds from it, and reverts to it. The proof whichfollows is based on excluding as impossible that an effect can remainwithout procession and reversion, proceed without remaining andreversion, or revert without remaining and procession, or that aneffect can remain and proceed but not revert, or proceed and revertbut not remain, or remain and revert but not proceed. Althoughthis section satisfactorily demonstrates the three essential features ofany causal relation, the precise meanings of remaining and proces-sion are not explained. These must be determined by a careful studyof earlier and later passages and of both propositions and proofs.Remaining and procession obviously constitute a dynamic relationsince Proclus speaks of the cyclic activity to which they contributein prop. 33.68In addition, the proof goes on to make references to67The propositions and proofs to be summarized below apply in the abstractsense to any cause-effect duality. However, in order to understand Proclus’ doc-trine fully it is necessary to supplement the general scheme applying to any cause-effect relation with specific details concerning the cause-effect relations between theOne and the First Limit, between an intellect and another intellect, between adivine soul and a human soul, etc. The specific causal relation between the Oneand the immediately subsequent principle is explored in Proclus’ Commentarius inParmenidemVI. 1075. 16–33, VI. 1076. 30–32, VII. 1196. 23–40, VII. 64 (K.-L.)Moerbeke, VII. 68 (K.-L.) Moerbeke, the causal function of the One having beendefinitely stated by both Plato (CParm.VI. 1109. 10–14, VII. 1150. 26–8) and bythe “theologians” (CParm.VI. 1120. 22–6). However, when speaking of the One,the term “cause” must be understood in a restricted manner. Thus, the One is nota cause in the sense of embodying a power and an activity (CParm.VII. 1150.28–30, VII. 1167. 22–3) but is a cause in the sense of producing by its existencealone (CParm. VII. 1167. 36–41). We may also invoke the general principle that,although the One really surpasses the traditional oppositions of superior and infe-rior terms, it can nevertheless be named according to the superior term, and thenapply this general principle to the specific case of the opposition of cause and effect(CParm. VI. 1123. 22–1124. 1). Moreover, the term “cause” when applied to theOne signifies not what the latter is in itself but what it is in relation to subsequentthings (CParm. VI. 1109. 12–14, VII. 1167. 28–32). It is worth noting that in certainpassages Proclus associates the attribution of “causality” to the One epistemologicallywith the extent to which the latter is approachable with the knowledge which impliesthe determination of cause (see CParm. VII. 48 (K.-L.) Moerbeke), and logicallywiththe extent to which it is comprehensible within a system of propositions and inferencestherefrom (see CParm.VII. 72 (K.-L.) Moerbeke). 68The dynamic aspect is here the relation between procession and reversion. Itcontrasts with (but is also a variant of ) that dynamic aspect of procession which isopposed to the static aspect of remaining. Cf. p. 144. An analogous situation obtainswith contrasting aspects of otherness.. . . remains to be thought143"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"movements of various kinds. The nature of this relation is indicatedin other passages by the substitution for remaining and processionsometimes of other opposite terms and sometimes of other oppositeterms and a mediator.The first moment is frequently associated with possession, and thesecond with non-possession i.e. of some property. For example, inprop. 18 causes are said to possess primarily a characteristic whichthey bestow on their effects, in prop. 65 triadic sequences of prin-ciples possess properties occurring in originative, substantial, and par-ticipatory modes, in prop. 97 causes are described as possessingprimarily a characteristic which they transmit to series of termsderived from them, and in prop. 103 triadic sequences of principlespossess combinations of properties which are permutated accordingto certain laws. Three observations should be made here. First,although these propositions refer mainly to the possession of someproperty by a cause, there is always by implication a non-possessionof the said property by its effect.69Otherwise, transmission of propertiesis not possible. Secondly, the possession and non-possession of aproperty are inseparable (in circumvention of the law of contradiction)70according to a principle governing the relation of remaining andprocession stated in prop. 30 (together with the proof ). Thirdly,although the propositions refer the possession of a certain propertyto a cause and the non-possession to its effect, the two momentsoccur likewise within the cause and likewise within the effect. Thisis because of the fluidity with which relations turn into principlesand vice versa.The moments of remaining and procession are normally correlatedwith the static and the dynamic respectively. A clear example of thiscorrelation occurs in a statement of a fundamental Proclean law ofcausality: that every productive cause produces the sequence of itseffects while remaining in itself (prop. 26).7169For the reversal of possession and non-possession see p. 146.70That the law of contradiction should be flouted, in effect, within the overtlylogical system of the Elements of Theologyfollows from the fact that a propositionalstructure is here articulated strictly as the image of a non-propositional structure.See below. For a definitive statement regarding the limits of any deductive systemof theology see the remarks concluding the interpretation of the first hypothesis inPlato’s Parmenidesat Proclus, CParm.VII. 62–76 (K.-L.) Moerbeke.71Rest and motion are negated with respect to the One according to the Procleaninterpretation of the first hypothesis of Plato’s Parmenides(and are presumably affirmedwith respect to principles subsequent to the One according to the corresponding144chapter four"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"It is characteristic of Proclus’ theory and of Neoplatonism in generalthat higher principles or causes transcend lower principles or effects.The actual term ‘transcendent’ occurs less frequently in Proclus’ textsthan in the writings of his later commentators.

Study of the following passages indicates this.i. Superiority.Prop. 7 states that everything productive of anotheris superior to the nature of the produced. The general rule isexemplified in the cases of the primal Good and things participat-ing in the Good (prop. 8), the self-sufficient and the not self-sufficient(prop. 9), the simply Good and the self-sufficient (prop. 10), theunparticipated and the participated and the participated and the par-ticipating (prop. 24), the self-constituted and the not self-constituted(prop. 40), the undivided power and the divided power (prop. 61),and the unified and the multiplied (prop. 62). It should be noted inconnection with superiority and inferiority, that a mediating term isoften implied: namely, continuity. For example, the proof of prop.21 speaks of a continuity linking the entire sequence of metaphysi-cal principles from highest to lowest.72That the first and second moments of the causal process can alsobe correlated with unity and multiplicity closely follows from whathas been stated. Propositions and proofs dealing with these termsare too numerous to cite here. However, one should note prop. 11stating that everything existing proceeds from the first cause, andprop. 21 that every order of principles proceeds from a monad toa coordinate multiplicity, etc.73ii. Separation.Prop. 75 states that everything properly described asa cause is separated from what results from it.

A good example of thisassociation is provided in another statement of a fundamental Procleanlaw of causality: that no productive cause produces its effect unlessthere is both sameness and otherness between cause and effect (prop.35, proof ).75The first moment is often associated with non-possession, and thesecond with possession i.e. of a certain property. For example, inprop. 23 principles which are unparticipated are placed in the orderof reality before principles which are participated,76in prop. 65 thefirst members of triadic sequences possessing properties occurring inoriginative, substantial, and participatory modes lack the determinationof the second members, and in prop. 101 the principles which areunparticipated are identified with the first members of triadic sequences.The doctrines stated here require some comments.77First, thesepropositions explicitly refer to both the non-possession of some propertyby a cause and the possession of the said property by its effect. Onlythus can origination of properties be explained. Secondly, the non-possession and possession of a property are inseparable (in circum-vention of the law of contradiction)78according to the principlegoverning the relation of remaining and procession.79Thirdly, thesepropositions associating non-possession of a property with the causeand possession of the said property with the effect obviously reversethe priorities stated in certain propositions discussed earlier. The ten-sion between these two formulations is an essential feature of thissystem.74Extension of power is elaborated further in props. 27, 56–7, 82, 98.75Sameness and otherness are negated with respect to the One according to theProclean interpretation of the first hypothesis of Plato’s Parmenides(and are pre-sumably affirmed with respect to principles subsequent to the One according to thecorresponding Proclean reading of the second hypothesis), although they must stillapply to the First Principle in some elevated and analogous sense.

We should nowturn to Proclus’ discussion of the partial figures of transcendence andtranslation.Although the general tendency is to view the third member ascomparable with the first and second members of the causal triad,the reversion does exhibit certain features which prevent it frombeing treated exactly in parallel with the remaining and procession.In particular, it enters into the causal process at a point where mul-tiplicity and the concomitants of multiplicity have already been gen-erated. This means that the third member of the triad should beexamined both in the context of what one might term its basic orunitary presentation and also in the context of what we shall call itsdeveloped or unitary-multiple presentation. Moreover, the complex-ity of the second presentation is such that it will be necessary toconsider an expanding and a contracting form of the development.The basic or unitary presentation of reversion (A) consists in thefirst place of a conversion80of the procession. For example, propo-sition 31 states that everything which proceeds from something revertsaccording to its being upon that from which it proceeds. In otherwords, the causal process consists of a motion on the part of aneffect or lower principle away from a cause or higher principle fol-lowed by a motion on the part of the effect or lower principle backtowards the cause or higher principle.

The evidence for this is clearalthough indirect being based on the circumstances that i. remain-ing and procession of an effect are dependent on the sameness andotherness respectively of that effect in relation to its cause, ii. rever-sion of an effect is dependent on the similarity of that effect in rela-tion to its cause, and iii. similarity represents a combination ofsameness and otherness.

See Proclus, CParmVII.1191. 10ff. However, a more important function is assigned to the higher analogueof similarity—the “natural striving” (autophuès ephesis) of things towards the One—than to the higher analogues of rest and sameness.

Thus, prop. 37states that of all terms which are generated by reversion the first areless perfect than the second and the second less perfect than thesubsequent, the last being the most perfect. The reference here tothe generation of effects or lower principles by reversion is initiallypuzzling, since such things are normally said to arise by processionfrom a cause which remains undiminished.85However, the explana-tion is clearly that terms generated by reversion are also terms gen-erated from remaining. This is because when effects or lower principleshave reverted upon the higher, they themselves become causes whichare intermediate between higher and lower and remain, while fur-ther effects or lower principles revert upon them in their turn. Thisontologically generativemodel of reversion (G)—which we have pro-visionally been calling “the partial figure of translation”—might beimagined spatially as a spiral.86That the basic presentation of reversion is threefold: as conver-sion of the procession, as combination of remaining and procession,and as transposition of the remaining is where the much-discussedparallel with Hegel really lies. The Proclean ontological triad andthe Hegelian dialectical triad differ markedly, especially through thedistinction between ideal and real moments peculiar to the latter.However, Hegel’s Aufhebungcancels the previous moments, preservesthe previous moments, and shifts the process to a new register in atriple cycle strongly reminiscent of its Neoplatonic antecedent.The developed or unitary-multiple presentation of reversion87(B)consists in the first place of an expanding scheme (B1). By this ismeant that an effect or lower principle reverts not only upon a priorcause immediately but also upon one or more higher causes medi-ately.

Prop. 38 completes the symmetry of the schemeby stating that everything that proceeds from a multiplicity of causesreverts through as many terms as it proceeds, all reversion beingthrough those very terms through which the procession takes place.Since the effect or lower principle here passes through its own mediatecause to others higher up the sequence, its reversion to the mediatecause must be complete. This ontologically non-generativemodel ofreversion (NG)—which we have provisionally been calling “the partialfigure of transcendence”—might be imagined spatially as a circle.88This presentation of reversion (B) also consists of a contractingscheme (B2). The latter implies that an effect or lower principle notonly reverts upon its cause but also upon itself and occurs in threegroups of propositions. In the first group, principles which revertupon themselves are identified with incorporeal principles (props.15–16) to which should be added a further proposition categorizingthe self-moving as self-reverting (prop. 17). In the second group, prin-ciples which revert upon themselves are identified with self-constitutiveprinciples (props. 42–3) to which should be added a further propositionestablishing the coincidence of self-reversion according to activity andself-reversion according to substance (prop. 44). The third groupconsists of a proposition stating that self-reverting principles89areparticipated by other things without loss of separateness (prop. 82),and a proposition stating that principles self-reverting in respect ofknowledge are also self-reverting in respect of other characteristics(prop. 83).90The two most difficult questions about the theory of reversionunfolded in the propositions of the Elements of Theologyare perhapsthose concerning the more general difference between the basic (A)and developed (B) presentations and the more specific differencebetween the generative (G) and non-generative (N-G) models. Thedifference between the two presentations is frequently reducible forProclus, given that a notion of participatory modes is combined withthe theory of reversion and that the various principles constituting88It should be noted that the non-generative model of reversion is compatiblewith both the unitary and the multiple presentations.89Shown to be incorporeal in props. 15–16.90These other characteristics are vitality and being as specified in prop. 39.150chapter four"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"the order of reality dynamically interpenetrate one another. Thusreversion to the self as cause, reversion through the immediatelyprior term to a higher cause, and reversion to the immediate causemay coalesce in the activity of the transcendent sphere. This meta-physical ambivalence underpins the hermeneutical flexibility employedby the Neoplatonists in their readings of traditional mythology.However, that the more general difference between the basic (A) andthe developed (B) presentations is reducible does not of itself implythat the more specific difference between the generative (G) and non-generative (N-G) models can be similarly treated. In fact, the differencebetween the two models is sometimes irreducible in Proclus, giventhat the theory of reversion is combined with a notion of differentlevels of reality and that these different levels of reality enjoy individualmodes of activity. For example, reversion according to being seemsto imply the generative model exclusively but reversion according tointellect partly the generative and partly the non-generative model.9191Although the doctrine of remaining, procession, and reversion is a relativelystable feature of Proclus’ metaphysical system, there are certain variations in itsapplication at different levels of his system. One such variation—whose epistemo-logical ramifications are considerable—concerns the particular soul. According toProclus, ET, prop. 211, when the particular or human soul descends there is nota part of it which remains above and a part which descends, the remaining func-tion of the soul being apparently discharged by a demonic soul mediating betweendivine and human (see prop. 202, pr.). Obviously, this theory exploits possibledifferences between the basic and developed presentations. According to Proclus,CParm.IV. 948. 12–950. 34, the doctrine further impliesi. that the particular orhuman soul can only know in an immediate sense and without higher assistance –i.e. by the theoretical activity of philosophy—the lowest level of the Forms (con-tained within the Proclean hypostasis of Intellect)—this point is made on the basisof Parmenides’ statement about the unknowability of the Forms at Plato, Parm.134b; ii. that the particular or human soul can know in a mediate sense and withhigher assistance—i.e. by the practical activity of theurgy—the higher levels of Forms(contained within the Proclean hypostases of Being and Life)—this point being madeon the basis of Socrates’ reference to mystic rites, initiations, and visions at Plato,Phaedrus 249d ff.

Thedoctrine of the particular or human soul’s descent together with its epistemologicalconsequences is explicitly directed against Plotinus’ position stated in Enn.IV. 8 [6]8. 1–6, V. 1 [10] 12. 1–21, III. 4 [15] 3. 21–7, VI. 5 [23] 7. 1–8, etc. On thedisagreement between Plotinus and Proclus see E.

Although the choice of such principles of organization bythe original writer reflects a certain generalized dialectical intent,there seems little doubt that Proclus is here attempting more specificallyto apply the Euclidean geometrical method to philosophy. In sodoing, he places himself squarely within the Greek tradition ofreflecting upon the methodological relations between mathematicsand philosophy which is exemplified by Plato’s discussion of the edu-cation of the guardians in the Republic92and Aristotle’s account ofthe organization of the disciplines in the Metaphysics.93However, healso situates himself in a more idiosyncratic position within the Greektradition in two respects. First, he treats mathematics as a disciplinewhose method is not only similar to that of philosophy but can actu-ally be transferred to the latter. This is because of the ontologicalrelation between image and paradigm which underlies the method-ological relation between the two spheres. Secondly, he chooses geom-etry over arithmetic as the mathematical discipline most capable ofadaptation to philosophical ends. This is because of the propositionalmethod which had already been developed uniquely within thisbranch of mathematics.94In fact, Proclus is himself the author of an important extant com-mentary on Euclid’s Elements of Geometryand applies the methodderived from that work in several areas. In the sphere of physics—the discipline which ranks below mathematics in the traditionalAristotelian tripartition of theoretical knowledge—the Neoplatonistapplies geometrical method to the study of mobile and embodiedforms. This application can be seen in the work entitled Elements ofPhysicswhere the general approach is first to set out a series of self-evident premises and then to construct logical demonstrations through92Plato, Rep.VI. 509d–511e. 93Aristotle, MetaphysicsE 1. 1025b 18ff.94The argument developed in this paragraph and the next is broadly in agree-ment with Dominic O’ Meara, Pythagoras Revived.

It isthis application which can be seen in the Elements of Theologywhere,however, the general approach is to construct logical demonstrationsthrough the combination of propositions without prefixing these witha group of self-evident axioms. Plato’s approach is here preferred tothe syllogistic mode of reasoning practiced by Aristotle because itsprocedure corresponds to the hypothetical method used to describethe One in Plato’s Parmenides.96Whatever the situation may be with respect to other metaphysi-cal systems, the notion that one might express theological truths andthereby implicitly obtain access to the divinity through the employ-ment of propositions is problematic for a Neoplatonist like Proclus.Subsequently to the clear teaching of Plotinus, the Neoplatonists heldthat there are at least three distinct levels of reality—the so-calledhypostases of the One (or Good), Being-Intellect, and Soul—and thatamong the distinguishing features of these levels are their differentrelations to propositional structure. In fact, the One (or Good) iswithout propositional structure in the sense of transcending propositional95For the connection between the Euclidean method and the hypothetical methodof the Republicand implicitly also that of the Parmenidessee Proclus, Commentarii inprimum Euclidis Elementorum librum, ed.

It should be noted that Proclus, in adapting the Euclidean method eitherwith or without the preliminary statement of axioms and in associating this proce-dure from different viewpoints with the hypothetical method of Plato’s RepublicandPlato’s Parmenidesrespectively, does not explicitly deal with the figurative elementof geometry. However, that figures as well as propositions are transferable betweenthe realm of geometry and those of physics and theology is indicated by the exten-sive application in both the latter domains of circular shape—for example, the state-ment of the principle whereby the procession of a hypostasis or component of ahypostasis is always followed by a reversion—and of proportional mediation—forinstance, the statement of the principle whereby the procession and reversion of ahypostasis or component of a hypostasis always takes place through mean terms.The projection of the figurative element into the domains of physics and theologyalso contributes to Proclus’ philosophical agenda in making it possible for him toincorporate much traditional Pythagorean doctrine into the reading of Plato.. . . remains to be thought153"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"structure because it lacks all complexity.

However, Soul possesses propositional structure in accord-ance with its function as the center of discursive, reasoning, or dia-noetic activity in the Neoplatonic system.97Given the fundamentalassumption of this metaphysical outlook that propositional structureinvariably combines the senses of entailment—which is logical andatemporal—with inference—which is psychological and temporal—,and the further assumption that knowing is accomplished throughthe uniting of subject and object—with varying degrees of identityon the levels of Being-Intellect and of Soul respectively—, the rangeof epistemological possibilities is as follows:981. Soul (activating propo-sitions) thinks Soul (structured propositionally), 2. Soul (activatingpropositions) thinks Intellect (structured non-propositionally), 3. Soul(activating propositions) thinks the One (not structured), 4. Intellect(active non-propositionally) thinks Intellect (structured non-proposi-tionally), 5. Intellect (active non-propositionally) thinks the One (notstructured).9997In what follows, we shall treat “propositional structure (language)” and “predica-tive structure (language)” as virtual synonyms—there are differences between thesewhich will, however, be unimportant with respect to our particular argument.Technically speaking, a proposition(i.e. a standard-form categorical proposition) 1.consists of a schema: quantifier + subject term + copula + predicate term; 2.iseither true or false; 3.affirms or denies relations between classes. A predicateis a.something affirmed or denied of a subject and therefore b.has a status relative tothat of a proposition. In most ancient philosophy (and especially in Neoplatonism)there is a tendency to psychologize both propositions and predicates.98We shall present this structure roughly as it occurs in the writings of Plotinus.In the post-Plotinian Neoplatonism exemplified by Proclus, the situation is actuallymore complicated in that the hypostasis of Intellect is subdivided into the hypostasesof Being, Life, and Intellect99One of the main purposes of the discussion to follow is, of course, to estab-lish the exact parameters of formalization in Neoplatonism. These in their term willprovide the structural framework within which negative theology might be under-stood. In accordance with the criteria to be outlined, it will be possible to relatethe discoursive complex of negative theology to the Neoplatonic theory of thehypostases in a precise manner. Thus, i. negative (and affirmative) theology couldbe applied to the One by Soul. Its linguistic expression would be “the One is x,”“the One is not-x,” “the One is x and not-x,” the subject-predicate relation andthe law of contradiction being maintained in such discourse; ii. negative (andaffirmative) theology could be applied to the One by Soul undergoing transition toIntellect. Its linguistic expression would be “the One x,” “the One not-x,” “x theOne,” “not-x the One,” “x not-x,” “not-x x,” the subject-predicate relation and thelaw of contradiction no longer being maintained by the discourse. The importantpoint is that the discoursive complex of negative theology turns out to be somewhat154chapter four"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Although the ideas just summarized underlie almost their entirephilosophical doctrine, we find relatively few texts in which theNeoplatonists deal with them directly and overtly.

This determines the truth about the nature of things andthe relations between them, here specified as Being and the Good.102Because we are discussing Soul’s activity as Soul with respect tocognitive objects like Being-Intellect and the Good, it is possible todescribe this activity as consisting of “premises and conclusions” (pro-taseis kai sullogismoi) regarding such objects,103although these are reallypropositions “in the sense of words” (kai gar grammata).104In contrastwith all this, there is a dialectic in the sense of Soul’s thinking activ-ity when undergoing transition into Intellect where Platonic logicalmethod is involved. This inhabits the so-called Meadow of Truth,where it makes division among Being itself, the Forms and Kinds,different in each case. In fact, the difference confirms Jacques Derrida’s intuitionthat negative theology is caught in the oscillation between formalization and thesecret (see Derrida, SLN, p. 80a–c).100There is no comparable discussion in Proclus. However, the latter’s explanationof the unexpected conclusion of the first hypothesis of Plato’s Parmenideswhere aftercompleting the series of negations the text runs: “Is it possible that all this holdstrue of the One?” “I should say not” (Plato, Parm.142a) provides some useful sug-gestions. Although our difficulties of interpretation are here compounded by thefact that we must now rely on a Latin translation which breaks offsuddenly andcontains numerous lacunae, it is possible to discern among the solutions to the apo-ria of this text attributed to Proclus’ teacher Syrianus certain arguments directedtowards the overcoming of propositional form as such. At CParm.VII. 70–74 (K.-L.)Moerbeke the argument seems to include the following points: i.Ultimately noth-ing is true of the One because truth depends upon propositions, any propositionsays that “this” belongs to “that,” and nothing can belong to the One; ii.If weallow the use of propositions and therefore also apply the law of non-contradiction,we can say that contradictory propositions are for the inexpressible both false(although we cannot say that they are both true); iii.In ascending to the One, theSoul no longer practices deliberation—making inquiry about what is and what isnot—and the Intellect no longer intuits what is subsequent to the One.

Here, the Wisdom on the level of Being-Intellect is character-ized by “non-discursiveness” (hèou diexodos), “is neither discursivereasoning nor deliberation” (ou dianoèsis oude bouleusis), does not “stateits truth and the reasons why things are as they are in discourse”(legon auto en diexodòi kai tas aitias, di’has houtò), and subsists “beforeinquiry and reasoning” (pro dzètèseos kai pro logismou).112In EnneadsV. 5 (“That the Intelligibles are not Outside the Intellectand On the Good”) the argument is more epistemological in char-acter. Starting from the premiss that Intellect cannot be in error—from which it is concluded, among other conclusions immediatelydrawn, that it does not perform “demonstration” (apodeixis)—Plotinusconsiders three possible explanations of this infallibility. The firsthypothesis which will be rejected is that Intellect and the intelligi-bles are separate, the second also to be rejected is that Intellect andthe intelligibles are conjoined, and the third which will be acceptedis that Intellect and the intelligibles are not separate.113It is in thecourse of rejecting the second hypothesis and affirming the third thatPlotinus raises questions about the status of discursive reasoning withrespect to Being-Intellect. Thus, the conjoining of Intellect and theintelligibles would imply either that the intelligibles have no intelli-gence or that they have intelligence, and in the former case neitherthe interpretation of these non-intelligent realities on the one handas “premisses, axioms, and expressions” (protaseis...axiòmata...lekta)—for example, where beauty might be predicated of the just—nor theinterpretation of them on the other hand as “simple utterances” (haplaphèsousi)—for example, where one might utter the word for justiceor beauty separately—would make any sense.114The non-separationof Intellect and the intelligibles would however imply that Intellect“has no need of demonstration or belief ” (oud’apodeixeòs dei oude pisteòs).Such self-presence further implies that Intellect knows “what is prior111Enn.

Both texts deal with our approach to the One (or Good).They argue that since predication contains an element of duality,and duality is incompatible with the One, predication is incompat-ible with the latter.The two passages, however, produce a complication. They contrastour approach to the One with our approach to Intellect, arguingthat although predication and duality are incompatible with the One,predication and duality are compatible with Intellect. Ostensibly thisargument would conflict, as regards the relation between Being-Intellect and predication, with the arguments of the passages consideredearlier. However, Plotinus could easily maintain that all predicationimplies duality without also holding that all duality implies predication.Therefore the passages probably contrast our approach to the Onewith our approach to Intellect by arguing that although predicationand duality are incompatible with the One, predication but not dual-ity is incompatible with Intellect. In the case of a philosopher whomaintains as his usual assumptions 1. that the logical structure of aproposition is not distinct from its psychological articulation and 2. that Intellect’s thinking of Intellect is actually (Soul’s thinking of )Intellect’s thinking of Intellect, the expression of this central idea inthe manner chosen is possible and perhaps inevitable.In EnneadsVI. 7 (“How the Multiplicity of the Forms came intoBeing and On the Good”) Plotinus sets out to demonstrate that themultiplicity of Forms is produced and sustained by intellective activity115Enn. V. 5 [32] 2. 13–20.116Enn. V. 5 [32] 2. 20–24.158chapter four"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"and that, since the first principle is absolute unity, this formal mul-tiplicity and intellective activity must be a secondary principle. Theessay concludes with a refutation of Aristotle’s doctrine of the UnmovedMover where, in a brief but important passage, the main argumentthat the Good transcends intellection appears in the form of an argu-ment that the Good transcends the psycho-linguistic expression ofthat intellection.117 This linguistic discussion is based on the analysisof two possible statements about the Good by successfully bracket-ing the three components in each statement. Thus, in the case ofthe complete statement “he is (the) Good,” the expression “he is”(estin) does not apply to the first principle because the latter tran-scends being, while the expression “he is good” (agathos esti) does notapply because it transcends the predicative relation. Regarding theexpression “good” (agathon) Plotinus is circumspect. Possibly this ismore applicable to the first principle, although without the additionof the article (to ➝tagathon)—which presumably introduces an inap-plicable element of thingness—it conveys little meaning.118Plotinusnow shifts from a statement in the third person to a statement inthe first. Here, in the case of the complete statement “I am (the)Good,” the expression “I am” (ego eimi) does not apply to the firstprinciple again because the latter transcends being, while the expres-sion “I am the Good” (agathon eimi) does not apply because it tran-scends the predicative relation. The expression “good” (agathon) againrequires a different treatment. Its application to the first principlegives rise to the difficulty that someone thinking this will either beforced to think the complete expression “I am (the) Good” (ego eimito agathon) or else to think something not present to him as a thinker—leading to various further absurd consequences.119The treatise “The Knowing Hypostases and the Beyond” (EnneadsV. 3) describes the transition between Intellect and the One in chap-ters 10 and 11 and the One itself from chapter 12 onwards.120Whenspeaking of Intellect near the beginning of this section, Plotinus notes117Enn. VI. 7 [38] 38. 1–25.118Enn. VI. 7 [38] 38. 1–10. The interpretation of this difficult passage proposedhere is clearly not the only possible one. However, the main point of importancefor our argument—that the Good transcends the predicative and propositional dis-course associated with Soul’s thinking of Intellect (or alternatively: the predicativeand propositional discourse associated with Intellect’s psycho-linguistic expression)—is not affected by these ambiguities.119Enn.

A few lines further on, he seems to correlatethese two possibilities with two modes of Intellect’s psycho-linguisticexpression. Whenever one says “I am this” (eimi tode), if the “this”asserts something other than the subject it implies falsity whereas ifthe “this” asserts something included in the subject it implies mul-tiplicity.121When turning to the One near the end of this section,Plotinus makes two important points: first, that the One is “notsayable” (arrhèton), because when we speak we must “say something”(ti eipein), while the One is “not something” (oute ti); secondly, thatthe One cannot have said of it “I am that being” (on eimi), becausein speaking thus one says a “multiple” (polu), while the One is “sim-ple” (haploun).122This seems to deny the psycho-linguistic expressionof Intellect’s dualities in relation to the combination of sameness andotherness between the different objects and between its subject andobject respectively which are affirmed in his earlier paragraph.Although the extent to which one may or may not express theo-logical truths in propositional form is understood quite clearly by theNeoplatonists, the fact that relatively few of their texts address thisquestion explicitly has given rise to something of a controversy dur-ing the last twenty years.123It is important that we should brieflyreview and respond to some of the main arguments in play here.121Enn. V. 3 [49] 10. 23–37.122Enn. V. 3 [49] 13. 1–31.123The only substantial text of Proclus parallel to the Plotinian passages sum-marized above is perhaps CParm III. 807. 29–810. 22 where Parmenides is ques-tioning Socrates about the existence of the Forms of Justice, Beauty, and Goodness.Here, Proclus contrasts the One which precedes thought with Intellect which thinksall the Forms together and simultaneously and with Soul which thinks all the Formsseparately and successively. The contrast between the relatively unifying characterof Intellect and the relatively dividing character of Soul is clarified in two furtherways by the present passage: i. The relation between external and internal speechis analogous to that between discursive and intellective thought, and ii.The rela-tion between discursive and intellective thought is expressed mythically as thatbetween the preserved heart and dismembered body of Dionysus. With the argu-ment of this passage one may compare Proclus, CTim.II. 145. 4–146. 1, Commentariain Cratylum, ed. G. Pasquali (Leipzig: Teubner, 1908), 182. 109. 16–21, Hymni, ed.E. Vogt (Wiesbaden, 1957), VII. 11–15. In certain passages, Proclus suggests thatthe ascent above the intuitive level must be achieved by the practical activity oftheurgy rather than by the theoretical activity of philosophy, this also applying per-haps to ascent above the discursive level in general.

This is further specified as involving a. no transitionfrom concept to concept, b. the thinking of everything at once, c.no distinction between subject and object, d. restriction to imma-terial form, and e. independence from sensible imagery. The authornaturally finds this non-discursive thinking exemplified in the Plotiniantexts which we have already discussed and traces its historical originsback to Aristotle. However, the most interesting aspect of his essayis its attempt at a philosophical explanation of this non-discursivity.It is suggested that this mode of thinking means that a concept like“beauty” can exist or occur in independence of any actually-existingproposition like “beauty is truth,” for example where we begin to thinkthe proposition but are interrupted before we can complete it.125This account of what is basically a traditional interpretation ofNeoplatonism was sufficiently able and creative to have stimulated acritical response.126The critic attacks the reading of Plotinus. Mainlyon the basis of EnneadsV. 3. 10, he argues that Plotinus’ account ofthe non-discursive and especially his account of the non-propositionalapplies not to Intellect but to “the higher level of union with theOne.”127The critic also attacks the reading of Aristotle. Using amore extensive selection of texts, he argues that Aristotle’s doctrinecannot be seen as furnishing any precedent for a non-propositional typeof thinking although it admits the possibility of a non-discursivemodeof thought. The earlier essay’s attempt at a philosophical explana-tion of the non-propositional is attacked on two fronts. First, Aristotleat least could not have been envisaging interrupted thinking of thekind proposed given his general assumption that thinking is the mostperfect activity for either man or God—interruptive thinking could124A.C.

Secondly, Aristotle at least could not have beenenvisaging a thinking isolative in the manner suggested given his fur-ther statements that the acquisition of truth is possible with this activ-ity—truth could only arise through combination.128But what preciselyis the non-discursive but propositional thinking which Aristotle andalso Plotinus have in mind? The answer is not very clear. It is saidto consist of “contemplating the definitions of incomposite subjects”and “contemplating these definitions arranged into a unified net-work.” Such thinking is said to be propositional because it tells us“that such-and-such an essence belongs to such-and-such a subject”or “that so-and-so is so-and-so.”129The author of the original essay decided to reply.130His replybegins by explicitly quoting the Plotinian passages which unam-biguously attribute non-propositional thinking to Intellect. Havingmustered the primary sources, it continues by rendering explicit thedistinction upon which his opponent’s thesis implicitly turns—thatbetween transition of temporal moments and transition as logicalcopula—and by showing that the idea of denying both processes toIntellect is a plausible one. In fact, the complexity and dynamismof the hypostasis can be explained in terms of a form of conscious-ness which would havebeen subject to a predicate if realized in dis-cursive thinking, and also in terms of a relation between the intentionaland extensional aspects of logical structure.131This controversy is valuable in bringing into the open certain ques-tions which are usually hidden in discussions of the Neoplatonistsbut on which the coherence or incoherence of their philosophicalprogramme ultimately depends. By way of response to this debate,we should say something about the textual basis, address the specificpoints raised by the critic of the traditional view, and advance somenew proposals.It is perhaps worth reiterating that the text of Plotinus’ Enneadsstates quite clearly that the cognitive activity of Being-Intellect is non-discursive andnon-propositional. In stating this negatively-transcendentaspect of the hypostasis concerned, treatise I. 3 refers to premisses128Sorabji, Time, Creation and the Continuum, p. 140.129Sorabji, Time, Creation and the Continuum, pp. 141, 153.130A.C.

In treatise V. 5 thereis an important reference to suspension of the law of contradictionwith respect to Intellect. Treatise VI. 7 and treatise V. 3 furnishexamples of verbal utterances which are then analyzed. In all thesecases, it is clear that propositions are involved. Even if one arguedthat the discussion in treatise I. 3 referred not to Intellect but toSoul only, or that the discussion in treatise VI. 7 and treatise V. 3referred not to Intellect but to the One alone, the application of thestatements in treatise V. 8 and in treatise V. 5 to Intellect is beyonddispute.132Turning to the specific arguments raised by the critic of the tra-ditional interpretation, we should note that a reading of treatise VI.7 and of treatise V. 3 in which propositional structure is understoodto be denied of the One but affirmed of Intellect cannot be justified.Such a reading is superficial in failing to take into account Plotinus’clear teachings that one approaches the first principle throughIntellect—albeit through a higher phase of Intellect—and that propo-sitions are psycho-linguistic expressions of Intellect—not the latter’sintellectual contents.133Therefore, denial of propositional structurewith respect to the One does not necessarily mean affirmation ofpropositional structure with respect to Intellect. The critic of the tra-ditional view relies for much of his argument upon a distinctionbetween transition of temporality and transition as copula.134Whateverthe merits of such a distinction may be in the abstract, all the evi-dence shows that for Plotinus there is no separation between thelogical and temporal structure of a proposition and consequently alsono separation between the structures of a proposition and of an infer-ence. This situation results from the psycho-linguistic character ofthe fully-realized proposition in Plotinus’ thought. The critic of thetraditional view also hopes to replace the complex of non-propositionalelements in the case of Intellect with a system of universal proposi-tions.135Again the proposal is not without value in the philosophical132In our view, Lloyd, “Non-propositional Thought and Plotinus,” p. 260, n. 5who takes such a restrictive view of EnneadsI. 3 [20] 4–5 has missed a crucialinterpretative opportunity.133On the first point see Enn.VI. 7 [38] 34.1–36. 27—this passage immediatelyprecedes the one quoted in connection with the utterance of propositions—on thesecond see Enn.IV. 3 [27] 18. 1–25.134This is perhaps clearer in Lloyd’s summary of Sorabji (see Lloyd, “Non-propo-sitional Thought in Plotinus,” pp. 258–9) than in Sorabji himself.135See n. 133.. . . remains to be thought163"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"sense, although there is little evidence that Plotinus held a doctrinewhich seems to have more affinities with the Wittgensteinian theoryof “elementary propositions” or Russell’s idea of “atomic proposi-tions” formulated in the early twentieth century.But the question remains: what is the cognitive activity of Being-Intellect really like? The answer perhaps lies in the suggestion oftreatise I. 3 concerning those truths which the many call “proposi-tions” and which are really motions of the soul, for Plotinus is clearlyestablishing in principle that propositions are lower manifestations ofsomething higher in the order of being. This something higher isnot the temporal interruption of a proposition’s enunciation nor isit captured by the relation between intention and extension. Rather,we would suggest that it is something ultimately inexpressible whichcan however be provisionally indicated by an analogy: namely, justas a metaphor is an elliptical version of a simile, so is this some-thing an elliptical version of a proposition.136Plotinus could not him-self have clearly articulated such a conception because the status ofboth an elliptical simile and an elliptical proposition is discoursiverather than conceptual, while the Neoplatonism which he representsis committed to the priority of the theoretical over practical, theontological over the conceptual, and the pre-linguistic over the lin-guistic. Nevertheless, there are unmistakable signs that he is beginningto move in this direction.137Having established that the expression of theological truths bymeans of propositions plays for the Neoplatonists an important yetcircumscribed role in obtaining access to the divine, we may returnto Proclus’ Elements of Theologyin order to determine precisely howthe quasi-geometrical organization unfolds in the course of that work.Although there are undoubtedly various ways in which this exten-sive collection of statements and arguments could be interpreted and136A professional logician would perhaps object here on the grounds that ournotion of an “elliptical proposition” makes no sense within the strictly logical sphere.He is of course correct. However, we are discussing the situation of natural language—an altogether superior phenomenon—where declarative, imperative, and expressivefunctions overlap.137See particularly Enn. V. 8 [31] 6.1–13 where the analogy of hieroglyphic writ-ing is introduced. To a large extent, the force of this analogy depends upon andassociation between non-discursivity and metaphoricity via the pictorial. There aresome interesting suggestions about metaphorical language and the hypostasis ofIntellect in Sara Rappe, Reading Neoplatonism.

What is the first principle from which the other argumentsderive?; 2. What is the structure of the text as a whole?;3. Whatfurther principles are introduced into the argument as it develops?;and 4. What is the structure of each segment of the text?138It would be reasonable to assume that the first principle fromwhich the other arguments derive is proposition 1: “every multi-plicity in some way participates in unity.” However, this statementintroduces the opposite terms unity and multiplicity together withthe relatively complicated notion of participation, whereas a littlelater the opposed terms unity and multiplicity occur in combinationwith the more simple notion of otherness. Consequently, it might bebetter to hold that the first principle from which the other argu-ments derive is prop. 4: “All that is unified is other than the Oneitself.” Either way, the first group of six propositions as a wholeclearly recalls the first hypothesis of Plato’s Parmenideswhich Proclussees as the foundation of all theology: “If it is (there is a) one, theone will not be many.”139The structure of the text as a whole seems to be tripartite in thatprops. 1–6 deal with the One, props. 7–112 with various aspects ofthe relation between the One and other hypostases, and props. 113ff. with the other hypostases—henads, intellects, souls, etc.—themselves.Within this sequence, each proposition is ostensibly derived eitherfrom one or more previous propositions or from another proposi-tion or propositions assumed to be self-evident. An element of cir-cularity is present in the text given that the first group of propositionscorresponds to the remaining of the One and the second and thirdgroups of propositions to two realizations of the processive-revertivemotion of the One. A further element of circularity arises in the cir-cumstance that the foundational and subsequent propositions maybe hypothetical when initially stated but become unhypothetical asa result of late arguments.140138Proclus does not himself raise these questions.139For the notion that prop. 4 is the foundation of the work (and for the con-nection with Plato’s Parmenides) see D.J. O’Meara, Pythagoras Revived, pp. 201–3.140Many important references to this question can be found in the medievalcommentary of Berthold of Moosburg —see Berthold of Moosburg, Expositio super Elementa-tionem Theologicam Procli: Prologus, Propositiones 1–13, eds.

The proofs are designed most often torecommend the proposition by venturing the denial of that propo-sition in stating the contradictory of the proposition or one or moredifferent related propositions and then showing the impossible con-sequences of such a denial. We might call this the dual or hypo-thetical mode of proof. The proofs are sometimes designed torecommend the proposition by constructing syllogisms in which themajor and minor premisses are furnished by propositions stated else-where in the text and the conclusion represents the propositionsof Dodds—see E.R. Dodds, Proclus,The Elements of Theology(Oxford: Clarendon Press,1963). J.M.P. Lowry, The Logical Principles of Proclus’ Stoicheiòsis Theologikèas SystematicGround of the Cosmos(Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1980) is a study devoted entirely to suchgeneral structural problems. However, although this work reveals numerous insightsinto detail, the general premiss on which it is based—that Proclus’ Elements of Theologyrepresents a final systematic resolution of all the unsystematic doctrines of earlierNeoplatonists (Lowry pp. 9–26)—misunderstands the historical background andProclus’ own programme. In fact, the relation between “unsystematic” and “sys-tematic” modes of thinking depends upon levels of being and levels of discourseand not upon chronological developments in doctrine. 141Lowry raises some good points here. He is quite right in saying i. that thenotion of the impossibility of infinite regress is the most basic principle of the Elements(Lowry The Logical Principles, pp. 45–6)—the point is important not only because itrepresents a crucial aspect of Proclus’ reading of Plato’s Parmenidesbut also because itconstitutes the ineradicable distinction between Neoplatonism and Deconstruction—;ii. that the more “Platonic” principles are introduced earlier than are the more“Aristotelian” into the text (Lowry, The Logical Principles, p. 64).166chapter four"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"currently being examined. This might be termed the triple or syllo-gistic mode of proof.142Beyond FormalismThe position which we have now reached in the argument mightbe summarized as follows. In the discussion of “What is Called‘Negative Theology’” one stage was the establishment of the figureof (semi-) circularity and the partial figures of transcendence andtranslation as analytic principles applicable to Neoplatonism andDeconstruction alike, another stage the interpretation of negative the-ology (and simultaneously the discourse about negative theology) asformalization in the possible senses of a proposition, of the antithe-sis of affirmative and negative, and of a set of propositions. In the“Remainder” with respect to that discussion the purpose of the firstsection was to analyze in the context of Neoplatonism the ontolog-ical structure of remaining, procession, and reversion. The note-worthy features of this structure were its formalized and propositionalexpressions and—given that formalization through propositions couldbe included within the activity of reversion—its inescapably doublingnature. The purpose of the second section was to examine in thecontext of Neoplatonism the formalized and propositional expressionof reality as such, a discussion in which it was noted that of thethree levels of reality the One (or Good) is without propositionalstructure in the sense of transcending propositional structure becauseit lacks all complexity, Being-Intellect is without propositional structurein the sense of transcending propositional structure because, althoughit exhibits complexity, the latter is not predicative, but Soul possessespropositional structure in accordance with its function as the centerof discursive, reasoning, or dianoetic activity in the Neoplatonic sys-tem. Several possible tasks now remain. First, we could attempt tounderstand how the formalized and propositional expression of remain-ing, procession, and reversion together with the necessarily doublingnature of the third moment can be viewed as an activity of Soul142In a sense, both these methods are Aristotelian. Regarding the first see Aristotle,Metaph. G3, 1005a18–1009a5 where it is argued that the law of contradiction isthe most important of all the “axioms” (axiòmata) which philosophy must study.Then comes the relevant point.

Secondly, we could pass to the consideration of how the for-malized and propositional expression of remaining, procession, andreversion together with the necessarily doubling nature of the thirdmoment can be viewed as an activity of Intellect thinking Intellect,and of Intellect thinking the One, this formalized and propositionalexpression being rather what surpasses the formalized and proposi-tional expression. In actual fact, the first project would yield resultswhich are too obvious.143We shall therefore turn our attention imme-diately to the second.If the reader is willing to recall our discussion of the controversyabout the non-propositional thought attributed to the hypostasis ofIntellect by Plotinus, s/he will understand what follows as a sequenceof linguistic prescriptions corresponding not to the temporal inter-ruption of a proposition’s enunciation but to certain formulae whichhave a relation to propositions analogous with the relation to simi-les which metaphors have.144For the ancient Neoplatonists them-selves this ellipticalrelation constitutes a psycho-linguistic expressionof Intellect’s thinking of Intellect and Intellect’s thinking of the One.It therefore remains an ontological matter. For a modern reader ofNeoplatonism this elliptical relation represents a deconstructive inter-pretation of Intellect’s thinking of Intellect and Intellect’s thinking of the One. The ontological aspect is therefore “under erasure.”145The implications of the contrast between the ancient and modernapproaches are considerable, since within the context of the estab-lishment of ontology the elliptical proposition disrupts logico-syntac-tic connectors with respect to an atemporalsphere, producing themetaphysical idea of the “all-together,”146whereas within the con-text of the deconstruction of ontology the same elliptical propositiondisrupts logico-syntactic connectors with respect to the temporal domain,producing the non-metaphysical notion of parataxis-juxtaposition.147The precise trajectory of our proposed discussion of the ellipticalproposition—and especially concerning the relation to non-proposi-tional and non-predicative language in general which it implies—is143Part of this task was also accomplished (implicitly) in chapter 3.144For the elliptical formulae see pp. 163–4 and nn. 135–6. 145For the psycholinguistic aspect see p. 154 and n. 98, p. 160.146See Plotinus, Enn.

We shall therefore begin by examining certain passagesin which a theory of calling is associated with a practice of textualjuxtaposition albeit in an unexplained manner. Regarding the formercomponent, we should note that the complex of linguistic usages sur-rounding “calling” crosses the boundaries of the imperative, perfor-mative (in the Austinian sense), and declarative spheres. Given thata standard-form categorical proposition has as its schema: a quantifier+ a subject term + a copula + a predicate term,149then “calling”—of which the primary meanings are imperative (“Come! . . .”), per-formative (“I name this ship . . .”), and declarative (“my friend iscalled . . .”)—is as much a non-predicative as a predicative utterance.150In a manner which seems premeditated, Derrida has associated anon-predicative sense of calling —this meaning being indicated bythe proximity of demanding (= imperative) and promising (= per-formative) in the text151—with a paratactic combination of texts. Thewriter’s intention is revealed by a careful reading of the Prière d’in-sérer(“Please insert”) and the Avertissement(“Notice”): short items addedto the separate French editions of the three essays studied in the148The statement is true with respect to philosophical rather than poetic mate-rials.

Thus, the question of the name resounds throughout “Passions,” “Sauf leNom,” and “Khòra” but hesitates on the edge of the call.156The non-predicative sense of calling is also a prominent featureof an important essay in which Heidegger attempts to explore thenature of language by means of Trakl’s poem “Der Winterabend.”157According to this reading, it is language itself rather than the poet152Derrida, ON, pp. xiv–xvi It is important to note the opposition of conjunc-tion and disjunction constituting the parataxis here.153ON, p. xvi.

For example, regarding the giving of names in general Derridanotes that the one who gives a name does not possess what is given, and that theone who receives a supplemental name may not have possessed an original name;and concerning the giving of specific names he argues that among names giventhe supplemental name is the most important, and that any given name can betransformed by anonymity, metonymy, cryptonymy, and the like.

Henotes that Dif-ference prevails in the relation, that it is not a genericconcept but something unique, that it is not a mediator added totwo terms already existing, that it is not an abstracted concept butsomething disclosing, that it is not a distinction or relation in thecategorial sense, but especially that Dif-ference is dynamic.159In attempting to think with Heidegger and perhaps also theunthought of Heidegger concerning the non-predicative calling, weshould combine the brief explanation in the essay “Language”—158We are here paraphrasing the summary in Heidegger’s commentary follow-ing his presentation of the third stanza (Lang., pp. 206–7), adding certain detailsfrom the earlier and more general discussion of all three stanzas (Lang., pp. 200–5).159These notes are based on the remarks in Heidegger’s commentary followinghis presentation of the second stanza (Lang., pp. 202–3). It seems clear that whenHeidegger envisages language as uttering the command “come!,” the situation isdifferent from that which obtains when the Bible depicts God as saying “Let therebe light.” In the former case, there is actually no subject and the imperative whichis foundational cannot be re-written into a predicative form as “Language says:‘come!’”. . .

Here, somethingdescribed simply as what is to be thought calls not the successiveimages of a poem but the philosophemes of Graeco-German cul-ture. In the context of Heidegger’s specific reading of the history ofphilosophy, what is to be thought is a differential structure depend-ing on the impersonal and non-predicative verb khrè. Moreover, thisdifferential structure can be associated with three phases of utter-ance: first, where the Being of what is—treated on the basis of theverbal and substantival components of the archaic participle eonasa duality-in-unity of transcending and transcended term in which thedivision of the terms precedes any transition between them and isnot rendered dynamic in questioning —calls legeinand noeinto itself;secondly, where the differential structure develops the relation betweenlegeinand noeinby semantically expanding their meanings from “say-ing” and “thinking” to “letting-lie-before-us” and “taking-to-heart”;and thirdly, where the Being of what is—treated on the basis of theverbal and substantival elements in the Greek participle eonnow asa duality-in-unity of transcending and transcended terms in whichthe division of the terms does not precede the transition betweenthem and is rendered dynamic by questioning —calls legeinand noeinto itself in their developed form.161This singular reading of the history of western thought is not yetcomplete, since Heidegger can be understood as now expanding thetextual basis from the one-line fragment of Parmenides which providesthe key-terms khrè, eon, legein, and noeinto the Greek textual tradition160For the abyssal relation between poesy and thinking see Martin Heidegger,WCTII. 2–3, p. 134.161WCT I. 9, pp. 88–97, II. 10, pp. 216–26, II. 10–11, pp. 226–8.

An interpre-tation of the differential structure subsequent to the first phase ofutterance indicates the point where Plato treats the Being of whatis as the world of Forms and the division or transition between tran-scending and transcended terms as “separation” (khòrismos).162Aninterpretation of the differential structure prior to the third phase ofutterance indicates the point where Nietzsche treats the Being ofwhat is as the Will to Power and the division or transition betweentranscending and transcended terms as the “over-man” (Übermensch).163It is important to note that the reading of the difference betweenBeing and beings where this relation becomes dynamic as non-pred-icative questioning is something which occurs neither in Plato nor inNietzsche but only in that thinking to which we are being called.Many of Heidegger’s usual ideas about the history of philosophyare incorporated into the interpretation of the three phases of utter-ance. The contrast between everything that has been thought beforethe last phase and what we should attempt to think in the last phaseis revealed in a contrast between the association of Being and whatis with Presence and what is present where the relation betweenBeing and Time implied in this association has not become ques-tionable and the association of Being and what is with Presence andwhat is present where the relation between Being and Time impliedin that association has become questionable.164With regard to thespecifically Greek contribution to what has been thought before thefinal phase, we are reminded of the “Difference” (Unterschied) betweenconcealed and unconcealed implied in that between Presence andthe present, of the rising of the present from unconcealment to uncon-cealment—a movement indicated by the prefixes para-(implying com-ing) and apo-(implying going) attached to the verb einai(“to be”)—andthe interpretation of the rising of the present as shining.165The structures of calling exploited in Heidegger’s accounts of poesyand thinking are important for providing us not only with a modelof non-predicative discourse but also with a model of non-linear162WCT I. 9, pp. 88–97, II. 10, pp. 216–26.163WCT I. 7, pp. 74–5, I. 8–9, pp. 85–7, I. 9, pp. 88–97.164WCT I. 10, pp. 100–110.165WCT II. 11, pp. 229–44.. . . remains to be thought173"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"spacing commensurate with that discourse. Our most instructivepassage occurs in What is Called Thinking?where Parmenides’ responseto the call of what is to be thought with the words khrèto legein tenoein t’eon emmenaibegins to be discussed in earnest, given thatHeidegger proposes to write this statement by dividing it into fourunits separated by colons and by placing each unit on a separateline, the resulting provisional translation “Needful: the saying alsothinking too: being: to be” exhibiting the paratactic character of theutterance.166Khrè:to legein te noein t’:eon:emmenai:In introducing here the embarrassingly technical term “parataxis,”he argues that Parmenides’ statement should be understood not asthough speaking through words which follow one another in a specificsequence and subordinative relation but as though speaking wherethere are no words or in the field between the words. Heidegger’sexplanation at this point is rather subtle since, by combining thenegation of predicative discourse implicit in sequence and subordi-nation with the affirmation of non-linear spacing implicit in the divi-sion of words, he clearly shows the fundamental analogy betweendiscourse and spacing which concerns us, although he is somewhatreticent about the import of this analogy and the nature of the spac-ing involved.167166WCT II. 7, pp. 182–6.167It is noticeable that Heidegger applies the mechanism of the (a) semiotic squareto the interpretation of the relation between legein and noeinat WCT.II. 11, p. 241.This suggests a possible application of the figure to the entire Parmenidean frag-ment, an application which would be polysemous in accordance with varyingemphases of the constituent terms. Obvious applications would be i. khrèto the neu-tral term à1, à2, eon and emmenaito the combined term a1, a2, legeinto the positiveterm a1, à2, and noeinto the negative term à1, a2; ii.(with khrèassigned to the entiresquare) eonand emmenaito the neutral term, and legeinand noeinto the positive,combined, and negative terms. The graphic expression of Parmenides’ fragment wasobviously important to Heidegger since he a. (explicitly) distributed the fragmentinto four spatial units, b. (implicitly) understood the initial of khrè—the Greek letterkhi(x)—as the figure X. Further connections are possible with the Christian notionof Logos—the Greek letters khi(x) and rhò(r) begin both khrèand Khristos—and theDerridean interpretation of Plato’s Khòra.

Heidegger would have recognized this as aremnant of what he calls the Ge-stell (“Enframing”). The reader shouldnext imagine the isolation of certain semantic areas through the dis-ruption of the predicative and inferential connections: a processleading to the liberation of polysemy and connotations, the semioticnow gaining ascendancy over the logical. Heidegger would have seenthis as an anticipation of what he calls the Er-eignis (“Event/Appro-priation”). The crucial transition from the first model to the secondmay be traced by examining his analysis of the principles of identityand of sufficient reason, and the nature of the second model by con-sidering his discussion of the es gibtformula.168Among Heidegger’s other works the essay “Building, Dwelling, Thinking,” inPLT, pp. 145–61 provides a rather full account of the general phenomenon whichwe have called “spacing.” This account deals with three interlinked questions: therelation of man to the fourfold, the notions of location, space, and site, and therelation of man to location. i. Man’s relation to the fourfold is defined by two termswhich coincide: building and dwelling. In building (bauen), man produces things aslocations, making spaces and a site, and thereby bringing the fourfold into things(BDT, pp. 149, 153–5), and in dwelling (wohnen) he stays with things, preserving therelation between himself and space, and preserving the essence of the fourfold (BDT,pp. 145–6, 152); ii. The interpretation of the notions of location, space, and site isof some complexity. In the first place, there is a question of the triple relationbetween these terms themselves since location (Ort) is a thing which can make spacefor a site, site (Stätte) a space correlative to the activities of building and dwelling,and space (Raum) that which is gathered by virtue of a location. (That Heidegger ishere dealing with what we shall term a semantic notion of space emerges from hisobservation that things are locations which provide a site for the fourfold—whose char-acter is essentially semantic (BDT, pp. 149–51)). In the second place, there is a questionof the degrees of abstraction which occur in shifting thought from aspace (i.e. particularspace) where earth, heaven, divinities, and mortals are admitted, to a set of positionswith measurable distance between them, to a set of dimensions abstractable as height,breadth, and depth, to space(i.e. universal space) in the sense of analytic-algebraic rela-tions. (That Heidegger is again dealing with a semantic space in our sense of the termis shown by his comment that the space of mathematical relations cannot be theground of a space containing the fourfold (BDT, pp. 149–51)); iii. Man’s relation tolocation is also defined by the coincidence of building and dwelling. If space is con-sidered in the manner suggested, it is not something opposite to man either in thesense of an external object or in that of an inner experience. On the contrary, mor-tals areto the extent that they persist through spaces by virtue of their stay amongthings as locations (BDT, pp. 151–2). This is the true meaning of dwelling for Heidegger. . . . remains to be thought175"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"In the lecture entitled “Der Satz der Identität” which was laterpublished as the first part of Identität und Differenz,169Heidegger beginsby examining the philosophical implications of the formula “A = A”traditionally used to express the principle of identity. Having quicklyconcluded that the formula only manages to express equality: thatevery Ais itself the same, Heidegger replaces it with the statement“A is A” which further signifies identity: that every Ais the sameas itself.170Two further interpretations of the principle of identitywill be proposed in the course of the lecture: the first, which wereach by listening to it harmonically as “A isA,” amounts to thestatement that “to every being as such belongs identity;”171the secondis where we pass from a principle as a statement to a principle asa “leap” and from thinking Being as ground of beings to thinkingthe Abyss.172Heidegger’s discussion of a tautology in this text hasrevealed some important aspects of his semantic space. In particular,it has focused on a type of statement from which the possibility ofinference is reduced and also, via the notions of leap and abyss,introduced a kind of utterance which is non-predicative in character,The argument of Heidegger’s Der Satz vom Grundfollows the pat-tern of the lecture on the principle of identity in beginning with aproposition, re-reading and re-phrasing the proposition in variousways, and ending by converting the proposition into a non-propositionalform—although the scale is vastly expanded.173Initially, the “principleof reason” is stated in propositional form: “Nothing is withoutreason/ground.”174The main development in the text then consistsof five readings corresponding to historical phases in the withdrawalof Being: 1. based on the wording nihil est sine ratione, the incubationperiod before Leibniz; 2. formulation of the complete principium red-dendae rationis sufficientisby Leibniz—at this point the notion of logicalproof comes to the fore; 3. the period of historical dominance ofthe principle; 4–5 (these phases are both a unity and a duality pre-sumably because Heidegger is himself calling the principle of reason169Martin Heidegger, “The Principle of Identity,” in Identity and Difference, trans.J.

He answersthat when we resort to this linguistic form, we are not affirming alogical predicate of its subject but attempting to think the “it” interms of the giving which belongs to it, and that the use of this lin-guistic form ultimately points towards the “Appropriation” of whichone can only say “Appropriation appropriates.”179Heidegger’s dis-cussion of the es gibtin this text has again documented importantaspects of his semantic space. In particular, it has introduced twotypes of non-predicative utterance: thees gibtphrase in which thesubject vanishes into the predicate and the iterative verbal form inwhich the predicate vanishes into the subject.180175These five stages are summarized at PR, 7, pp. 50–58.176PR, 7, pp. 51–2. It is important to note the graphic expression of the non-propositional utterance representing the final form of the principle. In particular,Heidegger’s employment of cola here should be compared with his similar strategywith respect to Parmenides’ fragment. See pp. 173–4.177Martin Heidegger, On Time and Being, trans. J.

These linguistic prescriptions will be roughlyanalogous with those which the Neoplatonists advance when dis-cussing the hypostasis of the One or Good.181But before examiningthese later developments, we should remind ourselves of the morespecific goal established at the beginning of this segment which hasbrought us in due course to a discussion of Heidegger’s thought.182That was: consideration of how in Neoplatonism certain ellipticalpropositions about remaining, procession, and reversion could beunderstood as psycho-linguistic expressions of Intellect thinking Intellector Intellect thinking the One. We had argued that the Neoplatonistsi. that of achieving independence of the phenomena from external logical connec-tions, ii. that of abolishing the subject in the predicate and vice versa, and iii. thatof making the unity of the phenomenon visible in the linguistic form. Since Heidegger’sintention is to subvert the standard logical structures, the famous attack launchedagainst the “Nothing nothings” (“What is Metaphysics?,” trans. D.F. Krell, in Pathm.,pp. 90–91) by Carnap on grounds of its illogicality somewhat misses the point. Seehis “The Elimination of Metaphysics through Logical Analysis of Language,” inLogical Positivism, ed. A.J. Ayer (Glencoe: Free Press, 1959), pp. 60–81. 181We have by this point completed our statement of the analogy between thedisruption of logico-syntactic connectors with respect to the atemporal sphere by theelliptical proposition (and non-predicative language in general)—producing the meta-physical idea of the “all-together” in the hypostasis of Intellect—and the disruptionof logico-syntactic connectors with respect to the temporal sphere by the elliptical pro-position (and non-predicative language in general)—producing the non-metaphysicalnotion of parataxis-juxtaposition in the text of philosophy. How does this analysisstand when we shift from Intellect to the One? This question is too complicated toanswer adequately here. We shall simply note i.that parataxis is macrocosmic aswell as microcosmic in extent, ii. that its precise analysis will depend on the individualcase, and iii. that parataxis can be of a more logical or of a more syntactic nature.182It is worth noting that the interpretation proposed above—where Heidegger’slinguistic prescriptions are correlated with those of the Neoplatonists in relation tothe hypostasis of Intellect—differs from the interpretation of other modern scholars—where Heidegger’s linguistic prescriptions are correlated with those of the Neoplatonistsin relation to the hypostasis of the One. Good examples of the latter approach are:Reiner Schürmann, “L’hénologie comme dépassement de la métaphysique,” in LesÉtudes Philosophiques(1982), pp. 331–50 and—responding to an English version ofSchürmann’s essay—John Sallis, Platonic Legacies(Albany: State University of NewYork Press, 2004), pp. 61–78.178chapter four"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"themselves did not pursue very far the relation between the ellipti-cal proposition and non-propositional or non-predicative language ingeneral.183Although this conclusion is true with respect to strictlyphilosophical texts, we should probably modify it in the light of cer-tain philosophical-literary materials.Among the extant works of Proclus are seven Hymns: I. “to Helios,”II. “to Aphrodite,” III. “to the Muses,” IV. “to the gods, in com-mon,” V. “to the Lycian Aphrodite,” VI. “to Hecate and Janus, incommon,” VII. “to Athene of many devices.”184Although the writerhimself does not explicitly state the linguistic theory underlying hishymns, it is relatively simple to reconstruct it by comparing Plato’stwofold characterization of a hymn as on the one hand praise andon the other hand prayer with Proclus’ habit of including in eachhymn a longer middle section praising the deity and a briefer finalsection praying to that deity.185That the content of praise and prayeris more crucial to the definition of a hymn than its expression inmetrical or musical terms is indicated by the striking fact that Critias’narration of Atlantis in the Timaeusand both the first and the sec-ond hypotheses of the Parmenidesare described as “hymns” by Proclushimself.186Now considering the Proclean notion of hymn in the con-text of our argument elaborated above, we may conclude that sinceprayer is to a large degree a non-predicative utterance or consistsof non-predicative utterances expressed in the imperative, subjunc-tive, or optative rather than the indicative mood, and since praiseis to a large degree a non-predicative utterance or plurality of non-predicative utterances in which the enumeration of predicates seemsmore important than the attribution of predicate to subject, the hymn183See pp. 168–9.184These hymns can now be found in a modern edition with good commen-tary” R.M. van den Berg, Proclus’ Hymns.

Marion argues that this pragmatic discourse of prayer involvesa “denomination” which does not assign a name to a nameableobject but rather refers the user to an interlocutor beyond name,this denominative utterance avoiding the predicative structure of lan-guage and the dichotomy of true and false.190Now Marion is per-ceptive in finding this pragmatic discourse in a Neoplatonic text,although one must take issue with his interpretation of ps.-Dionysius’references to aitia(= “cause”—implying predicative language) byextracting a sense of aiteo (= “request”—implying non-predicative187In discussing prayer in this way, we are obviously suggesting not that textsbased on prayer and praise contain no statements or propositions but that the prayerand praise elements in such texts do not depend on propositional form in order tohave meaning. For example, the so-called “aretology”—the praising of some godor goddess through enumeration of his or her virtues—is actually a rhythmic tab-ulation of terms. It is probably because of this fact that the first and second hypothe-ses of the Parmenidesare described as “hymns” to the One and the other gods orhenads by Proclus. 188Proclus, De Sacrificio et Magia, in Catalogue des manuscrits alchimiques grec, vol. 6,ed.

On this description of the hypostasis of Intellect (in which theetymology of the name Kronos is also exploited) see Plotinus, Enn.V. 9 [5] 8, 8;VI 7 [38] 35, 26, etc.193The contrast between Heidegger and Derrida suggested here is not an extremeone, since Derrida does follow the Heideggerian critique of the predicative utter-ance in many texts. See for example Jacques Derrida, “The Supplement of Copula.Philosophy before Linguistics,” in MP, pp. 198–205 where the issues raised includei.the presence in all natural languages of at least some analogue of the mark ofpredication, and ii.the rise of the third person singular to pre-eminent rank in alllanguages.

In practice, thissense of spacing represents the ambiguity whereby a word can beundecidably a noun or a conjunction—for example oras “gold” oras “well (then)”—, a noun or a verb—for example le litas “the bed”and “(he) reads it” —, and one or two words—for example sonor/sonoreas “his gold” or “sounding.”197Concerning the reduction inimportance of the word understood as a centralized cluster of mean-ings, it is possible that Derrida is particularly correcting the Heideg-gerian understanding of a word. Thus, Mallarmé’s handling of spacingcan be seen as undermining the “gathering” of meaning in a singleword and the orientation of polysemy towards a fixed “horizon.”198In the second half of “La double séance,” a longer essay onMallarmé published in La dissémination, the Mallarméan term hymenis interpreted as a typical Derridean general structure substitutablewith “pharmakon,” “supplement,” “différance,” and the like.199Here,we learn that “hymen” represents spacing not only in the generalsense of opposition and mediation of continuity-discontinuity, inside-outside, identity-difference but also spacing in the more particularsense of opposition and mediation of composition-decomposition withrespect to syntax and logic. In dealing with syntax, Derrida notesthat the hymen’s primary meaning of “between” has as one of itssubordinate meanings “syncategorem”—for example, the preposition197Mall., pp. 114–16, 118–19, 122–3, 125.198Mall., p. 115—the terms “gathering” and “horizon” particularly recall Heidegger.Derrida’s criticism of Heidegger’s preoccupation with the word as an isolable unitis closely connected—via the notion of metaphor (which depends on the isolationand hence substitution of such units)—with his criticism of Heidegger’s excessiverecourse to spatial imagery. See Jacques Derrida, “The Ends of Man,” in MP, pp.128–34 and especially n. 34 criticizing the domination of a metaphorics of prox-imity in works like the “Letter on Humanism” which describes how Being is fur-ther from man than all beings yet closer to man than every being, how man’sproper essence is his ek-static inherence in Being, and how Being is the nearnessoccurring in language (“Letter on Humanism,” trans. F.A. Capuzzi, in Pathm., pp.253–9); and like On Time and Beingwhich describes how true Time is four-dimen-sional: an original extending or nearing nearness bringing future, past, and presentnear to one another by distancing them from one another (TB, p. 15). Derridaadmits that the thinking of the near and far in passages such as these is not anontic but an ontological proximity. He concludes nevertheless that Heidegger, inattempting to think this nearness and distance, is being forced to metaphorize thevery language of presence which he has formerly deconstructed.199Jacques Derrida, DS, pp. 219–22.182chapter four"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"or the conjunction—and that this “between” can even represent theovercoming of syntax where the syncategorem of the medieval seman-ticists can become quasi-categorematic.200In dealing with logic, henotes that the primary meaning “between” of hymen has as one ofits subordinate meanings “logical function”—for example, conjunc-tion or disjunction—and that this “between” can further representthe overcoming of logic where an undecidable proposition in Gödel’ssense is neither true nor false with respect to a set of axioms.201Ifsyntax and logic themselves represent different kinds of spacing, thenthe syncategorematic term and the undecidable proposition whenunderstood in the manner suggested by Derrida represent areas nei-ther strictly isolable nor strictly non-isolable within the syntactic andlogical space respectively. It is on this basis also that the conven-tional theory of metaphor—which depends in turn upon a certainconcept of “nominalization”—lays itself open to deconstructivecritique.2024.3Of the SecretAlthough “Passions” will eventually be combined with “Sauf le Nom(Post-Scriptum)” and “Khòra” to form what Derrida terms “a sortof Essay on the Namein three chapters or three steps,” considerationof the circumstances of its original composition as a separate itemmay best serve to orientate us as readers on the borderline betweenDeconstruction and Neoplatonism. Originally, Derrida had beeninvited to contribute to a collection of essays about his work entitledDerrida: a Critical Readerand edited by David Wood. Since the invi-tation referred to a stimulus towards a certain passion, suggested asa title “An Oblique Offering” and listed precisely twelve contributors,200DS, pp. 221–2. Derrida describes this process as a “remarking of the seman-tic void” consisting of three phases: 1. the syncategorematic term functions as spac-ing and articulation but does not signify the latter; 2. the syncategorem becomes acategorem; 3. the syncategorematic term no longer functions as spacing and artic-ulation but now signifies the latter201DS, pp. 219–20. Derrida here fully states the thesis of Gödel: namely, thatan undecidable proposition is a proposition which, given a system of axioms gov-erning a multiplicity, is neither an analytical nor deductive consequence of thoseaxioms, nor in contradiction with them, and neither true nor false with respect tothose axioms.202For a detailed discussion of this point see Jacques Derrida, WM, pp. 233–41(and especially p. 234, n. 39).. . . remains to be thought183"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Derrida suspected that the project was being conceived consciouslyor subconsciously as a parody of the Christian ritual of the Eucharist.He decides to accept the invitation by writing in such a manner thathe can sustain and subvert the parody at the same time. Therefore,against the background of a general reflection on the question ofresponding or not responding to appeals, Derrida unfolds an elabo-rate counterpoint between the passion of eucharistic sacrifice and thepassion of deconstructive undecidability, this counterpoint beingreflected in his choice of the plural term “Passions” as final title ofhis contribution.203But this contextualization only points to a superficial reading ofthe text. A more incisive reading shows that “Passions” is structuredaround three descriptions and/or enactments: 1. of a ceremony, whichis described in section I by contrasting the position of someone whoanalyzes a ritual and someone who participates in a ritual, and whichis enacted in section III; 2. of thedilemmaof responding or not respond-ing to a call. This is described in section II where it is expanded intoa discussion of ethical responsibility in a general sense; and 3. of asecretwhich is described in the litany of six denials followed by oneaffirmation and also enacted through that litany, description andenactment being fused.204The three descriptions and/or enactmentsare further connected either directly or indirectly among themselves.203In the opinion of the present writer, Derrida parodies not only the eucharistand the crucifixion but also the hexaemeron in this essay. See below n. 220.204As we shall see, the enactment of the secret in Derrida has affinities with theenactment called “theurgy” in (post-Plotinian) Neoplatonism. Since the relevantsources of information are rather sparse or fragmentary, there is some controversyover the precise nature of theourgia(which means literally “god-working”). However,the latter seems to represent a human action in relation to the gods, or a divineaction in relation to humans, or an action through which the human becomesdivine. On a lower level, this action may take a ritualistic form, although a highertype of theurgy perhaps no longer requires the ritual. On the lower level, this oper-ation can result in the production of miraculous external events. This contrasts withthe production, on the higher level, of a miraculous internal event—the progres-sive divinization of the human soul as it reverts first to the level of certain inter-mediate gods and secondly to the supreme god or the One. On the lower levelalso, the action may take a verbal form, whereas the higher type of theurgy nolonger requires this verbalization. For our current purposes, the most importantpoints to note are i.that theurgy is held to represent practical action where phi-losophy is viewed as implying theoretical contemplation—here, theurgy is similar tothe enactment of the Derridean secret to be discussed below—; ii.that the ritualor verbal mode of operation is distinct from, lower than, and separable from anon-ritual and non-verbal mode—here, theurgy is dissimilar to the enactment ofthe Derridean secret.

The role assigned in “Passions” tonegative theology is more restricted.212Its function is to reinforce theenactment of the ceremony in a quasi-logical manner. In what follows,we shall discuss the relation between the performative and negativetheology by summarizing the litany of denials and affirmations, quotingthe important passage which introduces the litany, and extracting atheory of performativity and negative theology from the litany andits introduction.It is in section III of Derrida’s essay that the issues selected fordiscussion appear in their most concentrated form. The argumentbegins with a rapid transition from the aporia of response and non-response in the sphere of ethics: that is, the topic of the previoussection, the transition being effected by the comment that the writer’slanguage continues to function despite the moral dilemma.213Thenext stage of the argument—prefixed by a kind of testamentary for-mula: “we testify to...therefore, let us say” (nous témoignons de...disons donc)—is the description-enactment of the secret through theceremony. This consists of six denials of what the secret is, eachtime introduced by the phrase “there is something secret there” (ily a là du secret).The six negations are:214First negation: the secret is not something lying behind the tech-nique of a gifted artist like the imagination which Kant associateswith the transcendental schematism.Second negation: the secret is not a representation dissimulatedby a conscious subject nor the content of an unconscious represen-tation. It is not the subjectivity which Kierkegaard opposed to theHegelian Concept and called “existence.”constative utterance “he refuses N1in favour of N2”. There is also in case i.noseparation between the description and the enactment, but in case ii.a separationproduced by the refusal and substitution.

It exceeds the play of concealment and revelationand/or forgetting and recalling. It has no relation—even negatively—to phenomenality. It is not even “made” in the Augustinian sense.Sixth negation: The secret is neither in speech nor outside speechand both in speech and outside speech. In the ethical sense, it doesnot answer either to itself or anyone else.215Typographically separated from the rest of the text, a statementthat “there is no longer either time or place there” (là il n’y a plusle temps, ni la place) divides the six denials from the one affirmation.216The one affirmation now follows:217This establishes i.an association between the secret and literaturewhere a.the secret is something about literature, literature itself beingsomething in place of the secret, b.there is no secret behind thesurface of the text, or alternatively: the secret is that there is nosecret, c.the secret is a possibility which exceeds the simulacrum ofliterature, the simulacrum itself testifying to this possibility.218It alsoestablishes ii.some connection between the secret and the typicalDerridean general structures where a.passion and secret are inter-dependent, b.the non-objectifiable aspect of the secret represents thestructure of the trace, c.the secret calls us back to the other although215Although the passage is ostensibly constructed from six denials of what thesecret is, it also includes several affirmations regarding the nature of the secret.Thus—within the fourth negation—the secret is what makes the disclosures ofrevealed religion or esoteric philosophy and the learned ignorance of the negativetheologian possible;—within the fifth negation—the secret is homonymy, not in thesense of a hidden resource, but in that of a functional possibility of homonymy.Moreover, it is the functional possibility of mimesis; and—within the sixth negation—the secret is impassive like the Khòra.216However, the next section of text contains some further denials e.g. with ref-erence to Husserl’s and Heidegger’s position that the secret is neither of consciousnessnor of subject, nor of Dasein, nor of authentic Dasein.217PA, p. 27ff.218On these points see further pp. 194–6.. . . remains to be thought187"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"it is itself the other, d.solitude and secret are synonymous, and e.the excessive aspect of the secret constitutes the structure of theremainder.219The enactment of the ceremony or description-enactment of thesecret displays a number of interesting features. In particular, thereference to the use of the verb “I testify:” introduces the notion ofperformativity, while the sequence of six denials and one affirmationsuggests the context of negative theology. The presence of a Heideg-gerian intertext is also detectable, since the impersonal verb il y a(“There is”) in French could be a translation of the impersonal verbes gibt(“There is/it gives”) in German favored by Heidegger, thecombination of the earlier performative verb and the present impersonalverb bringing the non-predicative element shared by the two verbsto the forefront, and since the sequential denial of the secret recallsin some manner the epochal withdrawal of Being in Heidegger’sthought.220However, although this enactment of the ceremony ordescription-enactment of the secret introduces the notions of perfor-mativity and negative theology, it does not explain the nature ofeither. For this explanation we must turn to the passage which imme-diately precedes the description-enactment proper.It runs as follows:221Let us say that there is a secret here. Let us testify: There is somethingsecret. We will leave the matter here for today but not without an exer-cise on the essence and existence of such a secret, an exercise thatwill have an apophatic aspect. The apophatic is not here necessarilydependent on negative theology, even if it makes it possible, too. Andwhat we are attempting to put to the test is the possibility, in truththe impossibility, for any testimony to guarantee itself by expressingitself in the following form and grammar: “Let us testify that . . .” We219It is not difficult to see, especially on the basis of its identifications with theother and remainder, that the secret is closely connected with the neutral term inthe (a)semiotic square (à1à2). But it is peculiar to the secret, at least in the treat-ment of “Passions,” that this neutral term is strictly relative to performativity.220On Derrida’s use of the Heideggerian es gibtin the companion essay “Sauf leNom” see p. 32. The suggestion of a Heideggerian intertext is reinforced at theend of the six denials. Here, the combination of the “There is . . .” phrase andtime/space recalls Heidegger’s combination of the es gibtformula with Being andtime/space—see Martin Heidegger, TB, p. 16ff. There is also a further suggestionof a biblical intertext. This is the famous account in the book of Genesisof the sixdays of creation which begins with an imperative “Let there be light” and contin-ues with a sixfold repetitive formula “And God said”, etc. 221PA, pp. 23–4/Passions (Paris: Galilée, 1993), p. 56. 188chapter four"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"testify to a secret that is without content, without a content separablefrom its performative experience, from its performative tracing. (Weshall not say from its performative enunciationor from its propositionalargumentation; and we keep in reserve a number of questions about per-formativity in general.) Let us say therefore: There is something secretIn order to begin a reading of this passage, we should recall somepoints discussed earlier in connection with “Sauf le Nom.” At thatpoint, the outline of a general theory of performativity was preparedby showing how the combinatory mechanism of the (a)semiotic squareby being equally applicable to elements functioning in the non-seman-tic sphere—the phonemes and morphemes—, to elements operatingin the semantic sphere—the denotations and connotations—, and tothe various processes serving to connect or disconnect these twospheres,222underlies the possibility of exchange between signifier andsignified. At that point also, we inserted some comments on specificapplications of performativity: for example, the structures of the Tracewhereby the anagrammic connection between trace(= “mark” or“trail”) and écart(= “gap” or “deviation”) reflects on the level of thesignifier the association between necessary sequence and randomdeviation on that of the signified,223and the structure of the Re-Markwhereby the proliferation of quasi-homonyms like marche(= “step”)and marge(= “margin”) and quasi-synonyms like pli(= “fold”) andhymen(= “hymen”) reflects on the level of the signifier the infinitemultiplication implied by the original term on that of the signified.224Now the quoted passage is important because it gives us somefurther details regarding the nature of the performative implied inthe description-enactment of the secret:225namely, that there is aperformative “experience” (expérience) which must be prior to bothperformative “utterance” (énonciation) and propositional argumenta-tion,226given that the secret has a content inseparable from perfor-mative experience but not inseparable from performative utterance222For the combinatory mechanism of the (a)semiotic square see chapter 2, pp.42–3, 49–50 and n. 51. 223See chapter 2, pp. 75–6.224See chapter 2, pp. 77–8.225In the present volume, we have simply employed the terms “performative”—meaning discourse which attempts to state certain truths while embodying thosetruths in the mode of utterance—and “Austinian performative” in separate con-texts. It is now necessary to consider more precisely the relation between thesedifferent kinds of performative.226Derrida identifies performative experiencewith performative tracing.

What these different kinds of per-formativity represent is not specified.227However, we may perhapselucidate or expand Derrida’s meaning first, by considering the dis-tinction—within that general definition of performative language aslanguage implying some intensified relation between description and enactment—between 1.performatives where description is actu-ally identicalwith enactment (or in semiotic terms, where signifier isidentical with signified)—examples of such usages would be the ver-bal expressions “I promise” and “I bequeath,” these representingutterances which are neither true nor false and which occur in onegrammatical form (first person, present tense, of verb);228and 2.per-formatives where description is merely parallelwith enactment (or insemiotic terms, where signifier is parallel with signified)—examplesof such usages would be the general structures of Trace and Re-mark, these representing utterances which are neither true nor falseto the extent that they are enactments and which occur in a varietyof grammatical (and also syntactic) forms.229We may further elucidateand expand Derrida’s meaning secondly, by identifying as the per-formative experience—the “arche-” performative—a certain hypothet-ical dual-unitary basis of all non-predicative and polysemous linguistic227One is tempted to speculate on the nature of the performative in the contextof Neoplatonic theurgy (see above, n. 204). According to Proclus,CRemp.II. 64.5ff. phonetic aspects of language are exploited in theurgic ritual, and according toIamblichus, De Mysteriis, ed. E. Des Places (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1966) 3. 13,129. 14ff. graphic aspects are similarly employed. Presumably, these usages are per-formative in the sense of establishing parallelism between the description and enact-ment. See Franz Dornseiff, Das Alphabet in Mystik und Magie.2. Aufl. (Leipzig: Teubner,1925), Stephen Gersh, From Iamblichus to Eriugena, Excursus, pp. 289–304, and MaurusHirschle, Sprachphilosophie und Namenmagie im Neuplatonismus mit einem Exkurs zu “Demokrit”B 142(Meisenheim am Glan: Hain, 1979).228This type of performative is here called the “Austinian” performative in hon-our of the philosopher who first drew attention to it. Among further importantaspects of these performatives are i.the distinction between performative (not capa-ble of being true or false) and “constative” utterances (capable of being true andfalse); ii.the notion that performatives, although not capable of being true or false,may be more or less successful depending on the circumstances.

Warnock (Oxford:Clarendon Press, 1961), pp. 44–84 and How to Do Things with Words(Oxford: OxfordU.P., 1962).229On this type of performative see our discussion in chapter 2, pp. 75–6, 77–8.It should be noted that in reading “Passions” we must lay emphasis particularlyupon the performativeaspect of the Derridean general structures.

Thus, the distinction between the hypothetical basis and theapplications of the basis is indicated by the contrasts between whatis about literature and what is literature and between what exceedsthe simulacrum of literature and what is the simulacrum of litera-ture stated in the affirmative description of the secret.233The dual-unitary character of the hypothetical basis itself is indicated by thereferences to such implicit doublings as the functional possibility ofhomonymy and the functional possibility of mimesis among theaffirmations introduced into the negative description of the secret.234Without the distinction between the hypothetical basis and theapplications of the basis and without the characterization of the230The basis is “hypothetical” in the sense that no extra-linguistic referent isassumed. The basis is “dual-unitary” in being differentialand referential.231On polysemy see chapter 2, pp. 42–3 and n. 51; on the relation betweenpolysemy and the general structures see chapter 2, pp. 75–6, 77–8.232Our interpretation of the distinction between performative experience and per-formative utterance seems sufficient to explain the text under discussion. However,it is likely that the distinction is ultimately one of degree rather than kind and thatcertain linguistic or textual usages will have an ambiguous status. Here, we shallsimply note that performativeutterancewill be represented by all individual instancesof Austinian performatives (e.g. the spoken act of promising and the written act ofsigning a will) and all individual instances of the Derridean general structures (e.g.a supplementary structure in a spoken communication or a trace structure in awritten text); performative experiencewill be represented by the properties which maybe instantiated or the possibilities which may be realized in the individual utter-ances (e.g. the intensified relation of description and enactment, the combinationof the grammatical properties of first person and singular and present tense, theconfiguration based on the (a)semiotic square, etc.) as well as the hypothetical dual-ity-unity underlying all such properties). 233See pp. 187–8.234See n. 215.. . . remains to be thought191"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"hypothetical basis as dual-unitary, we would not be able to arguewith Derrida that all performatives necessarily imply those possibilitiesof repetition and citation which are actualized when we rewrite anexpression like “I call” in the form “Khòra calls us” and which retainthe non-predicative connotation unmodified within that grammaticalchange.235The passage quoted is also important because it gives us someinformation concerning the relation between the performative andnegative theology implied in the description-enactment of the secret:namely, that there is an “apophatic aspect” (allure apophatique) notidentifiable with negative theology and a negative theology depen-dent on the apophatic aspect.236Now although it seems obvious thatthe performative experience coincides with the apophatic aspect notidentifiable with negative theology while the performative utterancecoincides with the negative theology dependent on the apophaticaspect, several questions remain including 1.Is the performativeutterance that coincides with negative theology in the enactment-description a performative utterance in the sense of a verbal expres-sion or verbal expressions or a performative utterance in the senseof a general structure or general structures?; and 2.Does the per-formative utterance coincide with negative theology in the description-enactment a.because the enactment is performative and the descriptionis of negative theology or b.because both the enactment and thedescription are of negative theology?These questions can perhaps be answered by reflecting on thecourse of the description-enactment of the secret itself. Here, we235On performatives as iterable and citational see Jacques Derrida, LI.Derridahas discussed the entire Austinian performative theory in two essays and alsoresponded to the critique leveled against him by Austin’s follower Searle. The ear-lier essay by Derrida is “Signature, Event, Context,” in MP, pp. 307–30. The anti-Derridean critique is John R. Searle, “Reiterating the Differences. A Reply toDerrida,” in Glyph1 (1977), pp. 198–208—where it follows a reprint of Derrida’sessay. Derrida’s later essay is “Limited Inc.: abc,” in LI.The materials of the entiredebate are conveniently assembled in LI.236One is tempted to speculate further on the relation between the performativeand negative theology in the context of Neoplatonic theurgy (see above, n. 204).Since according to the doctrine of the Athenian School of Neoplatonism one canonly revert above the level of the intermediate gods by using theurgy—see chap-ter 4. 2, n. 91—, the activity of enunciating affirmations and negations around theOne which represents the natural “travail” (òdis) of the soul with respect to the Oneat the end of the dialectical process must be performative in character. See Proclus,CParm.VII. 1191, 5–9, VII. 70 (K.-L.) Moerbeke, Damascius, Dubitationes et Solutiones,ed. L.G. Westerink and J. Combès (Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1986–91) I. 9. 1–2,II. 22. 19–20, II. 68. 18–21, etc.192chapter four"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"must take account of a statement if not of negative theology itselfat least of something analogous to negative theology in the mannerof a repetitionwhere Derrida reiterates his statement that the secret“is not . . .” But since negative theology when treated deconstructively—and given a more overtly temporal reading —is itself a repetition,we have a situation where enactment parallels description and alsosignifier parallels signified. Therefore, Repetition as a performativeutterance in the sense of an individual instance of a general struc-ture here coincides with negative theology in that both the enact-ment and the description are of negative theology itself. Having dulyreminded ourselves of the earlier arguments relative to this case inwhich negative theology was shown to depend on the mechanism ofthe (a)semiotic square237and the mechanism of the (a)semiotic squarewas shown to depend on repeatability, ideality, and repetition,238wecan turn to a further instance. Here, we are presented with a state-ment not simply of something analogous to negative theology but ofnegative theology itself in the manner of a deferralwhere Derridapostpones his statement that negative theology “is . . .” And sincenegative theology when handled deconstructively—and given a moreexplicitly temporal reading —is itself a deferral, we again have a sit-uation where enactment parallels description and also signifier par-allels signified. Thus, deferral as a performative utterance in the senseof an individual instance of a general structure here coincides withnegative theology in that both the enactment and the descriptionare of negative theology itself.239Of course, Derrida emphasizes the distinction between performa-tive experience and performative utterance and consequently the dis-tinction between “apophaticism” (l’apophatisme) and negative theology.240This position would be a reasonable one to maintain if what is called“negative theology” were confined to the sphere of propositional237See chapter 2, pp. 62, 93–4.238See chapter 2, pp. 46–7.239For the interpretation of negative theology summarized here see Derrida, HAS,pp. 83, 86, etc.240Two final points are worth making in connection with the performative inter-pretation of negative theology: i.Since repetition and deferral constitute generalstructures in the Derridean sense, one could presumably introduce further enact-ments of negative theology using other general structures: for example, Trace,Supplement, or Re-Mark; ii.the performative interpretation of negative theologyseems to go beyond even the pseudo-Dionysian system where, despite the emphasison the negative handling of divine names, liturgical practice is based entirely onaffirmative methods.. . . remains to be thought193"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"argumentation which he associates with performative utterance. Theposition is however less defensible if the discoursive context of neg-ative theology by combining the non-predicative and the predicativecrosses the boundary between performative experience and perfor-mative utterance. But the latter account is the truer one. Nevertheless,we shall follow Derrida’s line of thought to its conclusion with someremarks about the “secret.”The Derridean SecretIn our interpretation of “Passions” we have suggested that the secretwhich is enacted and described amounts to “a certain hypotheticaldual-unitary basis of all non-predicative and polysemous linguisticapplications and also of all predicative and monosemous applica-tions,” the Austinian performatives representing non-predicative andmonosemous applications of the dual-unitary basis and the Derrideangeneral structures representing non-predicative and polysemous appli-cations of the dual-unitary basis.241When Derrida himself describesthe secret as something about literature or something exceeding lit-erature we can understand this statement as applying specifically tothe dual-unitary basis itself of the non-predicative and monosemousand non-predicative and polysemous linguistic applications, and whenhe similarly describes the secret as the absence of a secret behindthe text his statement can be understood as applying specifically tothe non-predicative and monosemous and to the non-predicative andpolysemous linguistic applications themselves of that basis.242This conclusion is a reasonable stopping point for reading the textof “Passions.” However, Derrida has attached a very copious end-note to his essay which requires some brief comments.243This note establishes an important connection between the secretand exemplarity. Having introduced the topic with a reference tothe “exemplarysecret” (secretexemplaire) of literature—a phrase whichcould mean in accordance with the Derridean principle of exemplarity241See p. 191.242See pp. 188–9. When Derrida speaks of the absence of a secret behind thetext, what he means is that—insofar as the text establishes non-predicative andmonosemous or non-predicative and polysemous utterances—there is no extra-linguisticreferent. On this understanding of the textual secret see Derrida GT, p. 150ff.243PA, p. 142, n. 14.194chapter four"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"that literature is undecidably the paradigm of the class of secrets oronly a member of the class of secrets—Derrida goes on to demon-strate that the antithesis of exemplary and substitutive implies notonly i.the antithesis of singular and common terms but also ii.theantithesis of performative and non-performative utterances.244Thefirst demonstration is made directly near the beginning of the note.Derrida explains that if “I” write about myself, I can claim to bewriting simultaneously about “I” as an individual, about any other“I,” and about the “I” in general—an explanation that utilizes therelation between the exemplary “I” and the substitutive “I.”245Thesecond demonstration emerges indirectly in the course of the note,and consists of a series of suggestions regarding performativity. Themain suggestions are a.the notion that I cannot be contradicted inmaking my claim about the “I”—thus, the dichotomy of true andfalse is suspended; ii. the statement that if I write about “I,” then Iam also writing about the process of writing about “I.”—this indi-cates that the action and the referent are not distinct; iii.the state-ment that if I write about “I,” then I am engaging in an act oftestimony—this identifies the action with one of the standard per-formatives.246In ascribing these features to an exemplary action,Derrida is clearly not enumerating performative utterancesbut rather—by alluding to properties of performativity as such—signalizing per-formative expression. For this reason, he can argue that what is beingdiscussed “does not require utterance” (n’attend pas la parole), and thatthe difference involved is “pragmatic and not properly linguistic”(pragmative et non proprement linguistique). Moreover in elaborating thisdescription of an exemplary action, Derrida is clearly establishingthe performative expression as the basis of general structures. This244The main text of “Passions” does include references to exemplarity which,however, do not take us in the direction marked by the endnote Thus, Derridaapplies the notion of example to ceremony (see PA, pp. 8–9 on a rule which isrecurrent and general as well as singular and exemplary; PA, p. 23 on the exam-ple of the ceremonial discourse); to response and non-response (see PA, p. 9 onpoliteness as an example of all normative concepts; PA, p. 13 on the exemplaryequivocity of the “as” in the structure of responsibility); and to secret (see PA, p. 7 on the use of an example of a secret to judge the secret in general; PA, p. 29 on the exemplary secret manifested in literature).245PA, p. 143.246PA, pp. 143–4, n. 14.
