This surprising conclusion forces itself upon everyone who considers the influence of Plato's works through the course of the centuries and does not confine himself to the present or to the near past. He will see this influence pictured in the famous 'School of Athens' by Raphael, representing the old philosopher with the Timaeus in his hands. Pointing this out, Rivaud also observes that Aristotle paid much attention to this work and that Crantor was the first of a whole series of commentators 1). Among these are the Stoic Posidonius and the Aristotelian Adrastus. Evidently this dialogue made a great impression, even outside the Academy. The cause of this is found in both the special character and the subject-matter of the Timaeus. For whereas in his dialogues Plato usually expresses his opinion on a few points only or not at all, in the Timaeus he is not afraid to do so. It is true, he cautions the readers that his argument, owing to the nature of the subject, can only lay claim to probability,-it is only an opinion (M;oc) in the typical Platonic sense-but immediately he follows this up with the assertion that in this respect his theory is second to none (Tim. 29C). Further, the very central problem of the subject treated is the origin of things. The Timaeus may indeed be called 'Plato's book of Genesis'. Since he had to discuss the great problems of philosophy in this work, it could not but assume the character of a synthesis. And on account of this very character, the Timaeus gradually conquered the central place in the tradition of Platonism, both in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. In this tradition, Calcidius' work, a translation of a considerable portion of the Timaeus with a commentary on its most important chapters, stands at the end of the western Antiquity. The historical data about the author are extremely scarce, since the work itself 1) Platon, CEuvres CompWes, t. X, texte et trad., Paris, 1925, p. 3 (Ed. Bude). Philosophia Antigua, VIII"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2 INTRODUCTION is the only source of information. And even this leaves the reader most uncertain. The title of the preface gives us the bare minimum. The manuscripts read: O(s)sioC (h)alcidius. This O(s)sius is generally identified with the well-known O(s)sius or Hosius, bishop of Cor-dova, who played such an important part at the councils of Nicaea (325) and Sardica (343). This is confirmed by the title of the eleventh-century codex Excorialensis s. III, 5: Osio episcopo Calcidius archidiaconus 1). Ossius was bishop during the first half of the fourth century (± 295-357). Calcidius must have written his study in that period, probably after visiting the Near East in the company of his master. As appears from his introduction the work was commissioned by Ossius. The mystery which surrounds the author is in sharp contrast with the fame of his book. For centuries the West drew its knowledge about Plato chiefly from this work. During this time Plato's fate lay, so to say, in the hands of Calcidius. And, in consequence, the respect paid to Plato was shared by Calcidius. Plato chiefly meant the Timaeus, and the Timaeus as translated and explained by Calcidius. Switalski 2) gives some striking examples of this esteem. At times Calcidius was extolled above Aristotle, and, as late as in 1507, he was com-pared to Prometheus by Jacobus Antiquarius. Today the tangible evidence of the honour paid to him is found in the great number of Calcidius' Timaeus manuscripts. This state of affairs was bound to change when Plato began to be known from other and better sources. From that time the fates of the Timaeus and Calcidius' work became very different. The former lost its supremacy; more attention was paid to the so-called dialogues of the middle period, such as the Phaedo, the Symposium and the Republic. In this way the Timaeus was looked upon as a work of the old period and more and more relegated to the background. Not until recently has this dialogue begun to draw more attention. Instances are found in the great commen-taries by Taylor 3) and Cornford'), the latter masterly correcting 1) A. C. Vega, La Ciudad de Dios, 152 (1936), p. 154 ss. On the testimony of the best manuscripts Vega and de Clercq (cp. p. 6, n. 1) write Calcidius instead of the customary Chalcidi.is. Their reading is followed by the present author. 2) Des Chalcidius Kommentar zu Plato's Timaeus, in Beitrage zur Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters, Bnd.

This interest is entirely justified by the strong influen~e of the Timaeus on the development of philosophy, especially Platonism. It may further increase, if the Timaeus appears to be not one of the dialogues of Plato's old-age, but rather of the middle period, following the Republic. Owen 1) and Wilpert 2) defend this with very strong arguments. How did Calcidius fare meanwhile? Here too a distinction should be made between esteem on account of the work's inner value and that on account of its historical value. The esteem of Calcidius as a philosopher has decreased ever since the Middle Ages. Whereas Fabricius, publishing an edition in 1718 3), was rather favourably impressed by various parts of the text, later historians, among whom Joh. Wrobel (1876), the last editor of the text, showed little respect for the author's talents. They look upon his work as entirely dependent on others, a compilation 4). The most unfavourable verdict, quoted in Switalski, is given by Gercke, who speaks of a ,,radebrechenden Obersetzung (des An-fangs) eines griechischen Kommentars von einem nur mit Miihe Latein schreibenden Manche\". But it should be borne in mind that these last words do not so much concern the text as its trans-lator. Still, the importance of Calcidius for the history of philosophy is beyond doubt. This statement must be considered in two ways according to the sense of tht; word 'history'. If it is taken in the meaning of the course of events, the question arises, what was Calcidius' influence on the further development of thought? But history may also be taken as disquisition and knowledge of the past. In this case we have to ask, what does Calcidius' text, as it has come down, teach us about the development of philosophy? What does it tell us about the philosophy of those days? Which data does it provide about its past? This twofold importance of Calcidius' text has not escaped the attention of historians.

But no special study on this point is available; nor will it be made here. As for the study of the text: as early as 1886 Gercke, giving such an unfavourable verdict on Calcidius as a philosopher, wrote that his text is a precious source of historical facts 1). But sixteen years had to pass before Switalski wrote the study cited above. And only in 1912 Steinheimer 2) published his criticism of Switalski. In the meantime a study appeared from the hand of Borghorst 3). Calcidius is not his immediate subject. Hence his remarks have passed unnoticed. But Borghorst gives important clues in the much disputed problem concerning the sources of Calcidius. Then in 1918 Jones') published an article, in his turn attacking the conclusions of Steinheimer. This is the last penetrating study on the subject. But this does not mean that investigation into the Calcidius' problem has reached its final stage. On the contrary, the views of the various authors are diametrically opposed and, therefore, invite further criticism. In this connexion the great interest taken in the Plato Latinus just now is important. Professor Waszink (Leiden) and professor Jensen (Copenhagen) have taken up the task of editing a critical text of Calcidius 6), thereby promoting a fresh approach of the much disputed text. For the results of former studies have clearly shewn that only detailed work on the text can bring a solution for the many difficulties that are arising. The present writer was able to use the critical apparatus and the established text which are now ready for publication. With gratitude he recalls that they are of the utmost importance even in a study of limited proportions. Ever since Aristotle the problem of matter has taken up a dominant place in philosophical thinking. In one way or another all elements and principles of 'being' are in connexion with it. Matter cannot be mentioned without form, and thus to every adherent of Platonism the question crops up about the primary form or idea, and the Demiurge, God. The principle of matter 1) Cp.

It is the refractory relic of the chaos with which he is always confronted. That such a prin-ciple lends itself to special study is obvious. And, in fact, this is the subject of the present inquiry. It concerns the last part, the thirteenth chapter, of Calcidius' commentary on the Timaeus, which deals with this central problem of matter. Calcidius entitles this De silva; Aristotle would have called it Ilept UA1)c;;, In view of what has been said above, the search should be patient and minute. But there is another reason too. The work done on other parts of Calcidius is, in some respects, more advanced, owing to a great many parallel passages. That on De silva has, however, not yet led to distinct conclusions, although hypotheses are not wanting. The crux of the matter is as follows. THE PROBLEM In the recent revival of the Calcidius' study Switalski was the first to concern himself with the place of Calcidius in the history of philosophy and with his sources. On chronological grounds Historians such as Baumker 1) and Prachter 2) placed Calcidius among the Neoplatonists. The conclusion of Switalski's study was: \"Die Urquelle fiir den chalcidianischen Kommentar ist wahr-scheinlich der Timaeuskommentar des Posidonius. Als zwischen-glieder erscheinen uns Adrast und Albinus. Wahrscheinlich ist es indes, dass ein spiiterer Grieche, der auch Numenius benutzt hat, einen einheitlichen Kommentar geschaffen, den Chalcidius bloss zu iibersetzen hatte. Die Unselbstandigkeit des Kommentars lasst es namlich fiir glaublicher erscheinen, dass ein Grieche, als dass ein so unbedeutender Lateiner verschiedene griechische Quellen benutzt haben sollte.

After an introductory chapter chiefly about the personality of Calcidius and the vicissitudes of his work, the eclectic character of his commentary is discussed. Switalski demonstrates that the keynote is Platonic and Plato the highest authority. But he also shows that great authority is given to Aristotle as well, while the Stoa and Numenius are not forgotten. Switalski next discusses the question of sources. For this purpose he distinguishes four different subjects: I) the mathe-matical-astronomical part (par. 8-n9), 2) the treatise about fate (par. 141-190), 3) passages of a dogmatic and 4) passages of an historical nature. The first two parts are treated separately because on these subjects the study of sources had already resulted in important data. For the mathematical-astronomical part, Switalski had access to the studies by Martin 2) and Hiller 3). Martin had pointed out that lengthy passages in Calcidius agree word for word with Theo of Smyrna. Hence he came to regard Theo as a source. Hiller had shewn that both Calcidius and Theo were directly dependent upon Adrastus. Switalski, in his tum, tries to prove that this dependence covers the entire mathematical and astronomical part of Calcidius. And on the strength of what he believes to be a Posidonian character in some passages, he suggests that Posidonius was the primary source for all of them. For the part about fate, Switalski could rely upon a study by Gercke '). The latter had revealed the extensive similarity between Calcidius and the Ilept elμ0tp!J£Vl)~ by Ps-Plutarch, and, 1) 0.c., p. 113. V. C. de Clercq, Ossius of Cordova. A Contribution to the History of the Constantinian Period, Washington, 1954, p. 72, sums up Calcidius' standpoint as follows: \"the general philosophical position is that of the eclectic Platonism of the second century A.D.; the main source, ac-cording to Switalski, is a Greek adaptation of Numenius (second century A.D.)\". De Clercq ascribes to Switalski !;Omething he certainly does not say. What he really says (the first part of this assertion) is not given as his opinion. 2) H.

Mus. 41 (1886) 269 ss."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 7 further, between these two treatises and some passages of Nemesius' treatise On Human Nature. All three, according to Gercke, had a common source, which he tried to identify with a Platonist of the early second century School of Gaius. Apart from this basic conclusion Switalski does not produce much of consequence, except that, to him, Albinus and Alexander of Aphrodisias probably used the same source. On the ground of some parallel texts he regards Albinus as the source of the dogmatic passages in Calcidius. He thinks that they may favour Zeller's theory that Albinus also wrote a commentary on the Timaeus, from which the Epitome is considered to be an extract. Finally, Switalski tries to show that the historical passages form a unity and are dependent upon Posidonius. Here, as he acknow-ledges himself, his arguments are far from strong. They are not much more than suggestions, based chiefly on the well-known fact that Posidonius also wrote a commentary on the Timaeus. The poverty of arguments is evident from the shortnes,; of this last chapter (pp. 107-n2). With these considerations Switalski assumes Posidonius to be the main source for the whole Calcidius. This conclusion was strongly attacked by Steinheimer. From the Posidonian character in the first part of Cakidius' book, he argues, the conclusions may not be drawn that either this part or, much less, the whole commentary was derived from Posidonius. In general, he observes, if a book contains some theories char-acteristic of another author, this does not justify far-reaching conclusions on the whole work, for it is quite normal that, in explaining difficult points, an author is influenced by his pre-decessors (o.c., p. 2). As for Albinus, he believes Switalski's opinion to be equally rash. Meanwhile, there is some unmistakable similarity between the manner of Steinheimer's argumentation and that of Switalski. As the latter sees Posidonius everywhere, so Steinheimer discovers Porphyry (and consequently Plotinus) behind almost every chapter. Thus, Calcidius' book becomes Neoplatonic and, ulti-mately, only a translation of a lost work by Porphyry. But, one may ask, was such a poor work worthy of Porphyry? Steinheimer thinks it was; to him the treatise is not of inferior quality but based on good and skilfully selected sources (o.c., p. 47). Steinheimer's argument is an accumulation of parallel passages all of which, in his"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"8 INTRODUCTION opinion, point to Porphyry. To discuss them one by one would be beyond the scope of this survey; several must be examined in connexion with the chapter on matter. Besides, the whole of Steinheimer's enquiry has already been criticized thoroughly in Jones' Chalcidius and N eoplatonism. Jones agrees with Steinheimer in his attitude towards Switalski, but after this he examines Steinheimer's arguments. He shows that the texts of Porphyry (i.e., practically of Plotinus) quoted by Steinheimer as the sources of Calcidius are either not identical or, if they are, can already partly be indicated before Porphyry and so need not have been derived from him, and are partly really met with first in Porphyry; but on this account they need not be more than parallel passages which do not guarantee any dependence. Jones also notices that, unlike the Neoplatonists, Calcidius regards matter as an independent principle. But if Calcidius, who was a Christian, should have been a follower of Neoplatonism, he would certainly have taken matter as a dependent principle, because this would have been consistent with his religious convictions. He concludes that the similarity between Calcidius and Plotinus should rather be explained from a common source. Although the thesis by Borghorst appeared in 1905, it remained unnoticed and it may safely be treated outside the chronological order. Its starting-point was an investigation into the sources of Anatolius' treatise on numbers. The subject had been treated by others, among whom also Calcidius. Borghorst now argues that all their speculations go back to a common source, namely Posidonius. This conclusion was not surprising. Borghorst himself tells us that he found it ready-made in Schmekel's Philosophie der mittleren Stoa 1); he only amplified it and gave it a more solid historical foundation. This may be the reason why Borghorst's work drew little attention. Still, his considerations about Calcidius, indeed, bring something new; for Borghorst defends the theory that Adras-tus was the source for almost the whole Calcidius. His argument runs as follows: when Calcidius took the first part of his work from Adrastus, he did it with so little understanding that only two hypotheses can be considered for the remaining portion of the work: he took this from either Adrastus or another commentator of the Timaeus. Since this portion has evidently a strong Aristotelian I) Berlin, 1892, p. 424."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 9 character-Switalski already pointed this out-and since Adrastus is known as an orthodox Aristotelian and the author of a comment-ary on the Timaeus, the conclusion is obvious: Adrastus was the source for the whole Calcidius, except, of course, for such passages as cannot possibly be connected with him. Such are the chapters on the Jews and on Pythagoras; for the latter Calcidius himself gave the source, viz., Numenius 1). The Stoic Posidonius, the Aristotelian Adrastus, the Neopla-tonist Porphyry, or even Plotinus himself are successively claimed to be the intellectual forebears of Calcidius. This, probably unique situation at once raises a fundamental question: what is the cause of such a striking divergency of opinions? Does Calcidius offer such a medley of opinions that everyone finds in his work what he is looking for? Or have modem authors perhaps built their conclusions on too narrow a basis? Have they drawn conclusions about the whole work on a restricted number of items and then read and, if necessary, twi5ted the whole text according to these conclusions; in other words, have they passed too easily from induction to deduction? Of all scholars Borghorst is the least blameworthy in this respect. His argument has a very strong justification in a strong Aristotelian strand which runs through the work and, especially, in a long passage which, no doubt, is derived from the Aristotelian Adrastus. Yet even here, the inductive element appears to be rather weak. He does not explain how an Aristotelian-informed Calcidius could profess to be a Platonist, and at least on one very important point, viz., the theory of the soul, does reject the Aristotelian doctrine (par. 225). This rejection cannot come from the orthodox Aristotelian Adrastus. So Borghorst's con-clusion too is not sufficiently well-founded on accurate study of the text. The only manner to avoid this dead-lock is the method of maintained induction by a patient and exact study of the text. Here as elsewhere the first rule must be to explain the text by the text itself. By constant comparison of similar and related subjects or passages one should try to obtain insight in the content of the whole work and in the ideas which prompted the author to write as he wrote. Not until then external evidence, i.e., parallel texts from others and sources, if any, can be brought in. 1) The articles of Vega are of no importance in the question discussed."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"IO INTRODUCTION This method may appear to be obvious. Yet to emphasize it is not useless or superfluous. That what in theory is accepted by everyone seems often forgotten in practice, at least in the case of such authors as Calcidius. He is looked upon as a second-rate thinker and, consequently, incapable of notable achievement. Authors have discussed separate texts and looked for parallel passages, but no one has seriously attempted to understand his work as a whole. This attitude is very typical of an author such as Switalski, who never gives a comprehensive survey of Calcidius' point of view. The latter is, in a sense, oppressed by what Switalski believed are his sources. He only comes to the fore when this cannot be avoided; then we read: \"Dern Christen Chalcidius gehort ... \". Switalski leaves it open that several such passages may have been inserted by the author himself, but the question as to the capacities which allowed him to do so is not raised. And yet this is important indeed, for if it appears that these genuine Calcidian elements fit well into the whole, the further question arises whether there are any other passages due to the same. It might theri appear that one has no right to speak of 'insertions', but the duty to see between the sources an author whose work reveals a character of its own. This hypothesis is still in flagrant contradiction with the current theory. Yet it seems more logical to start from this assumption rather than to adhere to the custom-ary opinion which fails to take Calcidius seriously. SURVEY OF THE COMMENTARY AS SUCH Although the last chapter of Calcidius' commentary alone is the real object of the present study, it is imperative to obtain a clear vision on the whole work. And for three reasons: first, because of the particular position of De silva; secondly, because of Calcidius' method of writing, and, thirdly, because of the necessity to prepare a background against which certain quotations from other parts should be seen. The Introduction-Calcidius begins his commentary with an in-troduction deserving close attention. Here more than anywhere else the author is speaking himself. The paraphrase of the text 1) runs as follows: 1) An abbreviation, e.g. 345, 2 refers to the Calcidius edition by Wrobel, page 345, line 2. Any figure preceded by the symbol p. refers to the present study."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION II \"The Timaeus was looked upon as a difficult book also by the Ancients, not because it was not well written (non ex imbecillitate sermonis obswritaie nata), for who is more skilful in writing than Plato? No, the cause lies in the readers, who have not mastered thE' art displayed by Plato, the art namely of treating all questions with appropriate arguments. In a question of stars, he takes his argument!: from astronomy; in a question of music, his arguments are from the doctrine of music. In this way he finds the appropriate remedy to every intellectual ailment, as a doctor applies different remedies according to the nature of the wound 1) (par. 1). Since the Timaeus discusses the universe and Plato wishes to account for all that is in it, a great many questions are bound to crop up, e.g., about plane and three-dimensional figures; how the soul enters the world's body (de incorporatione animae) and animates it, etc. All these problems had to be treated with appro-priate 'remedies'. That is why many people failed to understand this work of Plato; others, experts on a special subject only discussed what was clear to them; the largest part remained obscure (par. 2). It is evident that this dialogue was almost exclusively written for those versed in all sciences. These men ought to have let their light shine upon the others but, prompted by some deplorable kind of jealousy, they failed to communicate their wealth (par. 3). Since I had to oblige you, although the task is beyond my humb-le powers 2}, I was not satisfied with a simple translation. I thought that without further comment the presentation of an obscure original would be as vague as or even vaguer than this original 3). I have explained the difficulties where they occurred on the under-standing that I have only explained such difficulties which could arise from the reader's ignorance of special sciences. In fact, it would have been insulting to the reader to explain what everyone 1) Calcidius uses this metaphor frequently. Remedium to him is 'argument' or 'solution' (70, 20; 82, 14; 88, 13; 131, 8; 213, 6; 301, 10; 359, 19).

The day before Socrates had discussed the State in ten books. In point of fact, the starting-point of the discussion had not been the State but Justice. In order to describe this virtue Socrates had given a picture of a state governed by just laws and of another deviating from such laws (par. 5). After having looked for and found in these books justice in human relations, an investigation had still to be made into natural justice (aequitas naturalis). This task was appointed by Socrates to Timaeus, Critias and Hermocrates. There is therefore in this book no question of positive justice but of natural justice (non positivae sed naturalis iustitiae atque aequitatis), which, although not written itself, is a foundation of laws to be made and directions to be given 1). And as Socrates, when speaking about justice among men, used the example of the civil state, so Timaeus of Locri, a pupil of Pytha-goras 2) and well-versed in astronomy, wanted to inquire into justice as observed among the gods in this-what we may call-common city or state of the sensible world (par. 6) \". Having thus explained the ratio totius operis and the propositum scriptoris, Calcidius now gives the ordinatio libri. It should be borne in mind that this means the disposition of the Timaeus rather than of Calcidius' commentary. In paragraph 7 Calcidius lists the twenty-seven subjects he is going to discuss. Actually, as the commentary has come down to us, only the first thirteen are discussed. These are: De genitura mundi 3) 11 De ortu animae iii De modulatione sive harmonia 1v De numeris v De stellis ratis et errantibus, in quarum numero sol etiam con-stituitur et luna 1 ) tribuit . . . substantiam ; this expression is often used by Calcidius.

In paragraph 4 Calcidius mentions how he generously carried out the commission (by Ossius). Apparently the order to this work did not stretch beyond translation. In the prologue Calcidius says something more about this. He emphasizes that his patron and friend had wanted to do the work himself (eiusque usum a Graecis Latio mutuandum statueras), but had afterwards entrusted his alter ego with it propter admirabilem verecundiam 1). \"And\", Cal-cidius states, \"I could not refuse this request, however difficult the task\". The similarity between the introduction to the commentary and the prologue to the whole work (i.e., translation and com-mentary) is obvious. Both are from a person who pretends to have produced something all his own, and not without difficulties. Calcidius also alludes to former commentators. Here he asks for our utmost attention, for they might be his authorities. What does he say? There are comments on several parts of the Timaeus, but no interpretation of the whole exists. People who could have made one, neglected to do so out of some kind of jealousy. Now what did Calcidius about this? For some subject he was able to refer to extant commentaries-at once we think of the part derived from Adrastus-but he himself had to see to the whole set up. Such is the impression we receive from his own words. Once again: Calcidius does not say that he used sources; from his words we can only conclude to a possibility of use. But the impression that he actually used them can only be confirmed by detailed study of the whole commentary. The last point to be discussed is the ordinatio libri. Calcidius intends to give the order of the Timaeus. In fact, he gives a list I) Ossius of Cordova is said to have been this patron. Cp. de Clercq, o.c., p. 70-71."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"14 INTRODUCTION of twenty-seven subject-matters treated in that dialogue, but there is no apparent order. The list could be the result of cursory reading on the dialogue and the noting down of striking subjects; some of which might be titles from works by others about the res-pective parts of the Timaeus. However, this does not mean that the lay-out of Plato's work escaped Calcidius. The latter must have had a clear insight into its structure. Therefore, a second order is found in the commentary, based upon the structure of Plato's dialogue. This is Calcidius' real order. Only in this light become two remarkable facts understandable: 1) Calcidius treats only thirteen chapters of the twenty-seven announced. His commentary breaks off, because he has reached an important caesura in the dialogue. Before he continues his comment, he wishes to know if it pleased his patron. In the prologue he explicitly declares so (4, 19-23). 2) The thirteenth and last chapter, Desilva, lends itself to a separate treatment. The subsequent analysis of the commentary throws light on its peculiar place. The commentary-The Timaeus begins with a summary of an earlier conversation, the subject of which corresponds to that of the Republic. Then Socrates expressed the wish to see the ideal state operating before his eyes. Subsequently, Critias tells the story, said to have been heard by Solon in Egypt, of Athens' far-off days when it had been an example of the ideal state. But before Critias gives an outline of this state, Timaeus is allowed to recount the origin of the world and of man (Tim. 17A-27B). As he had announced before, Calcidius passes over this simplex narratio ... et historiae veteris recensitio; nor does he comment upon the first part of Timaeus' account, probably because it is one of the things quae communi omnium intellegentiae paterent (71, 16). The commen-tary begins at the moment where Timaeus opens his discourse on proportion (Tim. 31C). Undoubtedly this subject is one of the artes incognitae which Calcidius thinks he should explain. Henceforth he adheres to Plato's text almost without a break up to 53C. This, no doubt, most important treatise of the argument of the Timaeus is divided into two principal parts, the division being in 47E where Plato says: \"In the previous discussion the operation of the vouc; has been brought to light; now the part of <ivixyxYJ comes up for discussion\". The chapter De silva ( = <ivixyxYJ) thus provides comments on the entire second part of Timaeus' argument, whereas"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 15 the twelve preceding chapters are given to 't'ot 8Loc vou 8e:8l)μ.LoupyYJμevot (47E)1) or, to use the words of Calcidius, chapters i-xii bear upon the things qttae provida mens dei contulerit (299, 9), while chapter xiii is about ea quae necessitas invexit. The first principal part is, in its turn, subdivided into two por-tions. The caesura is found in Tim. 39E. In paragraph 118 he observes: Hactenus de mundi sensilis constitutione tractavit (184, 20). \"Up to this point Plato has spoken about the constitution of the sensile world\", now he passes on to the further equipment of this world: we may add, after the constitutio mundi comes the exornatio mundi. The first part De mundi constitutione may be subdivided into the creation of the corpus m1mdanum and that of the anima mundi. This subdivision is suggested by the opening words of paragraph 26: Hine ad animae mundi tractatum pergens (91, 6), which should be compared with 74, 12: ut doceat mundi corpus perfectum esse. Next follow first a consideration of the structural similarity between the body of the world and the soul of the world under the title De stellis ratis et errantibus, and, secondly, a treatise about the connexion between that soul and body, entitled De caelo, or rather, as Calcidius, imitating Plato, puts it in his text, De mundo 1). Calcidius rightly subdivides again the De exornatione mundi, namely where the Creator ceases to produce creatures himself and leaves this task to the gods of whom He is the Maker and the Father (Tim. 41A). Finally, in paragraph 137 Calcidius says: Hactenus de natura daemonum, deinde de mortalium genere disserit. Thus, Calcidius' commentary corresponds to this scheme: I Quae provida mens dei contulerit 1 De generatione mundi a) De constitutione mundani corporis b) De generatione animae . . . . . c) De convenientia inter animam et corpus d) De animae et corporis coniunctione. 2 De exornatione mundi a) De natura daemonum . . . b) De mortalium genere . . .

The constitutio mundi is to him not a creatio ex nihilo but an arrangement of something already in existence. Calcictius takes this as self-evident and asks how order arose in this body of the world? This question leads him to the problem of proportion, since Plato taught that there is a relation of proportion between the four elements (par. 8-22). A second problem is, how the world can be eternal, how a thing, although made, can be eternal. Calcidius gives three answers: 1) God is the Maker (par. 23), 2) the world contains all matter and thus no cause of destruction can come from outside (par. 24), 3) the world was made after an eternal model (par. 25). The chapter on the generatio animae begins with an explanation of the fact that Plato spoke about the origin of the soul, which he only did to oblige unphilosophical minds-actually the soul is eternal (par. 26). Next Calcidius takes in hand the difficult text concerning the mixture of the soul. Already among the Ancients there was a difference of opinion about the meaning of the terms substantia individua and substantia dividua. The point namely was whether these terms to Plato meant forms and matter or rather the pure soul and the souls of animals and plants. Though Calcidius does not make an explicit statement, from what follows it is clear that he favours the second opinion (par. 54). This is moreover con-firmed by his practice of mentioning his personal opinion at the end (par. 27 31). The mixing of the soul is followed by its division. In connexion with the latter Calcidius discusses three questions in the five sub-sequent paragraphs; one of these questions is, of course, why the soul is divided into seven parts. His first argument is based on authority: septem numerus laudatur a Pythagoreis ut optimus et naturalissimus et sufficientissimus (100, 6-8). With it he connects some reflections on the number seven (par. 36-37). In connexion with the following text of Plato (Tim. 36A-B) Calcidius speaks of harmony and numbers (par. 40-50). The reason for treating this subject is explained at the end of this section: lste enim Timaeus, qui in hoe libro tractat, ex Pythagorae magisterio fuit, quem rationa-biliter inducit Plato domesticis et familiaribus sibi probationibus utentem docere animae naturam congruere numeris, concinere etiam modulaminibus musicae (n9, 3-7). Then Calcidius takes up the question about the real meaning of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION this mixture and division. Why this intricate construction? And first of all, why this mixture of substantia individua and dividua? The answer is: because they are the fundamental principles of things. Considering that the soul must know everything and that, according to the Pythagorean theory, knowledge is only possible when there is equality 1), the soul must be composed of all funda-mental principles. This is why, as Calcidius asserts (121, 8), the nature of the soul consists of numbers, which are the principles of things. The considerations of Timaeus on the division of the soul derive their meaning from this identity of soul and numbers. Calcidius summarizes his ideas and in confirmation quotes eminens quaedam doctrina sectae sanctioris (par. 55) 2). Finally, a summary of the whole treatise on the anima mundi follows: Ac de anima quidem mu,ndi ex duabus essentiis eiusdemque et item diversae naturae concre-tione con/lata, deque divisione eius iuxta rationem harmonicam, arithmeticam, geometricam /acta, quove modo natura eius niimeris sonisque conveniat satis dictum est (123, 1-5). The relationship between body and soul is discussed in two further chapters. The agreement between them as regards their division (quemadmoditm animae sectio sectioni caelestium membrorum in/lexionique conveniat circulornm) is entitled De stellis ratis et errantibus; their union, De caelo. In this part Calcidius also speaks about Plato's famous chapter on time and eternity (Tim. 37D ss.). The structure of the section De generatione mundi may be sum-marized as follows. -The spaced titles are those of Calcidius himself (cp. above p. 12). 1.

There we relied upon a contemplation of nature and upon the special sciences. And, in so far as our modest talents permitted, we let ourselves be guided by the doctrines of Plato\" 1). Then Calcidius returns to the text of Plato, who goes on to discuss the further elaboration of the world. The Godhead, he says, wanted to make the world as similar as possible to the Being which really is. In the same way as this Being contains four forms, there should be four kinds of living beings in the universe: 1) the heavenly race of the gods (\"\"' fire) and the earthly beings, subdivided into 2) the flying (,_, air), 3) the swimming (\"\"' water), 4) the living on earth (\"\"' earth) 2). Plato first discusses the immortal ones among them, the fixed stars and the earth. These are the living beings which God made Himself. By way of an appendix, he also mentions the 1) Mundi totius perfectionem ab opifice absolutam deo praeteriti operis textu secrevimus Platonicis dogmatibus, quoad mediocritas ingenii passa est, inhaerentes iuxta naturae contemplationem artificiosasque rationes (184, 22-185, 1 ). Both the mediocritas ingenii and the rationes artificiosae recall the introduction (par. 1 and 4). 2) From this it is clear that Plato thought the four forms or elements also to be present in the world of ideas. Cp. ad par. 272 (p. 43)."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 19 other divine beings: the gods of mythology and of popular belief. To the word ~cxlμove:c; which he uses Calcidius reacts in this manner: \"Plato does not confine himself to an argument about the living beings mentioned but also tries to explain the nature of angels, whom he calls daemones\" (185, 17-19). The purest of them live in the ether, the others in the air and water. For it is unreasonable to assume that one of these elements should remain deprived of rational beings. But Plato does not pursue this question, because it is a matter ultra naturae contemplationem. By these last words Calcidius intends to say that the problem is beyond the scope of the Timaeus, the subject of which is nature. Still, this did not prevent him from subjecting these daemones to further enquiry, once he had discussed Plato's text about the fixed stars and the earth (par. 127-136). He calls this enquiry an inquisitio primariae supervectaeque contemplationis, quae adpellatur epoptica, altior ali-quanto quam physica (191, 13-15), thus explaining more precisely the previous and vaguer expression ultra naturae contemplati-onem 1). The treatise on the daemones is remarkable. Calcidius refers to Plato's 'Philosophus', i.e. the Epinomis (par. 128) 2). According to this dialogue, he states, there are five regions in the universe: the highest is fire, next follows ether, also fire but a little coarser; then come sky, water and earth (par. 129). Since both the region of fire and the earth are populated with rational beings (gods and men), there should be the same in the three intermediate regions. In ether live creatures called by the Jews 'holy angels'. They take up an intermediate position between God and men 3). The angels carry men's prayers to God and they make God's will known to man; this is why they were called 'angels' (ixne:AoL, messengers). Greece, Latium and omnis Barbaria attest to this benefice, for man stands in need of their support (par. 132). Calcidius speaks about good and bad angels and the place where they belong (par. 133-135). Finally, he attacks the theory that angels are souls released from 1) About this contemplatio epoptica he also speaks in par. 272 (303, 11). See there. 2) Cp. E. des Places, S.J., in his introduction to the edition of theEpinomis. Paris, 1956, p. 93-94. 3) Here too we find the idea of proportion: Ut enim deus iuxta angelum, sic angelus iuxta hominem (195, 14-15)."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"20 INTRODUCTION their bodies. In his opinion, this is not m accordance with the doctrine of Plato (par. 136) 1). From the immortal creatures Plato passes over to the mortal ones, especially man. The Godhead first made the soul of man from the same, though less pure, mixture of which the world-soul was made. To prevent these souls from being also immortal,-they would be, if the Godhead had made them Himself-He ordered the created gods to finish His work. Before doing so He placed every soul on a star where he taught it the 'laws of fate'. These laws lead Calcidius to a lengthy discussion of which the principal theme is the relation between Providence and fate (par. 142-190). Only after this praeparatio animae humanae, the children of the Godhead appear on the scene to perform their duty. From the Father they borrow the four elements in order to form the body. Combining them, they provide it with the 'cycles of the soul'. In this way man is made. Hence the title of the eighth chapter is De ortu generis humani. Plato shows how at first there was disorder in this new creature; the supremacy of the rational soul was achieved slowly and with difficulty. Commenting upon these texts, Calcidius dedicates a special chapter to the question of the difference between the in-telligence of one man and another, the answer being that the supremacy of the soul is stronger in one than in another. Paragraph 212 is a summary of this section. So far Plato discussed the constitutio totius hominis, man as a whole; now he is going to consider him membratim. In the same way in which he first spoke about the world as a whole (totius mundi perfectio, 184, 22) and then about its parts, he then examined the members of the human body in particular, inquiring into their use. He also touched upon the causes of sight and hearing, the use of the senses and of their organs. Memory, dreams, visions, etc., are not overlooked. Thus Calcidius' summary. The first object of study is the head. Plato asserted that it is the 1) This passage about daemones strongly reminds us of Philo (Cp. H. A. Wolfson, Philo, Cambridge (Mass.), 1948, Vol. I, p. 366 ss.), who also seems to follow the Epinomis in mentioning this special succession of the five regions (ether after fire) and in attributing definite functions to angels. The Jewish or Jewish-Christian element in this text is evident at first sight. It may have become known to Calcidius through the intermediary of an author such as N umenius (as in par. 55; cp. ad par. 295)."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION 21 chief seat of the soul. The statement is the occasion for a broad digression. This question, however, is difficult to answer before the answer is given to another one. What exactly is the soul? The answers differ widely. There are those who follow some kind of atomic theory (qui dividuam fore silvae substantiam ... , 251, 21). They do not, of course, give a definite place to the soul, for in their opinion there is only oni> spiritu,s penetrating everything (par. 214-217). On the other hand, there are who think the matter of things to be something continuous (Qui iugem putant esse s-ilvam et adunatione quadam sibi continuatam, 254, 8-9)1 ). Of these Emped-ocles located the soul in the blood and consequently, in the heart (par. 218). Some Jewish texts seem to agree with him, e.g., clamat apud me sanguis ftafr£s tui (Gen. 4.10). Calci<lius observes that this is correct, if it is understood as relating tu the animal soul alone, for blood is the vehir:ulu,m inrationabilis an£mae. But all this has no conne.xion with thP rational soul (par. 219) 2). The Stoics regard the heart as the seat of tht soul but on different grounds (par. 220 ). Then there is the theory of Aristotle ac:cording to whom the soul is the prima perf ertio corporis naturalis organici possibilitate vitam habentis (258, 1-2). This theory is more fully discussed by Calcidius. Aristotle, he observes, helieves the soul to be present in every part of the body, hut its centre is in penetralibus cordis, in the heart (par. 224). Both points in this doctrine are rejected by Calcidius. If the <;oul is the forma corporis, it is something accid-ental, a thing which appears and disappears. This is not what Plato thinks the soul to be, viz., substantia carens · corpore semetipsam movens rationabilis (par. 225-229). rt is true that the soul is present in all parts of the body, but its chief functions are thinking and wishing. The former is the most important, so that the corresponding part of the body, the head, should also be its most important part (par. 230). It is the seat of the senses which are tamquam comites rationis (par. 231). The head is round, because it has been formed after the image of the spherical world. Second in dignity is the heart, the centre not of the living creature as a rational being, but merely of the living being.-A de-scription of the structural similarity between man and the world 1) In par. 275 Calcidius is using the same division. 2) For the history of this theory cp. F. Rusche, Blut, Leben und Seele, Paderbom, 1930. The theory was also held by Philo, see there p. 394.

In imitation of Plato Calcidius now discusses sight. Naturally, this offers an occasion for a historical survey. A following chapter, De imaginibus, discusses dreams (par. 249-256) 2) and images seen in a mirror (par. 257-259). This is followed by the interpretation of Tim. 46C-E, in which Plato argued that the senses are not self-sufficient but require a higher power, the soul, of which they are the instruments. Finally, there is a chapter on the advantage of sight and hearing. Sense-perception is explained in accordance with Plato's statements on this subject. This second part may be summarized thus: 2.

This enables him to discuss the principles, in particular the one principle found by the Demiurge when he started his harmonizing activity, namely matter. The reason for this peculiar arrangement of the subject-matter is to be found in the fact that Plato only now comes to an explicit discussion of the substructure of his system. Therefore, Calcidius' lengthy chapter on matter is actually more than a treatment of one of the two principal subjects (cp. the diagram on p. 15).

Paraphrase of Tim. 49A-53C . . . . . par. 275-320 . par. 321-354 A further paragraph (355) forms the link with the following part which, although announced in the prologue (p. 4, 19), is totally unknown. On close consideration, however, it becomes clear that Calcidius' division is not based on external grounds alone. Plato's text remains the foundation of the lay-out, as indeed the entire work is based upon the Timae11s. In Tim. 49A Plato passes from an introductory consideration of the subject of matter to the real treatment of the question. Likewise Calcidius' paragraphs 268-274 are an introduct-ory essay and a first outline of his treatise on matter. They are followed by both historical and systematic parts, in which the author describes first the evolution of the philosophical doctrine and then his own opinion. The third part verifies his theory on the basis of the further texts of Plato. Thus, what at first sight seems to be rather unsystematic, assumes the form of a well-founded treatment. The above scheme, therefore, can also be worded thus: 1. Introductory paraphrase of Tim. 47E-49A . par. 268-274 2. Historical and systematic treatise . . . . . . . par. 275-320 3. Verifying paraphrase of Tim. 49A-53C. . . . . par. 321-354 Insight into this structure of Calcidius' treatise on matter is, obviously, of the greatest importance. It, at once, explains why Calcidius approaches the same problem sometimes two or even three times. The design of the treatise makes this necessary: central problems had to be treated in the introduction as well as in the systematic and the verifying parts. Needless to repeat that"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER 25 a composition of this kind urgently requires the application of the maxim mentioned before, viz., that a work should be explained by the work itself. Further analysis -I. In the first section, the introductory paraphrase, Calcidius gives a preliminary explanation of matter itself (par. 268) and its relation to Providence (par. 269-270). An explanatory list of some names given by Plato to matter (par. 271) follows next. Plato's mentioning that philosophers before him considered fire, water, earth and air to be principles-which they are definitely not-gives Calcidius the opportunity for explaining briefly the real nature of these principles, meanwhile paying special attention to forms (par. 272). After paraphrasing Plato's invocation of the Godhead he asserts with the master that alongside the (two-fold) species a third principle should be accepted. And after stating this, he again affirms that this principle is very difficult to grasp (par. 274). 2. The difficulty of understanding the real nature of matter gave rise to the most variegated opinions. In his historical and systematic treatise Calcidius first gives a survey of these different opinions (par. 275), and than elaborates this paragraph historically (par. 276-301). Those who consider matter as generated, such as the Jews (par. 276-278), are opposed by those who flatly deny this (par. 279-301). These opponents are, again, distinguished into two groups. There are who regard matter as consisting of particles (par. 279), while others think it to be a continuum (par. 280-301). The latter are again divided into thinkers who ascribe certain qualities to matter, for example Thales, Anaximenes, etc. (par. 280-282); the rest consider it to be entirely without qualities: Aristotle (par. 283-288), the Stoics (par. 289-294), Pythagoras (par. 295-299). In two subsequent paragraphs Calcidius mentions two different interpretations of Plato. They constitute a kind of transition to the systematic section, which follows. This second section opens with the question which of these two interpretations is the correct one. In answering it, Calcidius begins, as it were, ab ovo in order to find the underlying principles. There are, he states, two ways of reasoning, syllogismus and resolutio (par. 302). By means of the resolutio he traces matter (par. 303); by means of what he now calls compositio he finds the Maker and the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER model (par. 304). In order to discover afterwards whether he has really to do with principles, he examines which qualities they should have. Hence a short treatise 'On the qualities of principles' leads to the conclusion that these should be simple, without quality and eternal (par. 305-306). After pointing out that fire, earth, etc., do not answer to these requirements, he lays down, by meam of a remarkable argument, that the principles are threefold: deus, silva, exemplum (par. 307). Now at last Calcidius ventures upon his treatise on matter: Nunc iam de silva tractabitur. It is at this point that Calcidius' own treatise on matter really begins. First Calcidius speaks about the names which matter has in Plato, its variability (par. 308-309) and its lack of qualities (par. 3ro). Next he defines his position towards the Stoa. What exactly the Stoics think about matter (par. 311); whether it is limited or infinite (par. 312); whether it can increase or diminish (par. 313), expand or shrink (par. 314), whether it is divisible (par. 315). After treating all these questions he says: \"So our opinion that matter is not water, earth, etc., but a materia principalis, etc., is correct\" (par. 316). By means of analysis of the process of change Calcidius now proves that there is such a substratum (par. 317-318). Finally, he wonders whether matter is a corpus or something incorporeum and the conclusion is that it is neither (par. 319-320). 3. With a verifying paraphrase Calcidius continues the text of the Timaeus. Since he is bound to the latter, no straight line of thought and explanation is to be expected. Matter is without form and quality and, moreover, without motion. That, in spite of this, it appears to be liable to change is due to an other principle, viz., the species. For the moment Plato does not enter into this question; he only affirms that the three principles may be compared to father, mother and child (par. 320-330). Calcidius, in his turn, after dis-cussing why matter is without any quality and how it is related to the ten categories (par. 331-336), speaks about the species. They are the forms and their images. Do these forms exist ? What is their relation to quality and form? From Plato's text about insight and opinion, he concludes that there is an eternal species. Finally, he speaks about the species secunda, the form of things (par. 337-343). These two kinds of species explained, Calcidius, following Plato, returns to matter which, in the passage under discussion (52B),"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER 27 is called x_wpot by Plato. After pointing out the particular difficulty of conceiving it, Calcidius discusses the text in which this act of cognition is described by the Greek philosopher. Then he observes that, in spite of the difficulties, matter has such an influence on human knowledge that we cannot imagine anything without it-it is due to the influence of matter that we have no eye for intelligible reality (par. 344-349). Finally, like Plato, he repeats his opinion of the silva. He clearly explains how he imagines the course of events 'in the beginning', and finishes at the point where divine Providence begins its work (par. 350-354). This survey plainly shows that the De silva is, indeed, the funda-mental treatise of the whole commentary. The principles of things are discussed in each of the three parts. In the systematic section there is even a special portion 'On the principles'. One is again struck by the fact that Calcidius winds up with refering to Provi-dence.

INTRODUCTORY PARAPHRASE a) Outline of the treatise [268] Next Plato states: \"Since, apart from a few exceptions, we have considered all that the insight of the provident spirit ha£ wrought, we have now to speak of the role of necessity\". Plato who wants to explain the whole of the sensible world, rightly states that he has dealt with almost everything wrought by the provident spirit of God, making, as he did, the sensible world after the image and semblance of the intelligible world. What remains to be discussed is the role of necessity, for the world seems to be compo5ed of two factors : Providence and necessity. By the term 'necessity' Plato indicates the UA'YJ, that we in Latin can call silva. It is out of this that the universe came into being. It is a patient nature, because it is the primary substratum of all corporeal (i.e. material) things, in which quality, quantity and all further accidents show themselves. Though it never recedes from its own being, it is liable to change in so far as it assumes different and even opposite forms. Plato wished to give an explanation for this (silva), but he first explains why he could not omit this subject.

PROVIDA MENS DEI In these words Calcidius repeats the expression providae mentis intellectus in the translated text of Plato on which he is commenting. There is, of course, a difference between the two expressions which is well qualified by the words applied by Thevenaz to Plutarch's doctrine of the world-soul, viz., a \"mythologie fabridi.trice du Timee, qui est devenue la theologie du Dieu createur\" (L' Ame du M onde, le Devenir et la Matiere chez Plutarque, Inaugural diss., Neuchatel, 1938, p. 105). The fact that Calcidius can and does use these two different modes of expression indiscriminately is consequent upon his concept of Providence, formulated in his treatise on fate, in this way: Principio cuncta quae sunt et ipsum mundum contineri regique principaliter quidem a summo deo, qui est summum bonum, ultra omnem substantiam omnemque naturam existimatione intellec-tuque melior, quem cuncta expetunt, cum ipse sit plenae perfectionis"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"30 THE TREATISE ON MATTER et nullius societatis indiguus ...

Est igitur mens dei de intellegendo aeternus actus. (par. 176. As a third divine reality he also mentions fatum taken in the sense of the world-soul (anima mundi tripartita). He also calls this mens secunda as distinguished from the mens dei which is providentia. Calcidius again summarizes his theory in paragraph 188: Originem quidem rerum, ex qua ceteris omnibus quae sunt substantia subministratur, esse summum et inef f abilem deum. Post quem providentiam eius secundum deum, latorem legis utriusque vitae tam aeternae quam temporariae. T ertiam porro esse substantiam, quae secunda mens intellectusque dicitur, quasi quaedam custos legis aeter-nae. And he concludes: Ergo summus deus iubet, secundus ordinat, tertius intimat). Whenever Calcidius speaks of mens dei or mens provida dei, his concept of Providence should be borne in mind. It is generally known that the concept of Providence was fully elaborated by the Stoics. There is, however, no need to think of a direct influence of the Stoa on Calcidius; from what follows it will be evident that one should think rather of Numenius. Numenius, like Calcidius, distinguished three phases in the Godhead. AD EXEMPLUM ET SIMILITUDINEM INTELLEGIBILIS MUNDI Pre-sently the world of ideas is mentioned, though only in passing. According to Wolfson (Philo, Cambridge, 1948, Vol. I, p. 291), Philo was the first to use the expression x6aμ.oc; vo1j't'6c; of which mundus intellegibilis is clearly the translation. Plato used the term ~cjlov vo1j't'6v. This is noteworthy in an author who, also elsewhere, seems to have been influenced-directly or indirectly-by Philo. (See the general survey and par. 276-278.) Further the expression ad exemplum et similitudinem is worthy of notice too. It is one of the frequent duplicates in Calcidius, as, for instance, 345, 10 the similar gem1:natio: imagines et simulacra. To quote one more in-stance; for 'origin' we find origo et arx (91, 20), auctoritas et origo (91, 17-18), pontificium et auctoritas {91, 22-23), exordium et /ons"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 268 31 (94, 5), Miginem et causam (123, 14). Calcidius is obviously very fond of such phrases which, moreover, often afford a rhythmical clausula. NECESSITATEM NUNC ADPELLAT HYLEN The identification of Aristotle's ,:,\"1l with Plato's &.vocyx1} or :x.wpix has been generally accepted ever since the age of Aristotle. Sometimes one gets the impression that ,'.,\"1l is a Platonic term (304, 6; 336, ro, see p. 145). The use of the term silva throughout the present treatise is a clear proof of the profound influence of Aristotle. QUAM NOS LATINE SILVAM POSSUMUS NOMINARE In par. 273 (304, 4-5) Calcidius says: quamque i1tniores hylen, nos silvam vocamus; in par. 123 (188, II-12): Chaos, quam Graeci hyten, nos silvam vocamus. The question should be raised whether Calcidius introduced the term silva himself. Nothing can be concluded from the pronoun nos; this may mean nos Latini (as is actually given by some of the manuscripts), in which case, as in par. 123, the Latini are opposed to the Greeks. However, possumus may be regarded as containing a hint of personal authorship. At any rate, no earlier use of the term silva for 'matter' is known. Isidorus of Sevilla, Calcidius' compa-triot, wrote the noteworthy wor<ls: H anc ,'.,),1jv Latini materiam appellant, ideo quia omne in/orme, unde aliquid /aciendum est, semper materia nunrnpatur. Proinde et eam poetae silvam nomina-verunt (Etymologiae XIII 3, 1). Finally, it should be remembered that, according to Gilson (La Philosophie au M oyen-Age, Paris, 1952, p. II8), medieval authors used the term silva in consequence of Calcidius. EADEMQUE PATIBILIS NATURA It seems that, under influence of the Greek original, a second relative clause is avoided here. One should, of course, understand quaeque est patibilis natura. For patibilis natura compare Aristotle, De gen. et corr. 324 b 18: ~ ~£ {,A1j TI {,A1j 1t1X6'Y)TLKOV SUBIECTA CORPORI PRINCIPALITER These words, too, strike us as i\\ristotelian; Phys. 192 a 31: Myw ycxp ,'.,\"1JV TO 1tpwTov u1toxdμevov hocaT<p. Elsewhere Calcidius says: materiam principalem et corporis primam subiectionem (340, 13-14). However, Calcidius may have derived this phrase from Aristotle as a variant to Plato's 7t<X(J1)t; yevfoewi; u1to~o:x.~ (Tim. 49A). IN QUA Cp. 306, 1-2. Whereas just above matter was said to be that out of which (ex qua) the world was made, it is now introduced as that in which (in qua), as within some space, the qualities occur. The latter version is more Platonic. According to Plato, the world is formed by merging of form into matter. The former suits better"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"32 THE TREATISE ON MATTER Aristotle, according to whom the world is moulded out of matter and form.

Calcidius is formulating this idea repeatedly: 337, 19; 343, 19-20; 351, 9-10 (where he translates the very text of the Timaeus), and 374, 17. Illustrative of the difference between the Platonic and Aristotelic views is the following text of Simplicius, In Phys. 320, 21 ss.

DIVERSIS TAMEN Matter remains what it is, but it assumes dif-ferent forms in the same way as gold remains gold though it is founded in diverse forms (cp. Tim. 50C and Albinus, Epit. VIII 2: l8t6-r1J\"t'IX 8' tx.eLv ... μ1)8& 7tOLO't'1)'t'1X). This short opening paragraph of the De silva is heavy-laden. In a few words Calcidius gives the principal characteristics of matter. At first sight the Aric;totelian doctrine preponderates: the terms and expressions silva, patibilis, subiecta corpori principa-liter, ex qua. On reconsideration, however, the Platonic character proves, at least, to be equally strong, especially in the intrinsic immutability ascribed to the silva: Evidently Calcidius wanted to associate himself closely with Plato. The expressions which, to us, sound purely Aristotelian, were, to him, in perfect agreement with Plato (cp. p. 76). That Calcidius calls matter patibilis is important for the question whether he depends upon Plotinus, for the latter definitely asserts that matter is cx.1tocO~i; (Enn. III 6, 9). Furthermore, this qualifica-tion is also remarkable within the scope of the ideas of Calcidius himself, for how can matter be called patibilis, if it is intrinsically immutable? This problem must be dealt with at some length later"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 269 33 on (cp. par. 309). Henceforth Calcidius asserts the mutability of matter with great emphasis, but elsewhere he will also call it impetibilis, an expression which can be understood in the light of what has just been said. However, the most important thing to be noted is this: Calcidius' explicit assertion of the passibilitas of matter makes it highly improbable that he is dependent upon Plotinus. b) Relation between matter and Providence [269] Finally Plato adds: \"For the generation of the sensible world was of a mixed nature and was caused by cooperation of necessity and mind\". Therefore, since he discusses the generation of the world and has to do this thoroughly, he is bound to discuss the two factors contributing to it. And with this, the necessity of a treatise on matter becomes obvious. Plato speaks about a 'mixed' generation, because the two elements are of a different nature; he speaks rightly of a 'generation' from necessity and Providence, for the world has not its origin in a mechanical mix-ture of these two, as might be supposed from the term 'mixture'. On the contrary, the world came into being through both plan-ning of a provident spirit and factors of necessity. In this way Providence was the active agent, whereas matter underwent its action and let itself be 'adorned' willingly. The divine spirit moulds it in such a manner that it is entirely pervaded by it, not as forms are conferred in sculpture, where only the surface is operated upon, but rather in the manner in which nature and the soul pervade and animate solid bodies. MIXTA ••• GENERATIO Meμ&Lyμev'Yj yocp ouv ~ 't'OU8& 't'OU ><6aμou ytv&aLc; &~ ixvocy><'Yjc; 't'& xoct vou CJUCJ't'<Xcr&<.t>c; eyevv~e'Yj (47E-48A). The ideas on which this section hinges are mixta and generatio. At the end of the previous one, Calcidius announced that Plato was going to give the reason why he should speak of matter. Quoting Plato's words, Calcidius concludes: Thus, because this is a generation in which two different principles cooperate, Plato will have to speak of both and, therefore, also of the silva. DE UTROQUE GENERE For the term genus in this connexion, see paragraph 330: genera nunc inproprie adpellans; neque enim silva nee vero exemplum genera sunt, sed ut adpellatio generum significet primas substantias (354, 10-12). MIXTAM VERO GENERATIONEM Calcidius now explains Plato's Philosophia Antigua, VIII 3"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"34 THE TREATISE ON MATTER text. In the words quoted mixtam should be strongly stressed; it points to the fact that there is question of principles of a different nature. (In the same way as we speak of 'mixed feelings', Plato spoke of a 'mixed generation'.) In order to follow the line of thought one should hold on to the idea of generatio. Calcidius: \"and rightly Plato speaks of a generation from necessity and Providence, for we should not, on account of mixtam, think of something mechanic-al\". In other words, Calcidius wants to show that ex cxvixyx'Y)c; -re: x<Xl. vou does not only belong to μ&fl.&LYfLEV'YJ but also to eyevv~61J. Although in this exegesis the text in the manuscripts is explained satisfactorily, the question arises whether there is something missing. The more so, since the words ex necessitate et providentia are no literal quotation. One cannot find fault with the word providentia, for Calcidius may safely exchange it with intellegentia; the dis-turbing element is the absence of the idea 'generation'. This dis-turbing element would not have occurred, had Calcidius quoted Plato's words literally, and coetus had formed the missing link. It seems quite probable that Calcidius wrote it and that the text should be read thus: recteque < ex necessitatis providentiaeque coetu, non> ex necessitate et providentia ... However, the reading of the manuscripts is by no means impossible; in which case the meaning should be: recteque ex necessitate et providentia <Progenitum esse mundum>. One may here also refer to par. 296 (325, 14): Denique ex providentia et necessitate progenitum (sc. mundum) veterum theologorum scitis haberi. This text occurs in the quotation from Numenius. The observation is important, because like elsewhere, Calcidias' terminology shows a great resemblance to that of Numenius. The quotation reads: Sed providentia quidem est dei opus et of ficium, caeca vero fortuitaque temeritas ex prosapia silvae, ut sit evidens iuxta Pythagoran dei silvaeque, item providentiae fortu-naeque coetu citnctae rei molem esse constructam (327, 9-13). Anyhow, whatever reading is preferred, the resemblance between Calcidius and Numenius is striking. Already in the preceding section Cal-cidius spoke the same terms: quando providis necessariisque ratio-nibus mundi universitas constare videatur. This explanation is here repeated. CONSULTIS PROVIDAE MENTIS In the passage trom N umenius one finds moreover: ex providentiae consultis salubribus (32f, 6) and a little further on : et adversatur providentiae consulta eius inpugnare gestiens (sc. necessiias).

Consequently the passage shows unmistakably Stoic features, although it is not necessary to assume a direct influence. Like the Stoic notion of Providence itself, this passage may well have come into the text of Calcidius via Numenius, just as other texts which precede and follow. [270] Next Plato shows the relationship between intellect and necessity when he says: \"while intellect dominates\". There are two kinds of domination; one is violent, like the rule of a tyrant, the other is like the sanctitas of the Emperor. The violent rule does not preserve the subject for a long time but ruin, it, whereas \"wise domination\", as Plato says, \"improves its sub-ject\". In order that the world should be eternal, matter <should not be up against a tyranny which ruins it in the long run. On the contrary, it should be under wise ruling. This it> should obey patiently and without demur; and it should willingly yield to the majesty of the Maker and His wisdom. Therefore Plato adds: \"while, by means of salutary persuasion, the intellect is continuously urging the harshness of necessity to what is best. And since, in this way, necessity let itself be conquered by Providence and listened to its dictates, the first beginnings of things were brought into existence\"<. The idea is here that ne-cessity was deliberately obedient>, because there exists yet another, less deliberate obedience, which is called error or servile docility. And God's work is such that it persuades by strength and imparts persuading strength, which means that persuasion entails strength and strength persuasion. This can be observed in the behaviour of sensible men when they are ill: they let themselves be burnt and cut by physicians."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER INTELLEGENTIAE NECESSITATISQUE CONSORTIUM In what pre-cedes the question was chiefly concerned with the share of in-tellect and of nece~sity, although the relation between these two powers was mentioned. Now Calcidius dwells more fully on this subject. DOMINANTE INTELLECTU vou 8e: cxvocyx'Yjc;; &pxov-roc; (48A). DUPLEX PORRO EST DOMINATIO Calcidius is fond of distinctions, as appears from what follows, e.g., par. 333.

UT IGITUR In the concept of eternity special attePtion is drawn to imperishableness, to being without end. This is clear from the context; in our paraphrase the argument is slightly ex-panded. HencE the approach to the problem is quite different from that iu par. 23-25 where the point at issue is the eternity of the corpus mundanum and 'eternal' has the meanings of 'being without a beginning in time'. Moreover, the question of the eternity of principles (par. 306) has no bearing on the present passage, in which Calcidius simply presupposes the eternity of the world (cp. 207, 16-17). MAIESTATI OPIFICIS The term maiestas re-minds one of the expression sanctitas imperatoria used above. By opi/ex Calcidius indicates the other principle, which he calls deits a little further. More frequently he uses both terms, writing deus opifex.

For the right understanding of Calcidius' trans-lation here it is important to note that the subiect of trahente and dominante is the same (300, 17), viz., inteUectu. In the translation one reads: dominante intellectu et ... trahente (58, 15-59, 1). One is also struck at once by the epitheton salubris to persuasio. Plrto simply writes t<i'.\\ 1te:L6e:Lv. Although Calcidius' style is usually on the florid side, this salubris seems to be more than just a epitheton ornans. For though Calcidius uses this adjective frequently, it also occurs in the passage translated from Numenius, which, moreover,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 270 37 shows a striking resemblance to the present one. There we read: ex providentiae consul#s salubribus (already quoted ad 300, 9). The further wording of this phrase also shows similarity to the passage from Numenius, e.g., providis auctoritatibus, minus consulta parentia, provida parentia. Hence salubris seems to come from Numenius. However, the occurrence of the same word in the trans-lation points to an influence of Numenius rather than to verbal adoption. The expression rigorem necessitatis too is more flowery than Plato's ci.vocyxYi~, but, again, this word is not a mere ornament. As against the morigera and libens found a few lines earlier, it seems to suggest some resistance in matter. This resistance may be com-pared to that of the nature of difference in Tim. 35A: TYJV 6oc-repou qiuaLv Mcrμ&Lx-rov ooaocv Et~ -rocu-rov auvocpμ6nwv ~(~. Calcidius uses here the term vis. Remarkably, Numenius' text reads not only of obeying on the part of matter but also of resisting: consulta eius (sc. providentiae) inpugnare gestiens (327, 8-9). Furthermore, this twofold behaviour is combined in a text, which will appear to be Numenian, viz., 329, 1-4: cum divina sapientia intellegentiaque opificis dei silvae severe atque efficaciter persuaderet praebere cultui atque exornationi suae patientiam. So from the side of the Creator there is persuasion, but combined with severity and even some violence. A certain contradiction exists between these concepts and, curiously enough, the same is met in Calcidius. An explanation of this interesting doctrine will be attempted in due course (p. 120). ERROR ET FACILITAS The explanation of facilitas (also used in the prologue (3, 4)) is obvious: it denotes an objectionable in-dulgence as opposed to the parentia provida. Less clear is error. Perhaps the most obvious solution is to regard the use of these two terms as one more example of geminatio, a figure so obviously favoured by the author (cp. p. 30)-though, of course, facilitas emphasizes the element of will-lessness, error that of disorder-liness. One may also find a hendiadys here: facilitas erroris. UT SIT PROVIDA PARENTIA RATIONE NIXA NECESSITAS This phrase may be translated differently according to whether provida is taken as a nominative, belonging to necessitas or as an ablative, belonging to parentia. In the latter case, ratione nixa is a further explanation of provida parentia. One might even ask whether this is not a marginal note inserted into the text. Anyhow, necessity is here said to be provida, for, even if provida is to be connected with parentia, necessity should be said to possess provida parentia."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER It may be asked whether, in Plato's text, Calcidius has connected fμcppovo<; with cxvocyxlj<;. This does not seem to be the case, since providis auctoritatibus is the evident translation c,f u1to 1teL6ou<; fμcppovo<;. Calcidius clearly calls matter provident, for it is wise enough to obey a wise Maker. Above was said already libens cedat pareatque. For the whole of this text one should, in my opinion, think of Tim. 56C where Plato states that the Godhead \"exactly ordained the movements and other forces where necessity admitted this freely or after persuasion\" (07t7J1tEp ~ rij<; cxvocyxl)<; e:xouooc 7tELa6Ei:aoc TE cpuaL<; U7tE'i:XEV). ET OPUS DEi TALE EST After concentrating upon the activity of the necessitas, Calcidius passes on to a discussion of the other principle which earlier was only hinted at in the words dominante intellectu. He changes the terminology by writing deus instead of intellectus (likewise, in the preceding chapter he wrote provida mens dei besides providae mentis intellectus). God is said to exert \"a compelling persuasion or a persuasive compulsion\" (Calcidius' formulation is hardly more than a pun). The behaviour of matter, when it patiently undergoes the regulating activity of God, is compared to the behaviour of a sensible man who during an illness submits to the painful treatment of a physician. This treatment is described by Calcidius as urere et secare. This combination is found in many places, first of all in the Timaeus itself, 64D and 65B (-roμoct μev xoct XOCUaEL<;; 7tEpL 't'CX<; XOCU!JEL<; xoct -roμoc<;). Simplicius (In Phys. 249, 10 ss.

In Contra Rufinum (III 39; P.L.

De Macrobe a Cassiodore, Paris, 19482, p. 61), shows perhaps the source of this widely used comparison. In a different connexion Seneca wrote (De Bene/. V 20, 2): Multa beneficia tristem frontem et asperam habent, quemad-modum secare et urere. As we have observed, the two preceding sections display a great resemblance in formulation with the passage from Numenius. And it is remarkable indeed that this influence even persists in the translation."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 27r 39 c) Names of matter [271) Plato continues: \"If, therefore, one wants to explain truly and faithfully how the world was brought into existence, one should also set forth what the 'erratic cause' of a thing is\". Matter is here given yet another name, viz., error, on account of its earlier wavering condition; likewise it is called necessity, because matter is not the primary cause of the world, but must necessarily be assumed on the basis of the materiality of things. It is something in the nature of a conditio sine qua non. SI QUIS Et 'C'L<; oov TI yeyovE XOC't'OC 't'OCU't'OC l>v't'Cuc; epe'i:, μELX't'E.OV xoct 't'o -njc; 1tAocveuμ.eV7Jc; d8oc; ocMocc;. ERRORIS NOMINE Just above matter was said to be without error in its relation to the Godhead; here it is actually denoted by the term error: taken by itself it is error, being so propter inordinatam eius antiquam iactationem. Here it is for the first time that the idea of chaos crops up. This notion is particularly prominent in Numenius. In the same context as the Numeniana quoted above we read: ltaque si deus eam (sc. silvam) correxit ... redegitqite in ordinem ex incondita et turbulenta iactatione (327, 2-4); ordinem inordinatae confitsioni ... coniungens (327, 23-24); cp. also 328, 17; 329, r2-r3; and 375, r4-376, r. We touch upon a theory already present in Plato, namely that a confusion of elements existed before the activity of God afterwards brought order. Baumker (o.c., p. r36) discusses the passages from Plato in detail and, following Stallbaum, Martin and others, calls this concept 'secundary matter'. Alongside this concept of chaos or secundary matter, there is yet another, viz., that of empty space, which Baumker calls 'primary matter'. In his opinion Plato denotes the same by these tenns, chaos being a more plastic representation of what elsewhere is called space. One could also say that chaos appeals more to the imagination, whereas space-which found a continuation in the UA'I) of Aristotle-is more abstract. In order to grasp Calcidius' doctrine, it is of primary importance to draw a clear distinction between these two modes of approaching matter. Calcidius, in fact, has a theory of his own on the relation between matter as such ( = x_wpoc = UA'IJ) and chaos. The latter he sees as a second stage of the first (cp. p. 236). In this preface, however, we cannot as yet find anything of this typically Calcidian view. But-as appeared already on the occasion of rigorem necessitatis (301, 3)-there is some inconsistency in the description of the part of matter."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER The ultimate cause of this lies, in my opinion, in Plato's ambiguity. In the present text the aspect of chaos prevails, and the term rigor necessitatis is in the right place. But where matter is said to be morigera and libens maiestati cedens, Calcidius has Plato's xwpoc in mind, or rather the UA'1) of Aristotle. NECESSITATEM In passing Calcidius also gives an explanation of this term. Matter is called necessity, because it is a conditio sine qua non of materiality. The difference between primary cause and conditio sine qua non is also found in Tim. 68E-69A: .:\\Lo 8YJ XPYJ M' otL\"C'Lot~ d:8'1) 8LOpl~i::cr6otL, \"t'O μe:v ixvocyxoc'i:ov, \"t'o 8e: 61::'i:ov, xoct \"t'O μe:v 61::i:ov ev IX7totO'LV ~'1)\"C'l::LV XTIJO'l::(J)~ fvi::xot i::u8oclμovo~ ~LOU, xoc6' OO'OV ~μwv ~ (f>UO'L~ ev8exi::\"C'otL, \"C'O 8e: ixvocyxoc'i:ov exdvwv xocpLV, AoyL~6μi::vov (tl~ IXVl::U \"C'OU\"C'(J)V OU 8uvot\"C'OC otU\"C'OC EXl::LVO( ecp' ot~ crn:ouM~oμe:v μ6voc X.ot\"C'ot-VOl::LV ou8' otU Aot~l::LV ou8' (XAJ\\(J)~ 7t(J)~ μe:\"C'otO'Xl::LV.

In his enumeration of causes existing according to Aristotle, Seneca says: prima, inquit, causa est ipsa materia, sine qua nihil potest elfici (Ep. 65, 4). d) The real forms and their images [ 272] Hence Plato returns upon his steps in order to make a study of the principles, taking as his starting-point the time previous to the generation of the world. He also investigates the nature of pure and unmixed fire, its properties and passions, and not only of fire but also of the other pure and unalloyed elements. For all those who discussed the principles of the uni-verse, proposed these four elements, which, on account of their mutual mixture, received the name of the dominating element. \"But how far and from what the same elements were generated, no one has explained thus far. Still, they spoke of fire, air, earth and water as elements of the sensible world, as if they knew the nature of these things in their purity, though in fact they cannot"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 272 41 even be compared with syllables\". The elements of a word are the letters, the syllables coming in the second place. This is why Plato rightly states that these four elements of the world cannot even be placed on a level to syllables. The first element of the uni-verse is matter, shapeless and without quality. In order to become 'world' matter is moulded by the intelligible forms. And from these two, matter and form, pure and intelligible fire, and the other four sincerae substantiae proceed. From these, again, come forth the materials perceived by our senses, viz., those consisting of fire, water, earth and air. Pure fire and the other pure intellig-ible substances are types of the bodies, called 'ideas'. As for these ideas, for the moment Plato leaves alone the question whether we should assume one common original form for everything or rather innumerable forms according to the number of things constituting the universe. Or perhaps the same is at once one and many, as he taught in the Parmenides. The reason why Plato avoids this question was not so much its dif-ficulty as the wish not to insert a subject which does not belong in the present discussion. It is a disputatio naturalis, the other subject a disputatio epoptica. The former gives a rather uncertain image of truth, which only allows for a certain degree of prob-ability, whereas the latter flows from the source of purest science. FACTO IGITUR RECURSU It is important to realize the meaning of this recursus. In the preceding part of his argument, Calcidius states, Timaeus has spoken of the action of the vouc;;, which is Prov-idence; this action arranged the universe, the creation of order or, in yet other words, the generatio or constitutio mundi. For his starting-point he chose the moment-if it is allowed to use this term-at which Providence began its task of bringing the four elements into their correct relation (cp. 304, 17-18: Tune ergo conpendio principalibus materiis quattuor sumptis exaedificaverat sermone mun-dum). Now Timaeus returns to this point and begins the inquiry into the real status of these elements: are they really original principles as generally assumed, or does there exist something more fundamental? His thoughts are then turned to the pure forms, but the problems connected with them are not developed. Calcidius' words Facto recursu literally occur in his translation (59, 7): they are much closer to Plato's text then appears from Wrobel's text: c':'>8e: o?iv 1t1XALV avixx_wp'1)T£Ov.

As is evident from what has been said so far, the sentence 'the time before the origin of the world' denotes the space of 'time' preceding the moment at which Providence began its work. At the end of this treatise Calcidius again returns at this point. There he speaks of a time ante mundi constitutionem (377, 8) and, as meaning quite the same, ante mundi exornationem (377, 19-20 and 306, 22-23); see at the end ot the tirst chapter (p. 23). QUAERIT QUOQUE The use of quoque is remarkable: it gives the impression that the subsequent question is not connected with the previous one, or, at least, that there is an abrupt transition. For Calcidius this is so. He considers Timaeus' words to bear upon the ideas immediately. This, however, appears to be incorrect, as can be seen from the survey just given. Timaeus asks: \"what is the real status of these elements which are usually taken as real elements?\" Calcidius answers: besides the silva, Plato also discusses naturam ignis sinceri et sine permixtione, quali-tatem quoque corporum ... which is definitely meant as a rendering of Plato's words immediately following the words quoted just now 't\"rjV •.• 1tupoc; u8ex't'6c; 't'E x.ext <Xepoc; x.ext yijc; cpumv 6eex't'EOV /XU't\"rjV x.ext 't'IX 1tpo TouTou 1rix61J (48B). By ignis sincerus Calcidius means the ideal fire, as appears from the rest of this section. OMNES QUIPPE All those who up to now discussed the principles, mistook the fire around us for the pure fire, and so on. In reality this is no pure fire, etc. ; it is a mixture of various elements in which one element preponderates. The mixture gets its name after this element (cp. par. 119, 185, 12-13: quodque corpora ex maiore parte terrena ex obtinentis materiae vocabulo cognominantur). It should also be ob-served that Calcidius denotes the four so-called elements as materiae. He does so in a great many places, e.g., 73, 19; 162, 29-163, 1 (elementis materiisque); 205, 9-10; 243, 3, to mention only some explicit texts. They are, however, also called corpora (302, 14; 303, 1).

QUIA SERMONIS Calcidius is explaining Plato's assertion in which, playing upon the double meaning of GToL:x_ei:ov, viz., 'element' and 'letter', he explains that these so-called elements are not elem-ents (i.e., letters), nor even syllables. The most simple thing,"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 272 43 which really deserves the name 'element', says Calcidius, is matter moulded by the intelligible form. From these two proceed the pure intelligible substances, the ideas, which, therefore, may be put on a level with syllables. Not until then come the materiae sensiles, fire, earth, etc., as we know them. They were formed after the exemplars of the ideas. What is most striking in this passage is that the ideas appear to be composite, viz., of matter and a species intellegibilis. As regards this silva, one shall have to think of the silva intellegibilis of which Calcidius speaks in connexion with the exegesis of Genesis (310, 1). From Aristotle, however, we know already that, under the influence of the doctrine of Pythagoras, Plato assumed a twofold principle in the ideas. To Pythagoras numbers were the deepest essence of things and of them unity and duality were the principles, as we read in Calcidius himself, par. 53: Sic igitur antiquissima numerorum natio esse invenitur omnibus rationibus. I psorum porro numerorum initia et principia sunt singularitas et item duitas, siquidem has duas ceterorum numerorum origines esse constat (121, 14-17). Cal-cidius also mentions the Pythagorean principles in the passage translated from Numenius (par. 295). So, when Plato came to identify his ideas more and more with numbers, he was compelled to assume a double principle in the ideas. In this respect the following remark of Simplicius is interesting (In Phys. 151, 6 D.): Aeyet o 'AM~otvopoc; 6-n \"xot't'IX Ilt.CX't'WVot 7tCXV't'WV CXp)'.otL XotL otU't'WV 't'WV toewv 't'6 't't Iv EO\"t'L XotL ~ cx6ptcr't'oc; oucxc;, ~v μ.eyot XotL μ.txpov i1.e:.ye:.v, we; XotL ev To°Lc; Ile:.pt Tcxyoc6ou 'AptaToTtA'Y)c; !'-V\"l!'-ove:.uet\". (cp. ib., 229, n ss. ad par. 320. Also W. v. d. Wielen, De I dee-getallen van Plato, Amsterdam, 1941, passim). It does not seem difficult to establish the origin of this theory in Calcidius. This combination of Pythago-rean ideas must have been derived from the man from whom he took his long Pythagorean fragment, Numenius. A strong confirm-ation of this is found in the fact that, in this introductory para-phrase, Calcidius again and again expresses himself in an unmis-takably Numenian style. It is also remarkable that Calcidius thinks that the four elements are also present in the world of ideas. He follows in Plato's steps (cp. Tim. 51C (Cale. par. 337) and 39A (see general survey ad par. II9)). There is, moreover, an interesting text of Simplicius asserting that Plato borrowed this theory from Empedocles: In Phys. 31, 18 SS.

Calcidius expresses himself rather curiously, saying: ignis purus ... ceteraeque sincerae substantiae quattuor. As he repeatedly speaks of four elements, we cannot reasonably suppose five elements. The simplest solution is perhaps to understand: \"pure fire and the other pure substances, four in number, viz., together\". QUARUM AD PRAESENS DIFFERT EXAMINATIONEM Here Calcidius continues his paraphrase of Plato's text: 't'~v μe:v 1te:pr. <X7tCXV't'WV e:he: ocpx~v e:he: &px_cx:i; e:he: Cl7tTJ Soxe:L 't'O\\J't'WV 7tEpL 't'O vuv OU pl)'t'EOV (48C). UNANE SIT ARCHETYPA SPECIES ( = e:he: &px_~v) The term archetypa species reminds us of archetypum exemplum (353, 7 and ro). Elsewhere Calcidius speaks of species principalis (e.g., 361, 7; 363, 4-5) as distinct from a species secunda (cp. par. 337-338). The theory that there is only one idea, after which the world is made, is suggested in Albinus, Epit. XII 3: μovoye:v'ij 't'OV x6aμov E7t0L'Y)<JE: XOt!.

AN INNUMERABILES Seneca states that, according to Plato, there are innumerable ideas: innumerabilia haec sunt, sed extra nostrum posita conspectum (Ep. 58, 18), and: Talia ergo exemplaria infinita habet rerum natura (58, 19). Aristotle also touches upon this question in Physics I 9 (192 a 34). AN VERO IDEM UNUM PARITER ET MULTA This seems to be an extension of Plato's e:('t'e: ISr.n Soxe:i. UT DOCUIT IN PARMENIDE The question 'unity-multiplicity' is, indeed, dominant in the Parmenides, to which Calcidius refers in par. 335. QUAE CAUSA DECLINANDI Calcidius again turns to the text of which he gives a short paraphrase. The reason was not the difficulty of the question, but Plato wanted to avoid an insertion which did not fit in here. Why should it be inappropriate to discuss this question here? Because this is a treatise on things of nature, which only give probability. The science of the ideas, on the contrary, provides knowledge of the purest quality.

Connected with this is 195, 23-24: Quem quidem tractatum, quod sit elatior et ultra naturae contemplationem . . . (cp. iuxta naturae contemplationem, 184, 24-185, 1). A similar expression occurs in 175, 8-10: Verum haec disputatio, quia nihil pertinet ad naturalem tractatum, cum sit rationalis, di//eretur. In this last quotation the silva is said not to pertain to a disputatio naturalis but to a disputatio rationalis. This seems to contradict the scope of the present section. Yet from this text it may perhaps be concluded that rationalis means the same as epoptica. This term is obviously a Greek loanword; it seems to have been taken from the mysteries; e1to1t-re:lot is the highest degree of initiation into the Eleusinian mysteries. The application of this term to the knowledge of the most sublime objects of philosophy is clear. Perhaps Calcidius also derived it from Numenius. e) The third principle: matter Invocation of the Deity [273a] Plato says: \"I now invoke God to save us from the rough and tempestuous sea of this explanation\". The author does his utmost to bring us into a pious and reverent mood towards the Godhead, whose help he implores now that he is setting out on the tempestuous sea of the discussion of the nature of the silva, tempestuous on account of the new and uncommon character of the discussion.

Needless to say that, when Wrobel prints these words as a translation, he should have done the same for propter novum ... genus. To depict the discussion concerning the silva Calcidius uses the image of the tempestuous sea. This image is customary for descript-ions of the silva itself, especially the silva as chaos; Porphyry: 7t0V't'O(; oe xocl.

In this connexion the terms turbidus and iactatio are typical (cp. the discussion of par. 271 (p. 39) where the image of chaos is mentioned). [273b-274a] \"Let us, therefore\", says Plato, \"make a fresh start\". Rightly so, for above he had already discussed the two principles, the exemplary and the corporeal, assuming that the sensible world has come forth from these two. <Alongside the primary form there is a corporeal form,> for what comes to be, perishes and does not exist always and truly, is the corporeal form. Now these bodies, (i.e., these bodily, corporeal forms,) cannot exist by themselves, alone and without something which appropriates them. The appropriating subject is now called 'mother' by him, then 'nurse', sometimes 'womb of all coming into being' and also 'place'. The younger Platonists call it ()).lJ, we call it silva. In order to supply what was wanting, he therefore adds the present treatise on matter to that on the principles and says \"a second, more detailed division should be made\". For above two principles were mentioned; one is the intelligible form, shaped in His mind by God, the Maker of the world, which form Plato called idea, the other being its image which is the nature of all things corporeal. When these bodies are considered by themselves, they seem to possess a complete independence, but if we look at their origin, we find that they all, like their 'impulses', lie in the womb of matter. Formerly Plato, for the sake of brevity, had started from the four primary bodies and built the world in this way.

On the other hand, the expression origo corporea might be mis-understood as referring to matter. However the context shows that Calcidius means the species corporeae, the forms which are present in all things and, for the sake of shortness, sometimes called corpora.

Plato one finds a first indication of the theory that the ideas are thoughts of God. We prefer to study this in the comment on par. 339 (p. 210), where the nature of the ideas is fully discussed in a passage taken almost literally from Albinus. In the second addition, viz., quae natura est corporis (above Cal-cidius said species corporea), the Aristotelian influence appears again for a moment. The same mixture of Platonic and Aristotelian elements is found in other authors, such as Galen and Albinus (cp. the comment on par. 337, p. 204). OPIFEX DEUS Cp. above p. 36 (ad 301, 1). PORRO CORPORA Calcidius continues his ar-gument on the subject discussed above, viz., the corpora i.e., the imago, quae natura est corporis, the species corporea. SED SI These words contrast with si per se ipsa spectentur, and originem should be strongly emphasized: \"if one considers the forms in themselves, they do not seem to need anything else tPerfectam ... habere substantiam), but it one pays attention to the fact that they have come to be, one arrives at a different conclusion\". If I am not mistaken, the accusative originem should be regarded as a ren-dering of the words yeveaLv l:x.ov in the corresponding sentence of the Timaeus (48E). It is clear once more that the first part of par. 274 should be read together with par. 273. INVENIES CUNCTA This can be 'found' in the Aristotelian way, i.e., by means of an analysis of change (par. 317-318) or by Plato's method, which leads to the conclusion that the images of the ideas must be received by some-thing (cp. above sine suscipiente essentia esse non possint). By the scatebrae eorum (sc. corporum) Calcidius probably means the tx.VlJ of the elements, about which Plato speaks in Tim. 53B and which he there translates with vestigia.

SILVAE CAPACITATEM Cp. 356, 15; 175, 20-21 and the comment on p. 63 s. f) Intelligibility of matter [274b] It is very difficult to obtain insight into the nature of the silva, but it is even more difficult to explain it to others. The difficulty with principles is that they cannot be explained by means of examples-indeed, there exists nothing that could be used as an example. Nor can they be illustrated by means of anything existing either, since there is nothing which precedes a principle. The only result which one can possibly attain in this case is an obscure and vague notion, which is not of such a nature that one can explain simply what it is. It is, in fact, arrived at in such a way that whatever is proper to separate things is taken away, and only what one tries to understand is left over. In other words, one eliminates all bodies which, in the womb of matter, are formed in a rich variety by transition from one to another. After that, one arrives at an idea of that empty womb itself. DIFFICILE OPUS Calcidius again comes close to Plato's text: vuv 8e o Myor:, EOLXEV e:taocvocyxcx.~e:Lv x.rxJ...e:1tov xoct cx.μu8pov e:l8or:, EmX,e:Lpe:i:v MyoLr:, &μqiocvlaocL (49A). The wording of this idea reminds one strongly of the well-known passage on the knowledge of the Maker and Father of the universe: \"The Maker and Father of the universe is difficult to be found; when He is found, it is impossible to com-municate knowledge about Him to others\" (Tim. 28C). TALIS QUIPPE NATURA EST INITIORUM With principles there can be no question of an example, which is either simpler or earlier, for, by definition, principles are both the tirst and the simplest things. SED OBSCURA QUADAM Praesumptio seems to be a trans-lation of 1tpOA\"rJ<.pLr:,; Calcidius uses the term frequently. From 345, 3-5 it is evident that, to him, it has the general meaning of 'intellect' or 'knowledge'. For similar passages, see the comment on 345, 3-5 (p. 174). Luminis is, in my opinion, an intentionally vague design-ation for the faculty of knowing. Obscura seems to refer to Plato's cx.μu8p6v. A cx.μu8pov e:l8or:, will only admit of a vague and obscure cognition. This knowledge is obtained by paying attention to the fact that the different bodies change into another. We can, thus, conceive a vague idea of what underlies this change by gradually Philosophia Antigua, VIII 4"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"50 THE TREATISE ON MATTER eliminating in our thoughts all these bodily forms.-By his punct-uation Wrobel suggests that mutua ex alio in aliud resolutione belongs to ademptis and denotes a way of thinking. However, it certainly belongs to formantur; Wrobel's comma after formantur should, therefore, come after resolutione. Calcidius uses a similar phrase frequently: 341, 2-3; 342, 12; 345, 1-2; 348, 12. From the context of 348, 12 (par. 325), where he means the same with mutua elementorum ex alio in aliud conversione, it will become evident that he believes himself to be in perfect agreement with Plato's words; however, in that of 341, 2-3 (par. 317-318) there is also an undeniable influence of Aristotle. A striking parallel to the whole present text occurs in the passage taken from N umenius; it is worth while to put them side by side: 305, 1-2 censuit hanc ipsam ratio-nem trahendam usque ad intelle-gentiae lucem. 305, 10-13 ut universis corpori-bus, quae intra gremium silvae var-ie varia formantur mutua ex alio in aliud resolutione, singilla-tim ademptis solum ipsum vacuum sinum spe-culatione mentis imagineris. 328, 3-8 I demque nudam silvae imaginem demonstrare et velut in litcem destituere studens de-tractis omnibus singillatim cor-poribus, quae gremio eius formas invicem mutuantur et invicem mutant, ipsum illud, quod ex egestione vacuatum est, animo considerari iubet. As observed above, Calcidius found the concept of bodies changing into one another in Plato (Tim. 49B ss.; μe:-roc1tMnwv 50B), but here we miss the concept included in detrahere or adimere, that is, the concept of abstraction. In Aristotle, however, this idea is very distinct, e.g., Met. 1029 a 16-19: cx.AAcx μ~v cxcpocLpouμivou μ~xou<; xoct 7tAOC'TOU<; xoct ~cx6ou<; ou3e:v opwμe:v U7tOAe:m6μe:vov, 7tA~V e:t 'TL eO''TL 'TO opL~6μe:vov U7t0 'TOU't'WV, i:la't'e: 'OJV UA7JV cxvcxyx7J cpoclve:a6ocL μ6V7JV oualocv ou't'w axo1touμivoL<;.

This is particularly important, because, in other places as well, Albinus' discussion on the divine principle is very similar to Calcidius' treatment on matter, the material principle.

The main impression given by the whole introductory paraphrase is that Calcidius was strongly influenced by Numenius. Again and again his wording is that of his source. Moreover, although he closely adheres to the text of Plato, a good number of strands can be detected from Aristotle and Albinus. Further study will define how the relations between them have been worked out by Calcidius. 2. HISTORICAL AND SYSTEMATICAL TREATISE a) Historical part [275] In this way the following situation could arise: none of the Ancients doubts the existence of matter, but opinions differ about the question whether it was created (made) or not. The greater part of those who pretend that it was infecta et innata believe it to be continuous by nature, others, however, teach that it consists of different parts. In this last group, some consider it to be shapeless and without quality, others as possessing a def-inite form. Those who take it to be continuous quarrel about the qualities and the form of what is contained in matter and about all the other accidents in it, viz., whether these things proceed from the silva itself or are brought into it by a superior power. Their opinion will now be reviewed. QUA RATIONE FACTUM EST Because matter is a xri>..err:ov XIXL ocμuopov dooc;-ar~d hence difficult to recognize-different opinions have been held about it. The last sentence of Plato's introduction gives Calcidius an opportunity for a historical digression which, however, gradually changes into a systematic treatise. In this first section he gives a summary of the relevant theories. As this sum-mary is included in the survey of this treatise (p. 27), there is no need to repeat it. CUM NULLUS EAM VETERUM DUBITET ESSE One might be surprised at Calcidius' assertion that no philosopher has doubted the existence of matter, but it should be borne in mind that the problem of matter was, in fact, the problem of the first material principle of things, and that this was the central problem of ancient philosophy. UTRUM TAMEN FACTA AN CONTRA INFECTA SIT Further"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"52 THE TREATISE ON MATTER on Calcidius says in/ectam sine generatione and in par. 276 writes generatam instead of /actam (306, 5). It is clear that he regards these terms as identical, as is shown by 266, 6-7: similiter ergo etiam generatum quidem, quod ex aliquo temporis initio natum /actumve sit, ut statuam, and par. 334 (358, 24): Factitm vero generatumque ... All these texts prove conclusively that Calcidius does not regard birth as a higher origin than creation, as Waszink observes with regard to Tertullian (Tertullianus. De anima, 1947, p. 22). PLERIQUE CONTINUAM ET IUGEM, ALII VERO DIVISAM PUTENT This same distinction is found elsewhere in Calcidius, also in historical di-gressions, viz., 251, 20 ss.: Qui dividuam fore silvae substantiam censuerunt interponentes inmenso inani modo expertia modo partes quidem, sed indi/ferentes, sui similes, tum atomos vel solidas moles ... and 254, 8 ss.: At vero ex illis, qui iugem putant esse silvam et aduna-tione quadam sibi continuatam ... One should also observe how Calcidiuc; uses the adjectives divisus and dividuus indiscriminately: 103, 26 corpus indivisum atque individuum. RURSUMQUE EORUM This distinction will be developed in par. 279. II VERO, QUI IUGEM CONTINUATAMQUE POSUERUNT This distinction is parallel to the previous one but the formulation is slightly different. Above, in the case of the Atomists, the point at issue is whether atoms possess qualities or not, whereas in the present passage the question is whether the qualities proceed from the silva itself or are bestowed upon it by some superior power. DE QUALITATIBUS Cp. 299, 17-18: in qua qualitates ... et omnia quae accidunt proveniunt. The words quae ibidem conformantur have the same meaning as in qua quali-tates ... proveniunt. For the term conformare, cp. con/ormationes .in 353, 3 and 374, 2. Calcidius refers to the element of form. Forma should be regarded as designing not the μopi:p~ of Aristotle, but rather the forms ascribed by Plato to the elements (cp. par. 326). EX ALIO POTIORE NUMINE Calcidius means the same power which he denotes elsewhere by the term providentia or provida mens dei. at) Matter was made: the Jews [276a] The Jews think that matter was made. Their greate~t sage, Moses, they say, relied on divine inspiration rather than on human eloquence. He began his book, entitled Genesis, in this way, according to the version of the seventy wise men: \"In the beginning God made heaven and earth. But the earth was"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 276 53 invisible and shapeless\". According to the version of Aquila the text runs: \"As the head of all things, God founded heaven and earth; the earth was empty and nothing\". And according to Symmachus: \"In the beginning God founded heaven and earth: the earth lay inert, confused and disorderly\". But Origen asserts that the Jews convinced him that the translations differ greatly from the original text which reads: \"But the earth was lying in speechless admiration\". In all this, they (the Jews) say, they agree that matter, underlying all bodies, was generated and they explain the terms used in the following manner. HEBRAEI The opinion of these philosophers is discussed by Calcidius in this way: first he gives the text which expresses their standpoint in its different versions (par. 276a); next follows an interpretation of the terms 'beginning' (par. 276b) and 'heaven and earth' (par. 277-278a), and, finally, of the term 'made' (par. 278b). QUORUM SAPIENTISSIMUS MOYSES In the beginning of De mundi opi\"ficio (2 p. 2, 15-23 Colm), Philo says that Moses not only reached the highest summits of philosophy but also spoke by divine inspiration. Also beyond the circle of Jewish scholars Moses was highly esteemed, as appears from the famous assertion of Numenius that Plato was a Meuucr'ij~ <intx(~euv. UT FERUNT On the ground of these words Mosheim (cp. Switalski, o.c., p. 3) concluded that Calcidius did not think Moses an inspired person. This is going too far: Calcidius refers the opinion of the Jews as an outsider. His ut ferunt is here the same as aiunt further on (306, 19). A certain personal feeling about the text is not expressed until the end: opinor (309, 23). His attitude towards the Jews can only be defined by the other texts on the same subject. Calcidius frequently quotes the opinion of the Jews as a confirmation of the theory de-fended by himself. Hence the present instance should not be taken as an attempt to dissociate himself from their theory. de genitura mundi is an exact translation of ntveat~. censetur = vocatur (cp. Waszink, Tert., p. 293). Calcidius uses this term elsewhere: 309, 19; 329, 15. est profatus = 1tpo<p~'t'euaev, i.e., divina inspiratione locutus est (cp. Waszink, ib., p. 468).

SED ORIGENES The preceding list of versions has already turned the reader's thought to Origen's H exapla. The occurrence of his name proves that he was right in doing so. But no trace is left of the translation which is supposed to have been the correct one. The best that can be done is to explain this version from the Hebrew, as is done by Fabricius. Origen must have treated this question in his lost commentary on Genesis. Now the question arises whether Calcidius copied from Origen solely the remark about the correct translation or something more. Fabricius believes that the present passage was entirely derived from Origen. This indeed seems very probable, for Origen is one of the few authors who could be regarded here as Calcidius' authority. Moreover, Origen is well-known for his interest in the Bible versions. One may insist even more. Calcidius says that Origen asserts: \"The Jews have convinced me that we should read: terra autem stupida quadam erat admiratione\". In the book in which the latter asserts this-not in the H exapla, for it contains only the versions"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 276 55 of the text-Origen must also have discussed the other versions. (See the comment on par. 277, where Origen himself seems to con-firm this.) It is, therefore, almost certain that the whole first half of par. 276 was derived from Origen's commentary on Genesis. Calcidius writes about the opinion of the Jews as an objective onlooker: ut /erunt. After mentioning Origen, he continues to do so: omnia tamen haec in imum aiunt (sc. Hebraei) concurrere, and further on: sic probant (310, 3) and ad/erunt (310, 8). What is more obvious than to add to these words: \"as I find in Origen\". [276b] 'Beginning', they say, has no temporal meaning, for before the ordening of the world there was neither time nor succession of day and night, the very things by which time is measured. Besides, 'beginning' has more than one meaning. Solomon, for instance, says: VThe beginning of wisdom is the worship of God\", and \"The beginning of a good way is to do right\". And in his hymn on wisdom the heavenly author says: \"The beginning of live is bread, water, a vestment and a house to cover privy parts\". In these texts the term 'beginning' has not the same but various meanings. Yet there is one beginning of everything about which Solomon in the Book of Proverbs says: \"God created me as the path along which he wanted to go in order to rely on it in performing his divine works. He made me before the origin of the world and the earth, before he founded the deep and caused the sources to flow and the mountains to rise\". He clearly indicates that God, first, created divine Wisdom and afterwards heaven and earth, and that divine Wisdom is the origin of the universe. Thus Wisdom appears to be made by God, but not in time, for there cannot have been any time in which God was without Wisdom. That man comes to knowledge of God before he comes to Wisdom is necessary on account of the sublimity of His nature. First we know the owner of a thing (God) and only then the thing itself (Wisdom). It is in this way that we should understand the term 'beginning'. INITIUM MINIME TEMPORARIUM Calcidius excludes the most obvious meaning of 'beginning'. The word can have no temporal meaning, for time did not exist before the ordering of the world (x6aμoc;}; here there is only question of the phase ante mundi exornationem (cp. p. 239); cp.

The further course of the argument could be sketched as follows: 'Beginning' cannot be taken in a temporal sense. But, as the Jews say, that is not necessary either. From the Bible it is clear that the term 'beginning' may have various meanings, although the same source admits that there is one beginning of all things, viz., Wisdom. Solomon points out: \"God created me as the path he wanted to go\". Hence Wisdom was created first and everything else afterwards. Evidently there can be no question of a creation in time, since there would have been a time in which God was without Wisdom. This is impossible. -The fact that human thinking distinguishes between 'earlier' and 'later' in these matters is caused by the sub-limity of the object not by a really existent before and after.

This text was frequently used. Tertullian gives a similar argument in Adversus Hermogenem, opposing the thesis of Hermogenes that the world was made by God from pre-existing, uncreated matter. Tertullian argues: If God needed some matter in order to make the world, he had at his disposal a material much more sublime and more apt than the matter of the philosophers, viz., Wisdom. This may rightly be called the source and origin of everything, 'the matter of matters', not matter with all kinds of defects-here Tertullian enumerates some qualities of the tJA')-but matter in perfection. (Quis non hanc potius omnium fontem et originem com-mendet, materiam vere materiarum, non fini subditam, non statu diversam, non motu inquietam, non habitu informem, sed insitam et propriam et compositam et decoram ... ed. Wasz. p. 34, 22-25). From Prov. 8, 22 Tertullian concludes to the evidence that this Wisdom of God was made; a fortiori everything else outside God was made, and, therefore, there can be no question of unmade matter. The similarity between Tertullian's argument and Cal-cidius' theory of the Jews is evident. · Immediately the question arises what Origen thinks of this theory. Does he also speak of Wisdom? He does and-just as Tertullian-identifies it with the Son of God, Christ. Thus in De princ. I 2 (Ilept Xpta't'ou): \"Wisdom originated but without a beginning in any sense whatsoever; it is the unigenitus dei filius. This Wisdom is generata not creata or f acta\". So Origen really distinguishes between genitits and factiis (cp. the yevV\"1)0ev-rix ou 1tOL1J6ev-rix of the old Symbola Fidei). So far there is no great re-semblance between Origen and Calcidius. Next Origen asks how"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER then Prov. 8, 22 can speak of a Wisdom which was made, since it says: Creavit me deus ... \"Wisdom can say this\", he observes, \"on account of the foreshadowings of the things present in it\". In other words, speaking of me, Wisdom indicates the images of the things within itself. Hence these may also be denoted by the name 'Wisdom'; and, consequently, there are both a infecta and a facta sapientia 1). According to Evans, Tertullian gives the same interpretation of thi~ text in Adv. Prax. 6. (E. Evans, Tertullian's Treatise against Praxeas, London, 1948, p. 217: \"In the present passage he interprets even this primary generation as a generation not of Wisdom itself but of the projected world in dei sensu, so anxious is he to maintain that Wisdom itself is coeternal with God\".) Nothing is more obvious than to assume that Wisdom, about which we read in Calcidius, is the same as the 'second' sapientia of Origen. In this place Origen. possibly did not mention the unigenitus dei filius (i.e., the 'first' sapientia). It is also possible that Calcidius' text is a shortened and simplified reproduction of Origen. In favour of this second alternative is the other possibility of abbreviation by Calcidius referred to above (p. 56-57). Attention should also be drawn to another text of Calcidius (par. 23), where he speaks of origo non temporaria, a subject not very different from the present one, the initium non temporarium. There Calcidius tries to explain how the body of the world was made and yet is eternal. He argues as follows: in nature everything has a beginning and an end, for nature is as old as time (aequaevum). But things are quite different with the works of God: their origin is beyond understanding. Here one cannot speak of time of origin, I) Propter quod nos semper deum patrem novimus unigeniti filii sui, ex ipso quidem nati et quod est ab ipso trahentis, sine ullo tamen initio, non solum eo quod aliquibus temporum spatiis distingui potest, sed ne illo quidem quod sola apud semet ipsam mens intueri solet et nudo, ut ita dixerim, intellectu atque animo suspicari. Extra omne ergo quod vel dici vel intellegi potest initium generatam esse credendam est sapientiam. In hac ipsa ergo sapientiae sub-sistentia quia omnis virtus ac deformitas futurae inerat creaturae, vel eorum quae principaliter existunt vel eorum quae accidunt consequenter, virtute prae-scientiae praeformata atque disposita. Pro his ipsis, quae in ipsa sapientia velut descriptae ac praefiguratae fuerant, creaturis seipsam per Salomonem dicit creatam esse sapientia \"initium viarum\" dei continens scilicet in semetipsa universae creaturae vel initia vel rationes vel species. Cp. I 4, 4. It is re-markable that in the translation of Prov. 8, 22 by Calciclius the word initium does not occur, whereas he announces it with the words: Est tamen unum rerum initium."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 276 59 but at the most of a cause. For, just as the things of nature have their origin in seeds, so the things of God arise from causae, quae sunt perspicuae divinae providentiae. Therefore, one should not speak of an origo temporaria but of an origo causativa. I wonder whether to Calcidius these causae were not identical with the sapientia discussed in the present passage. This would confirm the opinion that here the second sapientia is meant. One should also note that par. 23, like the present text, does not refer to the ideas. Is this because Origen did non mention the ideas in this context? Perhaps the clue is found in Origen's statement on the word of Christ non sum ex hoe rntmdo (Jo. 17, 14and 16). He writes: Cuius mundi difficilem nobis esse expositionem idcirco praediximus, ne forte aliquibus praebeatur occasio illius intellegentiae, qua putent nos imagines quasdam, quas Graeci tSfoi; nominant, adfirmare: quod utique a nostris rationibus alienum est mundum incorporeum dicere, in sola mentis fantasia vet cogitationum lubrico consistentem (De princ. II 3, 6 p. 121, 26-122, 4 K.). This should be combined with what is said in his preface to De princ. eh. 8-9. There he emphatic-ally rejects the cxi;wμoc't'ov (i.e. incorporeum) of the Graeci. Origen seems to combat the concept of a mundus incorporeus outside God and apparently takes the world of ideas of the philosophi Graeci as such. NEQUE ENIM FUERIT Cp. Origen, De princ. I 2' 3 p. 30, 19-31, 4 K.: Qui autem initium dat verbo dei vel sapientiae dei, intuere ne magis in ipsum ingenitum patrem impietatem suam iactet, cum eum neget semper patrem f uisse et genuisse verbum et habuisse sapientiam in omnibus anterioribus vel temporibus vel saeculis, vel si quid illud est quod nominari potest. This is exactly what Calcidius says. Origen, too, takes his starting-point from the concept of initium. A similar text is found in De princ. I 2, 2 (p. 29, 3-6 K.). QUODQUE DEUM Evidently the argument runs as follows: Yet it may seem that God's Wisdom is posterior to God Himself, because the human mind first attains to a knowledge of God, and only then to a knowledge of His Wisdom. However, question of a difference in time is in the human mind alone, not in the relation between God and His Wisdom. In Origen (p. 58 n.) sapientia is said to have no beginning whatsoever, ne illo quidem quod sola apud semet ipsam mens intueri solet et nudo, ut ita dicam, intellectu atque animo suspicari. These words seem to refer to the same pro-blem and to clash with the theory of Calcidius. One should, how-ever, remember that Origen is speaking of the 'first' sapientia and"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"60 THE TREATISE ON MATTER Calcidius, as it seems, of the 'second'. The general impression of par. 276 is that the argument of Calcidius is nearer to that of Origen than appears at first sight. [277-278] 'Heaven and earth' [277] Now we should see which heaven and which earth the Bible is speaking about. Those who are satisfied with a confused concept think that the heaven we see and the earth which carries us are meant, but those with a deeper insight say that this heaven was not made in the beginning but on the secoc1d day. For in the beginning light was made and called 'day', and after it this heaven which God called 'firmament'. On the third day, after the removal of waters, the dry land appeared and this was called 'earth'. From this it is clear that in the passage quoted it is not our heaven and earth that are meant but other things which are older and should rather be perceived by the intellect than by the senses. Thus the Bible testifies that the true heaven is some-thing different from the firmament, and, further, that the earth meant here is something different from the dry earth which appeared on the third day. This perfectly clear argument, based on Genesis, is also found in Origen, De princ. II 3, 6: Ex illius namque terrae nomine etiam hanc nostram, cui • arida' prius nomen fuerat, cognominatam volunt, sicut et 'firmamentum' hoe • caelum' illius vocabulo nuncupatum est. Verum de huiuscemodi opinionibus plenius in illo loco tractavimus, cum requireremus, quid esset quad 'In principio fecit deus caelum et terram'. Aliud enim 'caeluni' atque alia 'terra' indicatur esse quam illud 'firmamentum', quad post biduum factum dicitur, vel 'arida' quae postmodum 'terra' nominantur. In my opinion, Origen refers to the passage from which Calcidius' par. 276 was derived. It should be noted that Origen, too, first mentions the authors who, in his opinion, tumultuario contenti sunt intellectu. In De princ. II 9, I he gives the second theory: Certum est enim quia non de 'firma-mento' neque de 'arida' sed de illo caelo ac terra dicatur, quorum caelum hoe et terra quam videmus vocabula postea mutuata sunt. In the last-mentioned passage Origen already hints at the real meaning of these terms, a solution which Calcidius expresses in the words intellectu potius quam sensibus haurienda."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 277-278 61 [278] What kind of heaven did God create before the rest, and what kind of earth? Philo thinks that they are immaterial and intelligible creatures, ideas and models of both this earth and the firmament. \"After all\", he says, \"God first created in-telligible man, the prototype of the human race, and only after-wards bodily man\". Others take it that the prophet, knowing that all things have a double feature, viz., an intelligible and a sensible one, indicated the qualities of the two natures by the term3 'heaven' and 'earth', by 'heaven' the immaterial nature, by 'earth' that which is the substance of bodies and which the Greeks call UA'YJ. This interpretation is supported by the text which follows immediately: \"the earth, however, was invisible and shapeless\". This must refer to corporeal matter, the primary substance of the world before it assumed various forms shaped by the skill of the divine Maker. During this phase it was still without colour or quality, and that what is in such a condition is certainly invisible and shapeless. It is also called \"empty and nothing\", because, although a recipient of all qualities, it possesses no quality of itself. Matter as the recipient of all acci-dents is called 'empty' because, as it seems, it can never be filkd up. It is called 'nothing' because of itself it is devoid of anything. Symmachus calls it \"inactive and disorderly\"; 'in-active', because of itself it cannot do anything; 'disorderly', because it has the aptitude of being ordered by the Creator of the world who decorates it. The expression \"speechless with amazement\" points at a certain similarity to a soul, for, as these words express, it was struck with amazement by the majesty of its Maker and Creator. But if God made a corporeal matter which once was shapeless and which the Bible calls 'earth', there is seemingly no reason for doubting that there is also an intelligible matter of immaterial nature, which is indicated by the name 'heaven'. It is made and made in such a way that now exists what did not exist. This is posed by them in this way: A mortal workman obtains his material from another workman, the latter receives it from nature, nature from God, but God from nobody, for there is nothing before God. He, therefore, made sufficient material for the making of the world.

Philo finds a confirmation of his theory in the fact that Holy Scripture de-scribes the creation of man twice: Gen. 1, 27 and 2, 7.

With good reason, therefore, Calcidius also mentions man together with heaven and earth. ALII NON ITA Another group of Jews is against Philo. According to them, the prophet (i.e., Moses) means the two features proper to all things. By 'heaven', they think, he means natura incorporea, by 'earth' matter. What exactly is this natura incorporea? Since it is opposed to matter, one is inclined to think of the element of form in things, especially of the ideas. But the answer depends on the interpretation of Quod si facta est ... (309, 22). Calcidius first shows how the Jews see their interpretation of 'earth' confirmed by the second phrase of Genesis in its different versions. QUAE SUBSTANTIA EST CORPORUM Elsewhere matter is called prima subiectio corporum (see the comment on 299, 16, p. 31).

QUAM GRAECI HYLEN VOCANT Cp. 299, 14; 304, 6. TERRA AUTEM ERAT INVISIBILIS ET INFORMIS In par. 276 Calcidius reads incompleta instead of in/ormis. In De princ. IV 4, 6 (33) Origen says: Quam plurimi sane putant ipsam rerum ma-teriam signi/icari in eo quod in principio Genesis scriptum est a Moyse: \"In principio /ecit deus caelum et terram, terra autem erat invisibilis et incomposita\"; 'invisibilem' namque et 'incompositam terram' non aliud eis M oyses quam in/ormem materiam visus est indicare. This is very similar to the present passage from Calcidius. Plurimi leaves room for a different opinion, which would be Philo's. Of course, these plurimi are the atii of Calcidius. The question who they actually were again remains unanswered, but they must be the other Jewish philosophers. SILVAE CORPOREAE is opposed to the silva intellegibilis or incorporea about which there is question below (p. 64). VETUS MUNDI SUBSTANTIA Cp. quae est substantia corporum (309, 5). DEI OPIFICIS This expression so often met with in Calcidius (cp. ad 301, 1 J is also found in (the translation of) Origen. On the creation of matter he writes: Et miror quomodo isti culpent eos, qui vel opificem deum vel providentiam huius universitatis negant (De princ. II 1, 4). It should be noted that in the first chapters of Calcidius' treatise De silva, deus opifex and providentia are interchangable terms. In the same text Origen speaks about matter secundum propriam rationem, i.e., without qualities. This is exactly what Calcidius writes. Origen adds that matter actually is nowhere found without quality; Calcidius says the same in par. 310. Further on he often speaks about matter as being without quality or form. INANIS PORRO ET NIHIL Matter is receptive of every-thing (receptrix = u1to~ox~. Tim. 49A; Calcidius often uses the term receptaculum) and so has nothing of its own. CUNCTA QUAE ACCI-DUNT Cp. omnia quae accidunt (299, 17). Matter seems never to become filled up, hence it is 'empty'.

STUPIDAE VERO EX ADMIRATIONE As this reading must have been in Origen, its explanation-and, for that matter, the whole preceding part-must have been taken from him as well. \"Matter was speechless with astonishment before the maiestas opificis\". This terminology reminds one of par. 270: sed ita victam, ut maiestati opificis libens cedat ... (301, 1). This, in its tum, refers to the passage from Numenius (p. 120). QUOD SI FACTA After demonstrating in an elaborate way how authors find support in the various translations of Gen. 1, 1 for their interpretation of the term 'earth', Calcidius returns to the explanation of the term 'heaven'. He had already called it incorpoream naturam (309, 4), which is now interpreted as intellegibilis silva incorporei generis. The meaning of the passage, at first sight fairly difficult to understand, may be paraphrased as follows. \"If the term 'earth' denotes corporeal matter, the term 'heaven', in our opinion, may be interpreted as 'intelligible, incor-poreal matter'; both are to be regarded as created by God\". Two details are noteworthy here, namely the fact that the author himself comes forward (opinor) and, furthermore, the concept of an in-corporeal matter. As to the first point, one may be inclined to find in this passage a further argument independent from the opinion of the alii just reported. However, one detail warns us to be caut-ious, viz., the circumstance that in par. 280 (311, 8) Calcidius uses the same opinor in a passage evidently borrowed from Aristotle. It is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that in the present passage this verb is added to an account of Origen's opinion. Indeed, much speaks in favour of this hypothesis, for it is almost certain that Origen said something about this natura incorporea. The structure of the argument presupposes this. That Origen did defend such a theory may be inferred from his assumption that in the beginning God created a sufficient amount of matter and spirit. In De princ. II 9, 1, discussing the text of Sap. II, 20 ixAAix 1tocv,oc μhpep xoct &pt6μ<j> 8te,oc~occ; he writes: porro autem sicut et scriptura dicit \"numero et mensura universa\" condidit deus, et idcirco 'numerus' quidem recte aptabitur rationabilibus creaturis vel mentibus, ut tantae sint, qu-antae a providentia dei et dispensari et regi et contineri possint. 'M ensura' vero materiae corporali consequenter aptabitur; quam utique tantam a deo creatam esse credendum est, quantam sibi sciret ad ornatum mundi posse sufficere. Haec ergo sunt quae in initio, id est ante omnia, a deo creata esse aestimandum est. Quod quidem etiam in illo initio,"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 278 quod Moyses latentius introducit, indicari piitamus, cum dicit: \"In principio f ecit deus caetum et terram\". As regards corporeal matter, Calcidius' terminology is in complete accordance with that of Origen. Yet, while Origen speaks of creaturae rationales vel mentes, Calcidius uses silva intellegibilis. This expression does not occur elsewhere in Calcidius but in par. 272 a passage is found where the existence of such an intelligible matter seemed to be presupposed. In that passage an influence of Numenius was evident (cp. p. 43). This leads to the supposit10n that in the present passage Calcidius reports the doctrine of Origen but in a manner which betrays the influence of Numenius. That Calcidius is, indeed, working upon material from Origen is also shown by the words soon following: ipse (sc. deus) igitur silvestras inpensas mundi fabricae sufficientes utilesque constituit. They contain the typically Origenian idea of the 'sufficient material'. FACTAM VERO Finally, Calcidius reflects upon fecit in Gen. 1, 1. The Jews interpreted this term as referring to a creatio ex nihilo and they explain it in this way: \"The human workman receives his material from another workman (e.g., the carpenter from a forester), the latter from nature, nature from God, but God from nobody, for there is nothing earlier than God. He himself has made the material in sufficient quantities\". As already stated, this last idea strongly reminds one of Origen, who also defended a creation out of nothing, and it may be assumed that the argument too is derived from him. Similar sounds can be heard in Theophilus, Ad Autol. II 10: \"And in the first place they (the prophets) have taught us unanimously that He made the universe out of nothing. For nothing was equal in time to God\", and ib. 24: \"For when a craftsman has received his material from someone, he makes out of it whatever he wants. But the power of God is shown by this that He makes whatever He wants out of nothing\" (Quoted by J. H. Waszink, Tertullian, The Treatise against Hermogenes, London, 1956, p. 10). Tertullian only accepts an existence of matter, if it is regarded as identical with God's Wisdom. It is for this reason that he attacked Hermogenes' theory about eternal matter, and so he, too, actually assumed a creatio ex nihilo. Speaking of matter in connexion with God is according to Basilius (o.c., p. 144-146) an anthropomorphism. Needless to repeat that Calcidius also found this theory in Origen. If the given interpretation is correct, we have in par. 276-278 Philosophia Antiqua, VIII 5"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"66 THE TREATISE ON MATTER a passage derived from Origen-most probably from his commentary on Genesis-but re-interpreted by Calcidius in a Numenian sense. If so, this text gives us a first inkling of Calcidius' method of work-ing. Numenian influence occurs in other texts of Calcidius on the Jews (see ad par. 295 and 299). In point of fact, Numenius' respect for the doctrine of the Jews is well-known. Of course, it is out of the question that Origen should have influenced Calcidius through the intermediary of Numenius; Numenius lived before him. Therefore we have to assume a direct influence of Origen on Calcidius, the latter interpreting his source in a Numenian fashion, at least in some passages. ~) Matter was not made ococ) It consists of small parts [ 279] The opinions of those who say that corporeal matter has not been generated must still be studied. Their theories are equally divergent. Some say that matter displays some coherence, because it consists of particles, sooner perceived by the in-tellect than by the senses, which are mutually connected, placed in some position or other and have a certain shape; thus Demo-critus and Epicurus. Others, such as Anaxagoras, say that the particles also have some quality, but the latter thinks that the nature and the peculiarity of all matters are contained in each particular kind of matter. Others, again, think that matter with its fine structure is formed by the smallness of the indivisible particles; thus Diodorus and some Stoics. The union and separa-tion of these particles is said by them to be accidental. Since there are unnumerable theories of this kind, I omit them. CoRPOREAM SILVAM There will be no more question of intelli-gible matter lCp. 309, 22 ss.). QUORUM AEQUE DIVERSAE OPI-NIONES SUNT In par. 275 Calcidius enumerated various theories of those who think matter continuous. Here it appears that among the 'Atomists' the divergences are just as g1eat. TEXTUM EIUS ET QUASI CONTINUATIONEM These words seem to take a stand against those who think that matter, since it gives the impression of being continuous, is continuous in reality.

These words at once show from which"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 279 67 angle Calcidius approaches the different points of view. His atten-tion is concentrated not so much on the way in which these philo-sophers explain the qualities-though these may be discussed indirectly-but rather on the way in which they explain the ap-pearance of continuity in matter. In this context reference should be made to Aristotle's Phys. 203a 22-23, where Aristotle says about Anaxagoras and Democritus: -tjj &.cp7i auve:x.e:c; TO &1mpov e:IvocL cpoca(v.

ET NON NULLI STOICORUM This addition is just as unusual as all the previous data are com-mon, for the Stoics are not mentioned anywhere in the parallel passages relating to Diodorus. According to all, the Stoics considered matter to be continuous. Calcidius himself says the same in his lengthy discussion of the Stoic view of matter in par. 289-294 (See also the beginning of par. 280). Here, however, Stoics are mentioned who pretend that matter consists of an infinite number of indivisible particles-smallness seems to be their only charac-teristic-which assemble or separate fortuitously. Baumker (o.c., p. 342, n. 5) speaks of \"eine unorganische Verbindung der stoischen rnit der epicureischen Lehre\". The 'inorganic' factor in the combi-nation is, of course, to be found in the element of chance which has taken the place of the Stoic frrovidentia. (Baumker is certainly wrong when he says that Calcidius lists Diodorus among the non nulli Stoicorum; he mentions him separately. This Diodorus was one of the masters of Zeno of Citium (See P.W. V 705).) Elsewhere Calcidius gives yet another list of adherents of 'corpus-cula-theories'; among the philosophers named above he includes Empedocles. Another difference occurs in the latter passage where there is no question of non nulli Stoicorum but simply of Stoici. This second list is entered in the passage of the y6μcpoL, the 'rivets', by means of which, according to Plato (Tim., 43A), man was built up by the lower gods. Calcidius explains how these rivets are to be understood: 'I nvisibiles' porro 'coniunctiones gomphos' adpellat, vet minorum corpusculorum coacervationem ut Diodorus, vel eorundem similium inter se conglobationem formabilem ut Anaxagoras, vel sufrra dictorum multiformem inplicationem ut Democritus et Leucippus, vel interdum concretionem, interdum discretionem ut Empedocles, concretionem quidem amicitiam, discretionem porro et separationem inimicitiam vocans, vel ut Stoici corporum diversorum usque quaque concretionem. Quorum omnium quendam nodum concatenationemque dicit esse in minutis solidisque corpusculis, quae gomphos cognominat (par. 203; 243, 19-244, 5). Reading this one wonders what exactly these gomphi are. Are they corpuscula, as Calcidius says at the end, or coniunctiones, as he says earlier on? The answer is, of course, that they are both. They are corpuscula in so far they form corn-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 280 69 binations. One may also say that 'combination' is to be taken in the sense of what we call 'a chemical combination'. When at the end of this quotation there is question of minuta et solida corpuscula, the doctrine of the non nulli Stoicorum of par. 279 comes, naturally, to the fore. Who were they? Did some Stoics follow Diodorus in this respect rather than his pupil Zeno? The answer can only be guessed at. Still, another solution is equally possible. Everyone will be struck by the fact that in the list just quoted the last two mentioned, Empedocles and the Stoics, do not really belong there. The text of Sextus referred to, viz., Adv. Math. IX 363, runs in this fashion: ot OE 1tEpt 'Eμ1tEoox).eoc xoct ot OC7t0 't\"~c;; ~'C\"oiic;; y~v XOCL uowp xoct cxtpoc XOCL 1tup (Tfocrocpoc yocp 7t!XV'C\"WV • 'I' I -• I ) A I ~\\ I 'E I ' I pt~wμoc'C\"OC 7tpW'C\"OV OCXO\\JE .... u\"l)μoxpL't\"Oc;; OE XOCL ,mxoupoc;; OC'C\"oμouc;;, EL μ~ 'C\"L ...

Inverting the order of these authors, it agrees exactly with that given by Calcidius in par. 203. The one difference is that Calcidius mentions Leucippus instead of Epicurus. The assumption, therefore, that Calcidius took the enumeration in par. 203 from a similar source is perfectly admissable. He thus ranked the Stoics with the Atomists. What has happened in par. 279? We venture to suppose that, at second thought, Calcidius reasoned: I cannot possibly write \"Diodorus and the Stoics\", because the Stoa is of a different opinion. So it can only have been some of the Stoics who held this view. Empedo-cles was left out, because he was yet coming up for discussion. In this supposition the formulation non nulli Stoicorum must have been conceived by Calcidius. He brought different sources into accord with each other. This explanation is strongly supported by the fact that the other data in this section (par. 279) agree with those in other sources. ~~) Matter is continous Transition [280a] Those, however, who profess that the constitution of matter too is a work of Providence, think that it is a contin-uous whole from beginning to end. But for the rest opinions vary greatly among all philosophers involved, viz., Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics. However, they all consider matter to be shapeless and without quality."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"70 THE TREATISE ON MATTER QUI TAMEN Now that Calcidius passes from the 'Atomists' to those who might be called the 'Continuists', the following trend of thought-also on the ground of the distinction made in par. 275-would be expected. \"We now come to the philosophers who take matter to be continuous. Some reason that matter possesses qualities of itself (for instance, Thales c.s.), whereas others deny this and think those qualities and forms to have come from some different principle\"; ex aliquo potiore nitmine, Calcidius par. 275, which equals his providentiae opus here. But what does one actually find? Calcidius continues: Qui tamen providentiae opus pronuntiave-runt. In this way, it seems, he connects the doctrine of Providence with that of continuity, thereby contradicting what is said in par. 275. He distinguished the 'Atomists' from the 'Continuists' and subdivided the latter into two groups, and only the second group appealed to another principle. Here he distinguishes the 'Ato-mists' from the thinkers qui providentiae opus, etc., seemingly suggesting that all 'Continuists' profess the doctrine of Providence. However, this is not Calcidius' real thought. By qui tamen provi-dentiae opus, etc. he docs not mean all 'Continuists' but only Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics. These alone are singled out as opponents of those who ascribe quality to matter. This train of thought is tortuous and illogical, but it can be explained. Calcidius, eager to raise the question of Providence, creates a contrast between the theories coming up for discussion and those already discussed in which both the union and the segregation of the particles were said to be f ortuitus. The silvae constitutio is probably identical with the initial stage of the constitutio mundi, the conferring of the first forms and quali-ties on matter. Therefore, he stresses that these too are the result of Providence's activity. In other words, Providence did not be-come active at a second stage of the constitutio mundi. This would confirm what is said just now, viz., that Calcidius here only means Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics, and not Thales c.s. AB EXORDIO USQUE AD FINEM At first sight this wording expresses the continuity in time, but Calcidius definitely means a conti-nuity in space. It is worth noting how emphatically matteris pres-ented as an independent reality, as was always done by the Stoics. Another resemblance to the Stoic doctrine of matter lies in the stress on its unity (unam, cp. 321, 16: unamque eam ... ; 322, 12, 14: unum). PYTHAGORAS, PLATO, ARISTOTLE, STOIC! Calcidius lists"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 280-282 7I the names in their historical sequence, but in the discussion of their views in par. 283-3or the order differs: Aristotle, Stoics, Pythagoras or rather Numenius' interpretation of Pythagoras and, finally, Plato. Since Calcidius' chief aim is to interpret Plato, his theory concludes the discussion. But Numenius is really the last author treated by Calcidius. From what has been said above, it is only logical that this author is treated in the last place but one. (r) Matter has qualities and form [280b] Others gave matter a form, such as Thales, who is said to have been the first to investigate the mysteries of nature. Thales asserted that water was the beginning -of all things. He did so, I think, because he saw that all food consumed by living creatures is damp. The same idea is found in Homer where the poet says that Oceanus and Tethys are the parents of what-ever came into being, and also where he says that the gods swear by water-which, however, he himself calls Styx. Homer did this, because he believed that honour is due to what is oldest and because, in his opinion, nothing is more venerable than the oath. But according to Anaximenes the principle of everything is air, also of water. He, in his tum, disagrees with Heraclitus who con-siders fire to be the origin of things. So all these philosophers, putting first water, air or fire, think that the principle is in motion. [28r] However, others defend that matter is immovable and made as one big whole out of everything. They think that the universe is something immovable without a beginning or end; thus Xenophanes, Melissus and Parmenides. But Parmenides says that this whole, comprising everything, is perfect and lim-ited, Melissus that it is undefined and unlimited. [ 282] The teaching of Empedocles is this: matter is varie-gated and multiform, sustained by four roots, viz., fire, water, air and earth, from which now a union now a separation of all bodies come forth. The union he calls friendship, the separation discord. These, I think, are the philosophers who say that matter has form, qualities and body.

Calcidius describes the difference between Parmenides and Me-lissus in the same way as Aristotle. In the formulation of the similarity between the respective doctrines (et eandem ex omnibus in unam molem redactam) more attention, it seems, is paid to the doctrine of Melissus than to that of Parmenides, for the latter teaches a unity xoc\"t\"oc 1.ov Myov, the former a unity xoc\"t\"oc -r~v UAlJV. This is why Calcidius treats of Parrnenides in some kind of addendum, that is after the discussion of Xenophanes (who, according to Aristotle, did not speak about the nature of the unity at all), and Melissus. From par. 350 (373, 19-20 alii sola intellegibilia, ut Parmenides) it appears that Calcidius was positively acquainted with the latter's doctrine. EMPEDOCLES Aristotle mentions Empedo-cles in Met. 984 a 8-II and 985 a 23-24, hut Calcidius shows a greater similarity with Aetius, Plac.

It is interesting that Calcidius translates the poetical pL~w-μix't'ix literally by radicibus. The same details are also found in Sextus Emp., Adv. Math. IX 362 and X 315-317. They are evidently well-known doxographical details. In the text quoted on p. 68 Cal-cidius also mentioned Empedocles; instead of discretio and discordia he there uses separatio and inimicitia. HI SUNT This final clause contains a surprising element, viz., the words et corpus. By now we are well enough acquainted with Calcidius' style to know that at such unexpected turns the context should be examined. And, indeed, the context, again, furnishes the solution: et corpus is set against sine consortia corporum in the first period of the subsequent para-graph. Likewise the unexpected providentia (310, 23) was set against fortuitus two paragraphs earlier. But, as in this case something more should be said about this distinction, since both expressions are inaccurate. Not all authors discussed above hold that matter is a corpits nor do all those to be discussed hold that it is incorporeal. For instance, among the former is Parmenides of whom elsewhere (373, 19) Calcidius himself says that he held the universe to be intelligible and hence incorporeal. And among the latter are the Stoics about whom Calcidius shows that, to them, matter and even God are corporeal. This apparent inconsistency betrays a lack of mastery of the subject. Fond of making distinctions, Calcidius must have wrongly elaborated or abbreviated his source. Mean-while, it is perhaps possible to trace his train of thought. Although intent upon an adequate distinction, his attention is drawn so much to the theory of Aristotle, that he writes sine consortio cor-porum. This expression indeed holds for Aristotle, but not for all subsequent authors. Nor did the Qui tamen providentiae opus in par. 280. The words et corpus were added in order to stress the distinction. The general impression of the paragraph concerning the Pre-Socratics is that of a strong agreement with the well-known doxo-graphical details. For the greater part Aristotle is their source. The main activity of Calcidius is a not always successful attempt to give a more systematic distinction."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 283 75 (2) Matter has neither quality nor form (a) Aristotle [283] But of those who, rejecting the occurrence of qualities and a form in matter, conceive it by itself without any form of corporeality, Aristotle admits three principles of material things, viz., matter, form and privation. He studies each of these separately, although he states that the one cannot exist without the others. He says that the world is without beginning or end but that divine Providence gave it eternal existence. Because his opinion is both famous and very suitable for pondering upon Plato's doctrine, we should not pass it heedlessly. But first, I think, the argument of the old philosophers should be explained, who asserted that nothing of what exists came to be or will perish. They argue in this way: \"If a thing comes to be, it arises from either nothing or a tning already existing. Neither is possible: it can spring from no existing thing, because what already exists cannot again begin to exist, for what comes to be does not as yet exist. Nor can it come from what does not exist, for whatever comes to be needs something underlying from which it arises. Hence nothing comes to be. Nor does any-thing perish, for what perishes is dissolved into either a remnant or nothing. But neither is possible, as will soon appear. So nothing comes to be and nothing perishes. Now, why can it be said <what above is left to be proved> that what exists or perishes cannot be dissolved into nothing? The reason is that, in this case, the same thing exists and perishes: for if it is not dissolved into a remnant it will at once exist and not exist, which is im-possible. On the other hand, if what dissolves becomes something else, it perishes and does not perish, which is equally impossible. AT VERO The absence of the antecedent of this relative clause (one would expect: At vero ex eorum m,mero, qui ... ) seems to be due to the Greek /Sao~, which is more easily used without an antecedent. Three properties (which below Calcidius mentions quite frequently) of matter are mentioned: it is lack of 1) qualities, 2) form, 3) body. The formulation of the third property is peculiar: alongside de-trahunt ei qualitates and informem constituunt one would expect et sine consortio corporum eam esse dicunt, si sola per semet ipsa mente consideratur. This is what Calcidius wants to say, but the two"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER thoughts are rather awkwardly expressed in a single phrase.

DIVINA PROVIDENTIA Needless to say that this formulation is not from Aristotle, but from Calcidius, or rather from Numenius, on whom he depends in several other passages where there is question of Providence. For the rest one finds here a correct explanation of Aristotle's doctrine in Phys. I 8-9. The greater part of the following treatise is taken from it. curns SENTENTIA Aristotle's opinion is discussed because \"it is so suitable for a close study of Plato's doctrine\". Calcidius' purpose is to interpret the doctrine of Plato, and no more. Aristotle, to him, is only import.ant in so far as his treatment of the problems can increase understanding of Plato. Indeed, Calcidius sees Aristotle in the first place as an auditor Platonis (336, 10) and, for this reason, regards him as not opposed to Plato but rather as following in the same line. Henceforth there are more than one opportunity to elaborate this point. PRIUS TAMEN Videtur might appear to refer to some initia-tive of Calcidius himself, but what follows is an almost literal rendering of the argument by Aristotle in Phys. I 8. Two similar cases are noted in 3n, 8 and 309, 23, in connexion with opinor. Again this shows the author's method of procedure. Material from others is assimilated and occasionally adapted for his own way of thinking; see, for instance, above in divina providentia (312, 16).

The similarity is so striking that no doubt is left that Calcidius translated Aristotle, wherever he may have found his text. Calcidius' verbosity, of course, harms in no way this statement. This is quite obvious when comparing the text of the Timaeus with his Latin version. The real difference lies in the fact that Calcidius (or his source) also elaborates the impossibility of destruction, a point which Aristotle omitted, because it was easily proved from his preceding argument. Calcidius again admits two possibilities: What perishes is dissolved into a remnant, or into no renmant at all. Both suppositions are impossible, ''as we will prove\", says Calcidius. Then he draws the conclusion that nothing begins to exist or perishes. He continues: Why can one say that there is no question of a real destruction into nothing? The reason is the implication that the same thing exists and perishes. This is proved then for the two possibilities distinguished above, viz., a dissolution into nothing or a dissolution into something. In the first case, Calcidius says, there would be being and not being at the same time, since s o m e t h i n g would dissolve into n o t h i n g. In the second"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER case destruction and no-destruction would exist at the same time, since something would d i s s o 1 v e into something, and so would n o t p e r i s h . The second argument, obviously, starts from the same a priori as the first. Similar digressions must have been rather frequent in Aristotelian literature. Aristotle himself points the way: xotl. oU'C'w 8~ -.o e:q:,e:~lj<; auμ.~ot°Lvov citJ~ov-.e:i; (ib.). [284] By means of this argument the old philosophers tried to prove that neither coming-to-be nor destruction exists. But Aristotle makes distinction in this argument, having shewn first, that the terms to-exist and not-to-exist, to-become and to-perish have a double meaning. There is, indeed, a becoming with regard to the nature of a thing and with regard to an acci-dent, for instance in the case of a sick musician recovering from his illness. Nature here is ill and recovers, but this happens not because the subject is a musician; it is accidental to his being a musician, for it was accidental that the musician was ill. The same holds for destruction: if a white object of a foot high changes into (lit.: perishes into) a black one, in principal it undergoes a change of essence, because it is white. But it under-goes this change accidentally in so far as it is a foot high. Therefore, when we say that the musician is recovering, his recovery happens accidentally, for he recovers indeed. If we say: he is ill, his nature suffers. And again, if we say: the white object of a foot high perishes because it becomes black, we say that this happens accidentally; if we call it white, we speak of the nature. Therefore, when we say that something arises out of non-existence, the non-existence is twofold. First, non-existing of the nature, and in this case what has been said is impossible, viz., that out of what does not exist at all something would arise, so that it really exists. Secondly we speak of non-existing with respect to an accident, viz., if what becomes, becomes in the sense of becoming different from what is was before, and thus acquiring something more than what it had by nature. For instance, when a statue arises out of a shapeless mass. Bronze is shapeless by nature, the shape impressed on it by the artist arises out of not-being; therefore we say that it arises accidentally. It is also possible that something else arises out of an existing thing; but this only happens accidentally, for instance, when a grammarian acquires the science of medicine. For here a man,"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 284 79 expert in one science, becomes an expert in another branch too. Consequently, we also speak of a thing perishing and dissolving into something else, not in the proper sense but only by accident, for instance, when a statue of father Liber is altered into one of Apollo. In this case also the shape seems to alter into another, not in the proper sense, but only accidentally. In the same way, an existing thing can perish and dissolve into a non-existing thing, but not to such an extent that this destruction implies total annihilation, i.e., that what existed before does not exist any more. The interpretation of this paragraph is greatly facilitated by our knowledge of Aristotle's text to which Calcidius refers. He evidently continues his comment of Physics I 8. Aristotle, after demonstrating how earlier philosophers came to regard all coming-to-be and passing-away as impossible, expounds his conflicting view (191 a 34 ss.): \"Our explanation on the other hand is that the phrases 'something comes to be from what is or is not' and 'what is not or what is does something or has something done to it or becomes something whatever', are to be taken in the same sense as 'a doctor does something or has something done to him', and 'is a doctor or becomes something else'. These expressions may be understood in two ways. The same holds for 'from being', and 'a being acts or is acted upon'. A doctor builds a house, not qua doctor but qua builder; he turns gray, not qu,a doctor but qua being dark-haired. On the other hand, he doctors or fails to doctor qua doctor.\" A similar distinction, Aristotle continues, must be made in the question whether what is and what is not comes to be, for two things can be meant: what is and what is not, as such and not as such. The difference is this : in the case of the doctor both changes are possible, whereas what is and what is not can only undergo a change not-as-such, xoc,oc auμ~e:~7jx6c;, as Aristotle says in 191 b 15-in the first case the adverb xup(wc; is used (191 b 7). In this argument Aristotle finds the starting-point for solving the problem of change in the way in which we use to speak about things. In 191 b 2 he says: 8Lxwc; Mye:TotL. Without further comment he passes from the order of speaking to the order of being. In other words, his analysis of change is, in fact, an analysis of the speaking about change which, in its turn, is the expression of thought. In exactly the same way he begins in Physics I 7 from the various"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Bo THE TREATISE ON MATTER ways of speaking in order to reach his fundamental thesis, viz., 8ei: ·n &.d u1toxei:a6oct TO yL\"yv6μevov: every kind of coming-to-be requires an underlying something (190 a 14-15; further 190 a 34; 190 b 10; 191 a 4-5, 16-17, 31). Thus the value of Aristotle's doctrine on matter is immediately dependent on the question whether passing from the order of speaking (0r thinking) to that of being is admissible. Calcidius renders Aristotle's argument in this way. Aristotle distinguishes saying that the terms 'being', 'not-being', 'coming-to-be' and 'passing-away' can have two meanings. One may speak, for instance, of a coming-to-he sernndum naturam and a coming-to-be ex aliquo accidenti. These terms, obviously, are the Latin translation of Aristotle's :v.uplw~ and xocToc auμ~&~'Y)x6~. Next Cal-cidius, like Aristotle, gives a further explanation of (our speaking about) some concrete processes of change. The proposition 'A musician recovers not qua musician but qua patient', which is purely Aristotelian (cp. 191 b 5: o £ocTpo~ ... A&uxo~ y(yv&Toct oux fl £ocTpo~ uA' -'fi μeAoc~). is rather awkwardly expressed by quod quidem ex natif.ra est, aegrotat et convalescit, non tamen quia musicus est; ex accidenti porro, quia musicus est (the example reminds one of the μoucnxo~ &v6pw1to~ in Physics I 7). In the same way Calcidius treats a second example which bears upon not coming-to-be but passing-away. That Calcidius, too, finds no difficulty whatever in passing from the order of speaking to the order of being is shewn by his further explanation: Cum igit-ur di c i m u s musicum convatescere, tune quod fit ex accidenti fit. It is self-evident to him that this speaking ex accidenti has its real counterpart in a coming-to-be ex accidenti; cp. his words quia provenit ut convalescat. Now in coming-to-be as such, Calcidius continues, the same distinction can be made between fieri secundum naturam and fieri ex accidenti. However, a coming-to-be as such (secundum naturam) is impossible, since this would mean that something comes to be out of nothing. This contradicts the fundamental principle 8ei: TL u1toxei:a6oct. On the other hand, coming-to-be ex accidenti is quite possible. Calcidius quotes the well-known example of the shapeless bronze made into a statue, an image used by Aristotle in the same context (190 a 25). In this process something comes to be out of something which did not yet exist, but it does so ex accidenti. Similarly, something can come-to-be from something already existing, but, once more, this is a coming-to-be ex accidenti, as is the case with"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 285 81 somebody who possesses a certain faculty and acquires another. Finally, it is possible to speak of a passing-away into something else or into nothing, but again only a passing-away ex accidenti can be meant. In general Calcidius' wording in this paragraph is far from clear. For instance, in 314, 2-4: Rursum cum dicimus candidum illud pedalis mensurae corrurnpi, quia convertatur in nigredinem, hoe ex accidenti dicimus /ieri. The noun candid um is superfluous, for speaking about something white becoming black implies a judgment iuxta naturam. Calcidius says this himself in the phrase immediately following: cum vero candidum cognominamus, naturam eius exprimi-mus. In spite of this, Calcidius stuck to the train of Aristotle's argument which is ultimately based on the axiom oe:i: TL ur.oxe:fo8oct. [ 285] So this is one way in which, according to Aristotle, it is possible <to say> that something begins to exist out of something that is, or out of something that is not, and also that something dissolves either into something else, or into nothing. Another way is to say of a thing that it exists and does not exist, viz., if a thing that will certainly come into being, when its realization takes place, is said to be, though its coming into being has not yet taken place <and, therefore, it does not yet actually exist>. Of all these things we say that they exist in possibility, because their existence is presumed on account of this possibility, in the same way as we say that bronze is a possible statue, though at the moment it still is a shapeless metal. Thus it is a statue and it is not: it is a statue, because it can become one, but it is not a statue, because the realization has not yet taken place. And in the same way it exists to some extent and to some extent it does not exist, and from what to some extent exists something can a1ise; in the same way something can dissolve and perish into something that to some extent is not. So there do exist a coming-to-be and a passing-away. UNA IGITUR HAEC RATIO EST It is, again, clear, how closely Calcidius follows Aristotle. In Phys. 191 b 27 the latter continues: e:tc; μ.ev o~ -rp61toc; oo-roc;, and, without elaborating this first ratio, as does Calcidius, he adds: ixJJ..oc; o' o-rL evoexe:-rocL -rocu-rix )J;ye:Lv xoc-rix ~v OUVOC(.LLV xoct ~v &vepye:LOCV • TOUTO o' iv IX/\\AOLc; OLWpLO'TOCL OL1 ocxpt[3e:locc; μ.iiJJ..ov (A clear explanation of the same is in Met. 1069 b 15-19: Philosophia Antiqua, VIII 6"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"82 THE TREATISE ON MATTER > l. ~1 ~ \\ \\ >I (.I.

So there are two ways of be-coming: I) out of what is not, but only per accidens; 2 J out of what is possibly. Iu Calcidius corresponds to this the beginning of the second phrase Alia vero ratione and, further, the terms effectus and possibilitas. For the rest Calcidius is, again, more diffuse and, discussing the subiect in a different way, he certainly is not clearer than Aristotle. UT CUM AES is a stereotype example in this matter, e.g., Phys. 190 a 25; Met. 1013 b 6-9; De gen. an. 724 a 23; Polit. 1256 a 9-n; see also Bii.umker, o.c., p. 252, n. 3. ALIQUA-TENUS EST, ALIQUATENUS NON EST What was just said about definite forms of being (est statua et non est statua) is now applied to being itself (est et non est). In general, this paragraph has the same characteristics as the preceding one: arduous and verbose, it clarifies in no way Aristotle's words; there are, however, no striking inaccuracies. [286] Because we thought these things necessary for an ex-planation of Aristotle's doctrine concerning the principles of things, which includes matter, we have been careful to treat them first. Aristotle's own words show the need for doing so, for he argues thus: \"We think that matter should be distinguished from privation, in the sense that matter is not something existing by itself but rather accidentally, whereas privation is non-existing in the proper and absolute sense; and, furthermore, that matter has something which approaches essence, while privation possesses no essence at all. According to others, he says, privation and matter are the same, but they are wrong, for they call it 'small and great' and reduce two things to be kept separately, to one and the same thing; and they think that one thing underlies all corporeal things. For although they divide it into a bigger and a smaller part, so that there are two, yet only one thing is indicated of this duality, the other is omitted. For matter is, like a mother, cooperating in the formation of bodies, but privation does not cooperate in the formation; it hinders rather and thwarts it, for as the form is divine and desirable, privation contradicts it, while matter, yearning for"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 286 form and adornment, desires it by its own nature. Further, if privation should desire the form, it would needs desire its own opposite, and every opposite entails destruction <of its opposite>. Therefore, privation will not long for <the form, since this is> its ruin. Nor does the form long for itself, for it is a full and per-fect good, and whatever longs for a thing must lack something. <Still there must be something which yearns for the form.> So only mati.er can desire adornment, just as the female desires the male, and what is shapeless longs for beauty. Meanwhile, the shapelessness of matter is accidental rather than essential to it. No doubt, matter comes to be and perishes. When it comes to he, it exists to some extent, and when it perishes, it does to some extent not exist; and its ruin proceeds from the privation which is inseparable from it. Matter itself is potentially immortal and without a beginning, not by nature, because it was necessary that, underlying all things which come to be, some older substra-tum should exist from which things could arise and come-to-be. Now such is this nature of matter. Therefore, matter necessarily existed before it originated, because everything else arises out of it; and if a thing dissolves and perishes, it must finally return to this substratum: consequently it will also have perished before its ruin and dissolution. First of all Calcidius' translation should be compared with the text of Aristotle, Phys. 192 a 3 ss.

Instead of -ro μ~ ov Calcidius mentions privation and matter. He does not say at once that others call them 'the great and small' but puts it in this way: \"Others think privation and matter to be one, but they are wrong, for they call it the great and small\". To this he adds : \"And they make a unity of two things which should be considered apart\". One wonders whether this degression is an incorrect rendering of Aristotle's ~ -ro cruvocμqi6-re:pov ~ -ro xwptc; hix-re:pov, which includes the concepts 'apart' and 'together'. At the same time he adds what Aristotle states at the end of the passa-ge, viz., that these authors think one principle to underly the bo-dies. But Aristotle says it differently; having stated that his opinion differs from that of these authors, he adds: they have not yet got beyond the idea that something must underly things and so make one principle of it.-One might say that Calcidius' rendering of Aristotle has come right by accident. He gives a correct translation of the following: QUI ETIAM5I DIVIDANT MAIUS ILLUD ET MINUS, UT SINT DUO, AEQUE EX HAC DUITATE UNA RES SIGNIFICATUR, ALIA INTERMITTITUR.

CARENTIA VERO NON ADIUVAT FORMATIONEM, SED POTIUS INPEDIT AC RENITITUR: Calcidius deviates from Aristotle in describing the behaviour of privation. \"If\", the latter says, \"we tum our attention to the xcxxo1toL6v in privation, we might think that it does not exist at all\". Calcidius does not say anything of this xcxxor.OL6v (at the most an allusion to it could be seen in inpedit ac renititur, but these words certainly do not express Aristotle's intention. See, however, par. 288). He only adds that what applies to privation does not apply to matter. This actually shows that the train of Aristotle's argument was not clear to Calcidius, for, whereas the former tries to make the existence of privation pfausible, the latter speaks of it as of a certainty. The addition also changes the connexion with what fol-lows. Aristotle stated the impression that privation does not exist at all, but, in his opinion, this impression is wrong. For-as we may summarize his argument-on the one side there is something divine, good and desirable; on the other there are the two principles. Of these one is said to be contrary to this divine and good thing, the other to yearn for it by nature. Calcidius regards the genitive absolute 6v-roi; yocp -rLvoi; 6dou as indicating the cause of what follows, and he takes the whole as explaining the assertion added by himself. His argument, therefore, is this: \"Being opposed to form, privation counteracts formatior:, as it is contrary to form, since form is some-thing divine and desirable\". However, Aristotle does not think of establishing the causal nexus. He rather states a fact. To bring Calcidius' text more into accord with that of Aristotle, a comma should be placed after carentia in 317, 4 instead of a full stop.

The text runs: QUATENUS QUIA, CUM SPECIES DIVINA RES SIT ET ADPETIBILIS, CONTRARIA EST EI CARENTIA, SIL VA VERO AD PETIT FORMAM ET INLUSTRATIONEM CUPIDAQUE EIUS EST IUXTA NATURAM PROPRIAM.

In what follows Calcidius indeed complies with the doctrine of Aristotle but, again, he construes his own argument, the structure of which differs considerably from his model. According to Aristotle, the authors mentioned (i.e., the defenders of the theory concerning the 'great and small') actually pretend that the contrary principle desires its own destruction. Starting from the thesis that things have some yearning for form, he argues as follows: \"Form in itself cannot desire anything, for it does not lack anything, nor can the contrary principle (for contrasts destroy each other). So only the third principle, viz., the iJAI), can desire something. (Hence such a third principle exists)\". Calcidius formulates this argument dif-ferently. He takes -ro evocv-r(ov in another sense than Aristotle. He translates it with contrarietatem suam, but with -ro eve<v-rLov Aristotle means the same carentia which, in Calcidius, is subject of the phrase. Furthermore, Calcidius at once combines the two passages in which Aristotle uses evocv-r(ov 192 a 19 and 21). PORRO CARENTIA SI ADPETAT FORMAM, ADPETERE EAM NECESSE EST CONTRA-RIETATEM SUAM.

The argument can be corrected by reading autem instead of igitur and by assuming that the actual conclusion is omitted as self-evident.

It seems more plausible that the structure of Calcidius' argument is, in fact, defective, the more so because the words interitum smtm carentia desiderabit strongly remind one of Aristotle's: 't\"O evocv't\"lov opeyea<:locL -nj~ OCU't\"OU cp6opii~.

Calcidius indicates the reason of the first paradoxal statement rather succinctly and vaguely. Only at the words sive quod dis-solvitur it is fully apparent to what extent Calcidius distorted Aristotle's text: a mechanical translation of e:he: cp6dpe:TocL refers to the preceding e:he: yocp iy(yve:To but this is lost in the confusion created by the translator. This translation does not impress one. Only a very small portion of it can be taken as a real translation of Aristotle. And if one would prefer to regard it ~ a paraphrase-which, however, does not seem to have been the purpose of Calcidius-it is scarcely a clarifying one, the more so, since certain details of Aristotle's argument are incorrectly presented. [287] In support of his theory, Aristotle says this about the principles and the nature of matter; but because his words are rather obscure, they need, I think, some further explanation. According to Aristotle, there are three principles of things, viz., form, matter and privation. Form is praised by him as a divine being, equal to the allhighest God, resting on the complete and perfect Good, and, for that reason, desirable. What now is that which desires? Form does not desire itself, he says, for it does not lack anything in order to possess perfec.t beauty, while desire"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 287 89 is only present in beings which lack something. Nor does privation desire form, since in that case it would desire its own destruction: for privation is eliminated by the accession of form and does not remain what it was. So the one possibility is that matter desires adornment and embellishment; for it is misformed not, however, by nature but by privation. For the ugliness of matter consists in this, that matter is deprived of adornment and form; thus it will be bereft of form, like a woman without a husband. \"And for that reason\", he says, \"it desires form just as the female desires the male\", and because it lacks form it yearns for form and adornment. At the same time, it wishes that what is in it as a result of privatio11 should perish and disappear. For both form and privation are contrary ar,d contradictory to each other; if one of them gets the upper hand, it eliminates the other. He says that this desire is Lot the same as that of living creatures. But as we say that a thing that begins to be made, desires completion, so, I think, matter desires form; for it can only flourish, if fom1 joins it. HAEC ARISTOTELES There is a distinct dividing line in the discussion of this passage of Aristotle. From 312, 19 on Aristotle or one of his commentators spoke all the time; here Calcidius comes to the fore, so that the passage which follows is on a level with the introduction (312, 10-19). As there, the assertion that Aristotle assumed three principles is basic. SED QUIA OBSCURIOR SERMO EST About obscuritas, cp. the comment on par. 322 (p. 176). TRES AB EO Cp. 312, 13. SPECIEM LAUDAT Calcidius comments on Phys. 192 a 16 s. C>V't'O<; ycxp 't'LVO<; 6dou Y.CXL &.ycx6ou xcxt E(f)Et'OU which ht: had translated by cum species divina res sit et adpetibilis, leaving out the xcxt &.ycx6ou (317, 3). After the observations above (p. 86) about the translation, only one point remains to be discussed, viz., the fact that from the text of Aristotle Calcidius reads a qualification of the species, not only as a divina res hut even as \"a divine thing similar to the highest God\" (summi dei similem divinitatem). Thus, in a sense, the form becomes a second divinity, and this qualification reminds one immediately of the secundus deus in par. 176, who is said to be identical with providentia or provida mens dei. Moreover, pleno per/ectoque nixam bona should be compared with what follows in par. 176: estque ei (sc. -r<j> v<j>) ex illo (sc., deo) bonitatis haustus, quo tam ipsa ornatur quam cetera,"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"90 THE TREATISE ON MATTER quae ipso auctore honestantur (226, 10-11; cp. above p. 30). The function which Aristotle is said here to attribute to the form is exactly the same as that of the providentia--.·ouc, (mens dei) in paragraph 176. One is, therefore, justified in assuming an identity between the species of par. 287 and the providentia-mens (in-tellectus) dei of par. 176, which in its tum is identical with the ideas (par. 304; 333, 6-7: opera vero eius (sc., opificis dei) intellectus eius sunt, qui a Graecis ideae vocantur; cp. the discussion on this point, p. 135). Now the entire discussion of the essence of Providence in par. 176 was clearly based on the treatment of this !>ubject by Nu-menius (p. 30). Therefore, again, just as in the discussion on the Jews (cp. p. 65), Aristotle's doctrine is interpreted in the spirit of Numenius. Cp. mente intuentur l312, 12; p. 76). PROPTEREAQUE Wrobel's version makes the text unintelligible:; his comma after deformitate should be either placed after cultum or omitted. Silva is the subject of both sit posita and the whole period; formam et cultum are the object of a adpetit to be repeated. CONTRARIA SIQUIDEM Calcidius touches upon one of the basic ideas of Aris-totle's doctrine; cp. in the text quoted: ~ /f hepix μoipix njc, evixv't'Lw-,:;ewc, (192 a 14), 't'O evixv't'(ov (ib., 19, 21). CUPIDITATEM VERO A negation like the one ascribed to Aristotle does not occur in the Physics discussed here. Yet one probably should not look for it elsewhere. The one word perf ectio actually is the clue. It is a truly Aristotelian concept, viz., 't'tAoc,; the e!ooc, is a 't'tAoc, and if matter desires for the e!ooc,, it consequently desires for completion. Therefore, the desire present in matter is like the desire of what has begun for completion. This explanation of the 'desire present in matter' is put into the mouth of Aristotle. (Places for dooc, = 't'tAoc,: Met. 1015 a II; 1041 b 1; Phys. 199 a 32). [288] So, according to Aristotle, form is that which exists really and in the proper sense. Of matter he says that it exists by accident, because by nature it is the recipient of form. Finally, there is that which in the proper sense and really does not exist, viz., privation. Non-existence only applies to matter accidentally, in so far as it suffers something which does not exist in the proper sense, viz., privation. So in one sense matter exists, in another it does not; something may arise out of it, as out of a thing that does not exist, though not in the same but in a different sense. Hence we must say that not matter is evil and the principle"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 288 91 of evil, but privation, for the latter is the shapelessness, ungrace-fullness and ugliness of matter, and therefore evil. This is also why Aristotle definer. or rather calls matter a 'bodiless body', because it is a potential body, not actually and really. This is Aristotle's opinion about matter. He adds that Plato has only nominally touched upon these three principles, in reality indicating only two principles of corporeal things, viz., the form and the 'great and small', viz., matter. \"So these are not three\", he says, \"but two principles, form and matter\", the latter he denies any existence by nature. \"Or if\", he continues, \"we should under-stand the 'great and small' to be privation, then matter is omitted and, again, there are only two principles, viz., form and priva-tion\". ERGO IUXTA ARISTOTELEM Calcidius summarizes the respective relation of form, matter and privation with existence. Wrobel causes confusion by writing rursum of 319, 9 in lower case and ex in 319, 10 with a capital. It should be the other way round, for the rursum ... is on a level with Ergo iuxta (319, 6); Ex accidenti ... with ex accidenti (319, 7). ERGO SILVA Cp. aliquatenus est, ali-quatenus non est (315, 16-17 and 317, 15-17). CONSEQUENTER ERGO Calcidius concludes that, therefore, not matter but privation is the source of evil. This is inferred from the fact that, contrary to priv-ation, matter is not simply non-existent; in other words, to him, the idea of evil is connected with non-existence. Actually, Calcidius says so himself: haec (carentia) est enim informitas et nullus cultus et turpitudo silvae, proptereaque etiam maleficentia. Compare with this 329, 19-20: M alitiam porro aiunt virtutis esse carentiam, ut informitatem, inopiam, intemperantiam. In fact, Calcidius may have read this in Physics I 9, which he left untranslated above (see p. 85), viz., 192 a 14 SS.: ~ o' hepoc μo'i:poc tji; &VOCV\"C'LW<rEWi; 7tOAACXXLi; (XV (!)OCV\"C'OCa0Ell) Tei> 1tpoi; \"C' 0 X oc X O 7t O L O V ocutji; tX\"C'EVl~oV\"C'L 't'1)V OLCXVOLOCV o u o' e ! v oc L To 1tocpcx1tocv. Here too there is connexion between evil and non-existence. The xocxo1tot6v is found in Calcidius' maleficentia. It may be that this is an elaboration of Calcidius.

HAEC ARISTOTELIS Concluding his treatise with the words: Haec ... sententia, Calcidius"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"92 THE TREATISE ON MATTER adds a remark which is no more than a further explanation of Physics 192 a 10 ss., where Aristotle says that Plato has overlooked one of the three principles, in whatever sense his 'great and small' may be understood. Nisi quad certainly translates the Greek 1tA~v OTL (cp. Physics 187 a r8, also in connexion with this theory of Plato). The manner of expression is not always correct: Aristotle could scarcely have said that Plato only mentioned the three principles (nominibtts tantum attigisse): what he said is that Plato used three names, viz., form and 'the great and small'. Next Calcidius elaborates the point that, to Aristotle, Plato at all events overlooked one of the principles: either matter or privation (~v yocp &Tepcxv 1tcxp-e:~oe:v 192 a 12). He gives the impression of quoting Aristotle literally but the elaboration is his own work. ET SILVA A striking parallel of these words is 175, 1-3: vel cum idem Plato silvam esse dicit in nulla substantia, propterea quad nulla silvestria habeant ullam perfectionem, which is an obvious allusion to Tim. 50E: dLO x.ott 1tiVTWV EX.Toe; dowv ELVotL xpe:~v TO Tot 1tiVTot EX.Oe:~6μe:vov ev otuTi;> yev\"I), for perfectio renders dooc;, as we saw above. To my knowledge, Aristotle has nothing where Plato is said to describe matter in thi~ way. Hence it is more than doubtful whether Cal-cidius had a definite text in view. In the light of the parallels just quoted one would like to think here of a formulation by the author himself. Above Calcidius evidently appropriates Aristotelian data, for the text continues: dum enim sunt adhitc silvestria, informia sunt ac s£ne or dine ac specie, ut sax a ; quomm ta men est naturalis possibilitas, ut accedente artificio simulacrum fiat vel quid aliud huius modi. Quad vero sola possibilitate et sine effectu videtur esse, minime est, utpote carens perfectione (175, 3-6). Both the present text and the parallel seem to be based on Physics I 8-9. Hence quam (ait) ex natura nullam habere substantiam may be taken for a formulation by the author himself, as it doe~ not occur in Aristotle. The conclusion is that the whole passage on Aristotle (par. 283-288), a fairly faithful rendering of his thoughts, is provided with an introduction and a final reflection. These seem to betray some influence of Numenius. The description of Aristotle's doctrine may have come to Calcidius through a commentator: involuntarily one thinks of the orthodox Aristotelian Adrastus from whom Calcidius has borrowed so much elsewhere. Calcidius' translation of Aristotle occasionally betrays a dubious mastery of the subject."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 289 93 (b) The Stoics [289] The Stoics also reject the idea that matter came into being. They rather regard matter and God as the two principles of everything existing, viz., God as the Maker and matter as that which undergoes the making. In their opinion, both Maker and matter have the same essence (for they are corporeal) but a different power. One principle is God because He operates, the other matter because it comes into existence. Explaining their opinion will not be without advantage. They state: as all copper things are copper and all silver things silver, so all corporeal things are matter, since the con-dition of all other things is like that of copper or silver things. For one thing is more material than the other, one is more corpo-real than the other, but all have the one underlying and com-mon matter as their principle. And as a statue, though being a moulded body, has the earlier substance of bronze as its sub-stratum, so bronze, which is an unmoulded body yet not without quality, has a still earlier substance as its substratum, viz., a continuous body without quality, entirely passive and changeable. This they called matter and also essence, and defined it as follows: essence and matter is 'that which is the substratum of all bodies', or 'that from which all bodies come forth' or 'that in which all changes in the sensible world occur, while 'that' itself perseveres in its own condition'. And also: 'that which underlies the corpo-real things possessing qualities, whereas it is by nature without quality itself'.

Alexander of Aphrodisias attacks the Stoic theory that both principles, God and matter, are corporeal (S. V.F. II 310). Plutarch also states that, according to the Stoa, God and matter alike are corporeal. QUIA FACIAT, DEUM, QUIA FIAT, SILVAM FORE Seneca, Ep. 65, 23: N empe universa ex materia et ex deo constant. Deus ista temperat, quae circumfusa rectorem secuntur et ducem. Potentius autem est ac pretiosius quod facit, quod est deus, quam materia patiens dei. QUORUM AB RE What precedes was a general introduction similar to the preface (312, ro ss.) of the treatise on Aristotle. AIUNT ENIM Calcidius refers to the well-known argument of the Stoics (cp. Baumker, o.c., p. 330) but fails to express himself clearly: \"as all copper things are copper and all silver ones silver, so all bodily things are material\". The second half of his simile should have been an argument: \"so all bodily are body; body we call 'matter', so matter is a body\". The difference between things can, ultimately, be reduced to being body in a greater or lesser degree (corpulentior = awμixTLXWTe:poc;). This is illustrated in the example of the bronze statue which Aristotle uses in a somewhat different way. This statue is a corpus formatum (et qualitate praedi-tum). Its material is bronze, a corpus informe sed compos qualitatis, which, based in its turn on matter, is corpus alone. Thus the three degrees in corporeality are : r) corpus, 2) corpus compos qualitatis, 3) corpus formatum. Of mere corpus Calcidius says that, according to the Stoa, it is cohaerens sine qualitate, patibile totum et commutabile. COHAERENS = continuus cp. par. 275. SINE QUALITATE = &1totoc;. The formula of the Stoa is awμix &1totov (cp. Baumker, o.c., p. 333). PATIBILE TOTUM ET COMMUTABILE As to the relation of this phrase to ipso statu pruprio manente which occurs further on, we may refer to the discussion of par. 268 (299, 18) : cum a natura propria non recedat (p. 32). The solution given there also holds for the present passage on the Stoa. SILVAM SIMUL ET ESSENTIAM Aristotle also speaks of matter as ouab: hut with some reserve, Met. 1029 a Is.: fLCXALO'TIX ycxp 8oxe:i: e:LVIXL OUO'(IX TO ur.oxdμe:vov 1tpWTOV.

Baumker says (o.c., p. 331): \"Wahrend aber Aristoteles die Materie in erster Linie im Gegensatz zu der bestimmenden Form betrachtet, neben welchem Gegensatz der des Aktiven und des Passiven erst in zweiter Reihe inbetracht kommt, liegt bei den Stoikem die Sache umge-kehrt. Weil ... der Begriff der Formalursache ihnen in den der thatigen Kraft sich auflost, so ist ihnen die Materie vor allem das Leidende\". Cp. J. Moreau, L'.Ame du Monde de Platon aux Stoiciens, Paris, 1939, p. 135, n. ro ). For the oua(oc of everything is awμoc, is UAl), (Diog. Laert., VII 139: TY)V 1howv oua(ocv, '\")V UAl)V s. V.F. II 300). HACTENUS DEFINIENTES Calcidius gives four definitions, the first three of which seem to belong together. One may even feel inclined to add ipso statu proprio manente to these three definitions, which may be a threefold attempt to express the same thing, though each has its characteristic. QUOD SUBIACET CORPORI CUNCTO reminds us of Aristotle's u1toxdμe:vov 1tpw-rnv (cp. p. 31 ). EX QUO SUNT CUNCTA CORPORA This is, of course, the E~ OU of Aristotle. See also Diog.

As in the passage just quoted one is strongly reminded, again, of Calcidius' own description in par. 268, which was founded on Plato's words (Tim. 50B: Totti'TOV OCU'T~V cxd 1tpo<rpl)\"t'EOV.

It is remarkable that the De oratione of Origen has a si:rnilar series of definitions, ascribed there to \"the authors who think that the awμocToc come in the first place and the cxawμocToc in the second\".

Moreover, there is a similarity in many details."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"96 THE TREATISE ON MATTER In Origen too, the last two definitions are strongly Platonic in their formulation, especially the last but one (1Xva,J..o(c.>'rov xaTix Tov t8tov Myov). Furthermore, in Origen these definitions are descrip-tions of the concept oua(a. Up to a short distance before these defini-tions, Calcidius was continuously occupied with the concept silva ( = ut:1)) but just before he comes to these definitions, he suddenly introduces the term essentia ( = oua(a). And just like Origen he begins his definition with Essentia ... Still, the similarity between Calcidius and Origen is not such that it compels one to assume direct dependence. A common source, Numenius perhaps, is much more obvious. This assumption is supported by what follows. [290] However, a great many (Stoics) distinguish between matter and essence, as did Zeno and Chrysippus. \"Matter\", they say, \"is that which underlies everything possessing quality, whereas essence is the primary matter or ultimate basis of every-thing, which by itself is without appearance and form. Thus, for instance, bronze, gold, iron and such like are the matter of all things made from them, but not their essence, whereas that which is the cause of the existence of these and everything else is indeed the substance (i.e. essence)\". By itself the circumscription of the term silva might also include the essentia. The examples, however, clarify the author's intention. Cp. Diog. Laert., VII 150: OU<rtav oe cpa<rt \"C'WV OV\"C'WV CX:7tCXV\"C'WV \"C'YJV 7tpWTIJV UA'YjV, W<;; xat Xpu<rL7t7tO<;; ev tji 1tpWT7l \"C'WV cpu<rtXWV xat Z~vwv.

[291] A great many (Stoics) also distinguish between matter and essence in this way: \"Essence\", they say, \"is the foundation of a work, so that we may rightly speak and think of an essence of the world, but of matter we speak with respect to the Maker, because He moulds and forms it\". According to these authors, the two terms denote the same reality but seen from different viewpoints. It is 'essence', if seen as fundamentum operis-perhaps definable as 'that out of which some-thing is made' -but it is 'matter', if seen as 'that by means of which"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 290-292 97 the Maker operates'. In other words, seen from the work it is essence, seen from the Maker it is matter. This distinction occurs in Arius who ascribes it to Posidonius: otoccplpm OE tjv ouofav njc; tl\"), , , , 1\" , , , , , , , (Ep ·e Ul\\'YJ<;, TIJV <IXUTIJV> OUO\"IXV XIX't'IX TIJV U7tOO\"'t'IX(HV, E7tLVOL~ μovov t ., fr. 20, Dox. Gr. 458. Maybe the terms /undamentum and contem-platione in Calcidius reflect u1tocrToccrtc; and emvo(oc in this text). [292] Zeno further says of this essence that it is limited and the one common substance of all that exists. It is also divisible and totally variable, for its parts are always changing, but they do not perish in the sense of passing from existence to nothing-ness. But just as iu the case of innumerable different forms, for instance those of wax <none of these forms being proper to wax>, so, in his opinion, matter, the basis of everything, has not a single form or shape of its own nor by itself a single quality, yet it is always inseparable from one quality or another. And because it is without origin or end-for there is no question in it of arising out of nothing nor of passing away into nothing-, from eternity it is not without a spirit and a power which with reason is at times moving it as a whole, at times only as a part of it, and which causes the so frequent and violent changes in the universe. Moreover, this driving force is, in his opinion, not nature, but a soul, and a rational soul at that, which bestowed life upon the sensible world and equipped it with the beauty which now adorns it. They call the world a blessed being and God. DEINDE ZENO Everything in this section is given as Zeno's theory but, in fact, it is the general doctrine of the Stoa. Calcidius knows this, which is evident from the unexpected plural appellant at the end. Calcidius uses the Stoic term for 'matter', viz., essentia, as explained shortly before (p. 96). FINITAM According to the Stoa, the world is limited and surrounded by the boundless empty space, the void (S.V.F. I 94-96; II 534 ss. Finitum esse mundum et unitum, sed circumdatum inani in/inito; III 32, 43 (Antipater)). The world with the void they called TO 1tiiv, the world without it TO o}.ov; Aet., Plac.

SUBSTANTIAM Already in par. 291 Calcidius used the term substantia instead of essentia. DIVIDUAM This time, of course, the term should not be taken as in 305, 18, where it means divisam. Here it is 'divisible'. This divisibility is a result of the corporeal nature of matter, as Chrysippus had already made out; cp. Stab., Eel.

Baumker (o.c., 339) observes that in the doctrine of the Stoics the mutability of matter is more emphasized than ir. Aristotle. Considering their concept of matter this is obvious. Yet they agree with Plato when he says that matter in statu proprio manet (see 320, 23 and the comment p. 95). PARTES QUIPPE Calcidius explains how this mutability must be understood. A change of all matter is impossible, only one of parts. This same idea is expressed by Stobaeus, who also studies the divisibility of matter; S. V.F. II 317: 8Loc(peaLv 8e xocl.

CUMQUE TAM Calcidius makes the Stoics say: \"Since matter is without beginning or end, i.e. eternal, the other principle-its existence is supposed without any proof here, as in par. 293 (323, 3-5)-is eternal as well\". Thus the stress is on ex aeternitate. SPIRITUS ET VIGOR i.e. 1tVeu1.1.oc xocl. -.6voc;; (Cp. S. V.F. II 439 ss.). QUI MOVEAT Here, it seems, Calcidius alludes to the well-known theory of Zeno about a periodic recurrence which is manifest in both the cosmos as a whole and its separate parts. Hence the last words must refer to the ecpyrosis. SPIRITUM This principle, Calcidius warns us, should not be taken for nature: it is a rational soul-hence he said: qui moveat rationabiliter-pervading the cosmos and moulding it (cp. J. Moreau, L'Ame du Monde, p. 158 ex.; see also S.V.F. II 1047). Spiritus seems to be a term of Cleanthes not of Zeno. In Apol. 21 Tertullian says: Haec Cleanthes in spiritum"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 292-293 99 congerit, quem permeatorem universitatis affirmat. Already Verbeke (Kleanthes van Assos, Brussel, 1949, p. 188) thought that Calcidius does not restrict himself here to Zeno's theory. This also appears from the plural appellant (322, 10). For vivificans cp. 300, 14-15: sed perinde ut natura atque anima solida corpora permeantes universa vivificant. There too natura and anima are mentioned as two real-ities. exornaverit ... venustatem. The terms used by Calcidius here strongly remind one of the terminology in par. 295 (Numenius) and 354. BEATUM ANIMAL ET DEUM The world is called 6e6(; in Plato's Timaeus 34B: -rov ... fo6μevov 6e6v and a little further: Llta 7tlXV't'ot 0~ 't'OCU't'ot euooclμovoc 6eov OCU't'OV E)'&W~(1ot't'O. For the Stoa, cp. S. V.F. II 528: \"OAov oe -rov x.6aμov auv -ro~(; eocu-rou μepeat 1tpoaoc-, 6 , -~, rt , T , , .. /.. yopeuouat e o v · -rou-rov oe i:;voc μovov e~VotL i:potaL x.oct 1te1tepocal\"\"\"vov x.oct ~ <j> o v x.oct cHotov x.oct 6 e 6 v , and finally Plutarch in De Stoic. repugn.: 6eov Tolvuv voouμev ~ <j> o v μ oc x. ix p Lo v (ib., III 33, p. 249). [293] Thus, according to the Stoa, the body of the world is limited, is one, is a whole and is an essence: a whole, because it does not lack a single part; one, because its parts are inseparable and together form a coherent whole; an essence, because it is the primary matter of all bodies, (through this primary matter, they say, all-penetrating reason passes as seed passes through the genitals, and this reason, in their opinion, is the Creator Himself), a coherent body, without quality, entirely passive and variable: such, according to them, is matter or essence. It changes but does not perish, neither wholly nor partly, for all philosophers agree that nothing arises out of nothing, nor anything passes away into nothing, (for, although all bodies are subject to some process of decomposition, matter always exists as well as the Maker God, that is reason, in which [whom] it is fixed at whatever time anything arises and perishes). And so we can only speak of arising out of something that exists and of perishing into something that exists. Meanwhile, the things immortal, viz., that by which a thing arises and that out of which it arises, remain. ERGO CORPUS Calcidius draws conclusions from what precedes. Like the treatise on Aristotle the present one on the Stoa consists of three parts: 1) introduction (par. 289a), 2) explanation of the doctrine (par. 289b-292), 3) conclusions (par. 293-294).

TOTUM is probably the translation of l>Aov, which is constantly in the mind of the Stoics. Calcidius explains it in the following way: outside it there is nothing, it does not lack anything. There is only empty space outside it, as we saw. UNUM AUTEM It forms one whole; there is no empty space in it; for eohaerent, see eohaerens in 320, 18 and 322, 18. ESSENTIA VERO essentia = substantia = the Stoic oucrlot. After par. 290 the ex-pression prineeps silva is not surprising. The essentia is the primary matter; cp. also Arius Didym., fr. 20 (Dox.

PER QUAM This ratio is another term for spiritus in the previous section, which spiritus already appeared to be a anima rationalis. With the adject-ives solidam atque universam Calcidius seems to indicate that this ratio pervades everything; perhaps it is the Latin rendering of o).ov oL' o).ou or xpiimc; oL' o).ou, often read in Stoic texts, for instance, S.V.F.

Nobody will fail to notice how this summary is greatly superior to that of the preceding section. [294] The Stoics also criticize Plato for saying that, because exemplars of all things exist of old in another sublime and most excellent substance, the sensible world was made by God after an immortal exemplar. In their opinion, no exemplar is needed, because a fertilizing reason, pervading an entirely susceptible nature, brought the whole world and all that it contains into existence. This is what the Stoics say about matter and the principles of things, partly basing themselves on Plato, partly expressing thoughts of their own. And thus it is easy to understand that they could not have an inkling of a divine power and an incorporeal being more powerful than all bodies, more powerful even than all seeds. It is in this way that they arrived at the impious opinion, viz., that God is identical with or even an inseparable quality of matter, that He passes through it as seed through the geni-tals, and that He is both origin and cause of everything that comes into being, not only of what is bad but also of what is shameful and obscene, and that He does and suffers everything, even what is shameful. The ugliness of this doctrine will be more patent still after the explanation of Plato's doctrine. REPREHENDUNT \"The Stoics\", Calcidius says, \"blame Plato who, on account of the existence of a sublime reality containing within itself the exemplars of everything, assumes that the world was made after an immortal example, for, so they say, no example was needed for the creation of the world. SEMINUM RATIO seems a variant of the well-known ratio seminalis. It mostly occurs in the plural as a translation of MyoL a1tepμcx-rLxo(, but the singular is also"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"102 THE TREATISE ON MATTER found, for instance in Diog.

However, seminum ratio may also be taken in the sense of 'a system of seeds'. In which case Calcidius must have taken the metaphor in a concrete sense; the accent, then, is on seminum rather than on ratio. The words vel etiam seminibiis effi-caciorem (323, 19) definitely· favour the latter interpretation. HAEC STOICI DE SIL VA Once more a similarity with the passage on Aristotle should be noted: H aec A ristotelis de s£lva sententia (319, 20). As there, Calcidius continues here with a criticism of the relevant doctrine. PARTIM A PLATONE USURPANTES, namely that part in the Stoic doctrine which is in accordance with Plato's doctrine, or rather with Calci<lius' explanation of it. PARTIM COMMENT! These are the points which the author attacks in the Stoa. Of course, these words primarily reflect upon the doctrine on the Godhead; in Calcidius' opinion the Stoics did not arrive at anything beyond what is corporeal.

I found this Jeductio in no other source, although it is quite obvious (cp. Cale., 1()2, 21-22). CUIUS OPINIONIS Cal-cidius refers to a refutation of the Stoa still to come. He probably means par. 308b ss., especially par. 3n. The structure of the treatise on the Stoic doctrine is strikingly similar to that of Aristotle. :::-ince a certain number of Numenian"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 295 103 dernents occur in the latter it is obvious that one looks for them again. So far nc• decisive indication of such an influence has heen found. This is now furnished by the opening phrc:1.se of the next section. Calcidius says: Nu,menius ex J>ythagorae magisterio Stoico·mm hoe de initiis dogma refellens ... So Numenius did refute the Stoa, and more traces of this follow. It seems clear enough that Numenius also explained and refuted the other tenets of the Stoa, an<l that Calcidius derived the material of these paragraphs from him. Because of the Numeniana in the paragraphs on Aristotle one may go further and assume that N umenius was Calcidius' doctrinal source for his reflections both on Aristotle and on the Stoa. It is, of course, impossible to define the extent of the dependence but a dependence upon Numenius for the paragraphs on Aristotle and the Stoics can no longer be denied. ( c) Pythagoras [ 295] Now the doctrine of Pythagoras must be discussed. The Pythagorean N umenius attacks this Stoic doctrine of the principles on the basis of the doctrine of Pythagoras (with which, in his opinion, Plato's doctrine is in complete accordance), and he says that Pythagoras calls the Godhead the monad, matter the dyad. Now, according to Pythagoras, in as far as this dyad is indeten::lined it did not originate but in so far as it is determined it has an origin. In other words: before it was adorned with form and order, it was without beginning or origin, but its generation was the adornment and embellishment by the Godhead who regulated it. Since, therefore, this generation is a later event, the unadorned and unborn substance should be held to be as old as God by whom it was regulated. But some Prthagoreans misunder-stood this theory and came to think that also this unqualified and linlitless dyad was produced by the only ~nd alone monad and that, thus, the monad abandoning its own nature assumed the appearance of the dyad. But this is wroug, because in this case that which was, the monad, would cease to exist and that which was not, the dyad, would come into being, and God would be changed into matter and the monad into the unqualified and limitless dyad. Even to people of mediocr,~ education this is obviously impossible. Finally, the Stuics say that matter is determined and limited by nature, but Pythagoras that it is"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER undetermined and limitless. Where the former think that what is limitless by nature cannot be reduced to order and measure, Pythagoras asserts that this is exactly the power and might of God alone, viz., that He can easily do what nature cannot do, since He is mightier and more sublime than any power and that nature itself derives its strength from Him. NUNC 1AM PYTHAGORICUM DOGMA RECENSEATUR It is remark-able that only now Calcidius comes to discuss the doctrine of Pytha-goras, whereas all the other philosophers (except, of course, Plato) were treated in their historical order. This departure from the scheme is not sufficiently explained by the fact that not the doc-trine of Pythagoras himself but that of Numenius is reported. The only possible explanation is that Calcidius thought the doctrine of Pythagoras particularly important. NUMENIUS EX PYTHAGORAE MAGISTERIO The expression ex Pythagorae magisterio is to be noted, for one must not forget that Calcidius comments upon the Timaeus. Now the man after whom this dialogue is called, was also ex Pythagorae magisterio, as Calcidius has said in the introduction. And elsewhere: I ste enim Timaeus, qui in hoe libro tractat, ex Pytha-gorae magisterio fuit (n9, 3). This circumstance points out that the Pythagorean doctrine, now to be explained, is of special importance to Calcidius, and that this is why he discusses it last, immediately before the doctrine of Plato himself. This fits precisely into Cal-cidius' scheme; the opinion which he considers to be the right one is at the end (see par. 301; 30-31; 226 ss.). A particularly interesting question is whether Calcidius trans-lates literally or rather freely with a personal rendering of the Neo-Pythagorean ideas. The former alternative appears to contain the truth. First, Calcidius frequently uses the oratio obliqua; secondly, Numenius' name is mentioned four times and, thirdly, the style of this passage differs from Calcidius' usual way of writing. It recalls more than once (especially in par. 298) what Leemans (E.-A. Leemans, Studie over den Wifsgeer Numenius van Apamea, met ieitgave der fragmenten, Memoires Acad. Royale de Belgique, Ile Ser. T. XXXVII, Bruxelles, 1935, p. 19) characterized as typical of Numenius: \"The language is full of images, somewhat turgid, the construction often mannered, the style verbose\" (cp. ib., p. 22: \"Synonyms with unnoticable difference in meaning are constantly juxtaposed\"). Finally, the dependence on Numenius is confirmed"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 295 by the words ut in Timaeo loquitur Plato (327, 3); Borghorst (o.c., p. 37) already observed that this remark is quite out of place in a commentary on the Timaeus, unless Calcidius is translating literally or, at least, closely following a text which formed no part of a commentary on this dialogue. CUI CONCINERE DICIT DOGMA PLATONICUM In N umenius' doctrine this statement is of the greatest importance, on account of his theory concerning a gradual decrease of the knowledge of Truth in the course of history. A philosopher's greatest merit is to preserve parts of Truth in spite of everything. Numenius says this of Plato who, because of his adherence to the older philosopher Pythagoras, has preserved so much of the Truth. 'Going back' (ocvixx.wp~crixcr6cxt} in time as much as is possible is necessary to him who occupies himself with philosophical problems. He should not restrict himself to studying the arguments of Plato and Pythagoras but, even more, what \"famous old people-who were nearer to Truth-taught in their mysteries and sages\" (cp. H. Ch. Puech, Numenius d'Apamee, in Melanges Bidez II, Bruxelles, 1934, p. 745-787). The reference to the veteres theologi in par. 296 should be seen in this connexion. Numenius undoubtedly derived much from Plato for the de-scription of Pythagoras' doctrine. The usual description of Py-thagoras' doctrine in Antiquity must owe as much to Plato's system as Plato actually owed to Pythagoras. (The same applies to the influence of the Stoics on what they present as the doctrine of Heraclitus; cf. Moreau, o.c., p. 158). However, this influence of Plato on Numenius is not yet a reason for calling Numenius a Platonist, as Zeller did on the example of Jamblichus and Proclus. AIT PYTHAGORAN It has been said above (p. 43) that Calcidius mentions numbers as the essence of things, and the monad with the dyad as the principles of these numbers. Furthermore, in par. 39, discussing the diagram of numbers in Tim. 35E, where the figure I is at the top, he identifies the monad with God, ~aying: nullam dico aptiorem esse figuram quam est haec, in qua singularitas cacumini superinposita s1,mmitatem atque arcem obtinere consideratur, ut per eam velut emissaculum quoddam tamquam e sinu fontis perennis providae intellegentiae quasi quidam largus amnis effluat, ipsaque singularitas mens sive intellegentia vel ipse deus opijex intellegatur esse. It is quite clear that all these texts have a Pythagorean origin; Switalski (o.c., p. 42) already noticed this with regard to par. 53-55, the content of which he, too, derived from Numenius. The termin-"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"106 THE TREATISE 0'!11 MATTER ology also shows features which are known to be Nnmenian (ad par. 268, p. 30). Switalski (I.e.) sees this influence of N umenius also in the fact that in par. 55 Calcidius, touching upon the doctrine of the Jews, denotes it with tht words doctrina sectae sanctioris. These words suit Numenius, who had a greater e'/ef·m for the Jewish doctrine than the Christian Calcidius who himself would not have introduced here this comparison 1). Moreover, in a similar passage in par. 300 concerning the two world-souls, Calcidius again draws support from the doctrine of the Jews. All these passages are mutually connected and evidently derived from Numenius. In the fragments of N umenius himsdf one also finds the monad and the dyad as the principles of things, there connected with the doctrine of the threefold godhead (already met with in Calcidius, see ad par. 268, p. 30): Eusebius, Praep.

It is frequently said that Pythagoras taught this doctrine of the monad and thP dyad, but one wonders how far its application, as defended here, is derived from other philosophers, especially Plato. In this connexion Zeller (o.c., III 2, p. 129) remarks: \"Den alten Pythagoreern hatten in dicser Beziehung die Zahlen und die Elemente der Zahlen geniigt; die neuen fiihren sie selbst auf hohere Ursachen zuriick.

Jn my opinion, in this text is an unexpected example of Numenius' method of talking about Jewish data, combining them with those from othe,· sources. Num<'nius presents the Jews as maintaining that, after making the sen'iible world, God created the human body by taking earth and moulding it after the P-xample (ii,xta effigiem) of the sensible world. Here he clearly has in mind the parallelism between macrocosmos and micro-cusmos, probahly thinking that in this way one can explain Gen. I 26: 1tot~awμcv &v6pw1tov xa:-r' e:tx611c: 7Jμe:-rtpot11 xa:t xa:IJ' 6μ0£<>,atv. This interpretation is justified by what follows. Numenius says: God took man's life from the stars (vitam vero eidem ex convexis accersisse caelestibus), but afterwards breathed into him the rational soul (postque intimis eius inspirationem proprio f latu intimasse, inspirationem hanc dei wnsilium animae rationemque signifi-cans) ; just like he r(:presents God as taking life from the stars, he lets Him mould the body after the example of the cosmos-a clear combination of Platonic and biblical data. It is typical of Calcidius that he copied this interpretation without introducing the Christian point of view."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"P,\\RAGRAPH 295 gang der alten Akademit', die unbestimmte Zweihcit genannt wird.

Calcidius adopts this standpoint. Another Christian, viz., Hermogenes, agrees with him as appears from Tertullian, Adv. Hermog. 4, 4: materiam parem deo infert, which is much the same as the aequaeviim deo in the quotation from N umenius. SED NON NULLOS In Pythagoreism there existed alongside each other a dualistic and a monistic theory. According to Numenius, the adherents of the latter misunderstood the vim sententiae (i.e., the theory that matter was generated). This monistic view is known from elsewhere. Diog. Laertius states that Alexander Polyhistor tound it in some Pythagorean memoirs. This theory teaches 'Apxriv μev <X1tOCV'rCuV μovoc8oc, h ae T~<; μovoc8ot; &6pLG'rOV 8uoc8oc, Wt; !XV UAYJV -tjj μovoc8L IXLTLCp OVTL U1tOGTIJVIXL (VIII 25.

In addition to the passages quoted Leemans cites a fragment of Philolaus (Diels, Fragm. der Vorsocr., fr. 8, I 312) and texts of Eudorus and Moderatus (Simplicius, In Phys. 181, 17 and 231, 5).

NON RECTE This monistic theory is in conflict with the old thesis-frequently repeated by Calcidius-that there is no room for a coming-to-be or perishing as such; so no dyad can arise from a monad. \"This is clear even to a man with little understanding\". Once again, one is reminded of the fact that Calcidius rejects the doctrine of the Jews that matter was created, but follows Numenius and all other Greek philosophers. DENIQUE STOICOS For the doctrine ot the Stoics see 321, 15 and 322, u-12. CUMQUE ILLI The statement of the Stoa attacked by Numenius (Pythagoras) runs as follows: What is infinite by nature camiot be ordered. The statement is rather unusual. Cleomedes (S.V.F. II 534), however, writes this: ou μ~v &1te:Lp6<; ye:, cxlloc 1te:1te:pocaμe:vo<; EGTLV ( o x6aμo<;), Wt; 'rOU'rO a~AOV ex TOU U1t0 (f)UGEW<; IXUTOV 8LOLXELCJ61XL.

What Cleo-medes means is this : \"Nature must dominate (in a way, embrace) that of which it is the nature; what is infinite cannot be embraced. Hence there is no nature of something infinite\". This conclusion is also expressed by Numenius. But he does not speak of 'what is infinite', but of 'what is infinite by nature'. This is not really differ-ent, but one may ask whether Numenius (or Calcidius) did not think of a text like that of Cleomedes and take the term 'nature' in a different sense. The argument ascribed by Numenius to Pythagoras (solius hanc dei fore virtutem) is similar to that of the Jews in paragraph 278. There the question was about a creation out of nothing, without pre-existing matter; whereas all other things-even nature itself-receive matter from something else, God does not receive matter from anywhere. Could Numenius here derive his argument from a Jewish-Christian source? Anyhow, this kind of argument cannot have impressed the Stoics greatly, for it is based on the supposition that God is transcendent with respect to nature (ut qui sit omni virtute potentior). Calcidius himself observed (322, 17-19) that the Stoa is incapable of such a thought. ET A QUO Cp. the statement of the Jews just quoted where it is said that nature receives matter from God; here it receives power from him. [296] Thus Pythagoras also thinks, Numenius says, that matter is fluid and without qualities; in his opinion it is not what it is according to the Stoics, viz., something intermediate between good and evil, which they call 'indifferent', but, on the contrary, absolutely harmful. For to him, as to Plato, God is the principle and cause of all good, matter of all evil. However, that which proceeds from form and matter is indifferent: so not matter but the world being a mixture of the goodness of form and the badness of matter is indifferent. Not without reason do the old theologians think it to have been generated out of Providence and necessity. IGITUR PYTHAGORAS Numenius ascribes the idea of the chaos to Pythagoras: hence igititr. Plato held this too: hence quoque. Fluidam is the typical word for the condition of matter. Leemans refers to another text of Numenius: 7to'rocμoc; ycx:p ~ l)Al) pow8l)c; XIXL o~uppo1toc; (fr. 12). One may also quote from Macrobius, In Somn. Seip.:"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"IIO THE TREATISE ON MATTER ... silvestrem tumultum, id est, {))..'YJv influentem (test. 47, p. 107, 14-15); and also: materialis influxio ...

I 8, 2 = Xenocrates, fr. 28 Heinze). Leemans is correct in observing that this text points to the antiquity of this metaphor. As already observed, one needs only to think of Plato's secondary matter. SINE QUALITATE Aris-totle, Plato, Pythagoras and the Stoa agree on this point (see ad 312, 10, p. 75). How is noxia to be combined with this? Chrysippus bases the indifference of matter on the lack of quality of matter, as we shall see. NEC TAMEN Chrysippus (Plut., De comm. notit. 1076 C-D) teaches: OU yocp ~ y' l)A'Yj \"CO XIXXOV E~ eixu-nji; 1tocpEO'J.'YjX&V' &1t0Loi; ycxp EO\"'CL XOCL 1tCXO'oci; 6aoci; 8e;x_&TOCL 8Locqiopoci; U1t0 TOU XLVOUVToi; ocutjv ... lax e. Perhaps N umenius reacts against these words, according to Leemans. The latter adds: M ateriam fontem esse malorem iam veteres Pythagorei adserunt (Dox. Gr. 302), quibus consentiunt omnes Pla-tonici et Pythagorici recentiores. With the stress on the contrasts deus-silva, bonum-malum this theory, obviously, fits into that of Pythagoras. Numenius explicitly formulated this. UT ETIAM PLATONI VIDETUR The locus classicus is, of course, the text on the bad world-soul in the Laws, to which Numenius is soon to refer (326, 12 ss.; cp. 328, 19). Moreover, there was to him already a hint in cxvcxyx'Yj (necessitas); Calcidius spoke of rigor necessitatis (301, 3). In par. 298-299 Numenius studies the condition of matter, referring to the Timaeus. Aristotle emphatically takes \"CO xocxo1toL6v away from matter, which implies that he ascribed the other opinion to Plato, as Numenius does here. It is confirmed by Met. 988 a 14-15: tjv TOU &U xoct TOU xocxwi; OCLTLOC'J TOLi; O'\"COLX&LOLi; (i.e., TO iv xoct ~ 8ucxi;) cx1tt8euxev exocTtpoLi; exixTepixv. AT VERO Suddenly species appears here instead of deus. This fits in whith the doctrine of the Stoa, although it is also found in the comment on Aristotle: Speciem laudat ut summi dei similem divinitatem (318, 4-5), a text which reminded us of Numenius. Species is voui;, a term which Numenius applies to the godhead, also the highest God. (Cp. Prod., In Tim. III, 103, 28 (Leemans, test. 25), where there is question of the first, second and third voui;, evidently a pointing to the three phases of the godhead. Here Numenius differs from Calcidius, who (par."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 297 III 176, see ad par. 268) speaks of the second God as vout; and thus seems to favour Plotinus, who beyond the vout; postulates a higher supranoetic God). NON ERGO Matter is bad, the species is good. This sounds like Plato's speculation on the good, but it recalls above all what Calcidius says ir. par. 176 (cp. ad par. 268, p. 30) about the providentia or vout;, the second God, who, as seen just now, is connected with the species: Est autem intellegibilis essentia aemulae bonitatis propter indefessam ad summum deum conversionem estque ei ex illo bonitatis haustus, quo tam ipsa ornatur quam cetera quae ipso auctore honestantur. Since Numenius speaks about the speciei bonitas, it is certain that also in the passage quoted-a passage from a paragraph full of reminiscences of Numenius-the term bonitas is due to him. DENIQUE EX The appeal to 'the wise men of the past' is, obviously, important in Numenius' doc-trine (seep. 105). Leemans mentions Moses, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Pherecydes and Homer. But if names are to be listed at all, that of Hesiod should certainly be added. However, although Leemans' names are to be included among these veteres theologi, a more general statement is to be preferred. It could be worded in the way this was done by Plutarch, Puech, o.c., p. 771: 1totμ1taAotLot; ... ex 6e:oMywv xotl. voμo6e:TWV . . . M~ot . . . oux &V MyoLc; μ6vov ou~· &V c:p~μotLt;, &.).)..' lv TE: TE:AE:TIXLt; ~v TE: 6ucr(otLt; xotl. ~otp~apoLt; xotl. \"Ell'l)crL 1tollocx.ou r.e:pL«:pe:poμev'I) (De !side 369 B). In all these systems Nu-menius found the dualism expressed, in his conviction, by Plato's words e~ cx.vayx'l)t; -re: xocl. vou. [297] So the Stoics and Pythagoras agree that matter is shapeless and without quality, but, according to Pythagoras, it is also evil, while, according to the Stoics, it is neither good nor evil. And when on their further journey, so to say, they meet with evil and are asked: \"where does evil come from?\", they indicate some perversity as its source. However, they yet fail to explain the origin of this 'perversity' itself, because, accord-ing to them, there are two principles of things, viz., God and matter, God being, in their opinion, the highest and supereminent Good, whereas matter is, according to them, neither good nor evil. Pythagoras, on the other hand, is not afraid to side with truth, although this compels him to make assertions which arouse astonishment and clash with the opinions of people. For he says that the exi!'ltence of Providence is necessarily connected with"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Il2 THE TREATISE ON MATTER evil, because it co-exists with matter which is affected with evil. Now if the world was made out of matter, it was certainly made out of some evil nature existing of old. This is why Numenius praises Heraclitus for blaming Homer, because thc latter wanted the extinction and destruction of the evil in life and did not under-stand that, in doing so, he wanted the destruction of the world, because in that case the source of evil, viz., matter, would be de-stroyed. Plato is praised by Numenius for assuming the existence of two world-souls, a beneficent one and an evil one, viz., matter. Although the latter is moved to an fro in a disorderly fashion, it must yet, because it is moved by a force of its own and from within, have a life of its own and be moved by a soul, in the same way as this is the case with all things moved by themselves. Matter is also the maker and protector of the passive part of the soul in which there is something corporeal and mortal and similar to a body, as the rational part of the soul has its maker in reason and in God. Now this world was made out of God and matter. SILVAM IGITUR Calcidius again formulates the theory of the Stoa. This nee bonam nee malam is also rejected by Tertullian as the doctrine of Hermogenes. He connects it with Hermogenes' quali-fication of matter as nee corpora/em nee incorporalem, which is also found in Calcidius (cp. par. 319-320). Tertullian says: Nam sicut nee corporalem nee incorporalem infers materiam, ita nee bonam nee malam adlegas (p. 56, 18-20 Wsz., cp. Vig. Christ. 9 (1955) p. 132). These qualifications are, of course, a further explanation of informis et sine qualitate (ifooLoc;;). DEHINC TAMQUAM The wording of the text is uncertain but not its meaning. In a remarkably vivacious style Calcidius explains the Stoic answer to the question: What then is the origin of evil? They ascribe it to some 'perversity', but, when asked the origin of this 'perversity', they have no answer. And with good reason, for they only know two principles, viz., God and matter (see par. 289 ss.) neither of which is evil. In par. 298 Numenius returns to this 'perversity'. SED PYTHAGORAS Py-thagoras is said to offer a better solution which, however, is in conflict with current opinions. He says that, if Providence exists, evil by nature must exist too. Calcidius (less probably Numenius') abbreviated the argument which, if completed, would have been: propterea quod providentia existente silva sit necesse est et eadem sit malitia praedita. In its actual form the reason looks like a petitio"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 297 II3 principii. This Pythagorean theory is also in Aulus Gellius, who quotes the following from Chrysippus' Ile:pt 1tpovolcxc;, book IV: 'nihil est prorsus istis' inquit 'insubidius, qui opinantur bona esse potuisse, si non essent ibidem mala.

Although this seems reasonable, at first sight, the accusative silvam must be preserved, since what follows: quae ... necesse est can only refer to silvam, not to silvae animam. Calcidius (or already Numenius) says that there are two world-souls, a beneficent and an evil one. He only describes the latter; but the former is defined as the ratio ac deus by what follows. Had Calcidius been explicit, he would have written: 1mam beneficientissimam, scilicet deum, malignam alteram, in which case one would automatically supply scilicet silvam. The final observation of this section: Porro ex deo et silva factus est iste mundus goes well with this. Moreover, in this 1) Leemans refers to Od. 13, 46 but Aristotle quotes Iliad 18, 107 literally. Philosophia Antigua, VIII 8"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"II4 THE TREATISE ON MATTER train of thought there is some kind of identity between silva, silva animata and anima silvae, as was already observed by R. M. Jones, The Platonism of Plutarch, 1916, p. 87. QUAE LICET All self-motion proceeds from a soul. Leemans rightly refers to Plato, Tim. 30A and Phaedr. 245E, to Plut., De an. procr. 1014C and Quaest. Plat. 1003A, and to Atticus, ap. Prod. In Tim.

QUAE QUIDEM The doctrine underlying this statement is that there are two souls in the macrocosmos, a good one ( = ratio ac deus) and an evil one ( = silva). In the microcosmos, i.e. man, the rational part of the soul corresponds with this ratio ac deus from which it draws its origin, whereas the part which is subject to the passiones corresponds with and springs from matter. The latter is understood to be that part of the soul which, according to Plato (Tim. 69D, cp. also 42D), created by the lower gods, was added by them to the rational part. It is considered to be the source of ira and cupiditas which elsewhere (par. 232-233) Calcidius calls vitiosae partes animi. It is generally known that Numenius did not speak of two parts of the soul but of two different souls, in both the world and man. One must, therefore, assume that Calcidius modified Numenius' doctrine in order to make it fit in with his own concept of the human soul. He believed the soul to be a unity. Hence he sub-stituted two parts of the human soul for the two souls mentioned by Numenius. On one occasion (293, 20) he even speaks of a pars patibilis rationabilis animae. This, at first sight, surprising ex-pression is easily explained from his former discussion on the soul in par. 53-54. Considering the human soul as a unity, he calls it rational a parte potiori, in exactly the same way as, at the beginning of par. 54, he calls the world-soul rationabilis. This he asserts to consist of a purely rational and a 'material' part, the anima stirpea. [ 298] So, according to Plato, the world received its good things from the munificence of God as a father; evil clung to it through the evilness of matter, its mother. And thus we under-stand why the Stoics vainly put th1:: blame on a certain 'perversity' when they say that things happen by virtue of the stars. Now the stars are bodies (viz., heavenly fires), and of all bodies matter is the foster-mother, so that also the unhappy confusion caused by the movement of the stars seems to originate from matter,"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 298 II5 in which there is much instability, blind impetuosity, change and arbitrary recklessness. Therefore, if God has improved matter, as Plato says in the Timaeus, and ordered from a state of being tossed about in great confusion, it is evident that this confused instability of matter was the result of some chance and unlucky fate and not of the bene-ficial plans of Providence. That is why, according to Pythagoras, the soul of matter is not devoid of substance (a non-entity), as most people thought, and why it resists Providence, always ready to thwart its plans through the power of its perversity. Now, Providence is the work and the activity of God, whereas blind and casual arbitrariness comes from matter. Hence it is clear that, according to Pythagoras, the mass of the universe came from a cooperation between God and matter, or between Providence and chance; and further that, after matter had received its adornment, it became the mother of corporeal and generated gods. Its condition is good to a high degree, though not entirely, since the evilness inherent in its nature could not be removed throughout. IGITUR IUXTA PLATONEM The sentence opens with igitur be-cause it explains unam beneficientissimam, malignam alteram; it confirms the explanation (p. u3) which led us to maintain the reading silvam of the MSS; compare par. 330, where Calcidius discusses Tim. 50D, a passage, in which Plato uses this comparison himself. Leemans mentions another source, the Politicus 273B-C: 1t0tpcx μe:v yocp 'C'OU auv6ev't'oc; 7tlXV'C'Ot XCU.IX X€XTij'C'OtL, 1t0tpix ae: -njc; &μ-1tpocr6e:v e~e:wc; oa0t :X.0tAe:1tix x0tt ixaLx0t. He also refers to Origen Contra Cels. IV 65 (355, 16). Of course, Calcidius has in mind Tim. 30A, to which he refers below. QUA RATIONE From the clause cum ... dicantur it seems that, to the Stoics, the 'perversity' mentioned is produced by the movement of the stars. This is confirmed by a passage in the treatise on fate: Unde ergo mala? M otu stellarum causarum. Sed ipse motus unde? (par. 174). This is precisely the same thought met with in par. 297. Numenius shows that, since the stars themselves consist of matter, it is quite useless to appeal to their perversity without indicating its basis. The doctrine ascribed here by Numenius (or Calcidius) to the Stoa is remarkable. There are, indeed, a few other data which show a certain similarity to it, but I know of no real parellel texts."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"n6 THE TREATISE ON MATTER Leemans refers to par. 292, where, he says, Calcidius translates auxa-rpoq,~ (which, indeed, may be rendered by perversitas) with perversio. However, in par. 292 one reads conversio rather than perversio. Probably Leemans has in mind par. 165, where Calcidius speaks of the causes of error by which man comes to evil. By nature, he says, man strives after what is good; only through an error about what is good he comes to aspire after evil. He continues: Est erroris causa multiplex. prima, quam Stoici duplicem perversionem vacant. haec autem nascitur tam ex rebus ipsis quam ex divulgatione f amae. However much this term is like the one under discussion, the texts in which they occur refer to entirely different things. In par. 165 there is question ot the cause of evil acts, which is found in human behaviour itself, whereas in par. 297-298 there is question of evil in general. the cause of which is found in a thing beyond human reach, viz., the motion of stars. Fabricius refers to Aulus Gellius who, again (cp. p. n3), cites Chrysippus' Tiept 1tpovo(cxc:;. The cause of (evidently moral) evil is found in some scaevitas in the spirit of some people which impels them to sin. In this way Chrysippus tries to combine the imputability of human actions with the theory on the domination of fate. The similarity between this text and Calcidius' par. 165 does not go beyond the fact that both the perversio and the scaevitas fulfil the part of a deus ex machina 1). Apart from this, the perversitas under discussion is something quite by itselt. OMNIUM QUIPPE For nutrix, cp. Tim 49A and 52D. EX SILVA Matter is the nurse of all disorder. What was said above of Numenius' style is partic-ularly relevant in the present passage. For praesumptio, cp. 349, 14, p. 184. ITAQUE SI In connexion with the subordinate clause (ut ... Plato) Borghorst observes: quippe e quibus (sc. verbis) luce claritts elucet Chalcidium, ut solent conpilatores, ea transscripsisse 1) The complete text may confirm this: Quamquam ita sit, inquit (sc. Chrysippus), ut ratione quadam necessaria et principali coacta atque conexa sint f ato omnia ingenia, tamen ipsa mentium nostrarum proinde sunt fato obnoxia, ut proprietas eorum est ipsa et qualitas. Nam si sunt per naturam primitus salubriter utiliterque ficta, omnem illam vim qua de fato extrinsecus ingruit inoffensius tractabilius transmittunt.

It is evident that Calcidius here translates Numenius literally, otherwise he would have realized that the clause was out of place in a commentary on the Timaeus itself. A similar phrase occurs in the treatise on fate, where he also followed Numenius closely, as will be shewn in the introduction to the edition by Waszink-Jensen: Quae cimcta mani/estius in Timaeo digerit (205, 3). In the present text Numenius refers to Tim. 30A: oiJ't'c.> 8~ 1tav l>aov ~v opoc't'OV 1tocpocAoc~c:iv oux ~aux(ocv ocyov CXAAIX xwouμ.e:vov 1tA'Yj(J.μ.e:Awc; xcxl. ixTcxxTwc;, de; Tcx~Lv cxuT<> ~ycxye:v ex -rijc; ixTcx~lcxc;. For a moment one wonders what exactly Numenius wants to demons-trate. This is shewn by what follows: from the fact that God halts disorder and creates order, it is clear that disorder did not proceed from the divine principle, viz., Providence. Hence another principle in self-motion must exist, and therefore animated (so anima silvae neque sine itlla substantia est). In other words, ar.imated matter actually exists, not a mere Aristotelian Mvocμ.Lc; (cp. Leemans). The idea that matter opposes Providence is (as Leemans (o.c., p. 95) observes) also found in Porphyry, De antro Nymph. 5, p. 59 Nauck: ... 't'O ixpyov xcxl. IXV't\"L't\"U7tOV 1tpoc; 't'O e:!8oc;. But the Laws of Plato are a more obvious source, for the evil soul postulated by Plato there is quite naturally interpreted as the soul of matter, thus leading to Numenius' concept (cp. Plut., De an. procr. 1014D-E, where Leges X (896D ss.) is quoted). Finally, the itaque is not entirely conclusive here, but rather leads back to the argument, interrupted by the digression on the doctrine of the Stoa. EX PROVIDENTIAE CONSULTIS SALUBRIBUS In the comment on par. 270 reference was made to these words. The same holds for et ad-versatur providentiae consulta eius inpugnare gestiens malitiae suae viribus. The present passage is proof that these expressions were actually used by Numenius. MALITIAE SUAE VIRIBUS If I am not mis-taken, Numenius did not consider this malitia to consist exclusively in the disorderliness of matter: vires rather points to the concept of a will present in matter or rather in its soul. This opposes the regulating activity of Providence and strives, at all costs, to main-tain the original disorder. Here is an unmistakable influence of Oriental dualism. SED PROVIDENTIA Two powers have come to light: a beneficent one, Providence, and an evil one, the soul of matter. Numenius now comes to the final statement that this Providence is God's activity, whereas the disorderliness stems from"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"n8 THE TREATISE ON MATTER matter, the latter statement being, of course, a repetition. And he concludes: it is clear that, according to Pythagoras, everything came into being by the cooperation between God and matter, or, in other words, between Providence and chance. This conclusion reminds one of necessitatis intellegentiaeque coetu in par. 270, which translates Tim. 48A &~ cxvixyx'Y)c; 't'& xocl. vou cruaTixa&wc; and, in a second quotation almost immediately following, is modified by providentia instead of intellegentia (cp. also 325, 15 and 328, 9-10). Calcidius did so under the influence of Numenius (p. 34). SED POSTQUAM After contrasting the principles, Calcidius explains the behaviour of matter once Providence begins to act. Matter, just now termed corporum nutrix, becomes the mother of what Calcidius calls corporei et nativi dei. With this he undoubtedly means the material world as it is ordered, that is, the cosmos in the strictest sense of the word. For this remarkable terminology, one may, with Leemans, refer to Tim. 40D where there is question of 't'CX 7t&pl. 't'WV 6&wv opot't'WV xocl. y&VV'Y)'t'WV dp1jμevoc (cp. 43D) and to Euseb., Praep.

FORTUNAM VERO From corporei et nativi dei one might surmise that matter lost entirely its character of disorderliness and resistance to the ordering activity of Providence. This, however, is not the case; the naturale vitium of matter never disappears entirely. Providence can only drive it back as much as possible. That evil cannot be eliminated is implied by Plato, Tim. 30A: ~OUA1j6dc; yap o 6&oc; cxyoc6a: μev 7tlXV't'ot, (f)AOtupov 8e μ1j8Ev elvocL x oc 't' a 8 u v oc IL L v , and in the Tl 8uvocT6v of 53B; in 48A he says: 't' oc 1t \" e ~ a 't' oc &7tl.

Leemans quotes Plutarch, De Is. et Osir. 48, p. 37B; De an. procr. 1015B and C. In this context the image found in Laws X (896D s.) should, again, be borne in mind. This passage is the /ons et principium of all statements where Plato discusses the evil soul which can never be ordered entirely.-In par. 299 Calcidius discusses the mutual relation between matter and Prov-idence. Since silvae anima is almost the equivalent of silva, silvae anima neque est sine ulla substantia (327, 7) is practically silva non est sine ulla substantia. Thus it becomes diametrically opposed to the doctrine of Aristotle, as referred in par. 288 (319, 24): ... silva, quam ait ex natura nullam habere substantiam."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 299 [299] So, by His miraculous power, God adorned matter and, in every way, corrected its faults, without, however, destroying them entirely, thus preventing complete destruction of the nature of matter. Yet He did not allow them to grow and expand far and wide, but preserving its nature, capable of changing from a troublesome to a favourable state, He totally changed its con-dition, adorning and decorating it by joining order with disorder, measure with measurelessness, and adornment with ugliness. Finally, Numenius says-and rightly so--that things which have come into being without defects are found nowhere, in neither the actions of man nor nature, in neither the bodies of animals nor trees, plants or fruit, not in the air nor in water, not even in the firmament, since everywhere something of a lower order is, as a kind of contamination, mixed up with Providence. And when, then, he wants to show and, as it were, bring to light an image of naked matter, he says that first all bodies, which in the womb of matter exchange and cause alteration, should be taken away one by one. Secondly we should contemplate in our mind that which has been made void by this removal: this he calls matter or necessity. From this and from God, in his opinion, the structure of the world came into being, God acting with persuasion, necessity obeying Him. This is what Pythagoras asserts about the principles of things. DEUS ITAQUE It is only now (cp. the comment on par. 298: sed postquam silvae ornatus accesserit), that Numenius (or Calcidius, if he abbreviated Numenius) mentions the author of this 'adornment'. Once more his verbosity should be noted. For non inter/iciens, cp. what in par. 297 he took from Heraclitus. UT MANENTE NATURA Ut seems to be a rendering of Greek we; with participle (we; μevoUCJYjc; rpuaewc;). INLUSTRANDO ATQUE OR-NANDO terms often used by Calcidius. NON IN ARTIBUS HOMINUM, NON IN NATURA, NON . . . Leemans: Eiusmodi enumerationes Nu-menio minime displicuisse videntur. Aeris series and aqitae tractits are poetical denotations of air and water (cp. tractus fontium, 307, 13). So is piawlum, denoting 'expiation' as well as 'that which requires expiation', 'sin'; hence our translation 'contamination'. IDEMQUE NUDAM In order to grasp matter it is necessary, first, \"to think away all bodies (i.e., the 'corporeal forms', cp. the com-ment on par. 274, p. 48), which in the womb of the silva are always"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"120 THE TREATISE ON MATTER changing from one to another\", and then \"to contemplate the empty residuum, left over by this process of abstraction (egestio )\". This method is precisely tbe one indicated in par. 274 by Calcidius for the understanding of matter. Particularly welcome is the ex-plicit mention of Numenius (Idemque, referring to Numenius in the preceding sentence), which makes it certain we have the genuine doctrine of Numenius both here and in par. 274 (see also p. 50). This strongly confirms the thesis that, in his treatise on matter, C:alcidius constantly follows Numenius. In the comment on par. 274 it has been pointed out that this approach to the knowledge of matter has features present in Aristotle and even in Plato. Plato speaks about the interchanging of bodies; Aristotle knows the method of occpeltpecm:; (see also Albinus, Epit. X 5). Still, animo considerare which occurs again and again is from Numenius. In 312, 12 it is even unexpectedly (cp. ad loc., p. 76). DEO PERSUA-DENTE, NECESSITATE OBSECUNDANTE The verb persuadere fits well into Numenius' doctrine. It was also used by Calcidius in par. 270: 11t vi persuadeat vimque inroget persitadentem ; hoe est ut persuasio vim et vis adhibeat persuasionem. Obsecundare is rather surprising. In the preceding paragraph matter was said to resist the plans of Providence : adversatur providentiae consulta eius inpugnare gestiens malitiae suae viribus. These statements on the behaviour of matter seem to be contradictory. Calcidius' treatment of the relationship between God and matter showed a similar contradiction. In par. 270 he writes about matter: nee adversum exornationem suam resistentem sed ita victam ut maiestati opificis l i b e n s cedat pa-reatque eius sapientiae, and: oportuit silvam ei morigeram parentemque subdi. On the other hand, he speaks about a rig or necessitatis (303, 3). The difference between Calcidius and Numenius is that the former stresses the pliability, the latter the recalcitrance of matter. This state of affairs can be explained in two ways: I. Calcidius copied the real contradiction of Numenius' system. But since he tries to free matter from disorder and evilness (see par. 301), pliability was stressed rather than recalcitrance. 2. Since in Calcidius' rendering of Numenius obsecundante is the only word implying submissivenes, this word may be an interpolation. Due to his con-cept of matter Calcidius was compelled to assume some sort of submissiveness, not found in his source. HAEC EST PYTHAGORAE DE ORIGINIBUS ADSEVERATIO See the similar endings of the reports on Aristotle and the Stoics: Haec Aristotelis de silva sententia (319, 20)"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 300 121 and Haec Stoici de silva deque initiis rerum ... (323, 15-16). But here Calcidius adds no explanation, as he did previously. This passage on Pythagoras, actually copied from Numenius, occupies a central place in Calcidius' treatise. Meanwhile, the manifold ramifications of the relationship between Numenius and Calcidius can only be described and underi;;tood after a comment on par. 300-301. (d) The opinion of Plato (oc) One interpretation [300] Plato's opinion on this subject remains to be discussed. His disciples are found to interpret it differently. There are those who say that Plato considered matter to be made, but they rely more on words than on reality. Others say that it had no origin but possesses a soul, since Plato said that before its adornment it fluctuated in an unsteady and disorderly motion, while in-trinsic motion is proper to living <and, therefore, animated> things. And that is why, also elsewhere, he frequently said that there are two world-souls, an evil one sprung from matter and a good one drawing its origin from God. Since there are good and evil things, the good ones are bestowed upon the world by the good soul, the evil ones by the soul of matter. For <it is clear that such a soul of matter really exists, because> divine wisdom and the intellect of the divine Maker persuaded matter in a severe and effective way to behave patiently with regard to its adornment and decoration, and a patient behaviour can only be imposed on animated and living beings. The Jews agree with these authors, saying that God gave man a soul through divine inspiration-this they ca11 reason and rational soul-but that He gave the mute animals living in the fields an irrational soul derived from matter, when the living and animated creatures had, at His command, come from the womb of the earth; the serpent who enticed the first human being into the snares of his evil advice must have belonged to the latter. SUPEREST IPSA After Aristotle, the Stoics and Pythagoras follows Plato. However, the present discussion of Plato's opinion is quite different from the three preceding ones. This, after all,"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"122 THE TREATISE ON MATTER was to be expected, for the establishment and interpretation of Plato's opinion is the real subject of the treatise De silva, the com-mentary on what Plato's Timaeus says about matter. Therefore, the two subsequent paragraphs (300-301) can be considered as either forming part of the historical section or introducing the systematic one. Anyhow, if the transitional character of these paragraphs is duly taken into account, the division actually made is of minor importance. QUAM DIVERSE The standpoints mentioned here may be summed up as follows: 1) matter was made 2) matter was not made a) matter is animated b) matter is not animated. QUIPPE ALII The question who these alii are can only be answered by a considering the whole paragraph. This contains the standpoint of Numenius, fommlated somewhat differently, confirmed by the doctrine of the Jews. At the beginning of Numenius' record of the doctrine of Pythagoras (324, 11-15), reference is made to authors who accept an origin of matter, viz., the 'monistic school' of Pytha-gorism. No doubt the same are meant here. This is confirmed by the text itself, for verba quaedam potius quam rem secuti in the present passage (328, 14) is only a different wording for vim sententiae non recte assecuti (324, 12). In both cases it is said that this group of philosophers misunderstands the thesis that matter was generated. ALII VERO The doctrine of the other alii is identical with that of Numenius. Again, the existence of the evil soul of matter is inferred from its disorderly motion, and, once more, there is a reference to Plato's Laws, or rather to his frequent teaching on this subject. The construction of the phrase Existentibus ... is some-what intricate, since Calcidius says too much at once. Hence the conjunction cum received a pregnant meaning, which must be translated with a paraphrase. In general the 'Numenian' ideas are set forth, but the argument reaches a statement which, though fitting in with what precedes, is not in the Numenius' passage, viz., \"If God, in treating matter, was using persuasion, matter must necessarily have a soul, for only animated beings can be persuaded\". The term persuadere reminds one of Numenius, so does cultui atque exornationi. For the con-nexion between severe and persuadere, see p. 120. So one may"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 300 123 assume that in the present passage Calcidius did not add an argu-ment of himself but only borrowed from N umenius. QUIBUS HEBRAEI Attention should he given to this quotation of the opinion of the Jews, for elsewhere (par. 53-55, p. 17) Calcictius cites the Jews for a similar question concerning the nature of the soul. Since the in-fluence of Numenius was undeniable there, this new instance, again, confirms that we still have to do with the same author. Here, on the authority of the Jews distinction is made between the human soul and the soul of animals. In par. 54-55, on the same authority, the existence of two souls in man is defended. These two theories are in fact identical, for the first human soul of par. 53-54 is the same as the anima rationabilis ex inspiratione divina in the present passage, whereas the second furnishes man with the vitales vigores, qui sunt communes hominibus et bestiis, stirpibus etiam. This same theory on a double soul in man occurs in par. 209 with the addition that the soul of thE; animals is in the blood. Nu-menius certainly derived these Hebraica from Philo who expounded a similar theory (cp. Switalski, o.c., p. 42 ss., and the works by Rusche quoted in the survey (p. 21)). We already saw how Nu-menius fitted these H ebraica into his own theory (p. 106, note 1). It is true that there are divergences from Philo, who rejected that the soul which is essentially blood originated ex silva(e anima); to him matter possesses no soul. However, quam rationem et animam rationabilem a d p ell a n t may still refer to Philo.-The serpent of Paradise illustrates the evilness rather than the irrational nature of this soul.

Their wording, however, is slightly different from that of the preceding paragraphs which were a direct translation by Calcidius of Numenius himself. Its interpretation of Plato's doctrine is ascribed to one of the great schools of auditores Platonis. This means that in Numenian terms Calcidius reproduced the theory of a definite group of Platonists. It is evident again how far-reaching the influence of Numenius was on Calcidius. But it had its limits. In the next paragraph Calcidius rejects Numenius' view that matter has a soul of itself."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"124 THE TREATISE ON MATTER (~) The other interpretation [301] There are also who think that, according to Plato, this disorderly and confused motion is not present in matter but in the materials and bodies alone which are called 'principles and elements of the world'. For if matter is without form or order, it is, of course, by nature without motion, and not only without motion but also without change, for in this case matter will not change but the bodies in which the qualities are present. Since it is without motion, it is then also without a soul. Moreover, the evilness <which matter is generally assumed to possess> consists, according to these Platonists, in lack of good-ness, as is also the case with shapelessness, helplessness and measurelessness<, the essence of which only consists in lack of form, etc.>. And so it happens that, by adding a negation to the names of virtues, their opposites are indicated, as, for instance, imprudence injustice and inexperience. And this is the dissension among the Platonic philosophers. NEC DESUNT QUI POTENT Those who find the source of the dis-orderly motion of matter in matter itself, particularly in its evil soul, are opposed by others who see the source of this disorderliness not in matter but in the bodies that enter into it, viz., the so called elements, which Calcidius often calls materiae (p. 42). How this theory must be understood will appear in par. 352, where Calcidius himself will defend it. QUIPPE SI The argument is this: ''if matter has neither form nor order, it has neither motion nor change\". Evidently this is based on the idea that matter is a purely negative essence from which every predicate should be taken away. Starting from the idea that inmobilis is a rendering of cxxlv'Y)\"t'O(;, which means both 'immovable' and 'motionless', the term is translated by 'without motion'. This translation seems to fit better into the pre-sent context. However, in the comment on par. 329, immobility will also appear to be said about matter. MALITIAM PORRO The evilness which, in the opinion of the authors discussed, is directly connected with matter resides in its disorderly motion. Therefore, after the previous statements the question what is the nature of this evilness of matter must come up. If it is true that there is no motion in matter, this evilness cannot exist in disorderly motion either. The answer is quite in line with what preceeds: evilness is something"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 301 125 essentially negative; it is no more than the absence of goodness. PROPTEREAQUE VIRTUTIBUS An argument from language is added here. By orationis pars negativa Calcidius means the prefix in-. Contra means 'the opposite', so contra quam virtutes must mean 'the opposite of virtues'. In explaining this theory in par. 352 Calcidius compares matter with stagnant water into which pebbles are thrown. The water is the image of matter by itself, the pebbles are the bodies coming into matter. Matter by itself was neither in motion nor in rest (neque stabat neque movebatur); the bodies caused the (disorderly) motion. Therefore, this motion is not proper to matter but a motus alienus. One may also ask whether Calcidius, agreeing with the first part of the Platonics' theory of par. 301, also accepts their views on the evilness of matter, for he does not mention the subject any more. His silence would be difficult to understand had he not agreed. Moreover, in the explanation of the doctrine of Aristotle (319, 14-16) the idea that evil is something negative was in the background as self-evident. HAEC . . . EST DISSENSIO PLATONICORUM PHILOSOPHORUM The important question is: who are the Platonici philosophi followed by Calcidius? Steinheimer at once answers too hastely: Plotinus. Calcidius, he says (o.c., p. 40), evidently follows an authority, later than Numenius and, moreover, the theory that evil is the absence of good is proper to Plotinus: Enn. III 2, 5: /S).w~ oe: xotxov EAAe:L~tv 't'ou cxyot6ou ee:,.fov. Steinheimer might also have referred to Enn.

On the other hand, Borghorst thinks that par. 300 and 301 are still derived from Numenius. His argument (o.c., p. 37) is based on data from par. 300 only, a section which, indeed, is wholly Numenian (the evidence is, in fact, much stronger than Borghorst suggests). However, we think it improbable that Calcidius found the opinion which clearly deviates from the concept of matter held by Numenius, in Numenius himself. At any rate, nothing in the present text points in this direction. One should assume rather that, at the end of the entire dissertation, Calcidius expounds and accepts an opinion which is opposed to N umenius. But what about Plotinus? Can he be taken as the source of Calci-dius? If this were possible, the problem of Calcidius would come"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER in an entirely new light. Plotinus, not Numenius, would he the last source used here by Calcidius. The doctrine of evil as something purely negative is, indeed, Plotinian, but the rest of the concept shows little of Plotinus. To mention only one detail, the latter asks how evilness of matter can be combined with its lack of quality; Enn. I 8, 10: \"A1towc; 8e: oumx 1twc; x.ixx.~; Nothing of the kind is found in Calcidius. Nor is, on the other hand, Calcidius' theory of the two phases in matter (first half of par. 301) found in Plotinus. These considerations would not carry much weight, if the theory concern-ing evil as something negative would be proper to Plotinus. But it is found already before him, namely in an author mentioned by Calcidius himself, Origen. As if it were the most common thing on earth the latter says: Certum namque est malum esse bona carere (De princ. II 9, 2, p. 166, 1-2 K.) 1). As noted on p. 91, this theory could be inferred from Physics, 192 a 14 ss. Anyhow, one is not obliged to regard Plotinus as Calcidius' authority on the sole ground of an agreement between them on this particular issue. Does the rest of par. 301 bring us closer to the source of this theory, viz., the differentiation between matter by itself and matter in disorderly motion? If I am not mistaken, Hermogenes taught a similar theory, for Tertullian reproaches him for ascribing to matter a inconditus et con/usus et turbulentus mottts, like the movement of boiling water in a kettle, and, on the other hand, for calling matter equilibrious (aequalis momenti habens motum) and neque ad bonum neque ad malum vergens 2). Is this what Tertullian saw as an inconsistency really inconsistent, or rather a twofold way of looking at matter, viz., as matter hy itself and as matter in disorder 1) To Origen evil is ethical evil, which is a voluntary turning away from good. Accordingly, he does not believe matter to be evil. See Hal Koch, Pronoia und Paideusis. Studien uber Origenes und sein Verhiiltnis zum Plato-nismus, Berlin u. Leipzig, 1932, p. 107 ss. To Calcidius this evil is ontological evil, but his examples clarify that his concept is derived from the idea of moral evil. In this respect, he is again closer to Plotinus about whose concept of evil Carl Andresen (Logos und Nomos. Die Polemik des Kelsos wider das Christentum, Berlin, 1955, p. 71, n. 65) says: \"Mit Recht macht Wilhelm Thomme in seiner Dbersetzung der Konfessionen (Zurich) S. 433 A. 1 zu S. 180 darauf aufmerksam, dass auch die Losung Plotins, das Bose als privatio boni zu definieren, an einer gleichen Vermengung des Ontischen und des Ethischen leidet; zur Sache R.

Et"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 301 127 after receiving the elements? If the latter be true, it would be a theory much like the one Calcidius ascribes to a group of Platonists; Hermogenes too was a Platonist. This interpretation of Hermogenes provides a solution of another problem which has often occupied the interpreters of Tertullian, viz., how these two different assertions of Hermogenes in Tertullian should be explained (Art. 'Hermogenes' in Herzog-Hauck, Realenzyklopiidie 7 (3. ed. 1899) p. 757; cp. Waszink, Tertttllian, The Treatise against Hermogenes, p. 7, 95). The differences, however, between Hermogenes and Calcidius should not be overlooked. To the former matter by itself is neither good nor evil, while its evilness consists in the disorderliness after receiving the elements. To the latter matter as such is evil. If the interpretation offered here is correct, the distinction between two phases in matter was made before 207 A.D., the year when the Adversus Hermogenem (Waszink, o.c., p. 13) was published and-what is equally important-at least at the same time as Numeniu~. In conclusion, the authors of par. 301 were not necessarily posterior to those of par. 300. The group of Platonists who deviate in one respect from their colleagues, viz., in regarding the disorderly motion of matter as not inherent in matter itself, must also have other views on the evilness of matter. Calcidius adopts their opinion, thereby deviating from Numenius. Nevertheless although Calcidius rejects Numenius in this important question, the two authors remain closely connected. Calcidius' deviation is restricted to theoretical issues. In practice he speaks about matter in much the same way as Numenius. This attitude of Calcidius underlies his remarkable assertions concerning the submissiveness and the recalcitrance of matter (p. 120). In Calcidius' opinion matter is less refractory than in the fragments of N umenius. It is the natural consequence of the view expressed in the present passage, that matter as such has no disorderly motion. The conclusion, therefore, is that, in spite of his close adherence to the doctrine of Numenius, Calcidius preserved a certain independence and was not the homo unius libri which he is often said to be. But he could he reproached in the same way as, about a century earlier, Tertullian adressed Hermogenes: quomodo alibi alius a te adfirmatur? Cum enim vis materiam nee bonam nee malam inducere. 'I gitur', inquis, 'subiaeens materia aequalis momenti habens motum neque ad bonum neque ad malum plurimum vergit. Connected with this is Tertullian's observation that Hermogenes says, at one time, that matter is evil (malam esse materiam, p. 27, 9-10 Wsz.) and, at another, like here, that it is neither good nor evil (cp. p. 56, 19-20 Wsz.)."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"128 THE TREATISE ON MATTER eamqite (sc. materiam) adicis sectari informitatem, dehinc alibi desiderare componi a deo (Adv. Hermvg. 42, 1, p. 62, II-12 Wsz.). In his theoretical considerations Calcidius tries to take away from matter all evilness and recalcitrance against the activity of Providence. This attempt mu<;t perhaps be seen as a reaction against the extreme dualism of Numenius. In par. 252 he says about matter: neque stabat neqite movebatur. But when he-in prac-tice-is speaking about the relationship between matter and God, he comes nearer to Numenius and leaves room for the idea of chaos, so prominent in Numenius' system. Thus, even where he deviates from the theory in his source, he follows this source in practical issues. In many other points he followed his author unconditionally, especially his view on the cognoscibility of matter and on the activity of God. This leads to the conclusion that Numenius was Calcidius' main authority, and that the influence of the Platon-ists of paragraph 301 must be regarded as secondary. This Numen-ian influence extends itself even to the explanation on the doc-trines of others, such as Aristotle. And it is for all these reasons, that Calcidius' work has these strong N umenian features. b) Systematic part ex) The principles in general cxcx) Two ways of arguing [302] We shall now consider which of these theories is, in our opinion, the best, the best suited to the search of truth, and most worthy of so great an author's wisdom. Whenever a problem is proposed, two kinds of argument are possible. The first establishes what is later on the ground of what precedes; this is the method proper to syllogism, in which (Cale.: 'for') the things assumed, also called elements, precede the conclusion. The second gradually proceeds from what is later to the disquisition of what is before; and this kind of argum-ent is called resolutio. Since there is question of the first princi-ples here, that is of things which existed before everything else, we must use here the method of resolutio. It is an established fact to everyone, whether a philosopher or not, that there are senses and intellect in us, and that these"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 302 129 two are not identical, and, consequently, that because they are different themselves, their effects are also different. Therefore, there must be things which can be perceived by the intellect and the senses. Thus there exist sensible and intelligible things. Intelligible things are such as are perceived by the intellect by means of a rational investigation, sensible things are such as are perceived by means of a non-rational view (opinio), which results in an uncertain opinion (opinio). The former exist from eternity without beginning, the latter are temporary and begin in time. These, from our standpoint, are primary, but in essence secondary, while the intelligible things are primary in essence, but secondary from our standpoint. Therefore, when a man in his argument ascends from the things which, seen from our standpoint, are primary to those which, from our standpoint, are secondary, he uses resolutio, for starting from things that are unreal but rather images of real things, he arrives at things which are the principle and cause of things that have a real existence. NOS TAMEN From the comparatives it is evident that Calcidius only speaks of the paragraphs 300 and 301, that is, of the two interpretations of Plato, not of the theories on matter discussed before. In this way, the paragraphs 300 and 301 are clearly given an outstanding position; once again, they constitute a transition. The influence of Numenius on them is amply discussed on p. 127. EST IGITUR PROPOSITARUM QUAESTIONUM DUPLEX PROBATIO In order to understand the turn in Calcidius' argument, it should be observed that he is approaching a subject which he evidently wants to study thoroughly. He discusses the principles in general and next matter, but before touching the actual subject, he examines the tools to be used, namely the different ways of arguing. There are two methods: syllogism and resolutio. The syllogism starts from what was before in order to arrive at what is later; the resolutio starts from what is later in order to trace what was before. Now, because principles are implied, i.e., things that are prior to any-thing else, there can only be question of resolutio. The meaning of 'what is later' and 'what was before' forms the subject of this paragraph. Calcidius might have declared: \"by 'what is later' are meant the sensible things, by 'what was before' the intelligible, for, although, from our standpoint, the sensible things are primary and the intelligible secondary, the situation is just the reverse\". Philosophia Antigua, VIII 9"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"130 THE TREATISE ON MATTER However, Calcidius wants to treat the question more thoroughly, incidentally proving that sensible and intelligible things do exist. SYLLOGISMUS - RESOLUTIO The term resolutio is abnormal; be-side 'syllogism', one expects 'induction' (cp. Arist., Topica 105 a 10; for au)J..oytaμ6<; also Anal. Priora 24 b 18. Fabricius observes: \"Analytica per e1tocywyrjv sive indu,ctionem probatio\". Switalski (o.c., p. 26, note) refers to Eth. Nicom. VI 3 (au)J..oytaμ6<; anrl e1tocywyrj), but notes: \"Die resolutio des Chalcidius ist aber, wie c. 303 und 304 zeigen, nicht sowohl die e1tocywyrj des Aristoteles, als vielmehr die 8toclp&at<; (compositio c. 304 = O\"Uvocywyrj) des Plato\". However, the 8toclp&at<; of Plato is not, like the resolutio in C.ucidius, a re-gression from what is perceptible by the senses to the intelligible. In this respect the resolutio is much like the e1tocywyrj, Aristotle's induction, but this is the only point of agreement, as will become clearer below. QUAE ELEMENT A VOCANTUR Of course, the principles are meant, which are assumed to exist (acceptationes). The use of elementa may have been suggested by Physics 184 a 23: Tix O''t'OLX&'i:oc xoct oct cx.pxocl, from which, in fact, Calcidius derives his argument. For the typical use of remedium, see the introduction to Calcidius' commentary (par. 1, p. 11). CERTUM EST The argument runs as follows: the senses and the intellect are two different things; therefore, the sensible and the intellectual perceptions (effectus) are different as well and, consequently, the things perceived sensibly or intellectually differ: finally, therefore, sensible and intellectual things exist. A well-known passage of the Timaeus (51D-E) de-monstrates the existence of the forms on the ground of the difference between vou<; and M~oc cx.A'YJ6~i;. Calcidius comments on this text in par. 340-342. The same argument also occurs in Albinus (IX 4); it is a theme which Middle Platonism elaborated in various ways. In Calcidius it is not meant as a proof for the existence of the forms, but an argument in which he opposes the sensilia to the intellegibilia. ET INTELLEGIBILIA The definition of these two concepts is bac,ed on Tim. 28A, where Plato defines TO llv and 't'O ytyv6μ&vov: 't'O μev 8~ VO~O'&L μ&'t'IX Myou 7t&pLA'YJ7t't'6V .•.

Clearly this was a central theme in Middle Platonism. ILLA QUIDEM To state that in this thoroughly Platonic context Calcidius framed his argument in an Aristotelian manner might be surprising.

Attention should be paid to 8tottpouat TotU't'ot, i.e., \"for those who use 8toclpe:atc;\". This 8toctpe:Lv was, undoubtedly in Calcidius' mind, when he called his second kind of argument resolutio. Elsewhere (333, 10) he also uses dissolutio, which is still nearer to the Greek term. The close connexion with this passage from Aristotle is confirmed by the initia causaeque, which are the translation of Tex CJ't'OL)(.e:Lot xocl. ocl ixpx.ocL However, Aristotle's 8tottpdv and the resolutio or dissolutio of Calcidius do not mean the same.

Ross ad loc.); the exact sense of resolutio must be found in its application. ~~) Matter is found by means of resolutio [303] Everything perceived by the senses is near to us, viz., fire, air, earth and water, but the things composed of these elements are nearer, and nearer still are our own bodies. In our bodies there is something contiguous and solid, visible and warm. Now, nothing is contiguous and solid without earth nor is ar·y-thing visible and warm without fire; so within us there are both earth and fire. There is also something like breath, because"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"132 THE TREATISE ON MATTER breath is found in the veins, which are also called arteries, and also something damp, and humidity cannot exist without water nor breath without air. But if all these things are parts of a body, there must also, as we said above, exist a reality of which these things are parts, viz., the body of the universe. So in this body of the universe there are fire, earth, the other materials and, finally, their harmonious composition consisting of forms and qualities: of fire, its lustre, levity, colour and shape; of earth, its dryness, weight and shape. Likewise the materials between fire and earth should have definite, natural qualities. If, by means of our intellect, ,ve wish to take away these qualities and quantities, these shapes a.ad figures, and then consider what keeps all these things inseparably together and contains them, we shall find that there is nothing else than that what we are looking for, i.e., matter, and herewith we have found the material principle. This then is one of the two possible methods of arguing, called resolutio. The explanation of the present section must begin at the end. The proper act of resotutio is expressed by Si ergo has qualitates et quantitates . . . volemits r a t i o n e a n i m i separare, tum de-liberare, quid sit illud ... , which words remind one of the passages a bout the cognoscibility of matter: hoe est ut universis corporibits, quae intra gremium silvae vari\"e varia formantur mu.tua ex alio in aliud resolutione singillatim ademptis solum ipsum vacuum sinum speculatione mentis imagineris (305, 10-13); ... ipsum illud, quod ex egesiione vacuatum est, animo considerari iubet (328, 6-8); and the short reference to it in: At vero qui ... sine consortia corporum solam per semet ipsam mente intuentur (312, 10-12). Cp. Denique si ntentis consideratione volumus ei haec adimere (338, 1-2) and sinceram silvam, quae concitrsu variorum corporum tegitur, ab eorundem corporum permixtione sollertia mentis distinguere (351, 5-7). Quae ... modo separare animo videbamur a silva (332, 19-20). This resolutio is the mental process mentioned already several times as mainly derived from the ocqioc(pem<;; of Aristotle but containing also a Numenian element in animo considerare. The combination of ocqioc(-peaL<;; and animo considerare got its name from the former (see ad par. 299, p. 50. In par. 274 the same term resolutio was used for the corresponding process in reality). This leads to a remarkable discovery. The resolutio is not a type"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"PARAC.RAPH 303 133 of logical argument at all. An argument proves that a thing is, whereas the resolutio shows what a thing is. And, indeed, re-reading the passage in which Calcidius applies the resolutio (322, 9 ss.), it is quite obvious that no argument is involved. The genus proba-tionis which one would expect here, turns up in par. 317-318. It is the argument which, on the ground of an analysis of change, concludes to a permanent matter underlying the change. This is, moreover, an implicit confirmation that in the present text some-thing else is meant, even though at the end Calcidius affirms: et hoe quidem est unum duarum probationum genus. In this resolutio Calcidius gives his own interpretation of the words of Aristotle: cx.1to -rwv yveuptμ.w-repwv ~μ.°Lv di; -.a yvwptμ.wnpoc tjj <pt>O\"EL. It is a thinking rather than a reasoning from what is later to what was before. In Calcidius' opinion this resolutio was already used by Plato himself (p. 182). And for this he could have cited Albinus, who in his Tipo)..e:yoμ.e:voc riji; TIM-.wvoi; <pLAoaocp(oci; wrote: -r<j> ex <p oc L p \">1 T L X <i> X€)'_f)\">'jTOCL EV T LfLOCLC:,, T\">'jf)WV xoct e:up(axwv TijV UA\">')V ex riji; cxcpoctpfoe:wi; 1tixv-rwv -rwv e:t8wv (Plato, Ed. Hermann, VI, p. 222). The rest of the section was written by Calcidius in order to reach a point where the resolutio could be applied. The manner, in which he did so, is curious. Instead of taking the sensible world with its qualities and forms as evidence, he argues to the existence of a body of the universe, starting from the human body. In the first phrase Calcidius, speaking about things which are 'nearest to us', creates the impression-and perhaps he had it himself-that he is applying the resolutio. Instead, he elaborates an argument from the micro-cosmos to the macrocosmos which seems to come from another context, viz., with a philosophical discussion on the existence of the world as one whole. In Calcidius' context this is out of place.-The doctrine of the macrocosmos-microcosmos occurs also else-where in Calcidius' commentary. In par. 202 after contending that the human body consists of water, air, earth and fire because of its properties, he continues: Unde opinor hominem mundum brevem a veteribus adpellatum. The passage Est igitur in corporibus nostris contiguum quiddam, etc., (3n, 15 ss.) certainly depends on Plato, Tim. 31B: ,:wpta6ev 8e: 1tupo<; ou8e:v !xv 1to-re: opoc-rov yevOLTO, ou8e: <X7tTOV lxve:u TLVO<; O\"t\"e:pe:ou, O\"t\"e:pe:ov 8e oux lxve:u y'Yji;.

Let us give back to matter the things, viz., genus, quality and form which our thoughts have separated from it just now, and let us restore them, as it were, to their places, doing so not in a disorderly and arbitrary fashion but elegantly and in an orderly manner. Now order cannot exist without harmony; harmony is the companion of analogy, to analogy is coupled reason, reason is found to be inseparable from prov-idence, and providence is not without intellect nor intellect without mind. Thus God's mind modulated, ordered and adorned the whole body of the world. So, finally, the divine principl~, i.e., the Maker is found. The Maker, again, works and adorns every-thing according to the rational power and the majesty of His works. His works, however, are His concepts which the Greeks call ideas. Now the ideas are the exemplars of all natural things. And thus, in the third place, the exemplary principle is found. In conclusion, matter is found by means of the law and method of analysis (dissolutio); God, the Maker, Himself by means of the laws of composition (compositio) and the exemplar by God's works. NUNC ILLUD ALIUD sc. genus probationis. In par. 302 this second method of reasoning is caJled syllogismus; here it is given the name compositio. In Calcidius' eyes the two terms are equivalent. The present paragraph can be divided in two parts. First Calcidius explains the term compositio; after that, beginning with the words Ordo autem, he gives an argument. According to Calcidius, compositio is the process of mentally re-building the world, just as resolutio was that of analysing it. Describing the process of compositio, Cakidius comes to speak about order; this order is the starting-point of a real argument. If I am not mistaken, Calcidius was lead to these concepts of res.oliitio and compositio by a text such as that in Albinus X 5.

This last identification explains Calcidius' translation cumpositio (auv6eat~) as an equivalent of syllogismus. These concepts of resolutio and compositio reveal a certain lack in Calcidius' abstract thinking. Limited by the visual presentation of the mental process, his terminology is bound, not to say, domi-nated by the descriptive activity of analysis and synthesis. For separare animo see the quotations on p. 132. Evidently the re-solutio occupies a central place in Calcidius' thought. CUM CULTU ET ORDINE reminds one of congrua et moderata concretione in par. 303 (332, 15). ORDO AUTEM Here begins the argument. It is the well-known reasoning ab ordine ad ordinatorem, but given in great detail. The conclusion: \"and so the mind of God has ordered every-thing\" would have been more correct in this way: \"and so a mind has ordered everything, and this mind cannot be but the mind of God\". INVENTA ERGO EST DEMUM OPIFICIS DIVINA ORIGO Cp. 332, 14: Inventa igitur est origo silvestris. Both times also the term origo. See also 333, 8-9. OPERATUR PORRO OPIFEX Calcidius argues from the Maker to the exemplar. Whereas above the form was striking, here the content of the argument is remarkable. \"The Maker makes everything in accordance with His rational power and the majesty of His works. His works are the concepts which the Greeks called ideas\". The ideas are looked upon as the thoughts of God (cp. A. N. M. Rich, Mnem., 1954, p. 123-132). More striking still is the concept of 'works of God', to which are attributed rational power and majesty. The term opera dei makes one think of the creation; Calcidius also knows this idiom : Et mundus sensilis opus dei est (89, 20). But at another place, where he is not specially thinking of the creation, he says: Porro optimum dei opus est id quod intellegit (292, 20). This brings us close to the present text. An explanation of this fairly surprising tum in Calcidius' argument is found in the following words of Albinus (X 3): eocu't'ov cxv ouv xoct 't'IX EOCUTOU VO~fl.OC't'ot ix.et voo(11 (sc. o 6eo~) xoct oc G -r 1J ~ e v e p y e t oc oc u -r o u toe oc u 1t ix p x. et.

Calcidius maintains the idea of God creating while looking at the ideas, although, at the same time, these ideas are His thoughts. The supposition that Albinus influenced Calcidius is confirmed by tht> fact that the former also looks upon the ideas as God's thoughts. In par. 339 Calcidius almost literally renders Albinus' ~cm 3e: ~ [~ecx we; μe:v 1tpoc; 6e:ov v611mc; CXUTOU (Epit. IX 1; cp. II 2; IX 1-3). In par. 330 (354, 28-355, 1) one reads: ... idean, quae intellectus dei est aeternus aeterni (cp. 363, 7 and 366, 13). With this should, again, be connected the passage on Providence in par. 176. This second stage in the godhead (cp. ad par. 268) is not called Providence, because He foresees future events and understands them, but quia proprium divinae mentis intellegere, qui est proprius mentis actus et est mens dei aeterna. Est igitur mens dei de intellegendo aeternus actus. So there is question here of mens dei (cp. 333, 3) which is an aeternus actus. Providentia is God in so far as He thinks Himself. But this is identical with the idea which is intellectus dei aeternus aeterni. Hence the terms ideae and providentia stand for the same reality. But Calcidius fails to explain how this identity should be imagined. IGITUR SILVAM The conclusion is remarkable for more than one reason. First, for the term dissolutio instead of resolutio, which, maybe, is influence of the 3LcxLpouaL in Physics 184 a 22-23 (see p. 131). Secondly, Calcidius seems to imply that there are three ways of arguing, for he states: \"by means of disso-lutio we found matter, by compositio the Maker and ex operibus dei opificis the exemplar\", as though ex operibus were a special way of reasoning. One would have expected: \"by resolutio we found matter, by syllogismus the Maker and the exemplar\", but the use of the term compositio evidently excludes the reconstruction: \"by compositio we arrive at the Maker and the exemplar\". This confirms our opinion concerning the meaning of compositio, i.e., that it is used not for a real argument but rather for an introductory mental process. Now Calcidius does not use such an introduction when investigating the third principle, viz., the exemplar. Hence he was compelled to add something like ex operibus porro . . . to the words iuxta compositionis vero praecepta ipsum opi/icem deum."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 305 137 88) The principles [305] And because all these are principles, we must, all over again, discuss the principles. Now a principle is, first of all, a limit after which comes everything beginning from that limit. And because every principle, being an origin, precedes the coming into existence of things, it must be simple, without quality, and permanent. If the principle is not simple, it will be the same as the things proceeding from its substance. Thus the principle would not differ from the rest, even if one assumed priority in time, for the thing coming after the principle also exists from a certain time; but it is quite impossible that there should be no difference. So the origin of things is simple. Nor has it any quality, for if a quality is ascribed to it, it will, I think, be something composed of matter and quality, for everything possessing a quality has such a nature. Thus the principle is without quality. ET QUONIAM Calcidius attempts to treat the problem thorough-ly. \"The question is about principles, so one should first consider their requirements. Then one can see whether the so-called elements (fire, water, etc.) are principles. It is evident that they are not, but God, matter and the examples are\". This is the content of the argu-ment in par. 305-307. This train of thought has something illogical. First, the realities found are principles and, afterwards, they have still to be found. Calcidius probably regarded this argument as a confirmation of the preceding one. EST IGITUR INITIUM This de-finition of initium, especially striking on account of the term limes, is wholly explained from Aristotle: Primus ... , post quem sunt ettncta from Met. 1013 a 17-19: 7tC1.ac7Jv μe:v oov XOLVOV 'tWV cxpxwv 't O 7t p W 't O V dvC1.L o6&v ~ lcrnv ~ y(yv&'tC1.L ~ yLyvwax&'tC1.L (cp.

SIMPLICEM, SINE QUALITATE, PERPE-TUAM Calcidius mentions three distinguishing features of matter; the first two are discussed in par. 305, the last in par. 306. SI SIMPLEX NON ERIT The argument is: \"If the principles are not simple, the only distinction between principles and 'the rest' (cetera) is not more than one of priority and posteriority. This is not really an essential distinction and, therefore, impossible\". NEC HABET QUALITATEM The concept of simplicity implies being without quality. The division into paragraphs, at first sight un-"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"138 THE TREATISE ON MATTER fortunate, is quite correct. It would be incorrect to treat each of the three characteristics of the principles in a separate chapter: the first two are intimately connected. [306] The eternity of a principle is proved in the following way. If it were not eternal, it must have existed from a definite time; if so, the cause of its existence must necessarily precede the origin of the principles, and so there is something preceding the principle. But that a principle should precede another princi-ple is a foolish thought, so the principle of things is eternal. It is also immortal, for if it is perishable, it will have no possibility of perishing, since it cannot be dissolved into something simple nor into something composite. It cannot be dissolved into some-thing simple, because the principles alone are simple; hence the principle would be dissolved into what it is itself, and in this way there would be a restoration rather than destruction. But the principle cannot dissolve into something composite either, for in that case it will be kept in existence by the composite things themselves, and so there will be no question of a dissolution, for everything composite consists of the very combination of simple things. Nor is a dissolution into nothing possible, for there cannot be anything that is nothing. At any rate, if, 'as Plato says, the principle perishes, it will not come to new life through anything else nor will anything else arise from it. Thus we find that the principle of things is immortal. AETERNUM QUOQUE From the argument itself, Calcidius appears to take aeternus in the sense of 'not having become', 'without a beginning' (cxyevl)Toc;). As in par. 305 he connected simplex with sine qualitate, he now connects inmortalis with aeternus (inmortalis = cx6cxvocToc; or ~cp6ocpToc;: cp. the text from the Phaedrus quoted below). NAM SI NON AETERNUM Again a argumentatio per absurdum as in par. 305: \"We should be obliged to assume the existence of the principle of a principle\". The same idea is found in Aristotle, Physics 189 a 30: &G'C'.XL yip cxpx~ -njc; cxpx~c;.

As regards its form, Calcidius omits a negation in the first part of the dilemma. Fabricius observes:"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 306 139 accipiendwn est ac si scripsisset: non in simplex. Something similar is found in Physics I 6, where Aristotle argues that there can be neither one nor an infinite numbPr of principles; explaining this he I ( ' ' ) l. ' ' t' \" ' !\\ ' ' I ' I says: (J.LCXV SC. CXPX'YJV μi;;v ycxp <JU'f. 0 OV 't\"E, O't\"L oux t;V 't\"CX EVotV't\"Lot, CX7tELpouc; 8' on ... (189 a 12-13). Here the negation is missing in the second part (chelpouc; 8'). Calcidius does the same in 341, 13 ( ... neque ... est in terra nee iam in aqua; in terra quidem, ... ) and 362, 12-15 (Atque ut animam neqtte animatam dicimus neque exanimem -animatam quidem idea ... , exanimem vero qttia ... ). The argument is by no means simple. The point is that with principles there can be no question of dissolution into something simple or composite, nor into nothing. Dissolution into something simple is impossible, because in that case one would have to speak of restoration rather than destruction (cp. 90, 16-17, where a iactura actually is a recreatio; see also par. n8 ex.). In fact, simplicity is one of the characteristics of any principle, so that a dissolution into something simple would mean a return to itself. This excludes destruction. Moreover, dissolution into something composite is equally impossible, for this would not mean destruction but composition, since the principles are kept together in composite things. As in the first case 'dis5olutio' would be recreari, so in the second it would be contineri or a conexio. Finally, the third possibility, vi;,:., a dissolution into nothing, is to be rejected, by Calcidius, on the basis of the well-known Aristotelic argument (cp. par. 283).

Yet his argument differs plainly from Plato's and rather shows Aristotelic features. It i.; a Platonic concept but elaborated modo Aristotelico. This Aristotelic treatment becomes still more evident when elsewhere Calcidius is seen to translate Plato's text, showing himself well acquainted with its wording: lnitium porro sine ortit, quando quae gignuntur ex initio creantur, ipsum porro ex nullo initio.

However, for the rest he does not come nearer to the text of Calcidius. ee) The real principles [307] Now that we have explained what a principle is and of what kind it is, the next step is to see whether fire or earth or one of the other so-called elements is a principle. In my opinion, none of them can be said to be so, for not one of them is simple. They are bodies composed of various materials and natures. And from what has been ~aid it is clear that a principle must be simple. After discussing this point, it has to he proved that there are two principles of things, one opposed to the other, for this is the opinion not only of Plato but also of the earlier philosophers who agree on this point without exception. Some of them take heat and cold as principles, others humidity and drought, others find it in concord and discord or in unity and multiplicity, and in equality and inequality, as Pythagoras did-they all agree on the contrast between the principles but disagree whether these are eternal or temporal, incorporeal or corporeal; and one of them is presented as something active, the other as something passive. It is also necessary that principles do not arise from some-thing else nor from one another; on the other hand, everything must derive its being from them. What we indicated just now as 'something active' is God, and what as 'something passive' is bodily matter. But because the active principle, when in action, looks at an exemplar, the necessity of a third principle is thus stated, and so there are three principles, viz., God, matter and the exemplar. God is the first moving active principle; matter is that from which, as the primary source, everything that comes into being arises. QUIA IGITUR, Calcidius studies whether the so-called elements, water, earth, etc., are real principles. He must, of course, state that they are not, the reason being that these so-called elements are not simple. Although this is clear, the explanation of this non-simplicity"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 307 141 is noteworthy. One should expect: \"Since they are composed of nature (matter) and qualities\", but Calcidius says: ex diversis materiis naturisque concreta sunt corpora. He probably wishes to convey that fire, earth, etc., as they exist in the world never consist of mere. fire, etc., but are mixe<l with other materials (naturae is equivalent to materiae, cp. 334, 17-18: ex simplicium naturarum conexione, where naturae also clearly means elementa, materiae; cp. p. 42). Pure materials are only found in the world of ideas, cp. 302, 18: ignis purus et intetlegibilis ceteraeque sincerae substan-tiae). HIS ITA DIGESTIS The argument takes an unexpected turn. The question to be answered is: what then are these principles? Calcidius might have continued: \"Witness all philosophers, there are two principles, fundamentally opposed to each other. Different philosophers found this opposition in different materials and pow-ers\", etc. This is the actual content of the argument, but Calcidius gives the impression that he produces another proof for this thesis; he says: His ita digestis demons t rand um est duo esse initia rerum. This demonstration is no more than a reference to the consensus doctoritm. The curious structure of the argument is best understood, if seen against the background of the source from which it was derived, viz., Aristotle.

In the description of the former the Aristotelian substructure of the argument comes again to the surface, when God is said to be the origo primaria moliens et posita in actu, i.e., the first Mover and 't'O ev&py&(~ l>v.

According to Plato, the ideas are discovered first, then matter and, finally, God as the one who brings the connexion between these two powers (cp. Biiumker, o.c., p. 114). In Calcidius the ideas are scarcely more than an addition mentioned for the sake of completeness. They are by no means an integrating part. If their occurrence in his system pre-senting itself as Platonic had not been absolutely necessary, the ideas would have been omitted. In par. 304 the same thing occurred: here, too, the argument in favour of the existence of ideas had the character of a Platonic addition in a thoroughly Aristotelian treat-ise.-Deus et silva et exernplwm.

The end of the introduction to Calcidius' treatise on matter is in sight. The whole dialectical apparatus has evidently been derived from Peripatetic sources; naturally one is led to think of Adrastus (cp. p. 92). Calcidius had considerable difficulties in handling these Peripatetic arguments and concepts. He handled them in a manner quite his own. ~) Calcidius' own treatise on matter ixix) Its name and variability (308] Now at last we are going to discuss matter, which Pythagoreans, Platonists and Stoics unanimously consider to be the origin of things. It has, however, received its name from the pupils of Plato. Plato himself never used the name of matter (iSAYJ), but a great number of other names in order to explain its nature, since he wanted to quicken in us somehow a concept of it, on the basis of either its own nature or the affections and emot-ions of our souls. On the basis of its own nature he calls it 'the first matter', something 'resembling a soft yielding matter into which seals are pressed', 'the receptacle of things', and occasion-ally 'mother' or 'nurse of all generation'. He starts from the affections of those hearing about it, when he says that it is 'something to be grasped by means of bastard concept' and 'palpable without being noticed by those touching it'. All authors mentioned above agree that matter is wholly variable and convertible, but they give different explanations of its conversion and mutability. Some of them think that matter"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"144 THE TREATISE ON MATTER changes and assumes qualities by its own nature, because the result of alteration is only a change of quality, which quality, in their opinion, is nothing else than matter in a different state. We, on the other hand, do not agree that matter and quality are the same, for one of them is, as it were, the underlying material, the other an accident to that material. And this proves that matter is passive, for it is due to change that it assumes different qual-ities. NUNC 1AM DE SILVA TRACTABITUR After discussing the principles in general, Calcidius finally comes to matter itself. Pythagoreans, Platonists and Stoics agree on both the existence of matter and its mutability, although they disagree on the meaning of the latter. The terminology of matter differed considerably. PYTHAGOREI, PLATONIC!, STOICI The doctrines of the different schools have already been discussed. The absence of Aristotle is remarkable; the explanation is found in what follows. NOMEN VERO The name silva = UA'Y) for matter was invented by Aristotle. Due to his in-fluence the term UA'Y) had soon become generally accepted. So Calcidius can say that the name comes from the auditores Platonis; after all, Aristotle was an auditor Platonis himself. If I am not mistaken, Calcidius already included him among the Platonici in the preceding phrase. In par. 273 (304, 4-7) he says: Quam modo matrem, alias nutriciilam, interdum totius generationis gremium, non numquam locum adpellat (sc. Plato), quamque iuniores hylen, nos sitvam vocamus. Plato, iuniores and nos, all clearly form one group. Since, on the one hand, the term UA'Y) reminds one strongly of Aristotle and, on the other hand, his name is strikingly absent from the list of philosophers, Calcidius must indeed have reckoned Aristotle among Platonici. Hence he saw the relation between Plato and Aristotle in a rlifferent way than we do. And this explains why he mixed Aristotelian elements in his, officially, Platonic treatise. An indication of this attitude occurs in par. 283 (312, 17-19) where he says about Aristotle: Cuius sententia cum sit praeclara et nobilis e.t ad Platonici dogmatis cons£derationem satis adcommodata, non otiose praetereunda est. This attitude, moreover, is in complete agreement with the common practice of Middle Platonism, except for such 'strict' Platonists as Atticus. In order to achieve a com-plete reconstruction of Plato's system, Middle Platonists elaborate their accounts of Plato's statements with a number of Peripatetic"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 308 145 tends. Indeed they regarded the latter as in perfect agreement with Plato's own doctrine and, tht-.refore, as a perfectly justified supplement tu what they believed Plato had non treated in detail (and what, i,1 fact, he had not treated at all), in particular logics. They never seem to have realized for a moment that, in doing so, they enlarged Plato's doctrine with corpora aliena (cp. A.-]. Festugiere, La revelation d'Hermes Trismegiste, II 341 ss. and J. H. Waszink, Der Platonismus ttnd die altchristliche Gedankenwelt, in Entretiens Fon-dation Hardt, III, Geneve, 1955, p. 146-147). Hence Calcidius must have looked upon the Timaeus commentary by the Peripatetic Adrastus as a primarily 'Platonic' book, and, for that reason, may have used it without scruple for his own commentary. IPSE ENIM NUSQUAM According to van Straateu (Stud. Cath. 27 (1952) p. 242) a text of Hermodorus transmitted by Simplicius (In Phys. 247, 30 ss.) would reveal that Plato already used the term UAlJ. However, the fact that Hem10dorus used this term in order to explain Plato's doctrine, does not prove that Plato himself used it. Nor may this be concluded from the words of Aristotle in Physics (209 b n-13): 8Lo X<XL IlAIX't'WV TIJV UAlJV X<XL TIJV xwpav 't'<XU't'O (f)l)Cl'LV dvaL ev 't'cjl T tμa(ep • 't'O yocp μe:'t'<XAl)7t't'LXOV X<XL 't\"YJV xwpav ~v X<XL 't'<XU't'OV. Since Aristotle cited the book in which Plato explains this doctrine, the meaning of his words can be ascertained. It appears that in the Timaeus Plato did not use UAlJ in the sense meant here. When he used it, it means 'subject-matter', material. After discussing the principles (not only the xwpa), he says: \"now we have our material together\"; Tim. 69A: ''OT' oov 8~ 't'OC vuv ota 't'tx't'ocnv ~μ°Lv UAlJ 1tap1Xxe:L't'<XL 't'OC 't'wv aMwv yl:Vl) 8LuALaμl:va. Thus Aristotle explains Plato's doctrine with his own term which, to him, is synonymous with To μ.:T<iAlJ7t-'t'Lx6v. The quotation of Hermodorus, who indeed was one of Plato's immediate pupils, shows that the term UAlJ = 'matter' was accepted in the school of Plato at a very early date. SED ALIIS MULTIS Calcidius divides the names which Plato had given into two groups: 1) those based on the nature of matter, 2) those which 'are connected with the passiones commotionesque animorum nostrorum' -evidently he means 'names denoting the reaction of our mind on this reality', or names denoting how matter is known by us. In the first group are: prima materia; simile quiddam mollis cedeniisque materiae, in quam inprimuntur signacula; rerum receptaculum; mater; nutricula totius generationis; in the second group: adulterino quodam intellectu recordandum; contiguum sine tangentium sensu. Calcidius' use of the Philosophia Antigua, VIII 10"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"146 THE TREATISE ON MATTER word 'names' of matter is rather curious; the term is taken in a very broad sense. For this reason perhaps he used the very rare word nuncupamentum (not found in Lewis and Short). The first denom-ination is prima materia. If Calcidius himself had not stated that Plato did not denote matter by st'.lva ( = u):11), one would have been inclined to see the words prima materia as a translation of 1tpwTI) u)..'1). A clue to their actual meaning might be found in the two words et item. They are often used by Calcidius and always combine two ideas or words closely connected with each other: for instance, unum et item multa (335, 14), /undi et item contrahi (339, 19), pictoria et item /ictoria (354, 6); cp. 91, 17; 121, 6-7; 144, 15; 201, 13; 230, 13; 238, 7; 261, 2 ss.; 263, 8; 266, 17; 279, 15; 357, 19; 367, 17. Probably et item is a translation of the Greek n X(Xt. Thus prima materia may be closely connected with simile quiddam ... signacula. This last 'name' is rendering of exμocye:fov. In 351, 16-17 the translation of this Greek term is exactly the same. Now the word materia also occurs in the present description. Hence Calcidius can easily say: \"Plato calls matter materia, i.e., the matter out of which everything was made\", and than add himself: \"and this is the first matter, the prima materia\". Aristotle's term 1tpwTIJ UA'1) may well have prompted Calcidius to this addition although prima materia is not its trans-lation but silva.-Some, not the best manuscripts, read primo instead of prima. If this is correct, Calcidius has not made the ad-dition just discussed, and the two 'names' are even more closely connected, but this version can scarcely be accepted, since Calcidius uses the term materia principalis in another place (340, 13-14) where it is the same as materia prima. So prima materia was indeed a fixed term. The other names offer fewer difficulties: receptaculum = u1to-8ox~ (51A, cp. 49A); mater = fL'1l'\"lP (51A, cp. 50D); nutricula totius generationis: in par. 273, where Calcidius gives a similar list of names for matter, he writec;: totius generationis gremium, which is the translation of Tim. 49A: 1tcxcnic; .. ye:vfoe:wc; u1to8ox~v. Now Plato adds there ofov ·n6~V1)V which explains Calcidius' present formulation here. For ·n6~v'1) also see Tim. 52D, 88D. The two qualifications based on our grasp of matter are amply discussed by Calcidius in par. 345 ss., where he comments upon relevant passages of the Timaeus.

Lib. I De Placitis, c. 9). OMNIBUS VERO Pythagoreans, Platonists and Stoics agree that matter is entirely changeable, but they explain this fact differently. According to some, the variability of matter consists in the loss of its own nature (ex propria ratione converti); to them, change is receiving other qualities, which are only a certain shape and a certain aspect of matter, so that in reality matter and quality are identical. Calcidius takes his stand against this theory: nobis autem nequaquam placet eandem silvam esse et qitalitatem. In his opinion, matter is like a foundation or a substratum, and quality is some-thing added to it; the variability of matter consists in the fact that it accepts these qualities; hence it is patibilis. The authors meant here are the Stoics. In par. 3n he states: \"If forms and qualities are contained in matter itself, as the Stoics think, (the concept of) matter is superfluous\". (Also see par. 321 and 325). If, there-fore, Calcidius opposes the Stoics, he follows the opinion of the others, viz., the Pythagoreans and Platonists (including Aristotle). Calcidius' explanation of the Stoic standpoint will partly be discussed in the comment on the passibilitas of matter (par. 309). Meanwhile, reference must be made to Sextus Emp., Adv. Mathem.

To Calcidius' own opinion, which is scarcely more than a petitio principii, a return will be made in par. 309. For the moment we refer to Plotinus, Enn.

The fact that Cal-cidius gives little attention to the argument by Plotinus does not favour the supposition of his dependence upon Plotinus. Moreover, one may assume that the present criticism of the Stoic doctrine was a fairly general topic."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER [309] Moreover, change takes place in matter but without matter undergoing any change itself; that what changes is the qualities present in it and contained by it. For, if matter itself changes, it must needs change into something else and so cease to be matter. Now this is certainly wrong, for just as wax, fashioned in different shapes, does not change itself but only in its shapes-in itself it remains what it is, for the shapes are not wax itself-so I think, it is right to call matter passive, since it changes in form and shape without abandoning anything of its nature. The train of thought is clear: change does not affect matter itself, it is restricted to qualities. If matter could change at all, it would be matter no more. It is the same as with wax which, moulded into various shapes, remains wax; so matter assumes various forms but remains what it was. Because of this condition, matter is rightly called passive. The last two thoughts are muddled in Calcidius, so that the phrase sic opinor ... is distorted. One might also say that si1, opinor refers to the part of the sentence ending at recedat, not to the whole of it. Calcidius particularly wishes to stress that silva est patibilis-else why the repetition? To Steinheimer believing Calcidius to be de-pendent upon Plotinus, who calls matter &.1tix6~i:;, this stress creates a difficulty. He sees opinor as a sign of uncertainty in Calcidius. I cannot agree with this interpretation. This verb indicates that the question is still under discussion. Moreover, whenever Calcidius uses opinor, he is generally quite sure of his point (cp. e.g., 309, 23; 319, 4). It cannot, therefore, be denied that Calcidius considers matter to be patibilis. In point of fact, this was already evident from the first section of his De silva, where matter is described as eademque patibilis natura, quippe subiecta corpori principaliter, in qua qualitates et quantitates et omnia quae accidunt proveniunt. quae cum a natura propria non recedat, diversis tamen et contrariis speciebus eorum quae intra se recipit formisque variat1tr. The agreement in terminology is striking: sic opinor silvam quoque formis figurisque variatam, cum de sua condicione minime recedat, recte patibilem dici. As already seen (on par. 268 p. 32), Calcidius closely agrees with Plato: matter is the :x,wpoc which assumes everything without undergoing change in itself. On the other hand, patibilis does not seem to fit into this concept of matter, for one might say as well that matter is not affected and,"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 309 149 therefore, entirely 'impassive'. And to stress the point still further, elsewhere Calcidius himself says: Nam ipsa ex natura sua inpetibilis est nee ttllam fert perpessionem (375, 2-3; cp. inpetibili felicitate (106, 2-3); in 194, 25 he uses the term inpatibilis: cum sit inmortale animal et inpatibile ... ) ; and in par. 319 he explains: quando passionem quoque ipsam, quae propria eius videtitr, adimimus, ideo quod numquam ex propria condici(lne desciscat, sed aliis, id est corporibus intra eam perpetieniibus, Ula consors perpessionis putetur (343, 19-2:;:). With regard to this last text Steinheimer, of course, says: \"So, according to Calcidius, matter is not patibilis after all and, therefore, he seems to agree with Plotinus\". But this fails to explain Calcidius' repeated and explicit assertions that matter may be called patibilis. Steinheimer insists (o.c., p. 45) that this is an addition by CalciJius himself (\"eigene Zutat\"), but then the purpose of this addition must be explained which, from the stand-point of Plotinus, is quite impossible. The idea that Calcidius re-presents the period before Plotinus when the Platonists were still wavering between patibilis and inpatibilis, is much more plausible. Meanwhile, Steinheimer refers to a stdking panillel of Calcidius' quam quidem qualitatem nihilo minus essP.

None of these texts, however interesting as parallels, will ever prove a dependence of Calcidius upon Plotinus. Much more plausible, indeed, is the possibility of a dependence of both Plotinus and Calcidius upon a third person, N umenius. The latter strongly and continuously opposed the Stoics (par. 295-299). We suggested the possibility that th::! entire treatise on the Stoa (par. 289-294),"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER including par. 294, was borrowed from Numenius (p. 103). Anyhow, the latter appears to be the obvious common authority of both the present passage and the parallels occurring in Plotinus. For the first part of the present paragraph (337, n-14) Stein-heimer refers to Enn. II 4, 6: fo·nv d8oc; μe:'t'oc~OA'Yj e1; e:t8ouc; hepou.

The argument is this: \"If matter undergoes something, it must receive something, either this 1tcx6oc; itself or a condition different from its former condition. Now if another quality is added, matter will no longer be matter alone but matter with a definite quality\". Plotinus is here drawing another conclusion from an idea such as that given by Calcidius. Hence Plotinus cannot be a source of Calcidius; what is more, one cannot even speak of a real parallel. On the other hand, a convincing one is furnished by the other text cited in Steinheimer, viz., Enn. III 6, 18: ou ya:p Mvoc-rocL ixAAo -rL ~ o fo-rL ye:vfo6oct.

If then we want mentally to take away from it these things without which it cannot exist, we are able to give it the possession of them all, not in reality but in possibility. There are, however, two kinds of possibility: one, as when we say that seed hides the full-grown body and, therefore, is the living being in possibility; another, as when we say that 'that which in itself has as yet not what it is going to be but can assume forms and qualities from outside' is in possibility that which it is not yet, as, for instance, a shapeless mass of bronze or wax before it receives a form by the artisan's work. ETIAM HOC All philosophers concerned agree that matter is changeable; they also say that matter has neither qualities nor forms. However, in order to prevent misunderstanding, Calcidius adds at once that matter never occurs without qualities. He then tries to explain this by means of the concept of possibility.

Since a considerable part of Origen's sources is found in Middle Platonism (cp. Hal Koch, Pronoia und Paideusis, p. 129), the idea that Calcidius de-pended on Middle Platonism in general and on Numenius in partic-ular finds here a new confirmation. DENIQUE SI Matter being affected with qualities, but having no quality as such, Calcidius now studies the question of the relationship between matter as such and its qualities. Matter possesses qualities in possibility (possibilitate). Cakidius express.::s himself in an awkward, not to say clumsy manner. Instead of speaking of 'matter as such', he seems to think that its existence must be proved. It looks as though he is again applying his resolutio (cp. 332, 9: si ergo has qualitates ... volemus ratione animi separare; the volemus has a parallel in the volumiis of the present passage). This undeniable clumsiness is due to the fact that his sources provided him with only a restricted number of arguments which he used as much as possible, not sel-dom in contexts where they are entirely out of place.

The slight similarity between the arguments of these two authors is a matter of course, but Plotinus gives a penetrating analysis of all relevant problems, whereas Calcidius only refers to a generally-known distinction. It is also noteworthy that Calcidius is so absorbed in this problem of the poss£btlitas that he forgets to say, which kind of possibility actually belongs to matter. Obviously, this is the passive possi-bility, as appears from the example of wax in the previous para-graph.

Once more, it is evident that matter has a potentia passiva. yy) Refutation of the Stoa [3n] Therefore, if forms and qualities are enclosed in matter, as the Stoics think, a regulating activity of the Maker is super-fluous; but in my conviction, there must be a moulder of matter, as the Stoics themselves affirm. Hence the Maker impresses shapes into matter as into shapeless bronze or wax, and thus He must exist because the doctrini> requires it. QUARE The conjunction here is by no means self-evident. It seems to be the result of this reasoning: matter has been shewn to possess a passive potentiality as to forms and qualities. Hence (quare) there must also be an active principle imparting these forms and"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"154 THE TREATISE ON MATTER qualities. But if matter is said to enclose them in itself, such an active principle automatically becomes superfluous. UT STOICIS VIDETUR At last Calcidius mentions his opponents by name. He will do so again in par. 321: Quam quidem receptaculum eomm ad-pellat, quia non ex gremio silvae generatae species florescunt, ut putant Stoici, sed extrinsecus obveniunt ut in cera signacula (also see par. 325). In both cases his criticism of the Stoa is the same as in par. 308, but the form is different. Steinheimer quotes Enn. II 4, 7: d ouv 1tp6npov cxvcxyxlj TOV 81jμLoupyov e:LVIXL, TL !/kt TIX e(81j xocTix aμtxpix ev tjj UA7J dvocL. However, Plotinus' argument is the very opposite of Calcidius'. Plotinus says: \"If we are to accept the existence of a demiurge, why, then, those e(81J xocTix aμtxpcx in matter?\" This expression is, if I am not mistaken, a rendering of the Stoic term Myot a1tepμocTLxol. The argument of Calcidius is this: \"If matter has all these qualities by itself, why then are we to assume a Maker ?\"-\"But the existence of a Maker is necessary, as the Stoics themselves admit, so the doctrine requires a Maker who confers a form upon matter, by itself shapeless\". Steinheimer quotes Enn. II 5, 3: TO yixp 8uvcxμeL ~OUAETIXL hepou &7teA6ovToc; de; evepyetocv ixyea6ocL. Can this still be called a parallel? Both Calcidius and Plotinus attack the Stoic doctrine, but each in his own way. For instance, Plotinus says: o yixp 6eoc; IXUToi:c; eu1tpe1tdocc; !vexev e,macxyeTixL (Enn. VI 1, 27, cited p. 149). Calcidius says: ipsi etiam Stoici sanciunt (opijicem). The details of the arguments are strongly in favour of a relationship, but not of a dependence of Calcidius on Plotinus. A common source seems to be the obvious solution and this once more makes one think of Numenius. The difference between these two authors who use the same material is striking indeed. Calcidius gives the impression of being bound to his sources; Plotinus moulded his data into an original synthesis. 88) Matter eternal and unlimited [312] There exists a similar unanimity about the eternity of matter, for they think that it is everlasting because it is the summit and origin of things. But there is no unanimity at all on the question whether it is limited (that is, circumscribed). <In reality the point is clear;> for what is, circumscribed must necessarily have a definite size: now size belongs to a line, a plane or a body, and all these things have their own shape,"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 312 155 whether they are two- or three-dimensional. Now form is a kind of quality; therefore, if matter is limited, it will have a quality and a form by itself. But it has clearly been shewn that matter has neither form nor quality; therefore, it is infinite and entirely unlimited, not in the sense of extending immensely, vastly and unsurpassably, but unlimited as things that can be circumscribed by a limit but have not yet been limited mentally. And in the same way as we say that it is without quality or form, it is also unlimited in the sense that, before its adornment and as long as it is still matter, it is not actually circumscribed by a limit. NIHILO MINUS The third point unanimously accepted by philo-sophers is the eternity of matter, i.e., illimitability in time. They are, however, not unanimous on illimitability in space. Yet the existence of illimitability in space is self-evident (Calcidius omits this point in his argument,) for limitability means shape, and shape means quality. Therefore, if matter is limited, it would have this quality of itself. Now principles have no quality whatever (par. 305), so matter must be unlimited, in the sense not of 'being ex-tended infinitely', but of 'not yet limited before its moulding', which meanc; that it is limitable.-For perpetuam, cp. 333, 17. ARX ET ORIGO Calcidius is fond ot such phrases: /ons et initium (125, S), exordium et /ons (97, 7); see also 91, 17-18; 91, 20; 91, 22-23 etc. They will be listed in the edition Waszink-Jensen. MAGNITUDO AUTEM Steinheimer refers to Enn. II 4, 8: μeye66c; n et EXEL, ocvcxyx'rj xod ax,'ijμot exetv. QUAE INFORMIS Here Steinheimer quotes Enn. II 4, 6: ~ OE (sc.

The latter is quite different from what Calcidius says, as is already evident from the article -r6 before &1mpov: to Plotinus matter is infinity itself. On the other hand, a most important parallel is furnished by the text of Galen (see p. 151), where the identity of the philosophers who think matter limited, comes to light. Once more, they are the Stoics, who regard matter as a awμoc (cp. par. 289) and hence as something limited. Now Galen argues: et OE 1t£1tepocaμev'rjv dvocl (j)otO'L (sc. ot !:'t'WLxot) Xott 7ttpotO'L XE\"XPYJ!J,tV\"r,V, xott ax_'ijμot o'ij1,.6v we; EXCX't'YJ't'O, &'t'07tOV ycxp EO\"t'L tolotc; 1tepottv6μevov awμot 7ttpotO'L μ~ μe-rcx: <JX~!J,Ot't'O<; 7tCXV't'(l)c; U7tcxpxetv, d x«t μ~ O'UVVOOL't'O 't'OU't'' OtU'C'c'.j> x«e· u1t6-"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER 6 1) ~ > \\ .,... ,l -a· '1 II.

II 4, 1: OLo6ocm OE xoct awμot ocu-tjj &1toLOV OCUTO awμoc Aeyov-re:c; • xoct μeye:6oc; OE. Both Plotinus and Calcidius argue against the Stoa. But the manner in which they do so is quite different and nothing points to a dependence one way or another. INFINITA PORRO \"Not infinity in the sense of infinite exten-sion\", as Calcidius is quick to declare. He follows Aristotle: De gen. et corr. 318 a 20: XotT' evepye:LOCV μe:v ycxp OUOEV EGTLV &1te:Lpov, who, moreover, contrasts this with a potential infinity in the sense of infinite divisibility (ouvocμe:L o' &7tt ~v OLOCLpe:aLV, ib.; about this see the comment on par. 315, p. 159). In this point, however, Calcidius does not follow him, nor does he distinguish between actual and potential infinity as did Aristotle in Physics 206 b 14-15, where 'potentially infinite' is equivalent to 'inexhaustible'. He only says that matter is unlimited in the sense of 'not yet limited', 'poten -tially limited' not 'potentially unlimited'. All this amounts to \"matter is unlimited in the sense that as such it has no limitations; it is not yet vallata\". And because a 'matter as such' does not exist in reality, he adds mentis consideraiione-it is as though he just adds: \"this is no more than an activity of the abstracting intellect\" (see in par. 310: mentis consideratione, cp. p. 152). That this is really what Calcidius means to say is proved by the striking parallel a little further on: velut nondum ante exornationem dumque adhuc silva est fine circumdatam. A similar idea is in Aristotle, Physics 204 a 5-6: 0 m:qiuxoc; txm μ~ tx_e:L OLe;ooov ~ 7tEpotc;. In imitation of Aristotle, Plotinus also rejects an existence of the actual infinity. Steinheimer rightly refers to Enn. II 4, 7: e:t oihwc; &1te:Lpov, we; CXOLe:;LT'Y)TOV, we; Qt.IX fo-rL TOLOUTOV TL EV TOL<; oom ..• The CXOLE:~LT'Y)TOV reminds one of insuperabiliter porrecta.

Platonis I 5, p. 87, 6-10 Thomas). Calcidius' infinita has the same 1) \"Even though one may exclude this from one's thought\", i.e., \"though one can consider it separate from this\". Galen must have in mind the kind of abstraction which Calcidius uses again and again."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 313 157 meaning as /inibilis. Hermogenes called matter infinita; but Ter-tullian's refutation of this statement reveals no special relationship, except for the distinction between infinity in time and infinity in space (Adv. Hermog. 38, 1, p. 58, 10 ss. Wsz. ). e:e:) Matter without increase or decrease [313] \"Matter is neither liable to increase nor to decrease\", they say.-Rightly so, because this would mean that something could come into existence out of nothing or perish into nothing, both of which are impossible. That which increases grows by addition of size, and, apart from matter, there is, in my convic-tion, nothing from which such an increase could be derived or into which 'that which flows away from matter', matter thus being emptied, can be received (lit.: diminished). This passage may be summarized as follows: \"matter cannot become larger or smaller, because it is itself the basis of every in-crease and the terminus of every decrease\". Calcidius' argument concerning mcrease may be formulated in this way: 1 a Quod. augetur, accessu magnitudinis crescit. b Praeter ipsam silvam nihil est, ex quo fiat accessio. c Ergo: silva ipsa si augetur, ex nihilo fit accessio. 2 a =IC b Sed ex nihilo non aliquid subsistere potest (et igitur nulla inde accessio venire potest). c Ergo: silva augeri non potest. With regard to decrease, Calcidius uses a similar argument but expresses himself somewhat inaccurately. He intends to say: \"decrease occurs by the recession of size, but nothing can recede into anything else but matter; so matter itself cannot decrease\". A more correct formulation would have been: vel in quod id, quod ex silva (eam inaniens) defluit, defluere potest. The thesis underlying this argument is Aristotelian, as was shewn in the comment on par. 283 (p. 77).

(The other text quoted by Steinheimer (II 4, 9) shows some verbal similarity to the corresponding passage in Cal-cidius, but refers to quite a different question, viz., the relation between matter and quantity). Needless to say that the problem, raised in this as well as in the two subsequent sections originated in Stoic circles, for it bears upon typically material qualities. According to the Stoics, matter is a body, something material. The very words of Calcidius show that no real dissension existed on the point that matter neither increases nor decreases. Hence the Stoa must also have agreed. This conclusion is confirmed by the sources: Stobaeus, Eel. I 133, 6 W. (Arii Did., fr. Phys. 20 Diels; S.V.F. II 317): Xpucrbmou ~Twi:xou.

But a thing cannot expand (lit.: 'flow out') without humidity nor shrink without contracting. Neither of these lacks quality, and matter has none. Hence matter does not expand as something liquid nor shrink as something contractible. SUNT QUI Fabricius rightly notes where the divergence of opin-ions lies: Stoicorum haec opinio. Calcidius refers to the same doctrine, namely that there are contracting and expansive forces in the universe, the result of which is a process by which matter grows thinner and denser (cp. Baumker, o.c., p. 351, 369). Stein-heimer quotes Enn. II 4, 9, but Plotinus discusses a different pro-blem. He also refers to Enn. II 4, 8, where Plotinus says that matter is neither solid nor aery (ou 1tuxvov oux. ocpotL6v). This is a very different question from the one treated by Calcidius, that matter is liable to expansion or shrinking. Steinheimer attached more significance to the wording of the two passages than to their real meaning and content."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 314-315 TJTJ) Matter divisible? 159 [315] There are also who believe that matter is infinitely divisible. But whatever is divided (lit.: 'cut') will be composite, not simple, and in a definite place; this is a quality of quantity; hence matter will not be divisible, for it lacks both quantity and quality, though it accompanies them. But if, considering that bodies with quality and quantity, which are contained by it, can be divided, we say that matter itself can be divided together with these bodies, this will not be an unreasonable or an incon-venient presumption. SUNT ITEM QUI PUTENT INFINITAE SECTIONIS PATIBILEM SILVAM By 'potentially infinite' (see ad par. 312, p. 136) Aristotle meant to say that everything material is infinitely divisible. The problems arising from this are treated by him in De gen. et corr. 316 a 14 ss. The Stoa defended this theory, for, to them, matter is a awμoc: cp. par. 292 dividuam et usque quaque mutabilem (321, 17); see Stobaeus, Eel. I 142, 2 W. (S.V.F.

So Plotinus simply persists in what Calcidius puts forward as a premise but omits to carry through to its logical conclusion. This striking parallel reveals the points of view of the two authors to the question whether matter is passive. Plotinus is radical: C;>,'YJ &.1toc6~~ ecr-rLv (this is also stressed in the text just quoted: r.oc6-r;'t6~ = awμoc). Calcidius also knows that in reality matter is not liable to 1toc61J (inpetibilis), yet he he-litves one may say that silva patibilis est (cp. ad par. 309, p. r48). Steinheimer only saw the similarity in the presentation of the problem, not the difference in the solutions. However, this last issue is decisive; everything points to a stage before Plotinus. Calcidius really hesitates between two thoughts, whereas Plotinus makes a clear choice. Now the interesting fact is that one finds a similar attitude to a similar question in Numenius. The latter answers the question whether the soul is tridimensional in this way: \"it is not such by itself, but xoc-roc auμ~e:~1Jx6~, that is, because of the body in which it is\": 't'TI \\jlux.7i xoce' EIXU't'~V μe:v 1tpocrF:cr't'L 't'O <X.OLIX.Cf't'IX't'OV, XIX't'IX cruμ-~E~'Y)XO~ oe: -rcj) EV CJ> Ecr't'L OLIXCf't'IX't'cj) ClV't'L cruv6e:c.upe:L't'IXL xixt IXU~ 't'f)LX.~ oLixcr-rix-r~ (Nemesius, Ile:pt q,ucre:c.u~ &.v6pw1tou, p. 69, Matth.; Leemans, test. 29). (The term cruv6e:wpe:i:-rocL reminds one of fingamus and prae-sumptio in Calcidius). This parallel is highly important: in one case there is a concession to the tendency to make matter corporeal, in the other a similar concession to making the soul co1poreal. Both are the results of the same line of thought. If it is borne in mind that Numenius certainly was one of Calcidius' main authorities, the conclusion is imperative: Calcidius' standpoint in this question was inspired by Numenius.-Hermogenes also thought matter dispartibilis (Tertullian, Adv. Hermog. 39). In Tertullian the argument fits into a different type of discussion, hut its presence shows that the problem was a common one in Middle Platonism.-Some particulars: comitetur (340, 8), cp. 337, 24-338, I. Praesumptio (340, n), cp. 305, 7 and 345, 5 (p. 174). 66) Summarizing conclusion [316] Thus our opinion that matter is not fire, earth, water or air, but a primary material and the deepest foundation of cor-poreal things is correct. By itself it has no quality, form, quantity nor figure, but all these are connected with it by the power of"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 316-317 161 the Maker in order that both the whole body (i.e., the universe) and every separate thing have their perfection, and all things have their variety in common. RECTA EST Calcidius now draws his conclusion from what has been said before. He repeats par. 307: arbitror quippe non recte h01'um quid initiu,m putari. haec enim omnia minime simplicia. This thesis has now been proved to be correct. MATERIAM PRIN-CIPALEM Cp. primam materiam (336, 16; see Zeller, II 320, n. 2). ET CORPORIS PRIMAM SUBIECTIONEM Cp. 299, 16 subiecta corpori P,incipaliter; 306, 20; 341, 2; 342, 13; 345, 17-18; 361, 5-6, 12. The statement that neither earth, not fire, etc., are real principles is based on Tim. 51A: fl,'rJ't'Epcx xcxt u1to~ox~v μ~n y!ijv μ~n ixepcx μ~TE mip μ~n u~wp (cp. 358, 27). As parallel texts may be quoted the passage of Apuleius already cited above: non ignem neque aquam nee aliud de principiis ... and Albinus' Epit. X 8; Albinus asserts that God is not a awμcx: if God were a awμcx, He would be corporeal and so be fire or earth, etc.; but, Albinus says, !:xcxa't'6v y& touTwv oux cxpx_Lx6v: these do not possess the character of cxpx_~. To Calcidius water, earth, air or fire are not principles: the principle is an elementary matter, the first foundation of all that is material. This is his con-clusion in par. 316. But realizing that he simply presupposed the existence of this materia principalis, he must still prove it. This is now done modo Aristotelico, that is, by means of an analysis of change (cp p. 133). u) Matter the general substratum ot things [317a] It is easily proved that matter is really the tinder and the deepest foundation of all that is corporeal, namely from the change of the elements into one another and from the un-stable alterations of qualities. QUOD VERO In the light of the explanation just given the in-troductory phrase might be translated in this way: \"That such a P,ima subiectio really exists, appears from ... \"; sit would then have the meaning of existat. Although this would render the meaning of the following passage (par. 317-318), yet silva must be supplied as the subject of sit, in other words, sit must be a copulative verb. Calcidius has said: \"Matter is not water, etc., but prima subiectio\"; Philosophia Antiqua, VIII II"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"162 THE TREATISE ON MATTER and he continues: \"That it really is prima subiectio is evident from ... \". This formulation suggests that the existence of matter is taken as an established fact, and that here only light is shed on one of its aspects, just as in the preceding sections. But from the content it is evident that what is given is an actual proof for the existence of matter. Both the formulation of the introduction and the place of the argument suggest that Calcidius did not realize at all or insufficiently the purpose of the argument. One might say that feeling the necessity of a discussion on this subject, he inserted an argument already promised but not given in par. 302. Some details: FOMES As tinder is the material to catch fire, so matter is the material to receive the elements, fire, water, etc. (see Fabricius, ad loc.); elsewhere Calcidius uses fomenta generationis (61, 15, cp. 348, 13). For the combination fomes et prima subiectio see 338, 19 (p. 155), where Calcidius' partiality for such phrases is noted. EX ELEMENTORUM IN SE CONVERSIONE MUTUA Further on (342, 12) one reads in illa corporum mutua permutatione. This text reminds one of 305, II: mutua ex alio in aliud resolutione; in both cases the same phenomenon is discussed, on which Calcidius founded his resolutio in par. 274, 299 and 304, and which now serves as a basis for an Aristotelian argument. Meanwhile, it will become clear that he considered it to occur already in Plato (see ad 346, 23, p. 177). The term inconstanti is also found in 345, 1-2: ob inconstan-tem eorum mutuamque ex alio in aliud conversionem, which is an evident parallel of the present passage. The instability of change in qualities is stressed by the author in order to show that matter by itself has not a single quality. [317b] Now earth has two qualities of its own, viz., cold and drought.-Let us now pretend that earth can partly change into another element-. In water, too, we find two qualities, viz., humidity and cold. The quality proper to earth is drought, that to water humidity, whereas the nature of cold is common to both. So, when earth flows out and is partially changed into water, drought will change into humidity; but cold, which is common to both elements, remains in its own state, for it is no longer in earth and not yet in water: not in earth because what changes ceases to be earth, but not in water either because, while the change and transition are taking place, it is as yet not wholly and perfectly changed to the new state, i.e., it has not yet come"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 317-318 163 to the nature of water. The only possible conclusion is that cold must be somewhere else, for it cannot exist without a subject. Now reason affirms that this something can only be matter. [318] Air, we continue, has two qualities, viz., warmth and humidity. It appeared that two qualities are also found in water, viz., humidity and cold. Here again there will be qualities which appear to be contrary, viz., cold in water and warmth in air; but humidity is common to both. So, when water changes into vapour and, during this change, that which has evaporated is absorbed and maintained by air, then, I think, cold changes into warmth, but the conunon humidity remains, not, however, in the womb of air nor in that of water. Yet it must be somewhere: hence it must be in matter. In the same way, fire has two qualities, viz., drought and warmth; air, however, as we saw just now, has warmth and humidity, so these too have a common quality, warmth. The characteristic quality of fire is drought, that of air humidity. When, therefore, air becomes fire and partly changes into the nature of fire, humidity changes into drought, but warmth, their common quality, will not remain in fire nor in air, yet it cannot be nowhere. Hence it will remain in matter. From all this it is evident that in this mutual change of bodies one discovers that matter is the oldest and deepest foundation, like soft wax, in which imprints are made, or a common womb of everything generated. The argument strongly reminds one of a passage from Aristotle's De gen. et corr. The most important common trait is the attribution of twofold fundamental qualities to the four elements; 330 b 3 ss. : TO μe:v yocp 1tup 6e:pμov xod ~l)p6v, o o' &.~p 6e:pμov xocl. uyp6v (ofov a.Tμl.c; yocp o &.~p).

Yet there are also differences. Aristotle wishes to prove something different from Calcidius: the former stresses that everything changes into every-thing, whereas the latter proves that underneath this change there exists matter. One may say that Calcidius has added an idea found elsewhere in Aristotle: 6Tt /3e:'i: TL cxe:l. u1roxe:'i:a8ixt (Physics 190 a 14; cp. the comment on par. 284). But there is more in Calcidius. He Joes not just say: \"there must be something underlying this change\" but repeats again and again: \"cold, etc., must be some-where\" or \"it cannot be nowhere\". In this he joins Plato himself. This, again, shows, how closely Plato and Aristotle an~ connected in his eye. The explanation of details is facilitated by the fact that the same thought occurs throughout this passage. aliquatenus (341, 10; 342, 8) = ex aliqua parte (341, 5). in terra quidem (341, 13): as in 334, 14 (in simplex, cp. p. 139), the negation is missing; esse in terra means 'to be earth' in the same way as in nulla substantia esse (175, 2) means 'not to be a substance' (cp. in substantia positum, 203, 23; 264, 23). Or should in terra be deleted? In this case its pre-sence may be explained by the twofold in terra in the preceding line. resoluta (341, 24-25) reminds one of resolutione in 305, 12, etc.; for vapores, see otov hμl.i; ya:p o cx~p in the text of Aristotle just quoted (330 b 4) OPINOR (342, 1) The same is used elsewhere, when it was, in fact, borrowed from others (cp. 309, 23; 3n, 8;"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 319 337, 18). in naturam ignis (342, 8): cp. in aquae materiam (341, 17; cp. p. 124). The observation at the beginning of par. 317 (-Let us ... -), seems to refer to the well-known question whether all elements change into one another or an exception must be made for the element of earth (cp. p. 180). Already in par. 302-304 (resolutio-syllogismus) the Platonic line of thought was weak: matter being the dominating concept, the ideas were no more than accessories. In the present argument on the existence of matter, the Aristotelian trend is again strong. Nevertheless, Calcidius remains convinced that he is actually inter-preting the doctrine of Plato. Still, in several places the influence of Numenius is visible from whom, as it seems, Calcidius' concept of matter was derived. The Aristotelian part of the argument may have reached Calcidius through Numenius. This is almost certain in the case of the resolutio (cp. p. 132) and might well be true for his concept of the relation between the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle. However, Albinus should not be forgotten either, as will be evident from what follows. Nor should Adrastus remain un-mentioned, for it is just possible that he too contributed to Calcidius' work (see ad par. 383-388). xx) Matter neither corporeal nor incorporeal [319] After discussing these problems, we have now to consider whether matter is a body. In my opinion, we cannot simply call it either a body or something incorporeal, but we must say that it is potentially both corporeal and incorporeal. [1] What is properly called body is composed of matter and quality; but matter does not consist of matter and quality; therefore, it is not a body. [2] Next, no body is without quality; but matter by itself is without quality; therefore, it is not a body. [3] More-over, all bodies have a shape; but matter by itself is shapeless; therefore, it is not a body. [ 4] Then, every body is defined and limited; but matter is indefinite and unlimited; therefore, it is not a body. [5] Moreover, we can place all kinds of body in cate-gories. Thus we call a body 'essence', because, at different mo-ments, it can sustain opposed qualities, one of which must necessarily be found in it. We call it 'quantity', when it has length, width and thickness. We also say that it has 'quality'. Comparing it with another body, we say that it is larger, smaller"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"166 THE TREATISE ON MATTER or alike, which comparison the Greeks call 1tp6~ -rt; for what is larger cannot be conceived without being compared with what is smaller, nor what is alike without comparison with something else which is alike; and in this way we also derive the other qualifications (of bodies) from the categories. But we take away all this from matter, even its passivity seemingly proper to it; and we do so, because matter never loses its own condition but only gives the impression of undergoing things, when other things, viz., bodies, undergo them within matter. In short, its passivity is such that it does not change into something else; but, since it takes up things liable to change, it is incorrectly thought to undergo something. <Therefore, it is not a body.> [6] Finally, just as God, the first operating and creating principle, is not a genus nor subject to any genus, likewise the first passive prin-ciple, matter, the other origin of things, is neither a genus nor subject to any genus. And hence, because it is a principle, we cannot think of anything earlier. [7] This being so, a body is perceived by the senses, but matter is not perceived by the senses; therefore, matter will not be a body. [8] And also matter is something simple and not composite, but a body is not simple and is composite; therefore matter is not corporeal. [320] But I say that it is not incorporeal either, [1] for whatever is incorporeal cannot undergo anything corporeal and can never become a body; but matter, provided with qualities, quantities and figures, and decorated with every adornment, became body and world by the action and operation of the Maker; therefore, it is not incorporeal either. [2] Next, if it is a body, it can be perceived by the senses; but it cannot be perceived by the senses; therefore, it is not a body. But if it is incorporeal, its nature is intelligible; but it is not intelligible; therefore, it is not incorporeal. Hence it is correct that we call it simply and, in accordance with its nature, neither corporeal nor incorporeal, but potentially both a body and not a body. QUIBUS ITA DECURSIS Calcidius broaches the question of the real foundation of all the preceding problems, viz., the question whether matter is a body. The Stoa answered in the affirmative; their doctrine on matter hinges on it. But Calcidius disagrees. To him matter is not a body, but at once he adds \"nor is it incor-poreal\". What is it then? \"It is potentially both corporeal and"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 319-320 167 incorporeal\". The first part of this assertion is also found in Aris-totle. In De gen. et corr., the book from which the greater part of the preceding sections was borrowed, he says: 1tpWTOV μev 'tO ouvaμ&L (l'WμIX IXLa6'YjTOV ocpx_~. O&tmpov o' !XL EVIXVTLWrr&L,:; (329 a 32-33). (For matter as the f i r s t principle see p. 143.) But Aristotle is silent on potential incorporality. Calcidius, denying the actual incorpor-ality, affirms that it is potentially incorporeal. The thesis that matter is neither corporeal nor incorporeal is not original. A strong similarity with Calcidius' thesis is in Albinus, Ep ·t VIII ' \"'' T ( • \"~ ) \" -.. \" \" • ' t . 3: TOLIXUT'Yj o OU(l'IX SC. 'Yj Ul\\'Yj OUT& (l'<uμIX IXV &L'Yj OUT& IXO'<u-μixTOV, ouvaμ&L O& (l'Wμix. (The addition of ouvaμEL OC(l'WμIXTOV would make the resemblance perfect.) Next, Apuleius wrote: sed neque corpoream nee sane incorpoream concedit esse (De dogm. Plat. I 5 p. 87, 10-11 Thomas). Finally, about the doctrine of Hermogenes Tertullian states: Prima, inquit, facie videtur nobis incorporalis esse materia, exquisita autem ratione recta invenitur neque corporalis neque in-corporalis (Adv. Hermog. 35, 2, p. 54, 19-20 Wsz.). All this gives the impression that the doctrine under discussion was fairly common in Middle Platonism (cp. J. H. Waszink, Vig. Christ. 9 (1955), p. 132). The typical feature of Calcidius' theory is that matter is potent-ially incorporeal. This statement should probably be connected with his former ones concerning a twofold matter, a so-called silva corporea and a silva intellegibilis (see ad 301, 1 and 302, 15-17, p. 43). Just as the silva corporea is potentially corporeal, so the silva intellegibilis is potentially incorporeal (=intelligible). This point will be discussed below. Plotinus again gives a clear and emphatic answer: \"matter is incorporeal\" (Enn. II 4, 9: oc(l'wμixTo,:; oe xixl. ~ UA'Yj). As elsewhere Steinheimer tries to minimize the difference between Plotinus and Calcidius: \"Plotin begniigt sich damit nachzuweisen, <lass sie nicht korperlich sei. Diesem Nachweis widmet auch Chalcidius das um-fangreiche Kapitel 319, wogegen der Beweis, <lass sie nicht un-korperlich sei, kurz in c. 320 abgetan wird. Hat nun auch Plotin sich nicht mit denselben Worten dariiber ausgesprochen, so ist <loch ein Widerspruch zu seiner Lehre hierin nicht erhalten, da er jede Realitat der Materie verneint, ihr aher die Moglichkeit alles zu werden einraumt\" (o.c., p. 45). Yet, even if it were true that there is no contrast between the two standpoints-Steinheimer rather simplifies the problem-, the fact remains that because of the differ-"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"168 THE TREATISE ON MATTER ent formulations a dependence of Calcidius on Plotinus is, indeed, far less likely than Steinheimer presumes. The former treats this question in the same way as is done by some Middle Platonic authors. Hence we rather think of a dependence on this school. Moreover, Albinus, who comes nearest to Calcidius in formulation, also provides material points of agreement with Calcidius, e.g., Epit. X, where the attributes of another principle, viz., God, are discussed. Another point of agreement is mentioned in the dis-cussion of Calcidius' resolutio (par. 274, p. 50). QUIPPE QUOD Calcidius proceeds by demonstrating that matter is not a body. The first three arguments are not very impres-sive: 1) Body is matter and quality; matter is not matter and quality; matter is not a body. -Once the qualities as explained by Calcidiusin 337, 6-8 (p. 137) are accepted, this argument is conclusive. It should be compared with what Albinus (X 7) produces in order to prove the incorporality of God: d yocp a&μoc o 6e6c;, e~ 5A'Y)c; ocv ELY) xoct et8ouc; • OLIX TO 1tiiv cr&μoc O\"UVOUOCO\"(J,CX TL ELVIX.L EX TE l)J..Y)c; :v..oct TOU O\"UV ocutjj ELOouc; •.. &-ro1tov oe: TOV 6eov £~ l)A'Y)c; ELVOCL xoct Et8ouc; · OU yocp EO\"TOCL IX7tAouc; ouoe: ocpxtx6c; • WO\"TE IXO\"W(J,IX.TOc; OCV ELY) o 6e6c;. Steinheimer quotes Plotinus, Enn.

Calcidius does not maintain that matter is incorporeal. The line of thought is, indeed, the same but, by itself, does not favour a dependence of Calcidius on Plotinus. 2) No body is without quality; matter is without quality; matter is not a body. -This reasoning is the same as the preceding one, only the form has been changed: instead of \"body is always matter and quality\" Calcidius starts from the major \"body is never without quality\". Steinheimer refers correctly to Enn. II, 4, 8: Koct 8-rt μe:v μ~ cr&!J.oc, EL1tEp ix1totoc;, o~Aov • ~ 1tOLOT1JTOC !~et. Undoubtedly, in various forms this argument had often been used against the Stoa. Actually all present arguments of Calcidius are based upon the principle of the simplicity of matter. 3) All bodies have shape; matter has no shape; matter is not a body. -Usually Calcidius takes quality and shape together. Here they are taken separately, probably in order to make the series of arguments more impressive. Geometrical figures, as every-one knows, have a very important place in Plato's philosophy; it may be for this reason too that they are used here. Steinheimer"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 319-320 169 mentions Enn. II 4, 13: \"H n toL6'l\"Y)i; nji; UAYJi; ou μop(f)~-Such parallels, however, are no proof for a dependence. 4) All bodies are finite and limited; matter is infinite and un-limited; matter is not a body. - In par. 312 Calcidius discussed whether matter is limited. The limitation of all bodies is a well-known point in the doctrine of Aristotle (cp. p. 136). The text quoted by Steinheimer (Enn. III 6, 16: EV oe; tjj u):n ouoe; TO oux tX(f)WpLCrμevov. OU yixp cr&μoc) is DOt relevant. 5) All bodies can be classified under the categories; but matter can not; matter is not a body. - The fifth argument is here re-duced to its simple proportions. Calcidius greatly elaborated the maior and minor but failed to give an explicit conclusion. The form-ulation of his argument has some remarkable details. One can follow him when saying: dicimtts corpus essentiam; but when he continues: idem hvc dicimtts quantitatem, one would add habere rather than esse. What he wants to say is, of course: \"we say that a body has a definite size\". The categories will be fully discussed in par. 336. The elaboration of the minor \"we deny matter all categorical qualifications\" leads to an old problem. But what then about passio, since, to Calcidius, matter is patibilis? The solution is that there is no real pati, but matter may be called 'passive' in so far as change of qualities occurs. (See the remarks on p. 148-149; also p. 159-160 on secabilis). In this way Calcidius may say: \"we even take away from matter its seemingly own passio (we call it 'passive'), because we think that it never relinquishes its proper condition\". Calcidius' conclusion clearly presupposes the passio silvae. He persistently speaks of passio silvae and patibilis in spite of the fact that, strictly speaking, this is incorrect; and he says so himself. 6) The reasoning which follows now is more difficult. Calcidius wants to say: like God, the other principle, viz., matter, is not a genus nor belongs to any genus. In other words, a principle is a thing that cannot be classified at all and, for that reason, cannot be said to belong to the genus 'body'. So matter is not a body. One may also say: If matter is assigned to the genus 'body', we suppose that there existed something prior to matter. In conformity with this Calcidius adds: \"And since it is a principle, therefore, we should not think of anything prior\". The assertion that matter neque genus est neque ulli subiacet"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"170 THE TREATISE ON MATTER generi recalls a text of Albinus, stating that God ou't'e: yevoc; EO\"'t'tv oun e:!8oc; ou-re: 8Locqiopcx. -e:!8oc; and 8Locqiopcx fall under (subiacent) the yevoc; and, therefore, are understood in the statement neque ulli subiacet generi. And now one also understands why the argument opens with: like God, matter is . . . This reference to the divine principle finds its explanation in Albinus, whose speculations about God Calcidius had constantly in mind here. 7) A body is perceptible by the senses; matter is not perceptible by the senses; matter is not a body. - This argument is quite clear; with Steinheimer one may refer to Enn. II 4, 12: octpe:-r~ oocroc ou -roci:c; octcr6~cre:crLv ... <>'TL μ~8e: crwμoc. Still, the words Quae cum 1'.ta sint present a problem. What has this argument, which is quite sufficient in itself to do with the previous one? If I am not mistaken, Calcidius saw the minor in the latter (matter is a principle) as a philosophical premise to the present minor. 8) Matter is simple; a bodyisnotsimple; matter is not a body. -At last the principle argument turns up. Albin us said: ou yiip fo-rocL o:1tAouc; ou-re: ixpxLx6c;. See p. 168. Steiuheimer also refers to Plotinus, Enn. II 4, 8: ~e:i: 8e ocu-r~v μ~ cruv6e:-rov e:!vocL, ixhl,ix o:1tAouv xoct fv 'TL -rr. ocunjc; qiucre:L. However, such parallels can never prove a depender.ce. The following arguments are meant to prove the second part of the thesis, that matter is not incorporeal either. 1) What is incorporeal can never become corporeal; matter can become corporeal; matter is not incorporeal. - The language of Calcidius is over-stressed: omni cultu convenustata, cp. pulchritudinis ac venustatis (378, 2). For effectu opificis, cp. deus, qui primitus operatur ac facit (343, 25), opifex igitur silvae . . . (338, 15) etc. 2) If matter is incorporeal, it is intelligible; matter is not in-telligible; matter is not incorporeal. - As a confirmation Calcidius repeats the seventh argument of the preceding section. How he can speak of both a silva intelligibilis and a silva corporea has been explained (p. 43). The question how 'not intelligible' matter can nevertheless be known will be answered in par. 345 ss. Calcidius concludes his series of arguments by stating his thesis once more. As has been observed, a few parallel texts are found in some Middle-Platonic authors, but none of them defends the interesting doctrine of 'what is potentially incorporeal'. After Calcidius this was done by Simplicius (In Phys. 229, II ss.) who in other details too shows a great similarity with the present section. Among other"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 319-320 171 things, Simplicius proves that matter is not a body, saying that this theory was also held by Plotinus. He fully elaborates this thesis and, like Calcidius, concludes again and again: so matter is not a body. He continues: ~ UA1J 1twc; &.v &L1J 8 u v oc μ e L & a w μ oc -T O V; ocvocyx1j 8e: -roiho, &Lm.p XOCL ocawμocTC,)V d8wv EGTL ~ UA1j imo-8exTLX~. et 8e ocawμoc-roc; ouaoc 8uvocμeL Mye-rocL, ta-rfov 1>-rL XIXL TO ocaw-' r t 11l I J'\\'\\J t ) / -/ μoc-rov oux we; wpLaFV1J TLc; <pUaLc;, IXIV\\ we; OC7t'O<jlOCGLc; TOU awμoc-roc; ).eye-rocL. By these last words Simplicius also tries to explain ocaw-μoc-roc;, which is not done by Calcidius. However, the striking similarity between the speculations of Calcidius and those of Sim-plicius naturally suggests that both authors were dealing with some locus communis from the Peripatetic School. Although this does not necessarily mean that Calcidius borrowed from an Aristotelian, the possibility should not be dismissed a priori, since elsewhere Calcidius derived so much from Adrastus. (His Aristotelian passages are collected by Borghorst, o.c., p. 33 ss.) On the other hand, he may just as well have found this Aristotelian passage in a Platonic author (cp. p. 144). With this Calcidius' own treatise on matter has come to its end. In many places his arguments show an undeniably Aristotelian character. Like many other Middle Platonists, he owes his dialectical material to the Peripatos. With many other Platonists he regarded Aristotle's works as a both adequate and complete commentary on the works of his great teacher and predecessor. Obviously many ideas of master and pupil were muddled up.-Calcidius was a fierce opponent to the Stoa; the climax of his opposition is in par. 319.-The similarity between Calcidius and Plotinus is consequent upon the fact that both studied the same subjects; a dependence of Calcidius on Plotinus is out of the question. Calcidius' philosophy reflects a stage of Platonic thinking prior to the Enneades. His standpoint in the question whether matter is patibilis is typical of this stage; it holds the middle path between two opinions.-Numenius was Calcidius' principal source. He set himself to attack the Stoa violently. The Aristotelian features are typical of Middle Platonism in general; and Calcidius may well have borrowed these from Numenius. Still, an influence of Albinus must be taken into account. Calcidius' wavering as to the questions whether matter is passive and divisible has a remarkable parallel in Numenius' attitude towards the question whether the soul is tridimensional. By themselves matter is neither passive nor divisible, the soul not"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"172 THE TREATISE ON MATTER tridimensional. But they can be said to be so because of what comes to them. 3. VERIFYING PARAPHRASE What follows is a continuous commentary on the remaining text of the Timaeus. It was written evidently as a confirmation to the theories proposed earlier. Hence the references to the previous paragraphs must necessarily be numerous. Since the development of the subject-matter is bound to the Timaeus, it is less systematic than the previous part. A certain main division can, however, be drawn up in this way: a) discussion of the charac-teristics of matter; it is oc) without quality, ~) without motion; b) the reason why matter lacks quality; c) the origin of the charac-teristics, i.e., the species; d) matter in itself; e) matter with reference to Providence.-In between occasional passages do not fit into this scheme; they are to be regarded as digressions inspired by Plato's text. a) Characteristics of matter oc) Matter without form and quality [321] Since our penetrating dissertation has exhausted what we intended to discuss in accordance with the authoritative doctrine of Plato, a return must now be made to the comment-ary of the text of his dialogue. Now Plato says: \"How are we to consider its power and its nature?\" By 'power' he understands the ability to assume a certain outward appearance, for matter possesses outward appearance, changing qualities and quantities, not actually but potentially, as is clear from their unstable and mutual change into one another. By 'nature' he means its essence, and rightly he speaks of 'considering', for it is impossible to judge about the real essence of matter with some insight acquired by either the senses or the intellect. It is as a vision in a dream: the more we want to grasp the vision, the sooner it slips away. \"In my opinion\", Plato says, \"matter is, like a nurse, the recip-ient of all that comes into existence\". All that comes into existence must necessarily exist from a definite point in time: therefore, mortal things are likenesses and images of the immortal and really existing things, but they obtain their existence and"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 321 173 reveal themselves in matter, thus producing in us the idea of matter. Plato calls matter their 'recipient', because the forms do not come forth from the womb of matter, as the Stoics think, but rather come to it from outside, like an impression in wax. And he calls it 'nurse', because it carries on its own shoulders, as it were, the offspring of another, for it offers them only support. IUXTA PLATONIC! DOGMATIS AUCTORITATEM In par. 119, also the transition to a new part, Calcidius writes: Mundi totius perfec-tionem . . . praeteriti operis textu secrevimus Platonicis dogmatibus inhaerentes. See the comment on auditores Platonis (336, 10). ORATIONIS Cp. 346, 1; see also Galen, Compendium, p. 34, 17 (Ed. K. and W.) ; Calcidius returns to the dialogue at the point where he left it in par. 273. AIT ERGO Calcidius evidently follows the version -rlv' oov lzov Mvoq.1.Lv x oc t qi u a L v ocu-ro u1tOA7J1t-reov; in the Bude-edition: XIXTIX <j)U<1LV (49A). VIM NUNC ADPELLAT In par. 310 Calcidius spoke about a twofold possibilitas, his trans-lation of the Aristotelian term Mvocμu;; now he explains the same calling it vis. It is, in his opinion, the aptitude to adopt all forms, and, therefore, the passive possibility (non effectit sed possibilitate). For the term opportunitas, cp. 309, 17: opportunitatem suscipiendi ordinis; and the comment (p. 63); especially 376, 14: potentiam opportunitatemque formarum recipiendarum, where opportunitas and potentia are equivalent. Alongside these terms, also one finds capa-citate (356, 15). Calcidius does his best to minimize the active character of the term vis. The same tendency is seen in his inter-pretation of cupiditas (silvae): cupiditatem vero negat esse talem, qualis est animalium. Sed ut, cum quid coeptum atque inchoatum est, dicitur perfectionem desiderare, sic, opinor, etiam silva speciem cupit (319, 1-4). Meanwhile, these texts show how difficult it is to main-tain consistently the concept of pure potentiality. VULTUS Cp. 355, 18-19; 363, 4.

For the different meanings of this term see the comment to par. 344 (p. 221). RECTEQUE ETIAM PUTANDUM Calcidius"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"174 THE TREATISE ON MATTER clearly wishes to say: \"Matter cannot be grasped distinctly by either the senses or the intellect\" (cp. 346, 9-n; 359, 7 ss.; 371, 1-2). This is discussed extensivily in par. 345 ss. The verb praesumere is used repeatedly; 315, 12: praesumpta eorum existentia; 330, 20: quae inrationabili opinione praesumimtur; also see 370, 19. The cor-responding noun praesumptio also occurs; 305, 7: obscura quadam ... praesumptione; 340, IO-II: non ... abhorrens a ratione vel inconveniens praesumptio; also 378, 9. The verb praesumere with its fairly wide meaning should here be translated by 'to grasp', 'to acquire the knowledge of'. This knowledge may be of a different character: vel ex sensu cognita vel ex ratione intellecta. The Greek equivalent 1tpOA'1jlji~c; is already mentioned (p. 49). QUIPPE UT SOMNIUM In Tim. 52B Plato compares the concept of the x.C:>pa. with a vision seen in a dream. Although the comparison differs, this passage in Plato suggested the comparison to Calcidius.

But opinor must be taken as a rendering of ToLixv8e μixALO\"Ta.. OMNIA QUAE GIGNUNTUR As above, Calcidius explains ipsa verba Platonis. Wrobel apparently failed to see that the words omnia quae gignuntur are a quotation. They give Calcidius the opportunity for remarking on the temporal limitation of things. \"Everything that comes into existence necessarily exists from a definite point in time, hence these things are mortal 1) and images of the immortal things possessing the real existence. These images acquire an existence of their own in matter, and thus produce in us the idea of matter\". This approach to matter is considerably more Platonic than usual in Calcidius. The idea of the eternal image prevails. The represent-ation needs something in which it is represented (as a projected image is seen upon the screen). So far matter was traced by analysis of change, and even though finally the Platonic idea of 'space' crops up for a moment, the approach was quite Aristotelian. SIMULACRA ET IMAGINES In 299, IO divine Providence makes the world ad exemplum et simititudinem intellegibilis mundi. Here a divine Maker is not mentioned. ACCIPIUNT AUTEM SUBSTANTIAM This assertion admits a twofold interpretation: 1) the images receive a substratum (l'.moxelμevov) or 2) they receive their existence, 1) Sunt ergo mortalia may be either a scribal error (a kind of homoiote-leuton) or one of Calcidius' many contractions for sunt ergo mortalia; et mortalia sunt ..."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 322 175 their being in matter. These concepts are not far apart, but never-theless different. In par. 307 it was said of the principles: omnia ex isdem substantiam mutuari (336, 1).

For the different meanings of sitbstantia see ad par. 344 (p. 221). QUIA NON EX GREMIO The stress is on ex.

[322] Then Plato continues: \"And what is said of it is indeed true, but, as it seems, has to be said more distinctly\", for what is said in accordance with truth is not, for that reason, automatic-ally said distinctly and dearly. There are indeed many correct but obscure expositions. Now obscurity may rise from the purpose of the speaker, as will happen occasionally, from a deficiency in the hearer or from the nature of the matter under discussion. It is due to the author, when he intentionally disguises his sub-ject, as Heraclitus and Aristotle did, or when his treatment of the subject is defective. It is due to the hearer, when either unheard of and unusual things are said or the listener is too slow-witted. And, finally, it is due to the subject itself, when it is such as that which we are discussing now, viz., when it is of such a nature that it can be perceived by neither the sense5 nor the mind, since it is without any form, quality and limit. But Timaeus, who speaks here, is not an incompetent speaker, nor are his listeners slow of mind; so there only remains the possibility that the subject itself is difficult and obscure. In fact there exists nothing more difficult to explain than matter, and thus it is why everything said about its nature, although said in full agreement with truth, is not expressed clearly and distinctly. Finally, Plato mentions the cause of this difficulty when saying: \"It is, however, so much more perplexing, because the mind's eye necessarily becomes confused in advance and uncertain of both fire and the other materials, wondering why water is better called and thought water than"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER earth, since there is no certain and stable quality in the bodies denoting the nature proper to everything\".

NASCITUR QUIPPE Calcidius takes the opportunity to make a digression on obscurity. Many such digressions are found in this part of his book, giving the impression that he wishes to elaborate this part and to add new material. Obscurity, he says, may arise from three sources. First from the author; here again there are two possibilities, in-tentional obscurity and obscurity resulting from incapacity. He gives two instances of intentional obscurity: Heraclitus and Aristotle. It is a well-known fact that in Antiquity Heraclitus was considered to be obscure (cp. Dberweg-Prachter, Die Geschichte der Philoso-phie I, Berlin, 192612, p. 55). The mention of Aristotle in this con-nexion, as Fabricius notes, goes back, without doubt, to the story told by Aulus Gellius in Noctes Atticae XX 5. Alexander wrote the following letter to Aristotle: \"Yon were wrong to publish your cxxpoocwcot Myot; for now there is no longer any difference between those who were your pupils and those who were not\". Aristotle is said to have replied that his lectures were both published and un-published, since they could be understood only by those who had been his hearers; hence the opinion that A~stotle purposely ex-pressed himself obscurely. Galen, Compendium lb (p. 34, Kr. and W.) speaks about the constricto et obscuro sermone Aristotelis. Fabricius quotes some texts of Cicero showing some similarity with Calcidius' text. In De fin. II 5 Cicero states, that there are two occasions when one is allowed to speak and be misunderstood: si aut de industria facias, ut Heraclitus, cognomento qui crxoTe:tv6i; perhibetur, quia de natura nimis obscure memoravit; aut quum rerum obscuritas, non verbomm, facit ut non intellegatitr oratio, qualis est in Timaeo Platonis (cp. Acad. Prior. II 3). On the matter of obscurity, Plato's Timaeus seems to have been as famous as Hera-clitus. At the beginning of his commentary Calcidius noticed that obscurity was not a question of imbecillitas sermon.is but arose out of the subject (69, 13-14). The other two sources of obscurity are easily understood without comment.

From this reference it is evident that, with his resolutio of undeniably Aristotelian character (cp. p. 131), Calcidius imagines that he stands firmly on Platonic ground. [323] \"To begin with water, which\", Plato says, \"we ment-ioned just now: when it congeals to ice, it appears to us at least as a stone and a body with the solidity of earth and not fluid at all\". Accurately and carefully he says 'appears', for water, when it congeals and becomes earth, does not persevere in its own nature-for water is wet,-but its substratum, matter, assumes an opposed nature, dryness, and becomes earth by change, and because its appearance suddenly changes and its state becomes different, it 'appears' as something which it was not before. However, Plato speaks of water congealing to stone <and not to earth>, because in icy and cold regions water, which has long been solid, does change into stone: it is called crystal by the Alpine tribes in the Raetian mountains.

It is prob-ably more correct to say that it translates w~ ooxouμ.e:v ... opwμe:v; in Plato's text w~ ooxouμe:v is, of course, to be connected with 7t1)yvuμ.e:vov; Calcidius apparently has not seen this. minimeque fusile is a typical Calcidian elaboration. ACRITER ET NIMIUM VIGILANTER Upon the doubtful interpretation of apparet Calcidius bases a reflection intended to confirm his theory on matter. The explanation of apparet is curious. One expects the reason for this verb immediate-ly after quippe, in the first part of the period. But, in fact, this part gives something which is not the reason. This, actually follows later on in the second part. Consequently, quippe refers to this. The second part, however, begins with sed quod, which quod must be a causal conjunction, in the text handed down. The difficulty would vanish if quod was not a conjunction but a relative pronoun. And Calcidius apparently meant this. The immediately following ea quae must be a marginal gloss, come into the text, because someone either wished to warn the reader that quod should not be read as a conjunction but as referring to matter (quod subiacet), or wrongly read it as a conjunction, thus missing a subject for subiacet. Once ea quae is removed, quod subiacet obtains the same function as aqua in the first part of the period. Calcidius' words may then be para-phrased as follows: Plato accurately says 'has the appearance of', for in the process of change, on the one hand, water becomes earth, and thereby disappears; but the matter underlying it remains and can be said 'to have the appearance of' another element. NON IN SUA NATURA PERSEVERANS This in opposition to matter, which is always in propria natura perseverans (337, 17, cp. p. 150).

Calcidius believes Plato to be speaking of a well-known phenomenon whereby water appears to change into stone.

XVI 13-while in Silvae I 2, 126 Statius statts raraque longaevis nivibus crystalla gelari. Aulus Gellius says that in one of Aristotle's works there is: solidius latiusquc concretam esse eam (sc. aquam), quam Graeci xpua'rlXAAov adpellant (Noct. Att., XIX 5, 5).

Calcidius, however, disagrees: he states that it is called chrystal by the Alpine tribes in the Raetian mountains. The Alps are mentioned in this connection by Pliny and Isidore but not the Raetian mountains. These differences indicate another source, where Calcidius may also have found the second phenome-non, viz., 1.he petrifying of boiling steam in Tripolis. Similar phenom-ena are also mentioned by Pliny (XXXI 2, 20), but he describes them quite differently. quae supposes an antecPdent aqua. The concept aqua dominates the entire passage, for there is question of water changing into stone. missa in formulas may he an indi-cation of some kind of industry. DICTURUS ERIT Calcidius probably refers to the text of Plato which he discusses more fully m par. 325. [324] Plato continues his discussion, and having said that water changed and became earth, he now states that finally \"this same water, when evaporated to smoke, mixes with the rarity of air, and that air, in its tum, bums and changes into fire\". Next he shows that the corning into exist.en cc of the ele-ments and their change from one into another is performed in a cycle in which \"fire gives up its own subtlety and assumes the conditions of air. This, again, first condenses and accumulates in mists and clouds, and then, after the mass (of the cloud) has been desolved and become liquid, flows away in rains. From water again come solidity and stones\". Thus according to this cycle earth, too, appears to change into other elements; for, if earth alone does not change, eventually"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"180 THE TREATISE ON MATTER everything will become earth, since all other things will change into it, and earth itself will not change into anything else. But because proof is provided by visual observation, and earth has never been seen to change into water or any other element, Plato abstained and shrank from the assertion that earth changes, lest he would seem to come into conflict with the senses.

Calcidius' wording of this paragraph is quite different from that of the 'official' translation (61, 5 ss.), but both are a correct rendering of Plato's thought. GYRIS ET ANFRACTIBUS In the commentary this typically Calcidian combination is frequently found: 123, 16; 170, 22. These terms belong especially to astronomy: cp. 170, 22; 128, 18; 132, 17; 167, 25-26; 180, 19; 182, 9-10; 187, 9, 18; 207, 5; 273, 13. In his translation Calcidius appears to suggest a complete circular course between the elements; hence he concludes: igitur secundum hanc orbitam rationemque circuitus (again a doublet). He was bound to give this point much attention, for no one reading Plato's text carefully could fail to see that the cycle was incomplete. \"But\", Calcidius says, \"this does not mean that Plato did not assume a complete cycle: in the present passage he only wished to avoid a conflict with our common experience, which does not know a change of earth into something else. That the cycle must be complete is evident from the fact, that otherwise everything would finally become earth\". Once again Calcidius explains Plato's doctrine in an Aristotelian sense, so much so that he even contradicts Plato, for from Tim. 54B-D it is clear that, for the latter, earth cannot change, because the geometrical figure of the element of earth cannot change into the figure of other elements (cp. Galen, Compendium Xb: Deinde postea tria (horum) elementoritm inter se commutari exposuit, terram au.tem in statu suo firmam et inmutatam perseverare (Ed. Kr. and W., p. 60).

The argument given by Calcidius may also be found in De gen. et corr. 332 b 5 ss., where Aristotle states that there cannot be a cxpx.~ among the elements, because in the end everything would be either fire or earth, etc. Aristotle also appeals to experience to support his thesis; ib., 331 a 7-9: 'End 8e: 8twptcnlXL 1tp6npov, O't'L 't'O'i:t; &nAo'i:t; O'WfJ.IXO'L e; <XAA~AWV ~ yev&O'Lt;, IXfJ.IX 8e: XIXL XIX't'IX \"t'l)V ixta6l)O'LV q>IXLV&'t'IXL yiyv6μ&Vl); ib., 331 b 24-25: oμo).oyouμ.&VlJ 8e: XIXL -tji ix£a6~a&L ~ 't'OU nupot; \"(£V&O'Lt;. Calcidius, on the other hand, states that, appealing to the same experience, Plato rejected the complete cycle. But as has been noted, he did so because of the geometrical figure of earth. [325] Plato, however, goes deeper into this mutual change of the elements, saying: \"And if the materials thus lend to each other, in some kind of cycle, the kindling forces of generation and do not persevere in the same form, how can a certain idea of them be formed, free of all doubt? Surely none\". Just so; for let us image that this fire (i.e., of our sensible world) is pure fire unmixed with another element, as Heraclitus thinks, or pure water, as Thales believes, or pure air, as Anaximenes presumes; \"if\", he says, \"we take these things to be always the same and immutable, we shall get muddled in many inextricable errors\". Hence one ought not to agree easily with regard to such natures, nor at once take for certain, what seems to be no more than a probability. So what can guard us from error? The following argument can: that there is essence and also quality, and that these two are different. Essence is the substance of a thing, quality that which comes to and appears in things, having a substance. When now we observe, as always whenever we look closely into that part of nature (viz., the elements), and see that a part of it departs from itself and changes into another material, e.g., fire, we shall not denote this material, as something stable and unchanging, with a definite pronoun, such as 'this' or 'that' -for these pronouns denote an essence-but, in denoting them, we shall use rather that pronoun proper to quality, not 'this' but 'such', not 'that' but 'of this or that nature'. For with fire the change undergone is not loss of essence but of quality. When fire becomes air, it changes into a different or opposite material, for it is certain that the essence in itself has nothing opposed to"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER itself: rather opposite things are turning round the same essence. Thus the change and variation affect not the essence but the quality, in which both variety and opposition are found. It is the same with the other elements; none has an essence of its own, and we always use the demonstrative pronouns referring to essence rather than those relating to quality by sheer force of habit. These four bodies are in a perpetual and ceaseless flux; they change by variation before they are given a name, like a mountain stream driven on by some irresistible force. SUMPSIT TAMEN At the end of par. 323 Calcidius remarks that Plato has yet to enter into the details of this question. These are now discussed. His actual words are: \"He has, however, taken in hand something else in order to . . . .. . DE MUTUA ELEMENTORUM EX ALIO IN ALIUD CONVERSIONE Cp. 346, 23-24: Initium quaes-tionis adripit ex reciproca de alio in aliud elementorum conversione, which refers to those passages where he discusses the way leading to knowledge and in so doing assumes that this way was already indicated by Plato in the present passage. AIT ENIM Tim. 49C: XUXAOV TE: OU't\"Cu OLCXOLOOVTCX de; tDJ..yfA.cx, we; <potLVE:TG<L, Tl)V yeve:ow. Calcidius' translation is fairly accurate: xutlov = circuitu; -r~v yevunv is-in a way typical of Calcidius-rendered by vires fomentaque genera-tionis. Mutuari may be taken as a translation of otcxotoov-rcx, though, properly speaking, it means 'to borrow from'. Here, however, this is impossible because of the words invicem sibi. By vires fomentaque generationis Calcidius must intend matter, for the elements, in a way, pass this on to each other. Vires recalls 344, 24, where vis is the equivalent of possibilitas or potentia. When in par. 353 (376, 16-19) it is said that there are many possibilities in matter, the explanation of the plural vires is therefore given. For fomentum one may think of fomes (341, 1), which has also become a plural under the influence of vires. The rest of the translation is a somewhat free adaptation. Plato says: Ou-reu o~ -rou-reuv ouoe1to-re: -rwv cxu-rwv £XCX(JT(.o)V <potVTCX~oμbeuv, 1toiov CXUTWV we; av OTLOUV TOUTO xcxt oux lf>J...o 1tcxy(wc; ouaxupt~6μ.e:voc; oux cxtaxuve:hcx( -rte; ecxu-rov; oux fo-rtv. Calcidius does not, like Plato, combine the first part (xuxi.ov -re: ..• yeve:aw) with what precedes but with what follows. MERITO. FINGAMUS ENIM These words of Calcidius are only an elaboration of the quotation from Plato just given. \"Who will not feel ashamed when he asserts that anything whatsoever is such and nothing else"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 325 and when he sees, at the same time, that it has been changed into something else?\" So Plato says that of the things perceived by us not one is properly speaking permanent and always the same. Calcidius amplifies this idea thus: \"Let us assume that this our fire (i.e., perceptible by our senses) is really something permanent, (he actually says: \"that this our fire is pure and without mixture of any element\"), as Heraclitus says, or water, as Thales, or air, as Anaximenes says, how can we then avoid getting entangled in numerous inextricable problems. For then we should assume that this our fire, etc., is always the same and invariable\". In this case fire, water and air, as we know them, would have the properties which are characteristic of the ideas. Evidently Calcidius is thinking of the ideas here, hence the words: sincerum et sine ullius materiae permixtione. The ideal fire, etc., is pure (I gnis ... purus et ceterae sincerae intellegibilesque substantiae (302, 20-21)), whereas the four materiae, i.e., the four elements as we know them, are not pure but blended; they are called fire, etc., after the element which predomi-nates in the mixture: quattuor ... materias ... , quae concretione mutua ex maioris atque obtinentis materiae vocabulo cognominatae sunt (302, 4-6). This last text also shows that materia in Calcidius means 'element' (cp. p. 42). This is also clear from in aliam materi-am and in diversam contrariamve materiam in this same paragraph (348, 30; 349, 8). Needless to say that the rendering of Heraclitus' teaching: esse hunc ignem sincerum et sine ullius materiae permixtione is an anachronism. QUID EST Calcidius gives the solution In so doing he anticipates Plato's text he translates in par. 326. For the use of the pronouns this section is, therefore, referred to. QUO-NIAM EST ESSENTIA The theory formulated by Calcidius is once more that of the real difference between essence and quality. As previously (par. 308, 3n, 321) he is attacking the Stoics. The identity of essentia with substantia has already been mentioned ad par. 321 (p. 173).

ET NOS"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER PRAESUMIMUS \"In discussing these things the idiom is incorrect, for demonstrative pronouns are used without further reflection\". This 'use without further reflection' is the rendering of praesumere, so the meaning of this verb here is quite different from that found in most other places (see ad 345, 5, p. 174), but it has a parallel in ut libet exagitata praesumptio (327, 2). SEMPER ENIM Finally, Calcidius compares the constant change of the elements with an ever flowing river. This comparison was undoubtedly inspired by Plato, for in his description of the union of soul and body the latter says about the 1te:plooot of the soul: At o' e:tc; 7tOTocμov evoe:Oe:fooct 7t0AUV o(h' expcxTouv ouT' expocTouvTo (Tim. 43A).

Circuitus is also used by Calcidius in 348, 13; also see torrens in 349, 19; fluunt 349, 17; certa et stabili reminds one of certa et stabilis in 346, 21, cp. 348, 16; see also par. 353).

(326] \"Hence\", he says, \"this fire, which, as it were exuding, dissolves into the airstream, since it is unstable and variable, and has no constant nature, should be regarded not as fire but as something fiery, nor should water, which through evaporation turns into air, be called a liquid but something wet, and so on\". And he continues: \"But that in which all these things seem to originate and finally to be dissolved and in which, by destruction, they change into different forms, viz., matter, this alone can be denoted by a definite pronoun, and of this alone 'this' or 'that' can correctly be said\". Indeed, this alone can always be denoted with a definite name, since, without quality or form, it does not undergo any change into opposed qualities or other forms, and always remains the same. In order to dispel any possible shades of doubt, he uses a clear and distinct example. He pictures \"an artisan fashioning without interruption shapes from the very same gold\", now a pyramid, and suddenly from that an octahe-dron, then, quicker than thought, an icosahedron, a cube, triangles, quadrangles, a hemicycle and a cycle. \"If then someone should pick out a certain figure and ask what it is, then\", so he"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 326 states, \"the answer should be, 'gold', because, if the answer is, 'a pyramid', this figure would immediately and by the answer itself change into something else, and the person who gave the answer lie\". In the same way, it is not said of fire which has the shape of a pyramid that it is fire, but that it is either a fiery part of matter or a fiery quality; similarly of air not that it is an octahedron but 'vaporous' matter, and water and earth not an icosahedron and a cube, but, for the former, liquid, and for the latter, earthly solidity of matter.

He adds more figures, beginning with the triangles, evidently because Plato says: -ro oe -rp(ywvov 6aoc -re: ft.Moc ax,~μ.oc-roc. At the end of the quotation he applies this text to the problem under discussion: a piece of gold, which at a given moment looks like a pyramid, is not designated a pyramid, but gold (in the shape ot a pyramid). Thus one should not speak of fire, but of a fiery ( = pyramidoid) form of matter or of a fiery quality (of matter); the correct formulation would have been 'matter in fiery quality'. Nor should one speak of an octahedron but of a 'breathlike (spirabilis = octahedral) matter', and further, of the 'liquid and earthly solidity of matter' (terrenae soliditatis corpus). Calcidius might also have said simply umecta et terrena silva (cp. 374, 14-15, p. 233; umectatam modo, modo ignitam), but soliditas denotes the special character of water and earth as opposed to that of air and fire, viz., solidity. [327] And now one should not think that what Plato here discusses is merely a choice of appropriate terms. On the con-trary, he does his best to accustom us, through our acuteness of mind, to the practice of detaching pure matter, covered up by a variety of materials, from the confusion of those bodies. For he states: \"Exactly the same condition, hard to explain, occurs in the nature which assumes all the forms of the materials, for it does not in the least depart from its own condition; indeed it receives all things, without appropriating a single form from them\". The bodies, therefore, are shaped, but matter is shapeless. \"And\", he says, \"although what is accepted within its womb is formed\" -in keeping with what was said above: 'what is accepted', for this was called 'receptacle' of all bodies-, it itself remains without fom1 and is used as a soft, plastic material, in which various imprints are made\". It is evident that there are certain soft materials which, yielding to the impressions of different seals, take up and retain the imprints a long time, as when someone stamps wax, lead or silver all over. Like matter, the wax itself will be without form but have innumerable forms arising not out of itself but from elsewhere. With good reason, therefore, and rightly the nature of a soft and plastic material is compared to corporeal matter stamped all over with the forms of bodies."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 327 187 SOLLERTIA MENTIS DISTINGUERE Again the resolutio is meant.

In this text Calcidius found the correct description of Plato's concept of matter. He referred to it already in the first section of this treatise and returned to it again and again (see the comment on par. 268, p. 32). CUMQUE INTRA GREMIUM The words eadem ... trahit, which, except for the parenthetic clause, also occur in the translation proper, are a rendering of the words hμocyei:ov ycxp cpucreL 1tocv-rt xe'i:-rocL (Tim. 50C); the first name of matter was also derived from it in par. 308 (336, 15-18, p. 146): ex natura qui-dem propria primam materiam nuncupans et item simile quiddam moll is cedentisque materiae, in quam inprimuntur signacula (cp. 353, 14-15, p. 190; 354, 4, p. 191). Another name mentioned was receptaculum; Calcidius draws attention to this in his translation quae recipiuntur, see par. 321 (345, 13), and the comment on p. 175). The term usus, too, asks for comment (351, 16 and 23). One would expect Calcidius merely to !,tate: \"matter is like a soft material\"; instead he says: \"the usus silvae is similar to a soft material\". One might be inclined to translate this by \"the employment of matter is the same as that of a soft material\", thus indicating God as the one who employs matter. However, a different solution is offered by the last phrase of the paragraph, where Calcidius once more says the unexpected \"a soft material is like matter\" rather than: \"Matter is like a soft material\". Now, since Calcidius states here: \"the natura of a soft material is like the usus silvae\", one is given the impression that, alongside ttsus silvae, natura silvae might have been used as well, and that, therefore, usus should to some extent be taken as the equivalent of natura. One may think of the following development of meaning: 'use', 'usefulness', 'useful nature', 'nature'. The general content of this section, namely that matter is un-changeable in itself but assumes various forms, occurs repeatedly, e.g., 342, 11-15; (compare: Ex quo perspicuum est with Per-spicuum est in 351, 18 and 345, 13-18, p. 175). See also Albinus, Epit. VIII 2, who also treats about the subsequent comparisons."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"188 THE TREATISE ON MATTER [328] Plato has also spoken of wax in the Theaetetus, when discussing the causes of the different strength of memory in men, namely the stronger and weaker memories. He said that in the minds of men there is a faculty very much like wax, which makes some people keen of comprehension and quick of learning but soon forgetful; it makes others slow of learning but of good memory, and others, again, so gifted that they are both quick to learn and slow to forget. For those in whom this wax-like faculty, which, he says, Homer called -ro 'Oji; ljiuz~i; xeixp, is more liquid and thin, learn easily but they soon lose what they have learned, since the impressions disappear because of the extreme softness of the wax. On the other hand, if the wax of the mind is rather solid, it scarcely receives the forms impressed unto it, but once this has been done, it retains those forms laboriously impressed a long time, because they are printed into a hard material. The third case is one of divine blessing, namely when the wax-like material is so compact that it neither rejects the forms nor opposes the impression of what is stamped on, and yet it does not receive them in so unstable a foundation that the impressions are vague and invisible.

Therefore, matter always remains in such a condition. The prototype, too, viz., the idea which exists of everything that has come into being, always remains true to its own nature. In the same way God, the Maker, remains eternally. But the images of the prototypes which present themselves to matter are not permanent, for they change constantly and unceasingly in a perpetual succession of dying and being born on account of the inevitable necessity of a certain nature. Hence Plato says that matter \"is set to receive the images of things\". His use of 'set' is excellent, for by nature it is motionless but moved by the coming and going of the species which enter and confer a form upon it; and in its turn it moves these species, as Plato will show further on. Although, therefore, it is always the same and unchangeable, he rightly states: \"yet, because of the coming together of multiform species, it seems to assume various forms. But the species which present themselves to matter, dissolve and perish in it, are images of the eternal and immortal species\"-viz., of those which we call ideas-\"and they are formed by them in some wonderful way\", namely after the image of the exemplar mentioned. \"In a wonderful way\", because it is difficult and inexplicable to imagine how a true image is formed from the pure ideas in things which come into being, whether this happens as with the imprints in soft materials, as we discussed previously, or as when the outlines are conveyed from an example to suitable materials, as is done in painting and sculpture. NUNC QUONIAM Calcidius indicates the division now being used, for the fact that matter lacks both form and quality has indeed been the subject from par. 321 onwards. INMOBILEM QUOQUE In par. 301 inmobilis was translated by 'without motion'. In the context it was the most obvious translation, and there was room indeed for the assumption that the Greek original had cx.x(vYjTO<:;. However, the translation 'immovable' is also in accordance with the theory of Calcidius, even though a little further on he says (silva) movetur (353, 17). For with motion it is the same as with all affections of matter: by itself it is not open to them, but motions and changes do occur in it, and in so far he can say: silva movetur, silva mutatur, variatur (299, 20). Nevertheless, when Calcidius puts silva mutatur"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"190 THE TREATISE ON MATTER alongside silva inmutabilis est, silva movetur alongside silva inmobilis est, and, what actually includes everything, silva patibilis est alongside silva inpetibilis est, one wonders whether all these are only seeming contradictions. The answer must be in the negative: it seems that what here comes to light is Calcidius' incongruous presentation of matter, which he found in Aristotle. In connexion with Tim. 50C, xwouμEV6v n xoct aLotcrX1)μotn~6-μe:vov IJ7t0 TW'I e:lcn6v-rwv, q>otLVE:'t\"IXL ae: aL' EXE:LVIX IXAAO't\"E: <XAAOLOV, Calcidius poses the question whether matter has motion. In the course of the translation he observes that with motion it is the same as with forms: matter, having nothing of itself, does not have motion either; it \"remains unmoved by itself\". He now goes further into the meaning of this 'remaining'. MANET ERGO Matter remains. Calcidius has been hammering on this point from the first section (299, 18). As for the other principles, they also remain: Archetyp1tm manet, deus opifex manet. So the three principles (par. 304, 307) are of a permanent nature. The source of change then lies in the images of the prototypes: for they are incessantly coming and going. The reason given, ob inexcusabilem natiirae cuiusdam necessitatem. This is the only explanation Calcidius can give. Probably he is thinking of the Platonic concept of avocyx1) (cp. 299, 14 and 301, 18). With naturae cuiusdam he seems to introduce a fourth principle, about which nothing further is hear<l (cp. J54, 19 and 23; also see ad par. 352, p. 193 and 237). The method of expression here is well-known: IN TALi FORTUNA ET CONDICIONE the Calcidian doub-let. ARCHETYPUM Cp. 303, 3.

IUXTA MEMORATI VIDELICET EXEMPLI CONSIGNATIONEM; these words are a reminder that the images resemble the exemplars 'referred to' (cp. memoratae species, 354, 25). MIRO AUTEM Mono Calcidius explains the words miro modo by stating that it is virtually impossible to imagine how these images come into being. He mentions two possibilities of presenting these things. The first (the imprint in a soft material) is clearly derived from Plato's text; the second refers to a painter or sculptor, imitating or copying an example, who conveys the outlines of this example to his material, a canvas or a stone. Calcidius may have been thinking of Plato's Demiurge, who creates the world looking at the ideas (Tim. 29A). This passage is in 333, 5 ss.; 336, 3-4, and particularly in par. 338; also cp. 300, 13-14. As for the mode of expression, it should be noted that difficile est mente concipere may be used but not inexplicabile est mente concipere. In the trans-lation I have, therefore, taken inexplicabile separately. It seems that Calcidius has fallen victim to his predilection for doublets. SICUT SUPRA DICTUM EST refers to 351, 15-17 and also to 353, 14-15. [330] Therefore, Plato defers the treatment of this subject for the moment, in order to take it up in due course, and he enlightens the mind by representing the matter in such a way that three kinds [genera] are .;een.-He now takes 'kinds' in a figurative sense usir.g it to denote first substances, for neither matter nor the example are kinds. \"They are\", he says, \"first that which comes into existence and originates\" -viz., the generated species which originates in matter and dissolves in it-\"secondly that in which it originates\" -this 'in which' is matter itself, for fleeting species acquire their being in this-\"and, thirdly, that to which originating things owe their likeness\", viz., the idea which is the exemplar of all things produced by nature, namely those things which are enclosed by matter as in a womb and which are said to be the images of the exemplars. Next he clarifies the problem by a manifest example, for he compares that which receives the species to a 'mother', matter of course--for matter receives the spedes offered by nature; that from which the image is derived to a 'father', namely the idea-for the species mentioned owe their likeness to the idea; and"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER that which originates from these two to a 'child', viz., the generated species-for this stands between the really existing nature which is constant and always the same, £.e., the idea, the eternal in-tellect of the eternal God, and that.nature which indeed is but not always the same, viz., matter; for matter by itself is not among the things that are, because it is eternal. Therefore, that which stands between these two natures is not really existing. Since it is the image of what really exists, it seems to exist to some extent; but since it is not permanent and undergoes change, it does not exist in reality, as the exemplars do; for these indeed enjoy true and unchangeable existence. Hence there are the three following realities: that which always is, that which always is not and that which is not always. It is not sur-prising, that one example is found to differ in some respect from the other, because a comparison is made on account of a likeness, and likeness is a combination of similarity and dissimilarity. Therefore, if in such matter one finds a similarity, be it only a superficial one, one ought to grasp it for the sake of the clarifi-cation of the intellect. QUARE DIFFERT In the previous paragraph the problem of the relation between the ideas and their images came up for a moment; from this it is clear that, according to Calcidius, the problem is a particularly difficult one. \"It is for this reason\", he now states, \"that Plato momentarily puts this question off in order to return to it in due time (51C, par. 337); presently he restricts himself to giving a preliminary survey and elucidating comparison\".

't'pL't\"t'CX (50C). Calcidius promptly remarks that genera should not be taken in a technical sense here and adds this explanation: \"matter and example are not genera\". About the third principle, viz., God, he has already said: neque genus est neque ulli subiacet generi (343, 26). Genera should be taken here in the sense of 'first substances'.

Calcidius has already spoken of inexcusabilis naturae cuiusdam necessitas and will speak of a natura proditas species. As observed already (p. 190), he stealthily introduces a fourth principle; this introduction is in itself a proof of the impossibility to explain the changes of things by means of the 'official' three principles, each of which is said to remain (manet).

EI INTER EAM NATURAM Calcidius asserts the very opposite of what he had said earlier: cum eadem sit semper. Besides, in 355, 9 he will say of matter that it is that quad semper non est, which again contradicts quae quidem est in the present text. Yet, probably these statements were not regarded as contradictory, because Cakidius himself believed to be justified in qualifying mattP.r as both patibilis and inpetibilis. As he haci said silva variatur, mavetur (par. 329), he here Philosophia Antiqua, VIII 13"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"THE TREATISE ON MATTER says: quae est qu,idem, sed non eadem semper; on the other hand, the phrase cum eadem sit semper is in keeping with quae cum a propria natura non recedat. The two statements can be combined in the assertion that matter is always the same, but that its 'being' is a potential one, and that, in so far, it is right to say: quod semper non est. For matter always remains what it is (semper non est), but, on account of the addition of qualities 'from without', it may also be said that it is (quae est quidem). Doubts have already been expressed concerning the question whether Calcidius' opinion contains a seeming rather than a real contradiction (cp. p. 190). QUIPPE HAEC ... ' CUM SIT AETERNA He explains the preceding words thus: \"of itself matter is nothing of all that is seen in it and which actually exists and which, therefore, gives it an ever changing appearance (non eadem semper), because it is eternal (quae est quidem)\". So both the context and the manuscripts compel or;e to accept the reading sit and not with the old editions sint. ERGO QUOD He speaks of the images which continually change into one another, and thus show that, unlike the exemplars, they are not really existent. ILLA QUIDEM Cp. 353, 22: aeternarum atque inmortalium spederitm simulacra. ERUNT IGITUR TRIA HAEC: QUOD SEMPER EST (i.e., ideas), ITEM QUOD SEMPER NON EST (i.e., matter), DEINDE QUOD NON SEMPER EST (i.e., images). Thus ideas and matter have semper in common. NEC VERO Referring to the comparison made by Plato about the relation father-mother-child, Calcidius notes that finally every comparison comes to a full stop but should not, however, be despised on this account. In exempla exemplis the two notions of a comparison are indicated. b) Why matter without quality [331] He next states: \"It is impossible that a single aspect, containing all forms and features, displays the appearance of the universe, everywhere so richly variegated, unless a basic, formless womb of corporeal things underlies them all, just as in pictures a first coat of neutral tint carries the light of the colours\". Plato gives the reasons why matter is necessarily without quality. When a work has to be made which in every respect lacks nothing in pure and perfect beauty, an example after which it is made should be at hand and then not only a very good, not to say excellent maker, but also a material from which that work has"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 331 195 to be made. Matter is suitable, if it is pliable and can be moulded. This will be so, if it is pure and without any quality, for if it has a quality of its own, this will be an obstacle to other quaJities, and, in particular, if various and manifold quaJities have to be impressed upon it, not only manifold qualities, but even all forms and figures. Therefore, since matter embraces all figures, all colours and all other qualities, yet none of itself, Plato rightly calls it first 'without form', then 'without any figure', and some-times 'without quality', not in the sense that it once possessed and lost them, but that it could have had them, because it is endowed with the faculty to receive lustre and adornment. Similarly, a stone which has not yet received form through the activity of an artist but can receive it is called 'formless'.

INFECTIO This term can mean 'colouring', cp. 214, 2 in/ectio vultus et coloratio, where Calcidius' liking for doublets helps the translation. Here, however, it should be taken ir. the more nominal sense of 'colour' or 'tint', although 'colourless tint' is, strictly speaking, a contradiction. Hence it is translated as 'neutraJ'. Calcidius read Plato's argument as follows: \"if the world is one imprint (una /acies), i.e., one matter formed on all sides, that matter must be formless by itself\". If there were more than one matter, this argument would not be applicable; hence the emphasis on una. NUNC PRAESTAT Calcidius might have put briefly: \"matter should be able to perform its function\", but, since he is fond of starting a discussion ab ovo, a preamble explains what is generally necessary for the accomplishment of a work of perfect beauty. The requirements are an example, a very good maker and an appropriate material (silva atque materies; the real Calcidius ! He does not say materia, since this term is too strongly associated with the meaning 'element'). Not until then does Calcidius mention what requirements matter should reach. It is noteworthy that the exemplum receives no further qualification, whereas the maker should be optimus et praestantissimus-in Plato Calcidius might have read that the example, too, should be sublime (Tim. 29A)."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"196 THE.·.

NON QUO HABUERIT One more attempt to maintain the idea of a pure potentiality. CAPACITAS Cp. above the note on opportiinitas. [332] He concludes that all that must take up forms well and aptly, should be formless and free from everything it is going to take up, i.e., it should be without figure, colour, odour and the other qualities belonging to a body. \"For\", he states, \"if the recipient is like one of the things it takes up within itself, then, if afterwards something occurs to it which is unlike those things to which it is like, then, I think, there will be a discord between its own aspect and that of the body entering, and so it will express no similarity at all\". He is trying to express this: if matter or the substance of everything is water, as with Thales, it will certainly have the qualities belonging to its nature, which never leave it; but if it, to some extent, must relinquish its own nature and become fire, it will certainly assume again the qual-ities of fire. Humidity and fire arc opposed qualities, since humid-ity and cold are proper to the one, drought and warmth to the other. Therefore, he states, these diverse and opposed things will not allow the qualities of the other to express themselves properly, because heat fights cold and drought ultimately de-stroys humidity. To quote another example, if something is white, e.g., white-lead, and must be changed into another colour, either a diverse one, such as red or yellow, or an opposed one, such as"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 332-333 197 black, then the whiteness will not allow the new colours to remain full but, by mixing itself, adulterate them.

In the next paragraph, Calcidius distinguishes between contrarium and diversum, and gives a full explanation of these terms. SILVA SIVE SUBSTANTIA In such a theory as that of Thales, mat-ter should be called 'substance', as was done by the Stoa (321, 8 ss., p. 96 s.). Elsewhere Calcidius states that it is inter nullam et aliquam substantiam (359, 4-5, p. 200); he even gives this as the translation of Plato's text. THALES Cp. 348, 19, p. 183. HAEC ERGO, INQUIT This is not a translation but a free rendering of Plato's train of thought, as frequently given by Calcidius, even in the translation proper. Pallor translates )(A<up6'r'Y)c;. [333] What is the meaning, someone may ask, of this division into diverse and opposed colours? Such things as are most distant from one another, though within the same genus, are opposed, as, for example, white and black, which belong to the one genus of colours. But within this genus these two are the most apart,-nearest to white is what is called yellow, further away red, still further dark blue, and furthest black. Thus white and black are not called diverse but opposed, because the distance between them is greatest. Thus opposed things are, in fact, greatly separated from one another, yet they are not quite alien, for their genus makes them, as it were, related to each other and this genus, as is said already, is colour. Things, however, which are called diverse are entirely distant from each other by nature, such as whiteness and sweetness, blackness and odour: the first items in each group belong to the genus 'colour', the others to the genera 'juice' and 'vapour', and, for that reason, they are perceived by different senses. Therefore, in order that matter, underlying all this, can show these aspects in their genuine and unadulterated form, it must have no quality of itself."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"198 THE TREATISE ON MATTER In this paragraph Calcidius again reveals his liking for digres-sions. His writing is far from lucid. In fact he uses two different meanings of the term 'diverse' without saying so, and probably without realizing it. He begins with the difference between 'diverse' and 'opposite' colours, discussed in par. 332. He explains what are 'opposite' colours, the implication being that the other colours are only 'diverse'. However, when he explains the term 'diverse', he asserts that 'diverse' is that which does not belong to the same genus at all. Clearly Calcidius does not realize that, if this is the only meaning of the term 'diverse', there could be no question of 'diverse colours'. Meanwhile, one can understand how Calcidius arrived at this interpretation. In the text already quoted Plato puts Tex -rijc; evocvT(occ; ( cpuae:wc;) against Tex Te: T~c; To 1tocpcx1tocv !AA'Y)c; cpuae:wc;, i.e., contraria against thir1gs which are totally dif-ferent.

INTERPOLATAS Cp. 357, 17. [334a] This same, which he asserts in general, he now intends to prove in particular with various examples: \"The makers of scented ointments do not wish that the material which they perfume has scent of its own, so that it can receive the scents unmixed and pure. Also the silversmiths, wishing to impress shapes upon shapeless silver, first smooth the surface so that the pure fonns of the figures can be printed in the soft and pliant material. In the same way\", he states, \"that which is to receive the forms of all figures should be prepared pure and without quality\"."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 334 199 Tim. 50E-51A: xoc6oc1tEp 7tEpt Ta: CXAELμμomt cm6aot EUtil8'1) Tex:rn μ'Y)x.ocvwvTocL 1tp&Tov TouT' ocuTo u1tocpx.ov, 7toLoumv lhL μocALcr.oc &w8'1) Ta: 8E~6μEvot uypa: Ta:,; oaμoc,;; • oaoL TE lv TLaLV 'tWV μotAotXWV G)(,~μotTot cx1toμocTTELV E7tL)(.ELpouaL, TO 7totpoc7totV ax.~μot ou8e:v lv8ljAOV U7t1Xp)(.ELV ewaL, 1tpooμotAUVotVTE<;; 8e: OTL AEL6TotTOV CX7tEp')'1X~OVTotL.

FACTUM VERO Strictly speaking a new paragraph should begin at this point; at any rate, some confusion may arise, if it is not realized that Calcidius interprets the following part of the text of Plato, viz., Tim. 51A: aLo 8~ T~V TOU ')'Eyov6To,;; opotTOU xoct 7tlXVTW<;; oc£a6'1)TOU μ'1)T£pot XotL ur.080)(.~V μ~TE nv μ~TE cxepot μ~TE 7tUp μ~TE u8wp 1.eywμev ... He tra:r-slates the first words: I deoque facti generati visibilis animalis matrem (64, 14). Wrobel has wrongly printed matremque as Plato's words and not F actimt ... As for the translation, the following observations are to be made: 1) because of the absence of the article in Latin, Calcidius was obliged to add something like animal. 2) F actum generatumque seems to be another Calcidian doublet. Perhaps the author indirectly reveals his Christianity; in the Council of Nicaea, presided over by Ossius, yEvv'Y)OevTot ou 1tOL'1)6evTot was added to the Credo, and these terms were frequently used together. 3) xoct 1tocvTw,;; octa61JTOU remains untranslated but is commented upon by the words: vult intellegi sensilem mundum. OB RATIONEM SUPRA DICTAM Cp. 345, 13; 351, 12 SS., p. 175 and 187. There is only question of receptaculum, but mater and receptaculum belong together, as appears from the imagery in 345, 14: quia non ex gremio silvae. NEQUE TERRAM Cp. 340, 12-13, p. 161.

That Calcidius speaks, somewhat surprisingly, of matter as a species, is explained by Plato's d86i; ·n. Clearly he takes 1tocv8e:x_ei; as a noun and !μopcpov as its adjective. For the rest of the Greek text he gives an interpretation rather than a translation. NEC PLANE SENSIBILEM See par. 345. NEC PLANE INTELLEGIBILEM See par. 346-347 (cp. 345, 3-5; 346, 9-rr). INTER NULLAM ET ALIQUAM SUBSTANTIAM These words are Calcidius' own interpretation; they remind one of such pronounce-ments as quod semper non est and quae est quidem sed non eadem semper (355, 9-10; 355, r-2, p. 193-194). [335] These problems he discussed more fully in the Parme-nides where he inquired into how far the existing things share a likeness with the ideas. This is a difficult question because of the obscurity inherent in matter. Matter not only evades per-ception of the senses but also investigation of reason and scrutiny of the intellect. For, if the investigation attempts to consider matter by itself and without the accompaniment of the bodies which it takes in, it seems to be almost nothing; whereas, if matter is taken together with these bodies, it does not show its proper nature, and then is something lying between the senses and the intellect, neither wholly sensible nor quite intellectual, but something which must be known by a mental activity of such a nature that he who touches it feels nothing, and he who mentally elaborates its concept \"seems to have penetrated it by a kind of bastard reasoning. Therefore, the only means to reach matter is by regarding fire as a part of it that has become fiery, water as a part that has become liquid\", and the rest in the same manner. HAEC OPEROSIUS IN PARMENIDE On the basis of these words one would presume that Plato's Parmenides discusses the intricate process of the knowledge of matter. This is not so, nor is it likely that Calcidius thought so. Haec should be regarded as equivalent to talia, viz., \"similar difficult things\". Calcidius reveals this meaning by the words cum quaereret ... similitudinem. The ideas expressed herein come from the following passage (Parm. 132D): <XAA', W flo:pf1,&VL31), (L/XALC1't'OC E(LOL\"(E: XOC't'OC(f)OC(VE:'t'OCL w8e: l.x_e:LV.

Calcidius also referred to the Parmenides in par. 272 in connexion with the question as to the number of ideas. PROPTER SILVAE NATURALES TENEBRAS Cp. 346, 8-ro, where the various causes of obscurity are discussed. He states that obscurity arises because matter cannot be known through either the senses or the intellect. This is exactly what he now discusses. All passages about the intelligibility of matter may be recalled (305, 7 ss., see p. 50). A text from Ter-tullian's Adv. Hermog. (28, r, p. 45, 20-21 Wsz.) may also be of interest: quia etsi tenehras valet in substantia fuisse materiae.

That Calcidius had Plato's text before him is evident from the words which follow immediately adulterina quadam ratione. These are the translation of the sub-sequent words of the Timaeus. For the two formulas, see the com-ments on par. 345-347 (pp. 221-228).

For remedium see ad par. r (p. II). The next question is: but what then is matter? Everything existing can be classified in the categories. What is the relation of matter to the categories ? [336] Now, in how far does the nature of matter comprise all ten genera (categories)? I believe, it is 'essence' when, by entering it, the forms have made it appear to be something, for instance, a man or a house or one or another of the animals, trees or plants. It is 'quality' when, by being heated or coloured, it assumes some quality; 'quantity' when it is changed by the increase or decrease of bodies; 'np6c 't'L' (relation) when, in some form or appearance, its magnitude or exiguity is compared to the magnitude of something else; 'where' when it is limited and receives shape, for then it is thought to be in a place; 'when' when the rotation of the world has made it grow in time; 'location'"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"202 THE TREATISE ON MATTER when it is arrayed among the primary bodies, called elements.-the earth, according to our computations, being situated in the centre of the cosmos and fire above, occupying all high places everywhere; 'possession' when we say that the world has not only a soul but also a reason and an intellect; 'action' when matter moves the forms within itself; 'passion' when, in its tum, it is moved by the moving forms. QUATENUS IGITUR In Cat. I b 25 SS. Aristotle enumerates the categories.

When the way in which Calcidius brings matter under the ten categories is seen, it appears to be, as Fabricius says: non aetu tamen illa silvae insitnt sed potentia, or non effeetu sed possi-bilitate (338, 2-3; 344, 27-345, 1). Just previously, viz., in par. 319, Calcidius observed that, unlike all corporeal things, matter cannot possibly be brought sub eategorieam adpellationem. As to the category of passio he observed that, though this, too, should be 'detracted' from matter, matter, nevertheless, is thought to share it, because it is shared by the bodies present in it. Now the same reasoning is applied to all ten categories. Some particulars: The term genera for the categories occurs more frequently. Zeller (II 2, p. 49, note) observes that, besides the title xocT'Y)yoplocL (which may be genuine, though there is no certain proof), one also finds Ilept TWV aexoc yevwv, Ilept TWV yevwv TOU /Sv-roc:;, KocT'Y)yopLOCL ~TOL 1tept TWV aexoc YEVLXWTIXTWV yevwv. The term essentia is discussed fully by Calcidius in par. 226, where he also uses substantia (cp. 345, 2, p. 173). For eoetu, cp. 353, 19-20 ob speeierum multiformium eoetum, where eoetits translates aL' exdvwv, which itself refers to u1to -rwv etaL6v-rwv. This last word provides the explanation of the present use of eoetus. For esse ae videri, cp. 71, 2: Ex quo adparet hoe opus illis propemodum solis elaboratum esse ae videri, qui ... (cp. p. 11). vel hominem vel equum, the very examples quoted by Aristotle. Calcidius elaborates further; cp. 327, 27 ss. : non in artibus hominum, non in natura, non in eorporibus animalium, nee vero in arboribus aut stirpibus.

PATI Usually nouns are found here: habitus, actio, passio (cp. 343, 19). In the case of habere, Calcidius is lead into an error, since the Greek tx.e:Lv has the meaning here of exe:Lv with an adverb, 'to be in a certain condition', so that the correct translation would have been se habere; Aristotle states: ezm 8e: ofov u1to8e8E't'IXL, i:i1tAL<1't'IXL (ib.); Calcidius' mistake is due to the fact that this comment is open to both explanations. Calcidius' handling of the category 1t0Le'i:v asks for attention. The question arises how matter, this merely potential being, can be said to act. Moreover, although elsewhere the bodies are always the real subject, here matter itself is involved: cum eadem silva intra se movet species. How can this be said of matter? Calcidius has already given the answer earlier, viz., 353, 17 (p. 190): et easdem invicem movet species (cp. 376, 9, p. 236). What was noted there (p. 190), also holds here: a pure potentiality of matter cannot be maintained throughout, because it leads to many contradictions. It has been shewn (p. 169) that in par. 319 Calcidius expressed himself inaccurately; of matter it can be said: essentia est, but not that it is a quantity. The probable reason for this formulation is that the Greek text has 1toa6v ea-rL etc., in which Calcidius changed the adjectives into substantives. Finally, an observation made by Albinus is of importance (Epit. VI 10) : Kixt μ.e:v .. ~c; 8exix l<IX'O)'(Op(ixc; ev 't'E: -r<j') Ilixpμ.ev(87J l<IXL EV iiAAoLc; u1te:8d~e. Concerning this R. E. Witt (Albinus and the History of Middle Platonism, Cambridge, 1937, p. 3) says: \"Incidentally this is an excellent illustration of a tendency, which we shall be con-stantly encountering, to expound the Plator.ic philosophy in terms of later systems\". Perhaps it is even more correct to say that Aristotle's works were not unfrequently regarded as expressing more systematically Plato's ideas than Plato's works themselves. However, one needs not assume that, because of its markedly Aristotelian character, this text must have come from a Peripatetic source. c) The species [337] Then Plato continues: \"Is there a fire which is set apart and out of reach?\" Only now he begins to discuss these things.

We must, therefore, state briefly what is to be said of the exemplar. When discussing matter, we said that it is the primary foundation of the coming into existence of all natural things, so now the exemplar should be said the primary form. Every material is an object for an artisan, as bronze is for the sculptor, and wood for the shipwright. But these are not primary objects, since they are the products of other techniques, viz., bronze of mining, wood of hewing and pruning. Ultimately, the earth underlies all this, matter underlies the earth, but under matter there lies nothing. Therefore, matter is rightly called the 'first foundation'. In the same way a double form can be seen in the exemplar of things: the form by which matter is decorated, and, aiongside it, that form after the image of which the form conferred 1:pon matter is made. The form impressed in matter is the second form, the first is the one after the image of which the second has been made.

QUOD INTELLEGIBILIS The idea set forth by Plato is indeed, as Cal-cidius states: \"In the intelligible world there must be fire, water, etc., just as in the sensible world\". We already referred to the remarkable passage in Simplicius (In Phys. 31, 18 ss., p. 33-34) where this theory is traced back to Empedocles. For the description of Plato's standpoint, the text from the Parmenides mentioned above (p. 200) is important. In par. 272 Calcidius already writes about the intelligible fire; he even proves it to be composed of two principles.

However, since Aristotle's doctrine on the dooi; had been adopted by Middle Platonism with one important modifi-cation-for Aristotle accepted only one e!ooi;-, one cannot state dogmatically that here Calcidius uses a Peripatetic source. The present text serves as a further illustration of the statement made by Kraus and Walzer in the text quoted above, viz., that various authors have combined the doctrines of the two philosophers by adding the Aristotelian forma to the Platonic idea (o.c., p. 9). [338a] This will, in fact, become clearer, if considered with the aid of a comparison. Just as there is one form of ivory in the statue of the Capitoline Juppiter, and another, fashioned by the artist Apollonius in his spirit, to which he directed his mind when executing the ivory-and of these two forms the latter is prior to the former--, so also the form which has adorned matter is second in dignity, whereas the other, after which the second form was made, is the primary one, which is now under discussion. SED NIMIRUM This passage illustrates the preceding discussion and should be detached from what follows. The division of the paragraphs is inexact, as is obvious from the sequel. One may compare Seneca, Ep. 58, 20-21 with the passage translated: Quartum locum habebit dooi;. Quid sit hoe dooi;, attendas oportet et Platoni imputes, non mihi, hanc rerum difficultatem. Nulla est autem sine difficultate subtilitas. Paulo ante pictoris imagine utebar. !Ue cum reddere Vergilium coloribus vellet, ipsum intuebatur. Idea erat Vergilii facies, futuri operis exemplar. Ex hac quod artifex trahit et operi suo imposuit, dooi; est. Quid intersit, quaeris? Alterum exemplar est, alterum forma ab exemplari sumpta et operi imposita. Habet aliquam faciem exemplar ipsum quod intuens opif ex statuam figuravit: haec idea est. Etiam nunc, si aliam desideras distinctionem, dooi; in opere est, idea extra opus, nee tantum extra opus est, sed ante opus. What Seneca calls dooi; is here the species secunda; the idea is the exemplar. In Seneca's comparison this exemplar can be seen: it is Vergil's face; in that quoted by Calcidius the exemplum cannot, hence haurire animo; the differences, however, are irrelevant to the actual comparison. (In 94, 4 ss. Calcidius combines these two images: num speciem intellegibilis mundi, ad cuius similitudinem formas mente conceptas ad corpora transferebat. This is surprising, to say the least, in an author who already sees the intellegibilis mundus"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"206 THE TREATISE ON MATTER as the intellectus dei.) Seneca's last remark ante opus recalls anti-quior in 361, 23. Behind these comparisons is, no doubt, the image of Plato's Demiurge who fashions the world with an eye to the eternal things. On this example Borghorst (o.c., p. 35) observes: cum neque de A pollonio artifice neque de hac statua quidquam certe traditum sit, non temerarium est conicere utrumque satis incognitum. He suggests too that Calcidius may have romanized an example about the statue of Zeus by Phidias. Switalski (o.c., p. 3, n. r) states: \"Eher gegen eine Bekanntschaft mit Rom scheint die Erwahnung der e 1 fen be in er n en Statue des J uppiter Capitolinus zu sprechen\". One could accept the first suggestion, but the latter conclusion is historically unsound. speciem eboris polire, a proleptic accusative like viam munire. [338b] Of matter we also said that it is without quality. In the same way we shall say that the primary form has no quality, and yet it is not deprived of it: for everything having quality must have quality in itself, but the primary form has no quality-it is indeed without a nature in which quality can rest. Thus it has no quality <hut yet it is not deprived of quality>, for one can only speak of privation, if a thing has not what it should have. But as one cannot speak of an intrepid stone, because a stone by nature cannot be afraid of anything, so it cannot be said of the primary form that it is deprived of quality, because, on the one hand, its nature is alien to quality and, on the other hand, it is itself the cause that other things are endowed with quality. And just as of the soul cannot be said to be animated nor in-animate-not animated, because the soul does not need protection of another soul, not inanimate, because it itself causes life in other living beings-, so one looks upon matter as neither material nor deprived of matter: it is not called material, because matter does not need other matter, and not deprived of matter, because all material things are what they are through it [339a] And there-fore, one must think of the primary form in just the same way, that is, one regards it as neither endowed with nor deprived of quality. It was also said of matter that it is without form<; likewise, it will be said that the primary form was not formed> but is not without form either. Everything that has been formed must be"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 338-339 207 composed of that which shares in the form and that which can be shared; as, for instance, a statue. That which shares is the bronze, that which is shared is the imprinted form; but the form is simple, not composite. Therefore the form is said to be neither formed nor without form, for, through it, all other things formed have a form. In the translation some changes and additions are included which, in our conviction, are required by the context. First the division in paragraphs: it is clear to the reader that there are two parallel arguments, both beginning in the same way: Rursum silvam dicebamus (362, 1) andRursum silva dicebatur (362, 21). The current division into paragraphs is inadequate, for the first sentence of par. 339 is actually the conclusion of the first argument. Moreover, in the manuscript tradition, the second argument contains some assertions which are patently absurd. The parallelism of the two arguments enables one to re::,tore the original text. To begin with a small detail of text criticism. The first dicebamus is immediately followed by another. Calcidius states that the form neither has nor lacks qualities. He has still to discuss this, hence the second dicebamus should be rejected, and dicemus of the best manuscripts accepted. RURSUM SILVAM As for the content, again matter is the starting-point of the argument but scarcely more. Of matter he implies that it is without quality (inops qualitatis), but of form that it is neither with nor without quality, which is a very different thing. The real parallel with this assertion about form is found in 362, 15: sic silvam quoque neque silvestrem putamus nee silva carere. The argument is as follows: \"if a thing is to be endowed with qualities, then, as the words themselves say, there are two things: something in which the qualities are and the qualities themselves. In the case of forms (the ideas) there is no such thing. Therefore, they are not endowed with quality. No more can be a question of their being deprived of qualities (Switalski rightly saw that this link was left out in the transmission of the text (o.c., p. 104)), for this means that the form should have them but actually has not. But this is not the case\", Calcidius continues with two illustrations. \"A stone cannot be called intrepid, because this adjective is not applicable to it, nor can the species be said to be endowed with quality, because this has nothing to do with species.\" It looks as if Calcidius realizes suddenly that his last statement"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"208 THE TREATISE ON MATTER is inaccurate, and adds: \"and because it is itself the cause of every quality\". This addition makes it clear that the meaning of 'having nothing to do with it' is quite different from that used of the in-trepid stone and that the comparison is not apt. Had Calcidius left out this example he might have said more briefly: \"Here there can be no question of a privation of quality, because the form itself is the cause of every quality\". The following illustration makes it perfectly plain: \"a soul cannot be said to be animated, in other words, that it is endowed with another soul, nor can it be said inanimate, for ultimately it is the cause of the existence of every-thing animated. No more can matter be said to be material (endowed with matter) or to be deprived of matter; nor can form be said to be endowed with qualities or to be deprived of it\". This thesis (neque qualitate praedita neque sine qualitate) reminds one of Albinus' statement ahout God: '' Apprrroc; 8' fo,t xcxt vcj'i μovep A'1)1t,6c;, we; \" ' \\ J I ' \\ ,, T'1' ,, ~ I •,'' '~\\ A I A 1.

Albinus' word~ about the divine principle are applied by Calcidius to the principle of form. The second example put forward by Calcidius, that the soul cannot be said to be <:'ither animated or deprived of a soul, is also found in Nemesim,, De nat. hom. 2: &To1tov 8e: xoct TO &ljiux_ov xcxt To lμljiux_ov Aeye:tv niv IJiux~v (cp. Tertullian, De anima, eh. 6, 1, ed. Waszink, p. 132). RURSUM SILVA NON DICEBATUR After discussing quality, Calcidius now discusses form. The version of the manuscripts runs: Rursum silva dieebatur informis sed nee informis. This is, first of all, a flagrant contradiction, and, moreover, untrue; for matter was called informis and nothing else. The editions have altered the text somewhat and read: Rursum sitva non dieebatur formata sed nee informis. This correction plays down the contra-diction, but still does not agree with Calcidius' previous teaching; secondly, the change is not supported by manuscript evidence; thirdly, it does not solve several other problems in this passage. The solution of this textproblem is given by the study of the text as a whole. To begin with the most obvious mistake, by way of conclusion, the last sentence runs: \"matter is said neither formed"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 338-339 209 nor without form, for all that has been formed owes its form to it\". It is evident that it is not matter which is the formative principle but the species, the form. Moreover, one may also refer to the parallel passage in the first argument: \"form cannot be said to be without quality, for it is itself the cause of things having quality\". Thus in 363, 2 spec£es should be read instead of silva. The way to the so-lution is now open. If in 363, 2 the species is mentioned in a con-clusion, it must have received previous attention. The argumer,t, as it stands, is entirely about the silva. The beginning is correct, namely that, as in the first argument, Calcidius starts from matter. The question then arises: Where does Calcidius pass from matter to form? There can surely be no doubt about this: as in the first argument, this transition must have been made almost immediately, actually in the first phrase, which is incomprehensible as trans-mitted by the manuscripts. Owing to the parallel argument of the first reasoning, the text can be restored with reasonable certainty. Above Calcidius said: Rursum silvam dicebamus esse inopem quali-tatis, dicem11,s etiam principalem speciem neque qualitate praeditam neque sine qualitate. He must have stated in a passive tense: Rursum silva dicebatur t'.n/ormis <, dicetur et£am principal is species non /ormata>, sed nee in/ormis, a fact evident from the conclusion just mentioned: propterea igitur species negatur esse /ormata, nee vero minime est /ormata. Finally, the present text still poses a third problem, namely the meaning of quae res in 363, I. One would like to combine it with impressa /orma, but why then quae re s and not simply quae? Besides, simplex et incomposita are adjectives specific to principles, and, as one saw, the impressae /ormae do not belong to them. In the restored text Calcidius argues that the species cannot have been formed, for 'formed' presupposes composition. One expects him to say that the species is not composed but simplex and in-composita, and to read: sed species est simplex et incomposita. Since the words quae res and sed species are abbreviated in the manuscripts the corruption is easily explained paleographically. Its genesis, one suggests, was as follows: In 362. 21 the transition to species must have fallen out by a kind of homoioteleuton. Owing to this, an early reader, no longer understanding the abbreviation of sed species in 363, I, changed it into quae res. And in agreemt>nt with that he changed the later species into silva. For to him, how Philosophia Antigua, VIII 14."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"2IO THE TREATISE ON MATTER could there suddenly be question of species, when the whole argument seemed to refer to the silva.

EXANIMEM (362, 13-14) Cp. the comment on 334, 15, p. 139. Calcidius repeatedly refers in the present treatise to his discussion of the silva. In both passages reminiscences of Albinus' treatise about God can be heard, especially in that about the species. Perhaps one may conclude that Calcidius' reflections on matter were inspired by Albinus' discussion of the third principle, God (Epit. X). Probably he first applied Albinus' argument to the species and then to the silva. The evidence of Albinus' influence upon Calcidius is seen in the following text. [339b J Therefore, to state it graphically, from our standpoint the primary form is the first intelligible thing because we have an intellect; from God's standpoint it is the perfect thought (idea) of God; from the standpoint of matter it is the measure of bodily and material things; considered in itself it is an un-bodily substance and the cause of all things deriving their likeness from it; seen from the cosmos it is the eternal exemplar of all that nature has produced; and to formulate it in a few words, the primary form, which is the idea, is defined as an immaterial substance, without colour or figure, intangible, but to be grasped by the intellect and the cause of all that owes its likeness to it. Of the two descriptions mentioned the elaborate one corresponds entirely with that given by Albinus in Epit. IX I. In the following survey the order found in Albinus is adapted to that given by Calcidius. The more extensive Latin text is the result of Calcidius' liking for elaboration.

SINE TACTU, INTELLECTU TAMEN This in opposition to the cognoscibility of matter (see par. 345-347). For other pas-sages about the idea see ad 353, 23 (p. 191). [340] Plato himself explains that the species exists from eternity when he says: \"If insight and true opinion are two things, they must exist by themselves, perceptible by the in-tellect rather than the senses; but if, as some people think, true opinion differs in no way from insight, then all that is perceived by the senses of the body must be regarded as certain. But I think one must say that they are two things, because they differ greatly: for the one becomes known to us by instruction, the other by persuasion; the one always in connection with true argumentation, the other without any argumentation at all. Moreover, the one cannot be shaken by persuasion, whereas the other is always wavering, uncertain and open to refutation; and, furthermore, true opinion is shared by everyone, whereas insight is possessed by God and a few very well-chosen men\". Plato makes a fourfold distinction between insight and opinion when he teaches that 1) one of them, viz., insight, is produced by instruction, the other by mere persuasion; 2) one is connected with true arguments, the other without any examination by reason; 3) one of them cannot be shaken by persuasion; 4) one,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"212 THE TREATISE ON MATTER i.e., opm10n, is shared by all, while insight is the property of God and a very small number of select men alone. If the difference between insight and opinion is so great, there must also be a great difference between the things pertaining to them; these are the intelligible genus and that which allows for opinion. Therefore, Plato rightly says: \"there is one species all by itself, without origin or end, receiving nothing into itself and entering nothing, invisible and imperceptible\". This is the species of the insight, called 'idea', and hence it is exemplar. But, this time, he does not doubt-as he did earlier-that he does not presume in vain the existence of this intelligible form, the images of which are sensible, and that, perhaps, it is no longer a question of mere words. [341] Nor does he hesitate to explain this by means of syl-logistic arguments. Taking care, on the one hand, not to leave anything unexamined, and, on the other, not to add a flow of irrelevant words to a treatise already profuse in itself, he removes all doubt with a brief syllogistic argument, and thus arrives methodically at a syllogism. This syllogism runs as follows: between the man who has insight and the man who has a true opinion, there is the difference that he who has insight has a certainty about things which he has learned from investigation based on reason. Reason, once confirmed, becomes insight, and science and wisdom are connected with the latter. Therefore, because he knows what he understands, the man with insight will not change his opinion through verisimilar persuasions, and, a man endowed with knowledge, he can give an account of what he understands. On the other hand, he who has a true opinion can give no reason for it, because he relies solely upon a mental fashion, without reasoning or discipline, and occasionally, a wa-vering and doubting man, he will change his opinion through false persuasion, because no solid argument supports him. Plato expresses it in this syllogism: \"If insight and true opinion are the same, then all that is perceived by means of the body is certain and will be undoubtedly true; but if true opinion is inferior to insight these will not be the same but rather two different things, and then the things perceived by the senses and those by the intellect will also differ. And if the things perceived by the senses and those by the intellect are different, then it is"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 341 213 necessary that intelligible forms should exist, which are called ideas. Not everything that is perceived by the body is true and certain; therefore, the ideas do exist. As these two paragraphs belong together, they must be studied as a whole so that the structure of the entire passage becomes clear. At first sight it looks as though Calcidius is harping on the same theme and his argument makes no progress, but this is not true. Calcidius begins with a translation of Tim. 51 D up to the end of 51E, where Plato enumerates four differences between voui; and 86~oc. He only examines the last part bearing upon the fourfold distinction. He continues the translation, and with Plato asserts that there must exist species intellegibiles. At this stage he returns to the syllogism, the first part of the translated text, and para-phrases it together with the preceding introduction in Plato (51C). In the form of a syllogism this paraphrase repeats the text quoted at the beginning of par. 340. QUOD VERO HAEC SIT EX AETERNITATE These introductory words are misleading, for the reader might suppose that Plato intends to discuss the eternity of the ideas. Instead the conclusion is: sunt igitur ideae. Thus what is demonstrated here is the existence not the eternity of the ideas. The existence of the ideas has, in fact, not yet been proved. After the preceding reflections the reader may be inclined to forget this, and, Calcidius, no doubt, did not realize it himself at the beginning of this paragraph. A similar state of affairs is found in the treatise about matter, where the actual proof of the existence of matter was only furnished towards the end, in par. 317. Here too Calcidius began as if he intended to discuss a property of matter. The parallel is too striking to be accidental. The fact that he discusses the eternity of the ideas first is probably due to 1) the eternity of the ideas came to his mind once he had mentioned their simplicity (and with it their being deprived of all qualities); for, as he expounded in par. 305-307, the principles are simple, without quality, and eternal; 2) Plato's words in 52A: ciytVV1)'rOV xoct ClVWAE6pov.

QUADRIFARIAM DIVIDIT As already noted, Calcidius only discusses the last part of Plato's text-a discussion which is little more than a different wording of the text. QUOD SI HORUM Cal-cidius draws the conclusion: \"there exist a genus intellegibile and a genus opinabile\". He follows it up with the relevant text of Plato: Tou-rwv OE ou-rcoc;; ex6v-rwv (Calcidius has said this more extensively in Quod si ... ) O(.LOAOY'Y)'t'£0V iv (.LEV &LVCXL 't'O.

Then he gives a further explanation: intellectus species, quae idea dicitur, est: igitur exemplum. Finally he notes that Plato doubts no longer, as previously (&pcx fo-rtv 't'L 1tup cxu-ro ecp' ecxu-rou ;).

Thus, re-reading the text he comes to the part already translated in the first part of this section. ID TAMEN IPSUM The structure of these paragraphs sug-gests a repetition of the previous paragraph. But, whereas iu the latter there was at first the question of the preamble of the ar-gument, Calcidius now submits the argument itself to a closer examination, ending in the formulation of the syllogism. QUIPPE CAVENS Calcidius still follows Plato's text: olhe: ouv o~ -ro 1tocpov OCXflL't'OV XCXL OCOLXCX<r't'OV occpev't'ot OC~LOV cpocvotL OLL<rXUflL~oμ.e:vov lxe:w OU't'<.uc;;, ou-r' £7tL Myou μ.~x.e:L 1tocpe:pyov &Mo μ.~xoc;; £7t&(.L~A'Y)'t'£0V (51 C). SYL-LOGISTICIS COMPENDIIS By a short cut (Plato: OL(X ~pocxewv)' Calcidius states, Plato arrives methodically (ductu et via) at the syllogism itself. These compendia syllogistica are constituted by what is said in Etenim ... sustentat. The chief content of par. 240 is repeated once again. CONFIRMAT.A PORRO RATIO FIT INTELLECTUS Reasoning, the argument receives its confirmation in the under-standing (intellectwm adpellat ... 'motum animi conprehendentem' (366, 5)), and thus it becomes intelligence or insight; to this insight belongs scientia ( = emcr~μ.YJ) also called sapientia. For eademque, cp. 299, 16. ITAQUE PLATO Calcidius finally formulates the text with which he began. He changes the order of Plato's text"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 342 215 and amplifies it slightly. A similar argument is found in par. 302: Certum est siquidem apud omnes ... esse in nobis sensus, esse etiam intellectum et haec esse non eadem sibi: etc. The antithesis scientia -opinio occurs frequently: 124, 1; 172, 11 ss. (translation of Tim. 37B-C); 244, 8; in 201, 22 ss. the concept of sapientia is found. Evidently the argument had become a locus communis to such an extent that its occurrence in Albinus (Epit. IX 4, see ad par. 302) hardly carries any weight in the question of dependence of Calcidius on Albinus. After the rather cumbersome treatment of the subject in par. 240-241 one is somewhat surprised to read in the first sentence of par. 242 that \"the previous compact discussion necessitates a further elaboration\". The study of par. 242, however, reveals that Calcidius has read something else into Plato's words, not yet discussed, and this is the reason why he wishes to go further into the question. [342] What has been compressed within the narrow compass of a syllogism requires elaboration. By 'insight' Plato understands the comprehending activity of the mind. In most of his other books, most clearly the Republic, he compares this with opinion. He divides insight into 'knowledge' and 'memory'; he divides opinion similarly into 'belief' and 'fancy', connecting each of these four concepts with the things pertaining to it: knowledge with the lofty things preceived only by wisdom, such as God and His thoughts which are called ideas; memory with things requiring deliberation, i.e., such things as are required by artificial laws and theories; belief with the sensible things, those which are perceived by the eyes, the ears and the other senses; and fancy with the imaginary and fictitious things, bodies shaped after the example of real figures but not perfect and alive. All these things by themselves, he states, \"are perceived rather by the intellect than by the senses\", because none of the four is within the reach of the senses but one distinguishes between knowledge and opinion and the rest by means of the mind. SED, OPINOR, EXPLANARI The passage poses the question what exactly Calcidius intended to prove by this exposition. He states that it explains what precedes, but one cannot help wondering, what he is actually explaining. One may suppose that this para-"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"216 THE TREATISE ON MATTER graph is another of his favourites, and that he inserts it here as a quasi-explanation of what precedes, but this is not the case. He really wishes to explain (a part of) Plato's text at this point, a text which, for the most part, he misunderstands. The actual wording of this paragraph must be considered first. INTELLECTUM ADPELLAT Calcidius tries to say that by intellectus the act of understanding is meant: voui; is here v67J<n<;. IN POLITIA Two passages are of importance at this stage, viz., 533D, where Plato gives the fourfold distinction quoted here, and 509D ss., where the object of the four 'ways of knowing' is stated. The latter has not been mentioned by Switalski (o.c., p. 100).

In this quotation recordatio translates otavotix, aestimatio etxixo(ix. Calcidius' idiom, especially recordatio, is peculiar. As has been seen already, Plato in 509D mentions the objects of the four ways of knowing, beginning with the last. The etxixcr(ix has for its object the etx6vei;, i.e., shadows, reflections in water, etc.; Calcidius states: aestimationem (adcommodat) fictis commenticiisque et imaginariis rebits, quae iuxta veros simulata vultus corpora tamen perf ecta et viva non sunt. Il(cr-rti; refers to that of which the dx6vei; are reflections, name-ly, animals, plants and all created things; Calcidius: credulitatem porro sensibilibus ... Plato describes in detail the objects of otavotix, on which the partner in the discussion finally notes: μixv6avw ... o-rt T<X u1to -rix·r:i; yewμe-rp(xixti; -re xixt -rix'i:i; TIXU'Oj<; &oe)..cpix'i:i; -rexvixt<; Myet<; (511B).

The conformity with Plato's text is striking and much nearer than with that of Albinus, Epit.

In the last part, which is nearest to the text of Calcidius, he speaks of 1t(cr-rL<; and elxoccr(oc but does not (explicitly) mention these two as a subdistinction of 86~oc. QUAE CUNCTA DICIT \"Of all this he says that by itself it can be perceived by the intellect rather than by the senses\". This surprising twist in the argument reveals what Calcidius is aiming at. He has obviously in mind the beginning of the quotation in par. 340: Si intellectus itemqiee vera opinio duae res sunt, necesse est haec ipsa per semet esse intellectu potius quam sensibus adsequenda; the verbal concordance is perfect. Calcidius meant haec ipsa to refer to intellectus et vera opinio, where-as for Plato these terms refer to the ideas. In the present section he first subdivides this intellectus and opinio, stating: \"all these distinctions are things which are rather perceived by the iPtellect than by the senses: this is what Plato intended to say here\". The actual text runs as follows: Quae cuncta dicit per semet esse intellectu potius quam sensibus adsequenda, quia nihil ex his quattuor sub sensus nostros venit, sed tam scientiam quam opinionem et ceteras mente discernimus. When one appreciates how peculiar the content of the text becomes in this way, it is understandable why Calcidius wrote paragraph 342 as an ex-planation. Actually he himself did not understand the passage, though, generally speaking, he remained true to Plato's thought. [343] \"But if, as it seems to some\", he says, \"true opinion differs in nothing from insight\". Just so; for many groups of philosophers have certainly considered bodies to be the principles of things. Placing the intelligible genus, that is the ideas, almost before our eyes, Plato says that it is \"an intelligible form, im-perceptible for the senses, standing by itself, without origin or end, receiving nothing within itself nor passing over into any-thing else, invisible and impalpable, only perceptible for the attentively looking mind\". He adds: \"and what comes in the second place is originated, perceptible by the senses, in need of support, appearing in a certain place and henc;e disappearing again through change and annihilation, knowable by the senses and the opinion\". Here he wishes to give an idea of the second species, which comes into being, when the artisan fashions the lines of a future work in his mind and, keeping the picture within him, fashions from this example that which he has set himself"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"218 THE TREATISE ON MATTER to make. Of this he says: \"that it appears in some place, and disappears from there through change and annihilation\". Ex-cellently said; for the demolition of a statue is always coupled with the destruction of its form, and the same holds good, when it is recalled and returns in the shape of another statue. 'Perceptible by the se11ses', he calls this form, because the form impressed into the work is seen by the eyes of the onlookers; 'knowable by opinion', because the maker's mind does not convey this form from a fixed example but draws it from his own mind to the best of his ability. SIN VERO Calcidius dwells still briefly on Tim. 51D. MULTAE QUIPPE SECTAE The Stoics are certainly intended. With Fabricius one includes Democritus and Epicurus. CUMQUE INTELLEGIBILE Again Calcidius quotes Tim. 52A, a passage already given in par. 340. The translation is extensive, because at the end Calcidius also translates the words: -rou-ro o o~ v6'1)<m; e:lA'IJXEV emrr:v.01te:i:v CONSE-QUENTER ADDIT Tim. 52A: 't\"O oe: oμwvuμov 8μoL6v 't\"E EY.ELV(p oe:{m:pov, ,_o I i I , I I I 1f I \\ otLoV'IJ't\"OV, YEW'IJ't\"OV, m:qiop'l)μe:vov otEL, yLyvoμe:vov 't\"E t:V 't\"LVL 't\"07t(p XotL 7t0CALV exe:~8e:v (X7t0AAUμe:vov, o6~TI μe:-r' a:tcr0~rre:w,:; 1te:pLA'l)1t't\"6v. IN-TELLEGIBILE GENUS Cp. 364, 18: intellegibile genus (p. 214). Evidently Calcidius takes m:qiop'l)μevov in the sense of 'supported' (sustentabile), not of 'moving'. CUM OPIFEX ...

EFFIGIE INTUS LOCATA Cp. 361, 24: antiquior. OPINIONE VERO NOSCENDUM From the way in which he expresses himself one concludes he is not thinking of the divine but of the human maker. He speaks of an artist who makes a statue after a conception he has formed-which for him, of course, is not a certum exemplum-a statue, which, therefore, is an object of opinio, not of intellectus. In other words, he has a particular kind of species secundae, viz., the human ones, in mind, and not the species secundae in general. The secundae species made by the divine opifex would be more correct. Evidently Calcidius' only concern is to put the 'second form' on a lower level. EX PROPRIA MENTE HAUSTAM Like 361, 22: hausit animo."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 344 219 d) Matter in itself Calcidius first spoke of the characteristics of matter. This led him to the first and the second species. Afterwards he returns to matter. Tertium genus esse dicit loci: he now discusses not the characteristics of matter but matter itself. [344] \"The third genus is that of place\", according to Plato. I think that he called matter 'the third genus' on the ground of dignity. The second form, the one which comes into being, owes its existence to the primary form, being eternal, without an origin and denoted by the name 'idea'; matter, coming last, owes its existence to the form which has come into existence. He calls it 'place' because it is, as it were, a kind of space which takes up the images of the unbodily and intelligible forms; 'always the same' because it either is without origin and end, or must be the place, the abode and, as it were, the receptacle of the corporeal forms. These are the limbs of the world which, in the opinion of almost everyone, is indissoluble and eternal: \"therefore, it is immortal itself and a four.dation to all that arises in its womb\". TERTIUM GENUS ESSE DICIT LOCI Tim. 52A: -rpl-rov ae: ocu yevo~ ov -ro -r~~ zwpoc~. For the term genus, see ad 354, 10 (p. 192). That there must be a third principle besides the first and the second form was already said by Plato in 48E. Calcidius discussed this text in par. 273, where he also mentioned the term 'space'. PUTO ENIM The first part of this assertion (Quippe ... ) is self-evident, but the second (Silva demum ... ) is quite uncommon. By substantia prob-ably 'existence' is meant. Calcidius then continues that matter cannot exist before the species come into it, for matter cannot exist without form; cp. 337, 22-23: non quo sine his umquam esse possit; see par. 349 especially. Thus the assertion that the 'imagines et simulacra vere existentium in silva substantiam accipiitnt' (345, 10-11 and 336, 1) is in complete accordance with the statement that matter only exists through form. Matter gives existence to the species by providing them with a foundation, and the forms, in their turn, give existence to matter, because matter can only exist with form. Here is the Aristotelian theory that matter and form are no entia quae but entia quibus. SINE ORTU ET AETERNA Cp. 364, 20; 367, 3. IDEAE Cp. 353, 23 (p. 191). AT VERO LOCUM"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"220 THE TREATISE ON MATTER Calcidius interprets the term locus as 'space' in full agreement with Plato's xwpcx; that this is identical with UAlj is obvious to him. In Aristotle one reads (209 b 11-12): ~Lo xcxl IJM-rwv TIJV UAljV xcxl -rr,v xwpcxv -rcxu-r6 tp'r)O'Lv dvcxL Ev -rcj> T Lμcx(cr.

The cxt0'6'r)-r<X are the simulacra specierum incorporearum. SEMPER EANDEM Matter is said to be 'always existing' either be-cause it is without origin and end or because it is the foundation of an eternal world. This tum of the argument is not surprising if it is appreciated that Calcidius is explaining Plato's text: &.d (semper eadem) <r6opav ou 1tpoO\"oe:x6μevov (vel quia sine generatione et inter -it u) EOpcxv oe: 7totpexov ISO'ot ixe:L yeve:O'LV 7tOCO'LV (vel quia necesse est eam locum St at i One m q U e ... ). QUAE SUNT MEMBRA MUNDI The qualification of the forms as 'limbs of the world' is obvious; forms give matter a figure: they are, to some extent for the world, what the limbs are for the body. When in Tim. 33B ss. Plato remarks that \"the body of the world needs no limbs\", he speaks about an entirely different thing. MUNDI ... INDISSOLUBILIS ET AETERNI In par. 23 Calcidius discussed why the world, though created, can be eternal. This is possible, because its Creator God does not operate in time. The eternity of the world was the almost general opinion from the time of Aristotle. Such a theory clashed with Plato's statement that (the soul of) the cosmos came into being (yev'r)-r6c;). Plutarch and Atticus harmonized the two by taking &.yeV'r)-roc; to refer to the mass of the world when still in disorderly motion and ye:v'r)-r6c; to the world as an orderly whole. PROPE was probably added by Calcidius with the Jews in mind. Those texts of Plato which seemed to point to another direction were interpreted in an Aristotelian sense. At indissolubilis Calcidius may have recalled Tim. 41A, where the Maker of everything tells the lower gods that the works of his hand cannot be dissolved save by his consen~. But although all bound can be unbound, it would be the deed of a wicked man to dissolve what is beautiful and good: theoretical dissolubility goes with practical indissolubility. IPSA ERGO INMORTALIS After the interpretation of Plato's words their translation follows once more. In Calcidius the translation usually precedes the interpretation. Concerning the two last words the manuscripts vary. Wrobel conjectures dat substantiam: matter bestows 'existence' to the second forms, in the same way as seen"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 345 22! before (silva demum ex nativa specie sumit substantiam). However, if this reading were correct, one would expect in suo gremio instead of in eiusdem gremio. Most MSS read datur substantia which signifies: matter is given as a substratum {u1tox.ElμEvov) to the species secundae. Hence substantia has the following meanings: I) substantia = essentia = natura (oualoc), cp. 345, 2 (p. r73); 2) substantia = existence (u1t6a-rocmi;), cp. 345, II; 368, I (p. r74 and 2r9); 3) substantia = substratum (u1tox.ElμEvov), cp. 368, 9. In the first case one speaks of the substantia silvae; in the second: matter gives existence to the species and vice versa, in the third: matter is the substratum of the species. Par. 345-347 Calcidius now analyses the act of knowing with re-gard to matter. Since the order of being and the order of knowing run parallel in Calcidius' opinion, this analysis leads him to a better understanding of matter itself. The starting-point is Plato's text: OCU't'O 8e fLE't'' OCVOCL<r6'1)<JLOC<; CX7t't'OV Aoytaμ<j> 't'LVL v66ep (52B). [345] Then he continues saying, with wonderful insight, that \"matter is touched without the touching man perceiving it\". Everything that is touched is sensible and an object of the senses, and thus everything that is touched must be perceived by sensible perception. How then can we say that a thing can be touched that is untouchable by nature? Now consider the depth of intellect and the conciseness of words which express the suspicion of his mind on matter. No doubt, everything that has the semblance to another thing is know11 by means of its resemblance. Therefore, as the knowledge of something certain and definite is certain and definite, the suspicion concerning something uncertain and indefinite must be uncertain and indefinite. Therefore, since perception is the perception of certain and definite things, viz., of things having form and quality, the knowledge of these things must be certain and definite. But matter is something indefinite, for by nature it is without a form and a figure. Hence the imagination is not by perception of it, and thus it is 'without perception'. Yet there is some superficial contact but no real touch, and this with the bodies in it rather than with itself. When these are perceived, the feeling arises that matter itself is perceived, because it seems to be formed by the species it takes in, whereas, in reality it is formless. And thus the perception of the forms present in"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"222 THE TREATISE ON MATTER matter is clear but that of matter itself, which underlies these forms, is obscure, and a co-perception rather than a perception. Therefore, since not matter itself is perceived but what is of matter, and since it only seems to be perceived together with the material things, there arises such an uncertain sense. And, consequently, it is well said that \"matter is touched without being perceived by the man who touches it\", for it is not really touched. It is exactly as when someone says that darkness is seen without being perceived, for the eyesight of one who sees darkness does not perceive in the same way as when he sees the usual coloured and bright things. On the contrary, there is an opposite effect; there arc a loss and privation of all that the eyes see-for darkness is without colour and brightness of light; the eyesight cannot grasp any quality of darkness but it can suspect what is not rather than what is; and, seeing nothing, it thinks that it sees the very thing which it does not see, and it thinks that it sees something, whereas it does not see anything-what kind of seeing can there be in darkness? But, since the nature of the eye is. to distinguish colours, I think that, trying to perceive that which is colourless, it has the suspicion of perceiving darkness. In this way matter too is tangible, because one gets the impression that it is touched, when that which is touched first of all comes within reach of the senses. However, contact with matter is accidental; it is untouchable itself, because it is perceived by neither the sense of touch nor the other senses. The distinction of this long-winded paragraph is as follows: 1) Explanation of the question (368, 10-15); 2) Explanation of the first part of Plato's words: sine sensu (368, 15-369, 4); 3) Ex-planation of the second part: ipsam tangi (369, 4-16); 4) Com-parison (369, 16-370, 1); 5) Conclusion (370, 1-6). I. DEINDE PROGREDIENS The train of thought, which is some-what intricate, is: Plato uses a wonderful expression, viz., 'contact without perception'. Why is this wonderful? What is touched is sensible; so what is touched is susceptible of perception. And now Plato says: 'contact without perception'. Then there must be question of an exceptional kind of contact here. How can a thing, which by itself is intangible, be touched? (contiguus here means is qiti contingi potest, cp. Thes. L.L. IV 698, 83-699, 9). After in-"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 345 223 dicating the way to a solution in the last question, Calcidius dis-cusses Plato's formula stage by stage. 2. VIDE ALTITUDINEM \"Look how pointedly Plato puts it and reveals his suspicio concerning matter\". Suspicio is, as will appear later on (371, 2-3, p. 227), the technical term whereby Calcidius indicates the cognition of matter. To prove this, Calcidius begins from the statement that a semblance is known by means of that which it resembles. In par. 51 he calls it a Pythagorean theory: Est porro Pythagoricum dogma similia non nisi a similib1ts suis conprehendi (par. 51 is perhaps Numenian, cp. p. 43). This state-ment is also found in Aristotle: ytyvwaxea6ou ycx:p -r<j> oμo£ci> -ro 15μotov (De an. 404 b 26-27). Albinus too mentions the Pythagoreans as a source: ~ ycx:p -r<j> oμo(ci> -ro 15μotov yvwp(~e-roct, we:; -roi:c:; Ilu6ocyope£mc:; cxpfoxet (Epit. XIV 2). For a short summary of the history ot this theory see: A. J. Festugiere, Contemplation et Vie Contemplative selon Platon, Paris, 1936, p. 107-no; Oberweg, o.c., p. 95). This principle is, in all probability, mostly understood in this sense: \"things (e.g., fire) are known by means of corresponding things (for instance, fire, which is the essence of the intellect), whereas Calcidius says: \"by means of a corresponding act of knowing\". He argues: \"certain things are known by means of a certain, un-certain things by means of an uncertain act of knowing\".-He denotes this uncertain act by the term suspicio. Perception (sensus), however, is a certain act of knowing, because it has certain things as its objects. Therefore perception of matter is impossible, since matter is not a certain thing. Knowledge, therefore, of matter-Calcidius here uses imaginatio-is not perception. Hence Plato rightly says: sine sensu. 3. FIT T AMEN Yet there is something like touching, though without contact. How can tJ-,is be? The solution given here runs parallel to that of the categories in their relation to matter: what is really touched is that which is in matter and in this way there arises a suspicio that matter itself is touched. There is a real sensus of the things present in matter, but a con-sensus of matter, in the literal sense of 'co-perceiving', and so Plato rightly says: sine sensu tangitur. 4.

There is no question of a real perception"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"224 THE TREATISE ON MATTER here, yet we believe we see what actually we do not see. The translation of nihilque videns id ipsum sibi videtur videre quod non videt has been taken as meaning the same as the following et videre se aliquid putat, cum nihil videat. In this case quod is a relative pronoun. It may also be read in the sense of 'the fact that'. Then we ought to think that we see the very fact that we do not see. This interpretation does not appear to be very plausible. Tertullian sees it differently, Adv. Hermog. 28, 1 (45, 22-23 Wsz.): Etiam homini tenebrae visibiles sunt-hoc enim ipsum quod sunt tenebrae videtur-, nedum deo. The use of the comparison with seeing darkness was suggested to Calcidius once he had spoken of the silvae naturales tenebras (359, 9-10, p. 201).

What darkness is for the eye, the u).7i is for all colours; remove all colours and darkness alone remains. If, in this way, the mind takes away the forms of things, it keeps nothing of what is definite and has a form, and becomes like the eye gazing into darkness.

They are actually meant so, whereas Calcidius divides the passage into two, and interprets them as if they denote two different acts of cognition.

SIC IGITUR This is now self-evident."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 346-347 225 [346] And unsatisfied with this exact formulation, he added that matter can be perceived \"by means of a sort of illegitimate or bastard thinking\". Everyone knows that all children are natural, but both the Greeks and ourselves give a different name to the legitimate and the illegitimate. The legitimate the Greeks call yv~aLoL, the illegitimate \\lo0oL. [347] ... just as <consonants> without vowels are mute, but in combination with vowels contribute something and have a genuine sound. However, the assertion that matter is infinite and uncertain is certain. Hence Plato rightly believes that matter is perceived by means of illegitimate and false thinking, and by opinion rather than by insight, as its nature is perceived by a combination of right reasoning and of false and confused insight. Thus these three essences are different and are discussed separately: the idea is the intelligible form, since it is grasped by pure insight; the temporal form can be perceived by opinion and hence it is 'opinionable', but matter is comprehendable by neither insight nor opinion, because it cannot be perceived in any way by either the intellect or the senses, but it can be suspected -now suspicion is a kind of illegitimate or bastard thinking. NEC CONTENTUS From the conclusion Recte igitur notha ... (370, 16) and the one at the end of par. 347 it is clear that par. 346 and 347 belong together. This observation is useful when one begins to speculate what the lacuna must have contained. It is also very important for a correct understanding of the text that no comma is placed after ratiocinatione (370, 8), as does Wrobel following Fabricius; opinabilem is, in all probability, a rendering of the A'Y)1t't'o\\l in Albinus, and so, to the author's reasoning, must have belonged to the quotation; otherwise Calcidius once again credits Plato with what he did not say, viz., silva est opinabilis (i.e., without the addition of notha ratiocinatione). Remarkable, too, is the use of the term ratiocinatio for ).oyLaμ6i;; however, in 371, 3 Calcidius also uses ratio as an equivalent; this has been translated by 'thinking'. It is not easy to set down the train of thought in this passage, particularly because of the lacuna which occurs at the division between par. 346 and 347. Calcidius clearly explains the concept nothus (notha et adulterina is another doublet). First he narrates the origin of the metaphor: \"They are all known as children but some Philosophia Antigua, VIII 15"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"226 THE TREATISE ON MATTER are called legitimate, others illegitimate. In exactly the same way distinction is made between legitimate and illegitimate ratiocina-tiones\". Of course, Calcidius now explains in what this illegitimacy consists, but here the text is wanting; it begins again in the middle of the explanation. The obvious method is to reason backwards from the conclusion: Recte igitur notha est . . . (370, 16). Why is there a ratiocinatio notha? Because matter is perceived by a way of thinking that is a combination of ratio recta and non rectus confususque intellectus. One already grasps the metaphor Calcidius has in mind: as a bastard is the offspring of an illegitimate connex-ion, so an illegitimate connexion exists between recta ratio and non rectus confususque intellectus in the perception of matter. This leads to the meaning of recta ratio. Calcidius says this previously: Oratio tamen de silva infinitam eam et incertam esse adserens certa est. One can now guess what the lacuna contained: from tamen it is evident that the other element, viz., the non rectus confitsusque intellectus, must have been discussed there. Calcidius no doubt observed that matter is not perceptible by means of the intellect but indirectly by means of the forms that are present in it, so that a vague idea can be obtained, just as the sound of consonants can only be perceived through the vowels. To explain this in a more ordered fashion, one must presume that the lacuna was more extensive than is usually believed. Fa-bricius' enumeration of the content is too short and wrong: J ntercidit sententia qua Chalcidius rationes inter opinionem et rectam rationem intercedentes cum rationibus inter consonantes vocalesqite extantibus comparavit. Furthermore, the trend of thought is so compact that it leaves no room for a new section. The following reconstruct-ion is put forward: After establishing that the Greeks call legitimate children yv~atot and illegitimate ones v66ot, Calcidius must have continued: \"Illegitimate are the children born from an illegitimate connexion-he may also have spoken here of a rectae et non rectae partis consortium. Now, on the one hand, matter is perceived by means of a non rectus et turbidus intellectus, for it cannot be per-ceived in itself but only by means of the fom1s present in it, just as consonants are mute by themselves but make themselves heard in combination with vowels. On the other hand, there is a certa ratio, vi\"z., the statement that matter is unlimited and uncertain. Now the combination of this certa ratio and non rectus et turbidus intellectus constitutes a notha ratiocinatio\". Thus the trend of the"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 346-347 227 argument has become clear; however, the established data are in-sufficient to allow of a Latin restoration of the text. The comparison of the vowels and the consonants is also in Simplicius, In Phys. 523, 24 ss., when discussing the notion of 'space' he says: xoct xoc6' ocu-ro μev oux fo·n ocu-rov vo~aocL, e(m:p 8e &poc, μe:6' &Ttpou &a1t&p TOU~ TWV (X<j)WVWV X<XAouμevou~ q:,66yyou~ • fJ.&TOt ydtp -rou oc o -rou ~ xoct o -rou y 8~,-o~. For mixtae, cp. mixta generatio in par. 269. Oratio is here equivalent with ratio. One wonders whether the latter should be in the text. OPINIONE POTIUS QUAM INTELLECTU CERTO The very opposite statement was made when there was a question of the ideas: intellectu potius quam sensibus (sensus and opinio belong together). The use of opinio in connexion with matter is noteworthy; this word evidently denotes everything that is not intellectus certus, and, therefore, includes what elsewhere is denoted by suspicio. Cp. opinabilem 370, 9, but also the end of par. 347: silva porro neque intellegibile quid neque opinabile, quia neque in-tellectu neque sensu conprehendatur. PRAESUMATUR Cp. 345, 5 (p. 174). CONSORTIO Cp. intellegentiae necessitatisque ... consortium (300, 16). Finally, Calcidius surveys the three genera, which before (354, 12) he had called primae substantiae : 1. idea 2. species nativa 3. silva puro intellectu comprehenditur opinione perceptibilis neque intellectu neque sensu intellegibilis opinabilis suspicabilis It is clear that suspicio is indeed the typical kind of cognition by means of which matter is perceived, viz., notha ratiocinatio, which is the ).oyLaμo~ v66o~ mentioned by Plato, and which Calcidius may have interpreted as Albinus. Naturally this passage of Plato has beer subjected to many speculations; cp. the texts of Plotinus quoted before (p. 224). The list of these three primae substantiae, yevYJ by Plato and genera by Calcidius, raises another question, namely their relationship with the three principles which are generally considered to be the principles of Plato's philosophy, discussed earlier by Calcidius. In the first list (God, matter, exemplar) a marked influence of a systematic interpretation of Plato's philosophy by the school of Aristotle is found. More than once there is an entirely unplatonic line of thought, especially in regard to the ideas (p. 143). Here Calcidius is obliged to follow Plato's thought closely. Plato does not"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"228 THE TREATISE ON MATTER enumerate fully the principles but mentions only those which are important for the subject under discussion; therefore, the ideas come first, next the images, and then matter, whereas God is not mentioned at all. The images, the species secundae, depend on the species primariae, and cannot really belong to the principles. What occupied only a secondary place in Plato (the species secundae), becomes a real principle in Aristotle, viz., the er8oc;. On the other hand, what counts as a real principle in Plato, the t8ifo:, is rejected by Aristotle as superfluous. [348] He continues, penetrating more deeply into the argum-ent which he has started, and says: \"When, then, we con-centrate our attention on it, we experience the same as when we are asleep. For we believe it necessary that everything which exists should be in some place and occupy some space\". When considering the nature of matter, our uncertain and dark state of mind is compared by him to vain dream visions and to an opinion based on the senses. For when we see or touch a body, we cannot avoid perceiving it together with the attending space and place-indeed no body can be perceived without space or site. For this reason Plato says that we are so used to this cus-tomary and widespread opinion that, when considering intelligible things, we <automatically> think that they are in some place and in a certain site, just as the body of the world, which is situated in the space filled up by the mass of the world and occupies the place adorned by the forms of bodies perceived by us, namely matter. Since we see that space and place divide the parts of which it consists, we think that all that exists is similarly in definite spaces and places. And this is why, when someone says that there must be a substance without place and space, a substance existing 'neither on earth nor in heaven', we think that he talks of miraculous things and vain, mental fantasies. For a long time already, nay, from the beginning of our life, a prejudice has been formed in us that everything that exists is corporeal, and that nothing is deprived of an essence subject to the senses, because we trust our senses which are perceivers and, as it were, defenders of what is corporeal. PERGIT ULTERIUS Plato's text runs: 1tpoc; 0 8~ XIXL oveLp07tOAOUfLEV ~A£1tovnc; x,x( ~,xμev cxv,xyx,x'i:ov e!v,x( nou 'tO ov &n,xv lv TLVL -r6mp x,xl"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPHS 348-349 229 xoc:,exov xwp0tv TLvcx (52B). By these words Plato means: when\" looking at matter, we get, as it were, into a state of dreaming (we are under a kind of narcosis) and think that all that exists must needs be in a place\". Likewise he will state: \"nothing exists which is nowhere and, therefore, no reality exists by itself\", i.e., no ideas. What did Calcidius read into this text? The words insistitque probationi coeptae show that, in his opinion, this text is the contin-uation of an argument. In Plato hardly any argument is found at this juncture: he makes a statement, viz., that our customary re-presentation of matter threatens to influence the whole of our thinking. Calcidius wrongly regarded this statement as an argument for the existence of matter. In translating it is already noticable that Calcidius failed to understand Plato's text correctly, for how can putamus enim be an explanation of what goes before? Whereas Plato states that the uncertain and dim perception of matter brings us into a state of dreaming or intoxication, so that we think, etc., Calcidius remarks: \"this perception is compared by Plato to vain dream-images and to an opinion arising from the senses\". Calcidius compares the perception with what in Plato is the result of it. The words et opinioni in particular show the confusion in his inter-pretation. Even in the rest, the meaning of the text is quite dis-torted: to put it briefly, Calcidius identifies the intentio incerta et caligans ( = suspicio) with vana somnia, and these with the opinio. From the last identification one can understand better how in par. 347 he is able to use opinio as a way of knowing matter. ETENIM CUM CORPUS Calcidius now explains this opinio, and in so doing returns onto the right track: he shows that one cannot think of anything without connecting it with space: this is why the res intellegibiles are imagined to be in a place, and why it is surprising to hear that there is a reality which \"does not exist either on earth or in heaven\".

By this 'sleepless and wakeful nature' he denotes"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"230 THE TREATISE ON MATTER the intelligible and incorporeal principle which is always the same and ranks first among all things existing, without origin or end, unchangeable, without any communion with the sensible world, perceptible by the pure spirit, viz., God and His thoughts, the intelligible and incorporeal forms. There are those who deny the existence of these forms, a denial due to their deep slumber. And when somebody wakes them up to a real and by no means somnolent consideration of the eternal and immortal things, they are indignant and take it ill, just as the prisoners in the Republic who are incarcerated in the eternal darkness of the cave, dim with dense shadows. But those who, although with great effort, rescue themselves from their deep ignorance arise from darkness to light and yearn for the clarity of knowledge and truth. They are not annoyed that men of outstanding culture distinguish between sensible and intelligible reality, and that they show their teaching that primary forms are the principle~ of things or that the exemplars are provided with real essence, for these are not made after the example of anything else, because there is nothing prior to the principles. But images of exemplars must, because they are made after exemplars, derive their existence from something else, just as the natural figure of Socrates is, in relation to a statue of him, as it were, its 'primary' form. An image, however, made by the artist's hand and fashioned in accordance with the primary form, will fall short of its definite perfection, if it has no matter-for a picture this is colours, for a statue, clay, bronze and other like materials. Thus, since the sensible forms are also images of the intelligible forms, as we have already often said, and since they derive their existence from the intelligible forms, not only their existence but also their likeness, they need, in my opinion, matter in order to arise in it and acquire existence iu it.

DEUM VIDELICET ET COGITATIONES EIUS Whereas in the last sections Calcidius mentioned regularly the species primariae, etc., as the genus intellegibile, he now suddenly speaks of deum et cogi-tationes eius; one enters in that stage of the interpretation of Plato in which the ideas have become identified with the thoughts of God, and thus are considered the ideal reality. This identification represents Calcidius' own opinion; see 304, 10-12: intellegibilis ... species, quam mundi opifex deus mente concepit, eamque idean cogno-minavit Plato, and other passages concerning the ideas, p. 191. intellegibiles atque incorporeae species, is, therefore, the explanation of cogitationes eius. CONTEMPLATIONEM ... MINIME SOPORATAM Again there is the parallelism between the order of thinking and that of being.Contemplatio minime soporata corresponds to natura pervigil. Calcidius adopts the well-known comparison of the cave-dwellers from the Republic (514A ss.) and again affirms the existence of a species archetypa (cp. 303, 3; 353, 7; 373, 4) which, being a principle, owes its existence to itself. IMAGINES VERO This is a paraphrase of Tim. 52C: w~ e:LXO\\IL fLE\\I • . • SUBSTANTIAM MUTUENTUR This is discussed in par. 344 but more elaborated here: the images (there called species secundae) on the one hand owe their existence to the primary forms, the ideas, but on the other hand need something in which they can subsist. \" ... without matter the image will fall short ot a certa perfectio\"; the formulation is somewhat strange, since perfectio refers to the formal principle alone. Further on Cal-cidius expresses more plainly: in silva species substantiam sortiuntttr, in other words, they get a firm foundation ir matter (see par. 344 with the comment, p. 221).-For the example of Socrates and his image see p. 205, where Seneca takes Vergil as an example. It is inaccurate to consider colours as matter, just as he does with bronze and clay; it would have been more exact to say 'paint'. SICUT SAEPE DIXIMUS Namely in all passages about the species, e.g., par. 273, 302, 304, 307, 337-339. In these sections Calcidius continuously repeats himself.

He states his opinion clearly, and rightly so; for none of the Ancients had thus far observed these three. Most of them thought that there exist only sensible things, as Empedocles; others, that there are only intelligible things, as Parmenides, but no one soever had con-ceived any idea of matter, as he said himself above. By 'that which exists' he wishes to denote the idea or thf' intelligible form, by 'space' matter, and by 'generation' the quantities and qualities and the other sensible shapes. He names 'that which exists', be-cause it exists by itself and, at the same time, causes the existence of other things; 'space', because matter is the receptacle of bodies, qualities and the other sensible things; and 'generation', because these things do not remain for a long time in the same state, but are always succeeding one another.

With goo<l reason he says this, for these qualities do not only become wet and warm, but also dry and cold and whatever of the kind comes to them. \"Under-going the affections inherent in it\", because it receives a form and a figure in consequence of the occurrence of bodies possessing form, for of itself it is impassible and not susceptible to any affection.

This section, too, is almost word for word a repetition of the previous discussion (especially par. 309). The present passage confirms both the interpretation of and the objections to that discussion. [352] Next Plato says: \"Because of itself matter is neither provided with similar powers nor with balanced faculties, nothing is balanced in it\". Now, eliminating as it were God the Maker, he considers mattn twofold, viz., before and after the qualities are received. Before sharing the qualities, matter \"Was, in my opinion, neither at rest nor in motion but had a certain natural ability to receive rest and motion; after taking up the qualities, thus being decorated and made a perfect body by God, it assumed its tasks of motion and rest, in order to fulfil them at various moments. Thus in order to indicate the cause of its motion, he says that \"motion originally arose in matter by the throwing in and the preponderance of the bodies, which lean now to one side now to the other, hut that this motion was still unstable and like a stream\", because unsteady matter, being depressed here ar.d raised there, moved to and fro, and its whole capacity moved in an unbalanced and confused fashion. Thus it happened that most authors thought this disorderly motion to be in the interior of matter itself, proper to it and resulting from the nature, where-as, in fact, it is an impulse from outside; and, besides, they thought it to be animated and living. Thus the occurring motion was foreign, but its confused character and disorderliness came about in accordance with the nature of matter, supplying an unstable and trembling base, since of its own it lacked equal forces or balanced faculties, and since nothing equal in it could restrain the fluctuation and preponderance of the bodies. But as the surface of stagnant water is motionless, until an object of sufficient weight is dropped into it, then there is first only a beginning of motion, but next, when the whole element has got into motion, not only the mass of water is moved but, in its turn, it also moves that which has fallen into it and is the cause of motion, thus in the same way, matter is not only moved in"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 352 235 all kinds of ways when the bodies have caused the first motion, but in its turn it also moves the bodies which cause it.

This text of Plato, which speaks of a 'filling up' of matter and of a 'fluctuation' as its result, leads Calcidius to make a distinction between matter before and after its 'filling up'. Matter is 'filled up' with qualities (later it will be seen how this is understood); but the author of this 'filling up' remains entirely in the dark; this process is considered to be prior to the intervention of God. To begin with Calcidius' translation. It is divided into two: 375, 4-6 and 375, 15-18; actually it is more of a paraphrase than of a translation. According to Cakidius, Plato says that matter of itself (privatim) is unbalanced-this adverb is an addition by Calcidi-us. Explaining the first part of the translation, he says: NUNC IAM VELUTI Actually, God is not mentioned in the whole of this passage: the ideas were the highest principle; however, for him the ideas are the thoughts of God. What he actually intends to say is probably this (see also below): \"we are now considering matter in the stage before the divine intervention\". Cp. ante mundi exor-nationem 377, 19-20. ET ANTE CONSORTIUM This is the condition of matter merely by itself: neque stabat neque mnvebatur. The form-ula reminds one of neque corpus neque incC'rporeum quiddam in par. 319-320. A11d as poss£bilitate corpus et idem possibilitate non corpus was added to this, it may be stated: possibilitate stans et poss1:bilitate se movens, for Calcidius speaks of a naturalis opportunitas ad motus stationisque perceptionem. From what tollows one realizes that Calcidius imagir,es this as a motionl£:ss but easily movable mass: 'motionless' = non movebatitr, 'easily movable' = non stat, that is, it is not a stable something. NATURALIS OPPORTUNITAS Cp. 344, 26 with the comment (p. 173). POST QUALITATUM The text should be studied clorely. It does not say that matter comes to rhare the qualities 01 God, but rather that it was ordered by God after it had come to acquire qualities. This acquisition of qualities takes place before God's intervention, and, for that reason, its cause must remain unknown. Calcidius compares the 'dropping' of qualities into matter with the dropping of a pebble into stagnant water; later on vestiges of fire, water, etc. are dropped into matter;"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"236 THE TREATISE ON MATTER therefore, the qualities here are the vestiges or traces of qualities.

Calcidius remarks that there were men who thought this disorderly motion arose from matter itself. He certainly has in mind Numenius, whose opinion is summed up in par. 297 (326, 15), whereas in par. 301 reference is made to the other Plato interpretation which squares with his own opinion. Thus on this point Calcidius departs from Numenius (see the comment, p. 127). QUOD PRIVATIM A literal quotation (cp. 375, 4-6). SED UT STAGNIS Calcidius gives an image which serves as an explanation of Plato's words: xwouμEVlJV /f ocu 1t<XALV exe°Lvoc O\"&teLv (52E). One is struck by the phrase ex initio corporum sumpto motu: \"after deriving the motion from the beginning which is the bodies\"; corporum must be an explicative genitive: the bodies are the begin-ning of motion. 'Bodies' replace what was hitherto denoted by 'qualities'. Calcidius explains 'bodies' further by speaking of vestigia corporum, 'vestiges of bodies'; see par. 354 (p. 241). VERUM IPSA (sc. silva) Cp. 353, 17: et easdem invicem movet species and 360, 16-17: cum eadem silva intra se movet species. In this parallel passage there is a question of species which is, of course, exactly the same as qitalitates, corpora and vestigia corporum (cp. p. 203). Thus the first motion arose in matter. It was a chaotic movement, caused by the 'dropping' of 'vestiges of bodies', 'qualities' or what-ever they may be called into matter in the same way as a pebble is dropped into water. The addition that matter, in its tum, moves the qualities, has probably been made for the purpose of posing some kind of chain-reaction. It is found, of course, in other Platon-ists, e.g., Albinus, Epit. XII 2: ... cxMywc; 8e: xoct cxμe-rpwc; O\"&LOV't'CX -re niv UAlJV xoct 1tpoc; -rocu't\"r)c; creuSμevoc (sc. -rcx. cr-roLx.e°Loc).

Calcidius says that this motion occurred before the ordering activity of God; but in Albinus these (x.v'rJ are also the result of God's activity.) Thus, this author does not make the distinction between matter as such and matter in disorderly motion. Calcidius, on the other hand, has given chaos a distinctly separate place in the development of things. One"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"PARAGRAPH 353 237 wonders who or what caused this motion or rather so-called drop-ping of the bodies. At the very moment of the first motion and the first phase of the bestowing of forms on matter, Calcidius leaves one in the dark, or rather introduces a new principle, as he did in 353, 13, 354, 19 and 23 (p. 190 and 193), where he suddenly intro-duced a natura. A hint of a distinction as made here may be found in Adv. Hermog. 41. Tcrtullian blames Hermogenes for, on the one hand, ascribing to matter a inconditus et confusus et turbulentus motus, and, on the other, stating that matter has a motus aequalis momenti, which he is said to have explained further by the words moderatio et modestia et iustitia motationis neutram in partem inclinantis. This comes very near to Calcidius. Perhaps Hermogenes made a similar distinction to Calcidius, and therefore Tertullian's reproach is not quite justified. (This may be the interpretation of these noteworthy Tertullian texts; cp. J. H. Waszink, Vig. Christ. 9 (1955), 133.) Once more Calcidius' doctrine takes one back to Middle Platonism. [353] He indicates further that such a motion does not bear upon the coming into existence of things but only upon the change of the bo<lies, for he says: \"owing to this stream, the confused materials were carried in different directions and separated from each other\", i.e., divided. Thus he dearly shows that matter has not one potentiality or ability for the reception of forms but various ones; tor if matter has only one potentiality, it would always be the same thing, but now, because it changes into all qualities and figures, and becomes everything, it is necessary that its potentialities and abilities to various types of change should be understood beforehand. Next he explains by a clear example what he means when he separates the four materials from each other, viz., fire, earth and the others, and states that the cause of this separation is found in the fluctuating motion of matter, \"just as in the cleaning of corn\". We know, indeed, that of old there are certain, what the poets usually call 'weapons of Ceres', whereby that what is reaped is separated; the grains of corn are driven into one direction by moving and shaking, the chaff into another by throwing it up; \"and what is light flies away, what is heavy remains\". \"In this way\", he says, \"these four first bodies are swayed to an fro, as in an eddying strait, and finally 'separated' according to kinds\"; with 'strait' he means matter, with 'separation' the"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"238 THE TREATISE ON MATTER special place allotted by divine Providence to every element. This regulation namely, takes place in order that the confusion and disorderliness arising from the coherence of various materials would not remain, as it had been before the ordering of the world. This, he says, was the condition of the world before the universe acquired splendour and beauty by matter's adornment. TALEM PORRO MOTUM This first motion does not contribute to the coming to existence of anything; its purpose is the separation of the elements. Calcidius refers to Plato's words: TIX oe xtvouμevot oc>J..ot oc).).oae (iel. q>epea6otL ototxptvoμevot (52E). He sticks to the image of fluctus. QUO FACTO Calcidius explains in diversa, and be-ginning with Deinde (line 19) discusses discerni a se. Since the motion of these elements moves in different directions, matter clearly has several potentialities. This statement may seem strong at first sight. One is inclined to think: \"does not the cause of this variety rather lie in the forms, the qualities, otherwise called 'vestiges of bodies'?\" It becomes more intelligible, however, when further on it is seen that these vestigia corporum are in reality nothing else than potentiae rerum (377, 17). Thus the qualitates mentioned by Calcidius become vaguer and vaguer. DEINDE MA-NIFESTO The example is a winnowing basket.

Here he means the provident will of God, whom it pleased first \"to continue the formation of fire, earth and water\" not as they are now but \"scanty vestiges of them\". A vestige of fire is not as yet fire, and the vestiges of the other bodies are not as yet the bodies themselves: a vestige, to be sure, indicates the potentiality of a thing, not the thing itself; and much less the word 'vestige' signifies body. Hence matter wao, thus a vestige of body before the adornment of the world. \"In that squalor and deformity\", he states, \"apparent in that in which divine Provi-dence is wanting\". Rightly so; for what can be beautiful or graceful that is deprived of divine attention? Therefore, since the elements were still orderless and confused, matter in that con-dition was not as yet a cosmos nor beautiful; these only came to it through its capacity of being ordered by Providence. Hence there was the underlying matter with its natural capacity for receiving beauty and gracefulness, and also there were the potentialities or vestiges of the four bodies, which were still confused and not ordert>d. Now, when God wished, he arranged and ordered all this and, by means of figures and qualities, adorned this immortal being, which is the sensible world, in accordance with fixed an<l everlasting considerations. He further orders us to believe that all that is made is made excellent by God's mind and will, and he asserts that nothing is more in accord with truth than this belief.

IN EO, IN QUIT This is again the idea of chaos; it is interesting to see how the ideas of potentiality and of chaos can belong together and even be one and the same thing. On the other hand, a tension arises between them, when in 377, 20 ss. there is first a question of squalor llC deformitas, and further on this same matter is said to be endowed cum naturali opportunitate suscipiendae pulchritudinis ac venustatis. It has already been seen that Calcidius tried to find a solution for this ambiguity by distinguishing two stages in the development of matter, but one feels that he cannot actually maintain this distinction as already seen in the historical part (cp. ad par. 299 and 301, p. 120 and 127). The ultimate reason for this problem is, of course, that Calcidius wrongly interprets the image of chaos as a concrete thing, that is, as a real stage in the development of matter. CUM NATURAL!

The subsequent stage of ordering is the work of divine Providence. The most remarkable point in the attitude of Calcidius is the continuous swaying, as it were, between Plato's concept of chaos and Aristotle's idea of po-tentiality. He believes he has found a way to combine these two fundamentally different concepts by making a distinction be-tween two stages of matter. Even in this combination one notices his wavering, particularly in the second stage, for the concept of potentiality penetrates into the representation of chaos.

Although, properly speaking, Plato had no idea of 'matter', he yet had a twofold concept of that which Aristotle called by this term. First, Plato thought of matter as empty space (x.wpoc). Most philosophers before him had attempted to detect the material from which the world was made by pointing to one or more elements. Plato went much further into this subject. From the constant change of these so-called elements he deduced their dependence upon a single, all-comprising reality, 'that in which everything is'. To him this was space. The prominence given to this category was the result of analyzing thought, though space belongs to the world of observation. Along with this, Plato represents matter as chaos. This concept was very old: the ordered world, the cosmos, inspired the idea of an earlier disorder, out of which order had to rise. Originally, therefore, the chaos is a product of anti-thetical thought. But gradually it captured the imagination and the philosophical concept was developed with details of the visionary and imaginary world. The relation between these two concepts of matter in Plato is probably as Bii.umker suggested, namely that chaos should be taken as a practical illustration or image of space. Thus space and chaos are two terms representing the same reality. Plato's x.wpoc found its continuation in Aristotle's UA1). Aristotle was convinced of this; he himself gives the impression that Plato had already used l)A'YJ for the principle in question. In Aristotle this principle changes from space i u w h i c h ('ro ev cj>) to 'materials out of which' (-ro e~ ou). In elahorating this idea Aristotle's great discovery was the concept of potentiality: when everything comes forth from everything, there must be something underlying. This may become anything but by itself is not yet anything; it is mere potentiality (\"Hypostasierung der Moglichkeit\", Ba limker, p. 253). In the l)A'YJ the x.wpoc lost its image-character and became a purely mental concept. In this way Aristotle gave free scope to his dialectical disposition and posed 'something which by itself is not real but may become everything'."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"244 CONCLUSION The doctrine of the Stoa is adequately expressed by awμcx &1t0Lov. Matter is corporeal, a awμcx. The Stoa does not go all the way with Aristotle; it refused to take matter to be potential in so far as it is corporeal. For the rest, it denies matter all definitiveness and all quality, hence &1t0Lov. The Stoic concept comes nearer to the world of imagination. In this theory the chaos may be taken as something perfectly real. It is in this chaos that Providence created order. Aristotle's doctrine had little room for the idea or rather image of chaos. Calcidius moves away from the Stoa, attacking it at every turn. He rejects completely the corporeality of matter. Moreover, he tries to combine Plato's two concepts of matter in a remarkable way. Space and chaos are two different stages in the evolution of matter; the former is matter as such, the chaos matter put in disorderly motion by 'vestiges of bodies dropped' into it. The concept of space is elaborated in a markedly Aristotelian way. Space is identified with i>A1), with that which is merely potential. Meanwhile, Plato's idea of space appears occasionally. Thus from the very first para-graph of this commentary, the Calcidian silva has the character of both 'space in which' and 'matter out of which'. Retaining, occa-sionally, the Platonic in qua, Calcidius keeps, to some extent, free from the 'merely possible' which, in the long run, cannot be main-tained. Each of the three parts of the treatise reveals in its own way the author's approach to the subject. The introductory paraphrase is marked by a predominance of the concept of chaos, a concept which proves to be no more than a second stage in the evolution of matter. The idea of potentiality prevails in the theoretical part, which introduces a purely dialectic method of arguing borrowed from Aristotle. Calcidius looked up to him as the scholar who gave Plato's ideas a theoretical foundation. In this part he opposes the Stoics in particular. He regards their theory as a cheapening of the pure concept of matter and, for that reason, constantly defends matter as a mere potentiaJity. In the third part, a verifying para-phrase of Plato's text, the Platonic concept of matter as space is naturally prominent. The materialization of the concept of matter which set in after Aristotle found its strongest defender in the Stoa. With the aid of the new dialectics, Calcidius returned to Aristotle's matter. He did his utmost to take away everything definite from matter. Always 'dematerializing' it with Aristotle's potentiality, he"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION 245 virtually made Plato into the real originator of the immaterial con-cept of matter. This idea became deeper in Plotinus who saw matter as the incorporeal background against which reality is set. After six centuries Plato's vision had returned once more in a subtle and discriminating thought. Matter is not the sole topic in the Calcidian De silva. The two other principles of Platonic philosophy, God and the ideas, the latter identical with God's thoughts, are frequently discussed. But nowhere in this commentary are they moulded into a philosophic system. Calcidius studied matter, ideas and God, but they remain apart, and the author failed to see or at least to present them as the three principles of one universe. Typical is paragraph 329 where the threefold verb manet places the principles rigidly side by side and without mutual relationship. The one motion in this system comes from the images of the ideas, from that which, strictly speaking, does not exist. The images alone are the life-lines between these static principles. But no explanation is forth-coming as to how the connections are achieved nor how motion originates in matter. Alongside this system, if one may call it thus, of rational thinking, Calcidius presents another view equally im-portant, built up from the world of imagination: the Demiurge creating the universe as the image of the everlasting reality and the result of his contemplation. The poverty of Calcidius' commentary becomes apparent when compared with the work of Plotinus. Both had the same material of Middle Platonism at their disposal. But the former did not go beyond filling a disorderly storehouse of knowledge where the latter built a new, harmonious and dynamic construction, a considerable advance in the development of ancient thought. No single name can be put forward with certainty as the source of Calcidius' work and several must be ruled out. Plotinus cannot be considered and Calcidius' opposition to the Stoa excludes Posi-donius. Thus the opinions of both Steinheimer and Switalski are discontenanced. Numenius, on the other hand, has come into the foreground after close scrutiny. The starting-point and basis of this discovery is a lengthy verbal quotatior, from which numerous threads led throughout the commentary. Two further weighty arguments appear. First, in his historical survey Calcidius left the"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION discussion of Numenius to the last, thus implying, as was his habit, a special esteem for this particular author. Secondly, his fierce oppos-ition to the Stoa is consistent, step by step, with that of Numeriius. Yet Calcidius did not follow Numenius in everything. He rejected his simple idea of matter as chaos. Instead he admits the two stages of matter as such and matter in disorderly motion, which is chaos. Calcidius states that here he follows other Platonists. One might think, at this juncture, of Albinus from whom Calcidius borrowed much material. For this particular instance, however, the comment-ary does not justify such an assumption. But it is more or less certain that Calcidius shrank from the over-stressed Eastern dualism of Numenius. The two stages in the development of matter, tem-pering this dualism, may well be the result of a more Western, not to say, Christian attitude, already detected in what Tertullian presents as the teaching of Hermogenes. Although this theoretical aversion to Numenius cannot be denied, in practice Calcidius follows him closely. Thus the overall character of Calcidius' commentary is determined by a markedly Numenian approach to different sources which the author himc,elf seems to recall in his introduction. The markedly Aristotelian character of several Calcidian pas-sages appears to support Borghorst's arguments in favour of Adrastus as the main source, particularly since the extensive astronomical and mathematical discussions in the commentary were certainly taken from this author. Much of Aristotle's dialectic material, however, had long since been adopted by the Platonics. This fact alone explains sufficiently the Aristotelica in Calcidius. He may have found them in any of his other sources, Numenius, Albinus or one or another of the Middle Platonists whose name he does not mention; cp. also infra. The study of text and sources of Calcidius' commentary leaves unanswered a final question: how did Calcidius acquire his actual Greek texts? An obvious reply is that he accompanied his bishop, Ossius, to the Near East and there gathered his material. Two main suppositions as to the form this took can be made: I) Calcidius collected separate works of authors, such as Numenius, Albinus, Adrastus, Origen; 2) he found one text based already on a combi-nation of these authors. The first supposition is rejected by most scholars. They do not believe Calcidius capable of compiling an original work. This judgment, however, based solely on the corn-"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION 247 mentary itself, is scarcely more than a petitio ,P,incipii. Moreover, Calcidius seems to refer to a diversity of sources (see p. 13). According to the second, Calcidius translated a single Greek text and added some details for his Latin readers. Although the present author is not inclined to minimize Calcidius' own work, he cannot overlook the facts in favour of this supposition. Who then was the author of such a Greek text? He must have been a Platonist, an author of a commentary on the Timaeus, an admirer of the Aristo-telian way of thinking and a follower of Numenius. The name of Porphyry comes naturally to the fore. He did, in fact, write a com-mentary on the Timaeus, and, moreover, a treatise Ile:pt tJA\"r)<;, which could explain Calcidius' lengthy paragraph on this subject. He too studied the logics of Aristotle and wrote on the categories, providing a possible explanation for Calcidius' Aristotelica and his threefold digression on the categories (par. 226, 319, 336). And lastly, he was accused of transcribing Numenius which might account for the strong Numenian features of Calcidius' work (Proclus, In Tim. I 77, 22-24: ... o cpLMaocpoc; IlopcpupLo<;, 8v xoct 6ocuμ.&.ae:Le:v ocv TL<;, et lnpoc 1.eyoL 't'ljc; N ouμ.\"r)v(ou 1tocpoc86ae:c.>c;). But even if one accepts a Porphyrian commentary as the main source of Calcidius, the results of the foregoing study remain the same: Calcidius' commentary represents a pre-Plotinian stage in the evolution of Platonic thinking. If Porphyry did write a work upon which this Calcidian pre-Plotinian commentary is chiefly based, it must have been a compilation of the kind by no means unusual in Porphyry's work."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRINT The present reprint offers an opportunity for drawing attention to the progress in the Calcidius study and for restating my view-point on the sources of Calcidius' Desilva in the light of new data provided by this progress. A more up to date and fresh approach to its text may thus be welcome. Research into Calcidius' work has developed considerably during the last five years. The name that stands out here is that of Professor J. H. Waszink whose monumental work 1) must be seen as a lasting foundation for any study concerned with the subject. In addition to a critical apparatus, based upon an overwhelming number of manuscripts, it contains an exegetical apparatus revealing the author's extraordinary familiarity with the whole field of ancient philosophy. Moreover, the author's introduction to the text dis-cusses alongside the problems of authorship, of the manuscripts and of the division of the work, that of the sources of Calcidius. Anyone studying this extensive account will appreciate not only the wealth of knowledge and the caution of this search but also that, in many places, Waszink touches upon the study here reprinted and completed 2). Before considering or discussing the questions raised on this point, the following must be stated. Although it is true that the results of my study were available to Waszink as a 1) Timaeus a Calcidio translatus commentarioque instructus. In societatem operis coniuncto P. J. Jensen ed. J. H.

Theiler, Einheit und unbegrenzte Zweiheit van Platon bis Plotin, in I sonomia. Studien zur Gleichheitsvorstellung im griechischen Denken, Berlin, Akad. Verlag, 1964, pp. 89-109. The same author adds a note to his Plotins Schriften, vol. !lib, p. 384 s., which bears upon the explanation of a passage in Calcidius c. 338, referring to a certain Apollonius who is said to have made an ivory statue of Jupiter Capitolinus. At an earlier date already both Theiler (Die Vorbereitung des Neuplatonismus, I3erlin-Ziirich, Weidmann, 19642, p. 17) and Borghorst (sec p. 206) recorded their suspicion that this passage 'romanized' an earlier Greek text, speaking of the statue of Zeus by Phidias."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"CALCIDIUS ON MATTER. HIS DOCTRINE AND SOURCES 249 preparatory work, it is equally obvious that the latter would not have been written in the manner it actually was done without the continual guidance and support of him whose insight into the problems about and around the text by Calcidius is second to none. It is my pleasure to thank him once more for his supervision and assistance. On the question of the sources of Calcidius' De silva, Waszink's opinion agrees, in general, with that defended by me. As his inquiry is concerned with the entire output of Calcidius, it is, obviously, more broadly based. In one point, however, it is also considerably more penetrating and profound, namely on the influence from Porphyry. Towards the end of my study the possibility was put forward, in general terms, that the latter was the principal and direct source of Calcidius. This had to be a Porphyry who was strongly Numenian or, in still more general words, strongly Middle-Platonic, revealing little or no influence of Plotinus 1). Now Waszink presents a minute search as to the influence of Porphyry upon the whole of Calcidius' work 2). In doing so he outlined more clearly the problems of the sources of the chapter De silva. On the basis of the new data thus obtained and of a renewed study of the text on my part, I have arrived at the following con-cepts on this issue. The chapter De silva which consists of three portions (see p. 24)-an introductory paraphrase, an historico-systematic part and a verifying paraphrase-reveals a clear trans-ition stage in cc. 300-301. In these chapters one finds oneself in the second portion, precisely on the dividing line between the historical and the systematical parts. That what precedes these chapters shows clear Numenian features. Starting from the pas-sages immediately preceding (cc. 294-299), in which the teaching of Numenius is discussed in his own words, I was able to point out many places in the previous part (c. 268 ss.) of the commentary 1) In a review of my book E. Mensching (Gnomon 34 (1962), pp. 687-692) appears to have overlooked this explicit restriction. He maintains that my Porphyry-hypothesis is at variance with the part in which, against Stein-heimer, I reject an influence of Plotinus upon Calcidius.-Both Waszink (o.c., p. XC s.) and H.-Ch. Puech (ibid.) admit that Porphyry, indeed, wrote works in which the influence of the Middle-Platonici was greater than that of Plotinus. 2) Waszink continues the search still further in the first volume of his Studien zum Timaeus Kommentar des Calciditts, Leiden, Brill, 1964, in which the first portion of Calcidius' commentary is scrutinized. Aclrastus and Porphyry appear to be the principle sources."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"250 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRINT that were formulated in the same or almost the same wording. One encounters a strongly dualistic doctrine about God and matter, the latter having a dynamic character, just as Numenius 1) is known to have defended. The image of the chaos dominates in this first part of Calcidius' commentary. The part after c. 301 presents a much less dynamic concept of matter in which the Aristotelian idea of the abstract .:Si..YJ dominates, this in its turn being the continuation of the xwpix idea of Plato. It also contains a purely rational approach to matter, a struggling with the (X7tot6't\"Yjc;, just as it is found in such philosophers as Albinus. The influence of Aristotle is also comparatively strong in the treatment of other problems. As for the transition found in cc. 300-301: the former states that there are two ways among Plato's interpreters which merit the attention ;-it should be borne in mind that the Plato interpretation is the subject matter. The first of these is given in c. 300; and it is clearly the one advocated by Numenius. Subsequently and as a confirmation of this interpretation reference is made to the doctrine of the Hebraei (see below). In the next chapter 301 Calcidius gives the second interpretation. This entails that in the chaos, i.e., in the orderlessly moving matter, distinction is to be made between matter as such and its movement. Matter as such is without movement, in the same manner as it is equally without form or order. The orderless movement comes from the elements thrown into matter. (Plato, Timaeus 53A speaks of txv~.) Obviously, the question now arises what about the evil that, according to the opinion cited in c. 300, is inherent in matter (conceived in the sense of orderlessly moving matter). Calcidius answers: M alitiam porro aiunt virlutis esse carentiam (p. 303, 4 Wsz). This means being evil is, according to these authors, some-thing negative. And thus, one may add, there is no reason what-soever for not locating this evil into matter. The correctness of this 1) Numenius' name is often mentioned in this part of my treatise. Yet Mensching (aYt. cit., p. 688) presents a peculiarly inaccurate picture, stating that, ultimately, I adscribe everything to Numenius. On several points of detail I can agree with the reviewer but on that of the 'sources' of Calcidius he, definitely, misrepresents the principal issues of my opinion (see also note 1, p. 249). Indeed, he has already confessed (see Gnomon 37 (1965), p. 33) that, actually, he gave very little attention to the part of my book which treats of Calcidius' doctrine. Yet, this part is, by far, the most important. With regret one must point out that such a manner of reviewing merits no admiration."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"CALCIDIUS ON MATTER. HIS DOCTRINE AND SOURCES 251 interpretation also results from the explanation: ut informitatem, etc., for informitas is 'the' characteristic of matter. Hence, Waszink (o.c., p. XLII and LXXXIX) is, to the best of my knowledge, mistaken in stating that Calcidius rejects the malignitas silvae, while in actual fact he defends in c. 352 s. the opinion given in c. 301, although without speaking of the malignitas silvae. It is true that he rejects the Numenian opinion of malignitas silvae, i.e., the doctrine that evil originates in the indiscriminately moving matter. But he does not reject matter as the source of evil. On the other hand, this interpretation confirms Waszink's belief that Porphyry was the source of Calcidius; for which see below. It must be clear to any student of the subject that these chapters 300-301, especially the latter, are of the utmost importance for identifying the source(s) of Calcidius. For it is quite obvious that after the historical survey the author himself is speaking again. He indicates two ways of Plato interpretation; the first (c. 300) is that by Numenius, who had such a profound influence upon the first portion of the treatise De silva, the second (c. 301) is by an author or authors whose interpretation must be related to some chapters in the second portion (especially cc. 352-353). The immediate question therefore arises: Which interpreters had Cal-cidius in mind for this second way? Waszink has indicated the way here to a new solution. Because of two texts by John Philoponus, De aeternitate mundi VI 14 and XIV 3, he believes to be able to establish that Calcidius, by distinguishing between matter as such and matter brought to orderless movement by the elements, follows in the footsteps of Porphyry 1). One may see this hypothesis confirmed by the fact that the theory propounded in c. 301 is a further development of the Plato interpretation given in the preceding chapter. As the latter presents the concept of Numenius, Porphyry, who lived after him and showed interest in his concepts, seems to be a likely candidat~ for the former. And a further confirmation of the hypothesis lies in the content itself, viz., in the idea of matter being the source of evil. To the authors mentioned in chapter 301-and Calcidius, as said before, reckons 1) It is noteworthy that Proclus, like Calcidius (and Porphyry), disting-uished between matter as such and its orderless movement; De mal. subs.

Yet from the examples cited by Calcidius (p. 303, 4-5 Wsz: ut informitatem, inopiam, intemperantiam) one must not think of this virtutis carentia as only moral evil. My appeal, therefore, to Origen (p. 126) in order to show that this doctrine existed before does not suffise. One should rather search in the direction of Plo-tinus. And Enn. III 8, 3 (see p. 125) offers a very suitable parallel. This virtutis carentia may well be seen as the translation of !JJ..1rnJ1Lc; -rou &.yoc8ou, which is the definition of evil in Enn. III 2, 5 (see p. 125). Thus the text of Calcidius c. 301 could easily be understood in a Plotinian sense 1). Furthermore, it appears a priori likely that this Plotinian concept of matter came to Calcidius via Porphyry. This is not incompatible with the fact that we possess a text by Porphyry suggesting a slightly different idea of matter. In Sent. 20, namely, the uA1J is characterized as OCA1J8Lvov μ~ OV and !JJ..e:LljJLc; 7t<XV't'oc; 't'OU ov-roc; 2). To Plotinus however it is a μ~ ov in the sense of l-re:pov -rou ov-roc;, hence a relative not-being 3); and it is !JJ..e:LljJLc; -rou &.ya8ou rather than 1tav-roc; -rou ov-roc;. Still, it is quite possible that elsewhere Porphyry used a formulation more similar to that of Plotinus. The Porphyry texts cited by Waszink from John Philoponus (p. 251) presuppose already a less negative concept of the iSA1J. In the light of these considerations one may safely accept that in c. 301 Calcidius presents the opinion of Porphyry and hence that the latter was his direct source. And when later on (cc. 302 ss.) a concept of matter occurs that could well be derived from the same Porphyry together with several Aristotelica which, we know, had the same author's attention, the conclusion must be that these chapters (302 ss.) too had Porphyry as their principle source. Waszink ') made an interesting discovery about one of these Aristotelian elements. It concerns the process of knowledge, called resolutio by Calcidius, which is clearly based upon the Aristotelian &.cpaEpe:<nc; (see index, s.v. resolutio). This process is also mentioned in the first Homily on the Hexaemeron by Basil the Great. He states there that, when during the search for the so-called uA'YJ, one mentally takes away the properties of the things, the abstraction does not 1) On Plotinus' concept of matter see Hager, art. cit., p. 85 ss. 2) See Waszink, Studien, p. 51, note 1. 3) See Hager, arl. cit., p. 86. 4) Calcidius, p.

Although this resolutio also occurs in Albinus and Numenius (see p. 50), the explicit quotation of Porphyry in the scholion renders the text exceptionally important and interesting; it strengthens the probability that Porphyry here was Calcidius' source 1). For c. 300 and those preceding the following argument appears rather obvious. As this portion has a strong Numenian flavour and Porphyry is known to have been much influenced by Numenius (seep. 247), the former was also the principle direct source of this part of Calcidius' commentary. Waszink, indeed, accepts this view but makes an exception for the passage in which the doctrine of the Hebraei is cited as confirming the Numenian interpretation of Plato's doctrine. To him the manner in which this doctrine is dis-cussed seems to be incompatible with Porphyry's attitude towards the Jews. And as Numenius is known to have been favourably inclined towards the Jews, these Hebraica fit well into a text by Numenius. Waszink's interpretation, however, has a peculiar implication. For, in these circumstances, Calcidius would have taken the Numenian elements from Porphyry, except for these Hebraica which he took directly from Numenius. This is scarcely acceptable. If the latter, as they stand in Calcidius, cannot come from Porphyry and, consequently, must have been taken directly from Numenius, we must, I believe, also agree that the former, the Numeniana, were derived from Numenius himself, this means, we must regard Numenius to be the direct source of both the cc. 295-299 and the influence the Numeniana had upon the preceding portion of Desilva. There seems to be one difficulty against this supposition. It compels us to accept that Calcidius abolished here his custom-ary method of never mentioning his immediate spokesman; for, in fact, Numenius 'name occurs five times in the cc. 295-299. Waszink regards this feature as decisively against the acceptance 1) It is doubtful, however, whether one may take it that Porphyry, like Basil, believed the application of this &.cpoclpe:cn~ 'to lead to nothing'. Strictly speaking the text only establishes that Porphyry also applied this technique (-rou-r<J> -rcj> cmxe:tpiiμoc-rt). Even though a text such as Sent. 20 seems to suggest a similar conclusion, because of what has been said above great care should be taken against generalisation."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"254 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRINT of Numenius as the direct source of these chapters 1). Still, this kind of reasoning is rather dangerous. Waszink himself is obliged to make an exception for Origen. There would have been a special cause for explicitly naming this immediate source, the fact namely that Calcidius was a Christian. But could there not have been an equally special reason for mentioning Numenius? In point of fact, his name occurs exclusively in the historical survey, notably in the discussion of the teaching of the Pythagoreans. Is one not allowed to suggest that, as so little was (and is) known of Pythagoras himself, Numenius was, at least to Calcidius, the Pythagorean par excellence and that, in this particular instance, he wished to cite his name in the same manner as he did earlier on those of Aristotle, Zeno and Chrysippus? Outside this historical passage, i.e., in those places where Calcidius speaks for himself, the name of Numenius is notably absent. And this is at once note-worthy in c. 300. For here, immediately after discussing Numenius' doctrine (cc. 295-299), the same is again mentioned yet without a name. Thus, to me, it does not seem to be so impossible that Numenius is the principal and direct source of the first portion of De silva; Porphyry can only be reasonably accepted as Calcidius' spokesman here when the H ebraica are his too. If the latter is not acceptable 2), one must suppose that in c. 301 Calcidius changes, so to speak, from the authority of Numenius to that of Porphyry. But no obvious reason for such an action has as yet been suggested. Still, whatever opinion one follows, in either it must be taken that in cc. 295-299 we are dealing with pure Numeniana 3). Chapter 300 is not the only place where the doctrine of the Jews is quoted at the end of an historical survey and as a confirmation of a certain point of view. The same happens in c. 55. As it occurs here too in a Numenian context and, moreover, the problems in both cases show great similarity, it seems worlhwile considering the questions concerning this subject matter.

This text is found at the end of a discourse on the origin of the (world) soul, in which, especially, Plato's well-known passage on the mixing of this soul (Tim. 35A) drew Calcidius' attention. In the chapters with which we are concerned here (cc. 29-31 and 54-55), he discusses the question of how to understand the indivis-ible and divisible oucr(oc which the Demiurg uses at this mixing. According to one opinion the two oucrtocL indicate the species intel-legibilis mundi and matter. According to another the indivisible oucr(oc stands for a anima eminentior, quae nulli sit incorporationi obnoxia, a higher kind of soul which, therefore, never has to descend into a body. With the divisible oucr(oc is meant the anima stirpea which contributes the powers of life to plants and animals 1). To confirm the correctness of the latter opinion reference is made to the doctrine of the Jews; the terms vita and ratio are here the core of the matter. There are three obvious reasons for suspecting the influence of Numenius in this passage: a) Numenius himself speaks of two souls; b) the terminology is similar to that of N umenius; c) the confirming Jewish doctrine is brought in here as well as in c. 300 where Numenian teaching is patent. One might object that there are also differences between the two passages. For in cc. 295-299, the obviously Numenian passage, and in c. 300, in which his opinion is, again, outlined and the Jewish doctrine cited in confirmation, the points at issue are the good and evil souls; the serpent, according to those Hebraei, illustrates this evil. In c. 55, however, the evil soul does not seem to come up for discussion; the anima stirpea, here termed as vita, has not the character of an evil soul. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the text just quoted is followed by: Et ratio dei deus est humanis rebus consulens, quae causa est hominibus bene beateque vivendi, si non concessum sibi munus summo a deo neglegant (p. 103, 7-9 Wsz). 1) One thinks here, on the one hand, of the vouc; of Plato, on the other of the anima as the principle of life."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"256 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRINT No explanation is given for the origin of this neglegere, of this neglecting. Yet an opposition to the ratio principle is also patent in this text. And below it will become obvious that the seemingly quiet anima stirpea in c. 31 is suddenly given a restless character, precisely in the passage that strongly reminds one of Numenius. According to those referred to in c. 31 as defending the doctrine of the dual soul, the Demiurg, taking that excellent soul, joined it with the anima stirpea to make, in this manner, a bodily creature gifted with reason, that could understand the wonders of the creation and glorify the Creator (see p. 79, 19-23 Wsz). But, the opponents say, how is it possible that a anima stirpea existed before there were any plants etc. ? The answer is: the objection pre-supposes that there was a time when the anima stirpea did not exist but was later created by God. This is incorrect. For to create, indeed, means to order what was orderless rather than to make out of nothing 1). Fuisse enim semper tam animae quam corporis vim nee deum ex his quae non erant fecisse mundum, sed ea quae erant sine ordine ac modo ordinasse (p. 80, 20 - 81, 1 Wsz). Then Calcidius continues thus: itaque potius ea quae existebant exornasse quam generasse quae non erant, inordinatos quippe animi errores et agitatio-nem fluctibus similem intellectu assignato ex inordinata iactatione ad ordinem redegisse, corporis etiam motum instabilem salubri modera-taque agitatione frenasse et eidem f ormam et figuram congruam et convenientem ornatum dedisse (p. 81, 1-6 Wsz). This description strongly reminds one of the Numenian passage (see Waszink, Calcidius, p. XLIX). The anima stirpea has here obtained all the 1) The ease with which Calcidius, here and elsewhere, dismisses the creatio ex nihilo and accepts an eternal matter alongside God remains one of the great problems in his work. It is as though he totally failed to realize that this was a controversial issue of the first order between the official doctrine of the Christian Church on the one hand and a number of philo-sophers and heretics on the other. In this connection it may suffice to mention Tertullian's fierce opposition to the gnostic Hermogenes who came very near to the 'pagan' idea. Calcidius' attitude strikes one the more so, when it is borne in mind that even Neo-Platonici gradually developed a monism which, e.g., in Proclus, took the form of creatianism. In rem publ.

If then one has to accept an influence of Porphyry in Calcidius, and this seems to be the case, the work of the former must also have propounded a different opinion. In actual fact, earlier on we were brought to such a supposition (see p. 252)."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"CALCIDIUS ON MATTER. HIS DOCTRINE AND SOURCES 257 features of the orderlessly moving anima silvae of Numenius. When, therefore, we observe how this idea is being confirmed by the teaching of the Jews, just as in c. 300, the obvious conclusion must be that we are dealing with a Numenian piece of writing. And, if one must accept that Porphyry could not have cited this teaching, the only way open is to infer that here too Calcidius took both the Numeniana and the Hebraica directly from Numenius. There still is the article by Beutler 1) which I failed to quote when discussing the cc. 295-299. He argues that these cc. 31, 54-55 were derived from Plutarch rather than from Numenius. Waszink rightly protested against this (Calcidius, p. L-LIII). To his criticism a few remarks may be added. After having agreed with Beutler's statement that the teaching of these two philosophers show many points of contact, Waszink presses the matter of the divergences. To Numenius, he says, silva and silvae anima are the same, this being the reason why he does not distinguish between matter and its orderless movement. Plutarch, on the other hand, does so. To him matter as such is without quality (ix1t0Loc:;); it has no movement, since this is something of a soul. Hence the orderless movement of matter can only be explained through an (orderless) soul in matter; this soul also is the origin of the evil. Waszink's conclusion that, therefore, the doctrine of Numenius and Plutarch differ appears to be correct. But now one may also ask: what is the relationship between Plutarch and Calcidius? The latter too, in c. 301 ss., distinguishes between matter as such and its orderless movement, thus dissociat-ing himself from Numenius. Does he now follow Plutarch? The answer must be to the negative, for Plutarch seeks the source of evil in the orderless movement of matter, Calcidius however in matter itself (evil indeed is virtutis carentia). Nevertheless, it must be emphatically stressed that the departure from Numenius' teaching is not at all noticeable in the cc. 31 and 54-55. And Waszink is quite right in assuming an influence of Numenius, in this particular instance, rather than of Plutarch. When, however, he states that the text Fuisse enim semper tam animae quam corporis vim is incompatible with Plutarch's teaching, because he defends a creation of the cosmos in time-in the sense that fuisse ... semper would have no place in Plutarch-1 feel this 1) Numenius, P.W.

To Plutarch the cosmos has, indeed, its origin in time, but the cxxo<r!J.tex, the core of our text, has not. Waszink himself quotes (p.

One would rather prefer to see Calcidius' subsequent distinction between animi errores and motus instabilis corporis, both of which must be arranged and ordered, as unconformable with Plutarch. For every movement, to him, is something belonging to a soul. If, therefore, the animi errores-obviously identical with 'irregular movement' -are here discussed first, what then is the meaning of those motuo; corporis? M otus indeed is something of a soul. To Plutarch there is cxxo<r!J.LIX in the body before it is fashioned to order. But this consists of being without form and order; and there is no question here of movement. Only for the soul the cxxo<r!J.Cex lies in the orderless movement. Plutarch is most definite on this in De animae procreatione in Timaeo 1014B: cxxo<r!J.LIX yocp ~v TOC 1tpo 'Tljc; Tou x6<r!J.OU L ' ( ~' ' ' , '~' ' , '~' .l!,J, ,-, '>' ye:vi:;<re:wc; • exxO<rfL ex O oux IX<JWfJ.IXTOc; ouo IXXLV1)TOc; ouo t,;'t'UX.Oc; IXI\\I\\ &!J.opcpov fLEV XIXL CX<JU<JTIXTOV TO <JWfLIXTLXOV ~fL7tA1)XTOV 8e xext !).oyov TO XLV1)TLXOV ~x.ou<rex· TOUTO 8' ~v cxvexpfLO<rT(ex ljiux_~c; oux ex_oU<r1)c; ).6yov (ed. Hubert, p. 148, 13-18). Still, since in the text just quoted from De Is. et Os. Plutarch speaks of a 8uvexfLtc; in the soul and in the body, one should be warned against asserting on too flimsy evidence that this or that does not fit into Porphyry's b~aching. One may more safely defend that among philosophers supporting a strongly dualistic system, obviously, a great number of possibilities exists of agreement and similarity of expression 1). This does not alter the fact that Calcidius should here be judged as being dependent upon Numenius, though for other considerations explained above. 1) It has been said already that Calcidius follows a less dualistic theory in c. 301 ss. On p. 246 I suggested that he did so because of his Christian conviction. In view of his attitude towards the problem of creation this seems to be untenable. It should rather be ascribed to the influence of Porphyry."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"CALCIDIUS ON MATTER. HIS DOCTRINE AND SOURCES 259 Finally, Waszink asks himself whether perhaps the other inter-pretation of the indivisible and divisible ouofa, cited by Calcidius, comes from Plutarch. In this concept the indivisible oua(oc stands for the species intellegibilis mundi, the indivisible oua(oc for matter 1). To confirm this he quotes De an. procr. 1022E: <To fLEV OCfL&pLa't'ov xoct &eb )((X't'(X 't'OCU't'CX fx.ov we; fLOpi:p~v xoct d8oc;, 't'O 8e 1tept 't'CX (JCilfLOC't'OC yLyv6fLevov fLEpLaTov we; 1'.mo8ox~v xoct UAYJV.

These remarks on details should not obscure the principal fact that I fully agree with Waszink's final conclusion 2). 1) Waszink, Calcidius, p.
