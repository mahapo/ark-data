Over many centuries, Neoplatonism, based now inAlexandria, now in Athens, associated itself with a fixed textual tra-dition - the corpus of Plato's dialogues and the exegetical traditionassociated with it - despite or perhaps even because of this temporaland geographic breadth. And yet more than the adherants of anyother ancient philosophical lineage the Neoplatonists insisted thatwisdom could be located only outside all texts and outside all lan-guage.Why were the Neoplatonists, who explored so intensively non-discursive or non-propositional thinking, and who subjected formaldialectic to such criticism, exegetical beyond all other schools ofancient philosophy? And how does their suspicion of discursivethinking manifest itself in their texts? Working with the texts ofPlotinus, Proclus, Damascius, and others, I show how lack of confi-dence in discursive argument shaped the textual strategies availableto these authors. These texts often appropriate elements from ritual,repeatedly investigate the limits of discursive thinking, and try toillustrate how non-discursive thinking is supposed to work. We findtexts that are at odds with their own textuality, discourses that denythat anything has been asserted, and discursive strategies that setthemselves against their very discursivity. What are the issues thatshaped the very distinctive textual practices reflected in the Neopla-tonic tradition?1On the concept of textuality, see Silverman, Textualities, chap. 8, \"The Language ofTextuality.\" See also Paul Ricoeur, \"Qu'est-ce qu'un texte?\" in Hermeneutik undIX"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Preface: Discursive Strategies and Neoplatonic TextsIn the following passages, two representatives of the Platonic tra-dition discuss the origins of writing, framing written language assomehow exotic or extopic, as non-native to the realms of truth andmemory that writing appropriates to itself. For Plato, Egypt teachesthe naive and untutored Greece to engage in a process of externali-zation by creating an artificial memory.2 For Plotinus, Greece isderivative and mimetic, inventing philosophy as a science of repre-sentations that coincides with the deployment of written language.3Socrates: The story is that in the region of Naucratis in Egypt there dwelt oneof the old gods of the country, the god to whom the bird called Ibis is sacred,his own name being Theuth. He it was that invented number and calcula-tion, geometry and astronomy, not to speak of draughts and dice, and aboveall writing. Now the king of the whole country at that time was Thamus .. .To him came Theuth, and revealed his arts, saying that they ought to bepassed on to the Egyptians in general. . . \"Here, O king, is a branch oflearning that will make the people of Egypt wiser and improve their memo-ries ...\"The king answered and said, \"O man full of arts,. . . if men learn this, itwill implant forgetfulness in their souls; they will cease to exercise memorybecause they rely on that which is written, calling things to remembrance nolonger from within themselves, but by means of external marks.\"4 (Phaedrusa, with omissions)Dialektik: Festschrift fur Hans-Georg Gadamer, II, 181-200. Finally, see Gasche, The Tainof the Mirror, chap. 12, \"The Inscription of Universality,\" especially p. 280: \"Inwhatever terms - empirical, idealist, or dialectical - text is denned, it always impliesa closure upon itself with a clear inside and outside, whether it is the empiricalclosure of the unity of a corpus, the intelligible unity of a work, or the dialecticaltotality of its formal or thematic meanings.\" Here Gasche articulates a theory oftextuality that I would claim does not actually apply in Neoplatonic texts. Becausethese texts are premised on the condition that non-discursive thinking can never beformulated discursively, their textuality can no longer be considered primarily ref-erential; the text as a discursive formulation is incommensurate with the theory ofmeaning on which a referential notion of textuality would rely. Hence the defect ofself-enclosure, seemingly detected in postmodern critiques of textuality, is not nec-essarily a feature of Neoplatonic texts.For the notion of artificial memory, see Yates, The Art of Memory, especially chap. 2,\"The Art of Memory in Greece: Memory and the Soul.\" See also Havelock, The MuseLearns to Write.

(EnneadsV.8.6)5I have juxtaposed the two texts so as to invent a dialogue betweenthese two philosophers on the genealogy of textuality. Both passageslament a fall from innocence occasioned by writing and acknowledgethe priority of spoken over written signs (Plotinus says that letters\"imitate sounds\"). Yet Plotinus seems to be recalling a unitary signthat fully reflected the wholeness of its object, a grammar withoutsyntax that communicated the unabridged nature of what it de-scribed, whereas Plato recalls a form of interior memory that wasable to forgo any kind of semiotic mnemonics, a self-recollectionthat disdained any record of itself.If Plato and Plotinus could have engaged in a dialogue about thelimitations of writing, what would each have said to the other? In thepassages just quoted, one complaint seems salient - writing fails tocapture certain features of what we might now call the subject ofdiscourse. According to Plato, writing externalizes memory with theundesirable result that consciousness appears to fail to include itsown contents. According to Plotinus, writing temporalizes the spaceof consciousness and translates the simultaneously present contentsof consciousness as an extension within time.Finally, however, both texts reveal themselves as part of a history,a temporally extended record of ideas that now inexorably form partof a textual tradition. These passages show us a tradition that is fullyalive to the paradoxes of its own occurrence. What exactly is a phil-osophical tradition? Is its purpose to transmit texts, to authorizecertain dogmas, or to communicate some kind of wisdom? Iftraditions are here to transmit texts, then what constitutes a text?5 Armstrong's translation.XI"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Preface: Discursive Strategies and Neoplatonic TextsWhat kinds of practices are involved in the creation of a specificallyNeoplatonic textuality? We find, for example, Proclus writing in hisCommentary on the Timaeus:And this is what theurgy reveals after Plato by means of the letters, namelytheurgy fills the soul with the magical sign of the chiasma and the semi-circles. Thus names and magical signs were first transmitted by Plato to us.(7TII 255-256)Proclus is discussing Timaeus 36c 1, the creation of the world soulfrom two strips consisting of compounds mixed out of Being andBecoming. The X of the world soul is a form of writing practiced bythe Demiurge, while human beings imitate this divine inscription bymeans of magic rituals.6 Here writing arrogates to itself an authoritythat belonged to the realm of the divine, and the text is woven outof signs that supersede the system of writing. Proclus interprets thistext by attempting to reconstruct the talismanic force of the signsthat are somehow disguised by writing. Again, Proclus' historical spinon the origins of his own tradition is instructive:All of Greek theology is the child of Orphic mystagogy: Pythagoras was thefirst to receive initiation from Aglaophamos, Plato in turn received from thePythagorean and Orphic doctrines perfect knowledge concerning the gods.(Proclus PT 1.5, 25-26)According to Proclus, then, what is authentic in the tradition ofwhich he himself is a member is not the body of writings that fallsunder the authorship of Plato. In the one case, the Timaeus text isshaped around the letter chi, a symbol whose efficacy involves asupernatural force not normally accorded to human writing. In thesecond case, the doctrines of Plato originate from a supernaturalsource in the revelations of Apollo, so that authorship is really sub-sidiary to the whole question of tradition. These two texts are onlyexamples of the complex pragmatics of Neoplatonic textuality. Byappealing to the ritual force of language and by deferring the loca-tion of authorship, these particular passages raise questions aboutthe very nature of language and meaning, questions that have to beaddressed as a part of the process of reading Neoplatonic texts.Hence the purpose of this book is to pose questions about how toOn this passage and on Proclus' theory of Demiurgic inscription, see Gersh, FromIamblichus to Eriugena, pp. 297-9.Xll"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Preface: Discursive Strategies and Neoplatonic Textsread the texts of the Neoplatonic tradition. Over the next severalchapters, I will be looking closely at the Neoplatonic treatment oflanguage, metaphor, image, and text. I will be looking at the rela-tionship between text and tradition and especially at the dialecticalelements found within Neoplatonic texts. In the first part of thebook, \"Language in the Enneads,\" I discuss the textual strategies ofthe Enneads. Here I explore the parameters of discourse in theEnneads by examining its systems of organizing language: method,metaphor, and dialectic. In the book's second part, 'Text and Tra-dition in Neoplatonism,\" I explore the textual practices of differentadherents of the tradition and attempt to chart a history of Neopla-tonic textuality.The paradoxes of claiming that Neoplatonists avail themselves ofdiscursive strategies in their attempts to avert the limitations of thediscursive should by now be apparent. One of the claims that I makethroughout this book is that Neoplatonic texts exhibit a self-consciousness about the methodologies that they employ preciselybecause of the difficulties caused by Neoplatonic notions of truth,philosophy, and tradition. Beyond any formal criterion shaping thetradition, Neoplatonists shared the belief that wisdom could not beexpressed or transmitted by rational thought or language. Yet de-spite this repudiation of the discursive, their texts also possess acomplex doctrinal content that operates in conjunction with thesereservations. In fact, for Neoplatonists, there is one central meta-physical fact that grounds this attention to the non-discursive.The identity theory of truth, the doctrine that intellect is its ob-jects, and the self-disclosing nature of intellectual activity are at thecenter of Neoplatonic philosophizing and dialectic.7 This theory oftruth is notoriously difficult to demonstrate, and even if the Neopla-tonists at times attempt to do so, they leave the central premise ofIn using the expression \"identity theory of truth,\" I do not intend to imply that theNeoplatonists formulated such a doctrine merely as a theory or hypothesis explain-ing the nature of truth in dialectical contexts. Admittedly, the phrase \"identitytheory of truth\" is probably ambiguous: Aristotle holds a theory that could be calledan identity theory, but the Aristotelian version of the identity thesis is considerablydifferent. Some of these differences are discussed in later chapters. On this topic,see Emilsson 1996, pp. 238-9. Emilsson refers to what I have been calling the\"identity theory\" as the \"Internality Thesis.\" That said, it must be acknowledgedthat Plotinus does deploy this doctrine against Stoic or Stoicizing epistemology inEnneadsV.v, and V.5, where he explores the nature of Intellect's incorrigibility.Xlll"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Preface: Discursive Strategies and Neoplatonic Textsthis theory, that is, the existence of a faculty that incorrigibly graspseternal truths, unargued for.8 Surely such a conception of truth -truth that by definition cannot be communicated to another be-cause any representation would rupture the unity of subject andobject entailed by it - leaves the enterprise of philosophy in a predic-ament that can be solved only by paradox, compromise, or self-contradiction.Nous, the faculty of intellectual intuition, functions in the texts ofthe Neoplatonists in terms of self-presence and immediacy; it enjoysa proximity to the truth that crosses over into self-encapsulationbecause intellect makes its own contents known to itself alone.9 Butwhat kind of language can be used to convey the truth that thisfaculty grasps? If the answer is that the language of nous must bemetaphorical, it must be remembered that both conceptual andmetaphorical representations fall short of its intuitions. This resultmay only confirm postmodern suspicions of philosophy when it at-tempts to appropriate or to authorize metaphor for its own construc-tions.10See Gerson, Plotinus, pp. 42-3, on the history of nous in Greek philosophy as afaculty whose \"contents are universal truths.\" Gerson argues that one of the sourcesfor Plotinus' doctrine of intellect is a traditional faculty psychology \"that is largelyunopposed within Greek philosophy.\" Strictly speaking, Plotinus departs from thepsychological tradition in asserting that intellect \"does not belong to the soul,though we can say that it is 'our' intellect, since it is distinct from the faculty thatthinks discursively because it transcends [discursive thinking], but nevertheless it isours, even if we do not count it among the faculties of the soul\" (V.3.23-27).Although Plotinus does not proscribe language that describes the intellect as be-longing to the person, he makes it clear that it cannot be attributed to the individ-ual. There is no condition of the individual mind as such that operates as a guar-antor for the apprehension of universal truth.Enneads V.5.2.18—20: WOTE KCXL f| OVTCOC; aXf|0eia oti cu^KpcovoCoa aXXw aXX' ecmTr), KCXIoti&ev Jtap' af)TT]v aXko \"kkyei, <aX,X,' o A-eyei), KCXI ecru, KCU 6 eon, TOUTO KCIL Xeyei.

Cf.V.3.6.24: \"If intellect should be what it says, it would know itself exactly like this.\"On this self-communicating aspect of Intellect, see Emilsson 1996, pp. 237-8.1 I have in mind something like the following objection to the language of meta-physics, an objection that I do not share or endorse, but believe might profitably beaddressed: \"Henceforth the entire teleology of meaning, which constructs thephilosophical concept of metaphor, coordinates metaphor with the manifestationof truth, with the production of truth as presence without veil, with the reappro-priation of a full language without syntax\" (Derrida 1982, p. 270).Derrida suggests that the Platonic tradition produces, by means of metaphor,XIV"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Preface: Discursive Strategies and Neoplatonic TextsIf language is premised on the notion of a self-enclosing truth,then meaning itself risks losing its force. All statements about truthbecome metaphors or tropes because literal meaning has been pro-scribed from the outset as not available. To this objection to orwarning about the role of metaphor within philosophy as an attemptto evade the question of meaning, one can only reply that the Neo-platonists refused to grant that truth could ever be fully disclosed;truth is itself a veil for an origin that falls outside of all representa-tion. The chapters that follow detail and chronicle the texts andtradition that embody this paradox of meaning. The discursive strat-egies that inform Neoplatonic texts are a configuration of non-discursive truth, just as the tradition as a whole is a record of its ownappeal to what can only be called an unwritten tradition.In Chapters 6 and 7 I document the significance of this appeal byshowing how the Neoplatonists elaborate classical allusions to enig-matic traditions, to Orphics and Pythagoreans, to infamous lectures,and to obscure numerology. As we shall see, from the Neoplatonicperspective the superordinate position of Pythagoras over Plato inthe historiography of Platonism is precisely informed by this notionof unwritten traditions. When seen in this light, the so-called oral-teachings hypothesis about Plato becomes part of a more elaborateyet ultimately consistent view of textuality within the Neoplatonictradition.11 Before turning to this tradition, I want to discuss morethe notion of a truth that is immediately present, a meaning not circumscribed bylanguage, but one that has in reality no existence outside of metaphor. This chal-lenge, how does language convey truth as self-presence, and how does the textcreate the illusion that this ambition is achievable, is a real concern and one thatthis book seeks to address. I do not see Neoplatonism as promulgating this notionof textually inscribed self-presence. Rather, my purpose in this book is to show thatcertain texts reflect or document the efforts of members of this tradition to achievea kind of self-presence or self-knowledge that is precisely extra-linguistic, though itthen becomes subject to linguistic description.In this book, I do not discuss the \"esoteric doctrines\" of Plato in terms of thehistorical validity of this concept. Readers interested in the \"esoteric Plato\" shouldconsult the following works: Brisson 1995a; Findlay; Gaiser; Kraemer 1959; Kraemer1990; Reale; and Schleiermacher.One of the objections I have concerning the \"esoteric interpretation\" of Plato'sdialogues, and a fortiori, of attempts to invoke Neoplatonic confirmation of thisinterpretation, concerns the notion of doctrine, teaching, or dogmatic formulation.If by imputing \"unwritten doctrines\" to Plato, the esotericist interpretation seeksto read Plato in the terms of an ontology that more closely resembles Neoplatonismbecause it includes such \"unwritten principles\" as the One (which would functionXV"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Preface: Discursive Strategies and Neoplatonic Textsprecisely the nature of Neoplatonic objections to discursive thinkingor discursive arguments. The nature of this discussion is partiallyexclusive - we need to see the limitations of discursive thinking thatthe Neoplatonists worked so hard to overcome within those textualpractices that came to be included in their works, many of which willstrike the modern reader as bizarre, naive, even absurd. When Ploti-nus tells us that wisdom does not consist of propositions or state-ments or that truth is by nature non-representational, how big a leapis it from his remarks to a textuality that invokes theurgy, or to onethat prefers Orphic cosmology to traditional metaphysics? I will tryto demonstrate the intelligibility of the surprising forms that Neopla-tonic textuality took, by insisting that we take the claims of theNeoplatonists to invoke non-discursive truth as foundational to theirphilosophical enterprise.Finally, I must address what might be the most telling objectionto the approach to Neoplatonic textuality that I am proposing toadopt in the following pages. Proclus wrote exegetical commentarieson many of the Platonic dialogues, as did the sixth-century scholarchDamascius. Moreover, it is clear that Plotinus adopts a scholasticapproach in the majority of his treatises, arguing in detail againstStoic and Aristotelian category metaphysics, to take one prominentexample. Why does this discursive form of philosophy preponderatein Neoplatonic texts if Neoplatonic textuality so readily accedes tothe non-discursive? Here it must be said that the historical situationof Neoplatonism, a tradition that lasted for well over three centuriesand that claimed to transmit the Platonic philosophy initiated amillennium before the appearance of its last exponent, Damascius,demanded a scrupulous adherence to the texts that informed it. Inany event, rather than argue the merits of my approach from aperspective that surveys the sheer numbers of arguments and exege-sis, it is perhaps just as useful to admit that the texts presented inthis book could be exceptional. They presuppose a scholasticismwithout which their visionary flights, aporetic repetitions, or ritualas a first cause), then this so-called Neoplatonic interpretation omits a crucial aspectof the Neoplatonists' own understanding of their tradition. In this book, I explainthe Neoplatonic concept of unwritten teaching in terms of the philosophical askesisor practice of non-discursive modes of awareness.

Representing a Tradition:Exegesis, Symbol, and Self-reflectionReading Neoplatonism touches on issues as diverse as Plotinus' critiqueof essentialism and Proclus' references to theurgy. What brings thesestrands of thought together, and how can a scholar justify tracingthese disparate phenomena back to a single source? In this book, Iclaim that the wide variety of textual strategies we find in the Neopla-tonic tradition arises largely as a means of circumventing the hesti-tations that the tradition as a whole has about discursive thinking.There is a diachronic movement to the book: I begin at the start ofthe Neoplatonic tradition and end with the last Platonic successor,Damascius.What makes Neoplatonism a unified tradition, and what kinds ofresources enabled Neoplatonists to maintain the continuity of thistradition? Formally, Neoplatonists remained allied over the accep-tance of Plato's dialogues as constituting something like a founda-tional discourse. Yet obviously there is a great deal more to thetradition that brought about its cohesion, above all its metaphysicalstructures and its associations with pagan religiosity. In short, Neo-platonism was a textual tradition as well as a living school; its adher-ents practiced a minority religion that struggled to define and main-tain itself against an increasingly intolerant mainstream ideology.But if the Neoplatonists rely on the writings of Plato for theirmetaphysical enterprise, the central feature of this enterprise is nev-ertheless its insistence on the faculty of intuition, nous, for the truthof its deliverances. Therefore, the Neoplatonists faced issues verymuch like our own as they continued to identify themselves withtheir philosophical tradition.

Representing a Tradition: Exegesis, Symbol, and Self-reflectionwithin the context of a philosophy that repudiates language butcontinues to practice speculative metaphysics? Linguistic theory wasjust as significant for the Neoplatonists as it is for modern philoso-phers, as they worked with such issues as the origins of significationand designation and the problematics of translation.1 Finally, theNeoplatonists were confronted as we are with an amazing history ofcompeting philosophical schools, with an eclectic scholasticismformed and reformulated throughout the centuries of theorizingthat preceded them.Yet there are factors that show up in virtually any Neoplatonisttext, factors that help us to gauge a text's distance from our ownmodern way of conducting philosophical discourse. I have attemptedto identify as one such factor the Neoplatonic insistence on thelimitations of discursive thinking and, therefore, on the textual con-veyance of non-discursive methodologies. To be sure, due to currentresearch in this area, no scholar would now dispute that there is astrong doctrinal component to Neoplatonist metaphysics and thatPlotinus, above all, argues cogently and forcefully for what can right-fully be called his philosophical system. Such doctrines as the theoryof emanation, the causal role of the One with respect to the twoother primary hypostases, and the relationship between body andsoul, as well as aspects of human psychology such as virtue and freewill, all constitute a definite philosophical teaching that purports todescribe, more or less accurately, what reality is like and what humanbeings are like.2 Plotinus also attempts to sketch, hint at, and other-wise indicate a method that one might say oversteps speculativemetaphysics as such. The Enneads and the texts that follow in its trainrepresent a disciplined attempt to foster, to awaken, or at least toacknowledge what the Neoplatonists conceived to be a sometimesCf. M. Hirschle, Sprachphilosophie und Namenmagie im Neuplatonismus (Meisenheimam Glan, 1979).On the doctrinal aspects of Plotinus' philosophical system and for his strength as anexponent of original philosophical doctrine, see the highly persuasive monographof Gerson 1994.Gerson views Plotinus as an innovative, systematic philosopher, who attempts toprovide ontological solutions to \"inadequacies in the accounts of Plato and Aris-totle\" (Gerson 1994, p. 67) concerning such issues as, for example, the role of theOne as a causal principle, or the need for an explanatory principle that transcendsthe intellect."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Introduction.

But how is it that this tradition concerns itself with what couldbe called a non-discursive pedagogy, especially given that the tradi-tion itself, as we shall see, places such tremendous weight on textualexegesis? The answer to this question ought to go beyond the merelyempirical observation that Neoplatonic philosophical discourse cantake several different forms: theurgic ritual, radical Skepticism, vi-sionary journeys, or visual exercises. That much will be obvious toany reader of the tradition.Decoding these texts involves seeing them as something like med-itation manuals rather than mere texts. The non-discursive aspectsof the text - the symbols, ritual formulae, myths, and images - arethe locus of this pedagogy. Their purpose is to help the reader tolearn how to contemplate, to awaken the eye of wisdom, to, in thewords of the Chaldean Oracles. \"Open the immortal depth of thesoul: open all [your] eyes up in the heights.\"4 In other words, thesetexts constitute a language of vision.In the remaining pages of this introduction, I consider in moredetail the very concept of the exegetical tradition as practiced by theNeoplatonists. The Neoplatonists answered for themselves such ques-tions as how to invoke Platonic authority for their own metaphysicaldoctrines, how to evaluate the literal meaning of Plato's texts, andhow to interpret Plato's figurative language, by means of a herme-neutics that first elaborated these seemingly transparent concepts.For example, the word \"symbol\" (symbolon) has certain ritual affilia-tions that informed the Neoplatonists' readings of texts as well as3 Plotinus, for example, thinks that there is an innate capacity in all human beings, bywhich they can enjoy \"contact with god\" (Enneads V.1.11.14), although this facultyis largely dormant. Cf. Enneads Y.1.12.1: \"But how is it that although we have suchgreat possessions, we are not aware of them?\"For Plotinus, the task of the philosopher will not be to deliver a discursiveexposition concerning the principles of reality, but rather to remind his reader to\"turn the act of awareness inward, and insist that it hold attention there\" (EnneadsV.i. 12.15).4 Chaldean Oracles, fragment 112."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Introduction. Representing a Tradition: Exegesis, Symbol, and Self-reflectionthe Neoplatonic texts themselves. Likewise, since the question ofPlato's own teaching methods is under dispute for some of theNeoplatonists,5 their notion of what constitutes Platonic doctrine canalso be opaque. Even the concept of a text as a neutral medium forconveying doctrine receives scrutiny. Thus, there are esoteric texts,sacred texts, public texts and ritual texts, and all of these textspresuppose the appropriate context for their decipherment.Platonic Exegesis before Plotinus and after DamasciusEven if we confine a study of Neoplatonic textuality to its exegeticalnature, and see Neoplatonism as literally a series of footnotes onPlato, this textuality is still fraught with difficulties, as any student ofPlato will observe. There is neither space nor necessity to rehearsehere the familiar difficulties raised by Schleiermacher and advancedby the Tubingen school concerning the allusions to extratextualwisdom embedded within Plato's texts, the ''things of more valuethan the things . . . composed\" (Phaedrus 278dg).6 Instead, I wouldlike to frame Neoplatonism by looking at the history of ancientPlatonic exegesis.Ancient philosophers tended to see themselves as exegetes ofprevious texts or doctrines and the Neoplatonists were no excep-tion.7 Perhaps the most famous example of this traditional claim toorthodoxy is found in EnneadsV. 1.8, Plotinus' doxography concern-ing his doctrine of the three primary hypostases, the soul, the intel-For example, in the so-called Anonymous Prolegomena to the Study of Plato's Doctrines,the sixth-century Neoplatonist Olympiodorus suggests that Plato teaches by empha-sizing the contrast between divine and human intelligence, or by means of maieutics,or by helping the student cultivate self-knowledge. English translations by L. G.Westerink (Amsterdam, 1962).Cf. Kramer, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics, for a history of the notion of theUnwritten Doctrines. Kraemer and Reale suggest that Unwritten Doctrines are prin-ciples that form a foundation for the metaphysics adumbrated in the main corpusof the Platonic dialogues but that were, for various reasons, never explicitly espousedas foundational. I do not pursue this line of inquiry in this book for the simplereason that I am concerned here with non-discursive thinking. Since these principleswere discursively formulated, according to Kramer and others who take this line ofapproach, it seems to me to make little difference as to whether they were orallytransmitted or inscribed in the dialogues of Plato.On Plotinus as exegete of Plato, see Charrue 1978, Dorrie 1974, and most recentlyGatti in Gerson 1996, pp. 10-38."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Introduction.

(V.i.8.11-15).\"8Plotinus elaborates this programmatic statement regarding the exe-getical nature of his teaching elsewhere in his works. In particular,Plotinus raises the question of how the methods of the Platonicexegete differ from the methods employed by members of otherschools. Because intellectual knowledge resists discursive formula-tion, Platonic exegesis turns out to be, perhaps surprisingly, funda-mentally extratextual. In the following passage, Plotinus is expound-ing the difficulties surrounding an inquiry into the nature ofintellectual knowledge: \"We have failed to arrive at understandingbecause we think that this knowledge consists in theorems, or indrawing conclusions from premises; but that kind of thing has noth-ing to do with knowledge here. Now if someone wishes to argueabout these matters, he is permitted to do so for the time being. Asfor the knowledge [in intellect] which Plato has in sight when hesays, 'It is not one thing, distinct from that in which it exists(V.8.4.48-53).Plotinus suggests that one can interpret Plato only by relying onan intuition that fully assimilates the doctrine in question; one must,according to Plotinus, become the exegesis. If Plotinus' Platonicexegesis implies a paradoxical devaluation of the text, it is becausethe status of the text is always in question throughout the longhistory of the Platonic tradition. Throughout this history, the onequestion repeatedly asked is, what were the doctrines of Plato andhow does one recognize Platonic teaching? By looking at this ques-tion of what constitutes Platonic dogmatism in the history of exege-sis, we gain a vantage point from which to view the texts of Neopla-tonism.We know that the Middle Platonists practiced an unusual form oftextual exegesis, in which so-called items of doctrine found withinthe text were marked with an obelisk to signify their doctrinality,and then imported wholesale and without any dialogic contextuali-zation, into a series of dogmata, or teachings, that were thought tocontain the most important aspects of Plato's philosophy.

The credibility of the Handbook of Platonismis further strained since it purports to be a literal summary of Plato'sprincipal doctrines and yet attributes to Plato innovations in theareas of ethics and logic that were never even conceived by him.10 Atany rate, the point of this example is to remind the reader of oneextreme version of textual literalism, in which philosophy is thoughtto consist of a list of tenets, even if in some cases that list is supple-mented by anachronistic material culled from the current philosoph-ical vocabulary.What strikes me about such works as the Didaskalikos is the bold-ness by which they are produced, an audacity occasioned by thehandbook approach that displays an insensitivity to the hesitationsPlato himself expressed over the written method of conveying doc-trines as well as to the literary form of the dialogues. If the MiddlePlatonists shared with the Neoplatonists that peculiar amalgam ofHellenistic and Peripatetic philosophy that formed the basis of theirscholastic disputes, they most certainly did not share the Neo-platonists' heartfelt, passionate scrutiny concerning the true mean-ing of almost every word in Plato's texts. This over confidence in thetransparency of the text, a rashness signified by the exegete's dog-matizing obelisk, can be strikingly contrasted with the diffidence thatone sees at the very end of the Neoplatonic era. Glancing at thePlatonic commentaries and handbooks produced in the sixth cen-tury, in the school of Olympiodorus, one notices a veritable obses-sion with the issue of Plato's own hesitations as evinced in his texts.Olympiodorus devotes chapter 10 of his Prolegomena to the Study ofPlatonic Philosophy to the refutation of an ephectic, or non-dogmatic,Plato:9 As, for example, Apuleius' De Platone et eius dogmate. See Dillon 1993 and Whittaker1990 for the most recent and authoritative texts and translations of the Didaskalikos.10 For example, Alcinous attributes to Plato what amounts to the entire system ofPeripatetic ethics. See Didaskalikos and Dillon's commentary on chapters 5 and 6.Perhaps \"credibility\" is the wrong word, since the purpose of the Handbook remainsunknown.

Nevertheless, some assert, as-similating Plato to the ephectics and to the Academicians, that he too main-tained the doctrine of akatalepsia.These remarks are curious, for we have no indication that a Skepticalreading of Plato was current or even conceivable at this time. In fact,as the context makes clear, the Skeptics are represented in thispassage as a prior philosophical school; chapters 7 through 10 pre-sent a concise history of philosophy that is remarkably free from anynotions of philosophical currency attributable to the views that fallunder its purview: \" there has been no shortage of philosophicalhaireseis (schools) both before and after Plato, yet he surpassed all ofthem by his teaching, his thought, and in every possible way\" (Prole-gomena 7.1).Olympiodorus performs the exegete's role throughout his refuta-tion of a non-dogmatic Plato, turning first to the grammatical item,Plato's use of what Olympiodorus terms the ''hesitating\" adverbs,such as \"probably\" (eiKog), \"perhaps\" (i'aog), and \"as I imagine\"(T&X' «£ oi[iai). Nevertheless, Olympiodorus manages to sustain asuperficially pedantic tone in the four pages he devotes to this end,eschewing any close reading of the dialogues, briefly glossing topoisuch as recollection, and importing issues that have no foundationin Plato, as, for example, his refutation of the tabula rasa theory ofthe soul (10.27).In short, Olympiodorus' schoolroom lesson has little interest as adocument of sixth-century Skepticism: one wonders, for example, ifOlympiodorus was familiar with any of the writings of Sextus Empir-icus or was more likely using the brief paragraph in Diogenes' Life ofPlato to inform his topic.11 Nor indeed has it much value as anexegetical text, as we have seen. Its importance, if it can be said tohave any, lies rather in the particular fascination that Plato's teach-11 The word ephektikos, used of Plato in Prolegomena 10, is found in Diogenes Laertius.At any rate, Sextus at PHI 221 does not in fact define Plato as a Skeptic. Analternative possibility is that the Neoplatonists were familiar, not with the works ofSextus Empiricus, but with those of Aenesidemus.

In this charmingrendition of Plato as a champion of truth against its arch detractors,the Ephectics, who deny that anything can be known, and the Pro-tagoreans, who assert that everything is true, Elias too alludes to theimmortality of the soul to illustrate his theme:[The Ephectics] suppressed the refutation of a premise. And this school isalso known as the Three-footed, since they answered with three alternatives:when asked the definition of soul, whether it was mortal or immortal, theyanswered, \"it is either mortal or immortal or neither or both.\" The schoolis also known as \"aporematic,\" because it maintains a state of aporia anddoes not permit solutions.And they oppose the Protagoreans. The Protagoreans maintained thattruth prevailed, saying that what each person believes is actually true. ButPlato takes both schools to task in his own terms, refuting the Ephectics inthe Theaetetus thus:\"Do you maintain that nothing can be known as a result of knowing [thisfact] or as a result of not knowing it? For if you do so knowingly, thenbehold, there is knowledge. But if not knowingly, then we shall not acceptwhat you say, since you don't know [what you are talking about] when yousay that nothing is knowable.\" Plato refutes the Protagoreans in the Protago-ras, as follows: \"Are we right or wrong when we say that you are wrong,Protagoras? If we are right, then you are wrong, and therefore, there isfalsehood. But if we are wrong while you are right, there again falsehoodexists.

In the next passage there is an almost verbatimecho of the Prolegomena's interest in the grammar of doubt: \"Somehave thought that Plato too belonged to the [Ephectic] school,above all since he used adverbs that indicated doubt, as when hesaid, 'I think,' Terhaps,' 'Maybe,' and 'I guess.' \" This quotationfrom Elias repeats many themes found in the Prolegomena, perhapsthe prefaces to these works were stamped out of a single mold.Whether this material became some kind of scholastic siglum, a sealof orthodoxy, or had perhaps a propagandistic purpose, is a questionworth exploring, but one that must be postponed for the present.13Meanwhile, it is enough to notice not only that Ammonius, Olympio-dorus, and Elias all belonged to the Commentator tradition andtherefore that their works could well be sets of lecture notes, schooldisputations, or textbook material, but also that their work on Platowas rather mediocre.14 According to Damascius, these teachers wereentrenched Aristotelians; posterity has disposed of their PlatonicCommentaries, which had to compete with the more brilliant worksof Proclus and Damascius. We should not expect to find great in-sights or staggering hermeneutics on the subject of Platonism inthese prefaces or textbooks.15Instead, we do find a consistently developed theme, which has todo with the dogmatic reading of Plato's dialogues. Although it is notclear how thoroughgoing these authors proved to be in their scrutinyof Plato's dialogic epistemology, one fact seems trenchant: they as-sociated Plato with an ambivalent dogmatism. That is, their concernto defend the dogmatism of Plato arose out of their sensitivity to thequalified, possibly hesitant nature of his assertions, and no doubt tothe negotiable character of truth that inevitably arises in the dia-13 On the contents of the Proemia to the Aristotelian Commentators on Plato, see thework of Phillipe Hoffman 1987a.14 Still useful on the subject of Olympiodorus is R.

For example, Olympiodorus ends his refutation ofPlato's Skepticism with a paraphrase from the Gorgias: \"If you do notlisten when you yourself are making assertions, then you will not beconvinced if someone else is the speaker. How could we consider[the author of this sentence] to be a Skeptic?\" (Prolegomena 11.25).To summarize this discussion, Ammonius and his school are atleast somewhat ambivalent in their assessment of Plato's dogmatism;they clearly distinguish the style and teaching methods that he culti-vates from ordinary dogmatism. At times, they hint that Plato's teach-ings involve an appeal to a kind of intuitive wisdom, based on intro-spection, on divine or innate knowledge.16 Finally, this hermeneuticsof ambivalence is peculiarly associated with one particular exegete,Ammonius, and his immediate students and philosophical descen-dants. We have evidence that Olympiodorus and Elias were studentsof Ammonius, and we have very strong verbal agreements within theprefatory material to the Commentary works that these philosophersauthored.17 With these conclusions in mind, let us turn to considerDamascius, the last Platonic successor and the figure with whom Iend this study.We know from the Life of Isidore that Damascius at some time hadstudied with Ammonius (V.L 111.10: \"Damascius records that Am-monius had expounded Plato to him\").18 However remote his intel-Prolegomena 10.Cf. p. 61 of Segonds' commentary on the Prolegomena, and the references citedthere.

Representing a Tradition: Exegesis, Symbol, and Self-reflectionlectual affiliation with the Alexandrian school, Damascius makes apoint of reporting on and recording the activities of this group inthe Life of Isidore, so that we can safely assume his familiarity with itsexegetical methods. This path of inquiry has at least enabled us totrack the exegetical puzzle of a non-dogmatic Plato back into theLate Athenian Academy, via the shadowy figure of Ammonius. Andit has confirmed the fact that Neoplatonism is partially informed byancient difficulties surrounding the interpretation of Plato.What I hope I have accomplished by framing the Neoplatonisttradition with this cursory look at Middle Platonism and the Com-mentators is to suggest that the issues of textual practice, of dogma-tism and exegesis, were very much alive for the ancient students ofPlato, just as they are for us today. Just as it has become fashionablefor some modern students of Plato to refuse to attribute to Plato anyof the interlocutors' statements as constituting a doctrinal position,so some strands within the Commentator tradition emphasized thedifficulty of ascertaining the existence of any theses Plato might haveheld with conviction. An even earlier exegetical style evinced inMiddle Platonism completely ignored the dialogic presentation ofthe doctrines that it literally ascribed to Plato, in a way that mightremind one of the criticism practiced earlier in our own academictradition. Although Neoplatonists practiced a distinctive method ofexegesis, this is not to confine Neoplatonism to its role as an exeget-ical school. In fact, the Neoplatonists promulgated a number ofdoctrines deliberately designed to support the notion of a traditionoutside the texts as well as a transmission of wisdom outside theliteral teachings of Plato.The SymbolOne question concerning the relative place of texts within the tradi-tion of Neoplatonism and, particularly, the Neoplatonic valuation oftexts is bound up with the dispute between theurgy and philosophyin the third and fourth centuries.19 At the center of this dispute arethe place and significance of the symbol, or sunthema, the ritualobject by means of which theurgic elevation was thought to takeOn this dispute, see Sheppard, Shaw, and Smith.11"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Introduction. Representing a Tradition: Exegesis, Symbol, and Self-reflectionplace.20 Thus what I am interested in is not so much a contemporarydiscussion of the place of the symbolic within exegesis, that is, aphilosophy of hermeneutics in the abstract. Rather, what I proposeto look at is the place of the symbolon, or sunthema, the ritual objectin Neoplatonism, as a way of grounding a discussion of symbolism,and how to read it in the exegesis of Neoplatonic texts. Althoughchapter 5 applies contemporary linguistic theory to what I there callPlotinus' metaphors, I would like in this introduction to suggest thatthe role of metaphor in the Enneads of Plotinus is linked to thelarger question of symbolism as construed by the Neoplatonists.I define \"symbol\" as any structure of signification in which a direct,primary, literal meaning designates, in addition, another meaning which isindirect, secondary, and figurative and which can be apprehended onlythrough the first. . . . Interpretation is the work of thought which consists indeciphering the hidden meaning in the apparent meaning, in unfolding thelevels of meaning implied in the literal meaning.21This quotation, from Ricoeur's The Conflict of Interpretations indicatesa theory of exegesis that goes exactly against the spirit of Neoplatonicsymbolism, or so I would argue. For the theurgists, a symbolon is nota meaning at all, nor is a symbolon subsidiary to, derivative of, orreferential to a literal meaning. Instead, the symbolon is a divinelyinstalled switch, so to speak, that operates within the context ofritual. Symbols function as crossroads, as junctures that allow thesoul to trace its path back to its origins. For Neoplatonists, theprocess of interpreting symbols involves a complex mixture of tradi-tional lore and radical self-reflection.What does it mean to interpret the symbolic expressions of Neo-platonism, and how should we proceed when we encounter a symbolor, as we would say, a metaphor, within the text? By looking at thetradition as a whole in the light of these questions, we gain a foot-hold by which to perform an exegesis that may coincide more exactlywith the terms of Neoplatonic theory. Moreover, this approach re-veals, somewhat unexpectedly, a certain unity in a tradition that isnormally thought to have been ruptured by the split between the-urgy and philosophy in the third and fourth centuries.To take one example, we know that Iamblichus composed a work20 See Coulter for a history of the word symbolon.21 Ricoeur, The Conflict of Interpretations, p. 12.12"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Introduction.

Thus in chapter 21 of the Protrepticus, we find a catalogue of theso-called Pythagorean symbola as well as a method of decoding themaccording to Neoplatonic principles of exegesis. In this text also wefind Iamblichus remarking that the entire philosophical tradition inwhich he finds himself participating (the Pythagorean, which was forIamblichus the pristine form of Platonism)23 employs symbols as itsprimary method of teaching: \"the whole of Pythagorean teaching isunique in that it is symbolic\" (Prot. 34, p. 247).24 What characterizesthis tradition, according to Iamblichus, is its reliance on symbolicmodes of discourse. Iamblichus' Protrepticus culminates in his gradualrevelations concerning the meaning of Pythagorean symbolism, as ifto suggest that they constitute in themselves an initiation into thecontemplative life.25The final method for exhortation is the one [that makes use of differentkinds of] symbols: the kind unique to this sect and not revealed to otherschools; the public kind shared with the other schools. . . . Accordingly wewill introduce in our discourse certain exoteric explanations, those sharedwith all philosophy. . . and then gradually mix in the more authentic teach-ings of the Pythagoreans . .. and this method will lead us imperceptibly fromexoteric conceptions . . . into the heights, elevating the thoughts of everyonewho approaches with genuine effort. (Prot. 29, p. 132, with omissions)Iamblichus goes on to discuss the importance of the distinctionbetween esoteric and exoteric doctrines, pointing to the Pythago-rean separation of mere auditors from the actual followers ofPythagoras, as well as to the Pythagorean rule of silence and non-disclosure to the uninitiated.

For it exhorts one to keepaway from the vulgar and merely human life, and thinks it better to followthe detached, divine life, and it asserts that one ought to ignore communisopinio and value instead one's own thoughts, which are secret, etc. (Prot,pp. 137-8)So in this book, we can imagine Iamblichus providing the studentwith a kind of counter-Didaskalikos, an esoteric handbook that in-vokes symbols rather than tenets.26 A thorough exhortation to phi-losophy, it includes a series of precautions, embodied in the akous-mata, concerning the form, accessibility, and practice of genuinewisdom.

As is well known, behind Iamblichus' insistence, contraPorphyry, on the ritual efficacy of certain symbols for the purpose ofuniting the individual soul with the gods, lies a psychological tenet.Iamblichus follows Aristotle in holding that the human soul is fullyembodied; he denies Plotinus' doctrine that the highest part of thesoul always remains undescended, permanentiy attached to the intel-lectual realm.From this conception of the soul, Iamblichus argues that knowl-edge or intellection necessarily fails to allow the individual soul tofree itself from its human limitations: \"not even gnosis [grants]contact with the divine. For gnosis remains barred [from its object]because of a certain otherness\" (DM 7, p. 42). Again Iamblichusmaintains that \"thinking does not connect theurgists with divinebeings, for what would prevent those who philosophize theoreticallyfrom having theurgic union with the gods? Rather ... it is the powerof ineffable symbols comprehended by the gods alone, that estab-lishes theurgical union\"28 (DM 96, 13). Lack of space prohibits moredetails here about the dispute between Porphyry and Iamblichus.29What is important is that this dispute has suggested to some scholarsthat the theurgic Neoplatonism of Iamblichus and its associatedreligiosity represent a foreign and divergent philosophy from that ofPlotinus' school. Perhaps too this scholarly judgment has resulted ina way of reading Plotinus' Enneads that ultimately overlooks its ritualaffiliations and its symbolism as subordinate to or superseded bydiscursively expressed doctrine.30 In fact, recent studies of Iambli-chus and Plotinus have suggested that both philosophers employmathematical symbolism not just to represent features of the intelli-gible world but also as part of a contemplative language intended toconvey a sense of the unitive knowing celebrated as the hallmark ofthe tradition.31This brief excursus on the nature of Neoplatonic symbolism al-lows us once more to consider what a proper Neoplatonic herme-28 Translation of Gregory Shaw.

On the one hand, Neoplatonic texts can beconsidered in terms of their own exegetical functions; they representa pedagogical tradition that nevertheless repudiates, as we have seen,a literal interpretation of the text. On the other hand, these sametexts are also the main vehicle of expression for a tradition thatexplicates its original insights in terms of a theory of non-discursivethinking. It is not simply the conventional contrast between primaryand secondary meanings or the literary contrast between literal andmetaphorical utterances that is at stake in a Neoplatonic hermeneu-tics. Rather, what this book attempts, in its chapters on metaphor,Orphic and Pythagorean symbolism, and Proclus' theurgic discourse,is an interpretation of Neoplatonic texts within the framework of thetradition's own pronouncements about the meaning of symbols. Andthis attempt lands us in an ancient hermeneutic circle. For many ofthese symbolisms invoke a context of tradition and suggest that tobe appreciated, the symbols must be expounded by and for thosewho belong to the tradition. We saw this in the case of Iamblichus'Protrepticus. In this sense, perhaps Ricouer's way of describing thehermeneutic circle, \"you must understand in order to believe butyou must believe in order to understand,\"32 has some relevance forNeoplatonism.As examples of this Neoplatonic promotion of tradition, one maycite the almost uniform invocation of Pythagoras' divine initiationand the consequent prestige of mathematical symbolism, or again,the frequent allusions to the Orphic theogony as anchoring Neopla-tonic cosmological speculation in divine revelation. In fact, the veryinstitution of Diadoche, the transmission of the Neoplatonic mantlewithin the revived academy, is once more part of this prestige ac-corded to tradition.33 Celebration of the master's birthday, hagio-graphic bibliographies, and general veneration of the teacher as themost authoritative source of wisdom are all purposefully deployed bythe Neoplatonists (witness Porphyry's hagiographic Life of Plotinusattached as preface to the Enneads) to remind the reader of theappropriate context for interpretation.32 Ricouer, Conflict of Interpretations, p. 298.33 See Lim 1995 and Fowden 1989 and the references that they cite."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Introduction. Representing a Tradition: Exegesis, Symbol, and Self-reflectionReflectionStill, we today do not belong to the Neoplatonic tradition; we cannotbe initiated into the inner circle of Plotinus' listeners, and we haveno one to instruct us in theurgic practice. If the context for Neopla-tonic exegesis is the (at least partially fabricated) notion of tradition,in reality the symbols and doctrines encountered in these texts arepresumably thought by their authors to be accessible. Their meaningis to be recovered, in Plotinus' words, by self-inquiry (Plotinus insiststhat \"knowing something in the strict sense amounts to knowingoneself [V.3.61]) or by \"turning within oneself and seeing thevision as one [with the self] and as oneself\" (V.8.10.40). Through-out this book, I am concerned to discuss not only Neoplatonic tex-tuality but also Neoplatonic pedagogy by means of the doctrine ofnon-discursive thinking. This pedagogy was foremost and alwaysconceived by the Neoplatonists as a search for self-knowledge, acontemplative askesis that demands from its practitioner not just afamiliarity with the texts of the tradition but also the effort to assim-ilate those texts.The questions that remain to be asked are how such assimilationis thought to take place and whether or not the texts themselvesprovide clues to this process. Part of the appeal for Iamblichus andPorphyry of the Pythagorean tradition is that it allows them to envi-sion philosophical speculation within the environment of the Pythag-orean modus vivendi. Other Neoplatonists rely on the doctrine ofcontemplative virtues, grades or stations of wisdom by which onetraverses the path that theory sets out. For example, although in theSententiae ad Intelligibilia Ducentes (Sentences Leading to the Intelligi-ble World)34 Porphyry distinguishes among four classes of arete, it isclear that each kind - civic, kathartic, noetic, and paradigmatic - isa mode of training the mind, of transforming one's consciousness sothat this assimilation can take place. In this treatise, Porphyry offersan excursus on the practice of contemplation, affording the modernreader a rare glimpse of Neoplatonic pedagogy.The first grade, civic virtue, allows the student to govern the34 This treatise is more or less a compendium containing extracts from the Enneads,with some additions by Porphyry, particularly in the area of Neoplatonic ethics.

These virtues are defined in terms of the soul'sability to direct its attention inwardly, to abide in a state of contem-plation, and to become one with the object of contemplation.Attention, concentration, control of thoughts, and absorption inthe object to which the mind is present are all governed by practiceat this stage. Porphyry thus defines a very precise contemplativepsychology as a gradual process of inner transformation, of identi-fying, purifying, and concentrating the faculty of awareness to cul-tivate wisdom, which is defined as the native work of this faculty(Sent. 32, p. 29).37What this contemplative psychology, or askesis, shows us is thatself-reflection is construed as a process of working with the mindand developing its powers of concentration. This training in concen-tration is part of the non-discursive methodology that complementsthe textual side of the tradition. Several chapters in this book addressthe psychology of contemplation and even suggest that the symbol,as it is found in Neoplatonic texts, often becomes a contemplativeobject, one whose meaning can be discovered only through an in-tense process of concentration, assimilation, and self-reflection. Theprocess of interpreting the Neoplatonic symbol, and hence the Neo-platonic text, is entirely dependent on the act of self-reflection.This hermeneutic conclusion should not come as a completesurprise.

Sellers, Delimitations. Phenomenology and the Demise of Metaphysics. Bloomington,39 Ricouer, \"The Hermeneutics of Symbols,\" in Conflict of Interpretations.40 I am not here applying a psychoanalytic reading to Neoplatonic texts, even though,for the most part, this book is concerned with the third hypostasis, the level of soul.The reason for my concentration on this hypostasis is that the soul, according toPlotinus, is characterized by discursive thinking; the texts that become important inthe following chapters are aimed primarily at directing the discursively operatingmind to a different mode of thinking. Psychoanalytic interpretations of Neoplatonicdoctrines would not be valid from within the perspective of Neoplatonism, since forthe Neoplatonists, intellect is not, properly speaking, a faculty that belongs to thehuman psyche. Hence intellect cannot be understood primarily through studyingthe history of the individual mind or soul. See Blumenthal 1971 and Blumenthal1996-41 See especially Gerson 1997 and 1994, p. 55: \"For Plotinus, we might say that sinceIntellect is immaterial, it naturally follows that knowing is essentially self-knowing.Knowing implies infallibility and infallibility can only obtain when there is self-reflexivity.\"42 Emilsson 1996 speaks rather of intellect's \"self-consciousness.\"43 In using the word \"faculty,\" I do not mean to imply that the Neoplatonists con-ceived of intellect as a capacity purely or even substantially belonging to the individ-ual human soul.

However elaborate their metaphysics may sometimesappear, the structures reported and discovered by Neoplatonists arepart and parcel with self-discovery.What characterizes the faculty of insight is unitive knowing, non-separation of subject and object, or complete assimilation to andidentification with the object of knowledge. And this form of unitiveknowing is non-discursive. But what exacdy is nous, and how doesone gain access to it? Could it be that the Neoplatonists were unin-terested in answering these questions and instead relied on the au-thoritative pronouncements of tradition to dispel or defer any anxi-ety about the existence of nous and the availability of intellectuallygrounded truth?I doubt this. In addition to the metaphysical structures assumedand elaborated in the tradition, this tradition also transmitted a non-discursive methodology. We saw earlier that Iamblichus in his Protrep-ticus warns the student that wisdom is not publicly available, that itinstead demands both initiation and askesis if it is to become avail-able at all. To the questions, what is this askesis, and how did theNeoplatonists think one ought to practice it, we glimpsed possibleanswers in the contemplative virtues of Porphyry, who describes agradual training that develops the mind's capacity for non-discursive,or unitive, thinking.In the following chapters, I treat the non-discursive or non-doctrinal aspects of the texts - symbols, visualizations, and so on - asfurther elements of this tradition. That is, I show that the texts revealan inclination to non-discursive methodologies and, further, that thesymbol can and sometimes does function as the locus for inculcatingthis kind of method. In the first part of the book, in the chaptersthat center on Plotinus' thought exercises and metaphors, I try toreconstitute the kind of non-discursive methodology that I suspect isoperating between the lines of the literal text. This methodologyrelies on self-reflection, on introspection, and on self-awareness, butof a highly specialized sort, one that I will now attempt to outline,but which I elaborate in more detail in chapters 3 through 7. Letme ask the reader's indulgence as I briefly list the features of thisself-reflection and also suggest that the individual chapters providegreater clarification.Non-discursive thinking does not involve thinking about anything,either by way of propositions or by way of theorems, and so on20"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Introduction. Representing a Tradition: Exegesis, Symbol, and Self-reflection(chapter 2). Instead, non-discursive thinking involves, perhaps para-doxically, a kind of objectless knowing, an activity that is self-directedbut refrains from any definitions or objectification of the self (chap-ter 3). This form of self-directed activity is self-transparent, involvinga turning of the attention toward the pure act of awareness as such,and a detachment from all other objects of awareness (chapter 4).Non-discursive thinking involves concentration, a setting aside of theentire panoply of objects, both perceptual and conceptual, and anidentification with the object of contemplation (chapter 5). Thisobject of contemplation, examples of which are given in chapters 3,4, and 5, is a matter of intense theoretical and practical speculationwithin the tradition. The object of contemplation can be connectedto the practice of theurgy and very often is selected from a set oftraditionally revered symbols, such as mathematical objects (chapter6), traditional myths or ritually oriented narratives (chapter 7), anddivine names (chapter 8). Finally, whatever insights are gained fromthis practice of intellectual askesis, the results obtained are neverequivalent to any discursive formulation or expression (chapter 9).In this Introduction, I have attempted to tie together the appar-ently disparate themes of the chapters that follow. I have also nodoubt deferred responsibility for the variety of textual practicestreated in this book by claiming that we, as readers of these texts,have no choice but to confront and accept the multiplicity of thesepractices if we are to comprehend the tradition. Finally, however, Ishould admit that the reader will find in what follows a record of myown attempts to read the texts of Neoplatonism, alongside the effortsof a growing scholarly community that is engaged in this enterprise.It is my sincerest wish that readers of this book will find that thesetexts speak to them and become the occasion for their own strate-gies, both discursive and non-discursive.21"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"PART ONELanguage in the Enneads"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Plotinus' Critique of Discursive ThinkingIn this chapter, I want to look more closely at the Neoplatoniccritique of discursive thinking, as part of a more general discussionof philosophical method in the Enneads. One issue that demandsimmediate attention is how we ought to conceive of philosophicalmethod in Neoplatonic texts. This chapter will explore dialectic inthe Enneads, with particular emphasis on its contrasts with both Stoicand Aristotelian dialectic, as well as with more contemporary philo-sophical methodologies. This chapter is largely negative in its conclu-sions, showing more what the dialectic is not than what Neoplatonicdialectic includes. In this respect, it introduces the subsequent chap-ters that explore a variety of dialectical strategies that neverthelesspresuppose this central critique of discursive thinking.Let me start with the modern distinction between ontologicalcommitments and epistemological commitments invoked, for exam-ple, to examine versions of philosophical realism. Realism has beendescribed as the belief that reality exists independently of any [hu-man] representation of it.1 Expressed in this way, modern philosoph-ical realism is not an epistemological theory and entails neither atheory of truth nor a privileged, unique description of the world.2 Inother words, if one holds some version of philosophical realism, itmay turn out that truth (one's representation of the world) andreality coincide - that our representations accurately reflect the waythings are - or it may not. It may further turn out to be the case that1 Searle 1995, pp. 151-3.2 Searle 1995 pp. 154-5, arguing against Putnam's definition of realism.

In this example, ontology and epistemology areconceived as separate philosophical realms, whose conclusions mayoperate quite independently of each other. Such was not true ofancient philosophical methodology.In the history of ancient philosophy, realism has coincided withtheories of truth that entail very specific ways of representing theworld. Plato's Theory of Forms, for example, ties a type of ontologi-cal objectivism to a theory of language: language refers to and de-pends on the existence of real entities that directly inform linguisticusage. Similarly, Aristotle's notion of first philosophy also relies on atheory of truth:In every systematic inquiry where there are first principles, or causes, orelements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these.(Phys.Aristotle's philosophical realism entails ontological objectivism - theexistence of objective first principles in nature - as well as a corre-spondence theory of truth. For Aristotle, these first principles thatexist in nature also determine the truth of our statements aboutthem. Facts about reality bring about the truth of our representa-tions, so that definitions adequately reflect the essences of primarysubstances.3 One philosopher has even generalized this kind of the-orizing in the history of Western philosophy, stating that:One of the oldest urges in Western philosophy is to think that somehow orother truth and reality should coincide, that somehow or other, if therereally were such things as truth and reality, as we normally think of them,then truth would have to provide an exact mirror of reality. The nature ofreality itself would have to provide the exact structure of true statements.4What kind of emphasis a particular variety of realism gives toepistemological considerations varies, no doubt, with the intensity ofepistemological debate that realism addresses. Scholars have re-marked that, for example, Aristotelian epistemology is almost sur-prisingly unproblematic in certain ways: since Aristotle never doubtsthat knowledge of the world is available for human knowers, doubtsas to whether or not private experience links up with a public reality3 On Aristotle's philosophical realism, see Irwin, pp. 4-6.4 Searle 1995, p. 175."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Plotinus1 Critique of Discursive Thinkinghardly arise for him.5 Conversely, if Platonic epistemology is particu-larly concerned with distinguishing the faculty of intellect as capableof somehow conceiving infallible knowledge, it is also concerned torepresent that knowledge as not subject to derailment by Sophisticpersuasion. Plotinus inherits the *'faculty\" approach to intellect thatcharacterizes the epistemologies of Plato and Aristotle, but shares incommon with Plato a sensitivity to possible epistemological chal-lenges, a sensitivity that exerts a definite influence on his theory oftruth.So far we have seen that although epistemology and ontology areintertwined in ancient thought, either the epistemological side orthe ontological side of a given question will often prevail. Oftendialectic operates out in the open in a Neoplatonic text, whereas itsontological or epistemological correlates have to be inferred fromor even teased out of this operation. Neither a theory of truth that isisolable from ontological assumptions nor an ontology that operatesindependently of epistemology, Plotinus' dialectic plays upon theinadequacy of discursive thinking while simultaneously insisting thattruth is unproblematically available to human knowers. Preciselybecause intellectual knowledge is infallible due to intellect's inher-ent self-reflexivity (intellect is its objects), for Plotinus, philosophicalactivity operates beyond the constraints of epistemology. Thus thedoctrine of infallible intellectual knowledge is common to Platonic,Aristotelian, and Neoplatonic epistemologies. But unlike Plato, whosubjected his own epistemological constructions (for example, theTheory of Forms, or the ontological basis of predication and nega-tion) to a fairly rigid rational scrutiny, the Neoplatonists made nosuch attempt to do the same for their intellect. And despite theformal similarity to the Aristotelian doctrine that intellect is its ob-jects, the Neoplatonic identity thesis had radically dissimilar conse-quences for Neoplatonic methodology.In the case of Plotinus' theory that intellect is its objects, thismeans that knowing the truth is a state utterly unlike that of normalthinking. Precisely because intellectual knowledge is not intentional,in the sense that it is not directed at things outside of itself, thecontents of intellect cannot be disclosed by means of linguistic rep-resentations. Nor can the metaphysical structures revealed by the5 Taylor 1990, pp. 116-17."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsintellect be described by means of propositions without suffering agreat deal in the process of translation. Hence the locus of therepresentational gap has migrated in the philosophy of Plotinus. Hedoes not ask how it comes about that intellect adequately representsfeatures of the world because he is more troubled by how the worldthat is known by intellect can be philosophically represented. Theproblem with such representation is not only the obvious one, thatany representation is selectively aspectual, capturing certain featuresand omitting others of the object represented. Plotinus' problem isthat he needs to convey a theory of truth that is precisely non-representational, without the unwanted result that reality collapsesinto mere representation.If truth is inherently non-representational, not based on a repre-sentational relationship between subject and object, then how can itbe revealed? What kind of truth can be communicated if truth justis, as Plotinus notoriously remarks, \"what it says.\"6 We need to distin-guish Plotinus' methodology from subjectivism, from the epistemo-logical stance that equates the world with one's representations of it.The doctrine that intellect is its objects does not imply a subjectivisttheory of truth, according to which the immediacy of consciousnessstands in for an otherwise elusive and mediated reality. The difficultyof locating truth on the subjective side of the representational gap isa topic to which I will return in chapter 3. For now, I turn toPlotinus' critique of discursive thinking.Philosphical MethodsEpistemological idealism picks up where Cartesian confidence leavesoff.7 Because the Cartesian solution privileges the representationalnature of the mental, it actually leaves the representational gap, thecognitive dissonance that arises from the private nature of subjectiv-6 Cf. Enneads V.3.5.25: \"Truth ought not to be of something other [than itself], butwhat truth says, this too it ought to be.\" And again, EnneadsV.$. 10.35: \"If [intellect]says 'I am this,' and the 'this' is different from that which speaks it, it will utterfalsehood.\"7 Here I use the term \"epistemological idealism\" to refer to Nagel's definition ofidealism as the view that \"what there is is what we can think about or conceive of. .. and that this is necessarily true because the idea of something that we could notthink about or conceive of makes no sense\" (Nagel 1986, p. 90)."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Plotinus' Critique of Discursive Thinkingity, fully intact. One very broad response to this dilemma has beenthe anti-foundationalist epistemologies of Bernard Williams andThomas Nagel. These philosophers search for objectivity as an ap-proximate goal that is brought about by the reflexive critique ofidiosyncratic representations. As Paul Redding puts it, \"subjectivityis understood in a particular way: it is understood in terms of theidea of the particularity of the conditions under which the belief isformed, an idea expressed by the metaphor of the conditions underwhich one 'views' the world - one's 'perspective.' \"8 This search forobjectivity in turn leads to a relatively less perspectival truth, anaperspectival truth or \"view from Nowhere,\" which in some waysforms the modern equivalent of the absolute or of absolute truth.Williams discusses this notion of truth in his book Descartes: TheProject of Pure Inquiry: \"That surely must be identical with a concep-tion which, if we are not idealists, we need: a conception of theworld as it is independently of all observers.\"9This way of construing objectivity seeks to remove the particularityof the subject as a partial or limited perspective on what might bethought of as an absolute conception of the truth. This moderndebate about what constitutes philosophical truth, especially an ab-solute conception of truth, takes as its parameters the scientificmodel that Williams explicitly endorses as one extreme position. Theother extreme presents the viewpoint of the subject as always alreadyconditioning the reality that any absolute conception of truth wouldpretend to be about. But these two views would be seen as flawed,though perhaps in different degrees, from within the terms of Ploti-nus' own theorizing about the nature of truth. The identity theoryof truth for the Neoplatonists does not seek to discover objectiveessences, if that search is thought to take place outside of thesearcher. Certainly, scholars have rightly emphasized the meta-physical or ontological concommitants of Plotinus' theory of self-reflection. Much like Aristotle's God, the contents of that intellectare simply the forms. Hence self-reflection will turn out to be knowl-Redding, p. 6. Cf. also Nagel: \"A view or form of thought is more objective thananother if it relies less on the specifics of the individual's makeup and position inthe world, or on the character of the particular type of creature he is\" (Nagel 1986,P-5)-Bernard Williams, The Project of Pure Enquiry (Sussex, 1978), p. 241."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsedge of reality. The idea here is that self-reflection functions like aprinciple of truth; knowing that one knows is the foundation forknowledge of truth. In this sense, there could be no knowledge ofreality without self-reflection.10Now this is an important dimension of Plotinus' epistemology,and Plotinus does explicitly suggest (in V.5) that self-knowledge isthe principle of all truths. The problem is that thinking about an ob-ject does not, for Plotinus, equate with knowing it objectively, that is,knowing it as it is in itself. Plotinus is concerned to show that humanbeings cannot think their way out of a limited point of view, since dis-cursive thinking itself constitutes one such limited perspective.Again, like Williams and Nagel, Plotinus does insist upon thereflexive critique of thought as a condition for its correction, but heoffers cautions about a metaphysical realism that too easily assumesthat our accounts of the world correspond to features of the worldas it is in itself.11 In short, it may well be that intellect grounds itsintuitions according to the ontologically prior nature of the forms.Nevertheless, this notion of objectivity is not a conceptual one; theobjects known in this way cannot be the subjects of propositions norcan they be about individual particulars in the world. The reason forthis caution is, once more, that conceptual activity, far from observ-ing the nature of things as they are in themselves, actually obstructsour view. It prevents us from seeing things as they are in themselves.In the remainder of this chapter, I will be looking at Plotinus' ownformulation of the problematics of perspective.Philosophical Explanation in Enneads VI.7Enneads VI.7, \"How the Multitude of Forms Came into Being andOn the Good/' opens with a criticism of Plato's account of Demiur-gic creation in the Timaeus.

Within our treatise, this denial is tied to a discussionof the limits of philosophical explanation: even though we may de-scribe it by means of discursive thought, there is no such thing as aunique explanation for the structure of the world.

For his positive answer tothis question in the form of the concept of the undescended soul and its heterodoxywithin the Platonist tradition, see Blumenthal 1987b.22 Throughout the Enneads we find the insistence that the world is not an artifactwhose genesis is owed to someone's intentions, associated with the \"two acts\"theory of causation, wherein every level of reality must of necessity produce animage of itself in the form of a \"lower\" existent.

Such knowl-edge is said to constitute knowledge in its most proper sense. Butthings could not be more different with Plotinus. For him, the con-dition sine qua non for knowledge is the unity of the knower andthe object of knowledge, a condition that discursive thought of anykind necessarily precludes.24Our blueprints for the world do not correspond to the architect'sbecause there simply is no discursive thought in intellect. Now,causal relations are a prime instance of a ready-made structure. AndPlotinus declines to discuss the structure of nature in terms of stan-dard causal explanations, including teleology, one-directional causalconnection, essentialism, and metaphysical dualism, all of which arecharacterized in various ways by the limitations of discursive thought.In this treatise, Plotinus refuses to subscribe to such explanationsbecause he denies that discursive thought can ever be absolute. Thisis not to say that Plotinus refuses ever to invoke essentialism orcompletely denies the ordinary structure of causal sequences. Herewe see Plotinus operating at the limits of philosophical discourse,taking a critical turn to investigate the forms of philosophical expla-nation, ultimately to introduce a form of philosophy that is notexplanatory in any of the usual senses.We turn now to the critique of causal explanations offered intreatise VI.7. Plotinus' arguments seem to cut in two directions.Plotinus corrects Platonic teleology with a healthy dose of what isostensibly Aristotelian essentialism.

Essences at the level ofnous are not discrete. Instead of trying to explain the nature of theparticular, we must go to the intelligible and see how the particularlooks from that point of view.Plotinus enhances these causal theories with the concept of coor-dinate arising. This doctrine presents a twofold analysis of the phe-nomenal world, both parts of which are intended to break up anybelief in an independently real or self-subsistent external world. Thefirst theme is a description of the world as an interdependent nexusof beings. Under this description, the familiar Stoic idea of cosmicharmonia receives a more profound philosophical interpretation as asystem of relationships that can be described as mutually reflectivepoints of view.28 The second theme treats the multiplicity of individ-uals more on the analogy of thoughts arising in the mind, eachexpressing the nature of the thinker who has them.The treatise begins with an attempt to understand why the individ-ual has been endowed with the faculties of sensation. \"God or a godsent souls into genesis, endowed with sense organs.\" But why wasthis provision made? Answer: for the sake of preservation, which isto be accomplished by the activities of pursuit and avoidance (ofsense objects).Plotinus follows a strictly teleological model of explanation to26 On Aristotle as a corrector of Platonic notions of teleology, see Balme 1987, p. 275.27 Cf.

Since perception is a function of the souland not of the body, souls must possess some faculty for sense per-ception even before entering the world of genesis. Otherwise theywould lack psychic faculties that constitute part of the definition ofsoul. Hence the conclusion must be that souls are endowed withsense capacities by nature. The purely noetic condition wouldtherefore be unnatural for the soul. So the nature of the soul is toexist in a state wherein the sense faculties may be used, and so itmust live in the sense world. The soul is designed by nature then toexist in a state of embodiment, multiplicity, and in general, evil. Butif the same intelligence responsible for the creation of the soul couldbe responsible for its being endowed with the ability for self-preservation, we would have contradictory purposes in the very cre-ation of the soul. \"The exercise of providence would amount to nomore than the purpose, that the soul be preserved in evil.\"And yet the sensible exists; its cause can only be the intelligible.So the intelligible brings about the sensible in a way that does notinvolve the production of something outside of itself. The conclu-sion is that the sensible already exists within the intelligible. At thisstage of the argument, Plotinus does not yet tell us how the sensibleexists within the intelligible. He seems content to exploit the rhetor-ical reversal of roles and to leave the language of the sensible intactas a kind of metaphorical or extended usage.29Thus after proscribing teleological views, Plotinus proceeds withhis own account of the relation between the intelligible and thesensible. The immediate and glaring difference between the bannedaccount and the kind of account found at the end of chapter 1 inthe treatise VI.7 is the manner of reference to time. In the Timaeusnarrative, events unfold temporally, and causation is a developmen-tal sequence that ends in the individual realization (eK&arnvevepysiav) of a form within matter.30 But this type of analysis is false29 Thus we find him talking about \"the perceptibles that exist there\" (VI.7.6.2), \"theeyes they have there\" (V.8.4.26), eivai Tag aiaBtfjaeig lamac, ajiudpag vofiaeig, Tag 6e 8K8ivof|aeig Evapyetg aio0f)oeig.

So when we try tounderstand reality, we should start with a perspective that sees differ-ent states of the world as present altogether, though without tempo-ral existence.Several recent studies have called our attention to the Neoplato-nists' interest in theories of causation.31 Of interest to moderns is theoutright denial of horizontal or one-directional causal sequenceamong sensible particulars, or the denial that bodies are causallyefficient.32 Conversely, only incorporeal beings such as form, intel-lect, and soul are agents. The Neoplatonists regularly accounted forthe emergence of substances as well as the processes of the naturalworld by appealing to the idea of immanent causation, the doctrinethat effects are contained within their causes. Therefore the sensibleparticular, inasmuch as it is not incorporeal, cannot be designatedor isolated as the cause of a given individual or event. In the follow-ing passage, we see the denial of something that could be likened toa modern notion of cause, in which an event A precedes anotherevent B, such that B would not have come about without the pres-ence of A.Fire does not arise without a cause - What is its cause? Not friction, as onemight assume, since fire already exists in the universe and friction takesplace with the bodies undergoing friction [already] containing [fire].(VI.7.10.40, Armstrong's translation modified, reading 8X6VTCOV as temporalnot causal participle)Here event A, the friction, is not the cause of event B, the confla-gration. Rather, the cause of the conflagration is just the fact thatto Philoponus, pagans, Christians, and Jews debated how to read the Timaeus myth.For an interesting account of certain aspects of this interpretation, see JarislovPelikan 1997, the Jerome Lectures, What has Athens to do with Jerusalem} Ann Arbor,University of Michigan Press.Barnes 1983b; Sorabji 1987; Wagner 1982b.Barnes 1983b, p. 175, for example, concisely summarizes Proclus' presentation ofthis view (ETSo): (1) all bodies are passive; (2) everything incorporeal is active; (3)no body is active; (4) no incorporeal thing is passive.

This appears to be a denial of what is often calledthe counter-factual version of horizontal causation. That is, the con-flagration might have occurred even without the friction. Yet inother places, Plotinus seems more concerned not to deny horizontalcausal sequences but rather to illustrate the difficulties involved intrying to specify just how events are supposed to be related to eachother if one is to say that they are causally related.33 One very basicissue involves the difficulty of picking out just what a cause is, suchthat it is both necessary and sufficient for the bringing about of agiven effect. The problem has to do with being able to distinguishsuch a unique cause from what might be called the total causal field,in being able to distinguish a background condition from a cause.Hillary Putnam, for instance, illustrates the problem in this way:34Imagine that Venusians land on earth and observe a forest fire. One of themsays, \"I know what caused that - the atmosphere of the darned planet issaturated with oxygen\" . . . What is and what is not a \"cause\" or \"explana-tion\" depends on background knowledge and our reason for asking thequestion.The problem here arises from the ambivalent context in which theexplanation is given, but we can generalize from this example. If forany given query we find that a complete answer will have to specifyall of the relevant background conditions, then it seems that ouranswer will be reduced to something that does not look like anexplanation for the event at all. Plotinus has this in mind when heasserts that the only real explanation for an event is to say that itbelongs to a totality.35 The theoretical background for this kind ofproblem is sketched at VI.7.2.35, in what I will refer to as Plotinus'doctrine of simultaneous arising:36In fact just as in our universe, which subsists from a multiplicity of elements,all things are linked with each other, and the explanation for the individualconsists in its being a member of the totality (that is, just as the part in thecase of every individual is perceived in terms of its relation to the whole), it33 On the difficulties of specifying the nature of causal connection between events,see Davidson 1980.34 Putnam 1983, p. 214.35 Cf.

What this phrase means is thatalthough there may be sequences of events, these sequences are notcausal sequences. The next part of the sentence presents an alterna-tive causal theory: the cause and the effect come to be in reciprocalorigination from each other.This alternative, non-teleological method of explanation, in whichthe relationship between cause and effect is one of co-arising, showsup in the subsequent puzzles of VI.7.1-15. In VI.7.1 it appears to bethe inspiration behind the constant refrain in which the logic oftemporal sucession, T668 [A£TOI T6de,38 is denied. Rather, the sensiblearises as an immediate and necessary expression of the intelligible.Chapter 3 of VI.7 applies this theory to an analysis of soul andconcludes that soul must arise simultaneously with its sense faculties.Chapters 8 and 9 show that the objects of sense, and so the wholerealm of sentient beings, must arise simultaneously from the intelli-gible world. In chapter 10 all sentient beings must arise simultane-ously, as must the gross elements together with their inhabitants(chapter 12).In chapter 3, Plotinus applies his theory of interdependent cau-sation to the analysis of the human form: if we ask, why does manhave eyes or eyebrows, the only answer can be, iva JT&VTCX, in orderthat all things might come to be. Why should this kind of answerconstitute any kind of an explanation at all? Taking the example ofeyes first, we can see that Aristotle would certainly find this answerunsatisfactory. Since it is a part of human nature to be a sightedbeing, we have eyes because they are components without which thehuman form would be incomplete. Aristotle describes this preferredtype of explanation as follows (PA 1640a 33^4):37 Hume, book I, part III, A Treatise of Human Nature, quoted by Mackie 1974, p. 3.38 Cf. VI.7.1 37: 6 X,oYLO^6g TOUTO CXVTI TOVTO; VI.7.1.40: TOVTO, iva \\ix\\ TOUTO; VI.7.1.56: T66E[i8Ta T66E."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Plotinus' Critique of Discursive ThinkingThis is why we should for preference say (a) that man has these parts becausethis is what it is for a man to be.

There, we read that each being has itsreason why within itself, and that on a secondary level (in the orderof individuals) the form is the cause of each individual's coming tobe. Such a concession would seem to be completely in agreementwith what Aristotle says here about the preferred form of naturalexplanation. Yet in this treatise Plotinus asserts that the reason whyhuman beings have eyes is in order that everything may come to be:61a TI ovv 6q>Qdk\\ioi: iva JT&VTCX.In fact, Plotinus goes on to suggest in this treatise that not only isthe essence/accident distinction invalid, but it is so because the verydifferentia that are said in Aristotelian parlance to constitute thedefinition of something, and so to constitute its essence, are in factinessential, or strictly accidental for that substance. In this section,Plotinus pursues his attack upon essentialism by means of a favoritestrategy. He attempts to prize apart the essence/accident distinctionby showing that it has no explanatory power, and thus that theindividual substance lacks essential properites.Aristotle seems to have thought that the concept of hypothet-ical necessity could be applied to the parts of an organism,39 suchthat there were \"features of a kind that explain other features ofthat kind without themselves being explained by features of thatkind.\"40 If we say that it is part of the human essence to be a sightedbeing, then eyebrows will be necessitated given this essential struc-ture. So in this case we should be able to designate the eyebrows as<PUX(XKTIK6V and so as something that contributes to the end but is infact not the end. But then the reason for the eyebrows - the form ofman - must exist before the safeguard, since it determines that therebe a safeguard. Plotinus concludes that the safeguard is not after allcontributory to the essence, but is a part of the essence.Thus it is extremely difficult to come up with a functional analysis39 For a list of Aristotelian passages that apply a teleological analysis to the parts of anindividual organism, see Gotthelf 1987, pp. 190— 1.40 Gotthelf 1987, p. 189.39"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsof the parts of an individual in such a way that one could specifywhich elements function for the sake of others: Jt&VTa 60a exei e/oigdv eiJteiv 6I6TI eKOUJTOv (VI.7.2.44). \"One could say that all that be-longs to an individual is its reason why.\" The undermining of theconcept of definitional necessity is based upon the rejection of thedistinction between the parts of an individual that are componentsof the essence and the parts of the individual that are contributorytoward the essence. And again, Aristotelian essentialism is based onthe ability to specify what belongs to a susbstance essentially. Theerasure of the essence/accident distinction in this case seems toerode this essentialist construction.This is not to say that the Neoplatonists rejected Aristotelian logicas incapable of yielding valid results for the reasoning process.Rather, the results obtained by this process will not yield necessarypropositions about the reality that they describe.41 In V.8.7.41 weread:as if the conclusion was there before the syllogism which showed the cause,and the conclusion did not follow from the premises; [the world order] isnot the result of following out a train of logical consequences and purposivethought; it is before consequential and discursive thinking.It seems that the Stoic philosopher Poseidonius attributed theintelligibility of the world's structure to the fact that the designingintelligence, God, and human intelligence shared the same thoughtprocesses, since human souls were apospasmata of God.42 Therefore,the Stoics hold that a teleological description of the world is a factualdescription of a state of affairs that inheres within the cosmic struc-ture.43 Thus this very structure, the systematic cohesion of individuals41 A great deal of scholarly work has been devoted over the last several decades to theexposition of Plotinus' notorious critique of Aristotle's categories, presented inEnneads VI. 1—VI.3. To name but a few of the major works: Lloyd 1955-6; Lloyd1990; Wurm 1973; Strange 1981; Rist 1967, chapter 8, \"The Sensible Object\";Corrigan 1981, pp. 98-121.42 See Reinhardt, pp. 116-17.43 It is not that we find Plotinus denying Providence, but that we find Plotinus consis-tently denying what he considers to be an anthropomorphic conception of Provi-dence. Plotinus' most explicit definitions of Providence not only do not rely on anynotion of teleology, but in fact go out of their way to distinguish between teleologyand Providence. Thus in Treatise III.2, \"On Providence,\" we find what is perhaps"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Plotinus' Critique of Discursive Thinkingwithin their order of being, is understood by Plotinus as a reflectionof the inherence of our world within its intelligible cause. And thislatter, the cosmos noetos, is not systematic in the way that the physicalcosmos is.Dialectic in Treatise VI.7The exploration of teleology and paradigmatism in chapters VI.7.1-11 ends on an entirely different note. At the beginning of thistreatise, Plotinus tries to demonstrate some of the conceptual diffi-culties he has with traditional teleology, as well as to sketch analternative causal analysis of individuals. But any such theory ofcausation is open to at least the following criticism: to say that thereason why something is the way it is is simply because it is the way itis, or because it belongs to the totality of things, is perhaps to eschewphilosophical explanation altogether. This position seems philo-sophically weak and, if asserted in some dialectical contexts, leavessuch issues as theodicy entirely unanswered.Part of the problem with this explanation is that Plotinus seemsuncomfortable with the question. As he says in the treatise \"OnProvidence,\" \"What reason could [Intellect] have for making, sinceit lacks absolutely nothing?\" If Providence is a doctrine that attemptsto explain why things are the way they are in the universe, or whythe universe is as it is, then this is not a question that Plotinus iswilling to address when formulated in this way.I have been dwelling at length on Plotinus' arguments in treatiseVI.7 because of their dialectical function. Indeed, I think that Ploti-nus' notion of interdependent causation is not asserted as a doctrineat all, but is largely a dialectical device, designed to impugn or arrestPlotinus' clearest statement of his doctrine:If our doctrine maintained that the universe came to be, starting from a specificpoint of time, after previously being non-existent, then our doctrine wouldaffirm that Providence was the same [for the universe] as it is for individualthings, that is, a foreseeing and rational planning on the part of God, who[would calculate] how this universe could arise, and also how things would beas perfect as possible. But since we maintain that this universe is everlastingand has never not been, we could correctly say that Providence for the universeis its being in accord with intellect.

In our treatise, discursive thinking takes theform of a variety of philosophical explanations, culled from thehistory of prior theorizing. Plotinus seems to think that the availablemodels can never solve questions as profound as \"why are things theway they are.\" This diffidence too may seem weak, evasive, and notentirely satisfactory. If philosophy has been so unsuccessful in grap-pling with such issues, why practice it? Furthermore, one might ask,if I can't use human rationality to think about things, what otherrationality can I use? So it is of no small interest that Plotinus ends adiscussion in which he proscribes rational explanations, with a non-discursive answer to the question of how this universe came to bethe way it is. He closes this section with a visionary passage, the firstof many to be considered in this book.In this passage, Plotinus continues to ask a series of questions thatseem to demand a philosophical explanation. He starts with thequestion, where does everything come from? But this questionquickly leads to others, until finally one is left asking questions thatsimply cannot be answered by a philosophical explanation:If someone asks what is the source of sentient beings, one is also asking whatis the source of heaven there. And asking this is asking where [the Form] ofthe sentient being comes from, and this is the same as asking what is thesource of life, and of universal life, and of universal soul, and of universalintellect. (VI.7.12.15)What counts as an adequate understanding of individuals? Ploti-nus provisionally seems to suggest that we can understand the uni-verse as a kind of mutual coming-to-be, or interdependent causalnexus: sentient beings all arise together as manifestations of a worldsoul or universal form of life. But this answer is just provisional, andthe point of the passage is to suggest that once philosophical expla-nations come to an end, we are still left with work to do. Plotinusconcludes with a most surprising suggestion: the physical aspect of44 Bussanich 1997, p. 5307."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Plotinus' Critique of Discursive Thinkingliving beings, by means of which they express their individuality, canbe seen as a unity - objectively, as constituting one world body, andsubjectively, as constituting one phenomenal presentation.

Instead, these qualities shouldbe apprehended in the most general form as one unified field ofsense presentations:The emergence of [all things] is from a single source, so to speak, but thesource is not like some one particular breath or like a single feeling ofwarmth. Rather, it is as if a single quality contained all qualities in itself, andactually preserved them, so that [the quality of] sweetness [would be pre-served] together with the [quality of] fragrance, and this single quality were[to become] simultaneously the taste of wine, and all of the modes of taste,and sights of colors, and all the sensations of touch.

Are we here dealing with a formof idealism? Is Plotinus in effect suggesting that all things arise asideas in the mind? Most scholars think not, but on the surface, thisappears to be the case.47 The progress of the passage is from theobjective description of the quality, as sweetness or smell, to itsfundamental nature as a kind of awareness on the part of the per-ceiver. This passage is a description of the external world dissolvinginto the soul; in it we watch the world of objective qualities trans-muted into a world of flowing qualia.The world appears before us in this visionary passage as bereft ofindividual essences, a world whose content is apparently appropri-ated by a subject. What is more, this subject appears to view theentire cosmic panorama as its own act of awareness. Perhaps the loss45 Enneads II.6.3.

He wants to lead the mind out of its habit of looking at theworld as essentially outside of the self, as composed of a number ofobjects with discrete essences that are known in all sorts of ways, butprimarily through the senses and through thinking about essences.Plotinus attempts to weaken the claims of philosophical explana-tion as a way of luring the reader into a distance from the ordinaryworldview. Suddenly, Plotinus suggests that the world can be seen asfrom within the mind. This move, this claim about the world, isgoing to occupy Plotinus in many of the passages to be consideredin the following chapters. But it represents not a final position or anabsolute truth. It is a provisional step, designed to bring the readercloser to the world of nous, by revealing something about the natureof the soul.

As wewill see in the following chapters, because non-discursive thinkingultimately circumvents the intentional structures of thought, the in-tentional stance cannot be reified in such a way as to substitute foran objective world order.Plotinus' views on method and truth involve a rejection of essen-tialism and a generally cautionary attitude toward discursive think-ing. Some features of his anti-essentialism might lead us to think thathe does hold to a kind of subjectivism, but in what follows I wouldlike to suggest that this is not accurate. To clarify the problems withcharacterizing Plotinus as a subjectivist, I turn to a modern critiqueof subjectivism. In his book, Subjectivity, Realism, and Postmodernism,Frank Farrell points out the hidden ironies of what amounts to aself-deception implicit within Cartesian epistemology. This self-deception appears when we contrast ancient and modern Skepti-cism:Whereas the ancient skeptic recommends withholding judgment about anyproposition, his modern counterpart is skeptical about the world in a way45"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsthat he is not skeptical about the contents of inner life. Things in the worldmay be worthy of doubt in every respect, but at least my ideas give themselvesto me as what they really are, and while natural entities can no longer havenatures, the inner objects do have natures, in that it is clear to the thinkerwhat counts as the same idea reappearing.A certain disenchantment of the world, an emptying out or a loss ofcontent within the world, is the result of the unlimited enrichmentof the subject. It seems that this Demiurgic conception of the self,automatically knowing, possessing, and ascertaining the nature of itsideational creations, is the counterpart of a Promethean divisionaccording to which what formerly belonged to the world outside ofthe subject now is reappropriated by the subject.1The visionary counterpart to Plotinus' antiessentialist views,glimpsed at the end of Enneads VI.7, \"How the Forms Came intoBeing,\" might seem to augur just this unlimited expansion of thesubject, with a corresponding collapse of the world: \"the emergenceof [all things] is from a single source, as if a single quality containedall qualities in itself\" (chapter 12, lines 23-4). As Burnyeat hasshown, this danger of the idealistic subject who usurps the contentof the world seems foreign to Ancient Greek forms of idealism ingeneral and to Plotinus' noetic cosmos in particular. In Plato's Par-menides, for example, when the young Socrates suggests (Parmenides132 b4) that the Forms are thoughts and hence located in minds,Parmenides secures his agreement that such a thought must still be\"of\" an existing reality: \"What then, said [Parmenides], each Formis a thought, but is the thought [the thought of] nothing?\" \"Butthat is impossible,\" said [Socrates]. \"Then it is of something?\"\"Yes.\" \"Of something that exists or something that does not exist?\"\"Of something that exists\" {Parmenides 132 bn-ci).Plotinus too excludes any purely subjectivist tendency from hisaccount of intellect, by emphasizing the priority of Forms or Beingto intellect and by denying that a Form is a Form only when orbecause intellect is aware of it:2It is, then, incorrect to say that the Forms are thought if what is meant bythis is that when Intellect thought this particular Form came into existenceOn the Demiurgic self, see Farrell, chapter 1.On this point see Gerson 1994, chapter 3 and ft. 53, where he quotes V.9.7.14,requoted from Gerson above."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Non-discursive Thinking in the Enneadsor is this particular Form; for what is thought must be prior to this thinking[of a particular Form]. (V.9.7.14-17)Consequently, there is no impoverishment of the world implied inPlotinus' conception of the subject, and it could even be said thathis views of the subject instead entail a further enrichment andproliferation of Being. Plotinus holds both that intellect is identicalwith its object and that intellect as a whole is all the Forms (V.9.8.3-4).3 As he says of the intellectual object, \"apparently it is a part, butwhen [someone] looks into the appearance clearly, [it is] a whole,[that is, all the Forms].\" This cognitive complexity is both intersub-jective, as the intellect knows all the other intellects, as well as pro-lific, as each object is all other objects. In fact, there is no conceptualequivalent to this intersubjective realm of truth characterized bymutual entailment among the Forms.4 Hence, the structure knownby intellect is emphatically not an invention of the individual mind,but becomes available to the individual only when she has succeededin putting aside her particular point of view, or more accurately,when she has succeeded in increasing her point of view. Finally, itmust be said that Plotinus seems to think that human beings developa viewpoint that transcends the subjective when those same humanbeings fully apprehend the nature of the subject.Epistemology and IntrospectionAs Farrell has recently argued, the modern subject boasts an ancientlineage whose ancestry can be traced far beyond its incarnation inthe Cartesian res cogitans.5 Many if not most modern philosophersstart their examinations of subjectivity and the dialectics of subjectiv-ity with a critique of the Cartesian \"invention\" of the mental worldand its counterpart, the mental substance.6 Although recent work3 On the controversial translation of the second half of this clause, EKCKJTOV 6e ei&ogvovg eKaaTog, see Gerson 1994, p. 55 and ff.4 Cf.

For although the introspective stance features heavily inCartesian epistemology, in fact the \"retreat within\" as a philosophi-On the theological origins of the Cartesian subject, see Gillespie and Farrell, andespecially Hans Blumenberg, The Legitimacy of the Modern Age (Cambridge, 1983).Objections are legion. One could cite, for example, Freudian objections (the denialthat consciousness is self-transparent), methodological objections that introspectionis not an adequate way of getting at the nature of the mental, anachronistic invoca-tions of the Aristotelian psyche that seems to lack self-consciousness or any trace ofmentalism, postmodern attacks on the Cartesian universal subject as concealing apolitical position, Nietzsche's dismissive attitude toward anything like a Cartesianunity of person, linguistic objections that situate the Cartesian ego as a grammaticalcategory, and now Lacanian objections according to which the Cartesian ego merelypersonifies the embeddedness of the self in language and a symbolic order thatparadoxically instantiate its ontic failures. And one could continue to cite countlessother objections to the Cartesian self.1 See Rorty 1979, pp. 50—1 and ff. for self-transparency as the mark of the mental.Rorty, for example, demonstrates that the ancient Greek conceptions of intellect(nous) or soul (psyche) do not specify a similar distinction between the mental andthe non-mental. As Rorty says of the Cartesian subject: \"the novelty was the notionof a single inner space in which bodily and perceptual sensations, mathematicaltruths, moral values, the idea of God, moods of depressions, and all the rest of whatwe now call 'mental' were objects of quasi-observation\" (Rorty 1979, p. 55)."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Non-discursive Thinking in the Enneadscal construct precedes Descartes and is perhaps most readily visiblein a whole genre of literature that no doubt inspired Descartes withits emphasis on subjective psychology. The Stoic meditatio and theconfessional epistle, the structured self-examination of a Marcus Au-relius in his eig ecmTOv |3i|3Xiov, Seneca's Letters to Lucilius, and theChristian version of the Stoic meditation, Augustine's Confessions, allform an important background to the Meditations on First Philosophy.We know that the Stoics developed a genre of meditative litera-ture, arranged around specific exercises or thought experiments, inwhich the reader is allowed to become a spectator of his own lifethrough the act of reading.10 The confessional letters and dialoguesof Seneca, for example, trade on the premise of self-regard, whetherthat involves taking stock of one's vices or envisioning untimely ills.11As Hadot writes of the Stoic meditatio, preserved for us in the writingsof Seneca, Cicero, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius:The exercise of meditation is an attempt to control inner discourse, in aneffort to render it coherent. The goal is to arrange it around a simpleuniversal principle: the distinction between what does and does not dependon us, or between freedom and nature. Whoever wishes to make progressstrives, by means of dialogue within himself or with others, as well as bywriting, to \"carry on his reflections in due order\" and finally to arrive at acomplete transformation of his representation of the world.Examples of the readerly meditatio found in works such as the Sene-can moral epistles involve injunctions to readers to examine theirconsciences, investigate memories, and use the imagination as meansof distancing the self from the immediacy of a given emotional ormental state. Thus in Epistle 99, Seneca enjoins the audience to' 'place before your mind's eye the vast spread of time's abyss and10 On the Stoic meditation and the confessional literature it spawned, see Newman,pp. 1473-1517.11 Indeed, the Stoic use of the meditation as a literary genre seems to have done nota little to inspire the spiritual exercises of the Christian tradition that seem to bethe model for that modernist avatar of subjectivity, the Cartesian res cogitans. Thisstatement does not imply that the Cartesian meditation is essentially a replica of theAugustinian meditation. In fact, the process of introspection developed in Augus-tine's own explorations of self-knowledge is decidedly modified by Descartesthrough the latter's applications of the method of introspection as a foundation forscience.

Add to the subtrahend self-caused diseasesand the time left an idle blank. You will see that you possess fewer years thanthe calendar shows. Search your memory: how seldom you have had a con-sistent plan, how few days worked out as you intended, how seldom you haveenjoyed full use of yourself, how seldom your face wore an inartificial ex-pression, how seldom your mind was unflurried.13Here the practice of self-regard or mindfulness is illustrated througha list of contrasting states, including appetites, emotions, distrac-tions, a generally scattered condition of the mind (animus intrepidus),and concern about one's image. Self-presence as a way of life istreated here as an ascetic practice that involves primarily adjustinghabits of thinking. As Hadot writes of this virtue: \"the fundamentalattitude of the Stoic philosopher was prosoche: attention to oneselfand vigilance at every instant.\"14 Later, this kind of examination ofconscience and detailed inquiry into the nature of time as a subjec-tive flow measured by the quality of the mind's attention and con-centration becomes part of monastic practice, becoming formalizedwithin the Christian tradition of spiritual exercises that help shapethe Cartesian meditations.15 Just as the act of reading the Stoic medi-tatio creates a reflexive space for the reader that brings about a12 Seneca, Epistle 99.10, quoted by Hadot 1995, p. 182: \"Propone temporis profundivastitatem et universam complectere, deinde hoc, quod aetatem vocamus hu-manam, conpara immenso.\"13 Seneca, De Brevitate Vitae, 3.17-30.

Thusindubitability, or self-transparency, becomes both the final answer toskeptical doubts as well as the mark of the distinctively mental. TheCartesian subject was born in the throes of an epistemological di-lemma, but the philosophical necessity that attends the Cartesianinference tells us nothing about the nature of the subject whoseexistence is inferred. What is the res cogitans? Can it be apprehendedalongside the indubitable states that evince its existence, or does itremain elusive? What is the content of this Cartesian \"ego\"? Des-cartes' answer, \"a thing that thinks,\" tells us both too much and toolittle. If thinking is the act that characterizes this newly discoveredsubstance, how is it that this activity becomes a thing at all? How canwe circumscribe this individual spirit, the transcendental thing thatis posited but never apprehended by the inner gaze?17The substantive view of the res cogitans is problematic because itOn the Stoic meditatio as a readerly practice, see Newman, and on Augustine's useof meditatio as the source of his introspection, see Stock 1996. Stock's work isimportant because it shows that the act of reading, valorized by Augustine as ameans of access to the word of God incorporated in Scripture, is a ready-to-handintrospective structure employed by pagan authors and adapted to its Christian usefrom the role it played in pagan self-examination.Early critics of the Cartesian project were highly sensitive to this pitfall and tookpains to distinguish the positing of subjectivity from the category metaphysics of theres cogitans. Fichte's self-positing principle of identity, to mention one modernexample, represents a rejection of the Cartesian fallacy of the substantive subject.For Fichte, \"the act of self-establishment or self-positing constitutes the essence ofthe I, which is thereby understood not as some thing or object, but as primordialactivity\" (Redding, p. 54). Cf. also Gillespie's chapter entitled \"Fichte and the DarkNight of the Noumenal I.\" Fichte is concerned to critique the notion of self-knowledge implicit in Cartesian self-awareness when Descartes writes: \"what am Ithen, a thing that thinks?\" In other words, Fichte shows that one cannot make aninference from the nature of one's interior states to the nature of the self thatundergoes such states. He asks if the self that knows its own projections is known inthe same manner as those projections.51"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadspersonifies the introspective gaze in a move that seems entirely un-justified. We are left with several questions. First, what dialecticalpossibilities does a philosophical appeal to the subjective, or intro-spective stance, offer outside the realm of epistemology? Second,how cogent can such an appeal be, if it relies on introspection, orposits a rhetoric of immediacy, for its dialectical force? These arequestions that I attempt to answer in this book through detailedinvestigation of Neoplatonic methodologies. Nevertheless, here Iwould like to offer a provisional response that situates Plotinus' viewson self-apprehension within a larger philosophical framework.Self-perception in the Enneads - A Non-discursive ApproachIn the philosophy of the Ancient Commentators, self-perceptionbecomes an increasingly important topic within the larger project ofinterpreting Aristotle's De anima. However we should keep in mindthat although Aristotle does raise the puzzle about how it is that weperceive that we perceive, this topic does not (in Aristotle's text)imply a theory of self-consciousness.18 Rather, at the beginning of Deanima 3.2, Aristotle tries to show that the faculty of perception mustitself be responsible for the perception of perception. Modern com-mentators differ over whether, in this passage, Aristotle affirms thateach sense is also responsible for perceiving its own perception, orwhether he here continues to believe, as he says in the De somno, thatthere is a faculty of common perception that accounts for this abil-ity.19For our purposes, what is interesting is that several Neoplatonicauthors came to interpret this passage of the De anima as a referenceto self-awareness, and not to the simple perceptual awareness thatAristotle rather clearly had in mind. Certain of the later Commenta-tors20 on the De anima recognized a sixth sense, beyond the fivesenses that each has its proper sense objects, which either did or didnot coincide with an Aristotelian \"common sense.\" The name for18 For this conclusion, see Kosman 1975.19 On this topic, see Everson 1997, pp. 141-4. He contrasts his position with Modrak1987.20 For the identity of this group, see both Bernard and Lautner (who identifies the\"group\" as the Neoplatonist, Damascius!)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Non-discursive Thinking in the Enneadsthis additional mental faculty was prosektikon, from the noun prosoche(to pay attention to, to be aware of). Again, in his commentary onPlato's Phaedo, the sixth-century philosopher Damascius describesthe prosektikon as the witness of the soul, as a self-awareness thatsimply records the presence of any experience that the subject un-dergoes. As such, it transcends the usual classification according tolower and higher faculties that many Neoplatonic psychological ele-ments must fit,21 and instead is said to extend through the rationalsoul as well as the irrational soul. As we will see in more detail, forsome Aristotelian Commentators, perception of perception was nolonger a perceptual function.22 As a result, they also sometimes inter-preted perceptual awareness as a kind of cognition.In the later Neoplatonic tradition, commentators on Aristotle's Deanima seized upon III.2 (425b!2 ff.), where Aristotle discusses theissue of perceiving that one perceives. Although several of theseCommentators may be seen today as predecessors of the so-calledspiritualist interpretation of Aristotle's theory of perception,23 as forexample, Philoponus, who holds that perception consists in a \"cog-nitive apprehension of the perceptible form,\"24 what matters for mypurposes is what they had to say about self-perception. Philoponustells us of a group of interpreters25 whosay that it is the task of the attentive part of the rational soul to apprehendthe acts of the senses. For the rational soul has not only five faculties, noeticthought, discursive thought, judgment, will and choice, they add an addi-tional sixth faculty to the rational soul, which they call the attentive. Thisattentive part, they say, attends to what is going on in the person and says \"I21 For this notion of classification, see Blumenthal's earlier book and the remarks ofSheppard, \"Phantasia and Mental Images: Neoplatonist Interpretations of Deanima3.3,\" in Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy Suppl. vol. 1991, pp. 165-74.22 For this conclusion, see the conclusion to Lautner's article.23 For this somewhat stigmatizing terminology, see Everson 1997, which is an exposi-tion of Aristotle's theory of perception that sets out to show that physical explana-tions play an important role in this theory.24 Bernard, p. 158.25 Lautner 1994 identifies this \"group\" as Damascius, with the following passage inmind: In Phaedonem I.271: \"What is that which recollects that it is recollecting? Thisis a faculty which is different from all the others and is always attached to some ofthem as a kind of witness: as conscious of the appetitive faculties, as attentive to thecognitive ones.\" This translation was distributed by Lautner at the BICS 1997Summer Institute.53"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadshave thought noetically,\" \"I have thought discursively,\" \"I have been an-gry.\" So, if the attentive part is to go through all the parts of the soul, thenlet it pass through the sense as well and let it say, \"I have seen,\" . . .26Another approach is that of Pseudo-Simplicius:27 What we find in hisCommentary on the De anima is a kind of rationalization of the percep-tual faculty, so that perceiving that we perceive is distinctive of hu-man perception Perhaps the idea is that perception of perceptioninvolves a judgment of whether or not one's perception is correct,or perhaps the idea is that a propositional representation of one'sperceptions is involved. But if perception of perception is proposi-tional, then it is rational. Again, as a result of these internally utteredpropositions, self-consciousness follows from this perception of per-ception. Consequendy, self-consciousness is characteristic of the ra-tional mind only: \"Therefore to perceive that one perceives doesnot belong to every faculty of perception, but rather to the rationalfaculty alone\" (Ps.-Simpl. 290.6-8).28In this later material, we see a general reworking of the Aristote-lian source; the Commentators tend to assimilate aisthesis, or theperceptual structure that characterizes specifically non-intellectualperception, to cases of noesis of noesis, or to the intellectual structureof knowledge. For the later Commentators, perceiving that one per-ceives becomes the basis for distinguishing the human soul in totofrom the animal soul. It also serves as a more general argumentagainst the Aristotelian notion of the soul as the first actuality of aliving body,29 by becoming associated with a notion of self-reflectionthat specifically entails an incorporeal subject. For example, Philo-ponus tries to demonstrate that Aristotle fails to account for percep-26 Translated and quoted by Bernard, p. 156. Cf.

For the debate over the identity of theauthor of CAG IX, see the 1978 monograph of Carlos Steel, The Changing Self.Blumenthal criticizes identifying Pseudo-Simplicius with Priscianus (Soul and theStructure of Being in Late Neoplatonism, ed. Lloyd, Liverpool, 1982).28 For a summary of Pseudo-Simplicius' views on self-consciousness, see Blumenthal1996-29 That is, perception of perception is a topic that can create the kind of interpretivedissonance that one sees in the Commentators, since as Neoplatonists, they will alsohold that the soul is essentially disembodied.54"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Non-discursive Thinking in theEnneadstion of perception in the De anima, because any self-reflexivity mustbelong to a mental and not to a physical substance:the common sense apprehends nothing but perceptibles and all perceptiblesare in a body, that is, they subsist as compounds together with matter,whereas the act of perception is not in a body and therefore is not aperceptible.30Finally, perception of perception in the later tradition more gener-ally becomes associated with a faculty of self-consciousness that relieson a unified subject of awareness. This later tradition still falls shortof attributing to Aristotle something like a Cartesian mental self, orres cogitans; nevertheless, perception of perception is philosophicallysignificant because it becomes a foundation for notions of self-identity. In Philoponus, for example, there is an argument that self-perception is uniquely grounded in the unity of the perceiving sub-ject: 'Tor if one part apprehended this, and another that, that wouldbe equivalent as he himself [sc. Aristotle] says in a different context,to your perceiving this and my perceiving that. Hence the attentive[part] must be one\" (Philoponus 465, 1, ff.).The promotion of empirical self-awareness to a philosophicallysignificant issue allowed the tradition to formulate the concept ofrational perception or of a transcendent faculty of awareness. But itstopped short of the strong Cartesian sense of the res cogitans, nodoubt because indubitability was not attributed to this new faculty.Descartes' substantive view of the res cogitans is problematic becauseit personifies the introspective gaze-the mind is simply that whichreports on states of mind. The notion of the mind has becomehostage to this privileged introspective stance that has left us withthe notion of a subjectively discoverable self and, consequently, aninsuperable mind-body dualism. In the terms of this dualism, \"Iappear to myself as a single, unified subjective self, faced by a multi-farious composite objective world.\"3130 Bernard paraphrasing Philoponus. On the argument from self-reflection to incor-poreal nature of the self, see Gerson 1997. Also, for Aristotle's own difficulties inaccounting for the possibility of self-perception as a feature of the aisithetikon,especially if his theory of sensation is taken to be grounded in physical explanations,see Everson 1997, chapter 4, \"The Perceptual System.\"31 Priest, p. 82.55"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Language in the EnneadsTo summarize, if the self can be apprehended as the subject of allmental states, that is, if the self is introspectively available, then weare dealing with a self-reflexive theory of identity. As Gasche de-scribes the process:The theory of reflection is characterized by the assumption that the cognitivesubject becomes a self-relating subject by making itself an object for itself.The identity that springs forth from such an activity is a result of turningthat kind of attention originally directed upon objects back upon the know-ing subject itself.32Now the problem with this way of formulating self-reflection is thatit posits the self that knows as itself an object of self-consciousness.Thus, the self itself becomes an object for the self. But the subjec-tively apprehending self cannot be an object of perception in thesame way that objects of perception are. To think this is to equateself-knowledge with self-perception, and this is a mistake, at leastaccording to Plotinus (see the next section). In the Enneads, Plotinusexplicitly proscribes this tendency to make the self an object of theself. Plotinus does not think that self-knowledge has the same struc-ture as self-perception.33Self-perception versus Self-knowledge: The EnneadsTurning now to the Enneads, it is worth attempting to sort out thedifference between perception of perception and self-knowledge.One strong motivation for doing so is the difficulty of Plotinus'somewhat inconsistent, but highly distinctive, vocabulary of self-reflection. Plotinus does use the word \"sunaisthesis\" when referringto the intellect's knowledge of its own contents.34 The AristotelianCommentators used this word to describe self-perception, followingthe Stoic tradition. But Plotinus also has developed a very precisevocabulary of reflection and tends to use the word parakolouthesis32 Gasche, p. 61.33 Here I acknowledge the conclusion to Gerson 1997. Gerson also makes the pointthat self-knowledge is not, in the Enneads, primarily the knowledge of [an empiri-cally available] self.34 Cf. V.8.11.24: \"If therefore sight is of something external we must not have sight,or only that which is identical with its object. This is a sort of intimate understandingand perception of a self that is careful not to depart from itself by wanting toperceive too much.\" On Plotinus' use of sunaisthesis, see Graeser 1972, chapter 7."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Non-discursive Thinking in the Enneadswhen he refers specifically to self-consciousness, or being aware thatone is aware.35 In ordinary consciousness, the mind is simply en-gaged with knowing its object. The thought, \"I am now engaged inknowing this object,\" seems to be a superfluous event, as if to splitthe mind's focus between the object of awareness and an intentionalstate that captures the features of this awareness. Hence, Plotinususes parakolouthesis both of this kind of superfluous intentionalityand of any kind of accidental predication. In other words, for Ploti-nus self-consciousness is more or less an accident of awareness. Ashas been frequently pointed out, Plotinus seems to think that ordi-nary consciousness entails self-consciousness, but that the act of turn-ing one's ordinary consciousness into a further intentional object isa kind of falling short of awareness. To be aware that one is engagedin the act of knowing an object is to be distracted by a differentobject of awareness as well as to be excessively removed from theobject with which one is engaged.36In treatise V.3 Plotinus articulates the structure of self-knowledgealong the lines of a response to Skeptic attacks that attempt to drivea wedge between the self's identity as either subject or object in theact of self-apprehension. That is, Plotinus refutes the Skeptics' argu-ment against self-knowledge by refusing to grant the major premiseof their argument, that is, that self-knowledge is a case of self-perception. Plotinus overturns the Skeptical objections by refusingto grant that the self can be an object of any kind.Self-division is impossible. How will it divide itself? It cannot do so ran-domly. In fact who is it that does the dividing? Is it the person identifyingwith the subject of vision or the person identifying with the object? Thenagain how will the subject recognize himself as the object if he identifieshimself as the subject? (V.3.3)It is important to see that self-knowledge cannot be equated withperception, since the self is not an object of knowledge, according toPlotinus. Plotinus' intellect is not directed toward any intentionalstates and has no intentional object: ''the being of intellect consistsin an activity that is not directed toward anything\" (V.3.7.19)37Moreover, it is neither the subject nor the predicate within any35 See Smith 1978.36 See Smith 1978 for all of this.37 On Plotinus' critique of intentionality, see Emilsson and Rappe in Gerson 1996.57"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsordinary grammatical structure:38 when it affirms, \"I am this,\" if theword \"this\" refers to something other than the self, it will be sayingwhat is false.Again, it is important to emphasize the difference between Ploti-nus' views on self-reflection and the stance that results from thephenomenological epoche of the modern, subjectivist self. For Bren-tano and his influential student, Husserl, intentionality just is thepredominant characteristic of the mental:Every mental phenomenon is characterized by what the scholastics of theMiddle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object, andwhat we might call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a con-tent, direction toward an object or immanent objectivity. (Brentano, Philoso-phy from an Empirical Standpoint, p. 88)39By contrast, what emerges in Plotinus' representation of the self isthe difficulty of demarcating a realm of the mind, a realm in whichthe subject, or \"I,\" finds itself clearly delineated as a self-containedspace that is over against an object or objects. The reason for thisdifficulty is that Plotinus does not admit that the intellect's thoughtsare intentional, that is, directed toward objects:We allocated to [discursive reason the ability to] reflect upon what is exter-nal to it and to meddle in external matters, but we take it that it is basic tointellect to reflect upon its own nature and what belongs to its own nature.(V.2.3.17)To summarize, then, Plotinus does admit that self-knowledge is pos-sible and even necessary (cf. V.3 and V.5), but he does not thinkthat self-knowledge is equivalent to self-perception or to self-consciousness. Not only is it the case that the self cannot be anintentional object for the self, it is also the case that the intellectdoes not engage in intentional thinking.One perhaps surprising starting point for getting at Plotinus'views on the nature of self-awareness, is to examine Plotinus' conceptof apatheia. Recently a scholar has written that apatheia cannot beconsidered the telos of Plotinian ethics in the way that it can be forStoic ethics.40 Stoic apatheia refers to a lack of emotional reactivity,38 On the Cartesian subject as a grammatical place holder, see Kenny and Zizek.39 Quoted in Priest, p. 59.40 Bussanich, 1992."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Non-discursive Thinking in the Enneadsand so it coincides with the optimal rational response to the worldthat is the province of the sage's special knowledge.Plotinus' version of apatheia implies the negation of more thansimply the emotions. Although it does continue to have some ethicalforce (the mind is to be purified of emotions, passions, and falseopinions), apatheia becomes part of Plotinus' vocabulary of self-reflection. Indeed, the notion of apatheia is central to Plotinus' for-mulation of the problem of subjective identity. This concept doesnot capture the difference between emotional and rational states ofmind, but rather between the mind conceived as insular, or self-enclosed, and the mind conceived as intersubjective, or public.For Plotinus, far from being an emotion, a pathos is an event thatrenders the mind subject to conditions imposed from without. Sucha condition erodes or infringes on the autonomy of the mind, itsself-determination, self-awareness, and self-attention. Hence apatheiarefers to the original condition of the mind, before it comes to beoccupied with the transitory objects of awareness that concern it inits embodied state. Again, apatheia is not only a moral condition ofthe mind, since a pathos is any event or experience to which themind is subject. Apatheia seems to imply a mind not subject to expe-rience, one that undergoes no conditioning.What is it that makes an experience a pathos, an event to whichthe mind is subject? The Stoic distinction between a representationand assent to that representation (between phantasia and katathesis)would be one way of capturing the difference between a pathos andan action, or rather activity, the latter being presumably a mentalevent that is not caused by any external source. In Stoic psychology,41the mind is passively subject to presentations when something ap-pears to be the case. However, the rational mind is uniquely respon-sible for agreeing to or withholding assent from the content of thatappearance. Apatheia for the Stoics involves vigilance in the processof testing the truth values of one's representations. Yet Plotinus'formulation of the concept is still more radical.In treatise III.6.5, Plotinus raises the question that his successorseventually found unsurmountable given the terms of Plotinus' for-mulations: if the soul is originally not subject to passions (as Plotinusmaintains, despite all empirical evidence to the contrary) then why41 See Long, \"Representation and the Self in Stoicism,\" in Everson 1991.59"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsdoes it need to be purified by means of philosophy? Plotinus' (typi-cally paradoxical) answer is that the soul does not need to be puri-fied, if we mean that the mind can truly be subject to passion. A stateof mind that initially functions as a passion (that is, seems to comefrom outside the mind and has a force that brings about other statesof a mind as a result of its own presence) can be re-investigated. Thisstate that seems to arise from an external source (the legomenon, or\"so-called passion,\" as Plotinus puts it) is actually an activity of thesoul. Thus it can be redescribed as an energeia, an activity.42In the first part of III.6.5, Plotinus alludes to a Stoic notion,according to which a pathos is a disturbance that is caused by apresentation, as for example the appearance of an expected evil thatcan give rise to the passion fear. Now, according to Plotinus, the roleof reason is to eradicate, not the passion (as per the Stoic position),but the presentation altogether, since if the presentation is removed,the emotion it triggers will no longer be able to arise. As Plotinustheorizes: \"it is as if someone, wishing to remove the images thatarise from a dream should cause the dreaming mind to wake up,and should then say that the mind caused the passions, meaningthat whatever the soul saw [in its dream] was only apparently exter-nal\" (III.6.5.10). Plotinus concludes that one should just \"leave thesoul alone\" and not allow it \"to gaze at another.\"Elsewhere, Plotinus suggests that anytime the mind simply looksat another thing, it is necessarily either enthralled by that object orsubject to it. Thus to be aware of an external object is to be subjectto passion, in the sense that a pathos is an adventitious event. In VI. 1.,\"On the Kinds of Being,\" Plotinus describes passion as a state thatis characterized by its displacement by another state. We might sayFor a much fuller discussion of the differences between energeia and pathos inPlotinus' theory of perception, see Emilsson 1988, chap. 7. Emilsson considersPlotinus' rejection of the Aristotelian notion, which has sense-perception involvinga passive potential, on the part of the percipient, to become the object perceived.This rejection follows from Plotinus' denial that there is such a thing as a passivepotency (Emilsson 1988, p. 127; Enneads II.5.1.21-24). Emilsson goes on to con-sider why perception is conceived of as purely active; why, for example, does Ploti-nus think that an agent is not affected by his own act of perception? Emilssonquotes Enneads III.6.2.35-6, \"the act [of vision] is not an alteration but simultane-ously approaches what it has,\" in support of his interpretation, according to whichthe soul's prior possession of the Forms is required for sense-perception (Emilsson1988 p. 135).60"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Non-discursive Thinking in the Enneadsthat a passion is ontologically fungible. Although the Stoic concep-tion of pathos also involves a distinction between what happens to aperson and what a person actually does,43 Plotinus seems to insist onan indifference to ordinary objects of awareness that goes beyondthe Stoic conception. Thus, for example, in V.3.6.36, Plotinus scornsthe practical intellect because, being practical, it ''looks to the out-side and does not stay in itself.\" In V.3.7, in the course of explainingwhat the activity of intellect is like, Plotinus gives us a gloss on themeaning of the word energeia (activity) since the function of intellectis pure energeia:For those for whom the essence is not potential, but actual, there is a uniqueand appropriate activity that consists in a resting from other things.Therefore, the essence of such things is activity, and yet it is an activity directedtoward nothing.In this very striking statement, we get an equation between energeia,as activity that has no direction or object, and knowing, which is self-directed. Plotinus here demands a radical segregation of the mindfrom any external object and yet, at the same time, denies that themind can really be present to an external object. An object that isapparently external is somewhat like a dream image. Just as thedreamer is the source of all the impressions that appear to be outsidethe self represented in the dream, so all objects encountered by themind are only apparently external. The way to achieve apatheia isdescribed by Plotinus as \"turning away\" from external images, or as43 For an excellent discussion of the difficulties implicit within the Stoic definition ofpathos, see Hankinson 1992. Hankinson notes that Galen, who dissented fromChrysippus' definition of pathos, recognized a certain flexibility in the concept. Hecites Galen's example of cutting. Note Plotinus at VI. 1.19.15 also uses this stockexample and finds that the Peripatetic categories of action and passion are inher-ently confusing: \"In the case of cutting, the cutting that comes from the one doingthe cutting and the cutting that is present in the one who is being cut, are one, andyet cutting and being cut are different.\" Plotinus applies this difficulty to cases ofpassive affection when the agent is apparently affected by his own activities: \"whathappens if someone becomes heated as a result of a thought being entertained byhim, or becomes angered by an opinion held by him, and there is no externalinfluence?\" (VI. 1.21.10—11). The conclusion to this discussion in treatise VI. 1seems to anticipate the interpretation I have presented here, namely, that often thesame alteration can be considered either a passive affection or an activity: \"beingthe self-same motion, from one point of view, it will be an action, while fromanother point of view it will be an affection'' (VI. 1.22.12-13)."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneads\"refusing to see them,\" or as \"not paying attention to them,\" or as\"waking up\" (III.6.5.i5.ff.).Are we here encountering a kind of phenomenological epoche\"?What does it mean for Plotinus to insist that the mind not be allowedto look at any objects? Plotinus does call intellect \"the seer\" - is hesuggesting that the self is some kind of watchful, \"fleshless eye\"? Ithink not, but here one needs a bit of background on Plotinus' owntheory of perception.44 Plotinus was followed by subsequent Neopla-tonists in holding that that the mind actually projects the formsencountered in sense-perception.As Priscianus has it:the soul has the form of the perceived object by the projecting of its logos,but not as receiving from it [the object] some shape or impression as froma seal.Or again, as we read in Simplicius:45The other cognitive activities obtain their perfection from ther own beingand project the form of their object of themselves, but that of sensationrequires also the object sensed which lies outside in order to project activelythe form of that object. (In De anima 165, 29)For Plotinus as well as for the later Neoplatonists, what appears tobe external is due to the projective activity of the soul. Hence apathos, insofar as it can be denned as an event whose cause is exteriorto the person, can be redefined as energeia, as an event whose causeis the person, that is, her act. Thus the mind exercises its projectivepowers even when engaged in perception and should more correctlybe described as acting rather than as suffering. However, to theextent that its object is conceived of as external, the mind will con-tinue to suffer.In Plotinus' example of the dream, the dreamer realizes that thedreamer himself projects the phantasmata seen in the dream. Oncehe realizes this fact about his own creations, he is no longer subjectto them. What goes on is the assimilation of experience to self-44 See again Emilsson's monograph for a thorough discussion of this theory of percep-tion.45 Cf. also Proclus: \"Therefore, there is a capacity of the soul which is superior to thesense and does not cognize the sense-object through the sense organs but throughitself and thus rectifies the dullness of the sense\" (/T250, 12, Lautner trans.)."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Non-discursive Thinking in the Enneadsawareness: I seem to be undergoing an experience, but a certainkind of self-awareness on my part, namely, wakefulness, makes itclear that I underwent no such experience and indeed precludes myundergoing the experiences to which I am subject in the dreamstate.In the conclusion to this chapter, I will suggest that self-reflectioncan refer to a \"reversal of thought,\" as Plotinus is accustomed tosaying (V.5.11.11). In the example of the dream, the dreamer onawaking discovers that objects are projected in the dream state. Onecan say that to discover oneself as the dreamer, or source of thedream images, is equivalent to self-awareness. It is in this sense thatPlotinus can say that the activity of nous is not directed toward anyobject and is instead directed toward itself. That is, the mind has akind of awareness about the nature of its objects. At the same time,Plotinus displays no tendency to conflate awareness of perceptionwith intellectual self-knowledge. Ordinary awareness does not equatewith self-knowledge, even though such ordinary awareness carrieswith it as an accidental feature an aspect that might be called self-consciousness. Rather, his discussion of apatheia allows Plotinus tosuggest that the mind often has a tendency to become lost in theobjects of awareness. And this tendency distracts the mind from trueself-knowledge.Still we must ask, how cogent is Plotinus' theory of self-reflection?We have already seen that Plotinus does not succumb to a reductivetheory, according to which the self can be denned as a transparentsubstance that accurately reports all of its states. Again, Plotinus findsthat some of these states are inherently uninteresting, and he alsofinds that certain states do escape notice and do so on a regularbasis.46 More telling however, is the objection that self-transparencywould not be coherent if defined in this way. For to be aware of theself as an object is not true self-transparency. Thus although Plotinusdoes say that the intellect is self-transparent, he can not mean thatthis self-transparency equates with the subjective awareness of thecontents of one's mind.See Smith for the topic of degrees of self-awareness in Plotinus' thinking. The ideathat one can be more or less self-conscious and that this kind of experience isadventitious to the cognitive activities of intellection and discursive thinking ishighly developed in Enneads."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Language in the EnneadsWhat kind of self-transparency is in question here? How does themind come to self-knowledge? Later Neoplatonists distinguished be-tween probole, the projective power of the mind, and prosbole, theunitive power of the mind. Thus prosbole is a type of attention thatbrings the mind back to its origins and hence to its own contents.Plotinus demands a kind of ultimate privacy from the person whowishes to gain self-knowledge. He demands an activity of the mindthat is entirely self-directed. * 'We have no perception of what is ourown, and since we are like this we understand ourselves best whenwe have made our self-knowledge one with ourselves\" (V.8.11). Per-ception and intellection, it turns out, will not be analogous, which iswhy there is no such thing as self-perception, for Plotinus. If any-thing, self-knowledge will involve an entirely different kind of activitythan that involved in perception. Primarily, Plotinus characterizesintellectual activity as objectless knowing.We allocated to [discursive reason the ability to] reflect upon what is exter-nal to it and to meddle in external matters, but we take it that it is basic tointellect to reflect upon its own nature and what belongs to its own nature.(V.2.3.17)Thus even if intellect is primarily oriented toward the Good, andonly secondarily toward the Forms, Plotinus tells us that the per-fection of intellectual activity consists in achieving a kind of knowl-edge that is entirely free of objects: \"It must see that light by whichit is enlightened: for we do not see the sun by another light thanhis own. How then can this happen? Take away everything!\"(V.3.17-35)-One problem with my emphasis in this chapter on the objecdessawareness of nous is its incompleteness; I have not given due consid-eration to the objects of intellect, the noemata, that are identical withthe acts of intellect. The subject-object dichotomy is to some extentmaintained in the intelligible world, as many texts in the Enneadsremind us that the nous in fact contemplates an object that is multi-faceted, complex, and endlessly diverse.47 Nevertheless, the intellec-47 Enneads, V.3.1.1-15; VI.7.12; V.9.6.8.

Searle defines intentional states as directed toward states of affairs in the"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Non-discursive Thinking in the Enneadstual object is not outside the intellect: \"Grant that intellect containsthe real beings and contains all within itself, not as if they were in aplace, but as containing itself and being one with them\" (V.9.6.1-5). These remarks constitute a succinct account of Plotinus' episte-mology, a theory that posits an intersubjective world of autonomousminds, each contemplating all the Ideas as well as the other minds.48I have not here been concerned with the epistemological conse-quences of this doctrine, nor have I treated it as a theoretical con-struct that answers epistemological questions, such as how to accountfor the infallibility of intellectual activity.49 Instead, I have been con-cerned with Plotinus' psychology of contemplation, which is to say,the activity of the human psyche as it engages in theoria.Plotinus sometimes speaks about the soul's \"native activity\":when soul looks into intellect, it possesses what it has from within and itsthoughts and activities are native to it. And these alone are what one shouldcall the activities of the soul, namely those that are intellectual and fromwithin the soul. But the inferior states of the soul are pathe, received fromoutside; [they belong to the] soul when it [undergoes] this kind of experi-ence. (EnneadsV. 1.^.16—20)50Soul attains to its native activity in the process of detaching fromexternal objects, as we just saw. Therefore, in this chapter, the con-cept of objectless awareness contrasts primarily with the more usualworld, thus rejecting a referential theory of language based on simple notions ofnaming. As Emilsson writes in his 1996 article, speaking of the \"thoughts\" (noe-mata) that intellect has:These thoughts are not thoughts of something else nor are they true becausethey agree with some other reality against which they may be tested. On thecontrary, they constitute reality. Hence, they are not true in the ordinary sensewhich takes truth to consist in a correspondence between a proposition orthoughts and reality. Nevertheless, these thoughts may also be said to be truein the sense that through them something is known, namely these thoughtsthemselves. So if forced to explicate what the thoughts \"say\" and \"to whom,\"the answer must be that they make their own content known to Intellect. ButIntellect, we have seen, is just these thought acts.48 For an account of Plotinus' intersubjective epistemology see Gerson 1994, chapter4, \"Truth and the Forms.\"49 For the epistemological implications of Plotinus' identity thesis, see Emilsson 1993.50 On this passage, see the commentary of Atkinson 1983, who contrasts the \"native\"activity of the soul, for which Plotinus uses the word oikeion, denoting likeness tothe object, with the identity of knower and known in actual intellectual contempla-"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsactivity of the soul in which the soul pays attention to various inten-tional objects, to pathe, or conditioned states of consciousness.

My purpose in this chap-ter has been to suggest that the introspective stance invoked withinPlotinus' contemplative psychology does not presage the Cartesianreification of the self qua thinker, for Plotinus cannot, unlike Des-cartes, reify the introspective stance. Quite the opposite actuallyoccurs, since Plotinus wishes the mind to desist from its usual activity,that is, to desist from thinking discursively. As a result of this changein the direction of awareness, far from reifying the thinker, thesubject of thought discovers that it is not a thing at all. The nextchapter will be concerned with this contemplative psychology, focus-ing particularly on the topic of introspection.51 Enneads 1.4.10.8: avaKafiJTTOVTg TOU vorpaTog.52 Enneads I.4.10.13-14: JtepL tyuxr|v f\\ovyvay ^iev dyovTog TOU ev fpiv TOIOIJTOU, a) e[Aqpaiv£TOiTO TT]5 &iavoi,ag.53 Enneads I.4.10.16-17: KCCL OLOV ato6T]Ta)g YWO)OK£TOI JXETO Tf|g JtpoTepag yvcbaecog, OTI 6 vofigKcd f] 6i(Woia Eve66"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Introspection in the Dialectic of the EnneadsIn this chapter, my theme is introspection: how does it function inPlotinus' dialectic, what are some of the philosophical issues associ-ated with it, and most importantly, how does Plotinus think it can bepracticed?

Prior toDescartes, people had intellects capable of grasping immaterial, uni-versal truths, but ever since Descartes, people have had minds. TheCartesian mind's great virtue consists in its incorrigibility: it is indu-bitably aware of any given experience as evidenced within conscious-ness.This concept of personhood privileges two features of the mentallife, that is, the mind's self-transparency and the privacy of mentalstates. For any state that the mind is in, the subject of consciousness,upon introspection, cannot doubt the existence of that state. More-over, the access that the subject of consciousness enjoys with regardto her own inner states is private: only the subject can know withcertainty that she is in a particular mental state.6 Cartesian subjectiv-ity and self-consciousness are the two pillars upon which epistemol-ogy in the modern era has been reconstructed: along with this privi-leging of the subjective point of view coincides the invention ofsubjective truth.7Prior to Descartes, the ancient Skeptical tradition capitalizedupon strategies that maximized the opacity of the the external worldvis-a-vis the perceiving subject. In their ad hoc replies to the positiv-istic epistemological constructions of the Stoa, academic Skepticsregularly argued as follows: how each of the external objects appearswe can perhaps say, but how it is in its nature we cannot assert.8Descartes' Meditations, for the first time in history, presents us with a4 For these two criteria as the defining attributes of personhood, see Gill.

Whatever such argu-ments show about knowledge of external reality, we can retreat tothe newly recognized inner reality, and refute the claim that we knownothing on the ground that at least we know these newly recognizedfacts about subjective appearances.\"10 For modern critics of the Car-tesian project, Descartes' problem lay in his confusion between em-ploying the criterion of incorrigibility (that is, using the cogito) toprove the existence of the person and employing this same criterionto determine the essence of the person as mental.We also find that in the Neoplatonic tradition, the possibility ofself-knowledge is treated as a proof or demonstration that the self isincorporeal. For example, Proposition 15 of Proclus' Elements of The-ology states that \"everything that is capable of reverting upon itself isincorporeal.\" Now despite the parallelism of this text to the Carte-sian distinction between res extensa and res cogitans as resting uponthe criterion of self-transparency, the meaning of \"reversion\" in theNeoplatonic tradition does not share the Cartesian conceit of mentalstates that are incorrigibly transparent.Plotinus does think that, at the highest level of identity, self-knowledge is not only certain, but actually necessary.

First, Plotinus is sensitive to the empiricalfalsity of the claim that mental states are apprehended incorrigiblywithin consciousness; he recognizes that there can be a fairly widegulf between mental processes and the conscious awareness of thoseprocesses.11 Second, for Plotinus, Cartesian incorrigibility is funda-mentally representational in nature, since all discursive activity of themind, such as thought or perception, introduces a representationalgap between the knower and the object known.The intellect, as the subject or seat of all such representations,cannot fathom itself as an object of thought or of perception: self-awareness does not constitute self-knowledge eo ipso.12 If self-knowledge is to be valid, it must be able to circumvent the inten-tional structure in which objects are normally represented toconsciousness. For Plotinus, any conceptual representation of the selfor subject of consciousness can never be complete and can neversucceed in conveying the self that it purports to represent. Thefallibilism of any such conveyance is a consequence of Plotinus' moregeneral theory of knowledge according to which truth cannot beascertained by means of linguistic or conceptual representations. Itcan be apprehended only when there is an identity between theknower and the known.1311 This is a topic that I will not be exploring in this chapter, since much excellentwork on the ideas of consciousness and quasi-consciousness has been done byWarren. But cf. Enneads IV.4.5.20 for an instance of Plotinus pointing out that self-consciousness does not necessarily attend the various thoughts or experiences thatthe mind might entertain at a given time.12 On the association of incorrigibility with the Cartesian subject of consciousness, seeGill 1991 andWilkes 1991.13 An interesting parallel to the critique of self-representation as equivalent to self-knowledge developed here may be found in Kant: \"the simple representation I, foritself empty of all content, which can never be said to be a concept, but only a pureconsciousness which accompanies all concepts\" (Critique of Pure Reason, A346.Quoted in Marion, p. 57)."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Introspection in the Dialectic of the EnneadsIncorrigible ArgumentsIn the last section, I considered incorrigibility as the foundation ofCartesian epistemology.

Ac-cording to Descartes, if we are aware of our states of mind, then weare aware of or know ourselves. I also suggested that Plotinus doesnot invoke the incorrigibility of self-awareness in order to sustain aconception of the immaterial self, since the self cannot be knowndiscursively. In what follows I will show that, contrary to the opinionof many scholars, Plotinus does develop an argument from incorri-gibility in defending the possibility of self-knowledge, although hedoes not do so for the sake of an epistemological project. In fact,Plotinus' interest in subjectivity stems more from the aspiration forself-realization than from the aspiration for certainty.14The problem for Plotinus is not simply whether the self can beknown, but more importantly, how can the self be known? If themind attempts to represent itself to itself, then it is still trading in anepistemological distance brought about the distinction betweenmind as subject and any of its possible objects. This is a problem thatPlotinus explores in his treatise V.2.(49), \"On the Knowing Hypos-tases and On What Is Beyond.\"The very first line of the treatise begins by asking whether or nota simple entity can know itself, and this is a loaded question.

One of them he calls the doctrine of conscientia, which is a formalaccount or proof of the incorrigibility of consciousness. Thus Descartes, accordingto Lloyd, would have us believe that \"the proposition that I know I am sad and theproposition that I am aware it is I who am sad are deducible from the propositionthat I am sad.\" Now Lloyd differentiates this from another notion of self-knowledge,self-knowledge as a kind of inner sense, which primarily has psychological force.This second notion is associated in the Platonic tradition with gnothi seauton, and istied to the doctrine of the \"god within,\" in religious texts.

In chapter 2, lines 2-5, for example, we encounter thefamiliar Skeptical complaint that sensation encounters only the ex-ternal world. Plotinus here would admit that mental states such asperception are subject to correction, since perceptual objects areoutside of the perceiving faculty. But what is especially interesting isthat the body now becomes quite explicitly a part of the externalworld: even when the soul perceives the body's internal processes,these are still external to the perceiving subject.This delineation of the person as the soul, and more specifically,as the subject of awareness, is in keeping with Plotinus' enunciationelsewhere of what belongs properly to the body of the world soul,the physical universe. Plotinus clearly states that the individual en-souled body is a part of the cosmos whose growth and decay arecontrolled by the soul of nature, or by the world soul. For example,the nutritive power of the soul is actually a contribution to theembodied human being from the world soul.15Now the ancient Skeptics not only denied that there could beknowledge of the external world, they also denied the possibility ofself-knowledge. We find in Sextus Empiricus a series of argumentsdesigned to impugn the possibility of self-knowledge: the soul cannotknow itself as a whole or as a part, for either the subjective side orthe objective side would have to disappear.16 Plotinus, in refutingthese arguments,17 proceeds by means of a hierarchy of increasingself-awareness, beginning with sense-perception and ending with in-tellectual self-knowledge.Can the faculty of discursive thought have knowledge of itself? Isthe thinker, qua thinker, self-transparent? This question is of greatimportance if we want to know whether or not Plotinus thinks thatwe can construct an argument that proves that the self can knowitself. Can we use reason to demonstrate that we are, by naturerational beings, that we are, in Descartes' words, ''things that think\"?Definitely not, according to Plotinus. Self-knowledge, if it exists atall, must be prior to the deliverances of discursive thought. Here we15 EnneadsV.9-3-27.

These are aboutthings other [than themselves] and are not identical with the reali-ties [that they signify].\" (V.5.1.38-40)Thought, in representing states of affairs, may specify exactlywhich states of affairs are necessary for the veridicality of its asser-tions, although it obviously fails as a guarantor for such conditions.Of course thinking that things are thus-and-so is not identical totheir being thus-and-so, in most circumstances. The point seemsalmost too obvious to belabor, and yet it is a point that Plotinusrepeatedly stresses when discussing the ontological concomitants ofdiscursive thought. Apparently, what crucially distinguishes mentalstates from acts of the intellect is that the former are directed towardparticulars in the world, while the latter are not. To borrow a bit ofmodern jargon, one might say that one of the most salient character-istics of discursive thought is its intentionality, the fact that it is aboutobjects that are other than itself.18Actually, when Plotinus describes discursive thinking he associatesit with two distinctive modes of alterity: conceptual alterity, or tran-sition from one concept to another, and ontological alterity, or thenon-identity of the thinking subject with the object of thought. Thelatter dominates his discussion of the topic. In III.8.6, for example,Plotinus again contrasts intellectual knowledge, in which the identitybetween knower and known prevails, with discursive thinking:\"[Soul] is other than its object, and has a discursive awareness thatsees as if it were one thing gazing at another.\" (1.24)As has been frequently pointed out, Plotinus borrows the lan-guage of Aristotle's discussion at De anima III.8 concerning the iden-tity of knowledge and its objects,19 where Aristotle delineates twopossible ways in which the mind can be identical with its objects. Itcan be identical with the object itself qua hylomorphic compound,or it can be identical with the Form, abstracted from the compositeCf. Searle 1983, p. 1: \"Intentionality is that property of many mental states andevents by which they are directed at or about objects and states of affairs in theworld.\"De anima 43 lai: TO 6'af>T6 eanv f) KaT'evfepyeiav 8maTtf|fir| TU> jipfry^aTi.73"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadssubstance. Aristotle chooses the latter possibility.20 He further stipu-lates that the mind \"thinks the forms by means of mental images\"21in order to represent its objects (whether they be perceptual orconceptual). Plotinus, following Aristotle, agrees that thinking in theordinary sense involves mental representations of the Forms: \"thediscursive mind making a judgment about sense impressions has asimultaneous awareness of the Forms\" (I. 1.9.17-21). Nevertheless,Plotinus' account of epistemic identity diverges from Aristotle's. Ac-cording to Plotinus, the mind's ability to entertain a representationof the Form does not render the mind identical with its intelligibleobject. Discursive thought still sees its objects as substantively distinctfrom itself. It either gazes outside at the world and discovers thesensible object or gazes within toward the Forms and discovers theconceptual object. At its best, to be sure, the mind provides, inPlotinus' words, a kind of \"partnership\" between the inner and theouter,22 but discursive thinking is always inherently directed towardsome object.In treatise V.2, Plotinus denies that this same discursive structureis present when the intellect knows its objects. The question thenbecomes, does intellect know only its objects, or does it also (neces-sarily) know itself?23 Plotinus' answer to this question is a resoundingyes, but our task is to trace the path by which he arrives at it.Initially it seems that Plotinus has just raised more problems thanhe is able to solve. We have already seen how eager Plotinus is toadmit the Skeptical strategy of denying that there can be knowledgeof an object that is external to the knower. In chapters 1 and 3 ofour treatise, we learn that the intellect does not have these problems:it is aware of \"what is in it\" and, presumably, whatever is in intellect,TO aio8TiTiK6v KCXL TO emarri^oviKOV &uv&^iei TCWTa EGTI, TO ^iev emaTriTOv TO 6Ealo0T]T6v. av&yKT] 6' f\\ on&Ta f\\ TO.

But why, one could insist, isit necessary that it know itself? Plotinus takes up this question in avery early treatise, V.g(4), where, according to one commentator, heinvokes an Aristotelian conception of energeia to demonstrate thenecessity for the mind's self-knowledge. According to this Aristote-lian doctrine, intellect is pure intellectual activity; hence, intellectnecessarily engages in knowing: TTJ otoia wv ev^pysia (De anima 430a18). At V.9.5.5 and following, Plotinus apparently alludes to thisAristotelian description of nous as pure actuality: TOV evepyeia KCXL delvoDv OVTOLSo far, this dialectical approach to Plotinus' arguments for self-knowledge has yielded a structure that rests upon formal ontologicalprinciples.25 There appear to be no ancestral traces of Cartesianincorrigibility, which rests upon an appeal to the self-evidence of thecogito. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that a hallmark of Ploti-nus' procedure for solving epistemological questions especially, isthe largely introspective nature of his arguments.26At V.3.6 Plotinus associates his demonstration of the mind's self-knowledge with some form of philosophical necessity: \"Has then ourFor this strategy, see Lloyd 1964: \"Neoplatonists argued regularly that the mind orthought can think of itself because the identity of nous and noeton implies that everynous is also an on, or noeton; and they were only repeating Aristotle's unsatisfactorysolution in De anima III of the traditional aporia.\"According to Lloyd, the Neoplatonic demonstration of the necessity for mind's self-knowledge rests upon the metaphysical commitment that thought and its object areone in intellect and so is a formal account.See Smith 1978, pp. 104-5: Smith discusses the concept of enhorasis, an intuitiveapproach to metaphysical thinking, and in particular the appeal to intuition inIII.7.5: \"The verb (enhoratai) is a favorite with Plotinus to express the way in whichwe may find the relationship of elements within the intelligible. It may be found inthe treatise, 'On Time and Eternity,' where too we are told the normal reasoning willnot adequately grasp the nature of the eternal and its relationship to Being. Wemust employ 'the eternal in us.' \"See also Warren 1964, an article that cites numerous Plotinian examples ofintrospection as a method of philosophic investigation. Warren raises the issue ofwhether or not the many instances Plotinus cites of human conscious activity areactually intended to represent the states Plotinus is investigating. Plotinus appealsto such examples as the lack of self-consciousness associated with either intenseconcentration or with habitual actions as evidence for questions concerning theorigins of perception, memory, and imagination within the human soul.75"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsargument demonstrated something of a kind which has the powerto inspire confidence? No, it has necessity, not persuasive force, fornecessity is in intellect but persuasion in the soul\" (V.3.6.8-10).How can he think he has succeeded in an argument that has theforce of necessity? It is a question of how one follows the argument.27The argument takes the form of a reductio: he first assumes that theintellect can be in contact, not with reality directly, but only with animpression of some kind. Plotinus then goes on to say that if this isthe case, the same doubts about intellectual knowledge will arise asarise in the case of sense-perception. But if we have an intellect thatcannot vouchsafe that it knows, then we will have to posit anotherintellect to oversee the first, and so on. Either we lack knowledgeentirely, or we are capable of knowing that we know. Intellect mustbe the primary instance of self-knowledge.Plotinus has pointed out the necessity of self-knowledge and alsothat soul knows by means of intellect. So if soul knows anything, itparticipates in a kind of subsidiary self-knowledge: in knowing thatknowledge is present, the mind recognizes that its knowledge isowing to the self-knowledge present in intellect, that is, the mindaffirms its own ability to know. This affirmation is a partial self-knowledge that constitutes a demonstration of the principle of intel-lect, whose very nature is to know itself. Otherwise we would haveintellect that is unintelligent, and this is sheer impossibility.And yet it hardly seems plausible that this reductio could count asa demonstration at all, much less as an irrefutable one, for it seemsmerely to beg the question. The Skeptic's riposte will be, \"That'sjust what I mean; there is an infinite regress of knowers, and intel-lect, the very principle of knowledge, can't guarantee anything, sinceit doesn't even know itself.\" In other words, Plotinus is not entitledhere to assume an incorrigible principle.This demonstration of the principle of self-knowledge, if it is one,cannot be said to be a formal account. Instead, its purpose is toready the student for an intellectual affirmation on her own part.For a detailed discussion of the dialectical context of Ennead V.3.5.1-15, see Wallis1987. Wallis identifies this passage as a response to standard Pyrrhonist strategiesthat attempted to eliminate both of the disjuncts, that the self knows itself either asa whole or as a part. In either case, according to the skeptics, the subjective orobjective side must disappear in the moment of self-apprehension."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Introspection in the Dialectic of the EnneadsPlotinus is convinced that it is not by rational argument that theprinciple of knowledge can be established, but only by a self-recognition on the part of the soul of this indubitable fact of aware-ness itself.How could one apprehend an image of intellect? Every image will be consti-tuted from that which is inferior to it. Rather, the image must come fromintellect, so that it is no longer [grasped] by means of an image. Instead, itis as if one took a sample of gold [to represent] all gold, and then (if thesample were not pure) one purified it, and then could show either bygesturing or by indication, that this is gold, only not all gold, but rather justthis gold that exists in the quantity [on display]. So it is in this case as well:intellect as it exists in the divine can be apprehended when we have purifiedthe intellect in ourselves. (V.8.3.i2ff.)28Likewise, in treatise I.4, \"Peri Eudaimonias/'we find a descriptionof self-reflexive awareness in which thought, projected back ontoitself, is likened to a calm reflective surface, a katoptron. BecausePlotinus is focusing upon the self as self-reflective consciousness,though not upon the self as discursive thinker, there is both a conti-nuity as well as a divergence from the Cartesian argument fromincorrigibility.Direct insight into the nature of the cognitive moment as such isthe method that Plotinus employs. The mind attains self-knowledge,not by developing a conception of what it is to be a knower, but byuncovering self-knowledge through a process of gradual detachmentfrom the objects of consciousness:If someone is unable to discover the soul in this detached state, first let himgrasp the discursive soul, and then ascend from there. But if he cannot evendo this, then [let him grasp] the faculty of sense-perception that conveys theintelligibles still more distantly, or even sense-perception by itself (with itsfaculties) since sense-perception has its nature [determined] by the Forms.(V.3.9.*8ff.)To summarize this section, we can say that self-knowledge involvesthe realization that the mind or self is not an object of any kind. Inthis sense, self-awareness does not automatically yield self-knowledge.Rather, the mind can become self-transparent by concentration uponitself, and the self that it thereby discovers will no longer be any ofthe intentional structures that occupy the mind when directed to-28 My translation.77"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsward an external object. Nevertheless, Plotinus is not content to letthis rest as an item of doctrine. He makes use of thought experi-ments as a means of illustrating his recommended method for culti-vating self-knowledge. These experiments also convey his radicalinsistence upon a specific orientation to the truth under considera-tion: the student must not consider herself as separate from thereality that she seeks to comprehend.Thought ExperimentsIt has been argued that Descartes, writing in the tradition of themeditation manual, a genre designed for an introspective audience,uses his provisional doubt as a cathartic method, thus imitating theprogression of a penitential meditation, in which his soul is purgedof the error of doubt by undergoing sensory deprivation.29 Descarteswrites in the meditative tradition previously shared by authors whoseintention was to foster a mental state that could become receptive todivine grace, or to the light of divine knowledge. In the Meditations,these exercises are also coupled with a theoretical approach to epis-temology, intended to be illustrated by the self-reflective practice ofthe reader. As Gary Hatfield writes of the cogito, the briefly sketchedargument to the conclusion \"that the proposition T am,' T exist,' isnecessarily true\" is ultimately presented as resting on the directapprehension of the meditator's own thinking.30Hatfield stresses that Descartes is keenly aware of his selection ofthe meditative mode of discourse. He insists upon the need for apractical basis for the metaphysical inquiry whose conclusions oftenrun counter to the testimony of the senses and the ontological as-sumptions fostered by long habit. Descartes writes concerning theprimary notions of metaphysics, that \"though in their own naturethey are as intelligible as, or even more intelligible than those thegeometricians study, yet, being contradicted by the preconceptionsof the senses to which we have since our earliest years been accus-tomed, they cannot be perfectly apprehended except by those whogive strenuous attention to them.\" And in the reply to the second29 A.

For the development of this introspective communicationbetween author and reader, Plotinus relies upon a series of thoughtexperiments embedded within the text, whose purpose is to fosterthe potential for self-awareness and so orient the student upon apath of self-knowledge. In Enneads V.8 Plotinus presents a thoughtexperiment involving visualization of the sphere: \"So far as possible,try to conceive of this world as one unified whole, with each of itsparts remaining self-identical and distinct...\"Here Plotinus suggests that the reader try to perceive the world asunified within thought, to think of the world as a single object ofthought, yet as retaining all of the features of its different members.Consider, he tells the reader, how any conditions of awareness what-soever are confronted by you, the knower. These directions are away of calling attention to the most general features involved in anyencounter with the world, any possible object of awareness. Wemight paraphrase these instructions as follows: consider the totalpossible field of objects of awareness - that same field is simply whatI mean by \"world.\"It is fair to call this passage a meditation because it involves twofeatures often employed in meditation techniques: the active butdirected use of the imagination, and the sustained presence of thisimaginative construction as a method of changing habitual modes ofthought or self-awareness:So that whatever part of, for example, the outer sphere is shown forth,there immediately follows the image of the sun together with all of the otherstars, and earth and sea and all sentient beings are seen, as if upon atransparent sphere. (V.8.9.3, Armstrong's translation)This meditation involves a very careful direction of the mind andimagination of the student. Holding the simple image, the sphere,before the mind's eye, the reader is to fill up the space of that imageentirely, exerting herself to the utmost to picture the entire universeof sentient and non-sentient beings in all of their diversity. Certainlyone would need at least some practice and effort to carry out all ofthe conditions of the meditation successfully.79"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Language in the EnneadsAll of these components of the picture must be held in an evengaze. All sentient beings are visible within the diaphanous sphere ata single glance: euthus. An important feature of the meditation is thetraining of the student's concentration and attention. The practiceof this exercise leads both to a focusing capacity, an intense directionof the mind's eye to a single object, without letting any feature ofthat object dominate in the moment, and to a detachment. None ofthe beings, either animate or inanimate, either human or non-human, is to have priority within the meditation. All are equally andcompletely subsumed within the general category of content of thesphere. All are, we might say, equidistant from the center. Thisequidistance is what Plotinus is hinting at by saying that the elementsare, as it were, upon the surface of the sphere.Actually, the passage we have just examined is one of numeroustexts in which Plotinus uses the symbolism of the sphere to illustratethe relationship between consciousness and its contents. We findthese texts broadly divided into two different types, one macrocos-mic, the other microcosmic. Under the first type, the vision isdescribed as planetary, and the contents of the vision include an enu-meration of the parts of the cosmos and their respective inhabi-tants.31 Under the second type, Plotinus uses a more abstract descrip-tion of a geometrical object, a simple illuminated sphere, althoughat times, this shape can represent an individual head, or a headpeering out by means of the faces of all sentient beings.32This variation between the microcosmic and macrocosmic per-spectives is Plotinus' way of illustrating two different ways of conceiv-ing the world. The macrocosm is a publicly available world, inhab-ited and experienced by countless sentient beings, each with adiverse perspective. The microcosm is that same world, seen fromwithin the confines of an individual consciousness. Above all, thesetexts suggest that Plotinus was grappling with the issue of how torepresent subjectivity as a philosophical construct, as well as with themethodological issue of how to couch a dialectical appeal to thesubjective.At this point it is time to recap and to take stock of where we arein terms of the historical question with which we began.

Furthermore,these texts were complemented by a series of thought experimentsin which a highly structured form of subjectivity is represented asimmediately present to the reader. In effect, the thought experi-ments offer the reader a mirror in which to observe his own innerlife. These texts provide a reply to the historical question, \"Whenand why did philosophers first lay claim to knowledge of their ownsubjective states/'33 even as they raise other questions. First, can wecompare any of the tenets or implications of Cartesian subjectivitywith elements of Plotinus' appeal to the subjectivity of conscious-ness? Second, what philosophical work are Plotinus' thought experi-ments designed to do? Are they an elaboration of his arguments, orare they supposed to provide an element of persuasion quite apartfrom the metaphysical assumptions upon which they rely?Internalism, Phenomenalism, and the Limitations of theSubjectivePlotinus begins VI. 5.9 with a kind of psychological experiment: letus say that someone imagines a given number of elements as forminga sphere within his thought. Now Plotinus wants us to look at therelationship between the maker of the sphere, to poioun, and thecontent of that sphere, ta mere:If in a thought [experiment] someone should gather all the elements, oncethey had come into being, into a single spherical shape, he could not thenclaim that many agents made the sphere in a piecemeal fashion, with [eachagent] cutting off a different content for himself and isolating it for thepurpose of production. Rather, [he should admit] that the cause of thesphere's production is single.

Now sincethe thinker is not a separate substance apart from his own thoughts,the mental events/states of this thinker are in some sense a part ofthe thinker. Therefore, the contents of consciousness belong to anintelligent and not to a physical substance. This conclusion bothresembles Cartesian internalism and rests upon a methodology thatrecalls Descartes': the argument turns upon an appeal to introspec-tion. Only the thinker as he is thinking can confirm that he is thecause of his thoughts. Someone else, to whom the perceiver is re-porting his thoughts, might have occasion to remark that the causeof a particular perception was, for example, the man, Socrates.35Following on this experiment, Plotinus briefly attempts, to addressthe problem of intersubjectivity, that is, the public availability of aself-consistent world to a plurality of knowers. The causal indepen-dence of mental states from the physical environment must now betreated as an analogy: just as the mind is the source and cause of itsown contents, so the world soul is the source and cause of its ownBurge, p. 118-9.

Enneads V. 3.3.1 -5."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Introspection in the Dialectic of the Enneadscontents. Hence, the world soul contains the physical cosmos, whileuniversal soul contains the plurality of individual souls.36The question is, what justifies this transition from treating theindividual mind as an example of the causal independence of themental with respect to the physical, to the larger inference, thatthere must be some universal mind that exercises causal indepen-dence with respect to the physical macrocosm? And more impor-tantly for our purposes, how does Plotinus' appeal to introspectionenter into the structure of the argument? On the surface, this appealseems a crudely deceptive attempt at persuasion. Starting from aninternalist position, Plotinus ends by invoking the metaphysical prin-ciple that underlies his experiment, the doctrine of panpsychism. Infact, however, Plotinus needs his doctrine of panpsychism to accountfor the intersubjective consistency of the world. The argument ap-pears to exhibit a circularity masked by the ingenuity of an appealto the immediacy of consciousness.To understand this transition, we turn to another thought exper-iment. Here we consider the analogies between Plotinus' explorationof subjectivity and the esse est percipi variety of idealism upon whichmodern-day philosophers heap so much scorn. The passage we areabout to consider seems to introduce a form of phenomenalism as astep in the argument, which is intended to show that there are Formsfor all sentient beings, or that all sentient beings exist within thehypostasis nous.We have already seen this text in chapter 2. There I suggestedthat the text invites the reader to unify all sentient beings and to seethem as existing in the mind, in much the same manner as thepreviously discussed thought experiment. In the context of the pres-ent passage, objectively all sentient beings constitute one world body;subjectively, they constitute a single phenomenal presentation. As aresult of this first step, the unification of all sentient beings, theFor thorough discussion of the causal relations between the individual embodiedsoul and the world soul, see Helleman-Elgersma, pp. 42-52. There is a distinctionbetween the hypostasis soul (universal soul) and the world soul, which governs thecosmos as a whole. Elgersma calls attention to the work of Blumenthal, who dem-onstrates the inadequacy of the prevailing assumption in scholarship, introduced byZeller, that these two souls should be equated. If the individual soul is simply a partof the world soul, and not directly related to the universal hypostasis, soul, then thecosmos would entirely subsume the autonomy of the individual."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsreader now envisions a purely qualitative world, a world consistingof pure experience. These presentations intimately belong withinthe consciousness of the person who is conducting, so to speak, thisexperiment:The emergence of [all things] is from a single source, so to speak, butthe source is not like some one particular breath or like a single feeling ofwarmth. Rather, it is as if a single quality contained all qualities in itself, andactually preserved them, so that [the quality of] sweetness [would be pre-served] together with the [quality of] fragrance, and this single quality were[to become] simultaneously the taste of wine, and of all the modes of taste,and sights of colors, and all the sensations of touch. The quality would bringabout whatever sounds are heard, all songs and every rhythm.Thus the progress of the passage is from the objective description ofthe quality, as sweetness or smell, to its fundamental nature as a kindof awareness on the part of the perceiver.This text presents a thought experiment in which the objectiveworld dissolves before the mind, leaving in its wake what mightliterally be described as a stream of consciousness. In our passage,individual substances are shown to consist in qualia, and these qualiain turn are simply modifications of consciousness, or nous, which, Itake it, is the \"single source\" described in the text. In both of theseexperiments, Plotinus shows us how the soul constructs a contractedsense of self when it conceives the world as outside of the self; thisnotion of externality is a result of habitually identifying with thebody. The thought experiments reveal a way of conceiving the worldas not external to the self. Gradually the boundary that separates selfand world is erased, when the demarcations of selfhood are nolonger around the body, but around the totality of any given phe-nomenal presentation.So far, we have encountered thought experiments in which thesubjective stance has been used as a support for some very weightymetaphysical tenets, including the doctrine of panpsychism and thedoctrine of the Platonic world exemplar. In both passages, a struc-tural puzzle crops up. A supposedly unmediated and hence, unbi-ased, appeal to consciousness becomes a method of securing credi-bility for what are obviously entrenched dogmas within the Platonicschool.

The success of the thought experiment means for Plo-tinus a validation of the contemplative journey.In fact, one of the strongest motivations that Plotinus has forapproaching subjectivity by means of these thought experiments isto point out the limitations of the subjective. The appeal to intro-spection invites a scrutiny of the assumptions that the knower makesabout himself. Instead of singling oneself out as possessing a privi-leged epistemic status, these texts encourage the reader both todoubt his own identity and to recognize his own cognitive limita-tions.In the thought experiments we have discussed, one of the mostimportant configurations presented is the relationship between thesphere and its contents. The person, qua knower, or subject of con-sciousness, will identify with the sphere, rather than with any of itscontents. Immediately, definitions of the self that are appropriatefor the knower considered as a sensible particular are no longerappropriate for the person undergoing the exercise. The purpose ofthis exercise is to sustain an insight into the nature of the individualinsofar as he is a knower, by suggesting a contrast between his knowl-edge of himself, qua individual, and his identity as a knower, quaknower. The very stance that is assumed if one identifies, not withthe contents of consciousness, but with consciousness apart from itscontents, immediately begins to erode the identity of the knower.The center of consciousness is infinitely expansive, including withinitself any individual identity that the knower may possess as an unre-markable feature of the total interior landscape. That is, every cog-nizable fact about the knower's identity as subject is converted to thestatus of an external condition: body, personality, life history, pas-sions, and so forth.

This assumption is in turn founded upon the need towithstand the subjectivism that would apparently result from sayingthat intellect cannot discover an object that exists prior to it.Porphyry's objections may serve as an introduction to a key diffi-culty in the conception of self-knowledge that I have been develop-ing here. The path of introspection should result in the belief thatthe empirical self is not the true self. But it is hard to see how theindividual subject of consciousness, which contains but is not identi-cal to any of its contents, can ever overcome the solipsism thatthreatens to engulf it. The creations of the individual mind areentirely subjective; the objects of intellect, nous, are preeminentlyobjective.The problem of discontinuity between the individual mind alongwith the individual's thinking, and the intellect as such, togetherwith its extensionality as the eternal forms, formed the basis of\"worst difficulty\" argument already in the Platonic Parmenides, whichis generated from the subjectivist implications of treating the ideasas the noemata, or thought objects, of an individual mind.But, Parmenides, said Socrates, may it not be that each of these forms isa thought, which cannot properly exist anywhere but in a mind ... (i32b7)And besides, said Parmenides, according to the way in which you assert thatthe other things have a share in the forms, must you not hold either thateach of those things consists of thoughts, so that all things think, or else thatthey are thoughts which nevertheless do not think?

He expects that this fundamental condition of consciousexperience, the reality of the knower as engaged in the confronta-tion with the world as given to consciousness, will provide the bestopportunity for an exploration of the nature of intelligible reality.Plotinus relies upon a method of directly pointing to the veryprimacy of cognition or awareness in its most general aspect, thevery consciousness that is the basis for any mode of cognition. Thismethod assumes at the outset that intellect in us is intellect as such,but we do not yet recognize it. Plotinus tells us: \"And to put itanother way, nous does not belong to the individual, but it is ratheruniversal\" (III.8.8.41).

And this couldhappen in the following way, if you first removed the body from humanityand so also from yourself, of course, and then [you removed] the soul thatgives rise to the body, together with sense-perception, which definitely [hasto go], as well as desires, passions and all the remaining nonsense, since allthat inclines us to the empirical self.

The detachment recommended hereseems at odds with a requisite self-honesty that would admit passions,sense experiences, and bodily states as all belonging to the self.To put this issue into sharper focus, we borrow from a complaintlodged against the Cartesian res cogitans, the pure subject of con-sciousness enshrined within the empiricist tradition:For empiricism, the self is an unobjectifiable subject, just as the eye is aninvisible organ. But. . . the empiricist self vanishes when subjected to empir-icist scrutiny. The self is not discoverable by any sense, whether inner orouter; and therefore it is to be rejected as a metaphysical monster.40The thought experiments that Plotinus engages in continually referthe reader to this self that can never be grasped as a definite object,as this or as that. Indeed, the most that such a \"witness\" self, orsubject of consciousness, would have to say for itself would be, \"am,am,\" or \"I, I.\"41This speculative self, the watchful fleshless eye that has been re-peatedly denounced in the post-modern era as an artificial attemptto reify a linguistic convention,42 is easily discoverable within thepremodern tradition. But for the modern tradition, this self was partof an elaborate epistemological construction that introduced anenormous amount of excess metaphysical baggage, to wit, Cartesiandualism and its internalist consequences.Plotinus' motivations lay in another direction entirely. In fact, itwould be difficult to overemphasize the affinities that Plotinus shares39 Cf. the acute study of Plotinus' recommendations for contemplative detachmentfrom the empirical self by Schroeder 1989.40 Kenny 1992.41 EnneadsV .<$. 10.36.42 That is, reifying the first person pronoun, which, as subject of all self-referringpredicates, is a linguistic device to indicate the presence of an ego-substance, but is,according to some theorists, a metaphysical cipher.

And calling upon the god whose imaginary conception you have,pray for him to come. (V.8.9.11; Armstrong's translation; my italics)Here the sphere is obviously treated as an icon of deity. But morethan the sphere itself, the world as a whole, since it is containedwithin the sphere, is conceived as an icon, a sacred image of the godwho can be encountered face to face within his shrine.43 This medi-tation then is also a Cletic prayer, an invocation that depends uponmaking the world as a whole both one's offering and one's object ofworship. The exercise helps the student to treat the world as atheophany, as an image of the deity whose real presence is yet to berecognized.44 This recognition is best attained, according to Plotinus,within an introspective search: Plotinian prayers employ the formula,\"alone to the alone.\"45This introspective practice involves simplifying and clarifying therelationship that the soul as knower has with all possible objects ofawareness. One of the consequences of this clarification is the resto-ration of the soul's proper fullness, an appreciation of the rich andcreative intellectual potential that is available to every human being43 There are many passages in the Enneads where the image of the sphere is associatedwith the activity of contemplative meditation or prayer. Often Plotinus uses thelanguage of solar worship to discuss this kind of meditation, but as often he usesthe language of cult and celebration, employing dance imagery as an application ofthe same spherical model.

He assumes that figures ofspeech can be more or less adequate to the task of representation,and that representational adequacy depends upon the ontologicalapproximation of image and archetype. Since it is incorporeal, lightturns out to be the most appropriate image for the task of represent-ing philosophical truth.In Beierwaltes's view, light is not merely a metaphor when it isused to describe intellect, since it can succeed as an image of theintellect only when \"there is a presence of the original in the im-age.\"3 Visual seeing differs from intellectual seeing because the vi-sual object is external to the subject whereas the intellectual objectis internal to the subject.

Instead,its purpose is to assist the reader in assimilating doctrine. At leastsome metaphors in the Enneads can be read for their rhetoricalfunction as directive utterances, designed to tell us not how thingsare, but how to see things.How does metaphor accomplish this? To answer this question,one has to be familiar with what Plotinus sees as the major drawbackbesetting doctrinal deliverances.6 Plotinus holds that language fails5 Perhaps the first response came in the form of Ferwerda's monograph (Ferwerda1965), whose view can be summarized from the following paragraph taken from hisintroduction (p. 7): \"Nous pouvons done conclure que l'image chez Plotin toutcomme chez Platon ne vaut jamais en soi; elle vaut ce que vaut la connaissance decelui qui s'en sert; elle ne vaut que si elle est vraie et, ce qui est extremementimportant, si elle est verifiee.

He reiterates his position in Schroeder 1994, p. 473.6 A minor flurry of scholarship has arisen over the issue of whether Plotinus equatesnon-discursive with non-propositional thought. For the controversy and its history,see Lloyd 1969-70, Sorabji 1983, Lloyd 1986, Alfino 1990, and Lloyd 1990. Sorabji'sargument is that non-propositional thought is a concept at odds with Plotinus'account of nous's activity, since the latter involves complexity. Alfino and Lloydrespond by countering that nous's thoughts cannot be propositional since in thatcase they would be assimilable to language and so possess a signifying function.However, they argue, nous's thoughts are not representational and do not signify.A lack of standard terminology makes this debate difficult to resolve. WhenPlotinus explicitly denies propositional thought to nous, the terms he actually usesare jipOT&oeig, a£icbn,aTa, XEKTA. This vocabulary is eclectic, comprised of the Aristote-lian and Stoic words denoting \"propositions.\" In short, Plotinus might be taken toexclude Stoic or Aristotelian accounts of propositional thought from nous, withoutthereby precluding propositional thought eo ipso.

He employsmetaphorical expressions to point out features of accessible experi-ences that exhibit, more or less perfectly, some degree of unitybetween the knowing subject and the object known. In this way, heuses metaphor to guide the reader to a better understanding of whatknowing, in the most proper sense, is and is like.Plotinus employs the image of the diaphanous earth to contrasttwo ways of looking at the world. The first way of looking at thingshe describes as \"looking outside\" (TOI e^co OKOJteiaGai; the second wayof looking at things he sometimes calls \"seeing inside.\"9 My concernwill be to show that when Plotinus wants to contrast discursivethinking with non-discursive thinking (or intellectual knowledge) heinvokes this distinction between looking outside and seeing inside.To give his readers a sense of what seeing inside might be like,Plotinus employs the image of the transparent world.The chapter develops in four stages.

Wemight aver that, practically, the consequences of Plotinus' critiqueleave us no better off than does Skepticism - deserted by an authorwho becomes almost willfully inscrutable and taunted by a text thatbecomes almost instantly displaced.One scholar who has raised this issue is Steven Strange.11 Hewrites:Plotinus' critique is metaphysically important, because it requires a new viewof the status of the language of metaphysics. Terms of ordinary language,the normal use of which is to speak about everyday sensible experience, musthave new meanings if they are to be applied to Forms. Plotinus thinks thatthe highest and most important kind of reality can only be spoken of usingmetaphors.Strange's remarks are relevant because they consider how Plotinus'theoretical constraints operate upon his own discourse. But Strangedoes not consider why it is that metaphor is any less vulnerable toPlotinus' criticisms. Is not metaphorical thinking - the obvious objec-tion - itself discursive? It has been far more common for scholars toargue that symbolic language in the Enneads should enjoy no suchprivileged status. We find this opinion expressed in Ferwerda'smonograph and echoed in Blumenthal's bibliographic survey.12 Plo-tinus never uses a symbol without a surrounding context that expli-10 Alfino 1990; Lloyd 1990. Actually, Plotinus employs more than one tack for thepurpose of criticizing discursive thought. Another strategy, equally pervasivethroughout the Enneads, is to demonstrate the indeterminacy of discursive thinkingwith regard to the expression of necessary truths. This second type is squarelygrounded in Plotinus' anti-essentialist analysis of individuation.11 Strange 1987.12 Ferwerda 1965, p. 7.

They have no independent value.Metaphor here is thought to have a purely derivative status be-cause it must be interpreted in the light of statements of fact or ofdoctrine. This is to discover the meaning of the metaphor in thecognitive content that it is purported to have and to say that, as avehicle of this content, the metaphor depends upon a literal state-ment of fact, which accurately describes, one might say, the waythings are. Metaphor is thereby disparaged on the philosophicalgrounds that any representation equates with derogation, in accor-dance with standard Platonic ontology.13 Whereas Strange's remarkshinted at a role that metaphor might be able to play in the exposi-tion of Plotinus' philosophy by circumventing the strictures of ordi-nary literal usage, the majority of Plotinus scholars are doubtful thatsuch a role would be consonant with the cautionary views that anyPlatonist is bound to hold concerning the status of images in gen-eral.How one responds to the use of metaphor in Plotinus' text maybe condi toned by one's understanding of the nature of metaphoricalutterances. Thus before looking at metaphorical language in Ploti-nus, I would like to sketch more precisely what I have in mind by arhetorical conception of metaphor.The traditional comparison theory of metaphor is most familiarto classicists from Aristotle's Rhetoric.1* It simply asserts that all meta-phors are elliptical usages for similes, or imply similes. Thus themetaphor can be explained in terms of other, literal species oflanguage use, in the sense that once a comparison is stated, it maybe literally true that certain objects share features in common.1513 Cf. Blumenthal 1987a, p. 542: \"This view is required by the many texts wherePlotinus speaks of likeness as a relation of inferiority.\"14 Classicists are most familiar with the substitution theory of metaphor, a theorypurportedly extending all the way back to Aristotle's Poetics, chapter 21, and Rhetoric,chapter 11. Black 1977 summarizes this theory as follows: \"The substitution viewregards the entire sentence that is the locus of the metaphor as replacing some setof literal sentences.\" For modern explication of this theory, see Searle 1979, andfor recent criticism, see Lakoff and Turner 1989, p. 123.

According to these views, the sentence orliteral meaning of the statement diverges from the utterance mean-ing of the sentence, or the way that the sentence is being used, suchthat the literal reading of the metaphor has a false truth value,whereas the metaphorical reading of the metaphor has a true truthvalue.17When Thrasymachus says \"Socrates needs a wet nurse,\" that isnot literally true, because in fact Socrates has long been taking solidfood. Nor would any serious listener berate Thrasymachus for havingfailed to notice this about Socrates. We would, however, seriouslyfault the truth of Thrasymachus' statement if it turned out thatSocrates was behaving appropriately in the course of his argumentand was responding in a judicious way to his interlocutor.The literal falsity of this metaphor suggests to his audience thatThrasymachus is using language (a) not literally and (b) with someother objectives. Perhaps he wants to say that Socrates is cavilingunnecessarily. Finally, though, he intends his assertion to have someeffect on Socrates.

In short, these interpreters viewPlotinus' metaphors as straightforwardly lexical.19 The meaning ofthe metaphor must be recovered by looking at what we take it to beasserting, that is, at its paraphrased cognitive content, according tothe majority view, or by keeping in mind the true ontological refer-ence of the symbol, according to Beierwaltes.What these interpretations have left out is a pragmatic account ofmetaphorical language.20 A pragmatic view might reveal that Ploti-nus' metaphors are irreducible to literal language because of thecognitive enhancement they lend to the process of communication.21The heuristic value of metaphorical language in the Enneads cannot18 Skulsky 1986.19 On the lexical interpretation of Aristotle's theory, see Ricoeur 1977, pp. 9-43.Aristotle defines metaphor {Poetics 1475b) as \"the application [epiphora] of an alienname.\"20 I am using the word \"pragmatic\" here as a means of introducing a semantic/pragmatic distinction.

This view has it that by conceptualizing the framein terms of the focus, we increase our ability to comprehend the frame. Suchcognitive enhancement occurs maximally when the set of correspondences noticedbetween frame and focus are created by the metaphor. When we see something assomething else, then we create a likeness in certain respects between the objectsinsofar as we are considering them: \"Some metaphors enable us to see aspects ofreality that the metaphor's production helps to constitute.\"1 Cf. Soskice 1991, for the idea of metaphor as accomplishing its work through anindeterminacy or refusal to specify fully the conceptual frame with which it isinvolved.1 Davidson 1978 in this line of thought writes:We imagine that there is a content to be captured when all the while we are infact focusing on what the metaphor makes us notice. If what the metaphormakes us notice were finite in scope and propositional in nature, this wouldnot in itself make trouble; we would simply project the content the metaphorbrought to mind onto the metaphor.

His metaphor is designed to make the reader reflect upon thequestion of how the world is seen, and whether or not the world isas it is seen:as if someone should have the sight that Lynkeus is said to have had, and tosee the inside of the earth, as the myth riddles about the eyes they havethere. (V.8.4.26)The self-repudiating feature of Plotinus' most prominent metaphordoes more than convey a sense of the mythical. By means of thisimage, an experiential component is infused into the text. Seeingthrough the earth is not possible for human beings, and yet Plotinusreturns to this image as the basis for establishing communicationbetween himself and the reader.Discursivity and Its DiscontentsLet us now turn to Plotinus' typology for discursive thinking. Mycentral point is that for Plotinus, one of the most salient character-istics of discursive thought is its intentional structure: discursivestates exhibit directedness by being about objects that are ontologi-cally independent of those states:We allocated to [discursive reason the ability to] reflect upon what is exter-nal to it and to meddle in external matters, but we take it that it is basic tointellect to reflect upon its own nature and what belongs to its own nature.(V.2.3.17)Of course, thinking or saying that things are thus-and-so is not iden-tical to their being thus-and-so, in most circumstances. The pointseems almost too obvious to belabor, and yet it is a point that Ploti-nus repeatedly stresses when discussing the ontological concomitantsof discursive thought.How is it that discursive states are directed toward particulars inthe world? Here Plotinus' account is informed by the Aristoteliandoctrine of isomorphism, enunciated at De anima III.8, according towhich the mind, when comprehending or perceiving an object, be-comes identical with the form of that object. Aristotle stipulates thatthe mind \"thinks the forms by means of mental images\" (De anima,43165; Hicks) in order to represent its objects (whether they beperceptual or conceptual). Finally, he employs a strong analogy be-99"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadstween sense-perception and mental perception, describing ordinarythought as a kind of mental receptivity to form.25 Here is the relevantpassage from the De animalBut if thought is like perception, then the mind must be acted upon by thethought object or something else must [happen] which is analogous to this.Therefore, the mind must be impassive, but must be capable of receivingthe form.Following Aristotle, Plotinus preserves this analogy between men-tal and physical perception. Discursive thinking involves mental rep-resentation of the forms:the soul... is other than its object, and has a discursive awareness that seesas if it were one thing gazing at another. (III.8.6.22-25 [with omissions])Having appropriated the Aristotelian terminology, Plotinus sets him-self the task of making a clear distinction between noesis and dianoe-sis, or non-discursive and discursive thought, a distinction that isabsent in the Aristotelian discussion. In Enneads V.5, we see himgroping toward an account of noesis that departs from the intentionalmodel that Aristotle uses.In the opening chapter of this treatise, we encounter the well-worn Plotinian formulation of discursive thought as that which is*'cognizant of what is external\" (TCOV ^ev e^co ... &VTiM)i|)£Tai). Plotinusetymologizes the word, 66%a, \"opinion,\" from the verb 6&xoH*xi, \"toreceive,\" in keeping with Aristotelian isomorphism:27Opinion receives, indeed, that is why it is opinion, because it receivessomething from an object that is substantially different from that whichreceives it.Again, in V.3., Plotinus employs the aisthesis/noesis analogy, but at the same timehe tries to modify it by refining his vocabulary, using the terms 6pdtaig (sight) and|3X£jtei (look at) as contrasting terms: \"if [sc. discursive mind] looks, it looks at anobject different from itself that becomes complete in something different fromitself. But in the intelligible order none of this takes place: the seer and the seenare in the same place.\"De anima III.4.13-16; 429^3.Enneads V.5.1.62. The actual details of Aristotelian noetic isomorphism are open tointerpretation.

Visual experience is subject to evaluation as true or false because it is amental state directed toward particulars in the world. At V.3.3 Plotinus narrates akind of script in which he spells out what is taking place mentally when a perceiverrecognizes a visual object: \"One might ask oneself, 'Who is this?' if he has met theperson on a previous occasion, and answer with the aid of memory that it isSocrates. So too when someone pays attention to the details of what he sees, heanalyses the [visual] presentation.\"The experience as a whole, designated by the phrase a f\\ (pavTCtoia eSooKev,literally, \"what the imagination presents,\" is associated by the percipient with apropositional content. When we think or perceive, we represent to ourselves acertain propositional content that \"unfolds\" (we might say unpacks) the intuitionor describes what has been apprehended in perception. This logos, or propositionalcontent, goes hand in hand with the intentional object, telling us what the mentalstate is about.1O1"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsconcepts.32 Absent from intellectual activity, noesis, is the intentionalstructure of discursive thought in which there is a discrete subjectthat stands apart from the object known. No longer can it be saidthat the mind exhibits directedness toward an object in the act ofnoesis. Rather, the subject discovers that it is its own object: \"whensomething knows itself, [this] is the proper meaning of knowing\"(V.3.13.15).Plotinus derails the Aristotelian analogy between perception andknowledge by introducing Platonic language to describe the act ofV6T|GLC;, invoking in particular Plato's [leyiOTa ytv\\\\.

Con-templation must constantly [take place] within identity and difference.(V.3.10.23-26)But what does this experience of difference within identityamount to? One answer is that it amounts to a paradox. Plotinusexploits the fact that the Platonic categories are a series of pairedopposites to demonstrate the paradoxical nature of intellect's activ-ity: the intellect knows an object that is simultaneously not graspedas an object. Moreover, this object is both unitary and inherentlymultiple.33 These contradictions cause Plotinus' difficulties to prolif-erate as he tries to describe the nature of intellectual thought.34 This\"knowledge which is not one thing different from that in which itis\"35 is enigmatic by Plotinus' own admission: \"just how [this form ofthought can exist] Plato left for us to investigate ...\" (V.8.4.54).32 The representation of Forms by means of concepts or logoi is obviously an enormoustopic and one that cannot be discussed here.

At this juncture, Plotinus turns tothe metaphor of the transparent world.36 He uses this metaphor inan effort to represent a methodology that can escape from the limi-tations of discursivity, because it circumvents or modifies the subject/object dichotomy that characterizes ordinary thought.At the opening of V.8.9 there is an extended meditation uponthe relationship between wisdom and the products whose creation itgoverns. The beauty of our cosmos, Plotinus tells us, can best beappreciated if we conceive of the cosmos as transparent. We can seethe beauty of the world only if we are capable of seeing through theworld. Although the remarks in chapter 1 may seem elusive, fallingsomewhere in between metaphor and cosmological speculation, itquickly becomes apparent that Plotinus expects the reader/audienceto be following very closely indeed.He offers us nothing less than instruction in how to recreate thisimage of the transparent world for ourselves, describing an exerciseinvolving visualization of the world as situated within a diaphanoussphere: \"So far as possible, try to conceive of this world as oneunified whole, with each of its parts remaining self-identical anddistinct. . .\" (VI.8.9.1-3.)Here Plotinus suggests that the reader try to perceive the world asunified within thought, to think of the world as a single object ofthought, yet as retaining all of the features of its different members.At this point we might do well to ask, why does Plotinus want hisreader to think of this world as a whole?Plotinus attempts to fine-tune the manner in which we normallycomprehend the world by opening up the field of awareness toinclude all possible objects of awareness. His purpose is to restorethe natural fullness that is available to the human intellect as abirthright but has been obscured due to the dominance of discursivethinking.

This will be the first step that Plotinus wishes the readerto follow in order to gain some sense of what Plotinus means by non-discursive awareness. Another feature of the image now emerges intoview:39So that whatever part of, for example, the outer sphere is shown forth, thereimmediately follows the image of the sun together with all of the other stars,and earth and sea and all sentient beings are seen, as if upon a transparentsphere.Although the sphere is envisioned as transparent, it is not empty.Holding the simple image, the sphere, before the mind's eye, thereader is to fill up the space of that image entirely, to picture theentire universe of sentient and non-sentient beings in all of theirdiversity. The reader has before the mind's eye a vast field consistingin the panoramic sweep of the entire cosmos that is simultaneouslyintricate in its detail and specification. The purpose of this interiorvisualization is to call attention to the quality of interior vision itself,and in particular, to its capacity to be at once unitary and multi-faceted in a way that exterior vision is not.This facet of the image, its appearance as an integral totality,functions as a balance upon the monolithic quality of the initialvisualization. It also introduces a third stage in the developing vision:37 V.3.17.23. Cf. V.1.4.19—21: \"Indeed, there is a succession of things involved withsoul, at one moment Socrates, at another a horse, always one particular thing,whereas Intellect is all things\" (Atkinson's translation).38 V.8.6.9: ot6p6ov39 V.8.9.3.

(V.8.9.9-14).The reader, trying to contract the teeming morass of all sentientbeings into this tiny sphere, must ruthlessly compress the entireuniverse. Instructions for this form of imaginary compression areincluded in the exhortation to ''remove space.\" Here Plotinus sug-gests that the student try to picture the world as existing within hisimagination, that is, to confront the world solely as it is apprehendedin awareness.A parallel image is developed in VI.4.7.22-6:If you were to make a small luminous mass a kind of center and then toplace a spherical body around it so that the light inside illuminated theentire container, there being no other source of light for the outer mass . ..The image is very similar in structure and content to the one devel-oped in V.8. The subject of consciousness, represented by the center,is described as pervading the entire field of light, which representsconsciousness. From the viewpoint of this subject, there is no sourceof light for the outer mass other than that which originates in thecenter. That is to say, the objects of awareness are and must beavailable for a conscious subject. Although this state of affairs mayseem quite obvious and not altogether interesting, it is a state ofaffairs to which Plotinus is very concerned to alert the reader: Ploti-nus is communicating a way of looking at the objects of awarenesssuch that one sees them as pervaded by, or not other than, thesubject of awareness.The sustained practice of this visualization leads to a state ofgreater detachment from the objects of awareness. None of thebeings, either animate or inanimate, either human or non-human,is to have priority within the vision. All are equidistant from thesubject of consciousness, an equidistance that Plotinus signals byusing the word \"center\" in VI.4.7.23. Similarly, the objective statusof the knower herself or himself is now open for investigation.Any objective fact about this knower, as for example his or herlocation in time or place, now becomes one more component of the105"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Language in the Enneadsintegral vision that includes all beings, even the knower himself orherself. Given this initial confrontation with the world in all of itsvastness as experienced within consciousness, the identity of knoweritself becomes an issue, since the knower is discovered to be outsideof the contents of the sphere, and yet related to it as its cause andsource.One obvious feature of these images is their fluid dynamism, theprecision and clarity of an extremely vivid picture that undergoes asudden shift of perspective.40 Such a combination of sustained obser-vation together with abrupt displacement reflects two primary men-tal components that accompany the non-discursive thinking con-veyed in these texts: concentration and insight. The contemplativepractice that is meant to underlie these images is designed tostrengthen these intellectual qualities within the student and em-ploys a non-discursive approach to that end. The self-disciplinedeffort of focusing the mind upon its object with intensity and atten-tion is a feature of non-discursive thinking, since in this state, thesubject and object of awareness must merge.Heuresis and Didaxis in the EnneadsNow it is time to cast our gaze back toward the subject/object di-chotomy that characterizes discursive thinking and to ask whetherthere has been any modification of the intentional structure noticedearlier.

The reader,looking simultaneously into his or her own experience and out atthe world, interprets the text fully only when thought turns backupon itself. In this respect, these texts may remind us of the identityof word and object that characterizes the kind of speech that Ploti-nus posits as an ideal philosophical language:The wise men of Egypt. . . did not use the forms of letters which follow theorder of words . . . but by ... inscribing in their temples one particular imageof one particular thing they manifested the non-discursiveness of the intelli-gible world.

One scholar, concluding his articlewith a glance at the Egyptian sages, comments:41This is the prelapsarian language which, had it ever existed, might berecovered to supply the words the mystic lacks. But the passage is poignantprecisely because its author knows that such a language signifies only to thewise and that between theirs and ours lies an (almost) unbridgeable chasm.This assessment of sagacious discourse may leave us with an exces-sively pessimistic view about the possibility of coming to understandthe philosophy of the Enneads. For what happens when, in contem-plating the visual field as such, the reader is looking into his or herown thought?

The transparent world is a metaphor for what is actuallypresent to consciousness, and Plotinus directs us to our own con-sciousness to discover what he is trying to communicate by means ofthis image. The exercise that he prescribes is an appreciation of thesimultaneous presence of all beings together as a unified objectivefield for consciousness to experience. This experience of the unityof consciousness, which neither excludes the outside world nor iso-lates the mental apart from its intentional content, becomes a refer-ence point for the reader as he or she attempts to follow Plotinus inhis investigations. Above all, Plotinus would remind us that we cantruly enter into the life of philosophy, not by virtue of an individualclaim to philosophical expertise, but by virtue of the reality of ouressential nature as intellect. For the discovery of this nature, we haveto begin in the midst of our own cognitive life.Pragmatics of Metaphor ReconsideredHere I commence to argue for a rhetorical reading of the metaphorsin the Enneads by meeting some methodological objections: are allof Plotinus' metaphors to be read in a strong creative sense, or isonly the metaphor of the transparent earth to be so read? Are thereany linguistic criteria by which we can justify this reading? I am goingto suggest that Plotinus approximates ritual language as a signal tohis audience that his metaphors are meant to be creative in thesense outlined earlier.To capture the ritual features of Plotinus' metaphorical language,we turn briefly to a body of Alexandrian religious literature thatantedates the Enneads, the Corpus Hermeticum (CH) .42 The CH is agroup of treatises couched as dialogues between Hellenized Egyptiandeities (Hermes, Tat, Asclepius/Imhotep, Ammon, and Agathos Dai-mon, with the addition of Nous, who also functions as an interlocu-tor) broadly informed by an eclectic mixture of Greek philosophicalFor a modern English translation of the CH, see Brian Copenhaver, Hermetica: TheGreek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a new English translation, with notesand introduction (Cambridge; New York, 1992).

What especially concerns me is the linguistic markingthat designates the dialogic and initiatory aspects of this literature.In what follows I suggest that there is a dialogic element presentin some of the imagistic sequences in the Enneads that may recall theHermetic tradition. Linguistic phenomena such as intimate address,real time intruding upon the narrative voice, the presence of tech-nical prayer formulae or invocations, and the heavy use of epithetsas well as anaphora feature significantly in Hermetic initiatory texts.These same elements are self-consciously adopted and prominentlydisplayed in those texts of Plotinus that appropriate the ritualisticmilieu of his Alexandrian predecessors. Syntactically, the grammarexhibits a shift from the indicative to the imperative, subjunctive, oroptative moods. This shift in the mood of the verb is often accom-panied by a shift in the person of the verb, from third to second.44Turning now to a lexical item, in the opening lines of V.8.9, twoterms, K6a^iog and Jtav, are used in a way that recalls ascent formulaefound within the Hermetica.45 Plotinus' exercises actually recall thehymnic quality of many of the Hermetic ascent sequences, which inthe CH may appear coupled with an epiphany or declaration ofenlightenment on behalf of the student. Such is the case with CHXI, an initiatory dialogue between Nous and Hermes, in which Her-mes asks for clarification concerning the relationship between Godand the universe.

Anaphora accentuates the ritual-istic element of the texts, so that there is an iconic relationshipbetween the form of the language and its pragmatic function.48 Thesense of transformation is graphically conveyed through the repeti-tion of key words in slightly different collocations, and by the end ofthe passage, a given image can become the inverse of its initialpresentation.For example, in VI.7.12, the vision moves from a tiny point oflight to the unbounded light of the sun and, beyond that, to a lightthat is coextensive with all things.

Pragmatically, these texts aremarked as belonging to an initiatory askesis.Conclusion: Metaphor and MetaphysicsI have been discussing the use of metaphor in a highly eclectic andperhaps even syncretistic text. Although the path of least resistancemight prompt us to view this text solely within the cultural amalgamof Alexandrian gnosis, there is some merit in viewing the text asPlotinus' unique contribution to a theory about the language ofmetaphysics and perhaps as a critique of philosophical discoursewithin the Platonic tradition. I would suggest that Plotinus has at-tempted to invert the usual relationship that exists between meta-phor and metaphysics.Rather often, critics charge metaphysicians with subverting natu-ral language for their own purposes,53 inventing a parasitic ortho-doxy that thrives at the expense of usual semantic relationships. Thelanguage of metaphysics is typically the language of unsaying, of theunseen and insensible. Perhaps Derrida best captures the suspicionthat metaphysical discourse arouses precisely because of the meta-52 CH X.103, Scott's translation: \"Since the kosmos is a sphere, that is to say a head,whatever is connected to the membrane of the head is soul and is by natureimmortal.\"53 The critics' number is legion, but I am thinking especially of Wittgenstein, ofDerrida, and of Ayer.112"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Symbolism of the Enneadsphorical subterfuge with which it engages its audience: \"Presencedisappearing into its own radiance, the hidden source of light, oftruth and of meaning, the erasure of the veils of being - such mustbe the insistent return of that which subjects metaphysics to meta-phor.\"54 In Platonic metaphysics, Form, or eidos, is metaphorized tobecome precisely the opposite of what it signifies. The eidos of anobject is no longer what it appears to be, nor can a given Formsignify or refer to any object in the world. In this way, Plato con-structs a language far removed from the semantics of natural lan-guage.A practical way of envisioning Plotinus' metaphors is to see thatthey constitute a reversal of the Platonic strategy. Plotinus representsthe language of metaphysics as preeminently concrete and as se-curely grounding its references in that which is immediately accessi-ble. In this respect, he employs what we might term a rhetoric ofimmediacy, in contrast to the Platonic tendency toward the ontolog-ical deferment of meaning.Occasionally, we catch glimmers of Plotinus' critique of linguisticpractices that characterized or even became the hallmark of theprior philosophical tradition. Here for example Plotinus criticizesthe Platonic language of abstraction and along with it the entirePlatonic dualist ontology.55 Here Plotinus is quoting Plato's Timaeuswith respect to the Platonic concept of participation in the Forms.I am afraid that this manner of speaking is vacuous. What would the words,\"far off\" or \"separate\" mean in this context? If not for this way of speaking,there would in turn be no difficulty or puzzle about the concept of partici-pation . . .

Whereasthe Orphic tradition is cosmological (Orpheus sings about the birthof the cosmos, and so narrates a cosmogony), Pythagorean symbol-ism is essentially nonnarrative and involves mathematical and geo-metric concepts. Disparate as ways of framing the world, both thesesystems are central to Neoplatonic texts and become important ve-hicles through which the Neoplatonists attempt to convey their non-discursive methodologies.The thought exercises that have been the subject of the previouspages involve mathematical and geometric symbolism. In this chap-ter, I show that the history of this symbolism in Neoplatonic textshelps us to enter into a reconstruction of Neoplatonic self-representation precisely because these symbols are so powerfullycharged by their historical eminence and also by their traditionalweight.2 Within the history of Platonism, oscillation between a ten-For the connections between Orphism and Pythagoreanism, see Burkert 1972, 125-33; West 1983, 7215, and now Kingsley 1995, pp. 115-16.

In his introduction to the Platonic Theology, Proclus cansay:All of Greek theology is the child of Orphic mystagogy: Pythagoras wasthe first to receive initiation from Aglaophamos, Plato in turn received fromthe Pythagorean and Orphic doctrines perfect knowledge concerning thegods. (Proclus PTI.5, 25~26)4This comment at once confirms how important it is for us to under-stand the Neoplatonist position vis-a-vis Pythagoreanism and under-scores the labyrinthine complexity of the Neoplatonic appeal totradition. Once more, Proclus looks back to Plato as an antecedentfor his own appropriation of Pythagoreanism:Plato used mathematical language as a cloaking device, casting it as it wereover the terms, and [veiling] the true nature of things, just as the Theologi-ans used myths, and Pythagoreans employed symbols for the same purpose.(Proclus IT II 246)Perhaps the scholar who has come closest to understanding andconveying this complexity is O'Meara, whose hypothesis, that Pythag-oreanism did not begin to dominate in Platonizing texts until Iam-blichus, is certainly a useful guide for charting what we might callthe ideological ascendancy of Pythagoreanism within Platonism. AsO'Meara tells us:and its necessary distortions will be obvious. Indeed, I see the Pythagorean-Platonicdichotomy as a textbook case of the difficulties that beset a tradition from within,when that tradition defines itself as essentially exegetical or interpretive.3 Hierocles' Commentary on the Golden Verses of Pythagoras also evinces this strategy. Forthe topic of tradition switching and the intersection between philosophy and theol-ogy, see Saffrey 1992.4 Evidently, the importance of Orpheus for the exposition of Platonic theology wasunder dispute during Proclus' days at the Academy. We read in Marinus' Vita Prodithat Proclus' teacher, Syrianus, cherished a desire to introduce a formal lectureseries, either on the Chaldean Oracles or on the Orphic poems. But Domminos, acolleague of Proclus, favored Orpheus, whereas Proclus favored the Oracles. At anyrate, Syrianus' death prevented this course of instruction.118"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"History of an EnigmaA tendency to Pythagoreanize is common in the history of Platonism and isrepresented in different forms and to different degrees among Iamblichus'immediate philosophical predecessors, Numenius, Nicomachus of Gerasa,Anatolius, and Porphyry. However, Iamblichus' program to PythagoreanizePlatonic philosophy was more systematic and far-reaching.5According to O'Meara, the Pythagoreanizing tendencies of laterAthenian Neoplatonism followed in the trail of Iamblichean innova-tions. This influence is especially significant in the work of Proclus,who, however, subordinated Pythagoreanism to Platonism contraIamblichus, while preserving the form of Pythagoreanism by apseudo-geometrical method in the organization of his Elements ofTheology. By contrast, for Iamblichus, Plato stripped of historical ac-cidents turns out to be Pythagoras; all that is ancient, pristine, andaboriginal to the Greek tradition belongs in the lineage of Pythago-ras. And yet, as O'Meara also acknowledges through his survey ofIamblichus' predecessors, Pythagoreanism was deeply influential inthe second and early part of the third centuries as well. Within theEnneads, as we shall see, the presence of Pythagorean symbolism isimpressive, even imposing.6The question before us is, what purpose is served through thisNeoplatonic conceit of pristine wisdom and the Neoplatonic invoca-tion of Pythagoras? To answer this question, we must recognize thecompeting aspects of Platonizing and Pythagoreanizing as fulfillingdifferent functions within Neoplatonic texts. To frame this tension,it will be helpful to observe that insofar as Neoplatonism is an exe-getical tradition, it remains a school that defines itself through itsaffinity to or even appropriation of privileged texts, that is, thedialogues of Plato. But with the invocation of Pythagoras we have adifferent authority for this exegetical tradition, one that exists out-side the authority of the text, and nevertheless authorizes the text. Itwould not be an exaggeration to say that Neoplatonism conceivesitself as a tradition that is forced to allude to something like theprinciple of ineffability as the final authority for its exegetical au-thenticity. Absurd as this may seem at first glance, what the Neopla-5 O'Meara 1989.6 For an earlier but truly encyclopedic history of Pythagorean elements in Neoplatonictexts, cf. Kramer 1964, pp. 292-311.

For Plotinus and the Neoplatonists, Pythagorean the-ory becomes an emblem of the non-discursive, perhaps allowingthem to improvise a discourse that can thereby escape the dictatesof the exegetical tradition. In this sense, the authority extracted fromthe prestige of these symbols allows an alternative to the authority ofthe texts themselves. It is this freedom or hermeneutic space occa-sioned by the appropriation of the Pythagorean elements that nowallows for self-reflection, an extended inquiry into the meaning ofthe tradition, as the remarks of Proclus about the genealogy ofPlatonism reveal. This genealogical convolution that constitutes oneof the most important features of Neoplatonic self-representationshould help us to gauge the intricacies involved in the recovery oftextual meaning within this tradition as well.Previously we saw that Proclus' genealogical approach gave us aclue about the hesitations and difficulties that beset the Neopla-tonic reception of Plato. Perhaps the anecdotal evidence concern-ing Plato's oral teachings and their links to the Pythagorean tradi-tion is the first place to look for the origins of this approach. Onemight turn to the culture of their transmission to learn more aboutthe meaning of these symbols within subsequent stages of the tra-dition. To trace the path of their deployment is to gain access tothe hermeneutic strategies of Neoplatonists, especially that aspectof their hermeneutics that relies on orality or secrecy as an inter-pretive device. The early history of Pythagorean symbolism, re-ported in the fragments of Aristotle's lost dialogue, the Peri Philoso-phias, sets the stage for the subsequent appearances of Pythagoreanallusions in Neoplatonic texts. As is well known, the Peri Philosophiasrelates the Pythagorean elements of Plato's philosophy to an un-written doctrine. It is this unwritten doctrine to which the Neopla-tonists appeal - a wisdom transmitted outside of the texts - in theirown incorporation of Pythagoreanism. For our purposes, we needreview only the essential elements reported in this dialogue, muchof which is reconstructed from Aristotle's brief descriptions in boththe De anima and the Metaphysics as well as in the Commentatortradition.From the commentaries, we learn that Aristotle supposedly dis-cussed the Pythagorean teachings that Plato disseminated during hisdisappointing lecture, \"On the Good,\" in his lost dialogue, Peri120"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"History of an EnigmaPhilosophias. For example, Simplicius tells us, in In De an.,1 'The Periphilosophias reports the contents of Plato's lecture, \"On the Good,\"from Plato's unwritten teaching, in which he records Pythagoreandoctrines and their Platonic interpretation.\"8Aristoxenus gives us a more complete account of the lecture:Aristotle was wont to relate that most of those who heard Plato's discourseon the Good had the following experience. Each came thinking he wouldbe told something about one of the recognized human goods, such aswealth, health or strength, or some marvelous happiness. But when it ap-peared that Plato was to talk on mathematics and numbers and geometryand astronomy, leading up to the statement that the good was unity, theywere overwhelmed by the paradox of the whole matter. {Elements of HarmonyII, 30-31, Meibom)To summarize, we can see that a doxographic tradition associatesPlato with an unwritten Pythagorean doctrine according to whichthe Pythagorean One is identical to the Platonic Good, and thisprinciple together with the source of all multiplicity, the Indetermi-nate dyad, constitutes the foundation of reality. So much is clear,but after this point the doctrine becomes harder to trace.

Sextus Empiricusalso reports a tradition in which the four primal numbers corre-spond to four dimensions: one, two, three, and four points arerespectively necessary to make up the monad, the line, the plane,and the solid. Finally, the latter figures are each associated with amode of intelligence: perceptual, conceptual, intellectual. In the Deanima passage, we find four species of thought, each associated witha dimension of space: to the point corresponds intellect, to the linecorresponds knowledge, to the surface corresponds opinion, and tothe solid corresponds sense-experience (nous, episteme, doxa, ais-thesis).So much is enough for us to see that there is a tradition associat-ing Plato with what might be called a geometric representation ofconsciousness and its elements, a form of representation, moreover,that is anecdotally linked to the so-called unwritten doctrines. For-tunately, the goal here is not to establish the truth or falsity of theoral-teachings hypothesis.10 Rather, the goal is to describe the pathof a hermeneutic trajectory that embraces the Neoplatonic receptionof Plato, in order to understand Neoplatonic self-representation.The esoteric Plato may or may not have existed, but the fact remainsthat the traditional attestation to an unwritten doctrine forms acentral pillar of Neoplatonism, which fully endorses the paradoxesgenerated by Plato's written disparagement of writing.11At this point in our story, however, hermeneutic distortions ofPythagorean symbolism begin to surface in the Neoplatonic interpre-tation. If Aristotle and the Commentator tradition associate Plato'sway in the discourse On Philosophy it was laid down that the Living CreatureItself came from the Idea of Unity Itself together with the first Length, Breadthand Depth, and other things in similar fashion. And in yet another fashion theymake Mind or Intuition be the One, knowledge the Dyad (since it proceeds ina single line to one point), Opinion the number of the Surface, and Sensationthe number of the Solid.On this controversy, see Findlay 1974 and Kramer 1990, who provides an impressivehistory of its vicissitudes in the scholarly community from Schleiermacher on.On this paradox, see of course Derrida's Dissemination and also Ferrari, who mightbe seen as formulating a pragmatist's response to Derrida's prioritization of Platonicwriting.

What is of interest is precisely that thisinterpretive distortion enables the Neoplatonists to rewrite the his-tory of their own tradition under the guise of an almost elementalauthenticity. The latter, Neoplatonic history of Pythagoreanism,could be accused of either simplicity or duplicity with almost equaljustification. In fact, in their enthusiasm for Pythagorean schemas,Neoplatonists seem to forget the iconic nature of these signs andinstead attempt to imbue them with an indexical force. In Plotinus'favorite image, for example, the center stands in for the geometer'spoint, which conceptually takes up no space. Likewise, this entirediagram serves to delineate the space of the intelligible world.To put it another way, the use of Pythagorean symbolism in theNeoplatonic tradition constitutes something like a denial of the se-miotic, despite that it is the most profound indication of the tradi-tion's semiology. If anything, the Neoplatonists seem to hold thatthe geometric forms they favor overcome the need for semioticinterpretation. They subsist in an immediacy of contact with thereader because they purport to open up a space to which the textgrants direct access. In a more modern jargon, one might say thatNeoplatonic Pythagoreanism presents itself as phenomenological, asbeing about the unmediated space of consciousness and not aboutthe tradition presenting or describing that space. Nevertheless, itremains, for all of this, intensely hermeneutic or intersubjective.12The history of Pythagoreanism is what allows these symbols to worktextually in the way that the Neoplatonists would like them to work.The Neoplatonists thus refer back to the Platonic tradition ofmathematical intermediates {Republic 510-511) and thereby situatethe mathematical objects in the soul. If soul is number, then byusing mathematical imagery the Neoplatonists attempt to point outan interior space. Perhaps one could go so far as to suggest anequation between Pythagorean language and the self-conscious eva-sion of the discursive. One might fill out this equation in any num-ber of ways, but Plotinus' diagrams involving the forms of point, line,12 On the differences between hermeneutic and phenomenological approaches tointerpretation, see Silverman, chapter 1.123"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismcircle, and sphere offer a compelling example. It seems that withinthese diagrams, Plotinus sketches a geometry of perception, or ofawareness more generally. At times these diagrams seem to schema-tize consciousness itself, as if offering a kind of ancient emblem forsomething like Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit.Plotinus and the Geometric Representation of Self-ReflectionFor the sake of clarity, often the argument wishes to lead to a conception ofthe multiplicity which has come to be, by positing many lines from onecenter. (EnneadsYl.§.§)The opening lines of the fifth chapter of treatise VI.5 present us withsome evidence about Plotinus' use of geometric symbolism in hisphilosophic enterprise: he frequently has recourse to a geometricrepresentation of reality. This observation is confirmed by otherinternal evidence within the corpus of the Enneads, where the geo-metric representation described in this chapter recurs in an ex-panded format over a dozen times and, in brief compass, in at leasta dozen more. Plotinus employs the diagram of a center, surroundedby one or more concentric circles, to represent the hypostatic viewof reality. The One is symbolized by the center, and each of thecircles stand respectively for nous and soul.13Why and how did Plotinus develop his conception of the intelli-gible universe as rings of light around a central point? This systemseems to compete within the Enneads themselves with another systemthat describes the One as a monad, intellect as the indefinite dyad,and soul as number or multiplicity.14 Certainly, many of Plotinus'descriptions of the intelligible world are fundamentally borrowedfrom the world of mathematics or geometry, despite his being re-puted not to have engaged in mathematical speculation per se.The basic diagram that Plotinus employs is the simple model of a13 Again, one could easily cite any number of similar passages: \"For there is a kind ofcenter, and around this a circle shining out from it, and beyond these another,light from light (IV.3.17.12), or \"Lifting ourselves up by that part of ourselves notimmersed in the body, with this we fasten our own centers to the center of allthings, as if the centers of the great circles [are the same as] the center of theentire sphere that encompasses them.

Theterminal points of the radii form the circumference of the circlesand the lines described by the radii fill up the surface of the circlessurrounding the center. The geometric figures representing the hy-postases are often described by means of mathematical images: justas are numbers, these images are conceived of as generating, multi-plying, being added and subtracted. In this system of imagery thebasic Plotinian conception of deriving all things from unity takes ona literal character as a process of metaphysical subtraction and addi-tion.15This image of a radiant circle, a spider's web or vortex of possibil-ity, a matrix of becoming, is repeated throughout the Enneads as akind of visionary siglum, an index that Plotinus is reverting to anancient wisdom whose voice can be heard only in the reverberationsof a symbol that carries with it the aspect of authenticity. The imageof the radiant circle is for Plotinus an emblem of visionary truth.Layer upon layer of meaning is woven into the fabric of the image.The details of its mathematical transformations are conveyed oftenby means of imperatives that seem at once precise and formulaic:remove, add, contract, subtract. This same language of mathematicssurrounds Plotinus' descriptions of the emergence of the secondhypostasis, as is well known.16 Plotinus refers to the inchoate nous asthe indefinite,17 or as pure indefiniteness (aoristia, apeiria, apeiron),and incorporates the Pythagorean symbolism of monad and dyad aselements within his account of ontological proliferation:Therefore this multiple intellect, when it wishes to intelligize that which isbeyond, wishes to intelligize that itself as one, but wishing to apprehend itin its simplicity emerges continually grasping something else multiplied initself. (V. 3.11.1-4)Before the Dyad is the One, and the Dyad is second and from the One, thathas it as something indefinite, but this is indefinite of itself. It is otherness,movement, desire, and life.

Plotinus pur-posefully associates his doctrines with particular images that possessan undeniable cultural prestige and immediately invoke an entirephilosophical milieu. At the very least, this practice serves as a kindof textual mnemonics that brings to mind the ambiguous status ofthe text itself. This ambiguity is captured by the very appearance ofa symbol that is associated with an explicit doctrinal content but thatserves as well to disrupt the text. One scholar, speculating on thequalitatively different forms of textuality presented by these images,remarks:The glyphs, however, are not merely the passive objects of this hermeneutic,but are also the constituents of the very exegetical methodology itself. Ifindividual hieroglyphic words reveal essences, we might say that the totalfield of operation of the glyphs and their interrelations constitutes a kind ofgrammar of essences. The glyphs teach the very process of their own deci-pherment. Taken together, they reveal a system of acquiring knowledge bothabout them and through them.21The central Neoplatonic metaphor for self-recollection or self-knowledge, reversion, is graphically captured in these diagrams. Tounderstand Plotinus' obsession with the relationship of the center tothe periphery of the circle, we must translate into our own languageof self-reflection and see that, through this diagram, Plotinus meansto describe certain aspects of the relationship between consciousnessand its objects.

When Plotinus describes intellectual activity as rever-sion or epistrophe, he seems to invoke the priority of the knowerover any of its cognitive objects.For Plotinus, the image of the sphere signifies reflexive self-knowledge:If then our circles were bodily, not soul-circles, they would be in touch withthe center at a place; the center would be in some place and they would bearound it; but since the souls themselves belong to the realm of Intellectand the One transcends Intellect, we must suppose that the contact takesplace by other powers, in the way in which the thinker is naturally united tothe thought. .. (VI.9.8.20-21)This reflexivity of consciousness, if it is signified through Plotinus'geometry of reflection, is most importantly a dialectical stance incul-cated in or offered to the reader. Although this reflexive viewpointentails a metaphysical order into which the subject's identity perhapscollapses or disappears, Plotinus' metaphor is a dynamic model inwhich the fulcrum of consciousness is preserved throughout. Indeed,it would seem that Plotinus here adopts the strategy of underdeter-mining or saying as little as possible about the nature of the realitythat embraces or pervades this reflexive moment. The thought ex-periments that Plotinus engages in do not specify an entity that canbe picked out by means of this dialectical position, as this or asthat.22 As was said earlier, the most that such a \"witness\" self, orsubject of consciousness, would have to say for itself would be, \"am,am,\" or \"I, I.\"23Mathematics gives access to the notion of a spaceless and timeless22 For this reason, Plotinus' reflexive self does imply the contradictions entailed bythe notion of a transcendent entity, or \"thing that thinks.\" In other words, thatwhich thinks, for Plotinus, is surely not a thing. Rather than offering the reader akind of false door behind the limits of phenomena, Plotinus is interested in a formof apprehension that does not instantiate this reflexivity, but consists in a way ofseeing that may be either embraced or rejected according to the proclivity of theperson seeing. For the inherent contradictions in the Cartesian subject of conscious-ness as transcendent substance, see the extended discussion by Zizek 1993, chapter1, \"The Void Called Subject.\"23 EnneadsV.%. 10.36.127"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismgeneration precisely because it is empirically obvious that this inte-rior form of addition and subtraction does not affect or give rise toan exterior space or world. Mathematics allows the Platonist to con-front a universe that is nevertheless wholly immaterial. This acosmicaspect of geometric symbolism circumvents the question of cosmol-ogy and with it, the question of the origins of the exterior world.Instead, the mathematics of timeless generation leaves room foreveryone to function as the supreme mathematician. It is by subtract-ing and adding elements to our world that we come to participate inthe genesis of vision. In this sense, the symbols that Plotinus uses aremeant to carry the force of self-exegesis within them.The Interior World and the Geometry of RecollectionAlthough it is difficult to reconstruct the meaning and purpose ofthe geometric diagrams in the Enneads, a speculative interpretationthat points to parallels in the Hermetic tradition and its subsequenthistory at least suggests that these diagrams can be associated withthe process of self-recollection. A parallel text from the Corpus Her-meticum can allow us more fully to discuss Plotinus' apparent interestin using the faculty of imagination as a kind of analogy for intellect.What I hope to show is that both Plotinus and the Corpus Hermeticumpoint the reader toward a conception of interiority in which theexperience of imaginative production functions as a kind of middleground or even metaphor for the self-reflexive nous.In particular, certain of the Hermetica present a set of imaginativeexercises that form the substance of an initiatory dialogue betweenteacher and disciple. As in the Enneads, so also within these texts, weobserve a dialectical stance that operates at the level of a sharedconvention - the convention of active imagination, or structuredfantasy. Corpus Hermeticum XI, for example, presents us with an initi-atory sequence in which nous itself attempts to reveal its nature byprescribing a meditation, not on some specific imaginary object, buton the imagination as the object. Nous attempts to resituate thestudent with respect to the world by referring to the imaginationand so says, \"in incorporeal imagination things are located differ-ently\" (CH XI, 18). In the same dialogue, the self-revealing nousgoes on to develop this notion of interior space, again emphasizingfeatures of the imagination within this dialectics of transformation:128"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"History of an Enigma19.

Command it to cross over to the ocean,and again it will quickly be there, not as having passed from place to place,but simply as being there . . . 20. See what power you have, what quickness!24For subsequent interpreters of the Hermetic tradition, Pythagoreansymbolism was thought to involve a technique of meditation in whichthe imagination figured heavily. The Renaissance Hermeticists elab-orated a method for bringing about an imaginary world, claiming\"that, in its approximation, this world was an imperfect equivalentof realities existing on an ontological level inaccessible to directexperience.\"25It is of some interest that the Renaissance Platonists also foundthis same self-reflexive pedagogy operating in the texts of the Herme-tica, and that they associated the Corpus Hermeticum with their spiri-tualized art of memory.26 The briefest glance at the Renaissancememory work can in turn provide a useful way to frame this traditionof imaginative pedagogy in the subsequent history of Neoplato-nism.27 Giordano Bruno, for example, places the Hermetic idea ofthe human microcosm who is able to contain the macrocosm, at thecenter of his occult memory work. In his visionary work, Seals, hewrites, \"As the world is said to be the image of God, so Trismegistusdoes not fear to call man the image of the world.\"28 Yates, in herbrilliant presentation of Camillo's Theater of Memory, discusses theHermetic conception of the microcosm in the form of Camillo'sclaim that he is able to remember the universe by \"looking down onit from above.\" As Yates says, \"The microcosm can fully understandand fully remember the macrocosm, can hold it within his divinememory.\"29Readers of Yates's pivotal work will perhaps recall Camillo's designfor a cosmic 'Theater of Memory' - essentially, a composite surfacedesigned to help the practitioner reflect the talismanic images em-ployed in Renaissance magic. That the Hermetists derived or falsely24 Corpus Hermeticum XI, 19 and 20, Copenhaver translation.25 Garin i960.26 See, most importantly, Yates 1966 and Garin 1961.27 For two much deeper treatments of the topic of imagination as a prelude tointellect, see Charles and Moutsopoulos.28 Bruno, Seals, pp. 129-30, translated and quoted in Yates 1966, p. 254.29 Yates 1966, p. 148.129"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismimputed these images to Egyptian astrological works demonstratestheir enthusiasm for an ancient mode of inducing vision as theexpansion of a cosmic memory. As Yates points out in her magisterialwork:Such inner, or imaginative, use of talismanic imagery, would surely find amost suitable vehicle for its use in the occultised version of the art ofmemory. If the basic memory images used in such a memory system had, orwere supposed to have, talismanic power, power to draw down the celestialinfluences and spiritus within the memory, such a memory would becomethat of the \"divine\" man in intimate association with the divine powers ofthe cosmos. And such a memory would also have, or be supposed to have,the power of unifying the contents of memory by basing it upon these imagesdrawn from the celestial world. The images of Camillo's theater seem tohave in them something of this power, enabling the \"spectator\" to read offat one glance, through \"inspecting the images\" the whole contents of theuniverse.... In this way, the cosmically based memory would be supposed,not only to draw power from the cosmos into the memory, but to unifymemory. (Yates p. 155)Once more, to invoke yet another Renaissance Hermetist's inter-est in the imagination, we can turn to the fifteenth-century translatorand philosopher Marsilio Ficino. As Eugenio Garin tells us, Ficino'sconception of philosophy as essentially initiatory involves the privi-leged place of the Hermetic writings in his own system. Ficino de-scribes a method of intellectual ascent through the invocation of animaginal vision. This vision was to be cultivated through intensemeditation on the so-called figurae of the soul, that is, on the soul'sown imaginary constructions. These Hermetists translate the Pla-tonic notion of the \"eye of the soul\" (Phaedrus 247) into the facultyof the imagination, or oculus Imaginationis. This inner eye provides aglimpse into the nature of the intellect because it reveals an interiorworld and hints at the vast expanse of the soul itself.It is important to observe that even within this historically remotetradition, the geometric representations used by the Hermetists intheir memory work are meant to coincide with a technique of self-reflection. To this extent, the images are not systematic. Rather, forthe Hermetists they are more deitic. They indicate a textual sleightof hand and are meant to suggest an anti-discursive or, rather, aninterior, space. Present within the imagination, they both permeatethis ground and, by calling attention to it, illuminate it after a fash-ion.130"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"History of an EnigmaHence it becomes appropriate to ask how the Neoplatonists makeuse of this space that opens up underneath the gaze of the subjectin their own work on images and the faculty of the imagination.Once more this question surfaces when we turn to look at the fifth-century philosopher Proclus, who is arguably one the strongest pro-ponents of what can be called a Neoplatonic geometry of recollec-tion.Geometry and Theurgy in Proclus and IamblichusMuch work has already been done on Proclus' use of mathematics,on his cognitive theory of the imagination, and on the pervasivenessof mathematical or geometric analogies in Proclan metaphysics.30Thus for readers familiar with the work of Beierwaltes or of Moutso-poulos, the discussion that follows will provide perhaps no morethan a gloss on the work of these scholars. Nevertheless, since we aretracing the history of interpretation, looking fox* the hermeneuticpathway of Neoplatonism, it is important to summarize Proclus' workon the geometric tradition, insofar as it reflects the non-discursivepedagogies embedded within the the larger exegetical enterprise ofthe Neoplatonists.Proclus' Commentary on the First Book of Euclid's Elements is probablythe most important ancient source for charting the Neoplatonicreconciliation of Platonic mathematical pedagogy, as outlined inPlato's Republic, and the neo-Pythagorean arithmology as celebrated,for example, in such texts as Nichomachus of Gerasa's Theology ofArithmetic. Proclus actually attaches two distinct prefaces to his Com-mentary; the first attempts to argue for the role of mathematics inthe education of the understanding, and the second contains a moreloosely argued history of geometry, emphasizing especially its signif-icance in the Platonic curriculum.31 Although Proclus does referextensively to classical works, including the Republic's doctrine ofmathematical intermediaries as well as to the De anima's doctrine ofthe imagination as passive intelligence, he also insinuates a seem-ingly more original geometry of recollection, first adumbratedCf.

In fact, geometry as a scienceis \"coextensive with all existing things, applies its reasonings to themall, and includes all their kinds in itself\" (IP 62, 1-2). Hence it iscapable of teaching us \"through images the special properties of thedivine orders\" (IP 62, 5-6).Behind this rather grandiose, for a Platonist, claim about thescope of geometry lies Proclus' theory of the imagination, whichbuilds on the Platonic and Aristotelian models but again strikes outin a very original direction as evidenced in the Euclid commentaryand elsewhere. To briefly review the central features of his theory ofimagination, we find Proclus here suggesting that the imagination isa kind of intermediate ground between soul and intellect. In onepassage, Proclus describes this intermediary function as a faculty thatis capable of reflecting, by means of spatial realizations or render-ings, the abstract ideas present in the discursive intellect.For this is the reason also he [Euclid] gives his work the subtitle \"planegeometry.\" And thus we must think of the plane as projected and lyingbefore our eyes and the understanding as writing everything upon it, theimagination becoming something like a plane mirror to which the ideas ofthe understanding send down impressions of themselves. (IE 12.11-6)This psychic space functions as a mirror and as a window to theintelligible space upon which the soul borders. But the imaginationis, as it were, a two-way mirror; herein lies the innovation to be foundin Proclus' theory of the imagination. Earlier we saw that the imagi-nation translates the language of the ideas into a kind of pictogram,thus making it possible for the embodied soul to comprehend geo-metrical properties. Additionally, however, this same faculty of imag-ination also directs the soul's attention inward, away from its ownrepresentations.Therefore just as nature stands creatively above the visible figures, so thesoul, exercising her capacity to know, projects on the imagination, as on amirror, the ideas of figures; and the imagination, receiving in pictorial formthese impressions of the ideas within the soul, by their means affords the32 All quotes are from the Morrow translation (Morrow 1992).132"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"History of an Enigmasoul an opportunity to turn inward from the pictures and attend to herself.(ZE141)Geometry in this sense becomes a form of self-disclosure: \"as if aman looking at himself in a mirror should wish to look upon himselfdirectly\" (IE 141, 10). Thus in his own interpretations of the geo-metric figures of point, line, circle, and sphere, Proclus discovers apath of intellectual reversion that operates by means of a contempla-tive geometry. Proclus' geometry of cognition emphasizes the reflex-ivity of consciousness, its ability to recover its own origins throughan investigation of this interior world. It seems to be something likean art of memory to which Proclus refers when he interprets thePythagorean geometric tradition in his Commentary on Euclid's Ele-ments. Here we find him meditating on the reflexive powers of theimagination:[the soul] wants to enter within herself to see the circle and the triangle,there, all things without parts and all in one another, to become one withwhat she sees and enfold their plurality, to behold the secret and ineffablefigures in the inaccessible places and shrines of the gods. (IE 141.22)Proclus then links this geometry of self-recollection to the methodof intellectual ascent, as when, for example, he discusses the seriesof objects that can be traced initially from the image of the circle:Clearly then the self-moved figure is prior to that which is moved by another;the partless is prior to the self moved; and prior to the partless is the figurewhich is identical with unity. For all figures attain consummation in theHenads, the source from which they all entered into being (IE 142.2-5).Proclus sees this kind of interior vision as a path to unity, proceed-ing from the act of unifying the mind by means of the imaginationand then developing toward what might be described as an ever-deeper self-expansion within the horizons of interior vision. Al-though we find this extraordinary passage in his Commentary on Eu-clid's Elements, Proclus informs us that this geometry of vision belongsto the Pythagorean tradition when he writes, \"we have drawn out atgreat length these matters of the Pythagorean doctrine.\"3333 For a much more thorough discussion of Proclan metaphysics and its relation toIamblichan Pythagoreanizing, see the groundbreaking work of O'Meara, especiallythe chapter entitled \"Proclus on Mathematics,\" section 8, \"The Method of Geom-etry,\" pp. 171-73.

As such, it becomes in Proclus'hands an emblem of a non-discursive, or unitive, way of knowing.Proclus says later in the same work,If you divide bodiless things into soul and Nous, you will say that the circlehas the character of nous, the straight line that of soul. That is why the soul,as she reverts to nous, is said to move in a circle... . Again, if you distinguishbody and soul, you will put everything that is body on the side of the straightline and make everything psychical partake of the identity and homogeneityof the circle. (IE 147.15)Elsewhere in his works, Proclus conceives of the circle especially asan icon of self-knowledge:To intelligent beings the circle gives the power of being continuously activein relation to themselves, enabling them to be filled with knowledge fromtheir own store, to assemble the intelligibles in themselves and perfect theirinsights from within. For nous always gives itself the object of its thought,and this object, is as it were its center. (77TI 148)Werner Beierwaltes, too, in his pioneering study of the geometricimagery employed by Proclus and Plotinus, develops an interpreta-tion of this imagery that emphasizes its association with the non-discursive.34 For Beierwaltes, the geometry of the radiant circle refersprimarily to \"thinking that thinks itself/' or, in his words, to \"theself-transparency of thought concerning the assimilation of the indi-vidual thought objects in itself to a reflexive oneness.\"35 Accordingto this commentator, this geometry of perception describes the trans-formation of the subject-object relationship within the act of know-ing, involving a successful circumvention of the disruptive momentof intentionality.36 The play of movement from center to peripheryblichean tradition that privileges arithmetic (a tradition that produced such worksas the Theobgoumena Arithmetica). Proclus reverts to a more Platonic emphasis ongeometry, particularly working with the Republic's assignment of a mediatory role togeometry (Republic 510D-51 lb, cited by O'Meara).This chapter can in no way do justice to the complexity and detail of Beierwaltes'smagisterial study, to which we owe so much of what we know about Neoplatonicmethodology.Beierwaltes 1965.For a discussion of intentionality and the Neoplatonic circumvention of intention-ality, see above chapters 3 and 4.134"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"History of an Enigmatraces the path of an \"intuitive seeing without opposition and [al-ludes] to an oxymoronic not seeing.\"37By remetaphorizing the notion of epistrophe, the circle embodiesor even becomes a kind of literal configuration of the non-discursive,a consummate emblem of self-knowledge:The circle is an image of intellect, for it remains within and proceeds withits generated powers and turns toward itself in the gnosis that grasps itselfequally in all directions. {In Rent. II 46, 18-21)Finally, this geometric symbolism develops into an almost Hermeticmeditation on the macrocosm, as not just the mind but the worlditself is described as turning in the circle of intellect: \"the world isthe same as the eye and its vision and the ear and its object and theone aisthesis knows all things in itself\" (ITU 85, 17-19). This worldthat is directly experienced as the content of soul is revealed in theimagination. Meditating on the world within the mind brings abouta unified memory or awareness that seems to move about the soul asself-mover and lures that soul ever deeper into the stretches of itsown infinity. In one way, awareness is like a line that projects from acenter, stretching outward from the source of awareness, and inanother way, the mind encloses itself and turns back on itself asProclus is fond of telling us, like a living dance. As Beierwaltes says:\"in the circular return and procession the soul transforms itself,becomes and takes back what it lost in the dimensions of time andotherness.\"38For Beierwaltes, the dance of the soul about its center expressesthe freedom and expansiveness that comes with a more developedsense of the interior. There is a detachment of consciousness, aseparation of the soul from its objects. This same imagery of thesoul's dance of awareness appears in the Enneads, where the experi-ence of unity is likened to a circle or circumference with all the radiientirely filled in. The mnemonics of the self, the geometry of percep-tion that describes and inscribes the space of consciousness, is acentral part of Neoplatonic methodology. The space that ariseswithin this sort of meditation functions as a counter space or interi-ority that balances one's experience of being immersed within the37 Beierwaltes 1965.38 Beierwaltes 1965."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismworld of objects. And yet, for all of this imagery's persuasive power,one must never lose sight of the fact that it is surrounded by para-dox. It tells us of an expanse that has no dimensions and, paradoxi-cally, of a knowing that knows no object. This constant meditationon the paradox of subjectivity and its transformation by what isapparently a geometry of recollection might appear repetitive, naive,or just impossible to the reader of today. But it comprises one of therichest and most expressive moments within the Neoplatonist lan-guage of vision.This discussion of geometric symbolism, particularly the image ofthe sphere, has certainly not done justice to the rich Pythagoreantradition (or neo-Pythagorean tradition) that we find proliferatingin the texts of Plotinus, Proclus, and Iamblichus. Nor have I eventouched on the historical connections that link Proclus, for example,to the Pythagorean tradition, via Iamblichus (whose own work hasbeen recently shown to reflect the neo-Pythagorean thought ofNichomachus) .39 Nevertheless, it is at least plausible to suggest thatthe arithmetic and the geometric function as very different concep-tual systems, at any rate for Proclus.40 Indeed, Proclus tells us asmuch in his Commentary on the Timaeus, where in a digression on thechiastic shape of the soul, he distinguishes between two differentways of representing reality, the arithmetic and the geometric {IT IIIn this same section, Proclus goes on to make his rather well-known remark, that 'Tlato used mathematics as a method of con-cealing the true reality, just as the Theologians used myth, and thePythagoreans used symbols.\" Since number represents division andis based primarily on the monad, and geometry represents continuityand is based primarily on the point, these two methods of describingreality are complementary: the soul partakes both in the discreet andthe continuous. Perhaps hidden in these remarks Proclus suggeststhat the geometric method of representation can offer a clearerimage of unity than the arithmetic method.41 What is important for39 Again, see O'Meara's book for this fascinating bit of detective work linking Iambli-chus and Nichomachus.40 O'Meara of course makes this very point in his chapter on Proclus and mathemat-ics.41 Cf. also, Trouillard 1983, p. 234, cited in Shaw 1995, p. 195.136"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"History of an Enigmaus is the singular contribution that this unique deployment of Py-thagoreanism makes to Proclus' own articulation of a non-discursivemethodology that is trapped so completely by the world and spaceof the texts it purports to overshadow.In the conclusion to this chapter, we turn briefly to the theurgictradition. So far, I have been arguing that the Neoplatonic traditionshapes itself through appropriation of elements that accentuate itsown emphasis on wisdom outside of texts. Self-recollection, non-discursive thinking, reflexive consciousness, and imaginal projection- all of these are tags that apply to the function of Pythagoreansymbolism as found in the Neoplatonic context. And yet the ritualaffiliations of this kind of symbolism outweigh its textual deploy-ment. In other words, for the later Neoplatonists especially, mathe-matics forms part of theurgic operations.42 To the extent that Proclusmakes use of Pythagorean elements, he alludes to a pristine traditionand perhaps also suggests that these same elements possess a powerthat surpasses the intellectual context in which he presents them:The unifying numbers, in themselves are unknowable. For they are moreancient than Beings and more unified than Forms, and since they are thegenerators of Forms they exist prior to those beings we call 'intelligibles.'The most august of theurgies demonstrate this, since they make use ofnumbers capable of acting ineffably, and by means of them, they effect thegreatest and most ineffable of operations. (PTTV, 100.21-101)Walter Burkert has pointed out the ritualistic dimensions of thePythagorean Tetrakys, suggesting that the theurgical dimensions ofnumber theory are a conscious replacement for traditional ritualism:The Tetrakys, a \"tetrad\" made up of unequal members, is a cryptic formula,only comprehensible to the initiated. The word inevitably reminds of Trikys,the \"triad\" of different sacrificial animals. Is the sacrificial art of the seer,involving the shedding of blood, superseded by a \"higher\" bloodless se-cret?43The ritual associations with Pythagorean mathematics are also seenin the Iamblichean formula, according to which the human being ismade up of two numbers:42 For an extremely penetrating account of mathematics and theurgy, see Shaw 1995.43 Burkert, 1972, p. 187, quoted in Shaw 1995, p. 198."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismFor since animals are made up of soul and body, the Pythagoreans say souland body are not produced from the same number, but soul from cubicnumber and body from the irregular volume.As Shaw points out, the word bomikos (irregular volume) also de-scribes the shape of an altar, and the very idea of volume seems tohave had a role to play in the Chaldean conception of geometry.Lewy explains the Oracle, \"do not deepen the plane,\"44 as referringto the successive stages of embodiment or material manifestation ofreality.

Ac-cording to Iamblichus, Plato's successors identify the soul with num-ber: Speusippus taught that the soul was a geometrical figure, Xe-nocrates that soul was a number, and Moderatus, a mathematicalharmony.46 Again, in the Life of Pythagoras, Iamblichus states thatPythagoras \"practiced a marvelous divination and worship of theGods according to the numbers most allied to them\"(VP 147).In chapter 22 of On the Common Mathematical Science, Iamblichusexplains the significance of the Pythagorean tradition.47 In this chap-ter, he speaks of a \"mathematical askesis,\" aimed at the refinementof thought and purification of knowledge, affording human beings44 Hans Lewy, \"Chaldean Oracles and Theurgy,\" pp. 394-6.

Nevertheless, he refrains from discussing proceduresassociated with theurgy practiced at the highest levels, for souls es-sentially identified with the intelligible order. Without wishing torepeat Shaw's careful discussion of Iamblichean mathematical the-urgy, I think it important to cite his conclusions, since they shed agreat deal of light on the traditional notion of a symbolon.Briefly then, according to Iamblichus, theurgic ritual involves in-stalling the deity in a receptacle (hypodoche), or symbolon, appropriateto the god. By connecting through ritual to this receptacle, theworshipper actually attains union with the god invoked: \"the theur-gic art discovers receptacles adapted to each of the gods\" (DM 233).Because the goal of the rite is union with the god, part of its successdepends on the displacement of self, or projection onto the recep-tacle. That is, the worshipper must somehow identify with the deitythrough the medium of the symbolon.Perhaps concentration on an imaginary symbolon by fully absorb-ing one's attention in the object could be considered, in this sense,a form of theurgic worship, a displacement of self onto the symbolthat leads to a unitive awareness.

This dimension of theurgic worship, the dis-placement of a separate self that initially confronts the object ofworship as external or as outside the self, relies on an erotic identi-fication with the object for its completion. This identificationcomes about through an expansion of the boundaries of the self, awillingness to remove the veil of separation that distinguishes souland deity. And this identification is represented in the Platonic-Pythagorean teaching that soul is a number.Other references to theurgic worship are found in more theoreti-cal texts, particularly in the Late Athenian Academy. Proclus andDamascius often allude to theurgic worship in the course of distin-guishing different grades or stages of noesis. For example, they fre-quendy cite verses from the Chaldean Oracles, a collection of frag-ments supposedly divinely revealed to Julian the Theurgist in thesecond century. The verses, written in hexameters, reflect a MiddlePlatonic theology akin to that of Numenius but also make use of anumber of distinctions that become important for the later AthenianNeoplatonists, such as the triadic structures contained within thesecond hypostasis.51 Damascius quotes fragment 1 in his chapter onthe Unified (the third element of his Intelligible Triad) in his Doubtsand Solutions Concerning First Principles. Here, in the midst of a tech-nical discussion concerning the nature of the intelligible object,Damascius quotes the following verses:There is something intelligible, which you should know in the flower of theintellect.If you turn your own intellect toward it and know it as an object, then youwill not know it.Standard editions of the Chaldean Oracles include Oracles Chaldaiques, ed.

His central question in this chapter is, how canwe speak of knowing as a relationship that exists between the mind,on the one hand, and an object that is said to be unified (that is,unified with the mind), on the other. The identity thesis, if it positsthis unity between mind and object, seems to disassemble itself fromwithin, since how can this relationship obtain between two unifiedentities, if this relationship is construed as adventitious? Damascius'commentary is instructive in this regard:The mind abandons itself to the object of knowledge in order to attain unitywith it, desiring to be intelligible and no longer intellectual. For there is nodistinction separating the [mind and that object] but wholly unified itpresses on to dissolve itself and be unified with the unified and it denies alldistinction, even that distinction between itself and the object known . . .(C-WII, 105, 18-21)One point stands out in Damascius' interpretation of the Oracle. Heseems to construe the phrase \"backward turning eye,\" with the word\"mind\" {psyche). So in this form of knowing the mind should aban-don itself and achieve complete identification with the object ofcontemplation. In many of the passages and exercises we have con-sidered, self-displacement is a fundamental part of the process.Therefore, the exercise starts out from the position of introspectionbut ends up, as was already said, with a displacement of the self ontothe object contemplated.This is another example in which the psychology of contempla-tion informs a more general epistemology. In this case, the psychol-ogy is disclosed through reference to a contemplative object en-dowed with ritual and traditional associations. The hermeneuticcomplexities of this passage illustrate the importance of textuality asa medium through which the tradition can posit an extra-textualcontext.

As in the previouschapter, I start from the text of Plato and work forward in history.In all likelihood, the central Orphic myth implied the ritual death,dismemberment, and reconstitution of the initiate. Plato makes useof this ritual motif to underscore his analysis of selfhood and self-transcendence. Later in the tradition, the initiatory associations withOrphic symbolism are appropriated to authorize supposedly esotericinterpretations of Plato's dialogues. Orpheus, from the enchantedvisionary of the earlier tradition, becomes a metaphysically astutetheologian for the later Neoplatonists.Throughout its transmigrations over the centuries, one particularepisode in this myth, the rending of Dionysus, enjoys perhaps thegreatest celebrity or notoriety.1 This episode has clear ritual associa-tions, as the initiated candidate and the suffering god undergo par-allel experiences in different zones, so to speak. The mythohistoryof the cosmos revealed in the Orphic theology contains as its finalepisode an etiology for specifically human consciousness, in therending of Dionysus at the hands of the Titans. The physical detailsof the myth, with its elements of androgynous self-impregnation,solipsistic world swallowing, transgression, rebellion, and finally sex-ual sparagmos - collapse of the androgynous self into a genderedbeing - provide all the necessary elements for a psychoanalytic read-1 The classic article on this episode remains Pepin, \"Plotin et le mirroir de Dionysius.\"143"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonisming.2 While I will not be subjecting versions of this narrative to apsychoanalytic reading per se, it is nevertheless my contention thatthese versions offer models or perhaps more accurately, explana-tions, for the specifically human form of consciousness. At times (as,for example, in the Phaedo commentary of the sixth-century exegete,Olympiodorus) we find this myth invoked to explain such phenom-ena as egotism or envy. In this sense, there are psychoanalytic appli-cations for the myth within the tradition itself. In this chapter, I lookat the Orphic theology within the Neoplatonic exegetical tradition,paying particular attention to the Dionysus episode. This narrativemotif is used by Plato and the subsequent tradition to develop thetheme of philosophical initiation.Nevertheless, the Neoplatonists exude a kind of enthusiasm forOrphic detective work that perhaps exceeds their roles as exegetes;we find them playing fast and loose with the narrative structure ofthe myth, hypostasizing or reifying some of the most unlikely ele-ments, and importing their almost baroque metaphysical schemasinto the most unlikely parts of the text. Although here I can onlybriefly sketch some of the forms this narrative takes in Late Neopla-tonism, in chapters 8 and 9,1 will take up, respectively, Proclus' andDamascius' overall theory of philosophical exegesis. Only then willtheir treatments of the Orphic material become fully intelligible.In the last chapter, we looked at the geometric tradition as offer-ing a textual emblem representing the space of consciousness andsignifying the reflexive stance within which a singular dialecticalposition was formulated. By contrast, the Orphic myth leads thereader in a confusing search for the identity that it conveys, in anumber of competing directions, throughout the history of its tex-tual deployment. Its first significant appearance, in Plato's Sympo-sium, tells the story of a fragmented consciousness or absence of aunified subject. In subsequent metempsychoses, for example, in thewritings of Proclus, it conveys the stages of a visionary journey and,2 In fact, one might trace the Lacanian ungendered \"hommelette\" ultimately to theandrogynous Phanes who gives birth to the world egg.

In Late AthenianNeoplatonism we find the Orphic myth drawn into a more elaborateangelology, or catalogue of deities. The myth's protagonist, knownalternatively as Phanes, or Protogonos, or Eros, finds his place inPlatonic theologies of Syrianus, Proclus, and Damascius, at the cen-ter of the intellectual world, at the juxtaposition between the intel-lectual and intelligible regions. The myth recounts the moment inwhich the individual soul wakes up and discovers its connection to astructure that is repeated ad infinitum throughout the multipleplanes of existence. This moment of recollection is peculiarly cap-tured in the Dionysus episode, which both tells the story of the fallinto human consciousness and also functions as the source for a neworientation. In the tradition of the mysteries, this vision enables thesoul to return to its origin, to the One, to the intelligible mundus,and so forth. The Neoplatonists recur to Orphism in an attempt tocommunicate their conception of the pedagogy of the soul or mys-tagogy leading to self-realization.Recent work has done much to uncover Plato's own appropriationof Orphic and Pythagorean teachings, and Peter Kingsley has nowdevoted an important book to establishing this connection througha close reading of the mythic passages in Plato's Phaedo and Gorgias.3The discovery of the Derveni papyrus, a work that will be discussedin more detail later, has confirmed scholarly conjecture about theOrphic setting or tone of the myths in both of these dialogues, sincethis papyrus \"consists of the allegorical interpretation of a poemascribed to Orpheus.\"4 In particular, the subterranean geography inthe Phaedo myth, together with its underground rivers and unhappyresidents, those moral failures condemned eternally to ' 'lying in the3 Kingsley, pp. 115, ff.

It also includes a sequence in which the Titans consume theinfant Dionysus (later repaired by Apollo) and then pay dearly fortheir crime with a blast of Zeus' thunderbolt. Their blood falls to theearth and spawns the human race. In all likelihood, this myth im-plied the ritual death, dismemberment, and reconstitution of theinitiate; hence its association with initiatory ritual.Before the discovery of the Derveni papyrus, three versions of theOrphic myth were distinguished: first, the Rhapsodic Theogony, pre-served by Damascius and Christian apologists, in which Chronosproduces a cosmic egg, which then hatches into Phanes, the bisexualbeing who creates the world. Phanes is eventually swallowed andregurgitated by Zeus, who recreates the world through this act ofdigestion. Second, the Eudemian and the most ancient version,mainly attested in Aristophanes' Birds, 414 B.C.E., lines 693-703, butalso supposedly known by the Peripatetic Eudemus, in which Nightcreates the cosmic egg. A third version, that of the enigmatic Hieron-ymus or Hellanikus, was attested to solely in the writings of Damas-cius.Damascius summarizes three different versions of the Orphic the-ogony toward the end of his monumental work Doubts and SolutionsConcerning First Principles. His account of the different versions is5 See Kingsley, chapter 10, \"Plato and Orpheus.\" On Damascius and Orphic mythol-ogy, see below and especially Brisson 1990.6 On this controversy, again see Kingsley, p. 126, and Brisson 1995b.146"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Transmigrations of a Myth: Orphic Texts and Platonic Contextsobscured by his overarching schema, which consists in forcing thevarious narrative episodes to fit into his triadic model of what hecalls the \"noetic diacosm.\" He begins his summary by referring tothe \"Theology [narrated] in these currently circulating OrphicRhapsodies.\" West has concluded that this so-called Rhapsodic The-ogony \"was a composite work, created in the late Hellenistic periodas a conflation of earlier Orphic poems. Under the Empire it was theOrphic theogony, and it was frequently quoted and alluded to, es-pecially by the Neoplatonists\" (West 1983, p. 69).Damascius gives only the barest outline of this Rhapsodic versionand goes on to discuss in considerable detail theTheology propounded by Hieronymus and Hellanikus (unless he is the sameperson) [that] goes like this: Originally there was water he (Orpheus) says,and mud, from which the earth solidified: he posits these two as first princi-ples, water and earth . . . The one before the two, however he leaves unex-pressed, his very silence being an intimation of its ineffable nature. Thethird principle after the two was engendered by these - earth and water, thatis - and was a serpent with extra heads growing upon it of a bull and a lion,and a god's countenance in the middle; it had wings upon its shoulders, andits name was Unaging Time and also Heracles. (R 317-19, translation ofWest 1983, p. 178)These versions of the theology were formulated at various timesthroughout the centuries that preceded Damascius' writings: on thebasis of the reference to Herakles, for example, West conjecturesthat the version of Hieronymus was a Hellenistic, Stoicizing version.What is poignant about their inclusion at the end of the Doubts andSolutions is their historical placement. This treatise represents, as weshall see in chapter 9, the last word, so to say, of Neoplatonistmetaphysics and the closure, therefore, of pagan philosophy. Damas-cius prefers to seal this compendium of Neoplatonic teachings withthe \"purification of our own pronouncements\" (R. 316) about thenature of the divine, and so turns to a revealed tradition.The importance of Damascius' Peri Archon for our knowledge ofOrphism consists in its being a source for many of the Orphic frag-ments. In fact, it possesses a double interest from a textual point ofview. To quote from Luc Brisson:1) Damascius is the only Neoplatonist to have mentioned three differentversions of the Orphic Theogony: The Sacred Discourse [or the RhapsodicTheogony], certainly, since that was the current version, but also that of147"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismEudemus (which was an earlier version) and that of Hieronymus. 2) Withregard to the Rhapsodic [Theogony] the testimony of Damascius permits acomparison between the testimony of Proclus and the testimony of Olympio-dorus.Brisson draws four conclusions from his study of Damascius' attesta-tions in the Peri Archon:1. During the time of Damascius, the most current version of Orphicdoctrine was the Sacred Discourse, containing a theogony and acosmogony, both of which formed the basis of Orphic ethicalpraxis as well as Orphic initiation rites.2. In order to interpret the Sacred Discourse, Damascius must havemade use of a lost work of Syrianus entitled The Agreement BetweenOrpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, and the Chaldean Oracles.3. In order to justify his own name for the first principle, \"theIneffable,\" Damascius cites a version of the theogony attributedto a mysterious personage named either Hieronymus or Hellani-kus. This version gives a prominent place to the deity Chronus,and the presence of this deity shows the influence both of Stoiccosmogony and of Mithraicism.4. The quotation that Damascius makes from the version of Eude-mus gives us information about the Orphic poems circulatingduring the classical period, which can be used together with Aris-tophanes* Birds, Plato's Symposium and the Derveni papyrus tocomprehend which episodes belonged in the earliest version ofthe Orphic drama.Let us glance quickly at the question of how extensively Orphiclore was known and transmitted within the classical period.7 We havealmost certainly advanced, with the discovery of what seems to havebeen an Orphic cult at Olbia dating from the fifth century B.C.E.,beyond the pessimism of Linforth's denial that there was indeed anOrphic modus vivendi in the classical period. But the reconstructionof stemmata for the Orphic theogonies is complicated by the verylate date of its major testimonia. The efforts of the last of the Pla-tonic successors to present a rival cosmogony to the Christian ver-sion, complete with a doctrine of original sin and eventual redemp-tion, reversed pagan reticence on this subject but has left later7 West; Linforth.148"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Transmigrations of a Myth: Orphic Texts and Platonic Contextscenturies in somewhat of a quandary concerning its provenance andantiquity.8With the discovery of the Derveni papyrus, containing as it does acommentary on some version of the Orphic poem, and dating fromthe fourth century, we have corroborating evidence that the classicalperiod was immersed in Orphic lore.9 The Derveni version corre-sponds in certain details to the Eudemian version, but according tothe reconstruction of Claude Calame, in place of the cosmic egg, wehave a kinky hybrid entity, part Hesiodic primophallacism, part Or-phic oviparous cosmology. In this version, the aidoion, the originarygenitals perform the part of Phanes/Eros, for from them are said toproceed all of the immortal gods, as well as the elements. In anyevent, Plato was almost certainly familiar with a version known to theauthor of the Derveni papyrus, since he quotes, in Laws 716a, linesthat correspond to line 26 of the Derveni papyrus (o.f. 21a): \"thegod holding the beginning, middle, and end of all beings.\"The Orphic Cosmology in Plato's SymposiumWe are all familiar with the Aristophanic parody at Symposium, 189ff. Originally, the human race consisted of three sexes, male (de-scended from the sun), female (descended from the earth), and theandrogune (descended from the moon). These originary beings con-spired to inveigh against heaven with their might, and Zeus, inpunishment, divided them like eggs. After Apollo healed the scars ofthese half-people, they were condemned to a lonely search for theirother half. The myth is an etiology for the human passion, eros,recounted by the comic poet Aristophanes. In Plato's version, theancestors of the human race must represent all the players of theoriginal Orphic cycle: the egg itself (note the comparison to eggs at190c), the god Phanes (at least, the androgune resembles the bisexualPhanes), the Titans (they scale heaven and are punished for it),Dionysus (like Dionysus in the theology, they are dismembered andthen healed by Apollo), and finally, the living members of the hu-man race.For a detailed and compelling critique of West's admirable attempts to reconstructa stemma for the transmission of the Orphic theologies, see Casadio 1986.On the Derveni Papyrus, see Rusten and Obbink.149"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismPhaedrus refers to the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice in the middleof his speech (179^2), casting Orpheus in a rather negative light, assomeone who failed in his mission because he was unwilling to dieon behalf of his beloved. Without going too deeply into the narrativestructure of the Symposium, it is worth pointing out that Alcibiadesrefers to his painful wound as more fierce than a snakebite (2i8a5)and that under the influence of this bite he has partaken in theBacchic celebrations of mania (21804). We will return to the figureof Alcibiades shortly, but for now, it seems plausible to suggest thatin this tale Socrates functions as an Orpheus figure (note the refer-ences to Socrates' enchanting music at 215C5), who enters in to akind of underworld for the purpose of rescuing his beloved (Alcibi-ades) but notably fails in his mission. At any rate, this possible nar-rative motif only underscores the centrality of Orphic symbolism inthe Symposium as a whole.Another name for Phanes/Protogonos, the Demiurgic source ofthe universe, was Eros. Note that the name \"Aristophanes\" containsthe word ' Thanes\" and that Birds contains an etiology for Eros thatdepicts the originary cosmic egg. The roles assigned to Zeus as divinenemesis for the hubris of an original race, to Apollo as restorer ofthe human species, and to a kindlier, gentler, post-lapsarian human-ity in Plato's myth, seem closely modeled on the Protogonos narra-tive. The circle beings in Aristophanes' speech, then, are emblemsof Protogonos/Eros, and so Plato's Aristophanic parody alludes toor invokes the Orphic cosmogony. Plato was aware of an Orphiccosmogony circulating rather freely in the classical period, and healludes to it in this Aristophanic tale of the circle-beings. But whatdifference does it make to our reading of the Symposium? One answerwould be, 'Very little.\" Plato borrows some themes from the Orphicmyth in an effort to polish his Aristophanic parody. In it, we aresupposed to recognize Aristophanes' own riposte to the Sophisticmythographers and their Utopian theorizing, and Plato's take on thismaterial would be an instance of the intellectuals getting a bit oftheir own back. That is one answer, but left unanswered are thequestions, what function does the initiatory motif have in the Sympo-sium as a whole, and what role specifically does the allusion to Or-phic cosmogony play?Obviously, the whole ladder of love is metaphorized in terms ofmystery language. Diotima speaks of lesser and greater mysteries,150"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Transmigrations of a Myth: Orphic Texts and Platonic Contextsand the vision of the beautiful is presented as epopteia. In fact, Platovery often uses the language of mysteries as a purely metaphoricaldevice, especially when concerned with the theme of eros. A goodexample is Republic 8, the genealogy of the democratic man. Thisperson is said to be the son of an aristocratic father fallen on hardtimes. The son, confused and shamed by the daily abuse to whichhis father is subjected, falls in with a group of accomplices whoawaken the stirrings of Eros, slumbering within his soul: \"And theypossess and initiate his soul with magnificent and costly rites, thenproceed to lead home from exile insolence and anarchy and prodi-gality and shamelessness, resplendent in a great attendant choir, andcrowned with garlands . ..\" Here Plato speaks about the decadenceof the mystery rites, in keeping with what we find elsewhere inphilosophical writers, including the author of the Derveni papyrus,who complains that the initiated depart from mysteries still unen-lightened.If we look carefully at the metaphor from the Republic, we can seethat Plato is talking about the evolution of the erotic subject. Thatis, he is talking about the shaping of desire and how Eros is config-ured both within the internal psychic economy of the subject andwithin the larger external economy of the community in which thesubject lives. The language of initiation is associated in Greek litera-ture with the erotic tradition; this initiatory Eros, functioning on asocial level, is the subject of Pausanias' speech in the Symposium. Itharkens back to the lyrical tradition, to Theognis and to Sappho, butit is also reflected in the vase paintings designed for Sympotic occa-sions. A cosmogonic Eros, of which there are two central traditionsin Greek poetry, the Hesiodic and the Orphic, is the subject ofErixymachus' speech but is also alluded to in the Hesiodic lines ofPhaedrus.10In one tradition, a Demiurgic Eros is the mediating principlebetween chaos and an organized, differentiated world of multiplicity;in the other tradition, Eros is an initiatory guide into the social worldof the polis and its institutions. Demiurgic Eros produces the exte-rior, spatial world; Sympotic Eros produces the interior, psychicworld, carried out within the temporal demarcations of a life span.10 On initiatory Eros, see Claude Calame, \"Eros initiatique et la cosmogonie Or-phique,\" to which I am extremely indebted in this section."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismBoth forms converge in the speech of Aristophanes: cosmogony andpsychology collapse in the synchronic presentation of the myth.Demiurgic Eros is present as cosmic Phanes, the bisexual being whospawns the universe at the dawn of time. The myth also narrates theemergence of the socially constructed erotic subject who is born intoa fixed set of sexual mores.The cosmological and social functions of Eros are intricately inter-woven throughout the text, as Hesiodic Eros is juxtaposed with theOrphic tradition in the opening speech of Phaedrus. The Orphicmyth promises a return to the undifferentiated state before sexualidentity arises, promising to deliver us back inside the egg to be-come, in the Lacanian sense, hommelettes. But of course, this is adelusional aspiration, as the myth makes clear, and it is in fact a self-destructive delusion. This myth, just as the androgune is divided intotwo, suffers severance from within. The myth of the circle-beings isjust the outer covering for a later, Socratic revelation.Enter Diotima, who in her dissection of self-identity at 208 accom-plishes her first task as mystagogue, namely, to destroy the initiand'sold self. No ideology could survive Diotima's scrutiny: mind andbody arise together as mutually conditioned constructions. Self-identity ebbs away in the flow of memory while consciousness disap-pears without a trace of its previous contents. Disclosing this radicaldissociation from a stable selfhood is what Diotima aims at in herdialectical antidote to the delusions generated in conventional dis-course. Here is yet another reason for the Orphic myth. The Orphicmystery purports to be an esoteric tradition, one that liberates peo-ple from the petrifying conventions of the mass sex-gender machine.Its purpose is to re-create the subject, to wrench him away from thepublic fiction in which he has hitherto been schooled.Alcibiades is the initiatory candidate in our dialogue, and hecomplains bitterly of the voice of the demos that, sirenlike, calls himaway from the vocation of philosophy. Conspicuously wearing aninitiand's crown, he recounts his spiritual death at the hands ofSocrates, using language borrowed from the mysteries (mania, bak-xeias, 21804). By quoting the Orphic proem just before he describesthe cloaking scene, Alcibiades intimates that an initiation took place.Here for the first and evidendy last time, he experienced a loss ofself.

One passage that illustrates this convention is Clouds256, the initiation of Strepsiades into the worship of the Nephelai:So: Now sit on the sacred couchST: I'm sitting.So: Now take this garland hereST: What's the garland for? Oh no, Socrates. Please don't turn meinto an Athamas.So: Don't worry; but we go through all of this for the initiates.The symbolic role of the Stephanos is complicated by its diverse usageoutside of the mainstream celebratory occasions of victory festivals,which is of course the obvious explanation for Alcibiades' crown inthe Symposium.On the gold leaves of Thurii, we read the distich:6'e^JtTav Papimev66og apya^oto6'8jr&Pav oiecpdyov Jtoai KapKaki\\ioioiThey have flown the grievous circle of heavy sorrowand stepped on the much sought crown, with swift feet.As Richard Seaford explains, \"it seems that the Stephanos, worn byinitiand and corpse, expresses here that release of the dead initiatewhich had been celebrated with these deliberately enigmatic formu-lae in his initiation into the mysteries. Whatever the primary refer-ence of circle, I detect a riddling contrast between two kinds ofcircle, the undesirable imprisoning circle, and the desirable circle ofthe crown.\"11The myth of the circle people tells us about this cycle of self-perpetuation and of self-perpetuating misery, although the ancestorsof humanity must eventually submit to a ritual dismemberment, aservice that Diotima nobly replicates as the high priestess of this ritein her disassembly of selfhood. In this respect, I would emphasize11 Seaford, HSCP 90."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismthat Diotima meets certain ritualistic expectations. One of theseexpectations might be more fully comprehended if we recognize inthe Diotima figure a rather standard mystic motif, in which a spiritguide, in the form of a consort of the opposite sex, reveals to adisciple the presence of a ladder that carries him into the upperworlds.12Socrates becomes the shamanistic counterpart to Diotima. In hiseerie trance {Symposium 220C7) and superhuman enkrateia, he seemsfully in control of his elemental world. Untouched by the heat ofEros or the frozen depths of winter, his world cannot harm himsince it is his own projection, and he knows it. He cannot becomeintoxicated by it, and he is never afraid of it. If the world that weinhabit is a construction of desire, then this world lacks a finalreality. But to live in a fictional world is madness, while not torecognize its nature as a fictional construct is both dangerous andstupid. If Socrates has any wisdom, perhaps it is just this awarenessof his own fictionality, with which he holds a unique iconic relation-ship: likened to a Silenic statue, Socrates embodies the very form ofthe eikon, the idol. Stony outside, his divine power is not visible.13The myth also incorporates its own rupture, and the self-enclosureof the solipsistic self who refuses to admit the autonomy of the eroticobject is severed when the terms of inner and outer are reversed.The circle-beings are replaced with the new, enlightened version ofhumankind, the subject who recognizing a lack of self thus becomessubsumed in the erotic drive to transcend this fictionality. But howdifferent could the reconstructed self be from the old self? Not thatdifferent, as we gather from observing Alcibiades.Whatever we make of Diotima's femininity, it is no more or less real than is any ofthe other characters' masculinities. We are clearly shown the fictionalization ofmasculine erotic subjects every bit as constructed as the woman in the text: merefigments of Hesiodic mythology, or tragic poetry, or medical texts. In fact, each ofthe characters appears not in the guise of a real, raw masculinity, but as a fabricatorof discourse, a self-fabricator imbricated with the layers of social conditioning thatdispenses only pseudo-identities.On shamanism and Orphism, see Casaro, p. 312, and extensive references there.He quotes A. Hultkrantz, \"A Definition of Shamanism,\" Temenos, 1973* pp- 25—37, defining the shaman as: \"A social functionary who, with the help of guardianspirits, attains ecstacy in order to create a rapport with the supernatural world onbehalf of his group members.\" On shamanism and its association with Orphism,see Guthrie, Dodds, and West.

This is the exotericmind that desperately requires enlightenment but because of itsconditioning, all too rarely seeks it. Because the initiatory sequenceintimated within the narrative structure invokes a moment of self-awakening, or self-transcendence, and because Plato allegorizes thisinitiation as involving an insight into the transient, centrifugal aspectof the socially constructed self, it reads as a complex meditation onthe meaning of selfhood. One aspect of selfhood lies in its socialconstruction, its location within a specific cultural matrix, and itsinscription by various foundational discourses. Plato's understandingof the relationship between cosmogonic Eros and socially operativesex-gender systems evinces his sensitivity to the pragmatics of suchdiscourses. Thus each of the Symposiasts calls upon a different ele-mental, cosmic configuration as part of his or her own persuasivearsenal.This is not to say that Plato leaves us with an absolutized notionof the pluralistic self. Instead, the text itself is a puzzle, offering botha mirror for self-reflection and a mask for self-deception. It is thisaporetic textuality that is finally signified in the persona of Socrates:in the end, despite the prolific gossip about Agathon's dinner party,there remains a secret. Socrates, although he does take a ritual bathfor the occasion, denies that he initiates anyone. He ends and beginsthe whole affair in euphemia, silence.14Although this discussion of the Orphic myth alluded to in Plato'sSymposium has been brief, nevertheless the ability to detect thepresence of the theology in the dialogue helps us to accomplishseveral tasks.

As West points out, the sequence involving theTitan's devouring of the young Dionysus is the narrative equivalentof a shamanistic psychodrama, in which a candidate literally experi-ences his complete dissolution on the physical order, and becomesreconstituted and reborn on the order governed by the initiation:The story of Dionysus seems to show elements of both the types of initia-tory death that I have mentioned. The fact that he is cut in pieces by evilgods who proceed to boil him and eat his flesh corresponds to the typicalshaman's ordeal, which is a subjective religious experience, not a concreteritual. But the references to the coating of the Titans' faces with gypsum andto a collection of objects with which they deceived Dionysus strongly suggestthat the myth reflects a ritual in which the death-dealing ancestral spiritswere impersonated by men, that is to say an initiation of the tribal or secret-society type.15Not only does the camouflaged appearance of the rending ofDionysus in the Symposium confirm West's conclusions, that the Dio-nysus episode was already present in the Eudemean version of thetheology, but it also importantly confirms the conclusions of Kings-ley's research into the Orphic origination of certain of Plato's myths.I quote Kingsley:Habit dies hard and in spite of the evidence of the Derveni papyrus it isstill normal to find the allegorizing of Orphic poetry and mythology pre-sented as a primarily Neoplatonic phenomenon. Here [sc. in the Phaedo'sallusions to mythical landscape that corresponds in part to regions of Sicily],however, we have the allegorizing interpretation of Orphic literature notonly attested before Plato's time, but actually feeding into and creating thePlatonic myths themselves.16Finally and most importantly, the rending of Dionysus is themythic equivalent of Diotima's philosophical dissolution of self-identity and Plato's linguistic analysis of the origins of the empiricalself and its erotic structure.

Proclus is by far the richest source in terms of sheernumbers of fragments, even though his Orphic references are bycomparison far fewer than allusions to the Chaldean Oracles. Fromthe comment of Damascius in the Doubts and Solutions Concerning FirstPrinciples cited earlier concerning the \"current\" form of the Orphictheology, we know that the Neoplatonists generally used the HieroiLogoi in 24 Rhapsodies, which is listed in the Suda under the headingOrpheus. An anecdote from Marinus' Life of Proclus also confirmsthe origin of many of Proclus' Orphic citations:Once when I was reading the works of Orpheus with him [Proclus], andhearing his exegeses not only on what is in Iamblichus and Syrianus butfurther material, apter to theology, I asked the philosopher not to leave suchan inspired poem unexplained but to write a fuller commentary on this too.He said he had often felt an urge to write one, but had been prevented bydreams in which he had seen his tutor himself [Syrianus] deterring him withthreats. I thought of a way round, and proposed that he should mark thepassages in his tutor's volumes which he approved. He acquiesced (image ofgoodness that he was), and marked the commentaries in the margins. Wecollected the passages together, and thus obtained his notes and commentson quite a number of verses of Orpheus, even if he did not manage to markup the whole of the divine mythology or all of the Rhapsodies.17These works of Syrianus were On the Theology of Orpheus and theConcordance of Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato Regarding the Oracles. It isthis latter work that both Proclus and Damascius draw upon in theirexplications of Platonic theology, Proclus, extensively thoughout hisworks but most frequently in his Commentary on Plato's Timaeus, and17 Marinus, Life of Proclus 27, translated by West 1983, p. 228.157"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismDamascius, in his Doubts and Solutions Concerning First Principles, andhis Commentary on Plato's Parmenides.Primarly, Proclus refers to the ''Rhapsodic Theogony,\" a poemcomposed toward either the end of the first or the beginning of thesecond century B.C.E. The date of this version is a matter of conten-tion, with Luc Brisson pointing to aspects of the fragments akin totechniques of Stoic allegorizing, to argue for a later date than thatproposed by West. I refer now to Proclus' summary of this \"Rhap-sodic Theogony\" found in the Commentary on the Timaeus, vol. Ill,chapter 168:\"Let us now inquire,\" Proclus says, \"which Orphic doctrines one oughtreconcile with the teaching of Timaeus concerning the Gods. Orpheustaught that there were Divine regents presiding over everything, equal innumber to the perfect number, that is, six: Phanes, Night, Ouranos, Kronos,Zeus, and Dionysus.\"These six reigns encompass a theogony, telling the birth of the godsfrom the primordial egg; a cosmology, recounting the origins of thepresent world order, brought to unity in the bowels of Zeus; and ananthropology. Before going into the details of Proclus' theologicaladaptation of this cosmogony, let us step back and ask, what is goingon here? What motivates the Neoplatonic appropriation at this par-ticular phase of the tradition? To focus this question, it would bewell to remember that Porphyry's references to the Orphics are byand large confined to his tract, \"On the Cave of the Nymphs,\" whilePlotinus himself never mentions Orpheus at all. His only allusions tothe Orphic myth are found in the discussion of Dionysus' mirror, inEnneads IV. 3.The method followed by Proclus in his Platonic Theology and else-where, is to research the correspondences between Plato, Orpheus,and Pythagoras. This method was the unique province of the Athen-ian school, founded by Plutarch of Athens. Syrianus and Hieroclesof Alexandria were both students. The research program carried onby them bears out this thesis: Hierocles authored a work on Provi-dence, whose fourth chapter was devoted to showing the correspon-dences between Plato, the Chaldean Oracles, and theurgy. Hierocles'Commentary on the Golden Verses of Pythagoras also evinces this strategy.In all of this, Hierocles and Syrianus and their successors, werefollowing in the footsteps of Iamblichus. Late Athenian Neopla-158"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Transmigrations of a Myth: Orphic Texts and Platonic Contextstonism was a peculiar mixture of scholasticism and pagan religiouscults, all blended into a syncretic system by the third-century Syrianphilosopher, Iamblichus. Pressed by the example of Christianity tobecome a tradition associated with a revealed theology, Neoplato-nists accorded a scriptural status to the writings of Plato, Homer,Orpheus, and the Chaldean Oracles, even while embracing non-Greek theologies as expressions of a larger, universal revelation.The researches of the Athenian school were designed as a returnto the original wisdom that gave birth to their tradition. Proclus inthe Platonic Theology can say: \"All of Greek theology is the child ofOrphic mystagogy: Pythagoras was the first to receive initiation fromAglaophamos, Plato in turn received from the Pythagorean and Or-phic doctrines perfect knowledge concerning the gods\" (1.5.25-26).Proclus divided the writings of Plato into four groups, accordingto their manner of expression; inspired, dialectical, symbolic, imagi-native. Likewise, the great theologians fall into four distinct types:Orpheus uses images, Pythagoras employs symbols, the Chaldeansare inspired, and Plato is scientific.18 Proclus too is interested in theinitiatory aspects of Orphism, so that he equates Orphic doctrinewith an esoteric interpretation of Plato's dialogues:Mythology comprises two branches: one is concerned with the correct edu-cation of youth, the other with the hieratic and symbolic evocation of thegods . . . The second method, which hints at the nature of the gods throughsecret formulae, belongs to those who initiate in the most profound mystery,by which Plato himself thinks it right to support his own teachings. (IR 85.1)This esoteric interpretation is made quite explicit by Proclus inCommentary on the Parmenides and in Platonic Theology. Although it is ahighly original composition and a remarkable departure from thetradition of Commentary writing that dominated the Neoplatonicschool after the death of Plotinus, in fact the Platonic Theology restsupon two central discoveries, or, as we might prefer to think of them,two assumptions by Proclus' teacher, Syrianus, who worked in theCommentary tradition. In studying Plato's Parmenides, Syrianusfound that every aspect denied of the One in the First ParmenideanHypothesis was affirmed of the One in the Second Parmenidean18 Platonic Theobgy I 4, 19-20.159"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismHypothesis and that the fourteen conclusions of the second hypoth-esis corresponded to the complete hierarchy of all gods.Proclus simply takes the Orphic myth and distributes its membersalong the axis of ontological levels Syrianus had already discoveredin the second hypothesis of Plato's Parmenides. Thus Chronus repre-sents the One, and Ether and Chaos represent the two monadicprinciples of limit and the unlimited that succeed the One in Pro-clus' ontology. Toward the end of the chain of being, we see thetypical Proclan profusion of entities, with the multiplication of dei-ties to fill in the missing gaps in the burgeoning theology. Thetheology is replete with repetitions, such as the androgynous pairingof Phanes with his feminine self repeated in the incestuous matingof Zeus with his feminine self, either his mother, Rhea, or his sister,Hera. Moreover, Zeus is identified with the feminine deity, Metis.The \"Rhapsodic Theogony\" ends with a famous hymn to Zeus, inwhich his identity as the coincidentia oppositorum is revealed:Zeus was born first, Zeus was born last into the brilliant light. Zeus is thehead, Zeus is the middle, and Zeus flows though all things. Zeus is male andZeus is an immortal virgin.This vision of the world of Zeus gives us a kind of mirror of theProclan universe, in which each being is in all, and all beings are ineach. The mirroring of the triadic structure of reality that is every-where pervasive in Proclus, constantly mediated by the opposingcategories that represent the initial dyad, is here developed in theliturgical language of a hymn. These repetitions exactly capture theProclan vision of reality: all things are in all things, each accordingto its nature. The multiple states of being, each level mutually reflect-ing all of the others, proliferate as a hall of mirrors. It is this greatworld of mutual interpenetration endlessly expanding as a singledrama, that the Orphic theogony captures. And not surprisingly, thisvision is exactly the mythic equivalent of Proclus' central meta-physical views.Particular details, such as the hierarchic distribution of elementswithin the myth, are interesting in that they coincide closely with themetaphysical structures adumbrated discursively. Thus the ProclanOne is signified by the Orphic Chronos, a move that Proclus justifieson etymological grounds: causation is identified with temporality(PT I.28).

(C-W, III, p. 161). Damascius reportsthat the theology of Hellanikus or of Hieronymus begins with twoprinciples, water and hyle, existing before Chronos. Moreover, therewas a single principle, the cause or source of both water and hyle,that goes, according to Damascius, unnamed in the theology ofHellanikus. Now Damascius interrupts this narrative to remark thatsince the more commonly cited theology, the Sacred Discourse in 24Rhapsodies, or Rhapsodic Theogony, lacks any mention of these threeelemental principles, they transmit, by their very silence, the fact thatthe originary principle is, as Damascius understands it, the Ineffable.We will return in chapter 9 to Damascius' ineffable discourse andto the theological complexities Damascius embraces as part of hiscritique of earlier Neoplatonic metaphysics. For now, I note thatDamascius not only authorizes his own metaphysical innovations byalluding to a primordial tradition, but he also verifies his under-standing of metaphysical discourse as presenting a lack of adequatesignifiers. In short, the only absolute signifier is the unsignified. Thisabyssal semiotics is his most authoritative statement. It marks the endof his history of Neoplatonic metaphysics with an almost breathtak-ing theology of absence. If that which cannot signify authorizes allforms of discourse, and if this ineffable principle finalizes Damas-cius' presentation of his own metaphysical tradition, it only demon-strates that such textual extremes could be sanctioned by a tradi-tional critique of discursive thinking.19 For the history, place, and philosophy of Damascius, see below chapter 9."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismBefore turning in more detail to the function of the Dionysusepisode, it is worth asking about the overall purpose of the Orphicelaboration of Neoplatonic metaphysics as it appears in the Com-mentary works of Proclus.20 The correspondences begin with theOrphic \"first principle,\" Chronus, and range all the way throughProclus' sublunary deities, to which correspond the Orphic duplicateand even triplicate Zeus, Ouranos, Hera, and a number of theTitans who also make an encore appearance at this level. Inter-spersed between these extremes are some surprising forms of hy-postatization, such as the Proclan \"Separative Monad,\" representedin the Orphic myth by the castration of Kronos, or the reified \"Size-of-the-Orphic-egg\" (!), which equates with one of the intelligiblegods.Here, I think most interpreters would agree, one must return tosome sort of historical context for interpretation. Granted that theversions of the Orphic theogony discovered within the annals ofNeoplatonism, in the words of Brisson,21can only be understood within the framework of a constant and very closerelation to allegoresis having as its objects the Homeric and Hesiodic poemsfor the older version of the Orphic theogony and the previous versions ofthe Orphic theogony for the more recent versions.But lest we fall into the labyrinth of a hermeneutic mise en abyme, itis important to realize that exegesis is actually fundamental to reve-lation, in the sense that prophetic texts are often bound togetherwith an argument that purports to break the secret code. Thus theauthor of the Derveni papyrus refers to certain rituals that he con-nects with a theory of reincarnation and a religion of salvationthrough Dionysus. M. L. West argues that these elements, the ritual-istic and the theogonic, belong together, perhaps as forming thebasis of an initiatory religion, concerning which the author of theDerveni papyrus then theorizes.22What I am suggesting here (and will continue to show in thechapter on Proclus' Platonic Theology) is that it is difficult to separate20 Luc Brisson, H. D. Saffrey, and Hans Lewy have shown in meticulous detail thedistribution of the Orphic narrative by reconstructing it from Proclus' PlatonicTheology, Commentary on the Parmenides, and Commentary on the Timaeus.21 Brisson 1997, \"Chronos in Column XII of the Derveni Papyrus.\"22 West 1997, \"Hocus-Pocus in East and West,\" in Laks and Most 1997.162"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Transmigrations of a Myth: Orphic Texts and Platonic Contextsexegesis from symbol.23 In particular, the initiatory goals of Orphicreligion are to some extent met through the kind of philosophicalexegesis Proclus is performing. The recent reconstruction and trans-lation of the Derveni papyrus allows us to glimpse, however tenta-tively, a possible analog text, in which the goal of initiation is mir-rored in the developments of the text itself. Column XXI of theDerveni papyrus is translated as follows:And when he says \"by jumping\" he makes clear that divided up into smallpieces they were moving in the air and were jumping, and by jumping theywere set in relation to one another. And they went on jumping until eachone came to its fellow. Heavenly Aphrodite and Zeus (and to aphrodise andto jump) and Persuasion and Harmony are established as name for the samegod. A man mingling with a woman is said by common usage to aphrodise.For when the things that are now were mixed with one another, it was calledAphrodite.This fragment allows us to see sexual union as a metaphor for thegreat cosmic harmony set in place through the reign of Zeus. Thisdivine state, here referred to as Heavenly Aphrodite, is the result ofthe mixing of all things, the gathering of separated and dispersedelements, and so represents the reign of love, or unity.24 Unity, agathering of dispersed elements, a sense of wholeness, peace, andunion, all of these words could well describe the goal of the initiatoryprocess. This sense of the whole can be seen in terms of social unity,certainly, since initiatory rites often precede one's entrance into agroup identity. But this wholeness is also of course related to theequally powerful force of union with the deity whose presence isinvoked by means of the rite.With this historical digression in mind, we turn once more toProclus' use of the Orphic theology. As already mentioned, Proclusends his discussion of Zeus' role in the developing cosmos withOrphic fragment 167, the hymn to Zeus:The shining lights of Aether and of immense sky, the depths of the oceanand of the deadly sea and the glorious earth, and the vast ocean and Tartar-tus the foundation of the earth, and the rivers, the oceans without limits, allthe rest and all the blessed immortals, gods and goddesses, and all that has23 Along these lines, see further, Obbink, \"Cosmology as Initiation.\"24 Claude Calame, \"Figures of Sexuality and Initiatory Transition in the DerveniTheogony and Its Commentary,\" in Laks and Most 1997.163"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismalready come to be and all that will come to be, all that was born and founditself together in the belly of Zeus.For Proclus, the Orphic theology, in offering a vision of the greatworld encompassed in the pleroma of the human intellect and em-bodied within the perfect person, Phanes, shows forth the soul as animago del25 It is this recognition that in itself constitutes a form ofinitiation, making possible the soul's access to the fullness of realitythat the Platonic Theology describes.I would go further and suggest that within the Neoplatonic tradi-tion, at least since the time of Syrianus,26 Orphism attaches itself tometaphysics in order to transform the latter into ritual. Or rather,the language of metaphysics is grafted on to a traditional narrativewhose goal converges with the metaphysical conception. The entireprocess of metaphysical expansion and contraction becomes a the-ophany as the reader constructs an image of unity or perfection thatrests entirely within the mind. We might think that this recitation ormnemonics is the narrative equivalent of the spherical image. Boththe sphere and the theology provide the reader with images thatinvolve an intense concentration, the ability to unify disparate ele-ments, and the sustained vision of these elements as revealed bymeans of a powerful theurgic symbol.Once more, this creative, divine energy that pours itself throughthe various stations of being as stages within the theology is initiatoryin function. It ends with an explicidy initiatory sequence that impliesthe transformation of the initiate. The world of Zeus and the strangecoincidentia oppositorum this world contains are to be seen in a visionthat takes place after initiation.The Dionysus sequence forms the crux for interpreting the entiretheology. But in the terms of the myth, the rending of Dionysusreveals both the preinitiated state of the celebrant and the collapseor loss of the god's presence. For example, Proclus quotes an Orphicfragment (25 Kern) describing the rending of Dionysus in his Com-mentary on the Parmenides:25 As he tells us in the Platonic Theology, bk. 1.26 We have evidence of his Orphic interpretations from the scholia to Hermias' Com-mentary on the Phaedrus, which seems to be more or less a transcription of Syrianus'own commentary. We also have evidence about Syrianus' Orphic exegesis fromremarks that Proclus makes in the Commentary on the Parmenides and especially inthe Platonic Theology, bk. 4.164"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Transmigrations of a Myth: Orphic Texts and Platonic ContextsThis is why the theologians say that at the dismemberment of Dionysus hisintellect was preserved undivided through the foresight of Athena and thathis soul was the first to be divided, and certainly the division into seven isproper primarily to Soul. (IP 808)According to Proclus, the divided soul of Dionysus explains why thehuman soul operates as it does, in a divided way, or discursively:It is therefore appropriate that soul should have the function of divisionand of seeing things discursively. It is no wonder, then, that whereas thedivine Forms exist primordially together and unified in the demiurgic intel-lect, our soul attacks them separately. (IP 809)What follows is one of Proclus' most explicit descriptions of theconceptual nature of discursive thinking. The reign of Dionysusrepresents the human condition and, in particular, the scattered ordistracted state of the mind before the unifying effects of the sym-bolic narrative.For most Late Neoplatonists, the dismemberment of Dionysussignifies both a stage in the history of the cosmos, when the soul isdivided or distributed into the world of space, and an anthropology,setting the stage for the soul's ultimate liberation from matter. Thelater tradition reads back into the text of Plato this same anthropol-ogy: for Olympiodorus, the prohibition of suicide in the Phaedo isrelated to the episode. Human beings arise from the soot of theTitans' ashes after they have consumed the god; the human bodybelongs to Dionysus, originating from his flesh (Olymp. In Ph. 1.3).According to Olympiodorus, this is the eosteric reason behind Soc-rates' strictures against suicide.Again, the \"reign of Dionysus\" is also a symbol for the humansoul in its embodied condition. This is the life of division, signifiedby the \"chewing\" of the Titans: \"Dionysus is the patron of thisworld, where extreme division prevails because of 'mine' and'thine.' \" (Olym. In Ph. 1.5) In these examples, and most famouslyin Enneads IV. 3, the Dionysus episode reveals the fragmentation ofhuman consciousness.27 The uninitiated, ordinary human being ischaracterized by a distracted, dispersed form of attention that isegoistic, self-centered, and desperately in need of enlightenment.27 Cf. also Proclus In Cratylum 133 (p. 77): The intellect in us is Dionysian and thustruly a shrine to Dionysus.

Not only does it presentthe works of Plato in constant dialogue with competing theologicalsystems to which the Neoplatonists accorded scriptural status, suchas the Chaldean Oracles and Rhapsodic theology, but the PlatonicTheology offers itself as a theurgic text in its own right. For Proclus,Plato's discourse on the nature of the divine constitutes a mystagogy,an initiation into theurgy.Proclus sets out the plan of his work in chapter 2 of the PlatonicTheology. There he outlines the book according to three centraldivisions: Plato's teachings concerning the nature of the gods, thestructure of the divine hierarchy, and a miscellany of Platonic gods,hypercosmic and encosmic, that appear less systematically in the writingsof Plato. Thus the Platonic Theology treats Plato's dialogues accordingto a scheme in which various aspects or attributes of deity are dis-persed triadically within the Laws, Republic, Phaedrus, and Phaedo. Thesecond part of the work describes, as Proclus promises, the centralconstituents of the divine world, although some of the plan is miss-ing from the work as we have it. Beginning with the One (bk. II),the Platonic Theology continues down the grades of reality, to theHenads, the intelligible gods, the intelligible-intellective gods, theintellective gods, and the hypercosmic gods. This level is as far asour text reaches.We have already seen that Proclus relied on Syrianus for theenumeration of this divine hierarchy, inasmuch as the latter discov-167"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismered that the second half of Plato's dialogue, the Parmenides, mappedonto the levels of existence detailed in the rather baroque schemesof the Athenian school. Consequently, in the Platonic TheologyProclus sets out to enumerate the successive orders of gods alongthe axis of the Parmenidean ontology, elaborating six levels after theOne: the intelligible, the intelligible-intellectual, the intellectual, theparticipated intellect, the psychic and individual souls, and nature.1Within the six books of the Platonic Theology, Proclus completes thisschema only as far as the level of the participated intellect, or inthe Iamblichean scheme, to the level of the supermundane gods.Formally, the work is closely aligned to the tradition of Parmenid-ean exegesis, although in Book One, Proclus works from a list ofseveral dialogues, including the Laws, Republic, Phaedrus, Phaedo, andCratylus, as the basis for his enumeration of the principal divineattributes.Proclus actually employs two distinct principles of theological ex-egesis in his approach to the Platonic dialogues. The first rule willbe discussed further in connection with Damascius: the Neoplato-nists believed that the Parmenides both charted the emergence ofevery possible state of being after the One and indicated the tran-scendence of the first hypostasis over the posterior realities. Accord-ing to the Neoplatonists, the first One never shows up in the PlatonicParmenides, which instead starts at the second hypostasis, when Zenobegins with the protasis, \"If the One is ...\" In the Platonic Theology,Proclus also shows that the remaining Platonic dialogues affirm theontological structure adumbrated in the Parmenides so that they toomust be read in terms of their location on the Parmenidean axis.Thus Proclus will try to locate the mythological narrative of thePhaedrus, for example, within the Athenian system of the intellectual-intelligible gods. Employing the second exegetical rule,2 Proclusreads the dialogues of Plato as though they were mapped onto theParmenidean structure. But Proclus in turn elucidates this Parmeni-dean structure by referring to non-Platonic traditions.Hence we come to the second basis of Proclus' exegetical activity1 This basic scheme is altered to take in account certain of Iamblichus' theologicalinnovations, as, for example, the Iamblichean distinction between encosmic andsupermundane gods.2 For this second exegetical principle, see PT\\ and Saffrey 1965, vol.

For Proclus, the authenticity ofPlato's philosophy is vouchsafed by his place in an ancient lineagein which wisdom was transmitted orally from master to disciple in anunbroken succession. As quoted in the previous chapter, Proclus, inthe Platonic Theology, affirms:All of Greek theology is the child of Orphic mystagogy: Pythagoras was thefirst to receive initiation from Aglaophamos, Plato in turn received from thePythagorean and Orphic doctrines perfect knowledge concerning the gods.(I.5.25-26)O'Meara has recently shown that Iamblichus' elevation of Pythag-orean philosophy was part of a concerted effort to uncover theauthentic inspiration behind Plato's works. In his life of Pythagoras,Iamblichus shows that Pythagoras himself was initiated by none otherthan Orpheus. According to Iamblichus, there is a direct line oftransmission from Orpheus to Pythagoras to Plato. The theory be-hind Proclus' synthesis of various philosophical dialects into a singletheological language is the unity of primordial tradition.By reading Plato in Pythagorean terms and Pythagoras in Platonicterms, by insisting upon the equivalence of muthos and logos, bysubstituting mythic names for metaphysical terms, and by authoriz-ing his interpretations through reference to the Chaldean Oracles,Proclus creates a totalizing speech that sweeps up the entire historyof philosophy. Paradoxically, to have motivated the Platonic Theologyalong such quasi-historical lines is to have de-historicized the text ofPlato. Thus in Proclus' view, Plato is yet another exponent of thephilosophia perennis. Therefore, although Plato does teach in a uniquemanner because he alone uses scientific discourse, he is not teachinga unique philosophy. If Proclus belongs to an exegetical tradition,this tradition exists only because of the primordial wisdom that itseeks to expound. For this reason, the Platonic Theology is more thanan exegetical text; Proclus tells us that it is an initiatory text. Conse-quently, its reader is not debarred from belonging to this sameperennial tradition. But the fact that initiation can take place bymeans of a text suggests that the concept of the text itself has ahighly unusual significance in the Platonic Theology.169"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismRitual Aspects of the TextProclus' programmatic statement on the nature of theological lan-guage is found at Platonic Theology, I 4, p. 20, 1-25:Those who attempt to reveal the divine speak [in different ways] sometimes[speaking] in a symbolic or mythic mode, making use of images, and amongthose who expose their own thoughts without veils, some compose theirdiscourses in a scientific manner and others under the inspiration of thegods.At the very outset of the work, Proclus is quite open about thedifficulties of his project. He even exhibits some self-consciousnessabout the methodology he intends to employ:We will now distinguish the manner according to which Plato teaches themystic doctines concerning the gods. He very obviously does not pursue thesame method everywhere, but sometimes, he teaches in an enthusiasticmode, sometimes, he employs dialectic, and sometimes he employs the sym-bolic method to communicate their secret attributes, and finally sometimesdeparting from the icons he ascends to the level [of the gods].Here we observe Proclus' caveat: he is not going to pursue aconsistent line of interpretation. Having introduced his text as be-longing to a non-traditional genre, that of scientific discourse, heinfuses a ritualism into the text and assimilates Platonism to a morepervasive Late Antique religiosity. That is, the Platonic Theology willcome to resemble the kinds of texts it seeks to explain. For thisreason, Platonic Theology also shares in the typology of many rituallyinspired or informed texts, such as heavenly ascent narratives, divineinvocations, theurgic rites, and letter mysticism.3 I hope to show, inthe remainder of this chapter, that the Platonic Theology is meant tobe a support, not for argument, but for vision. The text can be seenas iconic, and the system that it supposedly conveys is more like aritual invocation or theurgic rite than a handbook of metaphysics.In the terms of Iamblichus or the Hermetica, one could say that thePlatonic Theology conveys an \"intellectual theurgy\"4 or \"speech offer-3 For a recent survey of these texts, see Janowtiz 1996.

As we shall see, it presents itself as an initiatory text, oreven as a textual symbolon, a ritual token of the divine reality itpurports to describe.Perhaps the most striking feature of Late Antique religious textsin general is the almost magical power or divinely guaranteed effi-cacy of certain kinds of language. In the Jewish, Christian, and Chal-dean traditions, for example, the invocation of a divine name orrecitation of a formula can have very important consequences in theworld beyond the text.7 Because of this efficacy, and because of theformulaic qualities of many religious texts, it has seemed increasinglyimportant to some scholars to emphasize the mutual affiliations oftext and ritual.8 Given that ritual is always a performance,9 and thata performance assumes both a context and an audience, the ritualelements of religious and philosophical discourses require an exe-getical pragmatics.10 To the extent that a text instantiates a perfor-mance, its pragmatic markers must delimit the interpretive universein which the text belongs.The question before us is, how are we to read the Platonic Theol-ogy ? Do the text or the traditions to which it belongs provide such apragmatics of interpretation? The history of the exegetical traditionhelps to provide an answer. Iamblichus revolutionized Neoplatonicmethods of exegesis through his assimilation of Plato to the Orphic/Chaldean traditions, as we have seen. Not only did he create a newform of exegetical practice by means of a pervasive intertexuality, healso changed the concept of text itself. Obviously, the idea of a textmade sacred through its association with divinely revealed wisdom is5 Cf. Corpus Hermeticum 11 for a nearly contemporaneous text that employs the notionof speech offering, a ritual use of language that has a highly signficant initiaticfunction.6 On the idea that this text substitutes a Platonic universe for the more usual publiclyavailable word, see the introductory remarks of Saffrey 1965, vol.

Far from relying on the dialectical methods of hispredecessors, Damascius insisted upon an abrupt departure fromphilosophical discourse, as we saw.

This visionary space does not contain external objects norillusions nor hallucinations. Rather, it is above all a realm of self-illumination, as Proclus says:Every god is without figure, even though it is viewed with a figure.

As Proclus goes on to say, \"all things are in us in a psychicmode and that is why we are capable of knowing all beings, byawakening the powers that we have, which is to say, the icons of theuniversal reality (IP 1076).15Since we reflect reality in ourselves, it is necessary to retrieve orto distract the outwardly directed attention of the mind away fromits habitual gaze. By using images of the inner world, Proclus hopesto draw the attention of the soul back in to its original seat. Thisimage of what the world looks like or can look like from the insideout, is exactly the function of the symbolon. By constructing such animage in the text of the Platonic Theology, Proclus hopes to bringabout a response within the soul - a change of mind. He adumbratesthis strategy in PT\\ 3.21:For Socrates correctly says in the First Alcibiades that the soul will see allthings and even god by entering into itself. For by inclining itself toward itsown unity, which is to say to enter into all likeness and by getting rid ofmultiplicity and the variety of its multifarious faculties, the soul will attain tothe watch tower of all beings.In this linguistic theurgy, the text can be considered an icon of areality that is gradually brought into view. This iconic function ofthe text must now be considered. Two considerations will occupy ushere: on the one hand, the textual tradition within which Proclusworks had been fixed, so that exegesis is the primary vehicle ofphilosophical doctrine. On the other hand, this very canonization of15 On the monadology of the soul, see Trouillard 1982, chapter 7, and Trouillard1972b. As Trouillard has shown, the concept of the soul as the pleroma of the ideasis a constant theme in the Proclan corpus.

Thus the persistence detected by Proclus inthe use of signs and symbols within his tradition was itself a mark oftheir sanctity. The fixity of his texts meant that Proclus had at handa system of signs that could be read as a complete language, a sacreddiscourse that revealed itself beyond the text, in the fabric of uni-verse and in the history of its discursive representation.Language and RitualBefore discussing in more detail the ritual aspects of the PlatonicTheology, it is important to consider whether or not Proclus thinksthat language can have ritual associations and whether or not hethinks that correct interpretation depends on correctly identifyingritual aspects of the language. In his Commentary on the Republic Pro-clus establishes a theory of poetic expression by analogy to the prac-tice of theurgy. It is because poetry is analogous to the hieratic artthat poetry is at once uplifting and misleading. Since reality itselfcontains multiple states or levels of being, the divine series necessar-ily includes both the highest and lowest members. Likewise, sincepoetry mirrors this process, there must be both high and low poetry.That poetry reflects all the multiple states of being is what gives it itsspecial veracity: 'The authors of myths have a regard to the proces-sion of the gods and are anxious to lead the myths upwards for eachsensible particular into the entire series\" (I 78.25).16Myths, Proclus tells us, clothe themselves in superficial attire, cov-ering up their secret truths. The final explanation for the fact that\"the poets attempt to conceal their vision by means of false sur-faces\"17 lies in a more technical understanding of the nature ofsymbolism. Poetry works after the manner of the hieratic art: eachorder (taxis) of being contains members who are farther up or lowerdown on the ontological totem pole.18 A word expressed at the literallevel can have associations with the higher members of the series.16 Lamberton 1985 discusses this passage.

I 78, 1-10)Finally, poetry is like a mystery religion; poetry and initiationfunction in precisely the same way. Proclus advances the same paral-lels in his theological writing:In the most sacred rites of initiation they say that the initiates at first meetwith various classes of god but entering further without turning back, andguarded by the rites they are engulfed by the divine illumination and,stripped of everything, as the Oracles say, they share the divine nature. Inthe same way also in the practice of the contemplation of the [whole] themind, looking beyond itself sees only the shadow of reality, but turninginwards it sees itself and begins to unravel its own wisdom. And at first it isas if it only sees itself but deeper knowledge reveals the intellect within thesoul and the orders of reality, and with intellect the soul can contemplatethe class of gods and even the henads of reality. For all things are in us ina psychic manner, and because of this we are naturally capable of knowingall things by awakening our divine energy and the icons of the whole.(I.3.16.1)Particularly noteworthy is line 8: T6V atibv oijiai Tp6jtov KCXL ev TT[Gecopia, where Proclus draws an explicit comparison between theurgicinitiation and contemplation. This passage invites the participation ofthe reader as the icon by means of which the initiation is to take place.19More precisely, as we will see, the soul itself is the sunthema- the ritual to-ken involved in the rite. Proclus often depicts the soul as such a ritual em-blem, at times comparing the soul to statues or to icons:The soul is composed of the intellectual words and from the divine symbola,some of which are from the intellectual ideas, while others are from thedivine henads. And we are in fact icons of the intellectual realities, and weare statues of the unknowable sunthemata. {Phil. Chal 5, 8-n,Jahn)19 Cf. Plotinus, \"Make oneself the vision\" (VI.7.15.30).176"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in Proclus' Platonic TheologyWe know from his other writings on the concept of divine sunthe-mata, and especially on the \"flower of the soul\"20 or \"One in us,\"21that in our passage Proclus alludes to the individual soul's eventualunion or identification with the One.22 This notion of the soul as thetoken of the One was also important in Iamblichus' De MysteriisP AsGregory Shaw explains, \"Iamblichus used the terms sunthema [or]sumbolon to describe the theurgic 'token' that divinized the soul.\"24For Iamblichus, this concept of sunthema was related to the partic-ipation of souls in the divine theophany. As Shaw states, in theChaldean system the sunthemata or symbola are \"sown . . . throughoutthe Cosmos\" by the Demiurge.25 As the divine powers informing thecosmos, the symbola have both cosmogonic and anagogic functions.The process of descent and return by means of symbola was part of aprovidential trajectory that souls traverse. The Iamblichean theurgicvision is based upon the reciprocal relationship that exists betweenthe human soul and the divine order. Not only does the human soul,through its realization of unity with the divine, thereby sacralize itsown world and thus \"save\" the world of matter, but the process ofself-realization alters the very meaning and direction of what is oth-erwise described as a divine descent: \"For this reason the gods havesent the souls down to this realm, in order to call them back.Therefore there is no change arising from such an ascent nor are20 Cf. Sheppard 1982, who discusses this term in some detail. For the term, dv0og voO,see also PT6, 35; In Crat. 47.15; In Ale. 519, 136-8.21 For the \"One of the Soul\" in Iamblichus, see Shaw 1995, chapter 11.22 dveyeLepouaa be TO appTyrov otvQe^a TTJC; TCW Gecbv evicting tjrooTdaeoog {In. Rem. I 177).23 On this text, see Shaw 1995. For those unfamiliar with the De Mysteriis, a brief wordof introduction. The text purports to be a response by the Egpyptian priest, Anebo,to a sustained attack on theurgic rituals promulgated by Porphyry. Prophyry's criti-cisms appear in the beginning of the work, and the exposition of theurgy in thesecond half of the text is organized around Porphyry's questions. Iamblichus, theauthor of this work, is considered to be the \"forerunner of Julian\" (Witt 1975) andauthored a lost Commentary on the Chaldean Oracles that ran to 28 books (Witt1975, p. 46). Like the rituals adumbrated in the surviving fragments of the Chal-dean Oracles, the theme of the De Mysteriis is \"the solar descent and ascent of thesoul\" (Witt p. 46). Iamblichus taught that Plato's teachings were \"integrally relatedto the sacred traditions of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Assyrians\" (Shaw 1995, p. 6).The De Mysteriis is the text in which ritual is pitted against speculation, \"theurgia\"instead of \"theologia\" in Iamblichus' effort to defend the sanctity of the world andthe efficacy of pagan soteriology (Shaw 1995, Introduction).24 Shaw 1995.25 Shaw quoting Chaldean Oracle 108 on p. 138.177"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismdescents and ascents of souls opposed to each other\" (DM VIII.8;272, 8-12).26In the TTProclus alludes to the ''ineffable symbols of the godswhich the father of souls has sown in them\" (24). For Proclus, thesesymbola are related to the chains or orders of being, which occasion\"the bringing about of fitness for participation in the gods, thosethings that have come to be in the divided realm, by means ofsymbola\" (III 155.18). In this sense, the divine sunthemata are re-lated directly to the perfection of the cosmos, just as in Iamblichus,the symbola complete the cosmos by allowing souls to return to thedivine.27Thus the worshipper in a sense reproduces the cosmos, therebyre-creating the world in a consecrated manner. He now invokes andsummons a spiritualized world. An important aspect of this theurgicrite is its attention to completion. By incorporating sunthemata fromevery divine taxis, the theurgist unifies all the powers of the gods,creating a whole cosmos. It is this creation of the whole that finallybrings about the divine sympathy, or philia, that enables the soul toascend.In the theurgic rites involving statues and material symbola, thisuniverse of power was a material construction, but this re-createdworld could also be modeled in language. Support for this idea canbe seen in both Iamblichus and Porphyry, who differentiate betweendifferent levels of sacrifice or ritual. Iamblichus mentions a kind ofoffering that is wholly immaterial (V.15). Offerings can be made tohigher or lower gods; the higher gods can be worshipped only by\"intellectual\" gifts. For this kind of worship, wisdom is the truesacrifice or offering: ooqpia &oopeiTai.28 Again, in the De abst. II, 34,Porphyry distinguishes different levels of sacrifice. At the highestorder, Porphyry says, \"the sacred sacrifice,\" consisting of wisdom, ismade.2926 Quoted by Pearson 1992, p. 264, and Shaw 1995.27 As Smith says, the sunthemata \"are present in the world to remind us of the gods\"(IT. I, 213, 17: rcpog av(5t^vT]oiv).28 On different levels of materialism in offerings and on the concept of the immaterialoffering, see Smith 1974. See also Shaw, chapter 14, p. 151, on the fitness ofsacrifices, which had to be \"connatural\" (sungenia) both with the soul who offeredit and with the god who received it.29 Cited by Smith 1974.178"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in Produs' Platonic TheologyProclus compares words to sacred statues: \"[nous] contains im-ages and substantive words that emanate, which are like statues ofthe forms, as if the names imitated the intellectual forms\" (In Crat.6, 13). On page 19 of the In Crat, Proclus compares the theurgicinvestment of statues to the act of naming, and in the PT I 29,p. 125, he again compares the use of divine names to the theurgists'statues: \"[episteme] produces each name as if it were a statue of thegods/'30If language can be compared to the theurgists' statues, then a textcan be understood as a symbolon. By pressing this analogy, it becomespossible to conceive of the Platonic Theology as a kind of textualsymbolon. The Platonic Theology presents itself as a catalogue of divineattributes as well as a full disclosure of the various names used forthe gods. Proclus claims to be offering a complete enumeration ofthe names and orders of deity, for him evinced above all in thedialogues of Plato. At the same time, this enumerative concern iscomplemented by the cosmogonic nature of this text.As if it were a theurgic rite, combining all the divine series inorder to re-create a sacralized cosmos, the Platonic Theology divulgesa kind of cosmic prehistory in which the psychic landscape, thegeography of ascent and descent, is traversed in detail. The notionof a textual symbolon is both familiar in Late Antique religiosity andfundamental for an appreciation of ritualistic language. Cosmic as-cent takes place through the disclosure of divine names. In thesecond chapter of book 1, Proclus employs another comparison tothe mysteries and so indicates that this text carries with it certainpragmatic expectations that must be met by the reader.It is requisite that the shape of the discourse as well as the preparations ofthe audience be adequate, just as in initiations, the specialists prepare theappropriate vessels, and they don't always employ lifeless media for the samegods, nor non-human creatures, nor human beings for the invocation of thedeities, but employ a corresponding medium in each case for the particularrite. (I.2.3.1-5)What becomes clear is that the text itself has the status of a ritualinvocation. This sacred invocation is a very important feature of theProclan concept of theurgy. Proclus often compares theurgic ascent30 Saffrey 1979 discusses these texts in connection with Pseudo-Dionysius' appropria-tion of this image."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismto the process of divine invocation, as in this fragment from theChaldean Philosophy: \"the soul offers the secret sunthemata to theFather which the Father has placed inside the soul in the primaryprocession of reality. For these are the intellectual and invisiblehymns of the soul on its way up\" {Phil. Chal. 1 16-19, Jahn).Divine NamesWhen Proclus turns to a discussion of divine names, as distinct fromthe human language of poetry or myth, he reveals the deeper rootsof language:31 \"There are names appropriate for each level of reality,divine names for the divine, discursive names for the discursive real-ity, and opinionated names for the level that requires the use ofopinion\" (7TI, p. 273, 25-27). For Proclus, as we shall see, languageis analogous to world making; the Demiurge is the first speakerwhose words imply the process of cosmic manifestation. In his Com-mentary on the Timaeus, Proclus elaborates on this theurgic view oflanguage. Proclus first explains that at the level of intellect, creationand the act of naming are one and the same:The positing of a name is in fact creation since intellect there is not cut offfrom creation, but rather the gods create by means of intellection. Thus it isthat they bring about things by means of their activity of naming. (IT I)At this point in the text, Proclus breaks into a digression on thetheurgic power of language.32If I must give my own opinion, it is possible to observe in this discussion thesecret doctrines of Plato concerning contemplation, namely that he did notonly posit the Demiurge as the first name giver, insofar as the Demiurgenamed the two parts of the soul [sc. the circle of the same and the circle ofthe other] but that the Demiurge even before these names revealed theessential character (magical sign) of the soul by showing the two separatesides and the Chi that results and the two circles that result from the Chi (ITII 255)Somewhat obscured in this passage is how the chiastic systemdescribed by the letter chi fits into Proclus' general views on the31 On this passage, see Trouillard 1972.32 For this whole discussion, see Festugiere vol. Ill, p. 29, and the references there.See also Troulliard.180"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in Proclus'Platonic Theologyspeech of the Demiurge in Plato's TimaeusP The Demiurge is ofcourse responsible for cosmic manifestation; in terms of Proclus'divine hierarchy, the Demiurge represents the lower limit of theintellectual gods. The two circles described in the soul are related tothe two essential moments of this manifestation, that is, processionand return, as we can deduce by comparing this passage with theCommentary on the Cratylus:The name has two powers, one that teaches and communicates thoughts,the other that discerns the reality, since the Demiurge also has two sorts ofpowers, one that produces identity and another that produces alterity. (InCrat 51.20.18-21)34The soul, as the channel of cosmic manifestation, reads the worldunder one of two signs: the world is \"other\" than or outside thesoul when it is engaged in the process of descent, whereas it is \"thesame\" as and within the ascending or returning soul. Both of thesegreat names are thus pronounced and understood by the soul, whilein the moment of its pronouncement, the world itself is expressed.In fact, the world as a whole is just such a system of signs, due againto the activity of the Demiurge:The name \"cosmos\" is appropriate as applied to a creation of the Demiurge.And if it is possible to call the world by both [names], [it is] \"Ouranos\" aslooking up and seeing the intelligible and as participating in the intelligiblebeing, and \"cosmos\" ... as that which proceeds . . . Heaven and Earth aretherefore signifiers, the one signifies the procession from there and otherthe return. (7TI 273)Thus the tradition of divine names reveals that the world as a wholeis a system of signs and can be read according to a series of interpre-tive choices.The first names that Proclus mentions in his Platonic Theology are\"The One\" and \"The Good.\" The divine names are not just namesthat human beings have for the One; they are also the elements ofdivine speech, because by means of these names, the One commu-nicates with all things. At the same time, these divine names alsorepresent the way that human beings are capable of approaching33 For an overview of Proclus' views about the Demiurge in Plato's Timaeus, seeFestugiere vol. IV, appendix two.34 On this passage, see Trouillard p. 243.181"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismthe One; they are modes of revelation that at once manifest and veilthe One.Therefore, as we have said, the manner of indicating the One is twofold:for the names that Plato hands down to us for this secret principle are alsotwo. In the Republic he calls [the One] \"The Good,\" and he uses the termto indicate the source of the truth that unifies the knower and the known.But in the Parmenides he uses the term, \"One,\" designating this principle bymeans of this term and reveals it as the cause of existence for the Henads.(II.6.40.1-5)Once more, then, of these names, the one is the name for the processionof the universe, and the other is the symbol of [its] reversion. On thisaccount it brings all things into existence and all things proceed from thisfirst principle. (II.6.40.5-10)But do not for this reason assume that the Ineffable is capable of receiving aname nor that the cause of all unity is dual. In this case as well, such namesas we apply refer to what is after the [One], either to the procession thatcomes from it or to the reversion that returns to it. (II.6.41.1-5)For Proclus these names of the One are actually modes of discourse:the name \"One\" is the root idea for the mode of negation, and thename \"Good\" is the root idea for the mode of affirmation. Procluslikens these names to \"divine images\" that are technically theurgicbecause they are designed to capture the first principle by means ofits effects.Consequently, it is not always easy to \"read\" the cosmos, since itslegibility depends, paradoxically, on a deferment of meaning:But just as certain symbols connected with statues and made by initiates areobvious, certain other symbols have an esoteric meaning and refer to thedivine presence, and these are known only to the initiates, in the same waythe world itself is an image of the intelligible and it has been fashioned byits father containing certain obvious signs of its divinity, while others aresecret symbols.Here we are warned that misunderstanding is likely, since the worldnot only is a symbol of the two great names of divinity but also hideswithin its disclosure another name that is not likewise revealed. Ifprocession and return are the great names of the divinity, theneverything finally is a sign of the ultimate sign, and this leaves thewhole series unexplained in an endless deferment of meaning.This cosmic language is a totalizing system that encompasses182"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in Proclus'Platonic Theologyeverything in reality, proceeding from the Ineffable and pervadinginto the very fabric of the world, including all within the domain ofsigns. But cosmic manifestation is just one root of the divine, just asprocession is only one term within the fundamental Proclan triad.In fact, because Proclus talks about the divine names in terms ofremaining, procession, and return, he is concerned to demonstratethat reality as it exists in itself also has a name, even if this name isunknowable.Therefore a divine name must exist for the power of remaining . . . just asthere exists a name for the power of procession. Yet this name is ineffableand unutterable and is made known to the gods alone. For there are namesappropriate to each level of reality: divine names for the gods, discursivenames for the discursive intellect, and names rooted in appearances for thesensible faculty. (PTII.6.92)For Proclus, any name applied to the One is already a limitationand presents the One according to a certain power or aspect. Be-cause activities manifest their causes, they at once delimit the natureof their causes and, at the same time, distort or compromise them.Therefore the names \"the One\" and \"the Good\" veil the first godunder two different aspects, that of unity and that of creation. AsTrouillard says, there is a fundamental contrast in Proclus' thinkingabout language: on the one hand, language in the strict sense has itsappearance only among rational and discursive souls, and on theother hand, language is rooted in the unifying and generative powerof divinity.35If the cosmos is a sign for God, however, and signifies God insofaras God communicates, then we are presented with a system thatallows no translation and no referentiality. Ultimately, the circle ofthe Same and the circle of the Other can enclose the soul within adiscourse whose terms must remain unexplained. Either excludedfrom this totalizing system, (in the circle of the other) we find itimpenetrable and meaningless, or comprehended by it, (in the cir-cle of the same) we at once find it meaningful. And yet this meaningcannot be disclosed to another since it only becomes apparent tothe soul once it sees behind the veil of cosmic manifestation andreturn. This enigmatic circularity is just the great name of the divine.35 Trouillard, p. 239.183"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismIt cannot be grasped by human reason or made to signify within aconventional system of discourse. As Proclus says, \"To summarize,then, the foremost and most authoritative names one must supposeare seated in the divine itself\" (PTl 29).Symbol and ImaginationSo far we have seen that the Platonic Theology does not employ lan-guage in any ordinary sense. That the divine names are the subjectmatter of this work has implications for the ritual status of the text;moreover, the theoretical considerations concerning the reality oflanguage also have implications for its interpretation. It is time nowto take stock of these implications.What does it mean for an interpretation to say that language isrooted in the nature of the One and that all language is a ramifica-tion of the two great names for the One, that is, the One and theGood? An astonishingly radical view of language is at work in thistheory. Proclus here reveals nothing short of a pathway to God,based upon the way of invocation. If the deepest roots of languagecan be traced back to the One (again, to recur to the text just cited,\"foremost and most authoritative names one must suppose areseated in the divine itself\"), language cannot fail to have theurgicvalue. The names of the gods that Proclus recites in the PlatonicTheology have no conceptual equivalents, even though they are sta-tioned, as we have seen, along the Parmenidean axis. Therefore, tointerpret the text is to invoke these names. But what follows fromthis invocation? The language of the Platonic Theology is a languageof vision.The text deliberately uses a gradation of names, language, anddialect that mirrors the veiling power of the lower realities that wesaw operative in the case of poetry. This hierarchical deployment oflanguage represents the devolution of reality by exploiting both dif-ferent modes of speech (visionary, mythic, or theological) and ageometric schema, in which the expansion of the One is mirroredby a geometric proliferation of principles at subsequently lowerstages of reality. The effect is the creation of a textual symbol, acircle of expanding parts emanating from a single center. The geo-metric scheme imposed upon the whole is effected through its mul-184"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in Proclus'Platonic Theologytiplication by triads, that is, through an exponential increase in thenumber of elements farther down in the cosmic decline.The basic structure that Proclus describes in his Platonic Theologyinvolves the production of a series of monads, each one replicatingitself so that its individual members reflect the contents of the entirestructure. The effect is that of a hall of mirrors. The progression ofthe Platonic Theology follows the triadic structure of Being, Life (orPower), and Mind, that together comprise the Proclan version of thesecond hypostasis.36 These levels proliferate exponentially in theirinfrastructure, with the triads exploding into nine, twenty-seven,seventy-two, over one hundred, and, finally, indefinitely many mem-bers. Within each successive level, the prior levels repeat themselvesby mirroring the basic structure of definite, indefinite, and mixed.This triad reappears in subsequent levels of reality as the paternal,generative, and perfective orders. Since lower orders are not capableof receiving or reflecting the entire content of prior orders, eachorder distinguishes itself as a partial revelation of its cause. At thesame time, this rule ensures that there are indefinitely many reflec-tions of every member of the intelligible order and that each onereflects the contents of all the other members.Although the Platonic Theology is an ontological map of the Pro-clan universe, it also implies the participation of the reader forwhom the ontology is conceived as a subjective transformation. Itsgreatest achievement is to have created an initiatory language that atonce purports to reveal the hidden codes within the textual traditionas well as to situate the subject within the interpretive universe. Wereturn to the discussion of Proclan subjectivity. It is because thePlatonic Theology purports to be an image of theurgic ascent that itfunctions as an icon of the subject.Proclus reads Platonic and Orphic mythology for their associa-tions with theurgy. The text is Proclus' attempt to reveal a sacredspace that the soul is supposed to fill out with its vision. In Proclus'exegesis of this mythic material, he emphasizes the sudden momentof psychic transformation when the mind's vision opens up beyond36 Rosan is still the best description of Proclus' noetic world. Rosan relies heavily onProclus' descriptions in the Platonic Theology. For another good description or over-view of Proclus' nous, see Lloyd 1982.185"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismits accustomed limits. Thus the Platonic Theology is concerned withthe psychology of contemplation and here Proclus employs an al-most visual approach to theurgy. Finally, it is the psychic space ofthe imagination that becomes the most important vehicle for the-urgy in the Platonic Theology.Therefore just as the nature stands creatively above the visible figures, sothe soul, exercising her capacity to know, projects on the imagination, as ona mirror, the ideas of the figures; and the imagination, receiving in pictorialform these impressions of the ideas within the soul, by their means affordthe soul an opportunity to turn inward from the pictures and attend toherself. It is as if a man looking at himself in a mirror and marveling at thepowers of nature and at his own appearance should wish to look uponhimself directly and possess such a power as would enable him to become atthe same time the seer and the object seen. In the same way, when the soulis looking outside herself at the imagination, seeing the figures depictedthere and being struck by their beauty, she is admiring her own ideas fromwhich they are derived.Although this quotation is from Proclus' Commentary on the First Bookof Euclid's Elements, it provides us with an understanding of the rela-tionship between icon and imagination in Proclus' thought. As themind's attention is redirected into this imaginal space, the space ofconsciousness, it learns to take up more room, so to speak. Proclushas transformed the Platonic dialogues into a book of divine visions.The dialogues reveal the true art of the soul; the beauty of theintellectual world consists in the art of seeing, as Proclus tells us inhis interpretation of the Phaedrean myth: \"Socrates says, explainingthe method of ascent to the intelligible beauty, how following thegods that exist prior to the body and prior to birth, we attained thatblessed vision\" (IV.g).The Language of VisionHow to attain this vision? And what is the vision about? As indicatedearlier, the vision developed in the Platonic Theology consists primarilyin the expansion of consciousness within an interior world. Proclusattempts to convey this interior world, with its ever-widening center,by interpreting the language of myth as its representation.In books IV and V of the Platonic Theology, Proclus turns to theextra-Platonic narrative tradition, to Orphism and to the Chaldean186"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in Proclus'Platonic TheologyOracles, as source material for his exegesis of central Platonic myths.Thus in book V, by drawing on the Orphic succession myth toexplicate the Timaeus, Proclus discusses the Demiurge's projectionof the Platonic Forms into chora or the receptacle. Again, in book IVProclus explicates the Phaedrus' myth of the soul's hyperouranianflight by alluding to the stations of psychic ascent evinced in theChaldean Oracles.Turing now to his exegesis of the Timaean Demiurge, we seeProclus recasting the Demiurge as the Orphic Zeus and citing Or-phic fragment 68 to motivate this interpretation. For Proclus, thePlatonic account of the Demiurge causing the world of space andtime had to be rewritten. Proclus does not accept the Platonic ac-count in which the intellect is directly related to the world of partic-ulars. Instead, Zeus gives birth to an intelligible world, a world inwhich exteriority and multiplicity are only foreshadowed.37In Platonic Theology, Proclus uses the metaphor of \"binding\" toemphasize interiority of the intellectual world:Zeus therefore, being at the same time intellectual and intelligible, intellec-tually perceives and comprehends himself, and binds the intelligible in him-self. But binding this in himself, he is said to bind the intelligibles prior tohimself, and to comprehend it on all sides. For entering into himself, heproceeds into the intelligible prior to himself, and by the intelligible whichis in himself, intellectually perceives that which is prior to himself. And thusthe intelligible is not external to intellect. For every intellect possesses thatwhich is in itself without any difference with respect to itself. But again,intellect perceives in itself that which is prior to itself. For every thing whichis external to intellect is foreign and adventitious, and pertains to an inferiornature.

For Proclus, the dualism inherent in the Platonic account ofcreation is inconceivable:38 \"Matter, therefore, and the whole of thatwhich is the subject of bodies, proceed from the first principles,37 In the Platonic Theology, Proclus underscores the difference between his own andthe Platonic accounts. He stresses the Demiurge's creation of souls and emphasizesthe correspondences between the hebdomadic divisions of the intellectual gods andthe Timaeus' account of the creation of the soul: \"After this also, the Demiurgedivides the [soul] into one circle and seven circles.

In terms of Chaldeantheology the Curetes represent the Guardian class, whose function itis to purify the intellect of its associations with the material order.Proclus etymologizes the name of the Curetes from the word formaiden and from the word for purity (TO K6pov). In book V, Proclusdelineates the structure of the intellectual cosmos: it is hebdomadic,rather than triadic. The aspect of Being is represented by the triadof the parents (Kronos, Rhea, and Zeus) and the aspect of Power isrepresented by the triad of the immaculate gods, called in the Pla-tonic Theology, the Curetes; there is also a monad that divides threeclasses of gods: the transcendent gods, the lesser gods, and theencosmic gods. This monad is represented by Proclus as the act ofcastration of Kronos! The parental triad is also associated with thefive megiste gene of the Sophist, so that Kronos is equated with Being;Rhea with Rest and Motion, and Zeus with Sameness and Difference.Despite his switching in and out of various mystical dialects, therecan be no doubt that Proclus conceives of the Chaldean tradition asprimary throughout his exegetical efforts. The second part of Pro-clus' exegetical program relates, as we have already seen, to the unityof the primordial tradition, or the accord between Plato, the Oracles,and Orpheus. The fourth book of the Platonic Theology furnishes uswith the blueprint for this Chaldean interpretation of Plato: \"Hereit is right to admire the divinely inspired science of Plato because hehas explained the method of ascent to the intelligible domain ac-cording to the chief initiators.\"The Oracles and their interpretation by the theurgists is a chiefsource for the doctrine of the noetic-noeric gods that Proclus elabo-rates in book IV of the Platonic Theology. It is clear that Proclus hascreated a visionary exegesis of the Platonic dialogue, at the sametime trying to communicate an initiatory form of language that reliesheavily on the notion of language as symbolon. In this book, we seeProclus engaging in a dialogue with his own exegetical tradition bysynthesizing the language of theurgy with the language of Platonism.Particularly noteworthy is the reification of the Phaedrean myththrough the invention of a visionary topos that is situated both inside188"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in Proclus' Platonic Theologyand outside of the text. Proclus starts with the Cratylus' definition of\"Ouranos\" as \"sight seeing what is above\"; the hyperouranion to-pos, heaven itself, and the vault below heaven (Phaedrus 247b) con-stitute, respectively, the three triads that belong to this realm.In the next paragraph, Proclus neatly explicates Plato's myth interms of three classes of Chaldean gods: the Leaders, the Leaders ofperfection or Teletarchs, and the Connectors.39 Proclus closely cor-relates the Phaedrean myth with these Chaldean ranks by discussingthe topology of the myth in terms of the theurgic rites of ascent. Inthe next ten chapters, Proclus expands upon the Chaldean-Platonicsynthesis, subdividing the ouranian topography into more elaboratetriads. Thus the hyperouranion topos consists of the three subtriads:the plain of truth, the meadow, and the nutriment of the gods; truth,justice, and temperance; and the uncolored, the unfigured, and theintangible. Proclus closes this section by reiterating the Chaldeaninterpretation of the myth as degrees of initiation: telete, muesis, andepopteia.Throughout book IV, Proclus reifies Platonic language to imposehis scheme of proliferating triads on the Phaedrean myth. The resultis a series of competing narratives, in which the original story of theheavenly charioteer and the tripartite soul is redescribed in terms ofa mythic journey.Stepping back from the narrative, it may not seem that Proclus'exegesis is terribly effective. After all, he has merely substituted onemyth for another, and Plato's language itself borrows from an earlierinitiatory tradition. And yet it is here that Proclus not only revealsthat his exegetical practice rests upon his belief in a primordialtradition and in the unity of all religions but also suggests that thishypothesis can be tested because both Plato and the Chaldeanstransmit a wisdom that exists outside of discursive thought, outsideof writing. In our passage, Proclus more than once refers to thelimitations of thinking:For it is not by means of intellection nor in general discrimination, thatinitiation takes place, but by means of the silence that surpasses Gnosticenergy, which gives faith and faith seats us in the ineffable class of gods.(IV.9.193.10-15)39 On the classes of Chaldean gods, see Majercik.189"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismAgain, the soul, in its final degree of initiation, encounters in thesupercelestial realm the divine sunthemata and magical signs of theintelligible world. These signs are only symbols of a more authenticsilence:initiation (muesis) and revelation (epopteia) are themselves symbols (symbolon)of the ineffable silence and of the unity with the intelligible by the methodof mystic revelations. (IV.g. 193.15-16)Here we see Proclus deliberately reshaping the Platonic material,working out the correspondences between the myth and theurgicrites. As a result, the language becomes infused with the theurgicsymbolism and thus operates within the realm of non-discursivethinking. Muesis, initiation, is literally interpreted as silence. In Pro-clus' hands, the myth shifts directions and seemingly indicates a non-discursive space. That is, the mythic landscape, already subsumedinto a triadic scheme by Proclus (the hyperouranion topos, heavenitself, and the subcelestial arch)40 is now redescribed not only as avisionary world but also as a world peopled by deities who reflect thesoul's own visionary status:Plato elevates the souls and the gods themselves through the fountains bymeans of the detached leaders for the visions and the journeys both blessedand entirely full are especially in those, in which the theurgists place theirentire hope of salvation. They are therefore blessed through the unmixedmonad, full through the cause of divine otherness, and visions and journeysfrom the fountains and through the fountains to the leaders of perfection(for after the many and divided intellections the good of the perfective godsappears, and descending from the intelligible and intellectual gods they fillus up and enlighten us, and before our own souls, the class of whole soulsand before these, the gods themselves). But from the perfective class theyjourney to the connective of the entire noeric order. (1V.9.192.5)Although compressed, the details of this paragraph describe arather dramatic encounter between soul and deity, between innerand outer worlds, as the soul meets its guides and prepares to leaveits abode in the cosmos and thus to discover its true identity.4140 Of course, Proclus denies that this triadic structure of the Phaedrean landscape isoriginal with him and provides evidence that other exegetes had also recognizedhis divisions. (PTIV.23).41 See Corbin, Avicenna and the Visionary Recital, for a discussion of this kind of mysticalgenre, in which the soul meets a divine guide during the couse of a mythicaljourney.190"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in ProclusfPlatonic TheologyProclus interprets the myth of the Phaedrus as a journey upon whichthe soul will encounter its divine guide and so be led to its originalhome. The text is now punctuated by an exegetical awkwardness. IfPlato's myth is about the soul's union with the intelligible world, whydoesn't the narrative accommodate this interpretation? Here Proclusmust employ a kind of reverse argumentum ex silentio: mystical unionis a difficult moment to describe. From the point of view of ascent,the soul has now overcome the discursive realm: of course, it isimpossible to communicate the nature of this transformation. Whatis of interest is the extent to which theurgic language become prev-alent within this discussion:And how the souls accomplish their union with the first rank of the intelli-gibles is no longer indicated through the texts of Plato; for it is a mysteryalso that occurs by unspeakable means, just as it seemed to them [thetheurgists] as well, and it is through this station that the mystic unity occurswith the intelligibles and the first causes. Therefore the same method ofascent is also found among us and on this account the method of theurgicascent is more credible. (1V.9.192.24-193-5.)The exegetical complexity becomes acute at this point: discussinga mythical passage of the Phaedrus, Proclus interprets it in terms ofthe Parmenides. But the exegesis of the Parmenides depends on aChaldean tradition of the noetic-noeric gods. And finally, the wholepassage is said to refer to a theurgic ritual involving the soul's unionwith intellect. After such an elaborate exegesis, Proclus almost in-credibly claims that the text is describing a ritual. Its true meaningis extra-textual and outside of language altogether.The Space of the TextIt is not difficult to imagine that Proclus views this theurgic ascent asexploration of the limits of the subjective. Proclan metaphysical re-alism demands that for every level of reality within the subject thereis a corresponding objective level that informs it. But since subjectiv-ity itself is reified or formalized within this text, metaphysical realismbecomes to say the least obscured. Its ornate elaboration of thevarious triads seems at times to arrest the mind with an impenetrablediscursive landscape, as if to give a sense of the overflowing fullnessand vastness of the intelligible world. And yet, this text does not"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismopenly reflect upon the central ontological fact of the entire descrip-tion; namely, that in all of this, reality devolves by means of moreand more limited forms of being, that is to say, more and moreindividualized modes of consciousness. By contrast, not only is Ploti-nus very concerned to discuss the structure of consciousness on itsown terms, but he actually views contemplation as a kind of object-less or pure consciousness. Proclus never discusses the idea of ob-jectless awareness. The text presents us with a proliferation of ob-jects, as if to leave no room at all for the subject of awareness.At any rate, we are left with the question of just how this textualtheurgy is supposed to operate. Superficially, the book is simplyabout texts; it presents us with an intertexual reading of Plato thatcreates a kind of false genealogy for the texts it sets out to explain,positing a historical reversal that makes the earlier Platonic text ananticipation of the later theurgic texts. Proclus nevertheless insiststhat the true reference point of the text is extra-textual. We are leftto consider this paradox.At this point, it will be helpful to recall the formal explanation forthis paradox, the fact that the text itself has theurgic associations, aswe have seen. For Proclus, language is inherently theurgical, bothbecause all forms of discourse are an extension of the divine namesand because language reiterates the hierarchical nature of reality.Moreover theurgical ritual is graded according to the intellectualdevelopment of the person practicing, and speech offering is a sub-lime form of the ritual. Theurgic rite involves the creation of a ritualcosmos, which is then sacralized through its capacity to draw downthe power of the gods. In the case of our text, the text itself becomessuch a ritual cosmos and hence possesses talismanic properties.If Proclus presents the Platonic Theology as an initiatory text, itthen appears to create an anti-discursive space, replacing the textual-ity of Plato with a ritual that is supposed to operate in non-discursiveterms. In fact, Proclus achieves just the opposite effect. Far frompresenting the subject with an alternate to discursive forms, he trans-lates the subject in terms of a textual space. Thus the very purposeof this text seems to be an inscribing of the reader within the textualtradition, into the linguistic landscape of the text. At last we mustconclude that the ritual affiliations of the Platonic Theology do notsucceed in overcoming its textuality. Rather, the reader is expected192"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in Proclus'Platonic Theologyto enter into the world of the text. The result is the immersion ofthe subject within a highly textualized discursive practice.Conclusion: Visions of Language - An Overview of Proclus'Platonic TheologyProclus works within a framework of language that reaches across anumber of different categories: prayer, talisman, revelation, myth,divine names, initiation, and even silence. Amidst this barrage oflinguistic categories, it does not escape our attention that what he isprimarily doing is a form of exegesis. His work presents Plato'sdialogues as a sacred scripture that supports an exegetical universecomprised by tradition, revelation, and interpretation.The hermeneutic circle constructed by this procedure is almostimpenetrable while its argument is almost disingenuous: Proclusbegins the book by promising a scientific discussion and expositionof the Parmenidean levels of being. What he delivers is a universe oflanguage that exists on so many different levels that it at once over-determines the possibilities of interpretation and exegesis. If thetruth in language is more fiction than truth and if this fiction isperpetrated by all the seers of truth, this leaves human beings in aterrible predicament.Even though some writings can claim an impressive set of creden-tials because of either their prestige or their origin, this fact alonecannot reassure us that the narrative strands Proclus manages toweave together are coherent. The problem remains that traditions,as Proclus presents them, are either too syncretic to be authentic ortoo fragmentary and fractured to have any force. Exchanging meta-phors and narrative styles, translating myth into metaphysics andmetaphysics into myth - all of this is an attempt to force the issue oflanguage into an uncompromising dilemma.Either language does not refer to anything outside of its ownfictionality, and truth merely translates into fragmentary truths, orreality itself must finally give way to the weight of traditional narra-tive. This assault upon the psyche - its overwhelming with languageand the displacement of its orientation - is calculated to foreverchange the mind.Finally, one enters into this interpretive universe from which the"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismonly escape is to take another direction. Perhaps this trap of lan-guage hides some hidden doorway. The categories of traditionallanguage overlap and intersect each other with no apparent order.While distinguishing types of traditional discourse, Proclus assimi-lates them in practice, so that interpretation becomes primary de-spite the prestige of these texts. The interpretive universe that Pro-clus constructs loses its contours in the web of narratives thatconstantly displace each other. If prayer, revelation, theology, andmythology all originate in the same interpretive world that permitsthe equation of forms of discourse that normally compete with eachother, then this is because they are all elements in Proclus' ownvision of language.Proclus' program, his attempt to recover a primordial tradition bycrossing the boundaries between traditional genres and creating anintertexuality among texts that originally do not refer to each other,shows his sophistication as an exegete. He realizes that no text canbe isolated and willingly reads texts through the traditions that havecome to displace the original texts. But Proclus has left the tradi-tional categories of language intact. They are not mere tropes ormetaphors for ordinary descriptive language. Exegesis itself is only apretext for the creation of something vastly more important than acommentary, albeit Proclus writes in the commentary tradition.This subordination to tradition and the refusal to claim originalityin his work suggests that exegesis is the key to the tradition. Nomatter what the text says, it is read through an exegetical frameworkthat can translate the original text into an equally authentic voice.Thus nowhere does philosophy as a system of analyzing texts appearas a contribution to the enterprise. In fact, translation into a lan-guage that pretends to be intelligible is mere deception. By translat-ing the theology of Plato into the language of myth and magic,Proclus does what he has to as an apologist for the Neoplatonictradition. Ultimately, Proclus is not interested in conveying a strictlylinear reading of the Parmenides or the Platonic corpus. Instead, heis after an effect that can be achieved through only an oversaturationin the discursive realm.Traditional narrative is always disclosed within the context of rit-ual - it is at once a performance as well as a recital. Prayer, vocesmysticae, divine names, oracles, and mystical numbers are all formsof ritual speech that appear in the text of Proclus. Moreover, the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Language and Theurgy in Produs' Platonic Theologyoverall pattern of the text resembles traditional ritual genres, suchas heavenly ascents or descents, hymns, mystical cosmologies, andinitiatory myths. Thus although Proclus writes in a prestigious andelite philosophical institution that historically invoked the mythicwhile simultaneously diffusing its ritualism, we see a reversal in hiscase.For Proclus, the constraints of tradition presented him with adiscursivity that had to be interrupted through the superimpositionof a different kind of language. That this strategy at once violates thegenre of exegesis and threatens to avoid the task of interpretationby the displacement of meaning onto a ritual language lacking anydiscursive counterpart is the inevitable consequence of his member-ship in a tradition in which discursivity was the final obstacle over-shadowing the text. Proclus' text, then, fights with itself and with itstradition in an effort to articulate the limits of linguistic interpreta-tion.If in the midst of this theological exegesis we find the remnantsof a linguistic mysticism that defies the philosophical tradition inwhich he operates, this does not mean that Proclus reads naively orperversely. Rather, Proclus realizes the power and responsibility im-plied by the act of interpretation and by the authorized or institu-tional dissemination of a text. Proclus and other members of histradition are committed to a form of exegesis that leaves the doorwayto vision open, precisely because for them these texts are the bestand even sole guarantee that this doorway can and will remain open.Were it not for the textual artifacts that constrain the mind of thereader to search in a realm that seemingly does not yield its meaningreadily or apparently, and one that operates, moreover, in defianceof the text, this whole process of interpretation would come to anabrupt end. The distinction between speculative texts, exegeticaltexts, and magical or ritual texts is deliberately obscured. This isProclus' final pronouncement upon the status of the text in a tradi-tion that uncompromisingly repudiates the discursive, despite thatits most appropriate symbolon can only be the text.If this strategy appears arbitrary or even contradictory, this is onlybecause Proclus finds the very concept of interpretation dangerouslyseductive and highly charged with possibility. Proclus is fully awareof the interpretive choices that govern his own construction of thevisionary universe. But that universe does not and cannot emerge"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismindependently of that choice. This means finally that the interpreta-tion will not yield its meaning to someone not willing to embracethe vision that the text presents. Only after this has been accom-plished, when the universe of interpretation is embraced as one'sown world, can the reader be said to have fulfilled the pragmaticexpectations of the text. This is not to deny the reader his or herown interpretive choices nor to suggest that the meaning of text isoutside of its own deliverances. In fact, the last token required forthe completion of the ritual cosmos instantiated by the text can becontributed only by the reader.196"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"9Damascius' Ineffable DiscourseIntroduction to Damascius and the Apotiai kai Luseis PeriProton Archon (Doubts and Solutions Concerning First Principles)Damascius (ca. 462-538) was scholarch when the Christian emperorJustinian shut down the Platonic Academy in 529, issuing a decreethat banned all pagans from teaching in Athens.

Facedwith increasing hostility and competition from Christianity, the Neo-platonists found it was time to break the silence maintained forcenturies concerning their mystery religions and to publish theirown, alternative salvation narratives as part of a concerted effort at apagan revival.6 Because it is a celebration of pagan mysteries as wellas a critical overhaul of Platonic school doctrine, the Peri Archon is ofinestimable value for the study of the histories of Western meta-physics and Western religions. Specifically, it shows the Neoplatonistsengaged in an intense debate over the issue of metaphysical dualismthroughout their centuries of dogmatizing. The Peri Archon offers abrilliant internal critique of Neoplatonic metaphysics, sheddingmuch light on questions of method and dialectic within the lastphase of the Academy.Earlier we looked at Proclus' Platonic Theology and saw that Neo-platonists held that Plato's Parmenides was a theological disquisitionthat charted not only the fundamental principles of reality but alsothe emergence of any possible form of being from one transcendentsource.7 It is in this tradition of exegesis of Plato's Parmenides thatthe Peri Archon finds its place.Plotinus launched the tradition.

If the One is beyond Being (a premise thatPlotinus took directly from Plato's Republic) then Being emerges onlyas a subsequent stage of reality, at the level of Intellect, while transi-tory Being originates in the third hypostasis, or Soul. Plotinus left itfor his followers to iron out the details of precisely how the entiredialogue mapped onto the universe as a whole. Proclus, the fifth-century Athenian Neoplatonist, left a catalogue of these attempts inbook VI of his Commentary on the Parmenides (col. 1052.31 ff.)« Therehe set forth in astonishing detail the evolution of this exegeticaltradition, beginning with Plotinus' disciples, Amelius and Porphyry,and ending with the interpretation of his own teacher, Syrianus.8On all of the surviving manuscripts, Doubts and Solutions ConcerningFirst Principles is found in continuation with another work of Damas-cius, his Commentary on the Parmenides. As we have just seen, the PeriArchon forms part of the exegetical tradition on Plato's Parmenides,yet it is not formally a commentary and should perhaps be seen asan independent work apart from the Parmenides commentary. ThePeri Archon concerns itself with the first hypostasis, the Ineffable, theOne, and the noetic triad, whereas Damascius' Commentary on theParmenides proceeds by discussing the theological implications of allnine of the hypotheses recognized in the Neoplatonist's reading ofthe dialogue, beginning with the intelligible diacosm.

Tensions between a transcendent One, utterlyunrelated to any form of Being, and an originary One, source andsupport of all reality, broke out in the doctrinal disputes of Plotinus'successors, with Porphyry elevating the causal aspect of the One atthe risk of collapsing the second hypostasis into the first. Respondingto this solution, Iamblichus proposed that there were two first prin-ciples before the level of Being: the first One, not associated withcausality, and a second One, which was.10 We learn of this debate inthe Peri Archon, where Damascius' historical narrative punctuates hisown metaphysical queries. Damascius uses this issue as an introduc-tion to his handbook. At the heart of the Neoplatonists' metaphysicalenterprise is a fundamental contradiction, according to Damascius:If all things come from the absolute, then the absolute is a principleor a cause of other things. But if the absolute is a cause, it is nolonger the absolute, since it then exists in relation to others.In the Peri Archon, central Platonic dogmas are analyzed and oftenswept away. What is left in their place? Damascius characterizes theresults of his inquiry as \"a reversal of discourse.\" To motivate thisreversal, there are a number of methodological resources at hisdisposal, including certain techniques that recall Skeptical strategies,a tendency to argue in utramque partem, and a heavy emphasis on thevia apophatica. The \"reversal of discourse\" that Damascius so oftenalludes to refers to an emphasis upon method, to an investigation ofthe process of inquiry. This methodological self-awareness is one ofthe most innovative features of the Peri Archon.Moreover, the Peri Archon discusses theoretical issues underlyingthe Neoplatonic theories of causation and emanation, according towhich successively lower orders of reality proceed from the firstprinciple, or One, in a process of undiminished and indefinite self-10 Dillon, Iamblichi Chalcidensis in Platonis dialogos commentariorum fragmenta.2OO"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable Discourseextension on the part of this first principle. Damascius affirms theprinciple previously enunciated by Proclus, that this entire devolu-tion of reality is based on a series of negations. If we negate theIneffable, the result is the One. Failing to grasp the Ineffable, themind projects the idea of the One in the form of a series of Henads,and so forth. This failure and subsequent projection continue tooccur all the way down the long chain of being. Yet unlike theextreme realism of Proclus, for whom the ontological categories oftraditional metaphysics were all reified as components of reality'sfullness, Damascius hints that the devolution of reality is itself onlypartially real. We will return to this observation shortly.Compared to prior Commentators in this tradition, Damascius'innovations are the replacement of the One by the Ineffable, a movewhose methodological and doctrinal consequences will be surveyed,as well as a continuation of the concept of procession through thefour negative hypotheses of Plato's Parmenides. Previously, Neopla-tonists had worked only with the positive hypotheses of Plato's Par-menides, that is, with all the theses couched in such terms as \"if theOne exists.\" In the exegetical tradition beginning with Plotinus,Neoplatonists argued that the Parmenidean hypotheses describedthe process of emanation from the One; Plato's \"consequences\"represent the various stations of Being that derive from the One, inProclus' words, \"the genesis and procession of the gods.\"11 Damas-cius, by contrast, also discussed the levels of reality associated withthe negative hypotheses, or with those theses expressed in such termsas \"if the One does not exist.\" This last innovation has become thebasis of a somewhat controversial interpretation of Damascius' phi-losophy as a whole, developed systematically by Joseph Combes in anumber of articles as well as in the introductions to his translations.1211 Proclus, Platonic Theology, III, p. 162.

The first five principles alludedto in the Peri Archon refer to a structure or system consisting of theIneffable, the One, and the noetic triad,13 which are roughly theequivalent of the first two Proclan hypostases, the One and Being/Intellect, also called the dyad.14 As we will see more clearly by theend of this chapter, Damascius also criticizes Proclus' views on theHenads, causation, emanation, and intellect. However, it is not justdoctrinal disagreement that occasions Damascius' objections to Pro-clus. In his methodology, Damascius is aporetic rather than dog-matic, is more appreciative of the provisional nature of certain meta-physical solutions, and places a great deal of emphasis on a non-dualperspective. By \"non-dual\" in this context, I mean that for Damas-cius' philosophy, a certain perspective remains operative and condi-tions any statement made about the nature of reality. This perspec-tive is perhaps best expressed by Damascius when he writes:As many things as constitute the multiplicity in a divided mode, the One isall of these things before its division . . . The One dissolves all things bymeans of its own simplicity and it is All things before [they are] all things.(C-WI, 24.11)In Damascius' debate with the tradition, what is at stake is the statusof the One. The dialectical examination of transcendence itselfstems from a certain commitment to carrying out implications ofnon-dualism within his philosophical methods. Damascius intendsSophist in terms of their reification of non-being and believes that Damascius treatsnon-Being not just as a linguistic phenomenon, but as integral to his own ontologyas well as to Plato's. Damascius, according to Combes, sees the soul as the principleof non-Being and is interested, accordingly, in a \"discourse of appearance\" thattakes as its rightful subject the soul. Since this chapter concerns itself only with theDoubts and Solutions Concerning First Principles, I will not be studying the implicationsof Damascius' innovations with regard to the Parmenidean hypotheses. Damascius'concern with the psychology of illusion is, I believe, an interesting topic because itcomplements his theory of the completely descended soul.This enumeration of five principles is somewhat tendentious because of the provi-sional or contested nature of Damascius' solutions to the earlier dispute concerningthe status of the first principle.On the relationship between Damascius' noetic triad and Proclus' dyad, see Lin-guiti, chapter 3."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable Discoursenot to inculcate an ontology of the One, but rather to inculcate aphilosophy that is situated within the first principle. As a conse-quence, all statements about lower hypostases or about an ontologysituated outside of the first principle are subject to the caveat that\"the One dissolves all things by means of its own simplicity.\" Allthings, including Being itself, fall short of the One; their reality ismerely provisional. Sometimes we see Damascius questioning funda-mental Neoplatonist principles, such as the identity of knower andknown in the act of intellectual knowing, or the complete transcen-dence of the One with respect to its effects. This non-dual approachto metaphysics can often look like Skeptical epoche. Although Damas-cius was no doubt acquainted with the writings of Sextus Empiricusand other Skeptics, the destructive side of his metaphysics representshis own attempts to bolster the tradition from within.15 In this chap-ter I will be arguing that the Peri Archon is of great importance forthe history of Neoplatonism because it shows how deeply felt was thecritique of discursivity within this tradition, despite its seeminglypositivistic conceptions. The aporetic method of Damascius subvertsthe metaphysical ambitions of his tradition insofar as they threatento abandon the search for wisdom in favor of a complacent dogma-tism.In his general introduction to Proclus' Commentary on the Parmeni-des, John Dillon attempts to sketch some of the fundamental princi-ples of Procline metaphysics. He starts with Proposition 11 of theElements of Theology, \"All that exists proceeds from a single firstcause.\" As we will shortly discover, Damascius explicitly criticizes thisproposition in the opening paragraphs of the Peri Archon. For now,we turn to Dillon's discussion of ET 11:The basic problem with which all Neoplatonic speculation is concerned,from Plotinus on, is how a multiplicity, and worse, a multiplicity of levels ofbeing, can derive from a totally transcendent and simple One. Plotinus hadpropounded the theory of undiminished giving by the One, the image ofthe inexhaustible spring, which creates without being affected by its creation(e.g. Enn. V,3-i2). The universe thus produced from the One is a plenum,in which no gap can be tolerated (e.g. Enn. 11,9.3). From Iamblichus on, asI have said, this principle leads to a progressive multiplication of entities . . .of moments within each hypostasis. The principle which Dodds calls the15 On Damascius' appropriation of Skeptical techniques, see Rappe 1998a and 1998b.203"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonism\"law of continuity\" is well stated by Proclus at De Prov. IV, 20: \"the proces-sions of real being, far more even than the positions of physical bodies inspace, leave no vacuum, but everywhere there are mean terms betweenextremities, which provide for them a mutual linkage.\"16Damascius begins his critique of Procline metaphysics by raisingan aporia concerning the status of the first principle:Is the one principle of all things beyond all things or is it one among allthings, the summit of everything that proceeds from it? And are we to saythat all are things with the [first principle], or after it and [that they pro-ceed] from it? (C-WI.i = R 1.1.1-3)To understand this puzzle, the reader must remember the debate,already mentioned, between Iamblichus and Porphyry concerningthe status and number of principles before the first noetic triad:Next let us turn to the question of whether there are two first principlesbefore the first noetic triad, especially that [principle] which is completelyIneffable and which has no relationship to the triad (just as the great Iam-blichus has it in his Twenty-eighth Book of his most perfect Chaldean Theol-ogy) , or as the majority of those who came after him have supposed, afterthe Ineffable cause (which is also the One) comes the first intelligible triad,or should one go beneath this principle and agree with Porphyry in sayingthat the one cause of all things is itself the Father that belongs to the noetictriad? (C-WII.1.1-14)17Damascius examines the issue fully in II 1-15 and tends to approvethe position of Iamblichus as against Porphyry, without committinghimself entirely to the Iamblichean solution. The name for the firstOne in the Peri Archon is the arreton, the Ineffable. Damascius surveysfour arguments in support of the Iamblichean position and thengoes on to refute these arguments from the viewpoint of the Ineffa-ble. For example, Damascius considers the argument that posits aPythagorean system according to which Remaining, Procession, andReturn are hypostasized as the monad, dyad, and triad, respectively.This system would leave the Ineffable as that with which the monadremains, etymologizing from the name \"monad\" (p,6vag) to theword p,ovtf| (C-W II 3-4). But as Damascius says in his critique of this16 Dillon 1987, pp. xvi-xvii, with a few omissions.17 For the details of this debate, see Dillon, Introduction to Iamblichi Chalcidensis inPlatonis dialogos commentariorum fmgmenta.204"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable Discourseargument, it would then be difficult to distinguish this monad, orOne, from the Ineffable:Now if the One is after the Ineffable, the departure from the One couldnot take the form of a Procession, since there would no longer be such adeparture. The One would unify all things with each other and also withtheir native causes, to the extent that all things are One with the One, sothat it would not even be able to distinguish itself from the Ineffable.Therefore, in positing this One, it nevertheless is shown to exist in themanner of the Ineffable. (C-WII 14.1-6)Against the argument that attempts to distinguish a One unrelatedto the noetic triad from the monad that is related, Damascius re-minds the reader:In reality, concerning the argument based on the difference between theOne and the Monad, we must recall that neither the Monad nor the Oneexists there in truth, so neither can we set up a difference between the Oneand the Monad. Rather the same hypothesis and the same figurative lan-guage covers both terms. (C-WII 13.1-5)The point here is that the Ineffable cannot be the subject of ametaphysical argument or the basis of a metaphysical system at all. Itcannot be either incorporated within or accounted for outside ofthe causal system that forms the structure of Neoplatonic meta-physics. From the point of view of the Ineffable, no such systemexists. From the point of view of metaphysical discourse, the Ineffa-ble is a term that can occupy no fixed place within the system:It is not above or below; it belongs neither to the category of first or ultimate,for there is no procession [from it]. It is not replete with all things nor yetdoes it contain all things; it is not within the realm of that which can bespoken, nor is it the One itself. (C-W I 24.7-10)Consequently, all arguments for the Ineffable are ineffectual, if notself-refuting. In these sections, we can see the provisional nature ofDamascius' solutions to the enigmas of Neoplatonic ontology. Hedoes by all accounts found his own discourse on the Ineffable, buthe is also careful to show that this principle is not a hypotheticalconstruct, a logical consequence of a prior philosophical system, ora part of an explanatory apparatus.As already mentioned, this historical debate forms the back-ground for Damascius' introduction to the Peri Archon, to which wenow return:205"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismIs that which is designated as the one principle of all things beyond all thingsor is it one among all things, the summit of everything that proceeds fromit?

(CW I1.1-5) 18Damascius begins his treatise by asking, \"Is the one principle of allthings beyond all things, or is it one of all things?\" Characteristically,he denies both sides of the dilemma: since \"all things\" designatesthat from which nothing is lacking, \"all things\" must include thecause of all things:The term \"all things\" [refers] in the strict sense to that from which nothingis absent. But [now we are supposing that] the principle itself is missing.Therefore that which comes after the first principle is not in the strict senseall things, but rather all things except the first principle.From its inception, the Peri Archon seemingly violates the fundamen-tal assumption of Neoplatonic metaphysics, canonized in Proclus'Elements of Theology, that multiplicity derives from unity. For ourpurposes, number 75, that \"every cause properly so-called tran-scends its effect,\" is breached at the outset in Damascius' Peri Archon,when he suggests that the \"cause must be ranked among the ef-fects.\" After dismissing the first half of the dilemma, Damascius goeson to reject the second. If all things include their cause, there is nocause for all things, since the cause will be included among itseffects. But without the cause, the effect cannot exist.Now if all things are together with the first principle, there cannot be aprinciple for all things, since on the supposition that the principle can besubsumed by all things, there would be no principle [i.e. no beginning, nocause] for all things. Therefore [let us say that] the single coordinateddisposition of all things (which we designate by the term, 'all things') iswithout a first principle and uncaused, lest we [continue the search] adinfinitum.

He concedes that there isno objection to the One and the many being temporally coordinate. This admissionwill be important when we compare the Skeptics on the temporal aspect of causalrelation.2O6"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable DiscourseIn fact, Damascius denies the basic Neoplatonic theory of causa-tion, the thesis that a cause is greater than its effects. In keeping withthis theory of causation, Neoplatonists assume that the proliferationof effects from their causes means that reality constantly dispatchesitself into inferior states of being. In a section of Peri Archon entitled' 'On the Unified,\" Damascius investigates the question of whatwould motivate this procession or descent, responding directly to theviews of his predecessors, Syrianus and Proclus.Now it is worth considering what brings about the distinction between theunified and that which comes after the unified. For the unified itself couldnot be the cause of this distinction. That would be like the case of anopposite generating [its] opposite. Should we agree with the philosophersand answer that the effect must be inferior to the cause?Here Damascius answers Proposition 7 of the Elements, \"Every pro-ductive cause is superior to that which it produces,\"19 with the objec-tion that derivation from a cause does not in itself account for thedifferences between cause and effect. Plotinus argued that the fullnature of the cause was available for transmission to the effect.20 Itwas only the inferior capacity of the effect to express the qualities ofthe cause that introduced the difference between cause and effect.21But why is it necessary that an effect prove inferior to its cause?Damascius applies his more general critique of causation to thespecific case of procession:Now [let's look] in another way at a puzzle that is both ancient and modern.Either procession is from that which exists, in which case, how could whatalready exists previously [be able to] proceed? Or else procession comesfrom something that doesn't exist, yet what kind of being could come fromsomething that doesn't exist? Something actual cannot come from some-thing potential, since the former is superior to the latter, while the effect isalways inferior to the cause.

On the surface, it looks as if Damasciushere is simply denying Proclus' ET11, \"All that exists proceeds froma single cause.\" Although this is not literally false, it would be moretrue to say that here and throughout his discussion of causation,Damascius cautions us about the provisional nature of metaphysicaltenets as such. Damascius does not specify a cause for all things orset up a unique cause that can be designated as the \"first principle,\"but he does not thereby negate causation or posit a self-causingprinciple, since both of these alternatives would also be metaphysicaltenets subject to the cautions established at the outset of the treatise:But if it is necessary to [assert something] by way of demonstration, thenlet us make use of the apophatic provisions, and say that It is neither Onenor Many, neither Generative nor without issue, neither Cause nor withoutcausal properties, and yet, [let us be aware that] these very provisions over-turn themselves, I imagine, indefinitely. (C-W I 22.15-20)At the beginning of this section, I quoted from John Dillon's intro-duction to Proclus' Commentary on the Parmenides. Dillon rightly pointsout that Proclus shapes the Elements of Theology as a speculative meta-physics, positing, in a sense, unity or the One as the exotic or extopicexplanans for plurality, conceived as immediate, present to hand,and therefore requiring explanation. We can see that Damasciusshifts the perspective of his metaphysics; he struggles to create ametaphysical discourse that accommodates, insofar as language can,the ultimate principle of reality. After all, how coherent is a meta-physical system that bases itself on the Ineffable as a first principle?Instead of creating an objective ontology, Damascius writes evermindful of the limitations of dialectic, of the pitfalls and snaresinherent in the very structure of metaphysical discourse.The Status of Metaphysical DiscourseDamascius recognizes that the language of metaphysics functions tosignify something beyond itself. It is best thought of as a mnemonicdevice; its purpose is to deliver human beings from their own igno-rant determinations about the nature of reality, without therebyimprisoning them in a metaphysical system that displaces realityitself. Hence apophasis, denial or negation, is a method that not onlynegates all lesser realities, leaving only the Ineffable, it also applies208"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable Discourseto the language of metaphysics itself. A certain denial or demotion,one might say, of the metaphysical enterprise as such, must be pro-grammed into the very structure of such discourse.22As we saw, it had become already a standard topos for Plotinusthat his designation for the absolute principle, ''the One,\" was notsemantically significant, did not pick out any object, but simply indi-cated the refusal to designate. But for Damascius, the ineffability ofthe One engulfs the metaphysical enterprise, infecting it with non-sense, with in-significance. Because of it, we are forced to confrontthe question, how does the experience of ineffability ground theprospects for truth seeking? Here we turn to Damascius' own defini-tion of \"apophasis,\" in book I, chapter 42, of the Peri Archon:In one way, [the term] \"The Ineffable\" is apophatic. By this I do not meanthat the term designates anything positive at all, but that this term is noteven a negation: it is complete removal. It is not merely not-a-thing (sincewhat is not-a-thing is still something) but it absolutely has no reality. So wedefine this term, \"ineffable,\" in such a way that it is not even a term.The \"Ineffable\" is a term that does not possess a meaning in theordinary sense, since it has no semantic function. It is not a term sothat its deployment in language conveys nothing at all to the readeror listener. That this word nevertheless forms the basis of Damascius'philosophical activity inevitably leads to a self-conscious meditationon the status of his own language, which Damascius often refers toas a radical reversal, or peritrope, of language. This admonition con-cerning the misdirection built into metaphysical language is relatedto a technical term, endeixis, a word that appears over one hundredtimes in the text of the Peri Archon. In our treatise, the word endeixistypically conveys the idea of hinting at or of suggesting a reality thatis then left indeterminate. For Damascius and his school, the lan-guage of metaphysics is even at its best allusive; although meta-physical discourse provides us with an image of truth it cannot beconflated with truth and so is more symbolic or iconic than discur-22 Here I would like to invoke the concept of \"performative intensity,\" that MichaelSells uses in his book, The Mystical Languages of Unsaying, to explain the otherwisemystifying epoche, or suspension of belief, that drives the structure of Damascius'exposition.

Thus Proclus and Simplicius both allow that any teaching aboutrealities such as intellect and soul must take place by means ofendeixis, by means of coded language.23 Throughout the treatise,Damascius is at pains to remind the reader that he is speaking as awhole only provisionally, kata endeixin. In Neoplatonic texts, the wordendeixis is linked to Pythagorean symbolism and conveys the sense ofallusive or enigmatic language, though the history of its meaningmust be recovered through aversion to Hellenistic scientific dis-course.24This word became prevalent in later Hellenistic epistemology as ameans of distinguishing different kinds of signs.25 Sextus Empiricusdiscusses primarily two sorts of signs: the mnemonic and the indica-tive.26 Unlike the mnemonic sign, which simply formalizes the ex-pected associations between any two events, where expectations fol-low directly from experience, the indicative sign designates a logicalcondition obtaining between two events or states of affairs.27 Toparaphrase Michael Frede, an indicative sign is one from which onecan rationally infer the presence of an otherwise unmanifest object,as, for example, an atomist might infer the existence of the voidfrom the existence of atoms. When used by ancient medical writers,the indicative sign stood for a method of diagnosing and treatingillnesses.28 The assumption governing the rationalist practitioner's23 Cf.

The frequent appear-ance of this word in the Peri Archon increases the evidence that Damascius read theactual writings of the Skeptics and also suggests that his thought was colored bySkeptical modes of analysis.

Thus, for the ratio-nalist, \"indication\" signified the relation obtaining between themanifest state of the body (that is, the patient's symptoms) and theunderlying hidden abnormal state, the disease.29As used by Damascius, the word endeixis suggests that the languageof metaphysics must be acknowledged to be at most a promptingtoward inquiry into something that exceeds its own domain as de-scriptive.30 The result of this inquiry tells us more about our ownstates of ignorance than about the goal of the search:If, in speaking about the One, we attempt the following collocations, viz. thatit is ineffable, that it does not belong to the category of all things, and thatit is not apprehensible by means of intellectual knowledge, then we ought torecognize that these constitute the language of our own labors. This lan-guage is a form of hyperactivity that stops on the threshold of the mysterywithout conveying anything about it at all. Rather, such language announcesthe subjective experiences of aporia and misapprehension that arise in con-nection with the One, and that not even clearly, but by means of hints . . .(C-W I 6.5-10)Endeixis, hinting at reality, becomes a technique that captures fea-tures of the psychology of inquiry without successfully transcendingthe subjective. To describe philosophical discourse as endeixis is tolimit its ambitions.31 Endeixis in this sense is not a descriptive use oflanguage, but encompasses a number of different linguistic devices.Thus, for example, the language of negation is not referential; neg-ative adjectives when applied to the Ineffable do not attribute any-thing to it nor determine its nature. Instead, by using negative lan-guage we succeed only in delimiting our own discursive practices:Nor do we affirm that [the Ineffable] is unknowable in the sense that theunknowable has a determinate nature, being something other, nor do wecall it \"being,\" nor \"one,\" nor \"all,\" nor \"principle of the all\" nor \"beyondall things.\" We deny that it is possible to make any statement about it at all.But this again is not its nature, viz., the expressions \"not a thing,\" \"beyondall,\" \"causeless cause,\" and \"unrelated to anything,\" nor do these attributes29 Frede 1987b, pp. 269-75.30 For the word endeixis in the Peri Archon, see Galperine 1987, Introduction, p. 34, n.108.31 On this topic, see Galperine 1987, Introduction, pp. 34-5.211"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismconstitute its nature. Rather, they serve simply to remove anything that arisesafter the Ineffable. (R.I 11, 15-25)Again, Damascius does not reify the conventions of apophatic dis-course, nor does he claim that such negative language succeeds inreferring:No name will be able to convey the meaning of the transcendent, since aname belongs to a system of reference. One must finally deny the [name ofthe transcendent] as well. But even denial is a form of discourse, and thatmakes what is denied an object of discourse, but the transcendent is nothing,not even something to be denied, in no way expressible, not knowable at all,so that one can not even negate its negation. Rather the only way of reveal-ing that of which we speak is simply the deferral of language and of concep-tions about it. (C-W I.21.12-18)A discourse on the Ineffable is not a metaphysical treatise in theusual sense of the word. Its purpose is to remove confidence inestablished doctrine and to reverse, as Damascius puts it, the moreusual direction of language. Language turns back upon itself be-cause its purpose is to negate its own function. Damascius' chosenname for his style of metaphysics is peritrope, and this word too has ahistory in the annals of Skepticism.32 Although it can be literallytranslated as \"reversal,\" its sense in the context of dialectic refers toarguments overturned by means of premises internal to them. SextusEmpiricus, for example, refers to a whole class of such overturningarguments, or arguments whose very assertion undermines the di-alectical stance of the person who asserts them.33 Damascius' appro-priation of this Skeptical term relates primarily to any statementmade about the Ineffable, since the Ineffable is by designation anddefinition outside the reach of any linguistic system: \"our languageis self-refuting when we attach such predicates to the Ineffable as4Outside of Language,' 'Nothing at all,' 'Ungraspable by the Intel-lect' \" (C-WI.10).In the history of their debates with the dogmatists, Skeptics wereoften accused of hoisting themselves on their own petard, particu-larly with regard to their stance of akatalepsia, their assertion that32 For the history of the word peritrope in Skeptical debates, see Burnyeat 1976.33 See Burnyeat 1976. For example, someone who asserts that causes do not exist isundermined if he or she attempts to demonstrate this assertion by invoking reasonsfor this assertion.212"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable Discoursenothing is apprehensible. The Skeptics reply that akatalepsia is not adescriptive or indicative term; it does not purport to describe a stateof affairs in the world, but rather signifies the the Skeptical epoche,the refusal to make any statement about the nature of things.34 If theSkeptics embrace epoche, suspension of belief, as their solution to theimpending dangers of peritrope, one could argue that, in a parallelway, Damascius embraces silence or ineffability. As he says concern-ing the first principle, \"we define this term, 'ineffable,' in such a waythat it is not even a term\" (C-W I.62.10). The \"limit of philosophicaldiscourse\" (jtepac; TOV \\6yov) refers to the complete removal of anyproposition or any statement about reality. This limit is \"silencewithout recourse\" (C-W I.22), or \"silence that frees us from [ourown] productions\" (C-WI.22).Doctrinal ConsequencesThe HenadsSo far we have seen that Damascius' approach to the first principlehas methodological implications. Nevertheless, as Damascius himselfsays concerning the Ineffable, this method does not leave one withmuch to say about reality, especially given that the name, \"Ineffa-ble,\" does not name any kind of reality. As long as there remainssomething to name, one has not yet taken away all that is added toreality from outside, from the productions of the mind.In a certain way the Ineffable amounts to a negation, and in using this kindof language, I do not intend to predicate anything of it or to posit anythingabout it. Rather, what I intend by this name or by what it names is neither adenial nor an affirmation, but the complete removal of everything. (C-W I,62.4-7)Still, it is legitimate to ask, and Damascius does ask, \"Can one positany intermediary between the Ineffable and what can be expressedin language?\" (C-W I, 62.3) In other words, does Damascius have34 \"A story of the painter Apelles applies to the Sceptics. They say that he was paintinga horse and wanted to represent in his picture the lather on the horse's mouth; buthe was so unsuccessful that he gave up, took the sponge on which he had beenwiping off the colours from his brush, and flung it at the picture. And when it hitthe picture, it produced a representation of the horse's lather\" (I 27, Annas andBarnes translation).213"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismanything at all to say about the nature of reality apart from theIneffable?To look at this question, we must consider once more the thoughtof Proclus. In asking this question about what is intermediary, Da-mascius no doubt alludes to the Procline tendency to multiply levelsof reality in general, as we saw earlier \"the processions of real being,far more even than the positions of physical bodies in space, leaveno vacuum, but everywhere there are mean terms between extremi-ties, which provide for them a mutual linkage\" (De Prov. IV, 20).Damascius especially has in mind Proclus' doctrine of the Henads,which function as intermediaries between the One and particularbeings, and between Being/Intellect and that which exists beforeBeing.35 Although they find their place within the cosmos as causalprinciples, coming first in the seirai or taxeis, the orders of Being,that together constitute the vast diversity of all possible forms ofexistence, they are also theoi, gods, and perhaps no less than namesor aspects of the divine principle whose fullness is thus expressed.Although these brief remarks do not provide an adequate accountof the Procline doctrine, it is perhaps enough to contrast the realismof Proclus with the somewhat hesitant nature of Damascius' owndiscussion of the Henads.Ideally, to apprehend reality, the mind should be able to stripitself of all of its determinate notions, all of its concepts or precon-ceptions. According to Damascius, however, such a feat is impossible,since the mind by its very nature invents things. Mind operates byprojecting its own determinate notions onto a reality that surpassesbinary oppositions. In trying to apprehend the One, the mind inevi-tably fails and instead grasps the One under the aspect of the Hen-ads, namely, the One-Many, the Many-One, and the Unified. That is,the mind must contemplate the One as all things, or else it mustcontemplate all things as dependent upon the One, or else it mustcontemplate the expansion of the One into all things. Each of theseways of looking at the One is a kind of projection that the mindconjures up as it grapples with intractable metaphysical problems. Itwould be better to admit that when the mind unifies itself, it tendsto apprehend unity, whereas when the mind pays attention to anumber of objects, then it tends to apprehend multiplicity:35 Cf.

But if we conceive it as all things simultaneously, we destroy itsunity and simplicity. The cause of this is that we ourselves are divided andwe distractedly consider its characteristics as if they were separate. (C-W I,80.19-81.2)Damascius does not say that the Henads are unreal, but he doescaution that the basis of any attempt to know reality must be theIneffable; anything that falls outside of this principle is, in a certainrespect, illusory. Throughout his discussion of the Henads, he sug-gests that these are really methods of contemplating the first princi-ple, necessary, perhaps, as stages of approach, but ultimately not tobe reified as absolutes: \"What I was just now attempting to explain,is that the division of these multiple acts of gnosis must be con-tracted into a complete gnosis of the complete one that is the simpleunity of plural henads\" (C-W 1.66). Damascius elaborates thismethod of first using the Henads as a way of approaching the unityof the first principle and then detaching from them as a greater,more expansive form of contemplation liberates the mind from itsown activity of grasping:That is how we arrive at being, first by means of each form which weexperience as a separate entity, we meditate on that form as not only withoutparts but also as unified, trying to see all of them in each, if one can put itthis way. And then we take them all together, discriminated as they are, butremove their circumferences, just as if we were making many streams intoone pond that has no boundaries, except that we do not meditate on it asunified from all forms as we do the one body of water, but rather as beforethem all, as one the form of the water before the actually divided bodies ofwater. That is how we concentrate ourselves in the One, first by gatheringtogether [multiplicity] and then by detaching ourselves from that which isgathered, into that One, which transcends their multiplicity. (C-W I, 82.19-82.6)This habit of grasping aspects of reality and absolutizing them is thegreatest obstacle to the student: \"This is the cause of all of ourproblems, that our thoughts run off into complete separation if wehear the name 'other,' and muddle things together if we hear thename, 'identity.' \" From Proclus' solemn enumeration of reality'svarious stations, Damascius turns his attention to the knower, look-ing at how the knower's own conditioning intrudes and insinuates215"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismitself into the total occasion, so to speak, of what is being known.36There is a subtle difficulty in assessing the extent to which Damasciuscan be said to uphold the reality of the Henads. Often his languagesuggests that outside of the Ineffable, illusion reigns; all that is belowthe One is somehow superimposed on the One.In this sense, the Ineffable designates that which, even withinhuman beings, remains unbounded by the projections that consti-tute our ordinary notion of reality. Damascius asks: \"Is it the casethat nothing of the ineffable encroaches upon the things here?\" Heanswers, \"As many things as constitute the multiplicity in a dividedmode, the One is all of these things before its division . . . The Onedissolves all things by means of its own simplicity and it is All thingsbefore [they are] all things\" (C-W I, 24.11). At the level of ordinaryobjects, Damascius transmutes the ineffability of the absolute into apuzzle about the status of individuation: picking out an object in theworld as a particular entity involves absolutizing some one determi-nate property, creating a kind of synecdoche that falsely views anygiven individual as isolable from all other individuals, by virtue ofthis characterization.In fact, to use a species name as, for example, \"human being,\" orto use a generic term such as \"living being,\" amounts to a virtualcatachresis: \"The earthly human being is [designated in accordancewith] a particular property from which [the Form] human beingalso gets its name; one could say the same about any other humanattribute, as well as the property of being [the Form] Human Be-ing.\" In using language, we seize upon differences in such a way asto absolutize the bearer of a different predicate, or we are tricked bya common name into assuming an ontological unity. Perhaps no-where is this cautionary attitude or wariness of illusion more pro-36 Damascius' apparent dismantling of the fundamental structures of Neoplatonicmetaphysics through sustained criticism of such tenets as causation, emanation,intellection, and reversion is matched by his equally critical stance toward theontological orientation of Neoplatonism as a whole. Hence although Damascius isnot a subjectivist or strong anti-realist (he does not think that the ontology of suchprinciples as the Henads, the intellect, and so forth is the result of psychic projec-tion), he does at times distance himself from an ontological approach. This distanceresults from his concern to reorient the philosophy of Neoplatonism away from thebaroque scholasticism that begins to preponderate in the Athenian school.2l6"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable Discoursenounced than in Damascius' critique of Neoplatonic theories ofintellect.IntellectIn what follows, I will be investigating Damascius' critique of theNeoplatonic theory of intellect, as well as his own views on thelimitations of intellect. In this material most of all, Damascius' famil-iarity with Skeptical techniques is pronounced. Quite obviously, thecritique of knowledge forms the basis of Academic Skepticism andlater Pyrrhonism; the undermining of all dogmas is in fact subsidiaryto this project, in the sense that akatalepsia, non-apprehension, isboth a foundational premise of Skepticism as well as a method forachieving its goals. Just as the Skeptics need not provide their owncriterion of truth to successfully demolish the dogmatists' katalepicphantasia,37 Damascius works by showing difficulties inherent in Neo-platonic conceptions of intellect.Damascius' strategy is most interesting; he subverts the identitythesis, according to which intellect is its objects (the Neoplatonistsappropriated the Aristotelian doctrine of isomorphism)38 and in-stead insinuates a correspondence theory of truth into the Neopla-tonist theory: \"we can say, therefore, that knowledge completelyaccords with its object, but it is not its object.\" From a standard Neo-platonic perspective, the position at which Damascius arrives is oneof extreme unorthodoxy. One way of framing Damascius' strategyin terms of the history of philosophy, is to say that he takes ananti-Aristotelian line against Plotinus and Proclus, though of coursehis language is influenced by the epistemological vocabulary of theStoics.39 The Aristotelian doctrine of isomorphism is enunciated at37 Some scholars do accept that Carneades' pithanon functions as such an alternativecriterion, but see Bett 1989 for an opposite viewpoint.38 Cf. £rm<?ads V.3.5.45.39 Here even the standard Neoplatonist account will differ from that of Aristotle. ForPlotinus explicitly denies that the object of thought can act upon the mind or thatthe mind receives the form in the act of intellection. Instead, such receptivity occursonly at the level of doxa, or opinion. Plotinus etymologizes the word b6%a (opinion),from the verb btyoiiai (to receive), in keeping with Aristotelian isomorphism: opin-ion receives, indeed, that is why it is opinion, because it receives something froman object that is substantially different from that which receives it.217"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismDe anima III.8; in thinking, the mind becomes identical with theform of the intelligible object. Aristotle employs a strong analogybetween sense-perception and mental perception, describing ordi-nary thought as a kind of mental receptivity to form.40 Here is therelevant passage from the De anima?1But if thought is like perception, then the mind must be acted upon by thethought object or something else must [happen] which is analogous to this.Therefore, the mind must be impassive, but must be capable of receivingthe form.In the following passage we see that Damascius preserves the strongperception/intellection analogy that Aristotle relies on, but never-theless inserts a modified Stoicizing account, in which the object ofknowledge becomes analogous to the impression, the phantasia,which presumably carries representational features of the world. Da-mascius is careful to disassociate his theory from standard Neopla-tonic accounts of intellection by coining a new term, gnosma, whichis formed by analogy to the word, noema, but presents none of theassociated epistemology of noesis.For sense perception corresponds to the object of sense perception, thefaculty of representation corresponds to the impression, and the same is trueof the faculty of opinion and of discursive reason: the one corresponds tothe object of opinion and the other corresponds to the object of thought. Ingeneral, then, knowledge corresponds to the object of knowledge, to coin anew term for this, and the object of knowledge is that which is capable ofbeing known when it has come to be an object of knowledge for a knower.We can say, therefore, that knowledge completely accords with its object, butit is not its object.Most Neoplatonists agreed with Plotinus that in the case of intel-lectual knowledge, \"it is necessary for the knower to be identical withthe known and for the intellect to be identical with its object\"(V.3.5.22).42 Earlier we found Damascius exceptionally denying theFor a more detailed discussion of the differences between Plotinus' understandingof the identity theory (the doctrine of isomorphism) and Aristotle's notion of theidentity that obtains between the form actualized in the act of perception and theform inherent in the hylopmorphic compound that becomes the object of percep-tion, see chapters 4 and 5. See also Emilsson 1988.De anima, III.4.13-16; 429^3.For the continuation of this doctrine in Proclus ITU 287, 3-5: \"Truth is assimila-tion of the knower to the known.\" Cf. further II 287, 9-11."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable Discourseidentity thesis: \"we can say, therefore, that knowledge completelyaccords with its object, but it is not its object.\" Even when Damascius'arguments apparently recall a Skeptical position, however, they arenot always motivated by Skeptical ends, as will become apparentwhen we compare Damascius with Sextus.In the following text, Sextus Empiricus argues against the possibil-ity of intellectual knowledge by demonstrating the weaknesses inher-ent in a correspondence theory of truth. There is no way to guaran-tee the representational accuracy of one's impressions, since themind is always conditioned by its own experiences.43The intellect does not of itself get in contact with external objects andreceive impressions from them, but it does so by means of the senses; andthe senses do not apprehend the external objects but only their own pathe,if anything. And so the phantasia will be of a sensory pathos, which is notthe same thing as the external object.Nor again can one say that the soul apprehends the external objectsby means of the sensory experiences because the experiences of thesenses are similar to the external objects. \"For from which will theintellect know whether the pathe of the senses are similar to theobjects of sense, when it has not itself met with these external objects. . . Therefore not even on the basis of similarity will the intellect beable to judge these objects in accord with the phantasia.\"44Read alongside of this passage from Sextus Empiricus, Damasciushardly seems to be a Skeptic. After all, Sextus insists that the souldoes not apprehend any external object, but only its own representa-tion of a putative object. Again, the Skeptics will deny that objectscorrespond to our representations of them,45 whereas Damasciusasserts that because intellect conforms to its objects, it is capable ofrevealing those objects. Therefore the mind does truly know, per-43 It is important to keep in mind that Sextus here assimilates all forms of thinking tointellectual knowledge and maintains no distinction between intellectual and otherkinds of mental activity.44 Sextus Empiricus, PH bk. 2, sections 70-72.45 On the Skeptics' distinction between appearances and what appears to us, cf. Annasand Barnes 1985, p. 23: \"To say how things appear is to say how they impress us orhow they strike us, whether or not it is via our perceptual apparatus that theimpression is made. In this sense we regularly contrast how things appear or seemwith how they really are. This contrast lies at the heart of Pyrrhonism and its TenModes.\"219"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismceive, and opine about objects: ' 'knowledge corresponds to the ob-ject of knowledge.\"Nevertheless Damascius criticizes the Neoplatonist theory of intel-lection and specifically the identity thesis that underlies it, in thesame way that the Skeptics criticize Stoic epistemology and the cor-respondence theory that underlies it. Since the Skeptics must showonly that the representational account of perception given by theStoics itself entails that the mind immediately grasps merely phanta-siai and not objects, they can at once insist on the representationalgap that this account leaves open.46 Similarly, Damascius emphasizesthe substantive distinction between the knower and the known toshow that the intellect never encounters its object, being, as it is initself. Moreover, he uses premises supplied by Neoplatonic meta-physics to demonstrate this non-identity of subject and object.In his own words, Damascius wants to show that knowledge is arelationship that must maintain \"the actual distinction between theknower and the known, with no crossing of boundaries\" (R.I.181).The context for his attack on the identity thesis is Proclan meta-physics. Specifically, he exploits Proclus' exposition of the triadicrule of causation (ET 30531) according to which every effect remainsin and returns to its cause.47 Since every immaterial entity (for ex-ample, soul or intellect) has the capacity for self-reversion as well,knowledge is the exemplary instance of epistrophe;48 knowledgeequates with the reversion or return of intellect to its own hypostasis,being. It remains for Damascius to overturn this theory from within,a task most easily accomplished by accepting Proclus' account ofknowledge as reversion: Because it returns to Being and to the affir-mation of Being, knowledge could correctly be called \"a return\" (C-W II.148).Here at last the identity thesis becomes the target. Althoughknowledge entails the reversion of intellect to being, reversion itselfentails the fundamental distinction between that which reverts andthat to which the knower reverts:4946 On the nature of Stoic representations in terms of theories of truth, see Annas1991, Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind (Berkeley).47 Dodds 1963, pp. 217-18. On this topic, see Gersh 1973.48 For this doctrine, see Lloyd 1990, pp. 126—33.49 Although the argument Damascius uses to defeat the identity thesis seems heuristicand even ad hoc (what reason does Damascius offer for his denial that the separa-22O"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable DiscourseNow it is the nature of intellect to return to being and of knowledge to bedirected toward being. Furthermore, every return is of something that hasproceeded and is already separate and therefore in need of return, althoughreturn does not eradicate the separation. Rather that which is separatereturns to that from which it has become distinct just insofar as it remainsdistinct and in exactly the way that it remains distinct. All of this is evidentfrom the name, gnosis. (C-W II. 149)There seem to be three steps in Damascius' refutation of the Neopla-tonic identity thesis. In step one, Damascius accepts Proclus' theoryof intellectual reversion, but, in step two, he concludes that reversionentails the non-identity of the knower (intellect) and the objectknown (or being). Finally, in step three, Damascius applies thisdenial of the identity thesis to Neoplatonic epistemology and con-cludes that the intellect never knows being as it is in itself becausethe intellect can never be strictly identical with being. It is this lastapplication that raises the most interesting questions about Dasmas-cius' own theory of knowledge.As a consequence of his denial of the Neoplatonic identity thesis,Damascius concludes that knowing and being known is a relation-ship that consists in alterity:[Question:] what does it mean to say, \"capable of being known,\" and howdoes this differ from Being? [Answer:] Something is an object of knowledgeinsofar as it exists in relation to another, whereas it is Being by virtue of whatit is in itself. (C-W II. 149)But if the intellect never knows being as it is in itself, must one thenconclude that intellect fails to know being at all, that being is un-knowable? Being is not exactly unknowable, but it is available to theknower only qua object of knowledge:[Objection:] But it is Being that intellect desires. [Answer:] It may desireBeing, but it attains Being as an object of knowledge. Perhaps we should saythat its desire is also of Being insofar as it is known since desires naturallycorrespond to the capacity to attain the objects of desire, and it follows that,for the knower, to attain Being is to attain it insofar as it is known. (C-W11.150)tion of knower and known can be eradicated?), it rests upon a refinement ofProclus' theory of reversion, according to which there are three different modes ordegrees of return: vital, substantial, and cognitive. Damascius wants to rank thedifferent kinds according to the degree of unity achieved by means of the reversion;cognitive reversion, or knowledge, is the least unitive form.221"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in NeoplatonismAgain by analogy to the Skeptics who assert that the intellect knowsonly its own pathe, and never reaches the object itself, Damasciusconcludes that the intellect knows its object qua object known. Inother words, as he puts it, \"intellect knows Being as the appearance(TO (j>ou6u) of Being\" (C-W II. 150). After a lengthy and somewhattendentious argument, Damascius offers his version of the Skepticalthesis we saw operating before in Sextus Empiricus. While the Skep-tics maintain that the mind can know only the phantasia, or impres-sion, Damascius renders this doctrine with the Neoplatonizing coun-terpart, that intellect can grasp only the phanon, or appearance.Obviously, there is a divergence as well as a similarity when wecompare the results of Damascius' critique of knowledge with thatof the Skeptics, especially at the linguistic level of comparison. Fewif any direct linguistic echoes connect Damascius' critique of Neopla-tonist theories of intellect to the Skeptics, though one could arguethat he deliberately modifies the Skeptical endorsement of \"appear-ances only\" by speaking of \"manifestation.\" Like the Skeptics, Da-mascius takes premises from within the dogmatic system he criticizesto undermine a theory of knowledge that is foundational to thatsystem. The position at which he arrives - the unknowability of beingas it is in itself, the separation of intellect and its object, Being, andthe denial of the identity thesis - has, it seems to me, recognizableanalogs in the Skeptics' maintenance of akatalepsia.A further question remains concerning the meaning and resultsof this stance with regard to the intellect, though constraints of spacepermit merely a survey and not a resolution of the issues involved.Some scholars have suggested that one observes an emergent anti-realism or even a subjectivism operating in the philosophy of Damas-cius.50 While this view has been harshly criticized,51 one is still leftwith the need to interpret the often striking formulations encoun-tered in the Peri Archon:Being, insofar as it is in itself alone, is also undifferentiated. But whenintellect, separated off, stands apart from Being and Being becomes nolonger undifferentiated, but rather something differentiated from that which50 Cf. Combes's Introduction to Volume I of C-W. Cf. also Combes 1976.51 Beierwaltes, for example, criticizes in a rather sweeping way the \"Bergsonian\" flavorof certain strands of scholarship concerned with Late Athenian Neoplatonism inhis monograph, Denken desEinen (Frankfurt, 1985).222"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable Discoursehas been differentiated, to this extent the object of knowledge is revealed init. (GWII.152. 5-8)One could say several things in light of this passage without invokingidealism. For example, it is easy to point out that Plotinus hadalready insisted on the differentiated nature of intellectual knowl-edge and on the multiplicity inherent in intellectual apprehension.Again, it becomes increasingly common in the later tradition forNeoplatonists gradually to assimilate non-discursive thinking to dis-cursive thinking, by offering more subtle distinctions in the intelligi-ble world (for example, Proclus distinguishes between noetic andnoeric), and by relying on the doctrine of the Henads to theorizeabout the possibilities of a truly unified consciousness. Finally, how-ever, Damascius' criticisms of the Neoplatonic identity theory mustbe seen within the context of dialectic within the Late Academy. Thiscritique of knowledge initiates a strategy that goes against the grainof Neoplatonic orthodoxy by undermining the dualism fundamentalto the entire metaphysical construction. Platonic metaphysics tradi-tionally relies upon the distinction between appearance and reality,or between being and phenomena. Damascius subverts the centralambition of Neoplatonism: the attainment of knowledge that unitesthe knower with reality.52 He readily concedes that this ambition,which ties the ontological affirmation of the subject into a theory ofknowledge, is the basis for the traditional Neoplatonic conception ofgnosis, going so far as to etymologize this word in accordance withit: \"Another meaning of the word knowledge (gnosis) might be, aproduction (genesis) of Being (ontos) and of essence (ousias), since itis by means of a return to Being that the knower comes to possessBeing or essence.\"In the Neoplatonic tradition, this doctrine motivates the searchfor wisdom, which becomes a rescue mission for the recovery ofreality on the part of an alienated subject whose very status as asubject drives a wedge between himself and being. Finally, this drivetoward unity itself must be the last reliable assurance that our losscan be made up. What is singular about this appetite, according toPlato, is that of all appetites, it cannot be deceived: we can never besatisfied with the appearance of a good, we want what is actuallyOn the soteriological conception of the spiritual circuit, see Lloyd 1992, the chapterentitled \"The Spiritual Circuit.\""},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismgood for us.53 So with the loss of being: we do not want to appear tobe, we want to be. Reality and its appearance are not interchange-able.Damascius seems compelled to redefine the Platonic meaning oferos, hitherto always defined as a drive for truth or being.54 ForDamascius, this quest itself must be seen as a quest for appearances:[Objection:] But it is Being that intellect desires. [Answer:] It may desireBeing, but it attains Being as an object of knowledge. Perhaps we should saythat its desire is also of Being insofar as it is known since desires naturallycorrespond to the capacity to attain the objects of desire, and it follows that,for the knower, to attain Being is to attain it insofar as it is known.In stark contrast to the Neoplatonic identity thesis, for Damascius,knowing and being known consist in alterity:[Question:] what does it mean to say, \"capable of being known,\" and howdoes this differ from Being? [Answer:] Something is an object of knowledgeinsofar as it exists in relation to another, whereas it is Being by virtue of whatit is in itself.Damascius' point is not that all is illusion or that reality subsides intomere appearances. Nor would he recommend the abandonment ofmetaphysics and the acceptance of a life based on phenomenalpresentations. Rather, his point is that Being in itself should not begrasped as being, or a being, or an object, as something distinct andoutside of a knower substantially different from Being. In truly uni-fied knowledge, Being is not something attained, and hence nodesire for Being can be satisfied. We have already looked at thispassage from Damascius' discussion of the Unified, one of the threeaspects of the noetic triad:There is something intelligible, which you should know in the flower of theintellect.If you turn your own intellect toward it and know it as an object, then youwill not know it...I ask you to know this without strain; turn back the sacred eye of your souland bring the empty mind into that intelligible, until you comprehend it,since it is outside the intellect.

Enneads III.6.9.224"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable DiscourseAs Damascius comments, in unitive knowledge, the mind does notattempt to assimilate the object to itself. Rather, the mind completelyabandons itself (oupietaa eouTfjv), and itself becomes the object; theobject no longer exists (cog O£K OVTCI \\ir\\be em^rjTOvaa), and hence themind no longer desires to discover it. Here, one can no longer speakof intellect knowing being. Because intellect offers its separate iden-tity to the aspect of the One it contemplates as unity, it is not possibleto posit intellect as an absolutely separate and distinct hypostasis. Inquoting the phrase \"outside the intellect\" from the Chaldean Ora-cles, Damascius suggests that intellect is not separate from the One.This non-dual approach brings the One into all the hypostases with-out thereby collapsing them. Again using metaphorical language,Damascius describes the experience in which intellect disappears:When first we try to see the sun we see it from afar. But as we get closer toit, we actually see it less: finally we don't see it or anything else, since wehave ourselves become the light. There is no more eye of enlightenment.(C-W I.84)Everything short of the absolute is a manifestation of that principle;when Damascius limits intellect's knowledge to the appearance ofbeing, he suggests that Being still falls short of the goal that erosimplies but that intellect can never discover.ConclusionIn the Peri Archon, Damascius criticizes the foundational premises ofProcline metaphysics in his attempt to renew the contemplative formof his tradition and to guide his school by means of a radically non-dual philosophy. Perhaps it will be helpful to summarize the sub-stance of his criticisms by glancing at those propositions in the Ele-ments of Theology direcdy abrogated in the Doubts and SolutionsConcerning First Principles. Damascius criticizes Propositions 7, \"Everyproductive cause is superior to that which it produces\"; 11, \"All thatexists proceeds from a single first cause\"; 35, \"Every effect remainsin its cause, proceeds from it, and reverts upon it\"; 75, \"Every causeproperly transcends its resultant,\" and possibly several of the propo-sitions concerning the doctrine of Henads.The self-refuting nature of metaphysical discourse goes some waytoward explaining the apparent heterodoxy of many of Damascius'225"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismstatements, which can accordingly be seen more as metalinguisticthan as metaphysical. When he insists upon the separation of theknower and the known or assimilates the One to the notion oftotality, he knowingly breaches fundamental Neoplatonic principles:for Plotinus the One is by definition transcendent, and so forth. Whyshould Damascius be able to get away with such arguments, when noNeoplatonist in his right mind would agree to them in the firstplace?Here I think we see a certain forgetfulness on the part of thetradition. Perhaps what happens in the case of Damascius is that thecritique of discursivity that lies at the heart of the tradition must bereperformed and reenacted by means of textual practices. Damas-cius' method of teaching consists in taking away intellectual sup-ports. He often refers to the effect at which he aims as a 'radicalpurification' of our conceptions.55 If his criticisms of intellection orof causality appear to be unorthodox, we should nevertheless refrainfrom accusing him of reducing intellect to the level of discursivethinking or holding the One to be commensurate with ordinaryobjects.Perhaps the most surprising passage in the Doubts and SolutionsConcerning First Principles occurs near the end of the treatise, whereDamascius appears to eschew traditional metaphysics in favor ofrevealed wisdom:We use human language to speak about principles that are divine in thehighest possible degree. We cannot conceive or name them without beingcompelled to use our own ideas about realities that far exceed every mind,life, and being. Even when the Gods instruct some of us concerning these orother matters, they [do not teach] such [thoughts] as the Gods themselveshave. Instead, they use an appropriate language when instructing Egyptians,Syrians, or Greeks . . . and so transmit matters of great import to humanbeings by using a human dialect. (C-W III. 140.11-25)Damascius concludes his first aporia on the nature of the Ineffableby reaffirming that it is neither a cause nor not a cause, neither asource nor not a source, that it is neither one nor many. By reper-forming this critique of discursivity, Damascius achieves his aim inthe quiescence of discursive thinking. The only remaining approachto the One is, he says, \"by keeping quiet, by remaining in the secret55 diakatharis, apokatharein.226"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable Discourserecess of the soul and not leaving it\" (1.15.14). No doubt he did notwrite Doubts and Solutions Concerning First Principles for neophytes orbeginners in philosophy. It is a highly technical and intellectuallydemanding work that assumes familiarity not only with Plato but alsowith the history of Neoplatonism and with various forms of esoterictheology. It is written for those who belong to the tradition butwhose intellectual activity impedes their progress. Finally, it is meantfor those whose doubts are almost insurmountable, who remaindissatisfied with dogmatism and unconvinced by elaborate meta-physical constructions. For such people, the only way to removedoubt is to remove thought altogether. This radical solution mayremind us of the earlier Skeptical epoche of the Hellenistic Academy.And yet, this strong medicine is prescribed for those who, eschewingevery panacea, will only be satisfied with an absolute cure for whatails them. Finally, the sole remedy for ignorance is, in Damascius'words, perseverance in unknowing.Appendix: Damascius on Intellectual Reversion(C-W II, pp. 148-152.8)Context: Damascius has been discussing The Unified, the last henadof the noetic triad that comprises Damascius' second hypostasis. TheUnified is the aspect of this hypostasis that communicates with otherlevels of being; it is the source of further emanation because multi-plicity proceeds from The Unified. In this section, Damascius isultimately considering whether or not The Unified can be known bythe intellect. The portions translated constitute a digression on thenature of knowledge.In the first part of this passage, Damascius defines knowledge as areversion or return to a higher station of being. But if reversionoccurs only at the level of intellect, then there is still a fundamentaldistance between that which reverts (the knower) and that to whichthe knower reverts. In the second part of this passage Damasciuselaborates on the limits of knowledge: knowledge seeks its objectand conforms to it. Yet this quest can only come about because of aseparation between the knower and the known.But gnosis is, as the name makes clear, a thought that is in the process ofcoming to be, and that means intellection. As for intellection (v6T)oig), be-227"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismcause it inclines or reverts to [the fact of something's] Being and to the[affirmation, \"it] is,\" it could justly be called \"a state of return\" (vebecrig).But as it is, using a more elevated diction and achieving euphony by contract-ing [the vowels] into eta, we call it v6r[oi<;. And so too intellect (nous) isnamed from the fact that it returns to Being. Now nous returns both bymeans of substantial and vital reversion but in the third rank and as it weredistantly, by means of gnostic intellection, and because nous is gnostic, andso it returns by means of actuality or in actuality, but neither substantiallynor by means of the vital power. And that is why this kind of intellection issomething that is involved more with becoming, and this is also more appar-ent to us, because it is especially distinct. And that is why the majority ofphilosophers define intellect in terms of [intellectual reversion]. But alsobefore this there is the distinct and delimited hypostasis that exists beforereversion and it was necessary to call this noesis before the gnostic reversionbecause it is first in reaching Being from the state of procession, and fromthis return nous gets its name, and before gnosis it both returns and revertsalready.And perhaps gnosis is the coming to be of Being and of substance. Theknower certainly becomes substantial by means of the return to Being in theact of gnosis, but not in a primary way, but rather in a kind of substantiationthat is nevertheless characterized by becoming. And that is why nous is therealities, as Aristotle too says.Names should fit closely with realities, however ingenious one's terminol-ogy. That nous subsists and that gnosis is projected as the return to Being,and that every return is of something that once proceeded and is nowalready separate and therefore in need of return, and that return does noteliminate separation, but rather it actually leads back that which is separate,insofar as it is separate, into that from which it has divided itself and pro-ceeded, all of this is evident even from the name, gnosis.But what is [the essence] of knowledge? Is it a halo, taking as it were thefirst place in the procession of light that comes about in the knower fromthe object known? Certainly sense perception accords with the perceptualobject, and the representation subsists according to impression, and so withopinion and discursive thought; the latter accords with the object of thought,the former with the object of opinion. In general then knowledge subsistsaccording to the object of knowledge (yv(bo\\ia), if this expression is allowed,and the object of knowledge is that which can be known, but [as it] alreadysubsists in the knower. [Another way to put it is to say that] knowledgeaccords with this object of knowledge but it is not the object of knowledge.Question: What then is the experience of the knower when it does not yetknow? Answer: It seeks out the object of knowledge. Therefore knowledge isthe attainment of the object of knowledge qua object of knowledge. For if infact it attains Being, this is [only] insofar as Being is an object of knowledge.Question: What then is the nature of the object of knowledge and how doesit differ from Being? Answer: [The difference is this:] the object of knowl-edge is related to another, whereas that which is what it is in itself is Being.228"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Damascius' Ineffable DiscoursePerhaps this [way of putting it] indicates what belongs to either of them, butwhat their nature is has not yet been shown. Being is the hypostasis, but theobject of knowledge is as it were the manifestation of the hypostasis. Andone might say that the hypostasis is one thing in the case of the materialform, but quite another in the case of the sensible [particular]. The sensibleaspect falls outside of it and makes it known, making it known until thepoint of sense-perception, and so comes about in way that corresponds tosense-perception. That is also the way that manifestation [is related to]Being, as if it were a light that precedes Being [until it reaches] the knower,running out to meet the knower as the latter ascends. The light is coordinatewith Being and it becomes one with it and it accomplishes and satisfies itsdesire for Being because of the completion of its intrinsic illumination.Question: So then intellect does not know Being, but [only] the manifesta-tion of Being? Answer: [It knows] Being insofar as it is manifest, and it ismanifest in accordance with the object of knowledge. And even if intellectcould know Being, in exactly the way that it knows that which is capable ofbeing known, nevertheless all that is capable of being known would beentirely [present] as an object of knowledge. The result is that intellect doesknow Being, but necessarily, as we say, according to the manifestation [ofBeing]. Question: But it is Being [that Intellect] desires. Answer: It maydesire Being, but it obtains it as an object of knowledge. And perhaps itwould be better to say that its desire is also for Being according to the objectof knowledge. After all, desires and the attainments [of desire] have identicalobjects, and correspondingly for the knower, the attainment of Being isaccording to that which is known. Question: What do we mean by theexpression, \"manifestation?\" Answer: The manifestation borders on the sec-ondary principles and it furnishes itself in proportion to the measure ofthose wishing to enjoy it and to enfold the illumination that precedes it.Question: Is it therefore the case that the whole [of Being] is not knowable,but rather only the illumination, just as the color alone is visible, but not theunderlying substrate? Answer: Yes, emphatically. But this should cause nosurprise, but rather be a necessary consequence, that Being is somethingthat belongs to the first principles but remains always out of the reach of thesecond principles and hence, ineffable. For in this way too that which isentirely out of bounds and ineffable is uniformly related to everything else,and each of the other things is toward its secondaries by itself ineffable andalso becomes ineffable toward something. And this is especially unremark-able, as I said, but one might perhaps wonder whether intellect knows [just]the preceding illumination of Being, and not Being itself, that is, accordingto its manifestation. The Answer is that the manifestation of Being is thename for this prior illumination, [which is] not, however, a kind of emana-tion from it, as the light that surrounds the earth is from the sun. Rather, itis as if someone were to see the sun itself by means of its natural brilliance.Question: Then [intellect] knows only the surface [of Being], since it knowsthe manifestation of Being in the way [that one sees] a color?

And the same thing will result, first, that [knowledge] isnot of Being, but of the manifestation which is other than Being (for in thecase of that which is completely transparent, it is not the body that is visible,but only the color). Next, in the case of something that is completely inde-terminate, will we be able to distinguish manifestation as one thing, andBeing as another, which then is like the substance for its manifestation, ordiffers from it however it in fact does?To this we reply as follows: The Being that is what it is, insofar as it is justBeing, is without distinction.230"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"1OConclusion: Reading NeoplatonismThroughout this book, I have been talking about the \"Neoplatonictradition\" as if this phrase referred to a well-defined phenomenonsuch as a group of philosophers who, in company with each other,formulated a self-consistent set of doctrines.1 Yet it is not just thecomplexity of Neoplatonic scholasticism, particularly its subtle inte-gration of Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and Platonism,2 nor the majorshifts in its philosophical vocabulary, such as the influence of Iambli-chean theurgy precipitated, that makes it so difficult to locate thefactors promoting the continuity of the school. Although the broadoutlines of what we today might call a philosophical system can beseen in many of the philosophers who today fall under this sobri-quet, the fact remains that the Neoplatonists themselves traced theirphilosophical genealogy in strikingly different ways. A time span ofthree centuries makes an unbroken succession of teachers and stu-dents an unlikely way to account for the cohesiveness of the tradi-tion.I have ended this book with the work of Damascius, the lastPlatonic Successor. Despite his official ties to the ancient Platonicschool, his own membership in the tradition is anything but straight-1 As Eric Havelock writes,This word, with the concept it expresses, is taken for granted by all scholarsand specialists. It describes an accepted presence in history. \"Tradition\" canbe used to cover almost anything. The more ready its use, the more excuse itseems to provide for not going any further. Few, if any, ask the question, Whatsort of thing is a \"tradition\"? What is it made of? How does it work?

In the midst of the upheaval, persecution, and ideologicalpressures exerted on him, with a millenium separating him fromclassical Athens, Damascius seemingly had to rediscover or renewthe tradition whose last proponent he became. One very clear ex-ample of Damascius' renewal of tradition can be found in the con-cluding pages of his Doubts and Solutions Concerning First Principles.There Damascius adds a theological appendix, which consists inshort summaries that describe:The traditions that belong to other theologians concerning the intelligiblediacosm; perhaps from these traditions we can experience a still greaterreverence, indeed the greatest possible, for that transcendental union.3Damascius proceeds to report three versions of the Orphic theology,alludes to Eudemus' theological interpretations of Homer, Hesiod,and Pherecydes of Syros, and ends with Eudemus' summaries ofBabylonian,4 Sidonian, and Persian theologies.5 These concludingchapters reveal that Damascius did not think that his philosophy wasor could be restricted to a specific culture; as we saw for Proclus'Platonic Theology, Damascius also presumed that his own work be-longed to a perennial philosophy whose universality he discoveredin the writings of traditions he realized were still more ancient thanPlatonism.Yet his Life of Isidore allows us to gauge the difficulties that besetDamascius, not only because of his affiliations with a minority tra-dition but because of the collusion and intellectual influence pedal-ing that he feared had insinuated themselves among his colleagues.In it, one can read Damascius' terse and caustic account of Hora-pollo, a colleague who lacked a philosophical disposition and de-serted the Platonic camp for the Christians, out of \"sheer greed.\"(ajtA,f|Gwu Tivog emGujiiag) .6 Again, Damascius complains about thephilosopher Ammonius, who, \"being very fond of money and always3 Damascius Peri Archon C-W III. 159, 10-15.4 Damascius' summaries of an ancient Babylonian theogony are by and large inagreement with second millenium B.C.E records such as the Enuma Elish.

It is easy for us to read through the fragments of Damascius'Life of Isidore, replete as it is with the story of the pagan philosopher,Hypatia (later martyred at the hands of an angry Alexandrian mob),or through Proclus' Against Philoponus on the Eternity of the World8 (orindeed through any number of earlier works exhibiting a particularaxe to grind, such as Porphyry's Letter to Anebo), and see that theirformulations have been hammered out on the forge of intractableideological differences. We know, for example, that pagan and Chris-tian cosmologists argued about whether or not the natural motionof any sublunar body could be properly circular, a question posed asan inquiry into natural science but answered from the perspective ofreligious dogmatism. Since in the epoch we are considering, ideolog-ical consciousness pervades philosophical discourse to such a degree,it is all too easy for the modern reader to approach these texts withsuspicion, even to dismiss them as the product of a highly interested,ideologically fraught, community of thinkers. How then are we tounderstand the claim of this same group of thinkers when they insiston the pristine nature of their philosophical tradition because, asthey maintain, that tradition rests on an innate faculty capable ofdiscovering and revealing universal truth?9I think it is important to consider the issue of our relationship to7 Damascius Vitae Isidori, fragment 316 (Epitoma Photiana 292).

As Gada-mer writes in his reflections on the problem of historical distance ininterpretation:We started by saying that a hermeneutical situation is determined by theprejudices that we bring with us. They constitute, then, the horizon of aparticular present, for they represent that beyond which it is impossible tosee. But now it is important to avoid the error of thinking that the horizonof the present consists of a fixed set of opinions and valuations, and that theotherness of the past can be foregrounded from it as from a fixed ground.In fact the horizon of the present is continually in the process of beingformed because we are continually having to test all our prejudices . . .Hence the horizon of the present cannot be formed without the past.10I take it that what Gadamer means is something like the following.The realization that one does not belong to a tradition, that it standsoutside the framework of one's particular historical world, offers theopportunity for a genuine dialogue with that tradition. Encounteringthis other perspective can uncover the prejudices that limit one'sown understanding.

Inthe preface to this book, I suggested that the identity theory of truth,the doctrine that intellect is identical with its objects, is perhaps thefoundation of the philosophical enterprise we know as Neoplato-nism. Without at least a notional confrontation with this theory, thetexts that belong to this tradition are at risk of being completelyopaque or uninteresting to the modern reader, for whom it is possi-bly almost axiomatic that truth is structured like or by language, thattruth at any rate must always already be framed by the discourse thatdefines a certain epoch, and so forth. In the preceding chapters, Ihave tried to show that this doctrine of intellectual, or unitive, know-ing entails precisely that truth is not structured like language and isnot a product of any discourse.

More thanthis, intellectual truth is not available for transmission in any discur-sive form. It is this last point that must now be expanded.Already we have seen that the textual tradition forming our onlyrecord of Neoplatonism is incomplete in crucial ways. This incom-pleteness is not only owing to the frequent reticence evinced byNeoplatonists to transmit their teachings in a written form. If Por-phyry's anecdote is credible, Plotinus himself continued to teachand committed nothing to writing until he was almost the age offifty; instead, he concerned himself with the difficulties presented byindividual students during the course of personal instruction.11 Ac-cording to Longinus, the most esteemed members of the Platonicschool engaged primarily in oral teaching, devoting themselves torefining their students' understanding;12 Plotinus' own teacher, Am-monius, wrote nothing and possibly enjoined his followers to main-tain a similar practice.13 Emphasis on face-to-face teaching and per-sonal transmission from master to student is altogether in keepingwith the Neoplatonic contemplative praxis that purported to culti-vate a wisdom existing outside the parameters of language, as I hopeto show.The anecdotal material clearly documents the intimacy of thestudent-teacher relationship, an intimacy developed often through-out several decades of association.14 Although it would be difficultfor the modern reader to estimate what this meticulousness concern-ing a given student's comprehension of the doctrines entailed, oneconclusion certainty presents itself: the written record of such philo-sophical associations necessarily left a great deal unrecorded. Thisgap in the written representation of Neoplatonic teaching and doc-trine is more or less empirical; it can be alluded to without invokingor entering into postmodern discussions concerning the priority ofLife of Plotinus 4.10—12 (Armstrong's translation): \"In the tenth year of the reign ofGallienus [,] Plotinus was about fifty-nine years old.

Nor again amI interested in rehearsing the \"oral-teachings\" problem in terms ofhow it bears on the esoteric Plato and on the Neoplatonic-Pythagorean tradition that purportedly preserved these teachings.For my purposes, it is enough to notice that personal instruction wasan important element in Neoplatonic teaching methods, as it was inthe earlier Hellenistic schools. What then did such instruction ac-complish, and how does it bear on the problem of Neoplatonictextuality? I turn now to consider some difficulties that must be facedas we encounter what has in fact been expressed in the textualtradition. These difficulties exist by virtue of the insight that thetradition as a whole seeks to communicate and to embody, withwhich language itself is in a certain respect out of alignment.Damascius' student, Simplicius, wrote a Commentary on Aristotle'sCategories, at the beginning of which he discusses the skopos, or prov-ince of Aristotle's treatise: are the ten categories (Y&VT]) that Aristotleenumerates words, realities, or conceptual entities? By sharply delin-eating these approaches, Simplicius underscores a semantic theoryaccording to which \"propositions. . . are complex expressions, andthese are not realities.\"16 Even if the categories are deployed seman-tically (KCX66 [A£VTOI crn^avTtKr] EOTIV f| X6§ic;)17 to refer to actual things,it is best to think of them as conceptual entities (vofpaTa) thatsymbolize, or are images of, genuine substances (oti^PoXov ovoa Tfjgev TOig oiiaiv otiaiac;).18 Concepts are not realities, although the soul'sfall into embodiment and consequent forgetfulness of reality neces-sitate sight, hearing, and speech ((pocmf]), while speech itself consti-tutes the soul's outermost activity.19Turning now to the signifying expressions themselves, accordingto Aristotle, substance is \"what is primarily signified in language,\"15 Cf. White, The Content of the Form.16 Simplicius, CAG VII. Cf. Hoffman 1987a and 1987b.17 Proemium Simplicii in Aristotelis Categorias Commentarium 11,1.18 Proemium Simplicii in Aristotelis Categorias Commentarium 11, 19.19 Proemium Simplicii in Aristotelis Categorias Commentarium. 13, 5.236"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Reading Neoplatonismwhile ''other things are predicated of substance.\"20 Hence the struc-ture of language as conceived throughout this tradition involvesgrammatical subject and object, a conceptual apparatus by means ofwhich a speaker approximates the genuine references of these sig-nifying expressions, and the (at least notional or operative) distinc-tion between the speaker and that to which the speaker makes ref-erence. But this structure, based as it is on a system of distinctionsideally mirrored in the categories deployed by the philosopher oflanguage,21 is entirely unsuitable for expressing certain kinds oftruth, as when that truth does not even vaguely resemble the gram-matical structures that imply the distinction between substance andaccident, between the speaker and what the speaker says.22To make this asymmetry clear, let us consider Plotinus' attemptsto describe the moment at which the soul attains to self-knowledge,the moment when the apprehension that soul is not other than theintellect becomes central to the act of soul's own awareness. In thisrelationship to intellect, the soul comes to apprehend truth, in theNeoplatonic sense according to which intellect is the ground oftruth, since it is only in intellect that real being is known. As Plotinusputs it, \"that is the locus of truth.\"23 He goes on to describe thiskind of awareness as:Truly intelligible, both knower and known, self-apprehended and notdependent on another in order to see, completely self-reliant in the act ofseeing, since what it sees, that it is, and yet it is known by us [sc. the soul] bymeans of that itself, so that for us [the soul], awareness of it comes aboutthrough itself. Or how else would we be able to speak about it? That is itsnature: it can be grasped more clearly by itself, and we can only grasp itthrough it. And so, it is through conceptions of this kind that our own soulis led up to it, that is when our soul establishes itself toward it as an image ofit. {Enneads V .<$.8.40-49)Plotinus touches on this kind of experience more briefly in EnneadsVI, where he is actually discussing the soul's apprehension of theOne in unitive knowing:2420 Proemium Simplicii in Aristotelis Categorias Commentarium 9, 25-27, quoting Aristotle.21 Proemium Simplicii in Aristotelis Categorias Commentarium 9.22 Here I am deeply indebted to Sells's excellent discussion, chapter 1.23 Enneads V.3.8.36: EKEI yap T& dXriBi}.24 For an extremely subtle and penetrating discussion of this passage, see Bussanich1988, pp. 146-7.

(VI.9.3.10-13)In this conclusion, I cannot do justice to the incredible richnessof these descriptions, both of which point to moments in which soul,as the seat of discursive thinking, comes to a realization that leads itoutside the strictures of discursive thought. The first passage beginsfrom the perspective of intellect as the ground of truth, but endswith the soul's experience of self-knowledge, which consists in adisplacement of self-identity. Whatever else may be said about thispassage, it should be apparent that the kind of awareness underdiscussion seemingly defies the grammatical and semantic structuresjust touched on. For it is just at the moment when truth is appre-hended that it ceases to be something that could be articulated inlanguage: the thinker is thinking about something whose realizationdisplaces the very fact of the thinker's being who he thought he was.Moreover, this kind of thinking, though it is an image of the realityunder discussion, consists in the thinker actually becoming thatwhich is being thought. Hence the meaning of the pronoun autosshifts its referent in the very act of the soul's coming to describe itsexperience. Here subject and predicate, noun and verb, shift placeswith what before was an extra-linguistic element, and the conceptualstructure of self-knowledge consists in the displacement of that verystructure, as when Plotinus says that \"it is through conceptions ofthis kind that [the] soul is led up to it.\"Perhaps this last paragraph has been difficult to follow. It wasintended to be. Plotinus suggests that in this kind of thought, genu-ine self-knowledge, language arises afterward as an awkward transla-tion of a truth whose essence is to break free of discursive structures.It is for this reason that the texts that seek to convey or even toinculcate self-knowledge at once fail to accomplish their purpose. Byunderstanding this failure of the text, we can also conversely allaysome of our anxieties about the text. Here, it is not that the textpresents itself as containing an abstract, disembodied world thatintrudes upon the embodied, concrete identity of the reader, threat-ening to elide the latter in a truth that it fails, ultimately, to deliver.Quite the reverse occurs: the text points out that the reader is inpossession of a lexicon that is much too subtle to appear on the238"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Reading Neoplatonismpage. The text submits to the authority of the reader, who, it has justadmitted, is \"completely self-reliant in the act of seeing.\"Objections to this kind of reading are no doubt prolific. In thepreceding text, we encounter through language a self-reflexive mo-ment that disrupts the structure of reflexivity inasmuch as the initiallocus of awareness referred to in the text (the soul) is displaced byanother kind of consciousness: \"it is known by us [sc. the soul] bymeans of that itself, so that for us [the soul], awareness of it comesabout through itself.\" Therefore this text purports to describe some-thing that could only be called pristine awareness, immediacy ofapprehension, or even self-authorizing consciousness. No reasonsare adduced to persuade the reader that this reflexivity, so difficultto capture in language, is any more available outside the text. More-over, the obvious difficulty presents itself that such an experiencewould seem to depend for its communication on its realization inlanguage, on the markers that delineate the subject of discourse.It is worth pausing to consider this objection. As we have seen,the reader of Neoplatonic texts faces several challenges. On the oneside, the texts expound a number of doctrines that in all likelihoodwere also explicated within a course of personal instruction. Ofcourse, this instruction is not fully represented in the texts them-selves, which more often than not seem highly exegetical and con-cerned with other canonical texts. On the other side, the philosoph-ical core of this tradition purports to rely on nous, the faculty ofunitive knowing. This unitive knowledge is, as we have already seen,seemingly at odds with language itself. If it does not strike the readeras futile to suggest that so much is left out of these texts despite theirconstituting our sole means of access to the Neoplatonic tradition, itnevertheless will be helpful to recall what is actually presented in thetexts.Throughout the history of Neoplatonic textuality, it has been ofprimary importance to press language into the service of the Ineffa-ble. At times this effort has meant the manifest invention of fictionsof language, as when the Chaldean Oracles are written in anImperial imitation of Homeric Greek and yet are purported to con-tain the secrets of Babylonian wisdom, or when Orpheus is repre-sented as the preceptor of Pythagoras. At other times, this fictionalaspect of the tradition seems to encroach on historical configura-tions, as, for example, the events reported in hagiographic narra-239"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Text and Tradition in Neoplatonismtives. An effective Neoplatonic hermeneutics would seek to under-stand Neoplatonic writings in terms of an ongoing invention oftradition in the very specific sense that the texts rely on the partici-pation and willingness of the reader to enter into the practice ofinterpretation. Not only to take up the puzzles and enigmas offeredby such fundamental principles as the three primary hypostases, theOne, the Intellect, and the Soul, with the advice of Plotinus in mindto \"make oneself the vision\" or to \"exchange the image for thereality\" but also to ask oneself why these texts still speak to us«despite their difficulty and demands, is to enter into this practice.Thus whatever fictions are perpetrated within the confines of thetext for the purpose of contriving a tradition, this invention is moreaccurately realized in the perpetuation of the tradition through anearnest confrontation with the very puzzles offered by these texts.In this book I have been talking about specific kinds of language -traditional narratives, mathematical symbolism, visionary exercises,divine names, and aporetic discourses - all of which are deployed toentice the reader, like the Dionysus of the fable whom the Titanscaptivated with their mirror, into the drama, or action, of the text.But this central drama implied by many Neoplatonic texts through-out the tradition is the anagoge, the soul's ascent and assimilation toreality, whether that effort is conceived as theurgy, contemplation,or gnosis. Hence philosophy can be articulated in the imperativemode: \"First become godlike\" (Enneads I.6.9.33); \"Retreat to your-self and see\" (Enneads I.6.9.8); \"One must put aside everything elseand abide in this alone and this alone become.. .\"{EnneadsVI.9.9.50). At the other end of the linguistic spectrum, this anagogecan be described in the form of a visionary geography that is also anexegetical device, as when Proclus reads the Phaedrus myth as adescription of mystic ascent: \"Therefore the same method of anagogeis also [used by us], and on account of this the method employed bytheurgy becomes more credible.\"25In the preceding sentence quoted from Proclus, anagoge is a con-cept explicated by an allusion to a myth recounted in one of Plato'sdialogues. This reading backwards into the history of Platonism isagain part of the invention of tradition that is so crucial to Neopla-tonist hermeneutics. But what is even more critical for this herme-25 Proclus Platonic Theology TV, p. 29.3-6 (S-W).240"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Conclusion: Reading Neoplatonismneutics is the ability to read not into the past but into the present.This is where the Neoplatonic conception of symbolism becomesintegral to the act of reading. In following Plotinus' exercises involv-ing the visualization of the luminous sphere or Proclus' geometricimaginations, readers turn aside from the text to notice their ownminds, now illuminated or highlighted under the influence of thetext. Both of these authors use a dialect sanctioned by tradition,whether Pythagorean, Orphic, or Platonic, to present a new meaningto the reader. This meaning to which the symbol points is recoveredthrough an extra-textual effort on the part of the reader or student,although the directions offered by means of the symbol can facilitatethis procedure.In his treatise \"On Well-Being,\" Enneads I.4, Plotinus touchesbriefly on what happens when the mind becomes aware of nous, thefaculty of unitive knowledge. The mind comes to be aware of anactivity that is \"before awareness,\"26 and it does this by \"turningthought back on itself,\"27 an event that comes about quite naturallywhen the mind's productions come to a halt, leaving it finally \"inpeace.\"28 As Plotinus says, the discursive mind is usually active inthought production, but when this kind of activity is brought to arest, the result is that the mind functions like a mirror.29 The discur-sive mind in setting aside its discursive activity becomes transparent.This transparent self-awareness consists in \"perceiving directly, whilepreserving that prior awareness, that intellect and thought are ac-tive.\"30 Thus there is a direct awareness of awareness that coincideswith a freedom from attachment to particular thoughts. This is theobjectless knowing that characterizes intellect. In treatise 1.4, thiskind of practice is said to be accompanied by the cultivation ofdetachment from emotional states, the \"fearlessness in all matters,\"that allows such mental stability to develop.

More than this, thesymbolon is often used as the contemplative object; it is offered as afocal point for sustained, concentrated attention and as a mirror inwhich the mind can reflect back to itself its own ''quiet, radiant,motionlessness.''Therefore it is necessary to admit that the texts cannot stand bythemselves for the tradition, and that the tradition comprises morethan could be contained in a text. The text reminds the reader thatphilosophical understanding is not conceptual but, in a certainsense, practical. Today it has become somewhat fashionable to sug-gest that allusions to practice or askesis can be assimilated to thetext.31 On this approach, such things are no more than the fictionsof a textual enterprise that simply invents its own hermeneuticalcontext. At any rate, if this were so, if contemplative askesis were aphilosophical or linguistic trope, it is legitimate to ask what differ-ence this would make to the text or how one could tell the differ-ence. For the Neoplatonists, all the difference in the world. But if areader does not take any steps beyond the text, the difference willno longer be visible.One could go further in this discussion of the fictionality of tra-dition and suggest that the highest form of Neoplatonic hermeneu-tics might posit philosophy as, in the last result, mere fiction. Afterall, is this not fundamentally the position of Damascius, for whomthe foundational premises of first philosophy, including causal expla-nation and the existence of a first principle, are shown to be thecreations of ignorance? As Damascius succinctly puts the matter:But now it is time to place a seal on our talk about the One, and say that itis not that which we say is nor what we know as simultaneously one and allthings, but rather, what we labor to bring forth from these things (I amspeaking here of gnostic labor), it is That. . . And it is this that the philoso-pher Proems in his Monobibhs calls the Ineffable Axiom (or Principle ofSignlessness) ,3231 On the problems of language and experience in the textual representation ofaskesis, see Katz, Mysticism and Language.32 Damascius, Peri Archon, I, p. 86.10, G-W.Nvv be eK8ivo jcepi TO TOiotiTOU evog ejiLoqppayL^o^ievoL ~keyo\\iev, on 6 \\iev Xeyo\\iev ot)K8OTtv otbe YLYV(*>aKOlxev &S ^v KOtL &5 ftAvTa 6p,oi), 6 de ano TOILJTWV (b&ivofiev ((b&tvayvo)OTiKf|v) WUT6 eon...

This imperative is nothing other than therealization that discursive thinking, far from being able to transmitor convey philosophical truth, can actually present the greatest hin-drance to the apprehension of that truth:Now knowing takes places by means of intuitive seeing, or by means ofsyllogism, or it is just a diluted and obscure sort of vision that sees thingsfrom a distance, as it were, but which nevertheless relies on logical necessity,or else, [knowledge is] simply a specious form of reasoning that doesn't evenhave access from afar, but simply conceives of certain ideas on the basis ofother ideas. By means of such thinking, we habitually recognize the materialorder or privation or in general that which has no reality.33The truth that has been in question throughout this book beginsin self-knowledge, since as Damascius is at pains to remind us, themind's ordinary habit \"conceives of certain ideas on the basis ofother ideas.\" But this habit separates the mind from reality, from itsown being and from genuinely encountering the reality of otherbeings. Hence, in the juxtaposition of traditions that occurs whensomeone today reads the texts of Neoplatonism, it is not enough toconcede that a meaningful hermeneutics comes about if readerssucceed in translating the language of Neoplatonism into a languagethat belongs to them. To read Neoplatonism is not just to interpretthe texts of Neoplatonism, to make them speak again through mean-ings now realized in or appropriated by a textual interpretation. Iquote once more from Gadamer, this time as a caveat:interpretation is not a means through which understanding is achieved;rather, it enters into the content of what is understood . .. The interpreta-tion places the object, as it were, on the scales of words.34This quotation suggests that exegesis is the goal of interpretationand understanding, or that one can equate understanding with exe-gesis. Throughout this book, we have seen that Neoplatonic exegesisitself is only a trope for a kind of understanding that never fullysurfaces in language. What I have been arguing in this book is thatreading Neoplatonism involves precisely the opposite approach: wemust take the object, the text, off the scales of words.33 Damascius Peri Archon I.67, C-W.34 Gadamer 1989, p. 398.243"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"ReferencesPrimary Sources: Ancient AuthorsALCINOUS[Alcinous] 1993.
