Such a philosophical exposition of any body of thought demandsmore than an explanation of what the philosopher says and of the sourcesfrom which he derives his doctrines. It requires, above all, an account of theargumentation, the sequence of reasoning that supports and leads to hispositions. Only by understanding this argumentation can we truly grasp themeaning of the positions themselves.In the case of Dionysius, such an understanding is particularly difficultto achieve because he notoriously eschews argumentation in favor ofproclamatory exposition. (See Ep. VII.1, 1077B–1080A.) But that does notmean that his thought is not open to philosophical interpretation and pre-sentation. It simply means that we must look for its underlying argumenta-tion elsewhere, in the philosophical tradition from which his thought derives.To take a prime example, the central Dionysian doctrine that God is “be-yond being” is not merely a phrase or a theme which has a discoverablehistory in Plato and Neoplatonism, nor is it merely a vague assertion ofdivine transcendence. Rather, within the Neoplatonic context, it is theconclusion of a definite sequence of philosophical reasoning, and only interms of that argumentation can its precise meaning be correctly grasped.The same is true of other characteristic Dionysian themes such as processionand reversion, evil as privation, hierarchy, mystical union, and symbolism.The textual “source” of a given idea in Dionysius may be Proclus, or Plotinus,or some other writer, pagan or Christian; but its real philosophical origin isa certain line of reasoning, and this is what I aim to bring to light.The purpose of this study, therefore, is not to contribute to the extensiveQuellenforschung that has already been undertaken on Dionysius, but rather toelucidate the meaning and grounds of his vision of reality by looking backthrough the philosophical tradition to recover the structures and argumentation1"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"2INTRODUCTIONthat underlie it.2 To expound Dionysius in this way, it is necessary to give notmerely references to his textual sources, but extensive explanations of thethought of earlier philosophers, especially Plotinus and Proclus.3 Hence thisbook is an exposition not only of Dionysius himself but also of central aspectsof Neoplatonic thought in terms of their philosophical foundations.The understanding of Dionysius in philosophical terms has been obfus-cated by a widespread bias against Neoplatonism among Christian theolo-gians, who have produced most of the scholarly work on Dionysius. ToLuther’s well-known and still living condemnation of Dionysius as plusplatonizans quam christianizans,4 Christian defenders of Dionysius too oftenreply, in effect, non platonizans sed christianizans.5 The study of Dionysius byChristian theologians has thus tended to fall into a pattern of accusation andexculpation: some contend that he is fundamentally Neoplatonic and there-fore not truly Christian,6 while others attempt to vindicate his Christianityby showing that he is not really Neoplatonic.7 The prevailing assumption onboth sides is that Neoplatonism is a Bad Thing and is fundamentally incom-patible with authentic Christianity.8 Both sides tend to share a somewhatsimplistic and philosophically unsophisticated conception of Neoplatonism,and, indeed, a somewhat narrow and monolithic view of what counts asauthentic Christianity. Such approaches preclude a genuinely philosophicalunderstanding both of non-Christian Neoplatonism and of Dionysius.In relation to this ongoing controversy, therefore, the subtitle of thisbook is deliberately and doubly provocative. First, by characterizing Dionysius’thought as philosophy, I indicate my intention to approach it as a philosophicalscholar approaches that of Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, or Proclus, asking first andforemost not the theologian’s question of whether it conforms to a predeter-mined notion of what is genuinely Christian, but the philosopher’s question ofwhat it means and how it is justified. Second, by characterizing it as Neoplatonicphilosophy, I intend not to condemn but to celebrate it, regarding Neoplatonismas a profound and well-argued understanding of reality and as the most prom-ising resource to which we may turn in our present intellectual and culturalpredicament.9 Rather than either convicting or acquitting Dionysius ofNeoplatonism, conceived as a capital offense for a Christian theologian, Ipropose to reclaim him as a Neoplatonic philosopher who not merely appro-priates certain terminological or thematic elements from Plotinus and Proclus,but takes up their deep philosophical insights into his own thought.Because the aim of this study is to articulate Dionysius’ understandingof reality in its specifically philosophical dimension, I have for the most partleft aside his discussions of trinitarian doctrine, christology, and liturgy.10 Inpresenting Dionysius purely as a Neoplatonic philosopher, however, I haveno intention of impugning his Christianity. For unlike most of the theolo-gians who have studied Dionysius, I see no fundamental opposition betweenNeoplatonism and Christianity, and hence no need to decide on which sideof this supposed disjunction Dionysius belongs. This position depends in part"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"3INTRODUCTIONon a subtler and to some degree unusual interpretation of Neoplatonism, whichbrings it closer to what are often regarded as uniquely Christian doctrines.Many of the points which are often said to represent Dionysius’ Christiantransformation or rejection of Neoplatonism, such as the immediate creationof all things by God, or God as ecstatic love, can in fact already be found innon-Christian Neoplatonism. The need to justify this reading of Neoplatonismfurther accounts for my extensive discussions of Plotinus and Proclus.This study is structured not as a sequential commentary on the Dionysiancorpus but as a series of closely interconnected essays, aiming to present histhought in its philosophical aspect as a coherent whole. The essays build onone another, in a sequence which, for chapters 1–6, follows the topics ad-dressed in chapters I, IV, V, and VII of On Divine Names. Divine Names Ipresents the principles of divine unnameability and nameability, in terms ofGod’s transcendence of all thought and being and his manifestation in allthings. Divine Names II and III are parenthetical: chapter II is Dionysius’explanation of why he is not doing trinitarian theology in this treatise, andchapter III is a preliminary exhortation to prayer. Chapters IV, V, VI, andVII discuss the divine names Good, Being, Life, and Wisdom, respectively,in order of their universality. However, the account of Life in chapter VIadds little philosophical content to the preceding chapters. After chapterVII, the Divine Names ceases to have an easily discernible philosophicalorder,11 although its discussions of various additional divine names containmany points of philosophical interest. In terms of philosophical structure,therefore, the fundamental chapters of the Divine Names are I, IV, V, andVII, and my essays are arranged in accordance with this sequence. In eachcase, however, I draw not only on the associated section of the Divine Namesbut also on the entire Dionysian corpus, treating it as an integrated wholewhose parts can and should be read in relation to each other.Chapters 1 and 2 correspond in subject-matter to Divine Names I, dis-cussing, in chapter 1, the radical transcendence and unknowability of God,and, in chapter 2, the immanence and manifestation of God in all things.Chapter 3 corresponds to Divine Names IV.1–17, presenting this doc-trine in its dynamic aspect by discussing Dionysius’ account of God asGoodness, Beauty, and Love in terms of the cycle of remaining, procession,and reversion.Chapter 4 corresponds to Divine Names IV.18–35, addressing the prob-lem of evil as it arises from such an understanding of reality.Chapter 5 corresponds to Divine Names V.1–3, discussing the hierar-chical structuring of being in relation to the doctrine of being as theophany.Chapter 6 corresponds to Divine Names VII, discussing the nature andmodes of cognition within such an understanding of being.Chapter 7, finally, presents Dionysius’ philosophy of symbolism as itemerges from this metaphysics and gnoseology, and is linked primarily withCelestial Hierarchy I–II."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"4INTRODUCTIONIn a manner that perhaps deliberately parallels his own doctrine ofdivine names, the author of the Dionysian corpus remains invisible: he lieshidden behind his works and can be known only as he is manifest in them,so that the very name Dionysius inevitably refers to the content of the worksrather than to the author.12 The absence of biographical information aboutthe author encourages a reading of the works in purely philosophical terms,simply as a body of thought. At the same time, perhaps in part because of hispseudonymity, Dionysius has tended to be studied not sine but cum ira et studio,and few expositions of his thought even make a pretense of neutrality.13 Thepresent study is no exception: my own love for Dionysius will be patent through-out. But this love is accompanied by, or rather is one with, an equally greatlove for Plato and Plotinus, and above all for divine philosophy itself."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEBEYOND BEING AND INTELLIGIBILITYIn recent decades there has been a surge of interest in “negative theology,”1of which Dionysius is a leading exponent, and hence many studies of thisfeature of Dionysius’ thought.2 Rarely, however, do such studies attempt topresent the philosophical argumentation that underlies his teachings. Thedoctrine that God or the One, the first principle of reality, lies beyond beingand beyond thought, for Dionysius and his Neoplatonic forebears, is not anungrounded starting point or an article of faith but rather the conclusion ofa rigorous sequence of philosophical reasoning, and only by following thisargumentation can we truly understand the doctrine’s meaning. Neoplatonicand Dionysian “negative theology” and “mysticism” is an aspect of rationalmetaphysics, and must be interpreted and evaluated as such. The aim of thepresent chapter, therefore, is to expose the philosophical grounds and mean-ing of Dionysius’ negative theology by showing how the argument behind itis developed in the Greek philosophical tradition that Dionysius draws onand continues.The foundational principle of Neoplatonic thought is the doctrine thatto be is to be intelligible. The identification of being, t¿ ∫n, that which is,as that which can be apprehended by n¬hsiV, intellection, is the basis notonly for the Platonic and Neoplatonic identification of being as form or idea(eΔdoV, Îd°a), and the associated view that the sensible is less than completelyreal, but also for the Neoplatonic insistence that the One or Good, the sourceof reality, is itself “beyond being.” To arrive at a philosophical understandingof Dionysius’ doctrines of being and of God, therefore, we must begin byexamining the meaning and grounds of this principle, and then see how itsimplications are unfolded in Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophy.The idea of being as intelligible is implicit in Greek philosophy fromthe very beginning. The philosophical enterprise, insofar as it is an endeavorto think reality as one whole, always already presupposes that being as suchis able to be grasped by thought. This presupposition is first made explicit by5"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"6THEOPHANYParmenides: “For you could not know that which is not, for it is impossible,nor express it; for the same thing is for thinking and for being [o®te gΩr œngno√hV t¬ ge m‹ ÷¬n (o¶ gΩr ™nust¬n)/o®te fra ́saiV. T¿ gΩr a¶t¿ noeƒn⁄stin te ka¥ ei’`nai].”3 Parmenides indicates here, first, that thought is alwaysthe apprehension of some being. For whatever is thought is necessarily thoughtas something, i.e. as some being. T¿ m‹ ÷¬n, that which is not, cannot bethought, for to think absolute non-being would be to have no object orcontent for thought, to be not thinking anything, and hence not to bethinking. We may recall here the Thomistic principle, derived at long re-move from this Parmenidean insight: “Being falls first in the conception ofintellect . . . Wherefore being is the proper object of intellect [Primo autem inconceptione intellectus cadit ens . . . Unde ens est proprium objectum intellectus].”4Whatever is thought is thought most basically and generically as some being,which may then be specified by various determinations. Second, Parmenidesin this passage affirms that being extends no further than that which can beapprehended by thought, that there cannot be anything beyond the reach ofthought. It would be incoherent even to postulate an unintelligible being, abeing that cannot be thought, for to do so would already be to think sucha being. Parmenides’ fragment thus brings to light the obvious but vital pointthat to think being, that which is, at all, is already to presuppose its intel-ligibility. To think being is to think it as thinkable. Indeed, it follows notmerely that being and intelligibility are coextensive, as Parmenides plainlyasserts, but that intelligibility is the very meaning of being: by being we canonly mean “what is there for thought,” for since thought cannot extend toanything else, “anything else” is mere empty noise—in short, nothing (t¬ m‹÷¬n). If ‘being,’ “that which is” considered as one whole, has any meaningat all, then it necessarily means “that which is available for thinking,” i.e.that which is intelligible. That which is, then, is (wholly and solely) thatwhich can be apprehended by intellection, and intellection is (wholly andsolely) the apprehension of that which is.Plato’s understanding of being as form or idea (eΔdoV, Îd°a) is a directconsequence of this identification of being and intelligibility. Although inmany ways critical of his awesome father figure Parmenides, Plato whollyadopts the doctrine of t¿ ∫n, that which is, as t¿ noht¬n, that which canbe apprehended by intellect, and makes it the center of his metaphysics (e.g.Phaedrus 247c7–8; Timaeus 27d6–28a3). Consequently, what is real, for Plato,is the “looks” (e≥dh) that sensible things display to the mind, the universalnatures or “whatnesses” that characterize them and can be definitively graspedin thought.5 The forms, and only the forms, are “really real,” precisely be-cause they and only they are altogether intelligible. Form is “what is therefor thought,” and therefore it is t¿ ∫n. Its complete reality consists in itsperfect intelligibility. Conversely, sensible instances, on Plato’s view, are lessthan really real in that they are constituted as multiple appearances of theunitary forms, apprehended not by intellection but by sensation and opinion"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"7BEYOND BEING AND INTELLIGIBILITY(d¬xa), the apprehension of appearance rather than reality (see esp. Republic476a4–7). As appearances or images, sensibles are not mere illusion, or nothing(as Parmenides may have believed), but neither are they being itself, thereality which appears, the universal natures apprehended by intellect. Theyare rather, as Plato says, “in between” “that which altogether is,” i.e. intel-ligible reality, the forms, and “that which altogether is not,” i.e. nothing.The “in between” status of sensibles, qua appearances, and the perfect realityof the forms, are together correlated to the mode in which each is cognized.“That which altogether is [t¿...pantelÍV »n] is altogether knowable, whilethat which in no way is is in no way knowable” (Republic 477a2–3), whereas“if something should appear such as at once to be and not to be, this will liein between that which purely is and that which wholly is not, and neitherknowledge nor ignorance will be about it, but again what appears betweenignorance and knowledge,” i.e. opinion (Republic 478d5–11). Plato’s levels ofbeing are correlated to levels of cognitive apprehension, and this is justbecause being is identified with intelligibility.Contrary to Parmenides, however, Plato regards being, qua intelligible,not as simple but as complex, a multiplicity of interrelated forms. He argues,explicitly in opposition to Parmenides, that “relative non-being,” or differ-ence, must be included in the altogether real. Each form is not any of theother forms, i.e. is different from them, and thus shares in Difference (Sophist255e4–6, 258d7–e3). Difference, no less than identity, is necessary for andconstitutive of being. But this doctrine of being as an internally differenti-ated multiplicity of forms is itself a consequence of the intelligibility ofbeing. As Plato points out, the forms are intelligible only in relation to eachother, by the method of “collection and division,” whereby the less universalforms are identified as differentiated specifications of the more universal, andthe more universal forms are understood as unities overarching and pervad-ing a multiplicity of less universal ones (Phaedrus 265c8–266c1; cf. Sophist253b8–e2). The forms’ differences from and relations to one another arenecessary conditions for their intelligibility. “For through the interweavingof the forms with each other discourse [l¬goV] comes to be for us” (Sophist259e5–6). Thus, it is precisely as intelligible that the altogether real must bea multiplicity of distinct, interwoven forms.Plato’s doctrine of the Good as that which “provides” being is alsogrounded in the identification of being and intelligibility. In his well-knowncriticism of Anaxagoras in the Phaedo, Socrates says that when he first heardAnaxagoras’ claim that “intellect [no£V] is the orderer and cause of allthings . . . it seemed to me in a certain way good that intellect be the causeof all things; and I thought, if it was so, that the ordering intellect orders allthings and establishes each thing in whatever way would be best” (97c1–6).In other words, an explanation of things as conforming to the demands ofintellect necessarily accounts for them in terms of goodness. Socrates goes onto say that in failing to give explanations of this kind, Anaxagoras “made no"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"8THEOPHANYuse of intellect” (Phaedo 98b8–9). Plato here indicates, then, that goodnessis the principle of intellectual understanding and of intelligibility itself. Theintellect by nature demands to see goodness in its object in order to under-stand, to make sense of it. Any thing, event, action, or process can beintellectually understood only in terms of the good which is the ultimate“why” for it. And whatever can be so understood, whatever is intelligible, isso only because and insofar as it is ordered on the basis of goodness.6 Con-sequently, those “physicists” who give merely mechanical accounts of nature“think that, truly, the Good and the Right [t¿ ™gaq¿n ka¥ d°on] do notbind and hold anything together” (Phaedo 99c ). The position presentedhere, then, is that it is indeed the Good that “binds and holds all thingstogether,” precisely because only if this is so can “all things” be understoodby the mind at all.This argumentation underlies Plato’s representation of the Good in theRepublic under the image of the sun. Just as the sun, by providing light,makes it possible for sensible things to be seen and for the eye to see them,so the Good provides that which makes the forms able to be known and theintellect able to know them (Republic 508b12–c2). The Good, in other words,is the enabling source of intelligibility and intellection. “When [the soul] isfixed upon that which truth and being [™l–qeiº te ka¥ t¿ »n] illuminates,it thinks [÷n¬hs°n] and knows and appears to have intellect [no£n]; butwhen [it is fixed] upon that which is mixed with darkness, upon that whichcomes into being and passes away, it opines and is dimmed and changes itsopinions up and down and seems then not to have intellect [no£n o¶k⁄conti]” (Republic 508d4–9). The fundamental meaning of “truth” (™l–-qeia), as Heidegger never tires of pointing out, is “unconcealedness.” Thetruth of the forms is their unconcealedness, their availability or accessibilityto the mind—in short, their intelligibility. And this, Plato says, is providedby the Good. For in the absence of goodness, consciousness, attempting tounderstand reality, is like the eye in the absence of light: it is at a loss, itflounders, it cannot “see” its objects; it “does not have intellect.” Just as therecan be neither visibility nor vision without light, so there can be neitherintelligibility nor intellection without goodness. Consequently, as Plato goeson to say, “That which provides truth to the things known and gives power[i.e. the ability to know] to the knower is the form [Îd °an] of the Good”(Republic 508e1–3). In other words, any and all beings, i.e. the forms, areintelligible only in virtue of the “look of goodness” that they have and display.7But Plato here says that the Good provides to the forms not only™l–qeia, or intelligibility, but also t¿ ∫n, the status of being beings.8 Later,he says that “to the things that are known, not only their being known ispresent by the Good, but also their being and reality is present to them byit” (Republic 508e1–3). This claim can be justified only on the basis of theidentity between being and intelligibility: precisely because the status ofbeing consists in availability to intellectual apprehension, the Good, in pro-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"9BEYOND BEING AND INTELLIGIBILITYviding the latter, constitutes the forms as beings, as that which is. Sinceanything can be intellectually grasped only in virtue of its goodness, theGood is the only possible “why” for being qua intelligible, which is to say forbeing qua being.Plato goes on to say, in what is for Neoplatonism perhaps the singlemost important passage in his works, that “the Good is not reality, but excelsbeyond reality [÷p°keina t›V o¶s√aV] in seniority [presbe√a ̨9] and power”(Republic 508e1–3). Since the Good provides being and intelligibility to theforms, which taken together constitute o¶s√a, reality, the whole of what is,it is itself not merely one of them, a member of that complex whole, but lies“beyond” it. As that by which the forms are intelligible and are beings, theGood is ontologically prior to the forms, and in this sense “older” than being,and makes them to be, in this sense transcending them in power. The preciseontological status of the Good in relation to the forms and to intellect remainsambiguous, since Plato also calls it an “Îd°a” and an object of intellection; butPlato at least recognizes here that being, as the multiplicity of the forms,cannot be ultimate, that it depends for its existence and intelligibility on aprinciple that transcends it, and identifies this principle as the Good.10Plotinus adopts and develops Plato’s understanding of being. FollowingPlato, he identifies being as the unified multiplicity of purely intelligible,eternal forms, and he regards sensible things as not true beings but images orappearances of the forms. But Plotinus, far more explicitly than Plato, identifiesbeing not only as the object but as the content of thought and therefore asThought, or Intellect, itself.11 For (to summarize and paraphrase his argu-ments) if being were external to thought, then the actual content of thought,what thought apprehends, would not be reality itself but some image orimpression of it. Thought, therefore, on this view, could never reach reality(see e.g. V.5.1.20–27; V.5.2.1–9). Rather, as Plotinus argues in a Platonicadaptation of Aristotle’s theory of knowledge, intellection, in that what itapprehends is pure idea, contains its object in itself and hence is what itthinks (see e.g. V.9.5–8). Conversely, being, as form or idea, can be nothingbut the content of thought, and is therefore not other than the intellectwhich thinks it. Intellect and the intelligible meet and are one as intellec-tion. “All together are one, Intellect, intellection, the intelligible [no£V,n¬hsiV, t¿ noht¬n]” (V.3.5.43–44), and “we have here, then, one nature,Intellect, all beings, truth” (V.5.3.1–2). Here Parmenides’ insight reaches itsfulfilment: being and thought are not merely coextensive but identical, be-cause being can be nothing but the content of thought and thought can benothing but the apprehension of being.As intelligible and intelligent, Plotinus argues, being or Intellect isnecessarily complex, internally differentiated, and indeed is constituted asbeing and as Intellect by the differentiation of the forms from one anotherwithin it. For any being can be intelligible, and hence can be a being, onlyif it is determinate, a distinct “this:” “A substance [o¶s√an, reality] must be"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"10THEOPHANYsome one particular thing [t¬de...ti], something, that is, defined and lim-ited” (V.5.6.6–7). But since a being can be determinate or defined only bydistinction, by being “marked off” from other beings, intelligibility, and there-fore being, depends on the differentiation of the beings, or forms, from oneanother. “The objects of thought . . . must have otherness in relation to eachother” (V.1.4.39–40), and “the thinker must apprehend one thing differentfrom another and the object of thought in being thought must containvariety” (V.3.10.40–42; see also V.3.10.30f). Being as a whole, therefore, isintelligible, and so is, only in virtue of the internal differentiation of theforms from one another, and this differentiation is constitutive of beingitself. The differentiation of one being from another is what makes all thingsto be intelligible and so to be.Each form, or being, then, is constituted as a being by its proper de-termination. “This is why they [the contents of Intellect] are substances; forthey are already defined and each has a kind of shape. Being must notfluctuate, so to speak, in the indefinite, but must be fixed by limit andstability; and stability among intelligible things is definition and shape, andit is by these that it receives existence” (V.1.7.23–27). In the absence ofdifferentiation, distinction, and determination, and hence in the absence ofmultiplicity, there is no intelligibility and therefore no being. The doctrinethat being is constituted by determination or differentiation, and that it istherefore necessarily multiple, is a direct consequence of the principle thatto be is to be intelligible.Plotinus’ doctrine that being or Intellect is not the first principle butderives from the One or Good, which itself lies “beyond being,” is a furtherconsequence of the same line of thought. Since every being is intelligible,and hence is, only in virtue of the determination whereby it is what it is, everybeing depends for its existence on that determination. Again, every being musthave unity, must be some one being, in order to be; but being as a whole andeach being within it involves multiplicity of content, without which it wouldnot be intelligible. Therefore, each being can be only in virtue of the unity bywhich it is this one being: “It is by the One that all beings are beings, boththose which are primarily beings and those which are in any sense said to beamong beings. For what could anything be if it was not one?” (VI.9.1.1–3). Inshort, for any being, to be is to be finite and unitary, and hence to be depen-dent on the unifying definition by which it is the one being that it is. Havingdiscovered that being as such must be dependent, Plotinus therefore turns tothe One as the ground or source on which being depends, that by which allbeings are beings. All beings depend on, and in that sense derive or proceedfrom, the One or Good, as the “definer” (V.1.5.8–9)12 or “measure of all things”(VI.8.18.3), which makes all things to be in that it provides the unifyingdetermination whereby each being is itself and so is.13This reasoning offers a very clear and precise explanation of whatPlotinus means by describing the One as “beyond being.” Whatever Plato"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"11BEYOND BEING AND INTELLIGIBILITYmay have intended by this phrase, Plotinus’ interpretation of it is unambigu-ous. Since to be is to be intelligible and therefore finite, any being whatsoeveris dependent on its determination and is thus derivative. Hence, to be is to bederivative. No being, therefore, can be the first principle, and the first principlecannot be any being; for if it were any being it would be finite and hence notfirst but dependent on its determination. Further, it would be one memberwithin the complex totality of all beings, rather than the source of that total-ity. This would mean that it would have various attributes, such as being,intelligibility, unity, and so on, in common with the other beings; and forPlatonic thought, whenever different things share (or “participate in”) a com-mon attribute, that attribute itself, as the one nature by which all the partici-pants are such as they are, is ontologically prior to the participants. If, therefore,the first principle were a member of the totality of beings, it would not be first.The One, therefore, “is not equal to the other units so as to be one of theircompany; otherwise, there will be something in common between it and thosewhich are included in the count with it, and that something in common willbe before the One itself” (V.5.4.14–17). Again, if the One were a member ofthe totality of beings, i.e. were a being, it would be differentiated from theother beings within that totality (see V.5.13.20–24), and so would be determi-nate, finite, and dependent. In short, no common term whatsoever, including‘being,’ can embrace both the One and its products, for the One would thenbe included within the totality and differentiated from others within it. Plotinusthus interprets “beyond being” in a purely negative sense, as meaning, only,that the One is not any being. “This phrase ‘beyond being’ does not mean thatit is a particular thing—for it makes no positive statement about it—and itdoes not say its name, but all it implies is that it is ‘not this’ ” (V.5.6.11–14).And this presupposes the understanding of being as that which is intelligibleand, as intelligible, necessarily determinate:Since the substance which is generated [from the One] is form...theOne must be without form. But if it is without form it is not asubstance; for a substance must be some one particular thing, some-thing, that is, defined and limited; but it is impossible to apprehendthe One as a particular thing: for then it would not be the principle,but only that particular thing which you said it was. But if all thingsare in that which is generated [from the One], which of the thingsin it are you going to say that the One is? Since it is none of them,it can only be said to be beyond them. But these things are beings,and being: so it is ‘beyond being.’ (V.5.6.2–11)Here Plotinus summarizes with exceptional clarity the reasoning behind, andmeaning of, his doctrine that the One is “beyond being.”14Plotinus has sometimes been interpreted to mean by “beyond being”merely “infinite being,” a phrase which he himself could not use because in"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"12THEOPHANYhis inherited philosophical lexicon ‘being’ (∫n) comports finitude.15 But sucha reading misses the point. Not because of an accidental restriction on theusage of the term ‘being,’ but because of the philosophically grounded prin-ciple that to be is to be intelligible, being necessarily entails finitude, so that‘finite being’ is a redundancy and ‘infinite being’ a contradiction in terms. Tobe is to be something, and to be something is to be finite. We must thereforetake Plotinus at his word when he insists that the One is nothing (o¶d°n),not any being, not any thing at all (e.g. VI.9.3.41).16 “That [i.e., the One]is not anything [o® ti], but before each and every thing, and is not a being[o¶d‰ ∫n]; for being has a kind of shape of being, but that has no shape, noteven intelligible shape. For since the nature of the One is generative of allthings it is none of them [o¶d°n.. . a¶tÍn]” (VI.9.3.38–41; cf. III.8.9.55).If Plotinus, very occasionally, uses expressions which suggest that the One insome sense is, this is simply an inevitable impropriety, in that thought andlanguage necessarily treat whatever they treat as a being. In the light ofPlotinus’ more careful and frequent philosophical precisions, such passagesmerely serve to lend support to his position that it is not possible or appro-priate to speak or think the One at all.Thus we come to Plotinus’ apophaticism or “negative theology.” Tothink or refer to the One at all, even as “cause,” as “it,” as “that,” is, inevi-tably, to treat it as a being, for thought and language can deal only withbeings. Hence Plotinus says, “Even to say ‘cause’ is not to predicate some-thing accidental of it, but of us, that we have something from it, while thatis in itself; but neither ought one who speaks precisely say ‘that’ or ‘is’ ”(VI.9.3.49–52). This crucial passage makes clear that when he speaks of theOne as the cause of all things, Plotinus is not attributing being and causalityto the One, but is merely indicating the secondary, derivative status of being.Initially, therefore, all language about the One, like the phrase “beyondbeing,” must be purely negative in meaning. Even the term “One,” Plotinussuggests, “contains only a denial of multiplicity” (V.5.6.26–27). The One,then, is not one in any positive sense, i.e. having the attribute of unity; noris it simple, i.e. having the attribute of simplicity.17But Plotinus’ apophaticism does not consist merely in negative lan-guage, for even such language still represents conceptual definition and in-tellectual apprehension: to say that the One is “not this” is, inescapably, tothink it as something else; to say that it is not multiple or complex is tothink it as unitary or simple. In the end, Plotinus says, we must negate evensuch negative definitions, including the name One itself: “But if the One—name and reality expressed—were to be taken positively it would be lessclear than if we did not give it a name at all; for perhaps this name [One]was given it in order that the seeker, beginning from this which is com-pletely indicative of simplicity, may finally negate this as well” (V.5.6.31–34).18 Genuine apophasis, then, consists not in negations but in the silenceof the mind, rising above thought altogether: “Now if you want to grasp the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"13BEYOND BEING AND INTELLIGIBILITY‘isolated and alone’ you will not think [o¶ no–seiV]” (V.3.13.32–33). Thuswe return once more to the correlation between being and thinking, suchthat all being is the object of some thinking, and hence does not include theOne, and all thinking is the apprehension of some being, and hence does notattain the One.19Dionysius adopts his doctrine of God as “nameless,” “unknowable,” and“beyond being” from the Neoplatonic tradition established by Plotinus, andhis thought can be understood only in that context.20 His “negative theol-ogy” is not fundamentally a theory of theological language but a philosophi-cal position taken over directly from Neoplatonism, although, as in Plotinus,it has implications for language in that words are discursive expressions ofintellection and hence cannot apply to God. Dionysius expressly adopts theParmenidean and Platonic account of being and thought as coterminous, andtherefore locates God beyond both together: “For if all knowledges are ofbeings and have their limit in beings, that which is beyond all being alsotranscends all knowledge” (DN I.4, 593A). Dionysius’ God, like the One ofPlotinus, is transcendent, not in a vague, unspecified sense, but in the veryprecise metaphysical sense that he is not at all included within the whole ofreality, of things that are, as any member of it. If he has no “name,” this isbecause he is not anything at all. God is not merely beyond “human thought”or “finite thought,” as if there were some “other” sort of thought that couldreach him, or as if his incomprehensibility were simply due to a limitationon our part, but is beyond thought as such, because thought is always di-rected to beings, and hence to that which is finite and derivative.21 Whenwe hear that God is beyond being, we inevitably imagine some thing, a“superessentiality,” lying above or outside of being. But this fails to realizethe meaning of “beyond being,” because it still thinks of God as something,some being.22 Rather, we must recognize that for Dionysius, as for Plotinus,God is simply not anything, not “there” at all. If our thought cannot attainto God, this is not because of our weakness but because there is no “there”there, no being, no thing that is God. Understanding Dionysius within theNeoplatonic tradition to which he belongs, we must take him at his wordand not seek to mitigate the force of his negations by interpreting his thoughtin the light of later theories which attempt to allow for “infinite being” andthus break with the fundamental Neoplatonic principle that to be is to beintelligible and therefore to be finite.23Consequently, Dionysius’ so-called negative theology, like that ofPlotinus, is not merely negative, if by that we mean, as is commonly said,that “we cannot say what God is but only what he is not.”24 For negation,no less than affirmation, is still an intellectual activity and as such necessar-ily identifies its object in conceptual terms and so treats it as finite. To say“God is not such-and-such” is to regard God as something, some being,distinguished from other beings by the lack of some feature that they possess,and thus to circumscribe God in thought. To deny any attribute of God is"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"14THEOPHANYstill to treat him as a conceptual object, defined by the possession or priva-tion of various attributes. Hence Dionysius carefully explains, near the be-ginning of the Mystical Theology, that although in ascending to “the cause ofall things” we must, at one stage, deny all attributes of all things to him,nonetheless we must “not think that the negations are opposed to theaffirmations, but much rather that that which is beyond the privations isbeyond every affirmation and negation” (MT I.2, 1000B). Later, having deniedof God all attributes, whether sensible or intelligible, he concludes, “Nor isthere any affirmation or negation whatever of it . . . since the all-perfect andsingle cause of all things is above every affirmation, and the transcendenceof that which is simply freed from all things and beyond the wholes is aboveevery negation” (MT V, 1048B). In the end, then, we cannot say what Godis not any more than we can say what he is, because God neither is nor isnot anything at all—and this, of course, is still to say too much.Similarly, Dionysius is not content to say simply that God is ineffable,unknowable, or incomprehensible. To say “God is ineffable” is to describehim, to ascribe the attribute of ineffability to him, and thus to contradictoneself.25 When we say that God is unknowable or incomprehensible, weinevitably imagine some being that cannot be known, something as it were“out there” beyond the reach of thought. This is inevitable because thoughtalways, necessarily, intends some being. But here again we contradict our-selves, for we are thus thinking that which we are claiming to be beyond thereach of thought. Hence Dionysius uses terms such as •perºgnwston (DNI.4, 592D; MT I.1, 997A) and •perar’r‘–twV (DN I.4, 592D): God is notmerely unknowable but beyond unknowing, not merely ineffable but beyondineffability. And of course, even these are still words, names, conceptualdefinitions, and must be transcended.Ultimately, then, for Dionysius as for Plotinus, negative theology con-sists not in any words or thoughts whatsoever, however negative or superla-tive, but in the absolute silence of the mind. We must “honor the hidden ofthe divinity, beyond intellect and reality, with unsearchable and sacred rev-erence of mind, and ineffable things with a sober silence” (DN I.4, 592D).More precisely, Dionysius says that the union of minds with the “super-divine light” takes place “in the cessation of every intellectual activity [pºshVnoerøV ÷nerge√aV ™p¬pausin]” (DN I.5, 593C) and that “ceasing from ourintellectual activities we throw ourselves into the ray beyond being as far aspossible” (DN I.4, 592CD). Likewise, in the Mystical Theology, he explainsthat we are united with the altogether unknown “in the inactivity of everyknowledge [pºshV gnÔsewV ™nenerghs√a ̨]” (MT I.3, 1001A), and that“entering into the darkness above intellect we find not little speech[braculog√an] but complete non-speech [™log√an] and non-intellection[™nohs√an]” (MT III.1, 1033C). As the repeated references to the cessationor absence of n¬hsiV indicate, this is not mere mystical hyperbole or anattempt to articulate some sublime experience, but rather the strictly philo-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"15BEYOND BEING AND INTELLIGIBILITYsophical consequence of the identification of being and intelligibility: as longas any speaking or thinking is taking place, we are necessarily in the realmof beings, of things that are, and hence are not attaining to God. A “God”who either is or is not anything at all, who could be grasped by thoughtwhether positively or negatively, would not be God but a being, and as suchfinite and created.26 “And if anyone, having seen God, understood what hesaw, he did not see [God] himself, but something of those things of his whichare and are known [tÍn ∫ntwn ka¥ ginwskom°nwn]” (Ep. 5, 1065A). Onlythis Neoplatonic argumentation enables us to grasp the meaning and philo-sophical justification of Dionysius’ extreme “mystical” formulations.We may be inclined to ask whether such a radical treatment of divinetranscendence means that God simply disappears from view altogether, insuch a way that, as has been remarked, “the truth of negative theology isatheism.” But Dionysius’ Neoplatonic negative theology transcends atheismno less than it does theism. To be sure, Dionysius is not a theist, sincetheism, as ordinarily understood, involves the claim that God exists (what-ever qualifications may then be added concerning the “mode” of his exist-ence); and many misunderstandings have arisen from attempts to interpretDionysius and other Neoplatonists theistically and thus not to take with fullseriousness their insistence that the One or God is beyond being and is notanything at all, that no common term whatever can embrace both God andhis products. But neither is Dionysius an atheist, for on his principles it is nomore correct to say “God is not” than to say “God is” (i.e. is a being). Simplyto deny that God exists, to say “God is not” or “There is no God” is still toconsider God as some (putative) being, and then to deny that there is sucha being, as when we say “There is no tenth planet” or “There are no uni-corns.” This still treats God as some distinct conceptual object and so failstruly to intend God at all. Neoplatonic and Dionysian negative theology, onthe other hand, refuses to consider God as anything at all, whether to affirmor to deny the existence of such a thing. Indeed, both “theism” and “athe-ism” are distinctively modern phenomena which cannot properly be readinto Neoplatonism. In the words of Jean-Luc Marion,The distinctive feature of modernity does not at all consist in a nega-tion of God. . . Modernity is characterized in the first place by theannulling of God as a question. . . What then is found set in play in anegation or an affirmation of God? Not God as such, but the com-patibility or incompatibility of an idol called ‘God’ with the totality ofa conceptual system where the being in its being marks theage . . . Theism or atheism bear equally on an idol. They remain en-emies, but brother enemies in a common and insurpassable idolatry.27Theism and atheism are brethren born of modernity, where God is reducedto “the supreme being” and true transcendence is lost. Since, for Dionysius,"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"16THEOPHANYit is as inadequate to deny that God is anything as to affirm that he is anything,we must now turn to Dionysius’ metaphysics of creation in order to see howGod is not merely no thing but “all beings and none of beings” (DN I.6,596C), “all things in all things and nothing in any” (DN VII.3, 872A), hownamelessness coincides with all names and silence with the word."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOBEING AS THEOPHANYDionysius frequently says that although God is not any being, he is the cause(aÎt√a or a≥tion) of all things (e.g. DN I.1, 588b; I.3, 589b; I.7, 596C; MTI.2, 1000B; IV, 1040D; V, 1048B), and as such can be named by all thenames of all beings. “It is cause of all beings, but itself nothing, as transcend-ing all things in a manner beyond being . . . But since . . . it is cause of allbeings, the beneficent providence of the Thearchy is hymned from all theeffects” (DN I.5, 593C–D). Taken at face value, this would seem to violateall that has been said about God’s transcendence. To describe God positivelyas “cause” would be to regard him as a being and ascribe to him the attributeof causality, disregarding Plotinus’ careful explanation that to call the One“cause” indicates only the dependence of beings and does not predicateanything of the One. But Dionysius is by no means so obtuse. When he callsGod “cause” he does not mean this in the modern sense, in which one beingis the cause of other beings, and God as the “first cause” is the “supremebeing.”1 Indeed, the very expression “cause of all things” indicates, as Dionysiussays, that all things are effects, or creatures, and hence that God is not oneof all things. Dionysius’ understanding of God as “cause,” justifying the as-cription of all the names of all things to him, depends on a distinctivelyNeoplatonic sense of causation, and we must therefore once again turn toNeoplatonic philosophy to grasp the meaning of his doctrine.Since, in Neoplatonism, to be is to be intelligible and hence to bedeterminate, the determination of any thing, the totality of features by whichit is what it is, by which it is itself as distinct from anything else, is the causeof being to that thing.2 The causation in question, therefore, is not the“horizontal” causation of one thing by another within the same ontologicalorder, as when we say, for example, that parents are the cause of theiroffspring or an earthquake is the cause of a tidal wave. It is rather the“vertical” causation3 of a lower ontological level by a higher one, as when wesay that the intelligible form Fire (i.e. “fieriness”) is the cause of sensible fires17"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"18THEOPHANYin that it makes them to be what they are, to be fires, and so makes themto be. Plotinus expresses this kind of causation when he contrasts the “effort-less” productive power of intelligible form to the merely ancillary action ofbodies on each other: “[T]he making [of the sensible cosmos by Intellect] isdone without noise or fuss, since that which makes is all real being and form”(V.8.7.24–25) and again, “One might certainly call the powers of fire andthe other bodies great; but it is by mere inexperience of true power that theyare imagined burning and destroying and crushing . . . But these destroy,because they are destroyed, and help to generate because they are generatedthemselves; but the power in the intelligible world has nothing but its beingand its being beautiful” (V.8.9.32–37). The same principle, that formal de-termination is the cause of being to that which it determines, is evident inPlotinus’ account of how all making is in fact contemplation, which, wemust remember, is identical with its intelligible object. “Making, for it [Na-ture, i.e. the lowest level of Soul which makes the sensible cosmos], meansbeing what it is, and its making power is coextensive with what it is. But itis contemplation and object of contemplation, for it is a rational principle[l¬goV]. So by being contemplation and object of contemplation and ratio-nal principle, it makes in so far as it is these things” (III.8.3.18–21). AsPlotinus says later in the same treatise, “all things are a by-product ofcontemplation” (III.8.8.26) in the sense that they depend for their existenceon their formal determination, which, as an intelligible idea, is also an actof thinking.This is true not only of the production of the sensible cosmos by Natureor Soul, but also of the production of Soul by Intellect and of Intellect bythe One. Soul, says Plotinus, is “defined by its parent [to£ genn–santoV]and, so to speak, given a form” (V.1.7.41–42). Throughout Plotinus’ hierar-chy of production, the higher level acts as form or determination relative tothe lower which receives it and is at all only by receiving it. Most fundamen-tally, as we have seen, the One is the “cause” of all things as that by whicheach being is intelligible, is itself, is the one distinct being that it is, and sois. As the universal principle of determination whereby all beings are beings,the One itself has no determination and hence is not anything intelligible,any being:Intellect, having come to be, is manifest as all things themselves.But [the Good] is enthroned upon them, not that it may have abase, but that it may base the form of the first forms, itself formless.And in this way Intellect is to soul a light upon it, as the [Good]to Intellect; and when Intellect also defines and limits [ ̨r√sfi] thesoul it makes it rational by giving it a trace of what it has. ThereforeIntellect is a trace of that [Good]; but since Intellect is form and isin extension and multiplicity, that [Good] is shapeless and formless;for thus it makes form [eÎdopoieƒ]. (VI.7.17.34–41)"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"19BEING AS THEOPHANYWe have already seen that, according to Plotinus, to call the One“cause” means only that being, qua determinate, is dependent. At everylevel, indeed, Plotinian “emanation” or “procession,” the production or cau-sation of a lower level of reality by a higher, is nothing but the dependenceof what is determined on its determination. The “production” of the lowerlevel is not in any way an event or a process; rather, it is simply a descriptionof the dependence of the lower on the higher. As Plotinus says,[T]hose are not right who destroy the image-universe while the intel-ligible abides, and bring it into being as if its maker ever planned tomake it. For they do not want to understand how this kind of makingworks, that as long as that higher reality gives its light, the rest ofthings can never fail: they are there as long as it is there; but it alwayswas and will be. We must use these [temporal] words because we arecompelled to want to signify our meaning. (V.8.12.21–27)The “light,” of course, means the intelligible determination in virtue ofwhich anything is what it is. Still more concisely, Plotinus says, “Of neces-sity, then, all things must exist for ever in ordered dependence upon eachother: those other than the First have come into being in the sense that theyare derived from other, higher principles [genhtΩ d‰ tΩ ¤tera t ̧ par’†llwn eΔnai]. Things that are said to have come into being did not justcome into being . . . but always were and always will be in process of becom-ing” (II.9.3.11–14). As this makes clear, the lower level “comes to be” notin the sense of having an origin, but only in the sense that it is dependenton its superior.The causation in question, therefore, is nothing other than Platonicparticipation: that which is determined, the “effect,” participates in its deter-mination, the “cause,” i.e. has it as its nature or attribute, and thereby iswhat it is. Plato frequently refers to the forms as that “by which” theirinstances are such as they are,4 and, therefore, describes a form as the cause(aÎt√a) which makes its instances such (Phaedo 100b1–7). “It seems to me,if anything else is beautiful besides the Beautiful itself, it is beautiful throughnothing else than that it participates in that Beautiful; and all things I saylikewise . . . Nothing else makes [poieƒ] it beautiful than the presence orcommunion of that Beautiful . . . but that all beautiful things are beautiful bythe Beautiful” (Phaedo 100d4–8). Only by understanding Platonic participa-tion, then, can we understand the relation because cause and effect inNeoplatonism, and therefore the sense in which, for Dionysius, God is thecause of all things.A Platonic form is the intelligible nature, present in many things, bywhich they are such things. As such a nature, it is at once immanent in andtranscendent to the instances that participate in it. It is immanent, in thatit is present in them as the nature or character by which they are such"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"20THEOPHANYinstances; and it is transcendent, in that, as one and the same nature inmany different instances, it is other than and unconditioned by each and allof them.5 Where, among the beautiful things in the world, is Beauty? Every-where and nowhere: everywhere, in that wherever there is a beautiful thing,there is Beauty, as the nature which it has by which it is beautiful; nowhere,in that as one universal intelligible nature it is other than the many beautifulthings and is not confined to any one of them. The form’s transcendence isthus a strict implication of its immanence. The instances depend on the formto be such as they are, while the form, as a unitary intelligible nature capableof appearing in many instances, is independent of them. The instances, so tospeak, owe everything to the form, as that by which they are what they are,while the form, as the nature which, by appearing in them, makes them whatthey are, owes nothing to the instances.Plato indeed interprets participation as the multiple appearing of theone form in many instances: “Each [form] is itself one, but, as they appeareverywhere by communion with actions and bodies and each other, eachappears many” (Republic 476a5–7). The individuated character of a sensiblething, e.g. the beauty of Helen, is a differentiated appearance of the oneform, in this case Beauty itself, and the form itself is in the instance in thatit appears here, and, by so appearing, makes the instance what it is, e.g.beautiful. All that we find in sensible things, then, are images, presentations,or appearances of intelligible forms.6 As appearances, sensible things are notbeings additional to the forms and so do not constitute another “world.”An appearance of a being—e.g., to use a Platonic analogy, a reflection in amirror—is not another being: when a man stands before a mirror makinga reflection, there is still only one man there.7 But to say that sensibles areappearances is not to say that they are illusions, or not real at all. Anappearance of a real thing is not the real thing itself, nor is it another realthing, but neither is it nothing. When we see a reflection, we are not seeingnothing, or suffering a hallucination; nor are we seeing something other thanwhat is being reflected. In seeing the appearance, we are seeing the realthing, as it appears; and yet we are not seeing the real thing itself (as Platowould say, “itself by itself”) at all. An appearance is and is not that whichappears. It is in just this sense that since the forms are that which is, sensibles,as appearances of the forms, both are and are not, or are “in between” beingand non-being (Republic 478d5–11). The different “levels of being” in Platoare in fact different modes in which reality may be given to cognition. Eachform, or being, may be apprehended, by intellect, as it is, as one, as the singleintelligible nature that it is; or it may be apprehended, by sense, as it appears,as many, as the character of this or that instance, differentiated from itsappearances in other instances. The difference between intelligible formsand sensible instances is the difference, not between two kinds of reality, butbetween reality and appearance."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"21BEING AS THEOPHANYPlotinus adopts this understanding of participation, the relation be-tween the determined effect or product and its causal or productive determi-nation, as the appearance of the cause in the effect. He often describes theform that is present in a sensible as an “image” of the form in Intellect (e.g.,V.9.3.36–37; V.9.5.18). This might seem to indicate a distinction betweenthe immanent character and the transcendent form. But he is careful toexplain that this does not mean that the transcendent form is not present inthe sensible, and that this “image” is not another form, but is only thedifferentiated presence or appearance of the transcendent form itself. This isindeed the theme of the whole of Ennead VI.4–5, “On the Presence of Being,One and the Same, Everywhere as a Whole.” Here he explains that the“image” perceived in the sensible is in fact the immediate presence of thetranscendent form: “[T]he things in matter are images, and the Forms holdthe rank of archetypes . . . But now we must speak more precisely and notassume that the Form is spatially separate and then the Idea is reflected inmatter as if in water, but that matter, from every side grasping (and again notgrasping) the Idea, receives from the Form, over the whole of itself, by itsdrawing near to it all that it can receive, with nothing between” (VI.5.8.13–21). It is one and the same form, the “archetype,” that is wholly present inall its instances. But for Plotinus, as for Plato, it appears as many to senseperception, and these differentiated appearances of the form are what Plotinuscalls “images”: “[I]t is not correct to divide that same up into the many, butrather to bring back the divided many to the one, and that one has not cometo these many, but these because they are scattered have given us the appear-ance [d¬xan] that also that has been taken apart” (VI.4.7.4–8). The form ispresent in the sensible in that it appears here in a differentiated mode: “[I]tis not then divided up into parts, but seems [dokeƒ] to be so divided to therecipient” (VI.4.14.13–14). And this apparent division, or differentiation, isdue to sensation’s limited mode of apprehension: “For it is sense-perception,to which we are paying attention when we disbelieve what is now being said,which says that is here and there, but reason says that the ‘here and there’has not come about by its being extended but the whole of what is extendedhas participated in it, while it is not itself spaced out” (VI.4.13.2–6). In otherwords, sensation apprehends a form as it appears, as the character of this orthat particular instance (“here and there”). But what appears and is appre-hended differently in different things is one and the same intelligible form,which is neither confined to one instance nor divided up among many.Plotinus sums this up by saying of the form that “it is all present, butit is not all seen in everything, because of the incapacity of what underliesit. But it is present, numerically identical everywhere” (VI.5.11.30–32). Thus,for Plotinus as for Plato, intelligible being is at once transcendent to andimmanent in the sensible: “There is nothing, therefore, surprising in itsbeing in all things in this way, because it is also in none of them in such a"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"22THEOPHANYway as to belong to them” (VI.4.3.17–19). The entire discussion makes itvery clear that the “image,” the form seen in the sensible particular, is notsomething other than the transcendent, archetypal form in Intellect, but issensation’s lesser, differentiated apprehension of that very form itself. Thehigher level is the “cause” of the lower, then, in the sense that the latter isthe differentiated appearance or presentation of the former to a lesser modeof cognition. The higher “makes” the lower as a reality, by appearing, makesthe appearances of itself.8This is, in turn, the sense in which all beings are caused by the One.Just as all fires are fires by having, or participating in, the intelligible formFire, so, since anything can be only by being one, all beings are beings byhaving, or participating in, the One. “But that which comes after the origin[i.e. Intellect or Being, coming after the One] is, somehow, under the pres-sure of the One,9 all things by its participation in the One [pºnta met°conto£ ¤n]” (V.3.15.25–26; cf. V.5.4.1–4). Here again we can see just why theOne is beyond being: just as the form Fire, as that which is common to all fires,whereby they are fires, is not itself one of the fires, so the One, as that whichis common to all beings, whereby they are beings, is not itself one of thebeings. And just as any form is at once transcendent to and immanent in itsinstances, so the One is at once transcendent to and immanent in all beings:transcendent, in that it is not identified with or confined to any one of them;immanent, in that it is present to all as that by which they are beings:[The One] is there and not there; it is not there because it is notin the grasp of anything, but because it is free from everything it isnot prevented from being anywhere. For if, on the other hand, itwas prevented, it would be limited by some thing else, and . . . Godwould go just so far, and would not be independent but a slave tothe beings which come after him. The things, therefore, which arein something are there where they are; but everything which is notsomewhere has nowhere where it is not. For if it is not here, it isclear that another place contains it, and it is here in something else,so that the ‘not somewhere’ is false. If therefore the ‘not somewhere’is true and the ‘somewhere’ is false . . . it will not be absent fromanything. But if it is not absent from anything and is not anywhere,it is everywhere independent. (V.5.9.13–24)If the One were merely “other” or “separate,” it would be another being, andso would be limited in relation to others. Precisely as transcendent, infinite,beyond being, it must be not separate but present to all beings. And preciselyas present to all beings, it is not any one of them, and so is transcendent.Proclus’ doctrine of causation as participation may seem to be differentfrom that of Plato and Plotinus, because he distinguishes between the “par-ticipated” terms (metec¬mena), i.e. the individuated properties, each of which"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"23BEING AS THEOPHANYbelongs to a particular instance, and the “unparticipated” term (™m°qekton),the universal that is numerically one for all the instances and hence does notbelong to any of them:All that is unparticipated produces from itself the participated . . . Foron the one hand the unparticipated, having the relative status of amonad (as being its own and not another’s, and as transcending theparticipants), generates terms capable of being participated. For . . . itwill give something of itself, whereof the receiver becomes a partici-pant, whilst the given subsists as a participated term.Every participated term, on the other hand, becoming a prop-erty of that by which it is participated, is secondary to that whichis equally present to all and has filled them all from itself. Thatwhich is in one is not in the others; while that which is present toall alike, that it may illuminate all, is not in any one, but is priorto them all. (El. Th., prop. 23)Thus, for instance, there is a difference between the unitary universal formFire (the “unparticipated”) and the fieriness of a particular fire (the “partici-pated”), which is numerically distinct from that of other fires. Participation,conceived by Plato and Plotinus as a two-term relation between the partici-pant and the participated, now becomes a three-term relation among theparticipant, the participated, and the unparticipated. Taken at face value,this would separate transcendence from immanence, for the transcendent cause,the unparticipated, is not present in the instance as its property, and what ispresent in each instance as its property, the participated, is not the unitarytranscendent cause. At the highest level, this distinction takes the form ofProclus’ distinction between the One itself and the “henads” or gods, the manydifferent unities in which beings participate (see e.g. El. Th., prop. 116).Closer examination, however, reveals that Proclus’ meaning is notfundamentally different from that of Plato and Plotinus. For the “participatedterm” is in fact nothing but the differentiated presence of the “unparticipated”cause in the effect. It is distinct only in the sense in which, for Plotinus, the“image” in the sensible is distinct from the “archetype.” In this very propo-sition, Proclus says that the unparticipated term “will give something ofitself” in which the recipient participates, and this “something of itself ” isnone other than the participated term. Thus the unparticipated term is“present [par¬ntoV] to all and has filled them all from itself.” Indeed, it isprecisely in order that the cause may be “present to all alike” that Proclusdistinguishes it from the participated terms, each of which belongs uniquelyto one of the effects. The purpose of the distinction, then, is not to keep theunparticipated term aloof from the participants but to guarantee its uncon-ditioned presence to them all.

These “secondary substances,” the participated terms, then,are the multiple, differentiated presences of the universal cause in the par-ticipating effects.Proclus corrects the seeming separation between transcendence andimmanence in a passage that closely parallels Plotinus’ accounts of the simul-taneous transcendence and immanence of the forms to sensibles and of theOne to being:Every cause which is separate from its effects exists at once every-where and nowhere . . . [W]e mean by ‘cause’ that which fills allthings naturally capable of participating it, which is the source of allsecondary existences and by the fecund outpouring of its irradia-tions is present to them all. But by its mode of being, which has noadmixture of the spatial, and by its transcendent purity it is no-where: for if it is separate from its effects it is enthroned above allalike and resides in no being inferior to itself. If it were merelyeverywhere, . . . it would not exist separately prior to them all. Wereit nowhere without being everywhere . . . it would not be omnipres-ent in that sense in which causes are capable of immanence in theireffects, namely by unstinted self-bestowal. In order that as cause itmay be present in all that can participate it while as a separate andindependent principle it is prior to all the vessels which it fills, itmust be at once everywhere and nowhere.10 (El. Th., prop. 98)The cause is “separate” in the sense that it is not conditioned by its effects,not in the sense that it is not present to or immanent in them. Theunparticipated term, then, is simply a universal determination considered asone and the same, and hence transcendent to its instances; while the par-ticipated terms are the same determination considered as differently presentin each instance.11 Thus we return to the notion of appearance, of the dif-ferent modes in which the same content may be given to cognition.From all of this it follows that the causation we are considering is notthe making of an additional thing, the production of one being by anotherbeing. The effects are not more things, additional to the cause. Rather, sinceall that is found in the effects is the differentiated presence of the cause, theeffects are contained in the cause. Whatever content we find in an appear-ance must be present in the reality which is appearing. As Plotinus says,“The last and lowest things, therefore, are in the last of those before them,and these are in those prior to them, and one thing is in another up to theFirst, which is the Principle. But the Principle, since it has nothing beforeit, has not anything else to be in; but since it has nothing else to be in, andthe other things are in those which come before them, it encompasses"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"25BEING AS THEOPHANY[perie√lhfe] all the other things” (V.5.9.6–10). The One, then, contains initself, or better, is the undifferentiated containment of, all beings. Con-versely, all that is found in the effects, and hence the effects themselves, arenothing but differentiated appearances of the cause.The cause, therefore, is the enfolding or complicatio of the effects, andthe effects are the unfolding or explicatio of the cause,12 its presentation orappearance in differentiated multiplicity. Thus Plotinus remarks, “[S]ince inthings which are generated it is not possible to go upwards but only to godownwards and move further towards multiplicity, the principle of each groupof things is simpler than they are themselves . . . There must therefore be aconcentration [sust›nai] into a real one outside all multiplicity and anysimplicity whatsoever, if it is to be really simple” (V.3.16.6–16). As this“concentration,” the One is not any one thing, but all things without dis-tinction: not all things as a multiplicity, for that is not the One but beingor Intellect,13 but all things “at once,” without the differentiation whichconstitutes them as themselves, as intelligible, and hence as all things, asbeing. “But how is that One the principle of all things? Is it because asprinciple it keeps them in being, making each one of them exist? Yes, andbecause it brought them into existence. But how did it do so? By possessingthem beforehand. But it has been said that in this way it will be a multiplic-ity. But it had them in such a way as not to be distinct: they are distin-guished on the second level, in the rational form [l¬goV]”14 (V.3.15.27–33).As we have seen, distinction, and hence multiplicity, are necessary condi-tions for intelligibility and therefore for being. Precisely as all things withoutdistinction, the One is not any thing, i.e. beyond being. “The One: all thingsand not even one; for it is the principle of all things, not all things, but allthings transcendently [÷ke√nwV]; for in a way they do occur there; or ratherthey are not there yet, but will be” (V.2.1.1–3). The phrase “not yet, but willbe” clearly indicates the absence of the differentiation by which all thingsare all things. To use a Plotinian image (see V.1.11.11–13), we may thinkof all things as the many different points on the circumference of a circle.If we imagine all the points moving toward the center, each along its ownradius, the circle will become progressively smaller. When all the pointsmeet at the center, the circle will “blink out” altogether. That is the One:not any thing, but the undifferentiated containment of all things.Conversely, then, all things are nothing but the “unfolding” of theOne, its presentation in differentiated multiplicity. What constitutes beingsas not the One but as all things, as being, is their differentiation from oneanother. They are beings in that they are distinct from each other andtherefore determinate and intelligible. What distinguishes each being fromthe others is also what distinguishes each being from the One. Each beingis not the One, precisely in that it is differentiated from other beings, isdeterminate, is intelligible, or, in short, in that it is a being. All things areother than the One, but the One is not other than all things, for the One,"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"26THEOPHANYPlotinus says, “has no otherness” (VI.9.8.34). All the otherness is on the sideof being, for the otherness of being from the One consists not in the One’sbeing defined over against being, but in the otherness, within being, of onebeing from another.15As differentiated, finite presentations, all beings are appearances of theOne. In that they are intelligible, they are the One as it is given to andapprehended by Intellect, which is to say not as the One, the undifferenti-ated containment of all things, but as differentiated, i.e. as being. Since tobe is to be intelligible, to be is to be given to thought, to be manifest, to beappearance. The differentiation of beings from one another, in virtue ofwhich they are intelligible and are beings, constitutes them, therefore, asappearances of the One. Thus Plotinus explains that being is established asthe multiplicity of forms, and hence as being, in, by, and as Intellect’s dif-ferentiated apprehension of the One: “Therefore this multiple Intellect, whenit wishes to think that which is beyond [thinks] that itself which is one, butin wishing to attain to it in its simplicity comes out continually apprehend-ing something else made many in itself” (V.3.11.1–4). The content of Intel-lect, which is the whole of being, is the One as it is given, as it appears toand in Intellect, which is necessarily as many. Thus Plotinus says that “beingis a trace of the One” (V.5.5.14; cf. VI.7.17.39), or, equivalently, that Intel-lect is an “expression” (l¬goV) or “image” of the One (V.1.6.45; V.1.7.1).16Just as a Platonic form is one and makes its instances to be such instancesby appearing many, so that the contents of the instances are differentiatedappearances of the form, so the One “makes” all things by appearing multi-ply, so that the entire content of being is the differentiated appearance of theOne in Intellect.When Neoplatonic vertical causation, or “procession,” is understood asthe dependence of the determined on its determination and hence as thedifferentiated appearance of the unitary determination, it becomes clear thatthe production of the effect is not an activity on the part of the cause,distinct from the cause itself. It produces the effect—which, we must remem-ber, means only that the effect depends on it for its identity and hence itsexistence—simply in that it is determination. The determination as such isthe productive activity for that which it determines. The cause does not firstexist as itself and then also appear or unfold itself and in that sense produceits effects. Rather, the cause is nothing but that which is appearing, nothingbut the unity, the enfolding, of the effects. As Plotinus says of Nature,“Making, for it, means being what it is, and its making power is coextensivewith what it is” (III.8.3.18–20). Similarly he says of the forms, “But this, the[intelligible] All, is universal power [d§namiV pøsa]” (V.8.9.25), i.e. theproductive power by which the sensible cosmos has any existence at all. Eachlevel is best understood not as the producer but as the production of itsconsequent, the constitutive power by which the latter is."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"27BEING AS THEOPHANYAt the highest level, this means that the One is not something, somebeing, which both is, or is itself, and also appears and in that sense causesall things, but is rather the causing, the production, or the making of allthings. Thus just after describing the One as “all beings and not even one,”i.e. all things without distinction, Plotinus says, “This, we may say, is the firstact of generation: the One, perfect because it seeks nothing, has nothing,and needs nothing, overflows, as it were, and its superabundance makes another” (V.2.1.8–10). This can only mean, not that the One is a being which“overflows,” which would contradict Plotinus’ entire metaphysics, but thatthe One is Overflow itself, the differentiating or appearing by which allbeings are. Plotinus frequently expresses this by referring to the One as notany thing but “the power of all things” (III.8.10.1; V.1.7.10; V.3.15.33;V.4.1.36; V.4.2.39; VI.7.32.31), i.e. nothing but the production of beings,the enabling condition by which they are beings. One of his best images forthis point is his comparison of the One not to an object which gives off lightbut to the ambient light itself whereby things are visible:For even the light of the sun which it has in itself would perhapsescape our sense of sight if a more solid mass did not lie under it.But if someone said that the sun was all light, one might take thisas contributing to the explanation of what we are trying to say; forthe sun will then be light which is in no form belonging to othervisible things . . . This, then, is what the seeing of Intellect is like;this also sees by another light the things illuminated by that firstnature, and sees the light in them; when it turns its attention to thenature of the things illuminated, it sees the light less; but if itabandons the things its sees and looks at the medium by which itsees them, it looks at light and the source of light. But . . . Intellectmust not see this light as external. (V.5.7.13–23)Just as light is not any of the illuminated things but is present to them all asthe condition by which they are visible, so the One is not any of the intelli-gible things, or beings, but is present to all of them, as the condition by whichthey are intelligible and hence are beings. And just as light is involved in everyact of seeing as the condition of visibilility but is not itself an object of sightas the illuminated things are, so the One is involved in every thought as thecondition of intelligibility but is not itself the object of any thought. Thisimage also captures the doctrine of being as the appearance of the One: lightcannot be seen by itself, as pure light, but only as it is defined or rendered“concrete” in a distinct illuminated thing, so that all that is seen in any visiblething is a differentiated, determinate appearance of light itself.Proclus, likewise, insists that there can be no distinction between acause and its causing."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"28THEOPHANYEvery productive cause produces the next and all subsequent prin-ciples while itself remaining steadfast. For if it imitates the One, andif the One brings its consequents into existence without movement,then every productive cause has a like law of production. Now theOne does create without movement. For if it create through move-ment, either the movement is within it, and being moved it willchange from being one and so lose its unity; or if the movement besubsequent to it, this movement will itself be derived from the One,and either we shall have infinite regress or the One will producewithout movement. (El. Th., prop. 26)The One, therefore, is production itself, since otherwise its producing wouldbe a “movement,” and so is any cause in relation to its consequent. “Butevery producer remains as it is, and its consequent proceeds from it withoutchange in its steadfastness . . . Full and complete, then, it brings to existencethe secondary principles without movement and without loss, by itself beingwhat it is” (El. Th., prop. 27). If the cause produces by being what it is, thenits producing is not other than itself and hence the cause is (nothing but)the producing of its effect. Proclus expresses this most clearly when he re-marks that the One’s production of all things is not, properly speaking, anactivity at all:If, then, these entities [i.e., Soul and Intellect] produce by theirexistence alone, far more so does that One which is above themproduce all things by the very fact of being one, not requiring anyother activity to accompany its being one . . . [S]o then it created allthings without employing activity. But if in using these very wordscreated and produced, we use terms proper to activity . . . we applythese terms to the One from the realm of beings, signifying throughterms denoting activity the activity-less manifestation [⁄kfansin]of all things from it.17Here the doctrine of production as manifestation, rather than the making ofadditional things, becomes explicit. For Proclus no less than for Plotinus, allreality, no matter how many levels and triadic subdivisions may be found withinit, is nothing but the unfolding, the differentiated presentation, of the One.We are now in a position to see what Dionysius means when he de-scribes God as not any thing but the cause of all things and hence subjectto no name and to all names. The operative principle is the Neoplatonic lawthat “the things that belong to the effects pre-exist in the causes [pro°nestitΩ tÍn aÎtiatÍn toƒV aÎt√oiV]” (DN II.8, 645D). Since determination is thecause of being to that which it determines, God is the cause of all things inthat he is present to all things as the constitutive determinations by whicheach is itself and so is. God is the “illumination of the illumined and principle"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"29BEING AS THEOPHANYof perfection of the perfected and principle of deification of the deified andsimplicity of the simplified and unity of the unified . . . and, to speak simply,the life of living things and being of beings [tÍn zÔntwn zw‹ ka¥ tÍn∫ntwn o¶s√a]” (DN I.3, 589C ). He is present to all beings as being, theuniversal character common to all beings such that they are beings: God“neither was nor will be nor came to be nor comes to be nor will come tobe; rather, he is not. But he is being to beings [a¶t¬V ÷sti t¿ eΔnai toƒVo‚si]” (DN V.4, 817D ). Likewise he is present to all living things as life,the universal determination by which they are living things as distinct fromnon-living things. But the determining, constitutive divine presence is notlimited to such exalted attributes as being and life, but includes all thefeatures of each thing, which constitute it as that distinct thing, as itself, andhence as a being. “In the cause of all things the paradigms of all beings pre-exist. . . Paradigms . . . are the being-making determinations [o¶siopoio∞V . . .l¬gouV], pre-existing unitarily [...nia√wV] in God, of beings, which theologycalls pre-determinations [proorismo∞V], and good wills, determinative andcreative [™foristikΩ ka¥ poihtikº] of beings, according to which thebeyond-being both predetermined and produced all beings” (DN V.8, 824C).Here these “paradigms” or l¬goi contained without distinction in God, areexplicitly identified as the defining or determining principles which makebeings to be. God is thus present in each being as its determining or definingl¬goV, by which it is itself and so is. All the features of all things, therefore,are God-in-them, making them to be by making them what they are, so thatGod is not only being in beings and life in living things but “all things inall things [tΩ pºnta ÷n pøsi]” (DN I.7, 596C).18This constitutive presence of God in all things is what Dionysius vari-ously calls the “powers,” “participations,” “processions,” “providences,” “mani-festations,” or “distributions”19 of God. All these expressions refer to God’scausal presence in things as their intelligible determinations. “If we havenamed the hiddenness beyond being God, or life, or being, or light, or word[l¬gon], we are thinking [noo£men] nothing other than the powers broughtforth from it to us, which are deifying, or being-making [o¶siopoio∞V], orlife-producing, or wisdom-giving” (DN II.7, 645A). As Dionysius here indi-cates, this is the justification for the naming of God. Since whatever featurewe find in any being is God-in-it, God is truly “named” with all names of allthings. Hence he is not only “nameless” but “many-named” (DN I.6, 596A),bearing all the names of all things.Dionysius’ God, then, like Plato’s forms in relation to their instancesor Plotinus’ One in relation to all things, is at once transcendent and imma-nent. He is transcendent, as we have seen, in that he is not a being at all,not included within reality as any member of it. And he is immanent in thathe is immediately present in all things as all their constitutive determina-tions. As Dionysius says, “the being of all things is the divinity beyond being[t¿ gΩr eΔnai pºntwn ÷st¥n ≠ •p‰r t¿ eΔnai qe¬thV]” (CH I.4, 177D)."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"30THEOPHANYThis seemingly paradoxical formulation is perfectly straightforward in thelight of Neoplatonic metaphysics: God is the being that all beings have, bywhich they are beings, and as such is beyond being in that he is not himselfone of them, one of the things that have being. Dionysius expresses thissimultaneous transcendence and immanence in his account of God as light,reminiscent of Plotinus’ image of the One as ambient light rather than anilluminated being: “The goodness of the Godhead which is beyond all thingsextends from the highest and most venerable substances to the last, and isstill above all, the higher not outstripping its excellence nor the lower goingbeyond its containment, but it both enlightens all that are able, and crafts[dhmiourgeƒ]20 and enlivens and holds together and perfects, and is themeasure of beings” (DN IV.4, 697C).21 As light, God does not stand at thepeak of the hierarchy of beings but transcends and permeates the whole,transcending it in that he is not any member of it, permeating it in that heis present throughout as the illumination, or determination, by which allthings are.Dionysius articulates this transcendence and immanence, adaptingProcline terminology, by saying that the divine processions are “unpartici-patedly participated [™meq°ktwV metec¬mena]” (DN II.5, 644A). This mayseem to make his doctrine different from that of Proclus, in that for Dionysiusit is the unparticipated God himself in whom all things participate, whereasProclus distinguishes the immanent, participated terms from the transcen-dent, unparticipated term.22 But this difference is only apparent, for as wehave seen, Proclus’ participated terms are nothing but the differentiatedpresence of the unitary unparticipated term in the participants. Dionysius’“processions” are participated in that they are the differentiated presence ofGod in all things, but they are participated “unparticipatedly” in that, sincethe same God is differently present in different things, he is not confined to,or in that sense “possessed by,” any of them. Despite differences of expres-sion, the structure of participation, implying at once transcendence andimmanence, remains the same in Plato, Plotinus, Proclus, and Dionysius: oneand the same term is present in many different things, and as what is thesame in all of them (immanent), it is other than and unconditioned by allof them (transcendent).But if all the determinations of all things are the presence of God inthem, then God is not merely “in all things,” as if he were in somethingother than himself. Rather, God is the whole content of reality, “all thingsin all things.” God “is all things as cause of all things, and holding togetherand pre-possessing [sun°cwn ka¥ pro°xwn] in himself all principles, alllimits [sumperºsmata] of all beings” (DN V.8, 824A–B). The various fea-tures, characters, or natures, the determinations (sumperºsmata) found ina thing, constitute the entire intelligible content of that thing, all that thereis in it for the mind to encounter. And since to be is to be intelligible, theyconstitute the whole of the thing itself. A being can be nothing but the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"31BEING AS THEOPHANYtotality of its intelligible determinations, down to the least details by whichit is this particular thing and no other. The divine processions are “in” allthings, then, not as contained in something other than themselves, but asconstituting their entire content. God is the “cause” of all things, and sosubject to all names, therefore, in that the entire intelligible content of allthings, and hence the whole of reality, is nothing but the differentiatedpresence of God.Conversely, therefore, God is not some being other than all things (thevery formula is an absurdity) but is rather the entire content of reality, i.e.all things, without differentiation, without the distinctions from one anotherby which they are all things. Here again we find the Neoplatonic doctrineof complicatio and explicatio, enfolding and unfolding: the cause (here, God)is the undifferentiated containment of the effects, and the effects (here, allthings) are the presentation of the cause in differentiated multiplicity. ThusDionysius says that the “ray beyond being . . . can neither be thought norspoken nor contemplated in any way at all because it is transcendent to allthings and beyond unknowing, and pre-contained in itself [÷n ...autŒproeilhfuƒan] at once [ ̋ma], in a manner beyond being [•perous√wV], allthe limits of all substantial knowledges and powers” (DN I.4, 592D–593A ).23“All the limits of all substantial knowledges and powers” means all the in-telligible contents of reality, the “termini” or objects of knowledge, andDionysius here expressly conjoins their containment in God “at once,” i.e.without distinction, with their containment in him “in a manner beyondbeing” (and also, of course, beyond thought and beyond unknowing). Stillmore plainly, he says that the “cause of all things . . . pre-contained in itselfall beings, simply and indeterminately [pºnta d‰ ªplÍV ka¥ ™perior√stwV÷n ...autŒ tΩ ∫nta proe√lhfe]” (DN I.7. 596C–597A ). Consequently,Dionysius says not merely that God is “in” all things, but that he is “allbeings and none of beings [pºnta tΩ ∫nta ka¥ o¶d‰n tÍn ∫ntwn]” (DNI.6, 596C ), or better, “all things in all things and nothing in any [÷n pøsipºnta ÷st¥ ka¥ ÷n o¶den¥ o¶d‰n]” (DN VII.3, 872A ). Dionysius herefollows the thought of Plotinus, who, as we have seen, says not only that theOne is present in all things, but that it is “all things and not even one”(V.2.1.1). Dionysius’ God is all things in all things in that whatever intel-ligible content is found in any thing, and so the thing itself, is God-in-it, inthe distinct way that is constitutive of that being; and he is nothing in any,in that he is not any one thing, distinguished from others within the wholeof reality and constituted by that distinction. Like the One of Plotinus, heis beyond being just in that he is all things without distinction.If God is the complicatio of all things, all things without distinction,then, for Dionysius as for Plotinus, the differentiation of beings from oneanother is what makes being as a whole, the totality of the things that are,distinct from God. It is this differentiation that constitutes all things as allthings, as being, as that which is, rather than God. But if being is being, or"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"32THEOPHANYis, in virtue of differentiation, then God himself is this very differentiation.Thus Dionysius says that God is named “the Different, since God becomesprovidentially present to all things and all things in all things for the pres-ervation of all” (DN IX.5, 912D). He goes on to say, “Let us consider thedivine difference . . . as his unitary multiplication [t¿n ...niaƒon a¶to£poluplasiasm¿n] and the uniform processions of his multiple-generation[polugon√aV] to all things” (DN IX.5, 913B ).24 This account of God as theproductive differentiation by which beings are distinct, are themselves, andso are beings, recalls Plotinus’ description of the One’s production, which isnot distinct from the One itself, as “overflow,” and his statement that theOne is not merely simple but “beyond any simplicity whatsoever” (V.3.16.15).Still more clearly, it echoes Proclus’ account of production as the cause’s“multiplying itself,” where there is no distinction between the cause and itsproductive self-multiplication, so that the cause is the very differentiationwhereby it is differently present in, and so constitutes, its effects. For allthree philosophers, the One or God is not a “simple monad,” devoid ofdifference and multiplicity but possessing simplicity and unity. As the verydifferentiation whereby beings are beings, he is neither simple nor differen-tiated but “beyond” both, and constitutes at once the unity of being and thedifferences within it: “From this [God as the Good] are all the substantialexistences of beings, the unions, the distinctions, the identities, the differ-ences, the likenesses, the unlikenesses, the communions of opposite things, theunminglings of united things” (DN IV.7, 704B ). The center of the circle, theundifferentiated containment of all things, is not “first” a simple monad which“then” in addition to being itself also produces or undergoes differentiation.Rather, the containment is itself the unfolding, the overflow, multiplication,or differentiation, by which beings are distinct and so are beings.For Dionysius, then, as for Plotinus and Proclus, the whole of reality,all that is, is theophany, the manifestation or appearance of God.25 For theentire content of any being is God present in it in a distinct, finite way, and,in virtue of this distinction and finitude, knowable in that being as its intel-ligible content. It is just as distinct, or finite, that God is present in thebeing, or that the being is a presentation of God. For to be “present” meansto be given or available to thought, i.e. to be intelligible. And as intelligible,as given to thought, God is apparent, or manifest, in and as the being. Tobe present, to be manifest, to be finite, to be distinct, to be intelligible, areultimately all the same, and all are elaborations of the only possible meaningof “to be.” The understanding of being as theophany is thus a strict conse-quence, developed in the Neoplatonic tradition, of the original principlethat to be is to be intelligible.To say that reality is the appearance of God, however, may be mislead-ing, if it is taken to mean that God is, so to speak, “there,” behind or insideall the appearances, an object prior to and apart from them. If God is not anybeing, then what is reality the appearance of? Such a question again attempts"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"33BEING AS THEOPHANYto reduce God to a “what,” a being, an object of thought, violating all thathas been said about divine transcendence and about all being as appearance.When we speak of reality as the appearance of God, we must remember thatsince all reality is theophany, God, as “that which appears,” is not anotherbeing, another member of reality. The doctrine of being as theophany meansnot that God is and is himself, and also appears, but rather that God isnothing but what is differently present, or appears, in and as all things. To passfrom appearance to what is appearing, from being to God, is not to pass fromone thing to another thing. Rather, since God is not another thing but theenfolding of all things, to go from beings to God is to gather the wholediverse content of reality together, and in so doing, since being necessarilyinvolves multiplicity and distinction, to pass beyond being.It may be felt that such doctrines make Dionysius into a mere “monist”or “pantheist.” God, he insists, is not something other than the world but is“all things in all things.” Again, if being is nothing but theophany, does thisnot imply that the world is not real at all, but only appearance? Such objec-tions, however, represent a failure to understand the Neoplatonic metaphys-ics of manifestation and intelligibility. Dionysius’ metaphysics is not a formof “pantheism,” if by this we mean the doctrine that all things are God. Onthe contrary: every being, precisely in that it is a being, i.e. something dis-tinct, finite, and intelligible, ipso facto is not God. Indeed, since to be is tobe intelligible and therefore to be finite, to be means to be not God. This,again, is precisely why God is beyond being. Every being, then, absolutely isnot God. Nor are all things, taken as a totality, God, for “all things” is plural,a multiplicity of distinct intelligible beings.26 The God of Dionysius is “allbeings and none of beings,” “all things in all things and nothing in any,” andin these formulas the “all” can never be separated from the “none.” As allthings without distinction, God is neither any one thing nor all things in theirplurality. All things, qua all things, the whole of reality, are absolutely otherthan God.But if Dionysius is not a monist or pantheist, neither is he a dualist,regarding God as another being over against the world. All things are notGod, but God is not therefore something else besides all things. Such a notion,as the very words indicate, is manifest nonsense. If God were another beingbesides his products, he would be included as a member of a more inclusivetotality, subordinated to a more embracing universal term, and distinct fromthe other members and therefore finite.27 If God were merely other than theworld, he would be another thing and so not truly transcendent, but containedin the world. All things are other than God, but God is not other than allthings.28 Since all things are not God, Dionysius is not a monist; but since Godis not something else besides all things, neither is he a dualist.Dionysius, like his fellow Neoplatonists, is able to negotiate a waybetween monism and dualism by means of the Platonic concept of appear-ance, taken up into the doctrine of being as theophany. The relation between"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"34THEOPHANYan appearance and that of which it is an appearance is not a relation be-tween two beings: the appearance is not another being, additional to thatwhich is appearing. But in that the appearance, qua appearance, is not thatwhich is appearing itself, neither is this a monistic reduction of the appear-ance to what is appearing. As Plato says, with reference to the status ofsensibles as appearances of the forms, they are not being itself, the forms, butneither are they non-being, or nothing. The appearances both are and arenot the reality; they are “in between” being and non-being. So, for Dionysius,beings are not additional things other than God, in such a way that God andthe world would constitute two things. But neither are they nothing, orillusion, as in a monist philosophy. Wherever we look, we are not seeingGod, in that every being, every object of thought, is not God; and whereverwe look, we are seeing God, as he appears, for every being, every object ofthought, is nothing but a presentation or appearance of God.To say that the world is the manifestation or appearance of God, then,is not to say that it is not real.29 Rather, Dionysius’ Neoplatonic point is thatreality itself is appearance: to be real means to be intelligible, to be given tothought, and thus to be appearance.30 To go beyond appearance, in this senseof what is given to thought, is to go beyond being. As Dionysius’ Neoplatonicmetaphysics is neither theism nor atheism, so also it is neither monism nordualism, but can only be called, for want of a better term, “theophanism.”31The relation between appearance and that which appears is irreducible toeither unity or duality and cannot be expressed in any terms other than thoseof appearance, manifestation, image, expression. Only through this Platonicconcept is it possible to understand Dionysius’ metaphysics or to make senseof the relation between the world and God without reducing the world toGod (monism) or God to a being (dualism)."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEGOODNESS, BEAUTY, AND LOVEThe dependence of the determined on its determination, and thus the de-pendence of all beings on God, is understood in Neoplatonism not merely asa static relation, but as a dynamic, though non-temporal, “motion” or “pro-cess.”1 This is the cycle of remaining, procession, and reversion (mon–,pr¬odoV, ÷pistrof–), which is already present in Plotinus’ thought butreceives systematic articulation in Proclus: “Every effect remains in its cause,proceeds from it, and reverts upon it” (El. Th., prop. 35). For Plotinus andProclus, the One is not only the containment of all things and the source(™rc–) from which they come, but also the end (t°loV) toward which theygo. Dionysius adopts this doctrine in its Procline form, and it underlies hisentire account of God as the Good, the Beautiful, and Love in chapter IVof On Divine Names. To understand this cycle in philosophical terms, wemust explain why, in Neoplatonism, the One is also called the Good, for itis this name that best expresses God as at once the ™rc– and the t°loV ofall things.We saw in chapter 1 how Plato argues that goodness is the principleof intelligibility, for anything can be intellectually understood only in virtueof its goodness. To be intelligible, then, is to be good, and the intelligibledetermination or form in each thing, by which that thing is what it is, is thatthing’s way of being good. Consequently, Plato says that the Good provides“truth and being,” i.e. intelligibility and hence the status of being beings, tothe forms, and so is itself “beyond being.” Every form, therefore, is aspecification, a distinct mode, of goodness.Aristotle, too, argues that the formal cause of a thing is one with itsfinal cause, as that which determines its shape, structure, and function, andso accounts for the thing’s being what it is (Physics II.7, 198a26, 198b3; II.8,199a33). For Aristotle as for Plato, finality, or goodness, is the principle ofunity and intelligibility: the end to which a thing is directed endows thething with unity, with identity, with intelligibility, making it to be the one35"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"36THEOPHANYdistinct “what” that it is.2 Hence, for Aristotle, the final cause of any thingis the fundamental ground of its being what it is. The form or “whatness” ina thing, therefore, is its distinct way of being good.3 Thus it is as a final cause,an object of desire, that Aristotle’s God, who is pure form and hence purelygood (see Metaphysics XII.7, 1072b29), is the principle of actualization forthe cosmos as a whole (Metaphysics XII.7, 1072a26, 1072b3).4Following these Platonic and Aristotelian principles, Plotinus arguesthat the form, the constitutive determination of any thing, is that thing’sway of being good. “But shall we then define the good according to eachthing’s excellence? But in this way we shall refer to form and reason-principle[eΔdoV ka¥ l¬gon], certainly a correct manner of proceeding” (VI.7.19.9–12). Each level in Plotinus’ hierarchy of reality, as productive determination,as the principle of order, of unity, of identity to the next level down, is whatis good for its consequent: “Is it then so that the good for the last and lowestamong beings is what lies before it, and there is a continuous ascent whichgives that above a thing to be good for what is below . . . ? . . . For form is thegood for matter . . . and soul for body . . . and virtue for soul. And now, stillhigher, there is intellect, and above this what we call the first nature”(VI.7.25.18–28). In general, Plotinus says that “everywhere what comes as agood is form” (VI.7.28.2). At every level, then, goodness is intelligibility,increasing in intensity as we ascend from body to soul to Intellect (seeVI.7.25.25ff; VI.7.28.20ff.). The goodness in a thing is its distinct way ofbeing intelligible, and so its distinct way of being a being. Thus, as Plotinussays, being as such is “boniform” [™gaqoeid‰V]” (VI.7.16.5), and “each formis good and boniform” (VI.7.18.25–26). Since goodness is the principle ofintelligibility, and to be is to be intelligible, goodness is the universal andconstitutive character of all being.From this point, it is not hard to see why goodness and unity areinterchangeable, why the Good is the same as the One. The goodness in anything is the determining identity which makes that thing the one being thatit is. “For all things, the principle is the end [t°loV ̋pasin ≠ ™rc–]”(III.8.7.17).5 The t°loV, the end, the good of the whole, is what coordinatesor unifies all its multiple content so that it is one being rather than anindefinite multiplicity, and hence is its principle. Conversely, the unity ofany thing, that very integration of all its contents into one whole, is whatrenders the thing good, successful at being what it is. Unity and goodness ina being are the same, as the principle of identity whereby the thing is intel-ligible, is one thing, and so is a being. “The form . . . approaches and com-poses that which is to come into being from many parts into a single orderedwhole; it brings it into a completed unity and makes it one by agreement ofits parts” (I.6.2.18–21). The Good, then, is the same as the One, as theuniversal formative principle by which all beings are beings. As Plotinusexplains, the Good is “not . . . good for itself, but for the others” (VI.7.41.29–30), not a good thing but that by which beings are good, manifest in eachbeing as its goodness, its unity, its intelligibility."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"37GOODNESS, BEAUTY, AND LOVEProclus summarizes this reasoning most clearly:Every good is unitive of what participates in it, and every unificationis good, and the Good is the same as the One.For if it belongs to the Good to conserve all beings . . . and ifwhat conserves and holds together the being of each thing is unity(since by unity each is maintained in being, but by dispersion dis-placed from existence), then the Good renders one and holds to-gether by unification whatever things it is present to.And if it belongs to unity to bring and keep beings together,by its presence it makes each thing complete. And so being unifiedis good for all things.But again, if unification is in itself good, and the good unifies,then the simply Good and the simply One are the same, makingbeings one and so making them good . . .Goodness, then, is unification, and unification goodness; theGood is one, and the One primally good. (El. Th., prop. 13)To be intelligible, to be one, to be good, and hence to be, are all the same.All the varied content of reality, therefore, consists of the many differentmodulations of goodness, of unity; all the different ways in which beings are,are so many different ways of being one and good. Thus we return to theconclusion that all being is the “unfolding” of the Good, and the Good is the“enfolding” of all being.The One or Good, therefore, is the principle of intelligibility, and assuch the ™rc– or source of all things, by being their t°loV or end. ThusPlotinus says, “And the One is on both sides of them; for it is that fromwhich they come and to which they go; for all things originate [†rcetai]from the One and strive towards the One. For in this way they also strivetowards the Good; for nothing whatever among beings could have come toexist or endure in existence if its striving were not directed towards the One”(VI.2.11.25–29). This does not mean merely that the same principle has twodistinct roles, as if the name One indicated it as source and the name Goodindicated it as end. The point, rather, is that the One is the source, endow-ing beings with intelligibility and thus making them to be, precisely as theGood, the end toward which they strive. Conversely, all things strive towardthe Good precisely as their source, that on which they depend in order tobe. “For all things reach out to that [i.e. the One] and long for it by necessityof nature, as if divining . . . that they cannot exist without it” (V.5.12.8–9).Thus both One and Good indicate the first principle as the ground of intel-ligibility and hence of being, at once and identically source and end, ™rc–qua t°loV and t°loV qua ™rc–.The understanding of causal determination as at once ™rc– and t°loVfor the determined effect underlies the Procline cycle of remaining, proces-sion, and reversion. “Remaining” has already been explained: it refers to the"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"38THEOPHANYenfolding or undifferentiated containment of the effects in, or rather as, thecause. Remaining is the identity of the effect with the cause, in the sensethat the content of the effect is nothing but the differentiated presentationof the cause. Procession, in turn, is the unfolding or differentiation wherebythe effects are different from each other and therefore from the cause, andso exist at all as distinct, determinate beings, as effects. “If . . . [the effect]should remain only, without procession, it will be indistinguishable from itscause, and will not be an other which has arisen while the cause remains. Forif it is other, it is distinct and separate . . . In so far, then, as it has an elementof identity with the producer, the product remains in it; in so far as it differsit proceeds from it” (El. Th., prop. 30). For this reason, although Proclususually says that the effect proceeds from the cause, he can also say that thecause proceeds to the effect, and both formulations have the same meaning(e.g. El. Th., props. 21, 25).6 To say that the effect proceeds from the causemeans that it depends on it and in that sense “comes from” it, and thisdependence consists in the effect’s being nothing but a differentiated presen-tation or manifestation of the cause: an appearance “proceeds from” thatwhich appears. Likewise, that which appears goes forth in appearing multiplyand so constitutes its appearances, and in that sense the cause “proceeds to”the effects.Reversion, in turn, signifies the relation of the effect to the cause as itsend, or goodness. Since the causal determination of any thing is its way ofbeing good, it is the end toward which the effect tends, and this tendencyof any thing toward its cause as the good for it is its reversion. “[A]ll thingsdesire the Good, and each attains it through its proximate cause: thereforeeach has appetition of its own cause also” (El. Th., prop. 31). Thus reversion,like procession, can be indifferently ascribed to the cause or to the effect(e.g. El. Th., prop. 144): the effect reverts to the cause, i.e. tends toward it,as its end; and the cause reverts the effect to itself, i.e. moves or “attracts”the effect to itself, as its end. Both formulations describe the ontological“motion” of the effect toward the cause, its acquisition or possession of thedetermination whereby it is good, is itself, and so is.Reversion, therefore, is neither temporally nor even ontologically sub-sequent to procession, as though the effect “first” proceeds from its cause, orcomes to be, and “then” becomes good by reverting to its cause. Since theend that endows a thing with intelligibility is the causal determination bywhich it is, the effect can be at all only in and by acquiring or reverting toits cause. Reversion, no less than procession, is constitutive of the effect, inthat the very existence of anything consists not only in its proceeding frombut also in its reverting to its cause. As Proclus says, “through that by whichthere is being to each thing, through this there is also being good” (El. Th.,prop. 31), because the thing’s being what it is, and so being, consists in itsbeing good. Since there is no real distinction between its being and its beinggood, there is no order of priority and posteriority between procession and"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"39GOODNESS, BEAUTY, AND LOVEreversion, but both at once and equally are the establishment of the effectas a being. Hence Proclus can argue from reversion to procession as well asfrom procession to reversion: “For if [a thing] reverts by nature, it has exis-tential appetition of that upon which it reverts. And if so, its being also iswholly dependent on the principle upon which it reverts existentially . . . Andif so, its procession is from that upon which it reverts” (El. Th., prop. 34).7This makes it clear that the effect’s dependence on its determination is itsreversion to it no less than its procession from it.Since, then, to be, for anything, is to revert to its cause, the propermode of being for each kind of thing is its mode of reversion.Every being reverts either existentially only, or vitally, or alsocognitively. For either it has from its cause existence [t¿ eΔnai]only, or life [t¿ z›n] together with existence, or it has received fromthence a cognitive faculty [gnwstik‹n...d§namin] also. In so far,then, as it only is, it makes an existential reversion; in so far as italso lives, a vital one also; in so far as it has knowledge likewise, acognitive one. For as it proceeds, so it reverts . . . Appetition is insome things, then, according to existence [a¶t¿ t¿ eΔnai] only,which is a fitness for the participation in their causes; in others,according to life [t‹n zw–n], which is a movement towards thehigher; in others, according to knowledge [t‹n gnÍsin], which is aconsciousness of the goodness of their causes. (El. Th., prop. 39)This is, in effect, a Neoplatonic elaboration of the Aristotelian principle,“To be, for a living thing, is to live” (On the Soul II.4, 415b12). Each thingis reverting to its cause simply in being the kind of thing that it is, inexercising the activities proper to it as such a thing. The “merely existential”reversion of an inanimate being, such as a stone, consists simply in its exist-ing as a stone, its being hard, heavy, brittle, and so on. These features areits activities, the characteristic modes of behavior (resisting pressure, tendingdownward, shattering when struck, etc.) that constitute it as a stone ratherthan some other sort of thing. Hence they are its way of being what it is, ofpossessing its constitutive determinations, i.e. of reverting. Likewise, a plant’s“vital” reversion is its living, its exercising the vital functions of growth,nutrition, reproduction, and so on, which are its proper way of being, as aliving thing. And if “to be, for a living thing, is to live,” then to be, for acognitive thing, is to exercise cognition, which is the mode of being, andhence of reversion, for such things. In general, to be a thing of a certainkind, which means to be in a certain way, is to perform the activities properto such things, and this is the thing’s reversion, its possessing of its properdeterminations. Reversion is thus the very being of all things, in the modeproper to and constitutive of each. As Plotinus says, nothing could be at allif it did not tend toward the Good.8"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"40THEOPHANYThe Neoplatonic understanding of the being of a thing as its reversionto its cause means that the “coming to be” of the effect, its being “made” orproduced by the cause, is not merely passive. Its being is indeed received init, which is simply to say that it depends on its causal determination. But thisdependence is an active receptivity on the part of the effect. Reversion rep-resents existing as the activity of a being, of that which is: any being can beonly by actively receiving its identifying determination, which is to say byperforming the act-of-existing in its proper way, by enacting or “living out”its constitutive nature. Hence, the effect, or being, has a positive, active rolein its own production, its being made to be. “Being caused” is an activity ofthe effect. Thus in Plotinus, as we have seen, Intellect constitutes itself asthe multiplicity of intelligible forms, i.e. as the whole of being, in its rever-sion to the One, its looking to the One and taking the One into itself.9“That which is produced reverts to [the One] and is filled, and becomesIntellect by looking towards it. And its rest towards that makes it being, andits gaze upon it, Intellect. Since it rests towards it so that it may see, itbecomes at once Intellect and being” (V.2.1.10–13; cf. VI.7.15.11–23;VI.7.16.13–20). The same is true analogously at every level: the productcomes to be, or is, in and by reverting, taking its prior into itself. So also,Proclus speaks of effects as being “generated by reversion [kat’ ÷pistrof‹n•fistam°nwn]” (El. Th., prop. 37).10 Reversion, in fact, is nothing otherthan participation, the participation of the determined effect in its causaldetermination, considered as an activity of the participant.There is, then, no real distinction between procession and reversion,for both represent nothing but the dependence of the effect on the cause,considered as a dynamic relation productive of the effect.11 Participation, thedifferentiated presentation of the causal determination in the effect, is atonce a giving, a “going forth” of the cause to the effect and of the effect fromthe cause (procession), and a receiving, a “turning back” of the effect to thecause (reversion). The entire cycle of remaining, procession, and reversion,the exitus-reditus pattern that characterizes Neoplatonism, is simply the de-pendence of the determined on its determination, considered dynamically asthe effect’s coming from and going toward that in which it participates andon which it depends in order to be. As Proclus says, “Thus all things proceedin a circuit, from their causes to their causes” (El. Th., prop. 33).This cycle, as articulated by Proclus, underlies Dionysius’ account ofGod as the Good or Goodness,12 Beauty, and Love in chapter IV of OnDivine Names. “It is the Good . . . from which all things originate [•p°sth]13and are, as brought forth from an all-perfect cause; and in which all thingsare held together, as preserved and held fast in an all-powerful foundation;and to which all things are reverted as each to its own proper limit; andwhich all things desire” (DN IV.4, 700AB ).14 Or more summarily, “Everybeing is from the Beautiful and Good and in the Beautiful and Good and isreverted to the Beautiful and Good” (DN IV.10, 705D ). We have already"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"41GOODNESS, BEAUTY, AND LOVEseen how, for Dionysius, all things are contained in and proceed from God,in that all the determinations, and hence the whole content, of all things arethe constitutive presence of God in them. Having laid out the Neoplatonicdoctrine of the One as the Good, we are now in a position to understandthese determinations of beings as their goodness, by possessing which theyare. Thus Dionysius explains at length that all beings, from angelic intelli-gences down to inanimate things, have their proper perfections or activitiesfrom and through the Good (DN IV.2, 696B–D), and then summarizes thisby saying that the Good “gives form to the formless [t¿ ™ne√deon eÎdopoieƒ]”(DN IV.3, 697A ), which is to say that it makes things be by making themintelligible. The formal determination of each being, then, is its goodness,and so is the presence in it of God, the Good, Goodness itself, by which itis good and so is.The reversion of effects to their cause, in turn, forms the basis forDionysius’ account of the ontological love or desire of all things for God.Like Plotinus and Proclus, Dionysius explains that the very existence of allthings depends on, or rather consists in, their desire for, or reversion to, God,the Good. As Proclus says that “through that by which there is being to eachthing, through this there is also being good,”15 so Dionysius says of theangels, for example, that “by desiring [Goodness] they have both being andbeing good [t›V ™gaq¬thtoV . . . ÷fi°menai ka¥ t¿ eΔnai ka¥ t¿ e‚ eΔnai⁄cousi]” (DN IV.1, 696A ). It is only in desiring Goodness, by appropriatingor actively receiving it, that they are at all, and clearly this is true not onlyof the angels but of all things. Thus Dionysius says later, “By all things, then,the Beautiful and Good is desired and loved and cherished16. . . and all things,by desiring the Beautiful and Good, do and wish all things that they do andwish” (DN IV.10, 708A ). The most fundamental activity of any being is tobe, and any “other” activities (e.g. living and thinking) are not additional tothis but are modes or specifications of the activity of being.17 No being, then,can be without desiring or reverting to God, i.e. receiving him as its consti-tutive determination, its goodness. All things come to be, they are, only inat once and identically proceeding from and reverting to, and in that senseloving, God.The very being of each thing, then, is its possessing, receiving, revert-ing to God according to its proper mode. Thus, after saying that the Goodis that “to which all things are reverted . . . and which all things desire,”18Dionysius continues, “the intellectual and rational cognitively [gnwstikÍV],the sensitive sensitively, those without a share in sensation by the naturalmotion of vital [zwtik›V] desire, and those which are not living and aremerely beings merely by their fitness for existential participation” (DN IV.4,700B; cf. DN I.5, 593D ). This paraphrases Proclus’ account of the modes ofreversion, with the insertion of a sensitive mode, proper to irrational ani-mals, between the cognitive mode belonging to angels and human beings(“the intellectual and rational,” respectively) and the vital mode belonging"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"42THEOPHANYto plants.19 The proper activity which constitutes each thing as what it is,which is that thing’s distinctive mode of being, is its way of reverting to God.A stone in merely existing as a stone, exercising the characteristic activitiesof being hard, heavy, and brittle; a plant in living, an animal in livingsensitively, a human being in living rationally—in short, each thing simplyin being what it is, i.e. in being in its proper way, is desiring or tendingtoward God, the Good, in its proper way, actively receiving him as its de-termination. Thus to revert to God is to proceed from him and to proceedfrom him is to revert to him.As in Plotinus and Proclus, then, a being’s reversion to God is produc-tive of the being no less than its procession from him. Since procession andreversion are in reality the same relation of dependence, a thing’s being madeto be by God is not in any sense prior to its desire for him. Rather, thegeneration of the being consists in its tending toward God no less than in itscoming from him. Thus reversion, as the activity of the being, is the being’sshare in its own being made to be. As in Plotinus and Proclus, the product hasan actively receptive role in its production, and if it does not exercise thisactivity it cannot exist. For Dionysius, God cannot make beings without theiractive cooperation,20 for without that activity they would not be anything. Inevery being, including animals, plants, and inanimate things, there is an ele-ment of “interiority,” of selfhood, an active share in its own being what it isand so in its own being. At the level of rational beings, this interiority takesthe form of self-consciousness, of personhood and freedom. But the principlethat any being’s reversion is creative of it means that there is something analo-gous to freedom and personhood at every level of reality, even in inanimatethings.21 For without this active selfhood, a being would have no unifyingidentity, it would not be this one distinct thing, and so would not be at all.As the Good, by receiving which all things exist, God is also theBeautiful, and Dionysius tends to use these names conjointly and inter-changeably (e.g. DN IV.7, 704B; IV.8, 704D; IV.10, 705C–708A; IV.18,713D). Dionysius’ account of God as Beauty is grounded in Plotinus’identification of beauty with form.22 Plotinus argues that sensible things arebeautiful, i.e. attractive and delightful to consciousness, in so far as they havea share of form, which has this effect on us because, as intelligible, it is“akin” to the cognitive power in us: both the form in the sensible object andthe soul in the subject derive from and are lesser presentations of Intellectitself. What is beautiful, then, is what is intelligible, i.e. form (I.6.1–2).Elsewhere Plotinus reaches the same conclusion by arguing that an artisti-cally sculpted stone is more beautiful than a raw lump because form is moreevident in it, in that it has been shaped according to the idea in the artist’smind (V.8.1). He then transfers this reflection to the beauty of natural things,which are also works of art in that they are sensible images or expressions ofIntellect, and remarks, “Is not this beauty everywhere form, which comesfrom the maker upon that which he has brought into being?” (V.8.2.14–15)."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"43GOODNESS, BEAUTY, AND LOVESince the beauty in sensible things is the share of form in them, what is trulyand primarily beautiful is form itself, i.e. being, the content of Intellect. Thisin turn means that beauty, in the sense of “that which is beautiful,” is thedifferentiated, intelligible manifestation of the Good. The Good, then, is notthat which is beautiful, but is rather “beautifulness” or Beauty itself, that bywhich being is beautiful. “These beautiful things [the forms] then, must bemeasured and limited, but not the really beautiful or rather the super-beautiful[t¿ •p°rkalon]; but if this is so, it must not be shaped or be a form. Theprimarily beautiful, then, and the first, is without form, and beauty is that,the nature of the Good” (VI.7.33.19–22; cf. I.6.9.40–43).Proclus preserves this distinction between intelligible form as what isbeautiful and the Good, beyond form, as in this sense beyond beauty,23 butalso argues that “in us,” i.e. in participating particulars, there is no distinc-tion between their goodness and their beauty.24 The general Neoplatonicdoctrine, then, despite variations in expression, is that form or being, theintelligible, is what is beautiful, and the Good is Beauty itself, as that bywhich the forms are forms, are beings, are beautiful.On this basis, Dionysius says that “this Good is hymned . . . as Beauti-ful and as Beauty” (DN IV.7, 701C ). Since form is beauty, and the formaldetermination in each thing is God in it, therefore the beauty in each beingis God in it. Dionysius explains that “the Beautiful beyond being[t¿...•pero§sion kal¿n] is called Beauty [kºlloV] on account of thebeautifulness [kallon‹n] distributed from it to all beings in the mannerproper to each” (DN IV.7, 701C ). Just as God is the Goodness of all goodthings, which is to say of all things, so he is the Beauty of all things. HenceGod is called Beautiful “as pre-possessing in himself, supereminently, thefontal beautifulness of every beautiful thing. For in the simple and supernatu-ral nature of the whole of beautiful things, all beautifulness and every beau-tiful thing pre-exists uniformly as cause [kat’ aÎt√an]” (DN IV.7, 704A).The final phrase is a Procline technical term for the undifferentiated con-tainment of effects in their cause (El. Th., prop. 65). In this one sentence,then, Dionysius says three times over, with the words “simple” (ªplŒ), “uni-formly” (...noeidÍV), and “as cause” (kat’ aÎt√an), that God contains inhimself without distinction the beauty of all things. And since the beauty ineach thing is God in it as its causal determination, the beauty of each beingmakes it to be: “From this Beautiful is being to all beings [÷k to£ kalo£to§tou pøsi o‚si t¿ eΔnai], each being beautiful according to its properdetermination [l¬gon]” (DN IV.7, 704A ). Since to be is to be intelligible,and to be intelligible is to be beautiful, to be is to be beautiful. All being,therefore, qua intelligible or beautiful, is the unfolding or manifestation ofBeauty itself, or God. For Dionysius, as for Plato and Plotinus, it is in itsbeauty that being manifests itself as the manifestation of transcendence.Since Beauty is the same as Goodness, it is at once ™rc– and t°loVfor all beings. Thus Dionysius says that God is named Beauty not only as"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"44THEOPHANYpresent in each being as its beauty, making it to be, but also as “calling[kalo£n] all things toward itself, wherefore it is called Beauty [kºlloV].”25Both Beauty and Goodness indicate God as the end which makes things tobe by providing them with determinate identity. “The Beautiful is the prin-ciple [™rc‹] of all things, as making cause [poihtik¿n a≥tion] and movingand holding together the whole by the love of its proper beautifulness, andlimit of all things, and cherished, as final cause [telik¿n a≥tion], since forthe sake of the Beautiful all things come to be; and paradigmatic [cause][paradeigmatik¬n], in that all things are determined [™for√zetai] accord-ing to it” (DN IV.7, 704AB ). Here Dionysius identifies determination, finalcausality, and causality of being under the name of Beauty, in that the beautyof each being, as its defining determination, is identically its end and itscause of being.26Dionysius’ entire account of procession and reversion, of God as theGood and the Beautiful, culminates in his celebration of God as Love (⁄rwV).“The cause of all things, through excess [•perbol–n] of goodness, loves[÷rø ̨] all things, makes all things, perfects all things, sustains all things,reverts all things; and the divine love is good, of good, through the good. Forlove, the very benefactor of beings, pre-existing in excess in the Good, didnot permit it to remain unproductive in itself, but moved it to productiveaction, in the excess which is generative of all things” (DN IV.10, 708AB).God is Love, then, in that he is “excess,” i.e. is distributed to all things,making all things to be by being differently present in each. Dionysius’ ac-count of God as Love is therefore another expression of the doctrine of Godas beyond being, not any distinct, determinate being but the universal deter-mination or differentiation that constitutes all things. His presentation ofGod as Love is in fact closely parallel to his account of the divine nameDifferent, which we have examined earlier.27Dionysius’ doctrine of God as productive love for all things is oftenregarded as a uniquely Christian aspect of his thought, in which it differssignificantly from non-Christian Neoplatonism.28 In fact, however, Dionysius’position differs only in expression, not in philosophical content, from that ofPlotinus and Proclus. His entire account of divine love recalls and coincidesin meaning with Plotinus’ description of the “overflow” of the One, or ratherof the One as Overflow, which is the production of being.29 “[T]he One,perfect because it seeks nothing, has nothing, and needs nothing, overflows,as it were, and its superabundance makes an other” (V.2.1.8–10). For Plotinus,the One produces all things in that it provides them with all that they haveand are, as differentiated presentations of itself. “We breathe and are pre-served because that Good does not give [d¬ntoV] and then go away but isalways providing as long as it is what it is” (VI.9.9.10–11). Plotinus does notuse the term ⁄rwV in this context, but this “overflow” or “giving,” the Oneas the productive “power of all things,” is exactly what Dionysius refers to asproductive divine love.30 And in Plotinus as in Dionysius, the immanence of"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"45GOODNESS, BEAUTY, AND LOVEthe One which this implies in no way compromises, but rather coincideswith, the One’s transcendence. The One, as we have seen, is transcendentnot in the sense of being self-contained and apart from all things, but ratherin that it is not any thing but the power of all things, present to all beingsas that by which they are beings.31 Thus it is transcendent as constitutivelyimmanent, which is exactly what Dionysius expresses in his account of Godas overflowing Love.Proclus’ position on this point may seem to be further removed fromDionysius’ because of his distinction between participated and unparticipatedterms, between, at the highest level, the henads and the One. He attributesto a certain kind of gods a “providential love” (⁄rwV pronohtik¬V) wherebythey produce subordinate things by “filling all things with themselves,” whichcorresponds closely to, and is no doubt largely the source of, Dionysius’account of love.What then is it necessary to say about the gods or the good daimons?Is it not that being present to all things they transcend all things,and having filled all things with themselves they are likewiseummixed with all things, and permeating everywhere they haveplaced their own life nowhere? But what should we say about thegods who are said to love their own offspring . . . ? Is it not that suchlove is providential and preservative of those beloved, and perfec-tive and constitutive of them? . . . And gods indeed love gods, thesenior their inferiors, but providentially, and the inferior their supe-riors, but revertively.32But Proclus does not ascribe such providential love to the One itself, asunparticipated.33 However, we must remember that Proclus’ intent in makingthe distinction between participated and unparticipated terms is not to keepthe unparticipated term aloof from its participating effects, but, on the con-trary, to guarantee its universal presence to all alike, without its being con-ditioned or limited by them. It is precisely by and as the participated termsthat the unparticipated is present to all its effects, and indeed the partici-pated terms, and, in turn, all their consequent terms, are nothing but thedifferentiated presence of the unparticipated to the effects.34 The gods, there-fore, which by providential love fill and constitute all things, are the differ-entiated presences of the One in all beings. Thus we find in Proclus the samecoinciding of transcendence and immanence that we find in Plotinus’ doc-trine of the One as productive overflow and in Dionysius’ account of divinelove. For Plotinus and Proclus, then, the One “loves” his products (althoughthey do not use this term), in that he is constitutively present to them,providing them with all that they are as the differentiated manifestation ofhimself.35 To be sure, Dionysius is the first to use the terms ⁄rwV and÷kstatik¬V to express this doctrine, and this terminological innovation may"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"46THEOPHANYwell be inspired by his Christianity;36 but the conception of God that itexpresses is already present in the thought of Plotinus and Proclus.Dionysius elaborates on the understanding of divine Love when he says,The very cause of all things, by the beautiful and good love of allthings, through excess of erotic goodness, becomes out of himself[⁄xw ...auto£ g √netai] in his providences toward all beings, and isas it were enticed by goodness and affection [™gap–sei] and loveand is led down, from above all things and beyond all things, to inall things [÷k to£ •p‰r pºnta ka¥ pºntwn ÷xfirhm°nou pr¿V t¿÷n pøsi katºgetai], according to an ecstatic power beyond being,without going out from himself [™nekfo√thton ...auto£]. (DN IV.13,712AB )Since God’s presence “in all things” is his making them to be, this is anotheraccount of the productive procession or differentation that establishes beingsas beings. God goes “out of himself” without “going out from himself” in thathe is, as it were, intrinsically ecstatic, not a self-contained self but alwaysalready “out of himself” and “in all things” as their constitutive differences.His being “in himself” consists in his being “out of himself” and “in allthings,” just because God is no thing, not any being, but the causal deter-mination, the production, or in Plotinus’ phrase the “power,” of all things.As the constitutive differentiation of beings, not any thing but themaking of all things, God is pure exteriority, having no inner core of“selfhood,” no “interior” that could be distinguished from his “outward” pro-ductive activity. God is not a “self” of his own, a being, but only the self, thedetermining identity, of others, of all things; and this is what Dionysiusmeans by describing him as ecstatic love. But for precisely the same reason,because his “self” is nothing but productive giving, it is equally true that Godis pure interiority, absolutely unconditioned by any relation to beings thatwould be an accident or an affect additional to his inner self. In God as Love,therefore, pure interiority coincides with pure exteriority.37From this it follows that the divine name Love indicates not onlyprocession, the movement of God to beings, but also reversion, the move-ment of beings to God. For the being’s interiority, its reversion to or love forGod, which is the characteristic activity by which it is itself and so is, is Godhimself at work in the being.38 “Hence the skilled in divine matters call[God] also jealous, as the great good love toward beings, and as waking tojealousy his erotic desire, and as showing himself as jealous, to whom thethings desired are objects of jealousy, and because the objects of providenceare objects of jealousy to him” (DN IV.13, 712B). God can be said to desirehis products erotically, not in that he “lacks” or “needs” them, but in thathe providentially, or productively, moves or draws them to himself. As wehave seen, there is no difference between the cause’s reverting the effect to"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"47GOODNESS, BEAUTY, AND LOVEitself and the effect’s reverting to the cause: both formulations express thesame ontological motion of effect to cause. Hence, God’s erotic love for thebeing, his moving or reverting it to himself, is the being’s reversion to orerotic love for God. This motion, which is the proper activity by which thebeing is what it is, is God’s “providential” presence in the being as its inte-riority, its selfhood, its being. For this reason, the being’s active participationin its own being produced does not contribute anything additional to whatit receives from God: the being’s reversion to God, which is its constitutive,identifying activity, is God himself present and active in it.God’s love for the being, which makes it to be, is thus not only hisprocession to it but also his moving or reverting the being to himself.39 Theidentity of God’s love for the being and the being’s love for God followsfrom, or indeed simply reiterates, the identity of procession and reversion.God’s procession to the being, the being’s procession from God, the being’sreversion to God, and God’s reversion of the being to himself, are all one,for all describe the being’s dependence on God as its constitutive determi-nation. This single metaphysical motion, by which all things are, is the fullmeaning of the divine name Love.This is why, for Dionysius, there can be no distinction whatever be-tween ⁄rwV and ™gºph, between love as acquisitive desire and love asbeneficent giving (DN IV.11–12, 708C–709D). God’s “agapic” procession toall things is his “erotic” moving all things to himself, and the “agapic” self-abandonment of all things to God is their “erotic” acquisition of him. AsDionysius explains, “The divine love is ecstatic [⁄sti...÷kstatik¿V ̨ qeƒoV⁄rwV], not allowing lovers to belong to themselves, but to those beloved”(DN IV.13, 712A ). ’ ́ErwV is “ecstatic” in that, as desire for the other, it isan abandonment of oneself to the other, a movement of the lover “out” ofhimself and “into” the other. As we have seen, God is himself only as theself of others, of all things. Thus, as Dionysius says, God’s erotic desire for thebeing (reversion) is his providential, constitutive presence in it (procession).Conversely, his constitutive presence to the being (procession) is his movingit to himself (reversion). Because there is no real distinction between proces-sion and reversion, there is no distinction between giving to the other andtaking the other to oneself.So also, on the side of the being, its erotic desire for God is a self-abandonment to God, a reception of God as its being, as its self, so that itmay be. “Wherefore the great Paul, having come to be in possession of divinelove, and participating in its ecstatic power, says with inspired mouth, ‘I live,and yet not I, but Christ lives in me,’ as a true lover and, as he says, ecstaticto God, and living not his own life but the life of the beloved, as greatlycherished” (DN IV.13, 712A ). The felicitously ambiguous phrase “in posses-sion of divine love” (÷n katocŒ to£ qe√ou...⁄rwtoV) means at once thatPaul is possessed by divine love and that he possesses it. And this is preciselythe point: to possess, or acquire, God as one’s being is to give oneself up to"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"48THEOPHANYhim, to be possessed by him. Every being whatsoever must in effect say, “Iam, and yet not I, but God is in me,” not as an obscure mystical paradox butas a precise metaphysical truth. Here again, therefore, the “agapic” self-abandonment to God is the “erotic” acquisition of God whereby a being is.The conventional distinction and antithesis between ⁄rwV and ™gºph40depends on a dualistic vision of God and the creature as two beings set overagainst one another, so that there is an opposition between “selfish” desire forthe other and “selfless” giving to the other. But where, as in Neoplatonism, thebeing is nothing but the manifestation or presentation of God, where its verybeing is nothing but God-in-it, and God is not a self-contained self or being butthe self, the being of all things, there can be no such opposition. Rather, the verylife of the world consists in the erotic exchange or interchange between beingsand God, which is at once and on both sides a giving and a receiving.Dionysius describes this exchange in his account of how God is at oncelove or charity and the beloved or cherished. “What do the theologiansmean when they say now that he is love and charity, and then that he isbeloved and cherished?” He explains that “in one respect he is moved, butin the other he moves [t ̧ m‰n kineƒtai, t ̧ d‰ kineƒ];” that is, as love Godis moved, i.e. proceeds to or is present in all things, while as beloved hemoves, i.e. causes other things to move, reverting them to himself.41 Butsince procession and reversion are the same metaphysical motion, this dis-tinction breaks down. Thus Dionysius continues,They call him cherished and beloved, as beautiful and good, andagain love and charity, as the power which at once moves and leadsbeings up to himself . . . and as being the manifestation [⁄kfansin]of himself through himself and the good procession [pr¬odon] ofthe transcendent union, and the erotic motion, simple, self-moved,self-active, pre-existing in the Good, and overflowing from the Goodto beings, and again reverting them to the Good. Herein the divinelove eminently shows its endlessness and beginninglessness, as aneternal circle, whirling around through the Good, from the Good,and in the Good and to the Good in unerring coiling-up, alwaysproceeding and remaining and returning in the same and by thesame. (DN IV.14, 712C–713A)Here Dionysius expressly identifies God as not merely that which proceedsto and so makes beings, but as the very procession or manifestation whichis the making of all things. The “whirling circle” of divine love, then, is Godpresent in all things as their goodness, their beauty, their activity, theirbeing. Love is the procession and reversion which is the very existence of allthings, and hence Dionysius’ entire account of divine love is a presentationin dynamic terms of participation, the constitutive relation of the deter-mined to its determination."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"49GOODNESS, BEAUTY, AND LOVEDionysius’ presentation of God as productive Love raises the much-vexed question of whether, for Dionysius, God makes all things “freely” or“by necessity.”42 The entire issue is almost always misconceived, because itis usually assumed that to say that God creates “freely” means that he “mightnot create,” and that he “chooses” between possible alternatives of creatingand not creating; while, conversely, to say that there is no such choicebetween possible alternatives, that God “cannot” not create, means that heis subject to some “necessity.” This entire construction of the problem is amisconception, and to correct it we must go back once more to Plotinus,who is often misunderstood in the same way.43Plotinus regularly insists that the One produces being “by necessity”(e.g. I.8.7.20; II.9.3.8–12; V.1.6.32). But just what does this mean? Clearly,it indicates that there is no alternative possibility. As we have seen, theOne’s production of all things is not additional to or other than the Oneitself (e.g. VI.8.13.5–8, 31; VI.8.20.14–19); rather, the One simply is theproduction of being, “the power of all things,” the enabling condition bywhich beings are beings. Thus, in addressing the issue of the One’s “free-dom,” Plotinus explains that there is no distinction between the One and hisactivity or will (VI.8.7.47; VI.8.13.7–8, 31). Obviously, if the One is nothingbut the production of beings, then he is not “free” not to produce, and inthat sense all things proceed from him “by necessity.”But this does not mean that the One is subject to some principle or law,some “necessity” higher or more universal than himself, such that he “must”produce beings. Plotinus’ metaphors of “emanation” are, indeed, often misin-terpreted as indicating that the necessity of production is a universal law towhich all things, including the One, are subject. But this cannot be correct,since the One is not any being, even the highest, and cannot be subject to anyprinciple above or more universal than itself. Plotinus’ point, rather, is that theuniversal productive tendency of all things to “impart themselves” is theirimitation of or participation in the One as Giving or Production itself.If the First is perfect, the most perfect of all, and the primal power,it must be the most powerful of all beings44 and the other powersmust imitate it as far as they are able. Now when anything elsecomes to perfection we see that it produces, and does not endure toremain by itself, but makes something else. This is true not only ofthings which have choice, but of things which grow and producewithout choosing to do so, and even lifeless things, which impartthemselves to others as far as they can: as fire warms, snow cools,and drugs act on something else in a way corresponding to theirown nature—all imitating the First Principle as far as they are ableby tending to everlastingness and goodness. How then could themost perfect and the first Good remain in itself as if it grudged itselfor were impotent—the power of all things? (V.4.1.24–36)"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"50THEOPHANYThe One, then, is not subject to a “law of emanation” more universal thanitself, but rather, as Giving or Production, is itself the law or paradigm towhich all things, in producing, conform. And as this passage shows, themetaphor of emanation does not assimilate the One to a lifeless or sub-rational object that acts by natural necessity without choice. Rather, self-impartation by necessity of nature is the lowest mode, and production bychoice a higher mode, of imitating the One. The chosen activity of rationalbeings, as a mode of activity that proceeds more immediately from the agentitself, thus comes closer to the One as pure productive activity than does the“natural” activity of sub-rational beings.Thus, when Plotinus says that beings proceed from the One “by neces-sity,” he means not that the One is subject to a more universal condition,but, on the contrary, that the One, as the power of all things, is absolutelyunconditioned by anything. “He does not then have from another either hisbeing or his being what he is. He himself therefore is by himself what he is,related and directed to himself, that he may not in this way either be relatedto the outside or to something else, but altogether self-related” (VI.8.17.24–27). It is just because the One is in no way conditioned by or related toanything that there are no alternative possibilities for him. For if the Onemight not produce being, then his productive activity would be distinct fromhimself and he would be conditioned by a relation to his product. Only aGod who is not a producer but Production itself can “produce” withoutentering into a relation with his products. The necessity of procession, there-fore, is in no sense a limitation on the One, but rather an expression of hisabsolute freedom from any limiting condition whatsoever.In fact, the disjunctive presupposition that either God chooses betweenpossible alternatives or he is necessitated to create situates God within a totalframework of possibilities, as though the logical conditions of possibility andimpossibility were prior to and more universal than God, conditions to whicheven he is subject. This presupposition envisions God either as confrontedwith a multiplicity of logical possibilities among which he can choose, or assubject to a logical law such that there is only one possibility open to him.This is precisely the “ontic” conception of God that Plotinus, and Dionysius,are concerned to avoid by declaring him “beyond being.” God is not a being,subject, as are all beings, to the conditions of logical possibility such as theprinciple of non-contradiction. This is not to say that God can violate thatprinciple; on the contrary, it would be more accurate to say that for theNeoplatonists, God or the One is the principle of non-contradiction. Forwhat is that principle but the very condition of intelligibility and thereforeof being? “To be is to be intelligible” means that to be is to conform to thelaws of thought, which necessarily apprehends its object as determined bycertain attributes and (therefore) as excluding the contradictory ones. Theunity, the identity, and therefore the being of any thing consists in its con-formity to this law. That law, therefore, is an expression of God as the unity,"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"51GOODNESS, BEAUTY, AND LOVEthe identity, the being of beings. God is not a being, contained within aframework of possibilities determined by an abstract logic independent ofhimself. Rather, he is that framework within which all beings are contained,and hence he cannot be considered either as a being who chooses among amultiplicity of logical possibilities, or as a being confined by principles moreuniversal than himself to a single possibility.45The point of Plotinus’ insistence on the necessity of procession, then,is not to situate the One within a total system to whose laws he is subject,but, on the contrary, to preserve the One’s absolute transcendence to thetotality of beings. If the One might-or-might-not-produce, then he would bea being, with an activity distinct from himself; his producing would be anaccident or affect of him; and he would not be absolute or transcendent butconditioned by a relation to his products (see e.g. VI.8.8.13–15). As Plotinussays, “The Good does not need the things which have come into being fromhim . . . but is the same as he was before he brought it into being.46 He wouldnot have cared if it had not come into being; and if anything else could havebeen derived from him he would not have grudged it existence” (V.5.12.41–46). This does not mean that he does not “love” or “care for” his products:on the contrary, he loves and cares for them in the only metaphysicallymeaningful sense, in that he provides them with all that they are and have.47It means simply that the One-producing is not different from the One sim-pliciter, that the One is not affected or conditioned by or in relation to hisproducts, as he would be if his producing were distinct from himself.48The necessity of procession, then, is not a condition to which the Oneis subject but is simply the One itself as pure generosity, as productiveOverflow.49 “How then could the most perfect and the first Good remain initself as if it grudged itself or were impotent—the power of all things?”(V.4.1.34–36). Being proceeds “necessarily” from the One as nothing but“the power of all things.” The One itself, not any motion, choice, will, oractivity distinct from the One itself, is the reason why there are beings (seeVI.8.14.32–33). As Plotinus says, “[T]he One did not in some sort of waywant Intellect to come into being, with the result that Intellect came intobeing with the wanting as an intermediary between the One and the gen-erated Intellect; for if this was so, the One would be incomplete . . . But itis clear that if anything came into existence after him, it came into existence‘while he remained in his own proper state’ ” (V.3.12.29–35). Because of theOne, then, being cannot not be. But the necessity of being is not a conditionimposed on the One, but is rather the One himself: “[The One] is not heldfast by necessity, but is itself the necessity and law of the others” (VI.8.10.34–35). And since the One himself is the reason why there is no possiblealternative, this “necessity” could equally well be construed as “freedom.”Since the conventional antithesis between “Neoplatonic necessaryprocession” and “Christian free creation” is a misconception, so too is anyattempt to situate Dionysius within these categories. For Dionysius as for"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"52THEOPHANYPlotinus, God is nothing but the making of all things, so that the possibilityof not making does not arise. As Dionysius says, “Since, as subsistence ofgoodness, by its very being [a¶t ̧ t ̧ eΔnai] it is cause of all beings, thegood-founding providence of the Godhead is to be hymned from all theeffects . . . And by its being [t ̧ eΔnai] it is the production and origin of allthings [tÍn ̇lwn paragwg‹ ka¥ •p¬stasiV]” (DN I.5, 593D; cf. DN IV.1,693B).50 As in Plotinus, to produce all things is not a “choice” on God’s part.But also as in Plotinus, this means not that God is subject to a constrainingcondition, but rather the very reverse, that he is subject to no conditions, sothat all things proceed from nothing but himself. That God “cannot notcreate” is a consequence, not a limitation, of his absolute transcendence, hisunrelatedness to that which proceeds from him.51 Dionysius offers an excel-lent formulation of this principle when he says, “Love . . . pre-existing inexcess in the Good, did not permit it [o¶k e≥asen a¶t¿n] to remain unpro-ductive in itself, but moved it to production, in the excess which is genera-tive of all things.”52 “Did not permit it”: no alternative, then, is possible.Precisely as the Good, as the productive condition of beings, God cannot notproduce. But the “cannot” lies purely in himself, as Love.53 It is not imposedon him, as a condition to which he is subject. As not any being but theecstatic Love by which all beings are beings, therefore, the God of Dionysius,like the One of Plotinus, transcends both choice and necessitation and theopposition between them.54"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTHE PROBLEM OF EVILUpon completing his account of God as Goodness, Beauty, and Love,Dionysius immediately raises the inevitable question: “If the Beautiful andGood is beloved and desired and cherished by all things . . . how does themultitude of demons not desire the Beautiful and Good . . . and, in general,what is evil, and whence does it originate, and in which of beings is it?” (DNIV.18, 716A ). As is well known, the ensuing discussion of evil draws veryextensively on Proclus’ treatise On the Subsistence of Evils,1 although Dionysiusdoes not follow Proclus’ account without alteration.2 His own position is thatevil is not a positive attribute of any being, but rather a deficiency of good-ness, and hence of being, in a thing which to some extent is and is good.This position aligns Dionysius with other Christian thinkers such as Gregoryof Nyssa, Augustine, and Thomas Aquinas. But the very familiarity of this“privation theory of evil,” especially in its Augustinian and Thomist ver-sions, may tend to obscure its full meaning and depth. A careful philosophi-cal consideration of this doctrine in its Dionysian form reveals that theidentification of evil as non-being is not a shallow “cosmic optimism,” anabsurd denial of the obvious fact of evil in the world,3 but a profound andcompelling theory which is more philosophically satisfying than many otheraccounts of evil.The doctrine of evil as privation of being follows as a necessary con-sequence from the production of all things by God. If absolutely all that is,with no exception whatsoever, is made to be by God, the Good, then evilcannot be included within the whole of reality as anything that is at all. Butthe derivation of all reality from a God who is Goodness itself is not aphilosophically unjustified article of faith, which could easily be falsified bythe evident presence of evil in the world. It is rather, as we have seen, aphilosophical consequence of the intelligibility of being: since being is intel-ligible, therefore it has the Good beyond being as its first principle, and everybeing is a different manifestation of goodness. The traditional claim that53"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"54THEOPHANY“every being, insofar as it is a being, is good”4 is virtually a restatement of thelaw that to be is to be intelligible, for the intelligibility of anything consistsin its goodness. That which is altogether devoid of goodness has no intelli-gibility, no unity, no identity, and hence is not anything at all. Nothing canbe and be evil, insofar as it is. A wholly evil being is a contradiction in terms,for it would be a wholly unintelligible being, and so not a being. It is fromthese fundamental considerations that the Neoplatonic doctrine of evil asdeficiency is developed.The foundations for the privation theory of evil are established inPlotinus. As is well known, Plotinus identifies evil with the matter whichunderlies sensible things (e.g. I.8.5.8–10). But this matter, for Plotinus, is nota positive metaphysical component of sensible things that is other than form.Rather, since to be is to be intelligible, only form is, and sensible things arenot, strictly speaking, composites of matter and form but rather lesser, “dim-mer” forms.5 In opposition to Aristotle, therefore, Plotinus understands matter,insofar as it is not form, as privation (see e.g. II.4.16), the ontological deficiencyof sensibles in relation to purely intelligible realities. Matter, or evil, then,is the partial non-being which belongs to sensible things in that they are notreality itself but images or appearances (see, e.g. II.4.16.3–5). For Plotinus,therefore, matter is identified with evil not as anything which is, an evilbeing, but rather precisely and only as non-being, as the deficiency of beingwhich constitutes sensibles as sensibles rather than pure forms (see esp.II.4.12.1–7). Hence matter or evil, considered by itself in abstraction fromany and all form, is non-being. “But when something is absolutely deficient—and this is matter—this is essential evil without any share in good. Formatter has not even being—if it had it would by this means have a share ingood; when we say it ‘is’ we are just using the same word for two differentthings, and the true way of speaking is to say it ‘is not’ ” (I.8.5.8–13).This non-being, matter, or evil, this deficiency, is thus generated as a “by-product” in the production of the sensible cosmos, without which the sensiblequa sensible, i.e. qua appearance, would not occur at all (see II.4.12.1–7). HencePlotinus argues that evil, understood in this way as privation, is a necessaryaspect of the sensible cosmos and that it proceeds from the Good. “But howthen is it necessary that if the Good, also evil? Is it because there must bematter in the All? This All [i.e. the sensible cosmos] . . . would not exist atall if matter did not exist . . . Since not only the Good, there must be the lastend to the process of going out past it . . . and this last . . . is evil. Now it isnecessary that what comes after the First should exist, and therefore that thelast should exist; and this is matter” (I.8.7.1–4, 17–22). But if this “evil”comes from the Good and is a necessary aspect of the cosmos which is itselfgood, it is hard to see how it is truly evil. Indeed, Plotinus also argues thatthe “evils” which afflict particular members of the cosmos, such as the de-struction and consumption of one by another, are in fact necessary contri-butions to the perfection of the whole: “This All is visibly not only one"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"55THE PROBLEM OF EVILliving creature, but many; . . . when the many encounter each other they ofteninjure each other because they are different; and one injures another to supplyits own need, and even makes a meal of another . . . The coming into beingand destruction and alteration for worse or better of all these individual thingsbrings to its fulness the unhindered life according to nature of that one [uni-versal] living creature” (IV.4.32.32–38, 44–47). In the cosmic perspective,therefore, these “evils” are not really evil at all (cf. III.2.15–16).Plotinus distinguishes the evil which is matter, and which can onlyproblematically be regarded as evil, from another kind of evil, which he callsevil “in the soul” (I.8.5.30), or what we might call “moral” evil. This is notmatter but rather the particular soul’s descent from intellectual contempla-tion to sense perception as its mode of cognitive activity. This evil, too,therefore, is a kind of privation, a privation of intellectuality in the soul. Thesoul’s descent is a separation, a self-isolation, from the universal governanceof the cosmos. “But they [i.e. particular souls] change from the whole tobeing a part and belonging to themselves . . . Now when a soul does this fora long time, flying from the All and standing apart in distinctness, and doesnot look towards the intelligible, it has become a part and is isolated andweak and busy . . . ; it is fallen, therefore, and is caught, and is engaged withits fetter [i.e. the body], and acts by sense because its new beginning preventsit from acting by intellect” (IV.8.4.10–28). Such self-isolation, as a defectionfrom the intellectual possession of and communion with the whole of being,is therefore a lessening of the self: “Now it is because you approached the Alland did not remain in a part of it, and you did not even say of yourself ‘I amjust so much,’ but rejecting the ‘so much’ you have become all—yet evenbefore this you were all; but because something else came to you after the‘all’ you became less by the addition; for the addition did not come frombeing . . . but from non-being” (VI.5.12.17–22). The fall of the soul fromintellectuality to sensuality is, as it were, played out in the particular evildeeds we perform as a result of sensual desire, fear, and other passions: “[T]hesin of the soul can refer to two things, either to the course of the descent orto doing evil when the soul has arrived here below” (IV.8.5.17–18). Moralevil, then, consists for Plotinus not in matter but in the soul’s failure to befully intellectual,6 a failure which is an ontological diminution of the soulitself. Hence moral evil, too, is not a positive attribute or activity of the soul,but rather a privation, a partial lack of intellectuality and therefore of beingin the soul.In On the Subsistence of Evils, Proclus largely, but not completely, fol-lows Plotinus’ account of evil. He agrees with Plotinus that there can be noabsolute evil: “And since [evil] is twofold, on the one hand only evil, on theother not unmixed with the good, the one in no way is . . . but the other weorder among beings” (9.4–6). Nothing, therefore, can be completely evil.“All things, then, are good, in that there is no evil unadorned and unmixed”(10.18–19). Whatever is evil must also be in some way good, or it would not"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"56THEOPHANYbe at all. The evil in any thing, then, is not a positive attribute or form butonly a partial privation of goodness. “It would appear to be the most difficultof all things to know, in itself, the nature and form of evil, if every knowl-edge is a touching of form, but evil is formless and as it were privation[™ne√deon ka¥ o«on st°rhsiV] . . . For as the primally Good is beyond allthings, thus evil itself is without a share in all goods, I mean qua evil, anda lack and privation of them [⁄lleiyiV ÷ke√nwn ka¥ st°rhsiV] . . . What isaltogether evil is privation and lack of goods” (51.1–8, 42). However, Proclusdiffers from Plotinus by expressly rejecting the doctrine that evil is matterand that, as matter, it is necessary. He argues, more consistently than Plotinus,that “if matter is evil, one of two things is necessary: either to make theGood the cause of evil, or [to make] two principles of beings.” Either alter-native is unacceptable. “Since matter is from the Principle, even this has itsentrance into being from the Good . . . Nor is evil from the Good” (31.5–9,13). To say, as Plotinus does, both that matter is evil and that it proceedsfrom the Good leads to absurdity: “Thus the Good will be evil, as the causeof evil, but evil will be good, as produced from the Good” (31.16–18). Proclusfurther argues that matter, precisely in that it is a necessary aspect of thesensible cosmos, cannot be evil: “But if matter is necessary for the All, andthe cosmos would not be ‘this all-great and blessed god’ if matter were ab-sent, how can the nature of evil still be referred to this? For evil is one thing,and the necessary another, and the latter is such that [the universe] couldnot be without it, but the former is privation of being” (32.1–5).7 By denyingPlotinus’ identification of evil with matter, Proclus thus avoids the difficultyof claiming that evil is a necessary condition for the good cosmos.Taking the various levels of reality in turn, Proclus explains that evilis found neither in gods, nor in angels, nor in daimons,8 nor in heroes. Evilenters only when we come to the level of human souls, which “are in po-tency at one time to ascend, at another to be carried into generation and amortal nature” (20.7–8). Evil in human souls, for Proclus as for Plotinus,consists in their falling from intellectual contemplation: “When [a soul] isunable . . . to imitate its presiding [divinity], it becomes devoid of the con-templation of being, but is drawn by other, secondary powers which revolvearound the world . . . This, therefore, is the weakness of a soul, that is, failing[peccantem] from that vision to be borne downwards” (23.18–22, 24.1–2).Evil in the soul, then, is not any positive attribute or activity, but a weak-ness, a lack of power, a privation of contemplative activity (cf. 56.3–5).Finally, particular bodies are subject to evil in the sense of harm or corrup-tion in that, since their natures are only parts of nature as a whole, they canbe harmed by other partial natures: “For indeed, to nature as a whole, noth-ing is outside of nature . . . But to that [nature] which is in singular things,one thing will be according to nature, but another not according tonature . . . It belongs to this nature, therefore, to be affected [obtineri] and toact outside of nature” (27.11–18). This corresponds to Plotinus’ account of"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"57THE PROBLEM OF EVILparticular members of the cosmos injuring and destroying one another. Andfor Proclus as for Plotinus, what is in this sense evil for the part is good forthe whole: “But how is the evil in bodies at the same time also good, saveas being according to nature for the whole, but contrary to nature for thepart?” (60.1–2).The Good, then, and the subordinate divinities derived from it, is thecause of evil things not insofar as they are evil but only insofar as they aregood. “Plato, placing all things around the king of all things . . . calls himcause of all beautiful things, and does not call him [cause] of all thingssimply; for he is not [the cause] of evils. But he is both not cause of thesethings, and cause of every being; for [he is cause] even of these things asbeings and in that each is good” (61.10–16).9 What, then, is the cause of theevil, the partial privation of goodness, in a human soul or in anything elsewhich is to some degree evil? Proclus says, “It must in no way be posited thatthere is one cause of evils in itself. For if the cause of good things is one, thecauses of evils are many” (47.2–4). But as what they cause is not a perfectionbut a privation, so these “many causes” are themselves purely negative, ab-sences, deficiencies. The causes of evil are not productive powers, but lackof power, of productive activity: “Therefore the generation of what is con-trary [to good] comes about . . . on account of weakness of that which makes[debilitatem facientis]” (50.18–20). Again, “evil is alien and supervenient, anunattainment [™teux√a] of the befitting end for each thing. But theunattainment is through the weakness [™sq°neian] of that which makes”(50.34–35). Since evil itself is a deficiency, its “cause” is a lack of efficiency,of productive power. “And as good, [an evil thing] is from the gods, but asevil, from another, weak cause; for every evil is generated through weaknessand privation” (42.8–10). And since the “cause” of evil is in fact a lack ofcausal power, evil, as deficiency, can even be said to be “without cause”(™na√ti¬n) (50.30).Dionysius largely follows Proclus, above all in adhering to the Neoplatonicprinciple that no being can be wholly evil, but must possess some goodness,without which it would not be anything at all. “All beings, insofar as they are,are good and from the Good; and insofar as they are deprived of the Good,they are neither good nor beings . . . But what is in every way deprived of theGood neither was nor is nor will be nor can be in any way whatsoever” (DNIV.20, 720B). Evil, Dionysius explains, is like a disease: “Disease is a lack oforder, not whole. For if this happened, neither would the disease itself exist.”10Just as a disease which kills its host destroys itself, so too, if a being werecompletely evil, totally devoid of goodness, it would not be an evil being, butwould simply not be at all, and so would be neither evil nor good. Evil can befound, then, only as a deficiency in a being which, in that it is a being, musthave some goodness whereby it is intelligible and so is.The greatest change Dionysius makes in Proclus’ theory is to extendthe doctrine of evil as a partial privation of goodness to all levels of reality.11"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"58THEOPHANYHe follows Proclus’ procedure of looking for evil at every level, from angels,or intellects, down to matter. But whereas Proclus finds evil, as deficiency,only at the level of human souls and of natural bodies, Dionysius uses thisprocedure to explain, on the one hand, that evil is no positive reality inanything, and, on the other, that it can occur as a deficiency of properperfection at any level of being whatsoever. Thus he argues that evil is noreality in angels (DN IV.22, 724BC); in demons (DN IV.23, 724C–725C);12in souls (i.e. human souls) (DN IV.24, 725D–728A); in irrational animals(DN IV.25, 728B); in nature as a whole (DN IV.26, 728C); in bodies (DNIV.27, 728D); and in matter (DN IV.28, 729AB). On this last point heexpressly follows Proclus in denying Plotinus’ “notorious” position that “evilis in matter, as they say, in that it is matter” (DN IV.28, 729A).13 Dionysiusargues, first, that “if [matter] is in no way whatsoever, it is neither good norevil. But if it is somehow a being [pwV ∫n], and all beings are from the Good,this too would be from the Good” (DN IV.28, 729A ). He goes on to takeup Proclus’ cogent argument that if matter is necessary, it cannot be evil: “Ifthey say that matter is necessary for the completion of all the cosmos, howis matter evil? For evil is one thing, and the necessary another” (DN IV.28,729A). Whatever is necessary for the perfection of the whole is not evil butgood. If, as Plotinus argues, matter is necessary, then it cannot be evil. Thisargument is effective not only against Plotinus’ doctrine that matter is bothevil and a necessary consequence of the Good, without which the (good)cosmos could not be produced, but also against all attempts,such as have been made from antiquity to the present, to explain the evilsthat occur in the world as necessary contributions to the perfection of thewhole. Any such theory, as Dionysius here points out, does not explain evilbut rather explains it away by claiming, in effect, that it is not really evilat all.Nothing, then, is evil insofar as it is a being. Conversely, anything isevil insofar as it fails to be. Dionysius’ doctrine of evil as non-being must beunderstood in light of the principle that any being is in virtue of its properdeterminations or perfections, which are its way of being good and thereforeits mode of being. Anything is evil, i.e. not good, then, insofar as it lacks theproper goodness which is its constitutive determination, and to that extentfails to be itself and so to be. Such a failure can occur not only in the humansoul but at any level of reality, including that of angelic intellects. ThusDionysius says, for example, that “the demons are not evil by nature” (DNIV.23, 724C) and are called “evil” “not insofar as they are, for they are fromthe Good and received a good reality, but insofar as they are not, by beingweak (as the Oracles say) in preserving their principle [™rc–n]. For in what,tell me, do we say they are evil, except in the cessation of the possession andactivity of divine good things?” (DN IV.23, 725A). He then says, still moreclearly, that “they are not evil by nature, but by the deficiency [÷nde√a ̨] ofangelic goods” (DN IV.23, 725B). They are evil, then, insofar as they lack"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"59THE PROBLEM OF EVILthe perfections proper to and constitutive of them as angels. And since theseperfections are their very being, to the extent that an angel lacks them (i.e.is a demon), to that extent it fails to be. Dionysius goes on to point out thatthe demons do have some perfections, for otherwise they would not exist atall, and to this extent they are good: “They are not altogether without ashare in the Good, insofar as they both are and live and think” (DN IV.23,725B), and again, “In that they are, they both are from the Good and aregood . . . and by privation and fleeing away and falling away from the goodsthat are appropriate to them they are called evil” (DN IV.23, 725C).Exactly the same principle applies to human souls: “In what are theymade evil, except in the failure of good conditions and activities . . . ? . . . Nei-ther, then, in demons nor in us is evil as an evil being [»n kak¬n], but asfailure and absence of the perfection of our proper goods” (DN IV.24, 728A).Dionysius thus explicitly extends the doctrine of evil as partial lack of good-ness to cover not merely human souls and natural bodies but all beingswhatsoever, including intellects, which for Plotinus and Proclus are inca-pable of evil: “This is evil, in intellects and souls and bodies: the weaknessand falling away from the condition of their proper goods” (DN IV.27, 728D).14And in lacking its “proper goods,” a being lacks the very unity and identitywhereby it is, and to that extent it fails to be.The “proper goods” of any being, as we have seen, are the constitutivedeterminations whereby it is itself and so is. But these determinations, atonce its goodness and its being, are the presence of God in it, making it tobe. How then can any being fail, to some degree, to possess them? Here wemust return to the doctrine of reversion, which as we have seen means thata being actively takes part in its own being made to be. Its possessing itsproper determinations, and so its being, is not a passive reception but anactive performance of its nature, so that, as we saw, God cannot make it tobe without its active cooperation or participation. To be is the activity of abeing; and herein lies the possibility of evil. For the being may fail fully toexercise this activity, to appropriate the divine processions proper to andconstitutive of it, to enact its nature, and so to be. A being is evil, then,insofar as it does not perform the proper activities which are its mode ofbeing, and to that extent it fails to be.As a being’s partial lack of its proper perfections, evil is ultimately afailure of reversion, the being’s failure to appropriate, to desire, to love Godas the Goodness whereby it is. Since, as we have seen, to be is to love God,and anything can be only in and by desiring God, then insofar as anythingdoes not desire God, it falls short of complete being. Thus Dionysius saysthat the demons “are not altogether without a share in the Good, insofar asthey are and live and think, and in short, there is some motion of desire inthem. But they are called evil through the weakness in their activity accord-ing to nature” (DN IV.23, 725B).15 The natural activity of any being is itsreversion, its mode of being, of desire for God. A thing’s lack of its proper"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"60THEOPHANYperfections, which qualifies it as evil, is a failure of this desire, and thereforea deficiency of being.On Dionysius’ view, there can be no actual desire for evil and thereforeno positive activity which is evil. Following a common tradition of Greekthought, he argues that all desire is for some good. “And if beings desire theBeautiful and Good, and do all the things they do on account of what seemsgood, and every goal of beings has the Good as its principle and end, fornothing does what it does with a view to the nature of evil, how will evil beamong beings?” (DN IV.19, 716C).16 In other words, whatever is desired isby definition regarded as good, for to desire something means to take it asone’s good. “No one does what he does with a view to evil” (DN IV.31,732C).17 As the scholastics would say, anything is desirable only sub specieboni. Evil qua evil, as what is not good, has no attractive or motivating powerand cannot be a goal, a purpose, an object of desire for anything. Evil,therefore, cannot be the cause of any activity. Rather, as we have seen, allthe activities of all beings take place in desire for the Good: “All things, bydesiring the Beautiful and Good, do and wish all things that they do andwish” (DN IV.10, 708A). In the absence of any good at which to aim, thereis no desire and hence no activity whatsoever.No activity, qua activity, then, is evil. Evil, therefore, lies not in abeing’s acting contrary to its nature but only in its not acting according toits nature, and so not fully being. “Evil then is privation and failure andweakness. . . and purposeless . . . and inactive and ineffective . . . For thatwhich is altogether without a share in the Good neither is nor is capable ofanything” (DN IV.32, 732D–733A). And this inactivity stems not from adesire for evil, which is impossible, but only from a lack of desire for theGood. Since anything is good insofar as it is, to desire evil would be to desirenothing. “And desiring that which is not, [the demons] desire evil [to£ m‹∫ntoV ÷fi°menoi to£ kako£ ÷f√entai]” (DN IV.23, 725C). But this meansthat insofar as anything desires evil, it is really just not desiring at all: “Andinsofar as [the demons] do not desire the Good, they desire that which is not.And this is not desire, but a missing of genuine desire” (DN IV.34, 733D).At bottom, then, evil as deficiency of being is a failure to revert to, to love,to desire God, who as the Good is the sole cause and end of all desire.Evil, then, is fundamentally passivity, the failure in a being of thereversion, the agency, the interiority which is its taking part in its beingmade to be. This interiority, as we saw in chapter 3, is the freedom whichis analogously present at every level of reality. A being is evil, then, insofaras it fails to act, to exercise its freedom. But that agency or freedom, we alsosaw, is God himself at work in the being, making it to be. Hence, insofar asanything is evil, i.e. insofar as it is not, God is not productively present init. All reality is (nothing but) the manifest presence of goodness, i.e. of God.Where reality is lacking, goodness is deficiently present. But this deficiencyis due to the being’s failure to appropriate the love which is God as its own"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"61THE PROBLEM OF EVILbeing and activity. The less the being acts, the less God acts in it,18 and sothe less it is. In these terms we can understand Dionysius’ account of whythere is no contradiction between universal divine providence and the free-dom of beings, which includes the possibility of evil:And if none of beings is without a share in the Good, but evil is alack of the Good, none of beings is altogether deprived of the Good,divine providence is in all beings, and none of beings is withoutprovidence . . . Therefore we will not accept the vain saying of themany, who say that providence ought to draw us to virtue againstour will; for to corrupt nature does not belong to providence.Wherefore, as providence is preservative of the nature of each, itprovides for the self-moved as self-moved. (DN IV.33, 733B)Because God and the being which he makes are not two beings or selvesdefined over against each other, but rather God is the very selfhood of thebeing, there is no contradiction between being self-moved, or free, and beingmoved, or provided for, by God. The being’s self-motion, its freedom, is itsparticipation in God, the “providential” presence of God in it. So, con-versely, the being’s failure to move itself, to enact its nature, is its failure tobe moved by God, i.e. to desire God, and so to be.Dionysius’ examples from the realm of human behavior illustrate thisaccount of evil as passivity:For instance, the intemperate man, although he is deprived of theGood with regard to his irrational appetite, in this respect he nei-ther is nor desires beings; but he participates somehow in the Goodwith regard to the obscure echo itself of union and friendship. Andanger participates in the Good with regard to moving and desiringto straighten and turn around seeming evils to seeming goods. Andhe who desires the worst life, in wholly desiring life, and that whichseems best to him, by the very fact of desiring, and desiring life, andlooking to a best life, participates in the Good. (DN IV.20, 720BC)Each of these men, in desiring anything at all, is therefore necessarily desiringsomething good, and to that extent is not wholly evil. Dionysius continues,“And if you take away the Good altogether, there will be neither reality norlife nor desire nor motion nor anything else” (DN IV.20, 720C). A man isvicious, then, not in that he desires evil but insofar as he does not desire theGood. But to that extent he is not desiring, not acting, not moving himself butbeing moved by passions, which means precisely that which we undergo(pºscein) as opposed to that which we ourselves do. Dionysius’ account ofthe fall of man in the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy is thus fully in accord with themetaphysics of evil developed in the Divine Names: “The life of many passions"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"62THEOPHANY[≠ polupaqestºth zw‹] received human nature which in its beginningunintelligibly slipped away from the divine goods . . .

It pitiablyfell into danger of non-existence [™nuparx√aV] and destruction” (EH III.3.11,440C–441A). Here Dionysius repeatedly links the fall, as a fall toward non-being, with the passions in their multiplicity.19 For to the extent that a manis subject to passions he is failing to be a self at all, a center of unity thatexists in and by performing its own activity. Largely passive, driven aboutnot by himself but by the passions, by what happens to him from without,he is vicious in his lack of unity, of interiority, of selfhood, failing to takepart in his own being and to that extent failing to be. Nothing can be whollypassive, for that would mean having no unity, no identity, no activity, noselfhood, and so not being at all. But to the extent that anything is passive,it fails to be one, to be itself, and so to be, and to that extent it is evil.Having come this far in the discussion of evil, we inevitably ask: Whydo some beings not fully desire God? What is the cause of this failure? Byraising this question we reach the very heart of Dionysius’ doctrine of evil:as non-being, as inactivity, evil is without cause (™na√tion) (DN IV.30,732A; IV.32, 732D). For it is only beings and their activities, things that areand that take place, that must have causes, without which they would notbe or happen. To look for the cause of evil is to ask why it occurs. But evilis not something that occurs, but not-something that does not occur. It is notan act of non-love, but a non-act of love. As we have seen, whatever anybeing does, it does for some cause, and that cause is a good. As non-activity,evil is precisely what is not caused to happen and hence does not happen.Hence there can be no reason why a being fails fully to love God, i.e. to be.If there were such a reason, the “failure” would not be a failure but anactivity, and as such not evil but good. “Everything which is according tonature comes about from a definite cause. If evil is without cause and indefinite,it is not according to nature” (DN IV.30, 732A).20 Everything that is, insofaras it is, is according to nature, is caused, and is good. The causelessness ofevil, conversely, is one with the identification of evil as a thing’s not fulfillingits nature and so not fully being.The claim that evil, as non-activity, has no cause, may seem highlyunsatisfactory, a facile evasion of an unsolvable problem which in fact viti-ates Dionysius’ entire doctrine of evil, or indeed the privation theory of evilin any form. To see why, on the contrary, it is in fact a truly profound andphilosophically insightful treatment of the problem, we must return to thefundamental connection between goodness and intelligibility. In demandingto know the cause of whatever we are trying to understand, we are in factdemanding intelligibility. Anything is intelligible, able to be understood bythought, only in virtue of the “why” for it. As Aristotle says, “We do not"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"63THE PROBLEM OF EVILthink that we know until we grasp the ‘why’ [t¿ diΩ t√] about each thing,and this is to grasp its first cause” (Physics II.3, 194b19–21). This is whyphilosophy, the effort to understand reality as a whole, is for the ancientsfundamentally a doctrine of causes. For the Neoplatonists, as we have seen,the One is the “cause” of all things precisely as the universal principle ofintelligibility. But further, the cause in virtue of which anything is intelli-gible is always its good, so that the end, the t°loV of anything is its causeof being or ™rc–. To understand anything, to grasp the “why” of it, is to seehow it is good, and therefore the Good is the universal principle of intelli-gibility and so of being. Consequently, if evil, the failure to desire the Goodand so to be, took place for some reason, if it had a cause in terms of whichit could be explained, that cause, that reason, would be a good. Evil itself,then, would not be evil but good, and explainable only because and insofaras it was good. Conversely, evil is evil exactly in that it is not good andtherefore not intelligible, not understandable in terms of any reason or cause.When we describe something as evil, we mean that it is to some degree notgood and to that extent does not make sense, that we can see no reason, no“why” for it. We may recall Dionysius’ statement in the Ecclesiastical Hierar-chy that man “unintelligibly [™no–twV] fell from the divine goods” (EHIII.3.11, 440C).21 To be intelligible, to have a cause [aÎt√a], and to be good,are one and the same. Unintelligibility, or causelessness, is therefore the verymeaning of evil; and it is as unintelligibility that evil is non-being. Thefollowing passage thus summarizes Dionysius’ entire doctrine of evil as cause-less non-being:Evil, then, is privation and lack and weakness and asymmetry andfailure [ªmart√a, usually translated as “sin” but literally having thenegative meaning “missing” or “failing”] and aimless and beautylessand lifeless and mindless [†noun] and irrational and purposeless[™tel‰V] and unstable and causeless and indeterminate and unpro-ductive and inactive and ineffective and unordered and unlike andlimitless and dark and insubstantial [™no§sion] and itself no beingwhatever in any way whatsoever [mhdamÍV mhdam› mhd‰n ∫n].(DN IV.32, 732D)Dionysius’ inability, or rather refusal, to assign a cause to evil, then,marks not the failure but the success of his treatment of the problem. Toexplain evil, to attribute a cause to it, would necessarily be to explain itaway, to deny that evil is genuinely evil at all.22 For to explain something isto show how it is in some way good. “Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner.”Only by not explaining evil, by insisting rather on its radical causelessness,its unintelligibility, can we take evil seriously as evil. This is why most“theodicies” fail precisely insofar as they succeed.

Dionysius’ treatment of evil,on the other hand, succeeds by failing, recognizing that the sheer negativitythat is evil must be uncaused and hence inexplicable, for otherwise it wouldnot be negativity and would not be evil.23It has been wisely remarked that any satisfactory account of evil mustenable us to retain our outrage at it. Most theodicies fail this test, for insupposedly allowing us to understand evil they justify it and thus take awayour outrage. For Dionysius, however, evil remains outrageous precisely be-cause it is irrational, because there is no reason, no justification for it. Theprivation theory of evil, expressed in a radical form by Dionysius, is not ashallow disregard or denial of the evident evils in the world. It means ratherthat, confronted with the evils in the world, we can only say that for noreason, and therefore outrageously, the world as we find it does not perfectlylove God, the Good, the sole end of all love. And since the Good is theprinciple of intelligibility and hence of being, to the extent that anythingfails to partake of that principle it is deficient in being.

Although he applies his neologism ̆erarc√a only tothe angelic and ecclesiastical ranks, the concept of hierarchy is at workthroughout his understanding of reality, and all the related terminology, suchas order, rank, higher/coordinate/lower, superior/inferior, superordinate/sub-ordinate, is found in the Divine Names with regard to the structure of realityas a whole.1 In articulating the metaphysical principles of this hierarchy ofbeing, we shall see how these same principles are at work in the angelic andecclesiastical ranks. Dionysius’ understanding of hierarchy, whether onto-logical, celestial, or ecclesiastical, is a development of his account of thedivine processions, of the constitutive perfections of beings, and hence of thewhole of reality, as the differentiated presence of God.The divine names which Dionysius presents as a ranked sequence inDivine Names V.1 and discusses in chapters IV, V, VI, and VII of the DivineNames respectively, are Good (i.e. Goodness), Being, Life, and Wisdom.These “names” or processions are the modes in which God is constitutivelypresent in the various ranks of beings: inanimate things, or mere beings;plants, or living beings; irrational animals, or sensitive beings; humans, orrational beings; and angels, or intellectual beings. Animals, humans, andangels are here grouped together as cognitive beings, participants in God asWisdom. The divine processions, then, are ordered on the basis of the de-grees of universality in which they are participated or present in beings. “Forthe divine name of the Good, manifesting the whole processions of the causeof all things, is extended both to beings and to non-beings, and is abovebeings and above non-beings. That of Being is extended to all beings and isabove all beings. That of Life is extended to all living things and is aboveliving things. That of Wisdom is extended to all intellectual and rational andsensitive beings and is above all these things” (DN V.1, 816B). The Good65"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"66THEOPHANYis first, then, because as Goodness God is present in all beings and non-beings. (The meaning of this odd statement will be considered shortly.)Being comes next, because as Being he is present in all beings; next comesLife, for as Life God is present in all living things; and finally Wisdom, aswhich he is present in all cognitive beings.2 The order of the divine proces-sions is thus a mirror image of the ranks of beings:GoodBeingLifeWisdomcognitive living beingsliving beings(mere) beingsnon-beingsIn ordering the divine processions on the basis of their degrees ofuniversality, Dionysius is once again closely following Proclus. Proclus distin-guishes Being, Life, and Intellect,3 in that order, as the three aspects ofintelligible reality, subordinate to the Good beyond being. “UnparticipatedIntellect leads all things which participate in intellect, and Life all thingswhich participate in life, and Being all things which participate in being; andof these Being is prior to Life and Life prior to Intellect . . . There must beIntellect prior to intellectual things and Life prior to living things and Beingprior to beings.” These terms are ranked on the basis of the relative univer-sality of their causal presence: “Among these Being will be first; for it ispresent to all things in which there are Life and Intellect (for everythingwhich lives and participates in intellection, by necessity is) but the converseis not true (for not all beings live and think) . . . If, then, Being is cause ofmore things, Life of fewer, and Intellect of still fewer, Being is first, then Life,then Intellect” (El. Th., prop. 101). Thus Proclus explains that animals (i.e.cognitive living things) are caused by the One, Being, Life, and Intellect;plants by the One, Being, and Life; and inanimate things by the One andBeing.4 Since whatever has a less universal perfection must also have themore universal ones, Proclus describes a series of “layers” of participatedperfections, in which the more universal serves as a “substratum” for the lessuniversal: “All that in the originative causes have more universal and higherrank become somehow in the resultant things, according to the illuminationsfrom them, substrata for the impartations of the more specific . . . And thussome participations precede others” (El. Th., prop. 71).Dionysius’ hierarchy of causal determinations is thus fundamentallythe same as that of Proclus. Proclus, however, “hypostasizes” all these terms,and in his philosophical apologetic for traditional polytheistic religion identifies"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"67THE HIERARCHY OF BEINGthem as “gods” of various types and levels.5 Dionysius, on the other hand,obviously with Proclus and his school in mind, expressly and repeatedlyrejects this position, taking care to explain that the various divine proces-sions are not “demiurgic substances or hypostases,” a multiplicity of divinitiesor quasi-divine entities in between God and his products (DN XI.6, 953D),but are nothing but the differentiated presence of God in different beings:“The treatise . . . does not say that the Good is one thing and Being anotherand Life or Wisdom another, nor that the causes are many and that there aredifferent divinities, higher and lower, productive of different things; but thatall the good processions and divine names hymned by us are of one God; andone [i.e. the name Good] manifests the complete providence of the one God,but the others, his more universal and more specific [providences]” (DN V.2,816C–817A). This repudiation of Proclus’ polytheism is often regarded asone of Dionysius’ most significant “Christianizations” of Proclus and one ofthe most profound differences between them. Instead of positing a multiplic-ity of productive divinities subordinate to the One, Dionysius regards theconstitutive perfections of all things as the immediate differentiated presenceof God himself.6 But is the difference really so great? As we have seen,Proclus’ elaborate reifications are best understood as “aspects,”7 and termssuch as Being, Life, and Intellect are in fact various levels of manifestationof the One, its differentiated constitutive presence to all things at differentlevels of specificity. To say, for example, that living things are caused notonly by the One but also by Life, and that they revert to the One throughLife, means that life is the mode of unity proper to them, their specific wayof being one. The hypostasis “Life,” then, is the specific mode in which theOne is causally present to living things qua living. The lower causal powersare specifications of higher, more universal ones, and as such are containedin and are differentiated presences of them (see e.g. El. Th., props. 126, 140,145).8 Hence all these subordinate “hypostases” are contained in and arepresences of the One, as the productive power of all things. All perfectionsof all things are modalities of unity, and hence all reality, for Proclus no lessthan for Dionysius, is the presence of the One, in differing modes and de-grees: life is a higher degree of unity than mere existence, and consciousnessa higher degree of unity than life. Thus all of Proclus’ hypostasized causes aredifferent modes in which unity is effectively present to beings. Proclus ar-gues, for example, that the gods are henads because the One or Good, as “the‘whence’ and the ‘whither’ of all things,” is God, and the gods are “its propermanifold” of participated terms (El. Th., prop. 113). As this argument makesclear, only the One or Good, as the total and absolute source of all realitywhatsoever, is God in an absolute sense, and lesser terms are “gods” onlybecause and insofar as they are distinct modes of unity. “Every god is abeneficent henad or a unifying goodness . . . but the primal God is the Goodunqualified and Unity unqualified, whilst each of those posterior to him is aparticular goodness and a particular henad” (El. Th., prop. 133).9"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"68THEOPHANYUnderstood in terms of his own metaphysical principles, therefore,Proclus’ position, subsuming lower divinities into higher and ultimately allinto the One, might be more objectionable to a thoroughgoing polytheistthan to a Christian.10 The difference between Dionysius and Proclus at thispoint is thus more a matter of religious practice than of metaphysical con-tent. Proclus hymns the many modes of unity as a multiplicity of gods;Dionysius hymns God as the many modes of unity. But for Proclus, no lessthan for Dionysius, these modes of unity are the differentiated presentationsof divinity, and both philosophers worship that divinity as it is differentlymanifest in different beings.11 What matters most is that beneath the superficialopposition between Dionysius and Proclus, they share the same fundamentalvision, that of a world filled with and constituted by a multiplicity of divinepowers at work differently in different things, all of which are presences ormanifestations of the One, or God.Dionysius’ dependence on Proclus for the hierarchical ordering of thedivine processions explains his initially puzzling statements that Goodnessextends not only to beings but also to non-beings, and is therefore moreuniversal than Being. We might expect that Goodness and Being, as theperfections by which all beings are beings, would be equally universal andsimply identical, like Goodness and Unity or Goodness and Beauty. In anycase, what can it mean to say that not only beings but even “things whichare not” (tΩ o¶k ∫nta) participate in Goodness? As Parmenides wouldpoint out, there are no “things which are not,” and hence “they” cannot doanything or have any features. Further, Dionysius has just identified non-being with (what is not good but) evil. Nonetheless, he repeatedly claimsthat not only beings but also non-beings participate in, desire, or revert tothe Good.12 These statements can be understood only if we turn once moreto Dionysius’ Neoplatonic background.An examination of the comparable passages in Proclus shows thatwhat Dionysius means by the “non-beings” which participate in the Good isin fact simply matter, considered by itself in abstraction from form. As wesaw in chapter 4, Plotinus, in opposition to Aristotle, identifies the matterof bodies as the ontological deficiency of sensibles vis-à-vis forms and in thatsense as non-being. He further argues that this non-being which is matterproceeds, as do all things, from the Good. Proclus follows Plotinus in arguingthat matter, understood in this way as privation, proceeds from and partici-pates in the Good (El. Th., props. 57, 72), and, more consistently thanPlotinus, denies that it is evil. But since, considered by itself apart from formas that which underlies or is receptive to all form whatsoever, matter is notanything, having no intelligible content at all of its own, it does not proceedfrom or participate in Being; for to participate in Being is to be something,to have some definite intelligible identity, some form. Thus Proclus says,“[W]hat Intellect causes is also caused by the Good, but not conversely. For"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"69THE HIERARCHY OF BEINGeven privation of forms is from the Good (for all things are from it); butIntellect, being form, cannot give rise to privation” (El. Th., prop. 57).13Matter, then, underlies Being as participated Being underlies Life and par-ticipated Life underlies Intellect. Thus Proclus concludes that the Good orthe One is more universally productive than Being, since the Good produceseven matter, considered in abstraction from form, while Being produces thingsonly insofar as they have some form. “All those characters which in theparticipants have the relative position of a substratum proceed from morecomplete and more universal causes . . . From this it is apparent why matter,taking its origin from the One, is in itself devoid of form . . . For matter,which is the substratum of all things, proceeded from the cause of all things”(El. Th., prop. 72). Thus we must complete the list given above by sayingthat animals are produced by the One, Being, Life, and Intellect; plants areproduced by the One, Being, and Life; inanimate objects are produced by theOne and Being; and matter is produced by the One.This, then, is the position Dionysius is adopting when he says thateven non-beings participate in God as the Good. The non-being in questionis simply matter, which is not anything by itself, apart from form, but isfound in things in that they possess, or receive, forms. The fundamentalmeaning of this doctrine, then, is that the very receptivity of beings, whichconstitutes them as beings rather than God, is itself a gift. The materialaspect of beings, as their neediness or receptivity, could be regarded as theirlove, which is prior to their being in that they are constituted as beings onlyby loving, or actively receiving, God.14 But this love itself, as God in them,is given to them. In this sense the matter of beings can be said to participatein the Good, but, considered as pure receptivity, not in Being. Understoodin this way, Dionysius’ statements that even non-beings participate in anddesire the Good are fully in accord with his Neoplatonic sources and withthe presentation of the Good as the source and principle of all form.After presenting the hierarchy of divine processions, Dionysius addressesa hypothetical objection: “Yet someone might say, ‘Wherefore is Being setabove Life and Life above Wisdom, when living things are above beings, andsensitive things which live above these, and rational things above these,and the intellects are above the rational things and are more around God andcloser to him?’ ” (DN V.3, 817A ). In other words, since in the order of theworld living things are higher than mere beings, animals higher than plants,and so on, it would seem to follow that the divine procession Life should beabove Being, and Wisdom above Life. Dionysius replies that this would be caseonly if the more specific perfections excluded the more universal ones: “Ifsomeone supposed that the intellectual things were without being and withoutlife [™no§sia ka¥ Òzwº], the saying would be sound” (DN V.3, 817B). Butin fact, of course, plants have not only life, but also being; cognitive thingshave not only consciousness, but also being and life."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"70THEOPHANYBut since the divine intellects also are [in a way] above other be-ings, and live [in a way] above the other living things, and thinkand know [in a way] above sense and reason . . . they are nearer tothe Good, participating in it in an eminent way, and receiving fromit more and greater gifts; likewise rational beings excel sensitiveones, having more by the eminence of reason, and the latter [excelother living things] by sensation, and [living things excel mere beings]by life. And . . . the things which participate more in the one andinfinitely-giving God are closer to him and more divine than therest.15 (DN V.3, 817B)As this account makes plain, the various processions are simply more and lessuniversal modes of the same divine presence, so that the more universalcontain the less universal as their specifications. Being is above Life, and Lifeabove Wisdom, because Life is nothing but a specification of Being, andWisdom nothing but a specification of Life.Life, in plants, therefore, is not superadded to Being, but is the morespecific, intense mode of Being proper to them as compared to stones; Wis-dom, i.e. consciousness, is not superadded to Life, but is the more specific,intense mode of Life and Being proper to cognitive things.16 Intellection, asthe highest mode of consciousness, is thus the highest mode of life and being.Angels, as intellects, therefore possess in a higher way all the perfections oflesser beings.17 This accounts for what may seem to be Dionysius’ excessive,not to say obsessive, interest in angels, not only in the Celestial Hierarchy butalso in the Divine Names and the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. Angels are notmerely the highest in a univocal series of beings; rather, they are beings in thefullest, most complete, and therefore paradigmatic sense. “The holy ranks ofthe celestial beings, then, are in participation of the thearchic impartation[in a way] above things which merely are, and those which live irrationally,and those which, like us, are rational” (CH IV.2, 180A). As in Plotinus,intellect is being itself at its highest, most perfect level. Conversely, if life isa higher mode of being and consciousness a higher mode of life, then the lifeof plants is their lesser, more diffuse mode of what in animals is conscious-ness, and the “mere being” of inanimate things is a still lesser, more diffusemode of consciousness and life. Thus all things are in their lesser ways thatwhich angels are most fully. Angelology becomes ontology. This accordswith Proclus’ and Dionysius’ account of the modes of reversion, existential,vital, and cognitive, where the characteristic activity, the reversion of eachorder of beings, is the mode of being proper to them.It is therefore one and the same constitutive divinity, the Good, thatis present in all things analogously, or in the manner proper to each. “TheGood is altogether not uncommunicated to any of beings, but shines forth[÷pifa√netai] the ray beyond being, established remainingly in itself, byilluminations analogous [™nal¬goiV ÷llºmyesin] to each of beings” (DN"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"71THE HIERARCHY OF BEINGI.2, 588CD; see also DN IV.1, 693B). These “illuminations” are the partici-pated determinations of creatures, and they are “analogous to each” in thateach being participates in God in the manner appropriate to and constitutiveof that being. Thus God, the Good, is present in each thing, as Dionysiussays, “according to its rank” (kat’ ™x√an) (e.g. DN VIII.7, 893D–896C; DNIX.10, 917A): in some as mere being, in others as life, in others as thought,and so on. This is an “analogous” or “proportional” presence because itmeans that being is to a stone as life is to a plant, as sensation is to ananimal, as reason is to a man, as intellection is to an angel: its proper modeof goodness and unity, of interiority and selfhood, its participation in God.Since the same divinity is present analogously at every level of reality, God“is hymned from all beings according to the analogy of all things, of whichhe is cause” (DN VII.3, 872A).Dionysius’ doctrine of analogous participation in God is thus closelyparallel to Plotinus’ teaching that the nature of all things is their share incontemplation or intellectual activity (which itself is the manifestation of theOne), so that the life of plants is a “growth-thought” and that of animals a“sense-thought” (III.8.8.14–15).18 The same principle can be found in Proclus,in the form of his well-known affirmation, “All things are in all things, butproperly in each.” He goes on to explain: “In Being there is life and intellect;in Life, being and intellect; in Intellect, being and life; but each of these existsupon one level intellectually, upon another vitally, and on the third existen-tially” (El. Th., prop. 103). For him, too, the less universal perfections arespecifications of the more universal ones, so that, for example, living thingshave intellect “vitally,” i.e. in the mode of life, and intellectual things have life“intellectually,” i.e. in the mode of intellect. At bottom, for Plotinus, Proclus,and Dionysius, this is because all orders of reality represent higher and lowerdegrees of unity and goodness: Intellect or Wisdom, Life, and Being are simplythe diminishing degrees of unity and goodness found in cognitive beings, plants,and inanimate things respectively.The principle that in any hierarchy the same perfection or activity isanalogously present throughout all the levels is evident in Dionysius’ accountsof the angelic and the ecclesiastical hierarchies. In the Celestial Hierarchy, heexplains that the name of a higher level may be applied to a lower because“just as the first [i.e. the higher ranks of angels] possess eminently the holy-befitting properties of the lower, so the later possess those of the earlier, notin the same way, but in a lesser way” (CH XII.2, 293B). He then uses thisprinciple to explain why the prophet Isaiah is said to have been purified by aseraph, although according to the strict rules of hierarchy only the lowest rankof angels should be in direct contact with men. As one possible account of thisapparent anomaly, Dionysius suggests that the angel in question was not reallya seraph but “ascribed his own purifying sacred activity . . . to God, and afterGod to his prior-working hierarchy” (CH XIII.3, 300CD). This ascription,however, was no mere courtesy but was in fact true, because"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"72THEOPHANYthe thearchic power, coming to all things, spreads and extends ir-resistibly through all things and again is unmanifest to all, not onlyas transcending all things in a manner beyond being, but also ashiddenly spreading its providential activities to all. But it is alsomanifested analogously to all the intellectual things, reaching outits own gift of light to the senior substances, through them, as first,imparting it in good order to the subordinates, according to theGod-seeing measure of each rank. (CH XIII.3, 301A)This clearly affirms that because the activity of every level in any hierarchyis the presence of God in the mode proper to that level, therefore the activ-ity of the lower is that of the higher, in a lesser, analogous way. Just as plants,in living, are exercising thought in their lower mode, so the angel, in puri-fying, is exercising the seraphic activity in his lower mode. So also, in theEcclesiastical Hierarchy, Dionysius remarks that not only the angelic hierarchybut “that and every hierarchy, and that which is now hymned by us, has oneand the same power throughout the hierarchical activity” (EH I.2, 372CD).For this reason, all the sacramental activity in the church is in fact that ofthe bishop: “Therefore the divine order of the hierarchs [i.e. bishops] is thefirst of the orders which see God, but it is also the extreme and last, for init are perfected and fulfilled all the ordering of our hierarchy . . . The powerof the hierarchic [i.e. episcopal] order pervades all the sacred totalities, andthrough all the sacred order effects the mysteries of its own hierarchy” (EHV.1.5, 505AB). This is simply an application of the principle of analogyarticulated in the Divine Names for the hierarchy of being as a whole.In light of this principle, there is no contradiction between the hier-archical structure of reality and the immediate constitutive presence of Godto all things. When Dionysius says that higher beings are “closer to [God]and more divine than those that follow” (DN V.3, 817BC), this does notmean that they stand between the lower orders and God. Rather, it meansthat, having the more universal perfections in having the more specific ones,they are “participating eminently in [the Good] and receiving more andgreater gifts from it” (DN V.3, 817B), or that they “participate in [God] inmany ways [pollacÍV]” (CH IV.1, 177D). All things participate in God asGoodness and Being; living things participate in God as Goodness, Being,and Life; cognitive things, as Goodness, Being, Life, and Wisdom. Thus allthings, at every level, participate directly in God in the manner appropriateto them. Therefore the hierarchical structure of reality, far from separatingthe lower orders of being from God, is itself the very ground of his immediatepresence in all things. Every being participates directly in God precisely inand by occupying its proper place within the cosmic hierarchy: stones bymerely existing; plants by living; animals by sensing, humans by being ratio-nal, angels by being intellectual. It is not hierarchical order, but rather anegalitarian leveling, that would violate the immediate participation of allthings in God by blurring the differences and ranks of beings which consti-"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"73THE HIERARCHY OF BEINGtute that very participation. Hence, in discussing the divine name Righteous-ness or Justice (dikaios§nh), Dionysius castigates the egalitarian view thatrejects hierarchical order and identifies justice with equality:The divine righteousness orders and sets the bounds for all things,and, preserving all unmixed and unconfused with all, gives to allbeings what is appropriate to each, attending to each of beingsaccording to its rank. And . . . as many as rail against the divinerighteousness are condemned unawares for their evident unrighteous-ness, for they say that immortality ought to be in mortal things, andwhat is complete in incomplete things . . . and identity in differingthings, and perfect power in the weak . . . and altogether they at-tribute to things what belong to others [tΩ Òllwn ÒlloiV™podid¬asin]. They ought to known that the divine righteousnessin this is really true righteousness, because it assigns to all thingswhat is proper according to the rank of each of beings, and preservesthe nature of each in its proper order and power. (DN VIII.7, 896AB)Justice, properly understood, means not equality but due proportion, “a placefor everything and everything in its place.”19 All things participate equally inGod by being unequal, by occupying different ranks in the hierarchical orderof the whole.The view that hierachical order separates the lower ranks of creaturesfrom God depends on the mistaken conception of God as the “first andhighest being,” standing above the angels at the peak of the hierarchy ofbeings. If that were the case, then indeed only the highest beings would bein immediate communion with God. But since God is not any being but “allthings in all things and nothing in any” (DN VII.3, 872A), he does not standat the top of the universal hierarchy but transcends and permeates the whole.“The goodness of the Godhead which is beyond all things extends from thehighest and most venerable substances to the last, and is still above all, thehigher not outstripping its excellence nor the lower going beyond its con-tainment” (DN IV.4, 697C). The entire hierarchy of reality, therefore, fromthe highest seraph to the least speck of dust, is the immediate presence andmanifestation of God, of unity and goodness, according to the different modesand degrees that constitute the different levels of being.It is often said that in teaching that all things are immediately pro-duced by God, Dionysius departs from a Neoplatonic understanding of meta-physical hierarchy, in which each level produces, or causes to be, the nextlevel down. According to this interpretation, for Dionysius, unlike theNeoplatonists, only cognitive “illumination,” and not being, is transmittedthrough the created hierarchy.20 Here again we encounter the supposed dif-ference between Dionysius and Neoplatonism that lies in Dionysius’ denialof a multiplicity of productive divinities subordinate to the One. And hereagain the difference is more apparent than real. One the one hand, as we"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"74THEOPHANYhave seen, all of Proclus’ productive divinities are modalizations of the One,so that all productivity is the One operative at higher and lower levels ofuniversality. On the other hand, in Dionysius, there is no distinction be-tween “direct” production and “hierarchically mediated” illumination. Themaking of all things is theophany, the manifestation or revelation of God,and the “rays” which God sends down into beings are explicitly identified astheir constitutive determinations, their very goodness and being (see e.g. DNI.2, 588CD; IV.1–2, 693B–696D; V.8, 824BC).21 Light is one of the universaldivine names, discussed in chapter IV of the Divine Names along with Good,Beauty, and Love, naming God as he is present in all things whatsoever. Aswe have seen, knowing is the mode of being proper to cognitive beings, andall lesser modes of being are lesser modes of knowing. Hence it is impossibleto distinguish between the transmission of knowledge and the transmissionof being.22 Illumination is production, and in both Dionysius and hisNeoplatonic forebears it is at once direct and hierarchically mediated. Anexamination of how this is so will bring to light the full richness and meta-physical significance of Dionysius’ doctrine of hierarchy.In Plotinus’ system, according to a conventional but superficial read-ing, the One generates Intellect, which in turn generates Soul, which in turngenerates the sensible cosmos; and sensible things, on this view, are notproduced directly by the One but stand at several removes from it. But infact, as we saw in chapter 2, each level is not another being additional to itsprior, as though the One were one thing, Intellect a second, Soul a third,and the sensible a fourth. Rather, each level down is the differentiated ap-pearance, the expression, the unfolding of its prior, so that the content is thesame thoughout all levels, in differing degrees of concentration and diffusion.In producing Intellect, therefore, the One produces all the lower levels, andPlotinus emphasizes that each level is not outside of but is contained in thenext level up: “But Soul is not in the universe, but the universe in it: forbody is not the soul’s place, but Soul is in Intellect and body in Soul, andIntellect in something else [i.e. the One] . . . Where then are the other things?In it” (V.5.9.30–34). And therefore, as Plotinus says here and in many otherplaces, all things, at all levels, are contained in the One: “The last andlowest things, therefore, are in the last of those before them and these arein those prior to them, and one thing is in another up to the first, which isthe Principle. But the Principle, since it has nothing before it, has notanything else to be in; but since . . . the other things are in those whichcome before them, it encompasses all the other things” (V.5.9.6–10).23All the levels of reality, therefore, are the continuous unfolding orpresentation of the One: “All these things are the One and not the One;they are he because they come from him; they are not he, because it is inabiding by himself that he gives them. It is then like a long life stretched outat length; each part is different from that which comes next in order, but thewhole is continuous with itself, but with one part differentiated from an-other, and the earlier does not perish in the later” (V.2.2.25–30). All reality,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"75THE HIERARCHY OF BEINGat every level, depends on unity and indeed is nothing but the differentiatedpresence of unity. “It is by the One that all beings are beings, both thosewhich are primarily beings [i.e. intelligibles] and those which are in any sensesaid to be among beings [i.e. sensibles]” (VI.9.1.1–2; my italics). All that isgiven to cognition in any mode is nothing but the presence of the One, everlessening as we descend from Intellect to the sensible. But where the One isnot present, there is absolutely nothing there for cognition in any modewhatsoever and hence no slightest trace of reality. “[T]here is nothing inwhich it is not . . . [B]ecause it is free from everything it is not preventedfrom being anywhere. For if . . . it was prevented, it would be limited bysomething else, and what comes next would be without a share in it, andGod would go just so far...But if it is not absent from anything and is notanywhere, it is everywhere independent. And one part of it is not here andanother there . . . so that it is everywhere as a whole” (V.5.9.13–25). In theabsence of the One there is simply nothing, not even matter, and the Oneis therefore immediately present to and productive of all things at everylevel, insofar as they can be said to be at all.In Proclus, because of his proliferation of “mean terms” and more rigiddistinctions of ontological items and levels from one another, we mightsuperficially expect to find a greater sense of mediation and of the distanceof sub-divine beings from the One. But in fact, Proclus no less than Plotinusaffirms the One’s immediate causal presence throughout all the levels of hiselaborate metaphysical hierarchy. As we saw in looking at the hierarchy ofuniversality of causal determinations, Proclus explains that absolutely every-thing, including matter, is caused by the One; all things insofar as they haveany form are caused by the One and Being; all living things, by the One,Being, and Life; and so on. Thus it is not the case that anything is producedby a lower level rather than directly by the One itself. When we recall Proclus’argument that a transcendent cause is present to all its effects, it follows thatthe One is productively present throughout all the levels. “In order that ascause it [any transcendent cause] may be in all [•pºrcon ÷n pøsin] that canparticipate in it while as a separate and independent principle it is prior toall the things that are filled from it [tÍn ™p’ a¶to£ plhroum°nwn], it mustbe at once everywhere and nowhere” (El. Th., prop. 98).Here again, the Neoplatonic principle that the lower level is containedin and is the manifestation of the higher is at work. Since a lower, morespecific causal determination is simply a specification of a higher, more uni-versal one, the causal power of the former is not additional to or outside of,but is contained in and indeed simply is that of the latter, operating in amore specific way. “[I]n the activity of the secondary the higher co-operates[sunergeƒ], because all that the secondary makes, the higher cause [t¿aÎtiÔteron] co-generates [sunapogennø ̨ ] with it” (El. Th., prop. 70). Sincethe whole content of an effect, or lower level, is nothing but the participatedpresence of its cause, it follows that the effect’s own causal activity is that ofits cause at work in it. Hence, what is produced by a lower level is (not less"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"76THEOPHANYbut) more produced by the higher. Proclus’ exposition of this principle is soclear that it is worth citing at length, especially since he has so often beenmisunderstood on this point.All that is produced by secondaries is more [meiz¬nwV] producedalso from the prior and more causal terms [aÎtiwt°rwn], from whichthe secondaries are also produced.For if the secondary has its whole being [ ̇lhn...t‹n o¶s√an]from its prior, thence also it receives its power of further production,since productive powers reside in producers in virtue of their beingand fulfil their being. But if it owes to the superior cause its powerof production, to that superior it owes its character as a cause in sofar as it is a cause . . . If so, the things which proceed from it arecaused in virtue of its prior . . . If so, the effect owes to the superiorcause its character as an effect.Again, it is evident that the effect is more from the superiorprinciple. For if the latter has given to the secondary being the cau-sality which enabled it to produce, it must itself have possessed thiscausality primitively . . . But if the secondary is productive by partici-pation, the primal primitively and by communication, the latter iscausative in a greater measure, inasmuch as it has communicated toanother the power of generating consequents. (El. Th., prop. 56)From this it clearly follows that all things at every level are wholly andabsolutely caused by the One, as the supreme and sole causal power, whereofthe causal powers of all things are participations. Since all being, all power,all activity is from the One, nothing can be added to the One’s productivity.The participated productivity of any lesser level is the One operating at thatlevel of specificity. Hence the One is the only causal agency that is at workin all of the subordinate “causes.” Consequently, all things proceed at onceimmediately from the One and from their own priors. Proclus’ doctrine inthis proposition might be expressed by the following diagram:➝➝➝➝12345...➝➝➝➝12345...Not:But rather:"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"77THE HIERARCHY OF BEINGAs this diagram shows, the One immediately produces and is present to theentire sequence of hierarchical mediation. As the productive power of thewhole, it is present throughout the whole.24Hence, as Proclus repeatedly insists, the gods or henads, which as theOne’s “participated terms” are the differentiated presences of the One todifferent beings,25 fill all things: “All that is divine . . . has a potency whichdominates the objects of its providence, a potency past all resisting andwithout all circumscription, in virtue of which the gods have filled all thingswith themselves” (El. Th., prop. 121). Again: “[T]he divine from itself fillsall things with the goods in it” (El. Th., prop. 131). Again: “ ‘[A]ll things arefull of gods [mestΩ d‰ pºnta qeÍn],’ and what each has according to nature,it has from there” (El. Th., prop. 145). And these “gods” or participatedhenads do not separate beings from the unparticipated One, for the verypoint of the distinction between the participated and the unparticipated isthat the transcendent cause is not confined to any one of the participants butis “present [par¬n] to all alike” (El. Th., prop. 23). In short, when Neoplatonicprocession is properly understood in terms of manifestation or unfoldingrather than as the making of additional things outside of and coordinate withthe cause, the supposed opposition between immediate creative presence andmediated production disappears.So also, in Dionysius, there is no opposition, or even distinction,between God’s immediate productive presence to all things and the trans-mission of that presence through the hierarchy of creatures. Each thing’sparticipation in God, its being, lies in its fulfilling its proper place withinthe hierarchical structure of reality. But this means that its participation inGod consists in its rightly relating to other beings, above, below, andcoordinate with it in the universal hierarchy. A being exercises its properactivities, its being, not in isolation but in relation to other beings. Hence,as Dionysius says, the love of all things for God, which is their reversion,their participation in him, and hence their very being, consists in theirlove for each other, according to the proper rank of each: “To all things,then, the Beautiful and Good is desired and beloved and cherished; andthrough it and for the sake of it also the lesser love the greater revertively,and those of the same sort [tΩ ̨m¬stoica] their coordinates communally,and the greater the lesser providentially. . . and all things, by desiring theBeautiful and Good, do and wish all things that they do and wish” (DNIV.10, 708A) The higher being’s love for or participation in God, its being,then, is its providence to the lower, and the lower being’s love for orparticipation in God is its reversion, or receptivity, to the higher. Provid-ing to the lower and reverting to the higher is the very meaning of occu-pying a given position in the hierarchical structure of the whole. Dionysianhierarchy, therefore, has nothing to do with domination and subservience,but only with love, the love of all things for one another which is the loveof God in them all.26"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"78THEOPHANYIt is striking that Dionysius applies the terminology of procession andreversion not only to the relation of beings to God but also to the hierarchi-cal interrelations among beings: the higher proceed or are providential to thelower, and the lower revert to the higher (DN IV.8, 704D; IV.10, 708A;IV.12, 709D; IV.15, 713AB). Beings, then, not only proceed from and revertto God but also proceed from and revert to each other. Thus, for example,angels providentially proceed to men, and men revert, not simply to God,but to angels. And since any being’s proper activity is its mode of participa-tion in God, its procession from and reversion to him, it follows that allthings proceed from and revert to God in proceeding to their subordinatesand reverting to their superiors. Thus the very being of all things, theirprocession from and reversion to God, consists in their hierarchical relationsof procession and reversion to one another.From this it follows that the being of all things consists in their takingpart in God’s making all things to be. Every being has an active role not onlyin its own production but in the production of all things. In that the identityand therefore the being of each thing lies in its hierarchical relations toother things, beings give determination to and receive determination fromone another, and so contribute to one another’s being. As in Proclus, theproductive power which is God runs throughout the hierarchy of reality,exercised by each being as its own proper activity.27 The “light” that istransmitted from one being to another in the hierarchy of beings is beingitself, which is God in all of them. All things, in performing the properactivities which are their being, are participating in the making of the world,taking part in the constitutive divine ordering of the whole. But, as in thecase of the being’s role in its own being produced, this neither adds to nordetracts from God’s immediate production of all things. For God, as Love orDifference itself, is the hierarchical, relational structuring of the whole. Theproper and mutually constitutive activities of beings, their processions andreversions to one another, their love for each other, is the analogous pres-ence of God in each of them.28 Beings take part in the production of them-selves and one another only by participation, which is to say that it is Godwho produces in them. As in Proclus, God himself is the only productiveagency at work throughout the hierarchy. It is thus false to oppose Dionysius’doctrine of direct creation to a Neoplatonic doctrine of mediated produc-tion. For both Proclus and Dionysius, the One, or God, directly produces allthings, in and through one another.29Hence in the Celestial Hierarchy Dionysius says:Perfection for each of those appointed in hierarchy is to be led upaccording to its proper analogy to the imitation of God, and . . . tobecome a co-operator [sunerg¿n] of God and to show the divineactivity revealed in itself [deƒxai t‹n qe√an ÷n°rgeian ÷n...aut ̧ . . . ™nafainom°nhn] as far as possible. As, since the order"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"79THE HIERARCHY OF BEINGof hierarchy is that some are purified and others purify, some areillumined and others illumine, some are perfected and others per-fect, the imitation of God is adapted to each in a certain mode.(CH III.2, 165B)Here Dionysius expressly indicates that the hierarchical activity of the beingis the divine activity manifest in it. This reflects Proclus’ explanation thatthe higher, more universal cause cooperates [sunergeƒ] in producing what-ever the lower cause produces, because the lower is itself nothing but aspecification of the higher. Thus in Dionysius’ account of Isaiah and theangel, the ascription of the angel’s activity to the seraph is justified becauseall the activities of all levels are the presence of God throughout the wholestructure. The being that beings give to and receive from one another inhierarchy is the presence of God in each: “The purpose of hierarchy, then,is likeness and union with God as far as possible . . . making the members ofhis dancing company [to∞V ...auto£ qiasÔtaV] divine images, clear andspotless mirrors, receptive of the original light and thearchic ray and sacredlyfilled with the granted [÷ndidom°nhV30] radiance, and ungrudgingly flaring itup again to the next, according to the thearchic ordinances” (CH III.2,165A). Here Dionysius likens the hierarchy of beings at once to a baccha-nalian dance and to an array of mirrors, all receiving and passing on thedivine light, so that the same light is present throughout the entire structureby means of the structure itself.The central principle of Dionysian hierarchy, then, is immediate media-tion:31 it is by the hierarchical mediation of beings that God is immediatelyconstitutively present to all.32 Acting in each thing as the activity of thatthing, God produces all things in and through each other. All things partici-pate directly in God, i.e. possess being, in giving being to and receiving beingfrom one another, according to the rank of each. Thus Dionysius summarizeshis account of Isaiah and the angel:God is by nature and really properly the source of being illuminedto all those who are illumined, as essence of light and cause of beingitself and of seeing; but by placement33 and in a God-imitating waythat which is higher in rank [is the source] to each thing after, inthat the divine lights are derived to the latter through it . . . Where-fore they ascribe every sacred and God-imitating activity to God, ascause, but to the first deiform intellects as the first effectors andteachers of divine things. (CH III.3, 301D)We may note that Dionysius here associates and indeed identifies “source ofbeing illumined” and “cause of being,” and that “imitation,” in a Neoplatoniccontext, signifies not extrinsic copying but participation, the presence of thearchetype in the image. Hence the light, the being, derived (literally, poured"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"80THEOPHANYthrough a sluice) from the higher to the lower genuinely is God present ineach. This is simply a particular application of the general principle laid outin the Divine Names: “This, the one Beautiful and Good, is singly cause ofall the many beautiful and good things. From this are all the substantialexistences of beings, the unions, the distinctions, the identities, the differ-ences, the likenesses, the unlikenesses, the communions of opposites, theunconfusions of united things, the providences of the higher, the mutualsupports of the co-ordinates, the reversions of the inferiors” (DN IV.7, 704B).The processions of the higher to the lower, the communions of coordinates,and the reversions of the lower to the higher, are the Good, or Love, presentthoughout all as the being of each.Fundamentally, this is because what all things participate in, eachaccording to its rank, is God who is Love, Ecstasy, Overflow itself. Since inGod, as Love, interiority coincides with exteriority, so for any being, itsinteriority, its identity, its selfhood, which is the presence of God in it,coincides with its exteriority, its relations with other beings. The hierarchi-cal activity of beings, their love for one another, is the presence in them ofLove itself. Since what all things receive, or participate in, as their being, isGiving itself, therefore to be, to participate in God, is to give. Hence it is ingiving to each other that all things participate in God, or are.34 Or again, sinceGod is pure Openness, the donative openness of the higher to the lower andthe receptive openness of the lower to the higher is the presence of God ineach. The love of beings for each other, which is the activity of hierarchy, isthe Love which is God whirling through all things as their being.In Dionysius’ metaphysics, then, there is no such thing as an indi-vidual, a being conceived as a closed, self-contained unit which extrinsicallyenters into relations with other beings. Because the principle of reality ispure Openness or Giving, the very identity, the being of each thing, God-in-it, is its giving to and receiving from others. Each thing, indeed, is noth-ing but its relations to others, its place within the structure of immediatemediation.35 Hierarchy is thus, as its name signifies, the principle of sacred-ness, which is to say of being.36 Nothing could be farther from the supposed“immovability” of Dionysian hierarchy37 than this vision of being aspericÔrhsiV, as the Great Dance in which all beings are only in and througheach other.38 “The divine intellects are said to be moved cyclically, unitedto the illuminations, without beginning and without end, of the Beautifuland Good; but in a straight line, whenever they proceed for the providenceof their inferiors . . . ; but spirally, because even in providing for the inferiorthey remain not gone out [™nekfoit–twV39] in identity around the beautifuland good cause of identity, ceaselessly dancing around [pericore§onteV]”(DN IV.8, 704D–705A). Although this is said specifically of the angels, itclearly applies to all things, since all things remain fixed in their identitiesin proceeding to their subordinates. Hence Dionysius describes hierarchy asa q√asoV, a bacchic revel whose members ecstatically share in divinity.40"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"81THE HIERARCHY OF BEINGDionysian hierarchy is none other than the communion of saints,41 which, asa communion of intelligences, is itself the fullness of being. The hierarchicalstructure of reality is the articulated manifestation of the divine love thatconstitutes all things. Love itself, says Dionysius, is “a power unifying andconnective and differentiatingly combining, pre-existing in the Beautiful andGood through the Beautiful and Good and given out from the Beautifuland Good through the Beautiful and Good, and holding together co-ordinatesaccording to their mutual communion, moving the first things to providencefor their inferiors, and establishing the inferiors in reversion to their superiors”(DN IV.12, 709C; cf. DN IV.15, 713AB)."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTHE CONTINUUM OF COGNITIONA sharp dichotomy and dualism between sense and intellect, as two differentcognitive faculties apprehending two different kinds of objects, is conven-tionally regarded as perhaps the most fundamental feature of Platonic thought,elaborated in Neoplatonism and adopted by Dionysius.1 But this is in fact amisunderstanding not only of Dionysius but of the entire Platonic tradition.A more careful examination reveals that in this tradition sense and intellect,with discursive reason as a mean between them, constitute a continuum ofmodes of cognition, articulated by the degrees of unity in which they appre-hend reality. Thus Dionysius groups irrational animals, humans, and angelstogether as participants in Wisdom, i.e. cognition or consciousness in gen-eral, and then hierarchically subdivides Wisdom into intellection, discursivereason, and sense perception, loosely correlated with angels, human souls,and animals, respectively. The correlation is loose because, in Dionysius asin Plotinus, the human soul can, so to speak, move up and down the scale:although its proper cognitive activity is discursive reason, it also, obviously,engages in sense perception, and according to Dionysius it can ascend to thelevel of angelic intellection and beyond. This very elasticity on the part ofthe soul indicates that the different modes of cognition are a continuum oflevels in what is fundamentally the same activity. In turn, Neoplatonic andDionysian “mysticism,” the passage beyond being and intellect, is the exten-sion and completion of this continuum.In Plato, the Parmenidean principle that to be is to be intelligibledevelops into an identification between levels of cognitive apprehension andlevels of reality. Forms are real beings precisely in that they are what isperfectly intelligible; sensibles are less than really real in that they exhibitintelligible natures which they themselves are not, and hence are not beingsbut multiple, differentiated appearances of unitary forms.2 But therefore, forPlato, the ascent of the soul from sense to intellect, illustrated by the chariotflight in the Phaedrus, the emergence from the cave in the Republic, the83"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"84THEOPHANYseparation of soul from body in the Phaedo, is not a passage from one “world”or set of objects to another. It is rather, as Plato’s references to “shadows,”“puppets,” and other “images” indicate, a passage from appearance to reality,and consists in a progressive unification of the content of consciousness, asthe soul passes from the many different sensible presentations of a form tothe one intelligible reality: “Man must understand what is said according toform, going from many sense-perceptions to a one gathered together by rea-soning” (Phaedrus 249b6–c2). And because this ascent is a deepening com-munion of consciousness with reality, Plato expresses the soul’s intellectualapprehension of the forms not only by the metaphor of vision but also bymetaphors of sexual union and of eating, the soul’s uniting with being andtaking it into itself (Phaedrus 247e2–6; Republic 490a8–b7).Aristotle’s theory of knowledge can be seen as an extended reflectionon such an understanding of consciousness as a communion of the soul withreality. Most basically, to be aware of something is to have it present to orin oneself. The things that I see or hear, the ideas that I think, are in me,as the content of my consciousness. Hence Aristotle argues that all cognitionis an identity of some kind between subject and object. In the case of senseperception, the identity is not absolute but only qualitative (On the Soul II.5,418a3–7): to sense a thing is to receive into oneself the sensible forms orqualities of the thing, without the matter (On the Soul II.12, 424a17–18). Inthe case of intellectual consciousness, however, the object itself is pure form oridea without matter, and therefore the identity between thought and its objectis complete: “[I]n the case of objects which involve no matter, what thinks andwhat is thought are identical; for speculative knowledge and its object are iden-tical” (On the Soul III.4, 430a3–5; cf. Metaphysics XII.9, 1075a2–4). Intellect isthus strictly identical with its intelligible object, having that idea as its contentand hence as what the intellect itself is in that act of thinking.Plotinus takes up this Aristotelian understanding of consciousness intothe Platonic doctrine of being as form to arrive at the identity of being andconsciousness which is a hallmark of his philosophy. If being is what isapprehended by thought, and thought is what it apprehends, then being isthought and thought is being. The sensible cosmos, Soul, and Intellect aretherefore best understood not as a series of “worlds” or objects stacked oneon top of another, but rather, to use Hadot’s excellent phrase, “levels of theself,” levels at which we, as consciousness, can be.3 The standard translationof no£V in Plotinus as “Intellect” (with a capital “I”) tends to obscure this,promoting an imagination of Intellect as a static “thing,” located above thesensible world and Soul. But in fact, no£V for Plotinus is not a substancewhich exercises n¬hsiV, the act of intellection, but is that activity itself. “Ifthen [the intelligible] is activity [÷n°rgeia], and the first activity and thefairest, it is the first intellection and substantial intellection . . . but an intel-lection of this kind which is primary and primarily intellective will be thefirst Intellect; for this Intellect is not potential, nor is it one and its intellec-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"85THE CONTINUUM OF COGNITIONtion another” (V.3.5.37–41; see also, e.g., V.9.5.1–10). Plotinian Intellect,then, is pure consciousness, consciousness itself at the highest level.It is as pure consciousness, or thought, that Intellect is identical withbeing. For consciousness, as we have seen, means the communion or “togeth-erness” of subject and object. Hence consciousness is perfect only when theyare one, and anything less than this unity is less than perfect consciousness.As Plotinus explains, “This is the reason, I think, why there is no truth inthe senses, only opinion: opinion is opinion because it receives, and what itreceives is different from that from which it receives it” (V.5.1.62–66). Be-cause sense is not fully one with that which it perceives, sense perception isnot strictly “true,” and such consciousness is not perfect thought.4 In the caseof Intellect, therefore,if what are in it are impressions of [the objects contemplated], thenit does not have them themselves; but if it has them themselves . . .the contemplation must be the same as the contemplated, and In-tellect the same as the intelligible; for, if not the same, there willnot be truth; for the one who is trying to possess realities will possessan impression different from the realities, and this is not truth . . . Inthis way, therefore, Intellect and the intelligible are one, and this isreality and the first reality, and also the first Intellect which pos-sesses the real beings, or rather is the same as the real beings.5(V.3.5.19–29)“We have here, then, one nature, Intellect, all realities, and truth” (V.5.3.1–2). This unity of thought and reality, consciousness in its purity and perfec-tion, is what Plotinus means by Intellect.Intellect, or intellection, is thus genuinely analogous to vision, as abringing together of subject and object. In sense vision, the subject “reachesout,” extends its gaze toward the object, and the object is taken into thesubject’s awareness. Sense perception, as a mode of consciousness, is a partialovercoming of the separation between subject and object, self and reality. Inintellectual vision or intuition (n¬hsiV), this is perfected, for there is noexternality or “distance” between the self and reality, and so they are one.“For there is no longer one thing outside and another outside which islooking at it, but the keen sighted has what is seen within . . . But one musttransport what one sees into oneself, and look at it as one and look at it asoneself ” (V.8.10.33–42). And again, “If he sees it as something different, heis not yet in beauty [i.e. being, as form], but he is in it most perfectly whenhe becomes it. If therefore sight is of something external we must not havesight, or only that which is identical with its object” (V.8.11.20–23).Intellect, therefore, is perfect consciousness in that it is the knowledgeof being as its own content and therefore as itself. As such it is not an objectfixed up above in metaphysical space but an activity that we ourselves, as"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"86THEOPHANYconsciousness, can be: “A man has certainly become Intellect when he letsall the rest which belongs to him go and looks at this with this and himselfwith himself: that is, it is as Intellect he sees himself” (V.3.4.25–32). Theself, at the level of Intellect, is Intellect, which means that it is all things.Hence the ascent to Intellect is also an inward turn of consciousness, wherebywe encounter reality not, as by sense, external to the self, but as the contentof thought and thus within the self. “Let him who can, follow and comewithin, and leave outside the sight of his eyes and not turn back to thebodily splendours which he saw before” (I.6.8.4–6). But this inward turn isnot a self-isolation, a cutting off of oneself from reality. Rather, by turninginward we have and know all of reality in and as the self, and we know theself in and as all things. By turning inward we are not less but more perfectlyunited with all things:If then we have a part in true knowledge, we are [the intelligibles] . . .So then, being together with all things, we are those: so then, weare all and one. So therefore when we look outside that on whichwe depend we do not know that we are one, like faces which aremany on the outside but have one head inside. But if someone isable to turn around . . . he will see God and himself and the All...;when he has nowhere to set himself and limit himself and deter-mine how far he himself goes, he will stop marking himself off fromall being. (VI.5.7.3–16)And again, “You will increase yourself then by rejecting all else, and the Allwill be present to you in your rejection” (VI.5.12.24–25). It is not the con-templative inward turn but rather the externality of sense that separates theself, as subject, from all else, as external object.6As the vision of reality in and as itself, Intellect grasps all being, in itsmultiplicity, not piecemeal or sequentially but in a single complex intuition:“Intellect is the beings, possessing all things . . . as possessing itself and beingone with them. ‘All things are together’ there, and none the less they areseparate . . . Intellect is all things together and also not together, becauseeach is a special power” (V.9.6.1–4, 8–9). All things as grasped in intellectare both “together” and “not together” in that the forms are distinct, and areintelligible only because they are distinct, but each one implies and thereforecontains all the others (see e.g. V.9.8.3–7). Each being, therefore, is thewhole of being in a distinct way, which is why Plotinus describes being orintellect, intelligible reality as a whole, as “one-many” (e.g. V.3.15.23). Atthe level of intellection, then, cognition knows all the forms in knowingeach one of them: “[A]ll things there are transparent, and there is nothingdark or opaque; everything and all things are clear to the inmost part toeverything . . . Each there has all things in itself and sees all things in everyother, so that all are everywhere and each and every one is all . . . A different"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"87THE CONTINUUM OF COGNITIONkind of being stands out in each, but in each all are manifest . . . [E]ach . . . ispart and whole at once: it has the appearance of a part, but a penetrating looksees the whole in it” (V.8.4.6–12, 22–25). Intellection, then, is the apprehen-sion of being, as a whole, in a complex but unified vision, and being itself isnot a static series of lifeless forms but a communion of living intelligences.Discursive reason, the lower mode of cognition that Plotinus associateswith soul as distinct from Intellect, is an “unfolded” or extended vision of thesame content, an apprehension of being not all at once and as a whole butsequentially: “For around Soul things come one after another: now Socrates,now horse, always some one of beings; but Intellect is all things” (V.1.4.20–22). Plotinus illustrates this difference by referring to ideogrammatic Egyp-tian hieroglyphs, which represent “the non-discursiveness of the intelligibleworld, that is, that every image is a kind of knowledge and wisdom . . . alltogether in one, and not discourse or deliberation. But [only] afterwards[others] discovered, starting from it in its concentrated unity, a representa-tion in something else, already unfolded and speaking the same discursively[l°gon a•t¿ ÷n diex¬d ̄]” (V.8.6.7–11). Discursive reason, then, appre-hends the same content as intellection, but in greater multiplicity. As theunfolded representation of intellection in soul, discursive reason functions asa mean between the unity of the forms in Intellect and the still greaterdispersion at the level of sense. “And the offspring of Intellect [i.e. soul] isa rational form and an existing being, that which thinks discursively; it isthis which moves around Intellect . . . united to it on one side and so filledwith it and enjoying it and sharing in it and thinking, but, on the other side,in touch with the things which came after it” (V.1.7.42–47), i.e. the sen-sible. Soul, as the locus of discursive reason, brings the multiplicity of senseimpressions which it receives “from below” under the unity of the formswhich it receives “from above” (see e.g. V.3.2.8–13). Soul makes discursivejudgments, unifying its manifold of sense impressions into definite, identifiedobjects by means of the impressions of the forms which it has from Intellect.Such cognition is thus more unified than mere sensation but less unified thanpure intellection.Sense, in turn, is a still more “unfolded” vision of being, the lowest,least unified mode of cognition. Each form is a single intelligible reality, butappears to sense “here and there,” at many different points in space and time.“For it is sense-perception, to which we are paying attention when we dis-believe what is being said, which says that it is here and there, but reasonsays that the ‘here and there’ has not come about by its being extended butthe whole of what is extended has participated in it, while it is not itselfspaced out” (VI.4.13.2–6).7 Just as it is the distinction of forms from oneanother in Intellect that constitutes them as not the One itself but appear-ances or manifestations of the One, so also it is precisely the multiplicity, theseparation of sensible instances from each other, that constitutes them as notthe forms themselves but appearances of them."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"88THEOPHANYIntellect and sense, therefore, as modes of cognition, are not apprehen-sions of different “worlds” or sets of objects, but are more and less unifiedapprehensions of being, the only object of all cognition. The sensible cosmosas a whole is the sensuous apprehension of being, being as apprehended,most multiply, by sense, and the intelligible cosmos is the same content asapprehended, most unitarily, by intellectual intuition. The sensible and theintelligible are not two worlds, but rather the same reality, the manifestationof the One, apprehended in differing degrees of unity.8 The ascent to intel-lection is thus not a passage from one set of objects to another, but a gath-ering of the content of consciousness into greater unity. To imagine thisascent, Plotinus says, we should “apprehend in our thought this visible uni-verse, with each of its parts remaining what it is without confusion, gather-ing all of them together into one as far as we can . . . Let there be, then, in thesoul a shining imagination of a sphere, having everything within it . . . Keepthis, and apprehend in your mind another, taking away the mass: take awayalso the places, and the mental picture of matter in yourself ” (V.8.9.1–13).That is, we must retain the same content and remove the dilution or disten-sion in which it is apprehended at the level of sense. In ascending from senseto intellection, therefore, we do not abandon or lose anything. The notionthat in rising to the intellection of the forms we leave sensibles behind is anaspect of the false dualism that views sensibles as real beings and thereforeregards sensibles and intelligibles as two different sets of objects. Once wecorrectly understand sensibles as nothing but differentiated appearances offorms, we see that in rising from sense to intellect we leave nothing behind,just as in turning from a multiplicity of beautiful reflections to the one realitybeing reflected we lose nothing of what we saw in the mirrors.Therefore in Intellect, or intellectual consciousness, we find more trulyall the same content that is given to sense.And certainly the sky there [i.e. in Intellect] must be a living being,and so a sky not bare of stars, as we call them here below, and thisis what being sky is. But obviously there is earth also, not barren,but much more full of life, and all animals are in it . . . and, obvi-ously, plants rooted in life; and sea is there, and all water in abidingflow and life, and all the living beings in water . . . For as each of thegreat parts of the universe is there, so is of necessity the nature ofthe living beings in them. (VI.7.12.4–17)Plotinus summarizes this account of Intellect by saying that it is “as if therewas one quality which held and kept intact all the qualities in itself, ofsweetness along with fragrance, and was at once the quality of wine and thecharacters of all tastes, the sights of colours and all the awarenesses of touch,and all that hearings hear, all tunes and every rhythm” (VI.7.12.26–30).This strikingly sensuous description of intelligible reality drives home the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"89THE CONTINUUM OF COGNITIONpoint that intellectual experience is far more rich, not less, than sense ex-perience, because it apprehends in concentrated unity, although not withoutdistinction, all the same content that sense apprehends in extended, “di-luted” multiplicity.The understanding of intellection and sense perception as higher andlower modes on a continuum of cognition emerges most clearly when Plotinusasks how sense perception could be present in the archetypal, intelligibleman if there were no objects for it “there,” in the intelligible (VI.7.3.22ff).His answer is that sense perception at the intellectual level “would be apower of perceiving the sense-objects there, and would correspond to thesense-objects there. . . For if there were bodies there, the soul [i.e. the higher,intellectual soul] had perceptions and apprehensions of them; and the manthere, the soul of this kind, was able to apprehend these bodies” (VI.7.6.1–11). In some sense, then, there are sensibles or bodies at the intelligiblelevel, and a corresponding faculty for apprehending them which can there-fore be called “sense perception.”9 The meaning of this surprising claim be-comes clearer in the conclusion of the discussion:[T]his man here below has his powers from that intelligible man andlooks to those realities, and these sense-objects are linked to thisman and those others to that; for those sense-objects [i.e., the onesat the intelligible level], which we called so because they are bodies,are apprehended in a different way; and . . . this sense-perception isdimmer than the apprehension there in the intelligible, which wecalled sense-perception because it is of bodies and which is clearer.And for this reason this man here has sense-perception, because hehas a lesser apprehension of lesser things, images of those intelligiblerealities; so that these sense-perceptions here are dim intellections, but theintellections there are clear sense-perceptions. (VI.7.7.23–32; my italics)In other words, intellection itself is the intelligible paradigm of which senseperception is the unfolded expression. This remarkable passage indicates thatthere are bodies in Intellect in that, since sensible bodies are images orappearances of forms, intelligible forms are genuine or archetypal bodies.Since the bodies perceived by sense are forms dimly apprehended, the formsgrasped by intellect are bodies clearly apprehended. Correlatively, as lowerand higher points on the continuum of cognition, sense perception is dimintellection, and intellection is clear sense perception.This Neoplatonic understanding of consciousness in relation to beingunderlies Dionysius’ gnoseology. For him, as for Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus,all cognition is a union of subject and object: “Knowledge is unitive of thosewho know and the things known [≠ gnÍsiV ...nwtik‹ tÍn ÷gnwk¬twn ka¥÷gnwsm°nwn]” (DN VII.4, 872D).10 The perfect case of this unity is foundat the intellectual level, where, as in Plotinus, the subject is one with its"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"90THEOPHANYactivity and with its object: “The unified divine intellects [i.e. angels] areunited to their intellections and to the things thought [toƒV nooum°noiV]”(DN XI.2, 949C). Such cognition is the most simple or unified mode ofconsciousness, grasping its contents all at once, without the extension anddivision found in discursive reason and sense:From [God as Wisdom] the intelligible and intellectual powers ofthe angelic intellects have their simple and blessed intellections.Not in parts or from parts or sense-perceptions or discursive reason-ings do they gather divine knowledge . . . but purified from every-thing material and multiple, intellectually, immaterially, uniformly,they think [noo£sin] the intelligibles of divine things. And forthem the intellectual power and activity . . . is synoptic [sunoptik‹]of the divine intellections. (DN VII.2, 868B)Dionysius proceeds to present discursive reason, proper to human souls, asinferior to angelic intellection precisely in that it is less unified: “Throughthe divine Wisdom souls, too, have their rational faculty discursively, goingin a circle around the truth of beings, and by what is divided and manifoldof diversity falling short of the unified intellects, but, by the drawing togetherof the many to the one made worthy, insofar as is proper and possible forsouls, of intellections equal to the angels’ ” (DN VII.2, 868BC). Finally,Dionysius remarks that “one would not miss the mark in saying that evensense-perceptions themselves are an echo of Wisdom” (DN VII.2, 868C).This parallels Plotinus’ account of sense perceptions as “dim intellections.”Sense perception is an “echo of Wisdom” in that, as a mode of cognition, itis still a consciousness, however “dim” or diffuse, of being. Hence even thelowest animal, in that it has sensation and thus some awareness of reality, isa participant in God as Wisdom.As Dionysius here indicates, however, human souls are not confined tothe level of discursive reason, but, as in Plotinus, can ascend to the level ofintellection and beyond. He repeatedly presents the angels as paradigms forhuman cognition, describing our attainment of intellection as equality with,imitation of, or union with the angels (DN I.4, 592C; DN IV.9, 705A; DNVII.2, 868C).11 Using a traditional Neoplatonic analogy, he ascribes to soulthree “motions,” circular, spiral, and linear, corresponding to intellection,discursive reason, and sense perception.The circular motion of soul is the entrance into itself from thingsoutside and the uniform drawing together of its intellectual powerswhich gives it inerrancy, and reverting it from the many thingsoutside, and gathering it first to itself, then uniting it, as havingbecome uniform, to the uniformly united powers, and thus leadingto the Beautiful and Good above all beings . . ."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"91THE CONTINUUM OF COGNITIONBut soul is moved spirally insofar as it is illumined by divineknowledges in a manner proper to itself, not intellectually anduniformly but rationally and discursively and, as it were, by mixedand transitive activities.But in a straight line, when it is moved, not entering intoitself and in unitary intellectuality (for this, as I said, is circular),but proceeding toward the things around itself, and from the thingsoutside, as from certain variegated and multiplied symbols, is gath-ered toward simple and unified contemplations.12 (DN IV.9, 705AB)Here intellection, as in Plotinus, is an inward turn, a concentration andunification of the consciousness, while sense perception is an externalizationand multiplication of it, so that here again, the modes of cognition aredistinguished by their degrees of unity. Hence human souls, by unificationand interiority, can become intellects equal to the angels, and like themunited to their intellectual acts and to their objects. It is only in union withthe angels, as a community of intelligences like Plotinus’ Intellect, that weare united with God.For Dionysius as for Plotinus, then, sense, discursive reason, and intel-lection represent different points on a continuum of degrees of unity in theapprehension of reality. We can know and thus possess or be united withbeing most multiply by sense, in a more unified way by discursive reason, andin a more unified way still by intellection.13 Here as in any Neoplatonichierarchy, the same content and activity are found at every level, in higherand lower, more and less unified ways. Hence the higher level lacks nothingthat the lower possesses but contains it in a higher way, while the lower hasall that the higher possesses in a lower way. This is the basis of Proclus’doctrine that what is known is known according to the mode not of theobject but of the knower: “For if the gods have all their attributes in a modeconsonant with their character as gods . . . , it is surely manifest that theirknowledge, being a divine property, will be determined not by the nature ofthe inferior beings which are its object but by their own transcendent maj-esty” (El. Th., prop. 124). Thus beings at a higher level of cognitive activityknow all that falls below that mode in their superior cognition, just as, inPlotinus, intellect apprehends in a higher way all that is given to sense. Soalso, Dionysius explains that the angels, having intellection rather than sen-sation, are not therefore ignorant of sensibles, as if they were unable toapprehend them because they have no sense faculties. Rather, “the angelsknow . . . the things on earth, knowing them not by sense-perceptions (al-though they are sensible things), but by the proper power and nature of thedeiform intellect” (DN VII.2, 869C). The higher power and activity in-cludes, rather than excludes, the lower. By implication, then, for a humansoul to ascend to the angelic or intellectual level is not for it to lose aware-ness of sensibles but know them in a higher, intellectual way. Here again, to"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"92THEOPHANYascend is not to leave some objects and go to others, but to know the samecontent, reality, in a superior mode.For both Plotinus and Dionysius, then, all consciousness is the appre-hension, at higher and lower levels, of being. But this means that the One,or God, is not the object of the highest mode of cognition, as if he weremerely the highest being. Rather, the One is beyond all cognitive appre-hension whatsoever, and, conversely, all consciousness is the reception ofthe One in differentiated multiplicity. This is in fact simply another sideof the doctrine that being is the manifestation of the One. Manifestation,or appearance, necessarily takes place to and in consciousness as its con-stitutive content, what consciousness itself is. Being is not only the appear-ance but the apprehension of the One, and this is precisely what Plotinusmeans by Intellect. “That which is generated, when it has come into being,reverts to the One and is filled, and becomes Intellect by looking towardsit. Its halt and turning towards the One constitutes being, its gaze upon theOne, Intellect. Since it halts and turns towards the One that it may see,it becomes at once Intellect and being” (V.2.1.10–14).14 But all other modesof cognition, and therefore of being, are lesser, “dimmer” intellections.“And every life is a thought [n¬hs√V tiV], but one is dimmer than another,just as life [has degrees of clarity and strength]” (III.8.8.16–18). Hence allconsciousness, including sense perception or even lower levels such as the“growth-thought” which is the life of a plant, or even the analogous life ofminerals, is the differentiated vision and manifestation of the One at higherand lower levels.15The doctrine, strongly implicit throughout Neoplatonism, that allcognition is the apprehension, at higher and lower levels, of the One or God,becomes fully explicit in Dionysius. For Dionysius as for Plotinus and Proclus,it is emphatically not the case that God is inaccessible to sense but accessibleto intellectual contemplation. Rather, Dionysius says, God is the object of allcognition, even sense perception, and of none, even intellection. Since allcognition is the apprehension of being, and God is not any being, he isinaccessible to intellect no less than to sense: “It is necessary to ask how weknow God, who is neither intelligible nor sensible [o¶d‰ noht¿n o¶d‰aÎsqht¿n] nor any of beings whatsoever” (DN VII.3, 869C). And con-versely, since all cognition is the apprehension of being, and being istheophany, God is accessible to sense no less than to intellect:God is known both through knowledge [gnÔsewV] and throughunknowing. And of him there is both intellection and reason andknowledge [÷pist–mh] and touching and sense-perception and opin-ion and imagination and name and all other things; and he is nei-ther thought [noeƒtai] nor spoken [l°getai] nor named. And he isnot any of beings, nor is he known in any of beings. And he is allthings in all things and nothing in any, and he is known to all fromall and to none from any.16 (DN VII.3, 872A)"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"93THE CONTINUUM OF COGNITIONBecause God is all things in all things, to see anything is to see God in thatthing. All knowledge is knowledge of God because all being, all that is givento consciousness in any mode, is nothing but the finite, differentiated presen-tation of God. Since all things are nothing but God-in-them, there is noth-ing to be known in anything but God-in-it.17“Of God there is sense-perception”: this stunning but wholly consis-tent affirmation cannot be overemphasized. It overturns all conventionalmisrepresentations of Neoplatonism in general, and Dionysius’ thought inparticular, as a “gnostic” repudiation of the senses and the sensible world.Since sense perception is an apprehension, a taking into oneself, of reality,however multiple, dim, or echoic it may be, it is an apprehension of theophany,of God as given to consciousness, for that is what reality is. This is whyDionysius revels in the contemplation of colors, shapes, sounds, scents, tastes:in all that we perceive, in our every sense-experience, we are encounteringGod,18 and the same content, the same glorious theophany, is found not lessbut more intensely as we ascend to higher modes of cognition.19 The claimthat there is sense perception of God cannot be separated from Dionysius’account of God as Beauty, of the beauty seen in all things as the manifestpresence of God in them. As he says a few lines later, “The knowledge ofGod . . . can be known, as I said, from all things; for it is . . . the cause,productive of all things and always fitting all things together, of the indis-soluble adaptation and order of all things, and always conjoining the endsof the first things to the beginnings of the second, and beautifying[kalliergo£sa] the one agreement and harmony of all” (DN VII.3, 872B).If, as Aristotle says, all men naturally take delight in sense perception (Meta-physics I.1, 980a23), this is because it is our first and most basic encounterwith being. And being, for Dionysius, is theophany, or we might say“agathophany,” the presentation to consciousness of the Good, and as suchis delightful and attractive, that is, beautiful.The knowledge of God, then, is given to sense no less than to intellect.Conversely, since God is the object of all cognition and of none rather thanmerely the object of the highest cognition, the cognitive ascent does not endwith intellect. It extends beyond intellect to culminate in “the darkness ofunknowing” (MT I.3, 1001A) or “the union above intellect” (DN VII.3,872B; XI.2, 949D), a vision of or union with God which transcends allcognition whatsoever. Hence an account of Dionysius’ gnoseology must extendfrom sense perception at one extreme to “mysticism” at the other. But herewe must remember that in Dionysius, as in Plotinus and throughout theNeoplatonic tradition, “mysticism,” the passage beyond thought and being,must be understood as an aspect of philosophical metaphysics and gnoseology,not an extrinsic, non-philosophical addition to them.20 Understood in thisway, Plotinian and Dionysian “mysticism” emerges as the completion of theprogressive ascent from sense to discursive reason to intellect.Since the One is not any being and therefore, as Plotinus says, toattain the One we must “not think” (V.3.13.33),21 it might seem that for"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"94THEOPHANYPlotinus the “mystical” union with the One is discontinuous with the cog-nitive ascent. To see the One we must “take away everything [Òfele pºnta]”(V.3.17.39), i.e. all beings, the objects and content of thought. This mightseem to indicate that we must abandon being, leave it behind, and turninstead to the One as another object encountered in a super-cognitive mode.But this is a misunderstanding strictly analogous to the mistaken notion thatin ascending to Intellect we must abandon the sensible. Just as to ascendfrom sense to Intellect is not to leave the content of sense behind but togather it into greater unity, so to ascend from Intellect to the One is togather the same content into still greater unity. But since Intellect, as atonce thought and being, necessarily involves distinction and therefore mul-tiplicity, to gather its content into absolute unity is to pass beyond thoughtand being. Just as the intelligible is the complicatio of the sensible, so the Oneis the complicatio of the intelligible: not another object over against being,but the same content in absolute concentration, all things without distinc-tion (see V.3.16.6–16).22 As the sensible is the image, in the sense of thedifferentiated appearance, of the intelligible, so the intelligible, or being, isthe image or differentiated appearance of the One. Thus the ascent fromsense to Intellect to the One is a continuous passage from appearance to thatwhich appears, from “image to original” (VI.9.11.45), in which nothing isleft behind. To pass from the intellectual apprehension of being to the“mystical” encounter with the One is, once again, like turning from a mul-tiplicity of reflections to that which is being reflected. Since being, as thecontent of thought, is appearance, to transcend appearance altogether, to goabsolutely from “image to original,” is to transcend being and cognition.It is significant that when Plotinus enjoins us to “take away every-thing,” “everything” is in fact in the plural, not pøn but pºnta, literally “allthings.” It is all things in their plurality, as a multiplicity of distinct, intel-ligible beings, that must be transcended. But this going beyond all things intheir plurality, and hence as beings, is therefore the completion of the in-ward turn, the peak of the ascending unification of consciousness that wehave traced from sense to discursive reason to intellection. Even Intellect,the most unified mode of cognition, necessarily demands and consists ofdistinctions, and so still involves a looking “outward” into the multiplicityof beings. But since the One is not any thing but the enfolding of all things,Plotinus instructs us to “contemplate it without casting your thought out-wards. For it does not lie somewhere leaving the other things empty of it, butis always present to anyone who is able to touch it” (VI.9.7.3–5). To risefrom Intellect to the One, therefore, “the soul must let go of all outwardthings and turn altogether to what is within, and not be inclined to anyoutward thing, but unknowing all things (as it did formerly in sense-perception,but then in the realm of forms, and even unknowing itself, come to be incontemplation of that One” (VI.9.7.17–21). Here Plotinus makes the anal-ogy explicit: as intellection is to sense perception, so the “vision” of the One"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"95THE CONTINUUM OF COGNITIONis to intellection, and hence the ascent from Intellect to the One is a continu-ation, an intensification of the inward turn of consciousness into unity. Theascent might be likened to hearing a sound that gradually increases in pitchuntil it passes beyond the range of hearing. In one sense, there is discontinuity:we go from hearing to not hearing, from sound to silence. So also, in ascendingfrom Intellect to the One, we go from thinking to not thinking, from being tonot any being. But, as with the sound, in another sense there is continuity, forthe transition takes place through the continuation of the process by which wereached the highest level of cognition.Since the levels of reality are levels of the self, the One, as the enfold-ing of all things, is the highest and inmost level, the absolute enfolding ofthe self (see V.1.10.1–7, V.1.11.7–11). Hence the mystical union with theOne is the complete unification of the self, as a cognitive subject. ThusPlotinus says that in using the name One we are “wanting to unify our souls”(VI.9.5.41–42) and that if someone fails to attain the One it is because heis “not yet brought together into unity” (VI.9.4.24). Therefore, the “vision”of the One is “an ecstasy and simplification and giving up of the self [⁄kstasiVka¥ ̋plwsiV ka¥ ÷p√dosiV a•tou]” (VI.9.11.23).23 This “simplification” ofthe self is an ecstasy or standing outside of the self and a giving up of theself because form, or distinction, is the essence of thought and being, so thatin overcoming all distinctions in its content, the self is no longer conscious-ness and being. To achieve absolute unification is to pass beyond being:“[O]ne becomes, not being, but ‘beyond being’ by this converse” (VI.9.11.42–43). Since the otherness of being from the One is the otherness of beingsfrom each other, the complete unification of the self is the union of the selfwith the One. “That One, therefore, since it has no otherness is alwayspresent, and we are present to it when we have no otherness” (VI.9.8.34–35). Although in its immediate context this refers to the otherness of the selffrom the One, that otherness consists in the multiplicity or otherness ofconsciousness within the self. The passage of the self beyond thought andbeing into the One is thus not only discontinuous but also continuous withthe ascent from sense to Intellect, as the intensifying unification of thecontent of consciousness and the progressively deepening inward turn.In accord with the Neoplatonic understanding of being and cognitionas necessarily involving multiplicity, Dionysius frequently refers to the soul’sor mind’s transcending of intellection as “the union above intellect,” orsimply as “union.” This refers at once to the union with God and to theunification of the self, for these, as we have just seen in looking at Plotinus,are identical.The unions, appropriate to angels, of the holy powers, whether theyshould be called applications or receptions [÷pibolΩV e≥teparadocΩV] of the Goodness beyond unknowing and beyond light,are ineffable and unknown . . . The deiform intellects, unified by"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"96THEOPHANYthese in a manner imitating the angels as far as possible—since inthe cessation of every intellectual activity such a union of the deified[÷kqeoum°nwn] intellects to the super-divine light comes about—hymn it most properly through the taking away [™fair°sewV] of allbeings.24 (DN I.5, 593BC)Here it is the minds (both angelic and human) which are themselves unifiedthat are united to the light beyond divinity. The union of the mind itself,which as union transcends the act of intellection, is its union with God: “Itis necessary to know that the intellect in us has on the one hand a powerfor intellection, through which it beholds intelligible things, and on theother hand the union exceeding the nature of intellect, through which it isjoined with the things beyond itself ” (DN VII.1, 865CD).25But, as in Plotinus, this union which goes beyond intellect is continu-ous with the cognitive ascent. As the soul ascends from sense to discursivereason to intellect, it gathers its content into ever greater unity. At the peak,when absolute unification is achieved, intellectual knowledge passes overinto the silence of unknowing: “Souls, uniting and gathering their manifoldreasonings into one intellectual purity, go forth in the way and order properto them through immaterial and undivided intellection to the union aboveintellection” (DN XI.2, 949D). Here Dionysius explicitly presents the ascentfrom discursive reason to intellection to mystical union as a continuous,progressive unification. Since God is not something else besides all beingsbut rather no thing as the complicatio of all things, the mystical unknowingof God as no thing is the inseparable completion of the knowledge of God,by every mode of cognition, as all things in all things. Thus Dionysius glosseshis statement that God is the object of all cognition and of none by saying,“And there is, again, the most divine knowledge of God, that which isknown through unknowing, according to the union above intellect, whenthe intellect, standing apart from all beings, then sending away also itself, isunited to the rays beyond luminosity” (DN VII.3, 872AB). The “mystical”union with God in the “cessation of intellectual activities” is thus notopposed to the cognitive activity of knowing beings but is rather its goaland consummation.Like Plotinus, Dionysius describes this union as an “ecstasy” from boththe self and all things: “Leave behind sense-perceptions and intellectualactivities and all sensible and intelligible things and all non-beings andbeings, and be lifted up unknowingly toward the union, as far as possible, ofthat which is above all being and knowledge;26 for by the irresistible andabsolute ecstasy, purely, from yourself and all things, you will be led up to theray beyond being of the divine darkness, taking away all things and beingloosed from all things”27 (MT I.1, 997B–1000A). It is an “ek-stasis,” a stand-ing outside of oneself and all things, because, as the complete unification ofconsciousness, it is a passage beyond being as what is known and the self as"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"97THE CONTINUUM OF COGNITIONa knower. Therefore, immediately after distinguishing between the mind’spower of intellection and its transcendent union, Dionysius says, “Accordingto this [union], then, divine things are to be thought, not according to us,but our whole selves standing outside of our whole selves [ ̇louV ...auto∞V ̇lwn ...autÍn ÷xistam°nouV] and our whole [selves] becoming of God, forit is better to be of God and not of ourselves” (DN VII.1, 865D–868A).28The ecstasy in which we are “of God” rather than “of ourselves” is thecomplete unification of the self whereby we rise above being and knowledge.This ecstasy, as the completion of the cognitive ascent, is the properperfection of our nature as cognitive beings. Significantly, Dionysius speaksof ecstasy with regard to both love and knowledge. All beings are by loving,or reverting to, God, and this reversion, as a receptive self-abandonment, isan erotic ecstasy. But the mode of reversion proper to cognitive beings isknowledge. To be, for a cognitive thing, is to know, and since all knowledgeis knowledge of God, to be is to know God. Consequently, for us as rationalsouls capable of ascending to intellect and beyond, the cognitive ascent isour reversion, and the culmination of the ascent in the ecstatic union aboveintellect is the fulfilment of our nature. The mystical ecstasy, as the end ofcognition, is thus the mode of erotic, ontological ecstasy proper to and con-stitutive of rational beings.But according to the principles of hierarchy and analogy, just as knowl-edge is the mode of being proper to cognitive things, so the being of thingsat lower levels is their lesser mode of knowledge. The mere existence of astone, the life of a plant, and so on, is each thing’s analogous knowledge ofGod. For any being at all, therefore, to be is, analogously, to know God.This, again, is simply the converse of the understanding of being as theophany.If to produce is to reveal, then to be produced is to receive that revelation,i.e. to know. If being is the manifestation of God, then it is also the knowl-edge of God. Indeed, the very content of all things, as the manifestation ofGod in them, is therefore the awareness, the knowledge of God, in them.The whole of reality is God made manifest as the intelligible content of allthings, as what is given to cognition in all its analogous modes. The wholeof reality, therefore, is the knowledge of God, just as, in Plotinus, being athigher and lower levels is consciousness at higher and lower levels, and allconsciousness is the apprehension of the One in multiplicity.This is why Dionysius uses the image of illumination to refer indiffer-ently both to procession, God’s making things to be, and to revelation, hismaking himself known. The “rays” or “illuminations” shed analogously on allthings are rays at once of being and of knowledge, the manifestation of Godthat fills and constitutes all things (e.g. DN I.2, 588C–589D; IV.1, 693BC;IV.4, 697C). The “light” that beings, as mirrors, hierarchically transmit toone another, is the revelation, the knowledge of God which is all things inall things. Thus Dionysius says that the angels “are modeled on [God] as faras possible, and are boniform, and are communicative to those after them, as"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"98THEOPHANYthe divine ordinance directs, of the gifts that extend to them from the Good”(DN IV.1, 696A). These gifts, we know, include everything. In the CelestialHierarchy he indicates that the gifts which angels receive and transmit arethe knowledge of God, adding that by this ungrudging transmission “thedivine light extends analogously to all, by providence” and that through thehighest angels “the thearchic illumination is passed on to all, and to us” (CHXIII.3, 301C–304A). Indeed, to receive and transmit the knowledge of theunknowable God is what it is to be an angel: “The angel is an image [eÎkÔn]of God, a manifestation of the unmanifest light [fan°rwsiV to£ ™fano£Vfwt¬V], a pure mirror, most transparent, unblemished, undefiled, spotless,receiving whole, if it is right to say, the bloom of the good-stamped deiformity,and unmixedly shining back in itself, as far as it can, the goodness of thesilence in the sanctuary” (DN IV.22, 724B). The light which the angelsreflect is the theophany, the received knowledge of God which constitutesthem as intellects.But the intellectual nature of the angels is simply the highest, mostcomplete mode of being, enfolding in itself all lesser modes: the existence ofinanimate objects, the life of plants, the cognition of animals and humans.Hence not the angels alone but all beings are mirrors, in lesser, dimmer ways.What all beings reflect to one another are the gifts which they have re-ceived, and this is everything that they are. Hence the reflected light is theknowledge of God which comprises all things. Since all that is in all thingsis the manifestation of God in them, beings know God in and through eachother, and their revealing God to one another is their taking part in makingone another to be. The being of anything, therefore, consists at once in itsknowing God and in its making God known to others, in the manner properto it. The divine light which by means of hierarchy permeates the whole ofreality, is the knowledge of God which is the whole content of all things.Having discussed the modes of cognition found in beings, we mustfinally consider, with Dionysius, the cognition of God himself: “For how willhe think [no–sei] any of the intelligibles, since he does not have intellectualactivities, or how will he know sensible things, being fixed above all senseperception?” (DN VII.2, 868D). Dionysius replies that God knows all things,not by any mode of cognition correlated and directed to beings, but inknowing himself as their cause. “For the divine mind knows, not learningbeings from beings, but it pre-contains and pre-gathers the vision and knowl-edge [e≥dhsin ka¥ gnÍsin] and being of all things from itself and in itself,as cause, not applying itself to each individually [o¶ kat’ Îd√an ...kºstoiV÷pibºllwn], but in one encompassment of the cause knowing and compre-hending all things” (DN VII.2, 869AB). Dionysius then paraphrases Proclus’account of how the gods, or henads, know what is below themselves. “Thedivine Wisdom, then, by knowing itself knows all things: material thingsimmaterially and divisible things indivisibly and multiple things singly, bothknowing and producing all things by himself, the One” (DN VII.2, 869B).29"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"99THE CONTINUUM OF COGNITIONSince the effects are nothing but appearances of the cause and the causecontains the effects without distinction, God is the undifferentiated contain-ment of all things, and therefore in knowing himself knows all things atonce: “For if as one cause God imparts being to all beings, as that singlecause he will know all things, as being from him and pre-subsisting in him,and not from beings will he receive the knowledge of them . . . God, then,does not have a distinct knowledge of himself and another comprehendingall beings in common . . . By this, then, God knows beings, not by the knowl-edge of beings, but by that of himself” (DN VII.2, 869BC).This solution, however, raises the question of how God can even besaid to know himself, since knowledge is confined to beings in that it nec-essarily involves distinction and multiplicity. The only possible answer isthat God knows himself, not apart from all things—for apart from all thingsthere is neither being nor knowledge—but only as cause, which is to say asall things in all things. There is thus no distinction between God’s knowinghimself, his knowing all things, and his making all things to be. HenceDionysius repeatedly conjoins God’s knowing all things with his makingthem: “Thus the divine intellect encompasses all things by the transcendentknowledge of all things, pre-containing the knowledge of all things in him-self as the cause of all things, knowing and producing [eÎdÚV ka¥ parºgwn]angels before angels come to be, and within and from himself, so to speak,the source, knowing and bringing into being [eÎdÚV ka¥ eÎV o¶s√an Ògwn]all other things” (DN VII.2, 869A). God’s knowing all things in himself,then, is his producing all things. God “knows things into being,” making allthings in knowing them by knowing himself in them. And since it is as allthings in all things that God is their cause, God’s knowing himself is notonly the causing but the content of all reality, all things in all things. God’sknowing himself, and in himself all things, is the procession into all thingswhich is the making of all things and which is all things in all things.30 Asin Plotinus being and consciousness are identical as the manifestation andapprehension of the One, so in Dionysius all reality is the knowledge of God,in both the subjective and the objective sense of the genitive."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENSYMBOLISMDionysius consistently uses the term symbols (s§mbola) to refer to the sen-sible representations of God and of angels found in scripture and liturgy (e.g.DN I.4, 592B; IX.5, 913B; CH I.3, 121C–124A; II.5, 144CD; Ep. IX.1,1104B). Such symbols, he says, are necessary for human beings, who mustascend to intellect from sense perception, but not for angels, as pure intel-lects (CH I.3, 121C–124A). On this basis he distinguishes the content of theDivine Names from that of the lost or unwritten Symbolic Theology: the formerexpounds the intelligible “names” of God found in scripture, while the latterinterprets the sensible “symbols.”1 But just as sense and intellect are notopposed but in continuity, so the sensible symbols are continuous in kindwith the intelligible names, and the distinction between them is relativizedvis-à-vis God who infinitely transcends both. A philosophical examinationof Dionysius’ theory of symbols shows that being as such, not merely in itssensible aspect, is symbolic, and that there can be no non-symbolic knowl-edge of God. Therefore, as in the cognitive ascent from sense to intellect tomystical unknowing, to rise above symbols is not to discard them but toassume and penetrate into them. Dionysius’ doctrine of symbolism thus rep-resents the perfect unity of mystical unknowing and the cognitive apprehen-sion of reality.Since the symbols discussed by Dionysius, like the divine names, arethose found in the scriptures, an account of his theory of symbolism mightseem to belong to a study of his scriptural interpretation rather than to astudy of the specifically philosophical content of his thought. But in fact,since the expressions of God found in the scriptures expressly include allthings whatsoever, his exposition of both the intelligible names and thesensible symbols is not merely a matter of scriptural exegesis but a metaphysi-cal account of being as theophany and hence of all sensible things as symbolsof God.2 Thus in the Divine Names, with regard to the representation of Godas light, he quotes Romans 1:20, “ ‘The invisible things’ of God ‘from the101"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"102THEOPHANYcreation of the world are seen, understood by the things that are made, hiseternal power and divinity,’ ” and then adds, “But these things, in the Sym-bolic Theology” (DN IV.4–5, 700CD). Similarly in Epistle IX (which to somedegree serves as an epitome of the Symbolic Theology), after giving an exten-sive list of scriptural symbols and explaining their use, Dionysius refers to thesame scriptural text, saying, “And the world-ordering [kosmourg√a] itself ofall that appears presents the invisible things of God, as Paul and the trueword says” (Ep. IX.2, 1108B). Thus he explicitly grounds the scriptural useof sensible symbols in the metaphysics of being as theophany. This explainswhy, in describing the soul’s three modes of cognition, Dionysius describesthe outward, linear motion as an apprehension of “variegated and multipliedsymbols,” instead of referring directly to sense perception (DN IV.9, 705B).Because being is theophany, all sense perception is an apprehension of sym-bols of God.In view of this metaphysical basis for his theory of symbols, Dionysiuscannot and does not maintain the sharp distinction between intelligible “names”and sensible “symbols.” In Divine Names I.6, explaining how “the theologians[i.e. the scriptural writers] . . . hymn [God] both as nameless and from everyname,” he passes with complete continuity from the series of names that willbe discussed in the Divine Names, such as Being, Life, and Good, to a list ofsensible names: “sun, star, fire, water, wind, dew, cloud, rock itself and stone,all beings and none of beings” (DN I.6, 596C). The theoretical ground of thiscontinuity emerges explicitly in his account in the Celestial Hierarchy of “simi-lar” and “dissimilar” representations, whether of angels or of God. “The modeof sacred revelation is twofold: on the one hand as like, proceeding throughsimilar sacred-stamped images [ ̆erot§pwn eÎk¬nwn], but on the other throughdissimilar shape-makings, fashioned to what is altogether unlike and incongru-ous” (CH II.2–3, 140C). The “dissimilar” symbols are those that seem mani-festly inappropriate or even repugnant in connection with the angels or God,such as wild beasts and inanimate things, while the “similar” ones are thosethat seem noble or exalted and hence appropriate to what they represent. Thisdistinction thus to some degree parallels that between sensible and intelligiblerepresentations. But Dionysius goes on to explain that the seeming appropri-ateness of the “similar” symbols, including many of the intelligible names, isin fact a misleading appearance:Of course the mystical traditions of the revelatory oracles [i.e., thescriptures] at times hymn the blessedness of the thearchy beyondbeing as Word and Intellect and Being [l¬gon ka¥ no£n ka¥o¶s√a] . . . and they shape it as Light and call it Life, such sacredformations being more reverent and seeming somehow superior tothe shapings connected with matter [pros§lwn morfÔsewn], buteven so deficient in relation to the truth of the thearchic likeness.For it is above all being and life, no light characterizing it, every"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"103SYMBOLISMword and intellect [l¬gou ka¥ no£] incomparably [™sugkr√twV]falling short of its likeness. (CH II.3, 140CD)Since God is not any being or object of thought, it is as false, and false inthe same sense, to say that God is Word, Mind, or Being as to say that heis lion, stone, fire, or worm.3 All expressions of God, the exalted and intel-ligible no less than the lowly and sensible, are infinitely, and in that senseequally, inadequate, and hence all are “dissimilar.”For this reason Dionysius even says that the obviously “dissimilar”expressions are in fact more appropriate, as more clearly indicating the infiniteotherness of all things from God: “If, then, the negations are true of divinethings, but the affirmations are unsuitable to the hiddenness of ineffablethings, the revelation concerning invisible things through dissimilar forma-tions is rather more appropriate” (CH II.3, 141A). Even with regard to theangels, the seemingly “inappropriate” symbols are superior in that they areless likely to be taken literally as what the angels really are (CH II.3, 141AB).Having explained that all expressions are infinitely inadequate to God,Dionysius then remarks, “Further, it is necessary to understand this too, thatnot even one of beings is altogether deprived of participation in the Beau-tiful, since as the truth of the oracles [i.e. the scriptures] says, ‘all things arevery beautiful’ ” (CH II.3, 141C, citing Genesis 1:31 [LXX]). Since all thingsexist only by participating in Beauty, or God, and thus are manifestations ofGod, nothing is absolutely to be despised and nothing is absolutely inappro-priate or “dissimilar.” That would be the case only if God were not genuinelytranscendent but merely other, a different intelligible being set over againstthe rest of things. But since God is “all things in all things and nothing inany” (DN VII.3, 872A), it is as true, and true in the same sense, to say thathe is lion, stone, fire, and worm as to say that he is Word, Mind, and Being.All expressions of God, the lowly and sensible no less than the exalted andintelligible, participate in him and are thus “similar.”Here, then, Dionysius explicitly overcomes any fundamental distinc-tion between intelligible names and sensible symbols. All things, whetherintelligible or sensible, are both “similar” and “dissimilar,” and this is whatit means to be a symbol. As beings, as finite, all things absolutely are notGod himself, and thus are infinitely “dissimilar” or inappropriate; and asbeings, as finite, all things are presentations of God and in this sense “simi-lar” or appropriate. All the ways in which God is represented thus have thesame ontological status. Although the word s§mbolon is confined to sensiblerepresentations, these are not fundamentally different in kind from the intel-ligible ones.4 To insist on such a difference would be, once again, to regardGod not as beyond being but as intelligible, as finite, as the proper object ofsome exalted mode of cognition. All things, then, are in effect symbols of Godand are so used in the scriptures, and this is simply a restatement of thedoctrine that being is theophany."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"104THEOPHANYAll symbols, in that they are both similar and dissimilar, at once revealand conceal that which they symbolize, and this is the very nature of asymbol and hence of being as symbol. Not only does a symbol both revealand conceal, but it does both in one: it conceals precisely in and as revealing,and reveals precisely in and as concealing. Every being, or symbol, is adifferentiated expression, a presentation, a coming forth of God into open-ness, manifestness, availability. As such it reveals God, making him know-able in and as the content of that being. To know anything is to know Godas manifest in that thing. The Platonic doctrine of participation, whichDionysius invokes in justifying the suitability of all things as symbols of God,makes it clear that the symbolized is not extrinsic to but present in thesymbol,5 that the symbol is a genuine presentation of the symbolized. But toreveal God in this way is to conceal him. For precisely as differentiated, asfinite, and hence as available, as a presentation, every being, or symbol, isnot God himself and thus conceals him, leaving him behind, inaccessible, inthe dark. As Dionysius says, “Darkness becomes invisible by light, and moreby much light; knowings [a ̆ gnÔseiV] make unknowing invisible, and manyknowings more” (Ep. I, 1065A). Light, the content of all vision, by itspresence conceals darkness, making it invisible. To apprehend a symbol, amanifestation, is to apprehend some being, and hence not God himself. Thesymbol or being, by providing content for thought, hides God from us. Toknow any thing is, ipso facto, not to know God. To engage in cognition atall is not to unknow, and the more multiple the cognition, as at the level ofsense where we apprehend sensible symbols, the further removed it is frommystical union. Thus the revealing is the concealing.But conversely, to conceal God in this way is to reveal him. Lightmakes darkness invisible; but then, the proper way, the only way to seedarkness, is not to see. “We pray to come to [gen°sqai]6 the darkness abovelight and through ungazing and unknowing to see and know the aboveseeing and knowing by not seeing and not knowing itself ” (MT II, 1025A).Not to see is to see darkness. To leave darkness invisible, to conceal it, isthus to reveal it as darkness, and only so can it be revealed. A symbol, then,in being finite, available, in not being God and thus in leaving him behind,in concealing him, reveals him as beyond being and thought.7 “For it is notpossible that the thearchic ray illumine us otherwise than as anagogicallycloaked in the variety of the sacred veils [Ka¥ gΩr oud‰ dunat¿n ...t°rwV≠mƒn ÷pilºmyai t‹n qearcik‹n ™ktƒna m‹ tŒ poikil√a ̨ tÍn ̆erÍnparapetasmºtwn ™nagwgikÍV perikekalumm°nhn]” (CH I.2, 121B). Itwould be easy to overlook the paradox of this statement, taking it to meanmerely that God is presented to us by means of symbols. What Dionysiusactually says here, however, is that God cannot “illumine” us, i.e. be revealed,be known to us, except by being symbolically “veiled,” i.e. hidden from us.Only by being concealed in symbols can God be revealed. For if he were notconcealed, then what is revealed would be not God but some being, some-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"105SYMBOLISMthing which is and can be known. If we are truly to know God, if what isrevealed is to be God himself, then what we know must be the unknowable,what is revealed must be concealed, for otherwise it would not be God thatis known and revealed. Only by symbols is this possible. Hence, as Dionysiushere indicates, there can be no non-symbolic knowledge of God, no knowl-edge of God without the concealment of symbolism. Only a symbol, in thatqua symbol it conceals what it reveals, can make God known without objec-tifying him as a being, enabling us to know God without violating hisunknowability, and thus truly to know God. The concealing is the revealing.Dionysius’ doctrine of symbols is thus another expression of the principlethat God is given to every mode of cognition, including sense perception,and is inaccessible to all cognition whatsoever.There is no question, then, of stripping away all symbols so as to arriveat a direct, non-symbolic knowledge of God unveiled. Whatever is unveiled isnot God. All knowledge involves symbols, having as its content being, notGod. To transcend symbolism altogether, to remove all the veils, the beings,whereby God is revealed, would not be to know God directly, but to unknow,for apart from beings, or symbols, there is no content for knowledge. “We takeaway all things [tΩ pºnta ™fairo£men], so that we may unhiddenly[™perikal§ptwV] know that unknowing which is hidden [perikekalumm°nhn]by all that is known in all beings, and may see the darkness beyond beingwhich is concealed by all light in beings” (MT II, 1025B).8 We might comparethis “taking away all things” so as to “see” the divine darkness to unwrappingthe Invisible Man of science fiction, who is rendered visible only by the cov-erings that give him determinate shape. When all the coverings have beenremoved and the man himself is laid bare, there is nothing left to see. Theremoval of all symbols is not a knowledge of God unveiled, as if God could bean object of knowledge, but the cessation of intellectual activities, the unionabove intellect, the darkness of unknowing.The identity of concealing and revealing which is the essence ofsymbolism is captured in Dionysius’ use of the word probºllein.9 Etymo-logically, this means “to throw forth,” and so comes to means both “present,put forward, expose” and also “shield, screen, set up a defense.”10 The wordthus carries two opposite meanings in one. Plotinus seems to use it in thisway at least once, when he identifies the forms as the beautiful and thensays, “That which is beyond this we call the nature of the Good, havingthe beautiful held as a screen [probeblhm°non] before it” (I.6.9.37–39). Itis not entirely clear that Plotinus intends the double meaning, for he maysimply mean that the beautiful is “presented” or “projected” from the Good;but such a reading would accord with his doctrine that the forms, or thebeautiful, at once manifest the Good and, since they are not the Gooditself, conceal it.11Dionysius repeatedly uses this word to express the two-in-one functionof creatures as symbols, at once revealing and concealing God. In Epistle IX,"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"106THEOPHANYafter listing the many symbols of God found in scripture—which, let usremember, ultimately include all things—he says that these aresacred compositions of daring God-formation, manifest presenta-tions [fain¬mena...probeblhm°na] of hidden things, and multi-plications and divisions of single and indivisible things, and multiformshapings of formless and shapeless things; if anyone is able to see theirhidden inner comeliness, he will find them all mystical and deiformand filled with much theological light. For let us not think that theappearances of the compositions [sunqhmºtwn12] are formulated fortheir own sakes, but that they screen [probebl›sqai] the knowledgeof the unspoken and invisible to the many, lest the all-sacred thingsbe accessible to the profane; but they are unhidden to only the genu-ine lovers of divinity, who do away with all childish imaginationabout the sacred symbols and are able to cross over, by simplicity ofintellect and fittingness of contempative power, to the simple andsupernatural and exalted truth of the symbols. (Ep. IX.1, 1105BC)A common reading of this passage takes it to mean, as on the surface itsuggests, that the symbols present the knowledge of God to an intellectualelite (“the genuine lovers of divinity”) and screen it from the many (“theprofane”).13 This reading, however, does not do justice to Dionysius’ use ofthe same word, within the space of six lines, to mean both “present” and“screen”: we could as well say that the symbols are “manifest screens ofhidden things,” screening the hidden and simple precisely by being manifestand multiple, and that they “present the knowledge of the unspoken” to themany, keeping it from being profaned in that by presenting, they hide it. Itis intrinsic to symbols to reveal and conceal in one; they do not simply revealto some and simply conceal from others. All are called to “cross over” to the“truth” of the symbols, to ascend toward unknowing in receiving all thingsas symbols, and the distinction between “genuine lovers of divinity” and “theprofane” simply recognizes different degrees in this ascent.14 Shortly after-wards Dionysius uses ‘probºllw’ again to say that “the world-ordering itselfof all that appears presents [prob°blhtai] the invisible things of God (Ep.IX.2, 1108B).” The reference to Romans 1:20 may incline us to say “pre-sents” rather than “screens,” but, in view of the already established identityof revealing and concealing, and the use of the word just above to indicatehiding as well as presenting, both meanings are present here: the things thatappear at once present and screen the invisible things of God.15The twofold meaning of ‘probºllein’ is even more prominent in theDivine Names. Here Dionysius, explaining like Proclus that whatever pos-sesses a more specific perfection must first possess being, says that “before allthe other participations of [God] being [t¿ eΔnai] is presented [prob°blhtai]”(DN V.5, 820A). Therefore, “the beyond-goodness-itself is hymned . . . as"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"107SYMBOLISMpresenting [proballom°nh] the first gift of being itself ” (DN V.6, 820C).The very being of all things, then, and hence all their intelligible content,is a presentation which screens and a screen which presents God. In address-ing the question of how we know God, therefore, Dionysius says thatit is never true to say, then, that we know God; not from his nature,for this is unknowable and surpasses all reason and intellect; but fromthe order of all beings, as presented-as-a-screen [probeblhm°nhV]from him, and having certain images and likenesses of his divineparadigms, we go up, by way and order according to our power, to thebeyond all things, in the taking away and transcendence of all things16and in the cause of all things. Wherefore both in all things God isknown and apart from all things. (DN VII.3, 869C–872A)Here again, the order of all things is a presentation which screens God fromus. It is immediately after this that Dionysius says that God is known byevery mode of cognition and by none, that he is “known to all from all andto none from any.” All beings, then, are probeblhm°na, at once presenta-tions and screens of God, and thus are symbols, revealing and concealing inone. Since “the being of all things is the divinity beyond being,”17 everybeing is at once a presentation and a concealment of God.The symbolic nature of being is most fully realized in the angels, be-cause, as we have seen, they are beings in the fullest sense. From the Good,Dionysius says, it is given to them “to reveal in themselves the hiddenGoodness, and to be angels as annunciative of the divine silence, and aspresenting clear lights interpretive of that which is in the sanctuaries [t¿÷kfa√nein ÷n ...autaƒV t‹n kruf√an ™gaq¬thta ka¥ eΔnai ™gg°louV Ïsper÷xaggeltikΩV t›V qe√aV sig›V ka¥ o«on fÍta fanΩ to£ ÷n ™d§toiV ∫ntoV...rmeneutikΩ probeblhm°naV]” (DN IV.2, 696BC). Translation cannot fullycapture the series of paradoxes contained in this sentence. The angels revealwhat is hidden; they announce18 the divine silence; they present-as-screens lightswhich interpret what is inaccessible. These paradoxes capture the very essenceof symbolism: to hide what it reveals by revealing it and to reveal what ithides by hiding it. Any interpretation, in that it is not the meaning itself butan interpretation of it, leaves behind, renders inaccessible, the meaning whichit presents. But in view of Dionysius’ understanding of all being as theophany,and the doctrine that the angels possess in an eminent way all the perfec-tions of lesser beings, this is true not only of the angels but, analogously, ofall things. To be a being is to be a symbol, to interpret the inaccessible, toannounce the divine silence.Because of the identity between revealing and concealing in symbol-ism, there is no opposition between the symbolic knowledge of God in andfrom beings and the union with God in unknowing by the taking away of allbeings. The ascent from sense to intellect to the union above intellect, in"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"108THEOPHANYwhich unknowing is the culmination and enfolding of all knowledge, is alsothe ascent from sensible symbols to intellectual contemplation to unknow-ing: “Now [i.e. in the present age as distinct from the eschaton],19 as far asis possible for us, we use proper symbols for divine things, and from theseagain we are drawn up analogously to the simple and unified truth of theintellectual visions, and, after every intellection of deiform things in us,ceasing our intellectual activities, we apply ourselves, so far as is right, to theray beyond being” (DN I.4, 592CD). In this ascent, the sensible symbols arenot merely left behind. For the very nature of a symbol is such that to knowit is to unknow it. To understand a symbol as a symbol is to ignore it, toattend not to the symbol as an object in itself but rather to the meaning itconcealingly reveals. Conversely, to attend to a symbol as an object in itsown right is to fail to know it as a symbol. To a person who cannot read, forexample, a written word is an object consisting of ink on paper. But a reader,in the very act of perceiving the word, is oblivious to the word as such andattentive only to its meaning. The more he ignores the word as an object,the more deeply immersed he is in the meaning, the more perfectly he isreading and the better he is knowing the word as what it really is, as asymbol. The non-reader might argue that the reader is simply disregardingthe word in favor of something else; this is precisely the attitude of thosewho see in the Dionysian ascent from sensible symbols to intellectual con-templation to mystical unknowing a rejection or abandonment of sense andsymbol. But in fact, of course, it is the reader, who in perceiving the wordunknows it in itself, who truly knows and appreciates the word as word.Therefore, as Dionysius says, “It is necessary, then, for us, contrary tothe popular assumption about them, to cross over into [e≥sw...diaba√nein]the sacred symbols in a way befitting the sacred, and not despise them,because they are the offspring and impressions of the divine characters, andmanifest images of the unspoken and supernatural visions” (Ep. IX.2, 1108C).20The ascent from symbols is the penetration into them. To rise to unknowing,to remove all the veils, to take away all things, is most fully to enter into thesymbols, or beings. At the peak, therefore, we find the perfect union ofknowing and unknowing, in which all beings are most perfectly known inbeing wholly unknown just as a word is most perfectly known in beingignored, because all beings are nothing but symbols of God.21 The mysticalunion is not a non-symbolic encounter with God as an object other than allthings. It is rather a penetration into all things to God who, as “all thingsin all things and nothing in any,” is at once revealed and concealed by allthings. To ascend to unknowing is to see the darkness hidden and revealedby all light, to hear all things “announce the divine silence.”Although we have for the most part left aside the specifically Christianaspects of Dionysius’ thought in order to highlight its philosophical dimen-sion, we may note in conclusion that Dionysius recapitulates his understand-ing of being as theophanic symbol in his account of the incarnation:"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"109SYMBOLISMConcerning the love for man in Christ, even this, I think, thetheology suggests: that out of the hidden the beyond-being has comeforth into manifestation according to us [÷k to£ kruf√ou t¿n•pero§sion eÎV t‹n kaq’ ≠møV ÷mfºneian], becoming a being[o¶siwq°nta] in a human way. But he is hidden even after themanifestation, or, that I may speak more divinely, even in themanifestation. For even this of Jesus is hidden, and the mystery inhim is brought forth to no reason or intellect, but what is saidremains ineffable and what is thought, unknowable. (Ep. III, 1069B)The incarnation, then, is the coming forth of God into manifestness. Butthis, as we have seen, is what all reality is. So also, by saying that God is“hidden . . . in the manifestation,” Dionysius restates his doctrine of being assymbol, at once revealing and concealing God. Here as elsewhere Dionysiusexpresses the incarnation with the formula “the beyond-being becomes abeing.” “From the substance of men the beyond-being is made a being[ ̨ •pero§sioV o¶siwm°noV] . . . Truly coming into being in a manner abovebeing he is made a being [eÎV o¶s√an ™lhqÍV ÷lqÚn •p‰r o¶s√ano¶siÔqh]” (Ep. IV, 1072B; see also DN II.9, 648A). This formula assimi-lates the incarnation to Dionysius’ Neoplatonic metaphysics, in which Godis manifest in and as each and every being, “all things in all things,” and thuscould be said to be made a being in them.22The incarnation is thus seen to be fully consonant with, and indeedthe fullest expression of, the Neoplatonic philosophical conception of Godas not any being but the power of all things, as pure Giving, as Overflow, or,in Dionysius’ terms, as Love.23 In this sense it is true, as has often beenremarked, that Dionysius understands the incarnation in terms of theNeoplatonic metaphysics of procession and reversion.24 But this need notmean that the incarnation is merely another procession, additional to andparallel with the universal, creative procession of God to all things and allthings from God. Rather, Dionysius’ discussions of the incarnation suggestthat the whole of being, as theophany, is to be understood in incarnationalterms, and that God incarnate, as the “principle and perfection of all hier-archies” (EH I.2, 373B),25 is the fullness of reality itself. Being as symbol, astheophany, and hence as being, is perfectly realized in Christ, in God incar-nate, the finite being which is God-made-manifest."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONThe entire vision of reality articulated in this study arises from the singlefundamental principle that may be called Parmenides’ Law: t¿ gΩr a¶t¿noeƒn ⁄stin te ka¥ eΔnai: to be is to be intelligible.

AsE. R. Dodds says of Proclus’ system,[I]ts fundamental weakness seems to me to lie in the assumptionthat the structure of the cosmos exactly reproduces the structure ofGreek logic. All rationalist systems are to some extent exposed tocriticism on these lines; but in Proclus ontology becomes so mani-festly the projected shadow of logic as to present what is almost areductio ad absurdum of rationalism . . .

But what he fails to realize is that the structureof reality as understood by Neoplatonism matches not merely a culturallyand historically specific phenomenon called “Greek logic,” but the universalnature of thought as such, which necessarily apprehends its objects as beings,characterized and constituted by certain determinations in virtue of whichthey are what they are and so are beings at all. Dodds’ argument is parallel toNietzsche’s remark that “we are not getting rid of God because we still believein grammar”:2 the Neoplatonic ascent to the One as the transcendent groundof which reality is the manifestation, is a working out of the intelligibility ofbeing, its conformity to the structure of thought (“grammar”).The alternative to the principle that to be is to be intelligible, there-fore, is the nihilism which afflicts so much of contemporary thought andculture.

Nihil-ism may indeed be said to consist most fundamentally in the denial of theintelligibility of being.3 This is precisely the condition of much contemporaryreflection, to the extent that it consists in the claim that we can never“break out” of our own language and thought to get at reality. As Plotinussaw, only if being is always already given in thought can we avoid thenihilistic conclusion that “there is no truth.”4 The Neoplatonic vision takesas its starting point the intelligibility, which is to say the reality, of being.From the intelligibility of being follows its necessary multiplicity anddeterminateness, and consequently its status as dependent or derivative, asdifferentiated presentation, as manifestation. Hence Neoplatonism arrives ata God who is “beyond being” in a stricter, stronger, more absolute sense thanis often recognized. This philosophy thus surpasses any “onto-theology,”whether a crude form which conceptualizes God as the “first and highestbeing,” or a more sophisticated and supposedly apophatic form which self-contradictorily identifies God as “a being beyond being,” something which isalbeit in a superior “way.” In Neoplatonism, in Plotinus, Proclus, andDionysius, divine transcendence is conceived so radically that it coincideswith divine immanence. Transcendence and immanence are not opposed toeach other, nor do they merely mitigate or even complement each other;5they are, rather, strictly identical.6 Conceived Neoplatonically, transcen-dence in no way implies separation or duality between God and the world,which would leave the world itself godless and hence unworlded and thuslead to nihilism. Rather, the transcendent is precisely that which is giventhrough, in, and as the world. The more transcendent God is, the more—not the less!—intimately present he is to the world; the absolutely transcen-dent God of Neoplatonism is therefore nothing but what is manifest in andas all things, “all things in all things and nothing in any” (DN VII.3, 872A).Thinking, therefore, must always look “beyond” the being which it appre-hends to that which is never merely “present” either as a member of theworld or as something separate from the world, but is always presented andso always equally and infinitely “absent.”As such formulations suggest, Dionysius’ thought is worth examiningnot only for its intrinsic value and historical significance, but also for thecontributions it can make to contemporary discourse. In the “postmodern”era, characterized by a salutary critique and even repudiation of the “moder-nity” that dominated Western culture from the later Middle Ages to thetwentieth century and is still largely with us, Dionysius offers, from withinthe Western tradition itself, an alternative which is not proto-modern butrather radically pre-modern and un-modern. The togetherness of being andthinking and the interpretation of being as appearance, which is so centralto Neoplatonism, including Dionysius, opens a major area of dialogue be-"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"113CONCLUSIONtween Dionysius and recent phenomenological thought, overcoming thecharacteristically modern duality between subject and object. More specifically,Dionysius’ philosophy can converse fruitfully with such Heideggerian themesas the critique of “onto-theology” and of “metaphysics of presence” and thedialectic of revealing and concealing. Heidegger shows how “metaphysics ofpresence,” which on his view dominates the whole of Western thought, leadsto a technological comportment toward being in which being is revealedonly as Bestand, resources or stockpile, and how this technologicalinstrumentalization of being makes possible modern science and leads inevi-tably to nihilism. As the alternative to this ultimately nihilistic, scientific-technological stance toward being, Dionysius offers a contemplative-liturgicalstance in which being is not an object for mastery and exploitation but a giftwhich is received only in being given and a symbol which is known only inbeing unknown. His thought can thus also contribute to contemporaryreflection on technology and the related area of “environmental philosophy.”The Dionysian, Neoplatonic understanding of all things, including animals,plants, and minerals, as theophanies which analogously think, live, and love,may be set against the objectifying and reductionist view of nature which hasled to its exploitation and destruction, and which is largely the result of avery different religious philosophy that opposes the natural both to the humanand to the divine. In opposition to such a view, Dionysius and his Neoplatonicpredecessors offer a compelling and philosophically grounded vision of allreality as the presence and manifestation of transcendent divinity."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"NOTESNOTE ON TRANSLATIONS1.The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr.

For Proclus’ thought I have relied chiefly on the Elements of Theologybecause this work most clearly and systematically presents the fundamental structuralprinciples of his metaphysics, and it is precisely these principles, rather than thedetailed elaboration of his philosophy in the Platonic Theology and the commentaries,that contribute most to a philosophical understanding of Dionysius.4. For the continuing life of this condemnation, see the survey of the litera-ture on Dionysius in Golitzin, Et Introibo, 22–42.5. A rare exception is Werner Beierwaltes, Platonismus im Christentum (Frank-furt am Main: Klostermann, 2001), 84, who expressly concludes “Dionysius: Christianussimulque vere Platonicus.” Nonetheless, even Beierwaltes says this only after arguingfor a significant difference between Dionysius and his Neoplatonic predecessors.

Golitzin, Et Introibo, 395, recognizes the difficulty here: “That element ofthe Dionysian synthesis which has been most to the fore in the scholarship of thepast century is the matter of the CD’s relationship to Neoplatonism. Here we con-front a shibboleth that has long troubled the investigation of Christian thought fromits beginnings down to the Middle Ages: that is, the assumption that the Platonictradition and Christianity are mutually exclusive.” He goes on to deny this assump-tion. Nonetheless, in reclaiming Dionysius as genuinely Christian, Golitzin still findsit necessary to argue that his thought is significantly different from Neoplatonism.9.

This is due in large part to the Heideggerian critique of “onto-theology”and “metaphysics of presence,” and the related deconstructionist assault on“logocentrism,” as well as to a more generalized postmodern dissatisfaction with positive,closed “systems” in theology or philosophy and distrust of language and thought.

Wherefore beingis the proper object of intellect.” Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica Ia, 5, 2, resp.5. Plato’s point is exceptionally well expressed by J. N. Findlay, “Towards aNeo-Neo-Platonism,” in Ascent to the Absolute (London: Allen and Unwin, 1970),252: “[W]hile we may be inclined to look in the direction of particular embodimentfor a paradigm of what is, we soon find that we cannot successfully pin down suchparticularity in its purity, or identify it in varying contexts and occasions. All that issubstantial, invariant in it is a pattern, a character, a set of suches which we hail andname on every occasion of their appearance. This character or pattern is all that wecan grasp and handle in thought on many occasions, and introduce to and considerwith others: the existence of an individual seems to be no more than the fact thatcertain identifiable, recognizable universals are instantiated and reinstantiated.”6. Plato makes much the same point again at Timaeus 46e3–7.7. The “forms of evils” that Plato often mentions, e.g. the unjust, the ugly,etc., can best be understood as included in their good opposites as possible modes ofdeviation from them. “It is necessary that the same person [who knows what is best]also know what is worse” (Phaedo 97d4). For this interpretation of the forms of evils,see J. N. Findlay, Plato: The Written and Unwritten Doctrines (London: Routledge andKegan Paul, 1974), 43, 139, 375.8.T¿ »n here means not “that which is” but “beingness,” the status orcondition of being a being, just as, for example, t¿ kal¬n can mean either “thatwhich is beautiful” or “beauty.” For another instance of this alteration in Plato’susage of t¿ »n, see Sophist 250b7 et seq. and the remark on this passage by F. M.Cornford, Plato’s Theory of Knowledge (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1935),250–51.9. The term means primarily “age” but comes to connote “dignity” or “rank.”English “seniority” thus corresponds closely in meaning.10. According to Aristotle and other ancient reports, Plato identified the Goodwith the One, and this identification is strongly suggested in the Republic. See Findlay,Plato, 184–85, and Giovanni Reale, Toward a New Interpretation of Plato, tr. John R.Catan and Richard Davies (Washington: Catholic University of America Press, 1997),204–09.11. The relation between Plato’s No£V or Demiurge and the forms is highlycontroversial. The current consensus, on the whole, is that they are separate; but seeEric D. Perl, “The Demiurge and the Forms: A Return to the Ancient Reading ofPlato’s Timaeus,” Ancient Philosophy 18 (1998): 81–92. See also A. Diès, Autour dePlaton, 2nd ed.

Plotinus here speaks of the One constituting being as the definer of the“indefinite dyad”; but as he explains in II.4.5, this indefinite dyad or “intelligiblematter” is nothing but the forms themselves, or being, considered qua receptive ofdetermination from the One.13. Cf. V.5.4.13–14: the One is “measure and not measured,” i.e. providesdetermination to all things but itself has none.14. Textually speaking, Plotinus’ radically negative doctrine of the One isdrawn to a considerable extent from the first hypothesis of Plato’s Parmenides, as hasbeen recognized ever since the seminal article by E. R. Dodds, “The Parmenides ofPlato and the Origin of the Neoplatonic ‘One,’ ” Classical Quarterly 22 (1928): 129–43. Philosophically speaking, however, Plotinus’ doctrine is, as represented here,based on the argument that being qua intelligible is necessarily finite and hencederivative.15. John Rist, Plotinus: The Road to Reality (Cambridge: Cambridge UniversityPress, 1967), 24–37. Cf. Lloyd Gerson, Plotinus (London and New York: Routledge,1994), 26: “[T]hat the One is beyond essence does not mean that it is beyondexistence or being altogether. Suggestions to the contrary are just misunderstandingsof Plotinus’ so-called ‘negative theology.’ What Plotinus rejects in reference to theOne is language that implies limitedness or complexity.” But Plotinus’ point is thatexistence or being necessarily implies both limitedness and complexity; and this isnot simply a restriction on his use of the term ‘being,’ but a philosophical conse-quence of the identity of being and intelligibility.16. Cf. A. H. Armstrong, “Negative Theology, Myth, and Incarnation,” inNeoplatonism and Christian Thought, ed. Dominic O’Meara (Albany: State Universityof New York Press, 1982), 217: “It seems that the traditional terms ‘beyond being,’‘nonbeing,’ or ‘nothing’ applied to God are most significant when used in their properHellenic context in which being is closely correlated with intelligibility: real beingis intelligible being. They mean, then, that God is not a somebody or something whocan be discursively defined or discerned with intuitive precision. It is not that hisintelligibility transcends our limited and fallen human intelligences, but that he hasno intelligible content.” For comparably radical (although not identical) readings ofPlotinus’ “negative theology” (or “negative henology,” if “theology” is assumed toposit God as in any sense a supreme being), see Reiner Schürmann, “L’hénologiecomme dépassement de la métaphysique,” Etudes philosophiques 37 (1982): 331–50;Jean-Marc Narbonne, “Heidegger et le néoplatonisme,” Quaestio 1 (2001): 55–82;and idem, Hénologie, ontologie, et Ereignis (Plotin—Proclus—Heidegger) (Paris: Les BellesLettres, 2001).17. See V.3.16.15–16: “There must therefore be a concentration into One,really outside all multiplicity and any simplicity whatsoever [ªpl¬thtoV≠stinoso£n].” Contrast Gerson, Plotinus, 16, and Rist, Plotinus, 25: “Why doesPlotinus generally call it ‘the One’? Surely because it is exactly what it is, an entirelyindivisible unity.”18. Vladimir Lossky, The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church (Crestwood,NY: St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press, 1976), 31, attempting to contrast the One ofPlotinus with the God of Dionysius, fails to note this: “In his refusal to attribute toGod the properties which make up the matter of affirmative theology, Dionysius isaiming expressly at the neo-platonist definitions: ‘He is neither One, nor Unity.’ ” Infact, in negating the name ‘One’ Dionysius is simply following the precepts of Plotinus."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"119NOTES TO CHAPTER ONE19. This is not to say that Plotinus’ mysticism is in the least anti-intellectual.As we shall see in chapter 6, for both Plotinus and Dionysius the soul’s meta-noeticunion with the One is not a rejection or abandonment of intellection, but its properculmination.20. Dionysius’ doctrine is, of course, drawn more immediately from Proclus and,in the case of his extreme negative formulations, from Damascius, than from Plotinus(although there is no doubt that he was directly familiar with the Enneads). For theinfluence of Damascius on Dionysius, see Salvatore Lilla, “Pseudo-Denys l’Aréopagite,Porphyre et Damascius,” in Denys l’Aréopagite et sa posterité en Orient et en Occident, ed.Ysabel de Andia (Paris: Institut d’Etudes Augustiennes, 1977), 117–52. Here, however,we may pass directly from Plotinus to Dionysius because, while Dionysius’ formulationsmay be drawn more from Proclus and Damascius than from Plotinus, the philosophicalargumentation by which these doctrines are reached is already fully present in Plotinus.The examination of Damascius as a textual source for Dionysius would thus contributelittle to a philosophical understanding of his position.21. Contrast e.g. Paul Rorem, Pseudo-Dionysius: A Commentary on the Textsand an Introduction to Their Influence (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press,1993), 213: “Negation is a human concept, and thus cannot capture an infinite andtranscendent God. . . Negation is negated and the human mind, befuddled, falls si-lent” (my italics). But in fact, for Dionysius as for Plotinus, human concepts andminds are unable to capture God, not because they are human, but because they areconcepts and minds. Cf. n. 16 in this chapter.22. See Derrida, “La différance,” 31: “Negative theology [is] always concernedwith disengaging...a superessentiality beyond the finite categories of essence andexistence, that is of presence, and eager always to remember that if the predicate isrefused to God, this is to recognize for him a superior, inconceivable, ineffable modeof being.” This is simply an (all too common) misinterpretation of negative theology;see above, 11–12, and 118. If to be is to be intelligible, then an “inconceivable,ineffable mode of being” is a contradiction in terms. Cf. Derrida, “How to AvoidSpeaking,” 7–8: negative theology “seems to reserve beyond all positive predication,beyond all negation, even beyond being, some hyperessentiality—a being beyondbeing.” This, again, is not true for the negative theology of Plotinus or of Dionysius.23. Fran O’Rourke, Pseudo-Dionysius and the Metaphysics of Aquinas (Leiden:Brill, 1992), 203, sees this as a weakness in Dionysius and the whole Greek tradition:“For Dionysius, being has of necessity the status of a creature. . . That is to say,Dionysius did not have a fully developed appreciation of the absolute and transcen-dental nature of Being. Greek philosophy as a whole had not yet discovered thetranscendent or universal and analogical value of Being, i.e. that as a concept unre-stricted in itself, ‘being’ adequately expresses the reality both of creatures and of Godwhile yet allowing their radical distinction. It failed, therefore, to harmonise faith-fully within a unified order both the finite and infinite character of reality.” But theGreek position is no mere inadequacy, but a strict consequence of the principle thatto be is to be intelligible and hence finite. To embrace God and creation, the infiniteand the finite, “within a unified order” is to render the infinite finite and violatedivine transcendence. The very expression “the reality both of creatures and of God”is inadmissible, for it treats God as one member of a larger totality and subordinatesGod to a term more universal than himself, viz. “reality.” This is precisely whyPlotinus and Dionysius refuse to predicate “reality” or “being” of the One, or God."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"24. Plotinus himself uses such a formula at V.3.14.7, but this must be qualifiedin light of his more careful statements that even negations must be negated so thatwe transcend thought altogether.25. For this reason, nothing (i.e. no being) can be ineffable. Cf. Carl R.Kordig, “The Mathematics of Mysticism: Plotinus and Proclus,” in The Structure ofBeing, ed. R. Baine Harris (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1982), 116–17: “Proclus and Plotinus claim that no descriptive predicate whatsoever applies tothe One. . . Now let us introduce a new term ‘Proclusian’ in the following way: forany x, x is Proclusian if and only if x is such that no descriptive predicate applies toit . . . The One of Plotinus and Proclus is such that no descriptive predicate appliesto it; therefore. . . the One is Proclusian. But since ‘Proclusian’ itself is a descriptivepredicate, it also follows that the One is not Proclusian. But strictly speaking this isa contradiction, which is absurd. Proclus’—and Plotinus’—claim that no descriptivepredicate whatsoever applies to the One leads to contradiction and must therefore beabandoned.” This argument is flawed because the One is not “any x.” Kordig fails tohear the silence in all that Proclus and Plotinus say about the One, including theclaim that no descriptive predicate applies to it. He continues, “Proclus ends hisCommentary [on Plato’s Parmenides] with two sentences that succinctly express theprincipal theme and outlook of the Neoplatonic tradition: ‘For by means of a nega-tion Parmenides has removed all negations. With silence he concludes the contem-plation of the One.’ Now a silence justified by irrational means (i.e. by untenableclaims and bad arguments) is not really justified. It is an irrational silence.” TheNeoplatonic silence, however, is not irrational, but is justified by Kordig’s own argu-ment. Precisely because nothing can truly be described as ineffable, the only recourseis silence.26. For a comparable reading of Dionysius, see John Jones, “The OntologicalDifference for St. Thomas and Pseudo-Dionysius,” Dionysius 4 (1980): 119–32, andidem, “A Non-Entitative Understanding of Be-ing and Unity: Heidegger andNeoplatonism,” Dionysius 6 (1982): 94–110.27.

Carlson (NewYork: Fordham University Press, 2001), 152: “If one means by Aitia, when applied toGod, the modern ‘cause of self and the world,’ then one most certainly falls backamong the idols of the divine. But the cause intervenes here in order to mark pre-cisely the reverse: namely, that we have no naming suitable to God, not even innegation.”2. Cf. Plotinus, V.1.7.24–27, quoted above, 20: “Being. . . must be fixed bylimit and stability; and stability in the intelligible world is limitation and shape, andit is by these that it receives existence” (my italics).3. This phrase, although not the interpretation of Plotinus which I use it toexpress, is borrowed from Michael Wagner, “Vertical Causation in Plotinus,” in TheStructure of Being, ed. R.

The “receptacle” of the Timaeus is not another component of sensiblethings, but merely the “place” or “space” in which forms appear. Plato expresslyidentifies bodies, or sensible things, not as composites of form-appearances and thereceptacle, but as nothing but likenesses or appearances of the forms. See Timaeus50b6–c5, 52c2–4.7. See R. Patterson, Image and Reality in Plato’s Metaphysics (Indianapolis:Hackett, 1985), 3–4, 20–22.8. Cf. John N. Deck, Nature, Contemplation, and the One (Burdett, NY: Larson,1991), 124–25.9. The image of being as “under pressure” suggests the One making being byproviding “shape” or determination.10. Dodds, Elements of Theology, 252, remarks that this doctrine “is accommo-dated to the more rigid theory of ‘unparticipated’ and ‘participated’ Forms (prop.23)”; but this seems arbitrary. We could as well, or better, say that the “rigid” distinc-tion between participated and unparticipated terms is “accommodated” to the simul-taneity of transcendence and immanence.11. Cf. John Dillon’s remark in this context in the introduction to Proclus,Commentary on Plato’s Parmenides, tr. Glenn R. Morrow and John M. Dillon (Princeton:Princeton University Press, 1987), xx: “The extreme realism of Proclus’ philosophicalposition leads to his postulation of distinct entities answering to each aspect of anhypostasis, but things become clearer if we think of them as just aspects after all.”12. These terms are, of course, taken from medieval Latin Neoplatonism. Butthe anachronistic terminology is justified in that it provides a succinct and accuratearticulation of Plotinus’ thought. The concept of complicatio-explicatio is entirelyPlotinian even if the words are not. See Thomas P. McTighe, “A Neglected Featureof Neoplatonic Metaphysics,” in Christian Spirituality and the Culture of Modernity: TheThought of Louis Dupré, ed. Peter J. Casarella and George P. Schner (Grand Rapids:Eerdmans, 1998), 27–49.13.

The concluding phrase could also be translated, “in the expression.” ForIntellect as the l¬goV of the One, i.e. its expression in intelligible multiplicity, seeV.1.6.45–46.15. On this point see Eric D. Perl, “ ‘Power of All Things’: The One as PureGiving in Plotinus,” American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly 71 (1997): 308.16.L¬goV, in Plotinus, implies a more multiple and differentiated expressionor presentation of a more simple and unified principle.17.

The phrase “tΩ pºnta ÷n pøsi” is of course one of Dionysius’ favoritescriptural citations (I Cor. 15:28), but Dionysius characteristically transposes theeschatological future into the metaphysical present.19. “Powers”: DN II.7, 645A; XI.6, 956A. “Participations”: DN II.5, 644A;II.7, 645A; V.5, 820A. “Processions”: DN I.4, 589D; II.4, 640D; II.11, 649B; V.1,816B; V.2, 816D. “Providences”: DN I.8, 597A; V.2, 817A. “Manifestations”: DNII.4, 641A. “Distributions”: DN II.5, 644A; II.11, 649C.20. This Platonic term for the making of the world connotes making by givingintelligible determination.21. The phrase “the measure of beings,” derived from Plato (Laws 716c4) viaPlotinus (e.g., V.5.4.14; VI.8.18.3) again implies the idea of God as the determina-tion of all things.22. This difference is the central thesis of E. Corsini, Il trattato ‘De Divinisnominibus’ dello Pseudo-Dionigi e i commenti neoplatonici al Parmenide (Turin: Giappichelli,1962).

This “divine difference” which is constitutive of all things has nothing todo with the trinitarian differentiation of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Dionysiusexplains that all the “names” to be discussed in the Divine Names, the names of Goddrawn from beings, are common to all three Persons (DN II.1, 636C, 637C; II.3,640B). The Godhead simpliciter—i.e. all three Persons indifferently, not the Fatheruniquely—corresponds to the Neoplatonic One. The production of being is commonto all three Persons (DN II.5, 644A), and being proceeds from, or is the manifestationof, all three Persons indifferently. Unlike Augustine and Eriugena, Dionysius ex-pressly does not introduce the trinitarian differences into his account of being astheophany. Cf. Balthasar, “Denys,” 156: “Denys strictly denies any distinction be-tween the functions and spheres of the three divine Persons in this world,” and ibid.,184–85: “[A]ny theology of an imago trinitatis in the creature is strictly rejected . . . Andthis rejection is the work of a pupil of Proclus for whom the whole structure of beingand the world has a triadic structure! One senses what sort of ascesis the Areopagiteimposed on himself with this constant renunciation. . . Only by directing our gazeupwards to the transcendent unity do we look in the direction of the trinitarianmystery.” This is not to say that Dionysius exalts divine unity or simplicity over thetrinitarian distinctions, since Dionysius’ God, like the One of Plotinus, is neither onenor many, neither simple nor complex. “The cause of all things is not one, one of themany, but before every one and multiplicity and determinative of every one andmultiplicity” (DN XIII.2, 977CD), and hence, “while hymned as monad and triad[monΩV...ka¥ triΩV], the divinity above all things is neither monad nor triad knownamong us or any other of beings” (DN XIII.3, 980D). Although trinitarian doctrineis fully present in Dionysius (see Golitzin, Et Introibo, 51–54), it does not enter intohis philosophical understanding of being as theophany.25. As Schäfer, Philosophy, 67 n. 26, points out, it is not in Dionysius but onlyin Eriugena that the term theophany (qeofºneia, theophania) becomes centrally impor-tant. Nonetheless, as Schäfer continues, “it quite neatly expresses what is meant here.”"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"123NOTES TO CHAPTER THREE26. Cf. 25 and 121 n. 13.27. Cf. Louis Dupré, The Other Dimension (New York: Doubleday, 1972), 129–30: “If the infinite is opposed to the finite, it is limited and thereby ceases to beinfinite. Instead we must show that the finite is in the infinite. Which means that ourinitial affirmation of the finite must be followed by a negation of the finite’s indepen-dent being. Such a negation cannot be provided by the argument which asserts theinfinite as also existing and thereby juxtaposes it to the finite. . . True infinity, there-fore, preserves the finite within itself.”28. Cf. Plotinus’ statement, quoted earlier, 26, that the One “has no other-ness.” God as “not other” is of course the theme of Nicholas of Cusa’s treatise De nonaliud, which is strongly influenced by Dionysius.29. Dodds, Elements of Theology, 217, commenting on Proclus’ doctrine thatthe effect is contained, or remains, in the cause and that its going forth depends ona point of view, remarks, “If this be pressed, it must mean that the separateness of thelower is an illusion resulting from a partial point of view, and it follows that thesensible and the intelligible cosmos are both of them appearance, and only the Onefully real.” He adds, “This doctrine was never accepted by the Neoplatonists, but theyoften seem to be on the verge of falling into it.” This comment exemplifies the failureto distinguish between illusion and appearance, and hence a failure to enter into thevery heart of the Neoplatonists’ thought about reality. It is true that for them “thesensible and intelligible cosmos are both of them appearance,” but it does not followthat they are “an illusion.”30. Cf. Balthasar, “Denys,” 164: In Dionysius we find “[m]anifestation con-ceived of in the Greek, not the Indian sense, as becoming visible in reality—not asmaya, mere seeming illusion, but always as (real) manifestation of the unmanifest, ofthe ever greater God who can never be changed into simply comprehensible appear-ance.” The reference to Indian thought may not be entirely just, for some forms ofHindu thought, notably that of Ramanuja, are strikingly similar to the Neoplatonicdoctrine of participation and manifestation.

This does not mean, of course, that Aristotle’s doctrine is identical withPlato’s. “The good,” for Aristotle, is not a universal: each thing has its own distinctgoodness. See esp. Nicomachean Ethics I.6, 1096a11ff.3. For form in general as good, see Physics I.9, 192a17.4. Jonathan Lear, Aristotle: The Desire to Understand (Cambridge: CambridgeUniversity Press, 1988), 295–96, argues that for Aristotle “the desire which Godinspires is none other than the desire of each organism to realize its form. . . [I]n trying torealize its form, the organism is doing all that it can do to become intelligible. It is"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"also doing the best job it can do to imitate God’s thought—and thus to imitate Godhimself.” (italics in original). The realized form in a thing is thus the result of itsdesire for God.5. Armstrong in his note ad loc. rightly remarks, “This is one of the funda-mental principles of Greek philosophical thought.”6. On this duality of expression see Gersh, From Iamblichus to Eriugena, 48 n.102.7. Dodds, Elements of Theology, 219–20, comments, “This is the converse ofprop. 31. We saw there that, given the metaphysical ™rc–, we can argue to theethical t°loV: here we argue from the ethical t°loV to the metaphysical ™rc–. Botharguments depend ultimately on the identity of the efficient with the final cause.”This identity in turn depends on the identity of both with the formal cause.8. See above 37. See also El. Th., prop. 144, where Proclus argues that “eventhe last kinds in the realm of existence are consequent upon gods. . . who revert eventhese toward the Good; and so also are the intermediate and the primal kinds. . . [I]fanything fall away from the gods and become utterly isolated from them, it retreatsinto non-being and disappears, since it is wholly bereft of the principles which con-stitute it.”9. See above, 26.10. This phrase could also be translated “subsisting by reversion,” and themeaning would be the same: the effect’s existing consists in its reversion.11. Thus L. J. Rosán, The Philosophy of Proclus (New York: Cosmos, 1949), 74,characterizes reversion as “essentially the logical connection between the cause andits effect but viewed from the opposite direction.” So also R. Beutler, “Proklos,” inPaulys Realencyclopadie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft 23/1 (Stuttgart: Metzler,1957), col. 212: “This reversion is dialectically indeed nothing other than the logicalconnection of cause and effect, but now viewed not from the cause but from theeffect,” and Dodds, Elements of Theology, 219: “Procession and reversion togetherconstitute a single movement, the diastole-systole which is the life of the universe.”The reference to “diastole-systole” is particularly illuminating, in that it indicatesprocession and reversion as another expression of the complicatio-explicatio structureof reality.12. Dionysius uses the expressions t¿ ™gaq¬n or t™gaq¬n and ™gaq¬thVinterchangeably with reference to God. See e.g. DN IV.1–2, 693B–696D; IV.4, 697C–700B.13. Or “subsist”; see above, 124 n. 10.14. Since remaining, procession, and reversion are not sequential butontologically simultaneous, the order in which they are expressed is unimportant.15. See 38.16. Following the traditional use of “love” to translate ⁄rwV and “charity” totranslate ™gºph, I translate ™gapøn as “cherish,” since this is the closest verbal formof charity in English. On the absence of any distinction in meaning between ⁄rwVand ™gºph, see 47–48.17. See 70–71.18. See 40.19. Cf. Dodds, Elements of Theology, 223. We shall see in chapter 6 thatintellection, discursive reason, and sensation are all subdivisions of “Wisdom,” i.e.cognition or consciousness in general.124NOTES TO CHAPTER THREE"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"20. Thus the commonplace that God creates us without our cooperation butcannot save us without it is, from Dionysius’ point of view, inadequate: God cannoteven create without the active cooperation of the creature. This point will be promi-nent in his account of evil.21. This insight is present in Plotinus in the form of his doctrine that allthings contemplate (III.8), that the life of a plant is a “growth-thought” [futik‹n¬hsiV], that of an animal a “sense-thought,” and so on. There is some form ineverything, and every form is an act-of-thinking at some level. “How, then, are theythoughts? Because they are rational principles [l¬goi]. And every life is a thought,but one is dimmer than another” (III.8.8.13–17). Since for Plotinus even the earthis living, this principle extends below plants to the things that are ordinarily consid-ered inanimate; see III.8.1.4, VI.7.11.18–35.22. For a survey of Plotinus’ doctrine of beauty, see Dominic O’Meara, “Textesde Plotin sur la beauté,” in Art et vérité, ed. I. Schussler, R. Celis, and A.

Westerink (Amsterdam:North-Holland, 1954), 221–22, 319–20.24.Commentary on the First Alcibiades, 330.25. DN IV.7, 701C. The pun on kºlloV/kaleƒn is derived from Proclus,Commentary on the First Alcibiades, 328.26. In Neoplatonism the distinction between the paradigmatic cause and theformal cause or determination is the distinction between reality and appearance: theparadigmatic universal appears in the effect as its formal determination. Hence the formalperfection of the effect is an image, in the sense of manifest presence, of the cause.27. See 32.28. See, e.g., John Rist, “A Note on Eros and Agape in Pseudo-Dionysius,”Vigiliae Christianae 20 (1966): 239; Cornelia J. de Vogel, “Greek Cosmic Love and theChristian Love of God,” Vigiliae Christianae 35 (1981): 57–81; and Lisa Marie EspositoBuckley, “Ecstatic and Emanating, Providential and Unifying: A Study of thePseudo-Dionysian and Plotinian Concepts of Eros,” Journal of Neoplatonic Studies 1(1992): 56.29. See 27.30. De Vogel, “Greek Cosmic Love,” 70, argues that “the One of Plotinus issuperabundant” and is “overflowing Goodness,” but that unlike Dionysius’ God “itcannot be said that it ‘goes out of itself, seeking the other’ ” and that it “stays withinitself.” This is strange indeed. We may observe: (1) What can “superabundant” pos-sibly mean if not that the One in some sense “goes out of itself”? (2) The words“seeking the other” are not found in Dionysius. His God can be said to “seek theother” only in the sense that he is in all things and reverts all things to himself; butthis is true of Plotinus’ One as well. (3) De Vogel fails to quote the end of therelevant passage in Dionysius, where he says not only that God “goes out of himself ”but that he does so ™nekfo√thton ...autou, “without going out from himself” (DNIV.13, 712B). Plotinus’ One and Dionysius’ God “goes out” “without going out” inthat he is (nothing but) “overflowing Goodness.” The idea that the One of Plotinusis “self-contained” is expressly contradicted by Plotinus himself, and depends on themisconception of the One as something, as a being, having some definite identity ofits own and therefore limited by that identity.31.

Th., props. 120, 122. The concept of divine ‘⁄rwVpronohtik¬V’ indicates that in Proclus ⁄rwV no longer necessarily connotes a lackor need, such that it could not be ascribed to God. See A. H. Armstrong, “PlatonicEros and Christian Agape,” Downside Review 79 (1961): 116–17, and Beierwaltes,Platonismus im Christentum, 72–73.33. See Beierwaltes, Platonismus im Christentum, 73.34. See above, 23–24.35. De Vogel, “Greek Cosmic Love,” 71, points out that “the term ⁄rwV...isabsent from the Elementa Theologiae and hardly occurs in the Theologia Platonica, andthis while the whole apparatus of such terms, as pronohtik¬V, ™gaqoeid–V, swstik¬V,teleiwtik¬V and sunektik¬V, is fully present in those works,” and concludes fromthis “that apparently the notion of eros was not essential to his theology.” To arguefrom this that Dionysius is significantly different from Proclus on this point is to focuson terminology to the exclusion of meaning, for it admits that everything Dionysiusmeans by ⁄rwV is centrally present in Proclus.36. See Rist, “Note on Eros and Agape,” 239, and Golitzin, Et Introibo, 68.Both Rist and Golitzin, however, see a real difference in content, not only in expres-sion, between Proclus and Dionysius on this point.37. For this doctrine in Plotinus, see Eric D. Perl, “ ‘The Power of All Things’:The One as Pure Giving in Plotinus,” American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly 71(1997): 312.38. Cf. Plotinus’ remark that the soul in its erotic ascent to the Good is “liftedby the giver of its love” (VI.7.22.19–20). See Jean Trouillard, “Processionnéoplatonicienne et création judéo-chrétienne,” in Néoplatonisme. Mélanges offerts aJean Trouillard (Fontenay-aux-Roses: Les Cahiers de Fontenay, 1981), 6: “Since thedivine communication would lose its value if God did not remain the Absolute, thedescent of God toward man is nothing other than the ascent of man toward God.”In fact this applies not only to man but to all things.39. Cf. the statement cited above, 44, that God “reverts all things.”40. Classically expressed by Anders Nygren, Agape and Eros, tr. P. S. Watson(London: SPCK, 1953).41. In saying that as Love God not only causes other things to move but ishimself moved, Dionysius directly targets the Aristotelian doctrine of God as theunmoved mover. This is not to say that Dionysius’ God undergoes any change oractualization of potentiality (which is what Plotinus and Proclus mean when theydeny that the One’s production of being is a “movement”) but rather that he isecstasy or overflow, not a self-contained being but productively “out of himself” and“in all things.” (See also DN IX.9, 916C, where Dionysius explains the sense inwhich God is unmoved as well as the sense in which he is moved.) Aristotle’s God,as pure form, being (o¶s√a), and intellect, keeps himself to himself. The God ofPlotinus and Dionysius, as not any being but “all beings and not even one,” “allthings in all things and nothing in any,” overflows, goes forth, or is differently presentin all things. The shift from Aristotle’s “unmoved” God to Dionysius’ God who asLove “is moved” is thus a restatement of the shift from God as form or being to Godas beyond being. Hence the difference between a God who is the object of love butdoes not love the world and a God who is not only beloved but also productivelyloves all things, is fundamentally a difference not between pagan and Christian butbetween Aristotelian and Neoplatonic conceptions of God.126NOTES TO CHAPTER THREE"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"42. On this problem in Dionysius see Golitzin, Et Introibo, 79, 82–83.43. See K.

Temporini (New York: De Gruyter, 1987), II.36.1, 994–1032, fora discussion of the issue with extensive references to the literature on it.44. Since the One is not a being, these superlative phrases should be inter-preted to mean “more perfect than all” and “more powerful than all beings.” As boththe beginning and the conclusion of the passage indicate, the One is not “the mostpowerful being,” but rather productive power itself. For this meaning of the superla-tive with a genitive, see Herbert Weir Smyth, Greek Grammar, rev. Gordon M.Messing (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1956), 334, §1434.45. See Trouillard, “Procession,” 8: “The processive movement, strictly speak-ing, is neither necessary nor contingent. Neither necessary, since it creates, along theway, its own laws. Nor contingent, since it invents at once the possible and the real.Which should not be surprising, since these modalities cannot regulate a radicalproduction,” (italics in original).46. This temporal formulation indicates of course not temporal but ontologi-cal priority and hence means simply that the One is not conditioned by his produc-tion of beings.47. Cf. Trouillard, “Procession,” 6: “ ‘God is love’ signifies ‘God gives himselfto his creatures.’ ”48. It is ironic that Plotinus has been condemned by Christian thinkers bothfor saying that God does not “care for” his products and for saying that he is condi-tioned by a necessary relation to them, when in fact the sole meaning of the firstclaim is the denial of the second.49. Cf. Gerson, Plotinus, 28: “[T]he putative necessity by which the One actscannot be really distinct from the One or indeed from its will. . . So, to say that theOne acts by necessity could mean nothing else but that it acts according to itswill. . . [I]f the One acted by a necessity really distinct from it, then this would setup, counter to Plotinus’ express argument, a real relation between the One and whatit produces.” Cf. also Trouillard, “Procession,” 5: “What necessity is concerned here?Certainly not a logical or dialectical necessity. The absolute simplicity of the Goodprevents establishing with regard to it any deduction whatsoever .. . Nor is the ne-cessity of procession a necessity of indigence, as if the Absolute could add somethingto itself in manifesting itself. . . The only necessity to which the Neoplatonists givevalue here is the necessity of superabundance or of generosity” (italics in original).50. Obviously Dionysius, like Proclus in a similar context, is using the term“being” loosely here, since properly speaking God does not have being.51. For God as unrelated (†schtoV), see DN I.7. 596D; IV.16, 713C; V.6,820DV.8, 824B; IX.9, 916C.52. See above, 44.53. For a less nuanced presentation of a similar position (apart from the unfor-tunate ascription of “Being” to God), see Philip Sherrard, Human Image: World Image.The Death and Resurrection of Sacred Cosmology (Ipswich: Golgonooza, 1992), 157:“[T]here is a higher form of freedom, a paradoxical ‘determinative’ freedom, which isnot merely a liberty of choice. This freedom which is attained in apparent determinismis not a negative indeterminacy . . . ; it is a positive natural spontaneity.

Boese (Berlin: De Gruyter, 1960).2. On Dionysius’ alterations to Proclus’ account of evil, see Carlos Steel,“Proclus et Denys: De l’existence du mal,” in Denys l’Aréopagite et sa posterité en Orientet en Occident, ed. Ysabel de Andia (Paris: Institut d’Etudes Augustiennes, 1997),89–116.3. This is how Steel, “Proclus et Denys,” 96, reads Dionysius’ doctrine, whichhe therefore judges to be greatly inferior to that of Proclus.4. See, e.g., Aquinas, Summa Theologica I, Q. 5, art. 3, resp.5. See, e.g., V.8.7.23–24, where Plotinus says that “this universe is all form”and that even matter is “a sort of ultimate form,” evidently meaning that matter isnot a positive reality other than form and that it is a product of the Good.6. On this point see also I.8.4.25–33 and I.8.15.13–15, 19–23.7. The quoted words are from Plato, Timaeus 34b8.8. Since Proclus’ da√moneV are wholly good spiritual beings, it would beextremely misleading to translate this term as “demons.”9. The reference is to Plato, Letter II, 312e1–3.10. Cf. Proclus, De malorum subsistentia 7.48 and 38.14–18.11. Cf. Steel, “Proclus et Denys,” 101.12. Here we may appropriately translate da√moneV as “demons,” for in Dionysius,contrary to Proclus, they are not wholly good but are fallen angels.13. Dionysius does not indicate who says this, but “they” must certainly in-clude Plotinus.14. On the difference between Dionysius and Plotinus on this point, seeTrouillard, “Le cosmos du Pseudo-Denys,” 56: “Plotinus judges that souls are ill in-sofar as they are not sufficiently minds. Dionysius treats minds as souls.”15. This reflects Proclus’ doctrine of evil in souls as weakness of activity.16. Cf. Proclus, De malorum subsistentia 49.5–6, 12–13.17. The principle that all activity aims at some good is found not only in Plato(e.g., Republic VI, 505e1, Symposium 204e–205d) but also in Aristotle (e.g., NicomacheanEthics I.1, 1094a1).128NOTES TO CHAPTER FOUR"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"18. Cf. the remarks of Trouillard, “Procession,” 20, on the relation betweendivine and creaturely causality in Aquinas, in connection with the Neoplatonicdoctrine of self-constitution: “The more man acts, the more God acts. Grace does notlimit freedom, it is freedom itself (participation in the divine freedom), which isfundamentally something gratuitous. One would be not able to say: If man createshimself, he has not use for God. Quite the contrary, he manifests in that itself thepower of God, capable of producing genuine causes and not beings which could affirmthemselves only against him.”19. On the connection between multiplicity and non-being in this passage seeGolitzin, Et Introibo, 178.20. Cf. Proclus, De malorum subsistentia 44.11–12.21. Perhaps significantly, he says not ™no–rwV, “unintellectually” (which wouldmerely be an expression of the common patristic tradition that the fall is a fall froma purely intellectual condition), but ™no–twV, “unintelligibly”: the fall itself cannotbe understood.22. Cf. John Jones, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. The Divine Names andMystical Theology: Translated from the Greek with an Introductory Study (Milwaukee:Marquette University Press, 1980), 86–87: “The question ‘Why is there evil at all?’is a mistaken question; for, it seeks an ultimate cause where there is none. However,in denying the legitimacy of this question we do not seek to explain evil away; rather,we indicate that evil is uncaused and unexplainable.”23. Dionysius’ view of evil as deficiency of being and hence as uncaused andunintelligible is thus closely comparable to Augustine’s, although Augustine thinksmore of efficient causality and Dionysius more of final causality. Having traced theorigin of evil back as far as the will of a rational creature, Augustine then says, “Letno one, then, seek an efficient cause of an evil will. For its cause is not efficient, butdeficient, because the evil will itself is not an effect of something, but a defect...Nowto seek the causes of these defections, which are. . . not efficient causes, but deficient,is like wishing to see darkness or hear silence. . . Thus, too, our mind perceivesintelligible forms by understanding them; but when they are deficient, it knows themby not knowing them; for ‘who can understand his failings?’. . . [T]he will is madeevil by nothing else than the defection by which God is forsaken: a defection ofwhich the cause, too, is certainly deficient.” Augustine, The City of God against thePagans, ed. and tr.

The divine procession Wisdom includes all modes of cognition, from angelicintellection down to the sensation of irrational animals. The distinctions of thevarious modes of cognition within Wisdom will be discussed in chapter 6.3. Dionysius substitutes the biblical term Wisdom (sof√a) for the philo-sophical term Intellect (no£V), but the meaning remains the same. Sof√a was occa-sionally used in this sense by non-Christian Neoplatonists as well; see e.g. Plotinus,V.8.4.37, V.8.5.1–3, 15–20.129NOTES TO CHAPTER FIVE"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"4. See Dodds, Elements of Theology, 232.5. Strictly speaking, for Proclus, only the henads are gods, while terms suchas Being, Life, and Intellect are lesser causes which derive their being and causalpower from their proper henads. But Proclus also uses the term ‘god’ more loosely, tocharacterize various terms subordinate to the henads. See Dodds, Elements of Theol-ogy, 261.6. On the supposed difference between Proclus and Dionysius on this point,see e.g. Roques, L’univers dionysien, 78–81, esp. 78 n. 3; Ivanka, Plato Christianus,260–61; Gersh, From Iamblichus to Eriugena, 154ff.7. See 121, n. 11.8. Thus Dodds, Elements of Theology, 260, observes that “the principle of con-tinuity in the vertical procession involved the splitting of each god into a series ofgradually weakening forces, so that Zeus, for example, appears as five different gods eachof whom symbolizes the ‘jovial’ principle on a different plane of reality.” By the sametoken, we may say that every god “symbolizes” the One on a different plane of reality.9. In view of the principle of continuity in Proclus’ “series” (El. Th., prop.145), this is true not only of the henads themselves but of all the lower levels ofdivinity derived from them as well.10. The real meaning of Proclus’ many divinities is well expressed in Plotinus’reply to the Gnostics’ denial of such “gods”: “It is not contracting the divine into onebut showing it in that multiplicity in which God himself has shown it, which isproper to those who know the power of God, inasmuch as, abiding who he is, hemakes many gods, all depending upon himself and existing through him and fromhim. And this universe exists through him and looks to him, the whole of it and eachand every one of the gods in it, and it reveals what is his to men” (II.9.9.36–42).Need Christians quarrel with this? It should rather be directed against the narrow“monotheism” which regards the world as by nature “profane” rather than as theophanyand God as a unitary being rather than as “all things in all things and nothing inany.” Just as the God of Dionysius and the Neoplatonists transcends the oppositionbetween theism and atheism, so he transcends that between monotheism and poly-theism, for he is strictly speaking neither one nor many in any positive sense.11. Edward P. Butler, “Polytheism and Individuality in the Henadic Mani-fold,” Dionysius 23 (2005): 83–103, argues persuasively for a more robust interpreta-tion of Proclus’ polytheism. He concludes, 98, “Procession by unity is not a matterof the manifold of the henads vanishing into the One, as if the henads were but‘aspect,’ ‘adumbrations’ or ‘perspectives’ of the One. The One is not one, and itspurpose is not the subordination of multiplicity. The characteristic the henads possessin common is none other than irreducible uniqueness and individuality. . . In accord,then, with the conclusion of the First Hypothesis of the Parmenides that the Oneneither is, nor is one, we should say that the One is as each henad, each God, ratherthan as the hypostasized entity that, for our own convenience, to be able to refer todivine activity in generic fashion, we refer to as ‘the One itself.’ ” Nonetheless, asButler admits, the henads do have “irreducible uniqueness” in common, and each godis a mode of unity (see El. Th., prop. 133). It is precisely as a mode of unity that eachgod is the ground of being for all that falls below it. In this and only in this sensethe henads are “aspects” of the One. As we have seen, to posit the One as the causeof beings means only that every being is a being by unity.130NOTES TO CHAPTER FIVE"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"12. See also DN IV.3, 697A: “All beings and even non-being itself desirethe Good.”13. Intellect here stands in the place of Being, as containing in itself all forms.14. In this way the standard, and clearly correct, interpretation of Dionysius’“non-beings” as matter may be reconciled with the alternative reading offered byJean-Luc Marion, God without Being, tr. Thomas A. Carlson (Chicago: University ofChicago Press, 1991), 77–78: “[T]he absence of all perfection, even ontic, alreadydesignates the place and the instance of a radical desire. The less the nothing has ofperfection, the more it will desire perfection. . . The less than nothing aims at theRequisite [i.e. the Good] through its absolute desire itself.”15. The bracketed insertions are necessary to show that the prepositional phrasesbeginning with “above” (•p°r) are adverbial, modifying “are,” “live,” and “think andknow,” rather than adjectival, modifying “the divine intellects.”16. Cf. again the Aristotelian dictum, “To be, for a living thing, is to live.”17. Cf. Dom Denys Rutledge, Cosmic Theology: The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy ofPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite: An Introduction (New York: Alba House, 1964), 22–23 n. 2.18. See above, 42 and 125 n. 21.19. Dionysius’ account of justice could thus be regarded as a universalizationof Plato’s account of justice as “every part doing its own work” in the soul and in thecity: Republic IV, 443a–e.20. So, e.g., Andrew Louth, Denys the Areopagite (London: Chapman, 1989),84–85; Ivanka, Plato Christianus, 258–60, 271; Golitzin, Et Introibo, 142–45.21. Cf. Semmelroth, “Qeolog√a sumbolik–,” 4: “Where the Areopagite nowby preference portrays God’s creation as radiation of divine light, not only does thefact comes to light that the things are from God, but also that in the things some-thing of the essence of the creating God shows through. From here on the Pseudo-Areopagite’s entire theology of creation becomes a theology of light.”22. Cf. the response to Roques on this point by Jean Trouillard, “Le cosmosdu Pseudo-Denys,” Revue de théologie et de philosophie, Série 3, 5 (1955): 53: “DoesDionysius separate himself on this point from the Plotinian tradition? René Roquesbelieves so. . . [Roques holds that] the God of Dionysius indeed communicates hispower of unifying and illuminating, calls in mediations, he does not at all delegatehis creative efficacy. But this restriction is something difficult to conceive withinNeoplatonism. In this idealist context where the substance is in no way distinct fromthe operation, illumination comes back to creation. To produce a term different fromhimself, is for the One to create; but to assimilate this term to its principle, is againfor this principle to create.”23. See also e.g. VI.8.18.1–3: “And you when you seek, seek nothing outsidehim [the One], but seek within all things which come after him. . . For he himselfis the outside, the encompassment and measure of all things. Or within in depth.” Asthis indicates, “All things in the One” coincides with “the One in all things.”24. Proclus’ doctrine is exceptionally well expressed by Trouillard, “Proces-sion,” 11: “The continuity of procession rests therefore on a permanent communica-tion of the processive power of the One. Every ontological focus participates in itsfecundity to the point of engendering itself and engendering beings similar or inferiorto itself.” And again, ibid., 12: “According to Neoplatonism, the communication of131NOTES TO CHAPTER FIVE"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"processive power is not such that the One would cease to act or that he would actonly indirectly through his derivatives without being immediately present to them.In reality, the One is always immediately operating, because every efficacy is a modalisationof unity. . . Every subordinate cause plays within the more comprehensive causalitywhich upholds it. The derived efficacy uses, in particularizing it, the operation whichinvests it. Thought determines life, the latter particularizes being, which itself is amode of unity. Nothing has power except by the omnipresent power of unifyingunity. The number of mediations changes nothing in this” (italics in original).25. See above, 23–24.26. Dionysius’ doctrine of hierarchy could thus be read as an elaboration ofMatthew 20:25–27: “ ‘You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, andtheir great men exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; butwhoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be firstamong you must be your slave.’ ” The higher any being is in the order of reality, themore it is in the service of—in Dionysius’ terms, providentially proceeds to—all thatis below it. Cf. the contrast of Dionysian hierarchy to the “vulgar” or “political”model of hierarchy by Marion, The Idol and Distance, 163–64, 170.27. More clearly than any other interpreter of Dionysius, Rutledge, CosmicTheology, 14 n. 1, sees how this overcomes the conventional opposition betweendirect and mediated production: “If the whole being and activity of each member isreceived it seems to matter little whether we say he or God creates the one imme-diately below. The immanence and transcendence of God. . . must be stated withexactly the same emphasis. . . If we say that God creates each member of the hierar-chy immediately, then. . . we must add immediately that each member is God, atexactly this level of manifestation or creation” (italics in original).28. Cf. Louis Bouyer, Cosmos (Petersham, MA: St. Bede’s, 1988), 200.29. Dionysius’ doctrine of hierarchy thus constitutes an exception to Trouillard’sclaim, “Procession,” 12: “Too often Christian thought about the universe goes fromthe parts to the whole and not from the whole to the parts. . . It declares God theauthor of things visible and invisible, and not of the visibles by the mediation of theinvisibles. . . Except for Eriugena, we do not find a Christian doctor who overcomesthis lack and here rejoins Neoplatonism.” Such an exception should be no surprisein Dionysius, the student of Proclus and principal source of Eriugena.30. The full connotations of this word cannot be captured in a single trans-lation: “given into their hands,” and in that sense entrusted to them (sc. to be passedon to others); “lent,” and so not primally theirs, but God-in-them; and “shown” or“manifested” in them. See A Greek-English Lexicon, ed. Henry George Liddell andRobert Scott, 9th ed., s.v., ÷nd√dwmi.31. See Marion, The Idol and Distance, 162–71. See also Louis Bouyer, TheChurch of God, tr. C. U. Quinn (Chicago: Fransiscan Heralds, 1982), 258–60. ButBouyer, 258–59, and to a lesser extent Marion, 165, erroneously contrast this to aconventionally caricatured Neoplatonism.32. Such a doctrine should be the less troublesome to Christians in that it issimply the principle of sacramentality: the celebrant of any sacrament acts in personaChristi, and his sacramental activity is that of Christ. In Dionysius, this sacramentalprinciple, in which the activity of the creature is the activity of God-in-it, is ex-tended to all reality, which, as theophany, is sacramental in nature.132NOTES TO CHAPTER FIVE"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"33. The contrast is between “by nature” (f§sei) and “by placement” (q°sei),the latter meaning “by participation.”34. Again see Marion, The Idol and Distance, 166: “[T]he gift cannot be re-ceived unless it is given, for otherwise it would cease to merit its name. The basinis not filled up by the cascade from above unless it ceaselessly empties itself into thebasin below. . . To receive the gift of God, as gift, requires of man that he himselfimmediately welcome the gift in its essence—as a giving act. . . To receive the giftamounts to receiving the giving act, for God gives nothing except the movement ofthe infinite kenosis of charity, that is, everything. . . Receiving and giving are there-fore achieved in the same act.” See also Bouyer, Cosmos, 200: “[T]he variousdegrees. . . of the Dionysian hierarchies, are simply so many relays for communicat-ing what the higher beings can keep for themselves only by sharing freely with others(as pseudo-Dionysius explicitly asserts). And. . . it is still the gift of God, i.e., notonly something he gives, but in the final analysis his very self.”35. Balthasar, “Denys,” 149, insightfully suggests that Dionysius’ pseudonymityshould be understood in terms of this aspect of his thought, “[o]n the level. . . of thespecifically Dionysian humility and mysticism which must and will utterly vanish asa person so that it lives purely as a divine task and lets the person be absorbed (asin the Dionysian hierarchies) in taxis and function.”36. Cf. Marion, The Idol and Distance, 165.37. See e.g. John Meyendorff, Christ in Eastern Christian Thought (Washingtonand Cleveland: Corpus Books, 1969), 82.38. Dionysius does not develop the consequences of hierarchy with regard toevil; but it clearly implies that if any being fails to perform its proper function theorder of the whole is impaired, just as, in a choral dance, if one dancer gets out ofstep the entire dance is disrupted. See Marion, The Idol and Distance, 168: “[T]hatwhich a redundancy does not manage to translate of the original gift. . . willbe missed by all the other redundancies. This means that a failure defeats notso much the one who commits it as the one near him, and so on. . . This is alsocalled sin.”39. Significantly, this is the same word Dionysius uses at DN IV.13, 712B todescribe how God as ecstatic love goes out from himself “without going out fromhimself.” See 46.40. See above, 79.41. For hierarchy as the communion of saints, see Balthasar, “Denys,” 192;Marion, The Idol and Distance, 168–70. An illustration of Dionysian hierarchy as thecommunion of saints may be found in Dante’s Divine Comedy, Inferno II, whereDante recounts Virgil’s recounting of Beatrice’s account of how she came to him.Beatrice says, “Love moved me,” alluding to God as the Love that moves all things,and then explains that the Virgin Mary sent St. Lucy to send Beatrice to send Virgilto rescue Dante. Dante’s salvation is thus effected by Love, or God, in Mary, Lucy,Beatrice, and Virgil.CHAPTER SIX1. E.g. Rorem, Pseudo-Dionysius, 92–94.2.

Michael Chase (Chi-cago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), 23, 27. See also A. C. Lloyd, The Anatomyof Neoplatonism (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), 126: “What makes a non-phenomenological description of any hypostasis inadequate is Neoplatonic ideal-ism. The hypostases are experiences; they are types of consciousness; while, therefore,they have abstract and objective properties, they have also what we call phenom-enological properties.”4. Cf. Gerson, Plotinus, 164: “The governing principle for the interpretationof the various modes of cognition of incarnate individuals in that they are all imagesand inferior versions of the form of cognition that is found in the ™rc–,Intellect. . . Plotinus holds that intellection. . . entails an identification of subjectand object. Inferior forms of cognition—images of the highest form—involve increas-ing qualifications of this identification in the direction of the externalization of theobject in relation to the subject. Thus, a form of cognition is in proximity to theparadigm according to the extent to which it identifies with its object.”5. See also the more extended presentation of the same argument in V.5.1–2.6. To interpret Plotinus’ famous “flight of the alone to the alone” as a solip-sistic self-isolation is thus a profound misunderstanding. When Plotinus says that thesoul must ascend “alone,” he means that it must free itself from the impurities whichconsist in its failure to be perfectly intellectual (see e.g. I.6.5.46–53). But it is pre-cisely these impurities that isolate the soul from other beings, while the overcomingof them brings it into communion with all reality.7. See above, 21.8. Cf. Deck, Nature, Contemplation, and the One, 110: “Plotinus does nothave two worlds, but only one. His world of true being is not, except metaphorically,a world above the everyday world. It is the everyday world, not as experienced bysense, by opinion, or by discursive reasoning, but as known by intellect, the Nous, theKnower.” Deck’s entire chapter here is an excellent exposition of this aspect ofPlotinus’ thought. See also Armstrong, “Introductory Note” to VI.7, 79: “In the endwe are left with the very strong impression that for Plotinus there are not two worldsbut one real world apprehended in different ways on different levels.”9. See also VI.2.21.52–53 for the presence of bodies in Intellect.10. Cf. Semmelroth, “Qeolog √a sumbolik–,” 9: “In [Dionysius], as for Greekthought in general, a communion of knowledge is, at an entirely level than in ourthought, a kind of communion of being.”11. On the angels as “models” for human intelligence, see Golitzin, Et Introibo,144–45.12. The representation of intellection by circular motion goes back at least toPlato, Laws X, 898a3–b3. The comparison of sense to a line and intellect to a circlewas evidently a stock analogy in the Platonic school by the time of Plotinus: see V.1.7.8and Armstrong’s note ad loc. The entire threefold analogy found in Dionysius occurs inHermias, EÎV t¿n PlºtwnoV Fa ƒdron sc¬lia, ed. P. Couvreur (Paris: Librairie EmileBouillon, 1901), 20–21. See Gersh, From Iamblichus to Eriugena, 75, n. 229.13. Cf. Jones, Divine Names, 44: “[In Dionysius] there is not a plurality ofworlds but one world which can be seen and known in different ways. Thus we canknow all that is in the most unified and complete way, through contemplation ofintelligible beings, or we can know things in the least unified and complete waythrough the sensation of sensible beings.”134NOTES TO CHAPTER SIX"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"14. See above, 26.15. Here we may remember Plotinus’ comparison of the One to light, whichcannot be seen by itself but which, in differentiated forms, is the only object of all sight.16. The list of cognitive faculties is taken from Plato’s Parmenides andNeoplatonic commentaries on it.17. Cf. Jones, Divine Names, 44: “For Pseudo-Dionysius, in all knowledge wealways see and know the divinity, for the divinity is all in all.”18. Cf. Balthasar, “Denys,” 179: “Denys contemplates the divine symbols increation and the Church with an aesthetic delight. Things are not simply the occa-sion for his seeing God; rather, he sees God in things. Colours, shapes, essences andproperties are for him immediate theophanies.” Again, ibid., 182: “One can only withdifficulty resist the temptation to quote profusely the theological portrayals by thispoet of water, wind and clouds, and particularly of the fragrance of God, the delight-ful interpretations that go right to the heart of such things as bodily eating anddrinking and the assimilation of food, sleeping and waking.” Nothing could be fartherfrom the common view of Dionysius as a denigrator of the senses and the sensible.19. See Rutledge, Cosmic Theology, 15–16, esp. 16 n. 1: “In this traditionbodily sight is but the lowest, the most superficial, ‘material’ aspect of a single activityin which all sight and knowledge, and indeed the very being of man and his world,is ‘sight’ and ‘knowledge’ of God.”20. The question of whether Dionysius’ mysticism is based on “experience” isirrelevant here, where our purpose is to provide a philosophical account of its mean-ing. The interpretation of mysticism in terms of “experience” has in any case recentlyand rightly been subjected to criticism as distinctively modern. See Michael Sells,Mystical Languages of Unsaying (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994), 214: “Ifthe nonintentionality claims of apophatic mystics are taken seriously, and if experi-ence is, by definition, intentional, it necessarily follows that mystical union is not anexperience. All experience must have a grammatical object, but the prime motivationof apophatic language is to subvert or displace the grammatical object . . . If it is truethat all experience is constructed, it is equally true that the concept of experience isa modern construct . . . The apophatic mystic speaks of the birth of the son in the soul,of annihilation, of an awakening without an awakener, but does not speak of ‘theexperience’ of such birth, annihilation, or awakening.” This is emphatically the case forDionysius, with the substitution of “union,” “darkness,” “unknowing,” for “birth,” “an-nihilation,” etc. See also Golitzin, Et Introibo, 31–32. On this issue with regard toPlotinus see John Bussanich, “Plotinian Mysticism in Theoretical and ComparativePerspective,” American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly 71 (1997): 339–65.21. See above, 12–13.22. See above, 24–26.23. Armstrong is unwilling to translate ⁄kstasiV as “ecstasy” because, he saysin his note ad loc., “there is no good reason for describing the mystical union accord-ing to Plotinus as an ‘ecstasy.’ It gives a very misleading impression of this austere andquiet mysticism.” This seems unduly cautious in view of I.6.5.6–8; I.6.7.12–17; andVI.7.35.24–26, where Plotinus speaks of Intellect in contemplation of the One as“out of its mind” (†frwn), “drunk,” and “in love.”24. The reference to ÷pibolΩV or paradocΩV makes a clear allusion toPlotinus, VI.7.35.22–26: “Intellect also, then, has one power for thinking, by whichit looks at the things in itself, and one by which it looks at what transcends it by a135NOTES TO CHAPTER SIX"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"direct awareness and reception [÷pibolŒ tini ka¥ paradocŒ] . . . And that first oneis the contemplation of Intellect in its right mind, and the other is Intellect in love,when it goes out of its mind ‘drunk with the nectar.’ ” In this context, Dionysius’ useof “™fair°sewV” may also be an allusion to Plotinus.25. Here Dionysius is paraphrasing the same passage in Plotinus referred to inthe previous note. On the allusions to Plotinus in these passages see MichaelHarrington, “The Drunken Epibole of Plotinus and its Reappearance in the Work ofDionysius the Areopagite,” Dionysius 23 (2005): 131–32.26. Literally “of the above all being and knowledge”: the verb is, creating amanifest contradiction, is not present in the Greek.27. Although the imagery of “divine darkness” is not found in Plotinus (seeWerner Beierwaltes, Denken des Einen [Frankfurt: Klostermann, 1985], 149), the samemeaning is present in phrases such as “You will not think” and “Take away everything.”28. Cf. MT I.3, 1001A, where Dionysius similarly speaks of Moses, in mysticalunknowing, “being all of him who is beyond all things, and of nothing, neither ofhimself nor of another.”29. Cf. Proclus, El. Th., prop. 124, and De Malorum Subsistentia, 61.18–20.30. This formulation has a distinctly Eriugenian sound; but Eriugena’s doctrineon this point is already present, although less explicit, in Dionysius.CHAPTER SEVEN1. On the Symbolic Theology see DN I.8, 597B; IV.5, 700D; IX.5, 913B;XIII.4, 984A; MT III, 1032A; Ep. IX.1, 1104B.2. For a good account of the metaphysical basis of Dionysius’ symbolic the-ology, see Semmelroth, “Qeolog √a sumbolik–,” 1–11.3. At CH II.5, 145A, Dionysius refers to the description of God as a wormin Psalm 22:6.4. Cf. Semmelroth, “Qeolog √a sumbolik–,” 6: “The conceptual expressionstill always itself remains a kind of symbol.”5. Cf. Semmelroth, “Qeolog √a sumbolik–,” 8–9: “As a Neoplatonist thePseudo-Areopagite certainly represents a strong realism of symbols. . . Between signand signified in the symbol obtains not only a connection of knowledge, but also aconnection of presence. . . In the thought of the Pseudo-Areopagite the symbol isrealistically bound with the symbolized.”6. This could more literally and daringly be rendered “become,” and such areading would make sense on the basis of what we have seen in chapter 6: in theabsolute unification of cognition we do not merely see but become the darknessbeyond being.7. Cf. Marion, The Idol and Distance, 140–43.8. The phrase tΩ pºnta ™fairo£men again recalls Plotinus’ †fele pºnta.9. Cf. O’Rourke, Pseudo-Dionysius, 9: “Dionysius uses [proballein] in two closelyrelated significations to convey the same fundamental reality from distinct viewpoints,namely both the veiling and the unveiling or unfolding of God through creation.”10. See A Greek-English Lexicon, s.v., probºllw.11. On the latter point see VI.7.16.1 and esp. V.5.12.36–38.136NOTES TO CHAPTER SEVEN"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"12. The term s§nqhma is used interchangeably with s§mbolon in lateNeoplatonic theurgical texts. See R. M. van den Berg, Proclus’ Hymns (Leiden: Brill,2001), 70, 79, 126.13. See e.g. Rorem, Pseudo-Dionysius, 25.14. In opposition to the “esoteric” reading of such passages see Golitzin, EtIntroibo, 153–54: “[I]t does not appear to us that the Areopagite is doing much morethan referring here to a basic fact of the spiritual life. There are degrees of knowledge,of receptivity to truth, and of advancement in it. . . The ‘sacred veils’. . . embrace anascending series of revelations adapted to the believer’s progress in love, simplicity,purification from selfish imagination, and consequent capacity for contemplation.”15. O’Rourke, Pseudo-Dionysius, 9, taking ‘prob°blhtai’ in the passive ratherthan the middle voice, translates this, “ ‘the creation of the visible universe is a veilbefore the invisible things of God (prob°blhtai, literally, is placed before).’ ”16. The phrase pºntwn ™fair°sei again recalls Plotinus’ †fele pºnta.17. CH I.4, 177D.18. According to A Greek-English Lexicon, s.v., ÷xaggel√a, an ÷xºggeloV is a“messenger who brings out news from within: hence, one who betrays a secret, in-former,” and, in the context of the stage, a “messenger who told what was doing inthe house or behind the scenes (opp. †ggeloV, who told news from a distance).”Dionysius’ angel is thus not merely a “messenger,” but one who reveals somethingwhich remains hidden, and indeed hides it by revealing it, in that narration takes theplace of direct portrayal. Here as elsewhere, the precise connotations of Dionysius’carefully chosen term are essential to his philosophical meaning.19. Immediately before this (DN I.4, 592BC) Dionysius has traced a parallelascent within the eschaton itself from sense to intellect to “the union above intellect.”20. This passage again overturns the interpretation of Dionysius as a despiserof the sensible.21. Cf. Balthasar, “Denys,” 169: “The same knowledge of God demands botha deeper penetration into the image and also a more sublime transcendence beyond it,and the two are not separated one from another but are the more fully integrated, themore perfectly they are achieved” (italics in original).22. Cf. Jones, Divine Names, 60: “Yet is it only in the God-man Christ that thedivinity takes on being? Is only the God-man Christ an incarnation of the divinity inwhich it takes on being? For the procession and reversion of all beings is the processionand reversion of the divinity out of itself and about itself; in its procession and reversionthe divinity itself stands out of itself . . . But, then, does not the divinity itself take onbeing in its ecstasis? Are not beings an ‘incarnation’ of the divinity?”23. Cf. Philip Sherrard, The Rape of Man and Nature. An Enquiry into theOrigins and Consequences of Modern Science (Ipswich: Golgonooza, 1987), 26: “[T]hehumanization of God is fully in accord with the divine nature as such. . . God’stranscending of His own transcendence in an outgoingness through which He be-comes immanent in His creation. . . is an act of creative self-expression withoutwhich the divine itself would remain incomplete. There is a divine as well as ahuman form of ecstasy.” Sherrard does not refer to Dionysius in this connection, butthe parallelism, not only in concept but in terminology, is striking.24.

Unlike the predominantly theological or text-histori-cal studies which constitute much of the scholarly literature on Dionysius, Theophany is completely philosophical in nature, placing Dionysius within the tradition of ancient Greek philosophy and emphasizing, in a positive light, his continuity with the non-Christian Neoplatonism of Plotinus and Proclus. Eric D. Perl offers clear expositions of the reasoning that underlies Neoplatonic philosophy and explains the argumentation that leads to and sup-ports Neoplatonic doctrines. He includes extensive accounts of fundamental ideas in Plotinus and Proclus, as well as Dionysius himself, and provides an excellent philosophical defense of Neoplatonism in general.“This is, in many ways, the book for which teachers in the fi eld have been wait-ing: a book that clearly and fully sets out the philosophical logic in Dionysius in a way accessible to undergraduate students and yet tackles the most vexed and controverted questions so strongly as to make it a necessity for gradu-ate students and scholars in the fi eld. Eric Perl has produced a remarkable unifi cation of philosophy and accurate historical scholarship, something very rare.” — Wayne J. Hankey, author of One Hundred Years of Neoplatonism in France: A Brief Philosophical History“Dionysius is an extremely important Christian Platonist in his own right and also for the enormous impact he had on medieval philosophy. Getting his metaphysics right is essential, and Perl has done an outstanding job articulat-ing his philosophical genius.” — John Bussanich, author of The One and Its Relation to Intellect in Plotinus: A Commentary on Selected TextsERIC D.
