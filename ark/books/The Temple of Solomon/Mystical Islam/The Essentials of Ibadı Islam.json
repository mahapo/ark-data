I did some follow-up on this research when I returned to Oman for a two-month period in February and March 2010 on a scholarship from the Carnegie Corporation. My interest in Ibadism was sparked initially by two summers of research in Zanzibar. In summer 1998, I went to Zanzibar with a travel grant from the University of Illinois’ Center for African Studies, and the following summer I went specifi cally to study Ibadism in Zanzibar with a Wil-liam and Flora Hewlett award granted by the Offi ce of International Programs and Studies at the University of Illinois. I was granted some relief from teaching in order to concentrate on my research, thanks to an appointment as an associate in the Center for Advanced Study at the University of Illinois in spring 2003. I am very grateful for all the support that has made this book possible.My research sponsor in Oman was Professor Ibrahim Soghayroun, the infi -nitely gracious and patient chairman of the Department of History at Sultan Qaboos University. I owe Dr. Soghayroun a very great debt of gratitude for his help, his wise counsel, and his friendship during my time in Oman. His wife and family also off ered hospitality to me and my daughter.

Th ey were the fi rst to write a commentary on the Qur’an, the fi rst to write a collection of Hadith, and the fi rst to write a book on Law (fi qh). (Al-Harithi 1974, 3)So writes a modern Ibadi scholar of Oman, in words that express a point of view common among adherents of this sect. Ibadi Islam is a distinct sect of Islam that is neither Sunni nor Shi‘ite. Although, as the quote above indicates, Ibadis see their sect as the oldest and most authentic form of Islam, they remain largely a mystery to other Muslims and even to many scholars of Islam, among whom the study of Ibadism has been “the game of the happy few.”1 Both Mus-lim and non-Muslim scholars of Islam tend to call Ibadis “moderate Khawarij,” the only Kharijite sect that survived aft er the fi rst two tumultuous centuries of Islam. For their part, contemporar y Ibadis regard it as an insult to be considered Khawarij, though this was not always the case (Hoff man 2009), although they recognize that their sect originated in the Kharijite secession of 37 AH/657 CE.2 From their point of view, the Khawarij erred so thoroughly in castigating other Muslims as unbelievers worthy of death that they removed themselves from the pale of Islam. In recent decades, the points of rapprochement between Sunnism and Ibadism have been emphasized. Ibadis read Sunni writings and oft en quote them with approval, especially the Hadith collections of al-Bukhari, Muslim, 1. Josef van Ess, at the “Ibadhism, Ibadhi Studies, and the Sultanate of Oman” conference at Aristotle University, Th essaloniki, November 9–10, 2009. 2. Th e “AH” dates refer to the Islamic calendar, which began “aft er the hijra.” Islamic dates are given before CE (“common era,” i.e., Gregorian) dates, separated by a slash."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"4 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamand others.3 Nonetheless, Ibadis maintain a special interest in Kharijism, and even if they are interested in distinguishing themselves from the Khawarij, they feel compelled to defend the Khawarij on a number of points (Al-Harithi 1974, 36–80; Al-Sabi‘i 1999).Ibadi Muslims complain, with some justifi cation, that although they read the works of all other Muslim sects, none of the scholars of the other Muslim sects read Ibadi works, and oft en choose to reiterate false information rather than study the works written by Ibadis themselves. An Ibadi scholar of modern Libya, ‘Ali Yahya Mu‘ammar (1919–1980), wrote a two-volume work on the place of Ibadism among the Islamic sects (Mu‘ammar 1972). Th e entire fi rst volume is a study of the faulty information on Ibadism found in both old and new works written by non-Ibadi Muslims, and some by non-Muslim scholars as well.Th is book is an attempt to introduce Ibadi Islamic theology to students and scholars of Islam,4 mainly through annotated translations of two basic Ibadi theological texts, in order to address the general unavailability of Ibadi texts to all but the most specialized scholars of Islam. Th e focus of this study is Ibadi theology, not law, in which the diff erences with Sunni Islam are minor, although some subjects that are covered in this book have implications for both theology and jurisprudence, such as the status of sinning Muslims and the rules for spiri-tual association (walaya) and dissociation (bara’a).Such academic studies on Ibadism as do exist, with two exceptions (Cuperly 1991; Ennami n.d.), largely ignore theology and focus mainly on political history 3. Hadith is the body of literature that contains narratives about what the Prophet said and did—that is, his Sunna. Th e Hadith collections of Muhammad b. Isma‘il al-Bukhari (194–256/810–870) and Muslim b. al-Hajjaj (206–261/821–875), both entitled Al-Jami‘ al-sahih [Th e Authentic Collection], are considered the most sound and authoritative collections. Th ese collections are oft en referred to simply as “al-Bukhari” and “Muslim” or Sahih al-Bukhari (the Sahih of al-Bukhari) or Sahih Muslim. Less reliable but frequently used are Sunan collections of Abu ‘Isa Muhammad b. ‘Isa al-Tirmidhi (210–279/825–892), Abu ‘Abdallah Muhammad b. Yazid b. Maja (known as Ibn Maja, 209–273/824 or 825–887), Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman Ahmad b. ‘Ali al-Nasa’i (215–303/830–915), and Abu Dawud Sulay-man b. al-Ash‘ath al-Sijistani (202–275/817–889). “Hadith” with a capital H refers to the literature as a whole, and “hadith” with a lowercase h refers to a particular narrative.4. In order to make this book comprehensible to students of theology who are not specialists in Islam, I provide some information that is unnecessary for scholars of Islam (such as the comments on Hadith in n. 3 and the summary of the events of the great fi tna that led to the formation of sects in Islam)."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Introduction • 5and theory.5 Indeed, much of the interest in Ibadism among Western scholars concerns its role in the development of early Islamic thought. Th e relative lack of interest in Ibadi theology may be partly because Ibadi literature is oft en very long, dry, dense, and diffi cult to understand. Th at is why I selected Nasir al-Rawahi’s theological primer as the centerpiece of this book, although very few people, Ibadi or otherwise, have read it:6 it is an unusually brief text intended as a primer for Ibadi theology students. It condenses and clarifi es concepts that otherwise must be learned through a very arduous process, while allowing us to hear the voice of an Ibadi scholar trained in the classical tradition. Th e one draw-back of this text is that al-Rawahi appears to have died before completing it. For this reason, I have included a translation of ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Th amini’s discussion of the relationship between God’s power and human acts, a topic of tremendous importance in Islamic theology but omitted from al-Rawahi’s primer.Th e Origin and Political History of the IbadiyyaTh e history of Ibadi Islam, like the history of Sunni and Shi‘i Islam, is inextrica-bly linked with the controversies over leadership of the Muslim community that developed during the reign of the third caliph, ‘Uthman b. ‘Aff an (23—35/644–656),7 and the events following his assassination on 18 Dhu ’l-Hijja 35/17 June 5. Ennami’s book, based on his Ph.D. dissertation (Cambridge University, 1971), contains valuable information, but the English is not very good and the book is not readily available. Both Cuperly and Ennami include translations of some brief Ibadi creeds. Besides the works of Cuperly and Ennami, the most important studies on early Ibadism in Western languages include Cook 1981; Madelung 2006; Crone and Zimmerman 2001; Gaiser 2010; Lewicki 1953, 1955, 1962; Savage 1997; van Ess 1992, vol. 2; and Wilkinson 1982, 1985, 1987, 1990, 2010. Many of these are source-critical studies of Ibadi origins, with the exception of Wilkinson 1990, which lists major Ibadi sources but does not explain Ibadi theol-ogy. Ersilia Francesca has written a number of articles on Ibadi law. On aspects of modern Ibadism, see Eickelman 1989; Ghazal 2005a, 2005b, 2010; and Hoff man 2004, 2005, 2009. For a complete bibliogra-phy of Ibadi publications and secondary literature on Ibadism, see Custers 2006.6. Th e grand muft i of Oman, Shaykh Ahmad b. Hamad al-Khalili, and some students at the Insti-tute of Shari‘a Sciences have read this text, but I have never found any references to it except for in A. al-Khalili 1993.7.

Sunni political theory as articulated by al-Mawardi argued that the caliph must belong to the Prophet Muhammad’s tribe, Quraysh. All the caliphs up to al-Mawardi’s time—the “rightly guided caliphs” (11—40/632–661), the Umayyad caliphs (40—132/661–750), and the ‘Abbasid caliphs (132—656/750–1258)—had in fact belonged to this tribe. Shi‘i Muslims believe that the leadership of the Muslim community must be more narrowly placed within Muhammad’s immediate family. Th ey believe that Muhammad appointed his cousin and son-in-law, ‘Ali b. Abi Talib, as his suc-cessor, and although ‘Ali did become the fourth caliph aft er ‘Uthman’s assassi-nation, the Shi‘a see the fi rst three caliphs as usurpers of the power that rightly belonged to ‘Ali from the time of the Prophet’s death in 11/632. Some early Shi‘i sects, including the one that played an active role in the ‘Abbasid revolution, did not limit leadership to ‘Ali and his descendants who were descended from the Prophet, but allowed the imamate (leadership) of other descendants of ‘Ali, and even descendants of the Prophet’s uncle, al-‘Abbas. But when the ‘Abbasids came to power in 132/750, they championed Sunni Islam, and aft erward the Shi‘a limited the imamate to the descendants of ‘Ali and Muhammad’s daughter, Fatima.9 Western historians largely reject as fabrications of history Shi‘i claims that Muhammad appointed ‘Ali as his successor and say there is no evidence that Muhammad appointed anyone as his successor. Madelung (1997) suggests 8. Th is section lays out this history in a form that adheres to the Ibadi point of view—a view-point that has been vigorously debated and challenged by Western scholars, most notably Wilkin-son (2010). As important as that project is in contemporary scholarship, it is not the task of this book. Th e forces driving the confl icts in early Islam were, in reality, multiple and complex and can-not be reduced to theoretical diff erences over the nature of Islamic leadership; they include struggles over the allocation of Iraq’s resources aft er the last of the great conquests in that region in 639–640 (cf. Hinds 1971).9. Th e term imam (“leader”) has religious connotations and can be used in many diff erent con-texts—an imam is someone who leads congregational prayer; in classical Sunni literature, “imam” and “c a l i p h” (khalifa, meaning “successor” or “deputy”) were interchangeable titles for the supreme ruler of the Islamic empire; and among Sunni Muslims today “imam” may be an honorifi c title applied to supe-rior scholars—but among the Shi‘a, “imam” as a title means the only legitimate leader of the Muslims, chosen by God from among the descendants of ‘Ali and Fatima. In Ibadism, the imam is a righteous ruler who is selected by the leading men of the community and rules according to Islamic dictates."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Introduction • 7that the succession of Abu Bakr was not as unproblematic as modern historians have supposed, and that ‘Ali may indeed have expected to assume leadership on the death of the Prophet.Th e Ibadi perspective on the early caliphate diff ers from that of both Sunnis and Shi‘a. From their point of view, the only legitimate way to come to power is not through familial or tribal affi liation or through divine selection, but through selection by the leading men of the Muslim community. Th e only way to main-tain legitimate government is by ruling according to Islamic law. Any infringe-ment of those rules, or any commission of a grave sin or persistence in a minor sin, makes one unfi t to be a ruler of the Muslims, and it is the Muslims’ duty to remove such a person from power. Th e Ibadis believe that the fi rst four caliphs, Abu Bakr (ruled 632–634), ‘Umar b. al-Khattab (ruled 634–644), ‘Uthman b. ‘A ff an (ruled 644–656), and ‘Ali b. Abi Talib (ruled 656–661), were all selected on the basis of religious merit, not on tribal or familial affi liation, so they all came to power in a legitimate fashion. Th ey see Abu Bakr and ‘Umar as righteous rulers who committed no grave sins throughout their caliphates. Th ey divide ‘Uthman’s twelve-year rule into a six-year period of righteous rule and a six-year period of unrighteous rule. As Madelung notes (1997, 85–87), this perspective was very common among ‘Uthman’s critics, but the policies of nepotism and distribution of lands conquered by the Muslims were already in place in the early years of his caliphate. ‘Uthman’s tendency to appoint as governors of the provinces his own relatives—who were oft en capable but unprincipled leaders—and his allocation of the proceeds of the conquests to his kin were controversial among many pious Muslims of the time.10 Muslim soldiers stationed in Egypt and Iraq converged on ‘Uthman’s residence in Medina, demanding his repentance and a change in policy. ‘Uthman promised to meet their demands and the soldiers dispersed, but soldiers returning to Egypt intercepted a letter allegedly written by ‘Uthman to his governor in Egypt ordering him to kill the rebels. Th e second siege of ‘Uth-man’s home in Medina ended in his assassination (Madelung 1997, 78–140).10. Today ‘Uthman’s collection of the Qur’an and destruction of variant versions is oft en hailed as the crowning achievement of his reign, but at the time it was resented as an unwarranted demon-stration of authoritarianism. However, this event does not fi gure prominently in Ibadi discussions of early Muslim history."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"8 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ IslamTh e assassination of ‘Uthman immediately exposed confl icting points of view concerning the qualifi cations of a ruler. Some Muslims, especially members of ‘Uthman’s own clan, the Banu Umayya, felt that ‘Uthman’s policies were justifi -able interpretations of the Qur’an, and that he was not obligated to implement the policies of his predecessors, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. From this perspective, his kill-ing was an outrageous murder of a righteous Muslim who had been legitimately selected for leadership of the community. On the other hand, other Muslims felt that ‘Uthman had failed to rule by Islamic laws, that he had wrongly favored his own kinsmen (who included the former rulers of Mecca who were the Prophet’s main antagonists and who embraced Islam very late in Muhammad’s career), and persecuted those pious Companions of the Prophet who had criticized his policies and those of his governor in Syria, his kinsman, Mu‘awiya b. Abi Sufyan. From their point of view, ‘Uthman had committed grave sins, failed to repent, and clung to leadership despite widespread discontent. He had abdicated his responsibility to the people and his right to rule, and his adamant refusal to step down neces-sitated the drastic action of assassination. For some Muslims, the group that came to be called the Khawarij (singular Khariji/Kharijite), commission of a grave sin and failure to repent nullifi es faith; such a person has apostatized from Islam and deserves execution. In short, ‘Uthman’s killing raised a host of contentious ques-tions concerning the relationship between faith and works, the defi nition of a Muslim and an unbeliever, and the proper qualifi cations for a Muslim ruler.‘Ali b. Abi Talib’s election as fourth caliph was not a true shura (consu lt a-tion) as mandated by ‘Umar b. al-Khattab on his deathbed. It was, as Madelung describes it, “irregular . . . supported by the rebels from the provinces [who had participated in ‘Uthman’s assassination] and the Ansar [Muslims of Medinese origin] disenfranchised by Abu Bakr,” and “left the Community deeply divided into three factions” (Madelung 1997, 146). Many prominent Muslims, includ-ing the Prophet’s youngest wife, ‘A’isha, blamed ‘Ali for ‘Uthman’s death, and the fact that ‘Uthman’s assassins remained unpunished among ‘Ali’s supporters strengthened the impression of complicity. Aft er suppressing a revolt in Basra, ‘Ali faced his most dangerous opposition, led by Mu‘awiya b. Abi Sufyan, ‘Uth-man’s cousin and governor in Syria. ‘Ali’s main base of support was in Kufa, a military garrison city in Iraq. Th eir two armies met at Siffi n, on the right bank of the Euphrates River in what is today eastern Syria. Th e armies are said to have stayed there for seventy-seven days, reluctant to shed blood in a confl ict that split"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Introduction • 9tribes and families, before battle was joined in Safar 37/July 657. In the course of the battle, as ‘Ali’s soldiers pressed hard against their opponents, Mu‘awiya’s troops are said to have tied copies of the Qur’an to the end of their lances as a call to subject to arbitration the question of whether or not ‘Uthman was justly killed. Despite his initial reluctance, ‘Ali acquiesced to this request, to the outrage of a signifi cant segment of his followers, who promptly abandoned him on the battle-fi eld.11 Th ese were known as the Muhakkima, because of their slogan, “Judgment (hukm) belongs to God alone,” and as al-Khawarij, “those who go out.” Th is last appellation is usually interpreted to mean those who left ‘Ali’s camp, but is inter-preted diff erently by some Ibadi writers, as we shall see.From the Kharijite point of view, ‘Uthman, by virtue of his grave sins, was an apostate deserving of death, and Mu‘awiya and his followers, who claimed the right to avenge that death, were likewise guilty of apostasy. ‘Ali’s right to rule had been self-evident from his selection by the leading righteous men of the com-munity and by his protection of ‘Uthman’s assassins. But now that he had agreed to subject the matter to human arbitration and negotiate with “unbelievers,” he himself had become an unbeliever. Th ey felt compelled to withdraw from the 11. Hinds (1971, 364–65) says that ‘Ali was pressured to acquiesce to the arbitration by the Qur’an reciters (qurra’) of Kufa, the very group that later led the secession in protest of this same acquiescence. Th ey initially favored arbitration because they believed that the arbitration would result in peace and acceptance of ‘Ali’s leadership. However, when ‘Ali agreed to omit his caliphal title of “Commander of the Faithful” from the agreement, and also agreed that the arbiters could make their judgment based on custom in addition to the Qur’an, the qurra’ turned against the arbitration, arguing that “ judgment belongs to God alone.” Signifi cantly, the matter that was to be decided by the arbiters was not specifi ed. ‘Ali may well have understood it to be the rightness of his leadership, a matter on which he might have anticipated a ruling in his favor. Perhaps this is why he allowed the selection of one of his less enthusiastic partisans as arbiter. Th e question on which they ultimately issued a decision, however, was the rightness of ‘Uthman’s assassination, and the decision that he was unjustly killed was interpreted by many as a ruling in favor of Mu‘awiya’s claim to the right of revenge and the demand that ‘Ali punish the assassins. As Madelung points out, however, this demand overlooks the fact that some of the main agitators who instigated the assassination (e.g., ‘Amr b. al-‘As and ‘A’isha) were then among the greatest rabble-rousers calling for revenge and rebellion against ‘Ali. Th e number of those who left ‘A l i a ft er his return to Kufa was several thou-sand; some historians place the number as high as 12,000 or 14,000, and their numbers swelled as they were joined by others discontented with ‘Ali."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"10 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamsociety of “unbelievers” in a new emigration (hijra), following the example of the Prophet’s emigration from Mecca to Medina, in order to build a just Muslim society.

Wahb al-Rasibi, whom the Khawarij selected as imam aft er their withdrawal from ‘Ali’s camp. Ibadis use the term Wa hbi (from ‘Abdallah b. Wahb’s name) to refer to what they see as the purest version of Islam; the title of the theological primer translated in this book is Al-‘Aqida ’ l-Wahbiyya, “Th e Wa hbi Creed.” Th e author of this primer, Nasir b. Salim b. ‘Udayyam al-Rawahi, was also a great poet known as Abu Mus-lim, who wrote a poem in praise of the courage and faith of the thousands of Kharijite soldiers, including Ibn Wahb, who met their death in battle against ‘Ali at Nahrawan on 9 Safar 38/17 July 658 (Al-Qasida ’ l-Nahrawaniyya, in al-Rawahi 1987, 7–16), a battle that in truth was a massacre that undermined the legitimacy of ‘Ali’s caliphate (Vecca Vaglieri 1999). Modern Ibadi scholars have defended the Kharijite secession and the Kharijite verdicts on ‘Uthman, ‘Ali, and Mu‘awiya. According to the Algerian Ibadi scholar, Muhammad b. Yusuf Atfayy-ish (1820–1914), the term Khawarij was originally praiseworthy, meaning “those who go out to struggle (jihad) in the way of God,” but because of the negative connotations the term acquired, “our companions do not call themselves by this name, but call themselves ‘the people of straightness,’ ahl al-istiqama,” a refer-ence to the Qur’anic prayer that God would “guide us to the straight path” (Q 1:5), in contrast to “those who go astray” (Q 1:7), because of the Ibadis’ “straight-ness in practicing their religion.” On the other hand, says Atfayyish, the epithet “people of the Sunna” [which came to mean the Sunni Muslims] was originally an insult, referring to Mu‘awiya’s custom (sunna) of cursing ‘Ali from the pulpits. “When [the Umayyad Caliph] ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz [reigned 99–101/717–720] stopped that sunna, people began to think that ‘people of the sunna’ referred to the Sunna (practice) of the Prophet. All of this is explained by al-Mas‘udi” (cited in al-Harithi 1974, 70–71).12 Ibadi scholars point out that the Kharijite camp 12.

His assassination left the fi eld open for Mu‘awiya to seize power. Mu‘awiya’s capital was Damascus, and his successors were members of his clan, the Banu Umayya. Th e Umayyad dynasty ruled from 41/661 until their overthrow by the ‘Abbasids, who made Baghdad their capital and ruled the vast but increasingly fragmenting Islamic empire from 132/750 until the Mongol conquest in 656/1258.Not all those sympathetic with Kharijite ideals about personal piety and righteous leadership believed it imperative to separate from the larger Muslim community or go out to wage war. One of the earliest of these “quietist” (qa‘ada) Khawarij was Abu Bilal Mirdas b. Udayya al-Tamimi (d. 61/680–681), a Kharijite leader from Basra, in southern Iraq. Brother of one of the instigators of the Khari-jite secession and a veteran of the massacre at Nahrawan, he nonetheless dis-agreed with the more violent tactics of the Khawarij, which included acceptance of the principle of isti‘rad, religious assassination. Basra became a major center of moderate Kharijism, and Abu Bilal is seen as a precursor of the Ibadiyya.Kharijite rebellions posed a serious threat during the civil wars that plagued much of the Umayyad period aft er the death of Yazid I, Mu‘awiya’s son and suc-cessor, in 64/683. Th e earliest and most violent Khawarij were the Azariqa or Azraqites, followers of Nafi ‘ b. al-Azraq, who conquered Basra in 65/684, opening the doors of the prisons there and assassinating the governor. Outraged Basrans of the Azd tribe, of Omani origin, expelled the Azraqites, and Nafi ‘ was killed in battle the following year. ‘Abd al-Malik b.

Lewicki suggests that he hoped to come to an understanding with the new caliph, and two letters are said to have been written by Ibn Ibad to ‘Abd al-Malik b. Mar-wan (Lewicki 1953a). However, Cook (1981, 51–64) presents convincing evidence"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"12 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamthat not only is the second of Ibn Ibad’s purported letters spurious, but the fi rst letter was probably written by the man whom Ibadis see as Ibn Ibad’s succes-sor at Basra, “Abu ’l-Sha‘tha’” Jabir b. Zayd, and that the addressee was probably not ‘Abd al-Malik b. Marwan but ‘Abd al-Malik b. al-Muhallab. Jabir b. Zayd was an eminent authority and a close associate of the Prophet’s cousin, ‘Abdallah b. al-‘Abbas, one of the most important early authorities on Hadith and Qur’an interpretation.13 Jabir is generally seen as the true organizer of the Ibadi sect, although Wilkinson (1982, 133–36) argues against this proposition. Jabir hailed originally from Oman, from the small town of Farq near Nizwa, and belonged to the Azd tribe, which had many important representatives among the moderate Khawarij of Basra.14 For many years Jabir had friendly relations with the power-ful Umayyad governor of Iraq, al-Hajjaj b. Yusuf, who apparently saw the moder-ate Khawarij as a bulwark against the growth of Kharijite extremism.When ‘Abd al-Malik b. Marwan died in 86/705 and was succeeded by the pious ‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-‘Aziz, many moderate Khawarij hoped for the realization of their dreams of a righteous Islamic imamate. Th ey were disappointed, and many of the new qa‘ada leaders wanted to embrace a more activist stance toward jihad. Jabir himself felt compelled to take action, and instigated the assassination of one of al-Hajjaj’s spies (Lewicki 1953a). Th is led to a complete rupture in the relatively friendly relations the moderate Khawarij had enjoyed with the Umayyad regime. Al-Hajjaj imprisoned many of them, and others were exiled to Oman.Among those imprisoned in Iraq was a prominent scholar and student of Jabir b. Zayd, Abu ‘Ubayda Muslim b. Abi Karima al-Tamimi. Released from prison aft er the death of al-Hajjaj in 95/714, he is seen by Ibadi tradition as the second Ibadi 13. Jabir is oft en said to be a Hadith scholar, but the “sciences” of Hadith scholarship had not yet been developed. Wilkinson (1985, 245) comments, “Certainly there is a mass of material con-cerning Jabir but it is almost entirely concerned with his legal opinions and practices and in this there is little sign of his quoting precedent, let alone hadith for establishing them.” Nonetheless, Jabir fi gures frequently in the isnads of hadiths in Sunni collections.14. Th e relationship between tribalism and Ibadi movements in early Islam is elaborated in Savage 1997. Wilkinson (1987) makes similar observations with regard to the imamate in Omani history. It is ironic that although Ibadi theory regarding the imamate is that lineage should not be a factor in the selection of an imam, in reality imams have oft en been selected in dynastic succession, or at least in particular families."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Introduction • 13imam (Lewicki 1953a). Inclined at fi rst to come to terms with the Umayyads, his fear of schism among the moderate Khawarij led him to embrace a diff erent strat-egy. He established missionary teams called hamalat al-‘ilm, “bearers of knowl-edge,” to propagate Ibadi teachings and promote anti-Umayyad insurrections in provinces that were less susceptible to immediate Umayyad control, like Khurasan (in northeast Persia), Oman, Yemen, the Hadramawt region (in the southeast of the contemporary republic of Yemen), and the Maghrib. Th e moderate Khawarij of Basra embraced a strategy later called kitman, living in a state of “concealment”—that is, not openly espousing political rebellion, though they were well connected with the rebellions occurring in the provinces. Th e man who is recognized as the third Ibadi imam and author of the authoritative compilation of Ibadi Hadith, al-Rabi‘ b. Habib, migrated to Oman.15 Increasingly, in response to persecution, the Ibadis were pushed to the margins of the Islamic empire.Th e fi rst Ibadi state was established in 128/745 in the Hadramawt under the leadership of ‘Abdallah b. Yahya al-Kindi, known by the nickname Talib al-Haqq (seeker of truth). He was able to conquer San‘a’, in northern Yemen, in late 129/746, and from there moved on to capture the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Th is imamate ended when Talib al-Haqq was killed in battle at the end of the Umayyad period in 139/748. One of Talib al-Haqq’s followers, an Omani named al-Julanda b. Mas‘ud, fl ed to Oman, where he was elected imam of a new Ibadi state—a short-lived eff ort that lasted only two years (132–134/750–752), ending in an ‘Abbasid military expedition in which the imam was killed.

Wilkinson (1985, 245–46) points out that “a fundamental characteristic of the propagation of early Ibadism was that ‘ilm was transmitted ver-bally and not in writing.” He examines the components of what became the Ibadi Hadith collection, and notes that “al-Rabi’s name only comes into the picture in connection with Dumam’s riwayat and even then not he, but a pupil, or even a pupil of a pupil, set the material down. I would suggest that his name has been introduced as a deliberate smoke screen to imply that these Athar, whose existence was attested but few had seen, were the actual source for the Musnad; an implication taken up by Shammakhi.”"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"14 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ IslamTr ipol i, i n present-d ay nor t hwester n L ibya , a nd i n 141/758 he c apt u red Qay rawa n (Kairouan), in present-day Tunisia, the chief city of Islamic Ifriqiya (Africa).

Th e Rustamid Imamate, as it is known, lasted—though not without schisms and political crises—until it was overthrown by the Shi‘ite Fatimids in 296/909. Although Ibadi communities remained in small pockets in the Jabal Nafusa mountain range of northwestern Libya, the island of Jirba (Djerba) off the southeast coast of Tunisia, and the Mzab valley of Algeria, the Ibadi imamate ceased to exist.In Oman, however, aspirations to establish a righteous imamate became a recurring theme in its tumultuous political history, riven by confl icting religious and tribal aspirations. Th e imamate of al-Salt b. Malik (237–273/852–879) ended with his deposition, and aft er this the imamate was contested between rival fac-tions headed by the towns of Nizwa and Rustaq. Th e imamate of al-Khalil b. Shadhan b. Salt b. Malik (406–425/1016–1034) inaugurated a period of important scholarly refl ection and exchanges between the Ibadis of Oman and the Hadra-mawt, although the rivalry between Oman’s two chief cities of Ibadi scholar-ship continued. In the middle of the twelft h century the imamate collapsed when the Nabhani family came to power in Oman, a period seen by Ibadi historians as riven with tyranny and bloodshed, although “[i]n fact, the Nabahina muluk [kings] ruled exactly like most Imams, through manipulating tribal and secular power, but without pretension to religious legitimacy” (Wilkinson 1987, 12). New imamates arose in the early fi ft eenth century, but Oman was reunited under an Ibadi imamate only with the establishment of the Ya‘rubi dynasty in 1024/1615, which lasted until the founding of the Bu Sa‘idi dynasty, some time between 1154/1741 and 1167/1753.16Th e founder of the Bu Sa‘idi dynasty, Ahmad b.

Sayyid Sa‘id b. Sultan (ruled 1220–1273/1806–1856) commanded an empire that extended over Oman and the East African coast, and in 1247/1832 he transferred his capital from Muscat to Zanzibar.

Qays. ‘Azzan succeeded in subduing or gaining the support of most of Oman, and even man-aged to oust the Wahhabis from the Buraimi oasis, which they had conquered sixty years earlier; since then, the government of Oman had been forced to pay a tribute that the government in Riyad called zakat (the religious tax that is one of the fi ve pillars of Islam). However, Th uwayni’s brother, Turki b. Sa‘id, who had been living in exile in Bombay, was allowed by the British to return to Oman in March 1870, and he lost no time in trying to raise a force to overthrow ‘Azzan.

Indeed, an abortive coup intended to place Barghash b. Sa‘id on the throne of Zanzibar in place of his brother Majid was motivated in part by Majid’s acquiescence to the division of the Omani empire in order to retain his throne, as Th uwayni was the stronger of the two.

In Arab parlance, “the night of 29 January” would correspond to the night of 28 January or the predawn hours of 29 January, but Kelly (1968, 707) gives 30 January as the date of the imam’s death. Al-Salimi also informs us that the imam’s body remained unburied for three days, without suff ering any obvious decomposition—a classic sign of sainthood in Islam.20. Pelly’s communication with British authorities in India indicates that he did not see Britain as providing any guarantee of al-Khalili’s safety, but Kelly, who is very critical of Pelly’s conduct in Oman, wrote that al-Khalili certainly thought that Pelly was providing him with just such a guaran-tee (Kelly 1968, 708). Nur al-Din al-Salimi saw Pelly as betraying al-Khalili’s trust, and did not know what had happened to al-Khalili aft er he was turned over to Turki (A. al-Salimi 2000b, 296). Turki told Pelly that al-Khalili and his son had died of diarrhea (Kelly 1968, 699), but according to Nur al-Din al-Salimi’s son Muhammad (M. al-Salimi n.d., 82), al-Khalili and his son were buried alive. According to Hamza b. Sulayman al-Salimi, the great-grandson of Nur al-Din al-Salimi, it was the author of the primer translated in this book, “Abu Muslim” Nasir b. Salim al-Bahlani al-Rawahi, who discovered what happened to them (personal conversation with the author, Nov. 2000). Al-Rawahi was hosting a visitor in his home in Zanzibar, a Shi‘ite from the Mutrah area of old Muscat, who entertained his host with stories from Oman. He said that one day during the reign of Sultan Turki, the sultan brought out Shaykh Sa‘id b. Khalfan and his son and placed them in a hole. Th e crowd began to mock them and throw stones at them, and al-Rawahi’s Shi‘ite guest also threw his sandal at Shaykh Sa‘id’s face. As al-Rawahi heard this story, he began to tremble. He rose and told his guest, with the utmost gravity, “Get out, before I kill you.” Th e Shi‘ite knew this was no joke, and fl ed. Al-Rawahi later lamented the tragedy and the contemptible treatment of a noble scholar and leader with whom he closely identifi ed, in a poem entitled Watani [“My Country”] (al-Rawahi 1986, 321).

Rashid al-Kharusi in the al-Jabal al-Akhdar (“Green Mountain”) region of the interior that had always been the heart of the Ibadi impulse in Oman. But this movement was not able to conquer the coast, and Oman was eff ectively divided between the sultanate in Muscat and the imamate in the al-Jabal al-Akhdar region. Th is division was formalized by the British-offi -ciated Treaty of Sib (Seeb) in 1920, and remained in eff ect until December 1955, when Sultan Sa‘id b. Taymur reunited Oman under his rule. An initially success-ful rebellion against the sultan by leaders of the former imamate in June 1957 was quenched by a combined Omani-British force (Peterson 1978, 180–94; Valeri 2009, 51–58). It has been suggested that some of the “Islamic extremists” recently arrested in Oman, who include university professors and scholars of Ibadi law, are not linked in any way to the terrorist policies of al-Qa‘ida (al-Qaeda), but were trying to establish a new Ibadi imamate (BBC News 2005a, 2005b).Th e Development of Ibadism as a Distinct Sect of IslamAs Wilkinson points out, in traditional Ibadi historiography the Khawarij are seen as a more or less monolithic block, from which the Ibadis split in 64/683. Th ey say that their imamate, seen as a coherent line of succession beginning with Jabir b. Zayd, existed for decades in a concealed state (kitman) (Wilkin-son 1982, 125), until the establishment of the fi rst Ibadi political imamate in the Hadramawt in 128/745. Wilkinson deconstructs this perspective by pointing out, among other things, that not all the Khawarij “united under ‘Abdallah b. Wahb’s banner at Nahrawan,” but rather the Khawarij were split early between militants (shurat, those whose lives were “purchased” in the cause of Islam) and quietists (qa‘ada). Th e most important proponent of the quietist position is said to have been ‘Abdallah b. Ibad, about whom very little is known. Indeed, Wilkin-son ponders the possibility that his leadership was a later projection and that “his name was probably resuscitated at a later stage because it provided a convenient label to contrast with the Azariqa: the eponym of the third ‘color’ label, the Suf-riyya, is probably a complete fabrication.” (“Ibadi” suggests a link with abyad [white], while “Azraqi” suggests a link with azraq [blue] and “Sufri” with asfar [yellow].) Wilkinson says that the quietist Khawarij were almost entirely lacking"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"18 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamany political organization at this period. Wilkinson also points out that some of the men claimed by the Ibadis as their leading fi gures are also claimed by other schools, and they include people “whose attitudes and actions are not really rec-oncilable with Ibadi views, or who can at best only be considered sympathizers” (ibid., 132–33). Wilkinson doubts that Jabir had any formal leadership among the nascent Ibadis, and asserts that he could not have ordered the execution of Khar-dala, a former Ibadi accused of betraying the movement (ibid., 134). Ennami also doubted that Jabir had any formal leadership: “In my personal opinion he was no more than a religious leader to whom his followers came to learn Islam, and to ask questions concerning religious matters” (Ennami n.d., 57).As we have seen, the questions that led to the formation of the Kharijite sect were the status of gravely sinning Muslims and the defi nition of the Muslim community and its leadership. Ibadi doctrine on these pivotal issues was several centuries in the making, during which Ibadis debated many issues among them-selves. In the early ‘Abbasid period, disputes concerned questions such as whether Friday prayer was required in the absence of a righteous imamate, how to classify degrees of sin, and how to draw the boundaries of the community, in addition to debates on theological issues that were discussed among scholars of the broader Muslim community: interpreting the anthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Qur’an, the relationship of reason to revelation, the essence and attributes of God, and whether the Qur’an was created or uncreated. A number of Ibadi subsects developed out of these debates, beginning in the fi rst half of the second/eighth century. One of the earliest of these subsects were the al-Harithiyya, who are said to have broken from Abu ‘Ubayda by accepting the Mu‘tazilite position of free will. Two other early groups, usually mentioned together in discussions of Ibadi history, though their relationship is uncertain, were the ‘Umayriyya, fol-lowers of ‘Isa b. ‘Umayr, and the Husayniyya, followers of Ahmad b. al-Husayn of Tripoli, Libya. Ahmad b. al-Husayn wrote one of the earliest Ibadi treatises on theology, Kitab al-Maqalat, followed by a work on jurisprudence, Mukhtasar fi ’l-fi qh. Among the distinctive doctrines of these sects was that no one who believes in God, even if his beliefs contradict those of Islam, can be called a poly-theist. It is said that the Husayniyya were won back to mainstream Ibadism by Abu Yahya Zakariyya b. Ibrahim al-Baruni in the seventh/thirteenth century.By far the most important split within the Ibadiyya occurred when a group known as the Nukkar (“Deniers,” also called the Nakkara or al-Nakkariyya)"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Introduction • 19denied the legitimacy of the second Rustamid imam, ‘Abd al-Wahhab b. ‘Abd al-Rahman (168–208/784–823), demanding that he subject all decisions to the consensus of the leading men of the community and agree to abdicate if a more worthy candidate than he were discovered. However, the theological schism began earlier, during the leadership of Abu ‘Ubayda in Basra, with the composi-tion of Kitab al-rudud, one of the oldest works on Muslim theology, by ‘Abdallah b. Yazid al-Fazari, one of the early leaders of the Nakkari schism. He and several associates were expelled by Abu ‘Ubayda from Ibadi assemblies, but it is said that they repented and were reinstated, but reasserted their views aft er Abu ‘Ubayda’s death (Cuperly 1991, 34–35; Ennami n.d., 181). Th ey were also known by other names, most importantly al-Nakitha, al-Nakkatha, and al-Nukkath, meaning “violaters,” because they violated their oath to ‘Abd al-Wahhab. Th e Nukkar are said to have followed ‘Abdallah b. ‘Abd al-Aziz, Abu ’l-Mu‘arrij, and Hatim b. Mansur in jurisprudence, and ‘Abdallah b. Yazid al-Fazari in theology (Ennami n.d., 181–82). Ennami provides an extensive list of divergences between the Nukkar and the mainstream Ibadis, including the view that Muslims who hold anthropomorphic views of God are polytheists, that the imamate is not obliga-tory, and that the names of God are created. Th is last heresy prompted a rebuttal in the fi rst theological treatise to emerge from mainstream Ibadism: Kitab al-tawhid al-kabir, written by an Egyptian scholar, ‘Isa b. ‘Alqama (100–150/718–767) (ibid., 35). Th e Nukkar became particularly important in the Maghrib aft er the fall of the Rustamid Imamate to the Fatimids in 296/908–909; in the fi rst half of the fourth/tenth century, one Nakkari uprising nearly defeated the Fati-mids (Lewicki 1953b). Mainstream Ibadism came to be called by the adjective “Wahbi,” following the putative original teachings of the sect of ‘Abdallah b. Wahb al-Rasibi. Some have suggested that “Wahbi” is derived from the name of the Rustamid Imam ‘Abd al-Wahhab, as the term seems not to have come into use until aft er the Nakkarite secession. Muhammad b. Yusuf Atfayyish (1820–1914) argued that if “Wahbi” was derived from ‘Abd al-Wahhab, the form would be Wahhabi, not Wahbi (Atfayyish 1924–1925, 10: 325, cited in Ennami n.d., 174).Aside from ‘Abdallah b. Yazid al-Fazari’s Kitab al-rudud, early Ibadi writ-ing consisted of letters (called siras). Ibadism remained a mainly oral tradition with the exception of letters written by the authorities in Basra to inquirers in the Maghrib. One of the earliest works dealing with religious teaching is a letter on zakat written by Abu ‘Ubayda to a scholar in the Maghrib. Although Ibadis"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"20 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamclaim, as the words of Salim al-Harithi at the beginning of this introduction indi-cate, that Ibadism is the oldest sect of Islam, Wilkinson places its development as a full-fl edged madhhab (denomination, or school of theology and jurisprudence) in the period of its political decline, following the demise of the Rustamid Imam-ate in North Africa and the end of the second imamate in Oman. His study of early Ibadi Hadith points to a lack of isnads21 even as late as the early fourth/tenth century, and that the authoritative collection attributed to al-Rabi‘ b. Habib (d. 170/786), an Ibadi leader of Basra who later relocated to Oman, is a compilation of the work of a number of scholars, with isnads added to fi t the criteria of later Hadith scholarship, probably fi rst set down by a Maghribi scholar of the early third/ninth century, Abu Sufra ‘Abd al-Malik b. Sufra, in a document known as Kitab Abi Sufra. He suggests that this collection did not reach Oman until the beginning of the nineteenth century (Wilkinson 1985, 255, 258).Ibadi literature fi rst developed under the Rustamid Imamate of Tahart, including two works written by Rustamid imams: Ibadi sources mention a tafsir (commentary on the Qur’an) written by ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Rustam (ruled 161–171/778–788) and theological treatises by Abu ’l-Yaqzan Muhammad b. Afl ah (ruled 260–281/874–894) on the question of human capacity to act (istita‘a) and the creation of the Qur’an. A second Ibadi tafsir was composed in the Maghrib by Hud b. Muhakkam al-Huwwari of the third/ninth century, whose father was a judge for Imam ‘Abd al-Wahhab b. ‘Abd al-Rahman b. Rustam (ruled 171–208/788–824). Two decades later came the fi rst Ibadi tafsir written in Oman, by Abu ’l-Hawari Muhammad b. al-Hawari. During the late Rustamid period, one of the fi rst major works of Ibadi theology was written, Usul al-daynuna ’ l-safi ya by ‘Amrus b. Fath al-Masakini of Nafusa, known as Abu Hafs (d. 283/896). He also wrote a refutation of the doctrines of the Nukkar and the Husayniyya, enti-tled Al-Radd ‘ala ’ l-Nakitha wa-Ahmad b. al-Husayn.In the third/ninth century Ibadi scholars began to write collections of jur-isprudential opinions. Especially noteworthy is the work of the Omani scholar, 21. By the mid–eighth century CE, Sunni Hadith scholars required that each report have an isnad, a chain of transmitters, that would list, preferably in an unbroken fashion, all those who had transmitted the report, beginning with the most recent transmitter and proceeding backwards to the Companion who witnessed the Prophet say or do what is recorded in the report."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Introduction • 21Abu Jabir Muhammad b.

In North Africa, ‘azzaba councils developed to replace the imamate; and just as the decline of the power of the ‘Abbasid caliphate led to the emergence of Sunni writings on political theory, so during this period of decline did Ibadi scholars delineate the various types of imamate and the circumstances under which an imam could be deposed (to be discussed below). As Wilkinson points out, the threat of the sect’s extinction led to the development of literature outlining Ibadi doctrine. In Oman, a treatise on the rules for fi ghting jihad was composed in the late third/ninth century by Bashir b. Abi ‘Abdallah Muhammad b. Abi Sufyan Mahbub b. Rahil.Th e fourth/tenth century saw a rapid development in Ibadi jurisprudence. One of the most notable contributors to this literature is a scholar who remains one of the most important legal authorities, especially in Oman: Abu Sa‘id Muhammad b. Sa‘id b. Muhammad b.

His compatriot and younger contemporary, Abu Muhammad ‘Abdallah b. Muhammad b.

Zakariyya came to Oman from the island of Jirba in Tunisia. He was delighted to see the revival of righ-teous Ibadi rule in Oman, but observed few assemblies of learning. So he wrote to the imam advising that he encourage his people to study and build schools. In Jirba, he wrote, although the people are few, weak, and poor, there are more than twenty schools of learning, in which everyone teaches what he knows—grammar, philology, religious obligations, morphology, interpretation, rhetoric, logic, the-ology, fi qh, mathematics, and poetic meter. Furthermore, the leading scholar of Jirba, Abu Zayd b. Ahmad b. Abi Sitta, gives lessons twice a week. “Despite this,” wrote Shaykh ‘Umar, “they regret their lack of knowledge, for the true hanifi ,24 Rustamid sect increases with an increase in knowledge, and decreases with its decrease.” Th erefore, he counseled the imam to place a teacher in each fortress to teach the people about the faith, instruct them to be ascetic with regard to this lower, ephemeral world, and instill in them a desire for the precious, eternal life of the hereaft er. He warned the imam sternly not to neglect this important matter, “because by God’s grace you are his viceregent (khalifa) in this world.” Th e imam heeded this advice. He gathered teachers into his new fortress, called 23. Th is is the date given in A. al-Salimi 2000b, 2:4, but Wilkinson and some other authors place the beginning of his imamate in 1624.24. Hanif is a Qur’anic word of uncertain meaning, but in context it means “the original, pure monotheistic faith.” Th e Qur’an tells Muslims to follow the faith of Abraham as a hanif (10 :105). Th e Qur’an also says that Abraham, the model for Islam, was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but was a hanif (3:67).

Nor was scholarship limited to the highlands of the interior: in Qalhat, a town in the Hor-muz region of the Persian Gulf, another scholar of the eleventh/seventeenth cen-tury, Abu ‘Abdallah Muhammad b.

Salih al-Afdali (d. 1202/1787) and his student, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz b. Ibrahim al-Th amini al-Mus‘abi (1130–1223/1718–1808), who was nicknamed Diya’ al-din, “the Brightness of the Religion.” Al-Th amini wrote, among other works, the monumental Kitab al-Nil wa-shifa’ al-‘alil on jurisprudence, which Wilkinson calls “the Mozabite ‘bible’ of the renaissance” (Wilkinson 1985, 232), as well as Ma‘alim al-din on theology (a section of which is translated in the current volume), Al-Taj, a ten-volume abridgement of Khamis b. Sa‘id’s Manhaj al-talibin, and a 536-page commentary on the theological poem of Abu Nasr Fath b. Nuh al-Malusha’i. One of al-Th amini’s most important stu-dents was Ibrahim b.

Ahmad, second ruler of the Bu Sa‘idi dynasty, who came to power in 1196/1782, wrote to Abu Nabhan asking him to lead a rebellion against the sultan, Abu Nabhan is said to have used his secret arts (‘ilm al-sirr) to destroy the sultan’s power, and his brother, Sultan b. Ahmad, took over almost the entire kingdom (ibid., 202–3). Abu Nab-han’s son, Nasir b. Abi Nabhan (1192–1263/1778–1847), became the major scholar of the next generation in Oman, and accompanied Sayyid Sa‘id b. Sultan to Zan-zibar when the capital of the Omani empire was moved to East Africa. It was one of Nasir b. Abi Nabhan’s pupils, Jumayyil b. Khalfan al-Sa‘di, who composed the ninety-volume Qamus al-shari‘a ’l-hawi turuqaha ’l-wasi‘a from 1260/1844 until 1280/1863, the fi rst volume of which was the fi rst publication produced by Sayyid Barghash’s printing press in Zanzibar in 1297/1880.25 Another of Nasir b. Abi Nab-han’s pupils, however, became the greatest scholar of his generation: Sa‘id b. Khal-fan al-Khalili (1226–87/1811–71). Despite his wide erudition, he was an extremely humble man who declined to be seen as an authority in theology or law. He was a mystic, poet, and master of the rules of rhetoric and grammar, who is seen by liter-ary scholars of contemporary Oman as having inaugurated a literary renaissance in that country. But the motive for his poetry was neither literary nor personal; it was deeply spiritual. Th rough poetry he described the mystical teachings of Islam, his despair over the violence and injustice that reigned in his country, and the need for a righteous imamate to be established in Oman. As we have seen, he became the leading scholar behind the movement that successfully overthrew Salim b. Th u-wayni in 1868 and installed ‘Azzan b. Qays Al Bu Sa‘idi as imam, and he was killed following the overthrow of the imamate in early 1871.Despite becoming blind from an illness at the age of twelve, Nur al-Din al-Salimi (1286–1332/1869–1914) was active in the fi elds of history and poetry as well as Qur’an commentary and Shari‘a, in addition to leading the imamate rebellion of 1913.

Yusuf Atfayy-ish (1235–1332/1820–1914), overlapped the careers of Nasir b. Abi Nabhan, Sa‘id b. Khalfan al-Khalili, and Nur al-Din al-Salimi. Atfayyish was honored by the sultans of Zanzibar, and his works were fi rst published there by the Zanzibar sul-tanate’s printing press (Sadgrove 2004), and later by the Salafi yya Press in Cairo established by the Libyan Ibadi, Sulayman b. ‘Abdallah al-Baruni (1870–1940) (Custers 2004). Atfay yish is so highly respected in the world of Ibadi scholar-ship that he is universally referred to as “the Pole of the Religion” (qutb al-din) or “the Pole of the Imams” (qutb al-a’imma), or simply “the Pole” (al-Qutb). In some respects he was untraditional, ready to reconsider issues that had long been decided in Ibadi tradition. His infl uence on al-Rawahi is evident in the fact that Atfayyish’s Hamayan al-zad ila dar al-ma‘ad appears to have been used as the basis of parts of the theological primer translated in this volume, and the last three chapters of al-Rawahi’s text closely follow portions of Atfayyish’s Al-Dhahab al-khalis al-munawwih bi ’ l-‘ ilm al-qalis.Muhammad Atfayyish’s international contacts and publication venues are one indication of the impact of globalization on the world of Ibadi scholar-ship since the late nineteenth century.

Muhammad Atfay-yish (1305–1385/1886–1965), like his great-uncle a native of the Mzab valley in Algeria, but who studied in Muscat, Algiers, and Tunis.

As we have seen, the radical Khawarij believed that those who committed grave sins had renounced the faith. Th ey were unbelievers (mushrikun, literally “polytheists”) and apostates deserving death. On the other end of the spectrum, from the vantage point of Muslim heresiographies, was the perspective taken by those the heresiographers call the Murji’a (“postponers”), who said that works do not aff ect faith, judgment should be postponed until the Day of Judgment when God would decide, and sinning Muslims must be regarded as believers in this world. Although Sunni Muslims regard this group (the membership of which is unclear) as heretics, probably because their viewpoint could easily lead one to think that works are unimportant, their position is actually quite close to what came to be regarded as the Sunni point of view, and Abu Hanifa (d. 150/767), eponym of the Hanafi legal school of Sunni Islam, was said to be a Murji’i. Th e most common Sunni point of view is that anyone who professes faith in Islam is a Muslim, even if he commits grave sins and neglects his religious obligations. It is for this reason that radical modern Muslims who practice takfi r (accusing other Muslims of kufr, or unbelief ) are not in keeping with traditional Sunnism, and are oft en castigated as Khawarij by moderate Sunnis. From the typical Sunni perspective, what makes someone a Muslim is the acknowledgment of the truth of Islamic teachings and the obligation of Muslim duties, regardless of whether or not one observes these in practice. So someone who acknowledges, for example, that prayer is obligatory, yet fails to pray, is a negligent Muslim, but remains a Muslim deserving all the privileges that status confers in this world. As is stated in the Fiqh Akbar I, a creed derived from statements of Abu Hanifa: “We do not hold anyone to be an infi del (kafi r) on account of sin, and we do not deny their faith. . . . We do not disavow any of the Companions of the Messenger of God, and we do not adhere to one rather than another. We leave the question of ‘Uthman and ‘Ali to God, who knows things secret and hidden” (Wensinck 1932, 103, 104). Th is creed clearly links one’s attitude toward the relationship between faith and works with one’s position on the schisms that rent the Muslim community aft er ‘Uthman’s assassination. In fact, many Sunni hadiths indicate that Muslims who commit grave sins—“even theft and adultery”—will obtain entrance into paradise in the aft erlife (al-Bukhari n.d.,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"28 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamnos. 3222, 5827), and that even some who are at fi rst condemned to hellfi re will enter paradise by virtue of the Prophet’s intercession (ibid., nos. 7509, 7510; Abu Dawud 2000, no. 4115). Th e Mu‘tazila, on the other hand, a theological school that emerged in the early second/eighth century and reached the apex of its infl uence in the early third/ninth century, said that an unrepentant sinning Muslim is nei-ther a believer (mu’min) nor an unbeliever (kafi r), but occupies a status between the two (manzila bayn al-manzilatayn).Th e Ibadi position on this question diff ers from all of the above. Th ey utterly reject the Sunni position that faith is unaff ected by works, and do not believe, as the Mu‘tazila did, that there is an intermediary status between faith (iman) and infi delity (kufr), though neither do they castigate grave sinners as unbeliev-ers or “polytheists” (mushrikun) deserving death, as did the radical Khawarij. Rather, they distinguish between diff erent levels of kufr. Unbelief, or polytheism, is kufr shirk, the infi delity of polytheism, but a sinning Muslim is not to be called such. Rather, a sinning Muslim is guilty of kufr nifaq, the infi delity of hypocrisy, or kufr ni‘ma, ingratitude for or denial of God’s blessing. Th e root meaning of kufr, which is oft en translated as unbelief or denial, is ingratitude; believers are described in the Qur’an as characterized by shukr (gratitude), while those who reject the message of the prophets are characterized by kufr (ingratitude, e.g., 14:7). For this reason, in my translation of these terms, I render kufr as “infi -delity” and reserve “unbelief ” of any sort for translations of shirk, for though shirk literally means “associating” other beings with God as objects of worship, in Ibadi parlance the term is used for any type of wrong belief, not only polytheism.From the Ibadi perspective, the only people worthy of being called “Mus-lims” are righteous Ibadis. Th e terms “Muslims” and “people of straightness” (ahl al-istiqama) are references to Ibadis, and “our companions” (ashabuna) means Ibadi scholars. Non-Ibadi Muslims are referred to as ahl al-khilaf, “the people of opposition,” who are nonetheless included among the “monotheists” (ahl al-tawhid or muwahhidun), the “people of the qibla” who face the Ka‘ba in prayer, and the umma, the religious community of Muhammad.Religious Affi liation or Association (Wa laya) and Dissociation (Bara’a)Although all Muslims are familiar with these concepts, which are derived from the Qur’an, Ibadis are distinct in their insistence on their priority. One of the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Introduction • 29most helpful aspects of al-Rawahi’s primer is its very clear presentation of this complicated and sometimes rather murky issue. Religious association or “friend-ship” (walaya) is reserved for “Muslims,” who are righteous Ibadis living in obedi-ence to God. Sinning Ibadis and non-Ibadi Muslims are kuff ar and are therefore subject to “dissociation” (bara’a). Although this term has sometimes implied communal ostracism radical enough to be translated as excommunication26—although no Ibadi institution carries a Vatican-like authority so as to issue an offi cial declaration of such—from al-Rawahi’s perspective bara’a need not mean a severance of all contact or cordiality with such people; he appears to interpret bara’a as a n inner awareness of separation t hat does not imply socia l avoida nce or discourtesy, and need not even preclude genuine aff ection. “Dissociation,” there-fore, may be more cognitive than actual. Th is interpretation may be a product of the cosmopolitan environment in which al-Rawahi lived, compared to the rela-tive isolation of Ibadi communities in the regions of al-Jabal al-Akhdar in Oman, the Mzab valley in Algeria, and Jabal Nafusa in Libya, where these concepts were hammered out by scholars in the premodern period.On this topic, in modern Ibadism, there is a defi nite inconsistency between Ibadi theory and actual practice. One would expect that those who believe that faith can be found only within a small group, and that one must dissoci-ate from all others, would be extremely intolerant of those outside their group, but one British observer of Ibadis in Oman and Zanzibar came to the conclu-sion that Ibadis are the most tolerant of people, living in harmony with all reli-gious and ethnic groups (Ingrams 1931, 191). Ibadis teach that all “monotheists” (non-Ibadi Muslims) are to be treated as “Muslims” under the law, people with whom there can be intermarriage, mutual inheritance of one from the other, and other privileges, all of which are discussed at length in chapter 5 of al-Rawahi’s primer. But though one is tempted to think that al-Rawahi’s social milieu impacted his views on dissociation, the same cannot be said regarding his discussion of relations with non-Muslims: although Zanzibar was ruled by 26. For example, Wilkinson (1987, 11) writes that scholars of the Rustaq school “excommuni-cated” the more moderate members of the Nizwa school, and Savage (1997, 20–21) says bara’a means “foreswearing all contact.” Savage wrongly interprets wala’ (a variant of walaya) as being associated with the unity of God (tawhid). Th is is incorrect, because non-Ibadi Muslims are recognized as monotheists, but are nonetheless subject to dissociation."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"30 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamthe British Colonial Offi ce, al-Rawahi uses the traditional discourse of Muslim rule and non-Muslim subjugation.Unlike the Khawarij, Ibadis do not endorse the execution of ordinary sin-ners (as opposed to perpetrators of crimes like murder or adulter y) or of Muslims who neglect their religious obligations, although they (like many Sunni Muslims) believe it is the duty of a righteous Muslim ruler to call such a person to repen-tance and to punish him in order to induce such repentance. Violence is reserved for tyrannical rulers and those who actively oppose Islam and the Muslims.Reward and Punishment in the Aft erlifeAlthough one must treat non-Ibadi Muslims with the courtesy that all monothe-ists deserve, according to classic Ibadi doctrine, neither they nor sinning Ibadis will be allowed into paradise; they are doomed to hellfi re. Ibadis also deny that the Prophet will intercede for grave sinners. Although the Qur’an implies that punishment in hellfi re is eternal (2:217 and elsewhere) and that there is a barrier between paradise and hellfi re that makes it impossible for one to pass from one to the other (7:46), these passages are far from straightforward, and are subject to various interpretations. Sunni Muslims believe that there are diff erent levels of punishment in hellfi re, and that those in the upper levels are sinning Muslims who may enter paradise aft er paying the penalty for their sins. Furthermore, as we have seen, there are hadiths that say that sinning Muslims will enter paradise by virtue of their profession of faith, and that the Prophet Muhammad will res-cue people out of hellfi re and bring them into paradise. All of this is denied by the Ibadis, who traditionally insisted that punishment in hellfi re is categorical and eternal, and paradise is reserved for righteous believers in their own creed.Free Will versus PredestinationIn Islamic theology, the question of free will versus predestination27 is called al-qada’ wa-’l-qadar, “the (divine) decree and determination,” and it focuses not on the question of will or choice, but of power: do humans have the capacity or power to 27. My discussion of this topic is greatly indebted to Watt 1948."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Introduction • 31do what they are commanded to do as well as its opposite? Th e Qur’an speaks of qadar, the measure or determination of things, usually in a verbal form, qaddara, to refer to God’s determination of the phases of the moon (10:5), the sustenance of mountains (41:10) and of people (89:16), death (74:19, 56:60), and the prior deter-mination that the wife of Lot would not be saved (15:60). Q 65:3 says, “He gave everything its measure (qadr).” Th e word qada’, “decree,” occurs only in the verbal form of qada in the Qur’an, for example, “It is He who created you from clay, then decreed a term (of life) for you” (6:2). It is most oft en used in connection with God’s decree that something exist. Four times the Qur’an says, “If He decrees something, He merely says ‘Be!’ and it is” (2:117, 3:47, 19:35, 40:68). It is also used in the sense of command, without any implication that God causes obedience: “Your Lord decreed that you not worship anything but Him, and that you be kind to parents” (17:23).Th ere are also numerous references to God guiding people and leading them astray, for example, “If God wishes to guide someone, He enlarges his breast to accept Islam; but if He wishes to lead him astray, He makes his breast narrow and constricted, as if he were evaporating into the sky; thus does God lay abomination on those who do not believe” (6:125). Some Qur’an passages indicate that God’s guidance and leading astray follow upon human acts of belief and righteousness or unbelief and wickedness; that God’s guidance is only eff ective when people are willing to receive it, whereas being led astray by God is a sort of punishment for unbelief: “He has guided some of you, and some have justly incurred the penalty of going astray” (7:30). Although there are Qur’anic passages that indicate that whoever wishes may believe and whoever wishes may disbelieve (18:28–30), there are others that indicate that human will is nonetheless subject to God ’s: “You will not will unless God wills” (76:29–30); “It is not for anyone to believe except by God’s permission” (10:99–100).Much more explicitly deterministic is a large body of Hadith, of which the following is a very small sample: the fi rst thing God created was the Pen, which He commanded to write the destinies of all things until the Day of Judgment (Abu Dawud 2000, no. 4702); an angel visits each unborn child aft er 120 days in the womb and writes its sex, sustenance, term of life (i.e., time of death), its deeds, and whether it will be happy or miserable in the aft erlife (Muslim 2000, bab 98, no. 1; Muslim 1977, nos. 6390, 6392, 6393).Th is obviously raises a host of moral problems. First at stake is the question of God’s justice: if a person’s fate is sealed before birth, that person is not responsible"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"32 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamfor his or her actions, and God is unjust for punishing people for what they were predestined to do. God must be unjust if He commands people to do one thing and determines that they do the opposite. On the question of sustenance, it was asked whether God predetermined the sustenance of those who gain it by immoral means, such as theft . If so, then God participates in an immoral act. Similarly, on the question of one’s life term, it was asked whether God wills for people to com-mit murder. If so, God is again implicated in an evil act.Th e opposite claim, that people act and choose by their own power, was seen by many as limiting the power and dominion of God. If God does not provide the sustenance of a thief, the thief steals provision God had intended for someone else, which implies that His power over human sustenance is limited. If God does not will murder, then its victims die before God’s appointed time, and His power over life and death is limited.By the second/eighth century the idea that God predetermines all things, including human acts, had gained popularity, as refl ected in the growing body of Hadith with this point of view. Th e opposite point of view, that people have been given power and responsibility over their own actions, was taken by an early group known as the Qadariyya, who were most concerned with avoiding “fi xing evil upon God.” If what is recorded of their teachings in Sunni heresiographies is accurate, the Qadariyya resorted to religiously unacceptable doctrines in order to avoid “fi xing evil upon God”: for example, they denied that God provides sus-tenance to someone who steals for a living or that He creates a child who is born of adultery, and they said that a murderer precludes his victim from reaching the life term set by God. Such statements appear to contradict the Qur’an’s affi r-mation that God provides sustenance to all creatures and sets the life term for everyone. Another problematic issue was God’s knowledge of the future, which many believed causes and determines events. Although most Qadaris denied a linkage between God’s knowledge of the future and the determination of human acts, one Qadari subgroup called the Shabibiyya was allegedly driven to deny that God knows what people will do until they do it (Watt 1973, 94). Th is clearly goes against the reiterated Qur’anic affi rmation of God’s omniscience.Th e free-will position was then taken up by the Mu‘tazila, the fi rst systematic theologians of Islam. Th e Mu‘tazila’s self-designation was “the people of unity and justice.” “Unity” refers to their doctrine that God is internally one (“simple,” in the language of the philosophers), requiring a negation of the reality of His"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Introduction • 33attributes—a doctrine the Ibadis also embrace. Th e second part of this appel-lation indicates their belief that God’s justice requires that humans must have power over their own acts. All power belongs to God, they argued, but He has delegated power to human beings in such a way that they have power in them-selves at all times either to do something or not to do it or to do its opposite. On the tricky questions of God’s knowledge, provision of sustenance, and setting of life terms, they suggested solutions that took into account both God’s power and His justice: God does know what people will do before they do it, but that knowl-edge is merely descriptive and does not determine what they will do; God pro-vides sustenance to all creatures, and a thief steals the sustenance God provided to someone else; God does not will murder, but the life term He sets is fi xed, so when a person is murdered, he dies at the time already determined by God, and would have died some other way if he had not been murdered. But some aspects of Mu‘tazili teaching involved them in intricate dilemmas, especially their notion that God’s absolute justice means that He must do what is best for His creatures. If God is all-powerful and He must do what is best, how do we explain suff ering that is not the result of human sin? Some of their suggested solutions to prob-lems of this type are imaginative, but not necessarily satisfying. For example, it is obviously unjust for innocent children to suff er and die, yet they do. Some Mu‘tazili thinkers suggested that this happens as a warning to adults, and that the children are compensated in paradise. But since paradise is meant as a reward for good deeds, is it really just to give such a reward to children who do not reach the age of accountability before they die? And although the suff ering of unbeliev-ers and evil-doers in hellfi re does meet the strict standards of justice, how can one argue that this is actually the best for them? Some Mu‘tazila suggested that while suff ering in hellfi re, they were at least prevented from unbelief. But none of these solutions really satisfi es.Th e two sides on this issue in the third/ninth century were the Mu‘tazili theologians, who argued for free will, and the “people of Hadith,” represented by such people as Ahmad b. Hanbal (d. 241/855), founder of the Hanbali school of law in Sunni Islam, who upheld predestination and disapproved of theologi-cal reasoning altogether. Hadiths even warned that entire peoples had perished by discussing God’s decree and determination (al-Tirmidhi 2000, kitab 28, bab 1). It was only in the early fourth/tenth century that Sunni thinkers adapted the methods of the Mu‘tazila to explain and defend the teachings of the people of"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"34 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ IslamHadith, which by then had come to be identifi ed as Sunni Islam. Th e most infl u-ential of these early Sunni theologians was Abu ’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari (d. 324/935), originally a Mu‘tazili, who is said to have left the Mu‘tazila in 300/912 when his teacher, al-Jubba’i, one of the most eminent Mu‘tazili scholars of the time, could not explain how it could be just for some children to die and go to paradise, while others live to adulthood and suff er damnation. Al-Ash‘ari said that God, as creator of the law, is above the law and cannot be judged by human concepts of justice. He argued that all human acts are created by God, and humans merely “acquire” these acts. Th e power God gives for an act is for that act only, not for an act “or its opposite,” as the Mu‘tazila had said. Human beings have no latent power; the power God gives for an act immediately produces the intended act once it is acquired. Th e distinction between an act that we perceive as voluntary and one that we perceive as involuntary, like shivering, lies in the fact that God gives humans the power to choose between an act or its opposite (which can mean either not doing the act or, in the case of faith, choosing unbelief). Human choice does not grant a person the power to act, but God is in the habit of creat-ing acts t hat accord w it h human choice. In t his way, a l-Ash ‘ari upheld bot h God ’s absolute power over human acts and people’s responsibility for what they do.Th e Saljuq Turks who conquered Baghdad in the mid–eleventh century actively embraced the Ash‘arite school, and a number of theological colleges were established to teach Ash‘arite theology as a bulwark against Isma‘ili Shi‘ite propaganda. Although there have always been Sunni Muslims who distrust the-ology altogether, especially in the Hanbali school, there is a rough correspon-dence between the geographical areas where the Shafi ‘i and Maliki schools of law predominate and the teaching of Ash‘arite theology. Th e Hanafi school of law, which predominates in central and south Asia, tends to be associated with another Sunni theological school, that of al-Maturidi (d. 333/944).Ibadis embraced the Ash‘arite solution to the question of free will versus predestination. Some Ibadi exposés deal with this question at length—al-Sa‘di (1983, 5:5–227), for example, devotes more than 200 pages to this topic—and Nasir b. Abi Nabhan (1848, 20) considered this doctrine to be of such importance that he said that the Mu‘tazila had deviated more seriously from the straight path than the Sunnis, despite large areas of theological agreement between the Ibadis and the Mu‘tazila, because, from his point of view, by claiming to have power over something over which they say God has no power, they deny that God is"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Introduction • 35all-knowing and all-powerful, in defi ance of the express words of the Qur’an. Nonetheless, Nasir al-Rawahi, author of the primer translated in this book, barely touches on this topic. Th e reason for this might have to do with the fact that he was writing in a largely Sunni/Shafi ‘i/Ash‘ari environment, and this is the one area in which the Ibadis do not disagree with the Sunnis—or it may be that al-Rawahi died before he could address this issue in a separate chapter. Th erefore, in order to provide a fairly complete presentation of Ibadi theology, I also trans-late the relevant portions of ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Th amini’s Ma‘alim al-din.Anthropomorphic Descriptions of GodTh e Qur’an sometimes describes God in anthropomorphic terms: he is described as has having hands (38:75, 39:67), eyes (54:14), a face (28:88), and being seated on a throne borne by angels above the heavens (20:5, 40:7). He is also described as “the Light of the heavens and the earth” (24:35). Nonetheless, the Qur’an also describes God as diff erent from all other things (42:11), too exalted to be com-pared with created beings. Q 75:22–23 says that on the Day of Resurrection and Judgment, “faces will be radiant, looking at their Lord.” Th is would appear to imply that God is in a particular place and can be seen. On the other hand, 6:103 says, “Vision does not comprehend him, but He comprehends all vision,” which implies that God cannot be seen, and 2:115, “wherever you turn, there is the face of God,” implies that God is not in a particular place, but is beyond all places and yet in them at the same time. Th ese contradictory passages posed problems for Muslim theologians.Hadith refl ects a simple folk piety with little or no accommodation to the demands of human reason. Compiled in the eighth and ninth centuries, it pres-ents a “picturesque” depiction of God, as Macdonald put it, with details on His relationship to the angels and demons (Wensinck 1932, 63). It also says that the greatest gift that God will give the believers in paradise is the vision of Himself, a vision so complete that they will see nothing but Him (Muslim 2000, bab 80, no. 297; Muslim 1977, no. 347; Bukhari n.d., no. 4851; Wensinck 1932, 63).Muslims agree that tashbih, “likening” God to human beings, is sinful, and that all Muslims must practice tanzih, the “exaltation” of God above all other things. Some early Muslims who were accused of anthropomorphism said that by saying God is a body they meant only that He exists, for nothing exists except bodies."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"36 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ IslamBut bodies imply fi nitude (having fi nite dimensions) and perceptibility (the abil-ity to be seen). Can God be seen? Since He is the creator of places, can He be in a place? Th e Mu‘tazila denied that God has a body or can be seen, and interpreted anthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Qur’an as metaphors. For example, they interpreted His sitting on a throne as a metaphor for His dominion over all creation; His hand means His power; and gazing (nazira) at God means expecting (muntazira, from the same root as nazira) His reward. But many pious Muslims refrained from such discussions by saying the Qur’anic descriptions of God must be believed “without saying how” (bi-la kayf), that is, without explanation or ratio-nalization, and this became the offi cial Sunni position.28 Th e Ibadis agree with the Mu‘tazila that the anthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Qur’an must be interpreted as metaphors, that God is not perceptible and does not occupy space. Th ey also agree with them in seeing as mere metaphors such eschatological sym-bols as the scale in which deeds will be weighed on the Day of Judgment, because deeds are accidents, not bodies, and cannot literally be weighed.Reason and RevelationTh e Mu‘tazila argued that the truths of Islam can be discerned by the intellect without the need for prophetic revelation. Prophets are really a grace from God, sent to remind people of what they already know, or to force upon them the evidence of the truth they could perceive with their senses and their intellect. Prophets are needed only to reveal specifi c laws. It is entirely impermissible to adopt religious belief through taqlid, blindly following the opinions of others. Rather, reason must be employed. Th e revelation of the prophets is entirely com-patible with reason; if a verse’s literal interpretation is incompatible with reason, it must be subjected to an alternative interpretation, such as interpreting God’s 28. Frank (1992, 25) argues that the denial of kayfi yya in God is not a renunciation of reason but an affi rmation of God’s transcendence and lack of comparability to created things. For an excel-lent summary of early Muslim interpretations of the possibility of seeing God in the aft erlife, see the tenth-century exegete al-Tabari’s discussion of 6:104 in Gätje (1971, 156–62). Th is is directly followed by Zamakhshari’s Mu‘tazili interpretation of 75:22–23. Tabari, a Sunni, favors the position that although God cannot be seen in this life, believers (but not unbelievers) will be somehow made to see Him in the aft erlife."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Introduction • 37throne as only a symbol of His dominance, or interpreting the scale in which deeds are weighed as mere metaphor. Sunni theologians, while also promoting the use of reason, nonetheless feel that one must accept the literal meaning of the Qur’an and Hadith without rationalization. On this issue, the Ibadis agree with the Mu‘tazila. Th ey believe that human knowledge of God is innate from child-hood, whereas Sunni Muslims believe knowledge of God comes through educa-tion and occurs at the age of legal accountability.Th e Unity of God, His Essence, and AttributesEarly Muslim theological discussions revolved around the question of whether or not God’s attributes are real things distinct from His essence. For every one of the ninety-nine beautiful names of God given in the Qur’an, such as “the all-Mer-ciful,” “the Living,” “the all-Powerful,” “the all-Knowing,” “the Creator,” there exists a corresponding attribute, which for the above-mentioned names would be mercy, life, power, knowledge, and creation. As Wolfson (1976, 112) says, “As early as the fi rst part of the eighth century, . . . there arose in Islam the belief that certain terms which are attributed to God in the Koran stand for real incorporeal beings which exist in God from eternity.” Like the Mu‘tazila, Ibadis believe that the unity of God is compromised if one posits the existence of the attributes as real things distinct from God’s essence; God’s unity implies that He cannot be composed of parts (essence and attributes), but must, in Aristotelian terms, be “simple,” not composite.29 Th ey said that God’s attributes have no real existence, but are merely descriptions of His essence. Th ose who affi rmed the ontological reality of God’s attributes as distinct from His essence (whom Wolfson calls the “Attributists”) pointed out that if God’s power is the same as His essence, and His knowledge is the same as His essence, then His power must be the same 29. Th e Aristotelian argument is that the combination of matter and form in the phenomenal world requires four causes, and that these causes are themselves caused by other things, but at the origin of the entire series of causes must be an uncaused cause, a First Cause, who is not composed of parts, because any such composition would require another being to cause them to come together. An infi nitely regressing series of causes is rationally intolerable, so the First Cause must be abso-lutely “simple” and internally one. With the translation of Greek philosophical and scientifi c works into Arabic in the 830s, theological discussion was directly impacted by Aristotelian logic."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"38 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamas His knowledge, which is logically absurd. Th ey also said that by denying the existence of God’s attributes, the Mu‘tazila were guilty of ta‘til, “stripping” God of all meaning. Th e Mu‘tazila, favored briefl y by the ruling ‘Abbasids in the ninth century, became discredited, and the Attributist position was adopted by Sunni Islam; Mu‘tazili theology continues to be upheld by the Zaydi Shi‘a. Th e Ibadi position on God’s attributes is similar to that of the Mu‘tazila, although they use formulas that avoid some of the quandaries caused by Mu‘tazili semantics.Th e Creation of the Qur’anTh e question of whether the Qur’an is created or eternal was the topic of heated discussions in the ninth century. It is connected with the controversy over God’s attributes as well as the belief in the existence of the Qur’an before its revela-tion, even before the creation of the world: the Qur’an speaks of the Qur’an being on a tablet preserved in heaven (85:22).30 Sunni Muslims believe the Qur’an is uncreated or eternal, because it is associated with God’s attributes of word, speech, and knowledge, which are eternal. Th e Mu‘tazila, on the other hand, denied the reality of God’s eternal attributes, and said that belief in the eternity of the Qur’an was tantamount to polytheism. Th ey were supported in this view by the ‘Abbasid caliph al-Ma’mun (ruled 218–227/813–833), who in the Mihna (“Inquisition”) persecuted religious scholars like Ahmad b. Hanbal who insisted that the Qur’an was uncreated. Ahmad b. Hanbal held that the Qur’an is knowl-edge from God, and since God’s knowledge is uncreated, the Qur’an must be 30. Th is is the typical interpretation of this verse. Hadith also says that the fi rst thing God cre-ated was the Pen, which He commanded to write on the Preserved Tablet all that would happen until the Day of Resurrection. Muhammad Ali translates lawh mahfuz as “guarded tablet” rather than a heavenly “preserved tablet,” and comments: “Th e lauh, or tablet, occurring here, is the same as the alwah (sing u la r, lauh), or tablets, occurring regarding the book given to Moses (7:145, 150, 154). Th e Qur’an is here spoken of as being in a guarded tablet. Th e signifi cance of these words is simply this, that the Holy Qur’an is guarded against corruption and against the attacks of its opponents; compare 15:9: ‘Surely We revealed the Reminder and surely We shall guard it.’ Th ere is no mention here or anywhere else in the Qur’an of the lauh mahfuz on which the decrees of God are written . . .” (M. Ali 1991, 1162–63, n. 2706)."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Introduction • 39uncreated. Furthermore, if the Qur’an is merely a created thing, then it is no dif-ferent from any other speech, because God is the creator of all things, including human speech; in that case, it does not necessarily express who God is, and one could not be certain of receiving any communication that really came from God. For Ibn Hanbal and other “people of Hadith,” God creates both good and evil, including the evil acts of human beings, so God’s creation might exhibit qualities like weakness or ignorance that do not express God Himself. But the Mu‘tazila believed that God creates only good, so they did not have the same dilemma on this issue. Despite—or perhaps because of—the Mihna, the doctrine of the eter-nity of the Qur’an came to be embraced by the majority of Muslims.Th e revelation of the Qur’an in history and its preservation in writing and memory raise other questions concerning the eternity and temporality of the Qur’an, questions which in some sense are analogous to those raised by the incarnation of Christ: just as, in Christian belief, the eternal Christ (the Logos, or Word) became fl esh and revealed God in history, so in Islamic belief did the eternal Qur’an (the Word of God) become “embooked” in Muhammad’s revela-tion—what Wolfson (1976, 235–44) calls “inlibration.” Just as the question was raised whether Christ had two natures (divine and human), so was the ques-tion raised whether the Qur’an had two natures (eternal and created). One early Attributist theologian, ‘Abdallah b. Sa‘id b. Kullab (d. ca. 241/855), held that the written or spoken Qur’an is only an expression or imitation of the Word of God; the real Word of God is an idea subsistent in God. Ibn Kullab denied that God’s eternal speech can be characterized by commands, prohibitions, and announce-ments—which is what the Qur’an contains—so he denied that the Qur’an is eternal; it is a temporally produced or originated (hadith) expression of God’s eternal speech. Th e creed entitled Wasiyat Abi Hanifa (“Th e Testimony of Abu Hanifa,” though scholars believe it actually represents the views of Ahmad b. Hanbal) held that what people hear and recite is the uncreated Word of God, but it implies that the material component of the Qur’an is created, while the essential Qur’an transcends this. Th e Fiqh Akbar II, possibly composed by al-Ash‘ari, says, “Our utterance, writing and recitation of the Qur’an are created, but the Qur’an itself is not created” (Wensinck 1932, 189). According to the Ash‘arite scholar al-Juwayni (419–478/1028–1085), the divine speech that is eternal is the speech that subsists in His essence (al-qa’im bi-’ l-nafs) (al-Juwayni"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"40 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islam1950, 117).31 Unlike Ibn Kullab, al-Juwayni insisted that God’s eternal speech is characterized as commands, prohibitions, and announcements. “Eternal speech existed in anticipation of the moment for the communication to Moses and, when he came into existence, it was a communication to him in actuality. Th e newly existing thing was, however, Moses, not the speech.” Nonetheless, he describes as foolish the idea that God’s speech consists of letters and sounds. “Th e recitation, according to the orthodox (ahl al-haqq), consists of the sounds of the readers and their intonation, which are acquisitions of theirs. . . . Th e Word of God Most High is written in copies of the Qur’an and preserved in breasts, but it does not inhere (hall) in a copy, nor does it subsist in a heart” (al-Juwayni 1950, 120, 127, 130, 132; al-Juwayni 2000, 67, 71, 72, 73). A creed of the Maturidite school of Sunni Islam says that the Qur’an, as the Word of God, is an eternal attribute subsisting in God’s essence, though not in the Arabic language or in the form of letters and sounds. “Rather, His creatures express that one attribute with varying expressions. . . . Th e Ash‘arites have said that what is in the text is not the Word of God, but is only an expression of the Word of God, which is an attribute, and the attribute is not to be separated from that to which it is attributed. We say, it is the Word of God, but the letters and sounds are created, for we do not say that the Word of God inheres in the text so that there can be any talk of separation” (al-Maturidi 1953, cited in Williams 1994, 147).Ibadis distinguish between God’s essential speech (al-kalam al-nafsi), which is an attribute of God’s eternal essence, and the Qur’an and other revealed scriptures, which are created indicators (madlulat) of His knowledge and consist of letters and words. God’s knowledge of the revealed scriptures as letters, sounds, and words is eternal, as all His knowledge is eternal and unchanging, including His knowledge of all His creatures, but that does not mean that the objects of His knowledge are eternal or unchanging. Nasir b. Abi Nabhan compared God’s essential speech with the unspoken commands issued by the human intellect to the limbs of the body, and said that the divine command “Be!” that brings all things into being (Qur’an 31. Paul Walker (al-Juwayni 2000, 65) translates this as “the speech that arises in the soul,” but one does not speak of God having a soul, and al-kalam al-nafsi is usually translated as God’s “essential speech.” Al-Juwayni’s authority was such that he was nicknamed “Imam al-Haramayn” (leading scholar of the two holy cities)."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Introduction • 4116:40) is of this type, a command without words (al-Sa‘di 1983, 3:239).32 Most Ibadis affi rm that God has an eternal attribute of speech (although none of God’s attributes are real things subsisting in God’s essence, as the Sunnis would say) in order to deny that He is mute, although some Ibadis feel it is unnecessary to affi rm specifi cally the attribute of speech as an eternal characteristic of His essence, as this is subsumed under the affi rmation of omnipotence as an eternal characteristic of God’s essence. Th e affi rmation of an attribute is only necessary to deny its oppo-site, but the opposite of speech is silence, not muteness. Th e affi rmation of God’s eternal omnipotence is enough to guarantee that He is eternally capable of speech; it is not necessary to affi rm that He is eternally speaking.In a book defending the distinctive doctrines of Ibadism, Shaykh Ahmad b. Hamad al-Khalili, the current grand muft i of the Sultanate of Oman, writes, “When we speak of the creation of the Qur’an, we are only speaking of this Qur’an that is recited by tongues and written on pages. We are not speaking of God’s essential speech, because there is no proof from the Book or from the Sunna that the essential speech should be called the Qur’an, although the Ash‘arites have called it such” (A. al-Khalili 2001, 103).JurisprudenceTh e principles of jurisprudence33 are the same in Ibadism as in Sunni and Shi‘i Islam, but unlike the Sunnis, Ibadis do not accept the principle of taqlid (t he obligation to follow the opinions of earlier scholars) and never closed the gate of 32. To those who are unfamiliar with these theological discussions, this may not seem very diff erent from the doctrine of the Ash‘arites, who hold that al-kalam al-nafsi does not mean that letters, sounds, sentences, or words subsist in His essence. However, as we have seen, the Ash‘arites do believe that the commands, prohibitions, and information in the Qur’an are eternal, although the letters and sounds attached to its Arabic expression are temporally produced. Ash‘arites would recoil with horror at calling the Qur’an “created.”33. Th is section on jurisprudence closely follows Ennami (n.d., 117–30). When Ennami wrote his dissertation in 1970, he stated that very little modern scholarship had been done on Ibadi juris-prudence, and that remains the case, with the exception of the work of the Italian scholar, Ersilia Francesca.

Th e Naff athiyya and Husayniyya, two extinct Ibadi sects discussed in the section on Ibadism’s historical development, disagreed with this principle and said that those who followed incorrect opin-ions were kuff ar.

Habib and his cohorts opposed analogical reasoning34 and felt that one must strictly follow the prec-edents directly provided by the Prophet and His Companions, but analogical reasoning was later recognized by all Ibadis and was largely exercised (Ennami n.d., 117–18).Diff erences between Ibadis and other Muslims in jurisprudence include:(1) Ibadis developed an elaborate categorization of diff erent types of imam-ate: the hidden imamate (imamat al-kitman), in a situation of political oppres-sion and weakness; the activist imamate (imamat al-shira’) that is possible when at least forty men pledge to die in order to establish a righteous imamate; the imamate of defense (imamat al-difa‘), an emergency appointment of someone as an imam in order to repel an invading enemy; the declared imamate (imamat al-zuhur), which is established aft er enemies have been defeated and there is sta-bility (Al-Rawas 2000, 95–103).(2) Ibadis regarded the stage of kitman as mirroring the corresponding stage of the Prophet’s life and the Muslim community in Mecca. Th erefore, they suspend 34. Analogical reasoning involves making an analogy between a new situation and one for which there is an explicit verdict provided in the Qur’an or Hadith. Th e analogy is based on a com-mon factor between the two situations. For example, medieval legal scholars decided that it is lawful to use herbs to prevent conception, although there is nothing on the use of herbs for this purpose in either the Qur’an or Hadith, because there is a hadith in which the Prophet explicitly permits coitus interruptus to prevent conception. As the motive of coitus interruptus is to prevent conception, by analogy all methods of birth control are permissible. On the topic of birth control in medieval juris-prudence, see Musallam (1983).

Th ere have always been some Ibadis who have dis-agreed with this teaching, including Nur al-Din al-Salimi, who wrote (A. al-Salimi 1996) in defense of congregational prayer, even in the absence of a just imam.(4) Th e duties of association (walaya) and dissociation (bara’a) are suspended during the period of kitman (Ennami n.d., 120).(5) Unlike Sunnis, Ibadis do not consider it permissible to wipe the shoes or slippers instead of washing the feet for ablutions before prayer (ibid., 121–22).(6) Ibadis hold that during the noon and aft ernoon prayers, no portion of the Qur’an is recited but the Fatiha. Th e rationale for this is that in all the silent parts of other prayers, such as the third rak‘a (cycle of “bowing”) of the sunset prayer and the second two rak‘as of the evening prayers, only the Fatiha is recited, and likewise only the Fatiha is recited in every prayer or part of a prayer that is silent, whether by night or by day, whereas other portions of the Qur’an are recited in the congregational prayers for Friday or for the feast days, during which the recital is aloud. As both the aft ernoon and noon prayers are silent, they should be subject to the same rule, namely that in all silent prayer, only the Fatiha is recited.(7) Ibadis, like the Shi‘a and some Malikis, keep with their arms down at their sides when they are in the standing position during prayer.(8) Unlike Sunnis and Shi‘a, Ibadis do not say Amin aft er the Fatiha, and they do not say the qunut invocation in the predawn prayer. Ennami (n.d., 124) translates the qunut as “the imprecation against political enemies during the rit-ual prayer,” but the standard formula for qunut is a request for blessing and does not involve cursing.(9) Some Sunnis say it is recommended to shorten prayer during journeys, while the Hanafi s make it obligatory for a journey of less than fi ft een days. Ibadis say that a traveler must shorten his prayers even if he stays permanently in the place to which he has journeyed, unless he adopts it as a homeland, whereas the Malikis and Shafi ‘is hold that the traveler should say the full prayer if he stays for four or more days (Ennami n.d., 124–25)."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"44 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islam(10) Ibadis require major ritual purity for fasting, just as it is required for praying, in contrast with other Islamic legal schools that say it is not necessary to bathe before morning. Ibadis also say that grave sins cause the breaking of the fast.(11) Whereas other legal schools permit a person to make up missed days of Ramadan fasting at any time, Ibadis require the days to be consecutive.(12) I n zakat (the alms tax), Ibadis calculate the nisab (minimum amount of wealth one must own before one owes zakat) on cattle in the same way as for camels, unlike the Sunnis.(13) Th e person to whom zakat is given must be in a state of walaya.(14) Ibadis and Shi‘a hold that unlawful intercourse constitutes a permanent impediment to marriage between the two guilty parties, but most Sunnis allow them to marry each other.(15) Almost all Ibadi scholars held that the property of a mawla—a non-Arab taken as client of an Arab tribe—should be inherited by his own people, not by his patron. If he has no relatives, it goes to members of his ethnic group who live in the area. However, this point is moot today, because the system of client-age applied only to the Umayyad period; during the ‘Abbasid period, non-Arab Muslims no longer needed to attach themselves to an Arab tribe.(16) Unlike other Islamic legal schools, the Ibadis impose fi xed measures according to which compensation must be paid for infl icting bodily injuries less grave than homicide, rather than leaving it up to the discretion of the judge or the victim.(17) Like the Twelver Shi‘a but unlike the Sunnis, Ibadis allow a man to be killed in retaliation for the death of a woman, provided that the woman’s guard-ian pays the family of the man half the blood money that would have been required if the man had been murdered.(18) Like the Sunnis but unlike the Twelver Shi‘a, Ibadis regard temporary marriage (mut‘a) as unlawful.Finally, one might also note that whereas theology, fi qh (jurisprudence), and mysticism are generally separate domains in Sunni Islam (though one may well be competent in all three), there is not such a neat separation among them in Ibadi literature. A title like Qamus al-Shari‘a (al-Sa‘di 1983–89), for example, would lead one to think that it deals entirely with law, but in fact it is a compen-dium of all types of religious knowledge—theological, legal, ethical, and mysti-cal.

Salim b ‘Udayyam al-Rawahi, is better known in Oman as Abu Muslim al-Bahlani, Oman’s masterful poet. “Al-Rawahi” refers to his belonging to the large tribe of Banu Rawaha, while “Bahlani” refers not to the city of Bahla but to a subgroup of the Banu Rawaha. “Abu Muslim,” “the father of Muslim,” was an appellation that did not refer to his son’s name, but was favored by our author as a symbolic representation of his attachment to Islam. Nasir al-Rawahi was probably born in 1277/1860,35 son of Shaykh Salim b. ‘Udayyam al-Bahlani al-Rawahi, who became governor and judge of the crucial city of Nizwa during the short-lived imamate of ‘Azzan b. Qays, which stands out in the minds of some Ibadis, including Nasir al-Rawahi, as a great triumph of Muslim ideals against the evils of tyranny, obliterated only with the assis-tance of infi dels who want not hing more t han to destroy Islam. As we have seen, the drama was repeated in the early twentieth century with the movement to establish a new imamate under Salim b. Rashid al-Kharusi, a movement that al-Rawahi enthusiastically supported with his poetry, likening his role vis-à-vis that movement to the poet Hassan b. Th abit’s role vis-à-vis the Prophet during Muhammad’s lifetime.Th e late nineteenth century was a period of political unrest and economic hardship in Oman, leading many wealthy Omanis to emigrate to East Africa, where Zanzibar had become a wealthy town and center of Islamic learning. Among the émigrés was Nasir al-Rawahi’s father, who became a judge in Zan-zibar when Nasir was a young man. Nasir joined his father there in 1295/1878, and although he returned to Oman for a fi ve-year period in 1882, he returned to Zanzibar and remained there until his death on 2 Safar 1339/14 October 1920. 35. Th ere are three diff erent reports on the date of his birth: 1273 /1856, 1277/1860, and 1284/1867, but the middle date appears to be most likely, both because that is the date given by his grandson, according to Ahmad b. Sa‘ud al-Siyabi’s introduction to al-Rawahi (2001, 1:7 in footnote), and because he was circumcised in Nizwa during the brief imamate of ‘Azzan b. Qays, 1868–1871, according to al-Mahruqi (1999–2000, 65)."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"46 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ IslamSome have speculated that Oman seemed too isolated or rigid an environment to someone used to the cosmopolitan intellectual atmosphere of Zanzibar.Al-Rawahi became a poet and judge of great renown. With Nasir b. Sulay-man al-Lamki, he founded and edited the fi rst Arabic newspaper in Zanzibar, Al-Najah, in which he expressed his opinions on many of the issues confronting Muslims around the world in his day. His support of Egyptian conferences on pan-Islamism and the salafi ideas of Muhammad ‘Abduh needs to be considered as a counterbalance to the ideas expressed in this ‘A q i d a , which appear to rigidly exclude non-Ibadis from the community of true Muslims, although they remain among the ahl al-qibla. Al-Rawahi was known as the best scholar in the Ara-bic language in Zanzibar, and was sought out by Sunni as well as Ibadi students (Farsy 1989, 170, 180).Al-Rawahi is also considered a great mystic—al-Siyabi (introduction to al-Rawahi 2001, 1:7) described him as “one of the people of secrets and the doyen of poetry as well as a great scholar of jurisprudence”—and indeed many of his poems express his mystical inclinations. He is said to have foretold events that would happen in the future and to have performed other miracles. Yet at the same time he appears to have been a modest, generous, and unassuming man.Although al-Rawahi authored two major works of prose in addition to his many poems, his prose works until recently remained unpublished, whereas his Diwan has been published on three separate occasions, in various forms (al-Mahruqi 1999–2000, 46–63). It is an interesting fact that both his major prose works, Nithar “al-Jawhar,” a commentary on Nur al-Din al-Salimi’s poetic sum-mary of Ibadi jurisprudence, Jawhar al-nizam fi ‘ilmayy al-adyan wa-’l-ahkam, and the current work, Al-‘Aqida ’ l-Wahbiyya, were never completed. According to al-Siyabi (introduction to al-Rawahi 2001, 1:19), al-Rawahi intended Jawhar al-nizam to be twenty-two volumes long, but he completed only three, though the manuscript has been published in fi ve volumes. Th e lack of completion of Al-‘A q i d a ’ l -Wa h b i y y a may be inferred from the abruptness of its ending, appearing to be at the beginning of a new subject, and lacking the usual author’s notes on the date of completion. Th e manuscript copiers recognized the incompleteness of the work by noting, “Th is is all I found,” and they all stop at the same point. It appears that al-Rawahi did not succeed in being as brief as he had intended, for in his introduction to the text he states that he intends this primer as the briefest of introductions for beginning students of theology."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Introduction • 47Al-‘Aqida ’l-Wahbiyya: Structure and TopicsTh is primer in Ibadi doctrine, published here in English for the fi rst time, was written in a largely Shafi ‘i-Sunni environment. It might have been intended as an Ibadi counterpart to a Sunni text with a similar purpose, written by the fi ft eenth-century North African scholar, Muhammad b. Yusuf al-Sanusi, who synthesized and popularized doctrines that had been taught through “long treatises contain-ing endless digressions on metaphysical concepts and logical points which few could read” (Kenny 1970; Bencheneb 1999). Sanusi’s short creed was the main theological text that Sunni students memorized in Africa and in the Hadramawt, the desert valley of southeast Yemen that historically had the most direct impact on religious life on the East African coast and is credited with the Islamization of East Africa and southeast Asia, where the dominant school of Islam is Shafi ‘i, and many of the important religious scholars were of Hadrami origin. Until the twentieth century, Ibadi students faced a quandary similar to that of Sunni stu-dents in the fi ft eenth century: Ibadi doctrine needed to be learned through books that were long, complicated, and diffi cult to read. In response to the aversion many students had toward Abu Sa‘id al-Kudami’s classic work, Kitab al-Istiqama, because of its length and repetitiveness, the chief Ibadi judge of Zanzibar, ‘Ali b. Muhammad al-Mundhiri, composed Nahj al-haqa’iq (1896). It is likely that simi-lar factors led al-Rawahi to compose Al-‘Aqida ’ l-Wahbiyya.Al-Rawahi’s primer is impressive for its coverage of many diff erent schools of Islamic theology—Sunni, Shi‘i, Mu‘tazili, and Khariji—as well as diff erences between the Ibadis of North Africa from those of “the east”—Oman and Zan-zibar. Clearly, the main adversaries with whom Ibadis have to contend in the modern world are the Sunnis. On the Swahili coast in the second half of the nineteenth century, many Ibadis converted to Sunni Islam, making the exposi-tion and defense of Ibadi doctrines imperative (Hoff man 2005a). It is al-Rawahi’s coverage of divergent Muslim interpretations, in addition to the relative neglect of Ibadi doctrine in modern scholarship, that makes Al-‘Aqida ’ l-Wahbiyya such an important and interesting text. In this relatively brief introduction to Ibadi doctrine, al-Rawahi on the one hand simplifi es and elucidates doctrines that must otherwise be gleaned from massive, dense, and oft en diffi cult texts; on the other hand, he provides a thorough and fascinating discussion of the doctrines of many other Muslim groups, past and present, on the points at hand, including"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"48 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islamthe diff erences between the two major schools of Sunni theology, the Ash‘arites and the Maturidites. Because Ibadis must defend doctrines that set them apart from other Muslims, they retain an interest in such questions as the relationship between God’s essence and attributes, the distinction between the name and what is named, and the creation or eternity of the Qur’an—questions that have long ceased to interest Sunni Muslims. Th e resemblance of some of their doctrines to those of the Mu‘tazila, whose works have rarely survived destruction at the hands of the defenders of Sunni orthodoxy, adds to the interest scholars should have in Ibadi theological works, although, as already noted, Ibadism diverges from Mu‘tazilism on a number of important points, and agrees with Ash‘arism on the important question of predestination.Another theological primer with which al-Rawahi’s work might be com-pared is Nur al-Din al-Salimi’s Mashariq anwar al-‘uqul (A. al-Salimi 1995b).36 Al-Salimi was the leading Ibadi scholar of Oman during most of al-Rawahi’s lifetime, preceding al-Rawahi in death by only six years. Mashariq anwar al-‘uqul is actually a commentary on a theological poem al-Salimi had written earlier, entitled Anwar al-‘uqul. It was very common in much of classical Islamic culture to write textbooks in the form of poetry for mnemonic purposes, and then to write commentaries on one’s own poem. Many of the scholars of Zanzibar, both Sunni and Ibadi, even wrote letters to one another in the form of poetry, and one Sunni scholar, ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Amawi, wrote extensive diaries of his travels in the African mainland on behalf of Sayyid Barghash in the form of poetry, with a prose commentary written underneath (Hoff man 2006). Some of this poetry can be seen as a kind of conceit; there is no need to render personal letters or diaries in poetic form, except to demonstrate one’s skill. Al-Rawahi himself was a superb poet—Muhammad b. Yusuf Atfayyish called him “the poet of the Arabs,” and as 36. Th is celebrated Ibadi text was fi rst published in Cairo in 1314/1896–1897 at the expense of the sultan of Zanzibar, Sayyid Humud b. Muhammad b. Sa‘id, but this copy is now very rare and, oddly enough, it fails to note that al-Salimi is the author! Harvard University has a copy, but lists Sayyid Humud as the author, and the University of Minnesota has a copy, but lists Ahmad b. Sumayt, a prominent Shafi ‘i scholar in Zanzibar, as the author, a confusion apparently caused by the book’s inclusion of a laudatory biography of Sayyid Humud written by Ahmad b. Sumayt and placed at the beginning of the book. However, a comparison of the Damascus edition of al-Salimi’s Mashariq with the Cairo edition makes it clear that this is the same book."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Introduction • 49such he is oft en referred in Oman today—but most of his pedagogical writing has been done in prose. Al-Rawahi’s primer is written in the form of a student’s ques-tions and a teacher’s answers, a technique that is not very common in Muslim textbooks. A number of important early Muslim texts, like al-Shafi ‘i’s Risala in jurisprudence and al-Ash‘ari’s Kitab al-luma‘ fi ’ l-radd ‘ala ahl al-zaygh wa-’ l-bida‘, used the technique of a dialogue with an imagined opponent. Th ere are also many books on Islamic theology and other topics in the form of a student’s questions and the teacher’s answers, but in these cases these are renditions of actual interviews a student had with his famous teacher and are written by the student (e.g., S. al-Khalili 1987). Al-Rawahi’s text, however, takes a form some-what like a Catholic catechism and is not a recording of any actual dialogue. Furthermore, it is not the student who is writing the book, but the teacher.In terms of topic coverage, al-Rawahi’s primer is similar in many ways to al-Salimi’s Mashariq anwar al-‘uqul. Both of them talk about the types of knowl-edge, the ways to know, and what one must know to be a good Muslim. Th ey both analyze the jumla, the basic statement of faith that adds to the shahada—the statement that “there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah”—the statement that “what Muhammad brought [the Qur’an] is true.” Th ey speak of God’s incomparability, His attributes, and so forth, in very simi-lar terms. Th ey treat the topics of faith and infi delity, association and dissocia-tion, at length. Both books treat the opinions of varied Muslim groups, including such Muslim philosophers as Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Farabi (d. 339/950) and Abu ‘Ali al-Husayn b. ‘Abdallah b. Sina (known as Ibn Sina or Avicenna, 370–428/980–1037). But there are diff erences, too: al-Rawahi analyzes at length the relationship between a name and what is named, and he discusses non-Muslim religions and how Muslims should interact with non-Muslims of diff erent reli-gions. Al-Salimi’s coverage of the topic of free will versus predestination is not very long, but it is highlighted more than in al-Rawahi’s text. On the other hand, as already noted, al-Rawahi’s text is incomplete, probably because the author died before he could complete it.Al-Rawahi says he composed this work for beginning students, but consid-ering the obtuseness of the questions it entertains, one may surmise that it is a text intended for students who today would be in secondary school or in their fi rst year of seminary. Th e clarity with which he explains essential theological and philosophical concepts makes this text valuable for pedagogical purposes"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"50 • Essentials of Ibaˉd·ıˉ Islameven today, when few students would have the competence to plunge into more complex works of theology. His reasoning on basic issues like the proofs for the existence of God as the Necessary Being, the First Cause, and the only eternal are standard Aristotelianism, no diff erent from those of Ash‘arite Muslim theolo-gians since the twelft h century CE.One of the striking features of this work, and of other Islamic texts written in the classical style, is its apparent divorce from contemporary realities: keeping to a traditional genre and mode of argumentation, it refl ects the situation at the time of the emergence of the sect. Al-Rawahi discusses the ideas of such long-extinct schools of thought as the Karramiyya and the Mu‘tazila as if they were still important; he discusses the way in which Muslims should treat Christians as if Christians were a subjugated population wearing the dress they wore in the Middle Ages, utterly ignoring the fact that he was writing in a land administered through the British Colonial Offi ce. Indeed, the pressing issues of the day for Muslims in Zanzibar had nothing to do with how to deal with subject Christian populations, but how to deal with the infl uence of a foreign power whose styles and way of life were increasingly appealing to Muslims. Th is is not altogether surprising, as works of jurisprudence preserve an ideal that was formulated in the early days of Muslim ascendancy. Although the present work is more concerned with theology than with jurisprudence, the defi nitions of the categories of belief and unbelief and the concepts of association (walaya) and dissociation (bara’a), far more fundamental to Ibadism than to other schools of Islamic thought, need practical description that runs into the realm of jurisprudence.Translation of al-Rawahi’s Creed When I read al-Rawahi’s creed in 2000–2001, no scholars with whom I spoke were aware of any publication of the Arabic text.

Th ere is no doubt that the useful sciences include those pursued for the sake of things other than themselves (fi ’l-‘ulum al-nafi ‘a ma huwa maqsud li-ghayrihi) as well as that which is pursued for its own sake. Undoubtedly something that is pursued for its own sake is nobler than something that is pursued for the sake of some-thing else. Isn’t it true that the latter is but a means to the former?T: Yes, my son, you have hit upon the heart of the matter (al-fass wa-’l-nass). “I only wish to reform you as much as I can, and I can have no success unless it is given by God” (Q 11:88). God has enabled you to see the nobility and importance of the science that is pursued for its own sake, so do not go without it, but bind your ambition to it and t hrow off all impediments, for it is the science of the high-est rank and virtue, the most benefi cial, useful, and worthy of persistent study.S: How thirsty I am (ma a‘tash kibdi) for this science! What is it, then, so I may turn my eff orts and time to it?T: It is t he science of t heolog y (‘ilm al-tawhid), a lso ca l led (al-mu‘abbar ‘anhu bi) the science of discourse (‘ilm al-kalam).11. Th e term ‘ilm al-kalam (literally, “the science of discourse/speech/debate”), traditionally used to mean speculative theology in Islam, appears to derive from the fact that theology emerged out of and in the form of debates on matters of faith. Ibadis prefer to use the term ‘ilm al-tawhid."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"58 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-WahbiyyaS: Of what does this noble science consist?T: Th is science consists of the affi rmation of the existence of the eternal Maker (ithbat al-sani‘ al-qadim), His unique divinity (tawhiduhu fi ’l-uluhiyya), His transcendence beyond all likeness to originated things (tanzihuhu ‘an mush-abahat al-hawadith), His description with the attributes of majesty (ittisafuhu bi-sifat al-jalal) and generosity (ikram), which are the attributes of greatness (‘uzma) and benefi cence(ihsan). [It also consists of] the affi rmation of prophet-hood, which is the foundation (asas) of Islam. Th e laws (al-shara’i‘) and regula-tions (al-ahkam) [of the Shari‘a] are built upon this science, for were it not for the immutability (thubut) of the Maker with His attributes, the sciences of exegesis, Hadith, jurisprudence and its roots would not have been formed. By this sci-ence one progresses (yataraqqa) in faith in the Last Day from the rank of merely imitating the beliefs of others (min darajat al-taqlid) to the rank of verifi cation (iqan), which is the only cause (huwa ’ l-sabab al-wahid) of guidance and success (najah) in this world, and victory (al-fawz) and prosperity (al-falah) in the next. It is the science by which you can prove (ithbat) religious doctrines (al-‘aqa’id al-diniyya) to others and compel them to recognize the truth (wa-ilzamuhu iyyahu) by bringing forth proofs (bi-irad al-hujaj) and countering specious arguments (daf ‘ al-shubah).Lesson 2: Th e Defi nition of Tawh i dS: What is the literal meaning of tawhid (ma huwa ’ l-tawhid lughatan)?T: It is a second-form verbal noun (taf ‘il) referring to one who makes a thing one or declares it to be one or unique. Tawh i d means declaring uniqueness (tafrid), which can also be called ifrad.2S: What does tawhid mean according to Islamic law (al-shar‘)?T: It means believing in God’s uniqueness (ifrad Allah) in His essence (dhatihi), attributes (sifatihi), words (aqwalihi), acts (af‘alihi), worship (‘ibadatihi), 2. Th e diffi culty in translation here is that tawhid, which we typically translate as God’s oneness or monotheism, is a verbal noun carrying a form of causation, literally meaning “making one,” but in this case “declaring one.” It therefore refers to the believer who holds God to be one, whereas English cor-relates do not always carry the same reference. Th e words tafrid (also a second-form verbal noun) and ifrad (a fourth-form verbal noun, also implying causation) likewise mean to “make unique.”"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Knowledge of God’s Unity • 59and the rest of His perfections—that is, belief that He is unique in all these aspects (fi dhalika kullihi), with nothing else whatsoever sharing in any of His aspects (bi-ayyi wajhin kana). It also means affi rming (iqrar) that and believing that Muham-mad is the trustworthy servant of God and His clear (al-mubin) Messenger to all human beings and jinn,3 and that he is the seal of the prophets, and that what he brought is truth from the Lord of all being, and that he delivered the message with which he was sent to people and then was taken to the abode of peace (qabadahu ila dar al-salam), where he was received with honor, on whom be the best blessing and peace. One must profess all these things. Th ese are the three matters that are essential to belief and profession of faith when one fi rst reaches puberty.S: If a person believes this and professes it, what is the judgment [of the law] concerning him (kayf yakun hina’idhin hukmuhu)?T: Th en he is a monotheist (muwahhid) in the eyes of God and His creation (‘ inda ’ llah wa-’ l-khalq), and the regulations pertaining to monotheists apply to him (tajri ‘alayhi ahkam al-muwahhidin), such as giving the greeting of peace and its response,4 inheriting from close relatives like his father, washing him if he dies, praying over him, burying him with the Muslims, inheriting his wealth, and the prohibition against killing him, plundering his wealth (ghunm malihi), and enslaving his children (sabyi dhurriyatihi).S: If he is ignorant of any of the aspects of monotheism or denies it or has doubts about it, what is his condition (kayfa yakunu haluhu)?T: He is an unbeliever in God (mushrik bi-’ llah), and the regulations apply-ing to him are those that pertain to unbelievers.3. Prophets are sent to both people and jinn, according to the Qur’an. Human beings and jinn are the two species that are accountable (mukallaf) under the law to believe in God and obey Him—one could say they are burdened with the freedom to choose to obey, whereas all other things in creation are naturally submissive to God, although both Sunni and Ibadi Muslims hold to the doctrine of predestination. In the Qur’an the jinn are said to have been created from a fl ame of fi re before Adam’s creation from clay (15:27). Th ey are mainly described in very negative terms, but a group of jinn heard a recitation of the Qur’an and became believers (72:1).4. Th e greeting of peace, salam ‘alaykum (“Peace be upon you”), is reserved for Muslims, and one should respond to such a greeting, according to the Qur’an, with an even better greeting (4:86). By convention, the response is Wa-‘alaykum as-salam wa-rahmat Allah wa-barakatuhu—“And on you be peace and God’s mercy and blessing.”"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"60 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-WahbiyyaS: W hat must a person profess, believe, and k now as soon as he comes of age?T: He must know that God has a company (jumla) of noble angels, on whom be the purest peace. Among them he must single out Gabriel, on whom be peace, and know him by name and affi liate to him (yatawallahu) and know that he is God’s messenger to Muhammad, on whom be blessings and peace, [bringing him] the religion, the Qur’an and Islam. And he must affi liate to the whole com-pany of angels by seeking mercy for them (bi-’ l-tarahhum), but not asking for forgiveness of their sins (duna ’ l-istighfar), because asking forgiveness implies that they have sinned (li-iham al-istighfar sabqa dhanb), which is impossible for them. One must act toward them in a manner appropriate to their natures (yajib la-hum ma yuwafi q taba’i‘ahum).He must know that God has a company of prophets and messengers and that they are all sons of Adam. Th en he must single out (yaqsid ila) Adam, the father of humanity, on whom be blessing and peace, and know that he is the fi rst of the messengers. Th en he must single out our prophet, Muhammad, peace and bless-ings upon him, and affi liate to him and know that he is the last of the messengers.He must know that God has a collection of books (jumlat al-kutub), and among these he must single out the Qur’an and draw near to it.He must know of the existence of death, resurrection (al-ba‘th), judgment (al-hisab), punishment (al-‘iqab), paradise (al-janna), and hellfi re (al-nar), each by its proper name. And he must know and believe that God has commanded him to obey Him and has prohibited disobedience, and that God has a reward (thawab) unlike any other and a punishment unlike any other, and that they never end (la yanqati‘an) or change (la yataghayyaran).[He must know] that monotheism (tawhid) means declaring [God to be] unique (ifrad), and that unbelief (shirk) means believing He has partners who are equal to Him (al-musawat). He must know the diff erence between sins leading to unbelief (kaba’ir al-shirk) and sins leading to hypocrisy (kaba’ir al-nifaq), and the prohibition against [shedding] the blood of Muslims, plundering their wealth and enslaving their children, because of their monotheism. He must know about Islam, the Muslims, unfaithfulness (kufr), the unfaithful, the necessity of affi li-ation [with co-religionists] (walaya) and dissociation [from others] (bara’a), the six non-Islamic religions (al-milal al-sitt) and the regulations concerning them, and the unfaithfulness (kufr) of the person who is ignorant of any of these things."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Knowledge of God’s Unity • 61[And he must know] that God has required him to know them, and has appointed a reward for knowing them and a punishment for being ignorant of them.S: If he knows all these things you have mentioned, in addition to the fi rst three [you mentioned], and believes them and professes them and does all that is required of him and abandons all that is prohibited, what is his condition?T: His faith is complete (huwa kamil al-iman) in the eyes of God and of His creatures. And if he is ignorant of it or of any part of it (shay’an minha), or denies it or any part of it, or has doubts about it, he is an unbeliever (mushrik).S: If he neglects to do one of the requirements, like performing ritual prayer (salat) or paying the alms-tax (zakat), because he is disinclined to do them (tashahhiyan), not because he believes it to be allowable to neglect them (la isti-hlalan), what is the status of that neglect (ma manzilat hadha ’ l-tark)?T: It is a status of hypocrisy. Th e one who wantonly neglects his obligation (al-tarik muntakihan) is a hypocrite, just as if he had committed a prohibited act like adultery, wine consumption, or murder.S: If he considers permissible something that a text explicitly requires or prohibits, how is he to be judged (kayfa hukmuhu)?T: He is an unbeliever (mushrik), because he goes against the explicit mean-ing of a text by rejecting it.Lesson 3: Th e First Obligations a Person Who Is Subject to the Shari‘a (al-mukallaf) Must KnowS: Obligations must be prioritized, so what is the most important religious obligation?T: Th ere is disagreement (ikhtilaf qa’im) among the community of Muham-mad (al-umma) concerning the fi rst obligation, but the truth (al-haqq) is that the fi rst obligation is knowledge of God Most High and of His oneness (wahdatihi), His creation of the world (sani‘iyyatihi li-’ l-‘alam), His attributes, and the rest of the things that pertain to His divinity (sa’ir ahkam uluhiyyatihi).S: Is this knowledge received by intellectual refl ection (tu’ khadh bi-’l-nazar) and seeking proofs (al-istidlal), or by imitating the beliefs of others (bi-’ l-taqlid)?T: Not at all (kalla), our scholars agree that it is not permissible to imitate the beliefs of others (la yajuz al-taqlid fi ha ‘ indana ittifaqan). Th e faith of the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"62 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-Wahbiyyaimitator is of no consequence (la ‘ibrata bi-iman al-muqallid), for knowledge emerges from proof (nashi’a ‘an al-dalil), because religion is taken by compelling proof (taqyidan), not by imitation (taqlidan). But although the faith of the imita-tor is wea k a nd unwor t hy of consideration, it is streng t hened by learning t hrough the teaching of someone who makes him aware (munabbih) that God is eter-nal (qadim) and uniquely one (munfarid bi-’ l-wahdaniyya) in His essence, His attributes, His acts, and the worship (al-ma‘budiyya) [that is due to Him]. You know that to affi rm this is monotheism (tawhid) and to deny it is unbelief (shirk), and that the one who knows these or other attributes and abandons [this teach-ing] is an unbeliever, though not if he is confused, and that the Majestic One (jalla sha’nuhu) is unique in divinity and lordship (munfarid fi ’ l-uluhiyya wa-’ l-rububiyya), indivisible (ghayr qabil li-’ l-tajazzu’), not described by the word “all” (kull), and that the Most High (ta‘ala) is unique in being named with the word of majesty (lafz al-jalala) [Allah].S: What is the way (al-sabil) to know the Creator?T: Th e way to know the Creator is by knowing existing things and distin-guishing between objects of knowledge by knowing that things are of two types (darban), either eternal (qadim) or originated (muhdath). Th e eternal is God the Majestic (subhanahu), who is unique in His oneness, divinity, and lordship. Th e originated is of two types: body (jism) and accident (‘arad). If you understand (in adrakta) by the proofs of dependency (bi-dalil al-haja), incapacity (al-‘ajz), and composition (al-tarkib) that everything except God is originated (hadith), then you will know (‘ulima) that the Creator is unlike all other things in that there is nothing He cannot do (la ya‘ jiz) and He needs nothing (la yahtaj). If He were like them, He would also need a creator, which would result in an infi nitely regressing series [of causes] (fa-yatasalsalu) or circular reasoning (yadur), both of which are impossible.55. Th e proof of dependency is a proof built on the idea that the existence of all originated things depends on the existence of God, who is the cause of their existence. Th e proof of incapacity is based on the idea that all originated things are sustained by God’s power and are unable to sustain their own exis-tence. Th e proof of composition is based on the idea that all beings except God are composed of parts (e.g., matter and form) and require a cause to bring those parts together. Th e cause of the existence and composition of all things must itself be simple and uncomposed, because if it were composed of parts it would require another being to cause the combination of its parts. Aristotle had argued that at"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Knowledge of God’s Unity • 63S: What is an accident (‘arad)?T: An accident is what cannot exist on its own, like light, dark ness, color, life, death, stillness, standing, sitting, and other movements.S: Is an accident visible (mushahad)?T: It is said that it is not visible to us with the eye.S: What is meant by saying (ma ’l-murad) it is not visible to the eye?T: What is meant is that it cannot be seen independently (bi-’ l-istiqlal), but can only be seen by means of a body (bi-wasitat jism), like light, darkness, and color. Darkness takes shape (tartasim) in the air because air is a body, or on a wall or on the ground, for example. Th is indicates that air is a divisible body and that the human being or the bird in its speed grabs hold of it and is pushed forward. Against those who say that air does not exist and that the darkness in it is nonex-istent (‘adam), neither accident nor body, it is said that it is subject to extinction (mulazim li-’ l-fana’), in that it does not remain for more than one state (hal), for light and darkness vary in each state from what they are in a diff erent state. No state passes over it that does not change (la tamdi ‘alayhi hal illa taghayyar), although it is not visible to us because of its subtlety (li-diqqatihi).S: What is movement (al-haraka)?T: It is two locations (kawnan) at two diff erent times (fi anayn mukhtalifayn) in two diff erent places (fi makanayn). It can be explained (bayanuhu) as trans-ference (tahawwul) from one place to another. Both time and place necessarily change, and this change is either acquired (kasbiyya) or involuntary (daruriyya).6S: What is rest (sukun)?the origin of the chain of causation there must be an uncaused cause, or an unmoved mover. Were this not the case, the chain of causation would regress to infi nity, which is rationally intolerable. Although Ibadis, like Sunnis, believe God is the direct cause of all things and therefore do not believe in a chain of causation, they employ the argumentation against an infi nite regression in the series of causes to argue for the necessity of the existence of a fi rst cause, Who is God.6. In kalam theology, kawn is a technical term meaning “location.” Motion is defi ned as “a minimum of two consecutive locations,” whereas rest is “a single location.” Human actions are seen as movements created by God in human beings. All acts, whether or not we perceive them as our voluntary acts, are in fact the acts of God, although there is a distinction between acts “acquired” as a result of our choice and “necessary” or involuntary acts, such as shivering."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"64 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-WahbiyyaT: Rest is a single location (kawn wahid) at a single time (fi an wahid), or if you like, you may say in a single place. Each part of rest is rest (kull juz’ min al-sukun sukun), so that no one knows its time but God. Likewise, each part of movement is movement, so that no one knows its time but God. Rest is likewise either acquired, which is the rest of someone who is capable of movement, or involuntary, like the rest of inanimate objects (al-jamad) or the rest of someone who is incapable of movement because of illness, sleep, or intoxication.S: What is a body?T: A body is something that occupies space (mutahayyiz). Occupation of space (al-hayyiz) concerns direction (al-janib) and place (al-makan). Something that occupies space (al-mutahayyiz) and whose essence has taken a place (akhad-hat dhathuh makanan) is called a substance (al-jawhar), which is diff erent from an accident. Our [theological] opponents (mukhalifuna) say that a substance is what cannot occupy space or be divided into parts, like a tiny dot (al-nuqta ’ l-daqiqa). We reject this defi nition, because any thing that is tiny must have dimensions (la-hu jihat), and anything that has dimensions occupies space and is also composed of parts (‘ iyan fi ’l-tajazzu’). It can also be divided (qabil li-’ l-qisma)—that is, it can be seen, although a body may be invisible, like air, if we say that air is a body, though it is the most subtle (altaf) of bodies, like the wind. A body might be vis-ible and lifeless, but with a condition resembling life, like soil into which a grain or seed is thrown for planting; or it might be lifeless and without this condition, like rocks and iron; or it could be visible and alive (hayawan), crawling and walk-ing but irrational, like the beasts (al-baha’im) and all other things that have spirit (dhawat al-arwah); or it can be rational and accountable, like the angels, jinn, and human beings (al-bashar). Th ere is no doubt that the prophets see the angels and jinn, as can any of God’s servants whom He wishes.S: Look what you are saying, dear teacher! Don’t you know (alaysa ama-maka) the words of the Most High, that “he [Satan] and his tribe watch you from a position where you cannot see them” (Q 7:27)?T: Do you think I can fall into a trap from which I cannot escape (ahsunu ’l-sadr minhu)? Th e meaning of the verse is that you cannot see them whenever you wish or whenever they are present, but you can see them through your imagi-nation or in reality some of the time, as proved by incidents of this kind—not as al-Shafi ‘i says, that they are never really seen (la yuhaqqaqun qat‘an).S: Do the angels and jinn see each other?"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Knowledge of God’s Unity • 65T: Indeed (ajal), the angels see each other and the jinn see each other.S: Why do you describe the angels as crawling and moving, though they are not fl esh and blood?T: Th e attribution of crawling and moving does not depend on fl esh and blood. No doubt or problem is caused by describing the angels in this way, for they have been described as walking and fl ying.S: I see you have placed the angels in the category of animals (hayawan).7T: Yes, they are unquestionably hayawan in the comprehensive meaning of the word: any creature in whom life inheres (man hallat fi hi al-hayat) is a liv-ing creature (hayawan), not dead or inanimate—not in the sense that they are animals who are nourished by material substances and whose natures are full of desires.S: Why are humans and jinn called “the two heavy burdens” (al-thaqalayn) (Q 55:31)?T: Th e meaning is that they are burdened with subjection to the law (al-taklif), which because of its diffi culty is likened to a heavy thing with which they are burdened. Or it might mean that they have burdened the earth with their sins and deeds and the things they have made. It is also said to be because of the weightiness of their opinion.S: If the meaning of the appellation (wajhu ’ l-tasmiya) is that they bear the burden of accountability, which because of its diffi culty is likened to a heavy thing with which they are burdened, are not the angels also accountable? What is the meaning of accountability other than taking the burden of something for which one is accountable? So how are they excluded from this appellation?T: Th e angels are accountable in the sense that they are ordered and prohib-ited, but in their case that order and prohibition do not weigh them down and are not diffi cult for them, regardless of its form, extent, or manner; for them, fulfi lling God’s commands is comparable to (fi darajati) what it would be like for us, the two burdened groups, to fulfi ll our pleasures and desires. Th eir account-ability means that they are commanded and prohibited, but it does not mean that it is heavy or diffi cult for them. So understand (fa-’fh am).7.

Divine wisdom (al-hikma ’ l-ilahiyya) does not allow a rational, mature being to be heedless of the responsibility to worship its Lord according to its capacity and ability (kama fi was‘ ihi wa-taqatihi), just as the divine wisdom does not entail obligating any person or thing that is not rational (man la ya‘qil wa-ma la ya‘qil).S: Where does immunity from error reside (ayna mahall al-‘isma) among those who are accountable?T: It resides in the prophets and the angels.S: Can an act of disobedience be attributed to one who is immune from error (hal tudaf ila ’ l-ma‘sum ma‘siya)?T: Not like the acts of disobedience committed by those who do not have immunity, though God has described (wasafa) some of them as disobeying (bi-ma‘siya), such as Adam, on whom be peace. It is said that some of the angels were described as disobeying, but they are immune from death without faithfulness (ma‘sumun ‘an al-mawt bi-la wafa’). Th ere are also others who sinned (adhnaba ghayruhum) who have been specifi cally identifi ed (man nussa ‘ala annahu) as belonging to the people of affi liation (walaya), but they are immune from dying without faithfulness. Some reject this opinion (rudda hadha ’ l-qawl) because God said, “Th ey [the angels] do not disobey God in what He has commanded them,” and so forth (Q 66:6). Th is objection has been rebutted (ujiba) by point-ing out that what is meant (al-murad) by the disobedience that God excluded from them (nafaha ‘anhum) is not the same as the disobedience that has been referred to. What is possible for them is something that is appropriate for them to disagree with [like when they objected to God’s announced intention to create human beings as viceroys on earth], saying, “Will you place there one who will do corruption in it and shed blood?” (Q 2:30), because it has been reported (warada) that one angel fell from his original rank (ba‘ dan minhum saqata ‘an darajatihi), and the plumage of another was removed from him (ba‘ dan suliba rishuhu), and one of the prophets interceded on his behalf (shafa‘a fi hi).Lesson 4: Th e Th ree Statements of FaithS: What text indicates (ma ’l-dall) the fi rst three teachings?"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Knowledge of God’s Unity • 67T: Th ey are mentioned in the statement by which the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, calls people to faith (hiya ’l-jumla ’llati yad‘u ilayha): the testimony that there is no god but Allah alone, without partner (wahdahu la sharika la-hu), that Muhammad is His servant and His messenger, and that what he brought is truth from God (haqq min ‘ inda ’ llah).S: Explain the statement to me (awsi‘ni bayanan ‘an al-jumla).T: Th e two testimonies and the statement are obligatory (fard) on everyone who is accountable. Each of them is monotheism, and their exegesis is monothe-ism (kulluha tawhid wa-tafsiruha tawhid)—that is, each is one of its character-istics because (bi-ma‘na annahu) monotheism exists only with it, because it is a condition of its existence, or a part of it. To use the term “monotheism” for a char-acteristic of it is a metaphorical allusion (majaz mursal) related to (‘alaqatuhu) its necessity (al-luzum) or its completeness (al-kulliyya) and incompleteness (al-juz’ iyya), together or separately, like naming a conditional thing aft er the con-dition that makes it necessary, or like applying the name of the whole to the part. Monotheism is conditional, and this characteristic and others like it (wa-nahwaha) are a condition of it. Or [one could say that] monotheism is a whole and the characteristics are parts of it, as stated earlier (kama marra). You may draw an analogous conclusion (qis ‘ala hadha) with everything you come across (jami‘u ma yaridu ‘alayka) that is said to be monotheism (tawhid).S: Th is is fi xed in my mind (laqad taqarrar hadha min dhihni). Is it necessary for an accountable person to know that “there is no god but Allah” is monotheism?T: Indeed (haqqan), he must know that it is monotheism.S: Must he know that the testimony that Muhammad is the messenger of God and that what he brought is truth from God is [an essential part of] monotheism?T: Th e predominant answer (al-rajih) is that he does not need to know this [as an essential part of] monotheism, though some say it is necessary to know it as [essential to] monotheism.S: I have learned from the third lesson that an accountable person is either a believer without immunity from sin or a believer with immunity from sin. Inevi-tably there must be unfaithfulness (kufr) corresponding (yuqabilu) to this faith. What are the levels (maratib) of unfaithfulness?T: Unfaithfulness is of two types (kufran): the fi rst is the unfaithfulness of hypocrisy (kufr nifaq), which is ingratitude for God’s blessing (kufr al-ni‘ma), and the second is the unfaithfulness of unbelief (kufr shirk).

Polytheism (shirk musawat) includes rejecting (inkar) one of the prophets of God or one of His angels or rejecting a single letter of God’s speech (harf min kalam Allah). Such rejection is included in polytheism because the denier (al-jahid) has equated (qad sawa) God with something else in His not sending that prophet or revealing that letter or creating that angel, and polytheism means equating God with something else in worship or equating Him with something else in some other matter. Some say that this rejection is to be included in the unbelief of denial (shirk al-juhud). Unbelief of denial is to reject God or a prophet or an angel or a letter of God’s Book. Some say that rejection of less than a word (ma duna ’ l-kalima) from God’s speech does not constitute unbelief. Others say that rejection of less than a verse (ma duna ’l-aya) of it does not constitute unbelief. Th e correct interpretation (al-sahih) is the fi rst [that rejection of a single letter of God’s revelation constitutes unbelief]. Likewise, anyone who rejects a single vowel (haraka) or a single place without a vowel (sukun) of [God’s speech] is an unbeliever,8 though some reports (athar) indicate otherwise, because the vowel and its omission are undoubtedly revealed (tanzil), though indeed a person is not to be considered an unbeliever concerning the verses on which there are diver-gent reports, such as the vowel over the letter waw [which also means “and”] before the letter sin in the saying of the Most High, “And hasten (sari‘u) to for-giveness from your Lord” (Q 3:133).S: What is hypocrisy?T: Hypocrisy is of two types (al-nifaq naw‘an). Th e fi rst is the hypocrite (sahibuhu) who affi rms the statement of faith and believes in it but commits grave sins (al-kaba’ir). Th is person is an immoral hy pocrite (munafi q fasiq), devi-ant (dall), sinful (‘asin), unfaithful (kafi r) because of ingratitude to God for His blessings (kufr ni‘ma).

If you realize (tahaqqaqta) that everything besides the Eternal is originated, you will also realize by the judgment of your intellect that something that is origi-nated must have an originator (muhdith) that originated it (ahdathahu), because one of the necessary rules of reason (min ahkam al-‘uqul bi-’ l-darura) is that nothing is made without a maker (la san‘a bi-duna sani‘), and there is no eff ect (athar) without a cause (mu’aththir), and that cause and maker which bring the originated thing into existence (al-mujid al-muhdith li ’ l-hadith) cannot be of the same genus (jins) as what is made, or else the result is circuitous reasoning (illa lazima ’l-dawr) and a [logically intolerable] endless chain of causes (al-tasalsul). Th is thing that is made (dhalika ’ l-masnu‘) cannot be the maker of itself (ghayr sani‘ li-nafsihi) or it would have to exist before itself and aft er itself, because the maker must exist before the thing that it makes. So the fact that God is creator (kawn Allah khaliqan) entails (yaqtadi) His existence prior to what is created (al-taqaddum ‘ala makhluqihi), and the fact that the creature is created entails its coming into existence later than its creator (ta’akhkhurahu ‘an khaliqihi).

Th e two contradictions here are equality (al-istiwa’) and superiority (al-rajhan) without either being superior (bi-la murajjih), because the existence of anything other than God is equal to its nonexistence, the time in which it comes into being is equal to all other times, the particular place in which it comes into being is equal to all other places, and its particular attributes are equal to other attributes.9 So consider this rational judgment (fa-’nzur hadha ’l-hukm al-‘aqli) and rely on this rational proof (i‘tamid hadhihi ’ l-hujja ’ l-‘aqliyya).S: Is this the entire argument [for the existence] of God (ahadhihi kullu huj-jat Allah)?T: Not at all (kalla), it is not the whole argument [for the existence] of God; it is just a rationa l argument that proves (taqum dalilan) the existence of the eternal Maker, the True Reality (al-haqq), who is holy and exalted (taqaddasa wa-ta‘ala).

Th e best of these is that it is a spiritual light (nur ruhani) by which the soul enables you (qaddaraka bi-hi) [to acquire] necessary and theoretical knowledge (al-‘ulum al-daruriyya wa-’l-nazariyya). Its relationship to the soul (nisbatuhu ila ’l-nafs) is like the relation-ship something has to something else that resembles it. What may be learned from this defi nition (ustufi d min hadha ’l-ta‘rif) is that it is the soul that comprehends (al-mudriku huwa ’l-nafs), and the intellect is only a tool for comprehension (ala fi ’l-idrak), as is the case (wa-mithlahu) with the rest of the faculties (baqiyyat al-quwa). For this reason one scholar said that those who have attained realization (al-muhaqqiqun) agree that what comprehends the universals and particulars is the rational soul (al-nafs al-natiqa), and that the relationship of comprehension to its faculties is like the relationship of the act of cutting (al-qat‘) to a knife.

Its movement is its distinguishing between things and its rest is its abandoning the act of distinguishing. It is also said that it is an accident and that it is the acts themselves of distinguishing and knowing (innahu nafsu ’l-tamyizat wa-’l-‘ilm). According to most scholars of our sect (‘ inda jumhuri ashabina), it is a faculty in the heart, and its rank in relation to it (manzilatuhu minhu) is the same as the rank of sight (al-basar) in relation to the eye, of hear-ing (al-sam‘) in relation to the ear, of smelling in relation to the nose, of tasting in relation to the tongue, and of touching in relation to the body. Th is opinion is also attributed to al-Shafi ‘i, and it does not contradict what has been reported of him, that it is a tool that God created for His servants by which they distinguish between things and their opposites, composed (rakkabaha) by God in them so they can use it to derive proofs (li-yastadillu bi-ha) concerning unseen matters (‘ala ’ l-umur al-gha’ iba) by signs (bi-’ l-‘alamat) which God has set up for them (nasabaha) as a gift and grace from Him (mannan minhu wa-ni‘ma), for this tool is the aforementioned faculty. One of the North African shaykhs of our sect said it is a conceptual entity (ma‘nan) in the heart whose ruler (sultan) is in the head (fi ’l-dimagh), because most of the senses are located in the head and therefore can be lost by a blow to the head. In this case it is an accident, not a body, because it is called a conceptual entity (ma‘nan).11 Malik said it is in the head, as indicated by its loss (dhahabihi) when the head is beaten. ‘Isa b. Yusuf12 said that God might assemble it in any human limb except the soles of the feet, though one could argue that if by “might” is meant the lack of impossibility, He is also able to put it in the soles of the feet.

As there are many and various narrative traditions (hadiths) purporting to be the Sunna, only those that scholars agree are genuine may be used; this is consensus (ijma‘).

If it is judged to be more appro-priate than the express wording of the discourse, it is called the import of the discourse (fahwa ’ l-khitab). Th e import is what is understood by way of certainty (‘ala sabili ’ l-qat‘), as when the Most High said, “Do not say ‘uff ’ to them” (Q 17:23).2 Th e literal meaning is that it is forbidden to say “uff ” to them, but it is understood that the prohibition extends to what is worse than that, like beating or cursing or other such things, which are even more prohibited than saying “uff .” 2.

If what is understood from the express wording of the discourse is equal to it in judgment, it is the sense of the discourse (lahin al-khitab), and the mean-ing of “sense” is that the words allude to something else, as when the Most High says, “Do not eat their wealth” (Q 4:2). What is expressly prohibited is eating, but the passage alludes to all wasteful consumption (itlaf), and the prohibition of eat-ing and the prohibition of wasteful consumption are the same. We could say that “eating” is used in the sense of wasteful consumption (fi mutlaq al-itlaf), and that it is a metaphor derived (majaz mursal) from the use of a phrase with a particular meaning to indicate a broader meaning.

Origination (al-huduth) is impossible with respect to (fi haqqi) the Most High because origination requires an originator, and you know that a thing cannot originate itself, because if the originator is itself originated, it would require an originator. Likewise, if the number [of causes] is fi nite we have circular reasoning (lazima ’l-dawr), which is the dependence of the existence of one thing [A] on the existence of something else [B] that likewise depends on it [A] for its existence, on one level or on several levels (bi-martaba aw maratib). Th e impossibility of such circular reasoning is evident (istihalat al-dawr zahir) because it would be necessary for each of the two originating things to precede the other as well as to come into being aft er the other, which is the conjunction of two mutually contradictory propositions. Indeed, it would be necessary for the existence of each to precede and come aft er its own existence and for the exis-tence of a thing to depend on itself. All that is impossible, and what leads to an impossibility is impossible. If the number is not fi nite and each originated thing is preceded by another originated thing, this would necessitate a series of infi -nitely regressing causes, and that is impossible because it leads to the termination of what has no end, which is unintelligible.Since by defi nition (li-dhatihi) it is impossible for the Necessary Being to come into being or be originated, the necessity and eternity of His existence are inevitable (ta‘ayyana la-hu wujub al-wujud wa-’ l-qidam). And if it is established (idha thabata) that eternity belongs to God alone, then it is established that He is the creator (badi‘) of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, and that there is no creator or originator beside Him.

Th at is the belief of our sect, the people of straightness, and the Ash‘arites agree with us on this point.S: What doctrine opposes this (madha yuqabilu hadha ’ l-qawl)?T: Th e doctrine of the Kufans opposes this; they say that “name” is derived from “sign” (sima), meaning a distinguishing characteristic (al-‘alama). Th at is the teaching of the Nukkar and the Mu‘tazila. Th ey said, “God exists from all eternity without name or attribute, and when He created the creation He came to be described by names and attributes, and when He causes them to pass away He will remain without attribute or name.” Th is is a monstrous error (khata’ fahish).5. Most Arabic words are based on a tripartite root, but ism, which can mean either “name” or “noun,” is based on an older root of only two consonants; hence the disagreement concerning its derivation (Fleisch 1999). Most dictionaries today place ism under the tripartite sim mim alif maqşura, associated with the verb samma, “to name.”6. Basra, Kufa, and Medina were important centers of learning for the emerging Islamic sci-ences in the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries CE."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Knowledge of God • 81S: What is meant by “name” (ma ’ l-murad bi-’ l-ism)?T: If what is meant is the word (lafz) itself, then it is other than the thing that is named. If what is meant is the meaning, then it is the same as the thing that is named. Th is is the explanation: If you say, “I have written ‘Muhammad,’” you mean the word (lafza) that signifi es the person named Muhammad. If you say, “I came to Muhammad,” you mean the person indicated by the word “Muham-mad.” If you say, for example, “Muhammad is standing,” “Muhammad” is the subject (mubtada’) and “standing” is its predicate (khabar). Or if you say, for example, “I saw Muhammad” or “I passed by Muhammad,” the grammatical declensions are only carried out on the word “Muhammad,” although the states, actions, and meanings all refer to the person Muhammad indicated by the word “Muhammad” upon which the grammatical declensions act. Understand that if you say, for example, “I worship God,” then you direct your worship toward the essence of God, not the name signifying the true object of worship. Otherwise you would be worshipping a letter (harf), so consider (fa-tabassar)!Lesson 3: Th e Origin of the Word of the Name of Majesty (Allah)S: W hat is t he or ig i n of t he word of t he na me of majest y (ma asl lafz ism al-jalala)?T: “Allah” is a name signifying (‘alam ‘ala) the essence of the Necessary Being, because it deserves all perfections.7 As for its derivation, the scholars have disagreed among themselves. Some say it is derived from the verb aliha (to be bewildered), following the vowel pattern of ‘alima,8 because all creatures are bewildered (li-tahayyur al-khalq) concerning His knowledge (fi ma‘rifatihi) and 7. Allah is seen as the comprehensive name of God, containing within it all the other divine names. Th is section somewhat follows Atfayyish (1980, 1:55–70, especially 65ff ).8. Th ere are ten diff erent verbal forms that can generally be used to derive verbs from their roots (there are some rare roots that take up to fi ft een forms). In addition, Form I verbs (of which both aliha and ‘alima are examples) can take diff erent patterns, depending on their vowels. Th e important thing to note here is that the form or pattern of a word depends on its vowel pattern, not on its root consonants. Aliha is derived from the consonantal root alif lam ha’ (’-L-H), and ‘alima is derived from the consonantal root ‘ayn lam mim (‘-L-M), and they have entirely diff erent meanings, but they both use the same vowel structure of fatha (a)- kasra (i)- fatha (a) following their respective consonants. Th erefore aliha follows the vowel pattern of ‘alima."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"82 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-Wahbiyyagreatness. Others say again that it is derived from aliha, following the pattern of ‘alima, when a person worships, in an active construction, meaning seeking to worship (bi-’ l-bina’ li-’ l-fa‘ il ay talab al-‘ ibada). Others say it is a proper name that is not derived from any other word, and that was the opinion of al-Khalil b. Ahmad. It is said that he was seen [aft er his death] by someone in his sleep and was asked, “What did God do with you?” He replied, “He forgave me for saying that the name of the Most High has no philological derivation.”9 Someone else said something to the eff ect that (hasiluhu) when mention is made of the deriva-tion of the name of the Most High, what is meant is the meaning understood by that name; otherwise, a condition of the derivation of a word would be that it be preceded by something else from which it is derived, but the names of God are not preceded by anything, since they are eternal. Th e author of Al-Jawhara10 said: “We say that His great names (wa-‘indana asma’uhu ’l-‘azima) and likewise the attributes of His essence are eternal (kadha sifat dhatihi qadima).” Th at is, the majestic names of God that signify His pure essence (al-dalla ‘ala mujarrad dhatihi), like “Allah,” or that describe an attribute (aw bi-‘tibar al-sifa), like the Knower and the Powerful, are eternal with respect to His being named by them, because He is the one who named His exalted essence by them from all eternity. His essential attributes (sifatuhu ’l-dhatiyya) are also eternal and not preceded by nonexistence, although the aforementioned disagreement refers only to the word ilah, not to the word of majesty (lafz al-jalala, i.e., the name Allah). Al-Qushayri said:People may be named and described by all the names of the Most High God with the characteristics they signify—as a person might be described as having power, knowledge or mercy, for example, although there is a huge diff erence between the eternal attribute and the originated attribute—except this name [Allah, which applies only to God], because it is inherently attached to Him 9. Atfayyish (1980, 1:67) adds a similar story concerning the second/eighth-century gram-marian Sibawayhi, that he was seen in a dream aft er his death and said, “He forgave me for saying that His name, be He exalted, is the most well-known of all things.”10.

So no one but the Most High may be named Allah, for the negative form of the question [in the verse] implies negation (fa-’ l-istifh am inkari).Some say that the origin of “Allah” is ilah (a god), and that its hamza was omitted and elided into the defi nite article al-.11 Th e Most High Creator is unique in having this designation; as the Most High said, “Do you know anyone worthy of His name?”(Q 19:65).

Some say it is from aliha, which means to be bewildered, and that He is named by this as an allusion to what ‘Ali b.

Th at is why it is narrated [from the Prophet]: “Th ink about the commands of God; do not think about God” (al-Suyuti 1981, no. 3348).Some say it is derived from wallah and that the waw was replaced by a hamza, and that is because every creature is bewildered (walih) before Him, either by subjugation (taskhir) alone, as is the case with inan-imate things and animals, or by subjection and will (al-irada) together, as is the case with some people. One of the philosophers said in this regard, “God is the beloved of all things, as indicated by God’s words, ‘Th ere is nothing that does not celebrate His praise, but you do not understand their praise’” (17:44).Others say it is derived from laha (it was veiled), yaluhu (it is veiled), liyah (veiling), and that is an allusion to what the Most High said: “Vision cannot grasp Him, but He grasps all vision” (6:103), to which His name al-Batin (t he Hidden) alludes in the words of the Most High, “Th e Evident and the Hidden” (57:3).11.

Th e Most High said, “Do they have gods (aliha) that can defend them against Us?” (21:43) and “that he [Moses] might abandon you and your gods (wa-alihataka)” (7:127). It is also read as “and your worship” (wa-ilahataka)—that is, worship of you.12 Some people say “lah anta,” meaning “You belong to God,” with one of the two lams [one of the two Ls] removed.Th e expression Allahumma (“oh God!”) is said to be the same as ya Allah (“oh God!”),13 and the letter ya’ at the beginning was replaced by two mims at the end. It is used exclusively in calling on God. It is said that it is tantamount to say-ing, “Oh God, protector!”; in other words, it is a composite expression.Abu Sahl, one of the scholars of the faith in the Maghrib, said:Jabir b.

Th e Exalted One said, “Do you know anyone worthy of His name?”—that is, resembling him in name and deed. And in the Mujaz [of Abu ‘Ammar ‘Abd al-Kafi ] he says, “Allah is the name of the only one worthy of being worshipped.” It is said that all the 12.

On the question of alternate readings of the Qur’an, see Madigan (2001, 13–52).13. Allahumma is an expression that is frequently used in prayers of supplication and repre-sents a form used uniquely with God, whereas ya is used to precede t he na me of a nyone else to whom one is calling.14.

Some people say it is taken from the attribute of height or exaltation, as when one says, “Th e sun is exalted (lahat),” when it rises. Th e scholars disagree whether it is a name that refers to the essence or whether it is derived from an attribute. Some have said it is a name that refers to the essence, for it is inevitable that the essence have a name that would signify it, and upon which all the names of the attributes and characteristics would be based. Some say it is derived from walah (bewilderment), because people are bewildered by Him. Th e Qur’anic verse, “Let him leave you and your gods” (7:127), is also read, “Let him leave you and your worship.” From this is derived the expression yata’allah, meaning “he worships.” It is said that it is from His deserving worship. Al-Rummani said, “Th e root of your saying ‘Allah’ is alih. Th e letter hamza has been removed and the letters alif and lam have been put in its place, so the name has become like this as a way of signifying Him. Th is is the teaching of [the eighth-century grammarian] Sibawayhi and the most profi cient grammarians.”Th at is the end of Abu Sahl’s words. In Sharh [al-talwih ‘ala] al-tawdih [by Sa‘d al-Din al-Taft azani] it is written, “‘Allah’ signifi es the essence that is worshipped in truth. It is said that it is a descriptive word derived from al-ilaha (divinity). It is also said (by others) that its root is laha, from the Syriac, and the fi nal alif was removed in its Arabization, and then alif and lam were put at the beginning.”Someone else said:Know that since rational minds are lost in the essence and attributes of God because they are veiled by the great lights and veils of omnipotence, likewise they are bewildered concerning the word “Allah” which signifi es this holy essence, because something of the rays of these lights touches it, so minds are bew i ldered when t hey tr y to comprehend it, just as t hey are dazed when t hey tr y to understand what is named by the word “Allah,” and they disagree with each other.

From the fi rst point of view, the elimination is exceptional because the vocalized hamza is ignored and the word is contracted, in conformity to the pattern that when two similar letters are next to each other, the fi rst one drops the vowel.

I translate sifat al-ma‘ani as “hypostatic attributes” to indicate the belief that the attributes are real “things” that exist in God (if they are attributes of essence) or are produced in Him (if they are attributes of act).

Th e Ash‘arites respond that things that have potential existence are receptive to existence without anything being added to them.S: Why do our companions in the east say that the attributes of God’s acts are temporally produced?T: Th ey argue that the Most High God never ceases to bring originated things into existence and to do acts according to His will at the time they occur (fi awqa-tiha), like creating, causing death, giving wealth, giving poverty, exalting some people, humbling others, and so on concerning all His acts which He brings into existence at the time they occur. He cannot be described as doing these acts from all eternity (fi ’l-azal), but only as doing an act at the time it occurs. So this attribute is originated (haditha) with the origination of the act.

Abi Zakariya, may God have mercy upon him. He took this question to Shaykh Abu Mas‘ud Sabir b. ‘Isa, may God have mercy on him. [Abu Mas‘ud] said:Concerning His attributes of act, it is impossible for Him to have had them from all eternity, because that would entail affi rming the eternity of creation. It is impossible for Him to have been worshipped from all eternity, or praised from all eternity, or remembered from all eternity, or that His help was sought from all eternity, because that entails affi rming the eternity of someone who remembered Him and worshipped Him and praised Him and sought His help. But it is permissible for you to say that from all eternity He is creator, provider, originator, bringing back to life, producing, giving generously, blessing, and other such similar expressions, of which there are many, provided there exists one of three stipulations: (1) that you complete your words by saying “He is 6. Th ese grammatical constructions work better in Arabic than in English. In Arabic the primary distinction between tenses is not between the past, present, and future, but between an act that is completed and one that is incomplete or continuous, including something that will happen in the future. Precisely the same grammatical construct can mean “I am praying” or “I will pray.” Al-Rawahi’s third example would almost certainly have to be rendered in English as “I will answer your question tomorrow.”"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"94 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-Wahbiyyacreator from all eternity of a creature that will be, and provider to something that will be, and originator and bringer back to life of something that will be originated and brought back to life”; this is one way; (2) that you mean by these words that He is able to produce a creature, something that will be provided for, a thing that will be originated, and a thing that will be brought back to life, because He is able from all eternity to do this; this is the second way; or (3) that by these words you mean the active participle (ism al-fa‘il) if it is indefi nite, because it is suitable to receive action and condition, as when God said, “He called you Muslims before” (Q 22:78)—and this occurs frequently in Arabic. Whoever says that God cannot be creator or provider from all eternity is an unfaithful hypocrite (kafi r nafi q), and whoever says He is not creator or pro-vider from all eternity is an unbeliever (mushrik).Th ese are the words of the scholar Abu ’l-Qasim of North Africa. Understand, and do not indiscriminately follow the sayings (ta’ dhukh athar) of the Muslims.S: Is it possible for Him to be Lord from all eternity if He wishes?T: It is possible for Him to be Lord from all eternity over something that He will bring into existence, and its coming into existence is contingent on His will, and what is meant (wa-’ l-murad) is that if He wishes He will bring creatures into being whose Lord He will be—that is, their master (sayyiduhum) or ruler (malikuhum) or benefactor (muslihuhum), according to one of the meanings by which His name “Lord” is interpreted. Th e meaning of the linkage (ta‘ liq) of His lordship with His will is from this perspective (min hadhihi ’ l-jiha). Were there no stipulation of will here, that would suggest (la-waqa‘a iham) something over whom He is Lord that is with Him from all eternity, which is impossible. As for calling Him “Lord” without any other considerations (bi-duna tadayuf) by ascribing lordship to Him (bi-ja‘ l al-rububiyya la-hu) in the sense that He alone deserves lordship, without anything sharing this honor (la sharika la-hu), and considering lordship to mean dominion, subjugation (al-qahr), exaltedness (al-‘uluww), vanquishing (al-ghalaba), majesty (al-‘azama), and conquest (al-isti’la’), He is deserving of these attributes by virtue of His essence from all eternity, with-out regard to any other considerations. From this perspective, it impossible to link an eternal attribute of His essence to His will, because none of the qualities of His majesty and none of the attributes of His perfection depends on His will. Only created things that depend on divine power are contingent on His will.

Is there a third cat-egory into which they are divided?T: Th e attributes of God are not confi ned to these two categories. Th ey are indeed divided into three categories from a third perspective, as some of our scholars in the east have done: attributes of essence, attributes of act, and an attribute that can be seen from one perspective as pertaining to the essence, and from another perspective as pertaining to the act. Th ose pertaining to the essence include any attribute whose opposite is excluded from God. Th e Glorious One is described by these from all eternity, and they are the seven attributes: life, knowledge, power, will, speech, hearing, and sight. Th e second category includes any attribute indicating the exclusion of its opposite from the Most High, and He is not described as doing them from all eternity, like creation, giving life, giv-ing death, love, hate, constricting (al-qabd), expanding (al-bast), friendship (al-walaya), and dissociation (al-bara’a). Th e third category is any attribute that can be understood in two diff erent senses, like His name “the Wise”: in the sense that it excludes folly (al-‘abath) from the Most High, it is one of the names of the attri-butes of essence; in the sense that He places things in their appropriate places, it is an attribute of act. Likewise, His name “Truthful”: in the sense that it denies that the Most High can tell a lie, truthfulness is an attribute of essence; in the sense that He informs truthfully, truthfulness here is an attribute of act. Likewise, the Most High’s name “Hearing,” in the sense that it excludes deafness from Him, it is an attribute of essence; in the sense that He receives prayers, it is an attribute of act. Likewise, the Most High’s name “the Subtle” (al-Latif):7 in the sense that He knows [all nuances], the Most High’s subtlety is an attribute of essence, but when it expresses His mercy, it is an attribute of act. And so on.Lesson 2: God’s Diff erence from Originated Th ingsS: What is the meaning of “He is a thing unlike other things” (shay’ la ka-’l-ashya’)?7. Al-Latif has sometimes been translated “the Kind,” and latif in its most common usage means “kind.” But it has many other meanings and implications.

According to the Ash‘arites, it is some-thing that exists, and according to them the nonexistent (al-ma‘ dum) is not a thing, whereas according to our school it is a nonexistent thing. Nonexistence (al-‘adam), according to us, is not a thing, so the Glorious One is a thing, because He exists, remains, and true things are spoken of Him, but He does not resemble any other thing, and nothing else resembles Him. He must be one (la-hu al-wahda) in His essence, attributes, acts, speech, and worship, and the Most High has no second [thing] (fa-la thani la-hu) in His essence. His essence is not composed of parts (la dhatuhu murakkaba min ajza’) and His attributes are not multiple but of a single kind (muta‘addada min jins wahid), and the Most High does not have a partner in any of His attributes or a partner who helps Him in any of His acts. His speech does not resemble the speech of creatures, and no other object of worship rightfully deserves to be worshipped alongside Him.S: How do we know the unity of His essence (wahdat dhatihi)?T: Th e unity of His essence in the sense of not being composed of parts is known from His diff erence from originated things.S: What is the attribute of essence that is necessary (al-sifa ’ l-nafsiyya ’l-wajiba)8 to God Most High?T: It is His necessary, essential existence that can never admit nonexistence, either in the eternal past or in the eternal future.

Th e Most High said, “Th ere is not a thing that does not glorify Him with praise” (Q 17:44).Th e meaning of things glorifying Him with praise is that whenever God brings a thing out of nonexistence, it is as if He says with the tongue of that thing, “I am exalted beyond all resemblance to this thing.” It is said that when God nullifi ed the words of those who called the angels daughters of God (Q 17:40), He declared that His essence transcended (nazzaha dhatahu ‘amma) what they attributed to Him by saying immediately aft erward, “Th e seven heavens and the earth and those in them declare His glory” (Q 17:44), as an indication that all beings indicate and witness to this transcendence, but the unbelievers do not understand their praise. Th e purpose of this is to rebuke them and chide them for saying that God has partners, although everything else exalts Him beyond all defi ciency. It is said that they praise God with the words “glory and praise be to God,” but only the perfect ones hear their praise, like the Prophet in whose hand stones and food praised God, and those Companions who were with him heard it (al-Bukhari n.d., no. 3579), and most of the pious ancestors agree that it is liter-ally true, that all things, whether animal or inanimate, praise God in words that can be heard. Some disagree and say that the glorifi cation of rational animals is in words and the glorifi cation of other animals and inanimate objects is in the language of their own condition, so that these creatures give evidence of a Maker, and of His power, kindness, and wisdom, as if they are speaking of that, and it attains the status of glorifi cation.Th e negative attributes of the Most High include His self-subsistence (qiyamuhu bi-nafsihi), meaning that the Most High has no need of anything for His essence and has no need of a cause besides Himself. It means that the Most High does not need an essence in which to subsist or an originator to bring Him into being, but the Most High is the one who brings all things into being, mean-ing all generated things (al-muwalladat). Th is requires that the Glorious One be an essence, not an attribute.

Abi Nabhan felt that whatever God knows must necessarily exist, either in the past, present, or future, so one cannot speak of God’s knowledge of contingencies—that is, knowing what would happen if something else happened, if indeed it does not happen. Nasir apparently thought he was unusually wise in his understanding of this question, and insulted his pupil, Sa‘id b. Khalfan al-Khalili (later to become even more famous than his teacher), who tried to challenge him on this topic; Nasir said it was a mystery entirely beyond Sa‘id’s ability to understand. Later, when Sa‘id was asked by a student about this, he did not hesitate to denounce this unusual teaching (S. al-Khalili 1986, 1:135–36). Indeed, Nasir appears to contradict the Qur’an, in its story of the “servant of God” whom Moses followed in Sura 18 (al-Kahf), who performed a number of seemingly meaningless or immoral acts in order to prevent a worse occurrence that God knew would otherwise happen.11. One of the important areas of contention between the Muslim philosophers al-Farabi (875–950) and Ibn Sina (980–1037) and theologians like Abu Hamid Muhammad b. Muhammad a l-Gha za li (1058–1111) concerned t he k nowledge of God. Th e Qur’an clearly states many times that God knows all things, even the grain in the ground, the fetus in the womb, and our own thoughts. Al-Farabi, faithful to Greek philosophical notions of knowledge that saw the objects of knowledge as making an impression on the intellect, said God could only know universals, not particulars, because if God knew particulars His mind would be subject to change. Ibn Sina tried to reconcile philosophical notions with the necessity of God’s knowledge of all things by saying that God does indeed know all particulars, but His knowledge of them is the same from all eternity and to all eternity. Using the example of a solar eclipse, he said that God knows from all eternity that a solar eclipse will occur at a particular time, but His knowledge of the eclipse at the time of its occurrence is no diff erent from His knowledge of it before it occurs or aft er it occurs. In his critique of the philosophers, Tahafut al-falasifa [Th e Incoherence of the Philosophers], al-Ghazali objected that if God’s knowledge remains the same, He could not hear the prayers of the faithful or respond to them.

Th is is the act of someone who is ignorant, lack-ing knowledge and wisdom, hesitant in His aff airs, and God is far exalted beyond what they say.12 If He knows beforehand that He will bring something into being, and that His will will specify its characteristics, it is impossible for God to con-tradict His knowledge; it is inevitable that the thing that has been specifi ed will come into existence at the time that He knew it would, whenever His will speci-fi es it to come into existence, and this rule applies to what He knew would not be.

It is not said that it attaches to impossible things, not because of any defi ciency in His power, but because His power does not attach to [an impossible thing] because of its impossibility.but that God is sitting on a throne above the heavens, because the Qur’an says so. Th eir denial that God is everywhere, however, appears to contradict the Qur’anic verse, “Wherever you turn, there is the face of God” (Q 2:115). Heresiographers like al-Shahrastani label as anthropomorphists some of the “extremist Shi‘a,” those among the “People of Hadith” who are “hashwiyya”—a contemptuous term that literally means those who are “stuff ed,” but is used of those who deny the use of reason and take reli-gious texts literally—and the followers of Hisham b. al-Hakam (al-Shahrastani 1923, 76–77). Madelung (1999a) argues that Hisham’s use of the word “body” did not imply crude anthropomorphism, but was based on the notion that only bodies have existence. In fact, he argues that he represented an antian-thropomorphic theological perspective among the Shi‘a, and that he could only have been accused of anthropomorphism from the vantage point of the Mu‘tazila. Some scholars took care to avoid anthro-pomorphism by saying that God has “a body unlike other bodies.”14. Th e idea that God is “with” His faithful servant, sitting with the one who remembers Him, and so on, is present in the Qur’an and even more in hadith qudsi, the divine sayings given not in the Qur’an but in Hadith. Sufi s cherish such notions, and al-Rawahi was very much a Sufi in his per-sonal spiritual orientation. Sufi s are oft en at pains to explain that the notion of “union with God” in no way implies a mingling of the eternal essence with the temporal—indeed, some have demystifi ed the concept altogether by saying that it means that God’s servant unites his will with the will of God."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"104 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-WahbiyyaS: Does His will attach itself to something He knows will not be?T: No, His will does not attach to it, because it is already abandoned (bi-matrukiha ’ l-sabiq), since He already knows that it will not be.S: Does anyone believe that potential existents are infl uenced by God (anna ’ l-mumkinat tanfa‘ il li-’ llah) without His choice (la bi-’khtiyarihi)?T: Indeed, a misguided, cursed, unbelieving sect believes this.

Th e Glorifi ed One prevails, chooses, and specifi es.15. Muslim philosophers like al-Farabi and Ibn Sina embraced Aristotelian notions of causa-tion and a Neoplatonic cosmology, in which God is the First Cause whose self-contemplation results in a series of causes that brings all things into being. Such a notion appears to remove all dimensions of will from the creation process. Ash‘arites, on the other hand, reject the notion of secondary cau-sation altogether, and see God as the immediate cause of everything that occurs: the creation of fi re is the act of God and the burning of a log that is in the fi re is a separate act of God. Th e fi re does not cause the burning of the wood, but God’s habit of causing the burning of objects aft er the creation of fi re leads people to suppose t here is causation.

Explain to me what this religion (din) is, both in terms of its meaning and what it entails according to the law.T: It is said that din (“religion”) means obedience and reward, and is used metaphorically to mean the law (al-Shari‘a). Religion also means a particular religious community (milla), but it is said that this is just an expression to mean obedience and being led by the law. Th e Most High said, “Religion with God is submission (islam)” (3:125),1 and “Who is better in religion than the one who submits his face to God while doing good?” (4:125), that is, in obedience, and “who are sincere in their religion with God” (4:146), that is, in their obedience. Th e Most High also said, “People of the Book, do not go to extremes in your reli-gion” (4:171), which is an exhortation to follow the religion of the Prophet, may 1. Some scholars have interpreted islam in this verse, as well as in 3:85, quoted below, not to mean the particular form of religious devotion brought by Muhammad, but submission to God in a broader sense (Esack 1997, 126–34)."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"106 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-WahbiyyaGod’s blessings and peace be upon him, which is the most moderate of religions, as the Most High said: “Likewise We have made you a median nation” (2:143) and “Th ere is no compulsion in religion” (2:256). It is said that this means obedience, which can only be real if it is sincere, and sincerity is not produced from compul-sion. It is said that this applies only to the People of the Book, who are charged with paying jizya.2 He also said, “Do they seek a religion other than the religion of God?” (3:83). Th at means Islam, because He says, “Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted of him” (3:85). On this the Most High also said, “It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth” (9:33) and “Th ey do not follow the true religion” (9:29), and “Who is better in religion than the one who submits his face to God while doing good?” (4:125) and “Why, then, if you are not obligated (madinin)” (56:86), that is, if you are not to be subject to reward or punishment. Th e one who is obligated is the individual (al-‘abd) and the community. Abu Zayd said, “It is from ‘he obligated’ [someone to do somet hing] (dayyana), and a person is obligated (yudan) if he is forced to do something displeasing to him (humila ‘ala makruh).” It is also said that it is from “I obligated him” (dintuhu), meaning I reward him for his obedience, and some have interpreted al-madina in this way. Th e upshot of all this is that the religion of God by which His servants worship Him is Islam.S: What are the roots of this religion?T: Th e roots of religion are three: faith (iman), submission (islam), and the Prophet’s example (al-sunna).S: What is the literal meaning of faith (iman)?T: It means believing, as indicated by God’s word, “You have no faith in us” (12:17), that is, “You do not believe us.”S: What does faith mean, according to the law?2. Modern-day Muslims generally embrace verse 2:256 as an indication of the tolerance of Islam, but, according to the twelft h-century exegete, al-Zamakhshari, “Some people say that this (verse) is abrogated through God’s words: ‘O Prophet, struggle with the unbelievers and hypocrites (munafi qun), and be harsh with them. Th eir refuge is Jahannam [hellfi re], an evil home-coming!’” (9:73, 66:9). Others say that [the prohibition against compulsion] refers especially to the People of the Book [the Jews and Christians], since they have been immunized themselves (from compulsion) through the payment of tribute (jizya)” (cited in Gätje 1976, 215–16)."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Roots of Religion • 107T: It means believing in the heart, affi rming with the tongue, and doing the pillars (tasdiq bi-’ l-jinan, wa-iqrar bi-’ l-lisan, wa-‘amal bi-’ l-arkan).S: What is the literal meaning of submission (islam)?T: It is like when you say, “I submitted something to someone” when you give it to him. From this also is derived the notion of handing over something (al-salam) in a sale.S: What is submission, according to the law?T: It is of two types. Th e fi rst is without faith, and it is verbal acknowledg-ment, by which a person’s life is spared and his possessions may not be plundered without due cause, whether or not he really believes. Th e second type is higher than faith; it is acknowledgment with the tongue, belief in the heart, faithfulness in deed, and yielding to God in all that He has decreed and determined. As it is said of God’s friend Abraham, peace be upon him, “When his Lord told him, ‘Submit,’ he said, ‘I submit to God, Lord of all being” (Q 2:131). And as God Most High said, “Religion with God is submission” (3:19).S: From what is the word iman (faith) derived?T: It is from t he verb amana, which is used in two ways. Th e fi rst is transitive; for example, amantuhu means “I have granted him safety,” and it is in this man-ner that God has the name mu’min (faithful, guarantor of security). Th e second way is intransitive, as when one says so-and-so amana, meaning he has become safe. Iman is derived from al-amn (safety); that is, whoever believes in God and His Messenger and believes the message to which he calls is safe from God’s pun-ishment and his soul is tranquil because of what he has believed and to which he has been led.S: In how many meanings is the word “faith” used?T: It is sometimes used as a name for the law brought by Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, as in God’s word, “Th e faithful and the Jews and the Sabaeans” (Q 5:69). Everyone who enters into His law and affi rms God and His messenger Muhammad is described by this faith. It is sometimes used by way of praise, and means the soul’s submission to the truth by way of belief. Th is is from the combination of three things: realization in the heart, affi rmation with the tongue, and acting according to it with the limbs. Th is is illustrated by God’s words, “Th ose who believe in God and His messengers, they are the truth-ful” (al-siddiqun) (57:19)."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"108 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-WahbiyyaS: Can each of these three things by itself also be described as faith?T: Yes, each of these—belief, the true word, and the righteous deed—is called faith. God Most High said, “God would never make your faith fruitless” (2:143), meaning your prayer. And he has placed modesty and removing harm among the branches of faith.S: Does our dear teacher have a textual support for that?T: Indeed, a textual support and an authentic root (asl asil)! It is related that [Muhammad], may God bless him and grant him peace, said, “Faith has seventy-odd (bid‘ wa-sab‘un) branches (shu‘ba), the best of which is to say ‘Th ere is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God.’ Th e least of them is to remove harm; and modesty is a branch of faith” (al-Suyuti 1981, no. 3096). He also said, “Th e best faith is that you know that God is with you wherever you are” (ibid., no. 1243). He also said, “Th e best faith is patience and forbearance” (ibid., no. 1244). He also said, “Th e best faith is that you love for the sake of God and hate for the sake of God and move your tongue in remembrance of God the Mighty and Majestic, and that you love for people what you love for yourself, and hate for them what you hate for yourself, and that you say something good or be silent” (ibid., no. 1245). He also said, “If your good deed pleases you and your bad deed displeases you, you are a believer” (ibid., no. 677). He also said, “One of the signs that a servant’s faith is complete is that he makes everything he says condi-tional upon God’s will” (ibid., no. 2486).3 He also said, “Faith is two parts: half is patience, and the other is gratitude” (ibid., no. 3106).S: I have learned that each of the characteristics of faith is faith, but what is the sum of complete faith that is useful both in this world and the next?T: It is related in a number of hadiths, the most famous and comprehensive of which are the following two. Th e fi rst is the Prophet’s words, “Whoever says ‘Th ere is no god but God,’ sincerely believing it in his heart, enters paradise.” He was asked, “How is it made sincere (ma ikhlasuha)?” He said, “Keep it from what God has prohibited” (al-Haythami 2001, 1:31, no. 18).

Abi Talib, who said, ‘I heard the Prophet, may God’s blessing and peace be upon him, say, “Faith is knowledge in the heart, affi rmation with the tongue, and doing with the limbs.”’” Ahmad b. Hanbal said, “If I recited such an isnad to a madman, he would be cured!”4 It is said that it was recited to an epileptic and he was cured.S: Th e Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, spoke truly when he said that faith is knowledge in the heart, words by the tongue, and knowledge of the pillars, but how can this hadith be reconciled with the one that says “Whoever says ‘Th ere is no god but God’ enters paradise” (al-Bukhari n.d., no. 5827)?T: Th at was said at the beginning of Islam, before the revelation of religious duties and command and prohibition. Otherwise, it depends on the stipulation of repentance. When the duties were revealed, they encompassed command and prohibition and the Qur’an’s promise [of reward] and threat [of punishment], and God required repentance from sins. At that point, “Th ere is no god but God” no longer suffi ced by itself, especially since he explained this hadith which we men-tioned earlier, which is the Prophet’s words, “Whoever says ‘Th ere is no god but God’ in sincerity from the heart enters paradise.” He was asked, “How is it made 4. ‘Ali b. Musa is ‘Ali al-Rida (d. 203/818), the eighth imam of the Twelver Shi‘a, and therefore a descendant of the Prophet. Although the Shi‘a especially venerate members of the Prophet’s family, and particularly the authorities in this isnad, who are the fi rst seven imams of the Twelver Shi‘a, nearly all Muslims give them special reverence, as indicated by the quote from Ahmad b. Hanbal, perhaps the premiere representative of the group that fi rst came to be identifi ed as Sunni (ahl al-sunna wa-’l-jama‘a). Although certain aspects of Sunni doctrine are clearly off ensive to Ibadis, Ibadi authors freely quote from Sunni authorities, especially the Hadith collections of al-Bukhari and Muslim, to support their own teachings.Th e story of the people of Nishapur begging ‘Ali b. Musa to relate a hadith is connected to a diff erent hadith in al-Munawi (1994, 2:15, no. 6047). Th is particular hadith is told by ‘Ali b. Musa, however (with the slight diff erence of “doing the pillars” instead of “doing with the limbs”), in Ibn Maja (2000, Introduction, bab 9, no. 68), where it is not Ibn Hanbal but Salih Abu ’l-Salt al-Harawi who says that if this isnad were recited to a madman he would be cured.

Likewise he said—may God bless him and grant him peace—“‘Th ere is no god but Allah’ is the key to paradise” (Al-Bukhari n.d., Kitab al-jana’iz [23], bab 1). Concerning this, al-Bukhari said when he was asked about it, “Indeed, but there is no key without teeth; if you have a key with teeth it will open for you, but without teeth, it will not.”5 Likewise, Abu Dharr said this concerning the hadith that says “even if he commits adultery and theft .” Th erefore, the meaning of faith according to our principles is: faith in God the Mighty and Majestic, with the tongue by affi rma-tion, in the heart by belief, and in the limbs by good works. Th e outcome is that the true believer is the one who fulfi lls all conditions of religion and the rules to be followed in this world, and affi rms his faith. It has already been stated that the one who affi rms without belief in his heart is an unbeliever in the eyes of God and in the eyes of those who become aware of his belief, and the one who affi rms the faith and believes in Islam and persists in committing sins is a hypocrite.

Th eir minor premise [that God exists] is evident. Concerning their major premise [that everything that exists can be seen], they say that we see that all things share the property of visibility, and the cause of their shared vis-ibility is that they exist, since existence is the common characteristic all existents share. Th us have they nullifi ed all possibilities other than existence as the cause of the visibility of things, without [seeing this as] hypocrisy or caprice!

What do you say to this: are not substance and acci-dent created, and is not createdness an attribute shared by both? Judgment must be made from a cause they have in common, and this must be either origina-tion or existence. Th e common cause cannot be origination, because of what you said before, so it must be existence. By such an argument, God must be created, though He is glorifi ed and exalted far above that! If this is false, then so is your proof based on your allegation of existence as the common cause [of visibility]. Furthermore, the sense of touch is shared by all the diff erent things that can be perceived by touch, though their qualities may diff er, such as height, shortness, heat, and cold, so perceptibility by touch is something they have in common among them. Th is argumentation can be carried to its logical conclusion that the Glorifi ed One is perceptible by touch, which obviously must be rejected.“By whatever path you pursue rational argument to affi rm the vision of the True Reality, you will be unsuccessful. If you pursued the matter with true insight and open-mindedness, you would realize that the concept of absolute divinity shared by the divine characteristics is a semantic expression, like the concepts of essentiality and reality, so vision cannot grasp it at all. His characteristics can only be remotely and dimly comprehended, but total and detailed comprehen-sion cannot be mastered. Degrees of totality vary in strength and weakness, and not every totality is a means to detailed knowledge of the elements of the thing that is comprehended and the conditions attached to it.”Th eir promotion of this imaginary argument comes to naught and ends up in smoke. Th is is why their theologians, like Abu Mansur al-Maturidi, confi ne themselves to textual proof, because they are incapable of producing rational proof; and al-Ghazali said that the major premise of their syllogistic reasoning is false.

An example of the use of nazar in the meaning of “expecting” or “waiting” (intizar) is in the saying, “Look to God and then to you”8—that is, “Await the bounty of God, then your own bounty.” As the poet said:Faces were looking (nazirat) on the day of BadrTo the All-Merciful to bring successAnd elsewhere:All creatures look to (yanzuruna) the Glorifi ed OneAs the pilgrims look to (nazara ’ l-hajij ila) the rising (tulu‘) of the new moon.98.

He said “looking toward Me” in the sense of waiting to see when their Lord would allow them to enter paradise. It is possible that what one of our opponents10 said is true, that ila here is the singular of ala’, meaning blessings (al-ni‘am)—that is, it is not a preposition indicating a purpose, but a noun meaning “blessing” which is the direct object of “looking.”11 Although this perspective was mentioned by the Qutb in Taysir al-tafsir (Atfayyish 1981), in Mufradat al-Qur’an al-Raghib said this is an inaccurate usage from the standpoint of rhetoric (ta‘assuf min hayth al-balagha), and that it is better to consider it a genitive construction—that is, it means “look-ing to the blessings of their Lord” or “[to] the mercy of their Lord” or that the eye looks at Him. It is possible that it originally meant “looking to the kindness (in‘am) of their Lord,” and that “looking” means “expecting,” for they do not hope for mercy from any but God, just as they do not worship any but Him.In our opinion, the best exegetical method (al-‘imad al-a‘zam) is that any deletion or metaphorical interpretation, even if it contradicts the original text, is better than the alternative, if the alternative leads to anthropomorphism or to anything else that contradicts the perfection of God and the qualities of His majesty.12 Th is preference and interpretation are appropriate because of the Most sunset on the plain of ‘Arafat seeking God’s forgiveness.

It also vitiates against excessively literal interpretations by means of a hadith in which the Prophet said, “Every word has two meanings [literally “aspects,” wajhan], so interpret speech according to its best meaning.” Th e text goes on to say that every word has an inner and outer aspect.

It is evident from revelation that the essential speech is unchanging.” We also do not concede (nusallim) the unchangeability of the essential speech.

He exclaimed, “Glory be to God! And where would I see Him?”—that is, how could I see Him? So he denied that God can be seen.If it is said that he was denying that God can be seen in this world [but not in the next], we say that what makes God transcendent (ma yajib tanzih Allah) in this world also necessarily makes Him so in the next. Th at is why the Messenger of God preceded his statement with an exclamation of God’s glory, as a sign that it is impossible for God to be seen, and that He is too exalted for that. If he was merely denying that God can be seen in this world, he would have replied that God’s vision is postponed for a time of His grace (li-waqt karamatihi), but instead he immediately opened his response to the questioner with a glorifi cation of God, to cut off all [such] aspirations, and [to indicate] that this is something no angel who is near to God or prophet sent by God would attempt, and nor would he, may God bless him and grant him peace, despite the greatness of his particularity (‘azamat khususiyyatihi), either in this world or the next.Th ey say that the verse not only proves that God can be seen, but that God must be seen, because He promised this to His friends.

Safwan]-like doctrines that impugn the essence and attributes of God. Th is verse, “Vision does not comprehend Him,” testifi es against you that you are blind and ignorant of the way to exalt your Lord, as there is no evidence of restriction on the absolute and comprehensive applicability of the text. No one will see Him at any time, whether in a vision of the senses or of the heart.You have no proof that comprehension of a thing is predicated on seeing it, or that seeing it yields knowledge of it from every aspect, or that comprehension is not linked to vision alone; or, if it is limited to a particular thing, it would not yield knowledge of it from every aspect—the Most High has excluded it from Himself. As for it being linked to vision alone, comprehension is not linked to it, for comprehension by itself is not what the verse is denying; rather, what is denied is comprehension linked to knowledge, because we say that the defi nite participle in the word “vision”23 indicates real vision (li-’l-haqiqa). So comprehension—that is, vision—is absolutely negated in any real sense (‘an haqiqat al-basar); any-thing that can be called true vision (al-basar al-haqiqi) cannot see God.Alternatively, by defi nition vision means true vision in the sense of all vision, and the negation is in that case comprehensive (kulliyya) but not applicable to all vision, meaning that it is generally withheld, although the denial is postponed [until the end of the verse]. Th is rhetorical style is frequent in the Qur’an, as when the Most High says, “Do not obey everyone who swears” (68:10) and “God does not love every arrogant person” (57:23), and so on.Th e reason for this is that the claim that it is possible to see God indicates some defi ciency in Him, because what can be seen has color and a body and inhabits a place (hall fi makan) and has width, because every body has width, composition, 22.

Because vision is neces-sarily accompanied by defi ciencies, the interpretation of the hadith, “You will see your Lord on the Day of Resurrection just as you see the full moon,” must be that you will ascertain (satuhaqqiquna) the reality of His existence, His promise [of salvation], and His threat [of punishment], and you will increase in certainty, as if you were unveiling the full moon.As you know, these are things the existence and description of which you defi nitely know, though you have not seen them or perceived them. If you saw them, you would necessarily have to describe them as being in a place and a direction and having a shape (takayyufi ha). So what they say is nullifi ed, because we know that He has no place, fi nite dimensions (hadd), or shape. You cannot say, “We will see Him without dimensions or place or shape,” because vision requires shape, fi nite dimensions, and place. Likewise, it is necessary to interpret “looking to their Lord” in the meaning I mentioned here, for seeing God—as is evident to anyone who is fair-minded and does not disdain his intellect—implies defi ciency in the Exalted and Most High, Who is necessarily absolutely perfect. So the Glorifi ed One’s exclusion of it concerning Himself is an exclusion of defi -ciency, just as the Most High has excluded all other defi ciencies from Himself.Th e impossibility (imtina‘) of describing a thing does not necessarily mean that it is impossible to mention its exclusion. For example, it is impossible for God to have a partner, and God the Majestic and Exalted and has excluded such a possibility. Just as His glory excludes His having a partner, so does His glory exclude His being seen; it cannot be said that He is not necessarily glorifi ed if an impediment prevents His being seen.If comprehension were linked only to vision, why is it expressly circum-scribed (li-ma khassahu bi-’ l-ihata) in the verse, although the hadith on this subject, the hadith of vision, must be given a nonliteral interpretation (yajibu ta’wiluhu), because otherwise it leads to an impossible conclusion?

It is unsound to take these two types of comprehension together in the sense of knowledge, because vision does not know anything, let alone . . . 25 Vision will not k now Him, just as it cannot be said that the one who comprehends (al-ha’it) does not know you, unless one has recourse to [the Prophet’s] words, “Th e knower is the heart, and the heart knows God.” Th e most obvious meaning of “Vision does not com-prehend Him” is that you cannot see Him. Granted, no one knows Him, which means that scholars do not know Him in a comprehensive manner (‘ilm al-ihata). Th ere is no harm in that, for the denial of seeing Him remains, derived from the exclusion of attributes of defi ciency from the Most High, as mentioned earlier. As al-Suddi said, “Vision can mean the vision of the eye or the vision of knowledge.”Th e mention of vision (al-absar) in His words “He comprehends all vision” is to emphasize the denial that the Most High can be seen, in that He compre-hends all seeing vision, but it does not comprehend Him. Its denial is further emphasized by His adding [at the end of the verse] “and He is the Subtle, the Awa re” (al-Latif al-Khabir). Subtlety (al-lutf) means fi neness (al-diqqa) and hid-denness (al-khafa’), meaning that He is beyond being seen by any vision (basarin ma) at any time (fi zamanin ma) and of any type (ru’yatin ma), whereas He has 24. Al-Rawahi had previously argued that “vision does not comprehend Him” in Q 6:103 means that creatures cannot see God. Now he wishes to clarify that “He comprehends all vision” in that same verse does not mean that God has eyesight, because God’s diff erence from created things and His freedom from the limitations of bodies mean that His comprehension of all vision can best be understood as His knowledge of all vision.25.

He cannot be seen, just as anything that has no density (al-kathafa) cannot be seen; just as you cannot see the wind, you cannot see the Most High, who is exalted far beyond all defi ciency and beyond being compared to wind or to any-thing else, and beyond being described as having density or real fi neness (litafa). His calling Himself “the Subtle” (al-Latif) refers to His saying “Vision does not comprehend Him,” because it is in the nature of a fi ne thing that is hidden from bodies not to be seen by vision, but God is exalted beyond all bodily subtlety. His calling Himself “the Aware” (al-Khabir) refers to His words “and He com-prehends all vision.” Indeed, how could One Who knows the subtleties of all t hings not comprehend t hem? It is sa id t hat t he mea ning of “t he Subt le” is t hat He knows obscure matters and precise meanings and truths and that His awareness is most complete.Vision (al-absar) belongs to the pupil of the eye or the whole eye. It is also possible that what is meant by “vision” is the light by which the eye sees, but which cannot be seen or ascertained by anyone, whereas God has complete knowledge of it in every aspect. Al-Latif is interpreted this way because of the context, which is the denial that the Glorifi ed One can be seen and the affi rmation that He com-prehends all others, in contrast with another possible meaning of al-Latif—that is, the One who is gracious to His creatures and removes harm from them so that they do not even know that they are receiving these gracious favors or that harm has been removed from them—indeed, they might imagine the opposite.

In Q 7:143 Moses asks God to show Himself to him so he might look upon Him (cf. Exo-dus 33:18–23). God replies, “You shall not see Me. But look upon the mountain; only if it remains fi rm upon its base shall you see Me.” But when God revealed Himself to the mountain it crumbled, and Moses fell into a swoon.

Th e farthest human knowledge can go by logical proofs is to know that the Glorifi ed One exists, is living, is knowing, is powerful, has a will, exists from all eternity, remains forever, has no body or accident, and so on for the rest of His attributes. If what they say about intellectual perception were pos-sible, it would also be possible to perceive Him with the fi ve senses, because they have made Him perceptible by two bodily senses: they say that one may hear His eternal, essential speech,32 but we do not, except in the sense that one must deny that He has any defect, and they say that He may be seen—which is what we are discussing—and the truth is that the Most High cannot be perceived by senses or by intellect—I mean that His essence is not intelligible.S: What is the correct response to what Sa‘d [al-Din al-Taft azani] said: “If the intellect is released from bondage and one does not judge it impossible to see God as long as he has no proofs against it, and the principle is that there are none, then the burden of proof is on whoever claims that it is impossible”?T: We reply to this, and to other such sayings that pass arbitrary judgment on the rules of logic, that the intellect cannot accept the possibility of seeing God, because one of the conditions of perceptibility is that the object of perception be in a place and direction and be in front of the viewer, and that the distance between it and the viewer be neither too near nor too far, and that the rays of the viewer’s eyes connect with the object of perception, and all of that, as we have already explained, is impossible concerning the Most High God.33S: I know, esteemed teacher, that they affi rm that God can be seen without direction or inhabiting (hulul) [a place] or being in front of the viewer or any dis-32.

Th e use of the word dana (He drew near)35 concerning the Most High does not mean that He adhered (yaltasiq) to anything, for adherence is an accident that characterizes bodies (‘arad min khususat al-ajsam), and our Lord is neither a body nor an accident. Nearness (dunuww) concerning Him is a metaphor implying the nearness of His mercy, knowledge, and power, and that each of these attributes surrounds all things. Th e Most High is not described by nearness in the sense of adherence to a thing (mulasaqat shay’) or contact with a thing (al-ittisal bi-shay’), nor when He is described as distant does this mean separation (al-infi sal), because con-tact and separation are accidents that require substances (jawahir), bodies, and things that have volume (al-mutahayyizat), and God is too majestic for that. It is possible that His nearness to His creatures can be interpreted as His being known 34. Q 50:16: “We [God] are nearer to him than his jugular vein.”35. Q 53:4–10 describes one of the Prophet Muhammad’s visions: “It is naught but revelation that is revealed; One Mighty in Power has taught him, the Lord of Strength. He rose to the highest horizon, then He drew near (dana).”"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Roots of Religion • 135by them by evidence (bi-’ l-dalil), but not with respect to the essence of the Most High, only with respect to His existence and His attributes. It is possible to inter-pret His distance from His creatures as His being imperceptible (ghayr mahsus) to them. In either case, the metaphor holds. When we say “He drew near” (dana), we mean that He is known by evidence, and when we say “He is far” (na’a), we mean that He cannot be perceived by the senses. It is possible to interpret (ta’wil) His nearness in the sense of the Most High’s nearness to the attributes of perfec-tion—divinity, lordship, and oneness—by which He is described, and to explain His distance as His distance from attributes of defi ciency, like origination and other attributes of creatures. What is meant by His nearness to the attributes of perfection is that He is worthy of them (ta’ahulluhu la-ha), and what is meant by His distance from the attributes of defi ciency is that He is not suited for them. Th e metaphor holds (al-majaz bi-halihi) because of the requirement that a thing be near that to which it is suited, and that it be far from that to which it is not suited, so the relationship is one of rhetorical necessity (al-luzum al-bayani), not rational or ordinary necessity. It is possible to interpret nearness as His nearness to His allies (awliya’ ihi) by making it easy for them to obey Him, and to interpret distance as His distance from His enemies by not making it easy for them to do this (bi-‘adam tawfi qihim la-ha). It is possible that nearness means His response to the prayer of one of His allies, and distance means that God is too exalted to respond to the petitions of His enemies. Th e Most High said, “If my servants ask about Me, I am near. [I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they might hear My call and believe in Me and be rightly guided]” (2:186).S: What is the meaning of the existence of the One Whose name is holy (taqaddas dhikruhu) in every place?3636.

He Whose majesty is glorious is not a thing like other things, and He is not subject to time or circumstances, because dependence on circumstances is one of the attributes of composite things and accidents. Th e Glorifi ed One’s existence in places is by bringing things into existence, originating them, having perfect knowledge of them, adding to them (al-ziyada fi -ha) or diminishing them (al-tanqis min-ha), maintaining their existence until their appointed terms are over, exterminating them at the times He has determined, witnessing them, and by the impossibil-ity of describing Him as absent from them. Th e Glorifi ed One, by virtue of His essence, is too great to have any need for them at all (ghani li-dhatihi ‘an al-ihtiyaj ilayha mutlaqan), whether by inhering (hulul), residing (qarar), attainment (tawassul), or by asking for help (isti‘ana), for these conditions and attributes belong to originated things and are impossible for the Eternal One (al-Qadim) Whose existence is necessary (al-wajib al-wujud) by virtue of His essence (li-dhatihi), may He be glorifi ed and exalted.

Th ey said, “We do not go beyond saying this; we do not interpret it or explain it, we merely confi ne ourselves to saying of Him what the text says.” Al-Ash‘ari said that God’s limbs are attributes subsisting in the essence of the Creator, without saying that God has a body.

Since it is impossible for Him to have a body or accident, He cannot have a direction. Th e philosophers agree with this. Th e Karramiyya and the Hashwiyya say that the Most High God is in the direction “above.” Th is is the teaching of Hisham b. al-Hakam,44 ‘Ali b. Mansur, Yunus b. ‘Abd al-Rahman, Hisham b. Salim al-Jawaliqi, and many of the People of Hadith. Muhammad b. al-Haysam, a theologian of the Karramiyya, taught that the Most High is an essence that exists alone, separate from (munfarida bi-nafsiha ‘an) all other existents and does not inhere in anything the way accidents do or mix with anything the way bodies do; that He is unlike (mubayin) creatures, but He is in a direction “above,” and between Him and the Th rone is an infi nite distance.

He said that when God commands or prohibits or wills something, His command, prohibition, and will come into existence aft er not having been, and they sub-sist in His essence, because His speech is heard from Him and likewise His will comes into existence from Him. He said, “Th e subsistence of originated things in His essence does not mean that He is originated, because origination means a succession of opposites (ta‘aqub al-addad) that cannot be impeded (la yasihh an yata’attal minha), whereas opposites cannot successively pass over the glori-fi ed Creator (al-Bari’ subhanahu la yata‘aqab ‘alayhi ’l-addad).” Abu ’l-Barakat al-Baghdadi wrote in his book, Al-Mu‘tabar, that originated things subsist in the essence of the glorifi ed Creator and that divinity cannot be affi rmed except by admitting this (la yasihh ithbat al-ilahiyya illa bi-dhalika). He said, “Th e theolo-gians say He is too transcendent for that, but it is necessary to transcend this tran-scendence (al-tanzih ‘an hadha ’l-tanzih huwa ’l-wajib).” Th is is kufr and apostasy (ilhad) concerning the essence of the glorifi ed Creator. Our companions and the Mu‘tazila and most theologians say that this is incorrect, and that it cannot be said of God Most High; rather, it is impossible according to both reason and revelation, 45.

Th e accountable person must know twenty such attributes, which are in four categories:(1) Th e fi rst category is the essential attribute (al-sifa ’l-nafsiyya), which is God’s essential existence (al-wujud al-dhati), expressed by His essential identity (al-huwiyya) and by the existence that is particular to the Most High (al-wujud al-khass bi-hi ta‘ala) in the sense of His existence by virtue of Himself (bi-ma‘na wujudihi li-dhatihi), not an existence that is caused (mu‘allalan) and dependent (mutawaqqifan) on any cause that would bring Him into being; His existence, may He be glorifi ed, does not admit nonexistence (la yaqbal al-‘adam), whether in the eternal past (azalan) or the eternal future (abadan). An essential attribute is an affi rmative attribute (al-sifa ’l-thubutiyya) that indicates a description of the very essence, without any additional qualifi cations, as when one describes a substance (jawhar) as a substance, an essence (dhat), a thing (shay’), or an existent (mawjud).(2) Th e second category are the negative attributes (al-sifat al-salbiyya), which are any attribute that implies the negation of something unsuited to the Most High. Th ey are:(a) existence from all eternity (al-qidam), which means that the exis-tence of God Most High is not preceded by nonexistence, because the Eternal One (al-Qadim) cannot have any beginning to His existence;(b) perpetuity (baqa’), which means that there can never be an end to His existence, because the proof of the necessity of His existence in the eter-nal past also proves that it can never come to an end;(c) diff erence from originated things (mukhalif li-’l-hawadith), whether they be before existence, like the things that have not existed from all eter-nity, or those that are attached to the blessings of the aft erlife; this diff erence implies the exclusion from the Most High of substance or accident or being described as entire (kulliyya) or being a part (juz’ iyya) or by qualities that are linked to such concepts;(d) self-subsistence (qiyam bi-’ l-nafs), meaning that the Most High does not need anything else for His existence, whether a locus (mahall) or a"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Roots of Religion • 143particularizing agent (mukhassis)—that is, something that would cause and necessitate His existence (al-mu’thir wa-’ l-mujib);(e) unity (wahdaniyya), meaning the unity of the essence and the attri-butes (wahdat al-dhat wa-’ l-sifat)—that is, the absence of an equal to Him in these two things (‘adam al-nazir la-hu fi -hima).

All these things that are named are the same, even if the expression diff ers.4. Th e fourth category consists of adjectival attributes (sifat ma‘nawiyya), that is, the names of the Most High that are linked to the aforementioned seven attributes: the Living (al-Hayy), the Knowing (al-‘Alim), the Powerful (al-Qadir), the Willing (al-Murid), the All-Hearing (al-Sami‘), the All-Seeing (al-Basir), and the Speaking (al-Mutakallim), splendid is His majesty (jalla jalaluhu).Every accountable person must know these twenty attributes and which of them attach to contingent things and which do not. Th e attribute of life and the negative attributes do not attach to anything at all. Th is is evident concern-ing the negative attributes; as for life, this is because it is an attribute entailing comprehension and issuance of act in the sense that it is a rational condition for them and without it these do not exist, though its existence does not necessitate their existence or nonexistence. Existence (wujud) and eternity (qidam) are like life, according to those who consider them essential attributes (sifat dhatiyya), although the predominant opinion is that God’s existence is the same as His essence and eternity is one of the negative attributes. Th e attributes that attach to contingent things are knowledge—because it implies an object of knowledge, whether that object of knowledge be necessary or possible, as knowledge is linked to both—and likewise hearing and vision, according to one opinion, and also speech. Knowledge implies (yaqtadi) an object of knowledge that is revealed by it; power implies an object of power that it brings into existence or into non-existence; will implies something the particularization of which is desired; speech inherently (li-dhatihi) implies a meaning that it indicates; hearing inher-ently implies something that is heard; and vision inherently implies something that is seen.

[Abu] ‘Ali b. Sina said that it is higher and nobler to prove His existence by existence itself because it does not need anything besides His essence. He supported this statement by citing a verse from the Glorious Book that indicates this: “We will show them Our signs in the horizons and in yourselves so the truth will be clear to them” (41:53). Ibn Sina said, “Th is is the way of some theologians (qawm min al-mutakallimin) and others who prove God’s existence through His acts. Th e rest of the verse says, ‘Is it not enough that your Lord is a witness over everything?’ Th is is the proof for those who know the truth (al-siddiqin), who seek their proof for Him in Him”47—that is, those who affi rm His Lordship through His existence alone, and whose proofs do not depend on His acts.S: I would like you to summarize what necessarily belongs to our glorifi ed Lord (ma yajib li-rabbina subhanahu), what is impossible for Him, and what is possible for Him, how splendid is His majesty.T: What is necessary for our Lord is whatever affi rms His perfection and the nonexistence of any defi ciency, which is impossible; examples of this are knowledge, power, and will.

What is possible concerning the Most High is anything the existence or nonexistence of which would not imply a defi ciency 47.

I seek your guidance to the path of the true creed concerning the names of God (asma’ Allah). Are they the same as He Himself (hal hiya huwa) or are they other than He? What is the truth of this matter?T: Th e community of Muhammad (al-umma) agrees (ijtama‘at ‘ala) that God exists from all eternity (lam yazal), and that His names are as mentioned in His Book: the All-Merciful (al-Rahman), the All-Compassionate (al-Rahim), the King (al-Malik), the Holy One (al-Quddus), the Lord of Peace (al-Salam), the Keeper of faith (al-Mu’min), the Watch-Keeper (al-Muhaymin), the All-Strong (al-‘Aziz), the Overpowering (al-Jabbar), the Self-Aware in His Greatness (al-Mutakabbir),48 as the Mighty and Majestic One informed us in His Book. Th ey agree that God is the Creator and all other things are created. Beyond this they disagree.Th e Mu‘tazila and the Nakitha, and those who agree with them, say that the names are expressions (alfaz) by which God informs about Himself, just as we refer to ourselves by our names. Th eir proof is that a name is an intelligible expression (al-lafz al-ma‘qul) in Arabic deriving from an act, and it is usually grammatically indefi nite (yajri ‘alayhi al-tanwin), like knower (‘alim), knowl-edgeable (‘allam), merciful (rahim), ever-merciful (rahim), and all-merciful (rah-man). No one can deny that this corresponds to the indefi nite active participle in Arabic, analogous to the words entering, leaving, rising, descending, and so on. Th ese groups confi ne themselves to saying that God’s names are these verbal expressions and they claim that God’s names are created. Th eir proof for this is the word of the Most High: “God has the most beautiful names” (7:180). Th ey say 48. When describing a person, mutakabbir means conceited, but no amount of pride is con-ceit when describing God. I have decided to follow Kenneth Cragg’s felicitous translation of this word (Cragg 1988, 87).

Whoever counts them (man ahsaha) enters Paradise” (al-Suyuti 1981, no. 2353). A sound mind knows that it is impossible for God to be counted, but the names can be counted, which indicates that they are just words used by human beings.Our companions and those who agree with us in the rest of Muhammad’s community say that the names of God are He Himself and not distinct from Him, but that their verbal expressions (al-alfaz) are the words and acts of those who name them. Th e expressions serve the meanings, and the name is what is called a meaning (ma‘nan), not the verbal expression heard in speech. Th e name is what is indicated by naming, and the verbal expression and the naming are the act of the speaker (al-lafi z) who names in order to indicate the name of the one who is named. Th e name does not derive from the verbal expression, but is indicated by the naming. If someone says “Zayd,” his speech is a naming (qawluhu tasmiya), and what is understood from it is a name, and the name is what is named in this case; the description (al-wasf) and the attribute (al-sifa) are tantamount to the name and the naming. Th e description is the speech of the one who describes, and the attribute is what is indicated by the description.Th e aforementioned Mu‘tazila and Nakitha equated the naming and the name, and the description and the attribute; by doing so, they committed a ter-rible blasphemy. Th ey said the Most High Creator in the eternal past had no attribute or name, because the name and the attribute are the speech of those who name Him and the verbal expressions of those who describe Him. Whoever claims that God did not have from all eternity the attribute of divinity as a mean-ing—though not as a verbal expression—has left the [true] religion and contra-dicted the consensus of the Muslims.No rational person doubts that someone’s “name” (ism), for example, Zayd—and by this we mean the letters hamza, sin, mim [i.e., the letters that make up the word “name” in Arabic] and other similar letters in whatever language is used—and the name that you say, for example, “Zayd,” which consists of the letters za’, ya’, dal, or the name “Bakr” which you say, which consists of the letters ba’, kaf, ra’, and other names [that may be said], is not the same as the one who is named."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Roots of Religion • 149How could the letters that are spoken be the same as the essence of the one who is signifi ed by them? Th e verbal expression is made up of distinct sounds that have no power and diff er among the diff erent nations and cities, and sometimes are multiple and other times just one.What is named is not like that. Th e verbal expression “name” (ism), which is the letters hamza, sin, and mim according to the language that is used, is not used to mean what is named. When God says, “Raise the name of your Lord in praise” (Q 87:1), this does not mean “raise the essence of your Lord in praise,” but “raise in praise the name itself that you speak.” Just as His essence and attributes are too exalted to have any defi ciencies, likewise the verbal expressions that are given to them are too exalted to be tainted by obscenities or bad manners. Th is is also true of the verbal expression of a name given for emphasis, such as “Raise the name of your Lord in praise,” or any allusion (kinaya) to the glorifi cation of the essence, such as “Peace be on the noble assembly and sublime presence (al-janab al-munif)” or “Peace be on your assembly” or “on your presence (‘ala hadratik).” Something may be added to any reference to what is named “your Lord.” When the Most High says, “What you worship other than Him are only names” (Q 12:40), it means “in your worship you did not reach an essence that deserves worship, only verbal expressions that have no essences to worship, because they are not fi t for that, as if they were nonexistent.” As for “He taught Adam all the names” (2:31), what is meant are the verbal expressions, not the things that are named, although aft er that He says, “Th en He showed them to the angels and said, ‘Tell me the names of these.’” Th e “them” in “He showed them” means the things that are named by saying their names and known by mentioning the names. Aft erward He indicates the things that are named by saying “these.”Furthermore, the words of the Most High, “Blessed be the name of your Lord” (55:78), do not constitute proof that the name is the same as the thing that is named, because blessing is used in the sense of having great stature, and just as a thing that is named can be described this way, so can the name. Although these interpretations (ta’wilat) contradict the literal meaning of the source (al-asl), to claim that the name means the same as what is named contradicts it even more. Some say that “name” means the verbal expression and the letters that constitute it, but it can also mean what is named, and to prove this they cite these verses from the Qur’an and say that “name” in these verses is used to signify what is named.

It has been reported that God has ninety-nine names, and there is no doubt that if what were meant by the verbal expression is what is named and signifi ed by it, that cannot be true in this case because of the impossibility of the unity of the signifi er and the signifi ed.If you say, “Zayd got up,” there is a word spelled za’, ya’, dal, and that is the signifying name (al-ism al-dall), and there is the signifi ed (al-madlul), which is the one (al-dhat) who is described as getting up, and that is the one who is named. If what is meant by the verbal expression are the letters, this still applies, for if you say “Zayd” is subject to grammatical declension (mu‘rab) or that it is in the nominative case (marfu‘), the word “Zayd” in your speech is a name and what is named by it is the verbal expression “Zayd” that you speak, for example, when you say, “Zayd got up.” But the phrase in this case does not transcend the rules pertaining to verbal expression without some indication.When we say, “Th e names and attributes of God are He Himself,” we mean that what is signifi ed by them is the glorifi ed and exalted Necessary Being; we do not mean that the names and attributes that we utter are God Himself—God forbid!—but that the meaning that is signifi ed by saying “Allah,” “the Creator,” “the Provider,” “the Knower,” “the Powerful,” and so on, is the Necessary Being. When we say that His attributes are He, such as “Creator,” “Provider,” “Knower,” and “Powerful,” we mean that they do not signify an essence or something added to God’s essence and inhering in it (halla fi -ha), because that would entail a mul-tiplicity of eternal beings (ta‘addud al-qudama’), and that His attributes are all to be categorized as attributes of essence and that He is a locus for them, which would also necessitate His being a locus for the attributes of act as well. We do not deny that “the Creator” signifi es His creating, “the Provider” signifi es His provision [for His creatures], “the Knower” His knowledge, and “the Powerful” His power, but all these verbal expressions signify the Necessary Being whose existence requires these attributes.Al-Ash‘ari said that the names of God are either His essence, like His name “Allah,” or are other than He, like “the Creator,” “the Provider,” and other attributes of act, and that this would mean that the meanings contained in their correspond-ing verbal nouns (ma‘aniha ’l-masdariyya), like creating and providing, are other"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Roots of Religion • 151than God, not that what is signifi ed by the verbal expression “the Creator” and “the Provider” is other than God; it is neither He nor other than He (imma la naf-suhu wa-la ghayruhu), like “the Knower,” “the Powerful,” and the other attributes of essence. Th at is, the meanings contained in the verbal nouns are neither He nor other than He. It is said that if someone says, “By God! (wa-’llah),” one understands this to be an oath, and if someone says, “In the name of God (bi-’smi ’llah),” one understands this to be an invocation of good fortune and blessing, because of their usage according to custom, and because the oath is in God [Himself ], not in His name “Allah,” which is a verbal expression. It is also said that what is expressed by “By His face (wa-wajhihi)” is other than God, but oaths cannot invoke anything but God. One can read about this in the books of rules about oaths in the Qur’an; “face” signifi es God’s essence and attribute, and so do the names.Some of the Hanafi s said that when one says “in the name of Allah” and means to swear by the name, it is an oath, whether what is meant by the name is what is named or whether “the name” was intended as something additional. Th ey say that if someone says “in Allah” (bi-’llah), there is no benefi t of gener-alization (al-ijmal) and specifi cation (al-tafsil); “in the name of Allah” is said to attain the point (tahsilan li-’ l-nukta) of generalization or specifi cation and to indicate a general invocation (al-ta‘mim), because blessing or help may be sought from all His names, for they may be invoked (yuqsad bi-ha) for blessing (al-tabarruk), help (al-isti‘ana), and other such things in view of their signifying a signifi er (bi-’‘tibar dalalatiha ‘ala ’l-dall).A name is generalized if it can refer to other than the Most High, but it is specifi ed in its attribution to God Most High if it is specifi cally meant to refer to His name. Generalization is also in the name if it can mean any one of the names of the Most High, and specifi cation is in its attribution to the name which is the verbal expression of majesty (lafz al-jalala), which is your saying “Allah.” Th e fi rst aspect applies if the intention in saying “Allah” is the Necessary Being, and the second applies if the intention is the verbal expression—that is, the name that is this verbal expression—in which case the attribution is for clarifi cation. What is meant may be God’s essence, in which case by the name you mean the One Who is named, according to the teaching of some. In that case when you say the word “Allah” you mean “the Compassionate, the Merciful,” two descriptions that refer to a name, not to “Allah,” except by way of exaggeration or common usage."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"152 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-WahbiyyaOne scholar allowed that what is meant by “the name” are the three names, “Allah,” “the Compassionate,” and “the Merciful,” because all three are intend-ed.49 So “the name” means three names, whether one means only these three names or other names as well and limits oneself to the three in order to make a point that required these three in particular.Th e benefi t of generalization and specifi cation is for the speaker to see the meaning in two diff erent forms, one that is ambiguous and the other clear; two types of knowledge are better than one, and by this the meaning is more fi rmly established in the soul, because God created our souls in such a way that if some-thing is mentioned in a veiled manner and then clarifi ed it has greater impact and the pleasure of knowing the meaning is perfected because of what had been left inexplicit, since pleasure is greater if something is obtained aft er it has been desired and sought.Furthermore, one does not say “in Allah” as an exaggerated form of glori-fi cation and courtesy, as when one says, “Peace be on your exalted assembly” or “on your noble presence” to mean “on you.” If what is intended by a name is the verbal expression and what is intended by “Allah” is the Necessary Being, then the addition of a name is really in order to immerse oneself in the meaning (li-’l-istighraq bi-ma‘na) of the defi nite article that is attached to all the names of the Most High, or to point to the whole contained in a single name (li-’ l-jins fi dimni fard)—not regarding Him (la min hayth huwa), as that cannot be said (idh la yumkin al-nutq), let alone come fi rst (fadlan ‘an an yaqa‘ ibtida’an).50 Th e dif-49.

In Arabic, the defi nite article (“the”) is attached to a single noun not only to specify a par-ticular person, place, or thing, but to create a generic noun. In contemporary English, we typically use the indefi nite plural to create a generic noun, as when we say “Women live longer than men.” Th e corresponding Arabic would literally read, “Th e woman lives longer than the man.” When the defi -nite article is attached to one of God’s names, however, it cannot refer to a generic, because God is unique. Some of His names can apply only to Him (the Creator, the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful, the All-Merciful), and others can be used by others without the defi nite article: we may describe someone as wise (hakim), but only God is Th e Wise (al-Hakim)."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Roots of Religion • 153ference is that immersion is a way to enter into each one of His names (madkhal li-kull fard min asma’ihi) at the level of saying them one by one. It is as if you are saying “in the name of the Necessary Being, the Compassionate, the Merciful” when you say “Allah” or “the Compassionate” or “the Merciful” or “the Giver” or “the Provider” or “the Helper,” and so on. It is better to say each name rather than referring to them all collectively (huwa awla min al-jins), because a holistic term (al-jins) does not benefi t a person with the same level of understanding. We said that it is not possible to utter a single name in which a holistic mean-ing is contained, because the reality [of the distinction between the names] is only conceived in the mind and has no objective reality (innama tutasawwar dhihnan la kharijan), and the intention here is to seek blessing by mentioning all the individual names. Th is blessing is obtained only by immersion [into the meaning of each one], not through a holistic term, even if we say that it is better to praise God with a more holistic term, because the goal of praise is to affi rm the particularities of His individual names, and the affi rmation of the whole is an affi rmation of [the particularities] by providing evidence (bi-tariq al-ihtijaj). [Th is is so] because, although it is true that some of the names of praise can be predicated of someone other than the Most High,51 the totality [of God’s quali-ties] is not indicated by [such a name], because the meaning contained in that individual [name] can also be said of someone else. Th e essence of praise (mahi-yyat al-hamd) is instantiated (tujad) in an individual name found in someone else, just as it is instantiated in what is affi rmed of the Most High. One cannot say, “Let’s make the intention of praise immersion by affi rming each individual name of praise one by one, since the affi rmation of individual attributes entails the affi rmation of the whole, because the whole in the sense of the essence (al-mahiyya) is actualized in the individual. So let it be actualized by immersion in each individual name of praise, because there is no basis for preferring to affi rm a specifi c individual name by affi rming the whole rather than affi rming the whole 51. Some of God’s names, like al-Hayy (“the Living”) or al-Qadir (“the Powerful”), are adjec-tives that can be used to describe other beings, though in a more limited way.

If what is meant by the name is something other than what is named, and if by saying “Allah” one means the verbal expression, then the addi-tion [of “the name” in “Praise the name of God”] is still rhetorical: “the name” means your saying “Allah.” If this is what is meant by “the All-Compassionate, the All-Merciful,” then the verbal expression in this regard is clearly intended for the same purpose. If what is meant by these two names [“the All-Compassionate” and “the All-Merciful”] is the Necessary Being to Whom mercy is ascribed, it is unclear how one can exchange what is signifi ed by the essence (al-dhat), which is the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate, for what is meant as a verbal expres-sion, which is your saying “Allah,” and how He would be qualifi ed by it (wa-kayf yun‘at bi-hi).Th e answer is that it is customary (dhalika istikhdam) to say the name of majesty [lafz al-jalala, i.e., “Allah”], meaning its letters with the pronoun restored to it (wa-urida bi-hi hurufuhu wa-u‘ ida ‘alayhi ’ l-damir),52 not in the sense of the verbal expression but to mean the essence, or that the dependence (isnad) of mercy on the pronoun of the name of majesty is a rational metaphor (majaz ‘aqli) for the dependence of what is signifi ed on the signifi er. Naming is the mention of the name and also designates (tutlaq) the application of a name to something (wad‘ al-ism li-shay’); so it is known by that designation, by making the verbal expression a signifi er of its meaning. So it is said, but it is a defi nition without fi rm boundaries, because it encompasses both the act [of naming] and the word 52. I am not sure what al-Rawahi means by the pronoun (damir) restored to the name Allah. Damir, usually translated as “pronoun,” is related to idmar, “concealment,” a term used by Arab grammarians when speaking about an unexpressed but existing grammatical element.

Our companions [the deceased Ibadi scholars], may God have mercy on them, affi rm affi liation and require it if there exists a condition that necessitates it, such as faithfulness in religion. Some of our theological oppo-nents do not require it at all, while others require it only with those individuals concerning whom there is an explicit text stating that such a person is among the people of paradise, without requiring it regarding other people.One of the indications of its necessity are the [Prophet’s] words, may God bless him and grant him peace: “Th e Muslim has the right to receive six courte-sies from his brother: that he give him the greeting of peace when he meets him, that he visit him when he is sick, that he accept his invitation, that he attend his funeral when he dies, that he bless him if he sneezes1 and that he wish for him whatever he likes for himself ” (al-Tirmidhi 2000, Kitab al-adab [39], no. 2955).Th e indications of the obligation to dissociate from some individuals are also indications of the obligation to affi liate with some individuals, and vice versa.

Th erefore, one says, “I recovered (bari’tu) from the sickness” and “I got rid (bari’tu) of someone” or “I got rid of him” (bari’tu min-hu or tabarra’tu min-hu). In general, the root meaning of bur’ is the release of something from something else, whether in the sense of recovery, as in “Th e sick person recovered from his illness and the debtor from his debt,” or in the sense of bringing something into being from something else, as in “God created (bara’a) Adam from clay.”5S: What does it mean according to God’s law?T: It is the opposite of walaya and what is meant by it. If you dissociate from someone, you distance yourself from him and are released from the rights that a believer owes to another believer, just as if you had a loan and are released from it.S: What makes dissociation obligatory?T: It is obligatory if someone commits grave sins, and persistence in minor sins is a grave sin (wa-min-hunna ’ l-israr).S: What are the aspects (wujuh) of persistence?T: Th ere are four aspects: (1) commission of a sin; (2) turning away from repentance; (3) believing the person will commit the sin again; and (4) believ-ing the person will not repent.

Th e Qutb says:Th e correct answer is the permissibility of applying [the notion of persevering in sin] to the commission of an error in a matter of faith, and by analogy (bi-’ l-qarina) to all other acts of obedience; it is as if you say that he persisted in [error in a matter of] faith or in recitation [of the Qur’an].

It is well known that the angels have no passions, but only long to worship God and take delight in that. Th ey do not delight in pleasant aromas, although the literal meaning of the hadith is that they do take pleasure in that; perhaps what is meant is that they dislike putrefaction, as pleasant aro-mas are compatible with its lack, not that they literally take pleasure in it. Th at is more appropriate than saying that although they do not take delight [in material things], one may make an exception concerning pleasant aromas (ibid., 34).7Anyone who does not know that our Prophet is human (adami) is an unbe-liever, not whoever does not know Adam—to say so goes against the consensus of our companions, because there is no proof (hujja) for this. If there is proof con-cerning the name of a prophet or an affi liate or someone who is praised for a par-ticular attribute, it is obligatory to affi liate with that person; our companions say that whoever does not affi liate with such a person is an unbeliever, although the Qutb said he is only an unbeliever if he denies [his or her worthiness] (Atfayyish 7. I do not know of a hadith that mentions the angels’ predilection for pleasant aromas, but Muslim has a number of hadiths indicating that people should not come to the mosques with the odor of garlic or onion on them; two of them say this is because “the angels are harmed by the same things as people” (Muslim 2000, Kitab al-masajid (5), bab 1, nos. 5 and 7; Muslim 1977, Kitab al-salat, ch. 211, nos. 1145 and 1147).

Ibadi teachings favor a rational approach to the spiritual realm and deny a literal interpretation of Qur’anic verses and hadiths that appear incompatible with reason. Rationally speaking, since the angels are made from light, one cannot say they have senses of the type possessed by those whose bodies are made of clay; so they cannot take delight in aromas, which would depend on the sense of smell."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"164 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-Wahbiyya1980a, 34).

Th is implies a rejection of the Christian belief in her divinity and an affi rma-tion of her servanthood (‘ubudiyya) [i.e., her humanity], because an indirect allu-sion to women is more courteous (al-kinaya ‘an al-nisa’ ajmal). If someone says, “Th at is like Mary,” the word “like” implies imaginary individuals (al-afrad al-dhihniyya), even if, in objective reality, there is none but Mary. Another example is if someone reads in the Qur’an about the Companions of the Cave (18:9–22) and those who were burned in the ditch (85:4), likewise it is obligatory for him to affi liate with them as a group (ijmalan). Or if he reads in it that a man from Pharaoh’s family hid his faith (40:28), it is obligatory for him to affi liate with that man without knowing his name. Likewise if he reads in it about a servant to whom God gave mercy from Him and knowledge from His presence (18:65), [it is obligatory for him to affi liate with him without knowing his name] unless a convincing proof is made concerning him, such as a proof that this servant is al-Khadir,8 in which case it is obligatory to affi liate with him by name (Atfayyish 1980a, 34).[Th is is also the case] if proof is given from an oral source (bi-’ l-sam‘), whether from the Qur’an or reliable reports [from the Prophet or his Compan-ions] (akhbar), and this proof rests on the testimony of two trustworthy persons, or one trustworthy person, or by many (tawatur)—there are diff erent opinions—and the tawatur is a report transmitted by a large group of people from one to the other in a continuous chain of people who could never agree on a falsehood, not a heresy (ilhad) or the propaganda of a particular sect (madhhab); it is a chain of three, four, fi ve, twelve, twenty, forty, or seventy, according to diff erent opinions. A person who is named in such a text [as one of the people of paradise] must either be kept (ma‘sum) from grave sins—which would mean he is an angel or a messenger of God—or from dying in a state of sin.

Some scholars say that such a person is considered an affi liate but is not seen as trustworthy, meaning that you should affi liate with him but not accept his testimony, because he is con-sidered an affi liate merely because he is a subject of a just imam, but such an affi li-ation is not adequate to make an individual just and worthy of giving testimony if he is not in and of himself trustworthy. Such people are included in the general affi liation because of their obedience to their imam, which is at root obedience to God and one of the religious obligations He imposes on His servants. For this reason they deserve this type of affi liation which resembles affi liation with a col-lectivity. Th ey say you may attest to the credibility of someone who is not in a state of affi liation, like someone who is a treasurer, and that it is also desirable to affi liate with an individual among them if only because of the clothes he wears, even if you know he has committed a minor sin, or a sin concerning which you do not know whether it is minor or grave, as long as you do not know him to have committed a grave sin. Th is rule applies both to the time of the imam and aft er his death. One may accept the testimony of that individual until he commits a grave sin; then, if he is asked to repent and does so, [continue in affi liation], and if he refuses, dissociate from him. Th at is the sound opinion, although the more common opinion is that if he is needed as a witness, it is not necessary to ask him to repent. Some say that one should only affi liate with him if one has witnessed his faithfulness, or if one is [reliably] informed of such (ibid., 35).S: Why are the imam’s supporters (jama‘a) called a bayda?9T: Th ey are called such (summiyat bi-bayda bi-fath al-ba’) in the name of the imam, because he is the bayda of the town, that is, the unique individual (wahi-duhu) to whom the people gather and whose word is accepted.

Another opinion is that one should suspend judgment concerning him if he con-verts at the hand of one of our theological opponents until one sees evidence of faithfulness in him. Th ere are various opinions on this matter (Atfayyish 1980a, 35–36).S: Should one affi liate with one of our theological opponents if he enters our sect?T: It is necessary to affi liate with him if he is merely following received teach-ing (muqallid) and can be excused (ghayr qati‘ li-’ l-‘udhr) [for hav ing been in t hat sect]. On the other hand, if he was a scholar who exercised his reason (mujtahid) and had no excuse [for belonging to that sect], one cannot affi liate with him until he repents from each heresy (bid‘a) he embraced, one by one, and confesses the sin in such heresies in the presence of all who knew of these heresies from him, 10.

Concerning the Prophet’s saying “May God have mercy on Abu Dharr,” this was aft er Abu Dharr sneezed, to which the appropriate response is “May God have mercy on you.” However, as Atfayyish and al-Rawahi indicate, the Prophet’s saying this aft er Abu Dharr sneezed does not make it an obligation to say it whenever a monotheist sneezes."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Affi liation and Dissociation • 169explicit text concerning them, or in the opposite case, [there is no obligation to dissociate] from specifi c individuals about whom there is no explicit text.17 Some say it is necessary [to affi liate with someone] if this person is said to be one of the people of paradise, as [for example] if [the Prophet] said, “God, have mercy on Zayd; he is one of the people of paradise.” Some say there is no obligation to affi liate with individuals concerning whom there is an explicit text [that they are among the people of paradise].

Some object to both these opinions, because affi liation is not subject to choice; rather, once it is established that a person deserves affi liation, it is immediately obligatory to affi liate with him unless there is evidence to the contrary."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"176 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-WahbiyyaA person should be granted affi liation if one is informed about him aft er questioning, just as in law the attestation of a person’s honor is rejected before it is requested but is accepted aft er it is requested, although in this case one may reject it if one is informed without asking, but it is not obligatory to do so. Some say the testimony of a single free person is adequate, whether that person is male or female, but there are diff erent opinions on that point.

We also affi liate with those who suspend judgment concerning them because they are unable to understand the truth, because it is obligatory for those who do not understand the truth to suspend judgment, unless it is clear that such a person is capriciously suspending judgment aft er coming to understand the truth. We do not suspend judgment concerning those who were aware of what ‘Uthman and ‘Ali were doing and were present at the time they were doing reprehensible things, unless he considered what was wrong to be right, or considered what was right to be wrong; that is not to be tolerated. Th e Companions are not like other people because the Prophet explicitly spoke well of them.26 One should not sus-pend judgment concerning them as one would concerning other people, such as 26.

Zayd—whoever fi ghts the leaders of deviance or defends the religion, unless there is proof otherwise. Th at is the correct opinion. Th e more commonly held opinion, taken from Abu Khazar, is that it is impermissible to be ignorant of them, and it is obligatory to affi liate with them and to affi liate with the leading scholars, although there is no proof (hujja) in the Qur’an or Sunna that this is a religious obligation that would remove all possibility of excuse or that there is no possibil-ity of disagreement on this. Th e truth lies in one of these opinions.Some scholars in our school say this concerning the leaders, that even if our colleagues are faithful [in other matters], if they dissociate from [the leaders], one cannot accept two words from them.28Perhaps what Abu Khazar meant—may God have mercy on him—are those of whom one cannot be ignorant, who are the fi rst scholars (mujtahidun) who defended the religion, like ‘Abdallah b. Abad, but knowing their names is not required in such a way as to take this as a proof.

What are its regulations for individuals (al-ashkhas) among us [Ibadis]?T: It is obligatory to dissociate from individuals among us if there is a cause (li-wujud ‘illa) that requires dissociation from a group (bara’at al-jumla), such as committing a grave sin, because of the words of ‘Umar b. al-Khattab and ‘Amr b. al-‘As, “We will dissociate from anyone we see doing evil,” which is also trans-mitted as a hadith. Th e obligation does not derive from God’s words, “Do not take the unbelievers [as affi liates instead of the believers]” (4:144), or “Do not affi liate with a people [with whom God is angry]” (60:13), or “Whoever affi li-ates with them [is one of them]” (5:51), because the prohibition of affi liation does not invariably imply dissociation, because there is an intermediary position: to suspend judgment. It is well-known that the prohibition of something is a com-mand to do its opposite, and vice versa, and what is meant by its opposite is what contradicts it. Th is applies when the opposite can mean only one thing, as is the case with movement and rest. Neither does proof lie in the Prophet’s dissociation [of people], because not everything he did is obligatory; it is only obligatory if he commanded it (Atfayyish 1980a, 45).29. Cf. Atfayyish (1980a, 44). It is strange to say that it is not necessary to know the lead-ing Ibadis but it is necessary to know their theological opponents. He probably means that it is important to know that there are people who oppose Ibadi doctrine and that any such opposition is religiously prohibited, even if one does not know any specifi cs.30. Although la‘n can mean “curse,” al-Salimi explicitly prohibits cursing (shatm) those who go astray (A. al-Salimi 2003, 28). As we shall see, al-Rawahi says that courtesy should continue to be observed with those from whom one has dissociated. Use of the term la‘n may have prompted Sunnis in Zanzibar to say that the Ibadis curse the Prophet’s Companions, an accusation strongly rebutted by ‘Ali b. Muhammad b. ‘Ali al-Mundhiri (1866–1925), an Ibadi scholar and judge in Zanzibar (al-Mundhiri 1980, 21–22)."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Affi liation and Dissociation • 179S: I know that it is obligatory to dissociate from individuals if there is a cause that requires dissociation from a group. Please explain dissociation from a cat-egory and the regulations attached to it.T: Dissociation from a group is comparable to affi liation with a group. It is obligatory to dissociate from unbelievers as a group. Anyone who dissociates from all people or affi liates with all people, or who treats one group of affi liates diff erently from others, or who dissociates from [everyone who belongs to a type of being], such as all jinn or people or angels, or who is unaware that God has commanded affi liation with the group or dissociation from it or that there is reward for doing this, is an unbeliever—unless we are speaking of someone con-cerning whom it is permissible to be unaware until one has proof. Dissociation from a group is only obligatory if there is infi delity (kufr), for wherever infi delity is found, dissociation is obligatory, and likewise affi liation [is obligatory if there is no infi delity]. Someone who is not subject to dissociation but then does some-thing requiring dissociation of anyone who does such a thing becomes subject to dissociation, because God’s judgment is the same whether it concerns a group or an individual.Just as we are obligated to dissociate from a particular individual or group, we are obligated to dissociate from those about whom there is an explicit text if there is proof of the necessity of dissociation from them. Th e Qur’an speci-fi es types (anwa‘) like the people of Noah,31 individuals like Pharoah,32 Goliath (Q 2:249–51), and Abu Lahab,33 groups like those who spread the lie (‘usbat al-ifk ),34 and individuals who are not mentioned by name, such as the king who seized every boat (18:79) or the one who disputed with Abraham (2:258), or like 31.

Otherwise, one should not mention him except with what is said about him in the Qur’an, the knowledge of which leads to this obligation. It is not permissible to dissociate from someone mentioned in a text by name if it is not explicitly given in the text, because perhaps that is not the person’s name. Some say the testimony of one or two trustworthy witnesses is enough to specify the person’s name—there are diff erences of opinion on this (Atfayyish 1980a, 45–46).S: What should I do if the imam is unjust, and among his subjects are some who follow him and others who abstain from fi ghting for him (al-qa‘id ‘anhu)?T: Dissociate from [the imam] and from those who follow him and oppose you—they are to be blamed.

Nothing explicit is said in the Qur’an about Noah’s wife, but when Noah cried to God because his son was among those who were drowning in the fl ood (11:45), God replied that the young man was “not from your family; he is [from] an unrighteous deed” (11:46). Most exegetes have understood from this that Noah’s wife committed adultery, from which the boy was born.36. Th e Qur’an says that when God destroyed Lot’s city because of their sins and failure to repent, “We delivered him and his followers, except his wife; We decreed that she be among those left behind” (27:57). In the story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19, the angels warned Lot and his family not to look back at t he cities as t hey fl ed, but Lot’s wife looked back and became a pillar of salt (Gen. 19:26).

Hadith commands in general that he be killed,37 but ‘Umar b. al-Khattab, may God be pleased with him, stipulated that he should not be killed until he has been called on to repent for a period of three days; then, if he does not repent, he is killed (Atfayyish 1980a, 46).S: Why did ‘Umar make this stipulation, when the hadith requires killing him without [stipulating that he should be] called to repent?T: Do you doubt ‘Umar’s expertise in the Sunna and his regard for Islam? By God, ‘Umar was uniquely endowed by God, along with Abu Bakr! ‘Umar was one of God’s great gift s to the community—anything he and his companion said or did was a sunna from the Messenger of God, on whom be God’s bless-ing and peace, taken from him and clarifying his words or a matter brought for judgment, either something suggested to them or an understanding from them, because the Prophet said, “Follow the two caliphs who come aft er me, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.”38Th ere is nothing in his saying “Kill whoever changes his religion” that pre-vents calling on him to repent, even if he did not say this; perhaps the apostate will be reminded of his faith or become afraid. Th ere is no harm in waiting three days to call him to repentance before executing the penalty against him; rather, it is a precaution to be certain of his apostasy, to remove any hesitation he might have had to repent and submit to Islam, or to confi rm his unbelief. Perhaps dur-ing the days that he is called to repent he might be admonished, and [God’s] kindness might reach him. On the whole, there is nothing in calling a person to repent that contradicts the intention of the hadith or subverts it.37. According to a hadith (al-Bukhari n.d., Kitab al-diyyat [87], bab 6, no. 6878), “Th e blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but God and that I am His Messenger cannot be shed except in three cases: in retaliation for murder; a married person who commits adultery; and someone who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims.” For a discussion of apostasy and its punishment in Islam, see Heff ening 1999.

Th ere are also two diff erent opinions as to whether one may enslave his off spring up to the fourth or third generation. Some of our companions interpret the third generation to mean the apostate’s grandson. Th e Qutb said, “Th is is not explicit” (Atfayyish 1980a, 47).An apostate’s child is one of the orphans of the Muslims, and some say so is the apostate’s grandchild. [An apostate’s] grown son should be killed if he declines to embrace Islam, and his wealth belongs to the people of the religion he embraced and should be distributed by the imam or his representative among them, according to what seems best to him in the country in which he resides fi rst of all, whether or not he is killed. Apostasy is like death.39 Some say his wealth should be given to his Muslim heirs, whether children or adults, but that is a weak opinion, because a Muslim may not inherit from an unbeliever, and an unbeliever may not inherit from a Muslim. Th e holder of this opinion would have to prove that they are more deserving of it, following the model of the estate of an unbelieving Muslim or his possessions in the Abode of Islam, even if he is still living.

His turning his bad deeds into good deeds might mean that he gives him the power to do good deeds aft er his repentance (ibid.).S: Must the hypocrite who repents redo the good deeds that he did during his persistence in hypocrisy?T: No, there is consensus that he need not redo them, but they are counted as a loss, and he is deprived of the reward for those deeds.

Th e rules of ritual purity in Islamic law distinguish between greater impurities (najas, literally “fi lth”) and lesser impurities (hadath, “something which occurs”). Hadath requires ritual ablutions (wudu’) before one may prayer, but najas requires a f u l l body bat h (ghusl). All Islamic legal schools consider seminal emission and menstrual blood to be a source of greater impurity. Some schools also feel that anything touched by a dog is najis, and there are other sources of najas as well.41. See Chelhod 1999.

Some claim that al-Jann is a righteous man and is their fatherS: If someone says that Iblis is an angel, is he an unbeliever?T: Yes, it is said that he is an unbeliever, but the Qutb, may God have mercy on him, explicitly says that he is not an unbeliever, because one could interpret God’s words, “All the angels prostrated except Iblis” (38:73–74) to mean that the exception is linked with the fact that he was one of them, or it could mean sim-ply that the cursed one was a single jinni among a number of angels that did not include him, but he happened to be among them and was included in God’s words, “So they prostrated,” and then was excepted as if he were one of them.45 It is also possible that the exception is what separates him from them, and that he—may God curse him—is not an angel who went bad, but that he is of a diff er-ent species who are the jinn, and then he deviated from his Lord’s command, and before he went astray he used to worship in the angels’ courts and wherever he liked, until the misery ordained for him caught up with him—we seek refuge in God from such a thing!—and he entered the rank of infi delity in such a way that he became chief of those who will be miserable. Oh God, by your honor, do not expel us from the circle of your mercy, in this world or the next!Whether the exception [of “except Iblis”] separates him from them or includes him among them, there is no harm in saying that whoever says that Iblis is one of the angels is an unbeliever, because angels are immune from disobedi-ence to God: “Th ey do not disobey God’s commands and they do what they are 45. Q 2:34, 7:11, 17:61, 18:50, and 20:116 say that when God commanded the angels to bow before Adam, “they all bowed except Iblis,” which would lead one to think he was an angel, but 18:50 also says, “He was one of the jinn, so he transgressed the commandment of his Lord.”"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Affi liation and Dissociation • 189ordered to do” (66:6),46 because if he were really one of them he would not have disobeyed God when He commanded him and he would have done what he had been commanded, as they did.

Iblis was among those commanded, as indicated by God’s words, “What kept you from prostrating when I commanded you?” (7:12), and He did not separate His command to him from His command to the angels, which [arguably] means He knew that he was one of them, and that the excep-tion indicates that he was among them and was responsible to do what they were responsible to do, but he declined and waxed proud and disobeyed the blessed and Most High God, who became angry with him and cursed him and trans-formed him into an accursed demon. So when the Most High says in Surat al-Kahf, “except Iblis, who was one of the jinn” (18:50), this means that he became one of the jinn, just as when He said, “He was one of the unbelievers” it meant that he became one of the unbelievers.Some might ask how Iblis could be an angel when angels do not procreate, because procreation is between a male and a female, and there are no females among the angels, as indicated by God’s denial addressed to those who judged them to be females, and the negation of femaleness implies the negation of pro-creation, whereas Iblis has so many off spring! Th e Qur’an clearly states that he has off spring (18:50), so how could he be an angel when angels do not have off spring? One might reply that he only came to procreate and have off spring aft er he was transformed and his form changed to that of someone who procreates, and all the transformations did not last more than three days, aft er which he could no longer 46.

Some say that the angels who were commanded to prostrate were just one set, the guardians of the jinn, and were called al-jann, and that God sent them to earth to drive the jinn from the earth into the oceans, islands, and mountains.47 Th e Qutb, may God have mercy on him, wrote: “Th is is not true, nor is it true that Iblis was an angel among them. Th e closest thing to that is that he was born from jinn who lived before him, and they are not angels, and the angels fought them and imprisoned him, so he worshipped with the angels. Th e commonly held doctrine is that he was the fi rst of the jinn. It is said that these were angels of the earth, because the matter had to do with the rule of the earth.” He also said, “Anyone who says that the angels of the earth can disobey God like the children of Adam is wrong” (Atfayyish 1981, 7:367).Th e correct opinion is that the command was addressed to all the angels, as indicated by the emphatically inclusive language in God’s words, “So the angels prostrated, all of them” (kulluhum ajma‘un, 38:73), and that the exception of Iblis among them is an exception symbolically linking him to them because he was among them, worshipping as they were, so it came to be as if he were one of them and was called “angel” as a borrowed fi gure of speech (majazan bi-’l-isti‘ara).It is also possible that the exception is unlinked. Some of our companions say that anyone who claims that Iblis is one of the angels is an unbeliever because God the majestic and glorious said, “He was one of the jinn.” Th e Qutb said:He is not an unbeliever, because it is a [possible] interpretation of the exception, because exception contains a principle of linkage, and he interpreted God’s words, “He was one of the jinn,” to mean that he was one of them in doing evil deeds and in belief and speech, but that he was one of the angels in origin, body and type, just as when we say “‘Amr is a demon” or “he is an animal.” So when he says, “Iblis is God’s enemy and is one of the angels, but he acted corruptly like the jinn,” the discussion with whoever says this turns on the immunity of 47.

Th e truth is that they are immune from sin, because the Most High said, “Th ey act according to His command” (21:27),48 i.e. they do nothing that He does not command. He is not one of the angels, because God’s words, “He was one of the jinn,” obviously mean that he is one of them, and that his lin-eage lies among them. Th at is what the words say and that is their most obvious meaning, whereas the previously mentioned interpretation interprets this as a metaphor and is contrary to the obvious meaning, and metaphorical interpre-tation should not be adopted without clear similarity (bi-la qarina).Our people (qawmuna) claim that Ibn ‘Abbas reported that one group (qawm)49 of angels procreated and were called jinn, and Iblis was among them. Our companions say that anyone who says that the angels are male or female is an unbeliever, as is anyone who says that they procreate. Some say such a per-son is not an unbeliever if he says this about individuals among them or a type among them, only if he says this of all of them, because a person who says this [about some of them] is interpreting the words of Ibn ‘Abbas that they claim are from him. A person can only be called an unbeliever for saying this only about individuals among them or a group among them if he is obstinately contradict-ing the Qur’an or is ignorant, not if he is basing his interpretation on what was transmitted from Ibn ‘Abbas. Likewise, an accusation of unbelief against some-one who says that Iblis was one of the angels applies only to someone who is ignorant or who obstinately contradicts the Qur’an, not to someone who relies on what is transmitted from Ibn ‘Abbas, for example.Likewise, concerning the immunity of the angels from sin, one may say that not all the angels are immune from sin, but most of them are, just as most humans are not immune from sin, but a few of them are. It is possible that the jinn were ordered to prostrate just as the angels were, and that this is omitted in the text, so that it should be read as “When we ordered the angels and the jinn to prostrate before Adam, they prostrated,” meaning that the angels and the jinn all prostrated except Iblis, in which case the exception would be linked [to the group].If you say, “How could the jinn prostrate, when they are evil?”, I would say that the believers among them prostrated in obedience and sincerity, and the 48.

(Atfayyish 1980b, 1:451–52)If you would like to know more about this, read the Qutb’s commentaries, in which there is healing and guidance.S: What is the meaning of the saying “Affi liating with our imams means dis-sociation from the imams of others,” and vice versa, that dissociation from the latter means affi liation with our imams?T: Why is that confusing to you? If you affi liate with the imams of our mis-sion (da‘watina), which calls people to the straight path, that affi liation implies dissociation from imams of those who oppose the [true] religion and call people to deviance and heresy; and vice versa, if you dissociate from the imams of devi-ance because of their opposition to the Muslims, you affi liate with the imams of the Muslims. You can also say it the other way around, that affi liating with the imams of deviance implies dissociation from the imams of guidance, even if one affi liates with both, because if one deems the deviants to be correct in spite of their deviance, then one deems the imams of guidance to be wrong in deeming the deviant to be deviant, despite their guidance. To say that the deviant is cor-rect, and to fi nd error in the one who is guided because he deems him deviant, is the essence of dissociation from the one who is guided.Although it is a good deed to affi liate with the affi liates of God, the sin of affi liating with God’s enemies while affi liating with His affi liates is greater and overwhelms the good deed, so this good deed is lost, as if it never happened. It is void, as if it had never existed; it is not considered and it receives no reward and has no good in it. Th ere is no way out of it by playing around with the religion and mocking the most important pillars of faith. One cannot say, “Good deeds take away bad deeds” (11:114), because we say good deeds take away bad deeds only if they are practiced continuously, with repentance; they cannot be considered and have no power in removing bad deeds without repentance.

Th is is one of the blessings of the all-merciful Forgiver (al-Tawwab), that He has made good deeds take away minor sins if the one who commits a minor sin forgets to repent, not by way of persisting in committing it, because persistence turns it into a grave sin. If someone forgets to repent and persists in committing a minor sin, or if he commits a sin that is grave from the outset, it is not in God’s religion that a good deed can remove it—it remains as it is without true repentance, and its removal is made sure by following repentance with good deeds. Th is is the truth, so rely on it, even if there are sayings in Ibadi books like Al-Diya’ (al-‘Awtabi 1990–1993) and Al-Taj (a l-Th amini 2000) that say that [God] counts good deeds more than bad deeds, such as “Anyone who does a good deed erases the bad deed that follows it,” and “If he repents, the reward of his good deed is restored to him,” and “Whatever comes last is counted, whether good or evil.” Th e sayings of the Muslims are the truth.S: If someone calls himself an enemy of God from whom one must dissoci-ate, or if someone else calls him that and he is pleased with that, and he is mature and rational, or if someone else like his son is called this and another person dissociates from him because he thinks he is indeed an enemy of God and he is a contemporary of that person and is in his company, is he unjust to him by dis-sociating from him?T: Some say that he is not unjust to him, because he has allowed dissociation from himself by calling himself this, and anyone subjected to dissociation aft er exposing himself to dissociation is not treated unjustly by that dissociation. Th e correct opinion is the one on which the Qutb relies, which is that he is unjust by dissociating from him because he did not investigate the matter but acted in haste and neglected [the duty of investigation], but the person treated this way receives no reward for the injustice he has suff ered, because he opened himself to suspicion.

How can one keep from shift ing from affi liation or dissociation to suspending judgment, and thereby oppose a matter on which the scholars have consensus, that the door of repentance is always open?

Th e reason for dissociating from him is because he intended to commit an act of infi delity, as some have said concerning someone who says that water or saliva is wine, and then drinks it. Th e second opinion is that one should not dis-sociate from him if it is clear that the deed is not infi delity (ibid., 53–54).S: If I learn from a scholar that a certain deed requires dissociation from the one who does it, or if he judges that a person who does such a deed must be punished by a particular hadd penalty or executed, and then I see someone doing it, how should I treat him?T: Act according to what you learned from the scholar. If the deed precedes your learning about its status from the scholar, do not pass judgment on him without the testimony of two trustworthy men, because in that case they are wit-nesses of it; or you may judge according to what you learned from a single scholar, if you ask him about it aft er the deed was done—there are two opinions (ibid., 54).Lesson 3: General Questions Related to Affi liation and DissociationS: What is the meaning of God’s affi liation to and enmity for people [literally, “His servants”]?T: His affi liation is His pleasure, and His enmity is His wrath, which means His punishment and His reward, or His knowledge of what reward and punish-ment are required. It can also mean His helping (tawfi q) or not helping people toward obedience, or preparing reward or punishment. Th e most correct inter-pretation is that it is His helping people toward obedience, or His abandoning them—we seek refuge in God from His enmity! Th ere are various opinions."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Affi liation and Dissociation • 201S: Are the two [God’s affi liation and enmity] reversible?T: No, they are not reversible. Th e person who [will be] happy [in the aft er-life] is God’s affi liate, even while committing a sin, and the person who [will be] miserable [in the aft erlife] is God’s enemy, even while obeying Him.S: Does anyone say they are reversible?T: Th e Nukkar and [their leader, Ahmad] b. al-Husayn, said so—may God keep them far from us!S: What made them say something so repulsive?T: What mishap could be greater than whatever made them say this, and what disaster could be greater than the one that ensnared them! Th eir doctrine required them to say that the Exalted One, Whose majesty is glorious, is igno-rant, because they said that, on the one hand, He is ignorant of what happens until it happens, and, on the other hand, they say that His knowledge is contrary to what His knowledge has ordained! Th at is folly and well outside the bounds of the wisdom of the Most High, Who is full of majesty and glory and is the wisest of all—He is exalted far beyond such nonsense! Th e glorious God knows what has been and what will be. One cannot say that God knows what has not been and what will not be, but neither can one say that He is ignorant of it; it is possible to say that if it existed He would know it, or that it would come into existence because of His knowledge.S: May God be pleased with you! You have guided me to what is brighter than the sun! So what does it mean for us to affi liate with our Most High Lord?T: We a ffi liate with our Most High Lord by following His commandments and keeping away from what He has prohibited.S: What right does an affi liate have from the one who affi liates with him?T: He must love him and love for him what he loves for himself, hate for him what is hateful to himself, and honor him and help him.S: And the opposite holds for the person from whom one is dissociated?T: Indeed, it does. Th e one who deserves dissociation is hated and despised because of his enmity to God and his sin.S: What prayers should be said for one’s affi liate, and what prayers does the enemy deserve?T: Pray for good for your affi liate, in this world and the next.

Is that so?T: What you are thinking is undoubtedly correct.S: If someone addresses another person as “Muslim” or “righteous one” or “pious one” or similar phrases, or says to him, “You are one of the inhabitants of paradise,” do these phrases and their like indicate affi liation?T: Th ese phrases do indicate affi liation, but they are not enough for affi lia-tion, because they contain no prayer—even if one says, “May God give you long life,” it is only affi liation if one adds “in paradise.” Likewise, if someone says, “May God reward you,” that is not affi liation until he adds “with the reward of those who do good.” Some of the prayers that indicate affi liation are “May God widen your grave and make it illuminated and cool” and “May God make death easy for you”—although on this there are two opinions; some object that God might make death easy for an infi del as a reward for what good he has done in this world, so he might arrive at the aft erlife without any good deeds to his account, and the believer may suff er at death in order to arrive at the aft erlife without sin. Th e death of a believer or anyone else might be quick, but he might suff er more in that brief time than someone else who takes a long time to die. Th ere are two opinions on whether prayer that punishment in the grave be lightened is a sign of affi liation.56 Th e correct interpretation is that it is not, because the Prophet, on whom be blessings and peace, tore apart a palm-leaf stalk and threw half into the grave of a man who was guilty of slander, and half into the grave of a man who did not clean himself aft er urinating, in the hope of alleviating their suff ering somewhat, as long as the stalk had moisture in it (ibid., 55).S: If a hypocrite does an act of obedience, is it permissible to say he is one of the people of obedience (min ahl al-ta‘a), or that he is fi t for obedience (ahl li-’ l-ta‘a)?T: No, it is not allowed, for if he were one of the people of obedience, he wouldn’t be a hypocrite. Th is single act of obedience, unless it is an act of 56. Th ere are Qur’anic verses that indicate that the angel of death pulls the souls out of an unbeliever roughly but is gentle with believers.

Some say you can say them meaning a worldly reward, while having an inner aversion to saying this, because just as it is impermissible to empower an enemy of God to disobey God, likewise it is impermissible to pray that he would be strengthened or blessed or welcomed by God. Th e best inter-pretation is just to say, “Welcome” (ahlan wa-marhaban), without intending or suggesting anything regarding the aft erlife. Th e most commonly held interpre-tation is that it is even prohibited to say “welcome,” but all of these are diff erent opinions. Say “May God make you prosper (aslahaka)” if you mean a worldly compensation, and “May God give you health” if you mean health in this world.In my opinion, it is permissible to pray for prosperity (salah) and health while meaning the prosperity of his religion and healing him from the commis-sion of sins through guidance. Th e permissibility of doing this revolves around the speaker’s intention, and in this case the intention is correct and the goal is something God deems good. So for example, if by saying “May God heal you” you mean healing from God’s justice in the aft erlife, that would mean nothing but affi liation. So look to the state of the person for whom you pray—if he is an affi liate, you are on target, but if he is an enemy, God cannot affi liate with him. Likewise if you say, “May God make your destiny narrow” and you mean dis-grace in the aft erlife or the narrowing that pertains to an infi del, that is entirely dissociation. So look to the state of the one to whom you address such hostility, and do not say such a thing to an affi liate of God (ibid.).S: Is it permissible to appear to pray for good in the aft erlife for an enemy of God, but without intention? If it is permissible, why is it?T: It is permissible if there is an alternative implication in what you are say-ing, or if you intend to address your speech to an affi liate of God. Th is is only in circumstances in which this is benefi cial—not to multiply words—or will repel harm, and in situations in which one must hide one’s true beliefs (mawadi‘ al-taqiyya), in which case words can have a double meaning, one that is apparent and one that is hidden.

If an enemy of God is good to me, undoubtedly his kindness will cause my soul to incline toward him and love him. Does such a natural inclination harm me?T: Natural love does not harm you unless it becomes religious affi liation.58 Th ere is nothing wrong with being polite to someone while inwardly maintain-ing religious dissociation from him. Th e Prophet only asked his Lord not to give any infi del who lived near him something that would make him love him because of the Prophet’s perfect devotion and desire to be aff ected by God alone, in wor-ship and in love. Th e Messenger of God was pleasant, gentle, and perfectly cour-teous to everyone, but that did not impugn his complete dissociation from God’s enemies. Th ere is no harm in good etiquette, gentleness, kind words, living cour-teously with other people, and observing proper speech, as long as it does not extend to affi liation with the person for whom God requires enmity. Likewise, there is no harm in giving gift s and fi nancial assistance or helping God’s enemy escape from injustice and helping him in a just and pious cause, as long as such assistance does not strengthen his ability to disobey God or perpetrate injustice against a person or his wealth or lead to any injustice against a Muslim or the private property of the Muslims or anything of that sort. While being courteous, you avoid doing for the one from whom you dissociate anything that requires affi liation or that leads to it, in act or speech, but do good and observe manners with the just and the unjust; and God knows best.S: Should I greet a person from whom I dissociate, comfort him in his sor-rows, and congratulate him on occasions of joy?57. Rafa‘a can mean either “raise” or “remove.”58. Th e distinction al-Rawahi makes here between “natural” love and the love of religious affi liation appears to contradict the defi nition of walaya given by ‘Abd al-‘Aziz al-Th amini (1986, 2:115): “Th e reality of walaya is love in the heart/soul (bi-’l-janan), mentioning with the tongue, inclination in the heart (al-mayl bi-’l-qalb) and the limbs.”"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Affi liation and Dissociation • 205T: If he is a monotheist, give him the greeting of peace and shake his hand, if your heart is safe from religious love (al-hubb al-dini), and comfort him in his sorrows. If he is an unbeliever, do not greet him or comfort him except with an appropriate expression and by commanding God’s pleasure and giving good admonition. If he gives you the greeting of peace, just reply, “And on you.”59S: If he is a hypocritical monotheist or one of our theological opponents and he gives me the greeting of peace, do I reply with the same greeting I would give to God’s affi liates, responding in kind or with a greeting that is better than his?T: If you like and you feel it is necessary, you may say “And on you be peace and the mercy and blessings of God” instead of “And on you,” while meaning things in this world. God the Mighty and Majestic said, “Return their greeting with what is better” (4:86). Greeting is general, and the law (al-shar‘) has chosen the greeting of peace and other similar greetings. If he says, “May God make your evening good” or “Good morning,” you may expand on his greeting or shorten it. For example, you could reply, “May God make your evening good and give you good health.” Every sort of greeting is permissible and should be responded to or added to in an appropriate manner. If you console him by saying “May God reward you greatly and remove your sorrow,” and you mean in this world, no harm is done. It is best to avoid such expressions and use other less suggestive words of consolation, for there are many alternatives in speech (Atfayyish 1980a, 57).Lesson 4: Suspending Judgment and Its RegulationsS: Is suspending judgment60 from someone with whom neither affi liation nor dissociation is permissible a religious obligation in the same way that affi liation and dissociation are when they are appropriate?59. Th e greeting “Peace be upon you” (Al-salamu ‘alaykum) is used exclusively among Mus-lims, to which the appropriate response is “and on you be peace” (wa-‘alaykum al-salam), or, even better, “And on you be peace and the mercy and blessings of God” (wa-‘alaykum al-salam wa-rahmat Allah wa-barakatuhu), because the Qur’an tells Muslims to return a greeting with a greeting that is better than it (4:86). A curt “And on you” would be noticeably short of the standard of politeness expected between Muslims, but is suggested here as a minimal courtesy that could be observed with those deemed “polytheists,” which would include Jews and Christians.60. Th e discussion on suspending judgment is taken from Atfayyish (1980a, 58–59)."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"206 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-WahbiyyaT: It is obligatory for a person who is accountable before God to suspend judgment when appropriate, just as it is obligatory to affi liate or dissociate when appropriate.S: When is suspending judgment appropriate, and what makes it obligatory?T: It is appropriate and obligatory when you do not know whether something someone has done requires affi liation or dissociation, or if there are two opinions on it, or if there are two contradictory obligations in which one does not overrule the other. In the case of such ignorance, you must dissociate from him until you know the rule for that deed, whether it requires affi liation or dissociation.S: What is the basis for the obligation to suspend judgment?T: It is based on the Book and the Sunna. From the Book are the words of the Most High, “Do not form an opinion on something of which you have no knowledge” (17:36), and “My Lord has forbidden indecencies, whether evident or hidden, and sin and unjust oppression, and that you associate with God others to whom He has not given authority, or that you say about God what you do not know” (7:33). And in the Sunna are the Messenger’s words, “Suspend judgment concerning what you do not know.”61S: If two men curse each other or fi ght each other and I do not know which of them is right and who is wrong, what should I do?T: Leave each of them in the condition in which they already were with you, whether in affi liation, dissociation, or suspending judgment. Th at is with regard to their status with you. As for what they are doing, suspend judgment and do not decide that it is right or wrong. If it becomes clear to you which of them started the cursing or fi ghting, you must dissociate from him; at that point, you may not suspend judgment concerning what he did, because you know that it is some-thing that requires dissociation.S: If I see someone do something and I don’t know the rules for that act, and I know that I have kept the one who did it in the condition in which he was before (affi liation, dissociation, or suspending judgment), and I am suspending 61. A similar hadith may be found in Ibn Maja (2000, Introduction, bab 8, no. 57), in words addressed to Mu‘adh b. Jabal when he was sent to Yemen: “If a matter is unclear to you (in ashkala ‘alayka amr), suspend judgment (fa-qif) until you have clarifi ed it.”"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Affi liation and Dissociation • 207judgment concerning what he did, as to whether it was right or wrong, am I required to ask about the judgment of the law on that act?T: You are not required to ask about the judgment on that act, although some claim that you are. But if you wish to ask, do so without naming the person who did the act; just ask as if you were wishing to learn the rule regarding that act, without attributing it to a specifi c person. For example, you could say, “What is the rule concerning someone who does such-and-such?” or “What is the rule concerning an affi liate who does such-and-such?” Because if you identify the one who did the deed and, for example, it is polytheism or adultery, whoever hears what you say must dissociate from you unless you bring three witnesses in a case of adultery, in which you are the fourth witness, and they confi rm your testimony, and you say before you report the matter, “Th ese three say the same as I,” or, in a case of polytheism, if there is a second person who gives the same testimony as you. If one of them is not a valid witness, or if you do not say “Th ey say the same as I,” the one who hears your allegation must dissociate from you as well as from the three who confi rm your testimony in a matter of adultery, or the single person who confi rms what you say on a matter of polytheism, if you do not say “Th ey say the same as I” or “Th is one says the same as I,” because your tes-timony would then be null and void. Th ey must also say the same thing, if their testimony is valid. If you identify the accused, and the sin is a grave sin that falls short of polytheism or adultery and the accused is an affi liate, your accusation would be a sin that would require dissociation from you, unless you have some-one else with you who gives the same testimony and you are both valid witnesses and you say “Th is person says the same as I” before you give your report.S: If the person I am asking says, “Th e person who did this is an infi del,” should I dissociate from him?T: No, why would you do that? His infi delity is based only on hearsay, not on the testimony of an eyewitness. And you must say “I am asking,” lest you become obligated to dissociate from the person you are asking by not dissociating from the person who committed the grave sin. Th at is what the scholars say, and the Qutb, may God have mercy on him, said: “Th is is so you explicitly tell him that you are not dissociating from the perpetrator, although you know that the deed is a grave sin, or so it is clear to the person you are asking that you are an affi liate of the perpetrator or that you are suspending judgment regarding him, although"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"208 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-Wahbiyyayou know that the deed is a grave sin.

Some say he has disobeyed God, and oth-ers say he has committed an error that does not lead to perdition—there are dif-ferent opinions (ibid.).S: If the deed is permitted or disapproved or is a minor sin, and on the basis of that someone affi liates, dissociates or suspends judgment, what is his status?T: His status is the infi delity of hypocrisy (kufr al-nifaq), unless he believes it to be permitted or reprehensible or prohibited; in that case, his status is the infi -delity of unbelief (kufr shirk). Likewise, if he believed a minor sin to be unbelief, or if he believed it to be the beginning of unbelief, his status is the infi delity of hypocrisy (ibid., 59–60).S: If someone applies one of the three judgments to all people, what is his status?T: He is an unbeliever (mushrik).S: Is the one who hears him do this excused?T: Some say he is excused if he does not dissociate from him regarding his affi liation with all people, but not if he does not dissociate from him regarding his suspension of judgment concerning all people or dissociation from all people. So they say, but the Qutb says: “Th e most obvious interpretation is that either he must be excused for all the stances the other person takes, or he must be sub-jected to dissociation for all of them. What is required is that one dissociate from him in all these cases. Th e argument that the speaker applied the same judgment to all but only meant some, and that since he is a monotheist the one who heard him do this must be excused in all cases, although they did not excuse him in all cases, is unsound” (ibid., 60).S: Why did Imam Afl ah b. ‘Abd al-Wahhab say, “Do not dissociate from a believer until he is present and can defend himself ”?"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Affi liation and Dissociation • 209T: Th e imam was truthful and righteous, may God be pleased with him!

If a person says to an affi liate, “You infi del (ya kafi r)!” and he replies, “You are the infi del!” there is no harm to the one who replied, because he is telling the truth.

Th e Qur’an sees the religion of all the true pre-Muhammadan prophets as Islam, and explicitly says that Abraham, his son (usually thought to be Ishmael), and Jesus’ disciples called themselves muslimun—that is, “Muslims” or, more generically, in submission to God (2:128 and 3:51)."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"People Who Are Not of Muhammad’s Umma • 213S: Which of these religions were true before the coming of our messenger Muhammad, God’s blessings and peace on him?T: Take the answer to your question from God’s word: “Th e believers, the Jews, the Sabaeans, and the Christians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and does good deeds, has no reason to fear, and they will not grieve” (5:69). Th is verse indicates that the Jews (al-Yahud), the Christians (al-Nasara), and the Sabaeans (al-Sabi’un) were originally following the truth before the coming of the Prophet, but they became unbelievers by introducing new things into their religions, like Sabaean angel-worship, or violating the commands of the Torah and the Gospel and not believing in God’s Messenger, on whom be blessings and peace.S: What is the origin of these three names?T: Th e Jews were called al-Yahud because of their distortion (tahawwud) in their recitation of scripture,3 or because they said, “We have turned (hudna) to You” (7:156), meaning “We have repented.” Al-Yahud might also mean the fol-lowers of Judah (Ya h u d h a), Jacob’s son, whose name is better known by dropping the alif and ignoring the dot over the letter dhal.4 Th e Christians are [allegedly] called al-Nasara because they said, “We are God’s helpers (ansar) (61:14), but that explanation is improbable. It is more likely that they are called such because they settled in a village called Nazareth (Nasira).5 Th e Sabaeans are called al-Sabi’un because of their turning (subu’) from one religion to another, or because they chose only the pleasant parts (mata’ib) of the Torah and Gospel, or because they said, “We are correct” (sa’ibun), from being on the mark (isaba), and sa’ib was 3. Western scholars believe the Arabic al-Yahud is taken from the Aramaic word for “Jews,” but here al-Rawahi (following Atfayyish) treats it as an Arabic word and tries to fi nd its root. Th e word tahawwud in its modern usage means “to convert someone to Judaism,” but the linkage here to distortion in recitation (qira’a) of scripture refers to the Qur’an’s accusations that the Jews mis-quoted scripture or took its words out of context (4:46).4. Th e alif is the lengthening of the “a” at the end of Yahudha, marked in transliterations of Arabic into Latin letters as a dash over the letter. Th e letter dhal, which makes a hard “th” sound as in the English world “this,” is distinguished from the letter dal (the “d” sound) only by a dot over it. If the alif is dropped, Yahudha becomes Yahudh, and if the dot is ignored, Yahudh becomes Ya hud .5. Most contemporary scholars agree that the name pertains to Nazareth, not because the disciples settled there (which they did not), but because Jesus was known as Jesus of Nazareth."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"214 • Al-‘Aqida ’l-Wahbiyyachanged to sabi’. It is not from their saying “We hit the mark” (asabna)6 because that has a four-letter root (ruba‘i), whereas al-Sabi’ is from a three-letter root, because al-Sabi’un came with a hamza aft er the letter ba’,7 not the other way around as in “he hit the mark” (asaba).S: What does it mean for them to choose the pleasant parts of the Torah and the Gospel?T: Th ey took litanies (awrad) and superfl uities (nawafi l) in isolation, and occupied themselves only with these. If they had changed any of the religious obligations or rules about what is permitted and prohibited, God would not have denied that they would have fear and grief if they believed and did good deeds.S: Why are the Zoroastrians called Majus?T: Th ey are called by the name of their chief in the Farsi language, which is Maka’us, which means having much hair on the ears.8 It was Arabized by replacing the letter kaf [the “k” sound] with a letter jim [the “j” sound], and elid-ing the hamza [glottal stop] to it because of the damma [the “u” sound] which removes the hamza. Th ey worship fi re, the sun, the moon, and the stars. Th ey married their close relatives (maharim) and ate carrion.9 It is said that they had a scripture and lost it entirely, so it was taken away. Because of the likeness of 6. Asabna would indeed mean “we are correct” or “we have hit the mark,” but it is not from a four-letter root, so perhaps a diff erent vocalization was intended than that given in the manuscripts I consulted. I am not aware of any four-letter roots using these consonants. Nonetheless, he is right to say that al-Sabi’ (root s-b-’) is not from the same root as asaba, isaba, or asabna (root s-w-b).7. Th e hamza is the glottal stop marked by an apostrophe when Arabic is transliterated into Latin letters. Th e hamza is considered a consonant in Arabic. Th e letter ba’ is transliterated into Latin letters as b. Short vowels are not considered letters in Arabic, so from the perspective of Arabic grammar the letter ba’ in al-Sabi’un is followed by a hamza.8. Th e name Majus applied originally only to a priestly caste in the pre-Islamic Persian empire, but came to be used in Arabic for Zoroastrians in general. Th e “Magi” or “wise men” who are said to have come seeking the newborn king of the Jews in Matthew 2:1 are likely a reference to this group. In Old Persian the pronunciation was magush (Morony 1999). Abu Ishaq Ibrahim Atfayyish, the editor of Atfayyish 1980a, notes that he has never come across the word Maka’us. I am unaware of any source linking the Majus to hairy ears.9. Maharim are relatives whose kinship is too close to allow marriage according to Islamic law.

To know them means knowing that they are religions of unbelief, or knowing that idol worshippers and Zoroastrians are unbelievers, because a person who is ignorant of the polytheism of those who say there are multiple gods is not excused. Th e Sabaeans said that light existed from all eternity and that good was begotten from it, and likewise darkness begat evil. According to this opinion, it is not necessary to know that they say this, and such a statement does not explicitly state that they believe in multiple gods. Some say that what is required is to know that they have rejected God, and that the Jews, Christians, and Sabaeans are infi dels (kafi run), while others say that they are unbelievers (mushrikun), and others say that they are hypocrites—but that is not an appropriate thing to say about them, because of the obligation to know that rejection of a prophet or anything like that is infi delity (kufr) and a grave 10.

A person who gives his female ward who is an affi liate in marriage to a man of another sect does not commit infi delity, although it is wrong to do this because he causes her to turn to the other sect.

Th e Sabaean and the Zoroastrian pays whatever the Imam deems most appropriate among these diff erent opinions. Th e Qutb, may God have mercy on him, said:Investigation proves that ‘Umar and other Muslim leaders did not intend to set a specifi c amount for every individual for all time, but always assessed the tax on every people according to their circumstances, the time in which they lived, and the need of the Muslims. Don’t you see that the people of Alexandria said to ‘Amr b. al-‘As, “Set the jizya for us,” and he replied, “No, even if you gave me enough to fi ll the house from the foundation to the roof! If we are in need, we will be exacting with you, and if we are in ease, we will be easy on you.” Don’t you see that ‘Umar issued one ruling for the people of Syria, according to what the shaykh related, and he gave a diff erent ruling for the people of Kufa than he did for others? If the people knew of one ruling they thought it was applied everywhere for all people, but it was not like that, as indicated by the diff erence among them. (Atfayyish 1980a, 71)By “the shaykh” he means Shaykh Isma‘il [b. Musa al-Jaytali], may God have mercy on him, because he wrote in his Qawa‘id that ‘Umar, may God be pleased with him, wrote to ‘Uthman b. Hunayf in Kufa that the wealthy should pay forty-eight dirhams, and those who had less should pay twenty-four, and those who had yet less should pay twelve dirhams. He said this in the presence of the Compan-ions, and no one objected. Th e value of the dirham in relation to the dinar is that twelve dirhams equal one dinar except in matters of zakat, for which ten dirhams equal one dinar. If they wished, they could pay the jizya in dinars at the rate of twelve dirhams for one dinar.S: Is the requirement of the jizya general or are only particular individuals required to pay it?T: No, there is no jizya on women, children, slaves, old men, or insane peo-ple.

Or it could mean that they submit it with their own hands and do not send it with someone else. For that reason it is forbidden for them to appoint a trustee to do this. Or it could mean “from [their] wealth,” and therefore it is said that it should not be taken from a poor man. Or it could mean from a hand that has con-quered them, which means they are powerless and humbled. Or it could mean that it is from a grace bestowed upon them, because keeping them alive through payment of the jizya is a great grace. Or it could mean from the jizya, meaning in coins that are passed from hand to hand.S: What is the meaning of God’s words (9:29) “while they are subjugated” (wa-hum saghirun), and what is the wisdom in attaching subjugation to them?T: It means while they are humbled. Ibn ‘Abbas, may God be pleased with both [him and his father], says that when the jizya is taken from someone, he should be slapped on the neck (tawajja’a ‘unuquhu). Wajja’tuhu ‘unuqahu waj’an (I slapped his neck with a slap) means “I hit him.”Th e wisdom in slapping his neck and in attaching subjugation to him and not just taking the jizya is that the Most High linked their paying the jizya with His words “while they are subjugated,” so in order to spare the blood of one of the People of t he Book it is not enough for t hem just to pay t he jizya, but t hey must do it in humiliation and subjugation. Th e reason for this is that any rational person naturally recoils from bearing humiliation and subjugation, so if he is given time to witness the glory of Islam and to hear the proofs of its soundness, while wit-nessing the humiliation and subjugation of infi delity and its people, it is obvious that this will draw him to Islam. Th at is the goal of prescribing the jizya.Th e goal of imposing the jizya is not to reinforce the People of the Book in their infi delity, but to take it to spare their blood and to give them time, in the hope that perhaps they will become aware during this time of the excellences of Islam and the strength of its proofs, and turn from infi delity to faith. Th ey have the scripture in their hands, so perhaps they will think about it and observe the truth of Muhammad, on whom be blessings and peace, in his claim to propheth-ood. So they are given a respite, not to affi rm their position or because of pleasure in it.

Th e scholars who prescribed t his were not heed less of t he fact that there is no compulsion in religion! But this is done to force him to pay the jizya, not to force him to embrace the religion. He will see the glory of Islam with his own eyes, so if he wishes to ennoble himself and escape from the humili-ation of infi delity, he has the ability to do this. He really brought this suff ering on himself through his own choice, because he can escape it through his tongue declaring God’s oneness, and then he is released to go his way. It is obvious that the punishment suggested by both opinions is harsh, but, as I explained earlier, the bankrupt person does not pay the jizya, but that is not lucky because of what follows. Th e Qutb, may God be pleased with him, said, “Th e sound opinion is that he has no obligation to pay the jizya, because no obligation is imposed beyond a person’s ability. Rather than binding him, it would be better to make him do work that would equal the amount of the jizya” (Atfayyish 1980a, 71).S: What are the permissible limits on a ruler (sultan) of the Muslims in col-lecting the jizya?T: Th e limits are these: he may not oppress those from whom he takes the jizya; he must provide for the poor of the people who pay the jizya from the money collected in the jizya, and for the poor of the people [Muslims] who pay zakat from the money collected in zakat.20 No one may collect the jizya except the imam, and if someone else collects it, it should not be used; though some say anyone who is able to protect them from oppression may collect it; there are two opinions on this.

One must know at what time things are done, like the obligation to affi rm the faith when one reaches maturity and rationality, and that one prays the noon prayer aft er the sun has reached its peak, and that fasting is done at the onset of Ramadan. One must know of the prophets and angels, what is permissible, and what is prohibited, by being presented with evidence. One must know how God is described, by having it explained and by asking about it. One must know about equivalence in action, though some say it is not neces-sary to know it, but that saying is weak. One must know what pleases God, what He has commanded and prohibited, what is erroneous, and what is correct. One should also know what things are collective duties that require only a suffi cient number of people to do them.2S: What is the basis for making knowledge obligatory?T: All three roots of the law3 are a basis for making the seeking of knowledge obligatory.

Keep to your own limits, and beware of these explanations, which I fear will lead you to rely on dubious arguments! In truth, I assure you, when the command came, it was because of obligation! If it were an isolated instance and there were no second proof-text, you might say it was merely to encourage people. Th is is our teaching and the teaching of all our theological opponents concerning isolated commands.S: What is the proof for this allegation?T: Turn your eyes to the words of the Most High: “May those who oppose His command beware” (24:63) and “He deviated from the command of His Lord” (18:50). If you look in comparable verses you will fi nd that the Glorious One says that sedition, immorality, reproach, and blame all result from opposing and fail-ing to obey His command. Would these calamities fall on those who oppose His command if the command were meant only as an encouragement? You see that He Whose praise is glorious made clear what happens to those who oppose His commands, without telling us that the command is obligatory, but He tells us, “If you don’t do this, you are an infi del” or “you will be punished” or something of the sort, so understand or come learn! Yes, it is possible that when the Most High says “Th ey oppose His command” He means just one of His commands, with the implication that it is the opposite of prohibition. In the hadith, “If I command you to do something, obey as well as you can,” his saying “as well as you can” indicates that obeying is an obligation linked to the command in his words “if I command you.” If he commands us, we are obligated to obey his commands. Th e outcome is that the command is an obligation so you will act according to it, as you would with other commands.Prophet.

If he acts accord-ing to it aft erward, he benefi ts from the act as well, except in matters of faith, because knowledge of faith does not precede an action: if you know it and do not deny it, you have completed the action in your heart.

Since it is a defamation of His divinity and an affi rmation of His defi ciency and of the nonexistence of His essence to assert that God is made impotent through the eff ective power of the will of another god, how could the eff ective power and will of a human being make Him impotent?Th ey are not helped by their response, which is that it is not necessary that the Most High have no power over an act produced by a human being, because the Most High is capable of bringing it into existence by stripping the person of power over it and of will for it, and by making it an act of coercion, like the act a person who is shivering, because we say that it is absolutely impossible for God to be overpowered or unable to bring any possible thing into existence. Th is answer of theirs requires that the Most High be unable to bring the act of the person into existence, unless the person is stripped of power and will. So, according to them, that possible act is beyond His power and He is unable to bring it into existence, and He is overpowered by the power and will of the person, although their afore-mentioned answer does not accord with their corrupt principle that God must do what is good and best, because it is impossible for Him to strip the person of the power He created for him aft er making him accountable; indeed, He must help him by making [good] acts easy for him.If you understand this, you know that the correct teaching is that of the majority (al-jumhur), and is indicated by [263] the obvious meaning of the Book and Sunna, and was agreed upon by the early Muslims (al-salaf) before the appearance of heresies: that God is the Creator and all else is created, that the Most High has no partner in His dominion, and that having an eff ect on things and the power to bring things into existence are His characteristics and cannot be affi rmed of anything else.It is reported that al-Juwayni said that originated [human] power does aff ect acts, but not independently [of divine power], as the Mu‘tazila said; rather,"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Necessity of the Absolute Oneness of God Most High • 243human power aff ects acts according to the measure determined by God Most High and in the manner He intended.

Some of the Ash‘arites chose the teaching of al-Baqillani and distinguished between the aspects of production (ikhtira‘) and acquisition (kasb), in that the movement, as a movement, is attributed to the act of God Most High in terms of its production and being brought into existence.1 Th is requires that He know it in all its aspects, and that the movement not act upon the essence of the Most High, nor is He described by it in the sense that it subsists in Him; nor can one say that He moves by it because He brought it into existence and produced it.Th e act is attributed to the human being in terms of its particular qualities, such as prayer, for example, or illegal seizure or theft or adultery, and human power has no eff ect except in that aspect; there is no stipulation that the person know all aspects of the act. His body is the locus of the act and of his acquisition of it, and the act is attributed to him, so it is said that he is moving or at rest or praying or illegally seizing or stealing or committing adultery, and so forth. If a command is attached to it and the act accords with it, it is called an act of obe-dience and of worship. If a prohibition attaches to it and the act opposes it, it is called an act of disobedience and a crime. Th at is the aspect concerning which the person is commanded through words that are addressed to him, ordering him to pray and fast and not to commit illegal seizure or theft , and it [is this aspect] that makes an act worthy of reward, punishment, praise, or blame. How-ever, concerning its coming into existence, there is no diff erence between volun-tary and involuntary acts.[264] Th at is what this group says, and it is more balanced than the teaching of the Mu‘tazila, because they affi rm things according to their realities in nonex-istence, in the sense that [they say that] the reality of a nonexistent possible thing and its essential characteristics (awsafahu ’ l-nafsiyya) are fi xed in the mode of its 1.

Command and prohibition do not attach to a specifi c mode, but to particular characteristics and expressions. Acts are either good or bad according to these characteristics, and these entail praise or blame.According to them, acts that are commanded or prohibited are not deter-mined for a person; what is determined for a person are things for which there is no human accountability. In this way they diff er from the teaching of al-Baqillani, whose opinion meets the demands of both reason and revelation, as indeed do the opinions of all three of them, although what al-Juwayni reports concerning the teaching of al-Baqillani and al-Isfarayini drift s into the teaching of the Mu‘tazila, but without going so far as their heinous belief or [on the other extreme] so far as requiring people to do what is impossible for them, with the assessment that human power has no eff ect on anything at all, as the majority say, whereas the Mu‘tazila say to us that the outcome of obligation according to this estimation is “Act, you who have no act: do what I am doing,” although that is weak.What al-Baqillani and his companions rely on in attributing all possible things to God Most High is their possibility; the particular characteristic of one is no better than another [in this regard].

Th is chapter is divided into sections.Section 1: Th e Doctrine of AcquisitionA person who is subject to the law must believe that God the Glorious created human beings (al-‘ibad) and created their acts and created reward and punish-ment for these acts, and that they acquire (iktasabu) their acts and do them, [266] and are not compelled or forced to do them. Th ere is disagreement concerning the defi nition of an act, insofar as it is [their] act. Th e best defi nition of it, accord-ing to the principle of our companions and those who agree with them on this, is that it is an accident1 brought into being at the same time as the capacity (istita‘a) to do it. Th is matter is referred to as “acquisition” (kasb), which is one of the obscure topics of study in theology (min ghawamid mabahith ‘ ilm al-kalam).Th e truth is that a person does not create his [or her] own acts, but merely acquires them by the necessit y of the attachment of accountabilit y to them (daru-rat ta‘alluq al-taklif bi-ha). We k now by demonstration (bi-’ l-burhan) that there is no creator but God Most High, and we know of necessity that power that is origi-nated for a person (al-qudra ’ l-haditha li-’ l-‘abd) attaches to some of his deeds, such as getting up, but not others, such as falling.

Because of this ascription, the person is variably described according to the deed: good if it is an act of obedience and bad if it is an act of disobedience, because a bad deed done intentionally and willfully is bad, unlike the creation of evil, which does not negate a praiseworthy benefi t; indeed it may be both, because it is established that the Creator is wise2 and that He does not create things without a praiseworthy outcome, although we may not understand it. So anyone who imagines that the Most High does evil must understand that there may be wisdom and good in His creating them, just as there is in the cre-ation of ugly, harmful or painful bodies—unlike the acquirer, who may do good or evil. Th erefore we say that the acquisition of evil aft er its prohibition is evil, foolish, and deserving of blame and punishment.One cannot say, “Th e Most High’s independence in creating acts is proven, and a single object of power cannot come under two diff erent powers, as is nec-essary by your assertion that the act is both created by God and acquired by the person who does it,” [267] because we say that since it has been demonstrated that the creator of the act is God, and it is necessary that the power and will of the per-son enter into some acts, such as the movement of anger, but not others, such as shivering, we need to avoid this diffi culty by saying that God Most High creates the act and the person acquires it. It has been established that the application of a person’s power and will to an act is limited to acquisition and that God, as the one who brings the act into being, is its creator. Th erefore, a single object of power (al-maqdur al-wahid) is subject to two diff erent powers from two diff erent aspects; it is subject to human power from the aspect of acquisition. Th is determination of meaning is necessar y, a lthough we cannot say more than to summarize by say ing that human acts are created and brought into being by God at the same time as human power and choice. We may distinguish between acquisition and creation 2.

According to them, animals are like inanimate things in relation to their acts and have no power over them, either to produce them or to acquire them. Th e fallacy of this argu-ment is obvious, for we necessarily judge that we choose some of our acts, such as extending our hand to take something, and are compelled toward others, such as shivering. Th ey are compelled to hold that human beings are not accountable for anything they do, and that it is literally and legally inappropriate to ask them to do something or to prohibit it or praise or blame or reproach them for doing it, and that there should be no surprise over their disbelief, as expressed by “How can you disbelieve in God?” (Q 2:28). All this is false, by the consensus of the monotheists.One cannot say, “You must believe in compulsion, since you do not assign to human beings any eff ect in their acts,” because we say that the compulsion of which one should beware is what we can sense (hissi). Th e compulsion that we under-stand with our intellect, on the other hand, is the removal of [268] [the attribution of ] creation from human beings, for all [Muslim] sects agree on this—indeed, that is faith itself. Just as whatever God Most High wills to occur from a person neces-sarily occurs through his choice, the necessity of its occurrence through choice is inevitably actualized because of that choice, a truth that no one denies.Note: Some say that the meaning of choice is that when it occurs to a person to do something and he hesitates to do it and abandons it, there arises from his hesitation an inclination toward preferring one alternative over the other. Th is inclination is called “will,” and the preference is called “choice.” If he suddenly tries to do something and prefers it, the One who brings it from nonexistence into existence is God, who is glorifi ed and exalted.Section 2: Human Power Comes into Being with Its ActKnow that we only speak of a power belonging to a human being at the time of the act that is its object because of the necessary distinction you fi nd between the"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"What Is Possible Concerning the Most High • 249movements of coercion (idtirar) and of acquisition. Th is characteristic (hukm), which is conjunction, is not permanent insofar as it is a power, but rather insofar as it is an accident (‘arad). One of the characteristics of accidents is that they pass into nonexistence aft er the time of their existence, and it is usually (fi ’l-akthar) impossible for them to remain beyond that time in order to exist in another, as has been explained earlier. If the impossibility of their remaining is established, it is clear that originated power cannot exist before [the act for which it is cre-ated], because if it existed before the act, it would have to pass into nonexistence at the time that the act that is its object comes into existence, in which case it would come into existence through a nonexistent power, which is impossible. To affi rm that means that if the power is nonexistent, the existence of its opposite, impotence, is possible, in which case the act would be subject to a person’s power at a moment when he is impotent, which would mean that he is unable to do it. So something would happen that at the time of its occurrence is the result of an impotent power, which is impossible.One of their scholars who has refl ected on the impossibility of the existence of power to act before the act said that if this is taken only with respect to the impossibility of the endurance of accidents, then the power is not really a cause of the act’s coming into existence, nor does it aff ect it. If it does not bring the empowered act into existence, [269] it is possible for it to exist before the act that it is empowered to do, then pass into nonexistence, and then a similar power could come into existence. In that case, the power that comes into existence at that time is attached to the act, and the power that existed before the act is [also] attached, so one could say that this power was attached to the act before it passed into nonexistence and ceased to exist, and its attachment to it ceased to exist, and a similar power came into existence.It is as if someone k new by true information that Zayd would come into exis-tence tomorrow at sunrise, for example. Th en we could renew his knowledge that this would happen at the known time, until its occurrence at the time he was told it would occur. So the [knowledge] that comes into existence at that point, attach-ing to the previous existence [of knowledge], attaches to Zayd’s coming into exis-tence at the specifi ed time. So t he object of k nowledge is attached to bot h of t hem, one earlier and one later.If it were possible for something that is the opposite of knowledge to occur at the time that an object of knowledge comes into existence, such as bewilderment, neglect, ignorance or doubt, then, at the time that the"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"250 • Kitab Ma‘alim al-Dinobject of knowledge came into existence, it would be unknown by knowledge that occurs at the same time, although it attaches to the knowledge that existed before the object of knowledge came into existence. So a consideration of its lack of attachment to the one who knew of it beforehand at the time it comes into existence enables us to understand that an empowered act is not attached to a preexistent power at the time that it comes into existence. Th is does not prevent its preexistence, especially since we have said that [the power] does not aff ect [the empowered act], but merely attaches to the empowered act, without producing an eff ect on it. Since we say that knowledge can attach to an object of knowledge before it comes into existence, what is to prevent power from attaching to an empowered act before the act? A person can sense in himself, before he does something, the diff erence between his act of shivering and something he does when he is healthy. Th at is simply because he fi nds an essential attribute attached to the act before it occurs, and then similar powers are renewed until the time the empowered act comes into existence.Proof for the assertion (ithbat) of originated power is that we can imagine two movements going (mutajarradatayn) in the same direction (jiha) and hav-ing similar force (jabr), but one of them is coerced (idtirariyya) and the other is acquired (iktisabiyya). Th ere is no doubt that we fi nd a necessary distinction between the two movements, but this distinction cannot be due to a diff erence in the movements themselves, because they resemble each other and belong to the same person who is doing these movements; what can be discerned concerning both is the same. So the distinction must be due to an additional attribute in the mover. It cannot be due to a mode (hal), because a mode cannot be examined by itself in a substance, as modes [270] cannot be discerned by themselves, but would have to be distinguished by another mode subsisting in it, and that by another mode, and so on, which would result in an infi nite series. Th e distinction [between the two movements] cannot be due to the soundness of the construc-tion [of the body of the mover] because that is not [necessarily] lost in a coerced movement, for example, if someone else is moving the person’s hand, despite the distinction, in which case the attribute would be an accident. Furthermore, this attribute must be something that either requires life or does not. Th e second [alternative] is wrong, because it would have no attachment to movement, and because it is shared between two things, so it is not the basis of the distinction between the two movements.

Th is [attribute] cannot be knowledge or life or speech, because all of these exist with both movements in the case of bewilderment. So it must be an accident with a relation and attachment to the movement. Th is is what we call “power.” Although we and the Mu‘tazila disagree concerning whether it is one of the attributes that exist from the start, we agree that it is one of the attributes that have attachments (annaha min al-sifat al-muta‘allaqa).Section 3: Accountability Attaches to AcquisitionWhat is meant by “acquisition” is nothing but the attachment of this originated power in the locus of the empowered act, at the same time as the act, without producing any eff ect. Acquisition is the attachment of legal accountability and entails the attainment of reward and punishment. So the teaching of the Com-pulsionists (al-Jabriyya), is wrong, because compulsion implies necessity and the nullifi cation of the locus of accountability and the aforementioned entailment [of reward and punishment]. For this reason, it is a heresy (bid‘a) that impacts the contract (‘aqd) of faith.Th e teaching of the Mu‘tazila is also wrong, which is that a person produces (yakhtari‘u) his own acts according to his will by the power that God Most High created (khalaqa) for him by the enabling He has given him (bi-wasitat iqdarihi la-hu). Th ey agree with us that it is created by the Most High,3 because if it were created [by the person] that would entail an infi nite series [of creators], and the falsity of that has already been explained in the proof of God’s oneness and the impossibility of His having a partner.Th e doctrine of acquisition occupies a position between those two corrupt teachings. Th e attachment of accountability, meaning that the empowered act comes into existence with the originated power, is required by the law in the matters for which the human being is held accountable, because in the case of an empowered act without [271] human power, like the movement of shivering, for example, our glorifi ed Lord graciously removes accountability from us, whether negatively by prohibiting it or positively by commanding it. A person who falls from a high place cannot be prohibited from falling at the time that this occurs, 3.

What we asserted earlier does not negate this, because it is an example that need not be restricted, and because the abandonment of obligatory duties is catego-rized as prohibited and the abandonment of recommended acts is categorized as reprehensible.Judgment concerning individual felicity and misery [in the aft erlife] exists from all eternity without any cause for it except that God Most High does what He likes and judges as He wills. Th e outcome of the teaching of the Compul-sionists (al-Mujbira), which results in stupidity and weakness of intellect, goes against the Shari‘a, because it removes accountability for acts for which there is usually no possible alternative (didd), whether through existence or nonexis-tence. Accountability usually exists for what is easy for a person to do or not to 4. According to this theological perspective, anything God does is good, because goodness is defi ned by what God does, not by human judgment of what is good. So even if God commanded what we perceive to be evil and prohibited what we perceive to be good, or if He made people accountable regardless of their ability to obey His commands, that would still be good.

If all acts were equal, as the Compulsionists say, the legal distinction between them would be nullifi ed, and accountability for doing them would also be nullifi ed—that is, for an act that is within the capacity of the accountable person, not any other act. In that case, no acts would ordinar-ily be within human capacity, so there would be no accountability for anything, because of the words of the Most High, “God does not place an obligation on a soul that is beyond its capacity” (2:286). Th eir teaching nullifi es the Book of God, the Sunna of the Prophet, and the consensus [of the umma].Section 4: Human Power Cannot Nullify God’s PowerTh ere are two other pitfalls in the doctrine of the Mu‘tazila, in addition to the previously mentioned proof of the impossibility of the impotence of the eternal power. One of these is that it requires that a possible thing be impossible. Th e second is that it gives more weight to that which has less (tarjih al-marjuh),5 which is obvious from their aforementioned arguments. Concerning the fi rst, it is said that a human act is possible before the power is created for it, and every possible thing is subject to the power of God Most High. Th e result is obvious: if He creates a power for a person, the Mu‘tazila say that at that point the possibility that the act could come into existence by the power of God Most High ceases by what He has established for the person, and it becomes impossible for it to come into existence by [God’s power]. So what was possible with respect to the power of the Most High has become impossible with respect to it.One cannot say that [the empowerment of] an accident is impossible for Him due to a c au se, na mely t he at t ach ment of or ig i nated power to it , or t hat it is i mpos-sible for a single act to be brought into existence through two diff erent powers. 5.

Neither of them has anything to distinguish it from the other in this regard, for if you say this, and that whatever God knows He will not bring into existence cannot occur, that goes against your teaching, and your companions will disagree that God has knowledge of a possible thing that will not occur, so what about something that is innately impossible (fa-ma zannuka bi-’ l-mumtani‘ al-wuqu‘)?” We have already answered this question concerning the attachment of [God’s] knowledge [to human acts]. By what is innately impossible, he is speaking comprehensively (ma huwa shamil) concerning that possible thing.Note: Know that when the Glorifi ed and Exalted One habitually gives a per-son the desire [to do something], followed by the power [to do it], so that he does not feel that he is forced to do the act [275] that comes to him, no matter how determined (mahma sammama ‘azmahu) the person may be to do the act, God the Glorifi ed helps him by creating it and creating the power to do it, whether it be an act of obedience or disobedience, as the Most High said: “Whoever desires this fl eeting life shall soon receive in it whatever We will; We bestow Our gift s on whomever We please. But then We have prepared hell for him, where he will burn, disgraced and rejected” (17:18). He also said, “We bestow the bounty of your Lord on all—on these and those” (17:20). Th is bestowal (imdad) is arranged according to their desire, if He wills, and that bestowal is called help (‘awn) and abandon-ment (khidhlan). So if you say that you interpret abandonment as a failure to help, in what sense is this a bestowal? I say it means that when the Glorifi ed One does not help a person, but lets him have what is ruinous to his soul while creating that in him, He has bestowed on him [the state implied by the Prophet’s prayer,] “God of majesty and generosity, do not leave us to ourselves (la takilna ‘ala anfusina) for an instant (tarfat ‘ayn)” (cf. Abu Dawud 2000, Kitab al-adab [42], bab 110, no. 5092) and by that bestowal the person appears to bring his act into existence, so fantasy and imagination have no doubt about that. Many have entered into that [fantasy and imagination], and were it not for the fact that God, by His grace and generosity, has supported the minds of the believers and torn away the veils of fan-tasies that darken the mind and exposed them to the suns of knowledge by which they understood the truth of the matter, they would be like others.Th erefore, some of them have interpreted the meaning of acquisition as the attachment of reward and punishment to a deed, in esteem, law, custom and"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"What Is Possible Concerning the Most High • 257intellect, and for this reason it is appropriate for a person be praised or blamed for his acts. But if we look to the inner meaning, as has been stated, and to the truth of the matter, it is not correct to make his act a rational cause of something. Th e Qur’an and the Sunna sometimes refer to human acts in the manner of “Enter the Garden because of what you have done” (16:32), and sometimes in the manner of “None of you will enter the Garden because of what he does.”8 Because one can fi nd texts coming down on both sides of the issue, and in consideration of the obscurity of what is meant by acquisition, it is said that the scope of human volition (al-jaza’ al-ikhtiyari) is narrower (adaqq) than a hair in the thought of al-Ash‘ari.Our shaykh9 (may God love him greatly!) said, “What is affi rmed for us in this matter is that we attribute to God Most High what He has attributed to Him-self, namely creation, and to the human being what He attributed to him, namely acquisition. We refrain from describing that acquisition in such a way that would [276] lead to a doctrine of compulsion, because of the words [of the Prophet], peace and blessings be upon him, from our glorifi ed and exalted Lord: ‘Determi-nation (qadar) is my secret. No one may know my secret.’”10 Th erefore, some of them say, “Th e human being is compelled (majbur) in the form of choice (fi qalib mukhtar),” which links the Qur’anic verse and the hadith in a number of ways:First, it expresses the aspect of human acts found in the Qur’anic verse, which makes them the cause of reward, because of the appearance of choice a person has, which is not expressed in the hadith, which shows the hidden aspect of compulsion in human acts, which makes them like necessary acts, like the movement of the person who shivers, or colors and foods, and other such things that are not the cause of reward or punishment.Second, it expresses human agency, because he appears to choose the act, although the reason the verse affi rms this is because, legally speaking, human acts are the cause of reward, whereas the reason the hadith denies that works are the cause of reward is that, rationally speaking, human acts are not the cause of 8. Th e printed text reads “because of his knowledge” (bi-‘ilmihi) rather than “because of what he does” (bi-‘amalihi), but this is undoubtedly an error produced by switching the order of the letters lam and mim. Variants on this hadith can be found in the collections of al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, and Ahmad b. Hanbal.9. Abu Zakariya Yahya b. Salih al-Afdali (d. 1202/1787).10.

So the denial and the affi rmation are not of the same thing; rather, the denial is of a rational cause, and the affi rmation is of a legal cause.Th ird, the meaning of the Qur’anic verse, “Enter it because of what you did” is [that it is] a mercy from God, and the meaning of the hadith is that no one enters Paradise because he deserves it because of what he did.Fourth, the meaning of the verse is “Enter it because of what you did,” although guidance and acceptance are only due to God’s favor, so in fact no one enters it because of deeds alone.Fift h, the hadith can be taken to mean only entering Paradise, whereas the verse can be taken to mean the attainment of ranks within it.Sixth, “because of ” in the verse means “in exchange for,” whereas in the hadith it implies a causal relationship.Seventh, the meaning of the hadith is that good deeds, insofar as they are human acts, do not allow the doer to enter Paradise unless they are accepted, and since that is so, and the matter of acceptance [277] belongs to God Most High, only those whose deeds are accepted by Him receive His mercy. Th e meaning of the verse is “Enter it because of what you did,” namely an act that is accepted. In this case there is no contradiction between the verse and the hadith.Ibn al-Banna’11 al-Marrakushi said, concerning acquisition, “Everyone fi nds in himself the ability to advance toward something (al-iqdam) or refrain from it (al-ihjam). A person does not advance or refrain because he knows what God wants concerning this; rather, he advances or refrains because of what his own soul wills and desires, and because he is able to do so. Aft er the fact, he knows that he was compelled to make that particular choice (majbur fi ‘ayn ikhtiyarihi), but not beforehand. Th e direction from which he advanced or refrained (accord-ing to his understanding) is acquisition, and the direction from which the act actually occurred is compulsion. Both are correct (haqq): acquisition from the mode of being God’s viceroy (khalifa), and compulsion with respect to reality (min wajh al-haqiqa). Accountability, reward and punishment are all placed by God Most High on acquisition with respect to the human being (min wajh al-khalq), not on compulsion with respect to reality.”11.

Th is is enough to guide a person to the path of guid-ance. It is best to avoid delving into obscure questions and their answers and argumentation with opponents, for although it was once a theological battle in need of defense, today it is a struggle (jihad) without enemies, and it tarnishes the purity of the hearts of God’s friends, because much investigation into futile matters disturbs the purity of the light of truth in the darkness of the hearts, and that is one of the greatest defects.[278] Section 5: Human Power Has No Eff ect on AnythingYou know that originated power has no eff ect on any possible thing; it attaches [to them] without eff ect; its relationship to them is like the relationship of knowl-edge to its object. [Human power] merely attaches to its object in the locus for which it is created (bi-mahalliha) and does not go beyond its locus; there is no relationship between [the empowered act] and [human power], whether of eff ect or of anything else.You know that the Mu‘tazila say that a person produces (yakhtari‘u) his own acts, although they agree with us that the originated power does not attach directly to anything except the empowered act, which is in the locus of the origi-nated power, although they think that in the locus there is a cause that brings into existence something outside the locus of human power. Th ey claim that the cause and the thing that is caused are both objects of human power at the same time, one directly and the other through the mediation of the cause.

Th is does not contradict what we said earlier about the acknowledgment of secondary causes. Th ey took this teaching from the philoso-phers concerning natural causes, according to what was said earlier, that nature (al-tabi‘a) has an eff ect on its object,12 as long as no impediment exists to pre-12.

So the Mu‘tazila took this teaching and called it generation [of secondary eff ects] (tawallud). Th ey did not place secondary causes (al-sabab al-muwallad) on the same plane as rational causes (al-‘ illa ’ l-‘aqliyya), because an impediment may prevent a secondary eff ect.14 Th ey also changed the expression, so the source of their teaching would not be obvious; they said it is the act of the one who has produced the secondary cause.If this were true, it could not produce a result, because a single eff ect cannot result from two causes (mu’aththirayn); of necessity, the eff ect of the cause on it prevents the eff ect of the power [that produced the cause] on it. To say that the person aff ects it by means of a secondary cause defl ects the result of what is said, as has already been demonstrated, to mean that it is the act of its cause. Likewise, according to them, the exalted Creator [279] [does not produce]15 human acts; rather, people produce their own acts, and their acts are not acts of God Most High, because they do not allow the attribution of human acts that are evil to Him. Th eir assertion of secondary causation compels them toward the very thing from which they were fl eeing, namely that, according to their teaching, a second-ary eff ect is the act of the one who produced its cause.One cannot say that the Mu‘tazila were all in agreement concerning second-ary causes, since al-Nazzam, who was one of them, attributed secondary eff ects to the glorifi ed Creator, not in the sense that He did them, but in the sense that He created bodies according to natures and characteristics that require the origina-tion of temporally produced eff ects arising from those natures and characteris-tics. He did not say that they are the act of the person who produced their cause.Hafs al-Fard16 said that [a secondary eff ect] occurs as a construct of the locus of [human] power and is determined by the choice of the person who produced 13. Th e text reads al-ahkam li-dhawatiha, but I believe this should be li-ahkam li-dhawatiha.14. A primary cause necessarily produces its eff ect, but this is not the case with secondary causes.15.

Some said that it remains determined (maqdur) by the orig-inal act as long as the occurrence of something that is produced by the act is a cause that necessitates the occurrence of the eff ect; aft er this point, the eff ect of [human] power ceases. Others said that it only ceases to be determined [by the original act] when the secondary eff ect occurs and comes into existence, not when only the cause [of the secondary eff ect] occurs.Th ey also disagree concerning whether human color and foods can be sec-ondary eff ects of human acts. Th umama b. Ashras said that these secondary eff ects are acts without an actor, but that would nullify proof for the affi rmation of the Maker.18 Mu‘ammar, the author of Al-Ma‘ani, said that all accidents occur in the natures of bodies, except will.According to them, there are four types of secondary eff ects: force (i‘timad), proximity (mujawara), refl ection (nazar) that generates knowledge, and fragmen-tation (waha’), which is the separation of generated parts due to pain (ift iraq al-ajza’ al-mutawallida li-’ l-alam). Al-Jubba’i and his son [Abu Hashim] disagreed on whether the secondary eff ect is the force or the movement [produced by the act]; al-Jubba’i favored the latter, and his son [280] the former. According to the Mu‘tazila, forces are due to the pull of muscles and the strength of the connection of nerves to limbs. All this is from the teaching of the naturalists (al-tabayi‘in).Th e result of the foregoing is that they disagree on the cause of pain. Some say it results from a force of one thing on another through a blow or cutting. Abu Hashim leaned toward this but then turned against this idea and settled on the answer that force produces the separation of parts, and he called this separation 17. Th at is, slaughter is caused by bloodletting, which is caused by cutting; the person who cuts produces the cause of slaughter, and the slaughter is his act.18.

Th e same question arises concerning foods that are prepared by cooking, or drinks and pastes (ma‘ajin) that are prepared from several ingredients, or other such things that are described in medical books. One of the things that makes them say that colors are secondary eff ects from human acts is that if the juice produced from fresh, ripe dates is stirred in a natiq, which is the vessel [used for this], as is done for all juices, its color changes only when it is stirred. Most do not accept this as a secondary eff ect of human action. A small group of the Mu‘tazila of Baghdad and Basra said that it is a secondary eff ect by extension, through analogy (li-qiyasihim).Th e Mu‘tazila also disagreed about whether or not it is possible for the acts of the glorifi ed and exalted Creator to generate secondary eff ects. One group said no, because the power of the Most High is eff ective over the generality of all things. Another group said it is possible, because one cannot exclude the possibility that something that can occur from God Most High will produce a secondary cause that in turn produces an eff ect, unless there is an impediment; the issuance of a secondary cause is not an impediment, unless that is evident, so it must produce a secondary eff ect. Th at is a summary of what they say about secondary causation.[281] Section 6: Against the Generation of Secondary Eff ectsYou know from the foregoing, by decisive proof (al-burhan al-qat‘i), that all orig-inated things depend on the Creator, and that there is no eff ect from anything but Him on anything, whether in whole or in part.

Th ere is no harm in our indicating some of the corollaries that necessarily derive from their insistence on the existence of an eff ect from two things, namely originated power and the act empowered by it, which is the secondary cause, because they claim that the secondary eff ect is produced of necessity once the secondary cause exists, and that the secondary eff ect is the act of the person who did the original act through originated power. Th is teaching leads to the absurd conclusion that there can be an act without a doer who willed it or feels that he has done it.If a person shoots an arrow and he falls down dead before it reaches its tar-get, but then it reaches it and hits a living person, who is wounded by it, who con-tinues to experience pain until he fi nally dies, for example, this bleeding (sariyat) and the pains [according to the Mu‘tazila] are the deeds of the one who shot the arrow, whose bones had [perhaps] already disintegrated (cf. al-Juwayni 1950, 233; al-Juwayni 2000, 127). Th ere is no absurdity greater than attributing a killing to a dead man, given the elimination of what is required for the dead person to act; otherwise, there would be no proof for the existence of an act when the doer is alive. Th e existence of an act when there is no one to do it makes it impossible to formulate a proof for the existence of a Maker from the existence of originated things. Even if they say that the act does indicate an actor, their teaching does not require the existence of an actor at the time that the act takes place.Th e correct response is that an act must be attributed to an actor, and its issuance (suduruhu) cannot be attributed to a person at a time that he cannot act, since its issuance from him requires that his condition be [suffi ciently] sound [to perform the act], and prevention (al-imtina‘) eliminates soundness. Th is also requires that the death which follows the pains be a secondary eff ect from the one who caused the pain. To attribute to the shooter what happens to the victim aft er the pains that occur as a consequence of his act is tantamount to attributing the subsequent death to him. As has already been stated, they have no way to avoid this. Al-Jubba’i had no way to avoid this and had the audacity to rend the consen-sus of the umma by attributing the victim’s death to the shooter who caused the pain, whereas the umma agrees [282] that the glorifi ed Creator is the One Who gives life and death. Al-Jubba’i said the giver of death is someone else. If a person can give death, then he must also be able to give life, as that is the opposite of giv-ing death, and according to the Mu‘tazila power is over a thing and its opposite. Th ey argue that secondary eff ects must be attributed to the person who did the"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"264 • Kitab Ma‘alim al-Dinoriginal act, if these eff ects accord with the person’s intention and motive, just like the act that is directly caused by originated power.Th e response to them is that events follow others according to [God’s] habit (bi-hasab majra ’l-‘ada); their habitual sequence does not prove that one of these events has an eff ect on the other.22 If this is rejected, then the root, to which one makes an analogy, and the branch, which is the thing being compared [to the root], are of equal value, falling upon the lack of proof for secondary eff ects, according to most scholars.Another thing that contradicts their doctrine is their argument that we fi nd that things happen according to motives and intentions. [Th rough this argu-ment] they have helped us to prove that there is no secondary causation. Some examples [the Mu‘tazila give to prove that secondary eff ects occur according to human motives and intentions] are satiation and quenching of thirst when we eat or drink; illness, health and death, according to most of the Mu‘tazila; the heat produced from rubbing one body forcefully against another; the sparks fl y-ing from a fi resteel when it is struck; the understanding of speech; the feeling of embarrassment or fear when speech is understood; and causing someone to feel embarrassed or afraid [when one speaks] (cf. al-Juwayni 1950, 234; al-Juwayni 2000, 128). Some of them say that satiation, quenching of thirst and heat are sec-ondary eff ects produced [of necessity] by their causes, though most of them do not say this, and they are those who are right (wa-’ l-muhassilin min-hum).Th is fi rst group alleges that bodies can be produced by secondary causes, although they are not, according to consensus, the type of thing that can be pro-duced by human power. Th is is because if the fl ying of sparks from a fi resteel when it is struck is a secondary eff ect, because it occurs according to human intention, then all other bodies should be able to generate such eff ects, because they are comparable. If they claim that the fi re was hidden within the body, which then moved, and that the cause of the secondary eff ect was the movement of the body, not the existence of a body, no rational person could accept this, for there is nothing in fl int or a fi resteel before they are struck. Likewise, if one cuts 22. For example, God is in the habit of creating wetness of ground aft er creating the falling of raindrops.

Like-wise, a physician may treat a sick person so he might recover, and he may [not] recover.24 Likewise, one may strike something with the aim of producing a spark, but it is possible that no spark will be produced. Th e same applies with trying to make someone understand or feel embarrassed or afraid, and with the heat pro-duced from rubbing. So the eff ect is not caused by these things.One should say to them: It has thus been established that there can be no extending (itrad) the eff ects of human power in the examples you have given, like shooting, wounding, lift ing and carrying a heavy body, and other things that are in dispute. Concerning shooting, a person shoots and sometimes hits his mark, and sometimes does not; the wound may bleed, or it may heal without bleeding. A person who wishes to lift and carry something may succeed in doing so some-times, and not succeed other times.Th e teaching of the Mu‘tazila concerning the movement of heavy things is that a heavy thing is moved to the right and to the left , not by pushing against it and lift ing it, or, if someone wishes, lift ing it and carrying it. Th ey disagreed concerning this: the earlier Mu‘tazila said that the pushing that moves it to the right and to the left then lift s it upward, but [Abu] Hashim and his followers said that is incorrect; rather, more movements are needed besides those that move it to the right and left , because what we depend on to produce a secondary eff ect is what we feel from the process, according to our motives and intentions,25 and 23. According to Lane (1863–1893), markh is a certain kind of tree that quickly emits fi re, has no leaves or thorns, and grows in small water-courses and hard grounds. Wooden instruments for producing fi re were made from it. He identifi es its Latin name as Cynanchum viminale.24. “Not” does not appear in the published text.25.

Al-Ka‘bi and ‘Abbad al-Day-mari26 and their followers said that each one carries parts not carried by the others, and that no two people share in carrying a single part. Other Mu‘tazila said that [284] each one of them aff ects each part, resulting in sharing. Th is is the teaching of most of them, but what they all say on both issues is false.If we hold to the true teaching, which is to nullify the principle of secondary causation and to say that all contingent things depend a priori on God Most High, then there is no problem. If we accept it for the sake of argument, the teaching of the earlier scholars on the fi rst issue is false by what Abu Hashim said, though what he says is also wrong, because it entails the conjoining of two comparable things (ijtima‘ al-mithlayn), because he said that there must be more movements, which is impossible. For the sake of argument, we may accept the possibility that two comparable things may be conjoined, but one should say to him: If the lift er produces one movement in t his heav y object, it cannot be lift ed except by mov ing it, for the person must undertake a movement in a body while it remains at rest (sakin) in its location (bi-hayyizihi). Th at would nullify the reality of the move-ment, because movement requires expulsion (tafrij), which is impossible. So the stipulation of more movements in an upward direction, in such a manner that it is moving in all directions, is a stipulation of something that will happen without stipulating it, which negates the reality of the stipulation.As for their disagreement on the second problem concerning a group car-rying a heavy object, if each one of them carries it independently, someone who held the fi rst opinion, according to which no part is carried by any particular one of the carriers, or it is unclear [which of them is carrying it], said to ‘Abbad: “If it is unclear [which of them is carrying it], then it would be impossible to lift the part concerning which there is no clarity, because the meaning of its lack of clarity is that it is taken up as a whole, or rather that the eff ect is on any one of its parts, not this particular part.

If it is taken in only one of its individual parts, then the thing is nonexistent and is not a thing, in which case it could not be lift ed. If the eff ect on it is particular to that part, it is also impossible to lift a particular part of it; it is no better than specifying any other part, because if the outcome is that it is receptive by itself, the carrying is of all the parts, so in what sense can one part be taken [285] by itself without any other? Th at is because if the carrying of none of the bearers is independent of that of the whole group, the aspect of specifying the part that is carried becomes clear, for example, if it is something that follows its head, because one cannot carry more than it. It would be similar for another part. Th e other, unlike what can be carried independently, has no way of being specifi ed in that case.” When he said this to ‘Abbad, [the lat-ter] said, “I don’t know how one can specify the part you mentioned.”One should say to those who hold the second opinion: Is the secondary eff ect of the act of one of the bearers the same as the secondary eff ect of the act of another of them, or not? If so, a single eff ect would be caused by two things, which is impossible. If not, then the lift ing of the body is accomplished by one of them, in which case the addition of the others is pointless. So those who say this are delivering a purely fantastical judgment.One should say to those who say that the eff ect of each one of them is on each part: Concerning the secondary eff ect on this part from the act of Zayd, for example, is it the same as the secondary eff ect from the act of ‘Amr? In other words, is the lift ing caused by Zayd the same as the lift ing caused by ‘Amr, or is there an eff ect on this piece from one person’s lift ing of it, and another eff ect from another person’s lift ing of it? In the fi rst case, a single eff ect would result from two causes, and in the second case the lift ing of the body is by only one of the two eff ects.If you look in the books of jurisprudence written by our companions, you will fi nd that they speak of secondary eff ects in some matters of jurisprudence, but not in matters of doctrine, because to believe in that is pure fantasy, leading to bewilderment and corruption, because the outcome is the necessity of positing a single eff ect existing between two causes, and the existence of an act without an actor, or an actor who has no will or sense of what he has done, or other such impossibilities discussed here at length."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"268 • Kitab Ma‘alim al-Din[286] Section 7: God Is Not Obligated To Do What Is BestWe have already said that the glorifi ed and exalted God created human beings, and created their acts, and created reward and punishment for those acts, with-out any requirement on the Most High to do what is good or best for them.

Likewise, He imposes on whomever He wishes inde-scribable types of torment, not in order to relieve His anger or because of some harm He has suff ered from the person.Th ese acts are indications to us of the existence of the Glorifi ed One, as has been explained. If He were obligated to do what is good for human beings, He would not have imposed obligations on them. Nor is He obligated to do what is best for them; if that were so, He would not have created the infi del or the poor person, because it would be better for them not to be created, rather than be tormented in this world and the next. It would be best for human beings if He created them in Paradise.In general, if God were obliged to do what is best, He would not test people at all. Al-Ash‘ari debated this point with al-Jubba’i.27 If you know that all acts are equal with respect to God Most High, that He freely chooses whatever He does (wa-annahu mukhtar fi jami‘ iha), and that nothing is rationally obligatory for Him and that the sayings of our companions concerning the necessity of reward 27. Th is refers to the famous example of three brothers that al-Ash‘ari allegedly put to his teacher, al-Jubba’i, in order to point out the fl aws in the Mu‘tazilite doctrine that God must do what is best for His creatures. Watt (1973, 305) pointed out that the story is likely apocryphal, because al-Jubba’i, unlike his predecessors among the Basran Mu‘tazila, denied that God must do what is best, and by al-Ghazali’s citation of this story as a criticism of Mu‘tazilism, without saying that it had previously been used by al-Ash‘ari."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"What Is Possible Concerning the Most High • 269and punishment point only to a necessity required by His wisdom, then you know the impossibility that any act of the Most High be for a purpose (li-gharad), because if He had a purpose in doing something, it would not be obligatory for Him, and as long as there is no purpose that causes it, then the words “Your Lord creates and chooses what He pleases” (Q 28:68) become understandable.Furthermore, [if an act of God had a] purpose, it would either be eternal, which would necessitate the eternity of the act, whereas its origination has already been proven, or [God’s purpose] would be originated, in which case it would depend on another purpose, and there would be an infi nitely regressing series of purposes, which would result in originated things that have no begin-ning, and [287] we have already proved that such a notion is false.Furthermore, the purpose would either be a benefi t to Him or to the person, both of which are impossible. Concerning the fi rst, that would necessarily mean describing His exalted essence by originated things, and that there is a defi ciency in His essence that is perfected by His act. Th e second alternative [must also be rejected], because of the lack of obligation on Him to do what is good or best, and because the person’s goal is simply to obtain pleasure or to repel pain, and God Most High is able to make that benefi t reach the person without the media-tion of an act. It would also mean that a thing is caused by itself or [by another cause, which is then caused by another cause, resulting in] an infi nitely regress-ing series of causes, because [otherwise] the implication would be that this ben-efi t is for itself.We demonstrate this by saying: What is the thing that makes the creation of that benefi t necessary, or that it must come into existence by means of an act? If someone says, “Because it is a benefi t,” this requires that a thing be caused by itself, because it becomes its own goal. If someone says, “For an additional purpose,” we have already written a response to this, that this would require an infi nite series of causes, and that the meaning of the purpose include the act, according to a wisdom that rationally impels its coming into existence in such a way that it would mean a defi ciency if He did not do it, so He is required to do the act.Alternatively, the act has no purpose or cause; rather, the act is not obliga-tory for Him, because that would mean that something has overpowered Him and that He has no choice, as we explained earlier.

So it is wrong to say that any one of His acts has a purpose that leads Him to do it. Th e Most High said, “Your Lord creates and chooses what He pleases” (Q 28:68).Just as you know the necessity of denying that the acts of the Most High have a purpose, you must also know the necessity of denying this regarding His laws (ahkamihi). What the scholars of jurisprudence say concerning the motives for laws (‘ ilal al-ahkam, ration legis) is simply a way of saying that the imposition of the law confers a benefi t (huwa bi-’ l-ja‘ l al-shar‘ i tafaddulan), not to say that there is a rational motive (la bi-’ l-hukm al-‘aqli) to which the law is responding. Th ere-fore, in discussions of the motives for laws, like that of Ibn al-Hajib, who said that “motive” can mean the impetus (al-ba‘ith) for a law, what he meant is the impetus for the person who must follow this law, [288] not the impetus for the Most High in commanding obedience to it.Likewise, concerning expressions in the Qur’an and Sunna that can give the impression that they are speaking of causation (al-ta‘ lil) in the sense of purpose (al-aghrad), as in the words of the Most High, “I only created jinn and people so that they might worship Me” (51:56), the lam [translated here as “so that”] is placed there only to indicate the outcome (al-sayrura wa-’ l-‘aqiba).28 Like it are His words, “So he might be an enemy and a sorrow to them” (28:8).29 Or it can be placed like a guarantor of a loan, in accordance with what was said elsewhere.Th e Mu‘tazila who accept the idea of purposes that necessitate [God’s acts] and judgments give a specious argument when they say, “If an act or judgment occurs without a purpose, then what issues from it is necessarily foolish and futile, but the Most High is wise, so that is impossible for Him. Th erefore, it is impossible for Him to act or make a judgment without a purpose.”We say there is no necessity [of folly and futility when acts and judgments are without purpose], because folly, according to custom, is an expression of igno-rance of what is benefi cial and of weak-mindedness.

As for futility, this is customarily applied to an act that is done in bewilderment and aimlessness (‘adam al-qasd). None of this has any necessary relationship with the denial of purpose (nafy al-gharad), because we say that the glorifi ed Creator has no purpose in anything He does, although all His acts accord with His knowledge and will, and nothing we do can harm Him (la yalhaquhu darar min qibalina), nor do His deeds renew His perfection. Indeed, He is the One who has no need of anything for His essence or His perfections, from all eternity and forevermore. Th e wisdom attributed to the Most High is an expression of His knowledge of things and His ability to strengthen (ihkamiha) and perfect them (itqaniha). Th ese require knowledge and power, not purposeful action.Concerning whether His wisdom and creating are attributes or actions, I dis-cussed this in the commentary.30 If you understand this regarding the acts of the Most High, then understand His laws in a similar way, for they also accord with His knowledge, and no defi ciency in them reaches Him (la yatatarraqu ilayhi min qibaliha naqs), regardless of how it appears to His servants. If the Mu‘tazila inter-pret folly and futility as purposeless, we can, for the sake of argument, accept [289] this, but we reject exceptionalism (mana‘na ’l-istithna’iyya). In sum, we reject the application of these two words to this affi rmation with regard to the Most High because they have a meaning that is impossible for Him, although, as we said, they customarily indicate this, not because they indicate a denial of purpose, as they say.Note: Know that the Mu‘tazila say that God must do what is good and best for His servants.

Th ere is, therefore, no room for the mind to understand any of God’s laws, for they have no cause (sabab), as you know. So what is good accord-ing to the Shari‘a pertains only to what they are commanded to do (illa ma qila fi -hi if ‘aluhu). Likewise, nothing is bad except what is prohibited (illa ma qila la taf ‘aluhu), as has already been explained.Th e Mu‘tazila say that voluntary acts are rationally good or bad, and that some of them are necessarily understood by the mind, like the goodness of benefi cial truthfulness and faith, and the evil of harmful lying and unbelief, and that others are not rationally comprehensible through refl ection, like the goodness of telling the truth [290] when it brings harm, and the evil of telling a benefi cial lie, and others that cannot be understood without the teaching of the law, like the good-ness of fasting on the last day of Ramadan, and the evil of fasting on the fi rst day of Shawwal.

Another group of them distinguished between evil and good by saying that evil is bad because of its attribute (li-sifatihi), whereas good is good because of its essence (li-dhatiha). Th eir proof is that all essences are equal, and the distinction between them is only because of their attributes, so if a deed were bad because of its essence, its evil would attach to the Most High. Al-Jubba’i and his followers said that the mind approves and disapproves [of an act] because of an aspect (wajh) and consideration (i‘tibar), so the beating of an orphan is approved if it is for purposes of discipline, and disap-proved if it is for some other reason.Th e refutation of all this is in what was said earlier: that human beings have no eff ect on any aspect of their acts, so their obligation or prohibition are not good because of human reason. Th e laws of the Shari‘a are all based on the fact that these deeds are commanded because they entail reward or punishment, or do not entail reward or punishment, as has already been explained. If deeds were described as good or bad because of their essences or because of a necessary attri-bute, God would not have ordered the unbelievers to believe, and this last is false by consensus.Th e clarifi cation of the dependence (al-mulazama) [of judgment concerning acts on God’s will alone] is that the Most High knew that the unbeliever would not believe, so to order him to believe is to order him to do the impossible, which is bad [from the perspective of human reason]. Furthermore, if a deed is good or bad because of its essence or because of a necessary attribute, it would never vary, sometimes being good and sometimes being bad, or else opposites would be conjoined, as if somebody says, “Tomorrow I will tell a lie,” which could be either true or false. [291] In other words, if his saying this is good, because he told the truth, but it is [also] bad, because it necessarily entails the occurrence of its corol-lary, telling a lie, which is bad.

So in what he said the second day what is good and what is not good (al-hasan wa-’ l-la hasan)32 are conjoined, and that is the conjoining of opposites. In the second case [if he tells the truth on the second day], the goodness of what he said on the second day attaches to him, because he told the truth, and its evil attaches to him because he told a lie on the fi rst day, so two opposites are conjoined. Th is conjoining of opposites occurs in the fi rst three [Mu‘tazilite] opinions, but not in the fourth, [that of al-Jubba’i and his followers,] because in this case a deed is not simultaneously being described as good and bad, but through diff erent con-siderations, for example, the conjoining of paternity and prophethood in a single person through two distinct attributions.Section 9: Divine Law Has No Rational FoundationTh e corruption of the Mu‘tazilite doctrine that the laws of the Shari‘a concerning human acts can be rationally discerned, even without a prophetic mission, can also be clarifi ed by admitting, for the sake of argument, the principle of the ratio-nal necessity of deeming something good or evil because of the contradiction between diff erent perspectives, in order that the corruption of their opinion on this matter may become manifest. If we consider gratitude to the Most High for His blessings on us before the coming of the law, according to them reason would make gratitude to [292] the Most High obligatory, without requiring the coming of a lawgiver, because knowledge of the Most High and the knowledge that He bestows blessings are rationally comprehended without the law, as are the good-ness of thanking the One who bestows blessings and the evil of ingratitude to 32.

But the affi rmation of a benefi t before the coming of the Shari‘a is absurd, because either its benefi t goes to the person who gives thanks, or to the Lord Who is thanked. If it goes to the person, the benefi t is either imme-diate or postponed, or all the allotments [of benefi t] are void. Th e falseness of its going to the person immediately is because the immediate impact on him is only fatigue. Th e falseness of its going to him later is because, according to consensus, the intellect had no ability to understand the aff airs of the aft erlife before the coming of the law. Th e falseness of its going to the Lord Most High is because He transcends any renewal of His perfection; indeed, in His essence He has no need of people and their deeds. Th is point of view is rational and repels the obligation of giving thanks and contradicts their point of view which makes it obligatory, which is the comprehension that the Most High bestows blessings.If they say, “We do not accept that there is no benefi t to giving thanks before the coming of the Law; indeed, there is a benefi t to the person, and that is safety from the punishment that could be imposed for turning away from giv-ing thanks,” we say that likewise it is possible for the act of giving thanks to be punished, for two reasons:First, he has caused fatigue to someone who belongs to God Most High and has done this without His permission. In this he is like someone who thanks a king who has enabled him to receive a blessing, in that he causes the king’s ser-vant fatigue by giving thanks for it without his permission. Th ere is no doubt that by thanking the king for this blessing, he has exposed himself to punishment.[293] Second, it is a matter of an extremely generous king giving him a little piece of barley bread, for example, while he has treasure-houses of diff erent types of food and infi nite wealth, and it would not diminish him in any way for him to give him from his stores. Th en that poor, needy person mentions the king and praises him in social gatherings for giving him this piece of barley bread. He would deserve punishment from the king for mocking him and thinking little of him, making him out to be a coward by praising him for something that imposes no burden on him at all.

So it is clear to you by this that for reason to enter into the laws of God Most High concerning acts with the scale of approval and disap-proval is to enter with a faulty scale that will make its owner turn back exhausted.If you say, “All this clashes with what you have affi rmed before from the teach-ing of your imams, who agree with the doctrine of the Mu‘tazila,” I say, as for its clashing with it, you are right; what I have affi rmed here is the teaching of the company of our companions, as well as the Ash‘arites. As for the teaching of some of our imams being the same as that of the Mu‘tazila, this is incorrect, as I have already explained, because of the evident diff erence between the two schools: the Mu‘tazila say that the judge is reason and that the law is an affi rmation of rational judgment, and that it does not bring anything that diff ers from this, whereas the teaching of those imams is that judgment belonged to reason before the coming of the law, but aft er it comes, the law is the foundation, and it may bring something that does not accord with human reason. So there is a diff erence.Another thing that demonstrates the denial of the principle that good and bad can be rationally known is that we say, regarding someone with respect to whom all acts are equal, that nothing he does can be deemed good or bad. Acts are equal with respect to the Creator; nothing He does can be deemed good or bad, because if an act is deemed good, this requires a preference for doing it over [294] not doing it, and if it is deemed bad, this requires a preference for abandon-ing it over doing it, but deeming them equal negates any preference. Th is is why we said previously that what is preferred in contingent things is simply whatever the Most High wills.Th e demonstration (bayan) that all acts are equal with respect to Him is that the Glorifi ed One transcends benefi t and harm. If we are able to do something that causes us no harm, and if by not doing it no benefi t escapes us, then there are no repercussions from our doing it or not doing it. All acts with respect to the Most High are like this supposed act with respect to us. Furthermore, if all acts were not equal with respect to Him, it would be better for Him to bring them into existence than not to bring them into existence, which would lead to His perfection being due to His acts, and you know that He is perfect in His essence and in His attributes, which are the same as His essence, not by His acts.
