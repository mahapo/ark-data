This revival has been marked by the appearance of an increasing number of articles in various journals as well as by three major works on the Ikhwan by European authors in French, German and Italian: La Philosophie des fbwan al-Safo' (1975) by Yves Marquet, Arabische Philosophie und Wissenschafi in der Enzyklopiidie Kitab lbwan a�-�afo' (Ill): Die Lehre von Seele und Intellekt (1975) by Susanne Diwald, and L 'Enciclopedia dei Fratelli della Pun\"ta (1978) by Alessandro Bausani (see Bibliography for publication details). A significant point in this renaissance of Ikhwan studies was the symposium on the Ikhwan al-Safa' held in Rome at the Palazzo Corsini on 25 and 26 October 1979 under the auspices of the Fondazione Leone Caetani of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, at which I was privileged to read a paper beside the three scholars mentioned above. It seems likely that the interest thus generated in the Rasa 'il will continue and this book in English is an attempt to complement, in a small way, the three volumes to which I have already referred. To the best of my knowledge there exists no modern work in English devoted entirely to a study of the philosophy of the Ikhwan al-Safa', though perhaps Seyyed Hossein Nasr has come closest to this with his book entitled An Introduction to Islamic Cosmologi­cal Dottrines, the first third of which deals with the Ikhwan (see Bibliography). These Ikhwan al-Safa' are as well known to an educated Arab as, say, the names of Descartes, Hegel and Wittgenstein are to the cultured European. This book is an introduction to their thought: it makes no claims to be comprehensive or to cover every facet of the Ikhwan's doctrine but seeks only to introduce the reader to some aspects of that doctrine. I hope that it will be useful not only to students of Arabic literature and Islamic philosophy but also to students of Western philosophy and theology who require some illustration of how the West has encountered the East on the stage"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"X MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS ofNeoplatonic thought.

Their subject matter is vast and ranges from mathematics, music and logic, through mineralogy, botany and embryology, to philosophical and theological topics which are concluded by a treatise on magic. It is small wonder that many scholars, with only a few notable exceptions, have preferred to avoid textual exploration and exegesis; indeed, as one scholar points out, most previous research has been concerned instead with a positive identification of the authors of the Rasa 'il and a definitive dating of their work. 2 These interlocked themes of authorship and dating have been the source of frequent speculation over the years, and continue both to tantalise and to irritate: for The Epistles of the Brethren of Purity (Rasa'i/ lkhwlm al-Safo') remain one of the great works of Arabic literature about whose authors we know hardly anything. It is admitted that the epistles were written by a group of philosophers who called themselves Ikhwan al-Safa', and tradi­tionally agreed that this group lived in the Lower Mesopotamian river port of Ba�ra during the tenth or eleventh century AD. The rest must be conjecture. Arabic sources differ over their indi­vidual names and perhaps it is a successful measure of the secrecy which they sought for themselves in their age that we know so little about their lives in our own. Like the deserted camp of the beloved in early Arabic poetry, the traces of their passage have become faint and shadowy."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS Their written legacy, however, is much more tangible: it com­prises a total offifty-twoRasa 'if addressed to their associates, each commencing with such characteristic phrases as 'Know, 0 brother .. .'3 or, much more rarely, 'Know, 0 brethren .. .'.4 It is dear that an extra epistle (risala) was added later for the text contains several assertions that the number of Rasa 'if is fifty-one.5 Indeed, the fifty-second and last Risala, which deals with magic and kindred subjects, numbers itself as 51 in one place6 and refers to only fifty Rasa 'if having preceded it. 7 Yet, underneath its chap­ter heading, it is correctly numbered as 52!8 It has been suggested that the obvious predilection for the number fifty-one, which is seventeen multiplied by three, may be linked with the numerical symbolism of the alchemist Jibir b. l:layyan, who appears to have flourished in the eighth century AD: the Ikhwan wrote seventeen Rasa 'if on the natural sciences and seventeen was considered to be a key figure in the Jabirean corpus.'1 The Rasa 'if are divided into four main sections, comprising fourteen Rasa 'if on Mathematical Sciences, seventeen on Natural Sciences, ten on Psychological and Rational Sciences, and eleven on Theological Sciences. A central feature of the whole work is a lengthy debate between man and a variety of representatives of the animal kingdom, which occupies a large part of Risala 22 entitled On How the Animals and their Kinds are Formed.10 Separate from this group of fifty-two is a further Risiila, which seems to have been intended as a conclusion, entitled 'The Summary' (al­Risalat al-Jami'a).11 The authorship of this has been the subject of some dispute, and, indeed, has been falsely attributed to al­Majriti (died c. 1008);12 but in view of the similar vocabulary, phraseology, and other resemblances it is highly unlikely that its authorship differs from that of the Rasa 'if. The Ikhwan discuss the Jami'a briefly in their list of contents (Fihrist)13 and claim that its purpose is the clarification of the truths which have been alluded to in the other fifty-two Rasa 'i/.14 The lock of these epistles cannot be opened except by careful study, and it is only after such careful study that one is entitled to read the Jami'a.15 The reader is thus led to expect a work of considerable clarity; but the Jami'a does not, in fact, fulfil its promise nor its final self-designation as 'the crown of the Rasa 'i/'16 to any large extent, for the work is neither exhaustive nor com­prehensive. Much esotericism remains, 17 as well as much repeti­tion. It lacks most of the anecdotes and didactic storytelling of the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE IKHWAN AL-SAFA' AND THEIR 'RASA'IL 3 fifty-two Rasa 'if, despite the other similarities which have been mentioned, and it is also overladen with Qur'anic quotation to an oppressive degree not found in these fifty-two. It seems fairly certain that the Rasa 'if were the product of meetings (maja/is) convened by the Brethren for the purpose of philosophical discussion. One author has aptly likened their con­tent to the draft of deliberations by a learned society composed by a well educated secretary, 18 and this could be very close to the truth: the authors of the Rasa 'if insist that their Brethren hold special meetings at set times, to which none but they are to be admitted, where their secrets and esoteric knowledge can be discussed in peace.19 Elsewhere it is suggested that such a meet­ing should take place every twelve days.20 There is an interesting similarity between these meetings held by the Ikhwan and the meetings attended by the faithful of the Isma'ili sect, during the Fatimid period in Egypt, which were held twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays for textual reading and study.21 It is certainly possible that the Rasa 'if could be the work of one author only, for there are significant lapses from the usual plural mode of address into the first person singular. 22 This single author has been identified as one of a range of possibilities which includes names as diverse as the previously mentioned al-Majriti, 'Ali (d. 661), Ja'far al-Sadiq (c. 70�65) and Jabir b. l:layyan (c. 721-c. 815), to cite just a few examples.23 Other scholars have preferred to view the Rasa 'if as a joint undertaking. Thus by the time of the German scholar Fliigel in the nineteenth century it was believed that the Ikhwan comprised a group of five thinkers who had formed a secret association in Ba:;ra and published their Rasa 'if. This concept of joint author­ship goes back to early Muslim sources such as al-Tawpidi (d. 1023)24 and some modern scholars such asS. M. Stern have accepted and reiterated these views.25 The arguments for and against the various names which have been put forward as the authors of the Rasa 'if have been discussed frequently elsewhere and will not be repeated here.26 For even when all the material has been surveyed 'we find ourselves confronted with many con­tradictory opinions among students of the subject'. 27 In this book the convention is adopted of referring to the authorship in the plural. An equally vexing problem has been that of fixing the date of composition of the Rasa 'if. A number of different ways"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 .\\IUSLI.\\1 NEOPLATONISTS of assessing this from internal evidence have been attempted. L. Massignon, for example, drew attention to the fragments of Arabic and Persian poetry in the text, and the definition of the trigonometrical sine, and suggested that this sort of evidence should be used to discover a date of composition.28 P. Casanova made use of astronomical data in a similar attempt;29 but his dating of the writing of the Rasa 'if of 418-27 AH (1027-35 AD) is rejected by Tibawi, who prefers 338-73 AH (949-83 AD).30 The disparity in dating between these two authors, whose articles are admittedly separated by forty years, only underlines the difficul­ties involved in hazarding even an approximate date which will accord with all the internal data of the Rasa 'if. As a consequence of the time devoted by scholars to dating and authorship, many equally important problems arising out of the Rasa 'if have been comparatively neglected or, at best, treated only cursorily. What was the precise relationship of the Ikhwan with the Isma'ili movement? How Islamically orthodox are the Rasa 'if? How have the Rasa 'if been influenced by Greek and other philosophies? All these questions, and others, posed by A. L. Tibawi, deserve an answer before we can begin to move away from his assessment of the subject of the Ikhwan al-Safa' as a field 'still bristling with a number of question-marks and interspersed with unexplored corners'.31 Certainly, answers should be found to at least a few of these problems, especially that of the influences, Greek and otherwise, before an attempt is made at a positive personal identification of the authors. Even the very name of the group, Ikhwan al-Safa', has not been free from controversy: it has led to the story of the ring-dove from Ibn al-Muqaffa' 's Kalifa wa Dimna assuming a particular impor­tance and significance in the Western history of the Rasa 'if. According to this story a ring-dove and her companions become caught in a fowler's net. They manage to fly with the net to a friendly rat who nibbles through the net to release them. A crow, who has witnessed and been impressed by the incident, befriends the rat, and later a tortoise and a gazelle join their company. One day the gazelle is caught in a net. His comrades combine to release him, the rat gnawing through the net. The slow tortoise, however, is caught by the huntsman. This time the gazelle acts as a decoy while the rat releases the tortoise and all four animals are saved.32 In an important chapter on the human's need for mutual help"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE IKHWA!'i AL-SAFA' AND THEIR 'RASA'IL 5 or cooperation (ta 'awun ), the Ikhwan urge the brother to consider the story of the ring-dove in Kalila wa Dimna, and how it was saved from the net, so as to realise the truth of what they have just said about mutual help.33 lgnaz Goldziher suggested that it was this story of the ring-dove which led the Ikhwan to adopt the name lkhwan al-Safa'.34 It is easy to see how this tale, with its emphasis on mutual help and friendship, the double usage of that favourite verb of the Ikhwan, to cooperate (ta'awana),35 the frequent meet­ing of the animals to exchange news,36 and the designation of these animals as lkhwan al-Safa',37 could have led Goldziher to regard the tale as the source of the Ikhwan's name. It is clear from the context in Kalila wa Dimna that �afo' means 'sincerity' rather than 'purity'. Thus the full name of the Ikhwan should be trans­lated as 'Brethren of Sincerity' rather than 'Brethren of Purity', if Goldziher were correct. His theory might have been plausible if the Ikhwan had described themselves only as Ikhwan al-Safa' without any further additions. But they did not. Their title is frequently elab­orated in Mu'tazilite, Isma'ili and Sufi terms not found in the story of the ring-dove in Kalila wa Dimna, which Goldziher's theory fails to explain. Examples include: 'lkhwan al-Safa' and Friends of Loyalty';38 'lkhwan al-Safa' and Friends of Loyalty and People of Justice and Sons of Praise';19 'lkhwan al-Safa' and Friends of Loyalty and People of Praise and Sons of Glory';40 'lkhwan al-Safa' and Friends of Loyalty and People of Justice and Sons of Praise and Lords of the Truths and Posses­sors of the Meanings';41 and 'lkhwan al-Safa' and Noble Friends' .42 Some of these names are formally cited at the begin­ning and ending of the Fih rist of the Rasa 'i/43 and might therefore be expected to be official names by which the Ikhwan liked to be known. There is a Mu'tazilite ring to the title 'People of Justice': the Mu'tazila liked to refer to themselves as 'People of Unity and Justice'. The phrase 'Possessors of the Meanings' is a likely reference to the doctrine of ba{in and :;;imir, expounded by the Isma'ili sect, in which bodies of scripture like the Qur'an had an exoteric and an esoteric meaning; while the title 'Lords of the Truths' could clearly have been coined by a Sufi. This is not to say that the Ikhwan embraced Mu'tazilism, Isma'ilism, or even Sufism fully. Their nomenclature does, however, seem to have been influenced by each of these groups. The phrase 'lkhwan al-Safa' ' has been variously translated by"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS orientalists and, indeed, variety has been the one consistent fea­ture of the translations. They have run the gamut from 'Brethren of Purity',44 'The Pure Brethren',45 'Sincere Brethren',46 and 'Sincere Friends'47 in English, to 'die lauteren Briider',48 'die treuen Freunde'4<J and 'die aufrichtigen Bruder und treuen Freunde',50 in German, back to 'les Freres de Ia Purete' in French. 51 The Ikhwan provide one clue to the real translation of their name in the Jami'a. Those who are unable to profit from logical proofs and signs are termed 'The Brethren of Turbidity and Misfortune' (lkhwan a/-Kadar wa '1-Shaqa'), who are 'the oppo­sites of Ikhwan al-Safa' and Friends of Loyalty. They are the Friends of lblis' .52 The contrast between 'turbidity' (a/-Kadar) and 'purity' (al-Safo ') is obvious and the latter word could not be translated as 'sincerity' here. Yet surely the clearest and most frequent clue to the fact that the real translation of 'lkhwan al-Safa' ' must be 'Brethren of Purity' is their emphasis throughout the Rasa 'if on the need for purity and purification before entering Paradise. The Ikhwan, after all, claimed to be men 'whose minds were pure';53 since they were specialists on the subject of mental and spiritual purity, they could with justification and insight address others on the same theme: When they reach this stage and achieve this position [of exalted knowledge, noble deeds and independence from others in their material needs], we are right to call them Ikhwan al-Safa'. Know, 0 brother, that the real truth (baqiqa) of this name is the special quality actually, not figuratively, inherent in those who are worthy of it. Know, 0 brother, may the most high God help you, that purity of soul only comes when the soul has reached a state of complete tranquillity in both religious and earthly affairs ... The man who is not thus cannot be counted as one of the People of Purity (Ahl al-Safo').54 Tibawi rather than Goldziher was therefore closer to the truth when he observed that the name 'lkhwan al-Safa' 'was chosen 'as an imitation of the Sufi tendency to associate their name with $afo (purity)'.SS The treasury of the Rasa 'if is an extraordinary work, not least because of a number of astonishing statements in it which seem to"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THE IKHWAN AL-SAFA' AND THEIR 'RASA'IL 7 have been generally accepted until now with hardly a passing comment or expansion, much less detailed examination. It is true that early Islam displayed tolerance towards those whom it called 'The People of the Book' (Ahl al-Kitab), a category which included Christians, Jews and, later, Zoroastrians. This attitude is epitomised in some verses of the Qur'an, a work which can appear quite favourably disposed towards the People of the Book, when it refrains from castigating their faults: 'And some there are of the People of the Book who believe in God, and what has been sent down unto you, and what has been sent down unto them, men humble to God, not selling the signs of God for a small price; those- their wage is with their Lord ... '.56 Yet the Ikhwan's statements seem to manifest a degree of tolerance and acceptance going far beyond the limited standards of early Islam; if argued to their logical conclusion they would result in heresy (bid'a). They appear to be deliberate policy decla­rations by the Ikhwan and as such deserve to be tested against the content of the rest of the Rasa 'i/ to see whether in fact these Rasa 'if lend some, or indeed any, substance to them, or whether they are isolated remarks with an ephemeral good-will value only. In these statements the Ikhwan affirm, and indeed urge, a total lack of hostility towards other branches ofknowledge and schools of thought (madhahib), and refuse to dissociate themselves from any book written by philosophers and wise men. This does not mean, however, that at the same time they abandon their depen­dence on the orthodox writings of the prophets, the revelation brought by the latter, and the inspiration which these prophets receive via the angels. Nevertheless, the Ikhwan's own views and particular school of thought embrace all schools of thought and unite all branches of knowledgeY These schools of thought and different religions exist as medicines and potions for the treatment of sick souls and - a favourite Platonic theme of the Ikhwan - their salvation from 'the sea of matter and the bondage of nature'.-\"8 As an aid to such seemingly deliberate eclecticism, the Ikhwan must therefore cultivate a comprehensive mastery of all branches of knowledge in their manifold external and internal aspects.59 What are we to make of all this? Does it mean that the Ikhwan adopted a policy of uncritical eclecticism and accepted every religion, dogma and philosophy as equally valid and authoritative?

It constitutes a fresh approach to the Rasa 'if Ikhwan al­Safa', unhampered by considerations of authorship and dating; and, by a critical study of the influences on their thought, it attempts to show what kind of philosophers the group of Ikhwan al-Safa' were, rather than to say who they were individually."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO 1he Legacy of Greece 1 PYTHAGORAS The Islamic conquests of the first centuries after the hijra brought the Muslim community a diverse philosophical heritage. Para­mount in this was the legacy of Greece. As a result of the increasing contacts oflslam with the Hellenistic world, the Greek luminaries of Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle began to rise in a new Islamic firmament. As their ideas became better known as a result of the impetus of medical scholarship and the desire for translated texts, they served to influence and inform much of the writing of the intellectuals and philosophers. Among those so influenced were the Ikhwan al-Safa'. The Rasa 'if of the Ikhwan are permeated throughout with the spirit of Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans. We know little of Pythagoras himself and he seems to have already become enveloped in legend by the fourth century BC, when Plato and Aristotle wrote. Both seem anxious to avoid mentioning him by name.1 Yet Aristotle remains our most important source for Pythagoras and early Pythagoreanism. He was certainly familiar with the corpus of doctrine which developed round 'the so-called Pythagoreans',2 which held that numbers and their properties could explain the whole creation and structure of the universe. Thus it is to him and, to a lesser extent, such hagiographers as the third-century AD Diogenes Laertius and Iamblichus (d. 326), rather than to Pythagoras himself, that reference must be made in the tracing of the Pythagorean elements in the writings of the Ikhwan. Aristotle noted that the Pythagoreans devoted themselves to the study of mathematics and were, indeed, the first to develop the subject. Their study led them to believe that mathematical prin-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"10 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS ciples were at the root of everything. Numbers constituted the fi.rst of these principles, and many resemblances were detected between numbers and material and spiritual phenomena; the whole universe was modelled on numbers.3 These Pythagorean sentiments are evident in the Rasa 'if in the stress laid by the Ikhwan on the importance of number. Again and again the Ikh­wah urge their fellows to acquire a good knowledge of the science of mathematics before proceeding to a study of the three higher sciences of logic, physics and divinity.4 They declare that the man who has .such a knowledge of number with its laws, nature, kinds and properties will obviously be familiar with the number of kinds of created things, together with the reason for their present qualities and why they are neither more nor less than they are.5 Citing the Pythagorean belief that the nature of created things accords with the nature of number,6 the lkhwan proclaim: 'This is the school of thought (madhhab) of our Ikhwan.'7 As well as sharing the belief that number was a prime principle in the universe and inextricably bound up with its structure, the Ikhwan also resembled the Pythagoreans in attaching a special significance and importance to certain numbers; in this they were by no means unique in their age, as they themselves realised.8 With the Pythagoreans the number four was sometimes justice because it was the fi.rst square number and divided equally; seven was opportunity, for man was 'born after seven months' and reached puberty around the age of fourteen, which is seven multiplied by two. The number fi.ve was marriage, being the union of the odd, which was regarded as male, and the even, which was considered female: fi.ve is the sum of the fi.rst even number, two, and the fi.rst odd number, three.9 Since the number ten was considered to be a perfect number embracing the whole essence of the system of numbers, the Pythagoreans claimed that the moving heavenly bodies added up to ten.10 Indeed, the number ten achieved a quasi-mystical status by being used in what was called the Tetraktus of the Decad. This Tetraktus was a group of ten dots which were arranged geometrically in the form of an equilateral triangle ( .. ::: .. ) and it was invoked as their most solemn oath.11 However, the number which seems to have been of paramount importance for the Ikhwan was the number four. Pythagoras is supposed to have divided man's life into four quarters, allocating twenty years to boyhood, twenty to youth, twenty to young man-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE I 11 hood, and twenty to old age, with these four periods correspond­ing to the four seasons; 12 but the Ikhwan went far beyond the Pythagoreans in their reverence for this number, and it holds a pre-eminent position of the Rasa 'if which is by no means confined to the purely mathematical sections of the work. Mathematical science itself is divided into the four parts of arithmetic, rep­resented by Pythagoras and Nicomachus; geometry, represented by Euclid; astronomy, represented by Ptolemy with his magnum opus, the Almagest; and music.13 This fourfold division of discip­lines, which derived from the Pythagorean school, was, of course, continued in the quadrivium of the Middle Ages. The Ikhwan arrange numbers in four groups of units, tens, hundreds and thousands, and compare them with the sixteen Pythagorean divisions. There are four ranks above the natural order consisting of Creator, Universal Intellect, Universal Soul and Prime Matter .14 Particular note is taken of the division of the year into its four traditional seasons; there are four winds and four principal directions of north, south, east and west. Frequent reference is made to the four Empedoclean elements of fire, air, water and earth as well as the four natures of heat, cold, dryness and dampness and the four humours of medieval medicine: yellow bile, black bile, phlegm and blood.15 The four strings of the lute correspond to the natural order of things16 while matter is divided into four different kinds.17 Even good and evil receive a fourfold division.18 Numerous other examples of groups of four exist in the Rasa 'if, ranging from the varieties of ignorance 1'� and the qualities of the soul to believers in the Qur'an20 and the kinds of created things.21 The reasons for the emphasis on the number four throughout the Rasa 'if are less clear than those for the emphasis of other symbolists, for example on the numbers nine, twelve, seven and twenty-eight which were equal to the number of spheres, zodiacal divisions, planets and lunar mansions and which were of major significance in the cosmologies and religions of the Babylonians, Hindus, and Egyptians as well as the Pythagoreans.22 The reason proffered by the Ikhwan is that the Creator made most things in groups of four and that natural matters are arranged in fours principally to correspond to, or harmonise with, the four spiritual principles which rank above them, consisting of the Creator, the Universal Intellect, the Universal Soul and Prime Matter.23 The anthologist John Stobaeus, who lived in the fifth century"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 \\IL'SLL'vl :\\EOPLATO.'\\ISTS AD, noted an identification by Pythagoras of certain numbers with various Olympian gods: for example, the number one was Apollo and the number tv.-,� was Artemis.24 However, such absolute identification of number with divine beings does not occur in the Rasa 'if. Here the lkhwan prefer to speak of number and God in comparative terms. God is said to have existed before the Univer­sal Intellect in the same way that the number one existed before two.25 Creatures grow and reach perfection from the emanation of the Creator and His generosity in the same manner that a number increases by the repetition of one. Just as two is the first number to be produced from the repetition of one, so the Univer­sal Intellect is the first created being to emanate from the Being of the Creator. The parallelism is continued, with the number three being compared to the Universal Soul and the number four being compared to ,\\1atter, until the thousands are reached, which are compared to the animals. The whole complex symbol is reduced to unity again in the phrase 'The mixture [of all] is like the one',26 which perhaps reflects the belief that all things are one in matter but many in form.27 Similarly, elsewhere, the ranks of created beings in the spirit world are said most to resemble the odd numbers while the even, whole and fractional numbers receive other metaphysical parallels.28 The lkhwan stressed that a good knowledge of number was very important as an aid to knowledge about God's unity and they asserted that Pythagoras said that the former led to the latter.29 Yet with all the emphasis which they placed on number they were able to avoid the cardinal error of the Pythagoreans, described by Aristotle, and make a clear distinction between a number and a thing numbered. Confusing the two, the Pythagoreans believed that not only could the whole universe be considered in terms of number but that it was actually number itself; indeed, 'they defined superficially, and supposed that the essence of a thing is that to which the term under consideration first applies-e.g. as if it were to be thought that \"double\" and \"2\" are the same, because 2 is the first number which is double another ... they hold that things themselves are numbers'.30 However, the lkhwan demon­strated their awareness of the distinction early in their exposition, stating plainly that the word 'number' indicated a quantity existing in the mind of the numberer whereas the numbered things were actual objects.31 The precise contribution of Pythagoras and his followers to the"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE I 13 development of musical theory remains in some doubt: J. A. Philip, for example, believes that 'there is no real evidence for the statement often made that Pythagoras \"discovered\" the numeri­cal relations obtaining in the musical scale'.32 Nonetheless, the theory of the harmony of the spheres and the idea that the planets and stars produced sounds when in motion was considered to be peculiarly Pythagorean: It seems to some thinkers [the Pythagoreans] that bodies so great must inevitably produce a sound by their movement: even bodies on the earth do so, although they are neither so great in bulk nor moving at so high a speed, and as for the sun and the moon, and the stars, so many in number and enormous in size, all moving at a tremendous speed, it is incredible that they should fail to produce a noise of surpassing loudness. Taking this as their hypothesis, and also that the speeds of the stars, judged by their distances, are in the ratios of the musical consonances, they affirm that the sound of the stars as they revolve is concordant.33 This notion of a musical firmament was adopted by the Ikhwi'm, who picturesquely believed that the movements of the stars pro­duced tunes like lutes. Their pure-souled hero Pythagoras is portrayed listening to the nocturnal harmonies resulting from such star movements.34 On a lower plane, however, music had a more utilitarian function-a charming aspect of early Pythagorean lore was a belief in the cathartic effect of music; it could be relied upon to purge or soothe the emotions. The Syrian Neoplatonist Iamblichus, in his biography of Pythagoras, relates how music was used to influence certain emotions and tells a number of stories which bear witness to its calming effects.35 These stories have parallels in the Rasa 'if: a beggar, for example, finds himself exalted above all other musicians because the skill of his playing is able to make his audience laugh, cry and sleep.36 The Ikhwan did not, however, endorse everything that was Pythagorean, or characterised as Pythagorean. They rejected, for example, the doctrine of the transmigration of the soul and emphasised the differences which existed between themselves and those who believed in it (ahl al-taniisukh or a$/Jiib al­taniisukh).37 Nonetheless, the concept of purification which accompanied this Pythagorean doctrine found an echo in the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"14 ,\\1USLIM NEOPLATONISTS emphasis which the lkhwan placed on the idea of purity of soul: the obvious example is the name which the group adopted for themselves, Ikhwan al-Safa'. Purity of soul was one of the attri­butes necessary for admission to Paradise38 and frequent Qur'anic quotations back up the Christian beatitude, whose mes­sage runs through the Rasa 'if, that the pure of heart shall see God. The Pythagoreans regarded purity as an essential element in their souls' long journeys of successive incarnations towards ultimate bliss and immortality: sin meant punishment and purification in a lower incarnation. Similarly, the Ikhwan, omitting the idea of transmigration, concluded that purity of soul achieved in this life was an infallible passport to Paradise. The concept has a stark simplicity which many of the Brethren must have found very attractive. Besides exhibiting concern for the welfare of the soul, the Ikhwan also believed that the body should maintain a correct balance during its 'career' as a prison for the soul, if it wished to be free from sickness. The physician Alcmaeon of Croton, who probably lived early in the fifth century BC, has been regarded by some scholars as not truly Pythagorean.39 Nevertheless, he probably came into contact with followers of Pythagoras, and Alcmaeon's doctrine of opposites, such as wet and dry, hot and cold, and sweet and bitter, which had to be kept in a harmonious balance for the preservation of health, became characterised as Pythagorean. This doctrine, elaborated into the theory of the four humours, influenced the whole of medieval medicine in both the East and the West, and it is not surprising that the Ikhwan should have shared it. Quoting in an encyclopedic strain from 'one [or some] of the books of the Jewish prophets', the Ikhwan describe how God in creating man put the four humours of black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm into his body to regulate it: black bile was made the seat of dryness, yellow bile the seat of heat, while dampness was given the blood as its domain, and coldness phlegm. While each maintained its correct proportions bodily health was preserved; but if one of them became greater than its fellows sickness entered the body.40 Such interest in the physical body by the basically ascetic lkhwan should not be considered strange. They regarded the human being as the most perfect and complete of all living things. Man contained within his body parallels to many of the created phenomena in the world.41 Since it was impossible for man to"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 1 15 know everything about the world in which he lived, God gave him a world in miniature, a microcosm, which was his body.42 The relationship of the parts of this body to the body itself was like the relationship of some of the planets to the world.43 The fragile beauty of the concept of the microcosm as elaborated by the Ikhwan pervades a whole epistle.44 Using a numerical symbolism, which has been described and commented upon elsewhere,45 the lkhwan detail the constituent parts of man's frame, together with its growth and function. It is compared to a city and then the analogy is broadened to contain the universe itself in which there are such correspondences as the twelve apertures of the body to the twelve signs of the zodiac, and the nine bodily substances (jawahir) to the nine heavens.46 The descriptions in this epistle reach a peak of poetic beauty, by the use of symbolism and analogy, which is infrequently encountered in the flat and repeti­tive style oftheRasii 'il, and which lends it a mystical quality absent from some of the other epistles which are influenced, for example, by the prosaic Aristotle. Any survey of Pythagorean and nco-Pythagorean elements in the Rasa 'if would not be complete without some reference to the work known as The Golden Verses47 which from late antiquity has frequently been attributed to Pythagoras himself.48 The adjective 'Golden' is said to derive, without foundation in Greek sources, from Galen (c. AD 129-c. 199), who is reputed to have been an avid reader of the poem and to have copied it in gold letters. 4Y The Arabic translation of the work enjoyed great popularity under the title The Golden Epistle (al-Risiilat al-Dhahabiyya), and this is how the Ikhwan themselves generally refer to it.50 The verses consti­tute a series of counsels for the initiate in the Pythagorean mys­teries and, not surprisingly, suffered a variety of textual changes as they were transmitted. 51 This is well borne out by the four quota­tions from them in the Rasa 'if, which each differ slightly in language, meaning and structure.52 It is clear, however, that all are meant to render, in some fashion, the same Greek lines which have been translated as follows: But observe my laws, abstaining from the things Which thy soul must fear, distinguishing them well; Letting intelligence o'er thy body reign; So that, ascending into radiant ether, Midst the Immortals, thou shalt be thyself a God. sJ"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS The Ikhwim's didactic purpose in each quotation is clear: they use 1he Golden Epistle to underline and illustrate particular facets of their teaching such as the immortality of the soul, man's yearning for the hereafter and the bliss of achieving the fourth and highest rank in the hierarchy which they themselves have erected. PLATO When we turn to Plato it is difficult to discern much direct influence on the writings of the Ikhwim; for the Rasa 'il are to a much greater degree Neoplatonic than Platonic. There are only a few references in the Rasa 'il to works like 1he Republic and the Phaetkl.54 The latter is cited in connection with Socrates' death and his fmal exhortation to sacrifice a cock for him in the temple in fulfilment of a vow.55 Book Two of 1he Republic is given as the source of the story of Gyges and the magic ring, which is recounted at some length and constitutes the fullest Platonic quotation in the Rasa 'i/.56 To these items must be added some obvious allusions to the Crito dialogueY It is a sparse selection. Nonetheless, a few Platonic notions in the field of philosophy tkJ stand out in other parts of the Ikhwim's epistles. The theme of the body as a hindrance to spiritual perfection and as a prison for the soul is common to both the Rasa 'il and Plato. The latter believed that man's reason could not function to its absolute capacity until the soul was separated from such physical distractions as pain and pleasure, and even hearing and sight. Likewise he was forced to the conclusion that real truth and pure knowledge could never be attained by the soul while it was diverted by the needs and frivolities of the body.58 The Ikhwan's outlook was very similar: the view of 'the prophets and their followers and successors and the wise philosophers who share their opinion' that 'these bodies are a prison for souls'5'� is cited with approval and succinctly echoed in the tradition 0-adith) which they quote: 'The world is the prison of the believer and the Paradise of the unbeliever. '60 In a powerful simile the soul in the body is likened to a man imprisoned in a lavatory: the faults and blemishes of the body resemble the filth of that lavatory.61 The theme is pursued in slightly different terms elsewhere: 'Here we are foreign prisoners in the bondage of nature, drowned in the sea of matter ... '.62 It is clear that, at best, the body can never have"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE I 17 more than a purely functional role as a dwelling-place for the soul. This ambivalent and strained relationship of soul and body is like a house and its inhabitant, a womb and its foetus, a ship crewed by sailors with the shore representing death, and an animal with its rider - a cornucopia, indeed, of lively images employed by the Ikhwan to underline the same Platonic point.63 Their profound disgust with the world is emphasised at the end of nearly every epistle where the brother is urged to 'turn from the sleep of negligence and the slumber of ignorance [of the body], for the world is a house of delusion and tribulations'. The wise man will never yearn for immortality in such a place of sadness and trial.04 Some of the lkhwan's ideas here about the body may seem to contradict their view of man as the most perfect of all living things, which was mentioned earlier. But the contradiction is more apparent than real for man is being viewed in two different ways: on the one hand he is the brilliant creation of God, comprising body and soul, a veritable microcosm of the whole universe, and therefore must be praised; to do otherwise would be blasphemy. On the other hand, man's human body is responsible for keeping his soul from that same creating God, and for preventing it from enjoying everlasting bliss with Him. The epistemology of Plato, however, is quite different from that of the Ikhwan. As we have seen, Plato believed that real knowledge could only be achieved in a state of complete separa­tion from the body. But the Ikhwan held that some knowledge of the divine could be acquired here in this world as a means of achieving Paradise. The Rasa 'il themselves are presented as a corpus of such knowledge and the Ikhwan rejected the Platonic belief that learning was just reminiscence and recollection. It is true that a number of scholars, in considering their Rasa 'il, have made some misleading claims to the contrary and severely limited the role allotted by the lkhwan to sense impressions in the acquisi­tion of knowledge.65 But Plato, in his statements about recollec­tion and learning, meant that the soul had had a prior existence in another life before it took up residence in its present body.06 The Ikhwan did not share this view for they rejected the Pythagorean concept of the transmigration of the soul. Mentioning that many wise men cite the Platonic dictum 'Knowledge is remembrance', the Ikhwan stress that the statement should be interpreted as meaning that the soul is 'potentially knowledgeable' ('a/lama bi '1-quwwa) and needs instruction to become 'actually knowledge-"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"18 MUSLL\\l NEOPLATONISTS able' ('a/lama bi '1-fi '/). They explain carefully that the method of instruction should be through the senses, then by the intellect and finally by logical deduction; but without the senses man can know nothing.67 This was certainly not the view of Plato, who made a firm distinction between the senses and the intellect and consi­dered that the latter was of far greater importance and significance than the former, which were utterly fallible.68 The Platonic doctrine of the Forms or 'Ideas' (ideai), which occurs so frequently in the Platonic corpus, receives scant atten­tion in the Rasa 'if, and one of the few references to it is in the nature of a quotation: Another said: the various kinds of animals in this world are only pictures and images of those forms and creatures in the world of the spheres and the compass of the heavens, just as the paintings and pictures which appear on the surfaces of walls and ceilings are pictures and images of the forms of these animals made of real flesh. The relationship of beings made of flesh to those creatures with pure essences is like the relation­ship of these painted, embellished pictures to these flesh and blood animals.69 This Platonic exposition is neither commented upon nor pursued and the writers turn at once to another speaker and another theme. The doctrine of Forms is also raised by one of the philosophers of the jinn, who reveals himself as a true Platonist, during the great debate between man and the animals in Risala 22;70 but again it remains a statement of doctrine thrown to the assembled multitude of men, jinn, and animals and is left undiscussed. Beyond such brief references - and a few stories attributed to Plato71 - there is hardly any Platonism in the Rasa 'if. As we have seen, Socrates and his school are cited in several places, usually to back up a statement by the Ikhwim. 72 Socrates' courageous attitude in the face of certain death, as portrayed by Plato, is greatly admired.73 Indeed, in one place the description of the deathbed scene is heavily oriented towards the doctrines of the lkhwan, for Socrates declares that he is going to 'our wise, excellent, noble brethren' (lkhwan lana �ukama ', Jut/ala', kurama'), terms very reminiscent of the hierarchical structure which the Ikhwan erected.74 The main arguments of the Crito"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 1 19 dialogue, which portrays Socrates' overriding respect for the rule of law, are summarised in a few lines which conclude: 'He who despises the law will be killed by the law.'75 It is clear that reverence for Socrates and all that he stood for is one of the two principal Platonic motifs in the Rasa 'il; the other, of course, being the image of the body as a prison for the soul. ARISTOTLE By contrast, Aristotle and Middle Eastern Aristotelianism played a considerable role in the formation of concepts in the Rasa 'il. It is, of course, a truism that 'Aristotle and Aristotelianism are two different things'76 and nowhere is this more apparent than in a Middle Eastern context: what starts as basically Aristotelian is likely to end as something that Aristotle would have denied or disowned. A whole host of interpreters, glossators, commentators and exegetes has worked upon him, and many have tried to render him in their own particular image and likeness, according to their own individual beliefs.77 To claim that Aristotle supported an item of doctrine was, after all, to invoke a powerful authority who could not easily be gainsaid, and many in the East and the West 'jumped on the bandwagon', including the Ikhwan al-Safa': they had no hesitation in producing a story about Muhammad in which the prophet claims that, had Aristotle lived to know the Islamic message brought by him, the Greek philosopher would have undoubtedly been converted to Islam. 78 This statement is obviously superficial and slanted, but there is nevertheless clear evidence of Aristotelian influence within the Rasa 'il themselves. It is true that the principles elaborated in the third and fourth sections (on Psychological and Rational Sciences, and Theological Sciences) are Neoplatonic in inspira­tion rather than 'Aristotelian, but nonetheless the Stagirite exer­cised a considerable sway over the work in the fields of terminol­ogy and concepts, and of natural science. Indeed, a number of parallels in title, if not always in content, can be identified between individual Rasa'il and the Corpus Aristotelicum.7Y Furthermore, the traditional grouping of Aristotle's six logical treatises (Categories, On Interpretation, Prior Ana/ytics, Posterior Analytics, Topics and Sophistical Refutations) into a block under the collective title of 1he lnstrnment (Organon) is paralleled by a similar group-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"20 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS ing of treatises in one paragraph of the Rasii 'il. However, the differences between the two groups will be readily apparent. The Ikhwan wrote: The logical sciences are of five kinds: the first is Poetics which is knowledge of the art of poetry; the second is Rhetoric which is knowledge of the art of oratory; the third is Topics which is knowledge of the art of argument; the fourth is Analytics which is knowledge of the art of proof (af-burhiin); and the fifth is Sophistical Refutation which is knowledge of the art of fallacious argument.Hil In the following lines, however, the Categories, On Interpretation and the Prior Anafytics appear, as well as the Eisagoge of Porphyry (234-c. 305) and it becomes clear that the real Organon for the Ikhwan comprises the Categon·es, On Interpretation, the Prior and Posterior Analytics and the Eisagoge, since whole epistles are devoted to each of these in the first, mathematical, section of the Rasii 'if. The initial fivefold division of the logical sciences quoted above is therefore somewhat misleading. The Analytics referred to in this first division are, of course, the Posterior Anafytics: the Arabic word al-burhiin is correctly associated by the Ikhwan else­where with this treatise and, indeed, they define the object of the Posterior Anafytics as 'knowledge of how to use sound analogy and true proof (al-burhiin al-�ahih) in which there is no mistake nor error'.81 The preoccupation of the Ikhwan with logic and their willingness to exploit the dialectical tools bequeathed by Aristotle together represent one of the most significant legacies from the latter to the Rasii 'if, and place the Brethren of Purity firmly in that stream of Islamic philosophers which did not hesitate to use the data provided by reason as well as data deriving from the Qur'anic revelation, to justify their teachings. In the field of what is called First Philosophy the Ikhwan employed a number of basic Aristotelian terms and concepts such as substance and accident, matter and form, potentiality and actuality, and the four causes. Aristotle used the word 'substance' (Greek ousia) in three principal ways: primary substance was something which could not be said of a subject nor described as being in that subject, for example the individual man or individual cow. Secondary substance was a term used to describe the kind or species to which the primary substances belonged, for example"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 1 21 man, cattle.82 Thirdly, the word 'substance' was used in the Metaphysics to denote that which made a thing what it was, to denote its essence.83 Here, then, it was a question of considering the substance (what was vital to the very being of something) rather thana substance (an individual or species) as in the first two cases. The concepts of substance and accidents were fundamental to the metaphysics of the Ikhwan but their treatment of them con­tained a number of novel elements since the basic concepts, once stated, were developed along Neoplatonic rather than traditional Aristotelian lines. What was Aristotelian, however, was the attempt on the part of the Ikhwan 'to determine substance qua substance within a meta ph ysica generalis', as Emil L. F ackenheim puts it. The same author goes on: But although the Neoplatonic hierarchy rules the whole philosophy of the Brethren of Purity and especially the influence of the Theology of Aristotle is felt everywhere, a general determi­nation of substance qua substance seems not to be made impossible thereby ... So far at least, there seems to be a simple realistic acceptance of the world in an Aristotelian sense, of a world primarily conceived in terms of substance and accident, rather than in terms of an aprioric emanation­structure.84 Thus they instruct their brother: Know, 0 brother, that the scholars have said that all things are of two types, substances and accidents (jawiihir wa a 'rlu/), and that all substances are of one kind and self-existent (qa 'ima bi-anfusiha), while accidents are of nine kinds, present in the substances, and they are attributes (�ifot) of them. But the Creator may not be described as either accident or substance, for He is their Creator and efficient cause.85 The gloss which follows shows that the lkhwan accepted these concepts put forward by the scholars above but subjected them to their own Neoplatonic standpoint. Every created being, there­fore, for the Ikhwan, could be described by the ten classical Aristotelian categories. The position of God Himself, however, remains somewhat anomalous since it is not clear whether He is within or beyond being.86"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"22 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS The Ikhwan defined-or, better, described87-a substance as something 'self-existent and receptive of attributes (al-�ifot)'.88 This description, then, is nearer to Aristotle's usage of the word 'substance' in the Metaphysics than the dual primary/secondary usage which occurs in the Categories (though the Ikhwan seem to have been aware of this latter distinction89). The phraseology in their description of substance may differ somewhat from that of Aristotle but the dependence on him in its formulation is clear evidence of the Stagirite's grip on their philosophy. The borrow­ing from Aristotle, however, ends here - at least, as far as sub­stance is concerned. It was the peculiar difficulty and bold feature of the Rasa 'if that they sought to integrate their substance/ accidents world view with a much larger Neoplatonic hierarchy while also considering substance in terms of matter and form.')() This development will be illustrated in the next chapter. Despite their Neoplatonic metamorphosis at the hands of the Ikhwan, the concepts of matter and form, in their simplest descriptions in the Rasa 'if, retain some Aristotelian characteris­tics. Aristotle distinguished several kinds of matter but underlying all of them were the same basic ideas that matter continued through change, and had no form in itself though it could receive form; indeed, it could not he found without it. In one place Aristotle observed: 'By matter I mean that which in itself is neither a particular thing nor a quantity nor designated by any of the categories which define Being.'l)1 We may compare the Ikhwan's descriptions: matter (hayufa) was 'every substance receptive of form (�ura)'; form was 'every shape and trace which the substance accepts' .n The Ikhwan thus make an equation between matter and substance here and the same equation was made in places by Aristotle: 'That matter is also substance is evident. )l)J Elsewhere, it is true, Aristotle seems to be at pains to separate and distinguish the two wordsl)4 but this only illustrates the fact that such words bear slightly different meanings at various times in the Metaphysics. Since it is clear that the Ikhwan depended to a large extent on Aristotle for their definitions, we should not be surprised to find that such definitions, or descriptions, in the Rasa 'if are similarly varied and sometimes confused.l)S Any change in matter meant that the old form was lost and a new form was acquired; the basic matter underlying these changes of form was traditionally known as the substrate. Modern scholarship now disputes the idea that Aristotle believed there"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 1 23 was 'a single, eternal and completely indeterminate substratum to all physical change, called prime matter'% (prote hule) but the lkhwan had no doubt at all that such a concept existed. In harmony with their love of the number four, they described matter in four different ways and, in a manner which was un­Aristotelian, then incorporated the concept of matter in a Neo­platonic hierarchy. The Ikhwan identified (1) the matter of artificial works (hayula '1-#na'a), such as the wood used by car­penters, the flour of the bakers, and the earth and water used by builders; (2) the matter of natural objects (hayflla '1-tabi'a), which comprised the four elements of fire, air, water and earth; (3) universal matter (hayula '/-ku/1), which was what they called the Absolute Body (a/-] ism al-Mutlaq) from which came the stars, the four elements and every other being; and finally (4) Prime Matter (a/-Hayu/11 '/-U!a). As can be seen, these categories are not mutu­ally exclusive.47 Prime Matter is defined as a 'simple substance (jawhar basi()' understood intellectually and not perceived by the senses.\"'8 All things end in Prime Matter: it is but 'the form of existence' and has neither quality not quantity; 'it is a simple substance with no structure whatsoever which is receptive of all forms'.'�'J Such terms as 'matter' and 'form' are, however, relative: what may be matter to one thing is form to another. This was clearly recognised by the Ikhwan, who illustrate the contrast by taking a dress or shirt (qami�) as their example in a passage which also neatly portrays the way in which Prime Matter is fitted into their Neoplatonic hierarchy: The dress [or shirt] is one of the artificial and corporeal created objects perceptible by the senses. Its essence (mahiyyatuhu) is that it is a form in the cloth and the cloth is matter for it. The essence of the cloth also is that it is a form in the yam and the yam is matter for it. The essence of the yam also is that it is a form in the cotton and the cotton is matter for it. The essence of the cotton also is that it is a form in the plant and the plant is matter for it. The essence of the plant also is that it is a form in the natural bodies which are fire, air, water and earth. Each one of these is also a form in the Absolute Body (a/-]ism al-Mutlaq) as we explained in the Chapter on Generation and Corruption. The Absolute Body also is a form in Prime Matter as we explained in the Chapter on Matter. Prime Matter is a spiritual"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"24 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS form which emanated from the Universal Soul (al-Nafs al­Kulliyya). The Universal Soul also is a spiritual form which emanated from the Universal Intellect (a/- 'Aql a/-Kulli) which is the first thing which the Creator created. HX) The contrast between matter lnd form may also be studied by examining that between 'the relatively undetermined or unfinished' and the 'determined or finished', making, in fact, a contrast between potentiality and actuality: 101 ' \"Actuality\" means the presence of the thing, not in the sense which we mean by \"potentially\". We say that a thing is present potentially as Hermes is present in the wood, or the half-line in the whole, because it can be separated from it.'102 These Aristotelian concepts were favourites in the imagery of the Ikhwan and were used for a variety of subjects. The soul, for example, was considered to be potentially (bi '1-quwwa) an angel or a devil and became one or the other in actuality or fact (bi '1-fi '/): Know, 0 brother, that your soul is potentially an angel, and can become one in actuality if you follow the path of the prophets and the masters of the divine laws and implement their coun­sels mentioned in their books and laid down in the usages of their laws. Your soul is also potentially a devil and will one day actually become a devil if you follow the path of the wicked and the hypocrites.103 The minds, or souls, of children were considered to be potentially rational, while those of the mature were actually so; the souls of the rational were potentially knowledgeable while the souls of the learned were knowledgeable in actuality. The souls of the learned had the potential to become philosophers and the souls of philosophers were wise in actuality. Wise men who led good lives were potential angels. Death, which the Ikhwan defined as the separation of the soul from the body, ensured that such men actually became angels. For this reason they characteristically described death as 'a wisdom and a mercy' .104 Yet the lkhwan never developed these concepts of potentiality and actuality in any depth; though it may also be fairly noted that even in Aristotle these concepts explain nothing and do not say precisely why a thing changes. The Ikhwan's own usage of them is superficial and, at times, almost incantatory, as the above string of examples shows."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 1 25 The doctrine of the Four Causes-material, formal, efficient and final - was perhaps Aristotle's fullest attempt to provide reasons for what he found in the universe. He cited the bronze from which a statue was made and the silver in a cup as examples of the first. The second cause was the pattern or form which something took, causing it to develop in one way and not another. Thus an apple pip might be expected to produce an apple, rather than an orange tree. By the third cause he indicated the origin or originator of something: a father, for example, was the efficient cause of his child. Lastly, the final cause tried to show the end purpose of something. Aristotle posed the question 'Why does a man walk?' and answered 'To be healthy'. Good health was thus said to be the final cause of walking.105 The Ikhwan adopted the same fourfold terminology: Know, 0 brother, that every being under the sphere of the moon has four causes which are all absolutely necessary in the creation of such beings: one of them is a material cause ('ilia hayulimiyya); another is a formal cause ('ilia �uriyya); another is an efficient cause ('ilia fo 'iliyya) and another is a final cause ('ilia tamamiyya)Y16 A variety of subjects, including meteorology, 107 mineralogy, 108 botany, 109 and carpentry, 110 were dealt with under these headings but the examples of causes in the Rasii 'if, where the shadows of astrology and Neoplatonism are never far away, sometimes differ radically from Aristotle's more prosaic illustrations. Thus the formal cause of mineral substances is the rotation of the spheres and the movements of the stars round the four elements (a�arkiin) of fire, air, water and earth.111 Of the four causes of plants, two are recognisably Aristotelian: the material cause of plants is the above-mentioned four elements while the final cause is the provi­sion of nourishment for animals; but the efficient cause is the powers of the Universal Soul and the formal cause is linked with astral reasons involving a lengthy explanation .112 The Ikhwan again did not explore this doctrine of the Four Causes in great depth though they recognised that it could lead to dissension, as in the case of the Duhriyya,113 who were thoroughly disliked by the Ikhwan. These were people who believed in the eternity of the universe and they were accused by the Ikhwan of denying its efficient cause out of ignorance.114"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"26 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS When they came to consider such concepts as place and void, in the Natural Sciences section of the Rasa 'if, the Brethren firstly mentioned the popular notion that place (a�makim) was a vessel or container (wi 'a') into which something could be put. 115 This notion must have owed something to Aristotle, who observed: 'So it appears that place is a surface-continent that embraces its content after the fashion of a vessel.' 116 But the concept of place as a void or empty space (a�fa4a'), into which each body fitted perfectly, indicated a lack of knowledge of the substance of the soul, according to the Ikhwan. 117 Agreeing with Aristotle over the impossibility of having a void, 118 they later argued that place was inextricably bound up with matter; indeed, it was one of the attributes of matter and could not exist apart from it.11'� According to this, any idea of a void, defined as a place in which nothing was put, would have involved a contradiction for the Ikhwan. While they were not always consistent in their treatment of place, their dependence on Aristotle is usually discernible: the Stagirite's definition of place as 'whatever fixed environing surface we take our reckoning from'120 is echoed in a later formulation by the Ikhwan, in the Psychological and Rational Sciences section of the Rasa 'if, of place as 'the extremities of the body (nihayat a�jism)'.U1 Yet in a number of important respects the philosophy of Aristotle had no influence at all on the Ikhwan. In direct opposi­tion to the view of the Peripatetics, the Ikhwan held that the world was created, or, better, 'invented'.122 The spiritual aspects of creation-the first emanations such as the Intellect and Universal Soul-were brought into being instantaneously123 while the rest of the natural phenomena of the world were created gradually over a period of time; the Ikhwan found some indication of the latter in the Qur'an, which states that God 'created the heavens and the earth in six days'. 124 This verse was elaborated by another which they used to allot a rather wider time span for the creation: 'and surely a day with thy Lord is as a thousand years of your count­ing'. 125 The emanations played a part in this creation as well: for example, God permitted the Universal Soul a major role in the shaping of the material world.126 It was a cardinal point of doctrine that it was a finite world and so would one day perish with the cessation of motion.127 Those whose ignorance led them to believe in an eternal world without a creator would suffer grave injury to their souls; indeed, salvation was only for the believer in a created world.128 We have already seen how the Duhriyya were"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 1 27 roundly condemned for their views and there is no doubt that the lkhwan felt very strongly about this issue. Another important philosophical divergence lay in the con­nected question of motion. The universe of the Ikhwan had both Body and Universal Soul.12'� Since all motion in the heavens was due to this Universal Soul, 130 the concept of motion did not have the same importance in the physics of the Ikhwan as it did with the Stagirite, where the question of motion was bound up with that of the First Mover. In any case, it was cosmology rather than physics which interested the Ikhwan in their discussions of motion, time and space. They saw time, for example, as much more than just an Aristotelian measurement of movement. It had both a psychologi­cal and an eschatological aspect: psychological because it was a pure form born of the mind, and eschatological because time, like the world itself, was an object of creation. The day which heralded the end of the world would also herald the end of time.131 When we turn to the last five Rasa 'il dealing with the Organon in the Mathematical Sciences section, we find that the treatment by the Ikhwan of these logical treatises, despite their enthusiasm for logic, is somewhat rudimentary. As has been mentioned already, the treatises discuss Aristotle's Categories, On Interpretation (known in the Arabic of the Rasa 'il as Baramaniyas from the Greek Peri Hermimeias), Prior Analytics, and Posterior Analytics, and the Neoplatonist Porphyry's Introduction or Eisagoge. The survey of the Categories (al-Maqulat aJ.- 'Ash r) begins, as in Aristotle's work, with a consideration of terms. The ten categories listed by the Ikhwan agree with Aristotle's, though discussion of them is considerably telescoped in the work of the former. They comprise: substance (jawhar), quantity (kamm), quality (kayf), relation (mu4ilf), place (ayn), time (mata), posture (na�ba orwa4'), possession or state (rna/aka), action (yaj'al), and passivity (yanfo 'il).132 The Risa/a falls naturally into three major parts of preliminaries, discussion of individual categories, and discussion of such topics as opposites and priority, which parallels the plan of Aristotle's work.uJ A major point of difference, however, lies in the description of the category of substance. Substance is described, Neoplatoni­cally, as an aspect of form and all substances are stated to be of one kind (jins).134 Thus there is not the division into primary and secondary substances which we find in Aristotle. But the Ikhwan"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"28 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS seem to show some awareness of the Aristotelian distinction in that Zayd and 'Amr and Khalid are all identified as individual men partaking in a common humanity which is called a species (naw').135 Here at least, the Arabic word naw' does duty in the Aristotelian sense of secondary substance. The Ikhwi'm do have a division of substance but it is into spiritual (rillJO,ni) and corporeal (jusmani) and these divisions are further subdivided, as are the other nine categories. 136 The five ways in which some things may precede, or be prior to, others agree with Aristotle.137 However, the Ikhwan do not dis­cuss the kinds of change in their Risala devoted to the Categories, as Aristotle does in his treatise, 138 but do so in another Risala specifically devoted to a consideration of matter, form, movement, time and place.m Here it will be found that the six aspects of movement-generation, destruction, increase, diminution, altera­tion and migration - also accord with Aristotle's list. The content of the Risiila entitled On the Meaning of Peri Hermeneias differs little from the Greek treatise. Both seek definitions of names, verbs, sentences, statements, affirmations and negations. The kinds of logic and the relationships which operate in statements are analysed in a much abbreviated form.140 A similar sort of cursory treatment is found in the two Rasa 'il devoted to the Analytics.141 In the Prior Anafytics Aristotle's intention was to demonstrate the syllogism which he regarded as a basic tool for all reasoning, and show how its uses could vary. As with Aristotle, the Ikhwan start by defining terms such as premise (muqaddima) and stating the rules necessary for syllogisms with examples of the first, second and third figures. The middle part of this short Risiila is occupied with a number of Aristotelian-type syllogisms though they are not stated in such abstract and algebraic terms. It concludes with a tendentious discussion of the importance of logic and logical deduction to philosophy, which is absent from Aristotle's treatise. The Risala also contains a warn­ing by Aristotle against the employment of methods oflogic which might lead their proponents into error.142 It has been noted that much of the terminology at the beginning of the Prior Analytics has a mathematical air, 143 with its use of such terms as 'figure' (Greek: schema; Arab ic: shakl) and 'boundary' (horos; �add), and this must have given the work a particular appeal to the mathemat­ically inclined Ikhwan. Like many scientisti and philosophers before and after them,"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 1 29 the lkhwan sought to erect some kind of scientific and intellectual framework from which to analyse the phenomena around them and to provide a basis for arriving at the truth. It was clear that man could not, and should not, rely on his senses alone: as Plato so frequently emphasised, these could err wildly. Objects were not, therefore, to be judged by only one sense faculty: more than eyesight, for example, was necessary in the assessment of a mirage.144 Yet, however the Ikhw:m may have viewed Aristotle's second syllogistic treatise, Book A, at least, of the Posterior Analy­tics cannot be described as containing 'a theory of scientific methodology'. It was rather an attempt to show how to present research findings in a coherent fashion; such presentation was the prime function of demonstration. 145 Furthermore, Aristotle noted right at the beginning of his work that instruction and learning rested on knowledge which already existed. The dual nature of this knowledge was succinctly summarised by the Ikhwan in their discussion of the basis of deductive logic. This comprised, very simply, two items of information put in the form of questions: Is it? and What is it? 146 Their account of the Posterior Ana/ytics is more than twice as long as that of the Prior Ana/ytics, yet it still falls short of the adequate and, indeed, diverges from its Aristotelian model onto matter and methodologies of its own. In it they concentrate on the intention behind the philosopher's use of logical deduction or syllogism, and identity four methods of thought which past philosophers have adopted in their search for truth: division (taqsim ), analysis (tal} !if), definition (�uhud) and (logical) demon­stration or proof (burhan).147 All these terms have an Aristotelian quality and ring about them but a later division by the Ikhwan, this time of created and spiritual phenomena, does not and is not to be found in the Posterior Ana/ytics. Everything, the Ikhwan declare, is ultimately reducible to one of three categories: corporeal and natural (jusmaniyya {abi'iyya), for example the human body; corporeal and artificial (jirmaniyya �ina 'iyya), for example a city; and spiritual (nafsaniyya r�aniyya), for example singing.148 Finally, the discussion of causality in the middle of Book B is reduced in the Risa/a to little more than a discussion of the fact that effect cannot precede cause. WI For the most part, then, the treatment of the Organon by the Ikhwan is brief, if not perfunctory, and it is not always faithful to Aristotle's treatises. The surveys of the Ikhwan contribute"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"30 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS nothing original to the analysis oflogic. They are content to quote received ideas and interweave them occasionally with their own Neoplatonic vision. It has been pointed out that even their use of a sixth term, the individual (al-shakh�), which is added to Porphyry's five, may very well have been borrowed from al-Kindi (died after 866), the father of Arab philosophy.150 A survey of the zoology, botany, mineralogy, meteorology and other natural science sections of the Rasa 'if is beyond the scope of this book. Yet here too, it should be emphasised, the thought of Aristotle left its mark. Indeed, one scholar has gone so far as to say that 'it was probably Aristotle the natural scientist who had the broadest influence on Arab letters' .151 A single example must suffice. The Ikhwim classified the animal kingdom in several different ways. One was according to the development of the animals' faculties; 152 another was according to habitat; 153 and a third was a threefold division according to the way in which animals generated their young: there were those which became pregnant and suckled and raised their young; those which mated, and laid and hatched eggs; and, finally, those which did not do any of these things but came into being out of decaying matter and lived for less than a year.154 The shadow of Aristotle hangs over each of these as is clear from a glance at his Generation of Animals: the third division mentioned by the Ikhwan, for example, is a condensed version of the main fivefold classification which appears in that treatise.155 The pseudo-Aristotelian writings have a place in the Rasa 'if as well. Indeed, the confusing eclecticism of the Ikhwan in ranking spurious and genuine works together as of equal authority may be excused only by the fact that they genuinely believed that they were following Aristotle in all cases. Beside quotations from Ihe Golden Verses of Pythagoras, and Christ, they also quote from the notorious Iheologia Aristotelis, a Neoplatonic compilation, falsely attributed to Aristotle, which was, in fact, a resume of Books IV, V and VI of the Enneads of Plotinus (204-70): 156 Often have I withdrawn by myself and have doffed my body and laid it aside, and become as if I were naked substance without body, so as to be inside myself, outside all other things. Then do I see within myself such beauty and splendour as I do remain marvelling at and astonished, so that I know that I am one of the parts of the sublime, surpassing, lofty divine world .... 157"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE I 31 The other major spurious Aristotelian text cited in the Rasa 'i/ is The Book of the Apple (Risalat a/- Tu./fai}a), which was known in the West by the long-winded Latin title of Tractatus de pomo et morte incliti principis philosophorum A n\"stote/is. This work, which was Arabic in origin and probably composed before AD 900, was written in a Platonic style. It portrays the dying Aristotle discours­ing on immortality while occasionally reviving himself with the smell of an apple. The influence of Plato's Phaedo on it is unmis­takable. The citation of the work by the Ikhwan, with its reference to Aristotle counselling and consoling his disciples on his death­bed, is once again for the purpose of justifYing belief in the immortality of the soul. IsH One is now in a position to attempt an answer to the question which has been posed154 concerning the depth and accuracy of the Ikhwan's understanding of Greek philosophy, at least with regard to Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle. Of the three philosophers, they seem to have understood and appreciated Pythagoras the most. His ontological approach to numbers was adapted by the lkhwan to their own needs and a strongly Pythagorean interest in mathematics and related subjects per­vades the whole of the Rasa 'i/. Of pure Platonic philosophy there is little. Plato's mentor Socrates is placed on a pedestal as a wise and good man who knew how to face death bravely, but the questions which his pupil Plato put into his mouth in the various dialogues, such as the existence of Forms like perfect goodness and justice, are hardly raised, much less answered. The Ikhwan had their own questions, didactically posed, dogmatically answered. Only in the field of ethics is much direct Platonic influence perceptible, as where the Brethren's eagerness for learning and knowledge brought them to 'a perfect Socratism where knowledge, the good and virtue are identified with one another'. In the ideal state of the Ikhwan, as in Plato's Republic, the ignorant will be instructed by the wise.160 Aristotle stands in the shade of the Neoplatonists. The basic concepts and terminology used by the Ikhwan are his. Their development belongs to the Neoplatonists. Several Aristotelian doctrines are mentioned and, indeed, adopted, but discussion in the manner of, for example, the Metaphysics is rare. Aristotelian doctrine seems, on the whole, to have been superficially apprehended. The Organon is unoriginally described and the description does not always concur with Aristotle. The accep-"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"32 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS tance of the Neoplatonic Theologia Aristotelis and The Book of the Apple as being written by Aristotle himself reflects poorly on the depth of the Ikhwim's knowledge and understanding of Aristotle; though in fairness to the lkhwan it must be stated that the same mistake was made by many other writers. The luminaries of Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle may, how­ever, justly be said to shine in the firmament of the Rasa 'if Ikhwan al-Safo '. But they shared this firmament with a number ofbrighter stars which on occasion eclipsed the three Greek sages. The brightest was Neoplatonism."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE The Legacy of Greece 2: Neoplatonism The reconciliation of a pagan philosophy with the dogmatic theology of any revealed religion poses enormous problems and has evoked different approaches over the ages from those medieval Christian, Byzantine and Islamic scholastics who have attempted the synthesis. A pagan philosophy like Neoplatonism was received differently according to the nature of the religion with which it collided. Thus the medieval Christian world, with its Trinitarian theology, could not have failed to notice, and com­ment upon, the contrast between Plotinus's three hypostases and the Christian Trinity. Furthermore, different media of transmis­sion gave rise to different versions of the same philosophy. Thus the Muslim world, via the Syriac and Arabic translations of Greek texts, literary forgeries of the same such as the 1heologia, and the influence of the Alexandrian philosophical school, whose city was conquered by the Arabs in \\D 642, received a quite different version of Neoplatonism from that which reached medieval Europe; for its basic strand was Aristotelianism.1 This Neoplatonised Aristotelianism is clearly visible in the writings of the Ikhwan al-Safa'. However, before considering the Neoplatonic development of the various Aristotelian concepts which they employed, and their integration with this pagan philosophy, it is profitable to consider first two complementary concepts of paramount importance in Neoplatonism: emanation and hierarchy. Both were adopted by the Ikhwan. Plotinus, the father ofNeoplatonism, has been described as the only philosopher of comparable stature to Plato and Aristotle in the course of later Greek philosophy.2 He may have been born in Upper Egypt but there is no doubt that he was entirely Greek in"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"34 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS his way of thinking and philosophy.3 He postulated a hierarchy of three hypostases or principles above Matter, comprising The One or The Good, Intelligence or Intellect, and Soul. The first is described as beyond being but the second is said to be both being and the Intellectual-Principle. They are both followed immedi­ately by the Soul.4 The issue of all things, and especially the second and third hypostases, from The One was described by the Neoplatonists using the image of generation or emanation. Plotinus ingeniously claimed to find his doctrine in Plato5 and compared the concept of emanation to the ceaseless generation of light by the sun;6 this seems a highly physical simile but modern scholars have been swift to warn against envisaging light too much in material terms. Plotinus certainly did not. 7 The Ikhwim followed the Neoplatonists in erecting an emanationist hierarchy of which the first three members corres­ponded to the Plotinian triad. They noted that things above the natural sphere fell into four ranks. First came the Creator (al­Bafi), then the Universal Active Intellect (a/-'Aql a!-Kultz al­Fa \"a/), then the Universal Soul (al-Nafs a/-Kulliyya), and, fourth, Prime Matter (al-Hayula '/-Ula).8 The whole scheme of creation and generation resembled the generation of numbers from one: Know, 0 brother, that the first thing which the Creator origi­nated and invented from the light of His unity was a simple essence called the Active Intellect, just as He produced two from one by repetition. Then He created the Universal Celes­tial Soul from the light of the Intellect, just as He created three by the addition of one to two. Then He created Prime Matter from the movement of the Soul just as He created four by adding one to three.'� It will be noted at once that here, with the Ikhwan, Matter is a full member of the emanationist hierarchy whereas with Plotinus it is excluded from his triad of principles, being itself a principle of evil and the cause of any weakness or evil in the soul.10 However, Plotinus's view that Matter was intrinsically evil was rejected by later Neoplatonists such as Proclus (412-85)11 and this is, of course, much nearer to the standpoint of the lkhwan, who never regarded Prime Matter as a principle of evil but rather as 'a positive spiritual principle' .12 The Ikhwan, too, employed the image of emanation to describe"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 2 35 the relationship between the various members of the hierarchy and they rendered it in Arabic by the word fay4 which means literally 'a pouring forth' or 'flood'. Using a sun simile, which is to some extent like that of Plotinus, they related how the generosity and virtues which were in God emanated (afa4a) from Him 'by the necessity of wisdom (bi-wajib al-�ikma)', in the same fashion that light and brightness emanated from the eye of the sun. The first product of this unbroken emanation (fay4) was called the Active Intellect, from which emanated, in turn, the Passive Intellect (al-'Aql al-Munfa 'il) or Universal Soul; from the latter emanated Prime Matter. 13 Yet the emanation theory of the Ikhwan differs in many respects from that of Plotinus. Not only was it imbued with neo-Pythagorean tendencies, as where the emanation of all things from God was compared to the emanation of all numbers from one, but emanation and creation were not involuntary as in Plotinus's thought, where The One neither willed nor planned the emanations which proceeded from It: the universe came into being, not as the result of some carefully reasoned plan, but out of necessity.14 We have seen that the Ikhwan use a similar phrase, 'necessity of wisdom', but they make it clear elsewhere in the Rasa 'if that they considered that the processes of emanation and creation were the results of the Creator's choice and deliberate action. The 'wisdom' referred to is obviously something of which God is in complete control. We are not to think, therefore, that the world exists as a result of a purely natural dispensation or order in which God exercised no choice whatsoever; it does not resemble the sun's light in the atmosphere in this respect.15 Furthermore, the full hierarchy of being which the Ikhwan erected was a much more elaborate structure than the simple triad of Plotinus from which the rest of the material world derived or emanated. It comprised nine members or levels of being: the Creator (al-Bari), the Intellect (a/-'Aql), the Soul (a/-Nafs), Prime Matter (al-Hayula '1-Ula), Nature (al-Tabi'a), the Absolute Body (a/-Jism al-Mutlaq), the Sphere (a/-Fa/ak), the Four Elements (al-Arkan), and the Beings which live in this world (al­Muwalladat), divided among the mineral, plant and animal king­doms.16 Each member was itself composed of a number of things equivalent to the number of the rank which the member held in the above chain of being. Thus the Sphere, which had seventh place in the hierarchy, had seven planetsP"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"36 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS Such a hierarchical profusion is slightly reminiscent of the way in which the hypostases were multiplied under lamblichus (c. 250--c. 326) and Proclus. The former was responsible for mixing Plotinus's simple triad of The One, the Intellect and the Soul with a whole host of intermediaries, thus elaborating the hierarchy and lending an aura of appalling complexity to later Neoplatonic metaphysics.18 It is true that this infiltration of other hypostases is not paralleled in the Rasa 'if in the same manner; but the splitting up of the Plotinian triad by philosophers such as Iamblichus obviously paved the way, and provided the impetus, for other kinds of subdivision, dissection and classification under­taken by later groups like the Ikhwim. The concept of hierarchy dominates the Rasa'il. 'A. 'Awa identifies it as one of the main themes running through the writings of the Ikhwan while Yves Marquet considers a study of their human hierarchy indispensable to a proper understanding of the role of the Imam .1<) The concept extended from the chain of being above to many other aspects of life. Perhaps the most obvious example of all is the hierarchy of the Ikhwan, who divided themselves into the four ranks of: (a) craftsmen, who were at least fifteen years of age and were described as 'pious and compassion­ate (a/-abrarwa '1-ru/Jama')'; (b) political leaders who had attained at least thirty years of age and bore the titles of'good and excellent (al-akhyar wa '1-futja/a')'; (c) kings, who had attained at least the age of forty and who were called by their fellow brethren 'excel­lent and noble (a/-fu4ala' a/-kiram)'; and, last, (d) prophets and philosophers like Abraham, joseph, jesus, Muhammad, Socrates and Pythagoras. Their rank could justly be labelled 'the angelic rank (al-martabat al-malakiyya)' and it was not reached before the age of fifty. It was the final rank to which all the Brethren were to aspire.20 Other hierarchies and divisions abound in the Rasa 'if, both animate and inanimate, and it is clear that the Ikhwan viewed the whole world of the human being as a mass of'grades, classes and circles surrounding each other'.21 Minerals, plants, animals, men and angels shared in a hierarchy in which the highest member of a lower order was equal to the lowest member of the order above it. Thus the palm, highest member of the plant kingdom by virtue of its possessing some animal characteristics (such as differentiation of sexes), was equal to a member of the animal kingdom and was described, in fact, as an 'animal-plant' (nabiit �ayawani).22 Believ-"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 2 37 ers in the Qur'im and the prophetic books were divided according to the whole-hearted nature of their belief, and their knowledge of what they believed in.23 There were fifteen ranks of soul, of which seven were superior to the human soul and seven were inferior.24 As for the corporeal side of things, it was divided into the animate and the inanimate: the animate divided into animal and plant, and animal further subdivided into people, birds, fish and similar beings.25 Sounds were divided into animal and non-animal and both categories were further subdivided.26 Hell was given its seven traditional ranks of]ahannam, Jal{im, Saqar, La:¢,, Hutma, Sa'ir, and Hawiyya.27 From all this it is clear that the Ikhwan's interest in classification and hierarchy amounted at times to a positive passion and mania. Aristotle's categories were also subjected to this kind of formal hierarchisation and division. Thus substance divided first into its corporeal (jusmani) and spiritual (rUJ,ani) aspects. Corporeal sub­stance then further divided into that which pertained to the celestial sphere (folaki) and the natural sphere (tabi 'i), and so on outwards until a final division into animals born from the womb, those born from an egg, and those born from decayed matter, was reached. Quantity (kamm) was similarly divided into the separate (munfo�il) and the linked (mutta�il). The separate divided into number ('adad) and movement fbaraka) and there was further subdivision which ended in the 'units, tens, hundreds and thousands'.28 It will be readily seen that with such a variety of hi�rarchies and divisions the Ikhwan had come a long way from th::: cimple majesty of the Plotinian hierarchy composed of The One, the Intellect and the Soul. It would therefore be wrong to attempt to equate absolutely The One or The Good ofPlotinus with the Muslim Allah, or even the Christian God, much less with an ordinary Greek theos or daimon ,29 or a Roman deus. It is true that all partake in a basic incomparability and majesty. Yet the essence of each differs considerably. The first is unknowable to the extent that a negative theology proclaims that we can only know what The One is not. 30 The second is strictly one in person and sometimes akin to the severe and vengeful Yahweh of the Old Testament, in the admonitory eschatological phrases which He employs in the Qur'an. The third is Trinitarian in person, and two-natured, possessing a hypostatic union between Father and incarnate Son, while examples of the fourth and fifth are frequently described in"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"38 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS a ludicrously anthropomorphic fashion: we note, for example, the machinations of the Gods in the works of Homer and in Virgil's Aeneid. Yet the Ikhwan did attempt a kind of identification between two disparate concepts of deity, between The One of Plotinus and Allah oflslam, though they never directly stated that this was their intention. However, their attempt at grafting Allah onto the top of their metaphysical hierarchy or, to put it another way, their attempt at producing a descending order of being from Allah, involved them in a fundamental dichotomy in their view of God. One scholar has noted that 'most of the contradictions [in the Rasa 'if] are merely apparent when we go more deeply into the problems' .31 Here, at least, he is wrong and the inconsistency goes beyond mere detail. It is an outstanding omission in previous studies of the Ikhwan that little or no attention has been paid to their dichotomous view of the divinity. Sometimes God is successfully described in a Neoplatonic fashion. It is true that, with Plotinus, The One Itself is not the Creator, and should not even be called the First Cause. Any 'predication of action' is utterly precluded by the 'lonely majesty' of the Plotinian concept.32 Thus creation, as far as The One was concerned, was involuntary. As we have seen, this view was not shared by the Ikhwan. However, Plotinus and the Ikhwan were in agreement on the intermediary roles which the Intellect and the Soul played in the creation of the material world. In the Rasa 'if the Soul was created through the medium of the lntellect33 and then God 'created the rest of the living creatures from Matter and arranged them by means of the Intellect and the Soul'.34 His method was thus to act indirectly with the aid of these inter­mediaries or with the assistance of other angelic agents such as Nature (a/-Tabi'a).35 Furthermore, just as the good soul in the Enneads longed for a union with The One, like that of two lovers, 36 so every being in theRasii 'if was urged to return to God after its sojourn on earth; it should answer the Qur'anic imperative 'Return unto thy Lord, well-pleased, well-pleasing!'37 with the emotional formula used during the pilgrimage to Mecca: 'Here I am, oh Lord, here I am! (/._,abbayka, Alliihumma, labbayka!)'38 The authors oftheRasii 'if constantly sought to wake their brethren 'from the sleep of neglig­ence and the slumber ofignorance'39 so that they might successfully rise 'to the Kingdom of Heaven and the realm of the spheres and enter Paradise, the world of the spirits'.40"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 2 39 As in the philosophy of Neoplatonism, Allah did not move the world directly but it was moved by the power of the Universal Celestial Soul to whom God had entrusted 'the rotation of the spheres and the movements of the stars and what is under the sphere of the moon'.41 Thus the Universal Soul operated, as in Plotinus's work, directly on the material world with what it received from the Intellect. God's gifts, for example, were poured firstly onto the Intellect and then received by the Universal Soul which poured them forth, in turn, onto .\\1atter.42 At times the lkhwan make Allah appear almost unknowable in the Plotinian sense in that no attributes may be predicated of Him which might seem to derogate from His divinity and make Him appear in any way human:n This raises the related, thorny ques­tion of the createdness or otherwise of the Qur'an, for the Qur'an was considered to be the speech of God Himself. While orthodox Islam adhered to a belief in the uncreatedness and eternity of the Qur'an, the philosophical group called the Mu 'tazila, which was among the first to apply the methodology of Greek dialectic to Islamic thought, espoused a belief in a created Qur'an. This was adopted by the 'Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun (813-33) and forcibly imposed for a while by means of an inquisition (mi�na).44 There are some striking similarities between the theology of the lkhwan and that of the Mu'tazilite school.45 However, on the question of the Qur'an the Ikhwan seem to have attempted to please both parties, orthodox and Mu'tazilite:46 they disting­uished between the actual sounds, words and letters of the Qur'an, and the ideas or meanings present in the mind of God, and held that the former were created (makhluqa), while the latter were uncreated.47 An added refinement to this was that God's actual communication of the Qur'an to the angel Gabriel was considered to be a creation ex nihilo (ibda').48 This is all of vital importance in assessing the Ikhwan's view of God and the equation of the 'unknowableness' of the Plotinian One with the incomparability (tanzih)4'! of Allah. For if God is deemed to have no attributes, and if He cannot thus be qualified, He cannot properly be said to have a divine will and the whole notion of divine will becomes superftuous.50 Here we may note the contradiction into which the syncretic thought of the Ikhwan has led them: previously it was admitted that God did manifest His will in the creation and emanation of the material universe.51 Now, in an attempt to bolster up the"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"40 .\\1l!SLIM. NEOPLATONISTS concept of tanzih, this would seem to be denied. As if realising the contradiction, however, the Ikhwan try to wriggle out of it by adopting the expression 'metaphorically' ('ala sabil al-majaz) in the ascription of the divine will.�2 Furthermore, they actually permit anthropomorphic ascriptions to the deity - such as being on a throne in the heavens-by the common people (a/- 'amma) since these help the unscholarly to believe in the very existence of God. 53 Also, since God is the creator of such opposites as exis­tence and non-existence, life and death, and knowledge and ignorance, even the scholars are permitted to say that He is distinguished by the qualities of creation, or immortality or know­ledge.54 'Awa describes this type of nomination - he prefers this French word here toattribut-as one ofthe concessions which the Ikhwan make in order that their rationalist and Mu'tazilite ideas might accord with the data of the Qur'an.55 The Neoplatonic aspect of Allah is therefore somewhat confused in the minds of the Ikhwan. It is small wonder, then, that commentators have had difficulty in deciding whether the Brethren considered that God was within or beyond being.56 If we turn now to the non-l\\\"eoplatonic picture of Allah which the Rasa 'if also paints, we find that here He is clearly envisaged and portrayed as the God of traditional Islam, acting for and guiding His people directly. He rewards the good and punishes the wicked. Nowhere is it stated that the Intellect or Universal Soul will sit in judgement on the souls of the just or the evil-doers. This is work for God alone: The souls of the believers among the saints of God and His good servants will be raised after death to the Kingdom of Heaven and the expanse of the spheres ... As for the souls of the infidels and the profligate and the evil, they will remain, in their blindness and ignorance, tormented, in pain, grieving and sad, fearful and apprehensive, until Judgement DayY We have seen that, at times in the Rasa 'if, God's gifts are poured out indirectly via the emanations.58 But as the traditional God of Islam and the creator of Adam, the father of all mankind, God has given man many direct gifts such as the means of acquiring knowledge by reading and writing.59 Indeed, His ben­efits to man have been countless though the Ikhwan, typically, attempt to classifY them, dividing them into external and internal. The external include such things as money, spouse, children and"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 2 41 material goods, while the internal are health, good looks, perfect physique, strength and endurance on the one hand, and such features as a good character and an intelligent soul or mind on the other.f><> The Ikhwan do not, however, specify precisely who the human recipients of all these gifts are to be, but they would certainly have preferred to see them showered on the knowledgeable rather than the ignorant. The description of the gifts is followed by an account of the four states of knowledge into which all men may be divided.61 Though the Ikhwan claimed to have sent emissaries to every class of society including the artisan,62 they adopted an intellectually arrogant approach to the common man not posses­sed of their own wide-ranging learning. Though they identified three classes of beliefs-for the specialist, for the common people and for both- and commended some of the last as best,63 they nonetheless contrasted in one of their fables the ignorance of the common man with the knowledge and lifestyle of the ascetic scholar.64 They compared the hands and fingers of the body to domestic servants and workmen, and man's reason to an enthroned king.65 They spoke in a condescending and sometimes derogatory fashion of the attitudes of ordinary people (jumhur al-niis) to such complex subjects as time and magic.66 Thus, just as the great philosopher and Sufi al-Ghazali (1 058-111 1), in his late treatise The Restraining of the Common People from the Science of Theology (//jam al-'Awwiim 'an 'Ilm a/-Kaliim), warned of the dangers in the study of kalam by those with too little education, so the Ikhwan warned of the dangers inherent in the study of magic by the common people. Allah enables man to carry out His orders67 and it is He rather than the Universal Intellect or Universal Soul who sends prophets and saints. These constitute, as it were, a race apart for they are humans who have been specially chosen by God as His ambas­sadors and made intermediaries between the angels and the rest of created men and jinn.68 Since it is not given to ordinary mortals to speak directly with God, man must receive divine instruction by inspiration or from one of these apostles and messengers who are sent to warn of the last awful Day ofJudgement.6<J God Himself is perpetually warning His people through the medium of the Qur'an, and the Rasa 'if, with their liberal sprinkling of Qur'anic quotations, bear ample witness to this. Hypocrites, for example, 'will be in the lowest reach of the Fire'.70"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"42 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS The theme of divine guidance is particularly dear to Islam, springing as it does from the Qur'im, which contains numerous references to it. 71 This idea of God guiding His people is one beloved by the Ikhwim as well, for it is their constant prayer at the end of many of the Rasa 'il that God may 'grant you and us and all our brothers success in doing the right thing, and guide you and us and all our brothers along the path of righteousness'. 72 This is certainly very far from the unknowable deity of Neoplatonism. Furthermore, this theme of guidance spills over from the divine to the human: ultimately each man must work out his salvation within the framework of the society in which he lives. Since he cannot achieve this on his own, he must have recourse for guidance and help (mu 'awana) to those better instructed and qualified than he, for example the Ikhwan/3 who are described metaphorically at one point as one soul in several bodies. 74 Each man's soul is, in fact, part of a great kingdom of souls, human, super-human and sub-human, all drawing their power from the same Universal Soul which moves the universe. The Ikhwan identifY a similar source of power on the social level: salvation, in their view, may be better achieved through membership of a society in which the concept of mutual help or cooperation (ta 'awun) is the principal driving force than in the solitary cave of the anchorite who has shunned all contact with men. Finally, the God of the Rasa 'il has a very Islamic unity which is stressed throughout the work and which, strangely enough, the emanations of the Intellect and the Soul do not seem to infringe at all. The lkhwan claim that their intention, in all that they have written, is the proclamation of the unity of God (taw�id) and His complete and utter freedom (tanzih) from any of the anthro­pomorphic elements which the ignorant attribute to Him. 75 There is, then, an unresolved dichotomy in the Ikhwan's treat­ment of Allah in the Rasa 'il: to remain within the pale of Islam their deity had to be endowed with some unmistakably Islamic characteristics such as those just outlined above; to remain at the top of their Neoplatonic hierarchy He also had to be treated in a Neoplatonic fashion. But the Islamic ethos which also pervades the Rasa 'il prevented the Ikhwan's concept of Allah becoming fully integrated with The One of Plotinus. However, when we turn to the Ikhwan's treatment of the Intellect and the Universal Soul, we find that these are somewhat closer to the Neoplatonic models. Whereas, in any attempt at"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 2 43 synthesising concepts of divinity, The One ofPlotinus was bound to dash in several respects with the Islamic Allah, there were no indigenous concepts in Sunni Islam parallel to an emanated Intellect or Soul. It is true that both are to be found in other branches of Islam such as Isma'ili Shi'ism but this was the result of borrowing from a variety of external Neoplatonic sources. There is a certain duality apparent in the second and third principles of Intellect and Soul in the philosophies of both Plotinus and the Ikhwan. For all the other dualities of matter and form, light and darkness, substance and accident, and the like, of which the material universe is composed, derive ultimately from them.76 The Intellectual-Principle of Plotinus eternally contem­plates The One while 'giving birth' to the Soul which is respons­ible for the production of all the inferior forms of life in the cosmos. A great torrent of feeling, to use blatently anthro­pomorphic terms, gushes from the Intellect to The One, and from the Soul to the Intellect. Plotinus describes the latter as eternally striving towards, and eternally attaining, The One which he also calls The Good. 77 Allah is similarly an object of desire or longing (shawq) in the Rasa'il. He is 'The First Beloved (al-Ma'shuq al-Awwal)', for whom not only the Intellect and the Soul but all created beings are filled with longing. All creation will ultimately return to Him since He is the source of their very existence, sustenance, immortality and perfection.78 Such was the longing for God which possessed the Universal Soul that, as a direct result, the mu}Ji(, the outermost of the spheres in the lkhwan's universe, came into being; simi­larly, just as the Plotinian Intellect eternally contemplates The One, so the Intellect in the Rasa 'il eternally desires union with Allah.79 As might be expected however, the Ikhwan's concept of the Intellect has some features of its own which distinguish it from Plotinus's view of this second principle. Being the first creation of God, it receives all four of the Creator's qualities of existence (wujUd), immortality (baqa'), completeness (tamamiyya), and per­fection (kama/) but it only transmits the first three to the Universal Soul.80 By any standards the Intellect is a mysterious being and the Ikhwan occasionally speak of it as resembling a veil and a gate.81 As in Neoplatonic philosophy, its principal activity appears to be the generation of the Universal Soul in relation to which it becomes active in contrast to its passivity towards God.82"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"44 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS Of the three Plotinian hypostases, Soul has justly been described as 'the most wide-ranging and various in its activities' .83 The same was true of the Ikhwfm's Universal Soul: though feminine by nature, and also grammatically to distinguish it from the masculine Arabic word for body,jasad,84 it was passive only in its relationship with the Intellect but active as far as everything else was concerned.85 It was responsible for maintaining and moving the material universe, which it had been instrumental in bringing into being,86 as well as transmitting those virtues and qualities which it received from the Intellect to this material world.87 Plotinus, confusingly, used several divisions of soul in the Enneads: in some places there was a twofold division into higher and lower souls.88 In others soul received one of several threefold - or even multifold - divisions, such as that into reasoning soul, sensitive soul and vegetative soul.8'1 In a similar manner, the Ikhwan too distinguished between several kinds of soul. As we have seen, there were fifteen different ranks, arranged like the ranks of numbers, of which seven were superior to the human soul, one was human, and seven ranked below the human soul. The two ranks immediately above the human were termed the ranks of royalty and sacredness respectively while the two immediately below were called the animal and the vegetative.')() However, it has been emphasised that 'the souls in various species in the world such as the animal and vegetative do not actually signify a plurality of souls but various functions of the single Universal Soul'.91 In the same way, the two- and threefold divi­sions of soul in Plotinus constituted different levels or facets of the one Soul which was 'a single living continuum'.92 Having examined the concepts of hierarchy and emanation, and compared the three Plotinian hypostases with the first three members of the Ikhwan's hierarchy, we are now in a position to look rather more closely at the Neoplatonic metamorphosis which overtook some of Aristotle's concepts at the hands of the Ikhwan and led to 'truly novel mergings of ideas and attempts at unification'. For when Neoplatonists came to deal with the con­cepts of substance and accident they frequently tended to neglect or ignore the relationship between the two and to treat substance, or rather substances, purely within the context of their own Neoplatonic hierarchical frameworks.93 We have already seen one description of substance by the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 2 45 Ikhwan as something 'self-existent and receptive of attributes (al-#_fot)' .<J<� However, they had an alternative description in which their analysis of substance led them Neoplatonically to matter and form95 rather than to the atomism of, for example, al-Baqillani (d. 1013), a principle of whose metaphysics was that everything (except God) consisted of indivisible atoms and accidents.96 The Ikhwan wrote: 'Know that form (al-�ura) is of two kinds: constitut­ing (muqawwima) and completing (mutammima). The scholars called constituting forms substances (iawiihir) and completing forms accidents (a'ra4).'97 They later defined their terms as follows: the constituting form (al-�urat al-muqawwima) of some­thing was that which could not be separated from its matter without the thing itself ceasing to exist. Completing form (a/-�urat al-mutammima ), on the other hand, was that which raised the object to the best state which it could attain. But, if it were separated from its matter, the matter did not disappear. They gave as examples of completing form silence and movement: if they were separated from the body, the body did not cease to exist. However, length, breadth and depth were considered to be con­stituting forms whose removal from matter meant the cessation of the body in question.98 The lkhwan used the same terms in a rather more complicated fashion further on in the Rasa 'if with a variation on the previously expressed idea that what was form to one thing was matter to another. They again used their favourite image of the dress but this time made a contrast between two types of form, rather than Aristotelian matter and form. Here, in this passage, the words 'substantial' and 'accidental' could easily be replaced by 'neces­sary' and 'unnecessary' or 'essential' and 'non-essential': Know, 0 brother, that every one of these forms is a constituting form for something, either substantial (jawhariyya) to it, and completing for something else, or accidental ('ara4iyya) to it. The difference between them is that the substantial constitut­ing form for the thing is that which, if separated from the matter, means that the existence of the thing itself ceases. The accidental completing form is that which, if separated from the matter, does not mean the cessation of existence of that matter, for example sewing is a constituting form for the nature (dhat) of the dress and substantial to it, because by it the cloth becomes a dress. [Sewing is, however,] a completing form to the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"46 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS cloth and accidental in it because if the sewing were taken away from the cloth, the existence of the dress would cease, but the existence of the cloth would not cease. The chain of reasoning is continued to a point where it is stated that if the second principle, the Intellect, ceased, then the First Creator, God, would still remain.')<} Elsewhere, the Ikhwan envisaged substance in yet a third way, relating matter and form to it within the framework of a kind of hierarchy of being: substance is divided into two kinds, corporeal and spiritual. Corporeal substance comprises the celestial and the natural while spiritual substances are divided into matter and form. Form is divided into the separable, for example the soul and the intellect, and the inseparable, for example shapes and colours.100 This kind of division is repeated many times through­out the Rasii 'if, and does not occur only with the Aristotelian categories. It is typical of the obsessive desire for order which characterises the writings of the lkhwan and which led them to multiply hierarchies, and divide up concepts, in a vain attempt at perfectly comprehending and embracing the whole universe of Allah. Enough has now been said for it to be clear that the Ikhwan looked at the concept of substance in a variety of ways. De Boer's observation that the Encyclopedia of the Rasa 'if 'does not express itself clearly' on points of substance and accidents is surely a gross understatement. 101 There appears to be little real purpose or clear methodology behind the statement of so many different descrip­tions of substance, composed so eclectically from both Aris­totelian and Neoplatonic sources. Some of Aristotle's concepts are metamorphosed indeed, but the average member of the brotherhood established by the Ikhwan cannot have found such a number of differing definitions helpful in his mission. Although the Ikhwan dealt formally with four separate treatises from the Organon of Aristotle, devoting a whole chapter to each, only one work from the Neoplatonic corpus attracted such atten­tion. This was the Eisagoge (Arabic: isaghuji) of Porphyry ofTyre, who was both disciple and editor of the great Plotinus. It was written as an introduction to Aristotelian logic as found in the Categories, and dealt with five concepts (species, genus, differ­ence, property and accident) which frequently appeared in Aristotle's works. These five terms are sometimes called 'voices',"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 2 47 from the Latin, or 'predicables', since they attempted to classifY what might be predicated of a given subject.102 Porphyry's work had an enormous influence on succeeding generations: the early scholastic Boethius (c. 480-c. 524) wrote a well-known Latin commentary on the Eisagbge, thereby fostering the argument about universals in the Middle Ages which so exercised the minds of such scholars as the Frenchman Peter Abelard (1079-1142). Right from the time of al-Kindi, who died some time after AD 866, with whom Arab philosophy may be said to start, Muslim philosophers were familiar with the Eisagoge and, indeed, the work became as cherished in the Islamic world as it had been in the Graeco-Latin West.103 Porphyry is the only Neoplatonist whose name is mentioned in the Rasa 'if and, of his corpus, it is only with the Eisagoge that the Ikhwan seem to have been acquainted.104 Even so, apart from the actual chapter devoted to it, the Eisagoge and its author are mentioned very infrequently105 when compared, for example, with references to another ancient authority, the Alexandrian astronomer and mathematician Ptolemy, and his work the A Images!. 106 In the list of contents at the beginning of the Rasa 'if, the Eisagoge is described as an aid to learning the difference between logical, linguistic and philosophi­cal speech107 and later is introduced as follows: 'Porphyry the Tyrian wrote a book which he called Eisagoge, and it is the introduction to the craft of philosophicallogic.'108 The opening of the lkhwan's chapter dealing with it differs somewhat from that of Porphyry's treatise for the former discusses speech and such items as the reason for the enmity between the owls and the crowsY:JY However, the subject matter soon becomes similar as the lkhwan too discuss the various terms or predicables of Porphyry, showing how they differ from each other, though as usual the description is done in a shortened and simplified man­ner. The Ikhwan's most important contribution in their assessment of Porphyry's work was the addition of a sixth term, the individual (al-shakh�). to the Tyrian master's standard five. They observed that, in an attempt at making thought more precise, philosophers had employed six key terms. Three were used to designate sub­stances (a/-a'yan) or objects which possessed attributes, while three indicated the attributes (al-�ifot) themselves. The first group comprised the individual (al-shakh�). the species (al-naw'), and the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"48 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS genus (a�jins), while the second was composed of the difference (al-f�l), the property (al-khlif�a) and the accident (a/- 'arat/). They defined this extra term of theirs, the individual, as a phrase designating a created being which was quite distinct from any other and which could be perceived by one of the senses, for example this man, this riding animal, this tree, etc. 110 It is quite possible that the term was borrowed from al-Kindi, 111 who lived through one of the most intellectually vital periods of the 'Abbasid caliphate and was the only other besides the Ikhwan to espouse a doctrine of six voices or terms in Arabic philos­ophy.112 Alternatively, depending on the date of composition which is assigned to the Rasa 'il, the Ikhwan may have been familiar with 1he Keys of the Sciences (Mafotil! a/- 'Ulum) of al­Khawarizmi (fl. c. 975) or at least with his contemporaries who knew this work. In it al-Khawarizmi defined 'the individual', under the heading Eisagoge, as '[a term used] by logicians to designate Zayd and 'Amr and this man and that donkey and horse' .113 The number-oriented Ikhwan may have added the term, for the sake of symmetry and completeness, to the fivefold list of Porphyry.114 In any attempt to assess the importance of the role of Neo­platonism in the Rasa 'il attention should be paid to the difficulties and problems which both the Neoplatonists and the Ikhwan encountered. It has already been shown that the two groups shared much in the way of doctrine, but the problems with which they wrestled were, perhaps inevitably, dissimilar. Many of Plotinus's doctrines could be developed in opposite ways. Matter, for example, was identified with evil but, since Matter was a product of God, could it be considered as absolutely evil? If The One could not be limited how could It remain at the top of a metaphysical hierarchy since this would imply limitation by mak­ing It a member, albeit the chief one, of that hierarchy? These and similar questions to which the sometimes ambiguous thought of Plotinus gave rise were left as a legacy to succeeding generations of Neoplatonists who attempted to systematise and clarifY his thought, and justifY or rectifY his twisting of Platonic texts to suit his own arguments.11S However, the problems which the lkhwan inherited, and to which they tried to provide their own answers, were somewhat different. They were much more interested in such Mu'tazilite issues as the attributes of God and the status of the Qur'an, free"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 2 49 will and predestination, and the role of the Imamate.116 Listing examples of beliefs which were injurious to the soul, and thus the source of dispute, the lkhwan included the beliefs that the world was uncreated, that it had two creators (one good and one bad), that the expected lmiim was hidden for fear of opposition, that God did not forgive sins and that he put evil-doers in Hell and revived them periodically for fresh torture after their bodies had been burned up. 117 Yet the final goal towards which the Neoplatonists, the Ikhwan, and, of course, the Sufi mystics strove was remarkably similar. All yearned for union of one kind or another with the deity, and saw the interior life of the soul as a haven of security and dependability in periods of turmoil, stress and change. Plotinus lived during perhaps the most troubled era in the history of the pagan Roman Empire-that which extended from the death of ,\\1arcus Aurelius in :\\0 180 to the advent of Diocletian as emperor in .\\D 28411H -and the conflicts with Christianitv which followed the conversion of Constantine cannot have add�d to a feeling of security on the part of the later Neoplatonists. The tenth century \\O also witnes­sed its share of upheavals in the Islamic world such as the Buyid seizure of Baghdad in \\D 945; Sufism would have appeared a welcome refuge from both political and sectarian conflict. It is true that the methodology of the three groups differed. Thus the Ikhwan preached throughout their Rasa 'if that salvation was to be achieved by purification of the human soul and brother­hood. Such purification could be attained by the pursuit of a Socratic-type wisdom, Christian asceticism and .\\1uslim religious devotion.11'1 Abstinence from worldy pleasures was particularly enjoined on the legislator (wiitf,i' al-shari'a). With Plotinus, how­ever, purification was achievable only through philosophy.120 But the goal of union with God was the same for all. For Plotinus it was only mystical union that could finally breach the veil and reveal the true nature of the unknowable One: 121 such union could not be described in words for the vision of The One was beyond all description. 122 Porphyry tells us that his master experi­enced such a state of mystical union four times during the six-year period in which Porphyry knew Plotinus in Rome, and claims also that a similar single experience happened to himself in his sixty­eighth year.123 The Ikhwan do not make any comparable confessions of mysti­cal experience in the Rasii 'if but their intentions are not the less"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"50 MUSLL\\1 NEOPLATONISTS clear because of that; they seek to 'be near the Merciful One of glory and honour'124 and manifest mystical tendencies which have much in common with the Sufis: the ideal man is described as being Sufi in his whole way of life.125 This pointed spiritual espousal of mysticism by the Ikhwan is emphasised in the hier­archical organisation which they erected, which had much in common with the later Sufi orders. The similarity between a lot of the cosmological content of the Rasa 'if and Sufism has been emphasised, as has the lkhwan's usage of Sufi love symbolism: God, as we have seen, is termed 'The First Beloved', 126 and other Sufi terms, such as Abdii/,127 are to be found scattered in the text of the Rasa 'if, as well as Sufi stories-the chapter devoted to music includes one about a Sufi who dies from his longing to return to God.t2s Akin to the Sufi element in the Rasa 'if, and sometimes difficult to separate from it, is a Hermetic strand. It was the Egyptian God Thoth who became Hellenised under the name Hermes Tris­megistus, and Hermes (Hirmis) passed into Arabic in a number of forms, the principal being Enoch (Akhnukh) and Idris. To him and to his successors were attributed a whole corpus of philosophical, magical and scientific works.129 He is mentioned several times by name in the Rasa 'if and given the epithet 'threefold (a/-muthallath) in wisdom'.130 The epistles of the Brethren tell how Hermes, 'who is Idris the prophet, peace be upon him', went up to the sphere of Saturn and rotated with it for thirty years until he had witnessed all the states of the sphere. He then returned to earth and taught the people about astrology.131 The Ikhwan manifest a deep liking and respect for the Corpus Hermeticum and seem to have plundered it for much astrological, alchemical and antediluvian information; indeed, the end of the Risala on magic is riddled with a variety of quotations attributed to Hermes himself; 132 the Ikhwan indulge in a rare spasm of preci­sion, as far as these Hermetic writings are concerned, by citing his 'fourth book' as a source of information about the creation of Adam.133 They laud Hermes, too, as a peacemaker between man and the jinn and, somewhat anachronistically, characterise him as a bearer of Islam and its holy law.134 However, perhaps the most potent Hermetic influence discern­ible on the Rasa 'if as a whole is the prominent role allotted to astrology. Indeed, the Ikhwan actually say at one point that it is only by a knowledge of astrology that man can attain Heaven.135"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"THE LEGACY OF GREECE 2 51 The planets and stars are described as 'angels of God'136 which exercise a profound influence over human destiny, but the reader of the Rasa 'if is warned that only those deeply versed in the divine and astrological sciences can really understand or know much about this.137 They were complex sciences, requiring much study, for each star had its own different qualities, characteristics and influences.138 For example, the man whose ruling planet was Saturn would be unlucky in his worldly affairs.13'� All the periods of man's life were subject to the rule of the stars from the foetal stage onwards.140 These stars could be used to gain information about a pregnancy and discover the sex of a child, and to find out the whereabouts of a thief and whether an absent person was sick or well.141 However, the Ikhwan castigated those who used astrol­ogy to predict the future, for knowledge of the unseen or unknown (af-ghayb) was the preserve of God alone and no good could come to any human being by knowing the future.142 There were thus permissible and impermissible uses to which the knowledge of astrology could be put. There were contradictions, too, in their espousal and usage of such an art which were not reconciled in their writings. The Hermetic belief in the ruling influence of the stars, which per­vades so much of the Rasa 'if, was in direct contradiction of the Mu'tazilite concept of free will which the Ikhwan also believed in. In the epistles it was admitted that no one could act without God's assistance but that this assistance was never forced upon man who was free to act, or abstain from action, just as he chose. Thus a man could freely choose to use the power which resided in his tongue to speak or to be silent and, similarly, he could elect to open or close his eyes according to his choice.143 Apart from astrology there are a number of lesser Hermetic influences on the Rasa 'if as well. For example, since the number four was considered sacred to the God Hermes, perhaps it is in the Corpus Henneticum, and eclectic works of antiquarian lore such as the Saturnalia of the Neoplatonist Macrobius (fl. c. AD 400), rather than elsewhere that the origin of the Ikhwan's enthusiasm for that number should be sought. 144 The question inevitably arises of how such influences were transmitted to the Ikhwan. It seems highly likely that they had direct access to some Hermetic literature since they specified that their list of twenty­eight lunar mansions was drawn from the Hermetic work entitled a�As(itas,145 and they reproduced, almost literally, the last part of"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"52 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS this work dealing with these lunar mansions in their fifty-second and last Risala on magic. 146 Some influence must also have been felt from such pagan astrological groups as the Sabaeans who flourished in I:Iarran (Northern Mesopotamia), and later in Baghdad, particularly during the ninth and tenth centuries AD.147 In fact, one scholar has viewed the doctrine of the Ikhwan, in at least some respects, as an extension of Sabaean doctrine.148 The Middle East has been a cauldron of diverse and frequendy conflicting beliefs from time immemorial, and it is now clear that the Brethren of Purity were open to influence by many of the Greek sages' doctrines which bubbled subversively in that caul­dron. They took much from Pythagoras and Aristode and even more from Plotinus; indeed, it has righdy been remarked that the pages of the Rasa 'if are permeated with the Neoplatonist doctrine of emanation.14') So it should be no surprise that they found Hermes Trismegistus, with whom the lithe figure of the Greek messenger God Hermes had rapidly become identified, and the Hermetic writings, equally attractive. The Rasa 'if are a veritable mixture of Neoplatonic, Sufi and Hermetic elements. When it is added that such elements were, nonetheless, unable to prevent an Islamic ethos from pervading the work as well, so that some ideas like the role of God and free will were treated both Islamically and Neoplatonically or Hermetically, it will be realised just how dis­tinctive and syncretic was the flavour which the Ikhwan imparted to their Rasa'if."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR The Christian and Judaic Substrate CHRISTIANITY AND THE RASA '/L Judaism, Christianity and Islam may all be termed 'Abrahamic religions' for all three religions acknowledge a common ancestor in Abraham.1 The Jewish deity referred to Himself in the Old Testament as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,2 while Christ, in the New Testament, was at pains to stress that the faith which He brought was compatible with the religion of Abraham.3 St Paul stressed the same theme when he observed that by belonging to Christ one was automatically an heir of Abraham.4 Islam in turn had an enormous respect for Abraham and con­sidered the prophet to be part of the very fabric of the religion. He was revered by Muslims as one who had never been a Jew or a Christian, and certainly not an idolator, but was rather a Muslim himself and the builder, moreover, oflslam's most sacred shrine, the Ka'ba in Mecca.5 It was certainly a tradition of which the Ikhwan approved and which they wished the Rasa 'i/ to reflect: proclaiming that their way of thought was 'the religion [or creed] (mil/a) of our father Abraham',l•theyquoted the Qur'an and asked their readers: 'Who therefore shrinks from the religion of Abraham, except he be foolish-minded?'7 This illustration of how the patriarchal Old Testament figure of Abraham is shared by Islam is just a single example of how profoundly syncretic Islam is, with its many Jewish, Christian and pagan elements.

The full extent of the permeation of the Rasa 'if by Christian thought and scripture has not been appreciated. It is true that most commentators agree that they contain such elements9 but there exists no full survey or analysis of them which might provide some indication of their richness and number. It is therefore worthwhile, before evaluating the influence of Christianity on the Rasa 'if, to try and assess the accuracy of the Ikhwan's knowledge of this religion. The lkhwan must have had easy access to copies of the New Testament for the brother is advised by them to read the Gospel (a/-/nji/).10 Certainly, a number of Arabic versions would have been available by their time; from the eighth century AD the Christians of Syria possessed Arabic translations of the Gospels and there were also Arabic copies of New Testament apocrypha in circulation in addition to the canonical Gospels.11 The differ­ences in language in the transmission of the same Gospel quota­tion by the lkhwan in different parts of the Rasa 'il may attest to the variety of translated texts which they had at their disposal. Jesus is casually mentioned many times in the Rasa 'if, fre­quently as an example of prophethood in conjunction with, for example, Zachary and John the Baptist12 or Moses and Abraham. 13 He is generally called the Messiah or Christ (al­Masi�)14 or simply Jesus ('/sa),15 but occasionally Jesus Christ (isa 'l-Masi�).16 Once He is alluded to as 'Son of the Father (Ibn al-Ab)'17 but the common Qur'anic title 'Son of Mary' is absent from the Rasa 'if. Similarly, the Ikhwan frequently cite the Gospel, usually with the Torah and Qur'an 18 but occasionally with 'the prophetical books'19 or the Psalms,20 as an example of a prophetic, revealed book, thereby underlining the particular respect which Islam always showed towards 'The People of the Book'. The Christianity in the Rasa 'if, however, goes far beyond mere casual reference and illustration, and it is clear that the lkhwan were familiar with a large portion of Christian scripture. It is possible from the data provided in the Rasa 'if not only to construct an accurate and chronological picture of the life of Christ but also to show that the Ikhwan were conversant with a number of Christian doctrines and the dissensions to which these doctrines sometimes gave rise. Apart from a few aspects, which will be"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN A�D JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 55 commented upon in the course of the following survey, the life of Christ according to the Ikhwan corresponds to that delineated by the four evangelists in the Gospels. We may begin with the crude formulation of the incarnation doctrine put into the mouth of an incense-swinging, chanting Syrian Christian at the Debate of the Animals: 'Praise be to God who made the body (jasad) of the humanity (al-nasut) from the Virgin Mary, and joined the substance (jawhar) of the divinity (al-lahut) to it, and confirmed him with the Holy Spirit (RiP} al-Qudus) .... '21 The reference to the two natures is interesting and there seems little doubt that the Ikhwan were aware of the Christological controversies between the Nestorians and the Monophysites.22 The words nasut and lahut in the formulation here were Syriac in origin and were used in that language also to denote the humanity and divinity of Christ. Later both were adopted as part of the Arabic Sufi vocabulary.23 Furthermore, the Ikhwan specifically cited the Nestorians and Monophysites as yet two further examples of sectarian strife.24 It is possible that the Syrian Christian at the Debate was intended to represent a Nes­torian but we are not told. However, the last phrase of his formula­tion seems to have been inspired by the Qur'an, where, however, the Holy Spirit whom he mentions is more likely to be a reference to the angel Gabriel, or Allah Himself, rather than the third Person of the Christian Trinity.25 The Qur'an may also have been responsible for the references in the Jami'a to Jesus speaking to the people in the cradle, in another, more astrological, description of the incarnation, though this tradition was common in both Christian and Muslim circles and is to be found in The Arabic Gospel of the lnfoncy as well as in the Sira of Ibn lshaq (c. 7 40-c. 767) which Ibn Hisham (d. 828 or 833) edited.26 We are not told a great deal in the Rasa 'if about the early life of Christ and in this, of course, these epistles parallel the Gospels. There is a fleeting reference to Him in the Temple of Jerusalem 'at the beginning of His mission' and this is most likely an allusion to the twelve-year-old Jesus being discovered after three days by His frantic parents talking with the scholars in the Temple of Jerusalem. The incident is seen by the Ikhwan to be similar to the way in which Moses began his mission by first informing Aaron and other friends, and the way in which Muhammad began his by first informing his wife Khadija and then various friends.27 In the Rasa 'if Christ recruits some of His followers not from"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"56 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS humble fishermen but from a company of bleachers whom He meets by the wayside. Yet they obey the call in exactly the same way as the Apostles of the Gospels and, putting on patched garments, accompany Christ on His journeys.28 He tours the length and breadth of Palestine during His earthly ministry to rescue the people of Israel from 'the death of sin' and He is represented by both evangelists and Ikhwan as a miracle worker.2'� It is a double mission in which physical ills are cured and men are summoned to the Kingdom of God.30 After John had been imprisoned by Herod, John's disciples came to Jesus to question Him about the nature of His mission. Christ reassured the confused John through them by referring to His miracles; in a similar way the Ikhwan reassured their audi­ence that it was correct to believe in the immortality of the soul and its blessedness after leaving the body, by citing the ordeal to which Christ subjected His humanity by His death, and the miracle of the resurrection, as indications of the belief of all the prophets in such immortality.31 Here, of course, Christ's prophethood was viewed quite differently from that of Muham­mad: it was never a tenet of Islam that miracles were a prerequis­ite, or characteristic, of the latter's mission. 32 It is true that Jesus Himself on occasion refused to work miracles in the Gospels to prove Himselfl3 but elsewhere His compassion for the sick and the needy provoked the expected sign. The Qur'an itself depicts Christ as a miracle worker as, for example, in the miracle of the table. The Apostles test Jesus by asking Him if God is able to send down a table from Heaven from which they can eat. Jesus prays to God and His prayer is heard but God threatens dire punishment for anyone who disbelieves after the miracle. The Qur'an also refers, a few verses earlier, to Christ's healing the blind and the leprous and raising the dead.34 So with both Muslims and Christ­ians Jesus is endowed with supernatural powers; indeed, the Christians of Najran claimed that Christ was divine because ofHis miracles35 and, of course, it was one of the charges made by medieval Christianity against the prophethood of Muhammad that it was not confirmed by any. The Ikhwan recognised that Christ's miracles took place in the soul also: the blindness of the people was spiritual as well as physical and was healed by the application of what the Ikhwan termed 'spiritual substances (al-jawahir al-ritJ}Zmiyya)'. (The Arabic word for 'application' used here (ikti�al) is particularly"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE CHRIST!Al\\ AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 57 vivid since it means basically 'coating the eyelids with kohl'.) Likewise, the sickness of deeply rooted ignorance could be cured by praising God and confirming His oneness.36 Christ had con­siderable sympathy and pity for the people to whom He was sent: in the Gospel of St Luke He weeps over the fate which He foresees will overtake Jerusalem in punishment for the obduracy oftheJews,37 while in the Rasa 'if He feels compassion for the Jews who profess the religion of Moses but cling only to the externals of its law. They understand neither the Torah nor the prophetical books and only seek the things of this world, ignoring the here­after.38 He begins to go round the places frequented by the Jews, warning them, and speaking to them in parables:3<J the wheat will be carried to the granaries but the tares will be burned in the fire.40 One of the fullest and most striking examples of Christ's teaching in parables in the Rasa 'if occurs in His encounter with the company ofbleachers. He asks whether they would permit the clothes which they have just washed and bleached to be worn by their owners if the bodies of those o\\\\'ners were soiled with blood, urine and excrement. When they reply that they would not, and that anyone who did so would be a fool, Jesus tells them that they have done just that already. The astonished bleachers ask how this is possible and He tells them that they have cleansed their bodies and whitened their clothes, but their souls are filled with the tilth of ignorance and blindness. He urges them to seek the Kingdom of Heaven, and the bleachers leave all and follow him.41 The incident does not occur in the canonical Gospels but in the apocryphal Gospel of Philip there is a story slightly akin to this in which Jesus enters the dyeworks of Levi and throws seventy-two colours into a vat. When He takes them out, they are completely white and Christ comments that the Son of Man's mission is similar to that of the dyer.42 However, perhaps the Rasa 'if episode is much more strongly reminiscent of Jesus's outburst against the scribes and the Pharisees in the Gospels when He scourges them verbally for their hypocrisy and likens them to tombs whose exteriors have been whitewashed and made to appear beautiful while their interiors are full of bones and corruption.43 Indeed, the Christ of the Rasa 'if also castigates the bleachers because their very souls are 'soiled with corpses'.44 The themes of purity and purification were dominant ones in both the Old and New Tes­taments, just as they were in the Rasa 'if. It is probable, therefore,"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"58 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS that the origins of the lkhwan's story of the bleachers lie in one of the many biblical references to these themes, such as the Transfiguration scene where Christ's garments become whiter than any earthly fuller could ever bleach them.45 Of course, where His audience had already been purified by reading the Torah, prophetical books and wisdom literature, Christ did not need to speak in parables and symbols, and He could speak directly and plainly to the hearts of men.46 In the Rasa 'if He is also portrayed speaking to the stones and the trees and, indeed, all that He passes by the wayside; perhaps the closest parallel in the Gospels is when Christ turns to the fig-tree, curses it, and it withers up.47 Any speech by Christ to non-humans, however, may be regarded as being within the prophetic tradition oflslam. We note, for example, Solomon's speech to the hoopoe bird in the Qur'im.4s The story of Christ's passion, death and resurrection according to the Ikhwan contains a curious mixture of counsels given during the Johannine account of the Last Supper and during Christ's various appearances after the resurrection.4l) In outline, though, it follows the basic pattern of the accounts given by the four evangel­ists. It begins in traditional fashion with Herod seeking to kill Jesus: 'He was sought by the King of the Jews and their rabble. While the people were assembled around Him, He was assailed and an attempt was made to seize Him. But He avoided them and they were unable to catch Him .... '50 Both the New Testament and the Rasa 'if extol the obedience of Christ to the will of His Heavenly Father, especially when faced by His passion and death: 'Christ was content with the decree of God and submitted to destiny and surrendered His humanity (nasutahu) to the J '51 ews .... -Knowing that the appointed time had come, Jesus gathered His disciples to celebrate the Passover. The Rasa 'if make no mention of this feast here, nor of the breaking of bread and the institution of the Eucharist which took place during the Supper; but the words which Christ speaks bear a marked resemblance to those in the Gospel accounts, though they are occasionally infiltrated with Qur'anic material: 'When God most high wished to take Him unto Himself, and raise Him to Him, His disciples gathered with Him in Jerusalem in a single room with His companions, and He said: \"I am going to My Father and your Father, and I will lay a commission on you before I leave My humanity (nasuti).\" '52 The"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 59 first phrase here is clearly drawn from the Qur'an, where God addresses Jesus thus: 'Jesus, I will take thee to Me and will raise thee to Me.'53 So, during the course of the meeting, in the Ikhwan's account, Jesus makes a missionary covenant with His disciples and states that He will have nothing to do with the man who does not accept His commission, a statement reminiscent of His Gospel dictum that the man who did not support Him must necessarily oppose Him.54 Jesus continues: Go to the kings at the ends [of the earth] and inform them from Me of what I have taught you. Summon them to what I have summoned vou and neither fear nor stand in awe of them. After separating t�om My humanity (niisuti) I will stand in the air on the right hand of the throne of My Father and your Father. I will be with you wherever you go and be your helper, providing you with victory and support, with the permission of My Father. 55 A characteristically Qur'anic concept, which was later adopted by the Mu'tazilite group of philosophers, now intrudes into what has been, up to this point, a very Christian series of counsels: 'Go to them and summon them with friendliness; treat them and command the good and forbid the evi/,56 until you are killed or crucified or expelled from the land. '57 The disciples ask for confirmation of the truth of what He has ordered them to do and Christ replies that the confirmation is that He will be the first to do that. What happens next deviates slightly from the account of the evangelists. Jesus is apprehended, not that night in the Garden of Gethsemani, but the following day while teaching the people. Furthermore, it is Herod, rather than Pontius Pilate, who sen­tences Him to death, though, in fact, neither man is mentioned by name: Herod Antipas is always referred to as 'the KingoftheJews (Malik Bani lsrii 'i/)'-'The next day He went out and appeared to the people; He began to summon them and warn them until He was seized and brought to the King of the Jews, who ordered Him to be crucified. •sR Hereafter the Gospel and Rasa 'if accounts have a marked similarity: So His humanity (nasutuhu) was crucified and His hands were nailed to the two planks of wood of the cross. He remained"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"60 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS crucified from the forenoon to the afternoon. He asked for water and was given vinegar to drink, and He was pierced by the lance. Then He was buried in the vicinity of the cross and forty men were set to guard the tomb. All this took place in the presence of His friends and disciples and when they saw what had happened, they were convinced and knew that He had not ordered them to do anything which He Himself had not done. Then they gathered after three days in the place in which He had promised them that He would appear to them and they saw that sign which was between Him and them. The news spread among the Jews that Christ had not been killed so the tomb was opened and His human body (al-niisut) was not found [there ).59 The nature of the sign which Jesus manifests to His disciples according to this passage is unclear; it could perhaps be a refer­ence to Christ's apparition on the mountain to which the disciples are directed in Matthew 28:16, or, alternatively, to the revelation of His pierced hands and side, first to the disciples in the absence of Thomas Uohn 20:20) and later to Thomas as well Uohn 20:27). The Jews in the Ikhwfm's account differ among them­selves over the story of Jesus, but the disciples go out, without the benefit of the Paraclete, to north-west Africa, Ethiopia, Rome, Antioch, Persia and India, calling on these countries to accept the teaching of Christ. Some of these missionary journeys, which are merely mentioned by the Ikhwan, find lengthier parallels in the Acts of the Apostles. It is clear from all this that the Ikhwan had a considerable knowledge of the life of Christ as depicted in the Gospels. There seems, in addition, to be a Nestorian emphasis on His humanity (niisut), which is frequently mentioned apart from His divinity (liihut); the lkhwan stress, as we have seen, that it is Christ's humanity which is given up to the Jews, His humanity from which He will separate, His humanity which is crucified, and His human body which is found to be missing when the tomb is opened. However, a much more remarkable feature than any latent Nestorianism is that much of what is rejected by orthodox Islamic theology concerning Christ is, in fact, accepted, at least here, by the Brethren of Purity. What one Arab author has termed 'the Christ­ian scandal of the Incarnation' is stated, it is true, in the mouth of a Christian.60 But, as several scholars have noted with surprise, the Ikhwan themselves state that Christ was crucified, died and was"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 61 buried, and clearly imply that He also rose from the dead.61 The fact that the stress is on His humanity is unimportant, for the Qur'anic picture of Jesus, when interpreted by orthodox Islam, is very different:62 Jesus is born of a virgin, under a palm tree,63 and His divinity is denied.64 He is eventually taken up to Allilh:65 ' ... they did not slay him, neither crucified him, only a likeness of that was shown to them (shubbiha /ahum)'.66 In other words, traditional Islam teaches that someone else was crucified in Jesus's place. Such a belief obviously precludes any possibility of resurrection from the dead by a crucified Jesus, human or divine. Elsewhere in the Rasa 'if, however, the Ikhwan are less than complimentary about Christianity and appear to deny some of what they have already affirmed about it. We have seen a similar contradiction emerge from the Ikhwan's conflicting views about the nature of God and, indeed, a tendency towards such contra­diction seems to have been an integral and unavoidable aspect of their syncretic outlook. A further example is the difficulty in reconciling their different definitions, or descriptions, of sub­stance. The Strong Man fJahib al-'Azima)67 at the great Debate of the Animals is in no doubt at all as to the faults of Christianity. He replies at once to the Syrian Christian, who has praised God for the incarnation of Christ, and tells him that he should also have included in his speech the following statement: 'We were infidels and we said: [we believe in] the Third of Three. We worshipped crosses and we ate pork at [our] sacrifice and we told lies and untruths about God.'68 The reference to the Trinity here is clear but the allegation of eating pork at the sacrifice of the Eucharist is a curious distortion of the doctrine of transubstantia­tion according to which the basic elements of bread and wine are transformed substantially, as opposed to accidentally, into the body and blood of Christ. It occurs again in the mouth of the pig at the same debate who asserts that 'the [Christian] sons of Byzan­tium (abnii' a/-Rum) vie in eating our flesh in their sacrifices'. 6'� In another place the Ikhwan refer disdainfully to the man who believes that the Jews killed his lord (rabbahu), that is to say killed God,70 and specifically mention that 'among the false views and beliefs which are injurious to the souls of their believers is that of the man who believes that his creator and his God is the Holy Spirit (/?.W, al-Qudus) whom the Jews killed and whose humanity (niisutahu) they crucified and whose divinity (lahutuhu) fled on seeing the agony which befell His humanity'.71"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"62 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS It may be noted that the description of Heaven which the lkhwan put into the mouth of Jesus in his conversation with the bleachers is more reminiscent of the physical joys of the Muslim Paradise, which have been described as 'a continuous extrapola­tion of sensual earthly pleasures',72 than the Beatific Vision of Christian belief. In the Qur'anic description, the people of Paradise, dressed in silk, lie on couches with neither heat nor severe cold to trouble them, luxuriating in the shade, and drinking from silver and crystal vessels and cups. 73 In the Rasa 'il the Ikhwan note that, since Muhammad came to an illiterate, unedu­cated people, most of the description of Paradise in the Qur'an was necessarily of a physical nature to help them to understand and imagine it better.74 The Jesus of the Rasa 'il follows the example of the Qur'an here and describes to the bleachers a Heaven which is almost equally physical in emphasis, though perhaps not so garish, a Heaven free of death, old age, pain, sickness, hunger, thirst, fear, sadness, poverty, need, tiredness, hardship, distress, envy, hatred, boasting and pride; it is a long list which the Ikhwan recite to stress that the ills of the present world will have no place whatsoever in the next. Paradi�e will be a place of enormous happiness, filled with God's bounty, with angels singing hymns round the throne of God.75 Elsewhere, however, the Christ of the Rasa 'i/ is less physical in His description of Paradise and comes closer to the views held by the Ikhwan on the subject, as He tells His disciples: 'If you follow My example and teaching, you will be with Me tomorrow in the Kingdom of Heaven with My father and your father, and you will see His angels round His throne singing His praises and worshipping Him; you will be there delighting in all the pleasures without food or dn'nk.'76 The lkhwan reacted against the over-sensual view of Paradise held by some Muslim traditionalists and condemned as false the idea that the people of Paradise had sexual intercourse with virgins whose virginity was then restored, and the belief that the birds of Paradise, once eaten, came to life again and flew away.77 Apart from the quotations cited above, which comprise a fairly complete, though brief, survey of the latter part of Christ's life, there remain several other sayings attributed to Christ scattered throughout the Rasa 'i/. These are addressed mainly to the dis­ciples and often find parallels in the New Testament. Several occur more than once with slight differences between each in"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN AND jlJDAIC SUBSTRATE 63 vocabulary and structure. Sometimes several quotations from differing sections of the New Testament are joined to form one speech by Christ in the Rasa 'if. Finally, some of the quotation does not occur in the orthodox versions of the New Testament anyway. As we have seen, the Ikhwan had access to the text of the Gospels, which makes it unlikely that every single Christian quotation of theirs was received by hearsay. So how do we account for the differences in transmission? Did they have several different versions of the Gospel text to draw on, including some apocryphal ones? Or were they merely careless in their quotation? The latter would have been uncharacteristic since they show quite a high degree of accuracy in their citation of sacred texts like the Qur'an, though, admittedly, they would have been much more familiar with this. No definitive answer can be given. During the well-known visit by the Pharisee Nicodemus to Jesus, at night for fear of being seen by the Jews, Jesus tells him in the course of their conversation that a man will never see God's kingdom without being reborn.78 The same phrase is put three times into the mouth of the Christ of the Rasa 'if: 'He who is not born twice will not ascend to the Kingdom of Heaven.'79 In the two succeeding instances, the verb 'ascend' is replaced by the verbs 'enter' and 'see' respectively.80 The exegesis of the quota­tion, of course, differs: Jesus meant rebirth by baptism; the Ikhwan intended it to mean the birth of the soul into a new life at death when, to use their own image, it would find release from its bodily prison. Death was thus a second birth for the soul which endowed it with the ability to travel to the Kingdom ofHeaven.81 We have already dealt with the missionary covenant made by Jesus with His disciples: Go to the kings at the ends [of the earth] and inform them from Me of what I have taught you. Summon them to what I have summoned you and neither fear nor stand in awe of them. After separating from My humanity (nasuti) I will stand in the air on the right hand of the throne of My Father and your Father. I will be with you wherever you go and be your helper, providing you with victory and support, with the permission of My Father.82 A similar amalgam of sayings occurs three more times in the Rasa 'if, each time in slightly different words, and this underlines"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"64 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS the importance which the Ikhwan attached to this kind of coven­ant.83 They too claimed to have sent missionaries out to every stratum of society;84 the whole concept of mission was a common one in the tenth century AD with its abundance of Isma'ili mis­sionaries and the propagation of the Fa timid mission (da 'wa ). The covenant formula in the Rasa 'il appears to have been welded together from a number of verses in the New Testament such as the statement that Jesus is seated at God's right hand, Jesus's promise after the resurrection to remain with His church and His command to preach the Gospel throughout the world.85 It is interesting that the formula becomes more Islamic as it is re­peated: in its last citation in the Rasa 'il, the phrase' My Father and your Father' is preceded by the Sufi style epithet 'The Truth (al-lfaqq)' while the name of God is followed by the traditional formula 'May He be exalted and glorified ('azza wa jalla)'.86 Some of the sayings attributed to Christ in the Rasa 'il have no parallel in the Gospels but are taken directly from the Qur'fm. For example, Jesus tells God: 'If Thou chastisest them, they are Thy servants; if Thou forgivest them, Thou art the All-mighty, the All-wise. '87 This is part of a lengthy reply to a question put to Jesus by God in the Qur'an which the Ikhwim also use in the Jami'a: 'Oh Jesus son of Mary, didst thou say unto men, \"Take me and my mother as gods, apart from God\"?'88 This question is regarded here by the Ikhwan as giving the lie to those disciples of Jesus who exaggerated and said that He was a God, giving Him eschatological titles such as 'Master of the Resurrection (Jal!ib al-Qjyama)' and saying that He would be in charge of the reckon­ing of souls: Among them [the disciples] were those who said that He was alive and did not die with His body in which He was crucified and that God raised Him to Heaven after three days, and that He will return to the world after His concealment (ghaybatihi) and come to earth to take His revenge on the Jews, and that He will reward souls, and many things of this kind, and that He holds the rank of the seventh of the leaders with whom the Resurrection will commence, and He is the Mahdi of the nation.89 This passage is a strange mixture of Christian and Shl'ite thought, with its talk of a crucifixion and an ascension on the one hand, and the references to concealment, or absence, resurrec-"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIA:--1 AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 65 tion, a seventh leader and a Mahdi on the other. The disparity between this account from the Jami'a and the passion narrative from the main body of the Rasa 'if which we have previously examined is very marked. The Ikhwan underline their disap­proval of the disciples' ideas in the Jami'a by citing the Qur'anic Jesus's reply to God's question, 'Didst thou say unto men, \"Take me and my mother as gods, apart from God\"?' Jesus replies: 'To Thee be glory! It is not mine to say what I have no right to. If I indeed said it, Thou knowest it, knowing what is within my soul, and I know not what is within Thy soul; Thou knowest the things unseen. \"XJ The sentiments which the Ikhwan condemn are clearly much more explicit in their attribution of divinity to Jesus and so the condemnation is hardly surprising. Its sweeping nature does, however, tend to undermine, if not contradict, some of what they have previously accepted about Christ in their passion narrative. Here, in theJiimi'a, there seems to be an attempt to play down the role of Jesus and He and His message are elsewhere likened, in a striking simile, to a lump of flesh, or embryo (mu4gha ), for which Muhammad later provided the bones.'Jl At one point the Ikhwan make a basic mistake in assuming that information contained in the Qur'an about Jesus is automatically contained in the Gospels. They write: Christ, peace be upon Him, said in the Gospel: 'Who will be my helpers unto God?' The Apostles said, 'We will be helpers of God.' So He said: 'Be prepared to be killed and crucified if you wish to help Me and be with Me in the kingdom of Heaven with My Father and your Father. Otherwise you do not belong to me.\"12 It is true that this evokes the scene in the New Testament when some of the disciples leave Jesus, and Jesus asks the twelve Apostles whether they will also leave, together with Simon Peter's famous counter-question as to where the apostles should go since their master has the words of eternallife;93 but the first part of the quotation is taken directly from the Qur'an and does not appear in the Gospels as the Ikhwan allege.<J4 The second part is, of course, more biblical, and reminiscent both of Christ's warning that the man who does not bear his cross and follow Christ is not worthy of Him, as well as the prophecy of the persecution and death which His followers will face.'15 There are a number of other sayings put into Christ's mouth in"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"66 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS the Rasa 'if which have no obvious parallels in the Gospels and which also differ with repetition. Thus Christ warns His disciples twice not to squander 'the wisdom (al-�ikma)' by giving it to those unworthy of it, nor to wrong those worthy of it by depriving them of'the wisdom'.<J6 This word is often used in the sense of'spiritual knowledge' in the Qur'an; it is mentioned beside revealed bodies of scripture such as the Torah and Gospel as well as being described as something brought by the Qur'anic Jesus.Y7 The whole phrase is perhaps closest in spirit to Christ's injunction in The Gospel of St Matthew not to fling pearls before swine.'!B Else­where, in a similarly didactic vein, Jesus warns the scholars and jurists that they have squatted on the path leading to the next world and, in consequence, will not reach it; as the lkhwan stress, learning and culture are not guarantees that their possessors will be rightly motivated into seeking the hereafter or that they will use them as aids in achieving it.'!'1 The real key to Paradise is abstemiousness in this world and Christ commends to His disciples a diet of barley bread and clear water on this earth for the aspirant to eternal life.100 Finally, there are quotations and sayings in the Rasa'if which have parallels in Christian scripture, as well as the Qur'an or �adith literature. Both Islam and Christianity emphasise, as we have seen, that many people will find admission to Paradise extremely difficult. The rich man in the New Testament will find access so hard that it will be easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. 101 The same is true for the wicked in the Rasa 'if, which quote the Qur'an, saying:' ... the gates ofheaven shall not be opened to them, nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the eye of the needle. '102 The well-known state­ment that no human eyes have seen, nor human ears heard, the joys and pleasures awaiting the faithful in Paradise also appears several times in the Rasa 'if and has a counterpart in the �adith literature and a probable origin in the Bible. 103 Rashid Rida (1865-1935), who criticised many of the literal descriptions of Paradise which abounded in Islam, considered this definition of the hereafter to be 'the authentic �adith par excellence' .104 The popularity in the Middle East of the concept of an unimaginable Paradise is attested by the appearance of the phrase in such apocryphal Gospels as that of Saint Thomas. ws The foregoing analysis of quotations in the Rasa 'if drawn from Christian scripture is one way of highlighting the Ikhwan's know-"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 67 ledge of Christianity; another method is to examine some of their references to Christian doctrine. For example, they refer several times to the Trinity, which Islam has always understood polytheis­tically as meaning three gods rather than three persons in one God. During the Debate of the Animals the Strong Man cites the belief in 'the Third of Three' as one of the erroneous beliefs of Christianity.106 In this he adheres strictly to the letter of the Qur'iin: 'They are unbelievers who say, \"God is the Third of Three.\" '107 Elsewhere the Christians are alleged to have a preference for grouping things in threes (tathlith) and it is clear that this association derives from the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.108 Considerable emphasis is placed in parts of the Rasa 'if on the sonship relationship of Christ with His Father; the terminology used indicates that the Ikhw:'m were well aware of the Christian belief in Christ as the Son of God. We have already seen this in our examination of the missionary covenant made by Jesus with His followers, where He designates 'My Father and your Father' as 'The Truth (a/-lfaqq)'; HY..J this was a title normally reserved for God alone and, indeed, death was not an uncommon end for anyone who dared to assume such a title in medieval Islam. The mystic al-l:lalHij was brutally executed in AD 922 for, among other things, proclaiming, 'I am the Truth (Ana '1-/faqq).' In another place, the Jesus of the Rasa 'if refers to the throne of 'My Lord (Rabbi)', 110 another phrase whose usage was confined in Arabic to God alone. A slave, for example, was not supposed to call his master rabbi. Turning to the Holy Spirit (RW, al-Qudus), we find that the lkhwan's ideas about the third person of the Trinity are more confusing. Jesus is described in the Qur'an as 'a Spirit from Him [God] (Ru� minhu)' and as 'His Word (Kalimatuhu)'111 and this is echoed by the Ikhwan in the Jami'a: Jesus is 'the Spirit of God and His Word sent down from the heavenly host to Mary, the greatest lady' .112 Here there is an identification ofJesus and Spirit in both the Qur'an and the Rasa 'if, and a possible reference to the logos doctrine enshrined in the first chapter of the Gospel of St John.113 But elsewhere in the Qur'an and the Rasa 'if the identification of RW, is not so simple; as we have seen in the Ikhwan's incarnation description put forward by the Syrian Chris­tian, the line mentioning the Holy Spirit derives from a Qur'anic verse where the reference could very well be to the angel Gabriel"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"68 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS or God Himself. The Ikhwan condemn those who believe that their creator and God was the Holy Spirit crucified by thejews;114 later they state, ' ... there is no God but He, the Holy Spirit', identifying God and the Holy Spirit.115 This Spirit brings inspira­tion to the prophets and is linked, early in the Rasa 'if, with the Universal Soul as the mover of all things.116 The Jami'a tells us that It will be encountered by the good soul in Paradise.117 A Christian synonym for the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete (Arabic: Faraqlit), is also mentioned by the Ikhwan, once in the fifty-two Rasa'i/ and twice in the Jami'a.118 The word is rendered as Baraqlit and each time given the epithet 'The Greatest (a/­Akbar)'. It occurs twice in association with the phrase 'The Expected Mahdi (al-Mahdi al-Munta�r)',11'� who is also termed 'The Seventh (a/-Sabi')', 120 and there seems to be an attempt to link the functions of Paraclete and Mahdi eschatologically. The editor oftheJami'a,J. Saliba, believes that the reference is to the Holy Spirit of Christianity.121 However, many Muslim commen­tators have tried to interpret John 14: 16, and other passages in the New Testament which forecast the coming of the Paraclete, as prophecies of the coming of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad. A theory which has now been challenged states that they were able to do this by confusing the similar Greek words periklutos (illustri­ous or praised) and parakletos (Paraclete). Ahmad was one of the Prophet Muhammad's names and the word derives from the same root as Muhammad: it means 'praised' or, strictly speaking, 'more worthy of praise'.122 Exactly what the Ikhwan intended by their usage of the phrase 'The Greatest Paraclete' is therefore uncertain though it is clear from its various contexts that it has eschatological connotations. Man's sinfulness is acknowledged throughout the Qur'an in its denunciation of such sins as polytheism and theft, 123 though abstract discussion of sin is usually avoided. The first sin of Adam is also condemned 124 and there is perhaps a slight reference here to what became the highly developed doctrine of original sin of the Christian Church. It is made clear in the Qur'an that Adam is severely punished for his sin; he is cast down to earth to suffer in due course the penalty of death: 'Therein you shall live, and therein you shall die, and from there you shall be brought forth.' 125 There is a similar theme in St Paul, who emphasises that death as the result of sin is the fruit of one man's actions.126 The doctrine of original sin embraces two concepts in Christ-"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 69 ianity: it refers to the actual sin which Adam committed, and also to the consequential hereditary stain with which all men are born on account of their origin from Adam. Suffering and death followed in the wake of original sin. It is this latter retributional aspect of the doctrine which finds echoes in the Rasa 'if as well as the Qur'im. The wazir who instructs his king about the story of Adam and Eve emphasises that their expulsion from Paradise was a punishment for their sin.127 There is a recognition that the trials and evils of this world result directly from Adam's sin. Salvation is therefore necessary from the plight into which we have fallen 'through the sin of our father Adam (bi-jiniiyat abinii Adam)', a frequently repeated motif in one form or another.128 For the Christian, man has, of course, been saved and redeemed by the death and resurrection of Christ. But for the Ikhwan it is the mutual help which they themselves can give which will save the neophyte and lead him to salvation from his present plight, 'the sea of matter' and the whole corporeal world which threatens to stifle his soul for ever in its embrace.12\" An assessment of the Ikhwan's knowledge of, and attitude towards, Christianity may now be attempted. Their acquaintance with Christian scripture has already been demonstrated. This was, however, restricted mainly to the New Testament. They show a much slighter degree of familiarity with the Old Testa­ment and the many Old Testament figures found in the Rasa 'if are drawn mainly from the Qur'an, as will be seen in the next chapter, or from Judaic sources other than the Old Testament. (The slight Old Testament influence which is perceptible will be examined at the end of this chapter.) The Ikhwan's New Testament know­ledge betrays at times a Nestorian emphasis on the two natures of Christ and many aspects of the life of Christ, vehemently rejected by orthodox Islam, are accepted by the lkhwan, at least in one place. They knew, too, the ranks of some of the clergy in the Eastern Christian Churches and describe the interior of a typical Greek church.130 All this might lead us to suppose that the Ikhwan's knowledge of Christianity was fairly extensive; but there is doctrinal misinterpretation in the Rasa 'if as well: the Trinity is not properly understood though the Ikhwan could hardly be blamed for this in view of the general Muslim lack of comprehen­sion of what this doctrine entailed. The identity of the Paraclete is unclear and accusations such as the eating of pork at Mass are cited."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"70 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS Their basic attitude towards Christianity seems to have been one of tolerance. Doctrine might on occasion be confused but we do not find the Ikhwan's writing about Christianity filled with the asperity and hatred to be found, for example, in the polemics of the Basran satirist al-Jal;ti� (c. 776-868/9).131 Indeed, the reverse is true at times, as where the Ikhwan advise their brother to read the Gospel. 132 This stems, no doubt, partly from the attitude of tolerance epitomised in the Qur'anic verse of which the Ikhwan quote the beginning: 'Surely they that believe, and those ofJewry, and the Christians, and those Sabaeans, whoso believes in God and the Last Day, and works righteousness - their wage awaits them with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow.'133 But, even more, it is the product of the eclecticism which imbues much of the Rasa 'i/. This attitude of tolerance led the Ikhwan to be influenced by Christianity perhaps more than they were aware: the most important single factor in this was their total acceptance of Christ­ian scripture as a primary source of equal weight with the Qur'an and the Torah. Support is freely sought from all three bodies of scripture to back up their statements, though, of course, verses from the Qur'an predominate if actual quotations from each text are counted. They justifY their belief in the immortality of the soul by referring to the life of Christ and provide, as we have seen, a biography of His passion. Christ is considered to be a missionary with equal powers to Moses in His ability to summon men and jinn to God. 134 Recitation of a verse of the Gospel has a power equal to one from the Qur'an or Torah in protecting the unfortu­nate traveller from the malevolence of the jinn and from going mad in the desert.135 At the Debate of the Animals the Gospel, together with the Qur'an and Torah, is cited as a body of scripture propagating the view that the animal world was created for the benefit and service of man.136 A vivid streak of asceticism also runs through the Rasa 'i/ which finds its true origin in Christianity rather than Islam, though later Islam too had its ascetics and anchorites. The Ikhwan devote a section of one of their Rasii 'i/ to the evils which derive from satiety and they praise the qualities of the abstemious man.137 The brother is urged to preserve a (Mu'tazilite) moderation or mean in all matters of food, drink and movement and to be generous with what he has, sharing money and knowledge, rather like the first Christians of the early church. 138 If he has foreknowledge of some"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 71 future disaster, he may take suitable prophylactic measures such as fasting, prayer, sacrifice, intercession to God and repentance.l39 The ideas of asceticism and monasticism found an early place in the history of the Christian Church, and Islam as it spread could not have avoided coming into contact with them. But the monks upon whom Mul).ammad at one time looked kindly were later condemned as devourers of the people's wealth 140 and early Islam maintained a considerable aversion to monastic practices. G. Parrinder sums it up very neatly: 'The general Semitic attitude to life has been broadly described as \"world-affirming\", as against the \"world-renouncing\" spirit of India and the Far East.'141 A. Guillaume puts it more strongly: 'Nothing could be further removed from the point of view of the ordinary Arab of the Jahiliyya or of Islam than asceticism, as the formidable array of hadith condemning it in all its forms clearly testif)'.'142 As we have seen, the Muslim Paradise is described in very sensual and physi­cal terms, surely a deliberate inducement from the ever-present hardships of Arabian life to one of comfort and luxury in the hereafter. The attitude of the Ikhwan then, in applauding the monastic life according to the Christian model ('ala '1-manhaj al-Masi�i), contrasts with the traditional Muslim aversion to such prac­tices.143 Indeed, they acknowledge the Christian origins of their own piety or asceticism when they describe their ideal man as Christian in conduct and Syrian (that is, Christian) in piety or asceticism.144 Any renunciation must, however, be performed joyfully. The Ikhwan clearly do not think much of the Christian monk who states that the path to God is by denial of personal whim or pleasure, and who is so obviously filled with misery because he feels that he can only approach his God by fasting, prayer and suffering. 145 Much more to their liking is the example of the Christian monks who lived ascetic lives in monasteries and cells and bore witness to their belief in the immortality of the soul by the indifference with which they treated their bodies.146 JUDAISM AND THE RASA'IL If we turn now to the Judaic substrate of the Rasa 'it we find that the impact of Judaism is rather less than that of Christianity. It is true that the Torah is frequently invoked with the Qur'an and"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"72 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS Gospel to substantiate the doctrines of the Ikhwan 147 but quota­tions from the learned rabbis, similar to the quotations of Christ's sayings from the Gospels, are notably absent. The principal repositories of Jewish thought in the Rasa 'if are the Judaic stories and traditions which the Ikhwan transmit. The slighter impact of Judaism on the Rasa 'il may have been due to a more limited knowledge of the religion. Certainly, they knew of the Jewish expectation of the Messiah 1411 and they were also aware that Judaism shared Islam's rejection of pork. But this prohibition was wrongly attributed by the spokesman of the pigs at the Debate of the Animals to the enmity between the Jews and the Christians. WJ The Ikhwan's knowledge of the pre-Christian Book of Deuteronomy cannot have been great for they seem unaware of the prohibition against eating pork which is to be found here.150 At this Debate of the Animals the Strong Man briefly compli­ments the Jews on being a source of Greek science in the days of Ptolemy, but it is stressed by the Greek delegate, to whom the Strong Man is talking, that these sciences were not indigenous to Jewry: Solomon's magic arts did not originate with himself but were borrowed from other nations which he conquered.151 After the Jewish delegate's enthusiastic eulogy of his Creator, the Strong Man seizes the opportunity to stress the bad qualities of the Jews and his view accords with that held by Mu\\lammad later in his career after the latter's abortive attempts to reconcile Judaism and Islam in Medina. In a virulent indictment, which echoes a Qur'anic verse, the Jews are accused by the Strong Man of being apes and swine and worshippers of idols ('[aghut).152 The leader of the birds' delegation appears to accuse the Jews, through the 'Iraqi Jew with whom he speaks, of calling God 'the Third of Three', of saying that 'Uzayr (the Ezra of the Bible), as well as Christ, is the Son of God, and saying that God has the form of a young beardless man. However, it is not clear whether the bird is addressing the man generally as a representative of mankind or specifically as a Jew. If the latter is the case then there is an obvious confusion of Christian and Jewish doctrine, for the Jews have never believed in a Trinity nor that Christ was the Son of God.153 The attribution to the Jews of a belief in Ezra's sonship of God is however, entirely Qur'anic: 'The Jews say, \"Ezra is the Son of God.\" '154 This idea finds no confirmation at all inJewish tradition."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 73 The above views of Judaism are all taken from the Debate of the Animals but they are significant since the speakers in the Debate, whether human, animal or jinn, very often mirror the thought of the Ikhwan themselves. There remain a number of stories and traditions in the Rasa 'il which have a basically Judaic rather than a Christian or Qur'anic provenance, culled from such sources as Midrash, Talmud and Haggadah. Some of the Muslim legend concerning, for example, Abraham, such as appears in the Arabic collections of Stories of the Prophets (Qj�a� a/-Anbiya '), was derived from these sources, and Muslim tradition in turn influenced later Jewish tradition.155 The Ikhwan relate, for example, how Esau wrestled with Nim­rod's son and gained the magic hunting-coat of Adam which the son of Nimrod wore. This coat was covered in pictures of all kinds of wildlife. By placing his hand on the picture of the animal which he desired, the wearer was able to halt and seize the animal. Esau was successful in taking the coat because he followed his father Jacob's advice and asked Nimrod's son to remove the coat, which gave him his power, before they wrestled; the latter did so and lost the contest.156 The giant Nimrod himself, and his adherents, appear in the Qur'an but only in connection with Abraham. The giant is not mentioned specifically by name but he has been identified by Muslim commentators with the man who disputed with Abraham in Sura 2.157 In the Old Testament, which gives very little information about him, he is described as a great hunter158 but this body of scripture contains no parallel to the above story. It is in such sources as the Midrash that more information is to be found about Nimrod: he is portrayed as wishing to kill Esau because of the magic coat which Esau already possesses and which causes all the animals to hurry to him.159 Later Midrash elaborated the story. Thus we find in the eighth­century AD Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer (PirJ;e de Rabbi Eliezer) that as soon as the animals see Nimrod in this coat thev fall before him. So Esau, who is the jealous one this time, kills Nimrod and seizes the magic garment for himself.161' However, the PirJ;e cannot be used here as an uncontaminated Jewish source since it is post­Islamic and was influenced in its accounts of Nimrod and Abraham by the Muslim tradition. 161 It is significant that the Ikhwan specifically state that their account of Ibn al-Namrud and Esau is taken from the Torah (a/-Tawrat) of the Jews and the Christians, written in Hebrew,"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"74 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS Syriac and Arabic.162 Here they appear to use the Arabic word Tawrat in a wide sense to indicate the Old Testament, or perhaps just the Pentateuch, in its original Hebrew, as well as the same text in the Arabic and Syriac translations possessed by the Christians. If this is correct, then their mistaken assumption that their account of Nimrod's son and Esau occurs in it is conclusive evidence that the Ikhwan were much less familiar with the Old Testament than with the New; this is confirmed by several other mistakes in the Rasa 'if. Among the episodes in the life of Nimrod which are noted in the Rasa 'if163 is the notorious attempt by the giant to burn the patriarch Abraham to death. The incident is touched upon in the Qur'an but the story has obvious antecedents in the Jewish tradi­tion as well.164 The Ikhwan's own accounts include a charming anecdote from the crocodile at the Debate of the Animals to the effect that, while Abraham was in the fire, the frog carried water in its mouth and poured it onto the fire to quench the flames.165 In another version the authors of the Rasa 'if relate how the prophet Mul;tammad was asked about the religion (mil/a) of Abraham. He responded with the following story: when Abraham was about to be thrown into the fire the angels in Heaven were filled with pity for him. God therefore suggested to Gabriel that the angel should help him if Abraham sought Gabriel's help. Gabriel finds Abraham in the mangonel which will hurl him into the flames and asks him if he needs anything. The patriarch, because of his great trust in God, replies that he does not need Gabriel. God is moved to save Abraham with the Qur'anic words: '0 fire, be coolness and safety for Abraham!'166 The story is a common one in Arabic literature and often very close to this account. Gabriel's question to Abraham, and the prophet's reply, for example, are stated in words very similar to the Ikhwan's in the writings of the historians al-Tabari (d. 923) and Ibn al-Athir (1160-1233).167 But there is an obvious parallel to all these accounts in the Babylonian Talmud: here, Gabriel asks God to let him go down to cool the flames and deliver Abraham. God replies that it should be He who performs such a deliverance and promises Gabriel that, in recompense, he will later be instrumental in delivering Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah from the furnace of N ebuchad­nezzar.168 The story of Jacob and Laban in the Rasa 'if is attributed by the Ikhwan to 'the second book' of the Torah; this is a clear error for"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 75 the story occurs in Chapter 30 of Genesis, the first book of the Pentateuch and the Old Testament as a whole; the word 'Torah' is obviously used here to render one or other of the latter. The Ikhwim narrate how Jacob seeks leave to go to his own country and tricks Laban into giving him a large quantity of livestock by making Laban promise to give him all his speckled sheep and goats and those which are a mixture of black and white. Jacob then causes his herd to conceive such offspring by placing peeled branches by their watering troughs.16<J It is an account which keeps very close to the version in Genesis. It is followed by another drawn this time from 'the Books of the Annals of the Kings of the Jews', which are obviously the two Books of Samuel in the Old Testament. The Ikhwan, in fact, mention here the famous prophet Samuel who has a book devoted to him, and who is revered for his prophethood by both Christians and Jews. Samuel gives the Jews a king named Saul (called both in the Rasa 'il and in the Qur'an Talut), whom God orders to kill the Amalacites. He does so but disobeys God by not killing their livestock as well. Saul is now no longer worthy of kingship. He begins to kill the magicians but finally has recourse to an enchan­tress himself to conjure up the spirit of the dead Samuel, who foretells Saul's death as a punishment for his disobedience. Saul falls on his spear during the ensuing battle. This account, with its dramatic description of Saul's visit to the enchantress we know as the witch ofEndor, agrees in nearly every respect with that which we find in 1 SamueJ.t70 Here then, in the above stories, are two cases where the mater­ial in the Rasa 'il does accord with the data in the Old Testament. More difficult to trace is a possible source for their sub-chapter dealing with the creation of Adam. They claim that their informa­tion is taken from 'one [or some] of the books of the Jewish prophets'. However, these books are not specified and the attribu­tion is highly questionable since the description of Adam's crea­tion is, in fact, an undisguised account of the four humours theory.171 It is thus much more likely that its real origins are in the humoral pathology of the Hippocratic and Galenic corpus than in any Judaic source. Indeed, both these physicians are named in the Rasa 'il, which contain a number of quotations attributed to Galen.172 The whole creation narrative also possesses other ele­ments which will be recognised as characteristic of the Ikhwan in much of their writing: there are four natures (taba 'i') of heat, cold,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"76 MUSLIM. NEOPLATONISTS dryness and dampness; and four humours (akhlat) of blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile. Furthermore, God teaches Adam the science of medicine and how he may keep his body in good health. One cannot fail to see here the contrast between the medical skill thus taught to the first prophet, Adam, and the Ikhwan's belief that all the prophets and philosophers (including, of course, themselves) were sent as doctors to the souls of other men: 'The prophets, peace be upon them, are the doctors of souls and their helpers and deputies. This is the doctrine of our noble brethren.' 173 The respect manifested by the Ikhwan for Christianity, and epitomised in the equal reverence accorded to the passions of Jesus and Socrates, 174 contrasts strongly with the attitudes of other writers such as al-Jal\"ti?:. The Ikhwan's frequently sympath­etic treatment of Christianity, and the influence which this relig­ion had upon them, must have been significant factors for the commentator who observed that 'in their ideal of the higher life, indeed, the Brotherhood of Purity belong to Christianity rather than to Islam' .175 This treatment also contrasts with that which they themselves gave to Judaism: despite their quotation ofJewish stories, and usage of the Torah as a primary source with the Gospel and Qur'an, the Jewish faith was dealt with less fre­quently, and sometimes viewed less sympathetically; we have noted already the accusations levelled against Judaism at the Debate of the Animals though, in fairness, it must be pointed out that criticism of Christianity at the same Debate is by no means absent. But there is no acceptance ofJewish belief in the same way that the Christian belief in the crucifixion of Christ is accepted in one place by the Ikhwan, contrary to orthodox Islamic teaching. The Rasa 'if also contain a story about a travelling Jew and a Zoroastrian which has a distinctly anti-Semitic flavour. The Zoroastrian, who charitably assumes the mantle of a latter-day 'Good Samaritan' because of the way his religion has raised him, befriends and aids a Jew whose neck has been broken in a fall from the mule which the Jew has earlier tricked out of the Zoroastrian. The self-centred Jew excuses his behaviour by say­ing that this is how his religion has brought him up.176 The Jew thus appears in a very poor light, which contrasts vividly with the admiration in which the Ikhwan held the figure of Christ; indeed, the charitable sentiments and actions of the Zoroastrian in the"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE CHRISTIAN AND JUDAIC SUBSTRATE 77 story would certainly have commended themselves to the founder of Christianity.

Islam; the previous chapters provide some indication of the degree to which the Ikhwan drew on non-Islamic sources. Yet they concealed their own identities so skilfully that modem scholarship, as we saw in the introductory chapter, has spilled much ink in trying to trace the members of the group. There is no record in the Rasii 'if that the Ikhwan themselves ever suffered physical violence or persecution as a result of their writings. Indeed, the fact that they should be able to claim that one of their number had been sent to every group of people, to kings, scholars and workers, 1 and that their epistles, though suspect, should have had a circulation among orthodox Muslims, 2 is a tribute to the way in which they successfully disguised some of the unorthodox implications of their philosophy. Using a vivid metaphor, they referred to themselves as 'sleepers in the cave of our father Adam'.3 Much of their doctrine must also have been hidden from the casual or careless reader, and many of the ordinary people. In one place they gave as their reason for hiding their secrets from the people, not fear of earthly rulers nor trouble from the common populace, but a desire to protect their God-given gifts. In support of this they invoked Christ's dictum not to squander 'the wisdom (al-�ikma)' by giving it to those unworthy of it.4 Yet they were well aware that their teaching might also provoke unrest and so observe in another place that the calamities suffered by the successors of the Prophet Muhammad were a good reason for the Ikhwan's remaining hidden until the right day came for them to emerge from their cave and wake from their long sleep.5 To live safely, it was necessary for their doc­trines to be cloaked in an orthodox Islamic garb. Since they"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"USES OF LITERATURE 79 believed that everything had an internal or esoteric (batin) and an external or exoteric (;iihir) aspect,6 we may say that the external cloak which they used to disguise - or at least, make less obvious to unfriendly eyes - their internal Neoplatonism and eclectic toleration, was woven from the Qur'an. This is not to say that they did not accept the revealed message of the Qur'an; they did, but they went far beyond the Qur'an, and thus this body of scripture provided also an excellent smoke-screen for doctrines which were entirely un-Qur'anic. The corpus of the Rasa 'if is saturated with the Qur'an like a sponge and innumerable quotations bear witness to the Ikhwan's deep familiarity with the basic scriptural text of orthodox Islam. In it the Ikhwan are able to find the source, or at least the justification, for many of their ideas. 7 De Boer provides a key to the Ikhwan's sometimes ulterior motives when he rightly points out that the Debate of the Animals allowed the Ikhwan to use the animals as mouthpieces for what might be questionable if spoken by a human.8 It is striking that the Ikhwan should advise their brethren to read the Christian Gospel and then follow this un­orthodox injunction with a long series of Qur'anic quotations, as if to cloak, or at least minimise, the full impact of their suggestion.'1 When the Ikhwan quote from the Qur'an they do not usually name the sura from which each quotation is taken except, unusu­ally, in three places where strings of verses and accompanying sura references are cited.10 A further exception is Sura 7, al-A 'raj, a title which is usually translated as The Heights or The Battlements, indicating an intermediate place between Paradise and Hell.11 This Sura does stand out from all the others because of the number of references to it, and to the people who inhabit these Heights, in the Rasa 'if; 12 this seems to indicate that the Sura was held in special affection by the Ikhwan. It describes, among other things, the missions of the prophets Noah, Hud, Salip, Lot and Shu'ayb, as well as the conflict between Moses and Pharaoh; and in view of the Ikhwan's concept of the prophets as doctors sent to heal the souls of men it would thus have had a particular significance for them. Quotations are occasionally commented upon, or briefly explained, by the Ikhwan but there are few attempts at lengthy exegesis (tafslr) of the Qur'an in any part of the Rasa 'if. (An exception will be noted a little further on.) The Brethren prefer usually to cite verses in support of a doctrine or view and allow"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"80 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS these to speak for themselves. This is not to say that they were unaware of the controversies in Qur'anic exegesis which flourished through much of the medieval Islamic period. They believed, for example, that Qur'anic phrases such as thumma 'stawii 'alii '1-'arsh, 13 which A. J. Arberry translates as 'then [He] sat Himself upon the Throne' or 'then seated Himself upon the Throne', had been mistakenly interpreted in an anthropomorphic fashion to indicate a physical 'sitting' (julus) by God. Similarly, the Ikhwan protested against attributes such as seeing and speech being applied to God in their literal human sense. For them, only God and the experts in Qur'anic exegesis could interpret properly such phrases and verses and explain how they should be applied to God.14 The Ikhwan believed that the Qur'an had such experts in mind in the verse 'and whoso is given the Wisdom, has been given much good'15 and they would certainly have ranked them­selves among them. It was thus the wise philosopher who was uniquely qualified to undertake the difficult task of interpreting the controversial passages in the Qur'an; this was a view with which the Spanish Muslim philosopher Ibn Rushd (1126-98) would certainly have sympathised. In their dislike of anthro­pomorphism, the Ikhwan were closer to the Mu'tazilites, with their penchant for allegorical interpretation, than the rigid l:fan­bali School with its dogmatic insistence on literalism. As we shall see, however, the Ikhwan's concepts of exegesis of both Qur'an and Islamic tradition were also tinged with the esotericism of the Isma'111s. Sometimes, of course, they felt that no comment was necessary or suitable. This was the case, for example, with the isolated groups of Arabic letters which appear occasionally in the Qur'an, such as the group Kaf, Ha', Ya', 'Ayn and Sad at the beginning of Si�ra 19, 1he Sura ofMary. Although an attempt is made to invest the actual number of such letters with some significance, the Ikhwan conclude that they are really a secret of the Qur'an and that knowledge about them should remain the province of a few select servants of God.16 In one of the rare longer pieces of Qur'anic exegesis in the Rasa 'if the lkhwan discuss the verse 'He sends down out of Heaven water, and the wadis flow each in its measure, and the torrent carries a swelling scum; and out of that over which they kindle fire ... So God strikes both the true and the false. As for the scum, it vanishes as jetsam, and what profits men abides in the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"USES OF LITERATURE 81 earth.'17 This verse is invoked by the Ikhwan as a simile for the prophet-legislators responsible for the establishment of the divine law on earth (wll4i'u '1-niimus), and interpreted as follows: the water sent down from Heaven is the Qur'an, and the wadis flowing each 'in its measure' indicate the human hearts which commit the Qur'anic message to memory according to their individual capacities. The scum borne by the torrent is a refer­ence to the sense conveyed by the words of the Qur'an, a work which contains, on the face of it (�iruhu), a number of ob­scurities (mutashiibihiit). But just as the scum in the verse vanishes like jetsam, so profitless falsehoods and obscurities disappear. The concluding words, 'and what profits men abides in the earth', mean that the words of the revelation (al-tanzil) become fixed in the hearts of all true believers and the wisdom (al-hikma) - that favourite word of the Ikhwan-bears fruit in the minds of men like a good, firmly rooted tree whose branches reach up high into the heavens.18 This exegesis certainly differs from that of more orthodox interpreters of the Qur'an such as al-Baydawi (d. 1286 or later).1'� The desire sometimes to go beyond a superficial or literal (�ir) interpretation of a Qur'anic verse is well demonstrated during the great Debate of the Animals: the king asks for an interpretation of the verse 'We indeed created Man in the fairest stature'.20 He is told that the prophetic books can be explained other than literally and thus the wise man of the jinn firstly interprets the verse as follows: 'On the day when God created Adam the stars were at their most powerful points (fi ashriJfihii),21 the pivots of the zodiac (awtiid a/-buruj)22 were upright, and the time was auspicious with a quantity of matter ready to accept form. So man was endowed with the fairest and most perfect of physiques.' The source of the first part of this highly unorthodox piece of astrological tafiir, which gives the position of the stars, has been traced by Yves Marquet to the Hermetic Kitiib a/­Ustutiis.23 Despite this, the Rasa 'il may be said to 'operate' basically from a framework of Qur'anic orthodoxy. Each epistle, of course, begins with the traditional invocation 'In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate' (except numbers 1 and 13 in the first section on Mathematical Sciences), but nearly every one is also prefaced, more unusually, with the verse '\"Praise belongs to God, and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen.\" What, is God"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"82 ,\\1USLIM NEOPLATONISTS better, or that they associate?'24 The exceptions to this prefatory practice are the early epistles numbered 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, again in the first section. The verse may be intentionally omitted in the latter five since they all deal with works by Aristotle and Porphyry. Its frequent repetition throughout the Rasa 'il, however, underlines the emphasis laid by the Ikhwan on the unity of God, but it may also serve as a useful cloak for more un­orthodox doctrine such as the concept of emanation. The themes of resignation and submission, implicit in the very word Islam, are also emphasised by the frequent quotation of the words 'That is the ordaining of the All-mighty, the All-knowing',25 which are cited after such natural and astrological phenomena as the forma­tion of rain and the return of the sun after winter to the sign of Aries.26 The latter is a splendid image for the emergence of the Ikhwan from their cave of concealment and thus the Qur'anic phrase may be said to underscore this emergence as well. The Qur'an is used throughout the Rasa 'if to document par­ticular doctrines and concepts and there is certainly nothing unusual about this: numerous Arab authors have done likewise. Where perhaps the Ikhwando differ is in their similar usage of the Gospel and Torah. The almost mandatory nature of the Qur'anic documentation is acknowledged at the Debate of the Animals where the mule stubbornly maintains that there is no Qur'anic evidence for human domination over the animals. This is in response to a speech by a human delegate who cites a number of Qur'anic verses in support of the opposite viewY The characterisation and description of each of the major prophets in the Rasa 'if are infused with the Qur'an, though not exclusively influenced by this work. However, A. Guillaume has pointed out that there is a considerable difference between the ways the Qur'an and the Old Testament treat their characters: The stories of the patriarchs and prophets in their original setting are straightforward narratives, which, even if composite in origin, carry the reader forward from the birth to the death of the hero, and present a consecutive, or fairly consecutive, series of events. Not so the Kuran. There the characters are intro­duced to serve their turn as successful preachers in antiquity of the doctrines promulgated by Muhammad in the present.28 The same kind of thing is true of the Rasa 'il. As we have seen,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"USES OF LITERATURE 83 philosophers and prophets of Greek, Jewish, Christian and Mus­lim origin are introduced as evidence of the antiquity of many of the beliefs held by the Ikhwfm, such as the immortality of the soul. Since their description of many of these prophets finds its origins in the Qur'an, it is not surprising that such figures should serve a mainly didactic or illustrative function in the Rasa 'if. What follows is a short survey of the Qur'anic substrate on which the portraits of the major prophets in the Rasa 'if rest, as well as an attempt at identifYing some of the instances where non-Qur'anic material has infiltrated the description. Adam References to the traditional Qur'anic story of Adam and Iblis, and the latter's pride2'1 which prevented him from bowing down to Adam as God commanded after Adam's creation, abound in the Rasa 'if, particularly in the fourth section.30 Despite his faults, the lkhwan are obviously fond of Adam, who is the Islamic prototype of prophethood. They frequently call him 'the Father of Mankind (Abu 'l-Bashar)'31 and acknowledge that he was the first caliph or viceroy (khalifo) to be appointed by God on earth.32 The first title, 'Father of Mankind', is non-Qur'anic but the second derives from God's speech to the angels in Sura 2: 'I am setting in the earth a viceroy (khalifa).'33 We have already encountered one humoral, non-Qur'anic description of the creation of Adam in the previous chapter. Elsewhere there is some Judaeo-Christian description mixed in with the Qur'anic substrate. Adam is created, Qur'anically, from earth (turab)34 but he is also created in God's own image and likeness 'according to some of the revealed books', a clear refer­ence to Genesis.J.s The long hair with which the Ikhwan endow the heads of Adam and Eve is not, however, mentioned in the latter, nor in the Qur'an,36 but both works do tend to support the idea, so fiercely contested at the Debate of the Animals, that man has dominion over the animals, despite the arguments of the mule which we mentioned earlier.·17 Adam names the trees and the animals in Paradise and this is echoed in the Qur'an and the Book of Genesis.3H The Garden of Paradise itself is situated, un­Qur'anically, by the Ikhwan on the Mount of the Ruby (Jabal a/-Yaqut), in the east below the equator.39 However, the idyllic life of Paradise, free from tiredness and care and the need to plough and sow to earn a living, is brought to"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"84 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS an abrupt end by the Fall. 'Azazil tempts Adam and Eve to eat of the forbidden tree. Their eyes are opened and they perceive their nakedness. They are cast out of Paradise onto the inhospitable earth, where they remain lamenting their lot until God takes pity on them and sends an angel-Gabriel in the Islamic tradition -to teach them to plough, sow and cook and generally take care of themselves.411 The name of Adam became a Qur'anic prototype of human rebellion against God and as such it is used in the story in the Rasa 'if of the blind man and the cripple who are compared to Adam and Eve when they are thrown out of the garden from which they steal fruit.41 Noah Noah is one of the prophet-warners who appear in that favourite Qur'anic Sura of the lkhwan's, Sura 7, and he also ranks beside Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad as one of'the Messen­gers possessed of constancy':U He and his people are saved by God in the ark but Noah's son is drowned after trying in vain to save himself on a mountain.4·1 The Rasa 'if refer to the great flood several times by the Qur'anic name af-tufon44 and the word is also used metaphorically: the brother who reads the Rasa 'if is asked whether he would like 'to embark and ride with us in the ship of salvation (safinat al-najat) which our father Noah built, peace be upon him, so as to be saved from the flood of nature (tufon al-tabi 'a) before 'heaven shall bring a manifest smoke (bi-dukhan mubin)\" '.45 This is a singularly striking and evocative metaphor, providing a good indication of just how rich in overtone, yet compact in style, some of the writing of the Ikhwan can be, often uniting themes and phrases from other parts of the Rasa 'if: when speaking of Noah the Ikhwan use the word 'ship' (safina) and, indeed, the same metaphor elsewhere,46 while in another place a Noachic-type flood of water (tufon min al-ma') is envisaged beside a flood of fire (tufon min al-nar) like that which the Ikhwan see promised for the end of time in the Qur'anic words 'when heaven shall bring a manifest smoke'Y Abraham The portrait of Abraham in the Rasa 'if is drawn from Judaic as well as Qur'anic sources. Some of the former, concerning Abraham and Nimrod, have been examined in the last chapter. With regard to the latter, the patriarch is frequently called 'the"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"USES OF LITERATURE 85 friend of the Merciful One (khalil al-RaJ,man)',48 a designation which originates in the Qur'anic statement that 'God took Abraham for a friend (khalil)' .44 The Ikhwan claim that their way of thought and kind of life is 'the creed (milia) of our father Abraham',50 thus buttressing the impression of orthodoxy which they are eager to maintain. Indeed, Qur'anic phrases like 'the creed of your father Abraham' and the more frequent 'the creed of Abraham'51 constitute a recurring motif which appears in various forms throughout the Rasa 'i/.52 These epistles, like the Qur'an, hold that Abraham was the builder of the Ka 'ba in Mecca53 and rank him with such famous builders as Solomon, who was responsible for the great Temple in Jerusalem. The projected sacrifice of Isma'il, who replaces the Old Tes­tament Isaac in many Islamic versions of the story, is invoked by the Ikhwan to make a point about the truth and reliability of dreams. Abraham knew that dreams must contain some truth or he would not have resolved to sacrifice his son, and Isma'il would not have submitted to such a sacrifice.54 Isma'il is saved at the last moment, ransomed 'with a mighty sacrifice'.55 The sura does not specify the nature of this sacrifice but the Ikhwan have no doubts: it was a ram which had grazed on the earth of Paradise for forty years.56 Thus God in His mercy spares the living. Of course, in His power, He can also raise the dead and this is well illustrated by the curious Qur'anic episode, also cited in the Rasa 'if, in which four dead birds are revived by God to show Abraham that He is capable of bringing the dead to lifeY Joseph Joseph is designated, Qur'anically, as 'the true man (al-�iddiq)',58 a title which was also borne by the first successor of Mul;tammad, Abu Bakr. In Joseph, as in David, Solomon and Mul;tammad, are united the qualities of prophethood and kingship. 59 Flung into a well by his brothers,61' he is taken to Egypt by a passing caravan. His brothers return to their father with a bloodstained shirt and claim that a wolfhas devouredJoseph.61 Joseph rises to a position of fame and power and eventually, after inviting his father and mother to Egypt where he greets them, Joseph eulogises God, saying: '0 my Lord, Thou hast given me to rule, and Thou hast taught me the interpretation of tales. 0 Thou, the Originator of the heavens and earth, Thou art my Protector in this world and the next. 0 receive me to Thee in true submission, and join me"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"86 MCSLIM NEOPLATONISTS with the righteous.'62 The Ikhwan interpret the phrase '0 receive me to Thee in true submission' as a desire for death which is accounted both 'a wisdom and a blessing (/!ikma wa ni'ma)', for it finally unites the good soul with all the righteous men who have already passed to eternallife.63 All this is, of course, very much in keeping with the Ikhwan's basic Platonic idea that the body is a prison for the soul. Moses and Aaron Like other major prophets revered by Islam, the figure of Moses occupies a prominent place in the Rasa 'if; he is recognised as one who speaks with God (al-kalim )64 and, indeed, converses secretly with Him as a close friend (naJi).65 Both epithets are based upon verses in the Qur'an.66 His birth is foretold by astrologers and it is stressed that all would have been well for Pharaoh, and indeed Nimrod before him, if the ruler had turned to God, rather than taking the Draconian measures which he did.67 This is certainly un-Qur'anic but most of the rest of the story of Moses and Aaron is presented traditionally, with much Qur'anic quotation throughout the Rasa 'if. The encounter of Moses and Aaron with Pharaoh is a recurring theme and a graphic illustration of the power of good over evil; this is vividly epitomised in the conver­sion of Pharaoh's magicians to the faith of Moses and their acceptance of certain death by crucifixion.68 Moses' story is also briefly summarised by the Jew at the Debate of the Animals: he tells how God parted the sea, drowned Pharaoh and sent down manna and quails to the hungry Israelites.69 In Moses' absence on Mount Sinai some of his people fall into idolatry and worship a golden calf. When Moses returns, he advises the people how to act in order to win God's pardon and orders the true believers to execute the worshippers of the calf with swords. 70 The account of the death of Aaron does not occur in the Qur'an but appears in Islamic legend in a whole variety offorms.71 In the lkhwan's version Aaron asks to be allowed to accompany Moses up the mountain, after those who worshipped the calf have been killed. They meet two men digging a grave and are told that the grave is for the man most resembling Aaron. Aaron is asked to test the grave's width and, removing his clothes, he descends into the grave and the Angel of Death seizes his soul. Moses returns, weeping, to the Israelites with the dead man's clothes and is suspected of Aaron's murder but God clears his name.72 The full"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"USES OF LITERATURE 87 significance of Aaron's removal of his clothes, prior to stepping into the grave, is not brought out in this account but other versions show that Aaron was safe from the power of the Angel of Death while he wore his priestly garb.73 We may compare the story of Aaron in the Rasa 'il with that, for example, given by al-Ya'qubi. The latter relates how Moses was inspired by God to take Aaron up the mountain, where they find a couch (sarir) with robes on it. Aaron puts on the robes, stretches out on the couch and dies. God later shows the dead Aaron on the couch to the people oflsrael so that they know he is really dead, and Moses is cleared of suspi­cion. 74 Here the emphasis is clearly on the putting on of pure new garments prior to death, rather than the removal of prophylactic priestly ones, but the substance of the story, which revolves round the dramatic death of Aaron, remains the same. It may be added that much cross-fertilisation obviously took place between the later Haggadic and Islamic versions of the story and these are sometimes difficult to disentangle.75 For the Ikhwan, Moses is a law lord (�ii.hib shari'a) with author­ity to compel obedience. They contrast him with a strange, Qur'anic figure, whom they and most exegetes identifY as al­Khidr, who was encountered by Moses and his servant at the climax of their journey to 'the meeting of the two seas'. This al-Khidr controls the world of secrets and concealment. There is thus a contrast here between the openness of the divine law (a/-shari 'a), plainly revealed through such prophets as Moses, and the more shadowy, subterranean world of esoteric interpretation and initially inexplicable action, epitomised in the ambiguous figure of al-Khidr. 76 After the death of Aaron, Moses lingers for a few years, engaged, as a lawgiver, in one final task for the wayward children of Israel, the writing of the Torah. Then he too ascends the mountain to die and the Israelites remain for forty years after his death wandering from the right path. 77 David If we compare David with Adam, Abraham or Moses, we find that he appears infrequently in the Rasa 'if. Nonetheless, like Adam, he receives the solemn title of God's caliph or viceroy (khalifo)/8 which is clearly based on the Qur'anic verse 'David, behold, We have appointed thee a viceroy (khalifo) in the earth.'7'� He is also described Qur'anically as 'a penitent (awwab)' as well as one who is 'clement (/!alim)', an epithet used mostly in the Qur'an of"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"88 ,\\1USLIM NEOPLATONISTS God.80 In David, as in Joseph, Solomon and Muhammad, the qualities of prophethood and kingship are united.81 Nonetheless, God's angels have qualities which may surpass even those of the prophets: in a charming sentence we are told that the tunes of the angels as they praise God are better than David's reading of the psalms.82 The portrait of David is not wholly Qur'anic: the reference to David's sending Uriah to the front line of battle so that he will be killed, and David's consequent marriage to Uriah's wife, originates in 2 Samuel and not the scripture oflslam.83 The Qur'an does, however, portray David as feeling in need of some forgiveness and this may derive from the affair of Uriah.84 Solomon Solomon is revered as the builder of the great Temple of Jerusalem85 and he is also endowed with a remarkable empathy with the animal world. Not only can he translate the scientific and wisdom literature of the races he conquers into Hebrew&> but he can also speak the language of the ants and the birds.87 Indeed, it is the hoopoe, 'friend of the prophet Solomon',811 who informs him about the Queen of Saba' (Sheba), known to the Arabs as Bilqis.89 Solomon has power over the jinn, as well as the devils, mankind, and the animal world.'Xl These jinn are forcibly employed in the building of the Temple of Jerusalem, and con­tinue in their task even after the death of Solomon. This is because Solomon dies while resting on his staff and his death goes unsuspected for a whole year until a worm eats through the staff; the staff breaks and Solomon's corpse falls to the ground.91 The lkhwan also respect Solomon as a magician: he teaches his sol­diers how to catch the jinn with spells and produces a book of magic which is found after his death.'12 There can be no doubt about the important role which the major Islamic prophets played in the thought of the Ikhwan. Their names permeate the whole text of the Rasa 'i I and the portrayal of each, as we have seen, is always at least partly Qur'anic. In the four-tier hierarchy of the Brethren, prophets like Abraham, Joseph, Jesus and Muhammad occupy the angelic rank beside philosophers like Pythagoras and Socrates.'13 This is significant for it indicates that revelation and reason are to be treated equally. It heralds an identification of wisdom (�ikma) and philosophy (folsafo), of Islamic �aklm and Greek philosopher.'14 Thus the wisdom of the Qur'an itself is no longer to be viewed as something"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"USES OF LITERATURE 89 completely isolated from Neoplatonism but as a complementary and fertile source of inspiration and backing for the Ikhwan's corpus of doctrine in which both Qur'anic revelation and pagan dogma and philosophy have a place. The Islamic orthodoxy of the former may, at the same time, attempt to cloak the wilder Neo­platonic heresies of the latter from hostile eyes. INDIAN LITERATURE The Rasa 'if contain not only Greek, J udaeo-Christian, and Qur'anic influences but also a variety of Persian, Indian, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, and Manichaean elements as well. The culture of the Eastern Islamic world was clearly as familiar to their authors as that of the Western, and in view of the cosmopolitan nature of the city of Ba�ra, where they are traditionally thought to have lived;Js this is not surprising. This familiarity is demons­trated in a small way by the Persian vocabulary% and quotations of inferior Persian verse which occur in the text'n as well as by the citation of names of Persian kings such as Ardashir I (reg . .-\\D 226-41), from whose Testament (Wa�iyya) they quote.98 It is demonstrated much more obviously in some of their stories and anecdotes. Two kinds predominate in the Rasa 'il and they may be labelled respectively 'King Stories' and 'Animal Stories'. The former clearly owed much to the East: Persia, for example, had a literature which abounded in epics about kings. The number of ' King Stories' which appear in the Rasa 'if attests to the popularity which this kind of story had gained in the milieu of the Ikhwan by the time at which they wrote. These stories obvi­ously belong to a recognised and clearly defined genre for they have several stylistic features in common: they often begin with phrases like 'They related that one of the kings of India ... ' and go on to describe the might and sovereignty of a king who is considered to be a good or wise ruler to his subjects.'�'� Perhaps the most famous and important of the' King Stories' in the Rasa 'if are those taken from the legend of Bilawhar and Yudasaf (or Budhasaf), who were known in medieval Europe as Barlaam and Josaphat or Joasaph. S.M. Stern believed that the Rasa 'if were 'perhaps the earliest testimony for the existence of this Indian legend in an Arabic translation', HJO and several Arabic versions are known to have existed. The legend, whose origins lie"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"90 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS in the story of the Buddha, was translated from Pahlavi into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa' (died c. 756) and his school, and also incorporated in a Shi'ite work by Ibn Babuya (or Ibn Babawayhi, d. 991). It is the tale of a prince named Yudasaf who is brought up in total ignorance of human distress by being kept within the confines of a city. Tiring of this at last, he rides out and encoun­ters human infirmity and old age for the first time. He also meets a hermit from Ceylon called Bilawhar who persuades him to adopt the life of an ascetic. Yudasaf converts his father, undertakes a number of adventurous missionary journeys and eventually dies in Kashmir.101 The Ikhwan were clearly aware of the Indian origins of the legend since, in the speech of the Indian during the Debate of the Animals, Budasaf [sic] and Bilawhar are included, with the Buddha and the Brahmans, in a list of prophets and wise men of lndia.102 The former prince and the hermit were highly esteemed by the Brethren, who placed them in the fourth and highest rank of their hierarchy, in the company of such distinguished prophets and sages as Abraham,Joseph, Christ, Mul;lammad, Socrates and Pythagoras, and did not hesitate to quote from them concerning the importance of knowledge about the Kingdom of Heaven.103 Yet the Ikhwan often omitted to link the stories which they drew from the Bilawhar legend with the legend by name. This is certainly the case in the story of the poor but happy couple encountered by a king and his wazir, which also constitutes an interesting example in the epistles of 'framework technique', in which one story is told within another.104 The narrator is referred to only as 'the wise man (a/-�akim)' and, earlier, as 'one of the wise men of Ceylon'. 105 The story itself tells how a king goes for a walk one night with his wazir and they see a light in the distance. They meet a man and a woman living in a large dunghill who are entirely happy with their poverty-stricken state, drinking, dancing and singing together and endowing each other with grand titles. The king is amazed at their happiness and the wazir seizes the oppor­tunity to preach the merits of piety, asceticism and the joys of the Kingdom of God to his king. 106 Another tale taken from the Bilawhar legend and transmitted in the Rasa 'if is that of the prince who sleeps with a corpse. Again the framework technique is used. A king marries his son to another king's daughter and one night, during the celebrations, the son walks out of the city into the desert, rather drunk, and loses"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"USES OF LITERATURE 91 himself. Seeing a light in the distance he goes towards it and finds a group of people asleep. Thinking that he has returned to the bride's chamber and that the sleepers are her servants, he lies down beside the woman he thinks is his bride and embraces her. In the sober light of morning he wakes to find that all the people are, in fact, dead, and that he has slept with a corpse. He obtains some fresh clothes from a passer-by after washing in a river and is able to return to his former happiness. 107 The didactic nature of the parable is clear, and the wise man, and through him the Ikhwan, uses it to stress the idea that the soul, once separated from the body and risen to Heaven, certainly does not long to return to that body, any more than the prince longs to return to the corpse with which he has spent the night. There is thus an intriguing mixture of Platonic philosophy and Buddhistic legend here in the Rasa 'if which is further evidence of the continuity of the Ikhwan's syncretic approach throughout their writings. Furthermore, we may note in passing that it is only after self-purification in a river that the prince returns to his former state; this reiterates a major theme of the epistles. Elsewhere, the Ikhwan use another story from the Bilawhar corpus - the story of the gem - to make the point that their Brethren should choose wise young men to whom to impart their wisdom and knowledge. A son is born to a good but idol­worshipping king of India. The son grows up to be very learned and his thoughtful nature makes him yearn to consult a wise man about the things which perplex him. The wise Ceylonese, whom we mentioned above, hears about him and travels to see him. He asks a servant of the king's son to tell the son that he has brought him a gift of precious jewels. By this ruse he gains admission to the presence of the prince and the latter is able to question him about all the matters which trouble and vex him.108 The theme of the philosopher or prophet as the doctor of souls is a common one in the Rasa 'il. In one place the prophets are likened to a doctor who visits a town where all the inhabitants are ill without knowing it. By exercising great patience, the doctor succeeds in curing them one by one. Once again we find that this is another story in the Rasa 'if which has its origins in the Bilawhar legend, and once again it is one which the Ikhwan have adopted for their own didactic purposes. JOY Considerable emphasis has been placed upon the appearance of the legend of Bilawhar in the Rasa 'if because the extent to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"92 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS which the Ikhwan drew upon it, for didactic material with which to preach their theme of immortality won by the ascetic life, has not been sufficiently stressed nor appreciated. D. M. Lang, for example, refers only to 'the allusion in the Rasa 'if' to the fable of the Happy Poor Couple.110 However, such lack of emphasis may be due to the fact that the main stories in the Rasa 'il taken from the Bilawhar legend are often not directly associated with that legend by name. If we turn to the second category of stories in which the Ikhwan specialise, the 'Animal Story', we find that here too the influences are from India and the East. The fullest example of the 'Animal Story' in the Rasa 'il is the great Debate of the Animals which occupies a considerable portion of the Risa/a entitled On How the Animals and their Kinds are Fonned.111 At this Debate representa­tives of the animal and human worlds appear before a Shah to debate the question of whether man is superior to the animals. Man, it seems, has pressed into his service such animals as cattle, sheep, camels and horses, filled with a boundless conviction that he is superior to them and that they have been created to serve him. But he has severely maltreated them while making them serve. So the animals go to the Shah of the jinn and complain to him about man's injustice towards them. A debate is convened. Delegates from both mankind and the animal kingdom speak at length, often larding their addresses to the assembled multitude with a mass of Qur'anic quotation designed to underline the points which the speaker is making. Finally, following a speech by the Ikhwan's ideal man,112 judgement is given by the Shah in favour of man, at least for the time being.113 The question of whether man was, in fact, superior to the animals, had obviously aroused some debate in Ba:;ra. The Basran al-Jahi?:, for example, also considered the question in his Book of the Animals (Kitab al-/fayawan) and concluded, in one place at least, that man was superior to all the other denizens of the animal kingdom. The real difference for al-Jahi?: between man and the animals lay in man's capability or capacity (isti(a 'a), a concept which presupposed the existence of both reason and cognition.114 The profoundly anthropomorphic nature of this Debate of the Animals, where the animals are endowed with such faculties as speech and thought, owes much to antecedents such as Kali/a wa Dimna, the collection of Indian fables which was rendered into"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"USES OF LITERATURE 93 Arabic from Pahlavi by Ibn al-Muqaffa', but whose ultimate origins lie in the Sanskrit Panchatantra .115 The names of both Kalila and Dimna, in fact, reappear in the Rasa 'if during the Debate: we find that the beasts of prey are represented by the same jackal, 'Kalila, brother of Dimna', who is described by the tiger as being 'wise, just, knowledgeable and experienced' .116 Kalila's role here, of course, is very small by comparison with that which he plays in Ibn al-Muqaffa' 's work, but it is nonetheless significant since it signals a desire by the Ikhwfm that their own Debate should have some link with the great Kalifa wa Dimna. There are several other links as well between the Ikhwan's writings and this work oflbn al-Muqaffa'. These include the story of the ring-dove and that of the owls and the crows. The significance of the first in the history of the Rasa 'if has been examined in the first chapter and will not be pursued here.117 The story of the owls and the crows is interesting since it is cited by the Ikhwan as a simile of the man who defends himselfby trickery: the crows, who have been much harassed by an army of owls, send a fifth columnist into the owls' camp; as a result, the crows are eventually able to burn the owls' dwellings and destroy their enemies.118 One of the stories told within the framework of this main story in both Kalila wa Dimna and the Panchatantra is invoked in another part of the Rasa 'if to illustrate the saying that 'many a word has brought about discord and wars'. The Ikhwan allege that the enmity between the owls and the crows resulted from a word which the crow spoke when the birds met to make the owl king; for the crow successfully persuaded the birds against the owl's election by telling a number of fables.119 Two of the animal fables in the Rasa 'if are clearly labelled as Indian in origin by the Ikhwan. The first concerns a group of foxes who go out in search of something to eat. They find a dead camel which they decide to share. A passing wolf is persuaded to divide the camel between them. He does so but later considers his kindly act to be weakness and desires the food for himself. When the foxes come to him in the morning to receive more of the carcass, the wolf makes one more division of meat and warns the foxes not to return for any more since he will keep the rest for himself. The hungry foxes hope that once the wolf has eaten his fill he will relent and divide the rest among them. They go to plead with the wolf but he is obdurate. The foxes therefore take themselves to the lion, the king of the beasts of prey, and relate their story to"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"94 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS him. The lion seizes the wolf and tears him to pieces; the dead camel is then returned to the foxes. The Ikhwim conclude their tale with a thoroughly Aesopic moral to the effect that one ca­lamity is always capped by another .120 The second tale deals with the relationship between some crows and a falcon and is used as a parable for the nation which ignores the advice of its prophet when choosing a new ruler. The crows are blessed with a good king who dies. They disagree over his successor and hold a council to debate the issue where they decide that they do not wish to choose a member of the former king's family. Their misguided choice falls on an undernourished falcon whom they make king. The falcon grows to his former strength and begins to tyrannise and kill the crows. Before his death he appoints an even more vicious successor from his race, and the crows repent too late of their initial choice.121 These two tales, which resemble the type which is found in Kafila wa Dimna, follow a similar pattern: they are both taken from 'the fables of India', and they are both cited for didactic illustration by the Ikhwim. Indeed, there is little if any narrative in the Rasa 'if which is designed for the pure entertainment of the reader and no other purpose. Tht> sheer diversity of the milieu in which the Ikhwim must have lived is never more clearly demonstrated than in such scattered elements oflndian and Persian literature, culture, relig­ion, language and thought as appear in the Rasa 'if. Furthermore, the inclusion of references to writings attributed to Ibn al­Muqaffa', who spent much of his life in Ba�ra, and who was suspected of being a Manichee, has not been sufficiently emphas­ised in previous studies. It is true that there are many more Greek and Christian elements in the Rasa 'if than, for example, Indian, Zoroastrian or Manichaean; but when the latter are added to all the other non-Islamic elements in these epistles the final picture which emerges is of a group of philosophers constantly searching for fresh parallels with which to illustrate, prove, sustain and propagate their own doctrine, with the inevitable influences which such a cross-cultural search must produce. Indeed, the purity which the Ikhwan sought was often very similar to that for which both Plato and Mani strove."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX The Ikhwan al-Safo ' and the Isma'ilis In the first chapter attention was drawn to the difficulties involved in fixing an exact date of composition for the Rasa 'i/.1 Yet an exact dating is by no means necessary to show that the Ikhwan lived in an age of widespread sectarianism. Their Rasa 'if manifest a keen awareness of the divisive climate in which they lived: 'Know that people differ in their doctrines (arii') and religious creeds (madhahib) just as they differ in the forms of their bodics.'2 Not only do they twice give lists of different sects of the prevailing Middle Eastern religions,3 (for 'you also find people of one re­ligion having different religious creeds and doctrines'4), but they devote a whole chapter to the study of doctrines and religions.5 In this they recognise that differences in knowledge and intellectual ability can be prime factors in the acceptance or rejection of particular doctrines and creeds,6 and they go on to cite a variety of other causes of sectarianism. These include different levels of imagination,7 bad use of analogical reasoning (qiyas),8 and seek­ing to solve the problem of evil in the world9 as well as such contentious questions as those of the Imamate, 10 the attributes of God, 11 and free will.12 Textual problems and the exegesis of passages which could bear more than one meaning were a further fertile source of sectarian dispute.13 Yet the Ikhwan believed that considerable good could also come from religious differences, since they would provoke souls to seek knowledge and truth and wake from the sleep of ig­norance. In a restrained and unpartisan fashion they described the differences among the scholars in their doctrines and religi­ous creeds as 'a mercy (ikhtilaf a/- 'ulama' raJ,ma )', and the differ­ences of the religionists (ah/ al-diyanat) in religion and its norma­tive provisions as 'a wisdom (/!ikma)'.14 These descriptions are"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"96 .\\1\\USLIM NEOPLATO:'IiiSTS immediately evocative of the saw of medieval Islamic law that difference in the community was a sign of the divine bounty or mercy. Strangely enough, in their two lists of sects and their chapter on doctrines and religions, the Ikhwan do not mention the Isma'ilis though many other diverse sects such as the Qadariyya 15 and the Sabaeans of Barran16 do appear. Yet it was the Isma'ili sect, perhaps more than any other, which had the most profound effect on the structure and vocabulary of the lkhwan. It is in the lsma'ilis that the sectarianism of the age is best epitomised by virtue of the high degree of organisation, hierarchy and elaborate doctrine which that sect developedY The relationship between the lsma'ilis and the Ikhwan al-Safa' has been viewed up to now in a similar light by scholars. Nearly all have attempted to show that the Ikhwan were definitely Isma'ilis; the possibility that they may have been merely influenced by Isma'ili thought, without actually being Isma'ilis, has provoked less consideration. Fyzee observed, for example, that 'the tracts are clearly of Isma'ili origin; and all authorities, ancient and modern, are agreed that the Rasa 'if constitute the most authori­tative exposition of the early form of the Isma'ili religion' .18 Yves Marquet considers that 'it seems indisputable that the Epistles represent the state of Isma'ili doctrine at the time of their com­position'1'� and many other authorities have shared this view. Hossein Nasr observes that 'it is not surprising to find most modern scholars, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, claiming Is­ma'ili authorship for the work'.20 After a useful review of the work of such scholars, to which the reader is referred,21 Nasr himself concludes that 'we may loosely connect the Ikhwan with Isma'ilism, especially with what has been called \"lsma'ili gnosis\" '.22 Yet there have been a few reservations. S. M. Stern wrote: It is obvious that the authors of the Epistles, though they were connected with Isma'ilism, elaborated a peculiar doctrine which was not at all acceptable to the main body of the move­ment. Thus, while in the fifth/eleventh century the teaching of the Epistles exercised a considerable influence on philosophic and scientific circles unconnected with Isma'ilism, there is no trace of the influence of the Epistles among the Isma'ili authors of the period.21"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE IKHWAN AL-SAFA' AND THE ISMA'iL1S 97 Stern went on to argue that the Ikhwan were an idealised Isma'ili movement out of tune with contemporary mainstream Isma'ilism.24 Lewis, too, was more cautious than Fyzee, ranking the Rasa 'if among books which, though 'closely related to Is­ma'ilism', may not actually have been Isma'il1,25 despite their Batini (that is, Isma'ili) inspiration.26 Tibawi, while noting that 'there is sufficient evidence in the tracts themselves to prove Isma'ili sympathies', points out that there is still no proof that the institution of a group called Ikhwan al-Safa', and the resulting publication of their Rasa 'if, was an Isma'ili movement. 27 'A. 'Awa in his work, too, takes a non-Isma'ili view28 and some of his observations will be referred to later on. Most recently, Hossein Nasr appears to have revised his opinions somewhat for he writes: 'This group of authors, whose identity has never become com­pletely clear, was certainly of Shi'i inspiration although perhaps not as specifically Isma'ili as it came to be considered later.'29 The Italian scholar Alessandro Bausani emphasises this with his suc­cinct question and answer: 'Are the Ikhwan al-Safo' Isma'ilis? The point has not yet been decided with certainty ... .'30 In his article referred to above, Fyzee rightly points out that 'lsma'ilism was a sect of the Shi'ites which developed an extreme doctrine of the Imamate; it placed 'Ali far above the Prophet'.31 But there is a contradiction between his description of the Ikhwan as Isma'ilis and this later statement which will become apparent in the following pages. The argument which the question of the Imamate inspired in Islam was continuous and fierce. The heresiographer ai­Shahrastani (1 086-1153) was moved to observe that it was this question which had caused the greatest dissension in the whole Islamic community and that no doctrine had provoked such bloodshed in Islam in every age as the doctrine of the Imamate.32 The Isma'ilis made the Imamate a cardinal doctrine of faith. Obedience to the Imams was obedience to God and disobedience to them was disobedience to God. Thus the Isma'ili Qiufi al­Nu'man (d. 974) wrote: 'The Imams of right guidance, may they be blessed, are among the creatures and chosen servants of God most glorious. God has enjoined obedience to every Imam among them on the people of his age, and imposed on them submission to his authority. He has made the Imams leaders of His creatures to Him and guides of His servants to Him. '33 He cites a f!adith from Ja'far al-Sadiq concerning the Qur'anic verse, '0 believers, obey"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"98 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you.'34 The latter are interpreted by Ja'far as 'the Imams among us to whom obedience is enjoined'.35 This stress on obedience to the Imams is in marked contrast to the casuistry of the Sunni jurists who sought to reconcile the disobedience of many breakaway rulers from the Caliph with traditional theory. In common with the lthna 'Ashari branch of Shi'ism, the Isma'ilis rejected the Sunni doctrine of election. Since they believed that 'Ali had been directly nominated by Muhammad, election was wrong. The Imam could not be chosen by the people, who would never in any case have agreed on one man because of their differences, 36 but he was given his position by the designa­tion (naH) of his predecessor. Though human, he was considered sinless and infallible and his decisions were absolute and irrevoc­able. Legally the Imam was 'the final interpreter of the law on earth'37 and his word was ranked by the Q?u/i al-Nu'man beside the Qur'an andSunna as one of the three foundations of the law.38 Isma'ili Islam thus held the Imam in far greater esteem and awe than Sunni Islam, where he could be deposed, or forfeit the Imamate, if necessity or circumstance warranted it.3'� It would therefore be impossible to be an lsma'ili and at the same time deny the Imamate or be in any way hesitant or grudging in its support. Yet the Ikhwan al-Safa, so often described as Isma'ilis, were more than lukewarm in their devotion to this doctrine. As will be shown, they replaced the concept of Imamate with that of brotherhood. Their whole attitude to the doctrine of the Imamate is charac­terised by a considerable vagueness of approach. The clear treat­ment which Hamdani claims to find sometimes in the Rasa 'if is more assumed than real.40 It is by no means clear that the eschatological titles he cites, such as 'Supreme Master of the Law (Jahib a/-Namus al-Akbar)',41 refer to an Imam at all.42 Even Yves Marquet, in one place, was forced to describe the Rasa 'if as 'pudiquement voiles' on the question of the lmamate.43 Like al-Shahrastani, the Ikhwan recognised the troubles and bloodshed to which the doctrine had given rise in Islamic history: Know that the question of the Imamate is also one of the original subjects of dispute among the scholars. Those who have tackled it have become lost in all kinds of arguments and a lot of nonsense has been talked on the subject. Enmity and"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE IKHWAN AL-SAFA' AND THE ISMA'lUS 99 hatred have appeared among its exponents, and warfare and strife have broken out between its students. Expenditure and bloodshed have been justified because of it. The problem has persisted into our own age. Indeed, those who tackle it increase every day and dispute about it with one argument set against another. The subject has given rise to so many doc­trines and religious creeds that only God can count their number.44 The Ikhwan note that some believed that the Imamate should be held by designation (na.f.f) by those closest in lineage to the Prophet Muhammad, while others held the opposite.45 Contrary to Hamdani's assertion, however, and despite the technical terminology which he offers as evidence,46 the Imam is not 'the central point for the mission (da 'wat) of the Rasa'il'. His role is directly spoken of in only a few places.47 Furthermore, the whole usage by the Ikhwan of the words khatifa (caliph or viceroy) and Imam is both loose and eclectic in application: Adam is described Qur'anically as God's kha!ifo on earth48 while in the Debate of the Animals all human kings are called khulafo' (caliphs) of God on earth.49 He who seeks to become the khafij{l of God with bad intentions becomes the kha!ifo oflblis.50 Passion is also described as the khafija of lblis and the brother is urged to make reason ('aql) the kha!ifo over his soul, 51 and to be a guide and a mahdi, terms traditionally applied to the Imam.52 The Imams themselves are described as khulafo' of the prophets.53 Nowhere do the Ikhwan manifest a great enthusiasm specifically for the doctrine of the Imamate, let alone 'une convic­tion ardente, parfois fanatique'.54 On the contrary, they can do without an Imam: Know that if the minds of good, wise men received additionally the power (a/-quwwa) possessed by the wiu#' a/-shari 'a,55 they would not need a leader to lead them and command them, forbid them [from evil] and restrain and govern them, because the intellect (a/-'aql) and the power (al-qudra) of the wa4i' al-namus take the place of the leader, the Imam (al-ra 'is al­lmam). So come with us, 0 brother, that we may follow the norms (sunna) of the holy law (shari'a) and make it an Imam for us in what we have resolved upon.56"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"100 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS This brief but very important paragraph, the full implications of which most scholars seem to have ignored, not only clearly shows that the office of Imam may be dispensed with, but, by its separa­tion of the offices of wlu#' al-shari'a, wii4i' al-namus and Imam, does much to disprove the theory put forward by Marquet that the three terms are synonymousY Elsewhere the Ikhwim show that though recognition of the khalifo is useful as an aid to salvation it is not obligatory: as noted before, the brother may substitute reason ('aq/) and be guided by this, accepting its dictates and prohibitions but avoiding passion: 'Then make your reason the khalifo over your soul. '58 It is true that the extolling of visits to the mosques and tombs of saints and martyrs,59 the unequivocally 'Alid language used of the Battle ofSiffin,6(1 and the glorification of al-l:-lusayn and the Battle of Karbala',61 indicate distinctly Shi'ite sympathies on the part of the Ikhwan. Such sympathy is perhaps neatly summed up in the speech of the Khurasani from Merv at the Debate of the Animals: 'We ourselves wore black and sought vengeance for the blood of al-l:-lusayn; we expelled the tyrants of the Banii Marwan.'62 But the acute hostilitv which some scholars have seen in their attitude to the Caliph� of the Umayyad and 'Abbasid dynasties63 can be exaggerated. 'Ali is indeed respected as the leader of the Islamic community (Amir ai-Mu 'minin)64 but this respect is not mixed with fanaticism.65 The Caliphs who succeeded him do not provide a constantly reiterated focus for Shi'a-inspired hatred throughout the Rasa 'if, though these epistles do evince some distaste for their dynasties.66 In a long list of early followers of Muhammad, Abu Bakr, the successor of the Prophet, who is here described as the Prophet's friend, appears immediately after 'Ali.67 A few lines further on, 'Umar b. al-Khanab, the second Caliph, is spoken of in similarly reverent tones. If the Ikhwan had been fanatical Shi'ites, we would have expected them to exult over the murder of the third Caliph, 'Uthman b. 'Affan. But the reverse is the case. The Ikhwan observe that one of the qualities of the true believer is contentment with fate and the divine decree.68 After Socrates and Christ they mention 'Uthman as an example and admiringly cite his behaviour when confronted by his assassins (in AD 656).69 The Ikhwan even cite 'Umar's recommendation to read certain suras of the Qur'an 70 and he is here given the salutation, applied to friends of the Prophet, 'May God be pleased with him (ra4iya"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"THE IKHWAN AL-SAFA' AND THE ISMA'iLiS 101 Allah 'anhu).' All this is in marked contrast to the hatred of the extreme Shi'ites for the early successors of the Prophet.71 'A. 'Awa has identified four principal characteristics in the Shi'ite Imam: infallibility, return, Messianism and dissimulation of religion in time of danger (taqiyya)J2 But the infallibility ('i�ma) of the Imam, that fundamental of Isma'ilism, is hardly mentioned in the Rasa 'if, much less extolled. It is not among the qualities of the wadi' af-shari 'a, whom Marquet identifies with both prophet and Imam,73 nor one of his necessary beliefs,74 nor a requisite of the Imamate-Caliphate in its prophetic aspect/5 nor a characteristic of the royal temporal aspect of the Caliphate.76 With regard to the linked concepts of return and Messianism, the emphasis throughout the Rasa 'if is much more on the return of the individual soul to God than the return of the Imam, and the body is considered, Platonically, as a prison for the individual soul.77 The eschatological figure of the expectedMahdi (af-Mahdi af-Munta:r.ar) appears only rarely in the Rasa 'if and he seems, unexpectedly, to be linked in some way with the Paraclete.78 Yet surely any text in which the role for the Imam was really stressed might be expected to give considerable prominence to the sublime figure of the Mahdi, who had such an enormous significance in the Shi'ite tradition. Instead we find that the Messianism of the Rasa 'if is limited to the occasional unelaborated reference such as we have just mentioned, or to stereotyped spokesmen like the Khurasani at the Debate of the Animals who proclaims in stridently Shi'ite terms: 'We hope that there will appear from our country the Imam, the Mahdi, peace be upon him, who is the Expected One (af-Munta:r.ar) from the House of Mul;tammad ... '.79 Reference is certainly made in the Rasa 'if to concealment of religion though not necessarily under the name taqiy_ya,80 and there is a reiteration of such words as 'veiling (satr)' and 'revela­tion' or 'disclosure' (kashf) especially in theJami'a.81 Discussing their feasts the Ikhwan wrote: 'Then the fourth day is the day of sadness and sorrow, the dav of our return to our cave and the cave of taqiyya and concealme�t (al-istitiir).'82 But there is no persis­tently didactic emphasis on a doctrine of taqiyya in the Rasa 'if such as would justifY ascribing to the Ikhwan the attitude ex­pressed in the statement attributed toJa'far al-Sadiq: 'Taqiyya is my religion and the religion of my fathers in everything .... '83 On the contrary, the Ikhwan in one place positively reject the idea of a"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"102 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS hidden or concealed Imam: 'Among them [the Shi'a] are those who say that the expected Imam is hidden (mukhtt{m) for fear of those who would disagree with him.

'.84 Thus there seems to be little truth in the assertion that the Ikhwan's reiterated com­mand to turn from the sleep of negligence and the slumber of ignorance symbolises the clandestinity of the Imam.85 The Ikhwan al-Safa', while paying lip-service to the traditional doctrine of the Imamate by the occasional unenthusiastic refer­ence, replaced the whole concept with that of brotherhood (ukhuwwa). The key to this lies in the following statement of theirs: Know, 0 brother, that if these qualities [the forty-six propheti­cal qualities] arc united simultaneously in one human being, during one of the cycles of astral conjunctions, then that person is the Delegate (ai-Mab'uth) and the Master of the Age (JiJJJib ai-Zam1m) and the Imam for the people as long as he lives. If he fulfils his mission (risa/a) and accomplishes his allotted task, advises the community (al-umma) and records the revelation, codifies its [correct] interpretation (ta 'wil) and consolidates the holy law (a I-shari 'a), clarifies its method (minhaj) and imple­ments the traditional procedures (al-sunna) and welds the community into one; [if he does all that and] then dies and passes away, those qualities will remain in his community as its heritage. If those qualities, or most of them, are united in one man in his community, then he is the man suited to be his successor (khatifotahu) in his community after his death. But if it does not happen that those qualities are united in one man, but are scattered among all its members, and they speak with one voice and their hearts are united in love for each other, and they co-operate in supporting the faith, preserving the law and implementing the sunna, and bearing the community along the path of religion, then their dynasty will endure in this world and the outcome will be happy for them in the next. But if that community is disunited after the death of its prophet and disagrees on the path of religion, the unity of their friendship will be dissolved and things will go badly for them in the hereafter and their dynasty will vanish. So if you are deter­mined to seek the betterment of [both your] religion and the world, then come with us! We meet with a group of distin-"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE IKHWAN AL-SAF.i\\.' AND THE ISM.i\\.'iLiS 103 guished brothers and follow the sunna of the law in sincere behaviour, genuine advice and pure brotherhood (�afoat al­ukhuwwa).86 This important statement clearly shows that the Ikhwan believed that a community could in fact dispense with the Imam and still achieve salvation.87 At first, the Imam is placed on a pedestal as the sum total of all the virtues. But by the end there is an acknowledgement that, provided these virtues are present in a unified community (umma ), the Imam is to all intents and pur­poses superfluous. The purpose of the Ikhwan becomes clear in the last exhortation: the unified community of the Ikhwan is a repository of all the above-mentioned virtues and as such replaces any need for an Imam. The equation of umma and Ikhwan becomes complete. The Ikhwan go on to observe that there is no group better able to help in matters of religion or worldly affairs with mutual good advice than the Ikhwan. Each of its members believed that he could only properly exalt the faith by helping his brother, and seeking for him what he sought for himself.88 The school or way of life of the lkhwan meant showing mercy and kindness to all;8'� thus the brother with money but no knowledge should help the penniless scholar who in turn should be equally generous with his knowledge.'IO Their friendship did not change, for the Ikhwan considered themselves to be one soul in several bodies.'�1 Thus, where the jurist al-Mawardi (d. 1058) laid a heavy burden of ten basic responsibilities on his Sunni Imam,'�2 the Ikhwan reduced this to the single, lighter burden of friendship (�adaqa) imposed on every member of a brotherhood which replaced in action as well as name the traditional doctrine of the Imamate. Though the need for a leader (ra 'is) in the community is at times also acknowledged, this does not invalidate any of what has been said. For the Ikhwan claimed to be content with their own leader which was the human reason (al-'aql) 'which God most glorious has made leader over the best of His creation', and they observed that they would rigorously avoid the company of anyone who was not content with 'the dictates of reason (shara 'it a/-'aq/)'.93 As we have seen, it was reason which should have a Caliphal supremacy over man's soul. In view of the essential nature of the Imamate to the Isma'ilis, and the inferior role allocated to the Imamate by the Ikhwan, it"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"104 MUSLIM ;\\/EOPLATONISTS may be concluded that the Ikhwan were not l<>ma'ilis. The Rasii 'il should not therefore be described, in the words of one scholar, as the oldest account of Isma'ili doctrine.'14 The Isma'ili elements found in the Rasa 'if are reducible to the level of influences and should not be regarded as indigenous factors in the doctrine of the Ikhwan."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"CONCLUSION The Ship of Salvation The Ikhwan indeed practised a philosophy of tolerance and eclecticism in their Rasa 'il, but the previous chapters show that such a description should be used with care and applied with several caveats: it was primarily in the field of textual borrowing and reference that the Ikhwan most manifested their penchant for eclecticism. They did not disdain to borrow from the whole spectrum of world scripture, pagan philosophy and Abrahamic theology. The range at their disposal was vast for diversity of thought was the keynote of the Middle Eastern milieu in which they wrote. It was a milieu which had produced works as disparate as those filled with the satirical invective of ai-Jahi?:, on the one hand, and those imbued with the Neoplatonism of the author of the Theolo gia and others infected by the spirit of Plotinus, Qn the other; a milieu in which the Bible had already been translated into a number of vernacular languages and also supplemented by a variety of apocryphal testaments; and a milieu in which Isma'ilism was expanding rapidly to receive its political apotheosis with the Fatimid seizure of Egypt in AD 969. However, the use of texts of other religions and philosophies by the Ikhwan does not mean that they uncritically accepted the dogma of every religion whose texts they used. Though, as we have seen, they were often profoundly influenced by such works, they did not hesitate to criticise where they found it necessary. Thus they castigated the jews at times but elsewhere accepted the Torah as having an equal value with the Qur'an and the Gospel as a primary source. They virulently inveighed against the faults of other religions, and indeed, against those of Islam itself, 1 through the mouth of the Strong Man (JiiJ!ib a/-'Azima) at the great Debate of the Animals, using him as an orthodox disguise for their own multifarious unorthodoxies."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"106 MUSLIM NEOPLATONISTS It was inevitable that the ambivalence of their eclecticism, epitomised in acceptance of the text but not necessarily of all that the text's religion or philosophy taught, should have led to some confusion about their own beliefs. Furthermore, it was imposs­ible, then as now, for any group to maintain an attitude of total tolerance to a variety of mutually hostile and often intolerant religions and creeds without some contradiction creeping in. This is seen most vividly in the Ikhwan's view of God, where they attempted to identifY the Neoplatonic One with the Islamic Allah. Elsewhere, their account of the life of Jesus, and especially the crucifixion, contains, in one place at least, a statement of facts quite at variance with the Qur'anic account. The necessity of continuing to teach while at the same time avoiding confrontation added a further dimension in which it may sometimes have been necessary to make deliberately contradictory statements as a form of taqiyya.2 With all this in mind, the Ikhwan appear, perhaps, reluctant ;\\1uslims. Yet they have been described as truly Islamic because of a belief that what was historically eclectic in the Rasa 'if was gathered together with one Islamic end in mind, and that their aim was 'to build a unified citadel'.3 According to this view the multi­plicity of the Ikhwan's source material was thus funnelled to a unicity or single purpose which was the Islamic God and the Islamic exaltation of His oneness.4 This might have been an attractive way of viewing the Ikhwan were it not for the fact that, as has been shown, the Ikhwan's concept of God differed radically from that of orthodox Islam; and, indeed, many of their beliefs were entirely outside the pale of Islam. A better way of considering the Ikhwan's thought might be to see it as a series of lines radiating outwards and touching the circumference of world beliefs rather than as a variety of schools of thought and religious beliefs beamed inwards on the focus of Islam. It is true that the Ikhwan too had a single focus for which they derived inspiration and support from the many beliefs with which they came into contact, but that focus was the universal concept of purity, and not Islam. A keyword in the methodology of the Ikhwan was adaptation. They frequently adapted what they found in other religions, and philosophies such as Pythagoreanism, to their own ends. One scholar has asked in what way the Rasa 'if can be considered 'a successful integration of Islam and Greek philosophy' .5 Because of the contradictions the Rasa 'if cannot be described as success-"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"THE SHIP OF S\\L\\':\\TIO:\\ 107 fully integrating either of these central features of the medieval Middle East though, of all the influences and alien strands which compose the woof of the Rasa 'if, the Greek may be said to predominate. The tolerance of the Ikhwii.n should not be exaggerated or overemphasised. They could be arrogant towards, and sometimes intolerant of, those not possessed of their own truly astonishing intellectual and encyclopedic range, vitality and capacities. Thus their attitude towards the common people (a!-'amma) requires some clarification. Were the Ikhwan really a group which claimed to have a popular appeal, and which sought pcpular support, or were they elitists? They put themselves forward as the former in that they claimed to have infiltrated every sector of society, includ­ing the artisan class.6 Yet this seems to be contradicted by the elitist attitudes which they adopted in connection with such sub­jects as magic, and their idea that the common people were fit only for the obvious or exoteric (::;ahir) aspects of religion, such as knowledge of prayer and fasting. 7 The words 'common people' as used by the Ikhwii.n may sometimes have been a disparaging reference to those who did not attend their meetings (majiilis) and were not members of, nor associated with, the Brethren. But it seems more likely that the contrast was between seekers of know­ledge and the ignorant. The Ikhwii.n appealed popularly to those members of the populace who were willing to learn, and so used the term 'common people' (a!-'iimma) derogatorily as a synonym for 'the ignorant' (al-juhha!), giving the former word an intellec­tual rather than a purely class connotation. (Indeed, these same ignorant people are specified in some of their definitions of 'common people'.)8 What then were the Ikhwii.n? It is easy to state what they were not. They were not Ismii.'ilis; this is far too narrow a definition, besides being inaccurate. They were, howner, influenced by Ismii.'ili thought. They have been described by some, like 'A. 'Awii., as encyclopedists, and, indeed, it is true that they had the encyclopedist's veneration for knowledge as well as his capacity to present a variegated and comprehensive survey of the learning of the age. But they were more than just scholars with a love of learning.

The pillars of this doctrine were tolerance, mutual help (ta 'iiwun) and a philosophy of eclecticism which utilised any text which might bolster their own teaching.

In fact, the soul-as Plato asserts in the Meno -already possesses all knowledge in itself potentially. It only needs to recollect this knowledge, and the impression from the senses can do no more than to help in this recollection.' Nasr does not seem to have noted R. 3, p. 424, where it is made quite clear that there are three methods of acquiring knowledge of which a key one is sense perception. The use of the word 'recollection' implying the Platonic doctrine is unwarranted and misleading in this context. A. L. Tibawi ('Some Educational Terms in Rasii 'illkhwan �Safo', Islamic Quarterly, vol. 5, nos. 1-2 (1959), p. 60) is another scholar who maintains that 'on the nature of the process otleamingtheRasii 'i/ claim to be based on Plato's doctrine that \"learning is reminiscence\"'."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"66 Sec Phaedo, 72E ff. 67 R. 3, p. 424.

Jamal can also mean 'ship's cable' fhabl al-safina) and this meaning is specified by the editor of the 1957 edn of the Rasa 'il in a footnote (R. 1, p. 226). E. W. Lane translates the Qur'anic phrase as: 'until the cable shall enter into the eye of the needle\" (An Arabic-English Lexicon (Beirut, Librairie du Liban, reprinted 1968), vol. 2, p. 461); W. Montgomery Watt notes that this possibility has been mentioned by both Muslim and Christian commentators and that 'needle' may also signifY 'a small side-gate' (Companion to the Qur'iin, p. 89). See also the same author's article 'The Camel and the Needle's Eye' in Ex Orbe Religionum: Studia Gro Widmgren Oblata, ed. by C. J. Bleekeret al., Studies in the History of Religions XX!l, (Leiden, E. J. Brill, 1972), vol. 2, pp. 155-8. Whatever the ambiguity in the Arabic, however, modem New Testament scholarship is agreed that the phrase should be understood literally as a hyperbole; for example 'Procrustean attempts to reduce the camel to a rope (reading kilmilon for kilmelon) or to enlarge the needle's eye into a postern gate need not be taken seriously' (C. E. B. Cranfield, The Gospel According to Saint Mark: an Introduction and Commentary (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1959), p. 332). 103 R.3,pp.6, 77,82,516;R.4,p.235;J. 1,pp.90-1,134, 183,516,693,695;J.2,pp. 15, 209; see Isaiah 64:4, 1 Corinthians 2:9; compare Q.

Its use as a tool of execution is recorded elsewhere as well: for example the great medieval traveller Ibn Ban:uJa (1304-1368/9 or 1377) notes that Sultan Muhammad ibn Tughluq of Delhi ordered that a cripple, left behind in Delhi after the Sultan had ordered the city's evacuation, should be flung to his death from one (RiMa (Beirut, Dar Sadir, 1964), p. 479). 167 al-Tabari, Ta 'wil, pt 17, p. 45; Ibn al-Athir,al-Kamilji 'I-Ta 'ri/eh (Beirut, Dar Sadir, 1965), vol. l, p. 99. 168 Pesal,im ll8a: Hebrew-English Edition of the Babylonian Talmud, trans. by H.
