Whoever is ignorant of the knowledge of wujud, his ignorance runs though the most important of all subjects and the greatest among them, and he will become mindless of it and the secrets of Divine knowledge and its inner meanings will become lost to him as well as the science of Divine Names and Qualities and prophecy and the science of the soul and its connections [with the whole of cosmology] and its return to the Origin of its origins and its final end [eschatology]. Therefore, we saw to it that we begin with it [the question of wujud]. For ~adra, existence is not a \"concept\" in the sense of an abstract term, though it has a mode of existence that we call \"mental existence.\" It is not a \"thing\" among other things, though it is \"all things\" at a certain level of existentiation. It is not a '-'U.'\"\"'L'-'H\"\"' acc::IOent, or quality-though it is also all of them because, in the final analysis, there is nothing in wujud. It has no vVL~.UL'u.L site, because neither miihiyyah ( essence/quiddity) nor cadam ~Hv'H'--\"'\"·\"' can claim to have the same degree of as existence. ~adra defined wujiid as a that defies abstraction and conceptualization. To underscore this he introduced a distinction between the concept and of exis-tence. The \"concept of existence\" (majhum al-wujud) is a mental repre-sentation of existence and reveals something of its structure. As the human mind works with concepts and general, abstract terms, it turns like everything else, into a concept. It then this concept to a multitude of objects and classes. The of existence\" (baqiqat al-wujud), however, remains mental constructions and generalizations. Existence is dynamic, continuous, self-renewing, self-effusing. It is also all-embracing in that nothing can be outside it. As ~adra insisted, wujud is not a thing among things, but the which all things come to exist.

There is only one single reality in existence, but it travels through the entire \"circle of existence\" (di{'irat al-wujiid), a different mark at every level. Existence remains the single immutable at the root of all things. But it also displays an infinite number of shades, modes, and modalities. This is what Ibn al-cArabi called rality\" (al-wa~dah fi al-kathrah). This led ~adra to formulate one of the pnmc:1p.Les of his epistemology: \"It is in the nature of the intellect to unite what is and it is in the nature of the senses to ... u.,_.__._L.._P.._ what is one.\"4 Without denying the use and necessity of mental analysis, \"-.--.-.r>,,\"'\"'rl another way of attaining the of existence. In vivid language, he called it \"illuminative (~urjiir ishriiqi) and \"direct witnessing\" (shuhiid cayni). In paragraph 57 of the Mashiicir, ~adra stated this point as follows: The reality of wujiid is not in any way actualized in its essence in any of the minds, because wujftd is not a universal concept and the wujiid of every existent is this existent itself in concreto, and that which is in concreto . cannot be a mental concept. What is represented of wujiid as a general mental concept is the wujiid which one calls related [intisiibi] wujiid, which is proper to logical judgments. As for knowledge of the reality of wujiid, that cannot be other than illuminative presence and real wit-nessing. Consequently, no doubt remains concerning its identity. 1.

What gives their is their essence rather than their existence because, Suhrawardi thought, to know that both man and horse exist adds nothing to our knowledge of them. Existence is thus nothing but a common term between man and horse. What distinguishes them from one another is their (miihiyyah), which defines the horse as an animal and man as a rational being. Even though Suhrawardi substitutes light (al-niir) for existence and a metaphysics of light, which the of exis-tence versus quiddity remained a fundamental of difference between the two philosophers.5 This concept of existence is also the main focus of the Kitiib al-mashiicir. ~adra presented in this widely circulated book a dense sum-mary of his ontology with some subthemes in theology, and the temporal origination of the world. Existence is the that underlies all other concepts of and discussed knowledge, he defined it as a \"mode of existence\" (nabw al-wujiid).

In this sense, the Mashiicir's almost exclusive focus on existence and its modalities is in perfect agreement with ~adra's overall concern to all in his 5.

While Shi c ism gradually became the dominant religious identity of most Persians in the six-teenth and seventeenth centuries, different intellectual currents contin-ued to live within Safavid Shi cism.l Among others, four major schools of the Islamic intellectual tradition influenced scores of thinkers in including our own Mulla ~adra.

In his refutation of modern materialism, he refers his readers to his own philosophical work Diriiyat al-cifmah and to Mulla $adra's well-known Sharb hidiiyat al-bikmah, a commentary on the famous book of formal logic by Athir al-Din Abhari.16 This commentary is probably the most widely read work of $adra in the subcontinent of India, though his other works have also been studied, as evidenced the large number of the manuscripts of $adra's works in various libraries in India. 15.

And if there were not to be for wujiid a reality other than simply the actualization of the quiddity, then there would never be any difference between in concreto and in the mind [or external and mental]. This is impossible since quiddity might be actualized in the mind without having to be actualized in concreto. Fi al-cayn denotes a mode of existence effects-namely, existential As commentator points out, \"the 'external' is not like a place; rather, what is meant by it is something that is non-conceptual.\"32 In the A.ifiir, it as follows: What we mean by actual [i.e., external] existence (al-wujiid al-cayni) is that the concomitants (lawazim) of an [actual] essence follow from it. When blackness is found in the external world, its proper nature is to cause absence of sight. The proper effect of hotness is to cause hotness. But when they occur in the soul, these concomitants do not follow from them. We call the former actual [external] existence and the lat-ter mental existence.33 Other terms that certain difficulties in translation have been explained in the text. The examples above attest to the subtleties and challenges of translating $adra's philosophical vocabulary into English. The nuances and shades of meaning that accompany classical philosophical Arabic are important for a proper understanding of $adra's thought, as well as that of other traditional thinkers. As $adra never tired of reminding us, however, the goal of philosophical analysis is not to imprison the mind in words and concepts, but to bring it to the limits of human language and enable it to transcend the conceptual 32.

The word ciifiin, translated here as \"gnosis,\" is derived from the verb ca-r-J, meaning \"to know,\" \"to understand,\" and \"to cognize.\" clifiin refers to a state of deeper understanding and cognition, an epistemic and spiritual ability achieved through such methods as contemplation, reflection, inner purification, and moral refinement. In the later Islamic tradition, the word came to signify a specific method of attaining knowledge, and the expression cilm al-macrifah began to be used for metaphysical and theoretical ta0awwLif. We have chosen to render it in English as \"gnosis\" to revive this old meaning of the word. While gnosis in English conjures up the Gnostic tradition in early Christianity-a school considered heretical by some-our usage of the word obviously has nothing to do with that particular school of thought in the Christian tradition. But just as the Gnostic Christians' quest was realized knowledge and inner purification, the followers of ciifiin also expressed a desire to go beyond merely demonstrative arguments in logic and philosophy. Kashani, for instance, defined al-iiarif, the one who knows through ciifiin and macrijah, as someone who \"witnesses God Himself, His quali-ties, names and acts.\" Accordingly, \"macrijah is the state that comes about from witnessing Him.\" Kashani, I0tilii~iit al-0iijiyyah, 124. For the uses of ciifiin and macrifah in Ibn Sina, see A. M. Goichon, Lexique de la langue philosophique d'Ibn Sinii (Avicenne), 221. In a similar way, al-Ghazali used ciifiin and macrijah as knowledge based on experience and witnessing (mushiihadah); see Jabre, Essai sur le lexique de Ghazali, 174-78. 2. Maniisik, plural of mansik, refers to specific acts and rituals conducted dur-ing the pilgrimage (manasik al-hajj). 3. Cf. the following statement ~adra made in regards to Suhrawardi's claim that wL!}ild is only a mental concept: \"If someone is ignorant about the question of existence, he is of necessity ignorant about all of the principles and founda-tions of knowledge, for it is through existence that everything is known, and it is the beginning of all description (ta0awwur) and more known than anything that provides description. When someone ignores it, he ignores everything besides it. As we have mentioned before, the true knowledge of existence comes about only through unveiling (kaslif) and witnessing (mushiihadah). It has thus been said that 'he who has no unveiling has no knowledge.'

The expression \"He who has no unveiling has no knowledge\" comes from Ibn aVArabi, Futii~Iiit, 1.218.19, translated in Chittick, The Szifi Path if Knowledge, 170. 4. This is based on one of the key principles of epistemology: \"True demonstration (al-burhiin al-~aqiqi) does not contradict witnessing based on unveiling (al-shuhiid al-kaslifi).\" See ~adra, Aifiir, 1.2 (315). 5. commentator Mulla Mu}:lammad Lahiji added: itself is pres-ence, manifestation, essential. It is not caused by anything else; rather it is through [wzfjztd] that everything else is manifest and present. It is the principle in manifestation and presence.\" Lahiji, Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 12. Lahiji's com-mentary makes it clear that \"presence\" and \"manifestation\" refer to the way in which wujztd is particularized in the world of creation. 6. For a more detailed discussion of the impossibility of giving a formal-logical definition of wujztd, see ~adra, Aifiir, 1.1 (25). 7. ~adra insisted that no matter how perfect our conceptualizations are, the reality of wujiid as it is remains outside the ken of the human mind because the mind operates through concepts and universals. For ~adra, concepts, while indispensable for organizing human thought, have the possibility to distort real-ity. That is why the true philosopher must constantly check his concepts and argu-ments against the reality of things. Cf. the following paragraph in Aifiir, 1.1 (37-38): concrete being represented in the mind with its ought to maintain its quiddity, despite the change in its modality of existence. The reality of existence is such that it is in the extramental world (Ji al-ayiin). Everything whose reality is such that it is in the extramental world cannot be found in the mind [as it is]; otherwise, this would lead to the alteration (inqiliib) of something from its own reality [into something else J. Therefore, the reality of existence can-not be found in any mind. What is represented of existence in the soul, whereby it takes on universality and generality, is not the reality of existence, but one of the aspects of its constitution and one of its names.\" 8. As ~adra explained later in paragraph 22, \"external\" (Ji al-cayn), which we also rendered as in concreto, means a particular state of existence, not a place \"out there.\" ~adra has said: \"The meaning of something existing in the external world is that it has an existence from which particular effects result and specific states (a#iim) emanate. Its being in the mind is not like this.\" A-?iilat jacl al-wujiid, 191. 9. lvfa-?dari can also be translated as \"unconditional\" because it refers to a state of existence \"conditioned by nothing\" (bi-shart lii). See n. 40 below. 10. Cf. the following: \"Beings (wzfjiidiit) are actual identities particularized by themselves. They are not qualified by genus, species, universality, and particular-ity in the sense that they belong to a species or genus or in the sense that they become particular through something added to them from outside. Rather, they are differentiated by themselves, not through differentia (fa-?l) or accident (carat}). In this sense, they have no genus, differentia, or definition.\" ~adra, 1.1 (53)."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Notes 79 11. confirmed that God cannot have a (mahiyyah) because a quid-is, definition, shared a multitude of In the case of God, He can be the member of a class to which He belongs; otherwise, divine unity is jeopardized. It is important to note that while introduced and quiddities\" to account for differentiation and particularization among things, he posited wujud as the only principle of both identity and difference. 12. The word shumul does not have an exact equivalent in English. It refers to something that applies to many things, comprises many members, and includes or encapsulates multiplicities. But as wujud's or comprising of all things is different from generic concepts being applied to more than one member: \"Existence's encapsulation of things is not like the universal's encapsulation of particulars, but through expansion (inbisii!) and flow (sarayan) in the temples of essences in such a way that no full description of it can be given.\" nt-JvJu.:-::.ur,ctf al-ilahiyyah, 26-27. 13. ~adra equated the natural universal with quiddity (mahiyyah) 3.1, 472. 14. It is clear from the paragraph that shumfil al-wujud is a creative act by which God creates and fashions things in the way they are. Lahiji explained this with the notion of \"relative truth\" (al-~aqq al-icjifz): \"the reality by which things are cre-ated ... that is to say, the relative truth which is created by the true [absolute] truth (al-~aqq al-~aqiqi) without an instrument or by the truth through which things are created.\" Shar~ risalat al-mashacir, 23. 15. Cf. the following: \"Existence in everything is the principal reality in exis-tentiation, and it is the principle of its particularity, the source of its quiddity, and the measure of its essence. Existence belongs to the category of things that allow intensification and diminution in terms of perfection and imperfection, and it has essential qualities and modes in every degree of intensification and diminution as different from what it had before.\" ~adra, Itti~ad al-caqil, 22. 16. The language of \"effects (athar) and conditions (a#am)\" confirms the crea-tive act of wujud through which things come to be what they are. It is not the case that wujud exerts an effect on things that are already fully established. Rather, it is wujud that makes and shapes them by throwing its \"effects and conditions\" on them. Lahiji quoted the following statement from cAbd al-Razzaq Qashani: \"Wujud is the wujud of something, not something that exists.\" Shar~ risalat al-mashacir, 32. 17. A further discussion of these concepts appears in paragraph 42. 18. Essential primary predication refers to predication where the predicate is an essential part of the definition of the subject. In this kind of predication, sub-ject and predicate are one and the same, both in concept and in reality. Existential propositions such as \"man is man\" are of this kind. Although existential proposi-tions are tautological and yield no new knowledge about the predicate, they play an important role in logic. said that, essential primary predications are also applied to such propositions as \"man is a rational animal,\" whereby \"rational animal\" is essential for the definition of \"man.\" The second kind of predication, called \"common predication\" (~aml shaici ~inaci) or simply \"secondary predication\""},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"80 Notes (~aml thiini), refers to predication where the predicate is not an essential property of the The \"man is a writer\" is of this kind in that being a shared by some human beings but not an essential part of the definition of man. Cf.A.ifiir, 1.3 (324-25, 351). 19. As ~adra explained in the next paragraph, all things exist through a com-position of wujiid and miihiyyah, the only exception being wujiid itself. ~adra's concern was to show that wujiid exists by itself and does not need any other agent~ such as a quiddity, substance, or cause-to make it exist, either in a generic or a specific way. This is the primacy of wujiid over quiddity (a~iilat al-wujiid), a principal teaching that ~adra developed and defended in his works. This is also a criticism of Suhrawardi, who argued that wujiid does need the quiddity in order to exist. For ~adra's criticism, seeA.ifiir, 1.1 (41, 66). 20. ~adra asserted the self-determination of wujiid as follows: \"It becomes determined by itself, without the addition of anything else, with all of the existen-tial determinations and external realizations. It is better to say that external realities are generated from the degrees of its essence and modes of its de termina-tions and states. It is the principle of the cosmos, the sphere of life, the Throne of the Merciful, the 'real through whom creation takes place' in the tradition of the Sufis, and the Truth of all truths. In its very unity, it becomes many with the mul-tiplicity of existents united with quiddities. Thus, it becomes eternal with eternal, temporally originated with temporally originated, intelligible with intelligible, and sensible with sensible. In this regard, people think that it is a universal, but it is not. Expressions used to explain its expansion on the quiddities and its compre-hensiveness of existents are deficient signs, [and it cannot be expressed] except through symbol and similitude.\" A.ifiir, 1.2 (328). 21. Dawud al-Qay~ari, a prominent figure of the school of Ibn al-\"Arabi and one of the sources of~adra's metaphysics, added the following: \"Existence, insofar as it is being, is predicated of all relational beings (al-wujiidiit al-muqiifah) because we say that: [this particular] being exists. And whatever is predicated of things has to have a relationship of unity and difference towards them. In the case of existence [as predicated of things], that which unites [that is, the principle of unity] is nothing but existence, and that which differentiates [that is, the prin-ciple of difference] is again existence itself.\" Muqaddamiit, 36. 22. In ~adra's vocabulary, this is known as the \"principle of derivation\" (al-qa\"idah alforciyyah). It states that if one affirms a quality or a property of some-thing, this presupposes the affirmation of the actual reality of that thing in the first place. In order to predicate whiteness of the \"white wall,\" the wall must exist before the predicate white. ~adra's main point is that wujiid, in its all-embracing reality, precedes all predicates, qualities, and properties. Every predicative state-ment regarding existing bodies presupposes the preexisting reality of wujiid. 23. As Lahiji put it: \"The realization of wujiid happens [through the modality of being] in the external world, and the quiddity is united with it in the external world in the sense that the quiddity corroborates it and occurs to it [as a quality].\" Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 54. 24. ~adra wanted to make sure that the relationship between wujiid and quid-dity is not understood to be a relationship between two independent and self-"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Notes 81 subsisting entities. Rather, wujiid is the source, principle, and cause of all attribu-tions. That is he brought up the of the are dependent upon the Necessary in an absolute sense. For contingent beings vis-a-vis the Being are \"pure relations\" (rawabi! ma~rjah) and thus possess no substantiality on their own. 1.3 (37). 25. As indicated in the previous paragraphs and made clear by the quote from Bahmanyar, Ibn Sina's famous student, the concrete reality of existence is two-fold: First, it exists in a generic or absolute way, without qualification by anything. qua wujiid exists in such a way as to let other exist as beings. In this sense, wujiid also exists as a particular being, such as the sky, and so forth. This second aspect of wujiid does not contradict its first aspect, because when we say, \"Zayd exists,\" we refer both to the fact that such a person as exists and to the fact that exists as a concrete being. Furthermore, being qua tree or being qua table exists through predication in that the qualities of being tree or table are predicated of being to make it a specific object. But the First Being, or what Plotinus has called Non-Being, remains above any predica-tion and qualification. It is this non-predicative Being that is the source and prin-ciple of all beings. For this aspect of Non-Being in Plotinus, see Mystical Monotheism, 136-37. This specific question of ontology is part of a larger issue in metaphysics. The Muslim philosophers had to develop a metaphysics of imper-sonal divine principle on the one hand and a theology of personal God on the other. Theologically, God is absolute and beyond all qualification. But He is also creating, speaking, hearing, forgiving, and so on. 26. The wordjacl, translated here as \"instauration,\" and its derivativesjiicil and ma/iil occupy a special place in ~adra's philosophical vocabulary. stated, it signifies putting something into a specific state or condition in conformity with its essential properties. ~adra divides it into two kinds: simple and composite. Simple instauration refers to the construction of something by itself-when we say, for instance, \"man is man.\" In logic, this corresponds to essential primary predica-tion (al-~aml al-dhati al-awwali). As for composite instauration, it refers to cases where the definition of a quiddity involves the convergence of both essential and accidental properties, such as when we say, \"Man is a rational animal\" and \"Man is a writer.\" For ~adra, what is instaured by itself (al-ma/ztl bi)l-dhat) is not essence, but wz!Jiid, because wujiid does not need an external agent to make it a specific substance, whereas all essences need some cause external to them in order to exist in the external world. In this sense, essences are instaured, or produced \"by accident\" (al-ma/iil bi)l-cararj). Cf. Aifar, 1.1 (65-66); A~alat jacl al-wujiid, 184-85; Shar~ risiilat al-mashacir, 2:805. See also ~adra's extensive analysis in Aifar, 1.1 (396-423), concerning concept (ta0awwur) and judgment (ta,fdiq) as cases of simple and composite instauration. 27. The word curiirj, derived from the root ca-r-rj, does not have an equivalent in English. Its verbal form denotes something \"becoming an accident to\" or \"occur-ring to\" something. Lahiji defined it as \"something being existent for something else.\" Shar~ risalat al-mashiicir, 65. Since \"accidenting\" does not make much sense, we have rendered it in several ways. In the translation, however, the link between something being an accident and something becoming an accident is lost."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"82 Notes 00''rr,..-.rr to Gutas, Ibn Sina uses mu~a~~il \"to describe the most accom-PhllOSOlJ11~~rs in the Aristotelian tradition, and in Alexander of \" Avicenna and the Aristotelian Tradition, 189. Ibn Sina in this particular issue. 29. This premise is related to the famous debate as to whether existence is an accident or not. $adra rejected the idea of existence being an accident because acci-dents are, by definition, dependent upon those of which they are accidents. Con-cerning Ibn Sina's statement that \"existence is an accident in things with quiddities to which existence is attached, as we see in the case of ten (JV!uba~athiit, 154), argued that what Ibn Sina meant here is a special kind of accident in the sense that contingent beings derive or borrow their existence from the Necessary Being. In other words, it is only in relation to the source of being that existence can be considered an accident. Aifiir, 1.1 (48; see also 258). 30. In contrast to the Peripatetics, $adra took existence, rather than the Aristotelian fixed substances, as the primary agent of qualitative and quantitative change in his natural philosophy. For $adra, when an object becomes black, it does not simply assume blackness as an accident. While this is true as far as the black object is concerned, what really happens is that the wujiid of that object increases in blackness. This general principle applies to substances as well: when substances realize their potentials, they increase in existence, rather than simply taking on new properties as accidents. Peripatetics and Suhrawardi had a difficult time explaining quantitative change because their ontology had practically no room for gradation in existence. $adra noted this: \"The problem of motion [in the sense of change J in the category of quantity ... caused later thinkers many prob-lems-so much so that the author of [ijikmat] al-ishriiq [Suhrawardi] and his fol-lowers denied it by saying that adding a definite quantity to another quantity necessitates its dissolution.\" Aifiir, 1.3 (89-90). See also the discussion Rahman, The Philosophy q[Mullii 99-100. 31. $urah caynfyyah, a concrete or objective form in the extramental world. This usage of the word ~iirah reveals its epistemic and ontological functions. In episte-mology, form is that by which we know things. In ontology, form is that by which a thing is what it is. $adra says that \"in our view, what is meant by the form is wujztd, not a generic concept.\" Aifiir, 1 (332; see also 294, 307). In both cases, ~ttrah is con-trasted to miiddah-a tradition that goes back to Aristotelian hylomorphism. Like the previous Muslim philosophers, $adra accepts Peripatetic hylomorphism in broad outlines. But his metaphysics of being makes hylomorphism rather secondary. 32. In other words, wujfid is more than the total sum of existing beings (mawjztdiit) that issue forth from it. Cf. 1.1 (54), where $adra provided a dis-cussion of why wz!Jiid is always more than its manifestations. 33. As Lahiji commented, the difference between essential necessity and pre-eternal necessity concerns the creation and preservation of beings. When things exist in concreto, they exist through a kind o( necessity that is conditional upon their source of existence. In relation to their source, they exist necessarily; but in relation to themselves, they exist only as pure relations or as mere shadows. This pertains to what $adra calls \"essential necessity.\" \"Pre-eternal necessity\" refers to"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Notes 83 God's act of creation that, when it necessitates things into existence. Cf. Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 83. 34. In theAifiir, $adra provided the following answer to the same question: \"The meaning of the Necessary Being is that it necessitates its own existence and by itself, without being in need of any active agent and performer, whereas the meaning of the realization of existence by itself is that when it is realized, it is either by itself, like the Necessary or through an active agent whose realization is not in need of another existence by which it subsists. This realization takes place only after the effect of the agent with its existence and its qualification with exis-tence. 1.1 (40-41). 35. As $adra stated in theAifiir and other works, the distinction between wujiid and miihryyah is a \"rational operation of the mind\" Wtibiir al-caql). It is not the case that things are composed of two separate qualities called existence and quiddity, which the mind puts together. It is the opposite: beings exist as single units, and the mind analyzes them into existence and quiddity. $adra put it as follows: \"Beings (wujiidiit) are actual identities particularized by themselves. are not qualified by genus, species, universality, and particularity in the sense that they belong to a species or genus or in the sense that they become particular through something added to them from outside. Rather, they are differentiated by them-selves, not through differentia (Ja!l) or accident (carafj). In this sense, they have no genus, differentia, or definition. 1.1 (53). 36. Like the word mu~a!!ilin, uses the word al-mu~aqqiqin to refer to some of the prominent philosophers with whom he associates himself. the word means \"those who verify the truth.\" It plays a significant role in the school of Ibn aVArabi. 37. $adra asserted that the relation between wujiid and quiddity is not causal but ontological. Wujiid does not simply precede quiddity and other states of exis-tence in terms of temporal priority; it does so through a generative act. 38. For $adra, the kind of cognition proper to wujiid is different from knowing its different modalities, such as sensation, imagination, and abstraction. We can have an intuition of wtljfid through \"illuminative presence and real witnessing,\" but even this experience of wtljiid is bound to remain subjective and mental. At any rate, knowledge by presence (al-cilm aHwf/iiri) is the best possible way to per-ceive the reality ofwujiid. Cf.Aifiir, 3.1 (292ff). 39. Lahiji commented: \"The (kunh) of wzljzld is not actualized [in the mind] because its reality is itself the external reality, the source of [existential] effects and the source of particularization and mental [qualities]. What is actual-ized in the mind is an aspect of universality and ambiguity. They [the two modes of being] are separate from one another and do not join, and the transfor-mation of one into another is without addition and diminution. The wtljiid of every existent is what dispels nonexistence, and it is external reality because the \"exter-nal\" and the \"mind\" are not receptacles and places. Rather, they are wujiid, which is called \"external\" when [existential] effects occur to it and is called \"mental\" when [these effects] do not occur to it.\" Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 104. 40. Referring to existence \"conditioned by nothing\" (bi-shar[ lii) as opposed to \"unconditioned by anything\" (lii bi-shar[ shayJ). The difference between the two is"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"84 Notes one of degree and modality and can be compared to the difference between \"whiteness\" and \"white.\" While \"whiteness\" refers to an accident, \"white\" refers to an object that has whiteness as an accident. Cf. Ashtiyani's note in Lahiji's Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 138. Dawud al-Qay~ari makes the following comment: \"Know that existence insofar as it is existence-namely, existence qua existence (min ~aythu huwa)-is different from external and mental existence. Each of these (modes) is a species of it. Therefore, existence insofar as it is existence-namely, existence not conditioned by anything (lii bi-shar! shay:J)-is not limited by abso-luteness and delimitation. [In this sense,] it is neither universal nor particular, neither general nor specific, and neither one with a [numerical] oneness added to its essence [a posteriori and from outside] nor many. On the contrary, it necessi-tates these things [meaning these qualities] in accordance with its degrees and stages, to which God refers as 'He is the One who raises the degrees and possesses the Throne.' And it becomes absolute, conditioned, universal, particular, general, specific, one, and many without there being any change in its essence and reality.\" Muqaddamiit, 29. 41. ~adra's concern was to establish wujud as the primary constituting agent in particular beings. When we say, \"A tree exists,\" it is not the case that there are two things: wujud on the one hand and the tree on the other. Rather, in the case of an existing tree, wujud exists \"as a tree,\" and the tree is a particular modality of wujud. In contrast to Suhrawardi and his followers, this peculiar relationship between wujud and its particularizations prevents any regression and vicious circle. 42. The relationship between existence and quiddity is not like the relationship between two independently existing entities: \"Wujud is the principal reality in existence, and the quiddity is derived from it.\" Aifiir, 1.3, 373. 43. I.e., the \"principle of derivation\" (al-qiicidah al-:fo/iyyah), discussed in n. 22 above. 44. ~adra relegated all existential attributes, properties, and qualifications to the self-subsistent and all-inclusive reality of wtyud. In its various modalities, wujud is particularized by itself, not by something exterior to it. The diversification and particularization of wt!Jud stems from the internal structure of the wujud itself. It is the mind that analyzes these modalities as quiddities and properties that qualify wujud. In reality, they are nothing but the manifestation of the self-delimiting act ofwujud. Cf.Aifiir, 1.1, 44-46. See also al-Masii:Jil al-qudsiyyah, 207-8. 45. As Lahiji pointed out, the principle of derivation does not apply to wujud and miihiyyah, because the relationship between the two is not one of qualification (itti}iil), but unification (itti~iid). \"Applying qualification to wujud and miihiyyah belongs to a wider category because qualification is between two [separate J things from the point of view of actualization, and it means [a kind of] occurring (al-curutj). But qualification can be used in a sense more general than occur-ring and unification. What is meant by qualification here is unification from the point of view of realization. The principle of derivation requires two separate things in terms of realization; whereas wujud and its relation [to quiddity] and miihiyyah fall outside this [consideration].\" Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 117-18. The dis-tinction between itti}iil and itti~iid has a long history in Islamic philosophy and plays a key role in ~adra's ontology and epistemology. Besides his other works,"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Notes 85 devoted a separate treatise to the question of unification called al-ciiqil wa)l-macqul of the Intellector and the Intelligible). For discussion of the three types of unification, see Itti(ziid, 22-24. For the English translation of the treatise, see Kalin, Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy, 256-86. 46. This is a key element of ,'?adra's ontology: wujud exists both as wujud and as concrete-specific entities. Things are real not because they are specific or have such-and-such qualities, but because they partake of the reality of wujztd. While ,'?adra makes a clear distinction between wujztd and mawjud (something that exists), he also states that what really exists in reality is nothing other than wujud. The \"thing that really exists\" (al-mawjud al-~aqiqi) is existence (wujud): \"The exis-tent is existence and its modes (atwiir), affairs (shuQun), and modalities (an~iiQ).\" Aifiir, 1.2, 341. 4 7. This is the problem of mental existence to which ,'?adra devoted consider-able space in his works. For a clear analysis, see Rizvi, Mull a Sadra and lVletaphysics, 77-101. 48. This is an indirect response to those who consider wujud an accident just like any other quality or property. As mentioned before, wujztd appears to be an accident that comes to inhere in actually existing beings. This was the position taken by Ibn Sina. But even if we admit that wujud is an accident, it is a special accident in the sense that things receive wujud from the Source of wujud-namely, the Necessary Being-as something by which they exist. ,'?adra's concern was to distinguish the relationship between wujud and miihiyyah from all other compara-ble relations. To use one of ,'?adra's examples, the body as an actually existing quiddity can exist without the quality or accident of whiteness because a body can be white, black, or red. Accidents do not add anything to the existential constitu-tion of actually existing beings. But this is not the case with wujud, because it is the Source of existence and nothing can exist and have any property without it. 49. One of the principles of classical Islamic philosophy going back to the Greeks states that the mind can know only forms, not matter. In other words, the mind can know things as universals; it cannot perceive their sensate and material properties. Al-Farabi was the first Muslim philosopher to state this principle with considerable clarity: \"As for the occurrence of the form in the intellect, it happens when the form of a thing exists in the intellect as singular and unattached into matter ... and as disengaged from all with which it is connected. In short, sensible objects are not known; sensibles are parables for what can be known.\" Al-Farabi, jawiibiit li-masiiQil suQila canhii, 104. The mind not only turns actually existing beings into abstract, generic, and universal concepts, but it also prioritizes what is conceptual in them. ,'?adra put it as follows: \"Essence is united with existence in concreto in a kind of essential unity (itti~iid). When the mind analyzes them into two things, it asserts the precedence of one over the other in concreto. Now, this [reality that precedes the other] is existence, because it is the principle of being the reality emanating from the [First] Principle (al-mabdaQ). As for the essence, it is united with and predicated of existence, not like an attached accident, but in its own reality [as essentially united with existence]. Insofar as the mind is con-cerned, the essence precedes the latter [namely, existence] because essence is the principle in mental judgments.\" Aifiir, 1.1 (56)."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"86 Notes 50. The five types of anteriority (taqaddum) can be explained as follows: nature applies to cases such as the whole the part. Anteriority by causality refers to causal priority, as in the case of the finger with which the ring moves. by time implies temporal sequence, such as today preceding tomorrow. The other two types of anteriority have an axiological and normative dimension. Anteriority by rank or degree and anteriority by dig-nity (qfrjal) refer to the place of things or states in a hierarchical order. A saint ha~ a higher spiritual state and thus precedes others in rank. Cf. Corbin's note in Le livre des penetrations metaphysiques, 149. It is clear that this system of anteriority and posteriority introduces a hierarchical order of things and extends from physical beings to spiritual beings. This hierarchy is generated and sustained by the grada-tional nature of existence (tashkik al-wuj\"i\"id), whereby wujud manifests itself in dif-ferent degrees and gradations of intensity and weakness. In the Aifiir, ~adra explained this being-centered hierarchy as follows: ''As for its equivocal predica-tion by primacy, priority, precedence, and intensity, this is so because, as we shall explain, existence requires itself in some beings, has precedence in some in terms of its nature, and is more perfect and stronger in some others. A being that has no cause has priority in existence compared to others and is, by definition, prior to all other beings. By the same token, the existence of each one of the active intellects has a priority over the existence of other intellects, and the existence of substance is prior to the existence of accident.\" Aifiir, 1.1 (36). It should be noted that ~adra took this paragraph almost verbatim from Ibn Sina's student Bahmanyar: \"Know that existence is predicated of what is under it equivocally, not univocally. This means that an existence that has no cause precedes by nature an existence that has a cause. the same token, the existence of substances precedes the existence of accidents. Similarly, some beings are stronger and some weaker. One cannot say that existence is a generic term predicated, for instance, on the existence of man, donkey, and stars univocally, like the colors yellow and red. As you shall learn, some things are prior to others, and the meaning of this is that the exis-tence (wujud) of those things is prior to the existence of other things; not that thing-ness (al-jismiyyah) itself is prior to thing-ness. Therefore, when we say that cause is prior to effect, it means that its existence is prior to the existence of the effect.\" Bahmanyar, Kitiib al-ta~.Jil, 281. 51. As the examples of materia prima and light imply, the penetration of wz!Jud into the world of particular beings is not based on a mechanical model. Rather, it encapsulates and fills the world of beings in the same way that the light of the sun shines upon dark objects. While this analogy gives an idea about the particular modalities of wujud, it runs the risk of assuming self-existing beings before or without the prior agency of wz!Jud. But as ~adra repeatedly states, wz!Jud does not come to things that already exist. It makes them exist as it forms and shapes them in myriad ways. 52. Such universal categories as species, genus, and specific difference, into which we divide things, do not exist in the extramental world. They are mental constructions that enable us to classify, analyze, and thus better understand things. What exists outside is a man who writes as a single and unified being, not"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Notes 87 something of a person on the one hand and a writer on the other. ~adra does not go into it here, but it is clear that this had been raised by the Muctazilites and some philosophers to explain the precise relationship between God and His names and qualities. The Ash carites made a distinction between God and His names and qualities to save God from change, which implied tion for the Greeks and the Muslim philosophers who followed them. The divine essence had to stay above and beyond all names and qualities that account for God's actions in the world, such as creating, forming, hearing, speaking, forgiving, and punishing. But the Ash carite theology never succeeded fully in explaining how God's names and qualities are different from but at the same time identical with God himself. The Muctazilite answer was similar to what ~adra described here concerning the relationship between wujud and its particular instantiations. For them, God's names and qualities were not separate from His essence. Rather, God is both Himself and loving, creating, forgiving, and so on, all at the same time. In other words, when we say that God is a speaker (mutakallim), what we mean is that \"God speaks,\" not that God has the quality of speech. For discussion of God's names and qualities, see 3.1 (121), where ~adra quoted al-Farabi to affirm the identity of God's essence with His names and qualities. 53. As ~adra (paragraph 94) further elaborates, wujud and its individuations are one and the same thing in the sense that wujud remains the generic source and particular modality of all things. Given the centrality of existence, it is a mis-take to explain particular beings in terms of substance, cause, or substratum. 54. As this and the following two paragraphs make clear, accidents are second-order beings that are, in turn, derived from the first-order reality of wujud. 55. ~adra's short autobiography in Aifiir, 1.1 (11), describes this dramatic change in terms of both an intellectual and a spiritual transformation. 56. Given the unrealness of quiddities in ~adra's metaphysics, his employment of miihfyyah as \"fixed essences\" (al-ayiin al-thiibitah) needs to be explained. Fixed essences refer to the universal patterns according to which entities receive the particular form of their existence. In this sense, they do not belong to the world of actually existing beings. They have an existence of their own only in relation to wujud and its particularizations. Lahiji explained this point as follows: \"Existences are effects that come about by way of effusion (Jayrj) from the instaurer. The rela-tion of effusion to the source of effusion is like the relation of a ray to the source of the ray itself. Existences are illuminative effusions from the wujiid, which is the true reality and is purely self-subsisting to the essences of contingent beings and fixed quiddities (al-miihfyyiit al-thiibitiit). Relations between existences are them-selves the realization of things; the quiddities have no realization in principle and by themselves. They have not smelled the perfume of existence primarily and by themselves; rather, the judgment of existence applies to them only in relation to what is attached to them [in the extramental world]. There are two ways of look-ing at contingent beings and particular things that exist in the world: [The first is J summary consideration, by which they are judged to exist and [by which] they do exist. [The second is] detailed consideration, because every contingent being is a composite pair and has two aspects: the aspect that looks toward its Lord, and"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"88 Notes the aspect that looks toward itself. The aspect of the Lord is wujiid [and is] included in the [which states that] 'everything is perishing except its [His] Face.' The aspect of itself is the quiddity included in the things that perish by them-selves and have not smelled the perfume of existence .... That is why it has been said that quiddities are nonexistent by themselves and existent [only] in judg-ment.\" Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 14 7. 57. Here Sadra reverts back to the standard meaning of miihiyyah. 58. The rich connotations offot~, rendered as \"open(ing),\" are lost in transla-tion. As Lahiji and Ashtiyani point out, Sadra's use of the word here is not casual; it alludes to understanding a subtle point as a special gift from God. \"Close open-ing\" (fot~ qarib), \"clear opening\" (fat~ mubin), and \"absolute opening\" (fot~ mutfaq) refer to different modes and degrees of spiritual illumination and unveiling \"from the station of the heart and the disclosure of God's Attributes and Perfections.\" Cf. Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 149-50. 59. This paragraph is a response to the Peripatetic and Ishraqi understanding of the particularization of wujiid through species. For the Peripatetics, the species refers to an actually existing and delimiting property by which things are distin-guished from one another. While Sadra agrees with this interpretation at one level, he rejects it at another level when he posits wujiid as the reality that accounts for both identity and difference in existence. \"Noble sciences\" translates al-culiim al-sharifah. culiim is the plural of cilm, meaning both \"knowledge\" and what we now call \"science\" and \"discipline.\" It makes more sense to understand the term culiim as the plural of knowledge and understanding rather than as any particular science. As Lahiji pointed out in Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 153-54, the reference to \"noble knowledge\" indicates the subtlety of the point Sadra was making in the paragraph. 60. For references to Suhrawardi as a Stoic, see Aifiir, 3.1 (181); 1.3 (291). For the relation between Suhrawardi and \"Stoicism\" in Islamic philosophy, see Walbridge, The Leaven qfthe Ancients, 187-90. 61. Lahiji makes an important observation about this point. Considered in themselves, all things are self-referential. In the larger scale of things, however, everything is related to everything else all the way to God, who, as the Cause of all causes, stands above causal links. Lahiji noted that everything has two aspects: one in regard to itself and the other in regard to its Lord. In regard to their Lord, things exist as real beings but also as an emanation from God. In regard to themselves, they exist as \"quiddities which have not smelled the smell of [real] existence.\" This dual nature of things penetrates the entire creation and explains the dialectical relationship between God and His creation. Cf. Shar~ risiilat al-mashii cir, 161. 62. As discussed above, jacl designates a particular mode of existentiating whereby an already-existing being is made to exist in a certain way. Rahman ren-ders jacl as \"causation,\" but it is clear that what is involved here is more than simply something causing something else. Rather,jacl refers to a process of existentiating whereby something comes to exist in a way specific to the nature of that thing. Sadra's main point is that it is wujiid and not quiddity that makes things into"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Notes 89 concrete and specific beings. Therefore, wujud remains active throughout the process of existing. 63. This Aristotelian argument (Posterior Ana{ytics 7lb 10) has been used and expanded upon in the Islamic philosophical tradition. ~adra agreed that the full knowledge of something can be achieved only when its cause is known. In a hierarchical sort of way, this goes all the way to God as the ultimate Cause of all things: to fully know the world, one needs to know God. This can be taken to be a version of what medieval Christian philosophers would call \"natural theology,\" whereby one moves from the knowledge of the world to the knowledge of God. But ~adra also refined the argument by saying that \"the knowledge of the building does not necessitate the knowledge of the builder but leads to the knowledge of the need of the building for its builder.\" Aifiir, 1.3 (397). In other words, we have an idea about the generic knowledge of the cause but cannot know it in its full details on our own. In the language of theology, this refers to the need for revelation and prophets for a proper knowledge and worship of God. 64. ~adra's concern was to emphasize the difference between the order of thought and the order of existence. From the point of view of the mind, every-thing is analyzed as belonging to the order of thought, where predication, judg-ment, qualification, derivation, \"occurring,\" or \"accidenting\" (curutj) and other modalities of relation take precedence over wujud and its modalities. For ~adra, the Peripatetics and the Illuminationists had failed to understand the full impli-cations of the difference between the concept (majhum) and the reality (~aqiqah) of beings. All other philosophical errors result from confounding the two orders of reality. For ~adra's discussion of this point, seeAifiir, 1.1 (37-49). For an analysis of this point in the school of Mulla ~adra, see Izutsu, The Concept and Reality qf Existence. 65. ~adra insisted that wujud remains the same in its essence even when it is particularized \"a thousand times.\" A tree is a tree not because it has a quiddity called \"tree-ness,\" which is secondary to its existential constitution, but because it is the form or essence in which wujud has been particularized. Instead of saying that \"a tree exists,\" it would be more proper to say that \"wujud exists as a tree.\" In the former, the emphasis is on the essence, whereas the latter underlies the priority of wujud. As is clear from the preceding discussions, what is essential is to understand the way in which wujud particularizes and manifests itself, not how quiddities come to be named. 66. The insertion of the word mu~aqqiqun (the verifiers) shows attach-ment to the school oflbn aVArabi. It seems that ~adra inserted the word to draw attention to the subtlety of the point he is making concerning the relationship between wujiid and its modalities. 67. Lawazim, which is the plural of liizim and has been rendered here as \"con-comitant,\" refers to an essential aspect of things that is required by their own nature. The lazim of something expresses both logical and ontological necessity. For instance, the fact that light makes things visible is a logical necessity of the defini-tion and existence of light. When ~adra says that \"the concomitants of quiddity are conceptual notions,\" he refers to the mental-conceptual nature of the quiddities. Since the quiddities are eventually mental abstractions created by the mind, their"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"90 Notes corresponding reality is notions and concepts, not ex1stmg Therefore, instauration as a subset of existentiating can take only at the level of existential effects and Cf. the note by Ashtiyani in Shar~ risiilat al mashiicir, 169. 68. ~adra devoted considerable space to the way in which wujiid generates the world of multiplicity and interacts with it. This is understandable, given his attempt to construct a dynamic cosmology underpinned by a gradational ontol-ogy. Unlike Aristotle, whose metaphysics was based on fixed substances and a static world order, ~adra saw everything undergoing an existential journey. His famous concept to describe this is substantial motion (al-~arakat al-jawhariyyah), which upholds that all existing beings, including substances, undergo substantial change to reach their telos (ghayah). In contrast to the Peripatetic tradition, ~adra allowed change in substances because he defined them in terms of existence and its degrees of existentiating. For more on this, see Kalin, \"Between Physics and Metaphysics,\" 65-93. Concerning the way in which wujfid \"penetrates\" into the world of creation through instauration, substantial motion, and other forms of existentiating, ~adra used an elaborate vocabulary and borrowed several terms from Ibn aVArabi-for instance, \"flow of existence\" (sarayiin al-wzyiid) in Aifiir, 1.1 (67, 146, 381) and 1.2 (327), \"expanding existence\" (al-wujiid al-munbasip) in 1.2 (328, 331-33) and 3.2 (10-11), and \"Breath of the Compassionate\" (nqfos al-ra~miin) in Aifiir, 2.3 (5) and 1.1 (47, 164, 381), to describe the flow of existence into the various levels and planes of being. Ibn al-cArabi uses the richly suggestive term \"Breath of the Compassionate\" for the generation and suste-nance of the universe with God's \"Breath.\" See Chittick, The Sufi Path q[Knowledge, 127-30, and idem., The Self-Disclosure q[God, 69-70. 69. This is a key point in ~adra's metaphysics and pertains to his conception of the universe as a living being. ~adra's \"cosmological vitalism\" is thoroughly onto-logical and thus different from the Bergsonian elan vital. Rather, it is based on a particular understanding of existence as the creative Act of God. For ~adra, \"whatever is established in existence is capable of being intelligible even poten-tially.\" Itti~iid, 71. ~adra considered this to be self-evident because wujiid contains in itself all of the primary and secondary qualities, including life, intelligence, volition, and goodness. But \"the majority of intelligent people are incapable of understanding the penetration of knowledge, power, and volition in all things, including stones and inanimate objects, just like the penetration of existence in them. 3.1 (335-36). Just as wujiid manifests itself in a hierarchical order, the sharing of the \"vital qualities\" of existence is also hierarchical: \"The abode of existence is one, and the whole universe is a big living being. Its dimensions are conjoined with one another, but not in the sense of the conjunction of measure-ment and the unification of surfaces and environs. Rather, what is meant is that each degree of existential perfection must be adjacent to a degree that befits it in (a similar) existential perfection.\" Aifiir, 2.2 (342). He also said: \"All existence, from its highest to the lowest and from its lowest to the highest, is [united] in a single relationship by which some parts of it are related to some others. All things are united in spite of their external diversity. Their unity is not like the conjunc-tion of corporeal bodies whereby their goals are conjoined and their surfaces"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Notes 91 linked. Rather, the whole universe is one single animate being (~ayawan wa~id), like a soul.\" Aifar, 2.2 (349-50). life and to inanimate objects has a long history among both the ancient Greeks and the Muslim thinkers. Aristotle opposed the idea in De Anima 404b and 433a and in Metaphysics 980b. For the history of this idea in Western philosophy, see Sorabji, Animal Minds and Human Morals, especially 12-16. 70. In the Aifar, ~adra gave a different classification of wujztd. Quoting cAla~ al-Dawlah al-Simnani, one of the prominent commentators of Ibn aVArabi, ~adra said that the proper subject matter of metaphysics is not actual substances and their properties, as Aristotle would say, but divine theophany (tajalli): \"The True Being (al-wujiid al-~aqq) is God the Exalted, the absolute Existence (al-wujiid al-mutfaq) is His Act (jicl), and the conditioned existence (al-wujiid al-muqayyad) is His Work (athar). And what we mean by the absolute existence is not existence as a generic abstract term but expanding existence.\" Aifar, 1.2 (330). 71. Cf. Aifar, 1.2 (328). For the use of this expression in Ibn aVArabi, see Chittick, The Suji Path if Knowledge, 133. 72. Genus is a category in which multiple beings participate. Since God is the only being of His kind, He does not share a set of qualities with other beings. That is why God has no genus, species, or differentiae. Lahiji adds that \"the Necessary Being is pure being and pure goodness outside all categories, including the cate-gory ofrelation.\" Shar~ risalat al-mashacir, 181. 73. This is another way of stating the difference between the concept (majhiim) and reality (~aqiqah) of something-a difference that ~adra used profusely in his analyses of wzyiid. As he stated in Aifar, 1.1 (37): \"Existence as a concept is a generic term predicated of concrete existents univocally (bi'l-tqfawut), not equivo-cally (bi'l-tawati).\" But \"the reality of existence qua existence is not limited by gen-erality and delimitation, universality and particularity, and inclusiveness and specificity. It is neither one [numerically] by a oneness added to it, nor many .... In its essence, it is nothing but full realization, actuality, and manifestation. These meanings of contingency, concepts of universality, attributes of rational considera-tion, and terms of mental analysis are attached to it on account of its degrees and stations.\" Aifar, 1.1 (259). Lahiji's comment is also illuminating: with-out the consideration of wujiid is quiddity ... and meaning and concept with the consideration of wujiid is reality.\" Shar~ risalat al-mashacir, 187. 74. The Eighth Penetration (paragraphs 102-3) and the First Path (para-graphs 104-15) are devoted to the proofs for the existence of God. While estab-lishing God as the source, cause, plenitude, and return point of all things, ~adra also hinted at the utter contingency of the world to the point of calling it a shadow, pure relation, and even an \"imaginary reality.\" This immediately raises questions about the reality of the world in which God manifests His names and qualities. Given God's overpowering being, is the world a mirage? ~adra did not delve into this question here, but his commentator Lahiji cautioned against declaring the world to be a mere image, a mirage, or a figment of imagination: \"There is no doubt that the instaured beings in the universe are many; and the one that is emanated in reality is real, not as some have imagined, that what is in existence is a fancy/delusion (wahm) and a mirage. This wahm is by necessity a mistake. That the sage attributes imagination (al-kha_yal) to those things in existence has an aspect to it. But by 'imagination,' he does not mean an imagined (mawhzim) thing"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"92 Notes that has no referent in Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 189-90. Mulla Fanari added further clarification to this when he said that \"forms have no real existence because they are nonexistent relational forms, and the meaning of their existence comes from the fact that wujud is related to them ... [but] the claim about the of contingent beings is based on the fact that their necessitate their nonexistence had the divine manifestation not turned to them.\" Mi~bii~ al-uns, 247-48, quoted in Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 190 n. 1. 75. This is a passage from ontology to theology and corresponds to \"general matters of metaphysics\" (al-umur al-ciimmah) and uthuliljiyii, or \"the science of the Lord\" (al-cilm al-rububi). This does not involve a hierarchy between ontology and theology in the modern senses of these terms. In ~adra, as in all traditional phi-losophy, metaphysics comprises both ontology and theology because the ultimate sources of all that is, from existence to quiddities, is eventually God Himself. 76. Burhiin mashriqi can also be translated as \"oriental proof\"; but in both cases, the meaning is related to enlightenment and illumination: it is a kind of demon-stration obtained through spiritual vision and intellectual illumination. Mulla Ismacil al-I~fahani called it \"a demonstration that comes from the real orient, which is the source of all effusion, exalted is His Glory.\" Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 199. For the school of Mulla ~adra, this type of argument is stronger and more convincing than \"logical proof\" (burhiin man,tiqi). 77. In stating more clearly the distinction between God and His creation, Lahiji disagreed slightly with ~adra: \"When we say that 'God is the source of all existents,' it is an allegorical expression in the sense that His act is the source of things, because nothing originates from Him [directly] and He acts by Himself-namely, through His own action. God is above His own action because He is the eternal (al-azal), whereas action is in the world of preferred contingency. Nothing has descended from eternity (al-azal) to contingency (al-imkiin); likewise, noth-ing has ascended from contingency to eternity in one respect. The intelligibles are from His act of creation (al-takwin) and establishing (al-inshii\").\" Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 204. 78. In his important gloss on this paragraph, Lahiji developed an argument for the ontological servitude of all creation to God. God is plenitude because He is pure being. But He is also above plenitude because even plenitude implies some sort of relation. All creatures depend on God and thus worship Him in their own way. Those who worship Him in a \"general and absolute way\" are those who pro-fess His oneness, whereas those who worship Him in a \"limited and conditioned way\" are those who take partners unto Him. In this sense, the disbelievers (al-kuffiir), Magians, materialists (dahriyyah), and naturalists (tibiiciyyah) are not outside the category of ontological dependence and servitude. Jews and Christians worship God, but in an incomplete way because they mistake some of His names and qualities for His absoluteness. Lahiji added that \"among all the past nations, Christians are closest to God besides the Mu}:lammadiyyin.\" The Christians wor-ship God in the person of Jesus, Mary, and the Holy Spirit. This does not befit God's absolute oneness and moves Christians away from the \"state of affirming the oneness of God (al-muwa~~idin).\" Yet they remain closer to the truth of the Divine because \"whoever has witnessed God in man has a witnessing more perfect"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Notes 93 than all those who have witnessed God in anything other than man.\" Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 207. This is a reference to the Islamic belief that while God has revealed His Names and Qualities in His creation, they are manifested most per-fectly in the human state. Lahiji's view of Christians as being closer to the truth of God is in tandem with the attitude to see them in a more favorable light than they see other communities. This is based on 5:82-84, which states: \"Thou wilt surely find that, of all people, they who say, 'Behold, we are Christians,' come closest to feeling affection for those who believe [in this divine writ]: this is so because there are priests and monks among them, and because these are not given to arrogance.\" The classical commentaries interpreted this verse as refer-ring to Negus or Najashi, the Christian king of Abyssinia, who had sheltered the Muslim delegation from the Makkans. See Ibn Kathir, Tqfiir, 521. See also Ibn Qayyim al-:Jawziyyah, Ziid al-Masirfi cilm al-tqfiir, 401. The Muctazilite theologian al-Jal).iz (d. 868) mentioned Najashi as one of the reasons Muslims consider Christians closer to them. See al-Jal).iz, al-Rad cala al-na.Jiirii, 260. Historically speaking, this positive attitude toward Christians has led to a clearly more favor-able view of the Byzantine Empire than that of the Sassanids in early Islamic his-tory. For more on this matter, see El Cheikh, Byzantium Viewed by the Arabs, 24-33. See also Shboul, \"Byzantium and the Arabs,\" 235-60. 79. In the Aifiir, 1.1 (54), ~adra stated the same point as follows: \"Existence, insofar as it is existence, has no agent from which it emanates, no matter into which it transforms, no subject in which it is found, no form by which it is clothed, no goal for which it is [established]. Rather, it itself is the agent of all agents, the form of all forms, and the goal of all goals.\" 80. Sabziwari elaborated on the same point when he said: \"Existence is the source of all explanations in which all descriptions come to an end. And it is the source of all sources and descriptions. When the Prophet, may peace and blessing be upon him, was asked, what did you know your Lord?' he replied that 'I knew everything by Him.\"' Shar~ al-manr,umah, 2:60. 81. In the Aifiir, ~adra put the same point thus: \"But the Necessary Being has no proof, no definition, and therefore no reason from a number of different points of view. It has no reason for existence, like an active [agent] and ultimate goal; no reason for constitution (al-qiwiim), like matter and form; and no reason for quid-dity, like genus and differentia. In spite of this, nothing is hidden from It, and It is the proof of everything and closest to everything. As He the Exalted said: 'And We are closer to you than your jugular vein' (Q. 50:16). And He said: 'And He is with you wherever you are' (Q. 57:4). And He is the proof of His own essence, as He said: 'God testifies that there is no god but He' (Q. 3:18). He also said: 'Is your Lord not sufficient [as a proof] that He is a witness to all things' (Q. 41:53), and 'Say: What is greater as witness? Say: Allah' (Q. 6:19).\" Aifiir, 1.3 (399-400). 82. In religious terms, this means that there cannot be more than one God. Two infinite beings cancel each other out because, as ~adra said in the paragraph, this would imply sharing the qualities of infinitude, which would lead to imperfec-tion. This is a commentary on the verse \"al-Anbiya~,\" 21:22: \"If there were to be a deity other than God on [earth and heavens], they would certainly go corrupt.\" See also \"al-Qa~a~,\" 28:88; \"al-Anbiya\",\" 21:108; and \"al-Nahl,\" 16:51."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"94 Notes 83. Following the Platonic tradition, Muslim phltlm;opheJrs nifies whereas poterltl<Hlty is full realization because a substance in actu is not deprived of any real qualities it may possess. A potential substance, however, is marred by imperfection because it can be what it is only when it realizes its potentialities through the intervention of an external agent, a more actualized substance. See theAifar, 1.3 (343-44). 84. \"All points of view\" is a reaffirmation of the fact that the is necessary by itself and in relation to everything else. Contingent beings are necessary when considered in relation to their concrete existence in the world. But they are contingent in relation to their source. This applies to all beings, from the detached intellects to material substances, with differing degrees of ontological intensity. The Being, however, is above such conditionalities; it is necessary in all regards and considerations. The I'.IF•rP\"\"<'r\" Being cannot be necessary, one, or infinite from only one point of view; it must, by definition, be all these things in all respects. The confusion that some people have about the meaning of \"all points of view\" comes \"from the contingent which is necessary by something else.\" Shar~ risalat al-mashacir, 220. 85. established the absolute unity of \"the essence of the Being\" (tawMd al-dhat), ~adra moved to demonstrate the unity of \"the act(s) of the Necessary Being\" (taw~id alficl). The relation between essence and act is a key issue of metaphysics whereby a thing remains itself while exercising its agency in the world. When God carries out an action, He does not lose anything from His absolute oneness, the contrary of which would plunge Him into the multiplicities and contingencies of the world of creation. God's act of creation, or what called the emanation of the Being upon all things, does not lead to multiplicity or indigence in His essence. To this was an important step toward seeing all things through the eyes of unity and thus recognizing the tran-scendent unity of being (wa~dt al-wujz\"\"id). For the highest form of divine unity \"is to see nothing but one in existence.\" Recognizing the reality of multiplic-ity, ~adra hastened to add, \"This [way of seeing] is the penultimate goal of the sciences of unveiling. Verily, what really exists is only one. The multiplicity [that you see] in it is only for the one who separates his vision. But the vision of the uni-fier (al-muwa~~id) is not separated [from oneness] by the multiplicity of the heav-ens, the earth, and other beings. He sees all things as one single thing. But the secrets of the sciences of unveiling cannot be jotted down in a book.\" Aifar, 1.2 (323-24). ~adra also said: \"The Being by itself is necessary from all points of view. There is no contingency in its all-inclusive essence. It is found with all beings, without any delimitation and multiplicity. Therefore, it is in everything and not in anything, at every moment and not in time, in every place and in no place; it is all things and not any one of them. 3.2 (332). The same point is reiterated in the Ma::;ahir: \"His ipseity (inniyyah), the exalted, is His essence (mahiyyah), the exalted; and His existence, the exalted, is the existence of every-thing. His existence is the truth of existence without there being in it any stain of nonexistence and multiplicity.\" Al-Ma::;ahir, 24-25. 86. ~adra quoted this verse in theAifar in the following context: \"The essential contingency (al-imkan al-dhati) comprising all contingent beings is pointed out in"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Notes His words, the 'All things are perishing save His face.'

As Lahiji pointed out, this paragraph is concerned with \"the manifestation of the penetration of the light of wujfid in all things, and the demonstration of unity in multiplicity (al-wa~dahfi al-kathrah).\" Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 230. 88. This is one of the key elements of ~adrean rn.,tc.nf-\"\"''r\"' plicity\" is based on the that a simple, noncon:1pos:1te itself multiple existential without simple being cannot be divided into composites, \"extracted\" from it; otherwise, it would be not Being is potentially \"all things\" because, as the source of all beings, nothing can be outside it. Cf. the Aifiir, 1.3 (324-25); Itti(ziid, 93-94. In the Aifiir, 1.2 (368); 1.3 (338); 2.2 (216-18), ~adra traced the idea back to Plato. He also applied the prin-ciple of simplicity to God's Knowledge of things; cf.Aifiir, 3.1 (110). ~adra rPr\">c.rPrt the same principle for intellect when he said that \"a simple intellect is all intelli-gibles\" (a!-caql al-basi_t kull al-macqiiliit). Aifiir, 1.3 (377). 89. This section deals with the problem of God's of things-a prob-lem with a long history among the Mutakallimun, the philosophers, and the Sufis. ~adra rejected the Peripatetic concept of knowledge as and \"impres-sion in the mind\" (irtisiim) for God, because it implies that God knows things as we know them. But since God is the creator of all things and their existence, he must know them in a different way. God cannot know things through \"abstrac-tion\" either, because there is nothing abstract or in God. Furthermore, God must know things in such a way that His knowledge does not cause change in His essence. In the Aifiir, ~adra provided a detailed summary of the views of previous philosophers on this subject all the way from Plato and to al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, Suhrawardi, and Ibn aVArabi. See 3.1 (180-81); 1.3 (387-95). He divided the various theories into two broad groups: those that con-sider God's knowledge separate from His essence and those that do not. He stated this point as follows: \"In affirming God's knowledge of things, there are two possible ways: we say that it is either separate from His essence or not. Those who hold the view of separation either argue for the affirmation of nonexistents (al-macdiimiit) or [they do] not-that is, whether they are attributed to external existence, as in the case of the 1\\lluctazilites, or to the mind, as in the case of some Sufi masters such as the master sage and verifier (al-mu~aqqiq) al-Din ibn aVArabi and the perfect master ~adr al-Din al-Qtmawi, from whose famous books benefits are derived. According to the second view, either we have to say that God's knowledge of external beings is forms that subsist themselves and is separate from Him and other things-and these are the Platonic archetypes and separate forms-or we have to say that His knowledge of external beings is the things themselves .... As for those who argue for the nonseparation [of God's knowledge from His essence], either they have to say that it is other than His essence (which is the view of the two masters al-Farabi and Ibn Sina), or they have to say that it is the same as His essence. In the second case, they either have to admit, like Porphyry and his followers among the that His essence"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"96 Notes is united with intellective forms, or [they must] say that His essence by itself has the summary of other than Himself and other than the first effect [the first created being] in the manner to which we have alluded.\" Asfiir, 3.1 (181-82). 90. The unification of the intellect and the intelligible (itti~iid al-caqil wa)l-macqul) is one of the cornerstones of Sadra's epistemology. It argues for a relation of unity between the intellect and its objects of intellection. Still, it is radically different fro in the representational theory of knowledge advocated by the devoted considerable space to this issue in his corpus and wrote a separate treatise, entitledltti~iid al-ciiqil wa)l-macqul, to defend it against Ibn Sina and his followers. For the English translation of the treatise and a detailed study, see Kalin, Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosopfy;. 91. This is the point Wittgenstein made concerning first-order propositions. When I say that \"I am in pain,\" there is no difference between the I who utters this sentence and the I/person who is in pain. Cf. Wittgenstein,Philosophicallnvestigations, paragraph 246. For Sadra, knowledge as representation, which places both an ontological and a cognitive distinction between the knower and the known, cannot account for self-knowledge and its modalities. SeeAsfiir, 1.3 (288-89). 92. Reference to the Qur~anic verse, \"All is perishing save His face\" (28:88). 93. This is one of the clear statements of wa~dat al-wujud in $adra. The tran-scendent unity of being, as formulated by Ibn al-cArabi and his followers, is based on an ontological non-duality whereby all primary and secondary causes are reduced to wujud.Just as God is the \"Cause of all causes\" and the of all principles\" in theology, wujud is the Source of all effects and qualities in ontol-ogy and cosmology. $adra also applied the principle of ontological simplicity to God's knowledge of things. See Asfiir, 1.3 (399-400). God is the ultimate source of all existence, and wujud is the proximate cause of contingent beings. As wujud is God's face looking to the world of creation, all beings, small and big, are like rays and effusions from God through the modalities of wujud. $adra said: \"It is well-established and clear, in the view of the verifiers among the sages and the divine philosophers among the philosophers, that the wujfid of everything is nothing but an individual reality related to the wujud of the True and Self-Subsisting One .... Existential ipseities are among the degrees of the manifestation of His essence and rays of His majesty and beauty.\" This principle of ontological simplicity-cum-relationality applies to the order of knowledge: \"The perception of something is nothing but a consideration of the way in which this thing is related to the Necessary Being; [and] from this particular point of view, [the Necessary Being] is its existence and the state of its existing (mawjudryyah).\" This interplay between the order of existence and the order of knowledge led $adra to a conclusion that unites the two orders: \"It is not possible to understand this [point] without under-standing the essence of the True One.\" What $adra says here is extremely signifi-cant for his metaphysics of wujud. Since, for $adra, wujud is a single reality appearing as matter and form, substance and accident, actor and action, knower and known, all cognition is eventually an exercise in wujud. All chains of causation return to the self-regulating and self-generating reality of wujud. And since wujud is nothing but an effusion from the infinite reality of God, \"whoever has perceived"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Notes 97 something of concrete beings, he has God. are ignorant of this except for the elite and the saints of God, the Exalted. As it is narrated from the Commander of the Believers ibn Abi 'falib), 'I saw nothing but God before it, with it, and in it.' It is clear and manifest that this simple perception of the True One, the occurs for all of His servants. But this does not mean that one can perceive Him in the depth of His Essence.\" Aifiir, 1.1 (116-17). To prove the eventual unity of being, ~adra also used the argument from ontological simplicity, according to which \"a simple being is all things\" (basip al-~aqiqah kull al-ashyii'} See the section entitled \"The Necessary is all things and all and all things return to Him\" inAifiir, 3.1 (110-18). 94. ~adra rejected both the Ashcarite and Muctazilite positions by using again the argument from ontological simplicity. The Muctazilites denied any names and attributes to God for fear of violating His absolute unity. Instead of saying that God has knowledge as an attribute, they said that He acts in a state of knowledge. contrast, the Ash carites affirmed the existence of divine names and qualities but pushed the argument to the point of intimating dualities and multiplicities in the divine essence. Al-Ash cari's answer that \"God's knowledge (cilm Allah) cannot be said to be either God himself or different from Him\" is obviously not satisfac-tory. See his response to the Muctazilites in his Maqiiliit al-isliimiyyin, 2:178. For a defense of the Ash carite position by Fakhr al-Din see his al-Ma.tiilib al-ciiliyah min al-cilm al-iliihi, 3:141-79. ~adra developed his concept of Divine names and attributes on the basis of the hierarchical simplicity of wujftd. God has names and qualities, but they exist neither apart from Him nor as part of His identity. He contains all such attributes because His wujud is the most intense and simple of all beings. God can be said to have many names, but the real point is that \"all of His qualities and attributes exist through a single wt!}ud, and it is the wujud of the essence.\" Aifiir, 3.1 (142). For more on this see Fazlur Rahman, The Philosophy q[Mulla Sadra, 141-46. 95. As Lahiji explained in his commentary, since God knows His own Self, He must also know all things because ultimately He is the \"necessary cause\" for all things. The difficult question is how God remains untainted the knowledge of contingent and changing things. To avoid any confusion, the Muctazilites postu-lated God's knowledge of things as separate from His essence. Some Sufis also subscribed to this view. Suhrawardi and 'fusi defined His knowledge as the very existence of things, therefore avoiding the assignment of a separate existence to things that God comes to know a posteriori. Some held that God knows things through the \"Platonic forms,\" which are forms of knowledge existing by them-selves. Lahiji supported Suhrawardi's view as the \"strongest argument.\" Cf. Lahiji, Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 273. 96. In epistemic terms, this means that knowledge of cause is more primary than knowledge of effect. This leads to a typical Aristotelian principle (Posterior Analytics 71b 10), according to which we have a full knowledge of an effect when we truly know its cause. The theological connotation of this principle is quite clear: it is only by knowing God that we can know the world. This conclusion can be seen as an intimation of ~adra's defense of the burhiin al-~iddiqin (the argument of the veracious), which takes God's being, rather than that of the world, as the"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"98 Notes point of a sound demonstration of the existence of God. for the existence of God 3.1 (1-118). See also Existence q[God. For Ibn Sina, see \"Ibn Sina's Burhan al-~iddiqin,\" 18-39. 97. conclusion was again based on the ontology of wujtid: just as pure wujiid is the source of all existents while remaining untainted by their deficiencies, God's knowledge of things does not bring any change, impermanence, and defi-ciency into the divine essence. See his discussion in al-Mabda:; wa>l-macad, 121. found all previous explanations of God's knowledge of things unsatisfac-tory because they take away something either from God's omnipresence (al-qadir) or from His omniscience (al-calim). For his detailed discussion, 3.1 (189-237); see also Rahman, The Philosophy qf Mullii $adrii, 146-50; Kalin, Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy, 173-80. 98. In other words, God's power is not an attribute separate from and His power encapsulates all forms of power. As a result, things have power because of their relation to God's power, not because they possess some essential properties. 99. ~adra introduced two types of unity: numerical unity (al-wa~dat al-cadadi)!yah) and intellective oneness (wa~dat al-caqli)!yah). The former refers to ordinary numeri-cal order, whereby a thing is \"one\" as opposed to being \"two,\" \"three,\" etc. The latter denotes a state of ontological simplicity, whereby a being is single in its state of existence. As ~adra put it: \"The unity of expanding existence is not numerical (cadadi), which is the beginning of numbers. It is a reality that expands in the temples (hayiikil) of contingent beings and the tablets of quiddities,\" Aifiir, 1.2 (328). In Itti~iid al-ciiqil wa>l-macqiil, 3 7-38, ~adra provided a detailed description of the types of oneness. His analysis is worth quoting in full: \"Oneness is of many modes, and the oneness of intellects is not numerical, which is the source of num-bers, such as the oneness of body and blackness, movement, and so on among the material things. The oneness of the intellect is rather like the oneness that belongs to the species. The difference between numerical and other kinds of oneness is the following: oneness in material bodies, like their existence, accepts augmentation and diminution, and it is different from its like when it is considered to be [increased or decreased]. [In this way,] the sum total is greater and more than one. Therefore, two bodies are more than one of them [alone]. In the same way, the state of these two blacknesses, in their being two, is not like the state of one in its oneness; and this is in contradiction to intellective oneness. If we suppose, for instance, the existence of one thousand homogeneous intellective forms, the state of one [intellect] in its oneness would be like this one thousand in its multiplicity. An example of this is the man qua man. When you add to this meaning a meaning similar to it in terms of its specific reality after its being disembodied from [its] additional qualities (al-zawii:;id), you would find neither it nor the whole [of man and the meaning added to it] in their second [state], except in the way you have found the first one in its oneness. For this reason, it is mentioned in discussions of quiddity that when additional qualities that individuate [a quiddity] are cut off from each meaning, which is related to its species with multiple members in the external world, an intellective form of it is inscribed in the soul. When it is cut off from another individual that distinguishes it [from others] in external existence, what is added to the shared quiddity does not affect the soul with a different effect"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Notes 99 except the first [one]. The author of to this mean-ing when he said, 'Whenever you consider pure existence than which there is nothing more perfect] for the second time and look at it again, [you see that] it is what it is; thus, there is nothing that distinguishes (mayyiz) a pure thing [other than itself].\"' For the full translation of Risiilah.fi itti~iid ... , see Kalin, Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy, 256-86. 100. This section is repeated almost verbatim in al-Ma~iihir al-iliih~yah, 62. 101. This is a reference to an old problem in Kalam discussions of divine Is God's speech eternal or created? Since no temporality can be attrib-uted to God, His speech must be eternal. then, does not this introduce change and multiplicity into the domain of the attributes which, in turn, leads to change in the divine essence? To address this issue, some theologians argued that God's intended meaning is eternal (qadim), whereas His words are temporal (~adith). In the discussion over the createdness of the QurJan, most Ashcarites came to the conclusion that the meaning of the QurJan is eternal, whereas its words, letters, and sounds are created. from the Ashcarites, ~adra criticized the Muctazilites for holding that God creates all \"sounds and letters with a refer-ent,\" because this theory collapses all speech into divine speech. ~adra's solution is rooted in his ontology. God creates the \"perfect words\" which, according to Lahiji, are the \"beings of the world of the intellect and the world which subsists with the subsistence of God.\" Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 286. 102. The difference between ciilam al-amr, translated here as \"the world of the divine command,\" and ciilam al-khalq, \"the world of creation,\" is a element of the Islamic metaphysics of creation. Throughout his writings, ~adra described ciilam al-amr as the abode of disembodied or \"abstract\" beings (al-mujarradiit) in which are to be found the intellects, the angels, the eternal souls, and other spiri-tual realities. This is the world that comes from the divine command and that also commands on lower levels of existence. In a sense, this is the world in which God acts directly and primarily before the effects of His command are manifested in the world of creation. In this regard, ciilam al-amr is invisible, abstract, and absent to the naked eye. contrast, the world of creation is visible, manifest, and concrete. It is where wujiid manifests itself as physical beings, sensate forms, cor-poreal entities, and so on. Everything in the world of the command is found in the form of principles, whereas the world of creation displays them as specific applica-tions. That is why ~adra made a distinction between kaliim (word, speech, or speaking) and kitiib (the book). Word is the principle and is always more than its concrete form-namely, the book. The book, on the contrary, depends for its exis-tence on the word. In another respect, the word is concise and condensed, whereas the book is detailed. Cf.Aifiir, 3.2 (10-18). Another way of stating this is to say that the word is simple (basi.t) and the book is composite (murakkab), in the philosophi-cal senses of the terms. Cf. Lahiji, Shar~ risiilat al-mashiicir, 292. 103. ~adra used the same analogy to explain the relationship between the Creator and the created. Since the world of creation is absolutely dependent upon its Creator for its existence, God's relation to the world is not like the relation of a building to its builder or the relation of a writing to its writer. Once a builder builds something, it continues to exist on its own, despite the fact that it bears the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"100 Notes imprint of its builder. Rather, the relation is more like the relation of a word to its The word exists as long as the utters it; it ceases to exist when stops talking. Cf. Aifar, 1. 2 (216). 104. ~adra is playing here with the etymological connection between the words qurQan andfurqan. While QurQan is the name of the revealed book oflslam, it also means, among other things, that which can be compared and thus brought together. contrast,Jurqan, which is also one of the names of the Qur\"an, means separating, putting apart, and discernment. or speech, both unites and dif-ferentiates. The as the differentiates truth from falsehood and then unites everything in the divine. 105. The expression \"those who possess heart-knowledge\" occurs sixteen times in the Qur\"an. In this passage, there is allusion to the verse \"And no one remem-bers except those who possess heart-knowledge\" (2:269; 3:7). 106. In the Aifar, 1.2 (220-24), ~adra mentioned six types of action and omit-ted tajalli from the list. It is clear from this short discussion here, as well as from ~adra's more extensive analyses of the subject in his other works, that the problem of action concerns three types of beings: humans, nature, and God. As the active and passive agents of action, humans occupy a central place in ~adra's theory of action. But this is also true for divine action because all action, whether human or divine, voluntary or natural, is interrelated. 107. ~adra equated the meaning of \"the intellect,\" \"the pen,\" and light\" because their ultimate referent is the same: they are all pure, spiritual sub-stances. The fact that the first existent that God has created is a spiritual substance is in tandem with ~adra's ontocosmological hierarchy, which begins with pure being and then descends into lower levels of existence to the lowest rung of the great chain of being. It is clear that the intellect the philosophers talk about here is not human reason in the limited sense of the term, but intellect as a cosmological and ontological principle that unites the various orders of exis-tence. ~adra gave a philosophical exposition of this l).adith in his commentary on the famous Shicite J:Iadith book U~ul al-kiifi, compiled by Abujacfar Kulayni. ~adra's commentary is subtitled Kitab al-caql wa'l-jahl (\"The Book of Intellect and Ignorance\"), which shows his concern for dealing with the concept of the intellect in a variety of ways. 108. Paragraphs 125-36 quote a number of sayings from Shicite sources. It is not uncommon to see ~adra quoting verses and sayings of the Prophet Mul).ammad and Shicite Imams in his discussions of dense philosophical and cosmologi-cal issues. As a matter of fact, ~adra wrote a number of important works in the field of transmitted sciences (al-culUm al-naqliyyah), including a philosophical com-mentary on the Qur\"an. Since in this part of the Mashacir he is dealing with the problem of cosmogenesis, he cites religious sources to explain the creation of the present order of existence. With this exercise, ~adra also shows his desire and ability to dovetail rational and religious arguments in philosophical issues. 109. John 3:13. 110. cilliyyin is used in Qur\"an 83:18-19. According to most commentators, it refers to a sublime place where the book of deeds for the virtuous is preserved. Derived from the root word culuww and from cala, it signifies something high and"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Notes 101 exalted and is contrasted with sijjin Some describe cllli)yin as the seventh heaven. used the word in Iksir al-carifin, translated by Chittick as The Elixir qf the Gnostics, 13. For the classical commentaries, see Ibn Kathir, Tqfiir al-Qur:Jiin al-cazim, 1693; al-Qurtubi, al-Jiimi:J li)l-a~kiim al-Qur:Jiin, 2:3277; see also the exposition given the Sufi commentator Ibn cAjibah in al-Ba~r al-madidfi tqfiir al-Qur:Jiin al-majid, 263. 111. It is this impermanence that reveals the relative and ambiguous nature of things. In the Aifiir, ~adra stated this point as follows: \"Motion, time, and the like belong to the category of things that have weak existence (r!aVat al-wujud). Accordingly, their existence resembles their nonexistence, their actuality is sim-ilar to their potentiality, and their origination (~uduthihii) is nothing but their corruption (zawiilihii). Each of these (qualities or attributes) requires the non-existence of the other; in fact, their existence is their nonexistence. Therefore, motion is the very destruction of a thing itself after it (is established in the phys-ical world) and its origination before it (is actualized in the external world). And this mode (of being) is comparable to the Absolute in the sense that all relational beings (al-ir/,ii:fot) have some sort of existence. Likewise, the existence of motion displays ambiguity (shukt\"ik) and similitude (shabah) (of being close to both being and non-being).\" Aifiir, 1.3 (37). 112. An allusion to the Qur~anic verse \"And every one of them will come to Him individually on the Day of judgment\" (19:95). 113. Nature as an inherent principle of change accounts for all primary and secondary motions, including external and forced motion. reduced all change in things to their essential nature, which enables them from within, so to speak, to move. He summed up his position as follows: ''And we are certain about the following conclusion on the basis of heart-knowledge (al-wijdiin), rather than discursive proof (al-burhiin): the cause that makes a thing yield and induces it to move from one place to another or from one state [of being] to another cannot but be an actual power inherent in that thing. This is called nature. Thus, the imme-diate cause of material [physical] motion (al-~arakat al-jismiyyah) is the substantial power that subsists in things, and all the accidents are subservient to the sustain-ing form (al-~urah al-muqawwimah), which is nature .... The philosophers have shown conclusively that every (physical body) which accepts the act of yielding (al-mayl) from outside has to have a natural inclination (may! jibiici) in itself. It is thus proved that the direct source of motion is something flowing with a continu-ously changing identity (mutajaddid al-huwiyyah). If this (substratum) were not to be something flowing and ever-changing, it would be impossible for these natural motions to emanate from it, on the basis of the principle that the ever-changing cannot emanate from the stable.\" Aifiir, 1.3 (65). 114. ~adra posited nature (tabicah) as the ultimate cause of motion or change in contingent beings because all other agents of change are secondary and come about under certain circumstances. Things change because it is in their very nature. Then the question arises as to how nature itself changes. ~adra's answer went back to his concept of wujud, which is self-renewing and self-generating with-out the need of external agents. In ~adra's words: \"The immediate cause of motion has to be something with a stable essence and continuously changing being (thiibitat"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"102 Notes al-miihi)!yah mutajaddid al-wujiid). As you will see, the immediate cause of all kinds of motion is none other than nature. This nature is the substance things subsist and become actualized as a species [as a particular entity]. This refers to the first perfection of natural things insofar as they are actual beings (in the external world). Therefore, it is concluded and established from this (consider-ation) that every physical being is a continuously changing entity with a flowing identity (sayyal al-huwi)!yah), despite the fact that its quiddity is impervious to change.\" Aifar, 1.3 (62). 115. God is the source of all change and permanence in the world, but this does not introduce change into the divine essence. ~adra reasoned as follows: God cre-ates nature, and nature changes by itself. Therefore, change in the nature of things does not lead to change and multiplicity in God. ~adra took motion in the ordinary philosophical sense to be a weak form of change and a unidirectional process. For him, nature, as the basic constitution of things, acts as a basis for both change and permanence. That is why he rejected motion as the best link between what is eternal and what is created and changing. Cf. Aifar, 1.3 (128ff.). 116. This and the preceding two paragraphs are a condensed summary of ~adra's concept of the temporal origination of the world (~udiith al-ciilam) and sub-stantial motion (al-~arakat al-jawhari)!yah). ~adra devoted considerable space in his writings to the first problem. for instance, Risiilahfi al-~udiith (Jfudiith al-ea lam) andAifar, 1.3 (244-50). For the problem of motion/change as a cosmological prin-ciple and ~adra's development of the concept of substantial motion, see Aifiir, 1.3 (69-113). For an analysis, see Kalin, \"Between Physics and 65-93."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Ashcari, Abil al-J:Iasan cAli ibn Ismacil al-. Maqiilfit al-isliimiyyin. 2 vols.
