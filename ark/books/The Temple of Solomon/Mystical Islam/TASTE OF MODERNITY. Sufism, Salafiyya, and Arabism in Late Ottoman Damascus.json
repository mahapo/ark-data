This SalafÊ ideal, though it has always been part of theMuslim creed, became the hallmark of religious reform in the latterpart of the nineteenth century as a reaction to the growing challengeof modernity. Through it, the reformist men of religion of that timesought to dissociate themselves from latter-day traditions, which theyhad come to regard as the main cause of the decline of Muslimcivilization and of the failure to establish clear criteria for the intro-duction of useful Western innovations. The SalafÊ trend thus em-ployed the model of the forefathers as a means to sharply criticizeboth the rigid scholarship of the #ulama within the established juris-prudential and theological schools and, even more so, the theosoph-ical meditations and ecstatic popular rituals of the sufis within theirvarious mystical orders. The political aspect of this model likewiseserved to censure the subservience of the #ulama and the sufis to therulers, which facilitated the drift of the Muslim states towards thepath of uncontrolled Westernization and obstructed the reassertionof the unique role of the Arabs in Islam.1Yet despite the increasing rigidity of religious learning, and theimmense spread of popular mystic practices, in the later centuries,the degeneration of Islam had never been universal. Moreover, withthe political decline of the great Muslim Empires in the pre-mod-ern era, there evolved among conscientious men of religion an evi-dent revival, aimed at consolidating Muslim society in the face ofgrowing anarchy and at reinstating the rule of the shari#a in its life.The leaders of this revival normally combined wide erudition (#ilm)with a deep commitment to the mystic path (taßawwuf). They thusconstituted part of a long tradition that in relation to the superficial#ulama who did not delve into the mystic thought and path, on theone hand, and to the popular sufis who neglected religious learn-1 For the ideas of the early modern Islamic movements see H.A.R.

Prominent among the later sufi #ulama be-longing to this tradition to appear in this study were AÈmad SirhindÊ,the founder of the MujaddidÊ branch in the NaqshbandÊ order, andIbr§hÊm al-Kår§nÊ, a central figure in the revival of hadith studies,in the seventeenth century, as well as #Abd al-GhanÊ al-N§bulusÊ, Sh§hWalÊall§h and Mußãaf§ al-BakrÊ, their successors in the followingcentury. These were joined at the beginning of the nineteenth cen-tury by the two most outstanding religious reformers of the pre-modern era of Islam, AÈmad ibn IdrÊs and Shaykh Kh§lid.2 As wewill see, in earlier periods the orthodox reformist tradition had in-cluded both Ibn Taymiyya, on whom the SalafÊs have generally reliedas the model of reformist thought and action, and Ibn #ArabÊ, whomthey have vehemently denounced as the archetype of latter-day sufidegeneration. The first Islamic responses to the challenge of moder-nity were formulated within this tradition.The fundamental approach of this book thus conforms to the viewthat traditional factors played an important part in determining thecourse of modernization in non-Western societies, and that theirmodern transformation should not be confused with Westernization,an all-out adoption of the Western model. This, however, is not todeny that modernity, or rather the various types of modernity, towhich Islam had to adapt itself under overwhelming political, eco-nomic, and cultural pressures from the mid-nineteenth centuryonwards, originated in the West. Here its major components, asobserved already by the founders of modern sociology, revolvedaround the three large clusters of rationalism, capitalism, and thebureaucratic state. Max Weber saw modernity as rooted in “Occi-dental rationalism”, the process of disenchantment which in Europeled to a disintegration of religious world-views and resulted in asecular culture. From this basic principle derived, according to him,the new structures of society which were marked by the differenti-ation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had takenshape around the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state2 For a general discussion of Islamic reform trends in latter-day Islam see FazlurRahman, Islam (2nd. ed.

Emile Durkheim, observing rationalism from a morepsychological point of view, added to the definition of modern manthe reflective treatment of traditions that have lost their quasi-nat-ural status, universalism of norms of action, and individualism.3Almost a century later, in spite of the growing postmodernist crit-ique, rationalism, capitalism, and the bureaucratic state are still large-ly regarded as the principal features of modernity. Alain Touraine,one of today’s leading French sociologists, while casting serious doubtson the ability of reason to guide society toward freedom and hap-piness, defines modernity as the diffusion of the products of rationalactivity: scientific, technological and administrative.4 In a similar veinhis British counterpart, Anthony Giddens, who has paid special at-tention to institutional developments, refers to modernity as a world-wide project of production and control, which includes four majorelements: industrialism, capitalism, the industrialization of war, andstate surveillance.5The same tripartite combination can be discerned in theories re-garding the formation of nationalism, the ideology that almost com-pletely replaced religion as the basis of identity in the modern West.Benedict Anderson, in his celebrated Imagined Communities, traces theorigins of the national consciousness to print-capitalism, later to betaken up by intellectuals who developed the concept of nation-nessbased on a common language, and finally to be crystallized by stateadministrations into the international system of nation-states.6 An-thony Smith, while attaching more importance to the ethnic originsof the national idea, nonetheless attributes its modern formulationto the impact of three revolutions: the transition to capitalism, thetransformation of military and administrative methods of control, andthe cultural and educational standardization.7The Western “project of modernity” has accordingly been exe-cuted by three major social forces: the intelligentsia which providedit with its underlying rationalist ideology at the expanse of tradition,the entrepreneurial bourgeois class which developed the capitalist3 Jürgen Habermas, The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity (Cambridge, 1987),pp. 1-2.4 Alain Touraine, Critique of Modernity (Oxford, 1995), pp. 9-10.5 Anthony Giddens, The Consequences of Modernity (Cambridge, 1990), pp. 55-63.6 Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread ofNationalism (rev. ed.

The inter-relationships between thesethree agents of modernity were not free from tension. The capital-ist’s interest in the autonomy of the market was incompatible withthe state’s tendency to intervene, while the Enlightenment intellec-tual’s criticism of the operations of the state challenged the officials’monopoly of rule. Nevertheless, due to the peculiar historical cir-cumstances in which it arose in the cities of Medieval Europe, thebourgeois class proved strong enough to take control of the state anddirect it in accordance with its own needs. Using the philosophicalformulations of the intelligentsia, which it also subsequently subdued,the bourgeoisie restructured the state as a legal-rational organiza-tion, which is bound to defend its borders against outside threats whileleaving to its citizens an almost free hand in pursuing their diverseprivate interests. The interests of the bourgeoisie were guaranteedby the constitutional system of government, in which it posed as thefavored representative of the civil society. Gradually throughout thenineteenth century, by the inner logic of both capitalism and con-stitutionalism, the political and economic privileges of the bourgeoisiewere extended to incorporate the whole of civil society, in what JoseOrtega Y Gasset forcefully described as the revolt of the masses.8This internal democratization coincided with the new external im-perialist drive, which by the end of that century brought almost theentire world under Western domination.9In the Muslim countries on the eve of modernization there wasno secular intelligentsia, no entrepreneurial bourgeois class, and nostate officialdom in the European sense of these words. In the Ot-toman Empire, as elsewhere, the intelligentsia was represented firstand foremost by the men of religion. Commerce and other urbaneconomic activities normally related to the bourgeoisie, albeit con-siderable, were largely regulated here by communal, corporative, andstate structures. The official bureaucracy, though elaborated, gov-erned the subjects of the Empire through the various regional, reli-gious, and functional communities to which they were affiliated ratherthan directly. Even more divergent from the European model were8 Jose Ortega Y Gasset, The Revolt of the Masses (New York, 1932).9 Gianfranco Poggi, The Development of the Modern State (Stanford, 1978), chs. 4-6.Intro.p659/19/00, 12:41 PM4"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"introduction5the inter-relationships between these three social forces. In the Muslimworld it was the state which from an early stage had gained the upperhand against the indigenous versions of both the bourgeoisie and theintelligentsia. Thus commercial activity, though clearly favored byIslam, was subservient to the political and landed interests of the mil-itary elites which had come to dominate the Muslim countries fromthe #Abb§sid period onwards. The Muslim men of religion, whosework was markedly rationalistic, were subsequently incorporated intothe state apparatus by the Mamluks, and more thoroughly by theOttomans, who created thereby a hierarchically structured religiousestablishment under the leadership of the Shaykh al-Isl§m.10 Thesedifferent circumstances of a decentralized state bureaucracy, a re-strained bourgeoisie and a religious intelligentsia, and their mutualrelationships, shaped the course of modernization in the Muslimworld. More particularly, my contention is that in striving to pro-tect Islam from the officially-sponsored Ottoman policy of Western-ization, reformist men of religion in the Arab provinces sought toforge an alliance with an emerging Western-bound local middle class.The state responded to this challenge by enticing this new class intoits apparatus and by mobilizing the masses as a weapon against itsreligious rivals. In this struggle also lay the Islamic roots of Arabism,as it drew these reformist men of religion away from the Ottomancentral government and closer to alternative indigenous foci of iden-tity. The conflict between an ever-increasing state authority, on theone hand, and an alliance between a recurrently rising entrepreneurmiddle class and a progressively radicalized Islam, on the other, hasbecome ever since a key factor in the inner political evolution of theArab countries of the Middle East. It remains so to this day.In this study I seek to trace the emergence of modern Islam from itsroots in the latter-day reformist tradition. I concentrate on Damascus,which during the nineteenth century became an important centerof the pre-modern reformist combination of #ilm and taßawwuf, whiletoward its end it came to play a pivotal role in the formulation anddissemination of the SalafÊ ideas.11 In fact, in the course of the last10 See especially Hamilton A.

The first of these was inaugurated with the arrival of ShaykhKh§lid in the city in 1823, which marks the starting point of myinvestigation. Kh§lid’s view of the Ottoman weakness of his day wasshaped within the framework of the Naqshbandiyya order, especiallyits MujaddidÊ branch, and within it he founded, as an organization-al tool to support the Sultan in regaining his strength, his own Kh§lidÊbranch. In the following generation he was succeeded by Amir #Abdal-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, the defeated leader of the resistance movementagainst the French occupation of Algeria. Selecting Damascus as hisseat of exile in 1855, #Abd al-Q§dir proved to be the most influen-tial interpreter of Ibn #ArabÊ in his time. He established in the cityan elect study circle that engaged under his guidance in adaptingthe Great Master’s teaching, the Akbariyya, to the reality of Euro-pean supremacy. His local disciples were mainly the offspring ofShaykh Kh§lid’s adherents. Most leading figures of the emergingSalafiyya, such as #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r and •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, wereshaped, in their turn, in the study circle of #Abd al-Q§dir. Later, inthe 1880s, they were to espouse in their own circles the teachings ofIbn Taymiyya, as a reaction to the political and religious policiesadopted by the heads of the modernizing Ottoman state.In the examination of the processes of continuity and changeamong the three major religious reform trends in late-OttomanDamascus, from the Kh§lidiyya through the Akbariyya to theSalafiyya, I employ two complementary disciplines.12 The first is thehistory of religious thought. My purpose in this sphere is twofold,the one to analyze the conceptual framework within which the ad-herents of each reform trend formulated their ideas, the other todetect the emerging of a special stress upon the rational faculty fromwithin the reformist tradition to which they all belonged. This ex-amination is based on a detailed analysis of contemporary religiouswritings, many of which have appeared from the 1880s in print. Themajor difficulty of such an analysis lay in the need to understandthese writings “from within”, from the inner viewpoint of the authors,which was rooted in the religious heritage of Islam in general, andfor most of them in the mystical experience of Sufism in particular.My principal vantage point in this conceptual analysis is, how-12 For a discussion of the problems and prospects in the research of the #ulama(and sufi shaykhs), the subject of this study, see R.

The concept of orthodoxy, the acceptedbelief and praxis, is applied in this study in a relative sense. It refersto the extent to which the shari#a provides the criteria of conduct,as against other dogmas and customs which, in the absence of a moresuitable term, might be designated as non-orthodox or popular. Aswe have seen, in the pre-modern period this concept was basicallysynonymous with that of reform. The Kh§lidiyya, the last traditionalreform movement in Ottoman Damascus, accordingly preached areturn to the path of orthodoxy. It was only with the dawn of themodern era that these two concepts began to denote different paths.At that time orthodoxy became identified with the official viewpointof the state, even at the expense of the shari#a, while reform turnedinto a quest to adapt the shari#a to the new circumstances by anessentially rationalist reinterpretation of the Islamic sources or bydirectly borrowing from the West. This distinction was blurred bythe tendency of the orthodox group to emphasize its loyalty to thereform efforts of the state, while the reformists obviously continuedto regard themselves as orthodox. In late Ottoman Damascus, thereformist tendency was adopted initially by the Akbariyya and then,more thoroughly, by the emerging Salafiyya. It was only at a sub-sequent stage that modern religious reform trends would turn againstorthodoxy, as was increasingly the case with the later Salafiyya underthe leadership of RashÊd Ri·§ and his colleagues in the first half ofthe twentieth century, and much more emphatically with the radi-cal Islamic movements of today under the inspiration of SayyidQuãb’s teachings.The second discipline I employ in this study is that of socio-reli-gious history. In this sphere I seek to chart the evolution of theprincipal reformist families of Damascus during the period under in-vestigation in general, and the two stages of their embarking uponthe path of modernization, the alliance with the incipient middle classand the appeal to wider strata of society, in particular. This part ofthe study consists mainly of an examination of the biographies ofthe leading #ulama and sufis of Damascus during the last Ottomancentury, mainly of the reformist families but also of their adversar-ies. The quality of this examination was largely determined by thenature of the biographical dictionaries of the city, which are exten-Intro.p659/19/00, 12:41 PM7"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"introduction8sive in their scope but incoherent and idealizing in their contents.13They therefore produce a complex and fragmented picture, render-ing the reconstruction of the social evolution of the religious reformtrends in Damascus as difficult as the “inner” analysis of the writingsof their proponents.My point of departure in the examination of the social backgroundof these reformist men of religion was Albert Hourani’s famous modelof “the politics of notables”. Relying on Max Weber too, Houranidescribed urban politics in the Ottoman period as a constant striv-ing of the city leaders to strike a balance between the two factorsfrom which they drew their power: access to political authority onthe one hand, and a social power of their own, based in the case ofthe #ulama on descent, control of religious endowments (awq§f), andconnection to the commercial bourgeoisie, on the other. This sys-tem, he pointed out, tended to divide the urban leadership, and itsreligious component, into two or more rival factions.14 In Damascus,as in Syria in general, Ottoman authority was always firmly present,while the power of the notables was also particularly strong. Towardthe middle of the nineteenth century, under the impact of moderni-zation, the division within the ranks of the city leadership, and par-ticularly among its men of religion, was perceptibly accentuated, cre-ating two distinct groups. One comprised those religious men whoseposition came to depend on their relations with the Ottoman cen-tralizing administration; the other included their counterparts whobecame more attached to the emerging local middle class. Thisdivision among the #ulama of Damascus thus constituted the socialbasis of their doctrinal split between orthodox and reformists. In thisrespect too the distinction was not complete. It allowed for a con-siderable degree of overlapping, and easy shifting, since all positionsin the mosques and schools depended, in the last resort, on theapproval of the Ottoman government, while the holders of senioradministrative positions normally served also as teachers in localreligious institutions. On the other hand, these distinctions did notnecessarily correspond to political affiliations. In fact, throughout most13 For a detailed survey and appreciation of the major biographical dictionar-ies written during this period see ch. 7.14 Albert H.

Moreover, whenin the last years of the Empire resistance arose against the intensi-fied centralization of the Ottoman government under the banner ofArabism, #ulama of both groups could be found among its ranks.The major contentions and methods of this study dictated a the-matic rather than a simply chronological structure. It is accordinglydivided into three parts, each devoted to one of the three principalreform trends of the period. The first two parts open with an anal-ysis of the basic teachings of the religious trends they deal with, theKh§lidiyya and the Akbariyya. The parallel discussion in the thirdpart is designed to identify the various sources of the Salafiyya. Inthe subsequent chapters of each part I examine the shaping andevolution of the #ulama families that adopted these reformist teach-ings, as well as of their integration into the larger contemporarycurrents in Damascus. In the course of this socio-religious discus-sion I continue to analyze the writings of their members, with spe-cial emphasis on the modifications they made in the basic teachingsof their trend in order to adapt it to the changing circumstances. Atthe head of each part I have added a review of the principal sourcethat inspired the corresponding reform trend: the NaqshbandÊ–MujaddidÊ order, Ibn #ArabÊ, and Ibn Taymiyya. In this review, asin the study as a whole, I have sought to stress the context withinwhich the activities and teachings of these sources were shaped, aswell as the changes that their legacy underwent through the ages.These introductory reviews are designed to locate the religious re-form trends of late Ottoman Damascus within the larger frameworkof the major currents of Islam, and thus to provide an Islamic “depth”for their understanding.As part of the larger process of the modern transformation of Mus-lim societies, the modernization of Islam must be viewed in conjunc-tion with the evolution of the two other factors that participated inits shaping, the centralized bureaucracy and the emerging middleclass. Seen from the Syrian point of view, these were the productsof the two major processes that in their interaction had determinedthe course of its history during this period. One was the attempt ofthe Ottoman central government to revive the Empire, beginningin earnest in the wake of the destruction of the Janissary corps bySultan MaÈmåd II in 1826.

In the case of the Ottoman reform, the latterrepresented the different, and often contradictory, conceptions adopt-ed by the successive rulers of the Empire—Sultans, Viziers and armyofficers—as to the nature of the required regeneration of its govern-ment and the desirable extent of borrowing from the West.

For these Ottoman reformers it was rather a necessarymeans to modernize the army of the Empire in order to ward offthe increasing European encroachment on its borders, and a usefulinstrument to centralize its government for a more efficient admin-istration of its inner resources. In adopting Western measures,MaÈmåd was careful to avoid the mistakes of his precursor, SelÊmIII. Reflecting the example of MuÈammad #AlÊ, his vigorous vice-roy in Egypt, his program of reforms was preceded by a ruthlesscampaign to eliminate all autonomous centers of power in his realm,both locally established rulers and rebellious agents of the centralgovernment. These he sought to replace with a new set of institu-tions staffed by men with some knowledge of Europe, primarily15 The following analysis draws on the major general descriptions of late Ot-toman history, particularly Bernard Lewis, The Emergence of Modern Turkey (London,1961); Niyazi Berkes, The Development of Secularism in Turkey (Montreal, 1964); StanfordJ.

In the course of these changes MaÈmådwas faced with two interconnected basic dilemmas which as anautocratic ruler he was unable to solve. One was that the more heasserted his absolute power, the more he became alienated from themainstays of his government, the #ulama and the Muslim popula-tion. The other was that the further he advanced with his reforms,the stronger became the power of the bureaucrats to whom he en-trusted their implementation to challenge him. These dilemmas werereflected in the occasional turns of MaÈmåd II against the men ofreligion who, mostly under NaqshbandÊ influence, supported his driveto reform,16 and against the civil bureaucracy that he himself creat-ed to realize it.17With the ascension of #AbdülmecÊd to the throne in 1839, the highranking #ulama were able once again to advance their views on thedesirable course for the modernization of the Empire. Alarmed bythe march of MuÈammad #AlÊ’s army on the capital, they had littledifficulty in bringing the young Sultan, who was himself given tostrong NaqshbandÊ influences, to pledge himself to put an end to thearbitrary rule of his father and abide by the shari#a. The promulga-tion of the Hatt-i Sherif Gülhane, the founding document of theTanzimat period, thus represented the last major effort undertakenby an Ottoman Sultan to revive the power and prosperity of theEmpire by a return to the Muslim ideal of the reign of justice.18 Inaccordance with #AbdülmecÊd’s pledge, the civil bureaucracy, nowunder the leadership of Mußãaf§ ReshÊd Pasha, was allowed a freerhand in pursuing the goal of centralization, mainly in the legal andfinancial fields. They were still largely unable to extend it to the16 Uriel Heyd, “The Ottoman #Ulema and Westernization in the Time of SelÊmIII and MaÈmåd II,” in idem (ed.), Studies in Islamic History and Civilization (Jerusa-lem, 1961), pp. 63-96; Butrus Abu-Manneh, “The Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyyain the Ottoman Lands in the Early 19th century,” WI, 22 (1982), pp. 29-32; andbelow, ch. 2.17 Carter V.

For both parties, however, compatibility with the sacredLaw in general, and loyalty to the Sultan and to the intentions heexpressed in the Gülhane Rescript in particular, remained the ulti-mate criteria for the adoption or rejection of such devices.The proclamation of the Hatt-i Hum§yån of 1856, which inau-gurated the second and final phase of the Tanzimat, was largely theresult of European pressure to define the Ottoman course of reform.Under its sway #AbdülmecÊd was compelled, against both imperialtradition and the shari#a, to promise the full equality of all his sub-jects, thereby marking the turn of the Empire toward the course ofWesternization. Concomitantly, the Sultan’s compliance precipitat-ed the ascendancy of the civil bureaucracy, his primary instrumentin dealing with the West. Led by #$lÊ Pasha and Fu\"§d Pasha of theyounger generation, this was able after the ascension of #AbdülazÊzin 1861 to consolidate its hold on the Sublime Porte and to turn itinto the real center of the government.20 For #$lÊ and Fu\"§d, there-fore, Westernization was not only the most efficient means to pre-serve the Empire, but also an ideological tool in their political struggleagainst the Palace. On the basis of the new rescript, these late Tan-zimat statesmen pursued the constant goal of centralization, partic-ularly through the reorganization of the millet system and the pro-vincial administration. These reforms were part of their largerscheme, propagated primarily by the extended school system, totransfer the loyalty of the subjects from the person of the Sultan tothe state, and from religious communal identities to an all-embrac-ing Ottoman nation (the idea of Ottomanism).21 The Westernizing19 Moshe Ma#oz, Ottoman Reform in Syria and Palestine, 1840-1861 (Oxford, 1968),pp. 34-38.

Itwas from among the latter, mostly protégés of ReshÊd Pasha whostill bore the NaqshbandÊ spirit of open orthodoxy, that the YoungOttoman movement emerged. Not averse to Western ideas as such,N§mik Kem§l and his colleagues countered the Porte’s authorita-tive imposition of the principles of equality and loyalty to the na-tion with their liberal counterparts which could be more easily recon-ciled with the shari#a, freedom and love of the fatherland.22In the wake of the successive deaths of Fu\"§d Pasha in 1869 and#$lÊ Pasha in 1871, the Ottoman Empire entered a period of insta-bility in which religious sentiment against their Westernizing poli-cies, and against European pressures in general, came to the fore.This sentiment was harnessed by the Palace loyalists, who under thedirection of the new Grand Vizier, MaÈmåd NedÊm Pasha, soughtto restore actual conduct of the state to the hands of #AbdülazÊz asthe Sultan—Caliph.23 To restrict the latter’s growing autocratic man-ner of rule, the protagonists of the late Tanzimat reforms, now underthe leadership of MidÈat Pasha in the civil bureaucracy and \\usey-in AvnÊ Pasha in the army, had recourse to the ideas of the YoungOttomans, their erstwhile opponents, suggesting a constitutionalregime and a federal organization of the Empire. The strugglereached its climax in 1876, with the military coup that led to thedeposition and death of #AbdülazÊz and to the convening of theparliament. The failure of the conspirators to restrict the preroga-tives of the Sultanate, however, allowed the new incumbent, #Ab-dülÈamÊd II, to exploit the first opportunity to prorogue it and fol-low the path delineated by his unfortunate predecessor.24the provincial reorganization in the Vilayet Laws of 1864 and 1871 see Carter V.Findley, “The Evolution of the System of Provincial Administration as Viewed fromthe Center,” in David Kushner (ed.), Palestine in the Late Ottoman Period: Political, Socialand Economic Transformation (Jerusalem, 1986), pp. 3-15.22 On the Young Ottomans see ”erif Mardin, The Genesis of Young Ottoman Thought(Princeton, 1962); Davison, pp. 172-233.23 Butrus Abu-Manneh, “The Sultan and the Bureaucracy: The Anti-Tanzi-mat concepts of Grand Vizier Mahmud Nedim Paâa,” IJMES, 22 (1990), pp. 257-274.24 Davison, pp. 261-end ; I.E.

To ward off theseparatist tendencies that were spreading among his Christian sub-jects, he also professed to cherish the idea that underlay the laterphase of these reforms, Ottomanism. At the same time, #AbdülÈamÊdwas determined to follow the example of his grandfather, MaÈmådII, in leading the modernization of his Empire in person. His owncentralized autocratic rule was buttressed by an expanded networkof communications, as well as by elaborate systems of espionage andcensorship. The solution he conceived for the two interconnecteddilemmas which distressed MaÈmåd, and the danger of which wasdemonstrated by the alliance between the civil bureaucracy and thereligious liberal opposition leading to the deposition of #AbdülazÊz,was a return to the old tradition of patrimonial rule. Thus to pre-vent the Sublime Porte from regaining its power, #AbdülÈamÊd sub-jugated it to the large group of personal protégés he assembled aroundhim in the Palace.25 To neutralize the appeal of the liberal religiousideas of the Young Ottomans, he fostered his image as the Caliphof the entire Muslim community, to whom obedience is legally or-dained, and patronized the popular sufi orders as a direct link to thecommon people. These related policies of autocracy, centralization,and populism were aimed particularly at Syria, the key to his Asi-atic provinces in general, and to the Hijaz, the source of his reli-gious legitimacy in particular.

Yet behind the consensus to restore theconstitution, #AbdülÈamÊd’s opponents were deeply divided as to themeans of realizing the idea of Ottomanism in an era of growingEuropean intervention and separatist nationalism. One group, ledby disgruntled members of the Sultan’s own family and elements fromthe ethnic minorities of the Empire, stressed the principle of equal-ity to be secured, with European assistance, through a decentralizedmonarchy. The other group, consisting of Turkish and other Mus-lims and loosely organized in the Committee for Union and Progress(CUP), by contrast, favored the creation of a unified nation undera centralist government of their own making.28 The army officers,who took the lead in the execution of the revolution, generally sub-scribed to the latter view. The successive challenges they faced oncein power, on the part of the Palace loyalists in 1909 and of the liberalparliamentary opposition in 1912, drove them toward an increas-ingly authoritarian military government. The continuous loss ofterritories in the Balkans, and the growing resentment against theircentralizing measures in the Arab provinces which precipitated theemergence of the Arab nationalist movement, led these officers toprogressively supplant Ottomanism with Turkish nationalism.29 LikeHistorical Perspective: Essays in Honour of Albert Hourani (Reading, 1992), pp. 8-26; EnginAkarli, “#Abdülhamid II’s Attempt to Integrate Arabs into the Ottoman System,”in David Kushner (ed.), Palestine in the Late Ottoman Period: Political, Social and Eco-nomic Transformation (Jerusalem, 1986), pp. 74-89; and below, ch. 4.27 Stanford J.

These tendenciesreached their climax in the First World War, before the final disso-lution of the Ottoman Empire.30The most perceptible result of the integration of the Syrian econo-my into the European-dominated world market from the 1830sonward was a growing deficit in its foreign trade balance, creatingan acute shortage of hard currency. This reflected primarily thedumping of the local market with cheap European cloth, whichseverely affected the textile industry, the largest in the country. Atthe same time, European interest in cash crops, particularly cereals,significantly increased their export from the early 1850s. Thesedevelopments had significant implications for the organization of theSyrian economy in general, and for the social order of Damascus inparticular, during the Tanzimat period.

Consequently,whereas the inner city notables were implicated in the massacre offoreign representatives and local Christians in the old city quarters,their rivals of the Mayd§n, who collaborated with the Europeanmerchants and their protégés, did their utmost to protect them againstthe mob.34The 1860 riots provided the Ottoman central government of thelate Tanzimat with the opportunity to intervene more effectively inthe expanding agricultural production of the Syrian provinces. Seek-ing to improve its balance of payments vis-à-vis the European fin-anciers, it made a determined effort to increase the area of cultiva-ble land and capitalize on the rural economy. Cognizant of the limitedability of the state to affect such changes directly, the Sublime Porteand its provincial governors sought to promote them by a multi-facetted policy. Firstly, in Damascus itself, they favored the Mayd§nÊfaction and other notables of the outer ring already engaged inagricultural production. Secondly, concerning the city—hinterlandrelationships, they encouraged cooperation between these agricul-tural entrepreneurs and the more established inner city faction, largelyto the detriment of the peasants.

Using this strengthenedposition as brokers between the state, the European merchants, andthe peasants, many notable families of Damascus, both old and new,were able to exploit the particularly high prices of agricultural prod-ucts in the world market of the period to accumulate large fortunesand, consequently, political power.35The decline of world grain prices from the late 1870s enabled thereinvigorated Ottoman Sultanate under #AbdülÈamÊd II to tightenits hold on the Syrian economy and direct it toward its own polit-ical ends. Unlike in Beirut, which could better accommodate itselfto the changing conditions of the world market, in Damascus, andin the other inland cities of Syria, the ensuing depression unleasheda new factional struggle. This was ultimately decided in favor of thosenotable families that were better placed to exploit two interconnectedmeans offered by the state to the urban leadership already in theprevious period. One was the Land Code of 1858, which allowedthem to invest their mercantile capital in land. With governmentalsupport they thus could capitalize on the growing hardships of thepeasants and establish legal rights over large landholdings. The otherwas the expanding bureaucratic machinery, in which they were ableto buy the high posts, primarily in the administrative councils. Thesethey used to build extensive patronage networks to control both urbansociety and the rural hinterland.

The beginning of this tradition isgenerally attributed to Yåsuf al-Hamad§nÊ, who in the end of theeleventh century migrated from Iraq, the center of classical Sufism,to Khurasan, establishing his lodge in Merv. Under his successorsthe activity of this chain of masters was farther transferred to Tran-soxiana, where it could enjoy the patronage of the QarakhanidTurkish dynasty. Hamad§nÊ’s foremost deputy (khalÊfa), AÈmad al-YasavÊ, the eponym of the Yasaviyya order from which subsequent-ly the Bekt§shiyya sprang, preached Islam among the Turkish tribesof the steppe. In the following generation, in the face of the declineof the Qarakhanid State and the increasing Mongol menace, anotheroutstanding khw§ja, #Abd al-Kh§liq al-Ghujduw§nÊ (d. 1220), laid inhis “eight words” and silent dhikr (recollection of God’s name), tobe discussed below, the foundations of the NaqshbandÊ path (ãarÊqa).A century and a half later, as Transoxiana was recovering from thehavoc inflicted upon it by the Mongol invasion, Ghujduw§nÊ’s pathwas revived by Bah§\" al-DÊn Naqshband, who accomplished thespiritual foundation of the Naqshbandiyya and gave it its name. Sh§hNaqshband (1318-1389), the epithet of MuÈammad al-UwaysÊ al-Bukh§rÊ, trod the sufi path under the guidance of two prominentkhw§jag§n of his time, but claimed to have been initiated into the ãarÊqadirectly by the spirituality of Ghujduw§nÊ. Under the latter’s inspi-ration he adopted the silent dhikr and the “eight words”, adding threeof his own. These roots determined the distinct path of the Naqsh-bandiyya as an elitist order that strictly adheres to orthodox tenetsand actively participates in worldly affairs. They also provided it witha measure of continuity which sufi orders normally lack. The branches1 The best introduction to the history of the Naqshbandiyya is Hamid Algar,“A Brief History of the NaqshbandÊ Order,” in Marc Gaborieau, Alexandre Popovicand Thierry Zarcone (eds.), Naqshbandis (Istanbul and Paris, 1990), pp. 3-44.

The task of consoli-dating and spreading the ãarÊqa was left, therefore, mainly to hissuccessors. Most outstanding among them in the early generationswas undoubtedly N§ßir al-DÊn #Ubaydall§h AÈr§r (1404-1490) ofTashkent, who in his activity embodied the political power inher-ent in the mystical principles of the Naqshbandiyya. For forty yearsAÈr§r served as the spiritual guide of the Timurid amir of Samar-qand, becoming thereby the virtual ruler of the country. He was alsothe first master in the NaqshbandÊ chain to spread the path outsideTransoxiana, dispatching his deputies westwards to Iran, Anatoliaand the Hijaz, eastwards as far as the borders of China, and south-wards to Afghanistan. From the latter, the Naqshbandiyya extend-ed by the end of the sixteenth century to India, producing the evenmore prominent figure of AÈmad SirhindÊ. SirhindÊ (1563-1624)regarded himself as the renovator of the second millenium in Islam(mujaddid-i alf-i th§nÊ) and founded his own branch in the ãarÊqa, theMujaddidiyya. His impact on the course of NaqshbandÊ history wassuch that most of its subsequent shaykhs, including Kh§lid, werecounted among the MujaddidÊ tradition. SirhindÊ was one of theleading opponents of the dÊn-i Il§hÊ, the syncretistic religion that wasdevised and headed by the Mughal Emperor Akbar as a means toconsolidate his rule over northern India. He was likewise averse toall manifestations of Hindu and Shi#i influence upon Sunni Islam.As against them, SirhindÊ strove to fortify the orthodox aspect of theNaqshbandiyya. The main thread throughout his writings, especiallythe large collection of his letters, the maktåb§t, is the stress on fol-lowing the sunna (exemplary conduct) of the Prophet and comply-ing with the precepts of the shari#a (the divine Law), as the twofoundations of the sufi path. Concomitantly, he emphasized the dutyof the NaqshbandÊ master to approach the ruler in order to lead himinto the straight path.22 For SirhindÊ’s teachings see Yohanan Friedmann, Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi: AnOutline of his Thought and a Study of his Image in the Eyes of Posterity (Montreal andLondon, 1971); Muhammad Abdul Haq Ansari, Sufism and Shari#ah: A Study of ShaykhAhmad Sirhindi’s Efforts to Reform Sufism (London, 1986); J.G.T ter Haar, Follower andHeir of the Prophet: Shaykh AÈmad SirhindÊ (1564-1624) (Leiden, 1992).

Again, it was the successors, fore-most among them his son, MuÈammad Ma#ßåm (d. 1668), who en-gaged in consolidating and spreading the order. Ma#ßåm foundedthe central lodge of the ãarÊqa in Delhi and ordained a large numberof deputies, in India and beyond. Two of them revived NaqshbandÊactivity in the regions incorporated by now in the domains of theOttoman Empire. The first was AÈmad J§rall§h Jåry§nÊ, nicknamedYakdast (d. 1704), who settled in Mecca and ordained numerousdisciples of his own among both the city inhabitants and the pilgrims.He was followed by MuÈammad Mur§d al-Bukh§rÊ (d. 1720), whotraveled extensively between Istanbul and the Arab provincial cit-ies, mainly Damascus, where his descendents established themselvesas a leading notable family, the Mur§dÊs. Here joined the order thecelebrated sufi scholar #Abd al-GhanÊ al-N§bulusÊ (1641-1731). InIndia itself SirhindÊ’s descendents yielded the conduct of the orderto Maíhar J§n-i J§n§n (d. 1781), who sought to adapt its path tothe new circumstances of the disintegration of the Mughal Empireby stressing the role of the shaykh as the spiritual guide of his com-munity.3 His more illustrious contemporary, Sh§h WalÊall§h, to whomI shall return later, was also a NaqshbandÊ adherent.

Although aspiring tofollow the sufi path as well, Kh§lid refrained from joining the localbranch of the Q§diriyya, the leading order among the Kurds at thetime. The search after more genuine spiritual instruction probablycontributed to his decision to perform the hajj in 1805, passing onhis way for the first time via Syria. During his stay in Mecca Kh§lidbecame witness to the Wahh§bÊ takeover of the city and here, as hehimself related, he received an indication to pursue his goal in In-dia. He set out on his way three years later and trod the path underthe guidance of Sh§h Ghul§m #AlÊ in Delhi. Recognizing Kh§lid’svirtue, the shaykh ordained him within a year in the highest degreeand assigned him the task of spreading the order in the Asian prov-inces of the Ottoman Empire. Kh§lid accomplished his mission withremarkable success, ordaining numerous deputies, many of them alsoprominent #ulama. These became active throughout Kurdistan, aswell as in the major urban centers of the Empire. Moreover, inIstanbul, some of these deputies took part in the events that led tothe destruction of the Janissary corps by MaÈmåd II in 1826, thushelping to open the Ottoman Empire’s path to reform.6Shaykh Kh§lid resolved to move to Damascus in 1823 in the faceof mounting difficulties in Iraq.

Kh§lid dispersed the deputies thataccompanied him from Iraq in some abandoned mosques of the city,turning them under his inspiration into active centers of prayer andrecollection. Most #ulama and notables of the city supported him,and many among them also took from him the NaqshbandÊ path.As Butrus Abu-Manneh has shown, Kh§lid’s success must be viewedagainst the sense of insecurity that prevailed among the inhabitantsof Damascus under the increasing oppression and violence of Syr-ia’s governors, culminating in the infamous rule of AÈmad al-Jazz§r.He alludes in addition to the constant threat of the Druze—Maronitearmy of BashÊr II, the amir of Mount Lebanon, and to the outbreakin 1821 of the Greek revolt, which arose religious fervor all over theEmpire.

The fundamental exposition of Kh§lid’s views, apartfrom his collection of letters, is to be found in the treatise that wascompiled by his disciple MuÈammad ibn Sulaym§n al-Baghd§dÊ,probably under his own supervision, in 1818.2 The thrust of this bookis largely polemical, and it is divided, accordingly, into three mainchapters: a general demonstration of the necessity of mastering theesoteric sciences; a biography of Kh§lid, supplemented by As#ad al-‘§Èib who edited and published this work as well; and a presenta-tion of the stipulations and practices that befit the adherents of theorder. These are introduced by a survey of the NaqshbandÊ chainof initiation (silsila) and fundamental principles. More systematic inits exposition is another treatise composed by MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ,the foremost Syrian deputy of Shaykh Kh§lid and the head of theãarÊqa in Damascus at an early stage of its development, in 1837.3This book too opens with an introduction to the NaqshbandÊ prin-ciples, and then proceeds to describe in detail its practices and formsof recollection. Later Kh§lidÊ writers generally rely on these threeearly works.The Kh§lidÊ sources, owing to the remarkable continuity in thecourse of the Naqshbandiyya throughout the ages, make no cleardistinction between the principles of the mother order, as it emerged1 Abu-Manneh, “The Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyya,” p. 12; As#ad al-‘§Èib (ed.),Bughyat al-W§jid fÊ Maktåb§t Mawl§n§ Kh§lid (Damascus, 1334 A.H.).2 AÈmad ibn Sulaym§n al-Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya fÊ $d§b al-•arÊqa al-Naqshbandiyya wal-Bahja al-Kh§lidiyya (Cairo, 1313 A.H.).3 MuÈammad ibn #Abdall§h al-Kh§nÊ, Al-Bahja al-Saniyya fÊ $d§b al-•arÊqa al-#Aliyya al-Kh§lidiyya al-Naqshbandiyya (Cairo, 1303 A.H.).1-1.p659/19/00, 12:43 PM29"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"chapter one30from the tradition of the khw§jag§n, and those of its ramifications,the Mujaddidiyya and their own Kh§lidiyya. Accordingly, and sincethe purpose of my analysis is to present the place of the Kh§lidÊ teach-ing within the larger tradition of the order as it developed up to theirtime, I employ in my analysis an essentially dichotomous terminol-ogy. The unqualified term Naqshbandiyya as used in the followingpages covers the original ãarÊqa, its MujaddidÊ branch, and the lat-ter’s Kh§lidÊ branch insofar as it followed its antecedents. The termKh§lidiyya or Naqshbandiyya–Kh§lidiyya, by contrast, is used mainlyin the discussion of those respects in which this branch developedits own features within the general framework of the mother order,thus justifying its distinct name. Alternatively, I use the latter termin those cases in which it is important to stress that the Kh§lidiyyadid adhere to the legacy of the Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyya.The Sufi RootsThe Naqshbandiyya defines itself as ãarÊqat al-ßaÈ§ba, the path of theProphet’s Companions, observing this root without adding or omit-ting anything thereof. Thus it constantly embodies the state of ser-vitude to God (#ubådiyya), which it regards as the sufi’s goal. This stateof servitude has two aspects: external and internal. Outwardly it isexpressed by strict adherence to the sunna, observance of the pre-cepts of the shari#a, and avoidance of innovations (sing. bid#a) anddispensations (sing. rukhßa); inwardly, by constant presence in God(Èu·år) through amortization (istihl§k). A parallel, though more per-sonal definition, states that the two fundamental principles of theNaqshbandiyya are the exact following of the Prophet (kam§l ittib§#al-nabÊ) and love of the accomplished master (maÈabbat al-shaykh al-k§mil).4 These are the two aspects that characterize its path: ortho-doxy based on religious knowledge (#ilm), on the one hand, andmystical quest through a master’s guidance (taßawwuf), on the oth-er. As an orthodox teaching, the Kh§lidiyya fully approves AÈmadSirhindÊ’s assertion that the mystic experience is subordinated to theprecepts of the shari#a and that if it negates them it becomes noth-ing but unbelief. As a sufi order, it endorses his view that withouttreading the mystic path (sulåk), leading to the purification of the heart4 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 14; M. Kh§nÊ, Al-Bahja al-Saniyya, p. 9.

On the contrary,from its viewpoint they are the two complementary aspects of thepath of the Prophet’s Companions.As a sufi order, the Naqshbandiyya stresses that it is incumbentupon every believer to acquire the esoteric sciences (#ilm al-b§ãin).12However, the Kh§lidÊ authors do not imply by this concept the spec-ulative truths revealed to those who attained direct perception of God(ma#rifa). These are almost completely absent from their manuals, sincein their teaching theosophy is superseded by Sunni orthodox theol-ogy. The Kh§lidÊs also do not mean by this concept the love of God(maÈabba), as in their path this constitutes only an expedient for thenovice.7 Out of a basic practical approach toward mysticism, theyregard the esoteric knowledge rather as the science of the heart (#ilmaÈw§l al-qalb), designed to elucidate the rules and the means neces-sary for the follower of the mystic path toward the Truth (ÈaqÊqa).Accordingly, the Kh§lidiyya explains the latter term as the realiza-tion (taÈaqquq) of things by deeds and their flowing from the shari#a.8Esoteric science is acquired by way of experience, by the mere tread-ing of the path, since mystic knowledge and practice are actuallyidentical. This science is divided into four principal branches. Thefirst two relate to the means to remove the faults of the heart (muhlik§t)and save it from temptations (munjiy§t), while the other two expandupon the manners of treading the path (§d§b al-sulåk) and the bind-ing relations between those who share it (mu#§mal§t).9 As part of thesame practical approach, the Kh§lidÊ writers devote a conspicuousplace in their expositions to the details of the various dhikr ceremo-nies, as well as to the moral conduct of both guides (murshids) andnovices (murÊds). The principles that underlie these rules, purificationof the heart from what is not God and spiritual training under aproper shaykh, are shared by the other sufi orders as well, thoughin the details each order follows its own method.Moreover, the Naqshbandiyya refrains from claiming that its spir-itual guides are necessarily superior. Thus the Kh§lidÊ authors of-5 Friedmann, pp. 41, 46.6 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 17.7 M.

Theseauthorities include not only Junayd and Ghaz§lÊ, whose loyalty toorthodox Islam most #ulama have recognized, but also the morecontroversial Ibn #ArabÊ and Sha#r§nÊ. The eponyms of the othermajor orders of Islam also figure in these writings, especially #Abdal-Q§dir al-JÊl§nÊ, AÈmad al-Rif§#Ê and Abå al-\\asan al-Sh§dhilÊ.Considering all the orders as essentially equal in their orientationtoward God, the Naqshbandiyya, out of the same characteristicpractical approach, views its only advantage over the rest in its ef-ficiency. Relying on its own experience, it argues that its path is theshortest and easiest way to reach spiritual perfection.10 This advan-tage, particularly stressed by SirhindÊ, is explained by the fact thatthe NaqshbandÊ path is inverted in relation to the paths of the oth-er orders. In these orders the novice strives along the path in orderto attract God’s favor and be able to faithfully follow His Prophet’sexample. The NaqshbandÊ path, in contrast, begins with the cast-ing of spiritual attraction (rapture) on the part of God in the heartof the novice (taßarruf wa-ilq§\" al-jadhba), and with the adherence tothe sunna and shunning of bid#a on the part of the novice who seeksto reach God. Those who enter the mystic path from the state ofdivine attraction, it is reasoned, will reach perfection sooner thanthose who enter the path without it.11 The NaqshbandÊ path beginsin the world of divine command (#§lam al-amr) and proceeds by de-scending through the mystical states (man§zil al-sulåk) to the worldof creatures (#§lam al-khalq), while ascending through the states ofdivine attraction (ma#§rij al-jadhba). In contrast to the other orders,the treading of this path is circular rather than straight. It beginswhere they end, since its beginning is enfolded in its end and its endis enfolded in its beginning.12These complex formulations ultimately imply that the NaqshbandÊpath is not designed for every Muslim who seeks mystical guidance,but only for the spiritual elite, those who are attracted to this guid-ance by force of the mystical inclination implanted in them by na-ture. Only those possessing such inborn inclination can experiencethe divine attraction before treading the path. It is a heavenly gift thatGod bestows upon whoever He wishes and, therefore, the endeavor10 M. Kh§nÊ, Al-Bahja al-Saniyya, p. 6; Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 9.11 Ibid., pp. 8-9.12 M.

The claimto represent the path of the pre-elected elite is expressed by the notionthat the Naqshbandiyya is the mother of all mystical paths and thesource of all their secrets and truths.13 Its spiritual precedence issymbolized by the fact, stressed especially by the Kh§lidiyya, thatin its main chain of initiation the first link after the Prophet is AbåBakr al-‘iddÊq, his direct heir, while in most other orders the chainbegins with #AlÊ, the fourth Caliph. Consequently, it is also calledal-ãarÊqa al-ßiddiqiyya.14 From the complementary external aspect, thereliance on Abå Bakr rather than on #AlÊ reflects the NaqshbandÊclaim to represent also the path of the orthodox erudite elite, thosewho interpret and implement the shari#a on the basis of the sunna.From here derives its sobriquet ãarÊqat al-#ulam§\". Historically how-ever, the origins of the reliance on Abå Bakr lay in the khw§jag§ntradition of Central Asia and, therefore, the non-orthodox Bekt§-shiyya adheres to it as well.15This inversion of the mystical path is the essence of the Naqsh-bandiyya. From it derive, and in it are reflected, the characteristicsthat determine the integrity and distinctiveness of this order withinthe general framework of the sufi current in Islam. This inversionshaped its organizational structure as a ãarÊqa; determined its closeaffinity to orthodoxy and to its bearers, the #ulama; and defined itsactive involvement in social and political affairs to facilitate goodMuslim life as delineated by the shari#a. These were also the foun-dations of its offshoot, the Kh§lidiyya, in the nineteenth century.The Organizational StructureThe Naqshbandiyya, like sufi orders in general, emphasizes that themystic path should not be trodden without the guidance of an ac-complished master. The knowledge and experience of the master,acquired in the course of his own spiritual training, is essential forthe seeker of the path (murÊd) in order to heal the diseases of his heartand overcome the seductions of his soul. In its practical instruction,the Naqshbandiyya urges the novices to be faithful to a single guide,13 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, pp. 14-15, 17.14 Algar, “A Brief History”, pp. 4-5.

In relation to his master a disciple should be, according to afamous sufi saying, like a corpse in the hands of its washer. Annihi-lation (fan§\") in the words, deeds, quality, and substance of the masteris a precondition to annihilation in God.16 Concomitantly, it requiresfrom its shaykhs exemplary conduct that befits their position and mis-sion. They must carefully examine the sincerity and readiness of thosewho apply for their guidance, to shun their money and signs of ad-miration, and always comply with the precepts of the shari#a.17 With-out the complete submission of the disciple to his accomplished guide,his efforts will be fruitless and the spiritual perfection will elude him.As another famous sufi saying put it: he who has no master, the devilbecomes his master.These general considerations are amplified, however, in the Naqsh-bandiyya, which, as we have seen, regards the love of the accom-plished master as its inner essence, externally reflected by the exactfollowing of the Prophet. Practically, the total obedience that thisãarÊqa requires from the disciples toward their guides serves as thefoundation of its inner organization. Observing the unbounded loy-alty of the novices to their masters in Kurdistan, Van Bruinessenascribed this phenomenon to the effect of the NaqshbandÊ form ofdhikr, which more than in any other order stresses the shaykh’s roleas an intermediary between man and God.18 In my opinion, thisloyalty is required rather as a result of the inversion in the Naqsh-bandÊ path, of the inclusion of its end in its beginning. Since divineattraction precedes here the treading of the path, the follower is likelyto encounter profound mystical states (aÈw§l) already at an early stage,before his annihilation in God (fan§\").

Regarding himself then as worthy of becoming a sufiguide, he acquires his own disciples that will go astray after him.19These dangers of the NaqshbandÊ path, relating to both the indi-vidual and the entire order, seem to be one of the important rea-sons for its emphatic orthodox posture, as well as for the central role16 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, pp. 82-86; M.

The adherence to the sun-na is designed to assure the rejection of mystical states that contra-dict the shari#a, while the love of the accomplished master is intendedto create full obedience toward the person that is capable of realiz-ing their true meaning and avoiding their misinterpretation. Natu-rally, only the master is entitled to confirm the disciple’s attainmentof spiritual perfection, which qualifies him to guide.The central role attributed to the shaykh in the NaqshbandÊ or-der is clearly discernible in two of the four methods it delineates toreach God. The most elevated and effective among these methodsis ßuÈba, the accompanying of an accomplished master who guidesby way of divine attraction. The effectiveness of this method derivesfrom the fact that the heart of the master is directly bound to theheart of his disciple and leads him to God without intermediaries.21The Naqshbandiyya distinguishes, accordingly, between shaykh al-ßuÈba, the genuine guide, on the one hand, and shaykh al-khirqa orshaykh al-dhikr, who guide through the sufi frock or the recollectionof God’s name, on the other hand. The latter two are regarded onlyfiguratively as guides. This distinction reflects the NaqshbandÊ cen-sure of those sufi shaykhs who turn their inherited frock or dhikrformula into a status symbol and a means to acquire wealth andinfluence.22 The method of ßuÈba also helped to bestow on the pathand principles of the Naqshbandiyya their remarkable integrity andcontinuity. It led NaqshbandÊs to display great respect toward theirsilsila, believing that through the uninterrupted contact between thelinks of the chain of spiritual guides, the heart of the follower of thepath is bound to the Prophet, and through the Prophet to God.23In the Kh§lidiyya, the second major method of reaching God, ther§biãa—binding the heart to the accomplished master and constant-ly preserving his figure in the imagination, whether he is present or20 Ibid., p. 5.21 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, pp. 86-87; M.

SirhindÊ regarded this meth-od as a connection of love on the part of the disciple toward his guide,enabling him to reflect his nature and lights even when he is faraway.24 Kh§lid, however, introduced in it a special novelty. Claim-ing that none of his deputies had attained the appropriate degree ofperfection, he demanded that all the Kh§lidÊ disciples raise in theirimagination his own figure, even if they have never seen him, rath-er than the figure of their immediate guide. This novelty was de-signed to turn the r§biãa into an instrument for the inner consolida-tion of Kh§lid’s newly founded branch of the order, as well as forthe imposition of his central authority over all its members.25Nevertheless, the fundamental NaqshbandÊ principle of the loveof the accomplished master, by generating, more than in the otherorders, excessive admiration and unreserved faith on the part of thedisciples toward their guide, harbors also a less orthodox dimension.Under the guidance of masters of lesser stature, and these consti-tute the majority in every order, these traits might easily degener-ate into saint worship, which by its nature tends to collide with thesecond fundamental NaqshbandÊ principle of strictly following theProphet. Moreover, some orthodox circles seem to have condemnedsuch complete submissiveness on the part of the disciples even whenit was directed toward a master with higher stature such as Kh§lid.Their arguments are echoed in the words of Baghd§dÊ, who wascompelled to admit that the practice did not always conform withthe shari#a. “This love [of the disciples for Kh§lid]”, he writes, “isa matter that springs from the heart and must not be judged byreason, although there is decisive evidence against it.” He tries to justify itby the deep respect that had been shown by disciples such as AÈmadibn \\anbal, whom he defines as the pious forefathers (al-salaf al-ß§liÈ),to their masters. Baghd§dÊ also sees no fault in the practice of kiss-ing the shaykh’s hands and asking his blessing.26 [my emphasis]The orthodox criticism becomes even more forceful when it is di-rected against the r§biãa, in the novel form it received in the handsof Shaykh Kh§lid, since here saint worship appears to be especially24 M.

Later on, the Salafiyya would use this practice as aleverage against the NaqshbandÊ claim of orthodoxy. In the time ofKh§lid and his immediate successors, however, the main oppositionto the r§biãa sprang from among his own deputies in the order. Theseraised two essential reservations, implying that it contradicted thetwo fundamental principles of the Naqshbandiyya. They pointed outthat the Prophet did not instruct his Companions to raise his figurein their imagination, and that this is an unfounded innovation in theãarÊqa as well.27 Unprepared to sacrifice the usual independence ofshaykhs within their orders for the sake of a more unified organiza-tion, these Kh§lidÊ deputies preferred to follow previous NaqshbandÊmasters who taught that disciples should bind their hearts to theirimmediate guides. Their focus on the inner—organizational dimen-sion of the r§biãa is evidenced by Shaykh Kh§lid’s rejoinder to thischallenge to his authority, his Epistle in Verification of the R§biãa.In it, Kh§lid stove to demonstrate that this was a customary prac-tice in the Naqshbandiyya, as well as in other orders and in the sufitradition in general. He felt no need to treat the more fundamentalclaim that the r§biãa contradicts the sunna of the Prophet.28The other two methods that the Naqshbandiyya delineates to reachGod concern the dhikr practices. The first is the unceasing repeti-tion of its formulas as dictated by the master (iltiz§m al-adhk§r), thesecond is concentration and contemplation (tawajjuh wa-mur§qaba).Together they constitute the practical expression of the inversion inthe mystic path of the ãarÊqa, as well as of the resulting paradoxesregarding its orthodoxy. The sufis make a distinction between twomodes of recollecting God’s name, the one uttered by the tongue(dhikr al-lis§n, dhikr jahrÊ), the other whispered in the heart (dhikr al-qalb, dhikr khafÊ). The second is generally considered as the moreelevated.29 Most sufi orders use the vocal dhikr, especially at the be-ginning of the path, when its follower is in need of external aids forhis progress. In some of them, he is required in due course to inte-riorize it into his heart. In the Naqshbandiyya, in contrast, the si-lent dhikr is practiced right from the beginning of the path throughto its end.30 The name of the NaqshbandÊ order is a reflection of the27 Abu-Manneh, ibid., pp. 297-299; Meier, pp. 172-174.28 Kh§lid al-NaqshbandÊ, “Ris§la fÊ Ithb§t al-R§biãa,” in ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid,pp. 72-79, and #A.

It is derivedfrom the combination of the Persian words naqsh and band, meaningbinding the imprint of God’s name in the heart of His seeker.31Naturally, the silent dhikr stresses the orthodoxy of the Naqsh-bandiyya, distancing it from the more popular forms of the ceremo-nies that are practiced among other orders, which normally includemusic and dance and at times also intoxication and physical pain.The dhikr formulas that the NaqshbandÊ guides inculcate in theirdisciples are generally the name of the divine essence (ism al-dh§t, All§h)or the first part of the shah§da (attestation), “there is no god but God.”The concentration and contemplation are also pointed at the nameof the divine essence.32 These, however, cannot conceal the fact thatregarding the form of the dhikr, the Naqshbandiyya too does not drawits example from the Prophet’s sunna. It was clearly influenced bythe Buddhist practices of Central Asia, its place of origin, as the“eleven words” of #Abd al-Kh§liq al-Ghujduw§nÊ and Bah§\" al-DÊnNaqshband, the underlying principles of the NaqshbandÊ sufi path,testify. They include the repetition of the dhikr formula thousandsof times, as with the mantra, watching the steps, and awareness whilebreathing.33The inversion in the mystic path of the Naqshbandiyya results inyet another paradox concerning its character and spread. On theone hand, this inversion implies, as we have seen, that the ãarÊqa isprimarily designed for the elect, those necessarily few upon whomGod has bestowed the inclination toward the mystical quest. On theother hand, it underlies its characteristic practical approach, stimu-lating many NaqshbandÊ masters to encourage as large an affiliationas possible to the ranks of their order.

Moreover, SirhindÊ believed that even novices that arenot honest and sincere should be given guidance, in the hope thatwhile treading the path they would amend their ways.34 Followingin his footsteps, Shaykh Kh§lid proved particularly attuned to theelite. Eager to attract those holding positions of influence to his order,he was prepared to be lenient even regarding their general duty ofrepentance as ordained by SirhindÊ. Kh§lid was severely attackedby his opponents for this attitude of favoring the office holders andwealthy people of this world and for accepting them into his ordermerely by blessing (tabarruk), while knowing that they have no in-tention of following the path. His rejoinder was that for some of themthis is the appropriate conduct (siy§sat al-irsh§d), since asking themto abandon the affairs of this world and give up their status as acondition for their acceptance into the ãarÊqa would cause them todespair of mending their ways and to shun repentance altogether.On the other hand, there were also the opposite accusations that heimposed the most difficult works on disciples from good families inorder to break their spirits.35The same lenient approach underlies the second central organi-zational novelty of Shaykh Kh§lid in the path of the Naqshbandiyya,the khalwa arba#Êniyya. In clear contradiction to the general opinionof the great masters of the ãarÊqa in the past, Ghujduw§nÊ, Sh§hNaqshband and SirhindÊ alike, Kh§lid referred the initial instruc-tion of the Kh§lidÊ disciples to his deputies, concluding it with a forty-day period of seclusion under his own concentrated spiritual guid-ance. In this way he was able to ordain a large number of deputiesand disciples much faster than the practice of ßuÈba would allow.These were dispersed throughout the Asian provinces of the Otto-man Empire and greatly enhanced the influence of the order.36Kh§lid’s innovation regarding the r§biãa may be seen, in this respectof sufi training, as a countermeasure, and a complement, to this34 M.

By it he sought to safeguard theloyalty of his deputies and disciples despite their swift ordination,which was not always sufficient to ensure genuine assimilation of thepath. It is noteworthy that, unlike the r§biãa, the practice of khalwaarba#Êniyya raised no serious objections among the members of theorder, even though its basis in the Naqshbandiyya was much weaker.On the contrary, it was willingly embraced by Kh§lid’s deputies, whothrough the swift ordination of disciples were able to enhance theirinfluence in their respective regions of activity.A third organizational novelty introduced by Shaykh Kh§lid inthe path of the Naqshbandiyya was “the closing of the door” (ghalqor ighl§q al-b§b). This instruction was originally given while Kh§lidwas still in Sulaym§niyya, after his Q§dirÊ rival, Ma#råf al-BarzinjÊ,had sent one of his followers to take part in his gathering and try toslander him before his disciples.37 More generally, “closing the door”was designed to prevent the presence of outsiders, who might de-ride the dhikr in view of the blatant manifestations of rapture thatusually accompanied it. This novelty was directed, therefore, not onlyagainst the orthodox #ulama who rejected Sufism, but also againstmembers of other orders, in which the divine attraction occurs onlyat the end of the path and is less pronounced because of their useof the vocal recollection. Thus the practice of “closing the door”helped to stress the unique character of the Naqshbandiyya amongthe sufi orders of Islam. It too raised no objections and was usedboth during the recitation of khatm al-khw§jag§n, the concluding prayerin the NaqshbandÊ gathering, and in the initiation ceremony.38The Affinity to OrthodoxyBy preaching to follow the sunna of the Prophet in the footsteps ofhis Companions, as the external aspect of its definition requires, theNaqshbandiyya casts into relief its ideal perception of the time ofthe forefathers (al-salaf).

On the contrary, this is the general preach-ing of the orthodox men of religion, those who follow the path ofthe Prophet and his Companions in every generation, and it is di-rected at their contemporaries who deviate from this path. Gener-ations differ from each other in the extent and strictness of follow-ing the sunna, and Kh§lid was of the opinion that in his time thedeviation of the Muslim community had become particularly severe,yet in every generation there are exemplary orthodox figures whofully realize this ideal. Thus Kh§lid generally felt no need to explic-itly state that he followed the path of the ancestors. The only occa-sion that he did so, in his theological epistle on the particular will(al-ir§da al-juz\"iyya), is an exception that proves the rule. Kh§lid’s stresson the way of the salaf in this case served to justify a deviation fromit as the need arouse. “For this poor servant”, he explains, “whosepath (madhhab) is the very path of the forefathers and whose way (ãarÊqa)is the very way of the Companions and their immediate successors,it was difficult to engage in what they interdicted. Nevertheless, seeingthat many confusions, errors, and inaccuracies had crept in concern-ing this most important religious question and source of many cer-tain doctrines, I undertook [to discuss] it following the example ofthe imam al-Ash#arÊ and the latter-day [theologians of the] Ash#ariyyaand M§turÊdiyya schools.39From the NaqshbandÊ point of view there is thus no distinctionbetween the sunna, the exemplary life of the Prophet and the wayof the early generations, and the shari#a, as elaborated by the jurists(fuqah§\") throughout the ages in the framework of the legal schools.The Kh§lidiyya emphasizes, in addition, that the sunna reflects alsothe Muslim faith (#aqÊda), as clarified by the #ulam§\" al-tawÈÊd withinthe theological schools. Accordingly, the NaqshbandÊs regard thefulfillment of the religious precepts in the manner prescribed in Is-lamic jurisprudence, and the acceptance of the dogmas as formu-lated in its theology, as the best expression of adherence to the sun-na. “The faith of our NaqshbandÊ masters”, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊstates at the opening of his exposition, “is the faith of the ahl al-sun-na wal-jam§#a”, namely the Sunnis, who adhere to the example of theProphet and the consensus of the community, “and their path is basedon maintaining the commandments of the purified shari#a”.40 Sim-39 ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid, p. 96.

Shaykh Kh§lid defined the #ulama as the guides of thecommunity and the transmitters of the knowledge inherent in thescriptures. Accordingly, he ascribed particular importance to the studyof fiqh, the science of the Law, and ÈadÊth, the science of the Pro-phetic traditions.

Seen from this pointof view, the shari#a constitutes not only the beginning of the sufi path,when the seeker is required to repent his sins, but also its end. Therapturous state of annihilation of one’s self in God (fan§\"), the goalof the other orders, is considered in the NaqshbandÊ path as a nec-essary yet dangerous state that must be negated (fan§\" al-fan§\") on theway to the state of subsistence in one’s self through God (baq§\"), inwhich he becomes protected from offending the shari#a.

Therefore, they do not per-mit singing and dancing (sam§# wa-raqß) and do not immerse themselvesin vocal recollection of God.48A particularly careful approach is adopted by the Naqshbandiyyatoward the subject of miracles (kar§m§t). While not denying theirvalidity, it emphasizes the quality of the saint as an #§lim #§mil, thereligious scholar that adheres to the sunna and shuns innovation, atthe expanse of his miracle-working. The NaqshbandÊs further main-tain that miracles occur normally to beginners in the path who needconfirmation, disappearing when they reach the goal and feel con-fident in their attainment. Moreover, rather than boasting of mira-cles one should be apprehensive toward them, since they often proveto be temptations and constitute the principal cause of disruptionto the presence of God.49 Hence, the Naqshbandiyya concurs withIbn #ArabÊ’s distinction between palpable miracles (Èissiyya), whichimpress the common people but might lead them astray, and spir-itual miracles (ma#nawiyya), which are longed for by the virtuous andare nothing but fulfilling the precepts of the shari#a and purifyingthe heart.50 #Abdall§h al-DihlawÊ, Kh§lid’s master, conveyed the samemeaning by distinguishing between miracles of the material world(kawniyya), the supernatural events, and those of the spiritual knowl-edge (#irf§niyya), being the constant vision and presence in God.51 Outof the same approach, the Naqshbandiyya warns against excessivefaith in the influence of the saint’s spiritual power (himma) over God’sacts. Replying to his follower #Abdall§h Pasha, the governor of Acre,who asked him to plea God on his behalf to grant him offspring,Kh§lid made a distinction between two kinds of divine decrees. Oneis a conditional decree (qa·§\" mu#allaq), which a saint’s intercessionmight revoke, the other an absolute one (qa·§\" mubram) that even aprophet cannot alter. Referring to saints who argued otherwise,Kh§lid maintained that these were in a state of intoxication and thattherefore their arguments must be rejected. In his view, a fault in aspiritual illumination (khaãa\" kashfÊ) is equivalent to a fault in a legaljudgment (khaãa\" ijtih§dÊ). Therefore, one must avoid denouncing the48 M.

In reliance on#Abd al-GhanÊ al-N§bulusÊ, they maintain that this refusal derivesmostly from those pretended jurists who lack real understanding.Accustomed to look for blemishes in the behavior of others and tocensure whatever goes against their opinion, even if it is only aquestion of interpretation, their only purpose is to become famousand to rejoice in catching others in their disgrace. The genuine jurists,by contrast, consider the precepts of the shari#a as general rules, andthey inculcate them in their lessons and preaching without mentioninganybody by name. Their hearts are removed from the affairs of theworld and their attention is directed mostly to their own faults. ThusAbå \\anÊfa and Sh§fi#Ê, the progenitors of the two madhhabs thatKh§lid particularly favored, are recorded to have said that but forthe scholars who were friends of God (al-#ulam§\" al-awliy§\"), He wouldhave no friends.53 From the NaqshbandÊ point of view, the sufis whodeviate from the shari#a and the #ulama who totally reject Sufismare the two religious currents in Islam that failed to combine theexternal and the internal aspects of the path exemplified for themby the Prophet and his Companions.Involvement in Social and Political AffairsThe historical course of the Naqshbandiyya was largely determinedby another aspect of the inversion in its mystic path, phrased con-cisely in the eighth of the “eleven words” of its founders in CentralAsia as khalwa fÊ jalwa, seclusion within the crowd. Mystically, thisprinciple reflects the deep concentration that the follower of this pathis capable of attaining, so that even in the company of men he spir-52 ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid, pp. 85-88.53 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, pp. 98-99.1-1.p659/19/00, 12:43 PM45"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"chapter one46itually continues to be present in God and absent from them.54 Thepresence of the NaqshbandÊ in God is constant and independent ofexternal circumstances, as the internal aspect of the order’s defini-tion indicates. He is inspired by the divine attraction from the out-set and is affected by the silent dhikr, which completely overpowersthe heart and leaves place for nothing but God. Among the mem-bers of other orders, by contrast, the presence in God occurs onlyin flashes, since the divine attraction constitutes for them the end ofthe path and because they use the vocal dhikr, which exerts less in-fluence upon the heart. Therefore, they must attain concentrationin God by their own powers, as well as by using additional devises,in particular keeping away from the company of people.There are two modes of khalwa. The first, external seclusion, is whenthe follower retires to an empty house and resides there, so that thecontemplation in the sphere of sovereignty (#§lam al-malakåt) and thevision in the sphere of might (#§lam al-jabaråt) will descend upon him.55[This is so] because if the function of the external senses is arrested,the internal senses are set free to contemplate the signs of sovereign-ty and to envision the secrets of might. The second mode, the inter-nal seclusion, is when a man’s interior is in a state of beholding thesecrets of the Truth (mush§hadat asr§r al-Èaqq), while his exterior isassociating with people (mu#§malat al-khalq), in such a manner that theexternal association does not distract attention from the internal vi-sion. [This sufi] is the absent present (al-k§\"in al-b§\"in). This is genu-ine seclusion, as God most exalted indicates by saying: “men whomneither commerce nor trafficking diverts them from the remembranceof God”.56 This mode of seclusion is peculiar to the NaqshbandÊ path.57Thus by this principle of khalwa fÊ jalwa, which constitutes anotherexpression of Junayd’s spiritual sobriety, the Naqshbandiyya stress-es beyond the other orders its members’ duty to take part in publicaffairs, associating with people. As we have seen, many of its mas-ters have been involved in the social and political affairs of theircountries, leaving their mark on their histories.

For him, the#§lim #§mil, the NaqshbandÊ definition of the genuine master, was onethat combined not only legal and theological knowledge with themystic path, but also religious knowledge in general with practicallife. This was, after all, the sunna of the Prophet, whose strict fol-lowing is the external definition of the Naqshbandiyya.As an #alim, Kh§lid based his demand for an activist attitude inthis world on the theological concept of kasb (man’s acquisition ofhis action). This concept constitutes the subject of his above-men-tioned treatise on the “particular will,” composed at the request ofhis disciples among the leading #ulama of Damascus.58 In this trea-tise, Kh§lid depicts the ãarÊqat al-ßaÈ§ba, and the Naqshbandiyya thatfollows it, as a middle course between predestination (jabr), whichresults in the fatalistic belief that man has no part in his actions andtherefore is also not responsible for them, and free will (qadar), whichimplies a limitation of God’s omnipotence. His purpose was to defythe prevalent opinion of his time that the Ash#ariyya, the dominanttheological school in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire,stood for predestination. He argues that the Ash#arÊ view in this matteris close to that professed by the M§turÊdiyya, the dominant theologicalschool in Central Asia and India, the places of origin of the Naqsh-bandÊ order and its MujaddidÊ offshoot, namely, that man possessespartial choice of his actions, the kasb. According to this view, thecreator of the action (al-kh§liq) is almighty God, but its perpetrator(al-f§#il) is man, who acquires the responsibility for it and is there-fore worthy of reward or punishment. In Kh§lid’s eyes, the maindifference between the two schools touched only upon the timing ofthe acquisition. While the Ash#arÊs claim that God and man partic-ipate in the source of the action, the M§turÊdÊs are of the opinionthat God created the action in pre-eternity and man acquires it atthe actual time of its perpetration as a compliance with or a viola-tion of God’s command.This activist attitude of the Naqshbandiyya toward public affairsmolded its character as a practical order, one which takes into ac-count human nature as well as temporal and local circumstances. Itshuns not only sufi practices that are incompatible with the shari#a,58 Kh§lid al-NaqshbandÊ, “Al-#Iqd al-JawharÊ fÊ al-Farq bayna Kasbay al-M§turÊdÊwal-Ash#arÊ,” in ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid, pp. 88-104.

In the NaqshbandÊ understand-ing, the Mal§matiyya embodies the principle of khalwa fÊ jalwa, toassociate with people in the body while being isolated from them inthe heart, since in this respect the outward activity of the master inthe crowd conceals his inner state of seclusion. Thus the adherentsof the Naqshbadiyya, and particularly of the Kh§lidiyya, can be mag-nificently dressed and well fed, reflecting the wealth that God hasbestowed upon them. Leaving no discernible indications as to theirreal identity, it is only their hearts that are permanently engaged inrecollecting God’s name.61 Conversely, the Mal§matiyya is definedas Abå Bakr’s sober Sufism (al-ßaÈw al-‘iddÊqÊ), which seeks the stateof the fullest subsistence in God by way of preaching and guidingthe people, and by taking part in the conquests of Islam.62Yet, this ideal of the Mal§matiyya harbors another of the para-doxes that checker the path of the Naqshbandiyya. The activism thatit requires from its shaykhs as a devise to conceal their sainthoodand secure their sincerity is ultimately nothing but spreading the orderand getting involved in the affairs of society and state. However, thisinvolvement in itself casts into relief their public mission, and is li-able to raise the suspicion that they are motivated by worldly con-cerns. It was particularly claimed against Shaykh Kh§lid, whosenumerous deputies were spread all over the country, that his fameas a spiritual master and guide sprang from his desire for leadership(Èubb al-riy§sa). This was the other side of the argument against thetotal submissiveness of his disciples toward him, mentioned above,and Baghd§dÊ’s answer opens with the same justification: this is amatter that springs from the heart and should not be judged by59 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 10; \\aydarÊ, Al-Majd al-T§lid, p. 13.60 M.

More to the point he maintains that a spiritual guide thatdelved into the sciences of both sharÊ#a and ÈaqÊqa is not allowed towithhold his benefits from the Muslim community at a time whenits life is permeated with innovations and temptations.63Indeed, the organizational novelties introduced by Shaykh Kh§lidin the NaqshbandÊ path were motivated by his profound feeling thatthe umma was in a state of serious regression, requiring a commen-surate vigorous operation of renewal. This feeling, as we have seen,was well founded in the political reality of the Ottoman Empire, andof the Muslim world at large, in his time. Kh§lid, like other con-temporary Muslims, regarded this regression as a result and reflec-tion of the community’s deviation from the path of the shari#a. In-asmuch as he paid attention to the increasing European penetration,he was confident, in harmony with the traditional Muslim attitudeof contempt toward the infidel countries, that it could take place onlybecause of the internal regression. From his point of view, therefore,the renewal of the Muslim world was tantamount to the return ofthe community to the path of the shari#a. In moments of despair,such as that which probably overcame him on his arrival in Dam-ascus in 1823, Kh§lid felt that nothing more could be done and thatthe end of the world would be soon heralded. When the idea thatthe mahdÊ was about to appear came to him, he sent his brother toanticipate him in the Hijaz.64 Nevertheless, Kh§lid’s sense of a mis-sion to work among the community and bring about its renewalalways prevailed. His acute sense of regression underlay the urgen-cy he attached to the rapid ordination of #ulam§\" #§milÊn, in bothmeanings of this concept. These would spread far and wide and guidethe Muslims under his leadership back to the sunna of the Prophetand the strict fulfillment of the shari#a, and consequently to stablegovernment and peaceful society. Hence, the Kh§lidiyya shouldultimately be regarded as an attempt that sprang from within thecivil society to organize itself in order to fill, at least partially, thevacuum left by the decline of political government.Adopting SirhindÊ’s view that “the righteousness of the kings andministers... is the righteousness of the people, and their corruption...is the corruption of all the subjects,” Shaykh Kh§lid lay the blame63 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, pp. 102, 115-116.64 ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid, pp. 190-191; As#ad al-‘§Èib, Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyyawal-Man§qib al-‘§Èibiyya (Cairo, 1311 A.H.), p. 55.1-1.p659/19/00, 12:43 PM49"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"chapter one50for the decline of the Muslim umma on its rulers.65 Nevertheless, forhim the idea that it is lawful to rise up against rulers who deviatefrom the straight path was inconceivable. He remained completelyfaithful to the traditional political attitude of both the #ulama andthe sufis, which depicted any resistance to the government as a sin.Instead, Kh§lid stressed the NaqshbandÊ teaching that it is incum-bent upon the #ulam§\" al-#§milÊn to seek influence among the rulersin order to guide them back to the shari#a. The purpose of his workwas, therefore, to reinforce the wielders of political power, as a meansto improve the state of the umma in general. On the other hand,Kh§lid’s reform was restricted to the traditional sphere of interestof the Muslim scholars, the shari#a. Again in harmony with the tra-ditional political theory of Islam, he regarded the implementationof practical measures to fortify the state as the prerogative of the rul-ers, through the ordinances they were authorized to issue, the q§nån.Thus in his letters to his deputies, Kh§lid emphasizes mainly theirduty to treat rulers with respect and pray on their behalf. Respond-ing to another request from #Abdall§h Pasha, the governor of Acre,he wrote that “prayer for Sultan al-Islam... and for the ministers,notables and princes, and even for the judges and jurisconsults, isamong the most important duties falling to the sufis, since the inter-ests of the country depend on them and the security of the subjectsis bound with their righteousness and correction.” The increasingoppression of the local governors in his time led Kh§lid to stressbeyond his predecessors this practical aspect of his guidance, argu-ing that the religious duty of the rulers to govern in accordance withthe shari#a includes the worldly duty to treat their subjects with justice.He warns #Abdall§h that the prayer of the sufis on behalf of rulerswill remain unanswered if opposed by the prayers of their unjustlytreated subjects.66The political aspect of Shaykh Kh§lid’s religious outlook must beseen, then, against the background of conditions in the Asian prov-inces of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the nineteenth cen-tury. His eagerness to attract to his order the local governors in theregions in which he was active derived from his aspiration to guidethem back to the straight path of the shari#a. These included Da\"ådPasha of Baghdad, WalÊ al-DÊn Pasha of Damascus, and the afore-65 ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid, p. 188.66 Ibid., pp. 244-245.1-1.p659/19/00, 12:43 PM50"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"the mystical praxis51mentioned #Abdall§h Pasha of Acre.67 Kh§lid’s interest did not stopin the provinces, however. He also sent a number of outstanding dep-uties to Istanbul, enlisting some of its leading #ulama and notablesin the order under the leadership of the Shaykh al-Isl§m, Mußãaf§#$ßim MekkÊz§de.68 Kh§lid’s awareness of the Empire’s decline prob-ably dated from the period of his formation in Iraqi Kurdistan underthe local B§b§n dynasty.69 But, in the main it ripened outside hishomeland, during the pilgrimage he made at the age of thirty. Onhis way Kh§lid could grasp at first hand the situation in Damascus,which was only beginning to recover from the tyrannical rule ofAÈmad al-Jazz§r, and in Mecca, which was occupied then by theWahh§bÊs. He seems to have been one of the first religious men inthe Ottoman Empire to intuitively comprehend not only the dan-gers inherent in these processes, but also the potential inherent inthe sufi framework of organization to check them. This primacy helpsto explain Kh§lid’s failure to find an appropriate spiritual guide inany of the cities of its Asian provinces, leading him to wander forthat purpose as far as India. The decline of the Mughal Empire pre-ceded that of its Ottoman counterpart by a century. At the time ofKh§lid’s arrival in Delhi, the Sultan was already under the sway ofthe British, and his realm had almost completely disintegrated. Here,therefore, he could learn from the experience of the indigenousreligious men, who beginning with Sh§h WalÊall§h in the first halfof the eighteenth century became aware of their regression andthought of ways to bring about a renewal. The strong sense of mis-sion that Kh§lid carried back with him from India as a NaqshbandÊ–MujaddidÊ master certainly derived from his desire to prevent a sim-ilar fate from overtaking the Ottoman Empire.The rulers that Shaykh Kh§lid instructed his disciples to pray forwere, therefore, primarily the Ottoman Sultan and his government,whose centrality in contemporary Islam was further emphasized bythe decline of their Mughal counterparts. Thus at the conclusion ofthe epistle he sent to his deputies in Istanbul concerning the r§biãa,composed probably after the outbreak of the Greek revolt in 1821,Kh§lid enjoins them “to pray constantly [lit. morning and evening]for the perpetuation of the [divine] assistance to the lofty Ottoman67 Ibid., pp. 108-111, 181-182, 188-189.68 Abu-Manneh, “The Naqshbandiyya–Mujaddidiyya,” pp. 23-24.69 On B§b§n rule in Kurdistan see Van Bruinessen, pp. 171-174; Edmonds,pp. 52-59.1-1.p659/22/00, 2:54 PM51"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"chapter one52State, the axis of Islam, and for its victory over the enemies of re-ligion.”70 These words allude to a special version of a prayer thathe compiled at that time to be recited at the end of the khatm al-khw§jag§n. In view of the prime importance of this prayer, I trans-late it here in full:God, protect our master the venerable and dignified Sultan, supporthim with the invisible armies and assist him in defending the land ofIslam. Grant him capable offspring to ever follow him for many gen-erations. Award his armies victory on the land and in the sea and leadaright his ministers, assistants and delegates.

Re-vive through him and through them the exalted and noble sunna, andelevate through him and through them the Prophet’s radiant mina-ret of the shari#a. Bring failure upon his enemies, since his enemy isthe enemy of the Muslim religion. [Destroy the Jews, the Christians,the Zoroastrians (majås) and the Persian Shi#is (raw§fi· al-a#§jim)].

Praise be to God, the lord of the worlds.71The wide range of elements that Shaykh Kh§lid considered, accord-ing to this prayer, as enemies of the Ottoman Sultan and Stateconveys the intensity of his sense of danger. Most of these enemiesare not specified by name, but their identity is not difficult to dis-cern. The defense of the land of Islam by the Sultan’s armies iscertainly directed, at least partially, against the external enemies ofthe Empire, the European powers that came to dominate increas-ing portions of its territory. By destroying the Jews and the Chris-tians Kh§lid meant, first and foremost, the members of these com-munities who were subjects of the Empire and lived within itsboundaries. His animosity toward them may have originated in hisyouth in Kurdistan, but in the main it reflects his recent rage at theGreek subjects of the Empire, who by their revolt against the Otto-man ruler lost their legal right to protection (dhimma).72 The hatredof the Persian Shi#is, and perhaps also of the Zoroastrians, was70 ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid, p. 79.71 Ibid., pp. 169-171.

In this usage Kh§lid fol-lowed in the footsteps of SirhindÊ, who in his treatise Radd-i Raw§fi·warded off the Shi#i assault on Sunni Islam in his time.73The internal Muslim enemies, however, designated as the inno-vating heretics and the accursed Khaw§rij in this prayer, posed inShaykh Kh§lid’s eyes an even greater menace to the OttomanEmpire. These were also the principal enemies of orthodox Sufism.By “innovating heretics” Kh§lid meant, in my opinion, the non-or-thodox Bekt§shiyya order, which in its mystic path integrated pop-ular practices, Christian beliefs, and deep reverence toward the #Alidfamily. The Bekt§shiyya was the ally of the moribund Janissary corps,and was outlawed by Sultan MaÈmåd II immediately following itsdestruction.74 The term Khaw§rij is directed, undoubtedly, at the ul-tra-orthodox Wahh§bÊ movement, which in the late eighteenth andearly nineteenth century openly challenged the Ottoman government,conquering the holy places in the Hijaz and terrorizing Syria andIraq. The Wahh§bÊs rejected the erudition of the #ulama as basedon blind imitation within the framework of the madhhabs rather thanon the Qur\"an and sunna, and even more so the practices and teach-ings of the sufis, regarding them as innovations and superstitions.Moreover, on the basis of these views they charged all Sunnis ex-cept themselves with disbelief (takfÊr), leaving their lives and proper-ty open to attack.75 Kh§lid’s letters convey concern at the advanceof the Wahh§bÊs, and it seems that he received regular informationon their movements through his net of deputies in Basra and Bagh-dad. He felt relief when the reports on their defeat by the armies ofMuÈammad #AlÊ began to pour in.76 The Bekt§shiyya and the73 Ansari, p. 20.74 On the Bekt§shiyya see John Kingsley Birge, The Bektashi Order of Dervishes(Repr.

On the contrary, the verytask that the Naqshbandiyya assigned to these religious men to guidethe rulers implied a position of distance based on superiority overthem. This superiority derived from their knowledge of the shari#aas #ulama and from their spiritual perfection as sufis, that is, fromtheir embodiment of the combination of #ilm and #amal. Shaykh Kh§lidseems to have endeavored to realize throughout his life this para-dox of working among the rulers while keeping distance from them,which constitutes the political aspect of the principle of seclusionwithin the crowd (khalwa fÊ jalwa). From the little information we haveon Kh§lid’s economic resources, it appears that he financed hisactivities from properties he held in Iraq and from contributionsreceived from his followers,77 while avoiding dependence on thegovernment and its offices. He was not so confident in the compe-tence of his deputies, whom he did not regard as #ulam§\" #§milÊn inthe full sense of the word, to work among the rulers without beingdamaged. His fear was twofold. On the one hand, these khulaf§\" mightsurrender to the temptations of posts and allowances and be attractedto the pursuit of worldly interests. On the other hand, they mightdevelop a sense of spiritual superiority that would corrupt their souls.In view of these apprehensions, Kh§lid repeatedly warned his dep-uties to be prudent in their contacts with rulers, and to shun themaltogether when their position was weak. Thus in a letter to thekhulaf§\" he left behind in Baghdad after leaving for Damascus, heurged them, in sharp contrast with his own manner, not only to shunrulers but also to reject office holders and wealthy people in generalwho wished to join the order for worldly rewards.78The religious awakening that was generated by Shaykh Kh§lidin the Asian provinces of the Ottoman Empire in general, and inDamascus in particular, in the first quarter of the nineteenth centu-ry was deeply rooted in the special path of the Naqshbandiyya.

In propagating this reformistcombination among the city population, Kh§lid tended to rely onthe Iraqi deputies and disciples that accompanied him. He could nothave been successful, however, without the ready acceptance of hisauthority by the Damascene men of religion. Many established #ul-ama in the city, who held senior posts in its religious administrationand in its central mosques, as well as the younger #ulama who ac-quired their religious status by their own merit, were among hissupporters. The various positions adopted by the Damascene #ula-ma toward Shaykh Kh§lid, and toward the orthodox principles thathe came to represent, were to last after his death, shaping their at-titudes toward religious reform under the regimes of Ibr§hÊm Pashaand of the early Tanzimat, when the traditional character of the cityremained basically intact.

The dividing lines between thekhulaf§\" were personal, normally within the framework of family lin-eages, and local, with little connection between the deputies of dif-ferent cities.1 In Damascus itself, where the Kh§lidÊ shaykhs stilltended to regard themselves as heads of the entire order, the split-ting was characterized by particularly deep animosities and bitterstruggles.The organizational development of the Naqshbandiyya–Kh§lidiyyain the last century of Ottoman rule in Syria, with both its successesand limitations, can be described on the basis of the fundamentaltension between the two principal novelties that Shaykh Kh§lidintroduced in its path, in the practices of khalwa and r§biãa. Appar-ent already during Kh§lid’s lifetime, this tension was fully developedafter his death, when his concentrated form of khalwa facilitated thefurther spread of the order while rejecting the centralist directionthat his intensified form of the r§biãa was designed to provide. InDamascus, this was exacerbated by a second tension between thedesire of the Kh§lidiyya to strike roots within the indigenous popu-lation, especially among the #ulama, and the foreign provenance,mostly non-Arab, of its shaykhs. The weakness resulting from thesetwo tensions for the organizational continuity of the Naqshbandiyya–Kh§lidiyya cast into relief a third one, concerning its relation to the1 On the development of the Naqshbandiyya–Kh§lidiyya in Syria see Freder-ick De Jong, “The Naqshbandiyya in Egypt and Syria.

Sufi orders, as De Jong pointed out, generally were able tosustain a measure of internal unity and central leadership only whenmaintaining a functional connection with the state.2 In the Kh§li-diyya, however, the attempt to create such a connection was proneto clash with the founder’s instruction to maintain distance fromrulers. The examination of these tensions in the path of the princi-pal Kh§lidÊ shaykhs in Damascus, against the background of thepolitical and religious history of the city in the last Ottoman centu-ry, can also clarify the ideas they developed to solve the most fun-damental tension of all in the teaching of the ãarÊqa. This was thetension between its orthodox thrust, which was so emphasized byShaykh Kh§lid and constituted its most distinctive feature, and itsmystical practices, which could serve as a bridge to the other, lessorthodox sufi orders. In the second part of this chapter I discuss theearly manifestations of these tensions among Kh§lid’s followers, afterhis succession arrangement collapsed and Sultan MaÈmåd II turnedagainst them.The Support of the Local #UlamaThe Kh§lidÊ sources stress that most of the #ulama of Damascussupported Shaykh Kh§lid in the four years in which he was activeamong them. This wide support crossed boundaries that normallydivided the local men of religion, encompassing members of all thelegal schools then practiced in the city, experts in all the sciencestaught in its religious institutions, and members of the various com-ponents in its social elite. Kh§lid appealed to these #ulama both ashead of an activist order that worked for religious and political re-newal and as an important #alim by his own right. Nevertheless, thissupport was by no means general, and for many others there is noevidence for any interest in his activity or for significant contacts withhim and his movement. Moreover, among the #ulama who joinedKh§lid themselves the motives, quality and sincerity of their supportgreatly varied. This diversity is a key to the understanding of the socialcomposition of the Damascene religious elite at the time.In the course of the eighteenth century, under the relatively sta-ble and prosperous rule of the #Aím family, the religious elite of Dam-2 Ibid., p. 599.1-2.p659/19/00, 12:45 PM58"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"shaykh kh§lid’s legacy (1823-1832)59ascus tended to increase its attachment to the Ottoman central gov-ernment.3 This “Ottomanization” was reinforced at the beginningof the nineteenth century, following the #Aíms’ decline, when thelocal leadership, and urban society at large, sought the protectionof the state against both its increasingly unruly agents, particularlyAÈmad al-Jazz§r and BashÊr II, and its emboldened rivals, theWahh§bÊs.4 However, an examination of the biographies of the re-ligious men in the city who joined Kh§lid after his arrival in 1823,as well as of those who avoided him, reveals that two fundamentaldistinctions should be drawn within the contemporary Damascenereligious estate. The first is the distinction between established #ul-ama, those who belonged to the older religious families of Damascusand inherited their status and positions from their ancestors, and up-start #ulama, who had entered the religious ranks by their own meritand effort. The second distinction is between #ulama who fulfilledvarious functions in the Ottoman administration in the city and thosewho served as teachers in its main mosques and colleges. This dou-ble distinction in fact creates three relatively separate groups of #ulamawithin the general framework of the Ottoman tendency that prevailedin Damascus at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and is thususeful in the analysis of the different attitudes they adopted towardShaykh Kh§lid. The first group comprises the established #ulama whoheld the higher administrative posts in the city. These tended toregard themselves as Kh§lid’s patrons, but the support they lent him,and his successors, was ultimately contingent on the general attitudeof the state toward the Naqshbandiyya. The second group encom-passed the established #ulama who occupied teaching positions inDamascus’ mosques and colleges. Their attitude toward Kh§lid wasdetermined largely by their familial and personal interests. The thirdgroup included the upstart #ulama who occupied similar positionsin the local mosques and colleges. These were inclined to accept thereligious authority of Kh§lid most unequivocally, since they were themost attentive to the plight of the Damascene population of the time,and the most articulate in their demands for the restoration of secu-rity and justice in their city.For the established #ulama who held the high administrative posts,the main attraction of Shaykh Kh§lid lay in the political implica-3 John Voll, “Old #Ulama\" Families and Ottoman Influence in EighteenthCentury Damascus,” American Journal of Arabic Studies, 3 (1971), pp. 48-59.4 Linda Schatkowski Schilcher, Families in Politics, pp. 36-40.1-2.p659/19/00, 12:45 PM59"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"chapter two60tions of his religious call. His importance in their eyes derived firstand foremost from his tendency to support the Ottoman centralgovernment against its unruly agents both in the capital, where hisadherents precipitated MaÈmåd II’s turn against the Janissaries, andeven more so in the Syrian provinces, where he was able to exerthis influence upon local governors, particularly #Abdall§h Pasha,Jazz§r’s successor in Acre. These #ulama were among the first to jointhe Naqshbandiyya, in some cases even through the deputies thatKh§lid had sent to Damascus prior to his own arrival. Their adher-ence, however, generally did not reflect an inner conviction regard-ing his teaching or a readiness to undergo the pains of the mysticpath, but only a realization that the religious path he propagatedcould help reinforce the central government, to which they were af-filiated. The two most outstanding figures in this group of #ulamawere \\usayn al-Mur§dÊ (1786-1851), the \\anafÊ mufti of Damascus,and \\asan TaqÊ al-DÊn al-\\ißnÊ (d. 1848), for one short period itsnaqÊb al-ashr§f (doyen of the Prophet’s descendents), and at anothertime, following a temporary disgrace of Mur§dÊ, likewise its \\anafÊmufti. Mur§dÊ was a scion of the principal NaqshbandÊ–MujaddidÊfamily of Damascus, which was founded by Mur§d al-Bukh§rÊ at thebeginning of the eighteenth century. He inherited his post from hisancestors, two of whom, as he must have well remembered, lost theirlives under the governorship of AÈmad al-Jazz§r.5 Mur§dÊ took thepath from AÈmad al-KhaãÊb al-IrbÊlÊ, who was sent by Kh§lid fromBaghdad, and probably had a hand in his invitation to Damascus.6\\ißnÊ is portrayed as a wealthy and influential notable, as well as agreat #alim who was generous toward the poor. He received the pathfrom Kh§lid himself.7 Shaykh Kh§lid had followers who enjoyed a5 On the Mur§dÊ family see Karl K. Barbir, “All in the Family: The Muradisof Damascus,” in Heath W.

The esteem of both groups toward Shaykh Kh§lid derivedprincipally from his urging upon the rulers to follow the shari#a andtreat their subjects with justice, as well as from his high rank in thesecond “wing” of the NaqshbandÊ path, his wide erudition in thevarious exoteric sciences. These #ulama took part in the receptionof Kh§lid upon his arrival in Damascus, but after he had establishedhimself in the city and his influence spread twelve of them decidedto pay a second visit and test his knowledge. Kh§lid, we are told,answered the complicated questions that each one of them had pre-pared in advance even before he could ask them, and they depart-ed perplexed, concurring that he is one of the great luminary imamswho combine “inner” wisdom with the “outer” sciences.9 Most ofthese #ulama joined the advanced lessons that Kh§lid gave in his homeon the various religious sciences—hadith, Qur\"an exegesis, jurispru-dence, and above all theology, in which he composed his epistle onthe particular will at their request.10Nevertheless, the impression conveyed by the Kh§lidÊ report ofthis episode is that the motive behind the decision of this group of#ulama to examine Shaykh Kh§lid was not just an appreciation ofhis extensive work but also a certain measure of apprehension aboutit. As the social and religious status of these #ulama was related tothe positions they held in the mosques and colleges of Damascus,the vigorous activity of Kh§lid and his deputies, the newly arrivedforeigners, in these institutions and the flocking of many students totheir cause could not but raise their anxiety.

These considerations, which affected mainly the established#ulama in this group, led some of them to deny their support fromKh§lid. Their upstart counterparts, by contrast, had no reservationsin acknowledging his preeminence and became his foremost disci-ples.The diversified range of attitudes, from enthusiastic support tocomplete detachment, that emerged among the group of established#ulama toward Shaykh Kh§lid was thus ultimately determined by theextent to which they felt threatened by his activities in Damascus.His most substantial supporters in this group were #Umar al-GhazzÊ(1786-1861), the Sh§fi#Ê mufti of the city, and #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-KuzbarÊ (1771-1846), the holder of its most prestigious teaching post,that of Bukh§rÊ’s collection of traditions under the Nasr dome in theUmayyad mosque. Both were already acquainted with Kh§lid at thetime of the encounter, and may have organized it in order to allaythe apprehensions of the others. The GhazzÊs were the leading Sh§fi#Êfamily in Damascus for centuries. Their heads took Kh§lid undertheir aegis soon after his arrival and married him to their sister,#$\"isha. Subsequently #Umar was honored to serve as the shaykh’sassistant instructor (mu#Êd), while his younger brother, Ism§#Êl (1792-1832), who was more politically inclined and held for a while thepost of naqib al-ashraf, became his intimate companion toward theend of his life.11 #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-KuzbarÊ held the title of theforemost hadith scholar in the Syrian provinces. His acquaintancewith Kh§lid probably went back to the latter’s passage through thecity on his way to the hajj twenty years earlier, when the two stud-ied hadith with his father. KuzbarÊ’s support of Kh§lid was likewiseof a scholarly nature, though he is also mentioned as a Q§dirÊ shaykhand as qualified to teach works of Ibn #ArabÊ.12 Their principal col-11 On #Umar al-GhazzÊ see BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 1133-1135; ShaããÊ, Raw·al-Bashar, pp. 188-190.

Be-sides Sufism he specialized in hadith, and taught the same collec-tion of Bukh§rÊ in the prestigious Sulaym§niyya lodge, for long underthe superintendence of his family.13 Likewise T§jÊ (d. 1848), who wasentitled the principal master of the Khalwatiyya–Bakriyya in theprovince of Damascus, specialized in jurisprudence, teaching it inthe Umayyad mosque and serving as assistant mufti (amÊn al-fatw§)of Mur§dÊ.14The position of the upstart #ulama in Damascus toward ShaykhKh§lid was much more unified. Many of these religious men hailedfrom the commercial circles of the city, which were particularly vul-nerable to the political and social afflictions of the time. This back-ground rendered them more aware to the consequences of the weak-ening of the Ottoman central government and more sensitive to theoppression of its local governors. The upstart #ulama engaged par-ticularly in jurisprudence, since they regarded the demand to com-ply with the Holy Law as the only means to keep the governors incheck. For them, Kh§lid’s orthodox teaching had therefore a par-ticularly strong appeal. A prototype of this group of #ulama was #Abdal-RaÈm§n al-•ÊbÊ (1770-1848), a descendent of a wealthy familyfrom #Ajlån in the south who at the age of fifteen renounced his sharein the family inheritance and came to study in Damascus. Distin-guishing himself as a scholar, •ÊbÊ acquired an equal religious sta-tus to that of KuzbarÊ and #Aãã§r as well as a teaching post in theUmayyad mosque.15 Another outstanding immigrant of this periodwas Sa#Êd al-\\alabÊ (1774-1843), who arrived from Aleppo in 1792and completed the group of the four senior religious teachers in thecity during the early nineteenth century. \\alabÊ specialized in bothfiqh and hadith, teaching \\anafÊ jurisprudence at his home andal-Im§m al-Musnid al-#Aãã§r AÈmad #Ubaydall§h al-#Aãã§r (Damascus, 1994), pp. 9-11.13 On \\§mid al-#Aãã§r see BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 462-463; ShaããÊ, Raw· al-Bashar, pp. 62-63; \\ißnÊ, pp. 646-647.14 On H§shim al-T§jÊ see BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 1575-1576; ShaããÊ, Raw·al-Bashar, p. 256; \\ißnÊ, p. 699.15 On #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-•ÊbÊ see BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 841-842; ShaããÊ,Raw· al-Bashar, pp. 142-143; \\ißnÊ, pp. 666-667.1-2.p659/19/00, 12:45 PM63"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"chapter two64Bukh§rÊ’s collection of traditions in the Umayyad mosque. For somereason, \\alabÊ did not participate in the encounter with Kh§lid, andis not mentioned in any of our sources in connection with theKh§lidiyya.16Historically, however, the most important religious men who joinedShaykh Kh§lid in Damascus were the upstart #ulama of the young-er generation. These founded five of the families that led the reli-gious reform trends in the city during the last Ottoman century—the BÊã§rs, the Q§simÊs, the ShaããÊs, the #$bidÊns and the Kh§nÊs.Their biographies must, therefore, be explored in some more detail,the first four here, and the fifth, who was the principal local khalÊfaof Kh§lid, in the next chapter. \\asan al-BÊã§r (1791-1856) was bornto a wealthy merchant family that lost its fortune during the gover-norship of AÈmad al-Jazz§r.17 His religious inclination was revealedalready in his youth, when he joined the Khalwatiyya order andstudied with the leading Egyptian reformist #alim of MuÈammad #AlÊ’stime, \\asan al-#Aãã§r, who stayed in Damascus in 1810-1815.18However, BÊã§r’s principal teacher, “from whom he benefited most”,was Shaykh Kh§lid, who initiated him into the Naqshbandiyya or-der as well.19 Upon concluding his studies the inhabitants of theMayd§n quarter offered BÊã§r a position as prayer leader of the KarÊmal-DÊn (al-Daqq§q) mosque. He tended to reject the offer, claimingincompetence, but after they turned to his teachers, and perhaps toShyakh Kh§lid himself, he concurred.20 The move to the Mayd§nproved to have decisive implications on the course of BÊã§r’s life, aswell as on the evolution of the religious reform trends in Damascusin general.

He stud-ied with ‘§liÈ al-DasåqÊ (d. 1831), who is depicted as the reviver ofreligious studies in the prestigious Sin§niyya mosque,22 and as oneof Kh§lid’s disciples. Too young to become a disciple of Kh§lidhimself, \\all§q took the NaqshbandÊ path from IrbÊlÊ, who afterencouraging the shaykh to migrate to Damascus remained to con-duct the khatm al-khw§jag§n in one of the local mosques.

KuzbarÊ’s patronage secured him a modest posi-tion as leader prayer and teacher in the southern part of the city.23\\asan al-ShaããÊ (1790-1858), the founder of the leading \\anbalÊfamily in Damascus during the last two centuries, descended froma wealthy merchant family that arrived from Baghdad in 1766,twenty-five years before he was born. Choosing the religious voca-tion, ShaããÊ studied with the principal #ulama of the city, as well aswith some of their senior counterparts in Baghdad and the Hijaz.From the latter he probably acquired his specialization, besides\\anbalÊ jurisprudence, in the sciences of inheritances (far§\"i·), arith-metic and geometry, whose study he is said to have revived amongthe #ulama of Damascus. Excelling in his studies, ShaããÊ received theteaching post in the \\anbalÊ prayer niche of the Umayyad mosque,as well as the superintendence and teaching in the B§dhura\"iyyacollege in the northern #Am§ra quarter, which lodged many of theforeign students in the city. On the other hand, he distanced him-self from political affairs and administrative posts, preferring to earnhis living in his family’s tradition from trade.

This authorization of talfÊq had becomeparticularly vital in these latter days, ShaããÊ explains, since otherwisewe would be obliged to declare that the worship of all believers isinvalid and sinful. Almost no one performs the commandmentsaccording to one legal school, and the common people cannot beexpected to know all the details of the law when even the #ulamafail to do so. As the aim of the shari#a is to relieve our burden, heconcludes, talfÊq is permissible when the need arise.25Like Shaykh Kh§lid, \\asan al-ShaããÊ emphatically rejected theWahh§bÊ movement. When the Wahh§bÊs sent him a detailed epis-tle presenting their argument that whoever seeks intercession fromthe Prophet or the saints and turns them into his intermediaries withGod is an unbeliever who should be put to the sword, ShaããÊ avoid-ed answering. On the margin of the epistle he wrote, however, thatoffences committed out of ignorance do not necessitate charges ofunbelief, and certainly not those motivated by good intentions.

In compliance withhis erstwhile teacher Ibn #$bidÊn passed from the Sh§fi#Ê to the \\anafÊschool, before pursuing his studies with Sa#Êd al-\\alabÊ. Thereafterhe turned to teaching, but soon his vast knowledge of \\anafÊ lawattracted the attention of \\usayn al-Mur§dÊ, the mufti, who nom-inated him as his assistant. Ibn #$bidÊn clearly surpassed Mur§dÊ inhis religious proficiency. He was considered the source of authorityin legal matters (marji#) in Damascus, and his opinion was sought afterby Muslims from other countries as well. A later historian describedIbn #$bidÊn as “the pole of the regions of Damascus and the pillarof the countries of Syria and Egypt”,30 and those who asked a di-ploma from him included #$rif \\ikmet Bey, the future Shaykh al-Isl§m in Istanbul, and MaÈmåd al-AlåsÊ, the prominent \\anafÊ muftiand Qur\"an commentator of Baghdad, a disciple of Kh§lid himself.His comprehensive legal compendium, the “\\§shiya”, which wascompleted by his son, is a source book for the \\anafÊ jurists to thisday and has appeared in numerous editions.31 Yet, Ibn #$bidÊn27 \\asan al-ShaããÊ, Mukhtaßar Law§mi# al-Anw§r al-Bahiyya li-SharÈ al-Durra al-Mu·iyya fÊ #Aqd al-Firqa al-Mur·iyya lil-Isfar§\"ÊnÊ Shams al-DÊn MuÈammad (Damascus,1350/1931), pp. 8-9.28 ShaããÊ, Raw· al-Bashar, pp. 64-65; idem, Mukhtaßar •abaq§t al-\\an§bila (Dam-ascus, 1339 A.H.), pp. 157-159; MuÈammad Kam§l al-DÊn al-GhazzÊ, Al-Na#t al-Akmal fÊ AßÈ§b al-Im§m AÈmad ibn \\anbal (Damascus, 1982), pp. 367-370.29 A modern source that summarizes most of the information on Ibn #$bidÊn isMuÈammad MuãÊ# al-\\§fií, FaqÊh al-\\anafiyya MuÈammad AmÊn #$bidÊn: \\ay§tuhuwa-$th§ruhu (Beirut and Damascus, 1994).30 BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, p. 1230.31 MuÈammad AmÊn #$bidÊn, Radd al-MuÈt§r #al§ al-Durr al-Mukht§r SharÈ Tan-1-2.p659/19/00, 12:45 PM67"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"chapter two68excelled Mur§dÊ also as a sufi adept, despite the fact that the latterwas the head of the leading NaqshbandÊ family in Syria. By his naturehe was humble and austere, and first became an adherent of theQ§diriyya.32 After Kh§lid’s arrival in Damascus, Ibn #$bidÊn asso-ciated with him and became his disciple in both the religious sci-ences, especially theology and hadith, and the NaqshbandÊ path.33The shaykh greatly esteemed his erudition, referring to him in hisdiploma as “the #alim whose merit everyone acknowledges and whois regarded as unique in his generation.”34 Ibn #$bidÊn, on his part,took it upon himself to defend Kh§lid when some of his deputies,who were expelled from the order following their refusal to accepthis innovation regarding the r§biãa, tried to slander him.35 Very closeto Kh§lid at the end of his life, he is said to have told him after theeruption of the epidemic in 1827 that he saw in a dream that thethird Caliph #Uthm§n died and that he, Ibn #$bidÊn, prayed afterhim in his funeral at the head of the congregation.

An examination of thereformist principles that are dispersed in his books and epistles willhelp us, therefore, to realize the nature of the tremendous appealthat Shaykh Kh§lid, and the NaqshbandÊ teachings that he propa-gated, had for Ibn #$bidÊn and for the #ulama of Damascus whoseviews he represented.At the root of Ibn #$bidÊn’s outlook lay his perception of the pre-eminence of the religious sciences, and of their bearers the #ulama,in the life of the community. Among these sciences jurisprudence(fiqh) held in his view the paramount place, producing God-fearingand piety in the hearts of the believers and leading to the otherbeneficial sciences. The phrase ålÊ al-amr—those in authority—in theQur\"anic command that we shall encounter more than once in thecourse of this study: “O believers, obey God, and obey the messen-ger and those in authority among you,”38 refers in Ibn #$bidÊn’sopinion to the #ulama. In this context he also quotes Ghaz§lÊ’s say-ing that “nothing is more precious than knowledge; the kings rulethe people, but the #ulama rule the kings.”39 This lofty esteem didnot prevent Ibn #$bidÊn, however, from observing the degenerationthat afflicted the religious sciences in general, and jurisprudence inparticular, in the later generations. “Know”, he writes, “that mostrulings of the legal scholars of our days are unreliable. These arecontent with considering one of the books of the later [scholars],particularly those that are unrevised... which, being merely summa-ries and abridgements, are replete with obscure expressions, as wellas omissions in numerous quotations and preferences (tarjÊÈ) for theless acceptable, or even for [rulings] of another school.” Moreover,when an error creeps into a quotation in a book of the later schol-ars, they copy it from one another without noticing it.40gel, “Autochtone Wurzeln des islamischen Modernismus: Bemerkungen zum Werkdes Damaszeners Ibn #$bidÊn (1784-1836),” ZDMG, 146 (1996), pp. 92-111; HaimGerber, Islamic Law and Culture 1600-1840 (Leiden, 1999).

This book was compiled in the customarymanner of latter-day writers as a supercommentary (È§shiya) on aprevious compendium composed by the seventeenth century Dam-ascene scholar MuÈammad #Al§\" al-DÊn al-\\aßkafÊ, who became theprincipal authority among the \\anafÊs of the time. Though Ibn#$bidÊn’s work is basically a collection of quotations from earlierscholars, his underlying tendency was not to accept blindly (taqlÊd)\\aßkafÊ’s rulings, but on the contrary, to examine them critically inthe light of the sources.41 In his numerous legal treatises, the reformistapproach of Ibn #$bidÊn was even more pronounced. These treat-ises reveal, moreover, that he did not accept blindly even the opin-ions of the founders of the madhhabs. By stressing the importanceof custom (#urf), generally considered as merely a secondary sourcefor legal rulings, Ibn #$bidÊn strove to validate decisions that thecircumstances of his time called for, even when these were incom-patible with the rulings of these hallowed authorities. “Know”, heexplains, “that many of the legal decisions made by the leading muj-tahid of the school in accordance with the practice of his days changedwith the passing of time, owing either to the spread of corruption(fas§d) or to the rising of a general necessity (·aråra).”42 Thus forexample, past muftis, going against the rulings of mujtahids from theirown school, had used these grounds to allow remuneration for teach-ing the Qur\"an or to acknowledge the coercive force of usurpers. InIbn #$bidÊn’s opinion, ruling in harmony with custom is, therefore,the correct way to emulate (iqtid§\") the method of the schools’founders, who likewise ruled according to the practice of their time,and not the blind imitation (taqlÊd) of their specific rulings, which inmany cases are no longer valid. Such emulation requires a particu-lar type of reformist #ulama, who combine a profound knowledgeof the principles of the shari#a with a comprehensive acquaintancewith the existing circumstances and the prevailing customs. This wasa totally different type from the superficial #ulama against whom hetook his stand.4341 Ibid., p. 8.42 Ibid., p. 47.43 Ibid., p. 49.

This practice seemsto have epitomized in his eyes the religious and social malaise thatafflicted Damascus in his time. After much vacillation, he resolvedto devote an epistle to this matter following an epidemic that brokeout in the city in 1813, when it became a fashion to provide specialallocation for such recitations in one’s testament.44 Ibn #$bidÊn wasafraid of the fury of the scholars who allowed such testaments,45 andperhaps even more so of the rage of the multitudes who found con-solation in them. Only the increasing spread of this practice, withthe encouragement he drew from an epistle that had been composedon this subject by the zealous sixteenth century Turkish reformistscholar MeÈmed BirgewÊ, which he read with his “brethren”, con-vinced him to compose it.46 His purpose was to demonstrate thatQur\"an reciting for the sake of profit was compatible with neitherthe principles of the \\anafÊ school, which considers asking remu-neration for fulfilling a commandment to be illegal, nor with therulings of the other legal schools, which declare reciting for a worldlyreward to be invalid and sinful. Ibn #$bidÊn regarded the expansionof this practice in Damascus with great apprehension. Turning thereciting of the Qur\"an into a source of profit and a profession ratherthan a pious deed, it threatened to damage the sincerity of the be-lievers’ religious feeling. By granting priority to the allocation ofmoney for this purpose over obligatory commandments, it also pre-cipitated the social disintegration of the community:Many of them do not spend a single dinar or dirham on alms. Theydo not perform the pilgrimage to the sacred house of All§h althoughthey are capable of doing it... They do not bequeath a single dirhamare likely to reflect the latter’s influence on Ibn #$bidÊn.

Thepermissible has become disgraceful and the disgraceful permissible.It is rare to find a person whose heart is attuned to God.47Ibn #$bidÊn was less confident in his attempt to explain this religiousand social deterioration. “The reason for this problem and for thespread of this plight”, he wrote, “might be the fact that most of ourwealth, or all of it, is attained in unlawful ways. These testamentsare an addition to the reprehensible things I have mentioned... Theircause is often hatred toward the heirs and relatives, with all the con-comitant evils such as the plunder of the money of helpless orphansand of poor and needy heirs.”48 Nowhere in his writings does Ibn#$bidÊn suggests how to remedy the situation.A similar practice lay, in Ibn #$bidÊn’s view, at the root of theeven more grave degeneration in the second aspect of the religiouslife of the community, its mysticism. This was the practice which hadbecome prevalent among the sufi shaykhs to ask for remunerationfor conducting the dhikr ceremonies. In this way many of them ac-quired unlawful wealth and caused no less damage to society. More-over, while in jurisprudence the degeneration derived merely fromthe rigidity that overtook the #ulama and drove them to accept blindlythe rulings of latter-day authorities, in Sufism it was reflected inoutright transgression of many religious precepts. Ibn #$bidÊn’s as-sault on sufi practices that marked a deviation from the shari#a wasextremely harsh. Singling out the mystic audition (sam§#), which“includes music, cursing, dance and going wild, the meeting withhandsome lads and forbidden singing that stimulate the passions ofthe young”, he declared that, “we set out against the vulgar people,the accursed offenders, who turn the dhikr sessions into a net tocapture this inferior world and to satisfy their wicked and base de-sires.”49Nevertheless, the degeneration of the shaykhs did not lead Ibn#$bidÊn to denounce Sufism in its entirety, just as the degenerationof the legal scholars of his day could not raise in his mind the idea47 Ibn #$bidÊn, ibid., p. 28.

In the same breathwith his denunciation of sufis that deviate from the shari#a he ex-plains that he does not mean the sincere sufi masters or those whotake example from them, taste their experiences, and find in theirhearts that desire for God. On the contrary, Ibn #$bidÊn’s inclina-tion toward Sufism, in its orthodox thrust, is clearly discerniblethroughout his writings, in which he often quotes both Ghaz§lÊ andIbn #ArabÊ.50 His attitude toward the latter is that one should believein his sainthood but not study his books, since if he is not familiarwith the particular meanings that the sufis attach to their terms hemight be driven to unbelief.51 Ibn #$bidÊn maintains that ÈaqÊqa, themystic truth, is the heart of the sharÊ#a, and that ahl al-ÈaqÊqa, the peopleof truth, are those who combine the sharÊ#a with the ãarÊqa.52 On therelation between them he writes:The ãarÊqa and the sharÊ#a necessitate each other, since the path to Godconsists of an external aspect and an internal aspect. Its externality isthe sharÊ#a and the ãarÊqa, and its internality is the ÈaqÊqa. The inter-nality of the ÈaqÊqa in the sharÊ#a and the ãarÊqa is like the internalityof butter in milk. It is impossible to reveal the butter in the milk withoutchurning it. The aim of the three—the sharÊ#a, the ãarÊqa, and theÈaqÊqa—is to fulfil the state of servitude to God (#ubådiyya).53The only explicit reference to the events of the time that I haveencountered in the writings of Ibn #$bidÊn, except in his treatise indefense of Shaykh Kh§lid, relates to the Wahh§bÊ movement. Heelucidates his attitude toward the Wahh§bÊs in the “\\§shiya” throughthe legal concept of the Khaw§rij, applying the same critical delib-eration that characterized his whole method. \\aßkafÊ had maintainedthat the Khaw§rij are a powerful group that rebel because their in-terpretation (ta\"wÊl) leads them to assert that the ruler (im§m) is ille-gitimate and must be fought against. They deem lawful the bloodand property of the Muslims, curse their wives, and declare that theCompanions were infidels. This last point, Ibn #$bidÊn claims, is nota condition for being a Kh§rijÊ, but only a part of the description of50 MuÈammad AmÊn #$bidÊn, “Ij§bat al-Ghawth bi-Bay§n \\§l al-Nuqab§\" wal-Nujab§\" wal-Abd§l wal-Awt§d wal-Ghawth,” in Majmå#at Ras§\"il, vol. 2.

Thus they allowed the killing of the ahl al-sunna and of their#ulama, till God most exalted broke their sway, devastated their countryand gave the victory to the Muslim armies... The legal status of theKhaw§rij according to the opinion of all scholars of jurisprudence andhadith is that of rebels (bugh§h).54Ibn #$bidÊn’s assertion that there is no fault in visiting the tombs ofsaints (ziy§rat al-qubår), and that this is indeed a commendable act,seems to have been intended as a defiance of the Wahh§bÊs’ out-look. He also approved of setting out to visit distant tombs, like thoseof the Patriarchs in Hebron or of AÈmad al-BadawÊ in Tanta, a prac-tice that in the footsteps of AÈmad ibn Taymiyya they specificallycondemned. Ibn #$bidÊn gave preponderance in this case to theopinion of Ibn \\ajar al-HaytamÊ, the celebrated sixteenth centuryjurist, who in his collection of fatwas wrote that one should not avoidvisiting tombs because of the improper and corrupt deeds that areperpetrated there. He must visit the holy tomb and condemn thoseinnovations, and, if it is in his power, also remove them.55The comparison between the teachings of MuÈammad AmÊn#$bidÊn and the Kh§lidÊ expositions indicates how broad was thecommon ground between him and Shaykh Kh§lid. Like Kh§lid, Ibn#$bidÊn sought, though from the standpoint of the legal scholar, tocombine an orthodoxy that is responsive to the afflictions of the timeand a Sufism that is bound by the shari#a. In his eyes too, the standingof the #ulama, as the bearers of religious knowledge, was superior tothat of rulers. Ibn #$bidÊn, like Kh§lid, was impelled by an acuteperception of a religious and social degeneration in the conditionand morale of the umma, and by a firm conviction that its reformis contingent upon a return to the path of the shari#a. Like him, heregarded the Wahh§bÊ movement as a menace to Islam and rejoicedin its destruction. The explanation of the enormous appeal thatShaykh Kh§lid had in the eyes of Ibn #$bidÊn, and of the reformist-inclined #ulama of Damascus, was not therefore in the details of his54 Ibid., p. 309.55 Ibid., vol. 1, p. 604.1-2.p659/19/00, 12:45 PM74"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"shaykh kh§lid’s legacy (1823-1832)75teaching, but rather in the vision he provided them as a NaqshbandÊmaster. These local #ulama could find in Kh§lid’s teaching a com-prehensive politico-religious outlook with which to analyze the af-flictions of their society and to delineate the required ways to regen-erate it. Moreover, in the manner in which Kh§lid conducted hisorder he embodied for them the ideal of the religious man whoactively strives toward such a renewal. An echo of that appreciationfor his work is found in MuÈammad AmÊn #$bidÊn’s introductionto his defense of “the great imam, my honorable master ShaykhKh§lid, who became the pole of the sufis (quãb al-#§rifÊn) in all theMuslim countries and spread the NaqshbandÊ path. He received theconfidence of all, including the notables of the Ottoman State, onthe right of the great Caliph, who fortified the foundations of religion,destroyed the armies of the infidels, defended the land of Islam andthe Muslims, and hoisted the banner of the laws and rulings with thehelp of this great imam.”56The Collapse of the Succession ArrangementThe first fissures in the integrity of the Kh§lidiyya became appar-ent already in the first weeks following Shaykh Kh§lid’s demise inthe epidemic that broke out in Damascus in 1827. Striking many ofthe principal deputies who accompanied Kh§lid from Iraq as well,this epidemic shattered the succession arrangement that he had de-vised, and aroused controversies and conflicts between those amongthem who survived. The historical question as to the content of thearrangement and the extent to which it was ever implemented byhis successors is further compounded by the role it came to play inthe renewed struggle over the leadership of the order in Damascusunder the regime of #AbdülÈamÊd II. This struggle was waged be-tween two local branches, one consisting of the Kh§nÊ family whichled the order in the city during the nineteenth century, the other ofKh§lid’s nephew, As#ad al-‘§Èib, who challenged the leadership ofthe Kh§nÊs toward the end of that century. Most of the sources wepossess concerning the succession problem were written in this laterperiod by members of the two contending branches, or in relationto the conflict between them, and must therefore be treated with great56 Ibn #$bidÊn, Sall al-\\us§m, pp. 2-3, my emphases.1-2.p659/19/00, 12:45 PM75"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"chapter two76caution. Nevertheless, we do have one treatise that is devoted in itsentirety to the last days of Kh§lid and the first weeks after his death,written very close to the events themselves by his brother-in-law andassociate, Ism§#Êl al-GhazzÊ.57 This book seems to have served as akind of official version of the ãarÊqa, as it crystallized in the wake ofthe resolution of its first organizational crisis.Shaykh Kh§lid was much troubled by the question of the succes-sion to his leadership of the order. Confronted with growing diffi-culties in controlling the large number of deputies he ordainedthrough the concentrated khalwa, ominously surfacing in the chal-lenge that many of them imposed on him regarding his complemen-tary intensified r§biãa, Kh§lid realized that announcing his succes-sor would further impair the integrity of the ãarÊqa. This was perhapsanother reason for his assertion that none of his followers had at-tained the appropriate degree of perfection. He was obliged to reacha decision, however, when the epidemic that erupted in Damascusawakened his apprehension that his end was imminent. Accordingto the testimony of GhazzÊ, Kh§lid summoned him at that time andenumerated before him four consecutive deputies who were to headthe order, and also to be trustees of his children and library, afterhis death. The first among them was Ism§#Êl al-An§r§nÊ, Kh§lid’sforemost disciple; following him were two other deputies that hadaccompanied the shaykh from Iraq; and lastly came Ism§#Êl al-GhazzÊhimself.58 The latter’s inclusion in the list seems suspicious since, asrightly commented by As#ad al-‘§Èib, he was not regarded as adeputy at all, and it is unlikely that Kh§lid would have nominatedhim in preference to genuine khulaf§\".59 After Kh§lid fell ill he as-sembled his deputies and senior adherents in Damascus and disclosedhis decision to them. At that farewell meeting he stressed for the lasttime the importance of preserving the integrity of the Kh§lidiyya alsoafter his death. He declared An§r§nÊ to have authority over the otherdeputies, warning that anyone who opposed him would be expelledfrom the order.6057 Ism§#Êl al-GhazzÊ, \\ußål al-Uns fÊ Intiq§l \\a·rat Mawl§n§ Kh§lid ila \\aíÊrat al-Quds (Damascus, 1970).58 Ibid., p. 43.

Nevertheless, when he himself, as well as the two follow-ing successors designed by Kh§lid, were also infected a mere twoweeks later, the succession arrangement completely collapsed.An§r§nÊ, feeling that his end was near, decided to assemble thedeputies and principal adherents once more for consultation con-cerning the new candidate to head the ãarÊqa. Soon a sharp disputebroke out among those present, each regarding himself as the mostsuitable to undertake the position. The solution to the ensuing crisiswas finally hammered out by Ism§#Êl al-GhazzÊ. Instead of propos-ing himself as successor, as his report on Kh§lid’s testament impliedhe should, GhazzÊ told An§r§nÊ of a second will that the shaykh hadhanded him before departing on the pilgrimage in 1825, in whichhe ordained #Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ (HarawÊ) as An§r§nÊ’s successor, onlythen to be succeeded by the other three. The fact that GhazzÊ pre-sented himself as the only witness to this will, while An§r§nÊ was com-pletely unaware of it, makes its existence highly doubtful.

Kh§lid nominated him as head of his lodge inSulaym§niyya, where he was in charge of the material needs of theshaykh and the brethren.63 Later, when Kh§lid left for Syria, Her§tÊremained behind to supervise his properties in Iraq. Upon receiv-ing the news of his appointment by An§r§nÊ to head the order,#Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ departed to Damascus in order to undertake thetask. As the last residence of Kh§lid, and the main concentration ofhis closest khulaf§\", Her§tÊ knew that to preserve the integrity of theKh§lidiyya it was imperative that its leadership should stay in thatcity. He also certainly hoped to continue to enjoy the wide supportof the local #ulama in the ãarÊqa. In complete loyalty to the path ofKh§lid, Her§tÊ soon engaged in instructing the advanced novices,conducting the khatm al-khw§jag§n, and sending deputies to otherregions of the Ottoman Empire. By force of his position in the or-der he also served as the guardian of Kh§lid’s widow and son, towhom he attended with much care.64Sultan MaÈmåd II’s Turn against the Kh§lidiyyaThe activities of #Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ were interrupted not long af-ter he undertook the leadership of the Kh§lidiyya in Damascus. InApril 1828, less than a year after Shaykh Kh§lid’s demise, SultanMaÈmåd II sent an imperial decree to the governor of Damascusto expel him, together with all other members of the ãarÊqa who didnot originate from the province, back to Iraq. The governor ofBaghdad received a parallel decree to ensure that after their arrivalthe Kh§lidÊs would not return to Syria, and that they should dispatchno deputy to Istanbul or to any other city of the Ottoman Empire.65Her§tÊ was thus obliged to leave Syria, taking with him Kh§lid’sfamily. At first he stayed in Baghdad, but subsequently he was al-lowed to return to Sulaym§niyya.66MaÈmåd II justified the decree to expel the foreign Kh§lidÊs fromDamascus by the claim that two deputies sent by #Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ63 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 69.64 #A.

This last expression implies that the roots of theSultan’s aversion to the Kh§lidiyya lay back in the time of ShaykhKh§lid himself. In the eyes of MaÈmåd II, the very activism of theNaqshbandiyya, and the orthodox revival which it sought to gener-ate, constituted a threat to the autocratic rule which he strove toimpose on his Empire. Already at the beginning of the 1820s, asKh§lid’s first emissaries began to spread the order in Istanbul,MaÈmåd banished some of them from the city, and when hostileAleppine shaykhs warned him against the rising influence of Kh§lidin Syria, he planned a vigorous attack on him. Submitting to theadvice of Shaykh al-Isl§m, Mußãaf§ #$ßÊm MekkÊz§de, who wasKh§lid’s adherent, the Sultan was finally persuaded to content himselfwith sending two secret agents to report on the Shaykh’s activity.67On the other hand, MaÈmåd II soon realized that the same acti-vism of the Naqshbandiyya, and its general orthodox attitude, werebent to support the central government against its rebellious agents.He did not hesitate to exploit this bent in fortifying his centralist rule,as the events that led to the destruction of the Janissary corps, thearmy that more than any other force in the Empire challenged hisauthority, clearly demonstrated.The ambivalent attitude of MaÈmåd II toward the activity of theKh§lidÊs in the Ottoman Empire was analogous to the ambivalencethat underlay the political aspect of the teaching of the Naqsh-bandiyya, which determined their attitude toward him. ShaykhKh§lid, as we have seen, urged his disciples to express their full loyaltyto the Sultan, but concomitantly stressed the duty of the Kh§lidÊshaykhs to guide the rulers on the path of the shari#a. This later aspectwas incompatible with MaÈmåd II’s ambition to rule his Empire inan autocratic manner. Therefore, at times of distress, when the Sultanwas wrestling with decentralist forces, he tended to accept theKh§lidÊs, and the orthodox elements in general, as his allies. Thus,following the destruction of the Janissaries he outlawed the Bekt§shÊorder, executed or banished its heads, and passed their propertiesinto NaqshbandÊ hands.68 In a series of declarations and ordinanceswhich he published at that time, he stressed the duty incumbent upon67 #A.

At times of relief, however, when MaÈmåd felt thatthe reigns of power were firm in his hands, he did not hesitate toturn against the Kh§lidiyya and rule, while respecting the shari#a,according to his own considerations. Paradoxically, the destructionof the Janissary corps in itself generated such a period of relief forthe Sultan, turning the Naqshbandiyya itself into the major elementthat in his eyes strove to limit his powers.69 Shaykh Kh§lid’s deathpresented him with a propitious opportunity to check this order’sinfluence.#Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ certainly tried to continue to conduct theKh§lidiyya from Sulaym§niyya, but the turn of the Sultan againsthim seems to have helped in intensifying the split within the order’sranks. Of particular importance for our purposes were the far reach-ing implications of his expulsion under the Sultan’s decree, togeth-er with the other khulaf§\" that accompanied Kh§lid from Iraq, forDamascus. On the one hand, this seriously reduced the strength ofthe order in the city and slowed its spread throughout Syria in gen-eral. On the other hand, it cleared the way, unintentionally, for therise of the only deputy that Kh§lid had ordained from among theinhabitants of the province of Damascus, though not of the city it-self, Shaykh MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ. Her§tÊ was allowed to return toDamascus four years after his enforced departure, as MaÈmåd II’sstruggle with MuÈammad #AlÊ of Egypt drove him to seek again thesupport of this orthodox ãarÊqa, but he was already on the verge ofdeath, and all he could do was to nominate Kh§nÊ as his successor.7069 Abu-Manneh, “The Naqshbandiyya–Mujaddidiyya,” pp. 29-31.70 #A.

It stands in sharp contrast to his previous practice of ordai-ning as many khulaf§\" as possible. As to Damascus, the considerablenumber of deputies that arrived with Kh§lid from Iraq and weresubsequently dispersed in the mosques of the city may have left litt-le room for the activity of new ones. As to the rest of Syria, this spanof time was perhaps too short to let him engage intensively in sprea-ding his order outside of Damascus. Yet, the main reason for thisavoidance is, in my opinion, Kh§lid’s desire to preserve the city asthe organizational center of the Kh§lidiyya without identifying it withlocal interests. When he felt that the assistance of local religious menwould be useful to his work Kh§lid preferred, therefore, to summonhis principal disciple from Hamah, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ, and trainhim as his deputy, rather than to appoint one of his Damascenedisciples. In other cities of Syria, by contrast, Kh§lid did not hesi-tate to nominate khulaf§\" when he could find suitable candidates.Taking into account the different versions in our sources, it seemsthat among his Syrian deputies we can count, besides Kh§nÊ him-self, on whom he relied also in Hamah, AÈmad al-•iíkilÊ in Homs1and AÈmad al-Urw§dÊ in Tripoli.2 Once Sultan MaÈmåd II turnedagainst Kh§lid’s successors in Syria after his death, this meagernumber of deputies, and particularly the absence of any deputy withlocal roots in Damascus, became an obstacle to the further expan-sion of the Kh§lidiyya in that country.1 On AÈmad al-•iíkilÊ see BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, p. 197; #Abd al-\\amÊd •ahm§z,Al-#All§ma al-Muj§hid al-Shaykh MuÈammad al-\\§mid (Damascus and Beirut, 1971),p. 206.2 On AÈmad al-Urw§dÊ see Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 77; MuÈammadal-Rakh§wÊ, Al-Anw§r al-Qudsiyya fÊ Man§qib al-S§da al-Naqshbandiyya (Cairo, 1344A.H.), pp. 263-264.1-3.p659/19/00, 12:47 PM81"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"chapter three82The collapse of the succession arrangement of Shaykh Kh§lid wasalso detrimental to the status of Damascus as the organizational centerof the order. Indeed, many of his deputies, in the Ottoman Empirein general and in Syria in particular, continued to regard Damas-cus with special reverence, in deference to Kh§lid’s legacy and tothe site of his tomb. Yet, only few among them were prepared toacknowledge MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ’s right to the leadership. Afterall, he was one of the last deputies of Kh§lid, and at the time of hisnomination as successor by #Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ, whose nominationwas in itself controversial, only thirty-four years of age. Kh§nÊ,however, persisted in his claim to head the entire order by stressingthe validity of Her§tÊ’s appointment by Ism§#Êl al-An§r§nÊ, as wellas his own status as the principal khalÊfa of Kh§lid to remain inDamascus. His claim came to reflect, thus, an ever deepening gapbetween the ideal of preserving the integrity of the order under onecentral leadership, which Kh§nÊ expressed by adhering to Kh§lid’snovelty in the practice of r§biãa, and the reality of its continuingexpansion under independent deputies through Kh§lid’s parallelnovelty in the practice of khalwa.At the same time, the disintegration of the Kh§lidiyya leadershipenabled the Ottoman central government to tighten its grip over theactivity of its various shaykhs. In Damascus this intervention in theaffairs of the order was postponed for almost a decade owing to theEgyptian conquest of Syria in 1832. Under Ibr§hÊm Pasha’s rule,MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ was able to retain his position as the foremostKh§lidÊ shaykh since his colleagues were again denied the right tosettle in the city. Paradoxically, Kh§nÊ’s own activity was toleratedthanks to his relatively weak position among the local elite, whichprovoked no apprehension on the part of the authorities. The as-cension of #AbdülmecÊd to the throne in 1839 and the Egyptianevacuation of Syria a year later precipitated a split in the leaders-hip of the Kh§lidiyya even in Damascus itself. At that time Kh§lid’sbrother and deputy in Sulaym§niyya, MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib, arrived inthe city and received the patronage of the Sultan against Kh§nÊ. Thelinkage of the two rivals to the Ottoman government, and theirattitude toward the reforms it implemented in Damascus, certainlyreflected their personal interests. They also derived from the diffe-rent ways in which they applied Kh§lid’s teaching to the new cir-cumstances of a government that was influenced by the orthodoxprinciples that the Naqshbandiyya itself propagated. Thus Kh§nÊ was1-3.p659/19/00, 12:47 PM82"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"fragmentation during the reform era (1832-1880)83of the opinion that, in order to avoid corrupting the souls of theadherents of the ãarÊqa, it was necessary to shun posts and decora-tions even when bestowed by rulers who followed the shari#a. ‘§Èib,in contrast, claimed that the Kh§lidÊ shaykhs should serve under suchrulers in the name of the shari#a. In this, both regarded themselvesas followers of the orthodox reformist way of Shaykh Kh§lid.The split in the leadership of the Kh§lidiyya order in Damascuswas attached to the larger division that emerged among the #ulamaof the city under the rule of #AbdülmecÊd, and greatly intensifiedtoward the end of the Ottoman Empire. The early Tanzimat reforms,which were founded on the pledge of the new Sultan to restoresecurity of life, honor, and property to his subjects in accordancewith the precepts of the shari#a, fortified the power of the #ulama,and of the urban notables in general, and assigned them an impor-tant role in the administration of the province.3 The reforms bene-fited mostly the established #ulama who occupied the senior religious-administrative posts in the city, and—even more important from ahistorical standpoint—a considerable number of lesser men of reli-gion who joined the Ottoman administration through its variouscouncils.4 The latter, who thus may be defined as the new Ottomantendency, were able to preserve, and even advance, their positionsduring the late Tanzimat period, after the traditional leadership ofthe city was banished for its involvement in the massacre of theChristians in 1860. They seized the highest religious posts in the timeof #AbdülÈamÊd II and his successors, the Young Turks. Against themthere emerged in Damascus of the early Tanzimat period a smallergroup of #ulama who preferred to distance themselves from the sta-te administration and rely on the teaching positions they held in themosques and colleges of the city. This group is the subject of thesecond part of this study.In consequence of the disintegration of the central leadership ofthe Naqshbandiyya–Kh§lidiyya in general, and its local split in Da-mascus in particular, the religious fervor of the order gradually sub-sided. The heads of its two principal branches died during the lateTanzimat period, and with them the entire generation of Kh§lid’sdisciples passed away.

The Kh§nÊs present the founder of theirfamily as the embodiment of the NaqshbandÊ ideal of the #§lim #§miland the accomplished sufi who strictly adheres to the shari#a. Thoughpartial, this characterization must have been basically correct; other-wise his selection as the principal deputy of Kh§lid in Syria wouldhardly have been conceivable. A critical examination of Kh§nÊ’sbiography against the background of the history of Damascus in histime will thus enable us to evaluate his contribution to the spreadof the Kh§lidÊ order, as well as its limitations.MuÈammad ibn #Abdall§h al-Kh§nÊ (1798-1862) was a scion of anotable family from Kh§n Shaykhån, a small town to the north ofHamah in which Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ was to be born half acentury later. His father died in his youth and his mother, a daugh-ter of a local sufi shaykh, took him with her to Hamah. Here MuÈam-mad turned to religious studies, specializing in Sh§fi#Ê jurispruden-ce. At the same time he became attached to a rigorous local man ofreligion who was famous for “enjoining good and forbidding evil”,and took the Q§dirÊ path from MuÈammad al-Kayl§nÊ of the ma-jor notable family in the city. Thereafter, he established himself inthe lodge mosque of the sixteenth century local saint and scholar,#Alw§n al-\\amawÊ.7 These early influences combined to shape Kh§nÊas a teacher of jurisprudence, an ardent sufi, and a zealot fighting5 M.

It is recalled that he used to forcepeople into the mosques in order to teach them the religious pre-cepts, a practice that earned him the nickname of mahdÊ al-zam§n,the rightly-guided (also the messiah) of his time.MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ first met Shaykh Kh§lid when the latter pas-sed through Hamah on his way to settle in Damascus. A little laterhe appeared at the shaykh’s lodge to take from him the Naqshban-dÊ path. Three days after commencing his spiritual training underthe guidance of Kh§lid, Kh§nÊ was already experiencing divinerapture (jadhba), and shortly thereafter he attained the state of anni-hilation in God (fan§\"). He thus proved to be among the mysticallyinclined elect to whom the Naqshbandiyya is particularly attuned.Upon completing the forty-day seclusion, Kh§nÊ returned to Hamahand proceeded assiduously in the new path. Following two more visitsto complete his spiritual training, he was ordered by Kh§lid to movewith his family to Damascus in 1825.8 The shaykh appointed himas his assistant in his jurisprudence class in place of #Umar al-Ghaz-zÊ, and subsequently made him his deputy in the Mur§diyya mos-que, in the southern Suwayqa quarter.9 Here Kh§nÊ engaged in theinitial guidance of the novices that Kh§lid assigned to him, beco-ming his close associate toward the end of his life. According to hisgrandson’s claim he also drafted many of Kh§lid’s letters to hisdisciples.After Shaykh Kh§lid’s demise the Mur§diyya mosque remainedthe basis of MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ’s power in Damascus. He enjoyeda high status in the order at this critical juncture, and was appoin-ted by Ism§#Êl al-An§r§nÊ to take charge of the execution of his will.10Following the expulsion of #Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ and the other depu-ties from the city by the Sultan’s order a year later, the number ofhis own disciples grew, though the Kh§nÊ sources stress the conti-nuous loyalty of their father to Her§tÊ. By force of his nominationby the latter as his successor in 1832, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ came8 MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the younger writes that Shaykh Kh§lid asked him tocome (ãalabahu ilayhi) and that he settled in Damascus on his instructions (bi-ish§ratshaykhihi). #Abd al-MajÊd writes that an order (amr) was received from the shaykh.9 For the text of the permission see #A.

Like his predecessors, Kh§nÊ engaged in conductingthe dhikr ceremony, training novices in Damascus, and sending hisdeputies to other parts of the Ottoman Empire. To fortify his posi-tion among the Kurds of Damascus, he married his son MuÈam-mad to the daughter of AÈmad al-KhaãÊb al-IrbÊlÊ, the first majordeputy that Kh§lid had sent to the city. To establish his authorityin other regions he undertook a number of journeys, mostly on thehajj, but also to Palestine in 1850 and to Istanbul via Beirut in 1854.As part of the Kh§lidÊ inheritance Kh§nÊ also took upon himself theguardianship of the founder’s family, tutoring his son privately athis home. Alongside his multiple occupations in the order, and inharmony with the ideal set forth by Kh§lid, he did not neglect theteaching of the various exoteric sciences, particularly jurisprudenceand hadith.The principal means employed by MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ to for-tify the integrity of the Kh§lidiyya under his own leadership was thecontinuation of the practice of r§biãa, in the new form it had receivedunder Kh§lid. Yet correctly assessing his actual strength as one ofthe latest deputies, and a not very charismatic one, Kh§nÊ avoideddemanding from the adherents of the order that he himself be theobject of their r§biãa. Following in the footsteps of his predecessors,An§r§nÊ and Her§tÊ, he urged them instead to continue to raise intheir imagination the figure of Shaykh Kh§lid. Kh§nÊ based hisdemand on two specific stresses in the Kh§lidÊ notion of r§biãa. Thefirst is the assertion, which in essence appears already in Kh§lid’swritings, that its practice is useful only when directed toward a perfectman (al-ins§n al-k§mil). This basically AkbarÊ concept Kh§nÊ definesas the master who works through his proximity to God (wal§ya) andreflects Him (mir\"§t al-Èaqq), so that those who internally contemplatehis spiritual form actually envision God. The second stress, whichrepresents Kh§nÊ’s adjustment of the notion to the circumstances ofthe order in his day, is that the r§biãa may be conducted also towarda deceased saint, whether at his tomb or by mentally directing one-self toward him. Through these two stresses Kh§nÊ articulated hiscriticism of those deputies of Kh§lid who instructed their disciples,during his lifetime and particularly after his death, to raise in theirimaginations their own figures. He reminded these khulaf§\" that owing1-3.p659/19/00, 12:47 PM86"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"fragmentation during the reform era (1832-1880)87to the inversion in the NaqshbandÊ path, and the danger it entails,the confirmation of the accomplished guide is necessary for becom-ing an object of r§biãa. Kh§lid, he pointed out, confirmed the per-fection of none among his deputies. The argument that a dead manno longer interests himself in worldly affairs was even more ominousin Kh§nÊ’s eyes, since it undermines the foundations of the order.The work of the masters after their demise is the cornerstone of thespiritual transmission of the NaqshbandÊ path, without which its chainof initiation, as well as its characteristic silent form of dhikr, wouldlose its validity.Moreover, in his defense on the practice of the r§biãa itself, MuÈam-mad al-Kh§nÊ was not content with the evidence produced by ShaykhKh§lid regarding its extensive use among the sufis in his Epistle inVerification of the R§biãa. Kh§nÊ’s attempt to demonstrate its firmfoundations also in the Qur\"an and the sunna, which Kh§lid couldavoid in his time, may reflect the growing orthodox criticism of thispractice outside the ranks of the order. Thus, for example, he findsa basis for it in the notion of wasÊla (means) in the Qur\"anic com-mandment: “seek the means to come to Him.”11 Kh§nÊ explains thatthis is a general notion, in which the r§biãa, as the best way to reachGod, is undoubtedly included. Another basis is the hadith in whichAbå Bakr complains to MuÈammad that he does not leave him evenwhen he is alone. According to Kh§nÊ’s interpretation, these wordsare aimed at the spiritual presence of the Prophet, from which AbåBakr, the first link following him in the NaqshbandÊ chain, has neverseparated.12On the other hand, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ continued to employthe second novelty of Shaykh Kh§lid in the NaqshbandÊ path, thekhalwa arba#Êniyya, as a means to spread the ãarÊqa in Syria and beyond.In complete loyalty to the legacy of Kh§lid, he adopted the samelenient approach toward the seekers of the path, in order to enlargeits ranks as much as possible.13 Kh§nÊ ordained throughout his lifea considerable number of deputies, though he could in no way equalhis master in the extent of his activity and influence. His grandsoncounts nineteen deputies, in addition to his three sons, coming fromdifferent parts of the Ottoman Empire and even beyond. Most ofthese khulaf§\" returned to their places of origin or settled in other areas11 Qur\"an, al-M§\"ida (5), 35.12 M.

Healso had a certain success among the Kurdish Kh§lidÊs, despite thelarge number of khulaf§\" that Kh§lid had ordained among them. Inone case, Kh§nÊ was involved in an internal conflict that eruptedfollowing the attempt of one of their adherents to establish an inde-pendent branch of the order under his own leadership. Accordingto #Abd al-MajÊd al-Kh§nÊ’s report, his grandfather ordered thedissident to desist, and appointed his principal opponent as his owndeputy in these areas.14In Syria itself, however, and particularly in Damascus, MuÈam-mad al-Kh§nÊ failed to create a firm basis of power. His principallocal successes were in Hamah, his hometown, where his deputiesran a local lodge to the end of the 1860s, and in Safad, in whichanother deputy is said to have been very active. Among the khulaf§\"he ordained in Damascus, most were Kurds and Turks rather thannatives of the city. The most active among them was AÈmad al-Zamalk§nÊ (d. 1882), a Kurd who after his authorization settled inthe Ghåãa village of Zamalk§ and dedicated himself to spreading theorder in Damascus and its vicinity. Kh§nÊ’s relations with the senior#ulama of Damascus, including other disciples and adherents ofKh§lid, were also limited. The only consequential connection weknow about was his relationship with #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-KuzbarÊ,the foremost hadith instructor in Syria. Kh§nÊ’s attendance at Ku-zbarÊ’s advanced lessons coincided with his emergence as the prin-cipal Kh§lidÊ shaykh in Damascus, following the expulsion of theforeign adherents of the order in 1828.15 His special interest in hadithstudies thus reflected not only the central place of the Prophet andthe Companions in the NaqshbandÊ teaching, but also his eagernessto preserve the attachment of this prestigious #alim to the Kh§lidiyya.Subsequently Kh§nÊ began to teach hadith himself, in addition toSh§fi#Ê jurisprudence in which he had specialized in Hamah.

It is evident, however, that in the 1840she was involved in agriculture, and probably also in trading with theHijaz. His frequent pilgrimages may have been connected with thiscommercial activity, and at times he sent his son as his agent.17The only echo of the political teaching of Shaykh Kh§lid to ap-pear in the writings of MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ is a short statement thatthe NaqshbandÊ master must avoid visiting rulers, lest his disciplesfollow him and stray from their path.18 He completely refrains frommentioning the complementary duty of working among rulers in orderto guide them on the path of the shari#a. Kh§nÊ’s shunning of anyinvolvement in political affairs must be understood against the back-ground of the Egyptian occupation regime, under which he compo-sed his book. The reforms that Ibr§hÊm Pasha introduced in Syriaprovided the country with a certain measure of efficient governmentand economic expansion; they nonetheless caused much resentment,as they were enforced in the autocratic manner that characterizedMuÈammad #AlÊ’s rule in Egypt, and were often incompatible withthe precepts of the shari#a. Moreover, the reforms were basicallyintended to undermine the local bases of power of the urban nota-bles, including the #ulama.19 In the face of this policy MuÈammadal-Kh§nÊ chose, again out of a realistic appraisal of his power, toavoid any contact with the Egyptian rulers, in order to prevent theirturning against the Kh§lidiyya. There is no reference to his attitudetoward them in his biography, although most of his first decade asthe principal Kh§lidÊ shaykh was spent under their government.Instead, the biographers focus on Kh§nÊ’s activity for the sake of theãarÊqa.

On the contrary, the fact that most of his Turkish deputieswere ordained toward the end of the 1830s might indicate that theyeven sought to use him at that time in the political struggle betweenthe Sultan and the Egyptian Pasha over the hearts of the popula-tion of Anatolia.20 Kh§nÊ, however, like most of the Damascene#ulama, must have felt relief when Ibr§hÊm Pasha was compelled towithdraw from Syria in 1840 and restore its government to theOttomans under the new Sultan, #AbdülmecÊd.The Split under the Aegis of the Early Tanzimat RegimeThe biographers of MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ continue their silence overhis activity during the first years after the return of the Ottomans toSyria and the introduction of the Tanzimat regime. This silence seemsto imply that the new Ottoman government regarded Kh§nÊ with asimilar indifference, or even with suspicion owing to his work un-der the previous Egyptian regime. #AbdülmecÊd’s disregard of Kh§nÊis particularly salient in view of the Sultan’s general sympathy withthe Kh§lidiyya and his tendency to incorporate its orthodox princi-ples into his reform policy. #AbdülmecÊd’s support for the order wasepitomized in his undertaking to erect a dome and a lodge overKh§lid’s grave in Damascus, thus responding to a special requestmade by one of the latter’s principal deputies, MuÈammad al-Far§qÊ(d. 1865), immediately following the promulgation of the GülhaneRescript.21 #AbdülmecÊd in 1842 entrusted the initial construction tothe acting governor, NajÊb Pasha, who was himself a follower of theKh§lidiyya, and financed it from his private treasury. Upon thecompletion of the project four years later he allocated it ample awqafand appointed Far§qÊ as its head.

Perhaps it was at this period that Kh§nÊ began to receivean allowance from the state.24 Concluding his term of office byconducting the annual pilgrimage caravan, SafvetÊ showed his gre-at respect to the shaykh who accompanied him by performing therites according to his special prescriptions. On his return to Istan-bul, he erected a NaqshbandÊ–Kh§lidÊ lodge at his private expense,and nominated a deputy of Kh§nÊ as its head. It is interesting to notethat in the endowment charter SafvetÊ explicitly specified that thehead of the lodge must not be a Kurd.25 MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ’s visitto Istanbul in 1854 was at the request of his patron, who lodged himat his home and spread his name in the capital. For Kh§nÊ, this wasan important opportunity to strengthen his claim to head theKh§lidiyya among its Turkish adherents by inspecting the work ofhis deputies and disciples, giving counsel, and guiding on the path.He had also had the chance to meet Sultan #AbdülmecÊd, while thelatter was on his way to attend the recital of the Prophet’s birthdaypoems (mawlid) in his mosque. This encounter caused him, as hisgrandson relates, a strong spiritual experience (È§l #aíÊm) and uncha-racteristic weeping. Six years later, Kh§nÊ was opposed to the mas-sacre of the Christians in Damascus. Consequently, Fu\"§d Pasha, theOttoman foreign minister who was sent as a special envoy to hand-le the rioters, explicitly excluded him and his followers from punish-ment. MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ died two years later, in 1862.26In his eulogy of his grandfather, #Abd al-MajÊd al-Kh§nÊ assertsthat “God bestowed upon him success on earth, great respect anda voice that the rulers would listen to, despite the fact that he wascareful to avoid them. They would often come to visit him, receivehis blessing and take the exalted path from him.”27 This ideal es-23 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 74; ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid, p. 195; bothAs#ad al-‘§Èib’s additions and notes.24 BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, p. 1038.25 #A.

The appraisal of his achievements against thebackground of his own day reveals a more complex reality. Kh§nÊsucceeded perhaps in generating a measure of respect on the partof some governors of Damascus, particularly SafvetÊ Pasha, but hefailed to integrate himself into the upper strata of the city’s #ulama,and certainly had no influence over the central government in Istan-bul. This is most evident in the report on his encounter with #Ab-dülmecÊd. During his four months stay in the Ottoman capital Kh§nÊwas not invited even once into the presence of the Sultan, while theencounter on the way to the mosque was merely accidental and issuedin no conversation between them either. On the other hand, Kh§nÊwas able to a great extent to preserve his independence vis-à-vis theOttoman government. He was certainly glad to receive a state allo-wance to finance his work in his lodge, but his economic basis laymainly in the lands he held and in trading its produce with the Hijaz.This point signified the essential difference between Kh§nÊ and theother major leader of the Kh§lidiyya in early Tanzimat Damascus,MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib.In the examination of ‘§Èib’s life and claim to succeed ShaykhKh§lid we are compelled to rely on sources that are no less partialthan those which deal with MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ. These are basi-cally two biographies composed by his son, As#ad al-‘§Èib; the oneas part of the editor’s addition to Baghd§dÊ’s fundamental exposi-tion of the Kh§lidiyya,28 the other being a more detailed rejoinderto #Abd al-MajÊd al-Kh§nÊ’s biographical history of the order.29 Likethe sources on MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ, these two biographies werecomposed during the 1880s, and most historians of Damascus de-pended on them. Yet, they must be treated with double caution, sinceAs#ad al-‘§Èib could not count in his writing on a profound acquain-tance with his father, who died when he was merely eleven yearsold. A considerable part of his account consists, therefore, of anec-dotes on the spiritual merits and exemplary acts (man§qib) of MaÈmådal-‘§Èib as related in retrospect by his disciples and acquaintances.28 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, pp. 70-75.29 ‘§Èib, Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyya, pp. 47-92.1-3.p659/19/00, 12:47 PM92"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"fragmentation during the reform era (1832-1880)93Even more important is the fact that As#ad tended to use the figureof his father as a means to advance his own claim to lead theKh§lidiyya. Lacking other sources to verify his version, we are obli-ged to resort to our own, at times arbitrary, deliberation in an at-tempt to sort out the authentic details of his life, which concern ourpresent discussion, from the additions that allude to the circumstancesof his son, to be dealt in the next chapter.MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib (1783-1866) was the younger brother of ShaykhKh§lid. Their father died when he was still young, and the elderbrother, MuÈammad Kh§n, undertook his education. ‘§Èib learnedQur\"an and the fundamentals of jurisprudence,30 but was not attractedto study, and as far as I know wrote nothing. Rather, he trod thesufi path under the guidance of Kh§lid after the latter’s return fromIndia as a NaqshbandÊ master. Reaching illumination, he becamehis deputy in 1815 and was authorized to guide his own disciples.31‘§Èib’s later biography, as well as the letters that Kh§lid wrote him,however, reveal that also as a sufi shaykh he was far inferior to hisbrother. He was more influenced by ecstatic states, on the one hand,and was particularly concerned with his own well-being, on the other.Nevertheless, when Shaykh Kh§lid left Sulaym§niyya, first for Bag-hdad and then for Damascus, he left ‘§Èib as his deputy in the lodgehe established in that city. Faced with many opponents among theadherents of the order, ‘§Èib decided to join Kh§lid shortly afterhis arrival in Damascus, and then left for the hajj. Subsequently,Kh§lid ordered him to return to Sulaym§niyya, where he resumedhis position in the following years.32 In 1828, ‘§Èib accommodated#Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ, together with Kh§lid’s widow and his recentlyborn son, who reached Sulaym§niyya after their expulsion from Syria.On that occasion they informed their host that his brother hadbequeathed him all his property in Kurdistan.MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib left Sulaym§niyya for the last time in 1831,30 BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, p. 1455.31 For the text of his permission, in the Naqshbandiyya and Q§diriyya orders,see ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid, pp. 160-162.32 This is a summary of the contradictory versions produced by his son, As#adal-‘§Èib. In Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyya, pp. 54-55, As#ad maintains that his father cameto Syria, and Kh§lid sent him to the Hijaz and then ordered him back toSulaym§niyya; in Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, pp. 71-72, he asserts, by contrast, that Kh§lidsummoned him, and that it was ‘§Èib who asked to return and resume his workthere, a less plausible version. In Bughyat al-W§jid, pp. 138-141, he produces a letterfrom Kh§lid to ‘§Èib, which he argues to be a reply to the latter’s request to performthe hajj.1-3.p659/19/00, 12:47 PM93"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"chapter three94shortly before Sultan MaÈmåd II allowed the foreign Kh§lidÊs toreturn to Syria. It seems, thus, that it was his troubles in the citythat drove him to depart, rather than a desire to succeed his brotherin Damascus or to lead the order. Following a prolonged stay inDiy§rbakr, he reached Damascus at the end of that year, or at thebeginning of the next (the hijrÊ year 1247), undoubtedly after thepermission was given. Establishing himself in the #Add§s mosque,which had been the center of Kh§lid’s activity, he began to instructnovices and demanded his brother’s property. ‘§Èib’s claim to headthe order naturally met with the opposition of Her§tÊ, who hadreturned to the city at the same time, and of his followers. Shortlythereafter ‘§Èib departed to the Hijaz, where he is said to have spentthe next seven years in spiritual devotions and worship. His son doesnot specify the reasons that prompted him to leave Damascus, butthe timing indicates that he was compelled to make this move afterthe conquest of the city by Ibr§hÊm Pasha. He returned immediate-ly following the evacuation of the Egyptian army from Syria in 1840.Under Sultan #AbdülmecÊd’s reign MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib was actual-ly recognized by the state as the senior Kh§lidÊ shaykh in Damas-cus. Upon his return to the city ‘§Èib resumed the instruction ofnovices and tried to send deputies to other regions as well. His namereached the ears of the Sultan, who decided to extend him his pa-tronage. In a firman of 1843 he appointed ‘§Èib as shaykh andteacher in the Sulaym§niyya lodge, with an allowance that permit-ted him to lead a comfortable life. This position in one of the lea-ding religious institutions of Damascus secured him a much stron-ger basis than Kh§nÊ’s in the Mur§diyya mosque, and he retainedit till his death. A series of anecdotes in his biography alludes to theinfluence that ‘§Èib is supposed to have exerted on the Ottomanrulers under the reign of #AbdülmecÊd and to the high status heacquired in the city. One of them relates that a man arrived at thelodge and asked the shaykh’s help in procuring an official post,promising in reward half of his salary. He was nominated successi-vely as financial officer (defterd§r) in Aleppo and Baghdad and asfinance minister in Istanbul, but each time he failed to send the pro-mised money and was consequently dismissed.33 To #AlÊ Ri·§, wholost his post in Baghdad, ‘§Èib predicted according to another anec-dote that within three months he would become the governor of Syria,33 ‘§Èib, Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyya, pp. 73-74.1-3.p659/19/00, 12:47 PM94"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"fragmentation during the reform era (1832-1880)95as actually happened. In his three years of tenure this governor su-pervised the construction of the lodge on Kh§lid’s tomb, at the sametime devotedly serving ‘§Èib and asking his counsel.34 Toward Saf-vetÊ Pasha, the governor who sponsored MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ, ‘§Èibwas evidently hostile. One anecdote relates that SafvetÊ’s brother,who served as the provincial defterd§r, promised ‘§Èib to cover thelodge walls with lead if he was appointed as governor of Damascus.SafvetÊ duly received the post, but his brother declined to fulfill hispromise. Therefore, when he departed at the head of the hajj cara-van, another governor arrived to replace him. In another anecdoteSafvetÊ and the commander of the army stationed in the provinceare described as NaqshbandÊ adherents who obey the shaykh’s de-mand that they supply the needs of the lodge.35 A last anecdote alludesto MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib’s position toward the massacre of the Christi-ans in 1860. It relates that his spirit was troubled by AÈmad Pas-ha’s conduct, and that he invoked the spiritual power (himma) ofShaykh Kh§lid, “the sharp sword”, against him. Forty days later thegovernor was executed by Fu\"§d Pasha.36Sultan #AbdülmecÊd’s patronage and the lucrative base in theSulaym§niyya lodge could have helped MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib to advancehis position in the leadership of the Kh§lidiyya. There is no eviden-ce in the sources that he devoted much effort to attaining this pur-pose. ‘§Èib corresponded with some of Kh§lid’s deputies, especial-ly those from the Kurdish regions, but in this period he authorizedfew deputies of his own. His son counts in his biography elevendeputies,37 most of them ordained prior to his arrival in Damascus.Only two among these khulaf§\" were active in Syria. One of them, anative of Herat, was sent by ‘§Èib to Aleppo and subsequently tothe adjacent town of Ma#arrat al-Nu#m§n, but in both he met withvery limited success. The other, Abå Bakr al-Kil§lÊ of Kurdistan, wasby far the most outstanding religious figure that As#ad al-‘§Èibreckons as a deputy of his father. Yet, none of the other sources atour disposal confirm this relationship, and it seems that Kil§lÊ wasin fact closer to the section of #ulama to which Kh§nÊ belonged.3834 Ibid., p. 80.35 Ibid., pp. 72, 74; Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 74.36 ‘§Èib, Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyya, p. 77.37 Ibid., pp. 58-59, 63-65.

According to the testi-mony he puts in his mouth, Kil§lÊ decided to join the Naqshban-diyya in 1846, after he sought God’s direction (istikh§ra) and wasordered to approach MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib.40Instead of working within the framework of the Naqshbandiyya–Kh§lidiyya order, ‘§Èib chose to dedicate his efforts to enhance hisposition among the religious men of Damascus. The anecdotes thatare dispersed in his biography allude to his connections with manyof Kh§lid’s great disciples, who preserved their affinity to theKh§lidiyya while now joining the local tendency in the city. Theseincluded #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-KuzbarÊ and \\§mid al-#Aãã§r, whothemselves held teaching posts in the Sulaym§niyya lodge, #Umaral-GhazzÊ, who thanks to the marriage of his sister to Kh§lid wasalso ‘§Èib’s relative, as well as MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ himself. The-se connections, however, seem to have been founded on the respectthat these #ulama showed toward MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib as the brotherand deputy of Shaykh Kh§lid, rather than on any appreciation ontheir part of his personality or work. KuzbarÊ and his colleagues cer-tainly did not regard themselves as ‘§Èib’s disciples either in #ilm orin the ãarÊqa. MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib, on his part, was more attuned to-ward members of the younger generation of religious men in Da-mascus who had no direct acquaintance with the legacy of ShaykhKh§lid.The rise of the New Ottoman TendencyA close examination of the biographical dictionaries of Damascusreveals that none of the #ulama that As#ad al-‘§Èib counts as disci-ples of his father actually studied the religious sciences with him or,in most cases, trod the path under his guidance. There is no doubtthat this list of “disciples” was compiled in order to elevate MaÈmåd’sstatus, and thus to demonstrate that the ancestors of As#ad’s owncolleagues were also attached to the Kh§lidiyya. Nevertheless, his39 BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, p. 103.40 ‘§Èib, Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyya, p. 73.1-3.p659/19/00, 12:47 PM96"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"fragmentation during the reform era (1832-1880)97list supplies us with a glimpse into the roots of the #ulama group whichchose to remain attached to the Ottoman administration throughall its vicissitudes almost to the end of the Empire, the group to whichMaÈmåd al-‘§Èib, and following him his son As#ad, belonged.Like the most faithful Damascene adherents of Shaykh Kh§lid inthe disturbed period that preceded the Egyptian occupation of Sy-ria, most of his brother’s “disciples” after the restoration of Otto-man rule were upstart #ulama who hailed from families engaged intrade. This background rendered them more capable of exploitingthe new opportunities opened before the religious estate of the citywith the introduction of the Tanzimat reforms. Similarly to MaÈmådal-‘§Èib, their goal was to join the ranks of the established #ulama,who up till then kept the senior religious positions in the Ottomanadministration exclusively for themselves. Accordingly, most of the-se upstart #ulama focused on acquiring the religious sciences that weremost instrumental for their advancement, particularly the official\\anafÊ jurisprudence. The centers of their activity were in the newprovincial council (majlis) and in the Umayyad mosque. Thus, on thebasis of Albert Hourani’s model, MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib’s “disciples”, whojoined the ranks of the urban notables by strengthening their attach-ment to the central government, can be seen as part of the newOttoman tendency in Damascus. As I have already stressed, thisdefinition does not relate to the degree of political loyalty of these#ulama to the Ottoman government, indeed not even to the programof reforms that made possible their own rise, but only to their newfunctioning within the Ottoman administration.The elder members of the new Ottoman tendency among the #ula-ma of Damascus were the heads of the Usãuw§nÊ and the J§bÊ fami-lies. Sa#Êd al-Usãuw§nÊ (1821-1888) traveled to Istanbul immediate-ly following the ascension of #AbdülmecÊd in 1839, returning withan appointment as preacher (khaãÊb) and \\anafÊ prayer leader (im§m)in the Umayyad mosque, though he was only nineteen. His mainpromotion occurred after 1860, when he was appointed to the pro-vincial council in 1863 and subsequently as qadi of Damascus in 1869,a post which was normally reserved for Turks. However, toward theend of his life Usãuw§nÊ seems to have changed his tendency. Heresigned from all his posts in 1873, following a dispute with thegovernor on the question of agricultural land acquisition by foreig-ners. Subsequently, under the \\amÊdian regime, he even refrainedfrom competing for the post of \\anafÊ mufti, which became vacant1-3.p659/19/00, 12:47 PM97"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"chapter three98in 1887, because he was unwilling to humiliate himself before thosewho were forwarded by the government. Usãuw§nÊ was exceptionalamong ‘§Èib’s “disciples” also in possessing a clear sufi inclination.He was initiated into the #Alawiyya path in Istanbul and, at a laterperiod, into the RashÊdiyya in the Hijaz.41 The success of #$rif al-J§bÊ (d. 1886) was even more spectacular, and he was nominated qadiin a number of provinces of the Empire. The rise of the family tohigh religious status began already under his father, MuÈammad al-J§bÊ (1793-1881), a merchant who traveled more than once to Istan-bul till he secured a position in the provincial council in 1844.Becoming very influential, he was himself appointed qadi in variousprincipal cities of the Empire, including in Damascus immediatelyfollowing the 1860 riots and later in Istanbul, receiving unprecedentedhigh decorations. His son #$rif followed in his footsteps and retur-ned to Damascus only in his last years.42 For the history of religious reform trends in late Ottoman Da-mascus, however, more important were the junior “disciples” ofMaÈmåd al-‘§Èib, the heads of the Munayyir and the KhaãÊb fa-milies. MuÈammad al-Munayyir (c.1806-1874) was a scion of a Sh§fi#Êfamily of #ulama that was engaged in commerce and agriculture. Hisfather died in his youth, but he was nonetheless able to devote him-self to religious studies, specializing in hadith, Qur\"an exegesis, andjurisprudence, in which he converted to the \\anafÊ school. Munayyirtaught these subjects in the Umayyad mosque, as well as in theSin§niyya mosque in the south of the city, and while on a pilgrima-ge was honored to give a lesson in the Prophet’s mosque in Medi-na. He acquired much influence in the administration of Damascusafter 1860, and following a visit to Istanbul in 1866 he was appoin-ted president of the educational council of Syria (majlis al-#ilm).43#Abd al-Q§dir al-KhaãÊb (c.1806-1871) was claimed by As#ad al-‘§Èib as a disciple of his father not only in the religious sciences butalso in the NaqshbandÊ path.

Three were allegedly also disciples of MaÈmådal-‘§Èib, the fourth preferring to join the Sh§dhiliyya–Yashruãiyyaorder.45 The most outstanding son was Abå al-Khayr al-KhaãÊb (1831-1889), the first in the family to be nominated in 1870 to the lucra-tive post of preacher in the Umayyad mosque, alongside membersof the Usãuw§nÊ and ManÊnÊ families. The subjects toward which hewas most inclined were Sufism and hadith.46Though clearly ambitious, the #ulama of the new Ottoman ten-dency in Damascus of the early Tanzimat period seem to have beencareful to maintain good relations with their senior colleagues, theestablished #ulama who became the foremost component among thecity leadership. Considerably promoted under the late Tanzimatregime, they also kept good relations with their counterparts of thelocal tendency, into whose hands the religious leadership of the citynow passed. In this respect too they were reminiscent of MaÈmådal-‘§Èib. The latent contradiction between the “Ottoman” and the“local” #ulama of Damascus thus became evident only in the nextgeneration, when some of their successors turned their administra-tive affinity for the Ottoman government into a politico-religiousloyalty to the Islamic policy of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II. These heirs,along with As#ad al-‘§Èib, proved to be the sworn enemies of theSalafiyya trend.

It was unable to leavea permanent mark in Tripoli, where the activity of Kh§lid’s localdeputy, AÈmad al-Urw§dÊ, remained limited, and ceased altogeth-er with his death. However, even in Damascus itself there was anoticeable weakening in the activity of the second generation Kh§lidÊshaykhs. Concomitantly, the internal rivalry in the order also abat-ed, principally because MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib declined to appoint anysuccessor. It was thus only among the Kh§nÊs that some of the orig-inal drive to unify the Kh§lidiyya under their leadership, and toconsolidate their position as the leaders of the ãarÊqa in Damascus,persisted.The heir of MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ as head of the Naqshbandiyyaorder in Damascus was his elder son, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ theyounger (1831-1898).47 Family succession was a common practiceamong the sufi orders of the time, just as among the senior officeholding #ulama, though in both cases it often resulted in corruption.MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the elder, however, was very punctilious inthe education of his son and regarded him a worthy heir. He him-self taught him the traditional religious sciences, mainly jurisprudence,hadith and Sufism; but through one of his senior disciples, MuÈam-mad al-•anã§wÊ, he enabled him to become familiar also with themore modern sciences which the latter had acquired while studyingin Egypt in the 1840s.48 In addition, he bestowed upon him theNaqshbandiyya, as a blessing, already at the age of seven. Attractedto Sufism, Kh§nÊ the younger began to tread the path a few yearslater under his father’s guidance. He accompanied him on his visit47 The main sources on MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the younger are #A.

Consequently, his father accorded himcomplete authorization (khil§fa muãlaqa), promoting him over the restof the deputies and permitting him to engage in guidance. Two yearslater, on his deathbed, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the elder nominatedhis son as his successor and enjoined the other khulaf§\" to obey him.In view of this explicit testament, his son had no difficulties in con-solidating his leadership over the family branch of the Kh§lidiyya.Following in his father’s footsteps Kh§nÊ the younger guided novi-ces, conducted the khatm al-khw§jag§n sessions, and taught variousreligious sciences. He kept his seat in the Mur§diyya mosque, whe-re his allowance was also continued.MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the younger began to consolidate his posi-tion, in Damascus and in the order in general, already upon his au-thorization as the principal deputy of his father in 1859. Immedia-tely thereafter he departed to Istanbul to secure the continuity of thefamily’s connection with its patron, Mås§ SafvetÊ, and perhaps alsoto receive the allegiance of the other Kh§lidÊ deputies in the capi-tal. In 1861 Kh§nÊ set out in the company of his teacher, MuÈam-mad al-•anã§wÊ, for Egypt, where he was anxious to obtain certifi-cates from the leading #ulama of al-Azhar and to visit the tombs ofits saints. A year later, already as the head of his family branch ofthe Kh§lidiyya, he passed again through Egypt on his way to thehajj. Kh§nÊ the younger’s struggle for recognition was further but-tressed by his marriage to F§ãima, the daughter of Shaykh Kh§lidand #$\"isha al-GhazzÊ, in 1863.49 It fortified his position both in theãarÊqa, by relating him to the family of the founder, and among theupper strata of #ulama and notables in Damascus, by binding himto one of the leading families of the city at the time.50 The fact thatthis marriage took place shortly after the death of #Umar al-GhazzÊin 1860 and of MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the elder two years later, whenF§ãima was already thirty-eight years old, may indicate that therelationship between these two disciples of Kh§lid was far fromcordial.

Like his father, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the youn-ger held agricultural lands in the Ghåãa,51 and traded in their pro-duce with the Hijaz. He often joined the Syrian hajj caravan, firstas his father’s representative and subsequently as head of the fami-ly. In his first visit to Mecca following his ordination as a Kh§lidÊdeputy in 1859, Kh§nÊ still attracted no special attention, but fiveyears later, according to the description of his son, the #ulama andnotables flocked to him, and he received the highest marks of ho-nor that the city could offer. The gates of the Ka#ba were openedfor him every morning by a respectable local #alim, and his namewas registered in the prestigious book of #ulam§\" al-Èaramayn. Thesewere followed by the suggestion of the Sharifs of Mecca, amir#Abdall§h and his brother and later successor amir \\usayn al-#Awn,that he stay in the city and head a NaqshbandÊ lodge, to be builtspecially for him. The two seem to have attached importance to sufireformist activity under their aegis in general, as part of their strug-gle to preserve their autonomy vis-à-vis the Ottoman government.52Indeed, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ frequented the circle of the greatreformist sufi masters who had established their seat in the city atthe time. These included MuÈammad al-F§sÊ, who headed his ownbranch of the Sh§dhiliyya–Madaniyya,53 and Ibr§hÊm al-RashÊd, amajor disciple of AÈmad ibn IdrÊs and the founder of the RashÊdiyyaorder.54 Kh§nÊ’s affinity to these masters must have stimulated#Abdall§h and \\usayn al-#Awn to attempt to attract him to the city51 \\§fií and Ab§ía, vol. 3 (suppl.), p. 342.52 William Ochsenwald, Religion, Society and the State in Arabia: The Hijaz underOttoman Control, 1840-1908 (Columbus, Oh., 1984), pp. 153-185; Butrus Abu-Manneh, “Sultan AbdülÈamid II and the Sharifs of Mecca (1880-1900),” AAS, 9(1973), pp. 2-5.53 On MuÈammad al-F§sÊ see pp. 197-198.54 On Ibr§hÊm al-RashÊd see R.

For Kh§nÊ, however, this was a too far-reaching offer. Hehad no intention of leaving Damascus, especially as the head of therival Kh§lidÊ branch in the city, MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib, had died a yearearlier, and he had no reason to transfer the center of the order fromKh§lid’s place of burial.Yet, despite the conspicuous improvement in the social positionof the Kh§nÊs in Damascus during the late Tanzimat period, the fa-mily did not succeed in attaining notable status. Moreover, its eco-nomic base proved too precarious to observe Shaykh Kh§lid’s in-struction to keep distance from the rulers. The lands that it held andthe modest allowance it received for maintaining the Mur§diyya mos-que, were sufficient to finance the activity of MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊthe younger at the head of the order, but not to sustain additionalmembers of the family as well. Thus his brother AÈmad (1836-1899),who was also ordained as deputy by their father and assisted him inthe lodge, turned reluctantly to state employment. This entailedmoving from his own Sh§fi#Ê to the official \\anafÊ school. AÈmadal-Kh§nÊ fulfilled modest functions as assistant judge (n§\"ib qa·§\") inDamascus itself and in neighboring towns, and is said to have ad-ministered justice strictly and in accordance with the shari#a. Resig-ning once because of his qualms about working in the service of therulers, he was soon obliged to resume his office.55 The same resortto official employment became the rule among his younger brothersand other members of the family.As far as I know, apart from the short biography of his father men-tioned above MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the younger also has left no wri-tings. To examine his views we must therefore satisfy ourselves withthe brief notes in which his son, #Abd al-MajÊd, sums up his biography.Like his father, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ regarded himself as the headof the entire Naqshbandiyya–Kh§lidiyya order. Accordingly, heallowed no one to perform the r§biãa without directing himself to thefigure of Shaykh Kh§lid and severely reprimanded those shaykhs whoinstructed their disciples to raise their own figures in their imagina-tions. Kh§nÊ apparently also continued to conduct the khalwa, thoughunlike his father he ordained only a handful of deputies, non of themfrom among his disciples in Damascus, not even his own sons. #Abdal-MajÊd refers this small number of deputies to his father’s exces-sive strictness in observing the principles of the order.

The foremost figure in thissufi awakening was Shaykh Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ, his principalreligious propaganda vehicle toward the Arab provinces, and parti-cularly Syria. #AbdülÈamÊd drew this undistinguished Rif§#Ê to hisentourage in Istanbul at the beginning of his reign, nominated himas head of all sufi shaykhs of the Empire, and accorded him thehighest ranks and decorations. Abå al-Hud§ constructed and reno-vated many Rif§#Ê lodges at the Sultan’s expense, appointed hisprotégés as their heads, took under his aegis various family sub-orders,and obtained for all those who joined him the exemption frommilitary service which was the prerogative of the religious students.These lodges turned under his guidance into centers for mobilizingMuslim public opinion in favor of the absolute rule of the Sultan.The main propaganda material to be used in them was the nume-rous books published by Abå al-Hud§ himself, in which he defen-ded #AbdülÈamÊd II’s claim to the Caliphate and stressed the dutyto unite behind him and unreservedly obey him. In addition, he wasmuch engaged in proving his own genealogy as a Rif§#Ê shaykh anda sharÊf, as well as in spreading his order. The strict censorship ofthe \\amÊdian regime was designed to ensure that books advancingother opinions would not be published.1The support of the Sultan in sufi activity was not confined, ho-wever, to Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ of the Rif§#iyya, and to £§fir al-MadanÊ of the Sh§dhiliyya who filled for him a similar function inthe capital in respect of the North African provinces.

In Damascus, where the impact of Abå al-Hud§ was lessconspicuous than in northern Syria or in Iraq,2 one of the foremostfigures among these shaykhs was As#ad al-‘§Èib of the Naqshban-diyya-Kh§lidiyya. Traveling to Istanbul after #AbdülÈamÊd II’s Isla-mic policy was introduced in Damascus at the beginning of the 1880s,he managed to secure his father’s position in the lucrative and well-endowed Sulaym§niyya lodge, despite the fact that MaÈmåd al-‘§Èibhad died fifteen years earlier without appointing any successor. Inhis attachment to the Ottoman central government As#ad followedin the footsteps of his father under the Tanzimat regimes, thoughhis model was rather Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ. Like Abå al-Hud§he proved willing, to the best of his ability, to harness the Kh§lidiyya,and its orthodox principles, in the service of #AbdülÈamÊd. In this,‘§Èib’s conduct marked a further deviation from the NaqshbandÊprinciple that Shaykh Kh§lid had so emphasized, namely to main-tain a superior distance from the rulers. The patronage ‘§Èib re-ceived as a reward from the Ottoman state helped him to overco-me his lack of roots in Damascus and acquire an influential positionin the city, one which far exceeded that of his father during theTanzimat period.As#ad al-‘§Èib’s attachment to the Islamic policy of Sultan #Ab-dülÈamÊd II thus renewed, and greatly aggravated, the split that hadbecome apparent among the Kh§lidÊ leaders in Damascus of theprevious generation over the question of the attitude to be takentoward the rulers. The established branch of the Kh§nÊ family, thougheconomically stressed, sought to remain detached from the Ottomanadministration.3 ‘§Èib, by contrast, did not hesitate to exploit theinfluential position he had acquired under the patronage of the\\amÊdian regime to claim the leadership of the order in Damascusfor himself. This was essentially a local struggle, but ‘§Èib’s chal-lenge to the Kh§nÊs was formulated, parallel to their own claims, aspertaining to the leadership of the ãarÊqa in general.

Thus, in the successors’ generation, the gapbetween the ideal of preserving the integrity of the Kh§lidiyya un-der one leadership, which could be surmised from their writings, andthe reality of an inner struggle between two weak local branches,reached absurd proportions. The outcome of the struggle was ulti-mately determined in favor of the branch that was ready to rely onthe power of the state. With its backing, As#ad al-‘§Èib was able toexploit the rivalries within the extending Kh§nÊ family to secure itsleadership for his own candidate. The reliance on the support of thegovernment, however, reflected his recognition that the organiza-tional novelties of Shaykh Kh§lid in the order had lost much of theirvalidity. ‘§Èib’s writings betray, therefore, despite his defense of theform of these practices, an increasing tendency to compromise theirsubstance.The struggle which developed within the NaqshbandÊ–Kh§lidÊorder of Damascus in the shadow of the \\amÊdian regime, like thesplit in its ranks during the preceding era of reforms, was interwo-ven with the wider polarization that emerged among the #ulama ofthe city, and among the Ottoman elite in general, as the late Tan-zimat faded away. The roots of this polarization lay in the oppo-sing attitudes adopted then by the statesmen of the capital towardthe two interrelated subjects of reform and the ideal system of go-vernment. One group favored the continuation of the Western-in-spired reforms introduced by the Grand Viziers #$li and Fu\"§d Pashas.It espoused the granting of equal rights to all subjects of the Empireon the basis of territorial identity and loyalty to the state (the prin-ciple of Ottomanism), and was prepared to allow for some measureof decentralization to secure its implementation. The other groupstrove to restore actual power into the hands of the Sultan in accor-dance with the orthodox political teaching of Islam. It stressed thesupremacy of the Muslim element in the Empire and the subjects’duty of loyalty to the person of the Sultan, which implied his rightto establish a centralized government under his own control.4 TheIslamic policy of #AbdülÈamÊd II, in which mobilizing the supportof the popular sufi orders constituted only one facet, was designedto ensure such a rule.5 In Damascus those who became attached toit were principally second generation #ulama of the Ottoman ten-4 Abu-Manneh, ibid., p. 134.5Deringil, pp. 44-67.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM107"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"chapter four108dency. The position of these #ulama in the city depended upon theirconnections to the central administration, and it was only naturalthat they would transfer their loyalty to the Sultan when he impo-sed himself as its actual head. Concomitantly, they adopted the officialview that the absolute rule of the Caliph of the Muslims was a pre-cept of the shari#a, as propagated by Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ, andthat the Sultan’s main concern was with the welfare of his subjects,as AÈmad #Izzat al-#$bid sought to demonstrate.6 These men ofreligion, whom we may thus characterize as belonging to the Otto-man—orthodox tendency, could accomplish under the patronage ofthe central government the path inaugurated by their fathers duringthe early Tanzimat regime, and to seize the senior religious posi-tions in Damascus. The second generation #ulama of the local ten-dency, who basically supported the continuation of the Tanzimatreforms, were consequently driven into a stand of opposition in thecity. From among this group of local—reformist #ulama graduallyemerged the SalafÊ trend, which will be dealt in the last part of thisstudy.In the wake of the Young Turk revolution of 1908, and the failu-re of the conservative counter-revolution in the following year, itseemed that in Damascus, as in the entire Ottoman Empire, the #ula-ma and sufi shaykhs who served the autocratic regime of #AbdülÈamÊdII had been defeated. This was symbolized by the arrest and humi-liation of Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ, who died shortly thereafter. Yet,after the initial excitement subsided, and, more particularly, after theCommittee for Union and Progress (CUP) gained the upper handin the government, it became apparent that the new regime soughtto harness to his service the same elements that its predecessor had.After all, the basically nationalist and secular ideology of the YoungTurks notwithstanding, in their commitment to centralization theyproved to be the loyal successors of #AbdülÈamÊd.7 Among the #ula-ma of the Ottoman—orthodox tendency in Damascus, this centra-lizing policy caused a new split.

Some of the sufishaykhs who belonged to this trend, however, felt more than everthe need for the ruler’s protection, both because of the strengthe-ning of the rationalist tendencies in the Empire and because of theconsolidation of the SalafÊ trend against them. The foremost religiousman in this group was again As#ad al-‘§Èib, who remained in con-sequence the leading Kh§lidÊ shaykh in the city also under the YoungTurk regime. His loyalty to the Ottoman government reached itspeak during the First World War, when he did not hesitate to backeven the stiff policy of Jam§l Pasha, the military governor of Syria,toward the leaders of the nascent Arab nationalist movement. In hiswritings of this period, As#ad set out to defend the mystic way againstits modern assailants, both Westernizers and SalafÊs. At the same time,he was driven to relinquish entirely the organizational novelties ofShaykh Kh§lid in the Naqshbandiyya and, with them, its unique pathwithin the general Sufi framework.Challenging the Leadership under the \\amÊdian RegimeAs#ad al-‘§Èib (1855-1928) inherited his father’s position as theNaqshbandÊ–Kh§lidÊ shaykh in the Sulaym§niyya lodge in Damas-cus fifteen years after his death, following #AbdülÈamÊd II’s conso-lidation of power. He fitted in with the Sultan’s sufi policy throug-hout his reign and was able to preserve, and even fortify, his positionin the days of the Young Turks. Under these two regimes ‘§Èib editedand published the fundamental expositions of the Kh§lidiyya sub-order, as well as his own writings. These appeared in two separateperiods, one during the first half of the \\amÊdian regime, when hewas establishing his position within the order, and the other duringthe First World War, when the opportunity arose again to demon-strate his loyalty to the Ottoman rulers. ‘§Èib’s rivals in Damascuscontended that his books were written for him by others, and theenormous gap between the traditional, and at times unintelligiblestyle, of his early writings and the readable modern style of the la-ter ones suggests that their claims were not unfounded.8 In any case,8 Q§simÊ, Ta#ãÊr al-Mash§mm, p. 57—on the biography of his father from thebeginning of the \\amÊdian period; MuÈammad Kurd #AlÊ, Al-Mudhakkir§t (4 vols.Damascus, 1948-1951), vol. 3, p. 979—on his later writings.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM109"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"chapter four110all the writings that carry ‘§Èib’s name reflect his opinions, thusenabling us to examine in detail his views on the course of theKh§lidiyya in the last part of the Ottoman period.

On the other hand,the information we have on As#ad al-‘§Èib’s life is extremely limi-ted. There is no genuine biography and almost no references to himin the biographical dictionaries of Damascus or of the Kh§lidiyya.Therefore, we are obliged to rely on the haphazard details that appearin the historical writings of the period and, especially, on those thatare found scattered in his own writings. We must also not forget that‘§Èib’s statements need to be treated with special caution since, likethose of his model, Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ, they were intended toprove his genealogy and virtues, as well as the merits of the orderhe claimed to head, rather than simply to record his life and teachings.As#ad al-‘§Èib based his authority within the NaqshbandÊ orderfirst and foremost on his father, who died when he was merely ele-ven. He mentions his affinity to him on the two occasions in whichhe discusses his sufi guides. In the first, written at the beginning ofhis career in the 1880s, As#ad relies on the NaqshbandÊ principle ofspiritual transmission to claim that he was educated by the “spiri-tuality” of his father.9 In his writings from the First World War, bycontrast, he maintains that he eventually took from him the path.10This discrepancy becomes even more pronounced when ‘§Èib re-fers to his actual guides in the Kh§lidiyya. According to his earlyversion, he took the path from Shaykh #AlÊ al-KharbåtÊ of Kurdis-tan.11 In the later writings, however, ‘§Èib claims to have had sixmasters, two of them acting as his practical guides and the other fouradding their blessing.

On the one hand, hereopened the old question of Shaykh Kh§lid’s succession in orderto refute the claim of the Kh§nÊs. On the other hand, he elevatedthe status of his father, MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib as the deputy most deser-ving to succeed his brother, and concomitantly demonstrated his owndirect link to him.‘§Èib opened his attack on the Kh§nÊs by challenging the rightto the leadership of #Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ, who, as will be remembe-red, had been nominated as head of the Kh§lidiyya during theepidemic of 1827 and subsequently had appointed MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the elder as his successor in 1832. ‘§Èib argued that Ism§#Êlal-GhazzÊ’s testimony about Kh§lid’s naming of Her§tÊ as second toAn§r§nÊ in his list of successors before his departure to the Hijaz wascontrary to his explicit testament and therefore unreliable. He pointedout that a single witness is unacceptable from the shari#a point ofview, and that the testimony of GhazzÊ, who presented himself asthe fourth successor even though he was not a deputy, was particu-larly suspect. In ‘§Èib’s opinion, An§r§nÊ did not nominate any khalÊfato succeed him, since Kh§lid had already fixed the order of hissuccessors, and it was unlikely that his foremost deputy would defyhim. ‘§Èib could thus conclude that Her§tÊ had no right to headthe ãarÊqa and that, consequently, the claim of the Kh§nÊs, who re-lied on him in their chain, was invalid.21 He further maintained thatMuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the elder was not a khalÊfa of Shaykh Kh§lidhimself, but only of An§r§nÊ. Accordingly, he poignantly assailedIbr§hÊm FaßÊÈ al-\\aydarÊ, his contemporary from Baghdad, formaintaining that Kh§nÊ filled the place of Kh§lid (q§\"im maq§m) inDamascus. ‘§Èib stressed the fact that in the testament only foursuccessors were mentioned and Kh§nÊ was not among them. He alsorejected \\aydarÊ’s claim that Kh§lid nominated trustees (awßiy§\")rather than successors, which in ‘§Èib’s view was designed only toelevate the status of his uncle, #Ubaydall§h al-\\aydarÊ, who was notmentioned in the testament.22Since his father was not mentioned among the successors in ShaykhKh§lid’s testament either, As#ad al-‘§Èib sought to establish his rightto head the order mainly on their family connection. He claimed20 Q§simÊ, Ta#ãÊr al-Mash§mm, p. 57.21 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, pp. 62-65.22 ‘§Èib, Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyya, pp. 82-83.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM112"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"the struggle for supremacy113that MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib was the first, and favorite, deputy of hisbrother, and that he had vigorously defended him against his rivalsin Sulaym§niyya. After receiving from Kh§lid full authorization(khil§fa muãlaqa) the other deputies had acknowledged MaÈmåd’s highrank and many came to study with him.23 At the same time, As#adtried to bring into relief his father’s superiority over #Abdall§h al-Her§tÊ. According to him, when Her§tÊ arrived with Shaykh Kh§lid’swife and son in Sulaym§niyya, after his banishment from Damas-cus, MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib accommodated them and let Her§tÊ replacehim in his lodge.24 A little later As#ad went on to argue that beforehis death Kh§lid had sent to his father his sufi frock, explicitly no-minating him as his substitute (n§\"ib man§b) in the order.25 Finally,to demonstrate his own status in the Kh§lidiyya, As#ad al-‘§Èibargued that his father had nominated him as his successor three daysbefore his death.26 The need to emphasize the relationship betweenthem underlay his above-mentioned contention that his educationwas continued thereafter spiritually. On another occasion As#adfurther maintained that in this same manner he completed the sufipath under his father’s guidance, as he had promised him at the ageof nine. As#ad’s claim that the first appearance of his father to himoccurred during his stay in the NaqshbandÊ lodge in Istanbul in 1880indicates that this “discipleship” was connected with his efforts toregain MaÈmåd’s position in the Sulaym§niyya lodge.27As a contender for the leadership of the Kh§lidiyya, As#ad al-‘§Èibtoo was much occupied with the r§biãa. Unlike his predecessors,however, he dealt with this practice not as an instrument for theconsolidation of the ãarÊqa, in accordance with Shaykh Kh§lid’s ori-ginal intention, but rather in order to defend the very legitimacy ofits use. The assault on the practice of r§biãa originated at this timeamong the adversaries of the Kh§lidiyya, who sought to exploit itas a means of undermining the order’s claim to strictly adhere tothe Prophet’s example. The attack began in 1881, when Nu#m§nKhayr al-DÊn al-AlåsÊ, the founder of the SalafÊ trend in Baghdad,raised a tendentious question concerning its validity to ‘iddÊq \\asanKh§n, the leader of the Ahl-i \\adÊth movement in India, with whom23 ‘§Èib, Når al-Hid§ya, p. 25; Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 71.24 ‘§Èib, Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyya, p. 57.25 Baghd§dÊ, Al-\\adÊqa al-Nadiyya, p. 72, including the text of the letter in Persian.26 ‘§Èib, Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyya, p. 84.27 Ibid., pp. 31-33.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM113"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"chapter four114he had become acquainted three years earlier.28 Is the r§biãa sanc-tioned by the Qur\"an and the sunna, AlåsÊ asked, or is it merely aninvention and a discretion amounting to a kind of idolatry andmisleading. \\asan Kh§n’s response was unequivocal. He argued thatthis is a reproachable innovation which must be treated like all otherinnovations introduced into Islam by the sufis without a basis. In hisview, any intermediary placed between man and God injures thepurity of belief in His unity.29In the book he compiled in defense of the r§biãa against its newdetractors, As#ad al-‘§Èib depicted this practice as the essence of thekhatm al-khw§jag§n prayer, which was the focus of his own activity asa NaqshbandÊ shaykh. “The secret of the meeting”, he maintains,“is the binding of the hearts (irtib§ã al-qulåb) to one another, startingfrom an authorized master, hand on hand, and concluding with thestringer of the pearls of this chain... Abå Bakr al-‘iddÊq, who re-ceived it from the Master of the Two Worlds [MuÈammad], closinghis eyes and kneeling in the famous cave” [during the hijra]. In thisway “human perfection constitutes a mirror of the Prophet’s per-fection and this constitutes a mirror of the divine perfection. Goddoes not manifest himself even to the most perfect but through theveil of the perfection of MuÈammad, the great intermediary (al-w§siãaal-#uím§), without whom it is impossible to attain... This perfectioncan be realized by following in his footsteps and by the love of hisCompanions, deputies and inheritors of his states.”30 The purposeof the r§biãa is thus to draw power through the accomplished masterfrom the Prophet, and consequently from God. The essence of As#adal-‘§Èib’s rejoinder to the criticism of ‘iddÊq \\asan Kh§n is, the-refore, that binding the heart directly to God is impossible. In ‘§Èib’sopinion, the belief in a direct connection implies that God resem-bles men somehow, as the anthropomorphist (mujassim) claims, or thatHe is everywhere, as those who espouse incarnation or pantheism(ÈulålÊ or jahmÊ) maintain. However, for the believers who regard Godas unrelated to place, similar to nothing, and the opposite of wha-tever occurs to the mind, the r§biãa is essential. After all, it is not-hing but absorption (istighr§q) in the vision of something which hasno equal and cannot be conceived or imagined.

Acknowledging its abandon-ment by most Kh§lidÊ shaykhs, ‘§Èib avoids mentioning that the onlyaccomplished guide is Kh§lid himself, and that it is incumbent uponthem to instruct their disciples to raise in their imaginations his fi-gure alone.32 This withdrawal apparently derived from his apprecia-tion that the conventional understanding of spiritual attachment toa shaykh would be easier to defend. Moreover, in plain contradic-tion to Kh§lid’s teaching, ‘§Èib goes on to argue that the r§biãa, andthe entire khatm al-khw§jag§n, is not an integral part of the path, butonly a recommended practice that is beneficial in removing sinfulthoughts and preventing distraction from God. Therefore, it is es-sential only for the beginner on the sufi path, who still has not re-leased himself from the fetters of temptations and wicked thoughtsthat impede the presence of his heart during the dhikr.33 Ultimately‘§Èib even agrees that the r§biãa itself is a distraction from God.Raising the figure of the accomplished master in the imagination isa means to remove all other worldly things, before fleeing from thisimage too. Thus there is no fault in practicing the r§biãa, since meansare judged by the ends and since what the shari#a does not forbid isallowed.34 In a similar manner, ‘§Èib retreats from the second or-ganizational novelty introduced by Shaykh Kh§lid in the NaqshbandÊpath, the khalwa. He reduces it to the seclusion in a separate placefor concentration that is practiced among the sufi orders in general.‘§Èib remains faithful only to the novelty of ghalq al-b§b, which inhis view turns the Kh§lidÊ prayer into a kind of seclusion in itselfand secures its purity.35However, despite this retreat from the obligation to perform ther§biãa, As#ad al-‘§Èib spared no effort in defending this central practiceof the Kh§lidiyya against its detractors. He sought to provide it withthe broadest foundation, both in the sayings of the great sufi mas-31 Ibid., pp. 62, 65.32 Ibid., pp. 5, 23.

As there is a general consensus that the NaqshbandÊ orderis part of orthodox Islam, he contends, its practices must also beaccepted. In apparent contradiction to this reasoning ‘§Èib also statesthat “we must not seek evidence for the noble r§biãa at all, since theexample of the practicing #ulama and knowing saints whom we imitate(qalladn§) is a sufficient and complete proof, just as in the case of thegreat mujtahids... Those who imitate them must not examine theirproofs.”36This apparent contradiction leads us to the core of As#ad al-‘§Èib’sresponse to the critics of the r§biãa, and of his entire religious out-look. ‘§Èib frequently stresses the orthodox character of the Naqsh-bandiyya by reiterating Shaykh Kh§lid’s call to learn the preceptsof the Law and the doctrines of belief within the framework of theschools. His endeavor to base the validity of the sufi path itself onthe jurists’ practice of taqlÊd, however, clearly contradicts the Naqsh-bandÊ reformist spirit, which allowed Kh§lid not only to introducenovelties in the spiritual methods of his master in the order but evento deviate from the way of the forefathers when the need arose.Realizing that the criticism of the r§biãa was directed not only againstthe Kh§lidiyya, but against later Muslim tradition in general, sufiand legal alike, ‘§Èib retorted by stressing its orthodoxy to theexclusion of reform. From such a restrictive viewpoint of the latter-day heritage, quoting the opinions of early authorities became in itselfthe evidence. Thus, like Kh§lid, ‘§Èib sought to forge an alliancebetween the #ulama and the sufis. In the realities of his time, howe-ver, the purpose of this alliance could no longer be to guide the rulerson the traditional path of the shari#a. It was rather designed to enlistthe support of the state in defending that notion of the shari#a thatsustained the traditional men of religion against pressures to accom-modate it to the modern world.‘§Èib’s arguments against the emerging SalafÊ trend were thenrepresentative of what under the Islamic policy of #AbdülÈamÊd IIcame to be regarded as the orthodox view. At the root of the con-troversy lay the question of whether the #ulama in their schools andthe sufis in their orders reflect the original path of the Prophet, or36 Ibid., p. 37.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM116"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"the struggle for supremacy117rather a deviation that must be corrected by a return to the sourcesthemselves, the Qur\"an and the sunna. Viewed from another angle,this was the question of whether the latter-day men of religion arecapable of properly understanding the sources, or are they ratherbound to accept the judgements and guidance of the authoritative#ulama and sufis of the past. The r§biãa, as a practice of the mostorthodox order epitomized the larger debate that only began to beformulated between the orthodox and the reformers in Islam. In‘§Èib’s view, the criticism of AlåsÊ and \\asan Kh§n “derived fromtheir excessive self-esteem and from their claim to exert ijtihad... thosewho make such a pretentious argument will listen to no one, not evento the knowing (#§rif). On the contrary, they are accustomed to vainlyblame the Muslims in what they are not, and believe that they thuswill win God’s favor.”37 ‘§Èib depicts \\asan Kh§n as a fanaticpolemicist, and misses no opportunity to remind Nu#m§n that hisfather, MaÈmåd Shih§b al-DÊn al-AlåsÊ, was a faithful adherent ofKh§lid and unreservedly supported the r§biãa.38 The son’s turningagainst the Naqshbandiyya, ‘§Èib adds, betrays his Wahh§bÊ ten-dencies, which are tantamount to a war with God.39The doctrinal roots of As#ad al-‘§Èib’s struggle with the Kh§nÊslay in their affinity to the Damascene group of #ulama who hadadopted the opinions of \\asan Kh§n and AlåsÊ, though in the caseof the r§biãa itself MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ certainly could not share theircriticism. On the other hand, ‘§Èib’s reliance on the power of thestate was ultimately destined to fill the place of the r§biãa as the meansto secure his supremacy over the Kh§nÊs in the Kh§lidiyya, theo-retically in the entire order, though practically only in Damascus itself.Under the autocratic regimes of #AbdülÈamÊd II and, following him,the Young Turks, his call met with a welcome response.The Decline of the Local BranchDespite As#ad al-‘§Èib’s challenge, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the youngerremained the principal Kh§lidÊ shaykh in Damascus even after the37 Ibid., pp. 27-28.38 See especially ibid., pp. 8, 17-18, 83-84; idem, Al-Fuyå·§t al-Kh§lidiyya, p. 82.On Shih§b al-DÊn al-AlåsÊ see ch.8; and the letter of Shaykh Kh§lid to him in ‘§Èib,Bughyat al-W§jid, pp. 255-256.

Subsequently, #Abd al-MajÊd pursuedhis studies with his father and with the latter’s two outstanding teach-ers, MuÈammad al-•anã§wÊ and #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, special-izing in the sciences of Sufism and hadith.41 He was also a talentedpoet, who composed not only praise songs for the mighty in thetraditional manner but also poems on themes of the Muslim pastwhich betrayed his own views.42 #Abd al-MajÊd began to teach in theMur§diyya mosque during his father’s lifetime, serving also as hisdeputy in the family lodge and as a preacher.Following the ascension of the new Sultan to the throne in 1876,#Abd al-MajÊd al-Kh§nÊ set out to Istanbul, apparently at his father’sinstruction, to ensure that the position of the family would not becompromised.

He returned to Damascus a short time later with assuranc-es that the family’s hold on the Mur§diyya mosque and its allow-ance would be continued. Nevertheless, in accordance with ShaykhKh§lid’s teaching, and his own family’s tradition, #Abd al-MajÊd wascareful to shun official posts, with the sole exception of serving brieflyunder a qadi who had befriended his father.43 He preferred to ded-icate his energies to the affairs of the ãarÊqa and to writing.

It alsoincluded a discussion of jihad, which Kh§nÊ proclaimed was a fun-damental element of the religion. He exhorted the believers to un-dertake it, stressing that when the enemy dominates a Muslim coun-try, as was the case with an increasing number of Ottoman provincesin #Abd al-MajÊd’s time, it becomes a duty incumbent upon eachindividual. In Shaykh Kh§lid’s footsteps, he concluded his epistle witha prayer for the victory of the Commander of the Faithful (amÊr al-mu\"minÊn), Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II, and his army.44The other works of #Abd al-MajÊd al-Kh§nÊ were dedicated toexpounding and further developing the doctrines of the Naqsh-bandiyya order. Already at the conclusion of his biographical dic-tionary, Kh§nÊ asserts that the three major foundations of the pathare silent recollection (dhikr), binding of the heart (r§biãa), and clos-ing the door (ghalq al-b§b).45 Thus, with the two organizational nov-elties that Kh§lid introduced into the ãarÊqa to strengthen its integ-rity and uniqueness, he lists not the khalwa, the third novelty whichwas designed to facilitate its spread, but rather the special form ofdhikr used in the spiritual training of those who already belong to it.The absence of the forty-day seclusion in this list, and eventually inall of #Abd al-MajÊd’s writings, testifies to the shift that had occurredin the activity of the Kh§nÊ branch of the Kh§lidiyya under his father,from spreading the path among all Muslims to a spiritual engage-ment in the sufi teaching among the elect. Moreover, in his discus-sion of the silent dhikr, #Abd al-MajÊd is not satisfied, like his grand-father, with demonstrating its great effectiveness.

Against ‘§Èibhe maintains that this practice is more effective than the dhikr in gen-erating divine rapture (al-jadhba al-il§hiyya) and ascendance on thepath of perfection (ma#§rij al-kam§l). Thus he places it on a higherlevel than the dhikr in general and the khatm al-khw§jag§n in particu-lar.

Like the latter, he is prepared to compromise on the valid-ity of the r§biãa, while in regard to the SalafÊs he prefers to considertheir arguments against it as a scientific mistake in this particularmatter rather than as an all-out attack on the NaqshbandÊ path.47Kh§nÊ’s emphasis on the practice of closing the door reflects, bycontrast, his criticism of those Kh§lidÊ shaykhs who tended to aban-don it. Avoiding specifying them by name, he focuses his attackinstead on the descendents of Abå Sa#Êd al-MujaddidÊ, the succes-sors of Sh§h Ghul§m #AlÊ in Delhi, who migrated to the Holy Citiesin the wake of the Indian Mutiny of 1857.48 Here they performedthe dhikr in the open, often provoking the indignation of spectators.Sh§h Ghul§m #AlÊ himself did not practice the ghalq al-b§b, Kh§nÊadmits, but only because in his special lodge no stranger was allowedto intrude.49 From his point of view it was thus the MujaddidÊs whostrayed from Ghul§m #AlÊ’s path and not Kh§lid.In his manual for the Kh§lidÊ “brothers” published in 1896, #Abdal-MajÊd al-Kh§nÊ reasserts his adherence to these three major foun-dations of the Naqshbandiyya. While discussing the r§biãa, however,he attacks a related practice that is not mentioned in any of the otherKh§lidÊ sources, namely, observance of the form of the living shaykhwho stands between the disciple and the figure of Kh§lid (mul§Èaía).Refraining from specifying in this case too who were the Kh§lidÊ46 Ibid., pp. 290-29547 Ibid., pp. 295-297.48 David W.

The r§biãa isa connection between man and God and any additional intermedi-ate connections could only damage the disciple.50 The decline of the Kh§nÊ family began between 1890, followingAs#ad al-‘§Èib’s decision to openly press his claim to the leadershipof the Kh§lidiyya, and 1896, when #Abd al-MajÊd al-Kh§nÊ’s sec-ond visit to Istanbul fully revealed the extent to which his family hadlost favor with the authorities. Applying for an increase in the al-lowance assigned to the Mur§diyya mosque, which had shrunk toalmost half its original value, #Abd al-MajÊd succeeded in securing,after spending more than a year in the capital, only a special addi-tion for the lifetime of his father. Even this achievement proved tobe worthless when MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ died shortly after his son’sreturn to Damascus.51 When #Abd al-MajÊd dispatched his youngerbrother to Istanbul to collect the last allowance due to their father,he found that it had already been transferred to somebody else.52MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ’s death in 1898 further exposed the weak-ness of the Kh§nÊ branch of the Kh§lidiyya. It led to fierce strug-gles among members of the family over his succession in the nexttwo years, and revealed their growing dependence on the state. Thisweakness was fully exploited by As#ad al-‘§Èib to realize his claimto head the Kh§lidiyya in Damascus. As the elder son and a closeassistant of his father, #Abd al-MajÊd seemed to be the most suitablecandidate to inherit his position in the Mur§diyya mosque. As a tokenof continuity he commenced his hadith lessons from the point atwhich his father stopped, and invited many dignitaries, including thenewly-appointed \\anafÊ mufti, ‘§liÈ Qaãan§, to the first lesson. Atthe same time, #Abd al-MajÊd presented an official application forhis father’s position and allowance. Duly confirmed by the provin-cial council and the qadi, the application was sent to Istanbul forapproval. At this point it became known, however, that his uncleAÈmad, who had been forced to serve for many years outside Damas-cus in the shari#a court system, had returned claiming the positionfor himself.

An acute conflict ensued between these twocontenders, and #Abd al-MajÊd began to conduct the dhikr early inthe morning before AÈmad would arrive to perform it during theprescribed time. Finally, with Qaãan§’s mediation, the two reacheda compromise according to which they divided the administrationof the lodge and its allowance between themselves.53When shortly after reaching this solution AÈmad al-Kh§nÊ diedtoo, #Abd al-MajÊd was confident that the appointment in theMur§diyya mosque would finally pass into his hands. He soon dis-covered that there was another contender for the position, his uncle#Abdall§h. Unlike AÈmad, #Abdall§h was not a Kh§lidÊ shaykh, buton the basis of his brother’s precedent he too could claim that, as ason of MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the elder, his right surpassed that ofhis grandson. The man who encouraged #Abdall§h to make this claimwas the head of the rival branch in the order, As#ad al-‘§Èib.

It seems that to a large extent heremained a foreigner in the city, and that he derived his status mainlyfrom the patronage of the governors.

Mostof them were descendents of those religious men whom ‘§Èib re-ferred to as the disciples of his father.57 Like him, they also provedto be avowed opponents of the Salafiyya.The most conspicuous date in the rise of the Ottoman—ortho-dox tendency in Damascus was 1887, when the post of the \\anafÊmufti of the city was assigned to MuÈammad al-ManÊnÊ (1836-1898).The youngest member in the first generation of the new Ottomantendency that emerged in Damascus under the Tanzimat regime,ManÊnÊ was the scion of a religious family which had traditionallyheld the prestigious post of teaching hadith under the Nasr dome inthe Umayyad mosque. In the beginning of the nineteenth centuryhis father was obliged to surrender the post, owing probably to in-competence, and it was transferred to Sa#Êd al-\\alabÊ, who had ar-rived in the city a few years earlier.58 ManÊnÊ was able to regain itin 1860, after #Abdall§h al-\\alabÊ, the son and successor of Sa#Êd,had been banished for his alleged part in the massacre of the Chris-tians. Like other #ulama of the Ottoman tendency, he was not con-tent with this appointment, aspiring to complement it with one ofthe new positions created by the Tanzimat. ManÊnÊ therefore joinedthe state judiciary, first as a member in the court of appeals andsubsequently as head of the criminal court. In the latter capacity heserved for fifteen years, until his appointment as mufti of Damascusfollowing the demise of his predecessor, MaÈmåd \\amza, one ofthe leading reformist #ulama in the city during the late Tanzimatperiod. The new appointment indeed caused great disturbance amongthe local religious circles, and the controversy did not abate evenafter its confirmation by the Shaykh al-Isl§m.59 For the \\amÊdianregime, however, \\amza’s death supplied with an opportunity totighten its central authority on Damascus and to consolidate theposition of the supporters of its policy against those who favored thecontinuation of the late Tanzimat reforms. ManÊnÊ served as muftifor a decade, until his death, and he duly received state decorations,though his intelligence and religious learning were far inferior to thoseof his predecessor in the office.6057 See ch. 3.58 On the father, AÈmad al-ManÊnÊ, see BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 238-239;\\ißnÊ, pp. 640-641; on Sa#Êd al-\\alabÊ see pp. 63-64.59 BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 311, 1185.60 \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp. 157-161.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM124"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"the struggle for supremacy125MuÈammad al-ManÊnÊ’s name appears at the head of the list of#ulama who lent their praise to As#ad al-‘§Èib’s book in defense ofthe r§biãa.61 He also played a central role in the “mujtahids incident”of 1896, the first encounter between the orthodox and the SalafÊs inDamascus, to be discussed in Part Three. In his regular functioningas a mufti, ManÊnÊ relied heavily on MuÈammad al-BÊã§r (1816-1895),who had been appointed as amÊn fatw§ already in the early 1860s.The son of \\asan al-BÊã§r and a disciple of MuÈammad AmÊn #$bidÊnin \\anafÊ jurisprudence, MuÈammad belonged in his views to thelocal tendency of Damascus, but since he declined luxury and pub-licity it was convenient for ManÊnÊ to retain him in his office.62 Ofthe other four #ulama whom he appointed as his assistants threebelonged to the Usãuw§nÊ family, whose reviver, Sa#Êd, is mentionedby As#ad al-‘§Èib as a disciple of his father. The fourth, #Abd al-MuÈsin al-Mur§dÊ (d. 1913), was the last notable scholar in this il-lustrious family.63 To this group of Ottoman—orthodox #ulama maybe added here the only Damascene #alim whom ‘§Èib explicitly refersto in his writings as his friend, Jam§l al-DÊn al-KhaãÊb (1867-1918),the son of Abå al-Khayr who “studied” with his father too.

He succeeded his father as preacher in the Umayyad mosqueafter his death in 1890, and is reported to have frequently visitedIstanbul.64Yet, the emergence of the Ottoman—orthodox tendency inDamascus returns to the beginning of the 1880s. Its earlier and mosteloquent exponents, along with As#ad al-‘§Èib, were two brothers,‘§liÈ and #$rif al-Munayyir, the nephews of MuÈammad al-Mu-nayyir, who had also been included in the list of MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib’s“disciples”. Their father, AÈmad (1812-1885), was a prominent #alimin late Tanzimat Damascus, who owing to his vast knowledge ofSh§fi#Ê jurisprudence, acquired partially at the al-Azhar mosque andin Mecca, gained the honorific title of “the small Sh§fi#Ê” and a teach-ing post in the Umayyad mosque.

Unlike his brother MuÈammad, AÈmad al-Munayyirwas disposed to piety and asceticism, and he distanced himself fromgovernment positions. He was also engaged in the sufi path, thoughit is not recorded to which order he belonged.65AÈmad’s path seemed to be followed by the most promising ofhis sons, ‘§liÈ al-Munayyir. ‘§liÈ (1850-1903) studied with his fa-ther and with other prominent reformist #ulama of the late Tanzi-mat period and, as a token of their appreciation, he began to teachduring their lifetime when he was merely twenty, in both the Umayy-ad mosque and in the Ikhna\"iyya college. Later, he joined the edu-cational society that •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ headed under the patronageof the reformist governor MidÈat Pasha in 1878-1880, and took partalso in laying the foundation to the £§hiriyya library.66 Neverthe-less, in 1882 ‘§liÈ al-Munayyir decided to abandon the path of hisfather and, following his uncle MuÈammad, link his fortunes withthe Ottoman administration. Like As#ad al-‘§Èib, he departed forIstanbul and returned with a new appointment in the Umayyadmosque, that of teaching the hadith collection of Q§·Ê #Iy§·. Thiscollection, which focused on traditions enumerating the duties of thebelievers toward the Prophet, seems to have been particularly suit-able for the religious propaganda of his “khalÊfa”, #AbdülÈamÊd II.67‘§liÈ visited Istanbul on a few more occasions, forging connectionswith its notables, and gaining decorations and an allowance fromthe Sultan. Moreover, while in the capital he contacted Abå al-Hud§al-‘ayy§dÊ and became his deputy in the Rif§#iyya order in Dam-ascus.68 ‘§liÈ’s loyalty to the \\amÊdian policy was expressed also bystudying the principal tenets of Judaism and Christianity, with theobject of demonstrating the superiority of Islam over them.

The first was a defense of the HijazRailway project, which was promoted by AÈmad #Izzat al-#$bid, theDamascene close confident of #AbdülÈamÊd at that time. The sec-ond work was a collection of Prophetic traditions arguing the dutyto fully obey the Caliph, largely on the model of Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ.

The rejoinder, which con-stitutes the second part of the treatise, is supported by numerousquotations from the Qur\"an and the sunna. Landau, who publishedthe manuscript, suggests that the idea to compose it came from theOttoman authorities rather than from Munayyir himself, thus ex-plaining the detailed information which he incorporated in the de-scription of the hajj caravan in the book’s first part.73 The heart of70 Ibid., p. 118; M§liÈ, Fihris Makhãåã§t, vol. 1, p. 14.71 Yåsuf Ali§n SarkÊs, Mu#jam al-Maãbå#§t al-#Arabiyya wal-Mu#arraba (Cairo, 1342-1347/1923-1929), pp. 1258-1259.72 For a list of #$rif al-Munayyir’s works see \\ißnÊ, pp. 756-759.73 Jacob Landau, The Hejaz Railway and the Muslim Pilgrimage: A Case of OttomanPolitical Propaganda (Detroit, 1971), pp. 22-23.

Hemaintains that at the root of the hajj lie two factors—first, the var-ious advantages (man§fi#) it brings by fostering connections betweenMuslims from all over the world and by encouraging economiccooperation between them; and second, the high merit of recollect-ing God’s name (dhikr) along its course.74 Thus he can demonstrate,in an echo of the NaqshbandÊ-Kh§lidÊ spirit, that Sufism is fullycompatible with mundane considerations, and accordingly give re-ligious sanction to modernization. Munayyir is highly critical of thoseSufis who believe that trust in God (tawakkul) implies avoidance ofwork and of seeking livelihood. For him such an interpretation wasmerely a disguise for idleness and hypocrisy, though he by no wayrejects trust in God as such, nor spiritual effort, asceticism, or se-clusion. On the contrary, Munayyir greatly admires those sufis whopractice them sincerely, those who “cut off their hopes in what isnot God and adhere to His firm bond (al-#urwa al-wuthq§), until Godreleases them from the need for other than Himself.” The combi-nation of trust in God and work was the path of the forefathers (al-salaf al-‘§liÈ) who, according to Munayyir’s definition, are the sufishaykhs and their like, who worked for their living and shunned thepublic treasury.75The second treatise which #$rif al-Munayyir composed in Istan-bul was designed to support #AbdülÈamÊd II’s claim to the Caliphate.76He directed it specifically against the Young Turk opposition, de-picting them as rebels who strive to bring division and disintegra-tion among the Muslims, though his object was undoubtedly morecomprehensive, to discredit all of the Sultan’s adversaries. This trea-tise also reveals that Munayyir’s sufi attachment was above all to theteaching of Ibn #ArabÊ. His combination of scripture and Sufismbecomes apparent right from the outset in his discussion of the natureof the Caliphate. On the one hand, Munayyir relies on the Qur\"anand the hadith to maintain that the Caliph, as the deputy of theProphet, is deputy on behalf of God. On the other hand, he reverts74 Ibid., pp. 226-229; pp. 84-89 in the manuscript.75 Ibid., pp. 219-220; pp. 97-98 in the manuscript.76 #$rif al-Munayyir, Al-\\aqq al-MubÊn fÊ AÈ§dÊth Arba#Ên fÊman Kharaja #an •§#atAmÊr al-Mu\"minÊn wa-Shaqqa #Aß§ al-MuslimÊn (Asad Library, manuscript no. 8618,1318 A.H.).1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM128"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"the struggle for supremacy129to Ibn #ArabÊ’s assertion that the visible Caliph (í§hirÊ) is the deputyof the hidden one (b§ãinÊ), who is the pole of his time (quãb al-waqt).There must always be such a pole, since by its merit the world exists,and therefore there must always be a Caliph. The two may by unitedin one person, as was the case with the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, butthey may also be two different persons, the visible Caliph representingthe hidden one without even knowing it. The visible Caliph is forMunayyir the imam of the Muslims, their Sultan, and their com-mander.The scriptural “divine appointment” and the Akbarian “externalCaliphate” are the two foundations of #$rif al-Munayyir’s argumentsin favor of the various aspects of #AbdülÈamÊd II’s Islamic policy.The very right of the Sultan to the Caliphate is based upon thedominant principle in the traditional political theory of Islam thatit is incumbent upon Muslims to appoint an imam in order to se-cure the implementation of the shari#a. Munayyir is more emphaticin justifying #AbdülÈamÊd’s pan-Islamic policy, stating that the ummamust have only one imam. For that purpose he uses the notion oftawÈÊd al-im§m, which naturally raises the connotation of the unityof God, and claims that political plurality, like polytheism, gener-ates corruption and inner strife, thus leaving the Muslims prey totheir enemies. The might of the European powers he explains, ac-cordingly, by their unification behind their rulers.The main part of Munayyir’s exposition is dedicated, however,to demonstrating the obligation of all believers to absolutely obeythe Caliph, the ultimate object of #AbdülÈamÊd II’s Islamic policy.On the basis of his concept of the divine appointment, he claims thatthe pledge of allegiance to the Sultan (mub§ya#a) is tantamount to apledge of allegiance to God. It is binding on every individual in thecommunity, and does not depend on the imam’s application of jus-tice. Quoting sufi sources, Munayyir adds that it is moreover obliga-tory to glorify the imam, since he is a manifestation (maíhar tajallÊ)of God’s rule, as demonstrated by the famous hadith which assertsthat “the Sultan is God’s shadow on the earth.” Therefore, it isincumbent upon all members of the umma to obey the imam, withthe condition that his orders do not contradict the shari#a. Thisobligation, Munayyir claims, is explicitly mentioned in the Qur\"anand the sunna, particularly by the phrase ålÊ al-amr in the verse: “Obelievers, obey God, and obey the messenger and those in author-ity among you.” Unlike Ibn #$bidÊn, who believed that “those in1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM129"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"chapter four130authority” refers to the #ulama, or As#ad al-‘§Èib, who regarded themas the sufis, Munayyir argues that these are the rulers themselves,the imams and their representatives. His principal authority is againIbn #ArabÊ, who included in this category both the sufi poles (aqã§b),and the political rulers (khulaf§\" and wul§h), claiming that in legal termsobedience to them is merely permissible, but that after accepting theirauthority their orders become binding. Thus, the conclusion thatMunayyir sought to convey was that “obedience to the amir is obe-dience to God and His messenger, and rebellion against him is re-bellion against God and His messenger.” #$rif al-Munayyir’s demand for full obedience to Sultan #Ab-dülÈamÊd II was fortified by considering two complementary obli-gations which supported his measures of centralization. One is theinjunction to avoid actions that fall under the authority of the imamwithout obtaining his authorization; the other is the call to serve himhonestly and sincerely. Both obligations are directed toward thefunctionaries of the state, revealing thereby that Munayyir was notunaware of the faults of the \\amÊdian centralized system of govern-ment. Thus, in parallel with his general demand of obedience, hedeclares that deceiving and betraying the Sultan is tantamount todeceiving and betraying God and His messenger, as well as the entireumma. Returning at the conclusion of his treatise to the Young Turksand other adversaries of #AbdülÈamÊd, Munayyir maintains thatdelivering state secrets to foreigners is one of the gravest forms oftreason, and that the capital punishment inflicted on some of themis, therefore, fully justified.The Young Turk Revolution of 1908, and particularly the dep-osition of #AbdülÈamÊd II in the following year, drove the #ulama ofthe Ottoman—orthodox tendency in Damascus to close their ranksand exploit the new freedom of expression to issue their own jour-nal, al-\\aq§\"iq. Appearing monthly for three years (1910-1912), thejournal served as the mouthpiece of these men of religion in theirdefense of traditional practices and beliefs, and in their struggleagainst the SalafÊ and Westernizing trends.77 Al-\\aq§\"iq’s owner andeditor was #Abd al-Q§dir al-Iskandar§nÊ (d. 1943), a prolific writerand an instructor in the Umayyad mosque who belonged to theextended Kayl§nÊ family.78 The list of its contributors included sons77 The following analysis is based on Commins, pp. 104-105, 118-122.78 On #Abd al-Q§dir al-Iskandar§nÊ see \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp. 573-574; MuÈam-1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM130"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"the struggle for supremacy131to the families of Munayyir, Usãuw§nÊ, and KhaãÊb, who continuedto head the Ottoman—orthodox tendency of Damascus even in thisperiod.

His analysis focuses on the jour-nal’s assimilation of some of the SalafÊs’ symbols, its points of diver-gence with them, and its conflation of the SalafÊs with the Western-izers. Thus, according to him, two of the central symbols borrowedby the Ottoman—orthodox #ulama of the Young Turk era from theirSalafÊ rivals were the call to adhere to the path of the salaf and theiradvocacy of progress. Our examination of the activities and writ-ings of these #ulama has shown, however, that the ideas which un-derlie these symbols had become prevalent among them already atthe turn of the century, concomitant with #Izzat al-#$bid’s rising toprominence in Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II’s court. In their orthodox in-terpretation, these symbols were nothing but the call to rely on theQur\"an and the sunna as practiced in traditional Muslim learning,on the one hand, and to unreservedly confirm the course of mod-ernization as defined by the state, on the other. The claim of theorthodox #ulama to adhere to the path of the salaf, or to have adoptedthe ideal of progress, as well as their depiction of Islam as a religionof civilization (madaniyya) and consultation (shår§), therefore, pointsto their integration into the modern discourse, rather than to anychange in their basic outlook. Their use of this new discourse merelyserved to reaffirm their readiness to harness orthodoxy to the ser-vice of the state also under the Young Turk regime.This continuity in the thought of the #ulama of the Ottoman—orthodox tendency becomes even more striking when their mainpoints of controversy with the SalafÊs are scrutinized. These #ulamacontinued to preach an Islamic unity embodied in the person of theSultan—Caliph, despite his loss of actual rule over the Empire. Theywere also adamant in rejecting ijtihad, ceaselessly calling for theimitation of the rulings of one of the four established legal schools,which in their view supplied suitable solutions for the modern situ-ation too. In one particular sphere, however, the orthodox #ulamaclearly deviated from their path in the \\amÊdian period. Accord-ing to Commins’ analysis, it seems that Sufism was conspicuouslyabsent from the pages of al-\\aq§\"iq. This absence reflected the badmad Riy§· al-M§liÈ, Al-#All§ma MuÈammad Sa#Êd al-Burh§nÊ: Arba#ån #$man fÊ MiÈr§bal-Tawba (Damascus, 1967), p. 34.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM131"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"chapter four132reputation that the orders in general, and the teaching of Ibn #Ar-abÊ in particular, received at that time owing to the role they hadplayed in the autocratic regime of #AbdülÈamÊd II.

Some of the most virulent attacks published in al-\\aq§\"iq against the SalafÊs were indeed related to their depiction aspartners in a destructive plot to impose Western culture and prac-tices on Muslim society, revealed above all in their campaigns in favorof foreign education and the removal of the veil. From their pointof view, the Ottoman—orthodox #ulama saw no substantial differ-ence between the trends that adopted rationalism, the Westernizersand the SalafÊs.In the Service of the Committee for Union and ProgressThe centralist policy which the Committee for Union and Progresspursued following the deposition of #AbdülÈamÊd II in 1909, andparticularly the rigid military regime that Jam§l Pasha imposed onSyria during the First World War,79 drove many #ulama of theOttoman—orthodox tendency to adopt Arabism and, in some cas-es, also to join the Salafiyya. This trend was clearly discernible inthe case of the KhaãÊb and Usãuw§nÊ families. First among them toadopt the new course was probably Jam§l al-DÊn al-KhaãÊb, As#adal-‘§Èib’s closest friend in the 1880s. Visiting Istanbul, KhaãÊb wasshaken by the policies adopted by the CUP, and began to incite theyoung Arabs who were then studying in the capital, including someof his nephews, to insist on their freedom and rights. During the FirstWorld War, he was charged with agitation against the state and wasbanished to Basra.80 Most prominent among the nephews who wereinfluenced by his call was MuÈibb al-DÊn al-KhaãÊb (1886-1969), whosubsequently immigrated to Egypt and became a leading figure inboth the Salafiyya and the Arab nationalist movement.81More conservative members of these families also gradually shiftedto the Arabist cause.

These are clearly evident in the series ofarticles which he published in 1915-1916 under the title “Announce-ment of the Hidden Secret.” ‘§Èib’s stated purpose in those articleswas to contribute to the war propaganda of the Ottoman State, andto arouse the Muslims, particularly the Arabs, to join the jihad pro-claimed against the Entente Powers. In one article he states that whenthe Muslim nation is attacked “the blood of Islamic zeal and patrioticfervor (al-ghayra al-Isl§miyya wal-Èamiya al-waãaniyya) must gush in itsveins.” The object of the enemy, ‘§Èib exclaims, is to destroy Islamand the Muslims, to silence the voice of the Qur\"an, and to pene-trate Mecca and Medina, as well as Istanbul, the last bastion. In suchcircumstances every believer must sacrifice himself in the army of“the deputy of God’s messenger, the constitutional warrior Sultan(al-gh§zÊ al-dustårÊ)[!]...The defender of the abode of Islam, and theguardian of the religion and the pure shari#a... Who takes pity onhis subjects like a compassionate father toward his only child.” 87The major theme that engaged As#ad al-‘§Èib in his later writ-ings, however, was again the defense of latter-day Muslim tradition,and particularly its sufi component, against its modern detractors.Here too, ‘§Èib reformulated his essential opposition to the Salafiyyain accordance with the new form adopted by the orthodox #ulamain the Young Turk era. “In the same manner that God conferredhis favor upon the forefathers (the salaf)”, he asserts, “He conferredHis favor upon their successors (the khalaf). The divine bounty hasnot ceased and the divine munificence can never end... Those wholimit the favor of God to certain people and to a certain generationwithout basis in the Qur\"an and the sunna deny the undeniable favorof God.”88 ‘§Èib’s enmity toward his SalafÊ rivals was indeed un-bounded. “You who designate yourself as the proponents of religiousreform (rij§l al-ißl§È al-dÊnÊ)”, he addresses them in another article,“the example of whom do you want us to follow?

In his eyes, as in the eyes of the #ulama who con-tributed to al-\\aq§\"iq before him, it seemed to be part of the largerrationalist assault which the imitators of Western civilization weremounting against Islam particularly after the rise to power of theYoung Turks. ‘§Èib too saw no real difference between the SalafÊs,who integrated the rationalist attitude into their religious thought,and the Westernizers, who compromised their religion in the nameof rationalism. Therefore, again in the footsteps of the other con-servative #ulama, he appropriated in his argument against both groupsthe notion of adherence to the path of the salaf and the ideal ofprogress. These elements are particularly conspicuous in a long articlewhich ‘§Èib dedicated to this subject under the title “On Civiliza-tion” (al-Madaniyya). Ostensibly a rejoinder to Lord Cromer’s offen-sive contention that Islam is averse to civilization, he seeks to dem-onstrate that no religion equals Islam in its drive to improve thecondition of men.90 ‘§Èib’s wrath is focused on those Muslims whogrew up on imitating Western ways and despising their own culture:Look at these young Westernizers, who pretend to support culture andpose as noble and comely intellectuals, those philosophers of history,great sociologists, and conceivers of outstanding opinions and ideas.They place glasses on their noses, knock with their sticks, dip in per-fumes, and adorn themselves with chains and watches of pure gold...When they accept an invitation to a meal and the time for prayerarrives, they amuse themselves by smoking cigarettes and putting oneleg over the other.

He depicts them as hypocrites whoprofess to love their fatherland, but nonetheless serve the Europeanpowers which seek to dominate it. In ‘§Èib’s view, the Arab nation-alists bring about division in the Muslim community, using some-times the name of Arab brotherhood and, at others, those of admin-istrative decentralization or religious reformism. He remonstratesagainst them that, although they are aware of the Islamic prohibi-tion to preach racial and tribal solidarity, they prefer to overlook itin their quest for posts, salaries, and ranks from the enemies of thestate and the fatherland. In ‘§Èib’s view, Arabism was thus justanother expression of the Westernizing and SalafÊ trends.92The reliance of the Westernizers and the SalafÊs on rationalismleads As#ad al-‘§Èib to examine theology, the branch of orthodoxscholarship that has applied it the most. ‘§Èib’s discussion of thisscience constitutes an important component in his introduction toShaykh Kh§lid’s collection of letters, which he published in 1916.Theology, it will be recalled, played a major role in the teaching ofKh§lid, who at the beginning of the nineteenth century had soughtto base the activism of his sub-order on the concept of kasb (acqui-sition). ‘§Èib returns to it, almost a century later, for the more basicobject of demonstrating the validity of the fundamental tenets of thefaith. The principal role of theology in the rationalist era has be-come for him to protect the hearts of the followers of the path fromthe doubts and temptations that this has generated. ‘§Èib thus fol-lows in Kh§lid’s footsteps in his demand from the sufi adepts toamend their beliefs and fortify their certainty in the unity of God inaccordance with the opinions of the orthodox theologians, the Ash#arÊsand the M§turÊdÊs. Yet, in the face of the rationalist assault, he ex-tends this basic demand to include the amending of the belief in theexistence of God according to the law of the forefathers (q§nån al-salaf al-‘§liÈ), as those authoritative scholars had interpreted it. Inthis respect, ‘§Èib confronts the theologians who formulated theorthodox doctrines with the Mu#tazila, the historical expression ofthe rationalist trend in Islam which MuÈammad #Abduh, the leaderof Islamic Modernism in Egypt, revived at the end of the nineteenth92 Ibid., pp. 87-88.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM136"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"the struggle for supremacy137century, rather than with the Wahh§bÊs, whom he generally regardsas the forebears of the Salafiyya.93Another important element in the teaching of the Naqshbandiyya–Kh§lidiyya that As#ad al-‘§Èib emphasizes in his polemics againstthe rationalists is the Mal§matiyya. He employs this tradition in aneffort to conceal the activity of the sufis not only to ensure theirsincerity, as its original object had been, or to direct them towardsocial and political affairs, as the Naqshbandiyya understood it, butalso to hide them from the eyes of their modern opponents. Thusin harmony with the traditional NaqshbandÊ stress on the importanceof #ilm, and with his own desire to ally with the #ulama, ‘§Èib ad-mits that the masters of the order regarded religious scholarship asthe best cover for the follower of the path. Yet in the face of thecontemporary rationalist attack on Sufism, which greatly intensifiedhis tendency to rely on the government, he makes the claim that aneven better cover for the follower of the NaqshbandÊ path is the robeof the rulers. The #ulama may be suspect of treading the sufi path,‘§Èib writes, but no one would harbor such suspicions about rul-ers. Therefore, whoever takes up the form (ßåra) of a ruler, whileconducting a life (sÊra) of piety and imitation of the saints, combinesthe two favors and only God shall know his secret.94This argument in favor of a combination of the sufi path andpolitical authority had precedents in the activity of the originalNaqshbandiyya of Central Asia. In As#ad al-‘§Èib’s case, however,it merely reflected his unreserved readiness to harness the Kh§lidÊsub-order to the service of the CUP even under the military regimeof Jam§l Pasha. In reward for his services, ‘§Èib gained officialsupport in his claim to head the order in principle, and for his ac-tivity in Damascus in practice. This support is evidenced in hisconclusion to Shaykh Kh§lid’s collection of letters, in which hebeseeches God to bestow victory in the war to the Sultan—Caliph,MuÈammad Rash§d, and to help his ministers, “particularly the Headof State (‘§Èib al-dawla), AÈmad Jam§l Pasha, the commander of theFourth Army and of the exalted fleet, who exerted much effort to encour-age the scholars to publish such a book.” [my emphasis].95 At that time,and despite the hardships of the war, ‘§Èib’s seat in the Sulaym§niyya93 ‘§Èib, Bughyat al-W§jid, pp. 32-33, 52-53, 61.94 Ibid., pp. 34-36.95 Ibid., p. 311.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM137"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"chapter four138lodge was lavishly renovated.96 This striving to acquire the patron-age of the state was indeed the most salient feature in As#ad al-‘§Èib’scareer as a NaqshbandÊ–Kh§lidÊ shaykh, though by adopting it heclearly deviated from the injunction of Kh§lid to maintain a supe-rior distance from rulers. Its roots lay in the failure of the r§biãa, inthe sense that Kh§lid accorded it, to serve as a means to integratethe order, on the one hand, and in ‘§Èib’s own foreign status inDamascus, on the other. To compensate himself for these weaknesseshe sought to establish a functional connection with the state. Thiscourse was delineated for him already in the early Tanzimat periodby his father, MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib, who advocated service to rulers whoseek to implement the orthodox principles that the Naqshbandiyyapropagated. In the hands of his son, who was acting under the au-tocratic regimes of #AbdülÈamÊd II and the Young Turks, regimeswhich turned orthodoxy into a tool for building their state, what re-mained of this functional bond was nothing but service to the rulersfor personal benefit.The other side of As#ad al-‘§Èib’s reliance on the patronage ofthe autocratic regimes of the late Ottoman Empire was his readi-ness to abandon the organizational novelties of Shaykh Kh§lid and,eventually, the emphatic orthodox path of the Naqshbandiyya in itsentirety. This readiness amounted to betraying the distinctive fea-tures of his order within the general sufi framework. ‘§Èib expressedhis desire to seek a common denominator with the other orders,particularly the popular ones that were patronized by #AbdülÈamÊdII and, after a brief interlude, also by the Young Turks, by placingthe sufi path on a higher rank than the acquired sciences of juris-prudence and theology. He thus violated the fundamental combi-nation, which Shaykh Kh§lid embodied, between the “two wings”of the external sciences (#ilm) and the mystical practice (#amal). Theaxis of the NaqshbandÊ path, ‘§Èib maintained, was the realizationof a perfect belief in God, His messenger, and what was transmit-ted from them. This genuine belief, he claims, is divided in the teach-ing of the Naqshbadiyya into three parts: first comes the belief thatGod inscribed with a spiritual light in the hearts of the faithful uponcreating them (Êm§n i#ã§\"Ê), to be followed by confirmation (taßdÊq) ofthe reality of God’s unity and the Prophet’s words, and finally by96 Kurd #AlÊ, Khiãaã al-Sh§m, vol. 6, p. 142; AÈmad Qud§ma, Ma#§lim wa-A#l§mfÊ Bil§d al-#Arab (Pt. 1: al-Quãr al-SårÊ, Damascus, 1965), p. 186.1-4.p659/19/00, 12:51 PM138"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"the struggle for supremacy139the confession (iqr§r) with the tongue rendered by the testimony offaith. ‘§Èib emphasizes that only the combination of these three kindsof belief makes it genuine, but their order, and the use of the termÊm§n solely for the first kind, make it clear that in his eyes the truthrevealed by the sufi path supercedes the others. Knowledge withoutspiritual work (#ilm bil§ #amal), and such work without sincerety (#amalbil§ ikhl§ß), he concludes, are useless and might even do harm.97As#ad al-‘§Èib was well aware of his deviation from the teachingof Shaykh Kh§lid. This is clearly evident in the contrary path hetook in his writings from the Young Turk period to prove his rightto head the order. In plain contradiction to the position he had adopt-ed in his earlier writings, ‘§Èib now claimed that Kh§lid had re-frained from specifying who should succeed him, and that the fourdeputies who were mentioned in his will were nominated only tosecure its implementation. Kh§lid’s only expressed wish, accordingto ‘§Èib, was that the deputies would not diverge from the opinionof Ism§#Êl al-An§r§nÊ.98 This new argument implied that the right tolead the order must be derived from other sources, thus enabling‘§Èib to bypass the will altogether and attach his father in an inde-pendent way to Kh§lid’s master, Sh§h Ghul§m #AlÊ. He now assert-ed, accordingly, that MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib received the path from AbåSa#Êd al-MujaddidÊ, Ghul§m #AlÊ’s successor in the NaqshbandÊ lodgein Delhi, who appointed him as his brother’s deputy at the head ofthe Kh§lidÊ sub-order. Abå Sa#Êd, As#ad added, supplied his fatherwith a written authorization, urging him to treat Kh§lid’s otherdeputies and disciples properly and to take care of his son’s educa-tion.99 It is reasonable to assume that MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib met Mu-jaddidÊ while in Mecca, when the Indian shaykh performed thepilgrimage in 1834,100 and it is also possible that the latter gave himhis blessing. Yet, it is highly improbable that Abå Sa#Êd chose to in-terfere in the affairs of the Kh§lidiyya, contrary to the will of ShaykhKh§lid himself, and, moreover, that ‘§Èib would have refrained tillthen from exploiting such a strong argument in his struggle againstthe Kh§nÊs, if indeed it was true. The attachment of his father toAbå Sa#Êd al-MujaddidÊ was tantamount to a claim of superiority overthe other shaykhs of the Kh§lidiyya.

Thistendency was already evident in ‘§Èib’s early writings, where hecompromised the obligatoriness of Kh§lid’s organizational noveltiesin the r§biãa and the khalwa. By connecting his father with Abå Sa#Êdal-MujaddidÊ and his successors soon thereafter, ‘§Èib retreated alsofrom the third novelty of “closing the door”. It was thus to him that#Abd al-MajÊd al-Kh§nÊ’s denouncement of the MujaddidÊs for per-forming the dhikr ceremony in Mecca in the open was directed. UnlikeKh§nÊ, ‘§Èib was ready to admit that ghalq al-b§b was an innova-tion in the path. He justified Kh§lid’s introduction of this practicewith his typical reference to the religious sciences, claiming that hehad followed the jurists’ method in adjusting the rulings of the greatmujtahids to the circumstances of their own time.102 This justifica-tion implied, however, that with the change of circumstances anothergreat master might introduce other novelties in the path of theKh§lidiyya. There is no doubt that ‘§Èib, at least by force of hisclaim to be Shaykh Kh§lid’s successor in the leadership of the order,regarded himself as entitled to make such amendments. The favor-able conditions under which the sufi orders were allowed to oper-ate during the autocratic regimes of #AbdülÈamÊd II and the YoungTurks supplied him with the opportunity to implement them. Thechanges that ‘§Èib claimed to effect in the Kh§lidÊ order amountedhowever, paradoxically, to a withdrawal from its distinctive path with-in the sufi framework in general, and from the Naqshbandiyya–Mu-jadiddiyya in particular, on the one hand, and to its unconditionalharnessing to the service of the Committee for Union and Progress,on the other.

He himself acknowledgedthis role in his claim to be the “seal of the saints”, whose mission itwas to preserve the spiritual deposit of sacred knowledge and blessingfor future generations destined to live under even harsher conditions.3Ibn #ArabÊ was one of the most prolific writers the Muslim worldhas ever produced.4 Among his hundreds of works two hold a spe-cial place: Al-FutåÈ§t al-Makkiyya (The Meccan Revelations), hismagnum opus which was conceived during the hajj from the vision ofa “young man” (fat§) representing his own essential being; and Fußåßal-\\ikam (The Bezels of Wisdom), a resume of his ideas written to-ward the end of his life in Damascus with the inspiration of MuÈam-mad.5 Any study of al-Shaykh al-Akbar’s writings is bound to en-counter formidable difficulties. These derive not only from Ibn#ArabÊ’s wide-ranging peculiar synthesis of earlier intellectual and spi-ritual traditions, but also from the paradoxical and enigmatic lan-guage he used, which was ultimately meant to function as a mirrorfor each individual reader.6 Among Muslim scholars, these writingsprovoked also a deep controversy. The attack on Ibn #ArabÊ, laun-ched in earnest by Ibn Taymiyya and amounting to his denuncia-tion as a heretical monist, concentrated on the condensed and elu-sive Fußåß al-\\ikam.7 A close examination of the more comprehensiveand diffuse Al-FutåÈ§t al-Makkiyya, however, reveals that his thoughtwas basically a meticulous, though unbound by reason, literal inter-pretation of the scriptures. Ibn #ArabÊ regarded the Qur\"an as a sourceof infinite divine secrets that are revealed in an unceasing flow to3Michel Chodkiewicz, Seal of the Saints: Prophethood and Sainthood in the Doctrineof Ibn #ArabÊ (Cambridge, 1993), pp. 13-14; idem, Ocean Without Shore: Ibn #ArabÊ, theBook, and the Law (Albany, 1993), pp. 17-18.4The fundamental inventory of his works is Osman Yahia, Histoire et classifi-cation de l’oeuvre d\"Ibn #ArabÊ (2 vols.

He therefore refused to accept any limitation on theexertion of ijtihad, and rejected the legal experts’ resort to the con-trary method of taqlÊd. Though clearly influenced by the £§hirÊ school,which had a considerable following in the Muslim West at the timeand which relied on a strictly literal understanding of the Qur\"an,Ibn #ArabÊ regarded the rulings of all legal schools as equally valid.He himself was actually an independent mujtahid, whose two gui-ding principles were that whatever the shari#a does not explicitlyforbid is permissible, and that when various solutions are possiblethere is no harm in choosing the most accommodating one. The legalexperts of his day, al-Shaykh al-Akbar depicted as restricting andforbidding within their schools actions that God in His mercy hadallowed to be performed in various ways (ittis§#).10The polemics against his ideas notwithstanding, Ibn #ArabÊ’steaching left a profound mark upon the development of latter-daySufism, in both its “intellectual” and “popular” forms.

This immanent interpretation of themystic experience entailed shunning public affairs, which were leftto the care of the rulers, blurred the distinction between Islam andother religions, particularly in those areas where it was continuingto spread through the work of sufi missionaries, and generally un-dermined the notion of heresy. In the seventeen and eighteenthcenturies, as central authority in the great empires progressivelydeclined, groups of reformers came to stress other aspects of Ibn#ArabÊ’s teaching. For them, the focus of “the unity of being” shif-ted to “the reality of MuÈammad” (al-ÈaqÊqa al-MuÈammadiyya),another important element in al-Shaykh al-Akbar’s thought, signi-fying the Prophet’s place in the one Being as the Perfect Man, throughwhom all creatures emanate and through whom they can draw nearto God.15 With this new emphasis, the mystic path tended to beco-me identified with the duty to follow the sunna of the Prophet andto adhere to the shari#a which God had conveyed through him. Thistranscendental interpretation of Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching reflected thegrowing inclination among contemporary men of religion to be moreinvolved in public affairs, as the example of the Prophet required,and to stress the distinction between Muslims, who accepted hismission, and followers of other religions, who rejected it. Concomi-tantly, these men of religion developed a renewed interest in the worksof Ghaz§lÊ.16This new stress in the interpretation of Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching wascongruent with the views of the Kh§lidiyya, the leading reformistorder in Damascus in the first half of the nineteenth century. Naqsh-bandÊ interest in the doctrines of al-Shaykh al-Akbar goes back tothe mother order in fourteenth-century Central Asia.17 AÈmad Sir-hindÊ, however, who was disturbed by the pantheistic interpretationof waÈdat al-wujåd, substituted it with waÈdat al-shuhåd, the testimony15For the notion of the MuÈammadan Reality in the AkbarÊ teaching seeChodkiewicz, Seal of the Saints, pp. 60-73; \\akÊm, Al-Mu#jam al-‘åfÊ, pp. 347-352;Cornell, pp. 205-211.

Yet, SirhindÊ too ack-nowledged the immense contribution of Ibn #ArabÊ to the develop-ment of Sufism in general, and to the shaping of his own ideas inparticular. He tried to defend his more controversial expressions bydemonstrating their compatibility with orthodox views, or at timesby comparing them with the errors of the mujtahids in their legalrulings.18 In the MujaddidÊ sub-order, SirhindÊ’s Maktåb§t largely cameto replace the writings of Ibn #ArabÊ. This was probably also theattitude of Shaykh Kh§lid, who generally ignored al-Shaykh al-Akbar’s theosophy, though his library contained works by him andby QånawÊ.19 Among Kh§lid’s deputies in Syria, where the tradi-tion of Ibn #ArabÊ had remained alive since the days of N§bulusÊ,al-Shaykh al-Akbar’s influence was much more pronounced. ThusMuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ quoted him often in his exposition of theKh§lidÊ path, and AÈmad al-Urw§dÊ of Tripoli belonged to theAkbarÊ chain of authority.20 In the second half of the nineteenthcentury, moreover, a genuine AkbarÊ awakening became noticeableamong the #ulama of Damascus.

Joining thereturning caravan for Damascus, the two met Shaykh Kh§lid, whoperformed the hajj that year too. Kh§lid let them enter the Naqsh-bandÊ path, passing them on in his usual manner to one of his de-puties, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ.

He did not perform the forty-day seclusion with ShaykhKh§lid himself, however, and if he took the NaqshbandÊ path at allit was more by way of blessing. Thereafter the two continued to Bagh-dad, to visit the tomb of #Abd al-Q§dir al-JÊl§nÊ and renew theirattachment to his order.23 Upon their return to Algeria it becameevident that #Abd al-Q§dir was attracted to the sufi theoretical ex-positions, particularly those of Ghaz§lÊ, rather than to the practicalaspects of the path. The other field of study that drew his particularinterest was hadith.24#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s sufi—religious background was clearlyevident in the way he led for fifteen years the jihad against the Frenchinvaders. In the independent state that he established in the inte-rior of the country, #Abd al-Q§dir strictly enforced the shari#a andsought to bring about moral regeneration by returning to the spiritof the Qur\"an and to the simple ways of the forefathers. He orderedto perform the five daily prayers in public and entirely prohibitedgambling, drinking, and smoking. To the tribes that had surrende-red to the French, he issued a fatwa, urging them to immigrate (hij-ra) to areas that remained under Muslim control.25 At the root of#Abd al-Q§dir’s conduct of jihad lay his unmistakable ascetic pro-pensity.

Contrary to the stipulations of the treaty sig-ned with him, #Abd al-Q§dir was taken under guard to France.

In the wake of the 1848revolution #Abd al-Q§dir’s situation deteriorated, as his large entou-rage was separated from him and he was allowed almost no contactwith the outside world. In this period of disillusionment and despairhe went through an acute spiritual crisis, which led him to theteaching of Ibn #ArabÊ.27 The new attitude that #Abd al-Q§dir adoptedtoward Western civilization in consequence of his experience inFrance became apparent after his release by Napoleon III in 1852.He now participated in various official events and enjoyed conver-sing with generals and scientists. To Louis Napoleon he promisedthat, “now I am among those who use the pen, not those who usethe sword.”28 While on a visit to Paris during the Crimean War, #Abdal-Q§dir took part in a prayer of thanksgiving in the Church of NotreDame, and expressed his admiration for the technical innovationshe saw in the international exhibition then taking place in the Frenchcapital.29 On the other hand, in Bursa, where it was agreed that #Abdal-Q§dir would settle after his landing in the Ottoman Empire, hebegan to teach along with hadith also the ideas of Ibn #ArabÊ.30 Thisnew occupation was fully revealed after his immigration to Damas-cus at the end of 1855.26Pessah Shinar, “#Abd al-Q§dir and #Abd al-KrÊm: Religious Influences ontheir Thoughts and Actions,” AAS, 1 (1965), pp. 139-160.27Jaz§\"irÊ, TuÈfat al-Z§\"ir, pp. 514-530; Jaw§d al-Mur§biã, Al-Taßawwuf wal-AmÊr#Abd al-Q§dir al-\\asanÊ al-Jaz§\"irÊ (Damascus, 1966), p. 18.28Ibid, pp. 562-566.29Charles Henri Churchill, \\ay§t al-AmÊr #Abd al-Q§dir, al-Sulã§n al-S§biq li-#Arabal-Jaz§\"ir (Tunis, 1971), pp. 275-276.30The book #Abd al-Q§dir taught in Bursa was “Kit§b al-IbrÊz”, which recordsthe discussions between the Moroccan shaykh #Abd al-#AzÊz al-Dabb§gh and theauthor, his disciple, AÈmad ibn Mub§rak al-LamãÊ.

A group of #ulama had soonassembled around him, meeting daily for the study of Qur\"an andhadith according to the AkbarÊ method. In 1862 #Abd al-Q§dirdeparted for the pilgrimage, passing on his way through Egypt, wherehe was a special guest of the Khedive. In Mecca he received a simi-lar welcome by the SharÊf, #Abdall§h Pasha, before turning to themain purpose of his journey, to tread the sufi path.39 #Abd al-Q§dirchose as his guide Shaykh MuÈammad al-F§sÊ of the MadanÊ branchof the Sh§dhiliyya, and under his guidance dedicated himself to astrict spiritual training. Swiftly traversing the stages and states of thepath, he reached the goal on Mount \\ir§\", in the cave in whichMuÈammad himself made his retreats before receiving the mission.40Subsequently, #Abd al-Q§dir continued to Medina, spending anotherperiod of seclusion at the Prophet’s tomb, during which his visionsintensified. He made a second pilgrimage to Mecca and then retur-ned to Damascus, again via Egypt, this time also joining theAlexandria lodge of the Free Masons.41 In 1870 #Abd al-Q§dir senttwo of his senior disciples to collate the copy of Al-FutåÈ§t al-Mak-kiyya he used with the manuscript of the author preserved in Ko-nya. He continued to teach it according to their findings until theend of his life. #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ was then buried, accordingto his own wish, at the side of al-Shaykh al-Akbar in the ‘§liÈiyyacemetery.42For a fuller understanding of the significance of the spiritual changethat #Abd al-Q§dir underwent during his captivity in France, andparticularly for an explanation of the AkbarÊ awakening which hegenerated in Damascus, we must now turn to the analysis of hiswritings.39#Abd al-Q§dir, Like his spiritual master, Ibn #ArabÊ, was among those sufisthat the Naqshbandiyya defines as the elect by whom the rapture (jadhba) prece-des the treading of the path (sulåk). #Abd al-Q§dir agreed with the NaqshbandÊsthat the path of jadhba is shorter, but regarded the path of sulåk as superior andmore complete and therefore decided to undertake it at such a late phase of hislife.

Michel Chodkiewicz, the eminent scholar of Ibn #ArabÊ, has al-ready given us a preliminary survey of #Abd al-Q§dir’s spiritual bi-ography and some guidelines to his mystical teaching, includingtranslation of excerpts from his writings. In this chapter I attemptto examine this teaching more systematically through the prism of#Abd al-Q§dir’s main contribution to the modernization of the AkbarÊthought, namely his redefinition of the relationship between mysti-cism and rationalism in Islam.The principal source for the examination of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s teaching is his three published books, to which can be addedhis replies to questions of various Muslim scholars and French sci-entists. These writings are divided into two entirely different types.The first two books, which #Abd al-Q§dir had completed before hisarrival in Damascus, are of a rationalist character. The first wascomposed while he was still confined in France as a rejoinder to theaccusations of a Catholic priest who worked in Algeria concerningthe supposed immorality of Islam. The main part of this treatise, how-ever, is its extensive introduction, which was designed to prove theexistence of God and the reality of prophethood by way of reason.1The second treatise was composed four years later in Bursa in re-sponse to the request of a French scientific committee that haddesignated him as representative of the Muslim nation. Reiteratingcontentions made in the previous book, #Abd al-Q§dir added a newintroduction arguing in favor of rational thinking and a conclusionenumerating the merits of scientific writing.2 Both books are writ-1#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, Al-Miqr§· al-\\§dd li-Qaã# Lis§n Muntaqiß DÊn al-Isl§mbil-B§ãil wal-IlÈ§d (Beirut, n.d.).2Idem, Dhikr§ al-#$qil wa-TanbÊh al-Gh§fil (Beirut, 1966). This work appearedin French as early as 1855, and in a reedition in 1858, under the title Rappel àl’intelligent, avis à l’indifférent.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM155"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"chapter five156ten in simple language and pursue logical arguments. #Abd al-Q§dirrelied in them on Muslim scholars who had shown a propensity forrationalism, particularly Ghaz§lÊ, and occasionally also on classicalGreek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s third book is focused entirely on Su-fism. This is a vast collection of mystical interpretations of Qur\"anverses and hadith sayings that bears unmistakably the imprint of Ibn#ArabÊ. Its last part contains in addition elucidation of difficult pointsin the writings of al-Shaykh al-Akbar in response to disciples’ que-ries. These interpretations were experienced by #Abd al-Q§dir asmystic revelations, and they reflected the ripening of his spiritual con-science during the last part of his life in Damascus. He depicted themas maw§qif, the stops between the stations on the sufi path. Not de-signed for publication, a first edition of this book appeared only twen-ty years after #Abd al-Q§dir’s death. The passages have no titles,normally opening with a quotation of the Qur\"anic verse, the ha-dith, or the phrase of Ibn #ArabÊ, that is to be interpreted. There isalso no logical sequence between them, and they contain numerousrepetitions, and even contradictions, since as mystical experiencesthey were not bound to logical consistency. These passages are allwritten in associative language, deriving from the ecstatic states #Abdal-Q§dir was experiencing at the time of their giving. The Maw§qifconstitute thus unique evidence for his sufi thought in its making.3Yet, despite the very different character of the rational and themystical writings of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, they were basically twoaspects of the same teaching. #Abd al-Q§dir evidently regarded histwo first books as an explanation suitable for the level of understan-ding of the common people, Muslims as well as adherents of otherreligions, as to the merits and limitations of the rationalist approachunderlying Western civilization. These writings constitute, therefore,the external aspect of his teaching. #Abd al-Q§dir’s collection ofmystical passages, on the other hand, reflect the task he felt to hadbeen imposed on him to shape the religious elite that would preser-ve the fundamental truths of the Muslim faith in the developing crisisof European supremacy. These writings thus constitute the inneraspect of his teaching. As a sufi of the AkbarÊ school, #Abd al-Q§dirviewed these two aspects as the two opposite standpoints from whichthe truth may be beheld: the divine standpoint, which is attained by3Jaz§\"irÊ, Kit§b al-Maw§qif.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM156"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience157means of mystical experience, and the human standpoint, which isacquired through logical judgment based on perception. As Westernhistorians trained in a rational mode of inquiry rather than in oneof mystical experience, we can thus conclude that his sufi teachingin the Maw§qif is an elaboration and completion of the ideas whichhe expressed at the onset of his new path in his rationalist writings.We may, therefore, turn first to an examination of the rationalistdimension in the thought of #Abd al-Q§dir, in the light of which wewill then proceed to analyze the parallel aspects in his mysticalteaching.The Rationalist ChallengeBy proving the existence of God and the veracity of the teachingsof the prophets by way of reason, #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ soughtto integrate his profound religious faith with the rationalist mode ofthinking underlying the achievements of the West. This object hadtwo aspects. On the one hand, #Abd al-Q§dir strove to demonstrateto the French rationalists and their Muslim followers that man asindividual, and human society at large, cannot attain perfection solelyby reason, and that the teachings handed down by the prophets are,therefore, indispensable. This aspect is predominant in the treatisehe wrote while still in prison in France. On the other hand, #Abdal-Q§dir was anxious to convince his coreligionists of the necessityto abandon the practice of blind imitation which so pervaded theirscholarship in the latter generations and to make use of their ownreason, as the Europeans did. To this end he attempted to demon-strate the basic unity of all religions and the universality of science.This aspect appears first in the treatise he wrote after his settlementin the Ottoman Empire.#Abd al-Q§dir’s point of departure is to explain the essence andnature of rational thinking. Attributing great importance to the in-tellect (#aql), he defines it with four interrelated meanings. Accordingto the first and most fundamental of them, #aql, the quality whichdistinguishes man from all other creatures, represents his predispo-sition (isti#d§d) to comprehend theoretical sciences and acquire prac-tical skills. Using sufi imagery, #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ likens it toa light which is cast into the heart and make it capable of percei-ving. The following two definitions view #aql as knowledge, either of2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM157"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"chapter five158self-evident facts which man perceives intuitively or those he acqui-res by experience. The final meaning of #aql, which refers to its object,establishes its relation to faith. This is man’s inner recognition of theconsequences of his deeds and his suppression of the instinct to seekimmediate gratification. #Abd al-Q§dir was of the opinion that allknowledge exists a-priori in the mind, though it needs a specific causeto be revealed. Along with the merits of rational deliberation, how-ever, he also dealt with its deficiencies. Like light produced by fire,reason mixes with the smoke of doubt and is easily extinguished.4Turning to the notion of knowledge (#ilm), #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊregards it in its various aspects as the fruit of rational thinking, theobject of man’s creation, and his greatest and purest pleasure. Inaccordance with Muslim tradition, he describes man as holding amiddle position between the angels and the animals. The pursuit ofknowledge and good deeds (#ilm wa-#amal) elevates man to the first,while turning his energies to satisfy his bodily desires brings him downto the level of the second. #Abd al-Q§dir vigorously attacks those whoturn entirely to this world. In his view, they will never attain theirgoal since it is a bottomless sea and since every achievement onlyawakens the desire for yet another one. On the other hand, #Abdal-Q§dir objects to a complete shunning of worldly affairs. Thevarious sects that have followed this course, he explains, have goneto extremes such as suicide and self-mortification, or permissivenessand heresy. The recommended path is the middle way of taking fromthis world as much as one needs while subjecting his desires to theguidance of reason and law.5 The middle way should also governhuman social order. #Abd al-Q§dir maintains that, “the goals of menare attained by integrating their religious and worldly affairs (intií§mal-dÊn wal-duny§).” Society’s multiple needs produce a division of laborunder a leadership (siy§sa), which is essential for cooperation in thepursuance of livelihood. #Abd al-Q§dir, like Ibn #$bidÊn before him,accepts accordingly Ghaz§lÊ’s division of leadership into two kinds:one of kings and sultans, who govern the external matters of all theirsubjects; the other of the #ulama, who govern the inner lives of theelite.6Having clarified the importance of rational thinking for man and4Jaz§\"irÊ, Al-Miqr§· al-\\§dd, pp. 10-18; Idem, Dhikr§ al-#$qil, pp. 49-51, withomission of the last sentence.5Jaz§\"irÊ, Al-Miqr§· al-\\§dd, pp. 26, 39-40; Idem, Dhikr§ al-#$qil, pp. 39-45.6Idem, Dhikr§ al-#$qil, pp. 46-47.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM158"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience159society, #Abd al-Q§dir proceeds to demonstrate the existence of Godand explain how He should be conceived. His basic argument is thatthe many manifestations of creation in the universe point to theircreator. A special place is dedicated in #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’sargument to man, the microcosm, in which there is a parallel to everypart of the large world. In this review he generally relies on the ideasof ancient Muslim scholars rather than on the findings of modernEuropean science, the details of which he barely knew. At the rootof #Abd al-Q§dir’s discussion lay his admission, again followingGhaz§lÊ, of the principle of causality. “We do not admit that causesbring about effects by their own nature or abstract power”, he de-clares, “but in any other manner [that is compatible with the uni-tary belief], they are recognized.”7 From this also derives #Abd al-Q§dir’s demonstration of the validity of prophethood. When the soulcomprehends God’s greatness, he explains, it seeks a guide to showit the way to Him. Reason cannot fill this task, since it possesses noknowledge about divine reward and punishment and, therefore, isunable to distinguish between obedience and rebelliousness. For thispurpose the prophets were sent by God’s mercy. Nevertheless, inaccepting the message of the prophets, #Abd al-Q§dir again assignsa central role to reason as the only organ capable of grasping its logic.Between the rational and religious sciences there is thus not only com-plete harmony, but also interdependency. He can accordingly con-clude that, “those who preach sheer blind imitation and avoid reasonare ignorant, while those who confine themselves to reason alone tothe exclusion of the shari#a sciences are arrogant.”8In #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s second book, which was directed pri-marily to Muslims, these demonstrations are preceded by a newintroduction designed, in his words, “to encourage deliberation (naíar)and denounce blind imitation (taqlÊd).” He thus explicitly set outagainst those men of religion who made emulation the foundationof their scholarship, declaring that “the intelligent must examine whatis said rather than who said it.” #Abd al-Q§dir’s criticism of the #ulamawho practiced taqlÊd was indeed harsh. He accused them of depri-ving themselves and their coreligionists of their most importantprivilege as human beings, that of thinking. Turning to another sufisimile, #Abd al-Q§dir likened the relationship between the heart, the7 Idem, Al-Miqr§· al-\\§dd, pp. 41-48.8 Ibid., pp. 153-157; idem, Dhikr§ al-#$qil, pp. 81-84.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM159"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"chapter five160seat of intelligence according to the traditional Muslim view, andthe rational truths, to that between a mirror and the images it re-flects. Like the deficient image found in a mirror, lack of knowledgemight derive from a shortcoming in the heart itself, such as beingyoung; from the stains that build up on its surface in consequenceof engagement in worldly pursuits; from the veil of tradition acqui-red in youth by imitation; and from its direction away from thesciences. Accordingly, it is by shunning distractions that one polishesand purifies the heart and acquires the sciences which will enable itto be directed toward the truth. For #Abd al-Q§dir, like for Ghaz§lÊbefore him, the paramount obstacle to attaining the truth was be-liefs absorbed by way of tradition. From this point of view, the entirebook was designed to show how to remove this veil.9Another central theme that #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ sought to con-vey to his Muslim readers was that there is a fundamental harmonybetween Islam and Western—Christian civilization. While presentinghis arguments for the existence of God and the reality of prophet-hood, #Abd al-Q§dir repeatedly claims that the truth possessed bythe monotheistic religions is basically one. He thus defines the sciencesof the shari#a as “what was taken from the prophets by the study ofthe scriptures (kutub All§h al-munazzala)—the Torah, the Gospels, andthe Qur\"an”, while referring consistently to “the prophets” in theplural and avoiding any particular reference to MuÈammad. Further-more, #Abd al-Q§dir explicitly writes that:Religion is one by the consensus of the prophets... who are like peo-ple that have one father and different mothers. The claim that theyare all false, or that some of them are false and others true, is short-sightedness. If the Muslims and the Christians were listening to metheir differences would be removed and they would have become in-wardly and outwardly brothers. But if they do not listen to me... onlythe Messiah will remove their differences when he comes... and evenhe will not succeed in bringing about accord, though he will be ableto resurrect the dead and heal the blind and the leper, but with thesword.10Likewise, #Abd al-Q§dir emphasizes the suitability of modern science,and of the progress it generates, to all the religions. The prophets’sciences as the common people understand them, he maintains,concern what is beneficial in this world and the next. They had no9 Ibid., pp. 30-38.10 Ibid., p. 107.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM160"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience161intention to argue with the philosophers or to reject sciences suchas medicine, astronomy and geometry. The prophets’ message is, thus,perfectly congruent with such scientific findings as the roundness ofthe earth or the solar movements that cause a lunar eclipse. The pur-pose of the prophets in this respect, #Abd al-Q§dir asserts, was merelyto demonstrate that the world, whatever its details, was created byGod. Whoever claims otherwise, he admonishes the conservative#ulama, sins against religion and harms the shari#a more than do thosewho reject them. In language which reveals the close affinity betweenscience and mysticism in his mind, #Abd al-Q§dir further argues that:The fruits of thought are limitless and the uses of reason are bound-less. The spiritual world is as wide as an overflowing sea and the DivineEmanation never ceases or ends. It is neither impossible nor unrea-sonable that God reserved for some successors what he kept back frommost predecessors. The claim that the first left nothing for the lateris an error. The proper question is how much the first left for thelater... The first was rewarded in finding the roots and preparing thefoundations, and the later in deriving conclusions from these roots,strengthening the foundations and adding their own constructions.11#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s new attitude toward France is best expres-sed in the last part of his first book, when he finally arrives at hisdeclared intention to refute the accusations leveled at Islam by thatCatholic priest. This rejoinder seeks to justify the amir’s struggleagainst the French in Algeria, but is of particular interest because italso helps elucidate his cooperation with them in his exile in Syria.#Abd al-Q§dir stresses that the Prophet MuÈammad was sent as amercy to all humanity, both those who accepted his message andthose who did not. In his view, the precept of jihad does not con-tradict this claim, since its object is not to kill unbelievers, devastatetheir country, or plunder their property, but only to stave off theenemies of Islam and prevent them from harming its interests. Thismay be done by means of war, he admits, but as far as possible figh-ting should be avoided by allowing unbelievers to pay the poll tax(jizya). Moreover, #Abd al-Q§dir does his utmost to demonstrate thesubordination of jihad to moral considerations, as well as the manyrestrictions on its conduct. They are as follows: there is no duty toperform jihad in time of security; if the enemy is obviously stron-ger, the Muslims must conclude peace with him (ßulÈ); agreements11 Ibid., pp. 133-134.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM161"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"chapter five162concluded with infidels must be respected; a Muslim prisoner of warmust not try to escape; if the enemy releases a Muslim on the con-dition that he avoid fighting in the future, he must fulfill that obli-gation; if one of the Muslims promises not to hurt the enemy, all ofthem are bound to uphold that promise. #Abd al-Q§dir assures hisFrench readers that this was the conduct of the great Muslim war-riors of the past, as the example of ‘al§È al-DÊn most clearly de-monstrated, and that it is particularly true in regard of the Arabpeople. Citing Ibn al-Muqaffa#s praise of the Arabs, he claims thattheir merits were evident already at the time of the J§hiliyya, beforethese were fortified by their acceptance of Islam. On the other hand,#Abd al-Q§dir does not refrain from mentioning the negative attitu-de of this eighth-century man of letters toward the Turks,12 therebyrevealing the hatred for them he imbibed in Algeria. In the book hewrote in Bursa, he was careful of course to omit such offendingreferences.13The Fundamentals of Sufi ThoughtA convenient point of departure for the analysis of #Abd al-Q§diral-Jaz§\"irÊ’s sufi thought is the set of visions he had in Medina fol-lowing his attainment of the goal and a subsequent dream. Regar-ding the visions, #Abd al-Q§dir relates that upon reaching the tombof the Prophet and addressing him in prayer, he heard his voicesaying: “you are my son and your supplication is accepted.” Notcontent with this, #Abd al-Q§dir beseeched God to supplement it witha vision (ru\"y§). He sat himself down at the foot of the tomb andperformed the dhikr until, after losing consciousness, he saw MuÈam-mad. Following this vision the word of God came into his heart: “Givethou good tidings to the believers that they have a sure footing (qa-dam ßidq) with their Lord.”14 #Abd al-Q§dir realized that this surefooting was the Prophet and that God had appointed him, #Abd al-Q§dir, to be the means (wasÊla) of carrying the message to His pe-ople. The next vision occurred to #Abd al-Q§dir while in seclusionin the vicinity of the tomb. A sufi shaykh who came in counseled12 Jaz§\"irÊ, Al-Miqr§· al-\\§dd, pp. 188-254.13 Idem, Dhikr§ al-#$qil, pp. 159-160.14 Qur\"an, Yånus (10), 2.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM162"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience163him to direct himself to the Messenger of God through one of thegreat masters: #Abd al-Q§dir al-JÊl§nÊ, MuÈyÊ al-DÊn ibn #ArabÊ, orAbå al-\\asan al-Sh§dhilÊ. #Abd al-Q§dir promised to ask permis-sion for that, but when he performed the dhikr and once again losthis consciousness, the verse “The Prophet is nearer to the believersthan their selves”15 came down upon him. #Abd al-Q§dir then in-formed the sufi shaykh that the Messenger of God desired no inter-mediary between them, since he was nearer to him than anyone else,including himself. Another vision mentioned by #Abd al-Q§dir in thiscontext, the first revelation he had “in the world of good and light”,was an encounter with Abraham while circumambulating the Ka#ba.Abraham was telling a large audience how he had demolished theidols. #Abd al-Q§dir perceived that his love for all creatures camefrom this prophet, since most religions and sects share a love forAbraham, and this is his unique feature among the prophets.16The dream, accompanied by its interpretation, serves to comple-te and clarify this set of visions in Medina. #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊrelates that he saw Ibn #ArabÊ in the form of a lion holding a largechain in its hand. The lion commanded him to put his hand into itsmouth and he, despite his fear, complied. Thereafter, Ibn #ArabÊreturned to human form, recognized by #Abd al-Q§dir from manyprevious dreams, though this time al-Shaykh al-Akbar was like amadman (majdhåb) uttering confused words. Reiterating a numberof times that he was going to perish, he finally fell on the ground,before #Abd al-Q§dir woke up. The interpretation of this dream isvery clear. Ibn #ArabÊ’s appearance as a lion alludes to his statusamong the saints, while the chain in his hand symbolizes the shari#a.Putting his hand into the lion’s mouth signifies #Abd al-Q§dir’s re-liance on the teaching of al-Shaykh al-Akbar, for he regarded all thathe wrote as deriving from him. Ibn #ArabÊ’s confused state repre-sents the troubles of the time, in which great changes were takingplace and moderation was lost. When he said that he is going toperish, he meant to express his deep sorrow that the Muslims hadreached the point of disobeying the commandments of God and Hismessenger, and of shunning their religion.17 In another place #Abdal-Q§dir testifies that he saw Ibn #ArabÊ often in his dreams, and that15 Qur\"an, al-AÈz§b (33), 6.16 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 83, vol. 1, pp. 143-146.17 Ibid., Mawqif 346, vol. 3, pp. 68-69.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM163"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"chapter five164through this medium he studied Al-FutåÈ§t al-Makkiyya directly withits author.18The foundation of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s AkbarÊ thought lay,thus, in his strong sense of mission. The visions in Medina are ad-duced as part of his interpretation of the verse frequently revealedto him, “As for thy Lord’s blessing, declare it”.19 #Abd al-Q§dir de-fines this blessing as outward and inward knowledge (#ilm wa-ma#rifa)of God and of the concealed precepts of the prophets that ought tobe spread among those capable of understanding them. Being theProphet’s heir (w§rith MuÈammadÊ), and receiving like him inspirationfrom God by means of the Qur\"an, #Abd al-Q§dir regarded himselfas ordained to undertake this work.20 This explains why he rejectedthe mediation of the eponymous founders of the two orders thatplayed the central role in his spiritual life, the Q§diriyya, the orderof his fathers, and the Sh§dhiliyya, within which he trod the path.The same reason led #Abd al-Q§dir to refrain even from seeking themediation of Ibn #ArabÊ, upon whose theosophy he so closely relied.He also viewed himself as one of the abd§l, the seven “substitutes”who are at the feet of the prophets and sustain the seven regions ofthe earth.21 Thus, like Shaykh Kh§lid in the previous generation, #Abdal-Q§dir was motivated by a profound feeling that the umma wasin a state of serious regression and needed vigorous renovation. Yetunlike Kh§lid, he realized that this regression could not any morebe explained solely by the internal weakness of the Muslim world,but rather was principally due to the undeniable superiority achievedby the European Powers.However, as a man of religion #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ saw theprincipal danger not in the political domination of the West overMuslim countries, but rather in the rationalist challenge it posed toIslamic religious thought. In his view, the confusion that led manyMuslims to shun their religion, as alluded to in his dream of Ibn#ArabÊ, was caused by the disregard of the conservative #ulama forthe implications of Western rationalism. #Abd al-Q§dir himself cameto the conclusion that the preservation of Islam in an age of West-18 Ibid., Mawqif 372, vol. 3, pp. 367, 370-371.19 Qur\"an, al-4uÈ§ (93), 11.20 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 83, vol. 1, pp. 142-143.21 Ibid., Mawqif 372, vol. 3, pp. 365-366.

On the one hand, it was necessary to acquire the practicalsciences which provided the West with its power, and on the otherhand, rationalism had to be kept out of the religious sciences, lestlike in Europe it would lead to unbelief. #Abd al-Q§dir’s view was,thus, that the Islamic response to the Western rationalist challengemust begin with reforming Muslim orthodoxy from within. Themeans he suggested for this reform was a fresh interpretation of Ibn#ArabÊ’s legacy which, while maintaining its more recent transcen-dental stress to safeguard the integrity of the faith, revitalized its olderimmanent bent to facilitate openness toward the West. This was tobe assimilated by a religious elite capable of perceiving the signifi-cance of the changing circumstances, and of freeing itself from thetraditional chains of taqlÊd. Unlike Shaykh Kh§lid, #Abd al-Q§dir’smain interest was accordingly in the divine truth (ÈaqÊqa) and its“knowers” (#§rifån), rather than in the mystic path (ãarÊqa) and its fol-lowers (s§likån).#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ lay out the foundations of the AkbarÊ sys-tem already in the first “stop”, as the necessary background forexplaining his own mystic experiences. The sufis of our path, #Abdal-Q§dir states, do not claim to bring anything new to religion, thoughthey do possess a new understanding of it. Furthermore, they neitherrevoke the literal meaning of the scriptures, nor do they maintainthat their interpretation is the only valid one. Yet, while confirmingthe literal meaning of the scriptures, they also find in them additio-nal inner meanings. This is supported by the prophetic traditionswhich testify to the many faces of the Qur\"an, by the sufi path, andby reason. As the word of God corresponds to His all-encompassingknowledge, #Abd al-Q§dir argues, He may mean in His words notonly what the scholarly and the sufi commentators understood it tobe, but also that which did not even cross their minds. Hence, a manmay, by means of a mystic experience, generate a new interpreta-tion of a verse or a tradition, to which no one else had previouslybeen guided. In #Abd al-Q§dir’s eyes, the Qur\"an thus constitutes asource of perpetual renewal in Islam, facilitating ever new interpre-tations that do not annul the tradition, but rather add to it new layers,according to the revelations of the sufi saints in every generation.The Maw§qif of #Abd al-Q§dir are themselves such experiential in-terpretations, as his interesting testimony about this mental process2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM165"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"chapter five166demonstrates. God accustomed me so that in each message, he writes,“He takes me from my self, despite the remaining of the [external]form, and then casts on me (yulqÊ ilayya) what He wishes by alluding(ish§ra) to a noble verse of the Qur\"an. Thereafter, He returns me tomy self and I meditate on the verse with delight and satisfaction untilHe inspires me (yulhimnÊ) to what He meant in the verse. I receivethe verse with neither letter nor voice nor direction.”22The concept of ilh§m, the inspiration that God bestows upon sufisaints in their understanding of the Qur\"anic verses, is complemen-ted in #Abd al-Q§dir’s thought by the concept of kashf, His revela-tion to the rightly guided of the object of their faith and the secretsof the commandments they perform. In this case too he emphasizesthat revelation does not add new truths, but rather deepens theexisting faith. The knowledge revealed to the saints also contains noprecepts or prohibitions beyond those handed down by the Prop-het, but only the inner secrets and essence of his teaching.23 Amongthose rightly guided believers, #Abd al-Q§dir observes three degrees,a typical sufi tripartition that we will meet in various forms. Thelowest comprises those who received rational guidance (al-dalÊl al-#aqlÊ wal-burh§n); above them stand those who were guided by theirfaith in the Prophet (taßdÊq al-rasål); and at the highest degree are thosewho attained guidance by revelation and vision (kashf wa-#iy§n). Thesedegrees are paralleled, according to #Abd al-Q§dir, by the three statesof certainty (yaqÊn) in the sufi path. Thus, #ilm al-yaqÊn requires proofand may be doubted, #ayn al-yaqÊn requires proof but cannot bedoubted, and Èaqq al-yaqÊn requires no proof at all. On the other hand,the three degrees of guidance are contrasted with three degrees ofstraying (·al§l), to which we will return later.24 Kashf is the attributeof the prophets, but it may be attained also by the most perfect saints,though by the latter its certainty may be doubted in those rare ca-ses when they have confounded the divine revelation with their ownhuman understanding and judgment.25The first “stop” of the Maw§qif elucidates not only the mysticalsystem of Ibn #ArabÊ, but also the structure of his teaching. On thebasis of his divine inspiration, #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ finds the foun-dations of all the sciences in the verse “You have had a good example22 Ibid., Mawqif 1, vol. 1, pp. 21-22.23 Ibid., Mawqif 222, vol. 1, pp. 436-437.24 Ibid., Mawqif 118, vol. 1, pp. 235-236.25 Ibid., Mawqif 327, vol. 3, p. 11.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM166"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience167in God’s messenger.”26 According to him, it is incumbent upon thenovice (murÊd), as well as upon the Gnostic (#§rif), to turn this verseinto his qibla (the direction to which one turns in prayer) in everyplace, time, and circumstance. Thus in line with the transcendentalinterpretation of the AkbarÊ teaching, #Abd al-Q§dir places MuÈam-mad at the center of his thought. The Prophet’s relationship withGod, on the one hand, and with humanity, on the other, determi-nes the division of the sciences into four types. The attitude of Godtoward the Prophet, which is expressed in oppositions such as suc-cess and failure or proximity and remoteness, constitutes the basisfor the theoretical science of theology. The attitude of the Prophettoward God, which is a realization of the state of servitude to Him(#ubådiyya) and maintenance of His rights of lordship (rubåbiyya), is thebasis for the practical religious sciences of Sufism and the Law. Theattitude of men toward the Prophet, which finds expression in suchoppositions as faith and denial or love and enmity, reflects the theo-retical worldly science of the Prophet’s merits and of the history ofhim and of the other prophets and saints. The attitude of the Prop-het toward men, which is nothing but love and good wishes, is themodel for the worldly practical sciences of morals and conduct (siy§sa)that secure the order (nií§m) and edifice (#im§ra) of the world. Thisdivision conveys the fundamental difference that #Abd al-Q§dir seesbetween the theoretical sciences, which are dialectical in their nature,and the practical sciences, whose instruction must be plain and un-equivocal.27At the center of Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching stands, as we saw, the con-troversial concept of waÈdat al-wujåd (the unity of being), which AÈmadSirhindÊ tried to supersede with his concept of waÈdat al-shuhåd (theunity of perception). #Abd al-Q§dir accepts SirhindÊ’s distinction,though by inverting the meaning of the two concepts. In his view,waÈdat al-shuhåd is the mystic state (È§l) of union (jam#), in which Godalone is perceived to the exclusion of His creatures. Those who enterthis state, #Abd al-Q§dir emphasizes, are outside themselves andshould not be denounced even when transgressing the precepts ofthe shari#a. WaÈdat al-wujåd, on the other hand, is the mystic station(maq§m) of separation (farq), in which the creatures are perceived assubsisting in God. In this station, the divine attributes and the rela-tive diversity are present, and it is again obligatory to fulfill the26 Qur\"an, al-AÈz§b (33), 21.27 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 1, vol. 1, pp. 23-25.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM167"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"chapter five168commandments and be concerned with worldly affairs (al-asb§b), asrequired by the shari#a.28 On the basis of this distinction, #Abd al-Q§dir again divides the believers into three degrees. For the com-mon people, God is internal and concealed (b§ãin kh§fin), while Hiscreatures are external and visible (í§hir b§din). Unable to perceiveGod, they grasp Him only by their intellects beyond the veil of at-tributes, which reflect the world of creation (al-khalq). To the peopleof waÈdat al-shuhåd, God reveals Himself in the name al-£§hir, so thatthey regard everything they perceive as Him (al-Èaqq). Against thesetwo groups, “the people of waÈdat al-wujåd perceive both God andcreation (al-Èaqq wal-khalq), the internal things in the external andthe external things in the internal, without concealing each other.”29For #Abd al-Q§dir, the inner knowledge of God (ma#rifa) thereforemeans to perceive the reality from a combination of these two per-spectives, the divine and the earthly.The principle of waÈdat al-wujåd gives rise in this way to a con-cept of mutual relationship between God and His creatures. Ibn#ArabÊ maintained that the possible entities, namely the creatures inpotential, and God in His degree of divinity (martabat al-ulåha), na-mely not as Himself but in His manifestation as Creator, are as ifmutually dependent (kal-muta·ayifÊn). Just as we need God to realize(wujåd) our prototypes (a#y§n th§bita) so He needs us to make mani-fest His manifestations (íuhår maí§hirihi).30 Nevertheless, for Ibn #ArabÊthis existential mutuality is entirely vested in God, the only One whoreally exists as the prefix “ka” indicates. #Abd al-Q§dir follows in hisfootsteps and, in the introduction to mawqif 248, which is essentiallya Neoplatonic essay treating the various degrees of reality, he defi-nes the world as the shadow of God, His external name, and Hisspecific manifestations, definitions and particularizations.31 In thesame vein, #Abd al-Q§dir explains the command “Be” in the senseof “Receive your specific character through my existence and ma-nifestation (wujådÊ wa-íuhårÊ) in you and thus be my manifestation(maíhar), not that you become existent (mawjåd).”32 From this it fol-lows that whatever is found on earth is in a state of non-existence.28 Ibid., Mawqif 192, vol. 1, p. 377.29 Ibid., Mawqif 250, vol. 2, pp. 200-201.30 Ibid., p. 198.

According to thisview, the sufi concept of fan§\" is the annihilation of the sense andpresumption of existence rather than of existence itself, which a priorihas no reality. For the Gnostics the world is a phantom (khay§l) thoughits interior is a truth or, in the opposite formulation, it is a truthperceived through imaginary forms.33 This is the real meaning of theunity of God.34Like Ibn #ArabÊ, however, #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ makes a dis-tinction between two degrees of non-existence, the one relative (fan§\"or thubåt) and the other absolute (#adam maÈ·). By maintaining thatthe entire world is imaginary, #Abd al-Q§dir clarifies, “the sufis donot mean that it does not exist at all, as the Sophists claim, or thatit exists only in the subjective imagination (khay§l muttaßil), as manywho were unfamiliar with the path of the people of God, such asIbn Khaldån, believed... The meaning of the people of God is thatin reality the world is different from what the common people per-ceive it to be, since its appearance is creation and its essence is God,or [as you may also] say, its appearance is God and its essence iscreature. The world is like the imagination that every intelligent beingfinds within himself.” Moreover, in the AkbarÊ system imaginationitself has existence as one mode of reality. “God’s spirit (al-#am§\"),which constitutes the substance of the world and the source of itstypes and particulars, is the objective imagination (khay§l munfaßil),absolute in itself (muãlaq) and realized (muÈaqqaq) in its capability tobe shaped in the forms of the creatures.35 These are revealed in theworld just as images are reflected in a mirror directed toward them.It is called imagination because whatever appears in it is differentfrom what it [really] is, and whatever is described as existent doesnot [exist], be it the world or God as manifested in a specific form.Regarding [God] as the combination of opposites (jam# al-·iddayn) isthe correct. One must say neither that the world is the essential truth(#ayn al-Èaqq) nor that it is untrue (ghayr al-Èaqq). All reality is true,yet within the truth (al-Èaqq) a part is depicted as created and anotheras God.” This is thus but another formulation of the principle of themutuality vested in God, since the relative non-existence of the world33 Ibid., Mawqif 46, vol. 1, pp. 86-88.34 Ibid., Mawqif 15, vol. 1, pp. 43-45.35 On the notion of al-#am§\" and the different types of the imagination see \\akÊm,Al-Mu#jam al-‘åfÊ, pp. 448-450, 820-826.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM169"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"chapter five170as creation is derived from the relative existence of God as a crea-tor, or in a reversed definition, the relative existence of the world isderived from the relative non-existence of God. Beyond that thereis the absolute existence of God within Himself, which cannot begrasped and against which stands the naught. Therefore, “in the truereality (al-wujåd al-ÈaqÊqÊ) there is nothing but His exalted essence,while all the world is in the imaginary reality (al-wujåd al-khay§lÊ).36The world was created in the “imaginary reality” “as if” by a mu-tual act between the creating God, the active principle, and thecreated potentialities, the passive principle. Ibn #ArabÊ expressed thisidea by distinguishing between two stages in the manifestation of Godin the world. The first stage is al-fay· al-aqdas (the most holy effu-sion), His revelation to Himself in the world of the unseen (#§lam al-ghayb) in the form of immutable essences yearning to be realized (al-a#y§n al-th§bita). The second is al-fay· al-muqaddas (the holy effusion),His revelation in the visible world (#§lam al-shah§da) through theseimmutable essences in the form of actual appearances (maí§hir). Theshape of each such actual appearance is determined by the capabi-lity (isti#d§d) of its immutable essence to reflect God.37 #Abd al-Q§diremphasizes in his writings the implications of this two-stage revela-tion for the phenomenon of the visible world, and particularly formankind. The God (al-Èaqq) that reveals Himself through the immu-table essences is unbounded, he explains, but the divine reality (al-wujåd al-Èaqq) “appears only in accordance with the pre-eternal ca-pability of each immutable essence... such as belief and heresy,obedience and rebelliousness, knowledge and ignorance, righteousnessand corruption, good and evil, and their like.”38 In this respect, theconcept of isti#d§d may be rendered as the predisposition of men inthe world of the unseen before their creation, or as their inclinationsin the visible world thereafter. These renderings reflect the two aspectswhich determine man’s peculiar existence.39 The most importantimplication of #Abd al-Q§dir’s description, however, is that from thehuman point of view it is not God as the Creator, in the second stageof His revelation, that determines a man’s character, but rather thecapability of his own immutable essence as a creature, as determi-36 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 248, vol. 2, pp. 73-75.37 Corbin, p. 195; Izutsu, pp. 43-44; \\akÊm, Al-Mu#jam al-‘åfÊ, pp. 888-890.38 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 23, vol. 1, pp. 58-60.

Byextension, this means that in its worldly aspect reality is not deter-mined by the Creator, but rather by the combined capabilities ofthe immutable essences of the pre-exiting creatures that emanatedfrom God Himself, namely by nature. #Abd al-Q§dir’s best formu-lation of this view occurs in his interpretation of the verse in whichMoses says to Pharaoh: “Our Lord is He who gave everything itscreation, then guided it.”40 He explains that in this verse “God an-nounced that he gave every thing in the created world, in its aspectof external existence, its quality (khalq), that is, its comprehensivepredisposition which is neither unknown nor created, and which isnothing but the thing itself in its aspect of non-existence.”41 Thepractical significance of this view for Islam in the age of Westernsupremacy will be discussed in the last section of this chapter.Another conclusion which arises from the principle of the mutualityvested in God is that human beings, and actually all creatures, arenecessarily impregnated with an instinctive knowledge (ma#rifa fiãriyya)of their Creator. Sufis in general regard this knowledge as the pri-mary object of creation, in accordance with the widely-circulatedhadith in which God is made to say: “I was a hidden and unknowntreasure. I longed to be known and therefore I created the creatu-res in the creation and made myself known to them. Through methey know me.” In this divine respect, no one is ignorant of Godand everyone worships Him alone. Nevertheless, in the worldlyaspect, the cognition of God differs from one man to another ac-cording to his intellect and perceptiveness, as determined by hispredisposition. #Abd al-Q§dir regards these differences as the causeof the diversity of religions and denominations in the world. Themanifestations of God are many, he states, and each person wors-hips a form—the sun, the stars, nature, or an imaginary creature—which he believes to be God (tashbÊh). For #Abd al-Q§dir, worshipingthese forms is indeed worship of God, though not of His internalessence (al-ÈaqÊqa), but rather of His reduced and limited manifesta-tions in them. Much sharper is his criticism of the theologians, whocircumscribe and limit God to fit their rational judgments and doc-trines. The intellect is only capable of abstraction (tanzÊh), he declares,and the theologians’ statements on the essence and attributes of God40 Qur\"an, •a Ha (20), 50.41 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 369, vol. 3, pp. 335-336.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM171"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"chapter five172only stem from the rational form they have of Him in their imagi-nation (ßåra #aqliyya khay§liyya).#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s criticism of the rationalist theologianswill be further discussed in the next section. Here it suffices to saythat he goes so far as to assert that were it not for the Lawgiver’spermission to imagine God while worshiping Him, he would haveargued that there is no difference between the anthropomorphistswho shape God with their hands and those who imagine Him byabstraction in their minds! God is present in everyone’s imagination,#Abd al-Q§dir writes, but is not restricted to any particular imagi-ner, imagined form or act of imagination. He is the restricted absolute(al-muãlaq al-muqayyad) since he is both absoluteness and restrictionin themselves, as indeed the essence of all opposites. In accordancewith his general tripartite division of the believers, #Abd al-Q§dirdepicts the faith of the Gnostics, who combine abstraction andanthropomorphism (tanzÊh wa-tashbÊh), as the genuine belief in theunity of God. These recognize God in this world in true absolute-ness (al-iãl§q al-ÈaqÊqÊ), going even beyond the notion of absoluteness,which in itself poses a restriction. They know that in every form, beit sensual, mental, spiritual, or imaginary, it is God who is beingrevealed. “He is the First and the Last, the Outward and the In-ward.”42 This recognition #Abd al-Q§dir expressed in an impressiveconversation he experienced with his Lord:God most exalted asked me: What are you? I said: I have two truthsfrom two aspects, from the aspect of You I am the pre-eternal, ne-cessarily existent and revealed... from the aspect of me I am the naughtthat did not breathe the smell of existence, the accident that is ab-sent in its occurrence. As long as I am present in You for You I exist,and as long as I am concealed in my self from You I am an absentpresent. Then He asked me: And who am I? I said: You are thenecessarily existent in Your self, unequaled in perfection of essenceand attributes, nay, You are far above (al-munazzah) the perfection ofattributes in Your perfection of self. You are the perfect in every sta-te, the elevated above whatever crosses the mind. He said: You donot know me.

Conceal Me from those who do not know Me, because divinity(rubåbiyya) has a secret the revelation of which will render rubåbiyyaineffective, and servitude (#ubådiyya) has a secret the revelation of whichwill render #ubådiyya ineffective.43Another important respect in which #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ divi-des the believers into three categories is their attitude toward theshari#a, thereby expressing his basic faithfulness to Muslim orthodoxy.The first category comprises those who interpret the Qur\"an literal-ly and are consequently led to anthropomorphism (tajsÊm wa-tashbÊh).In their case, #Abd al-Q§dir merely states that it is a blameworthyand invalid way. Next come those whose fulfillment of the preceptsof the shari#a is accompanied by an adequate understanding of itslanguage. This is for him the commendable middle way, which theAkbariyya follows. The last category consists of those who interpretthe Qur\"an allegorically and symbolically and espouse the abstrac-tion of God’s unity (tajrÊd al-tawÈÊd, as against the tanzÊh of the ratio-nalists). #Abd al-Q§dir’s criticism is principally directed toward thislast group, the views of which he regards as leading to the annul-ment of both religious commandments and current social conven-tions. He ascribes this attitude to the heretics, atheists, licentious, andpantheists, all of whom espouse in his view the pure unity of the stageof concentration (jam#) and reject the shari#a of the stage of separa-tion (farq). They pretend to attain to the degree of divinity andmaintain that, since their essence has become God and their visionis focused on Him alone, they are no more bound by the command-ments. This is not the path of the people of God, #Abd al-Q§dirstresses. When God bestows upon the latter the experience of unityHe protects them from transgressing the commandments, and whenHe returns them to their selves He shows them that the world existsonly in Him. Yet for his disciples, who were trained on the prin-ciple of waÈdat al-wujåd, #Abd al-Q§dir added that pure unity is thehuman inward state (b§ãin al-ins§n), even if in his external form (í§hirihi)man must distinguish between the Lord and the servant (al-rabb wal-#abd). The last statement is accompanied by a strict warning not to43 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 30, vol. 1, pp. 65-66.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM173"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"chapter five174disclose this secret to the common people, for whom it constitutes afearful temptation and error.44This danger leads #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ to stress the importanceof worship, however imperfect it may be. Thus, in his view the verses“Proclaim thy Lord’s praise and be of those that bow, and serve thyLord, until the Certain comes to thee,”45 are directed to the com-mon people (min war§\" al-Èij§b), enjoining them to praise God in theirway and to worship Him in accordance with the manner He wasrevealed to them. When such believers hear the sufis’ secrets, #Abdal-Q§dir warns, they may try to imitate their mystic states and talklike them about “the unity of being”. Yet, as they have not followedthe path, and thus lack an inner understanding of these states andsecrets, they are prone to neglect the shari#a and perish. For thisreason, #Abd al-Q§dir claims, God commanded His servants toadhere to the path they have. Furthermore, fulfilling the preceptsof the shari#a and persevering in supererogatory actions is the keyto understanding the divine secrets, or as #Abd al-Q§dir frames itthrough another popular sufi hadith, God loves those who obey Himand becomes their hearing, sight, tongue, and hand. This is for himthe meaning of the coming of certainty, alluded to at the end of theverse. By realizing that the purpose of the shari#a is to facilitate theremoval of the veil (raf# al-Èij§b) the believer’s appreciation, andadherence to, the shari#a should only increase. Thus, in full harmo-ny with orthodox Sufism, and with the Akbariyya as its most exal-ted manifestation, #Abd al-Q§dir could conclude that those claimingto have attained the sufi goal without increasing their praise of theshari#a are merely impostors.46On the other hand, the principle of mutuality vested in God entailsthat, in effect, men are necessarily predisposed not only towardknowing God, but also toward obedience to Him. In his interpreta-tion of the verse “We sent not ever any Messenger, but that he shouldbe obeyed, by the leave of God,”47 #Abd al-Q§dir maintains thateveryone to whom the messenger was sent obeyed him, whether ac-cepting his message or rejecting it. The obedient are divided intothe rightly guided (sing. muhtadÊ), who obey the external command-ments, and the erring (sing. ·§ll), who obey only the inner ones.

However, in reality every sabÊl is also a path to God,for there is nothing but His names. God can mislead whomever Hepleases in the capacity of His name al-mu·ill, just as He can guidewhomever He wishes to in the capacity of His name al-h§dÊ. Hence,those who are infidels and rebellious from the viewpoint of the shari#a,are obedient and followers of God’s path from the viewpoint of Hiswill.49 On the basis of this distinction #Abd al-Q§dir can conclude,in accordance with the immanent interpretation of the AkbarÊteaching, that, “we all obey God (Muslimån) and believe in him, andthere is no absolute denier of God in the world... all the infidelityin the world is but relative.”50The Criticism of Traditional Learning#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s criticism of the traditional learning of hisday derived from the unbridgeable contradiction between the openand ever-renewing interpretation of the scriptures, which he adop-ted from the AkbarÊ system, and the #ulama’s practice of restrictingtheir meanings by blind acceptance of what the ancient commenta-tors taught. The contrast that #Abd al-Q§dir saw between the con-servatives and the group of elect reformist men of religion that hesought to shape on the basis of Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching is presented inthe introduction he added to the Maw§qif. In his words, “I wrote thesedown for the sake of our brothers who believe in our signs.

Instead, he recommends fee-ling pity for them and justifying their behavior, since “we bring themthings that contradict what they have received from their previousmasters and what they have heard from their ancestors... Our pathof unity (ãarÊqat tawÈÊdin§)”, #Abd al-Q§dir concludes, “is the unitarypath of the revealed books and the sunna of the messengers, the paththat was followed by the interiors (baw§ãin) of the Rightly-GuidedCaliphs, the Companions, the following generations, and the sufis.”51Yet, #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ accepts the view, articulated alrea-dy by Ibn Khaldån, that the sufis and the #ulama share a commonorigin. He makes a distinction between, on the one hand, ahl al-Qur\"§n,the people of God who are close to Him and summon others to knowHim and tread the path toward Him, and on the other hand, ahl al-furq§n, the people of the Prophet who call upon others to fulfill theshari#a and follow his sunna. The difference between them lies inthe experience of the divine presence, #Abd al-Q§dir clarifies, im-mediately adding that this does not mean that they are distinct groups,since both the Qur\"an and the furq§n were revealed by God. There-fore, the bearer of the Qur\"an who lacks the furq§n is a deviatingheretic, while the bearer of the furq§n without the Qur\"an is a rebel-lious sinner. Initially these two were fused, but the passage of timeand the spread of vanity had produced two groups (Èizbayn) anderected walls between them. In consequence, ahl al-Qur\"§n becameknown as ahl al-ÈaqÊqa, ßåfiyya and fuqar§\", and ahl al-furq§n as ahl al-sharÊ#a, #ulam§\" and fuqah§\".52 In his fundamentally orthodox viewpoint,#Abd al-Q§dir acknowledges the right of those who faithfully followthe shari#a to denounce the sufis’ actions that seem to contradict itsliteral meaning. He reserves this right, however, to those cases inwhich there is a general consensus and requires that such criticismwill be accompanied by a belief in the sufis’ inner perfection.53#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ is more demanding in regard to the le-51 Ibid., vol. 1, pp. 3-4.52 Ibid., Mawqif 159, vol. 1, pp. 321-323.53 Ibid., Mawqif 195, vol. 1, pp. 383-384.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM176"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience177gal scholars of his day, though he refers to them only occasionally.Thus, for example, while discussing the permission to add a prostra-tion after the prayer, which Ibn #ArabÊ allowed and some juristsforbade, #Abd al-Q§dir writes that the view of the fuqah§\" was adop-ted owing to the belief that they know the shari#a better than thesufis and that their judgments are based upon evidence. Yet, in hisopinion this argument is unfounded since nine-tenths of the jurists’judgments rely on discretion (istiÈs§n), only the remaining one-tenthhaving grounds in the four “roots” of Islamic jurisprudence.54 Evenmore serious in #Abd al-Q§dir’s eyes is the use by the fuqah§\" of legalstratagems (sing. ÈÊla) to circumvent the precepts of the shari#a. In asufi vein, he emphasizes that God accepts no word or deed unlessthey are accompanied by good intention (niyya). He expresses bewil-derment at those legal experts who can rule that a man who trans-fers his money to his wife shortly before the fixed time for payingalms in order to evade it is indeed exempted, and believe their ru-ling will benefit them on the Day of Judgment. Such stratagems maydeceive the sultan who sees only the externals, Abd al-Q§dir decla-res, but not the Greatest Sultan who also observes the internals. Itwould be better for such a jurist if he were conscious of his disobe-dience, because then it could be hoped that he might repent.55#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s main criticism in the Maw§qif, however,is directed at the rationalist theologians (mutakallimån). His attitudetoward them is most clearly formulated in his interpretation of thelast two verses of the al-F§tiÈa, the text of the Muslim prayer. Al-ßir§ã al-mustaqÊm (the straight path), which the believer is comman-ded to seek in each section (rak#a) of the prayer, is explained by #Abdal-Q§dir as the infinite path of God’s gnosis. Al-mun#am #alayihim (theblessed) are the messengers of God and their heirs, the sufis, to whomGod has revealed the reality of things and given certain knowledgeof Him and His creatures. Al-magh·åb #alayhim (those who are objectsof wrath) are the heathens, who imagine God in concrete forms. Al-·§llÊn (the straying) are the philosophers and the rationalist theolo-gians, those perplexed who seek to understand God’s essence withtheir intellects. Their logic leads them only to doubt and fruitlesseffort, #Abd al-Q§dir asserts, as was admitted by their own leaders,54 Ibid., Mawqif 281, vol. 2, p. 288.55 Ibid., Mawqif 125, vol. 1, pp. 251-252.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM177"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"chapter five178JuwaynÊ and R§zÊ.56 This interpretation is further elaborated by clas-sifying those straying into three degrees, as against the three degreesof the rightly guided mentioned above. The rationalist theologian,who espouses absolute anthropomorphism or the abstraction of God,is at the lowest degree of straying. Above him stands the idolater,who represents God with a perceptible form. The third, and mostdangerous, degree is reserved for the atheist, who completely aban-dons his God. To the latter degree belong the sects of the Dahriyyaand the •ib§#iyya, the materialists and the naturalists, which in #Abdal-Q§dir’s time came to denote the Westerners and their Muslimimitators.57These degrees of guidance and straying, however, are relativenotions. Thus, the straying of the theologians is, according to #Abdal-Q§dir, nothing but their tendency to seek guidance from theirintellects rather than from God. Congruent with the views he ad-vanced in his rationalist writings, he repeatedly reiterates in theMaw§qif that reason can lead only to the point of acknowledgingGod’s existence and unity, beyond which divine guidance, as han-ded down by the prophets, becomes necessary. In this respect, #Abdal-Q§dir distinguishes between two types of guidance, the one divi-ne and the other human. The divine guidance (hid§yat al-Èaqq) is theprofession of unity and the commandments delivered by the prop-hets. It must be accepted whether the intellect approves it or not. Ifthe believer follows them, God will teach him His sciences and lethim understand what at first he accepted by imitation. Furthermore,through experiential revelation and divine emanation the believerwill also comprehend the truths delivered by the prophets which theintellect rejects. Human guidance (hid§yat al-khalq), by contrast, theguidance of the intellect, is either partial or complete straying. Thehighest rational knowledge, #Abd al-Q§dir asserts, is abstraction fromthe attributes of the creatures, the claim that God is not this or that.This is not the knowledge we are seeking, he clarifies, and it isimperative to abstract God from the knowledge of the intellect. Thus,what the intellect believes to be the abstraction of God is reallyanthropomorphism, while the real God, as revealed to the sufis, isHe who combines abstraction and anthropomorphism.58 From a56 Ibid., Mawqif 14, vol. 1, pp. 41-43.57 Ibid., Mawqif 118, vol. 1, p. 236.58 Ibid., Mawqif 96, vol. 1, pp. 186-188.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM178"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience179different angle, #Abd al-Q§dir argues that what the rationalists re-gard as their God is something bounded and limited by their ownlogical principles. The God of the prophets and their followers, bycontrast, is unbounded, unlimited, and capable of doing whateverHe wishes, even that which the rationalists claim to be impossible.To know the God of the prophets and their heirs it is necessary toadhere to His sunna and adopt the measures proposed by the greatsufi masters.59The best testimony for the straying of the theologians is the divi-siveness pervading their ranks. Grouping them together with thephilosophers, the Mu#tazila, and the Ash#arÊs, #Abd al-Q§dir claimsthat the doctrines of all these rationalist schools are more erroneousthan correct. He attributes their divisiveness, as described above, tothe tendency of each school to limit God according to its ownteachings and to reject the possibility that He fits other doctrines aswell. Their adherents cling obstinately to their own views, more sothan any other group of believers, often cursing and charging oneanother with unbelief (takfÊr). Furthermore, disagreements are pre-valent not only between the rationalist schools, but also within eachparticular school. Among the sufis there are no such controversies,since they realize that God is compatible with all the beliefs. Never-theless, #Abd al-Q§dir emphasizes that the sufis do not reproach thethinkers (ahl al-naíar wal-fikr) for contemplating God, since they knowthat this is their natural disposition. Their only objection is to deedsderiving from the deception (talbÊs) which is caused by their thoughts.There is no theoretical science, he claims, that cannot be attainedwith certainty by way of revelation. Plato himself received the truthin this way, and the sufis accordingly regard him as possessing divi-ne knowledge. This stress on the difference between the two typesof sciences leads #Abd al-Q§dir to make a parallel distinction bet-ween two types of taqlÊd. The elect, the genuine believers, imitate theProphet and the sufi saints, while the common believers imitate therationalists and are led by them into confusion.60An even graver consequence of applying the rationalist approachto the Divine is the tendency to turn reason into the criterion forthe accuracy of the scriptures. “Those who rely on their intellect”,#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ asserts, “do not accept what the prophets59 Ibid., Mawqif 173, vol. 1, p. 345.60 Ibid., Mawqif 358, vol. 3, pp. 193-201.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM179"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"chapter five180have handed down unless it is congruent with their logic. Otherwisethey interpret it allegorically (ta\"wÊl) or, failing to find an allegoricalexplanation, reject it altogether.”61 This approach pervaded all thereligious sciences. With respect to the Qur\"an, #Abd al-Q§dir warnsagainst it in his interpretation of the verse “And We sent down, ofthe Koran, that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers.”62According to him, this verse points to the healing of the heart’sdiseases, namely vain beliefs and shaky faith. Those who seek theirLord with their intellect will not be cured, however, for when theyhear a verse whose literal meaning appears to be anthropomorphicthey doubt it. Thus the Qur\"an actually aggravates their disease.63Turning to the science of hadith, #Abd al-Q§dir exclaims, “How manyPropehtic traditions the formal #ulama rejected merely because theywere unable to interpret them allegorically. For them, the sign offabrication of a hadith is its being contrary to reason and defiesallegorical interpretation... These turned their intellects into a sourceof the Qur\"an and the sunna.” He traces the origins of this approachto the rationalist theologians’ treatment of the obscure verses of theQur\"an (the mutash§bih§t) and prophetic reports about God’s attri-butes (aÈ§dÊth al-ßif§t).64 Concerning the legal sciences, #Abd al-Q§dirremarks in the same vein that “this affliction has become universal,so that today you cannot find a jurist who does not follow thismethod”!65#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s severe criticism of the rationalist ap-proach reflected his perception of the danger it posed for the reli-gious belief, which he developed as a result of his encounter withthe West. During his forced stay in France, #Abd al-Q§dir couldwitness the spread of skepticism and atheism that the unrestrictedapplication of reason, important as it was for the practical sciences,was prone to generate. In these circumstances, the lesser straying ofthe rationalist theologians seemed to him as the doorway to thegreater one, that of the materialists and the naturalists. Once in theOttoman Empire, #Abd al-Q§dir could not fail to observe the be-ginnings of the application of this rationalist approach by the Wes-ternizing reformers of the late Tanzimat period. The first part of the61 Ibid., p. 207.62 Qur\"an, al-Isr§\" (17), 82.63 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 106, vol. 1, pp. 209-211.64 Ibid., Mawqif 22, vol. 1, pp. 57-58.65 Ibid., Mawqif 106, vol. 1, pp. 211-212.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM180"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience181task he assigned to himself, and to the religious elite he sought toshape, was thus to reassert against these reformers the supremacyof faith over reason, and of the divine over worldly concerns.A Bridge to the Modern World#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s call to apply the rationalist approach toworldly affairs is anchored in the AkbarÊ solution to two centraldilemmas debated in Islam almost from its inception. The first is thedilemma of the divine decree as against human free will, a questionthat preoccupied the theologians and which, as will be remembe-red, also held an important place in the teaching of Shaykh Kh§lid.The other is the dilemma of striving in this world (al-akhdh bil-asb§b)as against complete trust in God (tawakkul), which engaged mainlythe sufis. The two dilemmas are naturally interconnected. In #Abdal-Q§dir’s teaching, moreover, both are approached through theconcept of isti#d§d, which served him as the key to the integration ofthe Muslim peoples in the modern world.From Ibn #ArabÊ’s assertion that the forms of the actual manifes-tations in the visible world are determined by the capability of theirimmutable essences (isti#d§d al-a#y§n al-th§bita) in the world of theunseen, it could be concluded that he accepted the doctrine of pre-destination (al-qadar). Yet, in contrast to the theologians’ notions, fromthe AkbarÊ teaching of the two-stage manifestation of God it followsthat the pre-eternal decree is not given by God in his capacity asCreator, but rather by the immutable essences which emanate fromHim in Himself. For #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, who stressed thisprinciple by maintaining that the Creator is revealed in the immu-table essences according to their predisposition, it meant that Godconducts the visible world through the laws of nature. From this #Abdal-Q§dir proceeds to the even more far-reaching conclusion that Godis prevented from changing the predestined inclination of His crea-tures. “The natural inclination”, he writes, “is the necessarily ans-wered seeker (al-ã§lib al-muj§b), the caller whose call cannot be re-fused.” #Abd al-Q§dir emphasizes that this call emanates from a man’sinner nature rather than from his conscious will. The natural incli-nation will be complied with, he contends, whether the tongue agreesor not. The full practical significance of this view is revealed in thecomplementary argument that man must not seek from God that2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM181"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"chapter five182which contradicts his nature, since He is prevented from respondingto such a request. A mere utterance by the tongue that does notcorrespond to the nature of the requestor is in vain, #Abd al-Q§dirclaims, since a subsequent request cannot be the cause of a previousdecree. The object of the plea to God (du#§\"), as ordained by Himand institutionalized by the shari#a, is according to this reasoning onlyto remind believers of their need of their Lord implanted in theirnature.66Hence, in #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s view, the meaning of theworldly aspect of God’s revelation in accordance with the capacityof the immutable essences is the inverse vested in Him of its meaningin its divine aspect. His conclusion is thus that free will is inherentin the pre-eternal decree of nature. This is valid of course only inthe case of man, whose peculiar potential disposition, or natural ca-pability, it is to acquire the worldly sciences by his intellect. Fromthe human aspect this is a dynamic divine decree of free will. The-refore, in the “imaginary reality” in which man lives, he must ac-quiesce to his nature which demands him to rely on himself, ratherthan ask God for what does not suit him. By extension, this prin-ciple may be formulated thus that, since man must accept reality asit is, it is incumbent upon him to work within it rather than ask refugefrom it in God. #Abd al-Q§dir’s behavior was largely determined bythis principle. “This visioner”, he writes of himself, “when a sayingor a deed grieves him in the external world, he does not say “this isthe truth and I deserve it”, but rather returns to his soul and exa-mines it, since man is responsible for himself. The actor or the speak-er, though in fact it is God from behind the veil of the forms, doesnot do or say anything but what the immutable essence, which thisform reflects, requires.”67In his discussion of suffering from the divine angle, #Abd al-Q§diral-Jaz§\"irÊ shifts the stress between the apparently contradictory beliefsof acquiescing to reality while acting to amend it to the first. Thosewhom God afflicts and tries, he writes, must understand that theirown natural disposition requires it and avoid complaining to Him.If God were to compel them to something else, they would havedeclined since they lack the potential capability of accepting it,whether it fits them outwardly, namely is considered by them to be66 Ibid., Mawqif 94, vol. 1, pp. 180-182.67 Ibid., Mawqif 23, vol. 1, pp. 58-59.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM182"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience183good, or not.68 This assertion is indeed revealing of the psychologi-cal mechanism which led #Abd al-Q§dir to adopt the theosophy ofIbn #ArabÊ. In al-Shaykh al-Akbar’s double-aspect doctrine of waÈ-dat al-wujåd he could find consolation for the crisis he underwentduring his captivity. People cannot remove the natural psychic pain,#Abd al-Q§dir says, but they are capable of removing the spiritualpain. Thus, the sufis are happy and satisfied in their interiors, con-fident that whatever God chooses for them is good, and they remaincalm even when afflicted by calamities and anguish. Nothing is in-appropriate or bad in itself, it is so only in relation to physical ap-titudes and dispositions. As for the hidden inner truths, whateverhappens to them is appropriate since it necessarily corresponds towhat they require.69The same stress on the necessity of acquiescing to reality helps #Abdal-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ to justify the growing European supremacy overthe Muslim peoples. This is discernible in his reply to the questionof why Muslims praise whatever comes from the Christians andimitate them in all their manners and habits. #Abd al-Q§dir first givesthe traditional answer that since the Muslims had neglected the shari#aGod abandoned them, and that the Muslim rulers—kings, ministers,and amirs—who came to believe that the defeats of their armiesstemmed from the customs and conduct of the unbelievers, procee-ded to imitate them. Because the questioner was not convinced bythis external explanation, #Abd al-Q§dir adds an inner one: Thereason for the changes in the situation of the world is the changesin the manifestations of the divine names. Divinity in Itself needsthese changes, be they for the good or for the bad. The divine na-mes act upon and influence the creatures, each one of them in itsown way. All the affairs of the creatures depend upon the laws ofthe divine names, symbolize them, and constitute their consequen-ces. Beyond that nothing can be said or asked. It is impossible toexplain the actions of God in His creatures, and all that can be saidis that generally every thing receives its share.70The more dynamic quality of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s notionof isti#d§d can be detected in his treatment of another traditional Mus-68 Ibid., Mawqif 369, vol. 3, pp. 335-336.69 Ibid., Mawqif 220, vol. 1, pp. 434-435.70 Ibid., Mawqif 364, vol. 3, pp. 255-257.

Here again, #Abd al-Q§dirseems to adopt predestination when he warns against misunderstan-ding the phrase “thee alone we pray for succor” in the text of theprayer.71 The external aspect of this phrase appears to imply, he ad-mits, that man is capable of performing part of the action and, the-refore, that each one of the two partners, God and man, has a sha-re in it. Yet, this interpretation fails to take into consideration thecircumstances in which it was given. God’s word was delivered inthe scriptures and through his messengers, #Abd al-Q§dir asserts, inaccordance with the degree of understanding of the common belie-vers. These imagine that their existence is independent and distinctfrom the existence of God, and since they are unable to conceive ofmore than that, He spoke to them as if it were true, ascribing ac-tions, abilities, and will, to men and giving them the impression thatHe only succors them. For the same reason the Qur\"an is repletewith commandments and prohibitions which the believers seem tobe free to obey or not, and with beliefs which they seem to be allo-wed to accept or reject. From the divine point of view, however, itis utterly impossible that such choices should be attributed to men,who as accidents with no independent existence cannot be acting,choosing, and willing.72But, from the worldly aspect of the shari#a the situation is diffe-rent. In this respect, #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ follows the accepteddefinition of man’s actions as either obedience or rebelliousness, forwhich he is rewarded or punished.73 To explain their possibility forthose who have no existence but in God, #Abd al-Q§dir makes a dis-tinction between two types of divine will (ir§da), parallel to the dis-tinction Shaykh Kh§lid made concerning the divine decree (qa·§\").74One is the absolute will (ir§da muãlaqa), in which His command iscarried out inevitably and without intermediary, the other is thebounded will (ir§da muqayyada), in which God is “as if” willing theintermediary to carry out His command. The latter type is, of cour-se, unique to men. This division of God’s will is justified logicallyon the ground that part of humanity does not believe and obey Him,though He certainly wish all His servants to do so. In this case #Abd71 Qur\"an, al-F§tiÈa (1), 5.72 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 2, vol. 1, pp. 24-25.73 Ibid., Mawqif 4, vol. 1, p. 30.74 See p. 44.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM184"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience185al-Q§dir refrains from adding an explanation of the sense of “as if”,which as in Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching, implies that in reality the crea-ture’s will itself also derives from God. Instead, he prefers to empha-size that man obeys or rebels in accordance with what his intellectand will require, and that he is therefore responsible for his deeds.75The full significance of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s stand in thisquestion is revealed during his debate with the different Muslim theo-logical schools. Reviewing their various solutions to the problem, eachone of them constituting according to him a part of the truth, #Abdal-Q§dir refutes them by using their own rational methods. TheJabriyya believe that the action is carried out by God alone. Thisview is ruinous, he asserts, since it leads one to abandon the com-mandments and prohibitions of the shari#a. The Mu#tazila claim thatthe action is performed by man alone. By this they completely se-parate God and man, in his opinion, regarding the first as an enti-rely abstract entity and the second as possessing an entirely free will.The rationalist theologians, both the Ash#arÊs with their concept ofkasb (acquisition) and the M§turÊdÊs with their concept of jaz§\" ikhtiy§rÊ(voluntary reward), the opinion that Kh§lid adopted, believe that theaction belongs to God while man has a share in it. In #Abd al-Q§dir’sview, these are closer to the truth, though they are still limited bythe use of a pure rationalist approach which prevents them fromcomprehending the divine disclosures in their manifestations as crea-tures. Consequently, they too lead to the abstraction (tanzÊh) of Godto the exclusion of His personification (tashbÊh). For the sufis, on theother hand, the action is suspended between God and man, atta-ched neither to God alone, as the reality in itself (al-wujåd al-dh§t),nor to man alone, as the form (ßåra) thereof. In a practical sense,this AkbarÊ view attaches the action to man when it is externallyreproachable according to the shari#a or custom, and to God whenit is praiseworthy. Nevertheless, in their root both kinds of actionare related to God, since nothing really exists or acts but Him.76#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s view on the question of the source ofman’s action is thus rooted in the principle that underlies his entirethought, the mutuality vested in God. Every action may be attribu-ted to four factors or aspects: to God in His capacity as the reali-ty—truth and the real actor; to the creature in his capacity as the75 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 5, vol. 1, pp. 30-31.76 Ibid., Mawqif 266, vol. 2, pp. 238-242.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM185"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"chapter five186action’s source in the perceptible world; to God in the creature inHis capacity as the instrument of action; and to the creature in Godin his capacity as His manifestation and particularization. Therefore,“the action is from God most exalted in the sense of being the ac-tion of the creature, and the action of the creature by force of beingthe action of God. In effect, there is nothing but the reality—Godwho manifests Himself according to the requirements of the immu-table essences.”77 From the human point of view, #Abd al-Q§dir cla-rifies, men possess the potential disposition to ask God that they beobedient or rebellious, and He responds accordingly. The deedbelongs essentially to God, but in its manifestation it becomes thedeed of the legally capable believer.78 Thus, every human action hasthree aspects: in his own perception man acquires it through hispower of will and choice; internally there is no acquisition and nochoice; and with regard to his immutable essence he is neither com-pelled nor choosing since what comes from him is merely his pre-disposition, which is his nature.79The major conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is that in theexternal perceptible world man is the actor. This world is, for #Abdal-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, that aspect of reality which is governed by theprinciple of causality. As will be remembered, #Abd al-Q§dir hadalready claimed in his rationalist writings that Islam, rather thanrejecting causality in itself, accepts it in a manner compatible withGod’s unity. In his mystical writings, he further elucidates throughit the implications of the concept of isti#d§d for worldly affairs. Theprophets and their heirs enjoined to reject the self-power of causes,#Abd al-Q§dir asserts, but not to deny their existence, since it is GodHimself who established them. Those who reject the occurring be-nefits and ordinary causes are, therefore, ignorant and rebellious. Thesufis, by contrast, see God in the causes, knowing that every exis-tent thing is His manifestation. The internal truth, #Abd al-Q§dircontinues, is that causes have no effect, and that it is God who actsin the specific form in which He reveals Himself in every creatureaccording to its predisposition. Thus, it is obligatory to view God asacting through the causes, and to rely on Him rather than on them.Yet concomitantly, #Abd al-Q§dir emphasizes that the causes shouldnot be abandoned altogether. God conceals His actions in the forms77 Ibid., Mawqif 50, vol. 1, p. 92.78 Ibid., Mawqif 362, vol. 3, pp. 250-251.79 Ibid., Mawqif 366, vol. 3, pp. 293-294.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM186"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience187of His creatures, he maintains, both out of mercy for them, so thatthey would not feel compelled, and to protect His sanctity, when theirdeeds are externally incompatible with His command. In the Ak-barÊ system, this concealment implies that the causes are necessaryfor the existence (wujådan), though they must be withdrawn in God’svision (shuhådan).80 #Abd al-Q§dir completes this discussion with aclarification of the relationship between causality and God in Hiscapacity as Creator. “God produces the effects from their causesthrough wisdom and free will, rather than through inability andcompulsion, except when the cause is considered from the standpoint of theDivine face and Lordly secret, according to which the form of this causewas shaped. Then, the effect is produced by and through the cause... in thesense that it is as a tool in the hands of a carpenter, for example,and the actor is the artisan, not the tool.” [my emphasis]81Moreover, in #Abd al-Q§dir’s eyes, causality stands at the root ofthe existence of all religions. Were God not concerned with main-taining the wisdom of the causes, he writes, He would have sent nomessenger, no shari#a would have been handed down, and therewould be no commandments and prohibitions. Referring to the sufidistinction between the world of divine command (#§lam al-amr) andthe world of creation (#§lam al-khalq), #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ explainsthat the latter, “God does not bring into existence except by a cause;the practice and wisdom of God necessitate it. Therefore, each atomof the created world has two aspects, one faces God the most exal-ted, its Creator, and the other faces its cause. The world of divinecommand has only one aspect.” From this #Abd al-Q§dir deducesthe nature of the assignment given to prophets. In accordance withthe traditional Muslim view, he emphasizes that they were sent tohelp men both in this world and in the hereafter, and that for thatpurpose they were endowed with the most perfect knowledge of theirmaterial and spiritual needs. Yet, for #Abd al-Q§dir this implies thatthe prophets were familiar with all the worldly sciences, includingthose which they had no opportunity to practice. He is willing toexclude only those sciences which, from the shari#a point of view,bring no benefit, such as the details of astronomy and mathematicsand most philosophical sciences which do not involve educating andrefining the soul. This interest in the sciences was one point in which80 Ibid., Mawqif 44, vol. 1, pp. 84-85.81 Ibid., Mawqif 45, vol. 1, p. 86.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM187"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"chapter five188#Abd al-Q§dir acknowledged that his opinion differed from that ofIbn #ArabÊ.82Accepting causality as God’s action or manifestation in the crea-ted world informed #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s view of the comple-mentary concept of complete trust in God, tawakkul. He defines itas the confidence of the heart and the peace of the mind which comefrom knowing that the pre-ordained fate of man will come about,be it good or bad, beneficial or harmful. This trust emanates, then,from the belief that God will not break His promise, rather than froma rejection of causality. The trust in God that the sufi masters in-struct their disciples to adopt, including the rejection of causes, #Abdal-Q§dir explains, is merely a temporal means to achieve certaintyand calmness. Subsequently they will return to their reliance on or-dinary causes to attain their needs. Only sufis in a state of rapture,or those ignorant of the mystic path and the Prophet’s sunna, mayreject causality, according to him, since it is tantamount to defyingthe wisdom of God and negating one of His attributes. The sufis whohave reached perfection, on the other hand, experience a completeintegration of the opposites of tawakkul and al-akhdh bil-asb§b as anotheraspect of their internality and externality. Thus, “those who obser-ve the interior of the sufi find that he is an unmoving mountain, firmand indestructible. He is not distracted by the causes and pays noattention to them. Those who observe his exterior see him as flit-ting from branch to branch and from tree to tree.”83 #Abd al-Q§diralso alludes to this station in his interpretation of the verse whichwas the foundation of the activist attitude of the Naqshbandiyya:“men whom neither commerce nor trafficking diverts from the re-membrance of God.” In all his actions man should be for God, inGod, and through God, always in a state of presence, awareness, andgood intention.84This state is again best illustrated in the tripartite distinction amongthe believers. In this case, #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ distinguishesbetween the two extremes of the pure mutasabbib, whose view is li-mited to the causes and blinded to God, and the pure mutawakkil,whose view is diverted from the causes and immersed in the vision82 Ibid., Mawqif 279, vol. 2, pp. 280-282; Mawqif 286, vol. 2, pp. 310-311; Mawqif44, vol. 1, pp. 84-85.83 Ibid., Mawqif 165, vol. 1, pp. 331-332; see also Mawqif 282, vol. 2, pp. 292-294.84 Ibid., Mawqif 12, vol. 1, pp. 38-39.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM188"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"the theosophical experience189of God. Between them stands the perfect believer, the outwardmutasabbib and inward mutawakkil, “whose hand is in the cause whilehis heart is joined to its Creator.” In defining the causes, however,#Abd al-Q§dir makes additional significant distinction between theirthree types, the ordinary, the rational, and the shar#Ê. His main con-cern is in the latter type, implying that the shari#a contains itself arational dimension. The commandments and prohibitions, #Abd al-Q§dir contends, are themselves causes, as the meaning of a com-mandment is that if you fulfill it you will reach paradise, while themeaning of a prohibition is that if you transgress it you will end upin hell. All religious dispensations, from Adam to MuÈammad, weregiven in consideration of both ordinary and shar#Ê causes. The sufiscomply with all of them, so that outwardly there is no differencebetween them and other believers, though internally the differencebetween them is as “between the heaven and the earth, the east andthe west.” Those to whom the real Actor was revealed, #Abd al-Q§dirsays, realize the essence of the commanded, the commander, andthe commandment. Their exteriors comply with the commandmentsand prohibitions, while in their interiors they know that they aremerely receptacles of their existence rather than their performers.They expect no reward or punishment and their hearts are calm.85It was that combination of striving in this world and complete trustin God that determined the economic pursuits of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ in the last part of his life in Damascus. #Abd al-Q§dir’s at-titude toward wealth is primarily articulated through another cen-tral station in the sufi path, asceticism (zuhd). Most sufis wronglyregard it as avoiding the bounty of this world, he claims, while itreally means the removal from the heart of aspirations for what isother than God, or for what does not bring one closer to Him.86 LikeShaykh Kh§lid before him, #Abd al-Q§dir testifies that he abstainsfrom nothing, since he sees God in everything. Purity of the heartis to be found rather in awareness of Him, and in this state worldlydelights and joys can do no harm. Moreover, when the heart ispresent in God, it does not notice the passions at all.87 Regardingthe apparent contradiction between his own wealth and success andwhat is expected from a sufi, #Abd al-Q§dir writes, alluding to theanimosity toward him in Damascus, that after beseeching God for85 Ibid., Mawqif 77, vol. 1, pp. 135-137.86 Ibid., Mawqif 165, vol. 1, pp. 332-333.87 Ibid., Mawqif 138, vol. 1, p. 282.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM189"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"chapter five190a sign of his happiness, he received this answer:You are happy in this world and in the next.

It seems to them unreasonable thatyou should gain happiness in both worlds and, moreover, that youbelong to the exalted community and the saved [the sufis]... This isbut divine providence and a sign of favor from God, who singles outfor His mercy whomever He wishes.88To the poor, #Abd al-Q§dir recommends not to humiliate themsel-ves before the rich by begging from them, lest they lose not only theirdignity in this world but also most of their reward in the next.89The same practical considerations governed #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s political attitudes. As in his rationalist writings, #Abd al-Q§dirdoes not deny the duty of jihad against the opponents of Islam, untilthey pay the poll tax and are humiliated, although he describes it asthe most difficult commandment for the sufis to endure.90 Againstit, #Abd al-Q§dir stresses the duty to have special compassion for “thepeople of the book”. Moreover, he describes a dream in which Ibn#ArabÊ himself reprimanded him for greeting some Christians in aMuslim manner, thus indicating to the second point in which hediffered from the opinions of his great master.91 #Abd al-Q§dir alsoreiterates his praise of the Arabs, and goes even further to justify theirliving in a state of ignorance in the time of the J§hiliyya. There werecertainly polytheists (mushrikån) among them, he writes, but Godignored that and pardoned their ignorance because he had sent themno messenger since the days of Abraham and Ishmael. They wereactually convinced that their fathers’ idolatry was the religion ofAll§h.92Yet, the most important aspect of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s po-litical teaching during his exile in Damascus, and the third point onwhich he differed from the teaching of Ibn #ArabÊ, was his attitude88 Ibid., Mawqif 265, vol. 2, p. 237.89 Ibid., Mawqif 318, vol. 2, pp. 458-459.90 Ibid., Mawqif 80, vol. 1, pp. 139-140.91 Ibid., Mawqif 250, vol. 2, pp. 191-192; Mawqif 372, vol. 3, p. 365.

This #Abd al-Q§dir expressed through hisinterpretation of the famous Prophetic saying: “He among you whoobserves an evil shall remove it by his hand; if this is beyond hispower, [he shall remove it] by his tongue; if this is beyond his po-wer, [he shall remove it] by his heart; and this is the minimum offaith.” The removal by hand, #Abd al-Q§dir asserts, is incumbentupon the ruler and his governors; by tongue, upon the #ulama whoprofess to be knowledgeable; and by heart, upon common believerswho recognize the evil. Action by the first two is beneficial for thecommunity, and action by the last is beneficial for him. The Sufis,however, do not belong in #Abd al-Q§dir’s eyes to any of these threecategories and, therefore, are not obliged to remove evil at all! Theybehold of the Real Actor and realize that creatures are mere acci-dents into which He supplants actions, things, and intentions, wit-hout their participation.93 This was clearly a call to completely shunpolitics, which reflected #Abd al-Q§dir’s readiness to overlook theWesternizing thrust of the late Tanzimat statesmen for the sake ofmodernization.The movement of religious reform inaugurated by #Abd al-Q§diral-Jaz§\"irÊ in Damascus in the third quarter of the nineteenth cen-tury was deeply imbued with the theosophy of MuÈyÊ al-DÊn ibn#ArabÊ. Possessed, like his spiritual master, of a profound sense ofmission, #Abd al-Q§dir took it upon himself to redefine the relations-hip between mysticism and rationalism in Islam on the basis of thetwo-pronged AkbarÊ doctrine of waÈdat al-wujåd. In the reality of Eu-ropean supremacy, this redefinition amounted to a call to adopt theWestern rationalist approach to worldly affairs while, at the sametime, barring it from the religious sciences, particularly theology.Within the Muslim community it also meant a break with the tra-ditional men of religion, who by adhering to the practice of taqlÊdhad failed to protect the fundamental truths of the Muslim faithagainst the dangers inherent in rationalism. The three points on which#Abd al-Q§dir departed from the teaching of al-Shaykh al-Akbar—the interest in worldly sciences, the tolerant attitude toward Chris-tians, and the complete shunning of political affairs—reveal thatpractically within the AkbarÊ tradition #Abd al-Q§dir’s thought tip-ped toward the inclusive immanent interpretation of Ibn #ArabÊ’s93 Ibid., Mawqif 133, vol. 1, pp. 270-271; Mawqif 362, vol. 3, p. 254.2-5.p659/19/00, 12:52 PM191"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"chapter five192teaching at the expense of the exclusive transcendental one.

Unlike Shaykh Kh§lid’s movement of renewal in theprevious generation, however, which had sought to include all of the#ulama, and through them the entire population, of a city sufferingfrom the weakness of the Ottoman government, #Abd al-Q§dir’sAkbarÊ teaching was designed for an elect group of conscientious menof religion who shared his belief that the conduct of the traditional#ulama had become the primary impediment to the regeneration ofIslam. These men also proved more ready to accept #Abd al-Q§dir’sview that the key to the preservation of their religion lay in its in-tegration into the modern world.The elect circle that #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ gathered around himin Damascus consisted mostly of the sons of #ulama belonging to thechief reformist sufi orders then active in the city. Some of these youngmen of religion succeeded their fathers in leading their respectivebranches of these orders, but for all of them the teaching of al-Shaykhal-Akbar became the focus of interest. After the amir chose MuÈam-mad al-F§sÊ as his guide on the sufi path, many of them followedsuit and also joined the latter’s order, the Sh§dhiliyya. These disci-ples of #Abd al-Q§dir came from two principal groupings which wereparticularly receptive to his ideas. The first was the immigrant #ula-ma and sufi shaykhs from Algeria, who had shared his plight at thehands of the French and continued to regard him as both theirspiritual and their political leader. The core of the Algerian groupwas made up of adherents of the RaÈm§nÊ branch of the Khalwatiyyaorder. #Abd al-Q§dir himself and his family, which also produced anumber of prominent scholars, belonged, as mentioned above, to theQ§diriyya. The second group was the Damascene #ulama who hadmaintained reformist inclinations from the time of Shaykh Kh§lid2-6.p659/19/00, 12:53 PM193"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"chapter six194within the framework of the Naqshbandiyya order. For them, themain appeal of #Abd al-Q§dir lay in his teaching, in which they founda suitable formulation of the views they were coming to hold underthe new circumstances of the early Tanzimat regime. In the first partof this chapter I present the leading disciples in the circle of #Abdal-Q§dir from among these two groups.The NaqshbandÊ-Kh§lidÊ #ulama of early Tanzimat Damascus weredeeply concerned about the obstruction of these religiously motivatedreforms by their colleagues of the Ottoman tendency. The latter, andurban notables in general, had been harnessed to the efforts of theOttoman government to impose a more centralized rule on theprovince, while at the same time they diverted the new burden oftaxation and conscription onto the middle and lower strata of so-ciety. Since their economic interests were concentrated in the tradi-tional textile industries and in the agriculture of the Ghåãa,1 thesemen were also anxious to withhold from non-Muslims their prom-ised rights, which enabled them to take advantage of the new Euro-pean-dominated trade, and may have been behind many of theviolent incidents against them.2 The Kh§lidÊ #ulama, by contrast, aswe have seen in the case of MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ, remained loyalto the teaching of their master, preferring to shun administrative officeand to base their social standing upon posts they inherited from theirfathers in the mosques and colleges. They may thus be described,over against their “Ottoman” counterparts, as the #ulama of “the localtendency”. Moreover, these “local” #ulama, mostly residing in theMayd§n and the adjacent southern quarters of Damascus, seem tohave drawn nearer to the chieftains who, in cooperation with thelocal christians, controlled the booming export of the \\awr§n grainto Europe. The ties were then strengthened by their attachment to#Abd al-Q§dir, who himself participated in this trade and from whommost of them received substantial stipends. This connection helpsexplain the tolerant attitude of the reformist #ulama toward the non-Muslim communities in general, and their endeavor to protectEuropean nationals and local Christians during the riots of 1860 inparticular.1 Schatkowski Schilcher, Families in Politics, pp. 71-75; James A.

Thefoci of activity for the #ulama of the local tendency, who were close-ly associated with #Abd al-Q§dir, were the office of \\anafÊ mufti andthe Sulaym§niyya lodge. It was among these “local” #ulama that thefirst formulations of a rationalist reform of the traditional sciencesappeared, especially in the fields of hadith and jurisprudence. Theseare analyzed in the third section.I conclude this chapter with a discussion of a more traditionalAkbarÊ awakening that developed on the margin of #Abd al-Q§diral-Jaz§\"irÊ’s circle, within the framework of the YashruãÊ branch ofthe Sh§dhiliyya. Although the center of this branch was in Acre,where its founder, #AlÊ Når al-DÊn al-YashruãÊ, was located, itsinfluence was felt throughout Syria. YashruãÊ himself maintainedpersonal contact with #Abd al-Q§dir and strictly adhered to theshari#a, yet among his lower-strata followers, especially in the smallertowns, there developed antinomian inclinations. These representeda revulsion at the social polarizaton and hardening economic situa-tion which afflicted Syria with the inauguration of the Ottoman eraof reform.The Algerian EmigrationThe Algerian emigration to Syria in the wake of the French occu-pation began almost a decade before #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ set-tled in Damascus at the end of 1855. The first wave of immigrants,comprising more than four hundred people, arrived in the city asearly as 1847, the year of #Abd al-Q§dir’s surrender. It was headedby AÈmad ibn S§lim, one of the amir’s five senior military command-ers, whose area of responsibility had included the Berber-populatedhigh Kabylia mountains. He was the last commander to surrenderto the French, in February 1847, mere ten month before #Abd al-2-6.p659/19/00, 12:53 PM195"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"chapter six196Q§dir himself did so. Ibn S§lim was a pious man of marabouticlineage, though in Syria too he continued to fill military functions.3He was accompanied by a large group of men of religion from theKabylia mountains who, in line with #Abd al-Q§dir’s fatwa, preferredto migrate to a Muslim-governed country rather than live underinfidel rule. This group was headed by MuÈammad al-MahdÊ al-Sikl§wÊ (al-Zaw§wÊ) and MuÈammad al-Mub§rak, two local shaykhsof the Khalwatiyya–RaÈm§niyya order.The RaÈm§niyya bears the name of MuÈammad ibn #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-JurjårÊ (1715-1793 or 1720-1784), a native of the Kabyliawho, owing to his studies in Egypt, gained the additional epithet ofal-AzharÊ.4 There he trod the KhalwatÊ path under the guidance ofMuÈammad S§lim al-\\ifnÊ, the disciple and associate of Mußãaf§ al-BakrÊ who headed the renewal activity of this order in Egypt in thelater half of the eighteenth century.5 Returning to Algeria at thebehest of his master, JurjårÊ was successfully engaged in spreadingthe KhalwatÊ path among the Berber tribes of the Kabylia, as wellas in the principal cities of the coast, Constantine and even Algiers.Under his successor, #AlÊ ibn #^s§ (d. 1837), the RaÈm§niyya devel-oped into a distinct branch, while at the same time loosing its cen-tralized character, its numerous lodges turning to independent cen-ters of activity according to the local interests of their heads.Consequently, most of them were not involved in resisting the Frenchinvasion of Algeria in 1830.6 One of the few exceptions was #AlÊ ibn#^s§ himself, with whom were associated AÈmad ibn S§lim, his coun-selor and confidant,7 and MuÈammad al-MahdÊ al-Sikl§wÊ (1786-3 Bardin, p. 6.4 For MuÈammad ibn #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-JurjårÊ see Julia A.

Mub§rak was particularly active in spread-ing the order and, after the French invasion, supported Amir #Abdal-Q§dir in preaching jihad and in organizing supplies for the war-riors.8Upon arriving in Damascus, this new Algerian community settledmostly in the southern Suwayqa quarter, which bordered on theMayd§n. Sikl§wÊ, who became the principal guide (muqaddam) of theKhalwatiyya order in the city, took over the nearby Khu·ayriyyacollege, where he began to conduct dhikr ceremonies and guide dis-ciples.

FollowingMadanÊ’s death, F§sÊ departed for Mecca, where he established hisown lodge and engaged in guidance.

The elder, MuÈammad al-•ayyib (1839-1896), studied theAkbarÊ teaching with #Abd al-Q§dir, as well as M§likÊ law and var-ious non-religious sciences with two of his disciples.

He wasalso more devoted to his studies, specializing in Arabic grammar andliterature, besides his engagement in the AkbarÊ teaching and theKhalwatÊ path of his ancestors. Mub§rak had the closest ties with#Abd al-Q§dir among the Algerian exiles. He admired the amir, whoreciprocated by entrusting him with the education of his sons andby supporting him with a monthly stipend.

This tendency was combined with religious erudition,far exceeding that of the RaÈm§nÊ shaykhs of the High Kabylia. #Abdal-Q§dir himself occasionally ordained disciples from among theAlgerian community, but his main concern was with the AkbarÊteaching, which he saw as the common foundation for all the or-ders. The mission he believed to have been entrusted upon him wasdesigned for all the conscientious religious men of Damascus, notonly for his own compatriots. This was perhaps one reason for #Abdal-Q§dir’s decision to settle in the central #Am§ra quarter, rather thanamong the Algerian community in the south.19 The original Q§dirÊpath of the family was maintained however by his brothers, whojoined him two years later. Although one of them soon left for Istan-bul, the rest chose to settle in the southern B§b SarÊja quarter, inthe vicinity of the other immigrants from their country. There theyconducted the ceremonies of the order in the #Ann§ba mosque, whichbears the name of the Algerian town in which they stayed beforedeparting for Syria. They were headed by #Abd al-Q§dir’s elderbrother, MuÈammad Sa#Êd (d. 1861), their father’s successor as theprincipal shaykh of the Q§diriyya in Algeria and an outstanding #alimin his own right.20 Sa#Êd was then succeeded by his son, MuÈammadMurta·§ (1829-1902), who was close to #Abd al-Q§dir and took thepath directly from him. He also visited #Abd al-Q§dir al-JÊl§nÊ’s tombin Baghdad and received authorization from the current head of itslodge.

Thefirst was in the days of Sultan MaÈmåd II, probably during the 1820s,when he attended the lessons of prominent #ulama of the city, in-cluding #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-KuzbarÊ, Sa#Êd al-\\alabÊ, and MuÈam-mad AmÊn #$bidÊn. We have no evidence that he ever met ShaykhKh§lid. Thereafter, MaghribÊ probably continued on to Istanbul,where he studied with #$rif \\ikmet Bey, an outstanding #alim witha NaqshbandÊ background who gave his support to the early Tan-zimat reforms.26 With #$rif’s recommendation, he was nominated tobe the Arabic teacher of the Sultan’s son, #AbdülmecÊd, and for atime frequented the palace.27 The second stay of MaghribÊ in Dam-ascus was under the very different circumstances of #AbdülmecÊd’sreign. Having gained the respect of many religious men in the city,he was given the honor of delivering a lesson in the Umayyad mosque,and then was assigned a position in the adjacent D§r al-\\adÊth al-Ashrafiyya. In the latter position, however, MaghribÊ soon becamecaught up in a bitter struggle that lasted for almost a decade. Thisstruggle reflected the power accumulated by the #ulama of the Ot-toman tendency in Damascus under the early Tanzimat regime, thecriticism raised by the “local” #ulama at their conduct, and finallythe changes that #Abd al-Q§dir brought to the city on the eve of theintroduction of the late Tanzimat reforms.D§r al-\\adÊth al-Ashrafiyya was one of the most ancient and hal-lowed religious institutions in Damascus. Nevertheless, when Yåsufal-MaghribÊ arrived to undertake his teaching position, he was dis-mayed to find out that a Christian merchant had opened a wine shopin front of it and, even worse, had acquired part of the college it-self, even though it was a waqf property, to be used as a warehouse.Stunned, MaghribÊ complained to the governor and sought the helpof the #ulama. He soon discovered that the religious notables not onlyrefused to support him, but also blocked any action. Unwilling toconcede, he set out for Istanbul, where he enlisted the aid of his oldacquaintance, #$rif \\ikmet Bey, who had meanwhile been namedShaykh al-Isl§m, and with great effort obtained a Sultanic firman26 See R.

The governor, however, re-frained from carrying out even this order. In a letter he sent to #Abdal-Q§dir, MaghribÊ recounted how the heads of the council, the#ulama, and the qadi had argued that since the Christian was underconsular protection and had paid the poll tax ten years in advance,he could not be ousted from the college. In the course of this letterhe leveled fierce criticism at the conduct of the #ulama, “who earntheir living by reciting the Qur\"an, uttering the first part of the shah§da,representing in the courts, and reconciling between people in amanner which enables them to earn from both sides”, instead offulfilling their vocation. Rather than engaging in the major scienc-es, he went on, they concentrate on secondary books in some sub-jects without expertise or serious deliberation. The letter gives theclear impression that MaghribÊ had been persecuted by the leading#ulama of Damascus, and that, devoid of livelihood, he was forcedto leave for Medina.28It was #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ who finally rescued D§r al-\\adÊthal-Ashrafiyya. Yåsuf al-MaghribÊ first met the amir in Istanbul afterthe latter’s release from France. Recognizing his erudition and re-formist inclination, #Abd al-Q§dir treated him with great respect, andMaghribÊ even accompanied him to Bursa. Before his return toDamascus, he told the amir about the situation of the D§r al-\\adÊthand his efforts to rescue it. MaghribÊ continued to correspond with#Abd al-Q§dir about this affair from Medina, and when the amirarrived in Damascus he summoned the Christian wine seller and pur-chased his warehouse in D§r al-\\adÊth at full price. He renovatedthe college at his own expense and, inviting MaghribÊ back to Dam-ascus, assigned it to him and his descendents as a waqf. D§r al-\\adÊthal-Ashrafiyya was reinaugurated in 1858 with a hadith lesson taughtby #Abd al-Q§dir himself. Thereafter, MaghribÊ undertook instruc-tion, in addition to frequenting Damascus’ outlying quarters andvillages to preach among the inhabitants. On the occasion of thereopening of D§r al-\\adÊth he composed a long poem which be-trayed his bitterness toward his rivals, calling them honor-seekingnotables who ignore God’s word, and praised those who had sidedwith him. MaghribÊ does not specify who the first were, but theidentity of two of them may be inferred from their reaction to hisreturn. These were #Abdall§h al-\\alabÊ, the leader of the #ulama of28 Jaz§\"irÊ, TuÈfat al-Z§\"ir, pp. 610-612.2-6.p659/19/00, 12:53 PM203"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"chapter six204the Ottoman tendency in Damascus, who expressed indignation atthe attacks on his colleagues,29 and •§hir al-$midÊ, the \\anafÊ mufti,who made an effort now to avoid him.30 Both were among the citynotables banished to Cyprus in the wake of the 1860 riots.

These three assiduously devoted themselvesto the study of Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching under #Abd al-Q§dir’s guidance,and the notes they had been allowed to take during his lessons laterbecame the nucleus of Kit§b al-Maw§qif. A sincere friendship wasforged between them and the amir, which lasted to the end of hislife, and they competed in composing praise poetry in his honor.31Other #ulama from Damascus, whose fathers had also been ardentadherents of Shaykh Kh§lid in the previous generation, followed intheir footsteps. Most of these religious men resided in the southernquarters of the city, where the Algerian immigrants also concentratedafter their arrival, and close relations were soon to develop betweenthe two groups.MuÈammad al-•anã§wÊ (1825-1882)32 was one of the outstand-ing reformist #ulama in Damascus during the Tanzimat period.

These rebuked him for his rash action and for putting themin trouble, but he justified himself by saying that his aids inducedhim to do so. The #ulama and the notables, led by the naqib al-ashraf,then set out to release BÊã§r, who after receiving the apology of theqadi returned home escorted by his supporters. #Abd al-Razz§qrefrains from mentioning who was responsible for the arrest of hisfather, but his description leaves little room for doubt that it was the#ulama and notables themselves, who came to regard unfavorablythe independent activity of their Mayd§nÊ counterparts.

AÈmad, who de-voted himself to instruction, used in his lessons to deduce evidencefrom the Qur\"an and the sunna to support each of the four schoolsof Law. MuÈammad, by contrast, engaged himself principally inwriting. He is depicted in the sources as meticulously studying thejudgments of ancient mujtahids and seeking to revive the abandonedlegal schools and the judgments of forgotten #ulama. His writings willbe analyzed in the next chapter, as part of the emerging oppositionto Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II’s policies. MuÈammad al-•ÊbÊ (1830-1900),the grandson of #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-•ÊbÊ, studied the religious scienceswith his grandfather, and the renewed sciences of arithmetic andgeometry with \\asan al-ShaããÊ.

He accepted thepost only reluctantly, but exerted much effort to develop the area,establishing schools in the villages and erecting mosques.59Finally, affinity for the religious reform trend led by #Abd al-Q§diral-Jaz§\"irÊ in Damascus was discernible even among members of theestablished #ulama families whose fathers had been among ShaykhKh§lid’s disciples in the previous generation. Members of the GhazzÊand KuzbarÊ families took advantage of the early Tanzimat reformsand attained positions of influence in the city, but during the riotsof 1860 they nonetheless actively participated in defending theChristians.

In the wake of the 1860 riots he gained the lucrative appoint-ment of naqib al-ashraf of Damascus, even though his family hadnot until then been considered as belonging to the Prophet’s descen-dents. The current opinion was that he gained this appointmentbecause he locked the iron gate of his house in the Sh§ghår quarterand thus prevented the mob from attacking its Christian residents.64The correspondence between the Damascene #ulama who joinedthe religious reform led by #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ under the in-spiration of the AkbarÊ teaching after 1855, and the group thatbelonged to the renewal movement headed by Shaykh Kh§lid withinthe framework of the NaqshbandÊ order in 1823-1827, is indeedstriking. It can be seen both in the family affiliations of the #ulamaof the two generations and in the nature of their relationship to theheads of these two consecutive reform trends. Thus, MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ and #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r, who figured prominently in #Abdal-Q§dir’s circle, were the sons of Kh§lid’s most faithful adherentsin the order in Damascus, his local deputy and his representative inthe Mayd§n.

Socially, this corre-spondence points to the measure of continuity in the reformist in-clination among this group of #ulama families, which undoubtedlyreflected their basic interests. Ideologically, it shows that, to a largeextent, the AkbarÊ theosophy replaced the NaqshbandÊ path as themost adequate articulation of these families’ distresses and desiresin the new circumstances emerging in Syria as a result of the twoprocesses of the Tanzimat reforms and European economic pene-tration. This correspondence also raises the curious paradox that,in both cases, the local #ulama of Damascus only managed to con-solidate their reformist inclinations through religious leaders whocame from outside.The Rise of the Local TendencyAlong with the local NaqshbandÊ–Kh§lidÊ #ulama and the sufi shaykhsof the Algerian community, there emerged in Damascus anothergroup of men of religion whose fathers had not accepted the lead-ership of Shaykh Kh§lid in the previous generation, but who nowbecame attached to #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ. This group of localtendency #ulama resided mostly in the old city, around the #Am§raquarter in which the amir himself settled. Like the KuzbarÊs and theGhazzÊs, they came from established religious families and had heldinfluential positions in the city during the early Tanzimat period.Most of these #ulama had studied with Abå Bakr al-Kil§lÊ (d. 1863),who in many respects was MuÈammad al-•anã§wÊ’s counterpart inthe northern part of Damascus. Like •anã§wÊ, Kil§lÊ was a Naqsh-bandÊ sufi and an erudite scholar, who dedicated himself to teach-ing in the humble Wird mosque.

Both #Aãã§r and \\amza were close associatesof #Abd al-Q§dir, and were considerably influenced by his thought.It was in their circles that the first expressions in Damascus of re-form in the religious sciences, principally in jurisprudence and ha-dith studies, appeared.SalÊm al-#Aãã§r (1817-1890) was the preeminent leader of the lo-cal tendency in Damascus during the late Tanzimat period.

Yet, #Aãã§rwent beyond this type of traditional leadership, and was deeplyinvolved in the political and social affairs of Syria. In his house alarge group of notables, including not only religious scholars andstudents but also merchants, met regularly to hear his lessons andto discuss the current events of the country.69There is no evidence in the sources that SalÊm al-#Aãã§r was ac-tive in his ancestors’ order, the Q§diriyya, yet like most #ulama ofthe local tendency he showed keen interest in the sufi teaching. #Aãã§rtaught Ghaz§lÊ’s IÈy§\" #Ulåm al-DÊn, as had his grandfather, and delvedinto the AkbarÊ expositions, including the Maw§qif, under #Abd al-Q§dir’s inspiration.

Instead of reading the Propheticsayings and elucidating them according to the authoritative commen-tators, he would examine each hadith in the light of the variousreligious sciences, particularly Sufism and jurisprudence. In the lat-ter field #Aãã§r was, moreover, not content with the rulings of hisown Sh§fi#Ê school, but would adduce the arguments of all the schoolsfor each given problem. #Ulama of the different schools were attractedto his lessons, and he encouraged debate between them, in the endchoosing the best supported ruling. \\ißnÊ boasted that this was thefirst scientific teaching in the Arab countries, bringing great honorto Damascus. Though an exaggeration, this assertion underlines thereformist thrust inherent in #Aãã§r’s instruction. Its two pillars werethe combination of the sciences of hadith and Sufism, and the weak-ening of the authority of taqlÊd by seeking proofs for the rulings ofthe law schools in the Qur\"an and the sunna.71 #Aãã§r’s teaching thusreflected the reform that #Abd al-Q§dir suggested through sufi the-osophy from the viewpoint of the science of hadith.SalÊm al-#Aãã§r’s rise to a position of religious leadership in Dam-ascus after 1860 was paradoxically facilitated by Fu\"§d Pasha’s strivingto weaken the hold of the #ulama on the city. To this end, the Ot-toman minister had entrusted the post of \\anafÊ mufti to an outsid-er, MuÈammad AmÊn al-JundÊ (1814-1878) from Ma#arrat al-Nu#m§n,the Arab scribe of the Turkish army in Syria.

One was themaster’s own son, MuÈammad £§fir al-MadanÊ (d. 1906), who hadsettled in Istanbul shortly before #AbdülÈamÊd II’s accession and washarnessed to his Islamic policy. He was put in charge of disseminat-ing the Sultan’s propaganda among the inhabitants of the North Af-rican provinces of the empire, much as Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ wasdoing in the Asian provinces.83 In Syria much more important wasthe influence of #AlÊ Når al-DÊn al-YashruãÊ (ca.1815-1899), who hadfounded his own branch in the order, the Yashruãiyya. Born into ahigh-standing sharÊfian family in Bizerta, Tunisia, YashruãÊ servedMadanÊ in his lodge in Mißr§ta for thirteen years, and after his deathcame to regard himself as his successor to the rank of “the pole ofhis age”. He spent several years travelling to spread his master’s order,before landing in Acre around 1850. YashruãÊ was able to form acircle of disciples from among the notables of the city, including themufti and one of the leading merchants, while at the same timepointedly avoiding the rulers. His first lodge was established in 1862in the small town of TarshiÈa in the Upper Galilee, where he wasobliged to move because of bad health.

He was pardoned a year later, partly due to theintercession of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, and before returning to Acrehe stayed with the amir in Damascus and married his own daugh-ter to one of his brothers. In the following years YashruãÊ managedto spread his order throughout Syria, from Aleppo in the north toGaza in the south. He himself undertook journeys to various townsand sent his propagandists to others, while many admirers flockedto the lodge he now established in Acre. His success was continued,and even increased, during the reign of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd.84#AlÊ Når al-DÊn al-YashruãÊ’s list of disciples reveals that outstanding#ulama from almost every Syrian city joined his order.85 He himselfwas learned in the religious sciences and taught in his lodge juris-prudence, hadith, and Qur\"an exegesis, besides sufi thought. Thelatter was centered on the books of Ibn #ArabÊ. In his guidance,YashruãÊ was faithful to the path of the Sh§dhiliyya, which like theNaqshbandiyya stresses reliance upon the Qur\"an and the sunna,claims to be the shortest way to God, recommends active engage-ment in this world, and rejects excessive asceticism. He was eveninclined toward the silent dhikr, though in the lodge he used for thebenefit of his disciples the vocal dhikr accompanied by music.86Numerous #ulama, including SalafÊs like #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r andRashÊd Ri·§, testified that YashruãÊ fully adhered to the shari#a.87Among his disciples, however, the situation was often different.Groups of YashruãÊ’s followers who deliberately transgressed shari#acommandments and social customs sprang up throughout Syria, morein the small towns than in the larger cities, claiming to have attainedthe sufi goal and to have been released from the obligations bind-ing upon the common believers.88 Moreover, a perusal of the bio-graphical dictionaries of Syria in the second half of the nineteenthcentury shows that the phenomenon of unorthodox sufis was foundalmost exclusively among the adherents of this order.

YashruãÊ announced publiclythat he would dismiss from the order anyone who neglected adher-ence to the Qur\"an and the sunna, but groups of his followers whodid so continued to exist in Syria until the end of the OttomanEmpire. This split in the Yashruãiyya was no less evident in Dam-ascus.Damascus was an important center of the Yashruãiyya in Syria.The order became active in the city at the beginning of the 1860s,attracting #ulama and merchants of the city, as well as common peoplefrom the surrounding villages. Following this early success, YashruãÊnominated two local deputies. One of them was As#ad \\amza (1822-1890), the brother of MaÈmåd \\amza and like him a close friendof #Abd al-Q§dir. As#ad specialized in the sciences of arithmetic,geometry, and inheritances with \\asan al-ShaããÊ, and held his firstadministrative posts in the committees appointed by Fu\"§d Pasha inthe wake of the 1860 riots. Some time later he set out for YashruãÊ’slodge in Acre and, after treading the path, received from him authori-zation to guide. Returning to Damascus, \\amza tried to conductthe dhikr ceremonies in various mosques, but apparently with littlesuccess. He then rejoined the Ottoman legal administration in 1869,two years after his brother’s nomination as mufti, and specializedin representing people’s cases against the government. Large profitsfrom this work led him into a life of luxury, despite the concern ofhis colleagues. This did not prevent As#ad from seeking the post of\\anafÊ mufti following his brother’s death in 1887, though the Otto-mans chose MuÈammad al-ManÊnÊ.89 The other deputy of YashruãÊin Damascus, MaÈmåd Abå al-Sh§m§t (1849-1922), was a genera-tion younger. The scion of a wealthy merchant family from the southof the city, Abå al-Sh§m§t had been attracted to the Yashruãiyyaalready as an adolescent. He set out for TarshiÈa and trod the pathtogether with YashruãÊ’s son, who became his close friend.

These apparently joined the or-der due to the efforts of a deputy who was spreading its path in thetownship of \\arast§. The outstanding figure among them was Sa#Êdal-Usãuw§nÊ, who was responsible for the revival of the family’s powerin the early Tanzimat period and owned agricultural lands in thearea.92 His second was Abå al-Naßr al-KhaãÊb (1837-1906), the young-est among the four sons of #Abd al-Q§dir al-KhaãÊb, who was as-signed by his father to study M§likÊ law in the circle of #Abd al-Q§diral-Jaz§\"irÊ.93 For years the senior religious man of \\arast§, Abå al-Naßr later served as qadi in other provinces of the Empire, return-ing to Damascus only toward the end of his life. Upon the death ofManÊnÊ in 1898, KhaãÊb sought to attain the post of \\anafÊ mufti ofthe city too, but again to no avail.94The head of the Damascene YashruãÊ group that deviated fromthe shari#a was Sa#Êd al-Kh§lidÊ (1806-1877), the preacher of the town-ship of Kafr Såsiy§. Our principal source of information about himis BÊã§r, who knew him personally and was alarmed by his actions.Kh§lidÊ, who had studied with the leading reformist #ulama of Dam-ascus, particularly with MuÈammad al-•anã§wÊ, was depicted by bÊã§ras an exceptionally erudite and pious #alim who engaged fearlesslyin “enjoining the good and forbidding the evil”, but then underwenta complete transformation under the influence of the Yashruãiyya.Kh§lidÊ, who had taken the path initially from one of YashruãÊ’sdeputies, subsequently set out to Acre to tread the path under the90 On AmÊn al-BÊã§r, the nephew of \\asan al-BÊã§r, see \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp.237-238.

This led him,however, to abandon the religious sciences and to mock the #ulamawho practiced them. He also neglected many religious precepts,claiming that these are incumbent upon the common believers (#§mmatal-maÈjåbÊn), but not upon those who are befriended by God (maÈbåbÊn).Kh§lidÊ gathered a group of followers who openly and intentionallycommitted sinful acts, and when YashruãÊ sent them a letter of re-proach they interpreted it as a blessing. Many joined this group, andthey became a powerful and zealous band that caused considerablealarm. BÊã§r maintains that YashruãÊ was banished in 1864 becauseof the deeds of Kh§lidÊ and his men, who were banished along withhim. Upon returning to Kafr Såsiy§, Kh§lidÊ reverted to his old ways,though now his band’s activities were restricted by the authorities.The inhabitants of the town finally expelled him from their midstand, after he was also humiliated in Damascus, he returned to thetown of his birth, D§rayy§, where he earned his livelihood as a teach-er. Despite these tribulations Sa#Êd al-Kh§lidÊ stuck to his antinomi-an ideas to the end of his life.95It is difficult to know why it was particularly among the adher-ents of the Yashruãiyya that this deliberate deviation from the shari#awas manifested. There seems little room for doubt, however, that itderived from a monistic interpretation of the doctrine of waÈdat al-wujåd. BÊã§r offers as an example Kh§lidÊ’s claim that “those whoenter the path and ascend through the stages, their essence becomedivine essence (#ayn al-dh§t) and their attributes divine attributes (#aynal-ßif§t). Is it incumbent upon God to perform the prayer or to fast?Can it be said in relation to His truth that a thing is permitted orforbidden?” YashruãÊ himself certainly did not espouse such an in-terpretation of “the unity of being”, but his readiness to accept dis-ciples from all strata of society, in contradistinction to the prudentapproach #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ was so careful to maintain, re-sulted in teaching Ibn #ArabÊ’s thought to the unqualified.The scope of this antinomian eruption in Syria was large enoughto concern #Abd al-Q§dir, who referred to it a number of times inthe Maw§qif. Transmitting the secrets of Lordship (asr§r al-rubåbiyya),he wrote in one place, is likely to generate two sorts of harm. Thetransmitter of these secrets may be accused of heresy, while the onereceiving them may be tempted, become perplexed, or simply mis-95 BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 669-673.2-6.p659/19/00, 12:53 PM223"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"chapter six224understand, and thus to lose his way. This, in #Abd al-Q§dir’s opin-ion, is the explanation for what happened in the Yashruãiyya. “Wehave seen in our time disciples who have heard some divine secretsand truths from their shaykhs and begun to speak about them inpublic. They have exhibited abominable recklessness, ignominy, andabasement of the exalted God, and uttered expressions which theyhave by no means understood or tasted. It seems to us, and Godknows, that their shaykhs picked them from books, or from others,without experiencing and comprehending their reality. If they knewtheir reality, they would have guarded them and been as stingy withthem as with gold.”96 The shaykhs to whom #Abd al-Q§dir was re-ferring were the heads of the deviant bands, such as Sa#Êd al-Kh§lidÊ,rather than YashruãÊ himself. For him these followers of theYashruãiyya represented the most compelling contemporary exam-ple of those holding a b§ãinÊ view, whose belief in the absolute unityof God leads them to maintain that since they reached the degreeof Lordship (maq§m al-rubåbiyya) they are no longer bound by the com-mandments of the shari#a.97 According to Abd al-Q§dir’s understand-ing of the AkbarÊ teaching, they turned their mystical experience ofwaÈdat al-shuhåd, in which the sufi sees God as the one reality to theexception of His creatures, into a sober teaching that distorts the truemeaning of waÈdat al-wujåd, in which he again perceives the differ-ence between the Lord and his servants in their relationship ofmutuality vested in God within the unity of being.96 Jaz§\"irÊ, Mawqif 158, vol. 1, pp. 318-320.97 Ibid., Mawqif 358, vol. 3, pp. 185-186.2-6.p659/19/00, 12:53 PM224"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"local renaissance under the centralizing regimes225CHAPTER SEVENLOCAL RENAISSANCE UNDER THE CENTRALIZINGREGIMES (1883-1918)#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s call to formulate an adequate response tothe challenge of the West stimulated among his disciples, along withthe mystic quest, also a new interest in fields which traditional Muslimlearning had considered as auxiliary sciences, and which in the earlyTanzimat period had almost disappeared. Central among them werehistory and Arabic language and literature. This renewed interestbecame much more pronounced after the amir’s death, in reactionto the centralized autocratic regime of #AbdülÈamÊd II. The specialattention that the Sultan paid to the affairs of Syria derived fromhis concern about the sense of a local supra-confessional identity thathad developed during the late Tanzimat period, with the encour-agement of the government, among its inhabitants, particularly thegrowing middle class of Beirut. To counteract this Syrian-Arabpatriotic feeling, #AbdülÈamÊd dismantled the extensive province ofSyria which had been created by the Vilayet Law of 1864, leavingDamascus the capital of a truncated strip of land on the edge of thedesert. This was also the principal aim of his Islamic policy, as prop-agated by Shaykh Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ.1The leading #ulama in the cultural renaissance of Damascus dur-ing the \\amÊdian, and Young Turk, periods were local men ofreligion whose fathers had joined the renewal movement of ShaykhKh§lid in the first part of the century before they themselves joinedthe circle of #Abd al-Q§dir. Their main interest was in local history,though unlike their counterparts in Beirut, they emphasized theIslamic heritage of their city rather than of Syria at large. The Alge-rian disciples of #Abd al-Q§dir who participated in this cultural re-generation tended to engage more in Arabic language and literaturestudies. They included both those members of the Jaz§\"irÊ family whohad chosen to shun the Ottoman administration and sons of the sufishaykhs who had led the emigration from the High Kabylia moun-1 Abu-Manneh, “The Province of Syria,” pp. 8-26; idem, “Abdulhamid and Abul-huda,” pp. 143-148.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM225"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"chapter seven226tains. The writing of the reformist #ulama in #Abd al-Q§dir’s circlelagged perceptibly behind their ideas, reflecting the wide gap betweenthe traditional mode of thinking on which they were raised and thenew outlook they were gradually acquiring. In the latter, they wereparticularly influenced by two developments affecting Syria since thelate Tanzimat period. One was the new Ottoman educational sys-tem being gradually introduced by the modernizing state.2 The otherwas the emergence of the Arab press, through which these men coulddraw inspiration not only from the sense of local patriotism radiat-ing from Beirut, but also from the freer cultural atmosphere of Egypt.3The first part of this chapter is dedicated to an examination of theactivities and writings of the #ulama belonging to these two groups.The special interest in the local heritage among #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s disciples was, however, part of a larger response by Dam-ascene reformist #ulama to the new realities of #AbdülÈamÊd II’s rule.These men of religion were alarmed by the ascendancy in Damascus,and throughout the Empire, of #ulama and sufi shaykhs whose meritlay more in their readiness to be harnessed to the Islamic policy ofthe Sultan than in religious piety or erudition. They were furtherconcerned about the inability of this new religious leadership to copewith the new Westernizing elite then emerging in the city as a re-sult of the accelerated pace of modernization. The strength of thislocal—reformist tendency in Damascus shrank during the \\amÊdi-an period under pressure from their Ottoman—orthodox rivals. Atthe same time, the leading families among them tended to be rec-onciled to the state by their integration into its emerging landown-ing—bureaucratic elite. The \\amÊdian regime thus managed increas-ingly to isolate the #ulama raised in #Abd al-Q§dir’s circle, the only2 On the new Ottoman educational system and its implementation in Syria seeDeringil, pp. 93-111; #Abd al-#AzÊz MuÈammad #Awa·, Al-Id§ra al-#Uthm§niyya fÊWil§yat Såriya, 1864-1914 (Cairo, 1969), pp. 252-265; Roded, pp. 129-136; Com-mins, 14-16.3 For the emergence of Syrian patriotism among the middle class of Beirut seeButrus Abu-Manneh, “The Christians between Ottomanism and Syrian Nation-alism: The Ideas of Butrus al-Bustani,” IJMES, 11 (1980), pp. 287-304; FrumaSchreier-Zachs, “From Communal to Territorial Identity: the Emergence of theConcept of Syria, 1831-1881” (Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Haifa, 1997).

This trend represented both a pro-test against the oppressive conduct of the new upper class of the cityand a desire to benefit from the perceived benevolence of #Ab-dülÈamÊd II’s regime. Renewed loyalty to the Ottoman Sultan—Caliph was expressed by adherence to the traditional interpretationof the AkbarÊ teaching, as articulated by #$rif al-Munayyir, whichstressed the duty to obey rulers. Some of these men of religion ac-cordingly became committed opponents of the Salafiyya. This tra-ditionalist AkbarÊ trend was represented in Damascus primarily bythe YashruãÊ branch of the Sh§dhiliyya–Madaniyya order, which hadbeen active there since the late Tanzimat period, and by theDandar§wÊ branch of the RashÊdiyya, which began to spread in thecity during the \\amÊdian period.

The style of #Abd al-Q§dir’s dis-ciples remained basically traditional, though the youngest amongthem gradually acquired new methods of research and expressioninfluenced by the journalistic mode of writing and drawing on theexpanding vocabulary of the Arabic language.5 In this respect, theplace each of them held in the religious reform movement of Dam-ascus was determined by his ability to combine the traditional cul-ture in which he had been trained with the new ideas to which hewas increasingly being exposed.The combination of interest in history and literature is clearly dis-cernible in the writings of two of the closest Damascene disciples of#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, #Abd al-MajÊd al-Kh§nÊ and #Abd al-Razz§qal-BÊã§r. Kh§nÊ’s historical writing focused on the biographies of themasters of the order to which he belonged, the Naqshbandiyya.According to his own testimony in the introduction to Al-\\ad§\"iq al-Wardiyya, he had longed to study their lives since he first receivedthe path from his grandfather, before reaching maturity, beingmotivated by the NaqshbandÊ principle of binding one’s heart to theProphet and to God through the shaykh.6 Resolving in 1882 toundertake this task, Kh§nÊ made use of a long list of NaqshbandÊand non-NaqshbandÊ sources, after having mastered the Persianlanguage specifically for this project.7 He maintained throughout hiswork a measure of scientific rigor that makes his book an importantsource of information not only about the Kh§lidÊ sub-order, but alsoabout the Naqshbandiyya in general from its inception within themystical tradition of Central Asia. Kh§nÊ’s reputation, however, layprincipally in the literary field, and he was considered one of theleading poets of Damascus in his time. His first practice was in thecircle of #Abd al-Q§dir, who greatly encouraged him.

His prin-cipal work, and the only one to be published, \\ilyat al-Bashar, is anencyclopedia of the religious men, and notables in general, of thethirteenth hijrÊ century, principally in Damascus but also in other partsof the Muslim world. It is occasionally interlaced with narration ofimportant events he witnessed in Damascus, such as the Egyptianregime and the riots of 1860. Like Kh§nÊ, BÊã§r was attracted tohistory at an early age, after joining #Abd al-Q§dir’s circle, and hecontinued to collect material for his biographies for most of his life.The book includes a considerable amount of material of a legend-ary character, but in some of the later parts, written during the\\amÊdian period, the beginnings of a more critical attitude becomediscernible.9 Alongside this biographical dictionary, BÊã§r is report-ed to have authored about ten other books, some of them legal ortheological expositions, and the rest literary works. He also hosteda scholarly—literary circle in his house, frequented by numerous#ulama and literatures, and was fond of Arab music and singing.10A close friend and ally of these two #ulama, though less conspic-uous in the circle of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, was Sa#Êd al-Q§simÊ(1843-1900), the son of Q§sim al-\\all§q, who like \\asan al-BÊã§rand MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the elder took the NaqshbandÊ path underthe direction of Shaykh Kh§lid.11 \\all§q’s attitude towards #Abd al-Q§dir is not specified by our sources, but it is clear that his positionwas considerably improved after the riots of 1860, when he was ap-pointed to be Sh§fi#Ê imam of the prestigious Sin§niyya mosque,renewing there the hadith and jurisprudence studies.

Bahjat re-lates that his grandfather allowed him to edit and amend the manuscript, clearlywith the intention that he omit or ameliorate the biographies written in his earlycareer which were no longer compatible with his later SalafÊ outlook and stan-dards. Nonetheless, after many consultations Bahjat decided to publish the bookas it was. #Abd al-Razz§q himself mentions in his introduction that he followed inthe footsteps of MuÈibbÊ and Mur§dÊ, the principal biographers of the notables ofDamascus in the eleventh and twelve hijrÊ centuries respectively, and that his objectwas to preserve their memory.

Acquiring his religious education initially with his father,Q§simÊ completed it under the tutelage of two associates of Abd al-Q§dir, MuÈammad al-•anã§wÊ and SalÊm al-#Aãã§r. Moreover, oneof the six copies of the amir’s Maw§qif preserved in the Asad Library,the one on which the second printed edition is based, was copied in1891 by him together with his more illustrious son, as the signature“MuÈammad Sa#Êd al-\\all§q Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ” testifies.13 Sa#Êdsucceeded his father in the Sin§niyya and \\ass§n mosques after hisdeath in 1867. Like BÊã§r, he also assembled in his house a circle ofreligious and literary men, who along with their discussions wereencouraged to sing during their meetings.14 For his living Q§simÊmaintained, besides his posts, a business of importing utensils, thoughlater, probably during the \\amÊdian period, he was obliged to aban-don it.15 Referring to this later period his son, Jam§l al-DÊn, stressesthat his father emphatically shunned the company of notables andoffice holders. He did not seek government posts, denounced those#ulama who accepted them, and in general preferred to shut him-self in his home. Q§simÊ’s bitter criticism of the official #ulama ofDamascus, and of its new Westernizing elite, was clearly expressedin the poems he composed in his later years.16The “historical” works of MuÈammad Sa#Êd al-Q§simÊ were alsocomposed toward the end of his life, largely with the encouragementof •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ and of his own son, Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ.Outstanding among them is Q§mås al-‘in§#§t al-Sh§miyya, an encyclo-pedic work on the handicrafts practiced in Damascus during his time.This constitutes a major source for the economic history of the cityon the eve of the great changes it underwent with its fuller integra-12 Commins, p. 43.13 M§liÈ, Fihris Makhãåã§t, vol. 1, p. 816.14 AÈmad al-\\all§q al-BudayrÊ, \\aw§dith Dimashq al-Yawmiyya (Cairo, 1959), p.21.15 £§fir al-Q§simÊ, Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ wa-#Aßruhu (Damascus, 1965), p. 20;MuÈammad Sa#Êd al-Q§simÊ, Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ and KhalÊl al-#Aím, Q§måsal-‘in§#§t al-Sh§miyya (Paris, 1960), p. 8.16 \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp. 169-172; Q§simÊ, Ta#ãÊr al-Mash§mm, p. 27.

The introduction of the bookclearly shows that Q§simÊ shared the reformist outlook of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ and his circle. He opens with the assertion that theorder of the world (nií§m al-#§lam) depends upon the crafts, and thatthe practice of the salaf had been to combine them with the religioussciences and with letters. Drawing upon Ibn Khaldån, Q§simÊ fur-ther claims that livelihood and profit are a necessity, as well as ameasure of men’s actions. He quotes Qur\"anic verses and Prophetictraditions which encourage their pursuance and, in the footsteps ofGhaz§lÊ, he exempts from them only manual laborers, primarilypeasants, genuine sufis, practicing religious scholars, and rulers.Q§simÊ’s subsequent discussion of the relevant shari#a precepts,however, shows that behind his attitude toward livelihood and profitstand moral concerns; he emphasizes that these activities should notdistract one from recollecting God’s name or lead him to the temp-tations of this world.18 It was also Sa#Êd al-Q§simÊ who edited theYawmiyy§t of AÈmad al-BudayrÊ, a personal historical narrative aboutDamascus in the mid-eighteenth century, during the #Aím period.19In these same years Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ was working on hisown history of Damascus.

The #$bidÊns, forexample, continued the engagement of the founder of their family,MuÈammad AmÊn, with \\anafÊ jurisprudence. As we have seen, inthe late Tanzimat period they again accepted posts in the fatwa office;and in the Young Turk era one of AmÊn’s grandsons, Abå al-Khayr#$bidÊn (1852-1925), even managed to secure the position of mufti.#Abå al-Khayr, however, also compiled a history of the family, andhe is depicted in the sources as a man of letters.22 The ShaããÊs like-wise remained faithful to the tradition established by their grandfa-ther, \\asan, combining religious learning with specialization in thefields of inheritances and geometry. This tradition was followedparticularly by three of MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ’s sons who, in addi-tion, studied in state schools and were assigned to relevant admin-istrative and judicial posts in the province.23 The most promisingamong them was Mur§d al-ShaããÊ (1872-1897), who was also the firstmember of this family to show an inclination for history and liter-ature. Mur§d compiled a draft of the biographies of later \\anbalÊscholars, and composed poetry as well. He became attached to •§hiral-Jaz§\"irÊ, who greatly encouraged him, but died prematurely andleft his works unfinished.24In consequence of Mur§d’s death, the ShaããÊ family joined the cul-tural regeneration in Damascus only in the next generation, whenhis course was adopted by his nephew and disciple, MuÈammad JamÊlal-ShaããÊ (1882-1959). Like his predecessors, JamÊl acquired his edu-cation among the #ulama of his family, though later he became at-tached to Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ. Following his father, he began hiscareer in the religious courts of Damascus, his principal advance-ment coming during the Mandate period when he was nominated21 Ibid., p. 288.22 \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp. 403-404.23 On #Umar al-ShaããÊ (1861-1918) see ibid., pp. 361-362; On \\asan al-ShaããÊ(1880-1962) Ibid., pp. 763-764.24 Ibid., pp. 135-137; BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 1516-1517.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM232"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"local renaissance under the centralizing regimes233as the city’s \\anbalÊ mufti. ShaããÊ composed a large number of booksand articles, primarily in the fields of jurisprudence and inheritanc-es. Nevertheless, he was also attracted to history and literature. In1899, at the age of seventeen, he compiled his first treatise, consist-ing of biographies of one of the religious families of Damascus, andin 1904 he published a book of poetry. A year later, ShaããÊ begancollecting material for his biographical dictionary of the #ulama ofthe thirteenth hijrÊ century. This compilation, though, generally lacksoriginality and consists mainly of citations from previous sources. Itwas published only after independence, along with a continuationvolume dealing with the men of religion of the first half of the four-teenth century.25 The same lack of originality is perceptible in ShaããÊ’sbiographical dictionary of his own \\anbalÊ school, which was pub-lished in 1920. It comprises mainly excerpts from two older compi-lations, with an elaboration of the draft study prepared by his un-cle, Mur§d. To JamÊl al-ShaããÊ, however, we owe the publication ofnumerous family manuscripts, works analyzed throughout this study.26The last of the historian #ulama to emerge in Damascus at the endof the Ottoman period was MuÈammad AdÊb TaqÊ al-DÊn al-\\ißnÊ(1874-1940), though his book, Muntakhab§t al-Taw§rÊkh li-Dimashq, wascompiled mainly during the Mandate era. Unlike his colleagues, \\ißnÊwas not part of the AkbarÊ circle of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ. Never-theless, his father was the son-in-law and disciple in the NaqshbandÊorder of Abå Bakr al-Kil§lÊ, the teacher of many of the reformist#ulama of the city. The son of an important notable family, in 1908\\ißnÊ secured for himself the post of naqib al-ashraf, following ajourney to Istanbul. Discredited by the French authorities, he thenturned to writing. His extensive book, which appeared in threevolumes between 1927 and 1934, is not confined to biographicalsketches; like Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ’s work, it is a comprehensivedescription of Damascus. \\ißnÊ reviews the history of the city fromits beginnings in the pre-Islamic era, enumerates the prominent menwho lived there after the Arab conquest, and describes its cultural,social and economic conditions in his time. In the introduction hewrites that his love for his native city had long ago created in himthe desire to study its history, and that for this purpose he had through25 See the criticism of the first book, which is also valid for the second, byMuÈammad Kurd #AlÊ in Majallat al-Majma# al-#IlmÊ al-#ArabÊ, 22 (1947), pp. 272-273, and ShaããÊ’s rejoinder on pp. 474-475.26 \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp. 704-709.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM233"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"chapter seven234the years collected a large library. The principal disadvantage of\\ißnÊ’s otherwise impressive undertaking is its lack of accuracy.The Contribution of the Algerian CommunityAmong the Algerian members of #Abd al-Q§dir’s circle the firstmanifestations of a cultural regeneration can be seen primarily intheir interest in the Arabic language and its literature. As heirs tothe amir’s religious leadership of their community, these immigrant#ulama were also more anxious to preserve his sufi reformist heri-tage after his death. Their new leaders were AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ, #Abdal-Q§dir’s younger brother, who continued to work within the frame-work of the family branch of the Q§diriyya, and MuÈammad al-Mub§rak the younger who, following the death of his own brotherin 1895, became the senior shaykh of the Sh§dhiliyya–F§siyya inDamascus. In evaluating the literary and linguistic works of theAlgerian #ulama I continue to rely on contemporary and later crit-ics, but my main concern in this section will be with the develop-ment of their sufi thought under the regime of #AbdülÈamÊd II. Morespecifically, their work must be understood against the backdrop ofthe central government’s attempt to exploit the crisis of #Abd al-Q§dir’s death in 1883 to remove the Algerian community fromFrench patronage, break its coherence, and bring its members intothe Ottoman fold. This policy met with partial success, particularlyamong the amir’s sons in the #Am§ra quarter, who were alreadylargely assimilated into the local elite. Yet most Algerian exiles, whocontinued to live in the southern quarters, rejected the efforts of theOttoman administration and preserved their internal solidarity.27Furthermore, the active propaganda they carried on among theircompatriots, praising Syria and urging them to come and live un-der a Muslim rule, resulted in continuing growth for the DamasceneAlgerian community until the end of the Ottoman Empire.28The Ottoman policy of assimilating the Algerian community wasthus successful primarily in the family of #Abd al-Q§dir himself. Afterhis death the family split into two parts, one preferring to continueits economic and political ties with France, the other transferring its27 Bardin, pp. 11-12.28 Ibid., pp. 131-132; Charles-Robert Ageron, Les Algériens musulmans et la France(1871-1919) (Paris, 1968), vol. 2, pp. 1079-1083.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM234"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"local renaissance under the centralizing regimes235loyalty to the Ottoman government in exchange for high office andrank. The latter group was headed by MuÈammad al-Jaz§\"irÊ (1840-1913), whose detailed biography of his father was frequently con-sulted during the preparation of this study. According to his account,the sons and relatives of #Abd al-Q§dir assembled on the day afterhis death and chose him, MuÈammad, as their head. With thisauthorization, he applied to the governor to confirm the family’sstanding, and this referred the matter to the Sultan who assignedappropriate allowances to its members. He admits that this applica-tion caused some members of his family who preferred the Frenchpatronage to challenge him.29 MuÈammad al-Jaz§\"irÊ subsequentlybecame lieutenant in the Ottoman army and advanced to the rankof Pasha.30 His younger brother, MuÈyÊ al-DÊn (1843-1917), estab-lished contacts with the Ottoman government even earlier, duringhis father’s lifetime. He set out secretly for Algeria after the breakof the 1871 revolt against the French, in which the Khalwatiyya–RaÈm§niyya order of the Kabylia played a central role, and tookpart in several battles.31 He returned to Damascus at the demand ofhis father, who for a long time refused to forgive this act of disobe-dience. MuÈyÊ al-DÊn, however, received an allowance from Sultan#AbdülazÊz as a token of appreciation and, subsequently, #AbdülÈamÊdII awarded him the lucrative rank of amÊr al-umar§\" (chief commander)and summoned him to Istanbul to serve on the palace council ofmilitary inspection. Alongside his political activity MuÈyÊ al-DÊn al-Jaz§\"irÊ, like many members of his family, was proficient in the re-ligious sciences and literature, and also harbored sufi inclinations.32The rival group in the Jaz§\"irÊ family, which preferred the con-tinuation of French support to Ottoman patronage, consisted prin-cipally of #Abd al-Q§dir’s relatives in the southern quarters of Dam-ascus, under the leadership of his younger brother, AÈmad(1833-1902). Born in Algeria shortly before his father’s death, AÈmadal-Jaz§\"irÊ was raised by his elder brothers, MuÈammad Sa#Êd and#Abd al-Q§dir.

Once there,AÈmad completed his studies with MuÈammad al-•anã§wÊ, whomhe followed for many years, as well as with other members of #Abdal-Q§dir’s circle like MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the elder and Yåsuf al-MaghribÊ, and with Q§sim al-\\all§q. Under the amir himself hespecialized in Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching and in hadith studies. AÈmadshowed a clear predilection for the sufi quest. He eagerly read themystic expositions and took the Q§dirÊ path from his brother andfrom MuÈammad #AlÊ al-Kayl§nÊ, the order’s shaykh in Hamah.33As the last living son of MuÈyÊ al-DÊn al-Jaz§\"irÊ, AÈmad regardedhimself as designated to succeed #Abd al-Q§dir as head of the fam-ily and of its branch in the Q§diriyya. His main treatise, publisheda mere two years after the amir’s death, should be read against thisbackground. In this essentially sufi exposition, AÈmad sought todemonstrate that he was loyal to the legacy of his brother, but alsoto express his concern about the two elements that Sultan #Ab-dülÈamÊd II’s regime promoted—the #ulama of the Ottoman—or-thodox tendency and the Westernizers. His treatise was greatlypraised by the reformist #ulama of Damascus, especially MaÈmåd\\amza, who had encouraged him to write it in the first place.34AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s treatise was written as a commentary on thesaying attributed to #AlÊ that “knowledge is one (lit. a point) and onlythe ignorant divide it.” In the spirit of #Abd al-Q§dir’s rationalistbooks, AÈmad opens his exposition with an examination of the natureof knowledge. Defining it as the soul’s realization of the essence ofthings, he claims that this essence is indivisible just like a point, theunderlying substance (al-jawhar al-fard) of all existing things. Thediversity and changes of our world pertain to the accidents ratherthan to the substance, again like a point, which is formless by itselfyet comprises the basic element of all forms. AÈmad further follows#Abd al-Q§dir in attributing the variety of perceptions, the divisionof knowledge by the ignorant in #AlÊ’s saying, to the varying capac-ities (isti#d§d§t) of the perceiving. For God’s people there is only oneknowable object, “the Reality of the Prophet” (al-ÈaqÊqa al-MuÈam-33 \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp. 193-196; Q§simÊ, Ta#ãÊr al-Mash§mm, pp. 65-67.34 AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ, Nathr al-Durr wa-Basãuhu fÊ Bay§n Kawn al-#Ilm Nuqãa (Beirut,1324 A.H.), pp. 143-144.

All the sciences are therefore its par-ticularization. Existential reality (al-wujåd al-kawnÊ) is merely imagi-nation, while real existence (al-wujåd al-ÈaqÊqÊ) belongs to God alone.#AlÊ’s saying is thus, in Jaz§\"irÊ’s eyes, but another expression of thedoctrine of “the unity of being”, the axis of the sufi science.35Yet unlike #Abd al-Q§dir, AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ stresses the need toteach Sufism not only to a mystically-inclined elite, but to all be-lievers. AÈmad is no less aware of the danger for the unqualified in-herent in the teaching of waÈdat al-wujåd, and more than once in histreatise he asks that its secrets be concealed from them. At the sametime, however, he recommends the reading of sufi books on rightconduct (§d§b), as a means of refining morals (tahdhÊb al-akhl§q) andof learning how to behave before the Lord.36 This shift of emphasisfrom theosophy to the practical and moral sides of Sufism ultimate-ly reflected Jaz§\"irÊ’s acute sense of danger to religion in general, andto the sufi quest in particular, in the face of the increasing pace ofmodernization under the reign of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II. He accord-ingly attaches special importance to choosing a sufi guide on the basisof his religious correctness (istiq§ma) rather than of his miracles(kar§ma), and to the practice of seclusion (khalwa), as a means to avoidthe temptations of this world.37 Today, Jaz§\"irÊ complains, very fewtread the path to God, and even these seek Him with their tonguesrather than with their hearts. Thus, only few are the sufis who at-tain the exalted goal.38The blame for the decline of the umma is to be laid on the lead-ing men of religion of the time, the official #ulama and the false sufis.More pungent than #Abd al-Q§dir, AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s criticismagainst the #ulama is twofold. On the one hand, he censors them forintroducing innovations in traditional scholarship, thus deviating fromthe original path of the Prophet. On the other hand, he attacks theirsocial and political conduct as a betrayal of their vocation.

The danger inherent in adopting the ra-tionalist approach toward the faith, against which #Abd al-Q§dir hadalready in the 1850s so eloquently warned in the wake of his encoun-ter with the West, seemed thus to have became a reality for AÈmadunder the \\amÊdian regime of the 1880s. Legal precepts should notbe explained, he declares, for they are essentially matters of devo-tion to God, and if an explanation may occasionally be found, thisis simply a matter of convention and reflection. The true reason fora ruling is the shari#a, nothing else, and it is obligatory to fulfil itsprecepts even if we see no meaning in them at all. Reason is not ameasure for justifying religious precepts. Jaz§\"irÊ is surprised to dis-cover such a rationalist approach in the teaching of AÈmad ibnTaymiyya, thereby alluding to a renewed interest in him in Dam-ascus at the beginning of the \\amÊdian period:Strange and amazing is what I have heard from some students of ourtime, that the most erudite scholar (al-#all§ma al-muÈaqqiq), the shaykhIbn Taymiyya, may God Most Exalted have mercy upon him, wrotea book in which he tried to explain legal problems that the greatest#ulama were unable to explain, and that he found acceptable expla-nations for all of them. I thought this to be completely unlikely forhim, considering it impossible or almost impossible, since one cannotsolicit acceptable explanations for these things except through reve-lation (quwwa kashfiyya) or divine gift (malaka wahbiyya)... [Ibn Taymiyya]did not breathe the odor of the sciences of revelation and the secretsof the Divine, nor was he introduced to them. He was a pure literal-ist (í§hirÊ maÈ·) ... as his books, writings, decisions, and works testi-fy.39Turning to the social sphere, AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s critique is clearlydirected against those Damascene men of religion who had attainedhigh standing through loyalty to the Ottoman official policy ratherthan by their erudition. Among the religious students of our time,he writes, some are lacking in knowledge and understanding. Whena legal question is raised before such an #alim, he prefers to reply ina casuistic manner rather than admit his ignorance. His arroganceand eagerness to keep his false honor lead him to disregard thewarnings of the Prophet and the expected punishment of God.39 Ibid., pp. 100-103.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM238"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"local renaissance under the centralizing regimes239Against them Jaz§\"irÊ poses the ideal #ulama. These scrutinize eachproblem before delivering an answer, and control themselves byshunning the property of others, avoiding boasting in their learn-ing, and setting an example in the fulfillment of the commandments.40AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s criticism against the conduct of the “false sufis”is more direct and sharp, and his comments show that little haschanged in the nature of popular religion in Damascus since the timeof Ibn #$bidÊn at the beginning of the century. Most sufis who claimto be guides in our day, Jaz§\"irÊ writes, are ignorant, neglect the questof God, and concentrate on miracles or on the imaginary forms thatappear in their dreams. Others concern themselves with the deliciousfood and drink served at social events, contenting themselves sim-ply with the recitation of the sayings they learned by heart from theirmasters. It is rare to find among them one who dedicates his timeto spiritual training, to the divine sciences and secrets, to the purifi-cation of the impure soul, or to following the Prophet’s path. Yetothers make empty and misleading utterances to give the impres-sion of having attained the high mystical degrees and states of thegreat masters, concerning which they have no knowledge. The sup-port which such manifestations had received under the Islamic pol-icy of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II caused Jaz§\"irÊ to declare desperatelythat the sufi path was lost. Woe to the people who have turned plainreligion into idolatry for the sake of this world, he exclaims, and yetstill regard themselves as the elect. They imitate the masters exter-nally and imagine that this is the way to attain their desires. All theywant is to seize the people’s money and eat their food. They pre-tend to be ascetics, yet they are nothing but disguised wolves.41This consideration of the faults of the official #ulama and the falsesufis ultimately leads AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ to the traditional reformistclaim that the remedy for the decline of the umma lies in the returnof its men of religion to genuine scholarship. Expanding upon thehigh value ascribed to knowledge by the Qur\"an and the sunna, whichfor him however includes the worldly sciences, Jaz§\"irÊ then oppos-es it to the tendency apparent among his contemporaries to shunreligion. Even more revealing is the religious hierarchy he adopts,which suggests the remedy he would prescribe for this shunning.

After them he puts first the muÈaddithån and only thenthe fuqah§\". This hierarchy constitutes thus another expression of theemerging tendency among the reformist #ulama of the early \\amÊdianperiod to reformulate jurisprudence on the basis of the sunna. Thelast point that separated Jaz§\"irÊ from the SalafÊs at this stage wasthat for him h§dÊth and fiqh were still included within the sufi frame-work, hence his ambivalent appreciation of Ibn Taymiyya’s legacy.On the other hand, he defines Sufism as following the path of thesalaf, which was nothing but complete obedience to the shari#a anddiverting one’s attention from the created to the Creator. From thebasically AkbarÊ assertion that every Qur\"anic verse has infinitemeanings, Jaz§\"irÊ further deduces the basically \\anbalÊ conclusionthat their understanding should be referred to God. Thus did therighteous forefathers (al-salaf al-ß§liÈ), who preferred to endure anyaffliction rather than discuss the meanings of the Qur\"an. All theywere prepared to say was that this is the word of God, with whichone must comply. Later on the forefathers’ example was followedby AÈmad ibn \\anbal in his struggle against the rationalist trendof his day, the Mu#tazila.42AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ could not acquire the prestige and influentialposition that #Abd al-Q§dir had held in Damascus in the previousgeneration. Nevertheless, he did become a prominent leader of theAlgerian community in the city, and of the local—reformist tendencyin general. Like his brother, AÈmad served as an arbitrator in con-flicts between members of the community, as well as giving religiouslessons to the public in the #Ann§ba mosque and to elect disciplesin his home. He also continued the family tradition in conductingthe dhikr ceremony of the Q§dirÊ order. On the other hand, Jaz§\"irÊtoo distanced himself from the company of the Ottoman—orthodox#ulama who largely dominated religious life in Damascus under thepatronage of #AbdülÈamÊd II. Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ, who first methim a year after he published his treatise and soon became his closeassociate, stresses his inclination to hadith, as well as his frequentexertion of ijtihad when debating adversaries. He adds that Jaz§\"irÊbased his teaching on the Qur\"an and the sunna, and that in the legalopinions he issued he used to bring proofs from rare books. He alsohad a special sensitivity for the Arabic language, and possessed42 Ibid., pp. 113-116, 122-128.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM240"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"local renaissance under the centralizing regimes241considerable knowledge of the geography and history of North Af-rica. Above all, until the end of his life AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ remaineda faithful admirer of his brother, #Abd al-Q§dir.43The position of MuÈammad al-Mub§rak the younger, the otherprominent leader of the Algerian community in Damascus duringthe \\amÊdian period, was based primarily on administering his schooland heading the Sh§dhiliyya–F§siyya order in the city.44 Mub§rakadhered to the traditional methods of teaching, but was not averseto the non-religious sciences.45 He specialized in Arabic grammarand literature, though his works were written in the customaryrhymed prose (saj#). His linguistic proficiency was modeled on theclassical grammarians on the separate terms of the language, find-ing it difficult to weave it into a unified framework. Nonetheless, afterjoining the Arabic lessons of •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, Mub§rak began tocollect and edit rare manuscripts, teaching some rediscovered liter-ary works. He even did not hesitate to associate with MuÈammadKurd #AlÊ, who studied with him before becoming a distinguisheddisciple of •§hir, to whom many of the conservative #ulama werehostile.46 It was to Kurd #AlÊ that Mub§rak once admitted the es-sential tension between the two axes of his life: “You are fortunatebecause you freed yourself from the rhymed prose”, he told him,“while I remained shackled in its fetters and could not free myself.”The same tension is discernible in Mub§rak’s sufi path. In the tra-dition of his fathers he healed epileptics and distributed amulets towomen who sought his help, but he himself did not believe in theirefficacy. To his disciples Mub§rak taught the classical sufi exposi-tions, primarily Ibn #ArabÊ’s Al-FutåÈ§t al-Makkiyya; yet his empha-sis, like that of AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ, was on the moral aspect of Sufism,and he assailed the idleness and vanity that had become associatedwith it. Mub§rak’s Sufism, as his mostly SalafÊ biographers stress,was tempered by the spirit of the sunna and combined with adab.47MuÈammad al-Mub§rak ordained two deputies in the Sh§dhi-43 Q§simÊ, Ta#ãÊr al-Mash§mm, pp. 67-71; BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 304-305.44 See p. 199.45 On Mub§rak’s school see FakhrÊ al-BarådÊ, Mudhakkir§t al-BarådÊ (2 vols.

Spe-cializing in grammar, he showed a particular interest in pre-IslamicArabic poetry, as well as in unusual phenomena of the language. Likehis father, #Abd al-Q§dir opened a private school, in the #Am§raquarter, in 1905. Five years later he was appointed teacher of gram-mar in the first secondary school in Damascus, Maktab #Anbar.50These heirs of MuÈammad al-Mub§rak in the sufi tradition that hisfamily brought with it from the Kabylia, and in the contemporarycultural regeneration in which he had taken part, helped to preservethe vitality of the Algerian community of the city also in the nextgeneration under the French Mandate.The Withdrawal of the Local—Reformist TendencySalÊm al-#Aãã§r and MaÈmåd \\amza continued to lead the localtendency in Damascus throughout most of the first decade after theestablishment of #AbdülÈamÊd II’s rule. Yet their religious positionwas increasingly eroded as the grip on the city of men of religionharnessed to the \\amÊdian policy tightened. At the same time, theirfamilies were allowed to enhance their socio-economic interests, andthus were integrated into the landowning—bureaucratic elite of thecity. The weakening of the local tendency in Damascus was parti-cularly apparent in the case of MaÈmåd \\amza, who as holder ofthe official post of \\anafÊ mufti was more dependent on the Otto-48 On #Abd al-B§qÊ al-Jaz§\"irÊ see \\§fií and Ab§ía, p. 346; for a diploma hegave in 1915 see #AzåzÊ, pp. 163-165.49 On MuÈammad SharÊf al-Ya#qåbÊ see \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp. 579-585.50 Ibid., pp. 605-608.

Possibly disap-pointed with the limitations imposed by the council on the activi-ties of the educational societies that were formed in the city in theprevious years,51 this step nonetheless expressed a broader displeasurewith the policies of #AbdülÈamÊd. \\amza’s position in Damascus wastoo strong, however, for the Ottoman government to dismiss him.Until the end of his life the notables of the city assembled weekly inhis house, and the decisions of the provincial council, of which hewas ex officio a member, continued to be sent to him for approval.52As we have seen, only after \\amza’s death in 1887 was the post of\\anafÊ mufti of Damascus transferred to one of the #ulama willingto serve #AbdülÈamÊd II’s ends, MuÈammad al-ManÊnÊ.As the holder of the highest official religious post in Damascus,MaÈmåd \\amza could not fully articulate the changes in his thought,and in that of many other local tendency #ulama in the city, inopposition to the Islamic policy of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II. The ar-ticulation of these ideas was thus left to one of the leading figures ofthis tendency who held a lesser position in the Ottoman administra-tion, MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ.53 They are clearly discernible in two ofShaããÊ’s treatises which were written at the early 1880s though pu-blished only posthumously, both basically collections of rulings ofpast authorities, the first of Da\"åd ibn Khalaf, the founder of theextinct £§hirÊ school, and the second of the great \\anbalÊ jurist andtheologian, AÈmad ibn Taymiyya. The analysis of these two treati-ses will sum up the views that the #ulama of the local tendency inDamascus came to adopt in the course of the nineteenth century,and point the way to the beginnings of the Salafiyya toward its end.Da\"åd ibn Khalaf’s collection of rulings, gathered by MuÈammadal-ShaããÊ from the \\anbalÊ law books, reflects the tendency thatbecame apparent among the “local” #ulama of the Tanzimat periodto seek new legal methods to deal with the problems raised by thechanging circumstances of their time. In his introduction, ShaããÊstrives to demonstrate that it is by no means obligatory to refer solelyto the four established schools.

Morethan forty of these men were, according to ShaããÊ, respected enoughto have had their rulings compiled in books and to have acquiredimitators. The numerous schools they founded vanished only in thewake of the havoc brought by the Mongol invasion, so that underMamluk rule it was decided to refer only to the four that survived.Though ShaããÊ expresses the hope to gather the rulings of all theschools, it is highly significant that he actually collected only thoseof the £§hiriyya, which in its adherence to the literal meaning ofthe scriptures resembled both his own \\anbalÊ school and Ibn #ArabÊ’sjurisprudence. ShaããÊ’s declared aim in this treatise, and in the en-tire project, was twofold. On the one hand, he wanted to enableconcessions in religious observance (taysÊr al-#ib§d§t) when the needarose, on the other hand, he sought to ensure that the state laws (al-maw§dd al-nií§miyya) would remain within the bounds of the shari#a.In the first book ShaããÊ concentrated on the former object by enu-merating the various rulings of Da\"åd ibn Khalaf, arguing for anexpansion of the rules among which the shari#a allows one to choose.In the second book he turned to the even more essential task ofredefining the shar#Ê foundation of state legislation.54The state laws ShaããÊ referred to in his Introduction to the Com-patibility of the Nií§mÊ laws and the SharÊ#a Precepts were thoseenacted or codified in the Ottoman Empire since the inaugurationof the era of reform. Apart from justifying modernization, however,the treatise implicitly criticizes the policies of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊdII by raising in unprecedented clarity the question of the relations-hip between religion and state in Islam. Not incidentally, this is alsoone of the first instances of a special interest among the #ulama ofDamascus in the writings of AÈmad ibn Taymiyya. MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ justifies his reliance on him by arguing that not only were theremany mujtahids in the first three centuries of Islam, but #ulama whosatisfied the conditions for exerting it continued to appear also afterthe crystallization of the schools. Those conditions are the knowle-dge to derive rulings from the Qur\"an, the sunna, and by qiy§s (ana-logy), though significantly not by ijm§# (consensus).5554 Ibid., pp. 2-5.55 MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ, Muqaddimat TawfÊq al-Maw§dd al-Nií§miyya li-AÈk§m al-SharÊ#a al-MuÈammadiyya (Cairo, n.d.), pp. 3-6.

His main novelty lies in the new concepts he applies testi-fying to the new discourse that had become established in Damas-cus by the \\amÊdian period. The honor of men lies in the knowle-dge and perception that God has granted them, ShaããÊ writes, butin their sustenance they must cooperate with one another in orderto satisfy their needs. Civilization and society (al-tamaddun wal-ijtim§#)are predicated upon such cooperation, and for that purpose God sentHis messengers with His books. These clarify the permitted and theforbidden, in harmony with the laws of justice, the interests of men,and the circumstances of the time, thus bestowing perfect order onsociety (nií§m al-hay\"a al-ijtim§#iyya). For both the execution of God’swill and the smooth cooperation of men, it is essential to have po-litical leadership. The dual existence of religious and state laws, ShaããÊexplains rather vaguely in the pressure that some #ulama exerted onthe rulers in the past. Yet he emphasizes that there are no groundsfor the impression that the two are mutually contradictory; all statelaws in Islam are derived from the teachings of MuÈammad. Thusin his final conclusion MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ proves to be diametri-cally opposed to the quietist teaching of #Abd al-Q§dir, since for himthe separation of government from religion, or of religion from go-vernment, is the principal cause for the decay of society.56Moreover, the primary theme in the rulings ShaããÊ chose to in-clude in this collection is the duties of the ruler and his officials towardtheir subjects, based upon the fundamental obligation to govern injustice. Already at the beginning of the work he gives voice to thedesire of the #ulama of the local tendency in Damascus to participa-te in shaping the administration of Syria. “It is appropriate for thosewho have attained leadership”, MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ writes, “to takecounselors (ahl mashwara) from among the legal experts and the vir-tuous, to ask their opinion in every matter, particularly concerningthe complex events that take place among the local population, orwhen customs and manners vary between the countries, and to actthe Gate of Ijtihad Closed?” IJMES, 16 (1984), pp. 3-41; “On the Origins of theControversy about the Existence of Mujtahids and the Gate of Ijtihad,” SI, 63(1984), pp. 129-141; and his comprehensive analysis in idem, A History of Islamic LegalTheories: An Introduction to SunnÊ Ußål al-Fiqh (Cambridge, 1997).56 Ibid., pp. 6-15.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM245"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"chapter seven246upon the counsel of these #ulama.” ShaããÊ further asserts that the rulersmust act in accordance with the general welfare (maßlaÈa), since it istheir duty to protect their subjects’ honor, life, and property.57Another obligation he emphasizes in reflection of the Syrian reali-ties of his time is the protection of minorities. The imam should fightfor ahl al-dhimma as he fights for Muslims and, moreover, he mustnot enslave them even if they break their contract. He should alsonot impose upon them a burden which they are unable to bear.Underlying all these duties is that of employing the most competentin government offices, which points to the main critique of ShaããÊ,and the #ulama he represented, against the autocratic regime of Sultan#AbdülÈamÊd II. The reason for the ruin and break up of the coun-try lay, in his opinion, in the habit of granting posts to the ignorantand neglecting appropriate reward and punishment.58Most significantly, the other major theme which MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ included in this collection of rulings pertains to landholding.Classifying the Syrian territories as khar§j lands, on which annual taxis due, ShaããÊ defines the mutual rights of the government and thetenants over them in a way that would enhance production. Thuswhile the first is entitled to collect the khar§j even if the land was notcultivated, the latter may bequeath or sell their rights to it withoutinterference. Moreover, maintaining that local custom in Syria fol-lows the \\anbalÊ principles, which allow the purchase of facilities(man§fi#) separately from the land itself, ShaããÊ also establishes thelegitimacy of private property (aml§k). These constitute for him theprincipal means for developing waqf lands, which otherwise mighthave fallen into ruin. The most important distinction made by ShaããÊon the basis of the \\anbalÊ law, however, is between irrigated (mus-hajjara) and rain-fed (sal§\"ikh) lands. It had long been established inDamascus that the first category, which refers primarily to the gar-dens and orchards of the Ghåãa oasis, was subject to sale and rent.The main novelty of ShaããÊ was that also in the case of the lattercategory, which refers to remoter lands, the same property rightscould be attained by the mere act of ploughing the land. For the#ulama of the local tendency in Damascus, this was the religious basisfor the exploitation of the grain producing area of the \\awr§n, towhich their economic interests were since the 1840s attached.5957 Ibid., pp. 15-16.58 Ibid., pp. 19, 26, 37, 50-51.59 Ibid., pp. 72-84.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM246"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"local renaissance under the centralizing regimes247MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ regarded this Introduction, like the collec-tion of Da\"åd al-£§hirÊ’s rulings, as part of a larger project to exa-mine all of the precepts of the shari#a “in the works of Qur\"an exe-gesis, hadith commentaries, and the rulings of the mujtahids in thebooks of jurisprudence, particularly those of shaykh al-Isl§m AÈmadibn Taymiyya.” Yet despite his expansion of the range of usable legalsources, and his heavy reliance on Ibn Taymiyya, ShaããÊ sought notto authorize ijtihad, but rather to preserve the opposite principle oftaqlÊd. It is permissible to imitate any reliable imam, he maintains,as indeed has been done in certain cases with Da\"åd al-£§hirÊ, Ibn\\azm, and Ibn Taymiyya, “especially because of changing times anddeteriorating conditions, since if there is a ruling of an #alim on theproblem, it is better [to imitate him] than to do without taqlÊd.”60This clinging to blind imitation was the only feature that separatedShaããÊ from the SalafÊ trend. Nonetheless, the first stirrings of thelatter’s ideas are already discernible in the tripartite division ShaããÊuses to define the concept of the shari#a. Its first meaning refers towhat is firmly established by the Qur\"an and the sunna, that whichmust be obeyed unreservedly. The second includes the rulings arri-ved at by the #ulama through ijtihad. In this case, it is lawful to followany one of them. The third sense covers all false hadiths, incorrectinterpretations, and misleading innovations that had been insertedinto the shari#a. ShaããÊ does not specify how these last should betreated, but his intention is clearly to sift them out. This is corrobo-rated by the tripartite division he makes in the concept of the ÈaqÊqa.It comprises the existential truths (kawniyya) in which it is obligatoryto believe, the legal truths (shar#iyya) that must be obeyed, and theinnovative truths (bid#iyya) that must be rejected. By defining the latteras treading the path of God without adhering to the scriptures, ShaããÊmakes it clear that along with the increasing interest in Ibn Taymiyyahe, and the other local tendency #ulama in Damascus, remainedfaithful to the orthodox sufi legacy of Shaykh Kh§lid and #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ even after the inauguration of the \\amÊdianregime.61On the other hand, the new ideas found in MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ’streatises help to explain the breach which developed between #Abdal-Q§dir and MaÈmåd \\amza in the course of the 1870s.

This ancient sundial had be-gun to lag and, when MuÈammad al-•anã§wÊ tried to fix it, brokeinto two pieces. •anã§wÊ built a new, more precise, sundial, but manyin Damascus were still angry with him. Their feeling was expressedin a contemptuous poem composed by #Abd al-Sal§m al-ShaããÊ (1840-1878), a popular poet and a member of a different branch of theShaããÊ family.62 #Abd al-Q§dir sided with •anã§wÊ and humiliatedShaããÊ in front of some of the leading #ulama. \\amza, who was amongthose present, rebuked him for his interference and severed contactwith him. He remained reserved even after the amir repented andtried to appease ShaããÊ with money, and shunned him for the restof his life.63 \\amza’s attack on #Abd al-Q§dir in this affair reflecteda difference in their views that arose during the decline of the lateTanzimat. \\amza’s concept of ijtihad, as represented by ShaããÊ’streatises, remained much more limited than #Abd al-Q§dir’s, but inapplying it to the political sphere he had clearly departed from thequietist approach preached by the amir in the Maw§qif. In the newcircumstances prevailing in the Ottoman Empire after Sultan #Ab-dülazÊz turned against the late Tanzimat statesmen in 1871, andespecially when #AbdülÈamÊd II’s Islamic policy began to be fullyimplemented in Damascus after 1880, \\amza, and other #ulama ofthe local tendency, felt that such attitude was no longer adequate.Under the \\amÊdian regime some of them accordingly shifted theemphasis in their religious reform from the Sufism of Ibn #ArabÊ tothe jurisprudence and theology of Ibn Taymiyya. #Abd al-Q§dir him-self, the great interpreter of the AkbarÊ teaching in Damascus, nat-urally could not follow such a course. In his last years he even cor-responded with the main instrument of the Sultan’s Islamicpropaganda in Syria, Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ.64SalÊm al-#Aãã§r, the other leading man of religion of the local ten-dency in late Tanzimat Damascus, was better able than MaÈmåd\\amza to maintain his position under the reign of #AbdülÈamÊd II.62 On #Abd al-Sal§m al-ShaããÊ see ShaããÊ, Raw· al-Bashar, pp. 146-148; #Abd al-Sal§m al-ShaããÊ, DÊw§n ([Damascus], 1324 A.H.), pp. 2-4; Mardam, pp. 58-60.63 On this event, which stirred up Damascus, see \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp. 74-76;ShaããÊ, A#y§n Dimashq, pp. 25-27; Idem, •abaq§t al-\\an§bila, pp. 162-164; BÊã§r, \\ilyatal-Bashar, p. 1286; \\ißnÊ, pp. 764-765; Badr§n, Mun§damat al-Aãl§l, p. 365.64 Jaz§\"irÊ, TuÈfat al-Z§\"ir, pp. 27-28.

More-over, after SalÊm’s death in 1889, the Ottoman government tried tointerfere also in this appointment and transfer it to members of thefamily more receptive to its policies, though finally it was forced toentrust the post to the deceased’s younger uncle, BakrÊ al-#Aãã§r. Acomparison between the paths of these two consecutive heads of the#Aãã§r family exemplifies the integration of the local—reformist #ul-ama families into the emerging landowning—bureaucratic elite ofDamascus during the \\amÊdian period.BakrÊ al-#Aãã§r (1834-1903) began his studies with his father, \\§midal-#Aãã§r, and #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-KuzbarÊ, the two luminaries of theirage. His principal teachers thereafter were SalÊm al-#Aãã§r in hadith,#Abd al-RaÈm§n Bay§zÊd in grammar,66 and Abå Bakr al-Kil§lÊ inlogic. BakrÊ’s first position, undoubtedly during the late Tanzimatperiod, was the instruction of hadith and Qur\"an exegesis in theUmayyad mosque, in addition to lessons he gave in his home. Thenumber of his disciples increased considerably during the \\amÊdi-an period, following the introduction of the exemption from mili-tary service for religious students. After the death of SalÊm, BakrÊconsidered himself the most worthy to succeed him as the hadithinstructor in the Sulaym§niyya lodge. The Ottoman authorities,however, gave precedence to SalÊm’s two sons, and only when itbecame evident that both were unqualified did they agree to nom-inate him on their behalf. BakrÊ al-#Aãã§r’s lessons too attracted manyof the #ulama, notables and merchants of Damascus. Nevertheless,in his teaching method he proved more faithful to the traditional styleof instruction, relying above all on his excellent memory. He im-pressed his disciples by having memorized the books he taught andwith his lucid explanations, but he refrained from critically examin-ing the judgments of the various legal schools or from consideringsufi thought, and completely avoided discussing current events. Onthe other hand, Bakri combined the science of hadith, which familytradition made the center of his teaching, with the two fields whichmost attracted him, like the other #ulama of the local—reformist65 \\§fií and Ab§ía, p. 149.66 #Abd al-RaÈm§n Bay§zÊd is referred to as the greatest grammarian of his time.On him see ShaããÊ, Raw· al-Bashar, p. 144; Qud§ma, p. 157.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM249"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"chapter seven250tendency, Arabic language and logic.Like SalÊm, BakrÊ al-#Aãã§r also harbored an evident inclinationtoward Sufism, though his emphasis, again in line with the #ulamaof the local—reformist tendency, was on its practical and moralrespects. He took the Q§dirÊ path in 1846, at the age of twelve, fromMuÈammad #AlÊ al-Kayl§nÊ of Hamah, the shaykh who subsequentlyordained AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ. Until the end of his life, #Aãã§r wouldperform the dhikr in his home with a small group of mystics, and hewas always mindful to wear the Q§dirÊ headgear as a token of loy-alty to his shaykh. Inclined to asceticism, he also performed nightvigils, distributed alms lavishly, and associated with the poor. Yethe showed no interest in the intricacies of the AkbarÊ teaching whichso occupied his predecessor. On the other hand, #Aãã§r did not avoidthe company of notables and government officials, to whom he of-ten applied on behalf of those asking for his intercession. The au-thorities’ esteem for him increased over the years, until toward theend of his life the qadi would pay him great respect by having himprecede himself during official ceremonies. This position of inter-mediary between the government and the people, a traditional rolefor the religious men in the city, allowed #Aãã§r, as we will see, tolend his support to the emerging SalafÊs of Damascus against theirorthodox persecutors. Their sense of loss at BakrÊ al-#Aãã§r’s deathwas given poignant expression by MuÈammad JamÊl al-ShaããÊ, whoconcluded his biography with the assertion that he was the last ofhis generation accomplished in erudition, piety and teaching, andthat no one was able to take his place.67Aligning with the Sultan’s ServantsThe members of the reformist #ulama families of Damascus who wereprepared to accommodate themselves to the Islamic policy of Sul-tan #AbdülÈamÊd II did so by returning to a conventional interpre-tation of Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching. Their inspiration came from sufishaykhs who lived outside Damascus, particularly #AlÊ Når al-DÊnal-YashruãÊ in Acre and MuÈammad al-Dandar§wÊ in the Hijaz.

The principal difference between the two ordersderived from the timing of their spread to Damascus. Thus while inthe Yashruãiyya, which had become active there already in the ear-ly Tanzimat period, socio-economic dissatisfaction tended to degen-erate into sheer antinomianism, in the Dandar§wiyya, which ap-peared during the \\amÊdian period itself, it sometimes consolidatedinto radical conservatism. It was among these Dandar§wÊ deputiesthat one of the most acrimonious attacks on the original Salafiyyaof Damascus was formulated.An early manifestation of the tendency to return to the tradition-al interpretation of Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching appeared in the #Aãã§r fam-ily. Like other members of his family, #Umar al-#Aãã§r (1826-1891)studied with the leading reformist #ulama of his time, including hisuncle, \\§mid al-#Aãã§r, \\asan al-ShaããÊ, Q§sim al-\\all§q, and AbåBakr al-KÊl§lÊ, with whom he specialized in logic and the Arabiclanguage. When the itinerant #alim Akram al-Afgh§nÊ (d. 1899) vis-ited Damascus for a short period, however, #Umar became attachedto him, and under his guidance immersed himself in sufi studies. Hethen accompanied Afgh§nÊ to Egypt, visiting it thereafter often. #Aãã§rwas a prolific writer who engaged mainly in the AkbarÊ teaching.68His major treatise is a defense of Ibn #ArabÊ, composed at the be-ginning of the \\amÊdian period. Apart from explaining the doctrineof “the unity of being” and the legal teachings of Ibn #ArabÊ, heconveys in this book a sense of concern about the position of Sufismin the modern world. Many did not understand the sufi utterancesin the past, #Aãã§r writes, but the situation has become particularlygrave today, when the number of #ulama is decreasing while inno-vations and passions are widespread. He singles out for his attackthe concept of progress, which according to him has no foundationin the Qur\"an and the sunna, and which both reason and percep-tion reject. Relying particularly on the Prophet’s saying that, “thebest century is my century, then the following...”, #Aãã§r could con-clude that the ancestors (salaf) are always superior to the successors(khalaf).6968 \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp. 102-103; ZiriklÊ, vol. 5, p. 207; MunÊr al-DimashqÊ, p.441.69 #Umar Al-#Aãã§r, Al-FatÈ al-MubÊn fÊ Radd I#tir§· al-Mu#tari· #al§ MuÈyÊ al-DÊn(Cairo, 1304 A.H.), esp. p. 67.

Shortly after #AbdülÈamÊd II’s accession, he was sentto Istanbul by #AlÊ Når al-DÊn al-YashruãÊ, where he managed toenroll in the order #AlÊ Ri·§ Pasha, the first secretary of the palace,and after him other senior administrators and notables of the cap-ital. Through #AlÊ Ri·§ the name of the Yashruãiyya reached the earsof the Sultan, who endowed Abå al-Sh§m§t with the Balãajiyya lodgeand a lavish monthly allowance.70 Abå al-Sh§m§t frequently visitedIstanbul during the \\amÊdian period and served as YashruãÊ’s linkto the Ottoman court. The regime’s support helped him to furtherspread the order in Damascus, and the number of his disciples in-creased enormously, compelling him to divide them among threecenters, in the old city, in the Mayd§n, and in the ‘§liÈiyya quar-ter. Abå al-Sh§m§t remained popular during the Young Turk era,when multitudes attended his dhikr.71 He also corresponded with#AbdülÈamÊd II after his exile to Salonika, when the ex-Sultan senthim the famous letter in which he claimed that the Young Turkshad overthrown him because of his adamant refusal to let the Jewsestablish a national home in Palestine.72 However, despite his con-tacts with high officials in Istanbul, and certainly also with Abå al-Hud§ al-‘ayy§dÊ and MuÈammad £§fir al-MadanÊ, the heads of thesufi establishment in the capital, Abå al-Sh§m§t kept his affinity forthe reformist #ulama of Damascus.

His works,both in prose and poetry, were all concerned with sufi teachings andpractices and showed his fervent adherence to Ibn #ArabÊ. This isclearly evident in his commentary on the Sh§dhilÊ prayer, composedin 1883. Abå al-Sh§m§t’s elucidation of the doctrine of waÈdat al-wujåd, like that of AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ writing at about the same time,revolves around the Reality of MuÈammad. Prayer, he claims, is aplea to God to glorify the Prophet in this world by commemoratinghis name, granting victory to his religion, and preserving his shari#a,as well as in the hereafter by rewarding those who believe in himand interceding in favor of his umma. The prayer of God for MuÈam-mad mentioned in the Qur\"an is, accordingly, His mercy for theworld, of which the Prophet is the source (#ayn al-raÈma). The MuÈam-madan Reality is also the source of all truth, upon which the exist-ence of the world depends. It may be attained solely by those whofollow the Prophet’s path; for others it is concealed behind the veilof their beliefs and rites.75 This emphasis on MuÈammad’s role asan intermediary (w§siãa) determines Abå al-Sh§m§t’s practical viewof the sufi path. Again as was the case with AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ, itstwo pillars are the perfect guide and the shari#a. The traveler on thepath may see God only through the mirror of the Prophet, a veil oflight which prevents the burning of the creatures’ perception. Yet,all the visions and spiritual states that lead to it, he can see onlythrough the mirror of his own shaykh. On the other hand, Abå al-Sh§m§t never tires of reminding his readers that attaining the di-vine Truth, and its realization in the Prophet, depends upon strictadherence to the shari#a. MuÈammad guides the perplexed with thelights of the Law, and any other way one takes to reach God willlead him to destruction.76Similarities in the fundamental principles stressed by AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ and by MaÈmåd Abå al-Sh§m§t in their AkbarÊ interpreta-tions stemmed from a shared desire to defend Sufism against itsdetractors. The two differed, however, in their understanding of thelessons to be drawn from these principles. While Jaz§\"irÊ, like #Umaral-#Aãã§r, regards the main danger to be the emerging tendency in75 MaÈmåd Abå al-Sh§m§t, Al-Ilh§m§t al-Il§hiyya #al§ al-WaíÊfa al-Sh§dhiliyya(Damascus, 1356/1937), pp. 12-16.76 Ibid., pp. 20-22, 26-28.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM253"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"chapter seven254their day to shun Islam, Abå al-Sh§m§t still formulates his polem-ics within the framework of the traditional Muslim controversybetween sufis and their opponents. He asserts that Sufism is the mostdistinguished science and defines it as the comprehensive wisdom andbeneficial knowledge capable of granting perpetual happiness.Though Abå al-Sh§m§t discusses at length the various charges madeagainst sufis, this is only as a means of immunization against them,and he accordingly quotes past authorities who had regarded thesedenunciations as a grace of God to purify their souls. Opponentsattack Sufism simply out of ignorance, bigotry, and blindness, all ofwhich prevent them from sharing in the divine bounty.77 This tra-ditional point of view leads Abå al-Sh§m§t to stress the metaphys-ical position of the Prophet, and the duty to love him and concen-trate on him in the dhikr, rather than as a moral example. Referringto the perfect guide, he emphasizes the obligation to remain faith-ful to him even after reaching the goal, while avoiding mentioningany difficulty in finding him. Even when the image of MuÈammadreplaces that of the shaykh in the disciple’s vision, his soul will be-hold the divine truth together with the shaykh and his link to himwill not be broken.78 What AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ and MaÈmåd Abå al-Sh§m§t agreed upon was thus ultimately limited to the obligationto follow the shari#a, showing only that both operated within thebounds of orthodox Sufism.In the biography of another Damascene deputy of the Yashruãiyyaorder, Sa#Êd al-Ghabr§ (d. 1886) a hint of a more hostile attitudetoward the reformist tendency becomes discernible. A nephew anddisciple of #Abd al-RaÈm§n al-KuzbarÊ, Ghabr§ became a KhalwatÊadept in his youth, and later conducted the order’s dhikr in the Jaq-maqiyya college in the #Am§ra quarter. He is depicted in our sourcesalternately as a staunch fighter against innovations and as a sufishaykh whose success detracted him to worldly affairs.79 The latterdevelopment may have taken place after he received the order from#AlÊ al-YashruãÊ. It is related by F§ãima al-Yashruãiyya, in a ratherdramatic fashion, how Ghabr§ had sharply criticized the adherentsof the ãarÊqa in Damascus, and how for this reason he set out for Acreto encounter her father. Upon seeing the shaykh, however, he be-came enraptured, and because of this experience decided to tread77 Ibid., pp. 2-5, 57-62.78 Ibid., pp. 21-22, 28-29.79 \\ißnÊ, p. 721; BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, p. 651.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM254"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"local renaissance under the centralizing regimes255the path under his guidance. Ghabr§ then eventually became oneof the outstanding propagators of the Yashruãiyya in the city.80 Hedistinguished himself most of all during the \\amÊdian period by hisefforts to stop the activities of the founder of the Syrian theater, Abåal-KhalÊl al-Qabb§nÊ, with whom the reformists sympathized. Ghabr§traveled to Istanbul several times for this purpose, until he obtainedan imperial decree ordering the theater to be closed, thus compel-ling Qabb§nÊ to leave for Egypt.81The Dandar§wiyya order is named after MuÈammad ibn AÈmadal-Dandar§wÊ (1839-1910), a deputy of Ibr§hÊm al-RashÊd, whohimself was one of the prominent disciples of AÈmad ibn IdrÊs andlater a part of the sufi reformist circle active in Mecca during the1860s. Very little is known with certainty about Dandar§wÊ, not evenwhether he clearly broke with the RashÊdiyya. A native of UpperEgypt, he seems to have spread his order principally in Somalia andto have been in Sudan during the period of the Mahdi.82 The biog-raphies of the Damascene #ulama who were associated with himindicate that toward the end of the 1880s Dandar§wÊ too arrived inMecca, where he ordained some of them as deputies or adherentsof the order. Encouraged by his success, Dandar§wÊ paid a numberof visits to Damascus during the 1890s, where he was able to drawa following principally in the small towns and villages of the area.Like #AlÊ al-YashruãÊ, some of whose followers he now attracted,Dandar§wÊ also established connections with the Ottoman admin-istration and probably was received by Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd himselfwhile on a visit to Istanbul.83Among the Damascene #ulama who became affiliated with theDandar§wiyya, the most striking example is that of MuÈammad Bah§\"al-DÊn al-BÊã§r, the nephew and son-in-law of #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r,though the circumstances are not clear. Bah§\" al-DÊn (1848-1910)followed the regular course among the #ulama of his family. He stud-ied with his father, #Abd al-GhanÊ, and with his uncles MuÈammadand #Abd al-Razz§q, as well as with MuÈammad al-•anã§wÊ.

Apart from Sufism he alsoexcelled in literature.84 The later parts of Bah§\" al-DÊn’s life areobscure. His son, MuÈammad Bahjat al-BÊã§r, the SalafÊ editor of\\ilyat al-Bashar, avoids mentioning his father’s adherence to theDandar§wiyya, offering only the anecdote that upon turning toSufism his father sold his considerable property and spent the pro-ceeds on the poor, thus earning the nickname of abå al-fuqar§\".85According to F§ãima al-Yashruãiyya, he was one of the disciples ofher father, evidently before joining the Dandar§wiyya.86 Bah§\" al-DÊn was a prolific author, primarily of commentaries on the worksof Ibn #ArabÊ and his school. His only printed treatise is an AkbarÊexposition on the “fourteen prayers” of AÈmad ibn IdrÊs, which hecompleted in 1896. Incidentally, this is the only evidence we havefor Bah§\" al-DÊn’s connection with Dandar§wÊ. It seems that it wasthe shaykh who asked him to compose this commentary in recogni-tion of his proficiency in al-Shaykh al-Akbar’s teaching, and who sawto its publication that same year in Beirut.87MuÈammad al-Dandar§wÊ’s principal deputy in Damascus, how-ever, was the \\anbalÊ Mußãaf§ al-ShaããÊ (1855-1929), the only sonof AÈmad al-ShaããÊ to be attracted to religious studies. Like Bah§\"al-DÊn al-BÊã§r, Mußãaf§ followed the family tradition in his youth,acquiring his education with his father and his uncle, MuÈammadal-ShaããÊ, as well as with SalÊm and BakrÊ al-#Aãã§r. He started preach-ing and instruction in 1877 in the B§dhura\"iyya college, which hisfamily continued to supervise, and five years later was nominatedas a clerk in the religious court. Nevertheless, unlike his three youngercousins, Mußãaf§ failed to secure for himself an official administra-tive or judicial post. His work in the court ended after a short pe-riod for unspecified reasons, a little before he was attracted to Sufismunder the inspiration of MuÈammad al-Dandar§wÊ. ShaããÊ becameacquainted with the shaykh while on a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1888,and under his influence became a sufi adept and an ardent admirerof Ibn #ArabÊ. Dandar§wÊ ordained him as his deputy in Damascus,and upon his return he began to conduct the order’s dhikr sessionsin his college. We do not know the extent of Mußãaf§’s success, but84 BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 380-400.85 Ibid., p. 381, editor’s note.86 Yashruãiyya, p. 350.87 MuÈammad Bah§\" al-DÊn al-BÊã§r, Kit§b al-NafaÈ§t al-Aqdasiyya: SharÈ al-‘alaw§tal-AÈmadiyya al-IdrÊsiyya (Beirut, 1314 A.H.), pp. 3-4.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM256"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"local renaissance under the centralizing regimes257it seems that at least among his family his new course met with littlesympathy. His position further deteriorated after his father’s deathin 1898, when he left the post he had inherited from him as super-visor of inheritance problems in the city. The hostility of the ShaããÊfamily may have convinced Dandar§wÊ in 1901 to order him to stopconducting the order’s dhikr in the B§dhura\"iyya college. A year laterMußãaf§ al-ShaããÊ published together two treatises, one being a vir-ulent attack on the Salafiyya and the other a staunch defense ofSufism. After the Young Turk Revolution he was appointed to be ateacher, and subsequently also mufti, in the town of Dåm§, wherehe spent the rest of his life.88The main propositions of Mußãaf§ al-ShaããÊ’s book were his re-jection of the possibility of exerting ijtihad in legal questions, his de-fense of popular customs that had become attached to Sufism, andhis re-presentation of the AkbarÊ teaching. ShaããÊ regards the SalafÊs’claim to be able to exert ijtihad as part of a tendency to adopt therationalist approach, which in his eyes induced them to deviate fromthe path of the shari#a. Against them, he purports to be reassertingthe traditional view of the imams who had preserved it through theages. Admitting that the experts of the four legal schools had agreedthat every generation must have its mujtahids, and that the exist-ence of such is a collective duty, ShaããÊ notes that these experts alsospecified the conditions which a man must meet in order to be rec-ognized as a mujtahid. Stressing the number and difficulty of theseconditions, he proceeds to demonstrate how hard it is to attain thislevel and, moreover, to claim that for many generations, as Islambecame pervaded by corruption, there was no one who actually metall of them. ShaããÊ is thus able to agree with latter-day legal expertswho were maintaining that ijtihad had practically come to an end,and to reject those among them who professed its continuation asbasing themselves upon unfounded assumptions. Among the latter,he counts the SalafÊs. “There is no doubt that those who profess [toexert ijtihad] in our time make a false claim, as happened in the caseof this profession on the part of a deviating group (firqa sh§dhdha)which attached itself to the \\anbalÊs of Najd...

This group, he writes, often fore-goes its claim for the possibility of ijtihad and relies solely on theworks of Ibn Taymiyya. According to ShaããÊ, that \\anbalÊ scholardeparted from the position of his school in several matters, whichpaved the way for the SalafÊs to advocate absolute ijtihad. Most ofthe judgments of Ibn Taymiyya he mentions pertain to his attackson the popular practices attached to Sufism, the ultimate reason forShaããÊ’s rejection of ijtihad. These are the prohibition on perform-ing pilgrimage to anywhere except the three mosques (in Mecca, Me-dina, and Jerusalem), and the interdiction against seeking interces-sion from the prophets and the pious (istigh§tha). Reliance on theWahh§bÊ teaching, by which ShaããÊ means again mainly its anti-sufiideas, is even more damaging in his eyes because of its practical im-plications. This can be seen in the Wahh§bÊs’ central concept of shirk,association of others to God. ShaããÊ makes a distinction between twomeanings of this concept, the great and obvious form of shirk, idol-atry, and a lesser covert one, such as immersing oneself in this worldand forgetting its Creator. Referring to a legal ruling approved byijm§# that it is forbidden to declare a Muslim an infidel (takfÊr) evenif he commits a grave offence, ShaããÊ maintains that this is certainlythe case with those who merely seek the intercession of a prophetor a saint while knowing that the real actor is the Lord. We mustnot declare a man infidel without verifying his belief, he concludes,nor spy on him in order to incriminate him. The Wahh§bÊs deviat-ed from the scriptures and from the general consensus in overlook-ing this distinction and in shedding the blood of Muslims. Similar-ly, ShaããÊ makes a distinction between two meanings of the conceptof bid#a (innovation). In its more general sense this is anything new,while its limited shar#Ê meaning is an addition or omission in religiousmatters which has no basis in the Holy Law. A shar#Ê innovationconcerns matters of belief and worship and is fundamentally wrong,he asserts, but the more general sense of innovation pertains to customand may be commendable or even obligatory.

The most obvious would be to regardthem as being none of these, since they contradict all at once.”Indeed, in his defense of popular sufi practices attacked by the SalafÊs,ShaããÊ adopts, alongside his reliance upon traditional sources, amethod of presenting the contradictions inherent in the varioussources on whom they rely. His point of reference is his own \\an-balÊ school, within the general framework of orthodoxy, and he isinclined to try to rehabilitate Ibn Taymiyya, who after all was oneof the outstanding #ulama of that school. His wrath was directed,therefore, principally at Ibn #Abd al-Wahh§b, and he often refersto the SalafÊs as the NajdÊ or the Wahh§bÊ group.The principal subjects that Mußãaf§ al-ShaããÊ treats in his defenseof Sufism against the SalafÊs are miracles (kar§m§t), particularly thebelief that the prophets and the saints are alive in their graves; theasking for their intercession and help (tawaßßul wa-istigh§tha), duringtheir life and after their death; and visits to their tombs (ziy§rat al-qubår). These are naturally interconnected, and his twofold line ofdefense is seen already in the case of the first. After producing ev-idence for the reality of miracles and for the afterlife of prophets andsaints from the four sources of the Law, ShaããÊ proceeds to claim that\\anbalÊ #ulama concur with those of the other legal schools in con-firming them. This position was basically shared by Ibn Taymiyyaand by Ibn #Abd al-Wahh§b, he suggests, though in deviation fromtheir school they only allowed one to set out for the Prophet’s tomb(shadd al-raÈl) in order to visit the mosque and pray there. The SalafÊs,too, do not deny the validity of saints’ miracles, but some of them90 Ibid., pp. 7-14.2-7.p659/19/00, 12:54 PM259"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"chapter seven260limit it to their lifetime, thus denying the value of visiting their tombsand there asking for help.91Mußãaf§ al-ShaããÊ’s second treatise was meant to illuminate theSalafÊs, who thus attacked Sufism, and to prevent others from fol-lowing their example, by explaining the doctrine of waÈdat al-wujådand by demonstrating its full compatibility with the shari#a. Like withthe case of #Umar al-#Aãã§r and MaÈmåd Abå al-Sh§m§t, ShaããÊ’spresentation follows the conventional interpretation of Ibn #ArabÊ’steaching. All genuine sufis have held this doctrine, he claims, boththe classical masters like Bisã§mÊ, Junayd and Ghaz§lÊ, and the ep-onyms of the orders such as Abå al-\\asan al-Sh§dhilÊ, Bah§\" al-DÊnNaqshband and Jal§l al-DÊn al-RåmÊ.92 In his desire to defend Sufismagainst the growing rationalist tendencies of his day, however, ShaããÊcomes closer to AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s arguments. Like him, he claimsthat though direct spiritual experience is superior, it is possible tocomprehend the sufi science by reading its expositions, on the con-dition that this is done with God’s help, or under the guidance of aqualified shaykh. Moreover, ShaããÊ promises that this science, by itsvery nature, contains no secrets and conceals no truths. Sufi authorshave written nothing that contradicts the common sense or thestraight path. Their source was simply knowledge received from God(#ilm ladunÊ), delivered through the Qur\"an and the sunna, and re-vealed to those for whom the Lord had opened their inner vision orsounded the message in their hearts.93 Belief in “the unity of being”does not contradict the shari#a; on the contrary, it is its source andheart.

At the age of six, his family moved to Mamluk Damascus, thereseeking refuge from the advancing Mongol armies. Ibn Taymiyyaacquired an extensive religious education, centered on \\anbalÊ ju-risprudence and theology, but including also the jurisprudence of theother three legal schools, as well as philosophy and mysticism. Inthe latter field, he not only immersed himself in sufi expositions,particularly those of Ibn #ArabÊ, but was also affiliated to theQ§diriyya order.2 Ibn Taymiyya went on to distinguish himself asone of the most original religious men of his day. At the same timehe proved to be an uncompromising advocate of the absolute unityof God, as well as an untiring fighter against innovations threaten-ing it. At times he was supported in his struggles by the Mamlukamirs, especially in periods of external threat when they benefitedfrom his exhortations for jihad against the infidel, but for most ofhis life Ibn Taymiyya was persecuted by the leading #ulama and sufishaykhs, who incited these rulers to act against him. He died im-prisoned in the citadel of Damascus in 1328.Like Ibn #ArabÊ, Ibn Taymiyya too authored a large number ofbooks, encompassing most of the fields studied in his time.

This extensive research allows us to form arather detailed picture of Ibn Taymiyya’s views, from which we canbetter understand in what lay his attraction for the reformist #ulamaof late Ottoman Damascus.AÈmad ibn Taymiyya’s religious fervor should be viewed againstthe background of the deep political crisis the Muslim umma wasexperiencing in the wake of the fall of the #Abb§sid Caliphate andthe unremitting Mongol threat on those lands that remained underMuslim control. He wholeheartedly supported the Mamluk rulersof Egypt, and in his political thought attempted to supply their statewith the religious legitimization they needed. He thus remained loyalto the orthodox view which stressed the necessity of using coercionfor the sake of both religion and social prosperity, as well as the dutyto obey one’s ruler, even if he is oppressive. Ibn Taymiyya deviatedfrom the traditional doctrine only in those cases where it was nec-essary to adapt it to the new political circumstances created by theactual dissolution of the Caliphate. He argued that this institute’sexistence is not necessary, that it is permissible to have several imamsat the same time, and that Islam does not require their designationby election. This reliance on power was contrasted in Ibn Taymiyya’steaching with the duty of the imams to rule in justice (#adl) and, evenmore important, in cooperation with their subjects. He emphasizedthe importance of the oath of allegiance (mub§ya#a) and of advice(naßÊÈa) as constituting reciprocal consent and contract between rul-er and ruled, reflecting their shared desire to follow the path of Godand His messenger, and designed to ensure the implementation ofthe shari#a. Ibn Taymiyya thus regarded the holding of power as anact of religious piety, and viewed rulers as deputies of God to hisCreatures, as well as their representatives before Him. Consequent-ly, he also attached great importance to the ruler’s obligation of ap-pointing the most suitable candidates for public positions and crit-ically denounced office holders who disregarded religion andattempted to exploit it for their own ends.33 Laoust, Ibn TaimÊya, pp. 278-317; Erwin I.J.

His aim was to find the middle ground(wasaã) between the various fields of study that had evolved withinthe framework of Islam, giving each one of them its proper place inthe overall teaching. Ibn Taymiyya sought to restore the fundamentalunity between theology, which relies on reason (#aql), the sciences ofhadith and jurisprudence, which derive their authority from tradi-tion (naql), and Sufism, which is based upon the quest for spiritualexperience (ir§da). In interweaving these elements into a coherentdoctrine, Ibn Taymiyya displayed remarkable openness towards viewsdeveloped within each of these sciences, as well as those of othersrejected by Sunni Islam, such as the rationalist trends of the Mu#tazilaand the philosophers, being ready to adopt truth whatever its ori-gin. His criterion for verifying the findings of each science was com-patibility with the Qur\"an and the sunna. Subject to this criterion,he relied heavily upon reason, which in his eyes would never con-tradict the shari#a, principally as a method of defending religious truthagainst its detractors.4 In Ibn Taymiyya’s view this was the path ofthe forefathers of Islam (al-salaf), the Prophet’s companions (ßaÈ§ba)and their immediate heirs (t§bi#ån), the model to be followed.In this criterion of compatibility with the Qur\"an and the sunna,and in its essentially rationalist application, ultimately lay the fail-ure of the unity that AÈmad ibn Taymiyya sought to create, as wellas the turning of the majority of contemporary #ulama against him.For Ibn Taymiyya, the call to return to the sources was designed topurify Islam of the innovations that had accrued to it through thecenturies and to reassert the essential profession of unity upon whichthe religion was based. His faithfulness to the path of the salaf, there-fore, meant not only the integration of the religious sciences but alsothe critical examination of each of them in an effort to sift out thoseelements which had been added over successive generations. Advo-cating this in the most uncompromising manner, Ibn Taymiyya wasdriven by a sense of crisis and certainly also by the nature of his ownpersonality.

In the eyes of most religious menof his time, Ibn Taymiyya’s call to approach directly the sources thuswas seen as a sharp assault on orthodoxy, as it had crystallized andsanctified during those late generations which they claimed to rep-resent.The internal contradiction inherent in the teaching of AÈmad ibnTaymiyya is clearly recognizable in his criticism of the jurisprudenceof his time. Rejecting the practice of blind imitation (taqlÊd), hemaintained that deriving legal rulings directly from the Qur\"an andthe sunna (ijtih§d) is essential for the continuing vitality of the shari#aunder changing circumstances. Alongside these two basic sources ofIslamic Law, Ibn Taymiyya left wide room for the use of analogy(qiy§s), which is based upon reason, and for consideration of the publicgood (maßlaÈa), which addresses actual conditions of life. On the otherhand, he significantly reduced the scope of the general consensus(ijm§#), which sanctifies the tradition. Nevertheless, he did remainfaithful to the \\anbalÊ school and refrained from claiming that hehimself had attained the rank of mujtahid. In his critique of therationalist theology of his day (kal§m), Ibn Taymiyya maintained,again in the spirit of \\anbalism, that God may be described onlyas He described himself in the Qur\"an or as the Prophet describedHim in the sunna. He therefore opposed the concern of this sciencewith God’s essence and attributes, stressing instead the obligation toobey Him and the Prophet. Ibn Taymiyya was particularly criticalof the dominant Ash#arÊ school, which in his opinion tended tooveremphasize the omnipotence of God at the expense of man’sfreedom of action and his responsibility for his deeds. He regardedthe idea of predestination as a great injury to the moral fabric ofIslam.5The most pungent criticism of AÈmad ibn Taymiyya on the basis5 Laoust, Ibn TaimÊya, pp. 153-178, 226-250; Rahman, pp. 111-115; JosephNorman Bell, Love Theory in Late Hanbalite Islam (Albany, 1979), pp. 46-91; Makari,pp. 33-112.

He evenadmitted that sufis may discern new meanings in the scriptures, andconsequently in the precepts of the shari#a, though they could notabrogate them. Nonetheless, despite this implicit validation of Ibn#ArabÊ’s method, Ibn Taymiyya waged an unrelenting war againsthis teaching, primarily because of its practical implications. Hevehemently rejected the doctrine of waÈdat al-wujåd, comparing it withAsh#arÊ theology and the damage it had caused to the moral orderof Islam. Ibn Taymiyya offered a tripartite critique of what he re-garded as being the AkbarÊ deviation from an authentic professionof God’s unity. First, he maintained that by endorsing the possibil-ity of identification with God (ittiÈ§d) or annihilation in Him (fan§\"),this teaching blurred the distinction between Lord and creature. Sec-ond, in the teaching about the immutable essences (a#y§n th§bita) theAkbariyya lent its support, according to Ibn Taymiyya, to a beliefin predestination, since it implies that the course of every creatureis determined by the predisposition of its potential essence. Finally,he blamed Ibn #ArabÊ’s teaching on sainthood (wal§ya) for givingstrong encouragement to the incorporation of saint worship intoIslam, based on the belief in their infallible knowledge and in theirability to perform miracles. Ibn Taymiyya was especially hostiletoward the widespread Rif§#iyya order, which used such practicesas eating glass, walking on fire, and handling snakes to demonstrateone’s sanctity. This doctrine of sainthood, in his view, also led tothe incorporation into Islam of originally foreign popular practices,above all the visiting of saints’ tombs and the seeking of help fromtheir deceased residents.6Despite the acute animosity showed by most #ulama of the Mam-luk domains toward AÈmad ibn Taymiyya, his influence upon con-6 Muhammad Umar Memon, Ibn Taymiyya’s Struggle against Popular Religion (TheHague, 1976), pp. 24-87; Rahman, p. 147; Th.

Nonetheless, followers of Ibn Taymiyya con-tinued to transmit his legacy through the centuries, both because ofits remarkable reformist thrust and as part of late \\anbalÊ jurispru-dence, thriving mainly in Damascus and Baghdad.8 In the eighteenthcentury this tendency gained a new importance in the well-knownmovement encountered more than once in this study, theWahh§biyya. Its founder, MuÈammad ibn #Abd al-Wahh§b (1703-1792), was the scion of a family of \\anbalÊ #ulama from the #Uyay-na oasis of the central Najd. His principal inspiration came fromreading the books of Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya,before travelling to the neighboring centers of learning, mainly inMedina and Basra.9 On the basis of Ibn Taymiyya’s concept of tawÈÊd,Ibn #Abd al-Wahh§b condemned the practices of most inhabitantsof the Arab Peninsula as a pre-Islamic legacy (j§hiliyya). Applying itmore broadly, he attacked almost the entire Muslim society of histime. By adopting Ibn Taymiyya’s concept of adherence to the pathof the salaf, Ibn #Abd al-Wahh§b was able to reject the innovationsthat were attached to Islam during the succeeding generations, asseen from his point of view. These included a jurisprudence thatincreasingly neglected the exertion of ijtihad in favor of taqlÊd, atheosophy that revolved around the doctrine of waÈdat al-wujåd, sufiorders that were organized on the basis of the absolute authority ofthe shaykh, and the all gamut of popular practices centered on saintworship, visiting their tombs and seeking their intercession with God.All these necessarily implied a challenge to the Ottoman State, whomhe regarded as the embodiment and mainstay of the deviations oflate orthodox Islam.MuÈammad ibn #Abd al-Wahh§b departed from Ibn Taymiyya’s7 On Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya and his work see Laoust, Ibn TaimÊya, pp. 489-492; Bell, pp. 92-181.8 Laoust, Ibn TaimÊya, pp. 477-505.9 Michael Cook, “On the Origins of Wahh§bism,” JRAS, 3rd series, 2 (1992),pp. 191-202; John Voll, “MuÈammad \\ayy§ al-SindÊ and MuÈammad ibn #Abdal-Wahh§b: an Analysis of an Intellectual Group in Eighteenth-Century MadÊna,”BSOAS, 38 (1975), pp. 32-39.3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM268"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"the salafiyya269teachings in some highly significant aspects.

The sharpest deviation of the Wahh§bÊs fromIbn Taymiyya’s teaching pertained, however, to their readiness toimpose their views by force. Charging their adversaries of unbelief(takfÊr) they implied letting the blood and property of most Muslims.In the face of such principles, and the general challenge inherent inthem to the Muslim state, the Wahh§bÊ teaching could encounteronly opposition on the part of the #ulama in the Ottoman Empire.10In Damascus we met such criticism in the writings of MuÈammadAmÊn #$bidÊn of the official \\anafÊ school, as well as by \\asan al-ShaããÊ the \\anbalÊ. The alliance with Ibn Sa#åd in 1744 suppliedthe Wahh§bÊs with the basis to the establishment of the “theocraticstate” that could realize their aims.

Though aware ofthe work of their counterparts in India and Iraq, these #ulama wereeven better placed to become acquainted with the teachings of IbnTaymiyya. The theological views and legal rulings of this scholar werepart of the tradition of the \\anbalÊ school, for which Damascus wasone of the most important centers in the Ottoman Empire, and inthe Muslim world in general. Most SalafÊs did not belong to thisschool but, as we have seen, the leading \\anbalÊ family in the city,the ShaããÊs, was attached to the same reformist circles from whichthey emerged. We observed that \\asan al-ShaããÊ, the founder of thatfamily in the first half of the nineteenth century relied on IbnTaymiyya’s jurisprudence in confirming the principle of talfÊq, andthat for his son, MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ, his political doctrine becamein the 1880s the basis of his critique of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II’s re-gime. Mußãaf§ al-ShaããÊ, the sharp opponent of the Salafiyya, dem-onstrated no less acquaintance with Ibn Taymiyya’s teachings in hiseffort to stress the difference between the great #alim and his mod-ern followers on the two cardinal questions of ijtihad and popularSufism.19 In addition, many manuscripts of works by Ibn Taymiyya,who spent most of his life in Damascus, were kept in the endowedmosque libraries of the city. At the beginning of the \\amÊdian pe-riod, the SalafÊs began to collect and catalogue those collections inone central library, the £§hiriyya, which thus became an importantcenter for the renewed study of his legacy.The SalafÊ trend of Damascus constituted a religious response tothe political alliance forged between the Ottoman State under themodernizing autocracy of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II and orthodox sufishaykhs and #ulama who were willing to mobilize the masses in his1 See chs. 2, 6, and 7.3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM273"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"chapter eight274support. At its inception the Salafiyya was divided into two distinctbranches, reflecting the different shaping and sources of inspirationthrough which its members arrived at the teaching of Ibn Taymiyya.The first branch comprised of #ulama who were shaped in #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s AkbarÊ circle; the second, also associated with thiscircle, consisted of graduates of the first state schools opened in thecity who were inspired by the ideas of the Young Ottoman move-ment in Istanbul. The leaders of the first branch, #Abd al-Razz§qal-BÊã§r, AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ, and Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ, whose sightwas limited to the conduct of the orthodox men of religion, tendedto focus, in their own circles, on the problem of adapting tradition-al jurisprudence and theology to the needs of the modern era. Inthis task they were assisted by the rationalist thinking of the leadersof Islamic Modernism, Jam§l al-DÊn al-Afgh§nÊ and, more profound-ly, MuÈammad #Abduh.2 The prominent figures of the second branch,•§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ and SalÊm al-Bukh§rÊ, who were more attentive tothe workings of the Ottoman state, and particularly of its educationalsystem, engaged themselves in addition in reviving the Arabic her-itage, thus forging an alternative basis of identity for their society.The affinity between these two branches of the emerging Salafiyyaof Damascus became more pronounced as the pressure amountedagainst them in the last years of #AbdülÈamÊd II’s reign, and evenmore so in the era of the Young Turks.Unlike the previous sections of this work, this part is not a detailedexamination of the history and teachings of the Salafiyya in Dam-ascus. Here we can rely on Commins’ comprehensive work, whichanalyzed the development of this trend from its beginnings in the1880s to the First World War, with a special focus on the figure ofJam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ, its foremost exponent. My aim in this chapteris to examine the Salafiyya within the broader framework of theprevious sufi reform trends that operated in Damascus, from whichit emerged, and against the backdrop of the populist regimes of thelate Ottoman Empire, to which it constituted a response.2 See my forthcoming article, “Between Sufi Reformism and Modernist Ratio-nalism—A Reappraisal of the Origins of the Salafiyya from the Damascene An-gle,” Die Welt des Islams, 41 (2001).3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM274"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"remolding religion275Returning to the Model of the ForefathersThe first #alim in Damascus to adopt the religious reform trend whichwas later to become the Salafiyya was #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r, #Abdal-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s foremost disciple in the city. Around 1885, atthe age of fifty, BÊã§r began to preach to rely solely on the Qur\"anand the sunna and to avoid approving any opinion or ruling with-out evidence.3 As we have seen in the writings of AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊand MuÈammad al-ShaããÊ, this was indeed the period when a re-newed interest in the teaching of Ibn Taymiyya appeared in Dam-ascus. This was also the time when BÊã§r, and other reformists ofthe city, first met MuÈammad #Abduh, then an exile in Beirut.4 Thusunder the inspiration of Ibn Taymiyya’s legacy, further fortified bythe Modernist thinking of #Abduh, BÊã§r became inclined toward theuse of a rationalist sort of ijtihad, as a means to adapt the religiouslaw to modern needs, and toward a purified form of Sufism, whoseprincipal role in the new circumstances was to preserve the spirit andmorality of Islam. The reliance on hadith meticulously examined forits authenticity, the use of reason, and the rejection of traditionalopinions at variance with modern science, henceforth became thedominant traits of BÊã§r’s religious writings.5As in the case of Ibn Taymiyya, the new reformist awareness of#Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r aroused opposition from those #ulama andsufi shaykhs who followed the practice of taqlÊd and cherished thepopular belief in the power of saints. The animosity of these ortho-dox men of religion surfaced mainly through their endeavors to im-plicate their reformist rivals with the authorities. Thus at the begin-ning of 1896, they persuaded the governor that meetings initiatedby the reformists two months earlier had been related to the spreadof the Young Turk movement to Syria. After consulting with themufti, MuÈammad al-ManÊnÊ, the governor decided to interrogatethem together with Badr al-DÊn al-\\asanÊ, the influential son of Yåsufal-MaghribÊ who was sharply criticizing the authorities in his ser-mons, and even the Sultan himself, claiming that the Caliphate had3 Bahjat al-BÊã§r, “#Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r,” pp. 318-319; BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar,pp. 11-12.4 BÊã§r visited Beirut in April 1886, though he had become acquainted with#Abduh already the previous year; see Q§y§tÊ, p. 154, and his letter to him on pp.199-201.5 BÊã§r, “#Abd al-Razz§q,” pp. 323-324; \\§fií and Ab§ía, p. 340; Låyis Shaykhå,Ta\"rÊkh al-$d§b al-#Arabiyya fÊ al-Rub# al-Awwal min al-Qarn al-#IshrÊn (Beirut, 1926),p. 35.3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM275"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"chapter eight276become a vile monarchy (mulk #a·å·). The governor avoided sum-moning AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ since he enjoyed French patronage. Thecharges leveled against the reformists were nonetheless purely reli-gious. They were accused of regarding themselves as mujtahids,meeting to read hadith, and demanding proofs for the rulings of thejurists. \\asanÊ and BÊã§r did not appear at the interrogation, whichwas harshly conducted by ManÊnÊ himself under orthodox pressure.Though the accused denied engaging in ijtihad, the mufti demand-ed to banish them from Damascus, and only because of the inter-vention of the qadi, who saw no foundation for the charges, andcertainly no political grounds, they were finally released. Only Jam§lal-DÊn al-Q§simÊ, the youngest of the group, was kept in custody asa warning to the rest. His family’s protest, and that of the Mayd§ninhabitants who crowded outside the court, together with the qadi’srecommendation, secured also his release the following day. Thus,in the first attempt to silence the new reformist trend, which becameknown as “the mujtahids incident”, the orthodox #ulama were de-feated. BÊã§r and his associates continued to hold their meetingsdespite ManÊnÊ’s interdiction, and the latter was finally obliged tosacrifice face and seek reconciliation.7“The mujtahids incident” allows us for the first time to identifythe religious men who followed #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r in adopt-ing the teachings of Ibn Taymiyya. Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ, our solesource of information about this incident, mentions ten #ulama whowere involved in the meetings that precipitated it. They were all#ulama shaped in the circle of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, or theirdisciples. Most of them had a clear sufi background, generally in-cluding both training in the teachings of Ibn #ArabÊ and affiliationwith one of the reformist orders active in Damascus at the time. Thecore of the group consisted, along with #Abd al-Razz§q himself, ofAÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ and SalÊm Sam§ra (1838-1909), the latter beinga close associate of BÊã§r and the successor of their teacher, MuÈam-mad al-•anã§wÊ, as well as the principal Sh§dhilÊ–F§sÊ shaykh in theMayd§n.8 In subsequent meetings these men were joined by #Abdal-GhanÊ al-BÊã§r, #Abd al-Razz§q’s brother, and by MuÈammad Sa#Êdal-Q§simÊ, his close associate.

One was Mußãaf§al-\\all§q (1859-1911), a nephew of MuÈammad Sa#Êd al-Q§simÊ anda member of #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r’s circle. It is reported of himthat upon realizing that offices are passed on by inheritance ratherthan by merit he decided to change his course, studied law, andbecame a successful advocate in Damascus.8 \\all§q was followed bytwo disciples of SalÊm Sam§ra, AmÊn al-Safarjal§nÊ (d. 1916), knownprimarily as the author of textbooks in various religious fields,9 andMuÈammad Sa#Êd al-Farr§\" (d. 1926), a grandson of #Al§\" al-DÊn#$bidÊn and, like him, an active shaykh in the Khalwatiyya–RaÈm§niyya.10The outstanding figure among those #ulama of the younger gen-eration who had taken part in the meetings of the reformist religiousmen of Damascus, however, was Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ himself,MuÈammad Sa#Êd’s son. During the “mujtahids incident” he wasspecifically accused of advocating the “Jam§lÊ madhhab”, that is, hisown legal method, though he was careful to deny it.

Nevertheless, the relations between the two remained cordialand, according to Q§simÊ, he continued to visit Kh§nÊ, who lovedhim and paid him increasing respect. He became much more inclinedto the study of hadith, a field that connected him with AÈmad al-ShaããÊ, and through him probably also to the teachings of AÈmadibn Taymiyya. Q§simÊ received a diploma from ShaããÊ, as the \\an-balÊ shaykh of Damascus, and the two met frequently to discussscholarly matters. In addition to the religious sciences, Jam§l al-DÊnwas encouraged by his father to read literary and historical worksin the family’s splendid library. He also sought diplomas from theleading reformist #ulama of the older generation in Damascus, menlike MaÈmåd \\amza and MuÈammad al-•anã§wÊ, as well as of hisown generation outside the city, such as Nu#m§n Khayr al-DÊn al-AlåsÊ. In a later stage of his life, Q§simÊ did not hesitate to studythe modern sciences of geography and geometry with younger teach-ers who had learned them in the state schools.11Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ began to teach jurisprudence in theSin§niyya mosque at the age of fourteen, in addition to reciting thehadith in his father’s lessons. In 1886, when he reached the age oftwenty, AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ chose him as prayer leader for the #Ann§bamosque, where he himself conducted the Q§dirÊ dhikr. They soonbecame close friends and would meet in the mosque to discuss re-ligious, as well as historical and literary, subjects. Probably underJaz§\"irÊ’s inspiration, Q§simÊ composed a poem to be recited on theProphet’s birthday (mawlid) concentrating on the details of his biog-raphy rather than on the usual imaginative and miraculous descrip-tions. This work, composed in 1888, was also the last time that hesigned his name with the titles NaqshbandÊ, as well as Ash#arÊ andSh§fi#Ê. Subsequent works are signed simply with his name. At thesame time Q§simÊ seems to have joined #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r’scircle.

They continued to operate basically in thetraditional manner as an intellectual group which convened privatelyin the homes of its members, on the example of #Abd al-Q§dir’s circlein which they had been raised. They did not even call themselvesSalafÊs, since they had not yet developed a clear notion of a distinc-tive identity. Moreover, in the following years the group graduallydissolved, as most #ulama of the older generation passed away andthe younger ones turned to their own ways. The only representa-tives of this reformist group who continued to exert some influencein Damascus at the beginning of the twentieth century were #Abdal-Razz§q al-BÊã§r himself at the head of his circle and Jam§l al-DÊnal-Q§simÊ with his writing. Only a handful of other #ulama in thecity followed their example or adopted the teachings of Ibn Taymiyyaindependently.13It was largely owing to this organizational weakness and meagerfollowing that #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r and Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊwere allowed in the years following the “mujtahids incident” rela-12 £. al-Q§simÊ, Jam§l al-DÊn, pp. 30, 35-42; Q§simÊ, Ta#ãÊr al-Mash§mm, p. 70.13 The most outstanding such independent thinker who adopted the way of IbnTaymiyya in Damascus was #Abd al-Q§dir Badr§n (1848-1927). Badr§n, an erst-while editor of the provincial paper, had a philosophical disposition, and he is saidto have decided to adopt the \\anbalÊ doctrine after comparing the law books ofthe four schools and becoming convinced that Ibn \\anbal was the most knowl-edgeable in hadith, and his school the closest to the literal meaning of the Qur\"anand the sunna. Unlike members of BÊã§r’s circle, Badr§n distinguished himself byhis virulent attacks upon religious innovations and popular practices, leading theorthodox to regard him as an infidel (zindÊq) and as “the Wahh§bÊ of his time.”On #Abd al-Q§dir Badr§n see MuÈammad al-#AjamÊ, #All§mat al-Sh§m #Abd al-Q§diribn Badr§n al-DimashqÊ: \\ay§tuhu wa-$th§ruhu (Beirut, 1996); \\§fií and Ab§ía, pp.422-424; Badr§n, Mun§damat al-Aãl§l, introduction by the editor, MuÈammad Bahjatal-BÊã§r, pp. k-n; GhazzÊ, Al-Na#t al-Akmal, pp. 411-413; \\ißnÊ, pp. 762-763; JundÊ,A#l§m al-Adab, vol. 1, pp. 224-225; Qud§ma, p. 113.3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM279"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"chapter eight280tive freedom in their work in Damascus, and in establishing contactswith comrades in other Arab cities of the Empire, though theirorthodox rivals occasionally tried to harass them.

Threecases of books were confiscated and handed over to the religious courtfor scrutiny. Fortunately for Q§simÊ, the policemen had been satis-fied with checking his living room and overlooked his library, whichcontained many books published in Egypt and banned by the \\amÊdi-an censor.22 Similar searches were conducted a number of times after1906 in BÊã§r’s house. Visiting Istanbul the same year, he was of-fered the office of mufti or qadi in one of the other cities in Syria,probably to keep him away from Damascus. Like his father beforehim #Abd al-Razz§q rejected the offer, claiming that he wished onlyto serve #ilm.23The year 1906, which witnessed this intensified assault by theorthodox #ulama on #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r and Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ, was also decisive for the internal consolidation of the SalafÊtrend in Damascus.

Yet, unlike the other #ulama in #Abd al-Q§dir’scircle, •§hir also enrolled in the Jaqmaqiyya school, the first stateschool to be opened in Damascus, and this set him on a unique path.There he studied the primary Islamic languages—Arabic, Persian,and Turkish—and some elements of the modern sciences, thusacquiring practical knowledge that his contemporaries among the#ulama of the city usually lacked. Under these influences Jaz§\"irÊ dedi-cated himself to reading, especially in the natural sciences and inhistory, as well as Arabic literature. To better understand the rootsof the latter, he also learned the ancient Semitic languages Syriac,Hebrew and Ethiopic, later in his life adding French. Most conse-quential, though, was Jaz§\"irÊ’s mastery of Turkish, which facilitatedhis contact, after the ascension of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II and theprorogation of the parliament, with several Young Ottoman activists,and following them with MidÈat Pasha, the leader of the constitu-tional movement, who were dispatched to Damascus as governorsto keep them away from the Ottoman capital.25•§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s first acquaintance with the Young Ottoman as-sociation and its ideas on freedom and love of the fatherland goesback to Ziy§ Pasha’s short governorship at the beginning of 1877,when he was already teaching in the official £§hiriyya school. Thereis no evidence for any contact between Jaz§\"irÊ and Ziy§ himself, whowas a leading figure in the association and a member of the com-mission that drew up the constitution in Istanbul. He did meet,however, Ziy§’s secretary who had accompanied him to Syria, Bah§\"Bey, and the latter was impressed by his erudition and energy. Itwas Bah§\" who introduced Jaz§\"irÊ to MidÈat Pasha after his arrivalin Syria at the end of 1878, convincing him thereby of the benefitsof allying with favorable rulers.26 MidÈat, who had already becomea keen supporter of the principle of federalism, inaugurated with hischaracteristic vigor a comprehensive set of reforms, designed to con-solidate local government in Syria and improve the standard of liv-ing of its inhabitants.27 Reserving a special place in this plan for ed-25 Kurd #AlÊ, Kunåz al-Ajd§d, pp. 5-6; B§nÊ, TanwÊr al-Baß§\"ir, pp. 73-75; KhaãÊb,p. 94.26 #^s§ Iskandar Ma#låf, “Al-Shaykh •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ,” Al-Hil§l, 28 (1920), p.452.27 For a description and evaluation of MidÈat’s governorship in Syria see Gross,pp. 259-314; Shimon Shamir, “The Modernization of Syria: Problems and Solu-3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM283"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"chapter eight284ucation, he chose Jaz§\"irÊ as his right hand in its implementation.The two worked through al-Jam#iyya al-Khayriyya, the BenevolentSociety which had been founded a few years earlier at the initiativeof some Damascene #ulama and notables under the leadership of #Al§\"al-DÊn #$bidÊn.28 Jaz§\"irÊ himself had joined it before MidÈat’s ar-rival, but with the governor’s support he became the group’s lead-ing figure. Funded by contributions, the Society took control of de-serted colleges and mosques, establishing in them a number of schools,for boys and for girls. Its considerable success allowed MidÈat tonominate Jaz§\"irÊ as General Inspector of Education in Syria. In thiscapacity, he trained teachers, persuaded parents to send their chil-dren to the new schools, composed textbooks, and supervised theirpublishing in the Society’s press. In addition, Jaz§\"irÊ attached pri-mary importance to assembling the manuscript collections that hadbeen endowed as waqf in the colleges and mosques of Damascus intoa central library, where they would be better preserved. For thispurpose he founded the £§hiriyya Library, the core of the nationallibrary of Syria, obliging the recalcitrant administrators of theseendowments, with the backing of the authorities, to hand over thecollections in their possession.29•§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ was determined to continue with his educationalreform activities in Syria even after the dismissal of MidÈat Pashaduring the summer of 1880. Yet, in the following years he came underincreasing pressure from his orthodox rivals in Damascus, whoaround 1886 managed to obtain an imperial edict ordering theabolition of his post.30 Our sources do not specify who these rivalsof Jaz§\"irÊ were, but MuÈammad Kurd #AlÊ, his close disciple andbiographer, informs us that his teacher detested most of all the twobrothers ‘§liÈ and #$rif al-Munayyir.

We have already seenhow ‘§liÈ, who joined the Benevolent Society and helped found the£§hiriyya Library, decided in 1882 to change course and serve the\\amÊdian regime, being followed by #$rif who thereby secured him-self a seat on the provincial education council.31 Jaz§\"irÊ’s bitternesstoward them must have originated in this period, and it seems thatthis experience led him to urge religious students to learn a craft sothat as #ulama they would remain independent and capable of de-fending their honor and religion, and of fulfilling their task of com-mending good and forbidding evil.32It was the bitter experiences of these years that led •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ,in the footsteps of #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r, to the teaching of IbnTaymiyya. He immersed himself in Ibn Taymiyya’s books that hefound in the £§hiriyya Library and, realizing their value for thestruggle against the orthodox, began to distribute copies he had madeof them cheaply and without naming their author. Such ruses hadbecome necessary once his rivals understood the challenge posed forthem by Ibn Taymiyya’s thought.33 An echo of the new demarca-tion line between reformist and orthodox #ulama in Damascus maybe found in the biographical note that appeared about Jaz§\"irÊ inRashÊd Ri·§’s al-Man§r following his death in 1920. Though mostlycritical, the author did say that Jaz§\"irÊ had stopped the governmentfrom destroying Ibn Taymiyya’s tomb in Damascus by raising pub-lic opinion against it. He placed this episode during the administra-tion of MidÈat Pasha but, in view of •§hir’s special relationship withthis governor, it seems more likely that it occurred somewhat lat-er.34Under the inspiration of the Young Ottoman patriotic and liber-al ideas, this interest in the works of Ibn Taymiyya became in •§hiral-Jaz§\"irÊ’s thought part of a larger scheme which, beyond the lo-cal cultural renaissance among his more traditional counterparts, wasdesigned to revive the heritage of the Arab homeland at large.Working now in a state school for his living, Jaz§\"irÊ nonethelessdedicated most of his time to examining the manuscripts he collect-31 See pp. 126-127.32 B§nÊ, TanwÊr al-Baß§\"ir, p. 80; Kurd #AlÊ, Kunåz al-Ajd§d, p. 17; idem, Al-Mudhakkir§t, vol. 3, p. 720.33 Kurd #AlÊ, Kunåz al-Ajd§d, p. 9; B§nÊ, TanwÊr al-Baß§\"ir, p. 38.34 ‘§liÈ Mukhliß Ri·§, “Al-Shaykh •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ al-DimashqÊ: \\ay§tuhu wa-Mawtuhu wa-Nash\"atuhu al-#Ilmiyya,” al-Man§r, 22 (1921), p. 640.3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM285"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"chapter eight286ed in the £§hiriyya Library. In the years that followed he expandedthis activity, undertaking travels in search of rare manuscripts to otherSyrian cities, to neighboring Arab countries, and later even to Eu-rope. He thus established himself as one of the leading Arabic biblio-graphers of his time. Jaz§\"irÊ gained the recognition of Arab writersand European Orientalists alike, and he regularly corresponded andexchanged information with many of them. Among his acquaintan-ces he could count Ignaz Goldziher, whom he befriended during thelatter’s visit to Damascus.35 These scholarly concerns did not pre-vent Jaz§\"irÊ from continuing his political engagement, and after theemergence of the Young Turk movement he established contacts withits activists in Syria.36 Nevertheless, during periods when it was lessactive, the \\amÊdian regime allowed Jaz§\"irÊ relative freedom andhe did not hesitate to rely again upon government assistance toadvance his projects. In 1898, when Young Turk activities seemedto have been completely suppressed, he even received a new officialappointment, this time as the supervisor of public libraries in Syria.In this capacity he traveled throughout the province, encouragingthe establishment of new libraries in its cities, including the Kh§lidiyyaLibrary in Jerusalem. With the resurgence of Young Turk activityfour years later, Jaz§\"irÊ’s initiatives were again restricted.37Since •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ was one of the first religious students inDamascus to deviate from the traditional course of lessons from the#ulama and guidance from the sufi shaykhs, he found few partnersamong his generation. His main associate during these early yearswas SalÊm al-Bukh§rÊ, the second major figure in this branch of theSalafiyya.

He thus sharedthe background of •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ in many respects, though oursources do not clarify when exactly they became partners on the pathof reform. However, we do learn that like Jaz§\"irÊ, Bukh§rÊ beganto develop a keen interest in the rare manuscripts assembled in the£§hiriyya Library, particularly in those of AÈmad ibn Taymiyya andIbn Qayyim al-Jawziyya. He also met MuÈammad #Abduh in Beirutand Damascus, and expressed a deep appreciation for his eruditionand views. In the footsteps of Jaz§\"irÊ, SalÊm al-Bukh§rÊ adopted thesame combination of opposition to the traditionalism of the ortho-dox #ulama, assimilation of the modern sciences he was exposed toin school, the political ideas of the Young Ottomans, and the reviv-al of the Arabic heritage.SalÊm al-Bukh§rÊ also followed •§hir al-Jaza\"irÊ in seeking an officialpost favorable for the work of reform. Thanks to his mastery of theTurkish language and his considerable religious knowledge, he wasthus able to secure himself in the late 1880s an appointment as muftiof the Fifth Ottoman Army, stationed in Syria. This position, in whichcapacity Bukh§rÊ was responsible for a quarter of a century for theexemption of religious students from military duty, enabled him tobecome acquainted with most of the #ulama of Syria.

In his encounterswith other #ulama, and in his instruction of religious students, Bukh§rÊcould express his views with relative freedom, at least regarding thereligious reforms that he preached. His position in the army also ledhim to political activity and, like Jaz§\"irÊ, he joined the Young Turkassociation. Bukh§rÊ remained an influential member of that associ-ation until after the revolution of 1908.38With the enormous expansion of the state school system duringthe \\amÊdian period, in Damascus and in Syria in general, •§hiral-Jaz§\"irÊ, too, began to acquire an increasing number of followersamong the younger generation.

Under his guidance theyassimilated religious values which corresponded with the modernscientific thought they were acquiring in the state schools, discussedpolitical and social ideas coming from the West, and celebrated thelocal Arabic heritage. Under Jaz§\"irÊ’s inspiration, many of them alsobecame affiliated with the Young Turk opposition.40Thus, despite his acceptance of official employment, in his studycircles and research •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ exhibited a spirit of indepen-dence from state authority which he had imbibed in the local—re-formist milieu of Amir #Abd al-Q§dir. When he decided to removethe white headgear of the #ulama, seeking to avoid being consideredone of the opportunist jurists of the time, he accordingly replaced itwith the green headgear which characterized the merchants.41 Jaz§\"irÊproved faithful to the local—reformist tendency also in his maintain-ing of good relations with members of the non-orthodox and non-Muslim communities. He regarded association with them as animportant asset and espoused a general religious tolerance on thebasis of common values.42 But, beyond such established modes of eliteactivity, •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ proved to be one of the first reformist menof religion in Damascus to realize, in the face of the populist poli-cies of Sultan #AbdülÈamÊd II, the importance of reaching out to themasses. Jaz§\"irÊ began accordingly to frequent the study circles of the#ulama and particularly the dhikr sessions of the sufi shaykhs in or-der to attract them to rational investigation and discussion. To theshaykhs he would suggest sufi books that corresponded with his ownreformist views, in an effort to curb the irrational beliefs and pop-ular practices prevalent among them. Furthermore, through his sim-ple and lucid method of teaching Jaz§\"irÊ was able to appeal direct-ly to the common people, who were normally prevented from politicaland religious deliberation by the high language of the learned schol-ars.43 At the same time Jaz§\"irÊ began to encourage his disciples to39 For a discussion of innovation and adaptation among the #ulama, and theurban elite in general, see Roded, pp. 129-147.40 Commins, pp. 92-95.41 Kurd #AlÊ, Al-Mu#§ßirån, pp. 272, 276; idem, Al-Mudhakkir§t, vol. 3, p. 720.42 B§nÊ, TanwÊr al-Baß§\"ir, pp. 78-79; Kurd #AlÊ, Kunåz al-Ajd§d, pp. 16-17; idem,Al-Mudhakkir§t, vol. 3, p. 721.43 B§nÊ, TanwÊr al-Baß§\"ir, pp. 75-77, 131-134; Kurd #AlÊ, Kunåz al-Ajd§d, p. 15.3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM288"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"remolding religion289establish newspapers and magazines to further spread the reformistideas. In these he recommended to include extensive translations,arguing that since the Arabs were still not fully mature, they mustdraw (iqtib§s) from those more advanced. While in Egypt Jaz§\"irÊhimself participated in editing Al-Majalla al-Salafiyya; and his recom-mendation was faithfully adopted by MuÈammad Kurd #AlÊ whobegan publishing Al-Muqtabas.44As was the case with #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r and his circle, theorthodox men of religion in Damascus continued to harass •§hiral-Jaz§\"irÊ and SalÊm al-Bukh§rÊ, too, whenever an opportunity arouse.Time and again the two were summoned to an interrogation by theOttoman authorities on the basis of complaints lodged against themby these #ulama, though their connections with the Turkish admin-istration always helped them to escape punishment.45 This persecu-tion intensified from 1902 onwards, following the renewal of YoungTurk activity after its first congress in Paris. A thorough search wasconducted in Jaz§\"irÊ’s house and office while he was in Jerusalem,as well as in twenty other houses in Damascus. This time the Otto-man government itself targeted both him and Bukh§rÊ, suspectingthat they were corresponding with Young Turk activists in Europe.46Nevertheless, over the following four years, Jaz§\"irÊ continued his workin the libraries of Syria, and it was only in the summer of 1906 thathe decided to flee. He sold most of his books and, under the pretextof a working tour along the coast, sailed to Egypt with three chestsof valuable books he had decided to keep.47•§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s departure from Syria was certainly motivatedby his displeasure with the constant surveillance of the Ottoman gov-ernment and by his desire to be reunited with associates and disci-ples who had earlier left for Egypt to enjoy its relatively free atmo-sphere.

This development first became notice-able in Damascus, where the first revolutionary cell of the CUP hadbeen established in 1906 among the field officers, including Mußãaf§Kem§l, who two years later were to lead the revolution.48 For Jaz§\"irÊ,the strengthening of the Turkish “nationalists” in the opposition campmeant an end to his hopes that deposing #AbdülÈamÊd II wouldguarantee general political freedom in the Ottoman Empire, andallow the inhabitants of the Arab provinces to cultivate their distinc-tive identity within its framework.49 It was apparently this disappoint-ment which convinced Jaz§\"irÊ to take the final step of substitutingthe idea of local patriotism, which he derived from the Young Ot-toman teaching, with the nationalist idea which, although less ame-nable to the precepts of Islam, could be justified by stressing thatthe salaf, to whose example Ibn Taymiyya preached to return, wereArabs. In 1906 disciples of Jaz§\"irÊ were clandestinely organizing forthe first time under the nationalist banner in the Arab RenaissanceSociety.50This new Arabist interpretation of Ibn Taymiyya’s legacy led •§hiral-Jaz§\"irÊ to approach the leaders of the more traditional branch ofthe Salafiyya in Damascus, who by that time became increasinglyidentified with the Wahh§biyya. The teachings preached by theWahh§bÊ scholars of the nineteenth century were more moderate thanthe original ones, especially with regard to takfÊr, and thus were bettersuited to attract religious reformists in the urban centers of theOttoman Empire. More significant still was the Wahh§bÊ revivalwhich began in 1902 with the conquest of Riyadh by #Abd al-#AzÊzibn Sa#åd, offering these reformists an alternative Arab focus ofidentity as against the Ottoman.

This gap could be bridged only bySalafÊ leaders of the following generation, whose more modernupbringing enabled them to better express their ideas in writing. Theonly major expression of the SalafÊ views in Damascus at the end ofthe Ottoman period thus appears in the writings of their youngestleader, Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ. His writings may be seen as initial-ly representing the views of BÊã§r, the founder of the legal—theo-logical branch of the Salafiyya, and at least after 1906, also those ofJaz§\"irÊ and Bukh§rÊ, the heads of the branch emphasizing the Ar-abic heritage. In the analysis of these writings I rely largely onCommins’ findings, and on the detailed biography compiled byQ§simÊ’s son.Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ’s mature thought rested on two fundamen-tal principles, reason and unity. The central importance that theSalafÊs attached to reason was basically a response to the challengeposed by the scientific achievements and philosophical ideas of theWest. Like #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ in the previous generation,Q§simÊ advocated adopting the fruits of Western science in orderto integrate Islamic civilization into the modern world and satisfyits growing needs. However, in view of the increasing disinterest ofstudents of the state schools in religion, the dangers for Muslim societyinherent in Western rationalist philosophy became for him, as forMuÈammad #Abduh, more acute. In his Dal§\"il al-TawÈÊd (Proofs ofGod’s Unity), completed in July 1908, Q§simÊ followed #Abduh inreviving traditional dialectical theology as a defense of religion againstEuropean thinkers and their Muslim followers, who since the assaultof Jam§l al-DÊn al-Afgh§nÊ on their foremost protagonist in India,AÈmad Kh§n, had become known as Materialists (dahriyyån).57 Heopens the book with a series of quasi-scientific proofs for the exist-ence of God, and then seeks to demonstrate that European notions56 B§nÊ, “SalÊm al-Bukh§rÊ,” p. 744.57 Hourani, Arabic Thought, pp. 124-127; Keddie, Islamic Response, pp. 73-84, andthe English translation of his essay in pp. 130-174.3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM292"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"remolding religion293are merely uncertain hypotheses and that the call to reject religionthreatens to disintegrate society by undermining its moral basis.Q§simÊ gives to reason a broader scope for activity than did #Abdal-Q§dir, largely corresponding to the ideas of Afgh§nÊ and #Abduh.He not only believed in an underlying harmony between reason andrevelation, but also regarded it as a natural human faculty whichallows one to discern good from evil, and as a tool to interpret thescriptures. Unlike the tendency of more Westernized students of thenew state schools, Q§simÊ also maintained that scientific discoveriescould serve to strengthen faith, since they uncover additional signs(§y§t) of the existence of God, rather than diminish it. On the otherhand, in accordance with the \\anbalÊ approach, and especially withIbn Taymiyya’s view, he denied the capability of reason to compre-hend the nature of God and argued that one must accept the at-tributes ascribed to Him in the Qur\"an without trying to understand.58The central position of unity in the SalafÊ teaching derived, by con-trast, from the longstanding and poignant feeling that Islam hadregressed and that internal dissension was the fundamental cause forthe Muslims having become easy prey to foreigners. In reliance onIbn Taymiyya’s teaching, the SalafÊs sought to reestablish a unifiedumma on the basis of the original form of the religion, as it had beentaught by the Prophet and implemented by the forefathers of Islam,al-salaf al-‘§liÈ. They clearly preferred a moderate and peacefulinterpretation of this teaching to the original Wahh§bÊ one. ThusQ§simÊ denounces in his writings the practice of #ulama to chargetheir peers with misleading others (ta·lÊl), and calls for unity on thebasis of generally accepted fundamental religious precepts. He waseven more averse to the practice of takfÊr which, as he points out,was introduced into Islam by the Khaw§rij, asserting that those whoturn toward Mecca in their prayers and fulfil the precepts of theshari#a must not be declared heretics. For the sake of unity he evensought compromise, in the footsteps of Sh§h WalÊall§h and MuÈam-mad al-Shawk§nÊ, between Sunnis and Shi#is.59 As part of the samemoderate approach, Q§simÊ tried to prove the validity of his ownway, rather than attacking the views of his rivals.

Similarly, he refrained from denouncingthe Ash#arÊ and M§turÊdÊ theological schools, which indulged them-selves in reflections upon God’s attributes, despite his espousal of theopposite \\anbalÊ stand. Q§simÊ did not hesitate to reproach IbnTaymiyya and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya themselves for asserting thatmembers of these schools were heretics.Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ criticizes Ibn Taymiyya and his discipleseven more explicitly for declaring Ibn #ArabÊ to be heretic. Agree-ing that one might denounce Ibn #ArabÊ in cases where he practicedunlawful allegorical interpretation (ta\"wÊl), Q§simÊ nonetheless main-tains that the theological thought and legal method of al-Shaykh al-Akbar show that he did not belong to this category. The best wouldbe to avoid the difficult points in his teaching while regarding hisbelief as firm and his intentions as sincere.61 The emphasis on Ibn#ArabÊ’s merit as a theologian and jurist, who espoused views thatgenerally corresponded with those of the SalafÊs’ in the matters oftawÈÊd and ijtihad, rather than as a sufi, epitomizes well the essenceof their divergence from #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ’s teaching. It iscomplemented by Q§simÊ’s presentation of the AkbarÊ teaching asan Islamic philosophy. Viewing the sufis with the same moderateapproach that characterized his entire thought, he seeks to delineatea middle way between their opponents, who conclude from theirutterances that they are infidels, and their admirers, who regard theirpath as the essence and goal of Islam. Those who examine theirworks, Q§simÊ maintains, notice that Sufism constitutes a branch ofphilosophy (fann al-Èikma), though since the authors are people ofspiritual training (riy§·a), self-deprivation (tajrÊd), and asceticism (taza-hhud), theirs is not a pure Greek philosophy, but a mixture of ideasunique to Islam.

The significance of this concept in his teaching,however, differs perceptibly from its use among jurists of the firstcenturies of Islam, and from how it was later used by their succes-sors who increasingly applied to the practice of taqlÊd. The two prin-ciples underlying Q§simÊ’s application of ijtihad, which he imbibedfrom #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r, were the provision of proof for eachruling and the rejection of any prejudgment based upon the tradi-tions of a sect or legal school. In reliance on Ibn Taymiyya’s teach-ing he claimed that truth is not limited to one school, and thatmujtahids had never ceased to exist in the umma. In the face ofconservative opposition, he also tried to justify ijtihad by quoting theheads of the various legal schools forbidding anyone to imitate theirrulings without verifying the sources. These great jurists of the past,like Ibn Taymiyya and religious reformists in general, had turneddirectly to the Qur\"an and the sunna for their rulings, and it was tothese same sources that Q§simÊ now called scholars to return. Nev-ertheless, for him the principal advantage of ijtihad lay in its valuefor deciding matters for which the Qur\"an and the sunna do notprovide explicit solutions, when proof would have to be based onreason. Such a concept again betrays Q§simÊ’s affinity to MuÈam-mad #Abduh, whose aim was to bring free investigation into thereligious sciences as a means to adopt Western innovations for thebenefit and advancement of Muslim society. Q§simÊ knew that therational use of ijtihad could lead to disagreement and dissent, buthe believed that these might be limited by ensuring the erudition ofthe mujtahids in both the roots of jurisprudence and in the mannerof argumentation.6462 Ibid., pp. 303-304; Commins, p. 80.63 Ibid., pp. 629-631.64 Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ, Al-Fatw§ fÊ al-Isl§m (Damascus, 1911); idem, Irsh§d3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM295"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"chapter eight296Reason and unity were also the two pillars of Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ’s criticism of the Salafiyya’s opponents, the #ulama and sufishaykhs of the Ottoman—orthodox tendency. Though he was de-terred by their strength from expressing it openly, his deep animos-ity toward them appears in his diary, where his sharp words againstthem clearly contrasted with his characteristic moderation. Like otherSalafÊs, Q§simÊ calls these men of religion either j§midån, “frozen ones”or Èashwiyya, “populists.” He describes them as pretenders unwor-thy of their positions, and as the cause of Islam’s decline in the eyesof the younger generation. These were evident from their inactionin the face of the spread of religious innovations and the increasingimitation of European culture.65 Such criticism of the orthodox #ul-ama was formulated, on the basis of Ibn Taymiyya’s teaching, byrejecting the practice of taqlÊd which underlay their entire erudition.In one instance Q§simÊ wrote that “blind imitation is leprosy whichspread among the people and began to eradicate them. This is aterrifying disease, a general paralysis, and a perplexing madness thatthrows man into apathy and idleness.”66 TaqlÊd was, in his opinion,also the cause of school partisanship (ta#aßßub lil-madhhab), whetherlegal or theological, which spread dissension in the umma, as wellas the obstacle to free inquiry and the efficient adaptation of theshari#a to the changing circumstances of the modern age. ThusQ§simÊ echoes the words of #Abd al-Q§dir half a century earlier inwriting that for the imitator the criterion for establishing the truthis the imam of his school rather than reason or the scriptures, so thatthere is no use in arguing with him.67 Just as sharp, and again in thefootsteps of Ibn Taymiyya, is Q§simÊ’s condemnation of the popu-lar sufi shaykhs, who are “like electric poles, spreading madness inthe heads of the people and leading them to exhibit symptoms thatseem like epilepsy and mental disease. The ceaseless reiteration ofthe name All§h leads to spiritual madness or melancholy.”68 Q§simÊalso sets out against practices that had become associated with Sufism,such as asceticism and self-mortification which he depicts as narcoticideas contradicting both reason and the shari#a, and especially againstthe visit of saints’ tombs to seek their intercession with God.

Hisattitude clearly reflects the influence of •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, whichbecame so crucial for him by 1906. Referring to a question put tohim regarding these young people after the Young Turk revolution,Q§simÊ elucidates the factors that made them dear to him under theconditions prevailing in the city during the autocratic regime of#AbdülÈamÊd II:Be content now that they are the supporters of truth, the adversariesof “the tombs people”. If a question seems logical to them, they ac-cept it, otherwise they reject it. They are a group of intellectuals, clever,prudent, authors, creators, up to this point. As for the logical andtraditional sciences, their discussions and investigations do not con-cern them. The cursed \\amÊdian policy generated revulsion against#ilm and decreed that it be slain by the frequent persecution of itspeople. In my opinion, the #alim who excelled during his reign (mulk)in his country is one of the wonders of the world, since those whoendured the persecutions and sought #ilm for its own sake, knowingthat their vast knowledge would lead to every disgraceful accusationof them, and that the greatest shame and sin would be a book theywould publish or an idea they would mention, those who endured allthese nothing is more astonishing than them. Therefore, do not wonderat those who do not know the way of the salaf, nor indeed of the khalaf,nor what is theology.70The \\amÊdian and Young Turk centralized regimes also led Jam§lal-DÊn al-Q§simÊ to show sympathy for the Arab nationalist viewsemerging among this younger generation. Q§simÊ emphasizes inmany of his books that Islam had been delivered to the Arabs in theirown tongue, and that it was they who disseminated it in the time ofthe salaf. Nevertheless, here too, this sympathy does not imply thathe shared all of their opinions. Until the end of his life, Q§simÊ re-mained faithful to the Ottoman State, stressing its basic religiousidentity and its importance as the principal defender of the Muslimcountries, including the Arab ones, against Western assault.7169 Ibid., p. 351; Commins, p. 81.70 £. al-Q§simÊ, Jam§l al-DÊn, pp. 603-604.71 Ibid., p. 469.

Yet, in contrast to the great jurist of ShaykhKh§lid’s time, who professed the traditional tenet that the #ulamaare the ålÊ al-amr, those in authority over the rulers, the SalafÊs rea-lized that under the new circumstances of the \\amÊdian regime itwas the state which harnessed the #ulama to its Westernizing auto-cratic project. In their quest after a new, more independent, basisfor involvement in the affairs of their society the reformists turnedto the teaching of Ibn Taymiyya. Thus in the footsteps of IbnTaymiyya, Q§simÊ sought to restore the unity of the Muslim ummaupon the foundation of the way of the forefathers, al-salaf al-‘§liÈ,and like him, he regarded reason as an important tool for defend-ing Islam against its assailants. These two basic principles led himto follow Ibn Taymiyya in rejecting both taqlÊd and popular Sufism,and in adopting ijtihad and, at least to a limited extent, a moderateform of Sufism which was primarily a practical—moral system ofworship. Nonetheless, Q§simÊ lacked the religious zeal of IbnTaymiyya and the synthesis which he strove to effect was much moretolerant than that of his model. He included within it not only thelegal madhhabs, but also the theological schools and sufi thought.In the latter sphere, most salient was his defense of Ibn #ArabÊ, whomIbn Taymiyya vehemently attacked, an attempt that undoubtedly re-flects the heritage left in Damascus by #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ. Thegreatest deviation of Q§simÊ from the teaching of Ibn Taymiyya, how-ever, concerned the limits set by the latter on the use of reason. Inthe face of the increasing impact of Western thought and science,this became for him the main tool for assimilating their fruits andthus preserving the vitality of Islam in the modern world. In viewof the centralizing and populist policies of the \\amÊdian regime, thisrationalist application of the way of the salaf also determined thefriendly attitude of Q§simÊ and his SalafÊ comrades toward the newgeneration of secular intellectuals then emerging in Syria in the shad-ow of Western influence, and ultimately also toward the Arab na-tionalist movement that sprang therefrom.3-8.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM298"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"remolding religion299The Suppression by the Young Turk Regime•§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ did not share the enthusiasm which took hold ofhis fellow Syrians, and many subjects of the Ottoman Empire, in thewake of the Young Turk revolution of July 1908.

His indignation mountedin the following years, as the CUP tightened its grip on the reignsof power in Istanbul and its centralist policies came to the fore.Visiting Syria two months before the First World War broke out,Jaz§\"irÊ was summoned to interrogation promptly upon landing inTripoli, on the suspicion that he sought to annex the Syrian prov-inces to Egypt on behalf of the British.72 At that time he was main-taining that the Young Turk regime was doomed and that the Ar-abs should prepare to exploit the coming opportunities.

After a few days of confusion about the significanceof the events unfolding in Istanbul, two camps emerged among themen of religion in Damascus. The orthodox #ulama faithful to #Ab-dülÈamÊd II, who still reigned as Sultan, began to preach against thenew regime, claiming that its goal was to seduce Muslims from theirreligion and to replace the Qur\"an and the sunna with a man-madeconstitution. The reformist #ulama, by contrast, supported the con-stitution, which they thought would put an end to the \\amÊdianautocracy and usher in, in Syria and the entire Empire, a regime offreedom.75 They gathered twenty days after the revolution in sup-port of the Young Turks in the house of SalÊm al-KuzbarÊ (d. 1912),the hadith teacher under the Nasr Dome in the Umayyad mosque.76Q§simÊ composed a special speech for the occasion, in which heasserted that the constitution is not only compatible with the shari#a,but that religion actually necessitates it. He likened the provisionsof the constitution to legal rulings deriving from the four “roots ofjurisprudence” by way of ijtihad, and claimed that al-salaf al-‘§liÈhad anticipated the makers of all constitutions in their concern forthe interests of the nation in their time! On the other hand, Q§simÊwarned against any freedom not bound by the precepts of the shari#aand moral principles.77During the following months it became evident that the power ofthe orthodox #ulama, whose call to adhere to the shari#a in its tra-ditional form was more intelligible for the masses than the new ideas74 B§nÊ, TanwÊr al-Baß§\"ir, p. 140; KhaãÊb, pp. 115-116.75 Gross, pp. 518-525.76 On SalÊm, the son of AÈmad Muslim al-KuzbarÊ, see \\§fií and Ab§ía, p.282; BÊã§r, \\ilyat al-Bashar, pp. 682-683.

They decidedto display their strength on the eve of the parliamentary electionsof October 1908, exploiting the visit of RashÊd Ri·§ to Syria to stirup the crowd against their adversaries, the CUP and its SalafÊ sup-porters. Ri·§ was honored to give a public lecture in the Umayyadmosque, which many attended. He promised another lecture on thenext day, but then ‘§liÈ al-TånisÊ, a conservative #alim who hadarrived in Damascus only shortly before him and had been recruit-ed for this purpose, began railing against him, being joined by #Abdal-Q§dir al-KhaãÊb.

Their rivals further tried to remove them from theirpositions in the Daqq§q and Sin§niyya mosques, and only the im-perial certificates of their possession prevented that. Both preferredto let the situation calm down, rather than enter into conflict withthe orthodox. It was only four months later that they dared to re-turn to their mosques.

In letters he exchanged withhis colleagues, MaÈmåd ShukrÊ al-AlåsÊ of Baghdad and MuÈam-mad NaßÊf of Jedda, there is a sense of urgency, undoubtedly rootedin their bitter experience with the conservative persecution, and inthe desire to disseminate, against them, the spirit of rational enlight-enment.83#Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r and Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ’s sense of relieflasted for only a few months.

The first of them, the Kh§lidiyya, wasa branch of the NaqshbandÊ–MujaddidÊ order which sought to re-invigorate the weakening central government. Its founder, ShaykhKh§lid of Kurdistan, received his authorization in the mother or-der in India and spread its teachings in the Asiatic regions of theOttoman Empire. Basing himself in Damascus in the last four yearsof his life, 1823-1827, Kh§lid generated in the city a considerablereligious awakening on the two pillars of strict adherence to the pre-cepts of the sharÊ#a and activity within the framework of the ãarÊqa.These reflected the two faces of the Naqshbandiyya—#ilm and taßaw-wuf, united at their root by a mystic inversion in which spiritualexperience precedes the treading of the path. From this inversionderived the ãarÊqa’s organization around the guiding shaykh, its strongaffinity to orthodoxy and to its bearers, the #ulama, and its involve-ment in social and political affairs. Kh§lid himself was motivated bya deep feeling that the umma lived under a serious regression, call-ing for a vigorous regeneration. This feeling derived from the de-cline of the Ottoman central government and the strengthening ofits internal enemies, especially the ultra-orthodox Wahh§bÊ move-ment, which defied it from the Arabian Peninsula, and the non-orthodox Bekt§shÊ order, the patron of the Janissary corps in Istan-bul, which obstructed its way to reform. As a NaqshbandÊ shaykh,Kh§lid regarded it as his duty to influence the rulers and, throughthem the entire umma, to return to the path of the shari#a and thusrestore its vitality. The Kh§lidÊ sub-order constituted the organiza-tional tool for his activity, and in this sphere lay the principal nov-elties Kh§lid introduced in the NaqshbandÊ path he had inherited.These consisted of the khalwa arba#Êniyya, a concentrated seclusion ofConcl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM305"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"conclusion306forty days which allowed him to authorize with great speed depu-ties to spread his message; the r§biãa, a mystical binding to his im-age designed to centralize their activity under his leadership; and ghalqal-b§b, the closing of the door during the dhikr ceremony, which helpedhim to stress the uniqueness of his path.Despite the short duration of Shaykh Kh§lid’s work in Damascus,the Kh§lidiyya continued to spread in the city to the end of theOttoman period, and beyond till our own time. Nevertheless, itsorganizational evolution was characterized by a number of funda-mental tensions that determined its relationship with the succeed-ing trends of reform in Damascus, and the religious standing of itsheads in the city in general. The first tension was revealed alreadyin the weeks following Kh§lid’s death in consequence of the collapseof the succession arrangement he had devised. I depicted it in Naqsh-bandÊ terms as the tension between his two principal organizationalnovelties, the r§biãa and the khalwa. The deputies Kh§lid left behindfailed to preserve the unity of the order, which the spiritual bindingto the shaykh was designed to secure, tending instead to stress theirindependence by applying the concentrated seclusion to swiftly au-thorize numerous deputies of their own. Consequently, there devel-oped an increasing gap between the Kh§lidÊ ideal of a unified orderunder one leadership, and the reality in which it continued to spreadwithout a guiding hand. The fragmentation of the Kh§lidiyya wasexacerbated a year after Kh§lid’s death by the decision of SultanMaÈmåd II to turn against it, ordering the expulsion from Dam-ascus of all the deputies who accompanied the Shaykh from Iraq andKurdistan.MaÈmåd II’s decree of expulsion uncovered a second fundamentaltension which was inherent in the activity of Shaykh Kh§lid inDamascus, that between the endeavor of the order to strike rootsamong the local population, particularly the #ulama, and the foreign,mainly non-Arab, provenance of its shaykhs. Kh§lid refrained fromauthorizing deputies from among the inhabitants of Damascus dur-ing his period of activity there because he sought to preserve the cityas the organizational center of the Kh§lidiyya, which would not beidentified with any local elements. Seen in this light, the Sultan’s moveagainst the order was doubly harmful. On the one hand, it consid-erably weakened the ability of the Kh§lidÊs to continue leading therenewal movement initiated by Shaykh Kh§lid in Damascus itself,and, on the other hand, it prevented them from retaining the cityConcl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM306"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"conclusion307as the order’s general center of activity. The only deputy of Kh§lidto remain in Damascus after the expulsion decree was MuÈammadibn #Abdall§h al-Kh§nÊ, whom he had summoned from Hamah.Kh§nÊ regarded himself, by this merit, as the head of the entireKh§lidÊ sub-order, but as an outsider his position remained precar-ious even in Damascus itself. The Kh§lidÊs were permitted to returna few years later and fully renewed their activity in the city after theaccession of #AbdülmecÊd, but they could not restore to the Naqsh-bandiyya the vitality it had possessed under Kh§lid.The introduction of the reforms of the early Tanzimat period bySultan #AbdülmecÊd disclosed a third fundamental tension in the pathof Shaykh Kh§lid, this one concerning the attitude of the Kh§lidiyyatoward the Ottoman government. In Damascus, this tension furtherweakened the order by sowing dissention among its leaders. MuÈam-mad al-Kh§nÊ and his successors emphasized Kh§lid’s instruction tokeep distance from the rulers, regarding it as binding even when thelatter follow the shari#a. MaÈmåd al-‘§Èib, Kh§lid’s brother whosettled in the city under the patronage of the Sultan, by contrast,claimed that it is obligatory to serve such rulers in the name of theshari#a. This split between the heads of the Kh§lidiyya in Damascusdegenerated into open conflict during the \\amÊdian period, whenAs#ad al-‘§Èib was enlisted in the service of the autocratic regimeof #AbdülÈamÊd II and his Islamic policy in the name of the sameadherence to the shari#a. His reliance on the Ottoman governmentenabled ‘§Èib to assume a dominant position in the order in Dam-ascus at the expense of the Kh§nÊs. In his polemic against them heclaimed to head the Kh§lidiyya in general, but his very turn to therulers reflected an acknowledgement that its major characteristics,the organizational novelties of Shaykh Kh§lid, had lost their efficacy.Hence his readiness to compromise on the validity of these novel-ties, and ultimately to abandon them altogether. ‘§Èib’s subsequentharnessing to the service of the Young Turk regime, particularly ofthe stiff military rule imposed by the CUP on Syria during the FirstWorld War, led him to further forsake the distinctive orthodox pathof the Naqshbandiyya within the general framework of Sufism.The second trend of religious reform in late Ottoman Damascus,the Akbariyya, was a reinterpretation of Ibn #ArabÊ’s theosophy inresponse to the challenge posed by the West. It was conceived byAmir #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, the leader of the resistance move-ment to the French occupation of Algeria, who became an adher-Concl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM307"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"conclusion308ent of al-Shaykh al-Akbar during his captivity in France. At that timehe underwent an acute spiritual crisis, but also realized the achieve-ments of the rationalist approach that underlies modern Westerncivilization. Choosing Damascus as his residence after release, #Abdal-Q§dir headed there in the last part of his life, the years 1855-1883,an elect circle of disciples who engaged in studying the teaching ofIbn #ArabÊ under his guidance. Motivated, like Shaykh Kh§lid be-fore him, by a deep sense of mission, #Abd al-Q§dir’s experience nev-ertheless led him to conclude that the regression of the umma couldno longer be explained solely in terms of an internal decline of theMuslim world, but rather reflected the increasingly undeniable su-premacy of the West. His main interest shifted, accordingly, fromthe practical path of the ãarÊqa to the quest for the divine truth ofthe ÈaqÊqa. Ibn #ArabÊ’s system of thought, which #Abd al-Q§dir setout to adapt to the new realities of the time, was founded on a lit-eral interpretation by way of mystic experience (kashf) of the Qur\"anand the sunna. At the root of the reality thus revealed to him stoodthe doctrine of waÈdat al-wujåd, the unity of being, embodying arelationship of quasi-mutuality between God and His creatures. #Abdal-Q§dir differed from Ibn #ArabÊ in his experiential interpretationof this doctrine in three principal points—his interest in science, histolerant attitude toward Christians, and his overlooking the govern-ment’s Westernizing thrust. These supplied him with the basis forcriticizing the traditional mode of learning with its reliance on blindimitation, which he had come to regard as the cause of the regres-sion of Islam, and for adopting the Western rationalist approach toworldly affairs, as the key to its preservation in the modern world.The AkbarÊ teaching, as interpreted by #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ,found a strong echo among the reformist #ulama of Damascus whoin the previous generation had joined the NaqshbandÊ renewalmovement of Shaykh Kh§lid. It was also embraced by the leadersof the Algerian community, most of them belonging to theRaÈm§niyya order, who had immigrated to the city following thefinal defeat of the amir. The sons of the religious men of these twogroups constituted the core of #Abd al-Q§dir’s elect circle in lateTanzimat Damascus. Yet, as with the previous reformist trend, anumber of fundamental tensions gradually became apparent in thisteaching, most of them already in the last years of #Abd al-Q§dirhimself. One tension derived from the perennial problem of balancingConcl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM308"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"conclusion309the í§hirÊ aspect of the doctrine of waÈdat al-wujåd, which stressed itscompatibility with the precepts of the shari#a, and its b§ãinÊ aspect,which could be understood as superseding it. To offset the tendencyinherent in #Abd al-Q§dir’s teaching toward the internal inclusiveinterpretation of Ibn #ArabÊ’s legacy, the members of his inner circlewere always careful to follow him in emphasizing their strict adher-ence to the external commandments of the One Being. On the peri-phery of this circle, particularly within the framework of the Yash-ruãiyya order, however, there emerged a tendency to transgress thesecommandments out of the experience of being one with Him. Un-der the increasing pace of modernization of the \\amÊdian and YoungTurks periods, this tension in #Abd al-Q§dir’s AkbarÊ teaching grad-ually merged with an even more profound one, that between the sufimysticism with which his entire thought was permeated and the West-ern rationalism that he now advocated. First formulated two yearsafter the amir’s death in the writing of his young brother and heir,AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ, this second tension came subsequently to mark amajor dividing line between orthodox and reformists in Damascus.Thus the conservative adherents of the doctrine of waÈdat al-wujådwere inclined to defend Sufism to the exclusion of the rationalist thrustof the age; while for its more innovative adherents, who became in-creasingly convinced of the need to apply the rationalist mode ofthinking even to the religious sciences, Sufism was reduced to a prac-tical–moral system of worship.In view of the autocratic nature of #AbdülÈamÊd II and the YoungTurk regimes, however, the most critical tension inherent in the Ak-barÊ interpretation of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ proved to be, as hasbeen the case with the previous reform trend of the Naqshbandiyya-Kh§lidiyya, the question of the attitude to be taken toward thegovernment. Regarding the centralizing aspect of these regimes,during the \\amÊdian period #Abd al-Q§dir’s successors had to choosebetween full obedience to the Ottoman Sultan—Caliph and concen-tration in the local affairs of Syria. Again, some men of religion onthe margin of the amir’s circle, relying on the quietist political teach-ing of Ibn #ArabÊ and working through the Yashruãiyya and theDandar§wiyya orders, tended now to align themselves with the or-thodox in serving the Ottoman State. Among the foremost mem-bers of #Abd al-Q§dir’s circle, by contrast, there developed a senseof local distinctiveness, accompanied by a renewed interest in theConcl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM309"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"conclusion310history of Damascus and in the Arabic language and literature.It was resistance to the populist aspect of #AbdülÈamÊd II, and theYoung Turk, regimes that above all turned the reformist adherentsof Ibn #ArabÊ to the teaching of AÈmad ibn Taymiyya. Lacking aleader from outside, as was the case with its two predecessors, theSalafiyya, the third and last trend of religious reform in late Otto-man Damascus, was divided at its inception into two branches. Themore traditional one, which included the most faithful adherents of#Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, turned its attention under the leadershipof #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r and Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ to adaptingtraditional theology and jurisprudence to the new knowledge andneeds. The other branch, which comprised graduates of the firstgovernment schools in the city, also imbibed the Young Ottomanideas of freedom and love of the fatherland, and consequently ded-icated itself, under the guidance of •§hir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, to reconstruct-ing an Arab basis for their society. Both branches of the Salafiyyaadhered to Ibn Taymiyya’s ideal of a return to the way of the fore-fathers, al-salaf al-ß§liÈ, and to his extensive application of reason.Through these means they sought to defy the rigid adherence of theorthodox #ulama and sufi shaykhs to the latter-day tradition, whichmade them servile to the Westernizing state, on the one hand, andan impediment to the ability of Islam to adapt itself to the modernworld, on the other. Both branches of the Salafiyya coalesced at thebeginning of the twentieth century in the face of the increasing per-secution of the \\amÊdian regime, and even more so the strengthen-ing of the “nationalist” wing within the opposition movement whichwas soon to replace it, the Young Turks. Concomitantly, their localsense of patriotism was superseded by the national ideal of Arabism.In terms of the history of religious thought, the differences betweenthe teachings and paths of these three trends of religious reform inlate Ottoman Damascus can be epitomized in the three modes ofhuman cognition upon which the major approaches of every reli-gion are based—authority, sentiment, and reason. The Kh§lidiyya,the orthodox sufi order, stressed the legal and theological traditionof Islam, naql; the theosophical Akbariyya resorted to visions attainedthrough the mystical experience, kashf; for the Salafiyya, in its questto revive the spirit of the forefathers, the application of logical thinkingcame to the fore, #aql. Nevertheless, our analysis of the writings ofthe heads of these religious reform trends has plainly demonstratedConcl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM310"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"conclusion311that despite the differences they all shared a common ground. Allthree regarded themselves as a middle way, the way of the divineshari#a and the prophetic sunna, posed between the two extremesof those who deviate from it. Each one of them articulated this viewaccording to its basic epistemology. The Kh§lidiyya delineated itspath between the sufis who consider themselves above the shari#aand the #ulama who entirety reject Sufism. The Akbariyya set outagainst the rationalist #ulama who subject God to their abstract judg-ments and against the ecstatic sufis who see God in everything. TheSalafiyya rejected the orthodox men of religion, #ulama and sufis alike,who adhered to their traditions while ignoring modernization, as wellthe Westernizers who adopted modern rationalism to the point ofneglecting their religion. This common ground shows that, despitethe contradictions between them, the three trends of reform, eachaccording to its own system, perpetuated the Islamic tradition of com-bining #ilm and taßawwuf. From this combination they drew their veryreformism, and this was clearly reflected in the central place thateach one of them accorded to the teaching of Ghaz§lÊ.A measure of continuity in the course of these three reform trendsof late Ottoman Damascus was clearly discernible also from thesecond approach taken in this study, their social history. The lead-ing #ulama in each of the three trends belonged to consecutive gen-erations of a relatively small group of local families of religion whichwere founded at the beginning of the nineteenth century. I concen-trated in this study on five of them, the families of BÊã§r, Q§simÊ,ShaããÊ, #$bidÊn and Kh§nÊ. In the second half of the century thesewere joined by another group of religious families consisting of theleadership of the contemporary Algerian emigration to Damascus.Among the latter I focused on the two leading families, those ofJaz§\"irÊ and Mub§rak. In each trend of religious reform some mem-bers of these families distinguished themselves as the inner circle, buttheir colleagues in the larger group normally shared their views. Thusthe most faithful disciples of Shaykh Kh§lid in the Naqshbandiyyaorder and in his religious lessons were MuÈammad AmÊn #$bidÊnand \\asan al-BÊã§r, as well as MuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the elder, hislocal deputy. The sons of the latter two, #Abd al-Razz§q al-BÊã§r andMuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the younger, became in the next generationthe closest local disciples of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ in his AkbarÊcircle. Their most distinguished colleagues from among the Algeri-an exiles were his brother, AÈmad al-Jaz§\"irÊ, and MuÈammad al-Concl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM311"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"conclusion312Mub§rak. BÊã§r and Jaz§\"irÊ became in the following generation theleaders of the traditional wing of the SalafÊ trend. At their side stoodthe younger Jam§l al-DÊn al-Q§simÊ, in whom the evident continu-ity between the three trends of religious reform in Damascus maybe epitomized. Q§simÊ took the NaqshbandÊ–Kh§lidÊ path fromMuÈammad al-Kh§nÊ the younger, studied with him Ibn #ArabÊ’steaching according to the interpretation of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ,and preserved his appreciation of both despite turning to theSalafiyya. The leader of the more modern wing of this trend, •§hiral-Jaz§\"irÊ, received his initial religious education in the AkbarÊ cir-cle of #Abd al-Q§dir, as well.The continuous reformist tendency among these religious fami-lies of Damascus was determined by their basic attitude toward thetwo fundamental processes which combined in shaping the evolu-tion of Syria in their time, European economic penetration and Ot-toman state formation. Using the terminology of Albert Hourani’s“politics of notables”, I have argued that under this twofold impactof modernization their leaders were driven to dispense with main-taining a balance between access to political authority and a sepa-rate base in society, upon which the power of the urban elite for-merly relied. Members of the reformist religious families of Damascusshunned the new posts created by the expanding Ottoman admin-istration from the early 1840s, contenting themselves with theirpositions in the mosques and colleges of the city. To compensate fortheir loss of access to political authority they sought an alliance withthe incipient local Muslim middle class engaged in the new grainexport under European aegis. They became thereby part of a larg-er group of Damascene notables and men of religion, the local ten-dency, which constituted the wider circle of the religious reform trendin the city. The decline of international grain prices from the late1870s, and the consequent success of the state in accommodatingthis incipient middle class by incorporating its heads into a newlandowning—bureaucratic elite, was one reason for the turn of thereformist families to seeking support among the lower strata of so-ciety. It was an opposite reaction to these two fundamental factorsshaping the evolution of Syria that posed against them a rival fac-tion of men of religion, whose view was increasingly turned towardIstanbul. These #ulama, the Ottoman tendency, attained the high-est religious positions, as well as the new administrative posts creat-ed by the successive Ottoman regimes of reform, and thus becameConcl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM312"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"conclusion313more identified with the imperial point of view.The shift of the heads of the Damascene reformist #ulama fami-lies from one religious reform trend to another must be understoodagainst the backdrop of the frequent vicissitudes in the character anddirection of the Ottoman attempts at reform throughout the peri-od. The affiliation of the founders of these families with theKh§lidiyya reflected their distress in the face of the decline of Ot-toman central government and the consequent oppression by its lo-cal governors, in cooperation with local forces, on the eve of the in-troduction of the reforms. Many of them originated in the merchantestate, which was particularly hard hit by the general loss of secu-rity of life and property caused by these developments. For them,Shaykh Kh§lid’s call to strictly implement the shari#a was thus tan-tamount to demanding the rule of law against the arbitrary practic-es of the governors and their allies. Sultan #AbdülmecÊd sought tocomply with this demand in the reforms of the early Tanzimat pe-riod. The turn of the next generation of the reformist religious fam-ilies to the Akbariyya reflected their awareness of the need to adopt,in conjunction with the incipient middle class they allied themselveswith, Western ideals of progress and prosperity underlying the re-forms of the late Tanzimat. In #Abd al-Q§dir’s interpretation of Ibn#ArabÊ’s teaching they found an Islamic basis for recognizing the Eu-ropean supremacy, for integrating the rationalist approach with Islam,and for applying it to worldly affairs. The elaboration of the Salafiyyaby the third generation of these reformist #ulama families reflectedtheir revulsion at the centralizing and populist policies adopted bythe autocratic regimes of #AbdülÈamÊd II and the Young Turks.Through Ibn Taymiyya’s call to follow the example of the salaf,strengthened at times with the rationalist Modernism of MuÈammad#Abduh, they sought to reassert the role of reformist men of religionin guiding the Ottoman State on the course of modernization ingeneral, and in conducting the local affairs of Syria in particular.Frustrated by these regimes, they turned to stress the ethnic identi-ty of the salaf in an effort to appeal directly to the masses, therebyaccording religious legitimation to the new ideology of Arabism.To fully understand the dynamics of continuity and change amongthese three religious reform trends in late Ottoman Damascus, how-ever, we cannot be content with the examination of the objectiveconsequences of the reform efforts undertaken by the central gov-ernment, or of the effect of the European economic penetration uponConcl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM313"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"conclusion314the city. We must also see them from the subjective viewpoint of theproponents of these trends, which was neither socio-economic norpolitical, but first and foremost Islamic. Thus, in the eyes of thefounders of these reformist religious families at the beginning of thenineteenth century, the prevailing insecurity in their province resultedfrom the deviation of the umma from the path of the shari#a. Theirenrollment in the ranks of the Damascene #ulama constituted a protestagainst the leading contemporary jurists of the day, who let thescience entrusted to them stagnate and consequently failed to fulfilltheir vocation of making the judgments required by changing cir-cumstances and influencing the rulers to implement them. Hencetheir enthusiastic response to the call of Shaykh Kh§lid, who withinthe activist framework of the Naqshbandiyya strove to return theumma, through its rulers, to the path of the shari#a. The Kh§lidiyyashould thus be viewed as a movement of religious renewal in the tra-ditional orthodox meaning of the term—tajdÊd.The turning of the next generation of these families to the Ak-bariyya was rooted in the implications of the early Tanzimat reforms.It reflected their disappointment with the upper strata of #ulama,which had exploited its domination of the city under the aegis ofthe reforming Ottoman government to divert its efforts to implementthe orthodox principles propagated by the Naqshbandiyya in favorof the personal interests of its members. Hence derived their affili-ation with the circle of #Abd al-Q§dir al-Jaz§\"irÊ, who in his inter-pretation of Ibn #ArabÊ’s theosophy gave expression to their feelingthat the conduct of the traditional #ulama had become the primaryfactor in the decline of Islam. Consequently, they were prepared toselectively adopt the rationalist approach, which he depicted as thefoundation of European scientific and political supremacy. The re-formist #ulama of Damascus reached the apex of their power dur-ing the late Tanzimat period, when the central government turnedagainst their rivals who obstructed the realization of its Western-inspired reforms. The Akbariyya thus constituted an interim stagein the religious reform tendency in Damascus. In its ideas it tookthe first steps toward modern religious thought, but in its method itremained anchored within the framework of the sufi aspect of tra-ditional orthodoxy.The emergence of the Salafiyya among the last generation of thereformist families of Ottoman Damascus derived from their indig-nation at the rise to religious preeminence in the city of popular#ulama and sufi shaykhs whose merit lay more in their readiness toConcl.p659/19/00, 12:58 PM314"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"conclusion315harness orthodoxy to the service of the rulers than in erudition orpiety. This alliance between the State and popular Islam was thesecond, and more fundamental, cause that led the SalafÊs to exceedthe bounds of the “politics of notables” and appeal directly to themasses. In their eyes, the orthodox men of religion had turned Is-lam into a means of satisfying their desire for posts and decorationsthrough the patronage of the government. Hence came the reform-ist #ulama’s adoption of the teachings of Ibn Taymiyya, whose callto return to the ideal of the forefathers, al-salaf al-ß§liÈ, gave themthe leverage to amend the late orthodox tradition, both legal andmystic, that had become so distorted in their eyes, and to reestab-lish the supremacy of religion over the state in Islam. By combiningthe quest to unite the umma on the basis of the Qur\"an and the sunnawith the wide application of reason in their interpretation to suit con-temporary needs, the Salafiyya became the first religious reform trendthat may be regarded as modern. The fundamental principle whichepitomized its new approach was ijtih§d.The foundations of modern Islam in the Arab world thus lie inthe late Ottoman period. Impressed by the achievements of West-ern rationalism, Islamic modernizers have ever since been given toa deepening critique of traditional learning and particularly of mys-ticism. Concerned by the inability of the indigenous bourgeoisie tochallenge the autocratic tendencies of the state, they have concomi-tantly been seeking after effective checks on its Westernizing thrust.In both endeavors the original SalafÊs could draw upon the reform-ist tradition of Islam, which consisted of a vigorous combination of#ilm and taßawwuf, as well as an activist approach toward political andsocial affairs. Late Ottoman Damascus, which attracted two outstand-ing examples of this pre-modern reformist tradition, the Naqsh-bandiyya-Kh§lidiyya and the Akbariyya, accordingly played a sem-inal role in the formulation and dissemination of the SalafÊ ideas.The locus of a particularly vigorous “politics of notables”, its reformistmen of religion were best qualified to articulate the dissatisfactionof civil society with the increasing pressure of the Ottoman State.This contest over the course of modernization precipitated the en-trance of the masses into the public arena, and with it the rise ofthe ideology of Arabism. Unlike the West, however, where the masseshave gradually come to dominate society, in the Muslim world theyhave remained subordinate to political and religious elites.
