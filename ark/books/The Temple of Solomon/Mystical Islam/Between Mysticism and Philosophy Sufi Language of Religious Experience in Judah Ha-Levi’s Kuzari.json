The Genesis of the Kuzariand Its Frame StoryTwelfth-century Spain was alive with spiritual possibilities. A new lan-guage of religious experience was taking hold in medieval Islam; philos-ophers and Sufi mystics, legal scholars, theologians, and poets allsought to capture the experiential dimension of religious life and werereinventing Islamic vocabulary to do so. Each of these groups was en-gaged in appropriating and redefining a common set of terms for relig-ious experience.Despite their intersecting discourses and vocabulary, these commu-nities of scholars were not necessarily talking with one another. It wasonly the rare polymath, fluent in each of these cultural dialects, whocould engage the disparate voices in a common conversation. Weavingthese worlds together required a scholar equally conversant in philoso-phy, law, poetry, theology, and mysticism, one whose talents and sen-sibility enabled him to perceive common threads and forge innovativeconnections.Interestingly enough, the person in twelfth-century Spain who wasable to do this was not himself a Muslim, but a Jew. R. Judah Ha-Levi(1075– 1141) was one of the foremost medieval Hebrew poets, a reveredfigure among a circle of Spanish intellectuals, who at the end of his daysshocked his contemporaries by abandoning life in Spain and setting sailfor the land of Israel. Ha-Levi is renowned not only as a poet, but as theauthor of an influential philosophical dialogue, a work written in Arabicbut popularly known by its Hebrew title, Sefer ha-Kuzari(The Book ofthe Khazar).1In the Kuzari, Ha-Levi adapts and transforms this new language ofinner experience to fit the Jewish context; he presents classical Judaismusing the new experiential language emerging in medieval Islam. Ha-Levi thus describes unique Jewish experiences with vocabulary from the1"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"wider Islamic culture, using language which would capture the imagina-tion of his contemporaries. At the same time he forges a broad culturalcritique, weaving together layers of discourse with the artistry of a lau-reate poet and polymath. Ha-Levi’s achievement in bringing togetherthese conversations was not merely an exercise in erudition, but an actof creative imagination.From a letter written by Ha-Levi to his friend ÓHalfon b. Netanel andfound in the Cairo Genizah, we learn that Ha-Levi began his dialogue inresponse to questions from a Karaite in Christian Spain.2The Karaites—a sectarian group of Jews who emerged some time during the eighth cen-tury as opponents of rabbinic oral law—were a living presence intwelfth-century Spain, and Ha-Levi’s work began in conversation with aKaraite.3The work as it stands today, however, is much wider in scope, as isreflected in Ha-Levi’s full description of his work: The Book of Refuta-tion and Proof in Defence of the Despised Religion.4Written in the formof a fictional dialogue between a Khazar king and a philosopher, aChristian, a Muslim, and a Jew, the completed work is a broad-baseddefense of Judaism as the revealed religion par excellence; the principleadversary of the work is no longer the Karaite but the Aristotelian phi-losopher. The Kuzariwas composed over some twenty years and com-pleted shortly before Ha-Levi’s departure for the land of Israel in 1040,an event taken by the Jewish intelligentsia of Muslim Spain as a devas-tating rejection of their ideals and way of life.5Surrounding the dialogue is a frame story based on a real tenth-century correspondence between the Jewish courtier ÓHasdai Ibn Sha-prut—principal minister to ¡Abd al-Ra Óhm ̄an III, the Caliph of Cordova(912– 961)—and Joseph, the king of the Khazars.6The Khazars were acentral Asian tribe who converted to Judaism some time during theeighth century. Joseph’s letter tells the story of that conversion. A certainKhazar king, Bulan, had a dream in which an angel appeared to himwho praised him for his works and promised him blessings if he wouldobserve God’s statutes. The king and his people immediately accept di-vine rule, but are subsequently approached for conversion by Muslimsand Christians. Bulan therefore invites representatives of the monotheis-tic faiths to discuss their doctrines. Not only the testimony of the Jews,but that of the Muslims and Christians as well, convinces him that Juda-ism is the best and truest faith.Ha-Levi uses this historical account as the setting for a dialoguebetween the pagan Khazar king and representatives of various faiths.However Ha-Levi adapts this story for his own purposes. Whereas in2Introduction"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Joseph’s telling King Bulan is informed that his works are pleasing toGod, Ha-Levi’s King is told that although his intentions are pleasing toGod, his behavior7is not. Ha-Levi’s King thus sets out in search of thereligion whose way of action is itself pleasing to God. A key theme inthe Kuzarias a whole is the importance of action for drawing near tothe Divine.According to the letter of Joseph, the Khazars convert to Judaismbefore a religious debate takes place. Ha-Levi, in contrast, first engageshis King in a dialogue with four interlocutors—a philosopher, a Chris-tian, a Muslim, and a Jew. Only through this conversation does the Kingbecome convinced of the truth of Judaism and accept upon himself theyoke of the commandments, taking the Jewish scholar (theÓHaver) as histutor.8Ha-Levi’s dialogue thus sets out not only to prove which of thevarious monotheistic religions is the most worthy, the focus of the de-bate according to Joseph’s account, but also to demonstrate the necessityand validity of revealed religion per se. Against philosophy’s claim topossess truth through pure reason, the Kuzarisets forth a vigorous argu-ment for the necessity of divine revelation, an argument that becomesthe foundation stone of his defense of the despised faith.2. Ha-Levi’s Arabic Terminology for Religious ExperienceIn the history of Jewish philosophy, Ha-Levi stands out as a particularistthinker; he stresses the uniqueness of the Hebrew language, the Jewishnation, and the land of Israel. Whereas Maimonides opens his code ofJewish law by appealing to the universal God of creation, the FirstCause of all existence, Ha-Levi’sÓHavergrounds Judaism in the uniquehistory of the Jewish people. His God is not the God of the philosophers,but the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.Surprisingly, this most particularist of Jewish treatises is written notin Hebrew, but in Arabic—more precisely, Judaeo-Arabic, Arabic writ-ten in Hebrew letters. Ha-Levi composed the Kuzarifor the Jewish intel-ligentsia of twelfth-century Spain, educated in both Hebrew and Arabic.Like the student for whom Maimonides wrote his Guide of the Per-plexed, Ha-Levi’s intended reader is the philosophically educated Jew,tempted by the spiritual cornucopia of the medieval Islamic world. Thetemptations of that milieu included not only philosophy, Karaism,Christianity, and mainstream Islam, but also Islamic mysticism. The Sufimovement had arisen prior to the eighth century in the East, but wastransplanted throughout the medieval Islamic world and flowered inMuslim Spain in the tenth century.9Sufi mysticism was thus known toIntroduction3"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Jews in Spain not only through the text, but through its living embodi-ment, practicing Sufis in their midst, offering the promise of real relig-ious experience.10Our most striking testimony that Jews were reading Sufi texts isBa Óhya ibn Paq ̄uda’s celebrated spiritual manual The Book of Guidanceto the Duties of the Heart(Kit ̄ab al-hid ̄aya ¡il ̄a far ̄a¡iÓ d al-qul ̄ub; ToratÓhovot ha-levavot). While there has been much debate about the preciseIslamic sources of Ba Óhya’s work, it is clearly modeled on Sufi devotionalmanuals. We see this vividly in the structure of the book itself: the readeris led through ten gates, each representing a quality to be embodied inthe soul’s journey toward love for God.11Among possible Sufi influences on Ba Óhya are the writings of theearly Sufi teacher al-MuÓh ̄asib ̄ı, whose works were eagerly copied andstudied in eleventh-century Spain.12In fact, in the Cairo Genizah we findSufi texts copied in Hebrew letters for the benefit of Jewish readers.These include mystical poems of the Sufi martyr al- ÓHall ̄aj, the finalchapters of Avicenna’s Book of Directives and Remarks(Kit ̄ab al-ishar ̄atwa-l-tanbih ̄at), which investigate the path of the Sufis; and the writingsof al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, especially his spiritual autobiography, Deliverer fromError (al-Munqidh min-al- Ódal ̄al), in which he recounts his embrace ofthe Sufi way. The intimacy of this Jewish-Sufi nexus is seen vividly in alate Genizah text that weaves together rabbinic and Sufi terminology forstages on the spiritual path.13It is thus clear that Ha-Levi would have had access to Sufi texts andideas. He responds to the Sufis only indirectly, however. Ha-Levi doesnot mention the Sufis by name, but makes extensive use of Sufi terminol-ogy, appropriating and refashioning it to show his Jewish audience thatthe spiritual fruits promised by Sufism exist foremost within the livingJewish tradition. Our study will show that images and vocabulary fromIslamic mysticism form a prominent subtext to the Kuzari. The Sufi is abackground figure, an absent speaker whose presence we feel through-out the dialogue.Like Sufi-influenced Islamic thinkers such as Avicenna and al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, Ha-Levi asserts that sensory experience, direct and irrefutable,is more reliable than logic. Ha-Levi also appropriates both Sufi and phil-osophical terms for union to describe the Jewish relationship with God.Formerly these terms depicted an individual, isolated, disembodiedquest for union with the Divine. In Ha-Levi’s usage they describe a con-crete, mutual, covenantal relationship, both individual and communal.Using Sufi language of passionate love and service, Ha-Levi depictsAbraham as the ultimate knower, lover, and servant of God.4Introduction"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"A thorough study of Ha-Levi within his Islamic cultural context willthus shed new light on the Kuzari. In these pages, we will explore a par-adox: that this apparently inner-directed book, written exclusively formembers of the Jewish community, was in fact in active dialogue withcontemporary currents in the Islamic world. Ha-Levi wrote in a chargedclimate of debates among Jews and Muslims on the varieties of religiousexperience, and amidst the promises of competing schools of law, phi-losophy, and mysticism. These debates form a crucial backdrop to Ha-Levi’s religious project: to show his contemporaries that the spiritualpromises of medieval Islamic culture are truly fulfilled at home in theclassical Jewish tradition.My focus in this study will be the way Ha-Levi uses and transformsArabic terminology to present his unique view of Jewish religious expe-rience. Because he is writing in Arabic, Ha-Levi is forced to use certainIslamic religious terms. As a Judaeo-Arabic writer, however, he also hasthe choice to introduce Hebrew terms and phrases. It is thus fruitful toask why he chooses the Arabic terms he does, to investigate the Islamiccontext of these terms, and to analyze the way he builds upon or sub-verts their contextual meaning. We will discover that Ha-Levi Judaizeshis Islamic terms, transforming them in the process. Nevertheless theirorigins in Islamic mysticism and Neo-Platonism would have a powerfulimpact on his educated reader, as he undoubtedly intended.Various groups in the Islamic sphere—philosophers, theologians,Sufi mystics, legal scholars—were each laying claim to a common set ofArabic terms for religious experience. In the following chapters, I willshow how Ha-Levi adapts and transforms these Arabic terms in an orig-inal way to reflect his unique view of religious experience, which he con-ceptualizes through language of relationship, human striving, sense per-ception, prophecy, and love. We will explore several groups of terms,some joined conceptually, others clustered around Arabic roots. Thesegroups of terms are:1. The Language of Relationship: Connection and Arrival: w-Ós-l: ittiÓs ̄al, wa Ósala, wuÓs ̄ul2. The Language of Human Striving: qiy ̄as, ijtiÓh ̄ad, taql ̄ıd,istidl ̄al3.

The Language of Longing, Intimacy, and Love: shawq, uns,¡ishq.Our discussion will not be purely terminological, however. As HarryWolfson noted, concepts ride on the back of terms.14In the course of ouranalysis we will find that Ha-Levi tackles major issues in the history ofJewish philosophy, including the nature of prophecy and revelation, thepurpose of divine commandments, the problem of suffering in Jewishhistory, the role of asceticism in religious life, and the value of rational-izing the faith. While focusing on Ha-Levi’s conception of the nature ofreligious experience, our exploration of his terminology will shed lighton these related issues in the history of philosophy as well.3. A Brief Review of Scholarship on the KuzariIn the modern period there have been two major approaches taken toHa-Levi’s Kuzari: a philological approach, which traces the Arabic andHebrew sources of Ha-Levi’s terms and doctrines and explores theirphilosophical significance; and a literary approach, which investigatesthe dialogue as a carefully constructed work of religious literature. Thisstudy will unite these interpretive pathways. An overview of scholarshipon the Kuzariwill therefore set the stage for our analysis.The Kuzariwas translated from Arabic into Hebrew soon after Ha-Levi’s lifetime. With the awakening of interest in philosophy in Chris-tian Europe in the late twelfth century, Jews living in Christian landsneeded the Judaeo-Arabic classics translated into a language they couldunderstand. Judah Ibn Tibbon translated the Kuzariin 1167; thereafterit was read, commented upon, and quoted in Hebrew translation, oftenwithout reference to the Islamic context in which it was born. Ha-Leviwas embraced as a foil to Aristotelian rationalism, which prevailed inJewish thought from the twelfth century on through the towering influ-ence of Maimonides. The Kuzariasserted great influence throughoutJewish history. In periodic revivals, it was hailed for bringing out the dis-tinctiveness and particularity of Judaism.15The Islamic background of the Kuzariwas rediscovered by the his-toricizing Wissenschaftmovement in the nineteenth century. DavidKaufmann first drew attention to the Islamic context of Ha-Levi’s workand to significant parallels between Ha-Levi’s ideas and those of Ab ̄uÓH ̄amid al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı (1058 – 1111), who is well known for challenging thesovereignty of Aristotelian philosophy in the medieval Islamic world.His Refutation of the Philosophers(Tah ̄afut al-fal ̄asifa) is a carefully6Introduction"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"structured exposition and critique of the thought of Ibn S ̄ın ̄ a (Avicenna)(980 – 1037), a leading Aristotelian. Like al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, Ha-Levi chal-lenges some of the main tenets of Aristotelian philosophy, particularlyits claims to certainty in metaphysical matters.16The parallels go further. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı is also responsible for bringingSufi mysticism into the mainstream of Islamic thought, particularlythrough his elegant synthesis, the Revival of the Religious Sciences(IÓhy ̄ a™ ¡ul ̄um al-d ̄ın). Even in his popular spiritual autobiography TheDeliverer from Error(al-Munqidh min al- Ódal ̄al), Ghazz ̄al ̄ı is not reticentabout his mystical convictions; he asserts unequivocally that prophetsand mystics possess an inner eye which sees what human reason cannot.For Ghazz ̄al ̄ı a key function of the intellect is to expose reason’s limita-tions and to deliver human beings safely to the guidance of the prophets,who see by the light of Truth.17Kaufmann noted that Ha-Levi, too, speaks of the inner eye ofprophecy. While acknowledging the vital role of reason to a point, Ha-Levi shares with Ghazz ̄al ̄ı a pietism which points out the limits of rea-son. In the opinion of many later scholars, beginning with David Neu-mark, Kaufmann overstated Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s influence on Ha-Levi; heviewed the Kuzarias essentially a translation of Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s ideas into aJewish framework. Nevertheless Kaufmann’s achievement in bringingthe Islamic context of Ha-Levi’s thought to the fore should not beunderestimated.18Ignaz Goldziher followed Kaufmann’s lead in his 1905 essay on theIslamic context of a key term in the Kuzari—the ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ı,literally, thedivine thing, order, or command. According to most recent scholars,Goldziher erred in his conclusion that Ha-Levi’s ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ıwas the firstin a series of hypostasized emanations, akin to the role of the LogosinNeo-Platonic and Christian thought. I will argue that scholars continueto reify the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıfar beyond what Ha-Levi intended. Neverthelessfrom a historical perspective, Goldziher played an important role in lo-cating Ha-Levi squarely in the world of Islamic mysticism and Neo-Platonism.19Julius Guttmann in 1922, and subsequently David Baneth in muchgreater detail in 1924, presented a more nuanced picture of Ha-Levi’s re-lationship to Ghazz ̄al ̄ı and to the Islamic intellectual world. Baneth iscareful to point out significant differences between Ghazz ̄al ̄ı and Ha-Levi. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı embraces Sufi asceticism and withdrawal; his doctrine isuniversalistic, and stresses a quietistic, individual communion with theDivine. Ha-Levi, in contrast, is particularist, and celebrates the this-worldly, communal, and active character of Jewish life.20Introduction7"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Israel Efros in 1941 and Harry Wolfson in 1942 added importantnuances to our understanding of the Islamic sources of Ha-Levi’sthought. Efros noted that in place of the philosophic goal of union withthe Active Intellect, Ha-Levi introduces a religious goal of union withthe ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı, which Efros took to be the divine essence itself. He com-mented that Ha-Levi describes the aim of religious life in precise termsdrawn from the sphere of Islamic mysticism.Efros observed, moreover, that in his use of Sufi terminology, Ha-Levi actually goes beyond Ghazz ̄al ̄ı. While Ghazz ̄al ̄ı rejects use of theterm wuÓs ̄ul(union or arrival) as theologically inconsistent with theunique oneness of God, Ha-Levi makes liberal use of the term ittiÓs ̄al(union, connection, or conjunction), which is etymologically related.Efros noted, too, that Ha-Levi rejects the intellectual way of knowingGod through logical reasoning (qiy ̄as), and extolls the way of direct ex-perience, which he describes in Sufi terms as taste (dhawq), witness(mush ̄ahada), and mystical vision (b a Ós ̄ı r a, baÓsar, ¡iy ̄ an). While my anal-ysis will show that Ha-Levi’s use of terminology is more fluid than Efrosrealized, his work was nevertheless an important groundwork for thisstudy.21Harry Wolfson in his 1942 essay “Hallevi and Maimonides onProphecy” continued along this path, tracing the sources of Ha-Levi’sArabic terms and concepts to shed light on his theory of prophecy. Re-jecting the conclusions of Goldziher, Wolfson maintained that the term™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ıis used in the Kuzariin at least nine different ways. In addi-tion, he traced the history of several Jewish terms Ha-Levi uses in con-nection with prophecy (Holy Spirit, divine light, Glory of God, kingdomof God, and Shekhinah), finding key sources of Ha-Levi’s thought in Ar-abic Neo-Platonism. In his Repercussions of the Kal ̄am in Jewish Philos-ophy, Wolfson also traced the Islamic and Jewish roots of Ha-Levi’sunderstanding of the word of God.22Later in this century, scholars turned to Ha-Levi’s literary crafts-manship. Leo Strauss, Isaak Heinemann, and Eliezer Schweid drew at-tention to the careful structure of the Kuzari. Schweid’s incisive literaryanalysis shed light on the Kuzari’s philosophical artistry, while Heine-mann also revealed the philosophical dimension to Ha-Levi’s poetry.23Herbert Davidson continued the path of philosophical analysis. LikeEfros and Wolfson, Davidson situated Ha-Levi’s doctrines squarely intheir Islamic philosophical context, analyzing in masterful detail Ha-Levi’s understanding of the Active Intellect, causality, and the complexconcept of the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı, which Davidson identified with direct divinecausality.248Introduction"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"In 1980 Pines published his groundbreaking article, which uncov-ered roots of Ha-Levi’s thought and key terms in a series of Ism ̄a¡ ̄ ıl ̄ıtexts. In these texts, Pines found the sources of the term ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıand ofthe doctrine of the Ósafwa, a chosen elite, whose prophethood is con-ferred by the divine ™a m r. Pines also suggested a historical developmentto Ha-Levi’s thought. Earlier scholars were already aware that BookFive, section 12 of the Kuzaricontained an early treatise of Avicenna;Pines postulated that the work of Avicenna became known to Ha-Levibetween the time he composed Book One and Book Five. He conjec-tured that Ha-Levi was very impressed with the work of Avicenna, andmay have tried to rework his own ideas and terminology in the light ofAvicenna’s system.25The publication of the critical Baneth-Ben Shammai edition of theKuzariin 1977 was itself a major breakthrough in scholarship, as wasthe discovery and analysis of autographs and letters of Ha-Levi from theCairo Genizah. Goitein and Baneth used this significant material to piecetogether a biography of Ha-Levi and a sketch of the genesis of the Ku-zari, tracing the book’s origins to an exchange with a Karaite fromChristian Spain.26Yochanan Silman arrived at a somewhat different model of thegenesis of the Kuzari. Based on the historical evidence of the Genizahdocuments, Silman agreed with Goitein and Schweid that Book Threewas composed prior to the rest of the work. However Silman tookthis chronological framework one step further, using it to speculateon the development of Ha-Levi’s thought. Silman suggested that Ha-Levi’s ideas developed dialectically, responding to tensions inherentin each stage of their evolution. While my analysis diverges from thatof Silman,27I will call attention to some of his interesting exegeticalpoints.Daniel Lasker not only traced the origins of the Kuzarito a conver-sation with Karaites, but also brought to light the major influence of Ka-raism on Ha-Levi’s thought. Lasker highlighted Ha-Levi’s use of legalterminology from the Islamic and Karaite spheres, including the termsqiy ̄as, ijtiÓh ̄ad,and taql ̄ıd. His work has been groundbreaking andpivotal for my study.284. The Literary-Philological Approach of This StudyThe last several decades have thus produced significant breakthroughs inour understanding of the Kuzariin its cultural context. However, whilewe have been shown the literary genius of the Kuzari, and have learnedIntroduction9"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"the sources of specific terms and doctrines, these two paths of investiga-tion have not been brought together.It is crucial that these two approaches converge, as each methodtaken on its own is insufficient for study of the Kuzari. Ha-Levi, even inhis philosophical writing, is ultimately a poet; he is both deeply learnedand genuinely creative. Because he is well versed in philosophicalsources, one must be aware of the meanings of the terms he uses in theirhistorical setting. A literary analysis alone can misrepresent the sense ofa passage, if one is ignorant of the technical meaning of Ha-Levi’s termi-nology; one must be aware of what these terms would connote to Ha-Levi’s learned audience.However, philology alone is insufficient; one cannot understand thewords of a poet by consulting a dictionary. As a philosophical poet, Ha-Levi uses words in radically new ways. To understand the genius of theKuzari, one must be sensitive to Ha-Levi’s creative transformation of vo-cabulary and the ways his terms function in their literary context.This study will therefore engage in a literary-philological approach,a global analysis of Ha-Levi’s Arabic terminology in its literary setting.My analysis will show that Ha-Levi not only creatively reshapes Islamicterms, but constructs his argument through sophisticated rhetoricalstrategies, which daringly cross boundaries between particular termsand disciplines. The two methodological paths will thus illumine one an-other. Philology is incomplete without literary analysis; literary analysisis incomplete without philology. Philological analysis will bring to lightHa-Levi’s creative use of terminology; awareness of his reinvention ofterminology will reveal the literary twists that shape his argument.5. The Argument of the KuzariThe Kuzariconsists of five Books. Book One describes a dialoguebetween a pagan king and a philosopher, a Christian, a Muslim, and aJew. The King is on a spiritual quest for the correct way to serve God.Finding the answers of the philosopher, Christian, and Muslim inade-quate, he engages in an extensive dialogue with the Jew, who bases theclaims of Judaism not on universal philosophical grounds, but on Jew-ish religious experience and the events of Jewish history. The King iswon over early in the debate; in Book Two he and his people convertto Judaism and he takes the Jewish sage (theÓHaver) as his tutor. TheÓHaverteaches him the true meaning of divine names and attributes,the uniqueness of the Hebrew language and the centrality of the landof Israel.10Introduction"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"In Book Three, theÓHaverpresents the life of the ideal Jew in dis-tinctly anti-ascetic terms. He then launches a polemic against the Ka-raites, defending rabbinic tradition as the foundation of Jewish life.Book Four explores the philosophical significance of the divine namesand the centrality of prophecy and religious experience. Finally, in BookFive, theÓHaverexplains and critiques Aristotelian philosophy andsystematic theology (kal ̄am). He closes by presenting his own views, cul-minating in his decision to leave Khazaria for the land of Israel.Why does Ha-Levi choose the conversion story of the Khazar kingas a setting for his defense of Judaism? As Leo Strauss and EliezerSchweid have pointed out, the pagan king is a disinterested party, an ad-herent of none of the three monotheistic faiths. In fact, the King appearssomewhat antagonistic to the Jewish nation. What greater testimonycould be given to the truth of the Jewish faith than this: that such a criticchooses to join the Jewish people, knowing that his status as a convertwill never equal that of someone born Jewish.Ha-Levi appoints as religion’s judge not the learned philosopher,but the pious person of common sense. He thus dethrones philosophyfrom its self-proclaimed position as universal arbiter of truth. TheKing’s encounter with the philosopher sensitizes and sharpens his per-spective, but it is ultimately the common sense of the Jewish sage thatwins his allegiance.29Leo Strauss emphasized the disjunction between Ha-Levi as authorand his chief spokesperson, theÓHaver. In the dialogue’s opening re-marks, the narrator asserts that he finds some of the scholar’s argumentsconvincing. This suggests to Strauss that some of theÓHaver’s argumentsare not convincing to Ha-Levi; the author and theÓHavercannot simplybe conflated. In fact, Strauss took this dis-identification as the key to thedialogue. In Strauss’s view, the law of reason is the ultimate bearer oftruth, but this is not a truth to which the person of faith can adhere. Forthis reason, the philosopher and theÓHavernever speak to one another di-rectly; theÓHaverwould be no match for the philosopher. However,while theÓHaver’s arguments cannot be accepted by a true philosopher,they can be accepted by the genuine person of faith. Strauss portrayedHa-Levi as valiantly defending religion—necessary to the moral order ofsociety—against the more powerful and dangerous truth of philosophy,which must be hidden from the masses.30I will certainly not follow Strauss’s esoteric reading to this degree.Nevertheless, the distinction between Ha-Levi and theÓHaveris instruc-tive. Ha-Levi’s views unfold dialectically through interchange betweenhis characters; we cannot identify Ha-Levi’s position with that of oneIntroduction11"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"speaker in the dialogue. TheÓHaveris not simply the mouthpiece for Ha-Levi; the Kuzari’s craftsmanship is more subtle and complex.Ha-Levi shows the King gradually convinced by the arguments oftheÓHaver. As in the dialogues of Plato, what emerges is not so much ob-jective truth, as the awakening of understanding on the part of a uniquehuman being.31Ha-Levi’s truth thus issues from the dialogue as a whole,not simply from the mouth of the Haver. In this study, therefore, I willidentify the views of theÓHaveras such, and will attribute to Ha-Levi theperspective that emerges from the dialogue as a complete work. This willinclude nuances of terminology, rhetorical strategies, and the argumentas it unfolds through discussion between characters.A few words should also be devoted at this point to Silman’s devel-opmental approach. Perhaps Silman’s most interesting thesis is that inhis earlier thought, Ha-Levi had not yet come to make a radical distinc-tion between the two names of God: Elohim, representing the universalGod known by the human intellect, and the Tetragrammaton, represent-ing the God known through prophetic experience.This thesis is central to Silman’s developmental model. Silman arguesthat whereas in his early thought Ha-Levi conceives of God as essen-tially intellect, and thus knowable by human beings, in his late thoughthe conceives of God as radically transcendent and unknowable, reachedonly by means of intermediaries. However, 111:17 (which he ascribes tothe early period) and IV:3 (which he sees as the late Ha-Levi) describethe paradox of God’s transcendence and immanence in almost identicallanguage.32When discussing 111:17, Silman asserts that Ha-Levi’s juxtapositionof the two aspects of God—transcendence and immanence—signifiesthat he sees them as complementary. When discussing IV:3, however, hesuggests that the juxtaposition points to a radical disjunction betweenthe transcendent God and the God known in experience. I would arguethat Ha-Levi is consistent: in both passages, he describes in nearly iden-tical language the paradox of God’s transcendence and yet absolutenearness to humanity.33Therefore there is no reason to ascribe the twopassages to different periods, or to deduce from them an evolution in histhought.346. The Argument of the Kuzari: Part TwoBefore turning to my analysis, a more complete summary of the argu-ment of the Kuzarimay be in order. As historians of ideas, we often readworks of medieval philosophy in parts, thereby losing a sense of the12Introduction"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"whole. Readers new to the Kuzarimay find the following summary ofthe dialogue particularly useful, while readers familiar with the Kuzarimay wish to proceed directly to Part One.35Book OneBook One opens with a brief account by an anonymous narrator, whoexplains how the book came to be. The narrator explains that he wasasked to bring forth arguments defending Judaism against the attacks ofphilosophers, sectarians (Karaites) and members of other religions. Thisrequest brought to mind the story of the king of the Khazars who con-verted to Judaism under the tutelage of a Jewish scholar (ÓHaver). Find-ing many of the arguments of theÓHaverconvincing and in harmonywith his own views, the narrator decided to write them down, presum-ably as persuasive arguments in defense of the despised religion. The au-thor then winks at his audience, acknowledging an element of fiction inboth the frame story and his own remarks, noting that “the wise willunderstand.”36At this point, the narrator’s voice for the most part disappears, andwe are left with the interlocutors. Told by an angel in his dream that hisintentions are pleasing to God but not his way of action, the King firstturns to a philosopher, a character not appearing in the historicalrecords, but invented by Ha-Levi. The philosopher offers a standardmedieval philosophical account of the origins of the universe: he de-scribes a chain of strictly determined cause and effect, which emanateseternally from a First Cause.The First Cause is not a personal Creator, does not know individualsand cannot hear their prayers. The goal of human life is to purify oneselfin order to become like the Active Intellect, a spiritual emanation fromthe First Cause which governs our sublunar world. As a means to thatgoal, one may follow any one of the rational religions, or invent a relig-ion of one’s own (I:1).The King rejects this account, for the philosopher does not discrimi-nate between various modes of action, while a specific way of servingGod is precisely what he seeks. He is equally dissatisfied with the ac-counts of the Christian and Muslim, which as an outsider he finds inac-cessible. However, he notices that both Christianity and Islam arefounded on the accounts of the children of Israel. He therefore resolvesto speak to a Jew, although he had once dismissed the Jews as downtrod-den and of unpleasant disposition (I:2– 10, 12).The Jew does not begin his account with the universal God of crea-Introduction13"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"tion as did the philosopher, Christian, and Muslim. Rather, he beginswith the God of history, who led the Israelites out of Egypt with signsand wonders, who revealed the law through Moses, and sent subsequentprophets to confirm that law. TheÓHaverobserves that in addressing thepeople of Israel, God did not say, “I am the Creator of the world andyour Creator,” but rather, “I am the God whom you worship, whobrought you out of the land of Egypt.”37TheÓHaverlikewise speaks, asdoes all of Israel, not on the basis of theoretical reason, but of personalexperience and uninterrupted tradition (I:11– 25).When the King protests that this faith seems exclusive to the peopleof Israel, theÓHaverdoes not disagree, arguing that Jews are the select(Ósafwa) of humankind.38He alludes to a natural hierarchy, a chain con-sisting of minerals, plants, animals, humans, and then prophets, whoexist above ordinary human beings as a separate, angelic species (I:26 –47). The prophets passed down a true tradition regarding creation andthe chronology of the world. The Greeks, in contrast, while they have animpressive heritage of philosophy, are forced to rely on their intellectsprecisely because they lack divine tradition (I:49 – 65). Had Aristotlepossessed a true tradition that taught the creation of the world, hewould have used his logical arguments to document creation, ratherthan to prove that the world is eternal.According to theÓHaver, there is decisive proof neither for creationnor for an eternal world order. The Torah does not contradict anythingpatently clear or decisively proven by reason. However, the words of theprophets are more reliable than the conclusions derived by reason alone.Given that the Torah teaches creation, the arguments for creation are tobe believed over those for eternity. Historical experience and prophetictradition prevail over mere human logic (I:65– 67).Whereas philosophy ascribes the wisdom of creation to nature, theTorah denies that nature is inherently intelligent. Rather, nature bearsthe marks of its wise Creator, who alone can teach humankind themeans to receive traces of the Divine (I:69 – 79). Human beings who tryto control the Divine are like an ignorant person who dispenses drugsfrom a pharmacy without knowledge of medicine. This person is morelikely to harm than to heal, for the healing properties lie not within thejars of medicine but in the wisdom of the physician who prepared them.Just so, we can only reach God through practicing the regimen of com-mandments prescribed by God.Pagans forgot the true physician and guide, following instead inter-mediate causes such as astrological constellations, which left them wan-dering from god to god and from law to law (I:79). In contrast, the true14Introduction"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"religion did not arise gradually, but all at once. Through the plagues inEgypt, God demonstrated that the Divine acts directly in nature, with noneed for intermediate causes or astrological help (I:80 – 83).However, despite all the miracles they saw, the Israelites continuedto doubt whether God had in fact spoken to Moses. Perhaps, they rea-soned, the law was merely a human invention. Perhaps Moses was in-spired in a vision or a dream; perhaps the Torah was the creation of hishuman intellect, only later confirmed by divine support. In order to re-fute such philosophical theories of prophecy, God orchestrated the eventat Mount Sinai; only direct experience of revelation could remove alldoubt from their minds. Without being able to explain how it was pos-sible, all who were present at Sinai knew the revelation came directlyfrom the Creator, with no intermediary (I:87– 91).How then could the nation descend so swiftly to the sin of thegolden calf? Worship of idols was widespread at the time; idolatry wasthe universal language of religion. Even a philosopher setting out toprove the unity and sovereignty of God would point to an image, whichhe would argue was connected to a divine presence (an ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı). Thusdid the Israelites point to the pillar of cloud and fire that accompaniedthem in the wilderness, and to the cloud which spoke with Moses in thetent of meeting. The people’s goal in making the golden calf was to havean object to which they could point when relating the wonders of God.Their sin consisted not in building an image per se, but in attributing an™amr il ̄ah ̄ıto something they chose and created themselves, without theguidance of God (I:97). This, says the King, confirms the angel’s messagein his dream: one can only reach the Divine (™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ı) through a com-mand of God, an ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı(I:98).TheÓHaveragrees, explaining that the law articulates precisely howone should approach the Divine, including detailed laws of prayer, sac-rifice, and ritual purity (I:99). The King, however, protests the exclusiv-ity of such a law, given in the Hebrew tongue to one particular people.Would it not have been better if all humankind had been guided in theright path? (I:102). To this plea, theÓHaverresponds by reiterating his vi-sion of sacred history: the spirit of divine prophecy rested upon one indi-vidual per generation, until the twelve sons of Jacob, each of whom ei-ther achieved the degree of prophecy or “became spiritual” throughcontact with prophets (I:103). While the King presumes that one whohad achieved such a level would surely long for death, theÓHaverassureshim that the Torah promises connection with God in this very life. Onewho tastes immortality in this world does not need to fasten hopes onthe world to come (I:108 – 9).Introduction15"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"However, the King challenges this point, arguing that if we judge aperson’s chances for the afterlife by their closeness to God during thislife, we should judge the status of the Jews in the next world by their sta-tion in this world. The King here articulates the standard Christian ar-gument from history, which deduces the falseness of Judaism from theJews’ lowly station. TheÓHavercounters that Christians and Muslimscannot legitimately level this argument against the Jews, as both Chris-tianity and Islam glorify humility and lowliness (I:112– 13). However,he agrees with the King in one respect: Jews should take on their degra-dation and exile in a spirit of submission to God’s will. If they do so,they will hasten the arrival of the Messiah (I:115).Book TwoAt the opening of Book Two, the King and his people convert to Judaismand the King takes theÓHaveras his tutor.39He begins with a lesson onGod’s names and attributes. TheÓHaverexplains that all of God’s namesare adjectives describing the way creatures are affected by God’s actions.While God appears merciful and compassionate at some times, jealousand vengeful at others, God is simply a just judge, who does not actuallychange from one attribute to another.TheÓHaverclassifies divine attributes as attributes of action, attrib-utes of relation, and attributes of negation.40Attributes of action de-scribe God through actions proceeding from him: God makes poor andmakes rich, acts mercifully or with strict judgment. Attributes of relationdescribe God in language through which humans exalt the Creator:blessed, praised, glorified, holy, exalted, and extolled. Negative attrib-utes—such as living, only, first, and last—negate their contraries, with-out being established in their ordinary sense. For example, we call God“living” in order to deny that God is inanimate or dead; in truth, how-ever, God is beyond life and death, which apply only to material bodies(II:2). God’s will made the heavens revolve continually; the same willadapted the air to the sound of the divine word in the giving of the tencommandments, fashioned the two tablets out of stone, and engravedthe writing on the tablets. The spiritual forms called God’s Glory—thoseforms that are visible to the prophets—are produced from an ethereal,created substance known as Holy Spirit. Like material bodies particu-larly affected by sunlight, the land of Israel is especially benefited by theGlory of God, which is like a ray of divine light (II:4 – 8).TheÓHaverthus reaffirms that God acts directly in nature, with noneed for intermediary causes (II:6), and explains how the light of the Di-16Introduction"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"vine can manifest as Glory or Shekhinah, and in one land more than an-other (II:6 – 24). From discussion of the land and the Temple, theÓHaverturns to the sacrificial order (II:25– 28). Since its destruction, the Jewshave missed the heart of the nation, the Temple; however, they still con-nect with God through commandments such as circumcision and Sab-bath (II:29 – 34). Even today, Israel is among the nations like the heartamidst the organs of the body. It is the organ that is most sensitive, re-flecting the sickness and health of the whole (II:36 – 44).The King is surprised, given Israel’s spiritual sensitivity, that thereare not hermits and ascetics among the nation. TheÓHaverexplains thatattitudes such as humility and submission alone do not draw one near toGod; divinely commanded actions are necessary. Love and fear of Godare aspects of the rational law, which precedes the divine law in charac-ter and in time. However, it is ultimately the divine law which connectsthe nation with the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı. This divine law does not demand asceti-cism but rather moderation, giving each faculty of the human being itsdue. God is approached equally through awe, love, and joy (II:45– 50).The chapter concludes with an excursis on the superiority of the Hebrewlanguage (II:67– 81).Book ThreeAs Book Three opens, theÓHaverreiterates his anti-ascetic stance: thepious person41among Israel is not someone who detaches himself fromsociety, but one who disciplines his life in this world so as to merit life inthe world to come. Those who attempt asceticism today are in danger ofself-delusion and of distancing themselves from—rather than drawingcloser to—the Divine (III:1). The good person is obeyed by his or hersenses as a prince is obeyed by his people. Pious Jews are aided in self-discipline and purification by the rhythm of mitsvot: three daily times ofprayer, weekly Sabbaths, and the yearly cycle of festivals (III:5). TheÓHaverexplains in detail the meaning of the Jewish liturgy, including theadvantage of communal prayer over individual worship (III:11– 19).This completes the argument begun in Book Two that Jewish communallife provides a taste of the world to come, and thus requires no asceticisolation or monasticism (III:20 – 22).The second half of Book Three offers a detailed response to the Ka-raite critique, building on the anti-Karaite polemics of Sa¡adya Gaon.TheÓHaverargues that there are two crucial ingredients for drawing nearto God: divine command and true tradition. Legal dialectics, for whichthe Karaites are known, are no substitute for true tradition, which theIntroduction17"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"rabbis possess. The tradition of the rabbis is grounded in divine inspira-tion; rabbinic authority traces back to the Sanhedrin, which was gracedwith the presence of the Shekhinah(III:22– 41). Moreover the rabbismaintain necessary safeguards to preserve the unity and integrity of di-vine law (III:42– 53)Divinely commanded actions are ultimately like works of nature:they are not under our control, we do not understand how they work,and yet they miraculously bring us into contact with the Divine. We canonly draw near to God through actions commanded by God. Knowl-edge of these commands comes through prophecy, not through humanreason. Our link to prophecy, and thus to divine commandment, is rab-binic tradition (III:53). TheÓHaveraffirms and traces the chain of tradi-tion from the prophets of the First and Second Temple to the rabbis ofthe Mishnah and Talmud (III:54 – 67). He defends rabbinic interpreta-tion of Scripture and rabbinic aggadot, conceding that the rabbis mayhave possessed canons of interpretation that we have lost (III:68 – 73).Book FourWhile Book Three focuses on law and interpretation, Book Four turnsto prophecy and religious experience. The book opens with an analysisof the names for God in the Torah. TheÓHaverobserves that Elohimfunctions as a common noun—a generic term for God, which can eventake a definite article—whereas the Tetragrammaton functions as aproper noun, the personal name of the God of Israel. Elohimis thegovernor of the world whose existence we deduce through logical argu-ment; the Lord is the God human beings know through prophetic expe-rience (IV:1– 3).The prophets are endowed with an inner eye; through this eye, theywitness visions which teach profound truths about the Creator. WhereasGreek philosophy doubts whatever it has not encountered, prophetscannot doubt what they have witnessed directly through their inner eye.Living in many different generations, the prophets testify to one anotherabout the truths they see, forming a community of corroborating wit-nesses (IV:3). Prophetic vision can see in an instant what volumes of phi-losophy cannot grasp. The prophetic experience gives birth to love andawe; these are natural responses to standing in the presence of God.Moses brought the people to Mount Sinai to see the light that he hadseen; the hours and direction of prayer were instituted so people couldcontinue to behold this divine light (IV:4 – 11).Once one has known the Lord through direct witness and taste, onebecomes a servant of God, passionately in love with the divine beloved,18Introduction"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"ready to die for God’s sake, rather than lose the sweetness of God’s pres-ence. Abraham was such a lover of God; once he has tasted God’s pres-ence, he scoffs at the indirect way of reason, by which he had oncesought to prove God’s existence. The Lord is called the God of Israel be-cause Israel is the people of this seeing, and the land of Israel providesthe climate that makes seeing God possible. Common people sense thatthe rabbis possess an authentic teaching not found in the words of thephilosophers, however sophisticated (IV:15– 17). The divine law in facttransforms one who practices it. Just as a seed transforms the soil inwhich it is planted, so will Israel transform the nations among whom sheis dispersed, which is God’s wise design (IV:23).Book Four concludes with a detailed interpretation of Sefer Yetsirah,a book of numerical speculation, taken to demonstrate the achievementsof the Jewish people in natural science (IV:25– 31).Book FiveIn Book Five, theÓHaveragrees after protest to provide a detailed expla-nation of the principles of the kal ̄am. He begins, however, by explainingprinciples of cosmology, metaphysics, and psychology according to thephilosophers;42his discourse on psychology in V:12 is in fact a treatise ofAvicenna’s. However, once he has thoroughly impressed the King withthis philosophical explanation, theÓHaverlaunches into a trenchant cri-tique of the philosophical world view, a critique that has much in com-mon with Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s Incoherence of the Philosophers. TheÓHaverrejectsthe philosophers’ notion of four constitutive elements of nature as atheoretical construct with no empirical proof. He points out flaws in thesuggestion that philosophical learning brings union with the Active In-tellect and immortality of the soul. If this is the case, he asks, how do weaccount for people who lose their learning; do they have two differentsouls? Why do various philosophers not conceive their ideas simultane-ously, hold identical views, or know what one another is thinking? Infact, what little consensus exists among philosophers is not due to theo-retical agreement, as in mathematics and the demonstrative sciences,but because individuals belong to the same philosophical school (V:14).As for kal ̄am, he insists it is dangerous. It cannot endow a soul withthe simple faith that comes naturally, like a poetic gift, and can in factraise doubts where none existed before (V:16). Nevertheless, he outlinesa system of kal ̄ammetaphysics, which proves the creation of the worldin time, and the eternal, non-corporeal nature of the Creator. Kal ̄ammetaphysics portrays God as living, omniscient, and possessed of aneternal will (V:18).Introduction19"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Finally, theÓHaveroutlines his own beliefs. He affirms both humanfree will and active divine providence, asserting that events work throughdivine, natural, and accidental causes. God creates all with wisdom,endowing every substance with its perfect form. However, intermediarycauses are also necessary to bring beings to their perfect formation. TheÓHaverinsists on the existence of a natural hierarchy consisting of miner-als, plants, animals, and humans, who are nearest to the First Cause,which—somewhat surprisingly—he describes as reason itself. The divinelaw brings one even closer to reason, and practice of the commandmentsleads one to an angelic degree, the degree of prophetic inspiration (V:20).The ÓHaverthus suggests an interesting dialectic between freedomand providence. Human beings have freedom to choose their actions;the possibility of repentance is ever present, and reproof is therefore ef-fective. From another point of view, however, everything can be tracedback to the First Cause, either directly or indirectly. The highest we canreach is to perceive supernatural causes in natural events; since we can-not grasp the nature of the Divine itself, we dwell on God’s works. On anational level, the divine will guides Jewish history. Although provi-dence was more evident when the Shekhinahdwelt among them, divineguidance continues and is manifest for those with eyes to see (V:20 – 21).TheÓHavercloses by expressing his intention to set out for the landof Israel. Although the visible Shekhinahhas departed, he affirms thatthe invisible Shekhinahis present with every Israelite of pure heart, andthat the land of Israel is pervaded by the Divine Presence. The divine lawcomes to full fruition in the land. TheÓHaveraffirms he seeks only thefreedom to serve God; service of God is true freedom, humility beforeGod is true honor (V:25).He stresses, however, that intention on its own is not enough; inten-tion must be united with action. Only when it is impossible to act is onerewarded for intention alone. The holy land stands as a reminder andstimulus to the love of God; when all of Israel yearn passionately forJerusalem’s restoration, only then will she be rebuilt (III:27). In face ofsuch a plea, the King concedes it would be wrong to hinder theÓHaverfrom his journey, and bids him well (III:28). This brings us full circle, forthe King was admonished in his dream to seek the way of action pleasingto God. The implication is that this way of action is ultimately fulfilled inthe land of Israel.Our summary concluded, let us turn to analysis of the specific termsHa-Levi uses for religious experience, and the way these terms shape hisargument on behalf of the Jewish faith.20Introduction"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"PART 1The Language of RelationshipReligious Experience as Connection or Union (IttiÓs ̄al)and Arrival (WuÓs ̄ul)As we have noted, various rival groups in the medieval Islamicworld—philosophers, theologians, Sufi mystics, legal scholars—wereeach laying claim to common Arabic terms. Ha-Levi adapts and trans-forms these Arabic terms in an original way to reflect his distinct per-spective on religious experience.One way Ha-Levi speaks of the religious path or goal is in relationalterms—as union, communion, contact, connection, or conjunction (ittiÓs ̄al);as well as attaining, arriving at, or reaching the Divine (wuÓs ̄ul). Bothterms stem from the Arabic root wa Ósala. Wa Ósalameans to connect, join,unite, combine, or link; and also to arrive at or reach, perhaps through aprocess of connection. These terms were the subject of great controversyin twelfth-century Muslim Spain. Because they describe the very goaland purpose of religious life, these key terms reach to the heart of eachgroup’s identity: philosophers, mystics, and mainstream legal scholarseach felt the need to define a position on the possibility of ittiÓs ̄al.1The terms ittiÓs ̄aland wuÓs ̄ulare in fact the focus of a central debatein the Middle Ages: in what sense is it possible for human beings toachieve union with the Divine, and how does one attain such union?2While some groups assert ittiÓs ̄alis possible and they map out a detailedprogram for its attainment, others object strongly to this concept. Ha-Levi plays with the terms ittiÓs ̄aland wuÓs ̄ulin a way that reframes theproblem and offers a unique resolution.IttiÓs ̄alis central to the Kuzarifrom the very outset; the term is fea-tured in the King’s opening encounters with his three interlocutors.

We will seethat theÓHaver’s narrative includes an account of ittiÓs ̄alamong foundingfigures, various levels of ittiÓs ̄al(individual and communal, elite and non-elite) and the covenantal dimension of ittiÓs ̄al.We will then consider the importance of mitsvotand Jewish commu-nal life for Ha-Levi’s concept of ittiÓs ̄al, and examine the relationshipbetween ittiÓs ̄al, immortality, and the afterlife in Ha-Levi’s thought. Thefinal section will explore several dimensions of Ha-Levi’s argument: theÓHaver’s response to Christian and Muslim critiques of Judaism, his de-fense of Biblical asceticism despite Ha-Levi’s anti-ascetic religious ideal,and his unique interpretation of Jewish national suffering.A. Sufi and Philosophical Terminology: Use of theTerm IttiÓs ̄alin the Opening DialogueWe have noted that the Islamic mystical movement known as Sufism (ta-sawwuf) flowered in Muslim Spain from the tenth century on. Sufis andphilosophers in medieval Spain each described a form of union with thedivine realm which they called ittiÓs ̄al. For Sufis, the goal of spiritual lifewas clear: union with God. For scholars like the philosopher depicted inI:1 of the Kuzari, the more modest goal of the human quest was unionwith the Active Intellect, the tenth celestial intelligence emanated fromthe Divine, which governs the sublunar world and brings humanthought from potentiality to actuality.3The philosopher in I:1 speaks of this achievement as ittiÓs ̄al ittiÓh ̄ad, aconjunction of union. He advises the King to liken himself to the ActiveIntellect, and to pursue the virtues of contentment, quietism, and humil-ity;4he also suggests that the philosophic path leads to prophecy. Whilehis speech is thoroughly in keeping with the medieval philosophicalquest, the vocabulary and images he uses have Sufi overtones. The Sufi istherefore a background figure in the dialogue, the missing interlocutorwhose language and presence we feel throughout.With respect to the individual who has achieved perfection (the Per-fect One),5the philosopher asserts thatthere conjoins with him [yattaÓsilu bi-hi] from the divine nature a lightwhich is called the Active Intellect. His passive intellect conjoins with it[yattaÓsilu bi-hi] [in] a conjunction of union [ittiÓs ̄al ittiÓh ̄ad], to the pointwhere the individual regards himself as that Active Intellect, with no dis-tinction between them. (I:1: 4)22Part One"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The phrase ittiÓs ̄al ittiÓh ̄adin fact represents two ways in which unionwith the Divine had been depicted in Sufi thought: as ittiÓs ̄al—contact,communion, or union—and as ittiÓh ̄ad, an identification of natures. Inthe Sufi model, the seeker divests himself more and more of his ownhuman attributes, gradually taking on the qualities of the divine beloveduntil he or she becomes that beloved, perceiving an identity or unifica-tion (ittiÓh ̄ad) of the two natures. Some Sufis argued that such talk washeresy, for it implies there are two independent entities that could beunited, an affront to the absolute unity (tawÓh ̄ıd) of the one divine Real-ity.6Here we see the philosopher using the phrase ittiÓs ̄al ittiÓh ̄adto sug-gest a less embracing union. The passive human intellect unites not withGod, but with the Active Intellect, thereby becoming a fully actualizedintelligence, knowing all that it is possible for a human mind to know.7We see that while using the same terms, philosophers and Sufis wereliving in radically different worlds. There were bridges between theseworlds however. There was a common striving for union which unitedintellectuals in the Islamic world, and much common ground existed de-spite clear differences.8In particular, the experiential dimension of Neo-Platonic philosophy created a bridge between philosophy and Sufism.Plotinus, the third-century father of Neo-Platonism, had described di-vine emanation as an initial “downward” path, whereby the unknow-able One emanates through Mind, Soul, and Nature into this world; thisis the philosophical dimension to his thought. However, he also pre-scribed an upward, religious path by which a soul yearning for return tothe One could strive to attain reunion.9Plotinus described his own experience of mystical oneness in a pas-sage frequently quoted by medieval philosophers of Judaism and Islam.For Plotinus, union was not simply intellectual, but experiential andecstatic:Often I have woken up out of the body to my self and have entered intomyself, going out from all other things; I have seen a beauty wonderfullygreat and felt assurance that then most of all I belonged to the better part; Ihave actually lived the best life and come to identify with the divine; and setfirm in it I have come to that supreme actuality, setting myself above all elsein the realm of Intellect. Then after that rest in the divine, when I havecome down from Intellect to discursive reasoning, I am puzzled how I evercame down, and how my soul has come to be in the body when it is what ithas shown itself to be by itself, even when it is in the body.10Plotinus’s account of his own experience provided a bridge betweena purely cognitive approach to ittiÓs ̄aland the experiential approach ofThe Language of Relationship23"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the Sufis. It is true that this passage was known to medieval Islamic andJewish philosophers in a slightly different form: the Arabic version wasfound in an apocryphal work known as the Theology of Aristotle. Thistranslation softened Plotinus’s language of union by speaking of hisbeing “attached” to the divine world rather than united with it. Never-theless, the experiential nature of Plotinus’s journey remains clear:Sometimes, I was as it were alone with my soul: I divested myself of mybody, put it aside, and was as it were a simple substance without a body.Then I entered into my essence by returning into it free from all things. Iwas knowledge, knowing, and known at the same time. I saw in my essenceso much of beauty, loveliness, and splendor that I remained astonished andconfused, and I knew that I was a part of the exalted, splendid, divineupper world, and that I was endowed with an active life. When this becameclear to myself, I rose in my essence from this world to the divine world,and I was as it were placed there and attached [muta¡alliq] to it. I wasabove the whole intelligible world, and saw myself as if I stood in that ex-alted divine position, and beheld there such light and splendor as tonguesare unable to describe and ears are impotent to hear.11Elsewhere, moreover, the Theologytranslates Plotinus using theterm ittiÓs ̄al, as in the following passage: “When the soul leaves thisworld and enters the higher world . . . it unites with (Intellect) withoutits essence perishing. . . . It is both thinker and thought12. . . because ofthe intensity of its conjunction (ittiÓs ̄al) with Intellect”; soul and Intellectare then “one thing, and two.”13Avicenna and other medieval philoso-phers thus evoke both sides of Plotinus when they describe the goal ofreligious life as ittiÓs ̄al, a union that is both cognitive and ecstatic.14Avicenna’s language of union cannot be wholly ascribed to Neo-Platonic philosophy, however. He and other medieval thinkers were alsoseeking to make sense of claims to religious experience by Sufis in theirmidst. Avicenna devotes a section of his Book of Directives and Re-marks(Kit ̄ab al-ish ̄ar ̄ at wa-l-tanb ̄ıh ̄at) to a phenomenological descrip-tion of the path of the Sufis. In it, he describes ittiÓs ̄alas one stage of con-tact or uniting on the way to final arrival or union (wuÓs ̄ul) with theDivine.15The fact that there was already an ecstatic component to thephilosophical model of ittiÓs ̄al, and that the term was current in medievalNeo-Platonic texts, solidified the bridge to Sufi thought. The language ofittiÓs ̄alwas common to the worlds of Sufism and philosophy, so much sothat it is not entirely clear in which sphere the term originated.The twelfth-century theologian al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, too, devotes attention tothe path of the Sufis and to their language of union (wuÓs ̄ul). An orthodox24Part One"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"thinker well versed in philosophy, Ghazz ̄al ̄ı was a crucial link betweenworlds, one who found in Neo-Platonic metaphysics language to expressthe unitive nature of SufiittiÓs ̄al.16Ghazz ̄al ̄ı varies in his degree of comfortwith the terminology of union. He is critical of such language in his well-known spiritual autobiography, in which he recounts his conversion tothe Sufi way. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı asserts that the only path to true knowledge ofGod is the path of the Sufi, and he describes with conviction the disciple’sascent on the way (Ótar ̄ıqa). However, of the final stage on the path, hewarns: “The matter comes ultimately to a closeness to God which onegroup almost conceives of as indwelling [Óhul ̄ul], and another as union[ittiÓh ̄ad] and another as arrival [wuÓs ̄ul], but all this is wrong.”17In the Niche for Lights, however, Ghazz ̄al ̄ı describes in lyrical Sufilanguage the state of those who attain to the Divine (al-waÓsil ̄una). Theyare annihilated in God; “nothing remains any more save the One, theReal.” Nevertheless, Ghazz ̄al ̄ı is careful to distinguish between con-sciousness of God’s absolute Unity (tawÓh ̄ıd)—the recognition that thereis no real Being other than God—and certain Sufis’ claims to identitywith God (ittiÓh ̄ad), a claim he rejects. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı is aware of both the mys-tical possibilities of the language of union and its dangers, and expressesboth dimensions in his writings.18As we have seen, Ba Óhya ibn Paq ̄uda, author of the eleventh-centuryclassic Duties of the Heart, is also a maker of bridges; Ba Óhya unites theworlds of the Sufi, the philosopher, and the Jew. He structures his workexactly like a Sufi manual, with various gates teaching Sufi ideals suchas absolute trust in God (tawakkul), introspection and spiritual self-reckoning (muÓh ̄asaba), humility (taw ̄aÓdu¡) and surrender to God’s will,even ascetic self-denial (zuhd). The opening chapter, in which Ba Óhyademonstrates the absolute unity of the Divine (tawÓh ̄ıd), blends Sufi spir-itual ideals with those of Neo-Platonic philosophy.19In the last chapter,Ba Óhya explains that love of God is the soul’s essential yearning to con-join (tattaÓsil) with God’s light; in Ba Óhya, ittiÓs ̄alassumes a Sufi, devo-tional flavor.20Whether or not Ha-Levi is responding directly to Ba Óhya,Ba Ó hya’s very presence attests to the strong attraction Sufi ideals of unionheld for the Jewish community of medieval Spain.We thus hear both Neo-Platonic and Sufi overtones within the lan-guage of union used by the philosopher in I:1. The philosopher describesan intellectual path to union with the Active Intellect that mirrors the ex-periential path of the Sufi. Unlike the Sufis or Plotinus however, Ha-Levi’s philosopher—like other medieval Neo-Platonists—holds thatunion with God or the One is not possible. He therefore makes intellec-tual perfection, rather than mystical union, the goal of his quest.The Language of Relationship25"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Moral virtues are crucial for the philosophical path, Ha-Levi’s phi-losopher teaches, both as an aid to intellectual perfection and as a fruitof union with the Active Intellect. The philosopher’s moral vocabularyalso carries Sufi overtones; he associates the philosophical path of mod-eration (“the most just and balanced of ways”)21with central Sufi virtuesof contentment, quietism, and humility. The philosophers’ limbs becomelike limbs of the Active Intellect, just as the Sufi who reaches union be-comes an instrument of the Divine.22Like Al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı, Avicenna, and other Islamic philosophers, Ha-Levi’sphilosopher portrays prophecy and true dreams as the ultimate fruit ofthe philosophical quest. Here, too, we find echoes of Sufi teachings, forSufiittiÓs ̄alwith God is said to result in dreams, visions, and prophecy.Al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı describes prophecy as an offshoot of the Sufi path, andstates categorically that “the properties of prophecy beyond those justmentioned can be perceived only by tasting (dhawq) as a result of fol-lowing the way of Sufism.”23Ha-Levi’s philosopher advises the King to follow the philosophicalpath to perfection so that he may achieve his ultimate goal:You will be able to arrive at your desired goal24: making contact [ittiÓs ̄al]with that spiritual [entity], I mean the Active Intellect. And perhaps it willcause you to prophesy, and instruct you in the hidden knowledge25throughtrue dreams and accurate images. (I:1: 5)The philosopher speaks with a note of irony; by suggesting that truedreams and prophecy occur only after a long and arduous journey, thephilosopher in effect dismisses the “prophetic” dream that had promptedthe King’s quest.26From the outset, however, Ha-Levi challenges the philosophicalclaim to prophecy. He has the King argue that despite their contact(ittiÓs ̄al) with the spiritual realm, philosophers are not known for proph-ecy, while people without philosophical or spiritual preparation receiveveridical dreams. This, concludes the King, proves that between the Di-vine (™amr il ̄ah ̄ı) and souls there is some connection, which he terms a se-cret (sirr), beyond the philosophical.27The King thus defends both therevelatory nature of his dream and the possibility of a kind of ittiÓs ̄albe-yond that promised by philosophy. Moreover, by using the term sirr—aSufi technical term for the secret, innermost part of the human soul—Ha-Levi once again plays the philosopher against an absent Sufi interloc-utor and the promise of SufiittiÓs ̄al.28By using Sufi terminology, Ha-Levi sets up implicit contrasts between26Part One"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"philosophy and Sufism, not in order to hold up Sufism as an alternative,but to point out weaknesses in both ideals. Ultimately, Ha-Levi playsboth Sufi and philosophical ittiÓs ̄alagainst what he sees as a more direct,concrete, and powerful religious experience found in the relationshipbetween the Biblical God and the people of Israel.The King explicitly extends the term ittiÓs ̄alto signify such concretedivine-human contact when he expresses a philosophical skepticism,perhaps inspired by the philosopher’s argument, about the possibility ofthis kind of ittiÓs ̄al:The [human] soul is not at ease admitting that the Creator has contact[muttaÓs ̄ıl] with flesh [and blood] [humanity] except by a miracle thatchanges the natures [of things], by which we know that only the One whocreated [all] things from nothing was capable of it. This event must takeplace before masses who witness it directly—it should not come to themthrough a report or a chain of tradition—so that it can be studied and care-fully examined, lest it be thought that it was a phantasm or magic.[And even then] it is 30[only] with difficulty that the soul [can] acceptthis great thing, that the Creator of this world and the next world and theheavens and the heavenly bodies makes contact [yattaÓsilu] with this dirtypiece of mud, I mean a human being, and that God talks to him, and fulfillshis requests, and does his will. (I:8: 9)The King poses this objection still more trenchantly to theÓHaverinI:68:But how did your souls become convinced of this great thing,31that theCreator of the bodies, spirits, intellects and angels, who is too high, tooholy, too exalted for intellects—much less for the senses—to perceive,makes contact [ittiÓs ̄al] with this low creature, sunk in matter, even if he isgreat in form. For in the smallest of worms there are mysteries of wisdomthat the understanding cannot grasp. (I:68: 18)The King is clearly impressed by the strength of the philosopher’s ar-gument; he is not impressed, however, by the philosopher’s attempt toco-opt the term ittiÓs ̄al. For the King realizes that while exalting philo-sophical ittiÓs ̄al, the philosopher implies that real contact with God—what the King would call true ittiÓs ̄al—is impossible.The King’s use of ittiÓs ̄althus prepares us for Ha-Levi’s new twist toittiÓs ̄al, which we hear in the Christian’s speech in KuzariI:4:The Creator has concern for [providence over]32creatures, and contactwith [ittiÓs ̄al bi] human beings,33and anger and compassion and speech andThe Language of Relationship27"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"appearance and revelation to prophets and pious ones34and dwelling35among those who please him among the masses.As the first voice for Biblical religion in the Kuzari, the Christianintroduces the Biblical God who has a personal relationship with humanbeings; Ha-Levi uses ittiÓs ̄alhere in a new way to describe the corporateand individual contact between God and humanity attested to in theBible. The Christian states his belief in “all that is mentioned in the Torahand in the records of the children of Israel.” The Christian thus testifies tothe veracity of the Biblical record. The Christian goes on to claim thatGod’s continual ittiÓs ̄alis specific to the nation of Israel. Christians, he as-serts, “believe in [God] and in [God’s] dwelling [incarnation]36among thechildren of Israel as an honor [distinction] to them, because the divine[™amr il ̄ah ̄ı] never ceased to be attached [yattaÓsilu] to them until themasses rebelled against this messiah and crucified him”(I:4: 7).The Christian, like the philosopher, appropriates the term ittiÓs ̄alforthe form of ittiÓs ̄alhe believes is the highest; for the Christian, this is di-vine incarnation. Beyond this specifically Christian claim, however, theChristian in Ha-Levi’s text has also introduced the broader notion ofittiÓs ̄alas God’s providential relationship with the people of Israel. In at-testing to God’s specific connection with the people of Israel and de-scribing it as ittiÓs ̄al, the Christian prepares the reader for Ha-Levi’s newtwist. TheÓHaverwill expand upon the Christian’s words by tracing theentire history of the Jewish people as a history of ittiÓs ̄al.In summary, Ha-Levi’s philosopher uses the term ittiÓs ̄alin the stan-dard medieval philosophical sense, to describe conjunction of the ActiveIntellect with the perfected intellect of the individual philosopher. TheKing introduces the term ittiÓs ̄alto portray concrete, divine-human con-tact when he describes the philosophical problems in positing such apersonal relationship between God and human beings. The Christian, asthe first witness for Biblical religion, uses the term to depict the specificrelationship between God and the people of Israel.This play among the various senses of ittiÓs ̄al—including that of theabsent Sufi—serves as a fitting introduction to the dialogue. The framestory prompts readers to ponder the problem of divine contact and theconflicting ways it had been posed by rival factions in the medievalworld. Ha-Levi’s readers, medieval Jews educated in the intellectual ter-minology of Judaeo-Arabic culture, would be attuned to the variousways Ha-Levi has used the term ittiÓs ̄alin framing the debate. Ha-Levi’sreaders will thus be especially conscious of the new twists Ha-Levi intro-duces, chiefly through the person of theÓHaver, to the language of ittiÓs ̄al.28Part One"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"B. Sh ̄ı¡ite TerminologyWe have seen that in the opening dialogue, Ha-Levi’s Christian brings anew nuance to the term ittiÓs ̄alby using it to describe the Biblical rela-tionship between God and Israel. When we come to theÓHaver’s use ofittiÓs ̄aland wuÓs ̄ul, we discover that Ha-Levi’s usage is also a creative ad-aptation and transformation of Sh ̄ı¡ite language.Whereas Sufis and philosophers by and large used ittiÓs ̄alto describethe goal of a human-initiated quest for union, in certain tenth-centurySh ̄ı¡ite texts we find God reaching to unite with the human rather thanhuman beings reaching out to the Divine.37In these Ism ̄a¡ ̄ ıl ̄ı texts, whichShlomo Pines brought together, God chooses to attach to a series ofprophets, the best individual in each generation.The Sh ̄ı¡ite authors link three terms we also find at the center of theKuzari: ™a m r, Ós a f w a, and ittiÓs ̄al. The term ™a m rliterally means thing,matter, order, or command. In the Qur™ ̄an, the term amrsignifies God’scommand; in Sh ̄ı¡ite thought, the divine ™amr came to signify God’s com-manding word, the divine will, or what Pines terms “a divine influx con-ferring prophethood.”38In theSh ̄ı¡ite texts to which Pines called attention, ™amr (or ™a m rAllah) denotes that aspect of the Divine which comes down to selecthuman individuals and signals God’s choice of them.39The termÓsafwa inthese texts denotes either the fact of divine election, or the people whoare the select of God.40Variants of the verbittaÓs ̄ala (conjoin) andittaÓhada (unite) are used in these texts to describe the conjunction of thedivine ™amr with the line of prophets, beginning with Adam.41Unlike the Sufis and philosophers, for whom ittiÓs ̄alhad come to in-dicate the goal of a human-initiated quest for union, Ha-Levi, like theauthors of these Ism ̄a¡ ̄ ıl ̄ı texts, sometimes uses ittiÓs ̄alto indicate contactinitiated by God.42Ha-Levi also adapts and transforms the Sh ̄ı¡ite com-plex of terms: we find in the Kuzarithe term ™a m rfor the Divine—mostoften in the phrase ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ı, commonly translated divine “power,”“influence,” or “order”—and the term Ósafwafor the line of individualsto whom the divine ™amrattaches (ittaÓsala). However, whereas the ™amrof the Sh ̄ı¡ites is a divine influx that comes down through a series of em-anations, Ha-Levi detaches the term from its elaborate Neo-Platonicframework, and uses it as a fluid way to point to the Divine.Many scholars have tried to pin down the precise ontological statusand function of Ha-Levi’s ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı; my sense, however, is that Ha-Levilikes the flexibility of this moniker for the Divine.43While Ha-Levi doesThe Language of Relationship29"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"often use the term ™a m ror ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıto describe God’s interaction withcreation, he uses these ambiguous terms precisely so that this interactionnot be reified; it is doubtful that he conceived of the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıas anintermediary with a specific ontological status.44I have thus opted totranslate the phrase simply as “the Divine,” and not pin down the ™a m ril ̄ ahias a specific order, influence, influx, or command.45Ha-Levi’s adap-tation of the terms Ósafwaand ittiÓs ̄allikewise resists being reduced to anyrigid theoretical framework. Ha-Levi seeks to capture the simple, mys-terious relationship to God he sees in true Biblical religion, and adaptsthis complex of Sh ̄ı¡ite terms to explain the unique connection of theJewish people to God.Of course, Ha-Levi’s interest in the term ittiÓs ̄alas used by the Sh ̄ı¡itesstems precisely from the term’s prestige among Sufis and philosophers.Ha-Levi’s appropriation of Sh ̄ı¡ite language does not then imply a com-plete rejection of Sufi and philosophical models. Throughout the Kuzarithe sense of a human-initiated quest for union will remain in a tense di-alectic with historical, God-initiated ittiÓs ̄al. Ha-Levi is keenly aware thatboth elements vie for attention in the Biblical story.46C. The History of the Jewish People as a History of IttiÓs ̄alIn Book One of the Kuzari, theÓHaverlays out for the king his basic con-ception of Jewish history. Our focus on the verbal root w-Ós-lwill revealthis to be a history of God’s encounter with humanity, a history, in effect,of ittiÓs ̄al.1.IttiÓs ̄alamong Founding FiguresTheÓHaver’s sacred history of the Jewish nation sets forth a propheticelite beginning with Adam. TheÓHaverdescribes Adam using motifsavailable in his Islamic intellectual milieu—in particular, Sufi and philo-sophical models of perfection. In I:95, he calls Adam the Perfect One (al-k ̄amil), a term that calls to mind the philosopher’s description of the per-fect human being (al-ins ̄an al-k ̄amil) in I:1. Like the Sufi Knower ofGod47who has entered into union with the Divine, Ha-Levi’s Adam“knows the Truths without instruction, by simple reflection” (I:95: 28).48TheÓHaverdescribes Adam’s capacity for an individual connectionwith God as the crowning perfection of the father of the human race;30Part One"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Adam, he says, received “the divine power49beyond the intellect, bywhich I mean (that he was at) the level at which one connects (yattaÓsilu)with God and spiritual beings” (I:95: 28).50Adam is untutored, yet has anatural capacity for ittiÓs ̄al, a gift that Sufis and philosophers only attainthrough an arduous path of development.51The original relationshipbetween human beings and God is a spontaneous connection, not onecultivated by following the steps of a program.Like the Sufis, and unlike the philosophers, Ha-Levi wants to situateAdam’s capacity for ittiÓs ̄albeyond the realm of the intellect, and to claimthat it makes possible communion not only with the Active Intellect orthe realm of spiritual beings, but with the Divine itself. Perhaps Ha-Leviwants to hint that this is the “secret” between the soul and God to whichthe King alluded in I:4—a connection with the spiritual realm differentfrom that spoken of by the philosophers, and one whose existence theKing is seeking to verify.Unlike the Sufis, Ha-Levi’s use of ittiÓs ̄alnowhere hints of unio mys-tica.52However, Ha-Levi does suggest the human soul has some connec-tion to God that philosophers have failed to acknowledge, a connectionthat makes possible a personal relationship with God and intense relig-ious experience.Drawing upon the Sh ̄ı¡ite theory of the Ósafwa, Ha-Levi suggests thatAdam’s capacity for ittiÓs ̄almakes him the forebear of an elite line of hu-manity. Adam’s sons also have contact with the Divine, but Ha-Levi ex-plicitly portrays this ittiÓs ̄alas originating not with the sons themselvesbut with God. God singles out some of Adam’s sons as the select (Ósafwa),especially suited for divine contact, while the rest are regarded as secon-dary and superfluous:After Cain his brother killed [Abel] in jealousy over this level, he was re-placed by Seth, who was similar to Adam, being his quintessence [Ósafwa]and core,53and others were like husks and rotten fruit. The quintessence ofSeth was Enosh, and thus the ™amrmade contact [ittaÓsala] until Noah, withindividuals who were the heart, similar to Adam, called sons of God, per-fect of physical constitution and temperament, long of life and of knowl-edge and of capacity. . . . Perhaps there were among them those to whomthe ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıdid not attach [yattaÓsilu] like Terah. But Abraham his sonwas a disciple of his grandfather ¡Ever; moreover he had known Noah him-self. And so the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıwas linked54from grandfathers to grandsons.(I:95: 28)The select sons are apparently distinguished from birth; the ™a m ril ̄ ah ̄ıchooses to make contact with them because of characteristics theyThe Language of Relationship31"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"inherit from their father Adam, who was created perfect. Their siblingswith whom God did not make ittiÓs ̄alsimply failed to inherit a trait—touse a modern genetic term—which would render them fit for ittiÓs ̄al.However the genetic comparison is imperfect, as Ha-Levi allows forboth nature and nurture. Abraham is able to receive contact from the™amr il ̄ah ̄ınot only because he inherited the recessive gene from hisgrandfather ¡Ever, but also because he was a student of his grandfather,and had known his righteous ancestor Noah as well. The early ancestorspassed down both a tradition and a capacity for connection with the Di-vine; thus, the capacity for prophecy is both inherited and learned.In each generation the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıcontinues to make ittiÓs ̄alwith oneindividual whom God finds worthy—as we saw in the Sh ̄ı¡ite texts—from Adam down to the twelve sons of Jacob. Finding all twelve sons fitto link with, God makes ittiÓs ̄alwith all of them, forming what theÓHavercalls “something of an angelic elite, almost a different species of human-ity” (I:103: 35). Speaking of the prophetic line from Adam to Moses, theÓHaverasserts:These, on account of55their contact [ittiÓs ̄al], are the quintessence of Adamand his select [Ósafwa].56And each of them had progeny like husks, not re-sembling the[ir] fathers, and [therefore]57the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıdid not make con-tact [yattaÓsil] with them, and the chronology continued with the[se] divineones, who were individuals, not a group, until Jacob begat the twelvetribes, all of them fit for the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı, and the Divine came to a group,58through whom [continued] the chronology. (I:47: 14)Ha-Levi’s use of the term ittiÓs ̄alin this passage may be deliberatelyequivocal; as a poet he may in fact delight in the texture and ambiguityof the term. TheÓHaver’s assertion that these, “on account of their ittiÓs ̄al,are the heart of Adam and his select” is unclear. Does this indicate thatsome of Adam’s descendents are the “select” of their father because ofan innate capacity or worthiness, or that their actual ittiÓs ̄al—God’s rela-tionship with them—makes them an elite? Are the Ósafwaspecial becausethey are chosen, or are they chosen because they are special? TheÓHaver’s equivocal language leaves room for an arbitrary quality to thechoice. One might argue that the rejected sons’ status as “husks” derivesat least partially from the fact that God did not actually connect withthem, that for Ha-Levi ittiÓs ̄alis ultimately an act of God, who chooses toinitiate contact with certain descendents of the primordial Adam.While in this passage theÓHaverspeaks of fitness for ittiÓs ̄alas if it isinnate, elsewhere he uses language of striving or aspiration for contact32Part One"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"with the Divine. For example, theÓHaverstates that all twelve sons ofJacob strove for prophecy and most of them achieved it; those who didnot reach the level of prophecy nevertheless were able to draw near toGod through acts of holiness and encountering prophets (I:103: 35). Inhis speech on the characteristics of the pious Jew, theÓHaverasserts thatone who joins together in prayer certain affirmations of the Jewish faithwith pure intention59is a true Israelite, and it is fitting for him to aspire to60ittiÓs ̄alwith the ™amril ̄ ah ̄ı, which is connected to [al-mutaÓsÓsil] the Children of Israel to the ex-clusion of the other nations.61He finds no difficulty in standing in the pres-ence of the Shekhinah. And when he asks, he is answered. (III:17: 105)Ha-Levi here portrays ittiÓs ̄alas a connection to which a person may as-pire. TheÓHaverindicates that sincere worship through the traditionalhalakhically prescribed service is a component of, or makes one fit for,aspiration to ittiÓs ̄al.62We also see elements of both divine election and human striving inHa-Levi’s telling of the Abraham story. Ha-Levi was obviously fasci-nated with the rabbinic narrative in which God comes to Abraham theiconoclast, the first human being to reject idolatry and discover the exis-tence of one God.63This is not an arbitrary selection process, but thechoosing of one who is himself a seeker; Abraham takes some initiativeand is met half-way. Ha-Levi’s portrait of Abraham attempts to do jus-tice to what he finds in the classical Jewish tradition.64Ha-Levi depicts the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıas eagerly awaiting an individual suchas Abraham with whom it will be fitting to connect:See how Abraham—since he was distinguished [excellent] and his ittiÓs ̄alwith the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıwas necessary,65he being the core of that select[Ósafwa]—was moved from his land, to the place where his perfection couldbe completed . . .For the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıis, so to speak, waiting for whomever is worthy toattach to him [¡an yattaÓsila bi-hi] and become a God to him, such as theprophets and pious friends of God; just as the intellect, so to speak, waitsfor the one whose natural qualities have become perfected and whose souland moral qualities have become temperate, that it may dwell in him per-fectly, like the philosophers; just as the soul waits for one whose naturalpowers have become perfected and prepared for increased excellence sothat it may dwell in it, like the animals; and just as nature waits for the mix-ture which is temperate in its qualities in order to dwell in it so that it maybecome a plant. (II:14: 49 – 50)66The Language of Relationship33"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Here, too, however, Ha-Levi’s language is equivocal. An equallyvalid translation would be: “when Abraham became distinguished (ex-cellent), ittiÓs ̄alwith the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıbecame necessary.” It is not clearwhether ittiÓs ̄alcomes to Abraham because of his inherent fitness or be-cause he has perfected himself. Ha-Levi chooses Arabic verbs that ac-comodate ideas of both innate excellence and struggle.TheÓHaverdevelops a biological metaphor combining nature andnurture: natural fitness and the need for certain environmental elements.Like the root of a good tree that must be transplanted into richer soil inorder to thrive, Abraham must be brought to the land of Israel in orderto be made fit for ittiÓs ̄al: “It was not fitting that Abraham connect [li-yattaÓsila] with ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı, and that he [should] enter into and conclude amutual covenant [with God] until he had reached that land in the vi-sion67between the pieces” (II:16: 50).Beyond natural fitness and environment, however, Ha-Levi empha-sizes Abraham’s spiritual struggle, his willingness to make great sacri-fices for this God with whom he seeks to be in obedient relationship:See how syllogistic reasoning [qiy ̄as] declares circumcision absurd! It hasno entry into political life,68and yet Abraham submitted his person andchildren to it despite the natural difficulty of the command, he being onehundred years old. And it became a sign of the covenant, that the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıwould connect [li-yattaÓsila] with him and with his descendants. (III:7: 96)69God chooses to connect (li-yattaÓsila) with Abraham and his descen-dents because Abraham willingly submits himself to the commandmentof circumcision. Abraham merits ittiÓs ̄albecause he is a spiritual pioneer,developing a relationship with God based upon obedience and trust. Wethus see in Ha-Levi’s story of Abraham a foreshadowing of themes hewill develop in tracing the nation’s relationship with God—specifically,Ha-Levi links ittiÓs ̄alwith the language of covenant.In summary, Ha-Levi gives a complex and even contradictory por-trait of the role of divine choice and human initiative in the unfolding ofBiblical history. The sources of Ha-Levi’s terminology reflect tensionswithin his thought. Sh ̄ı¡ite ittiÓs ̄alseems predetermined. While Sh ̄ı¡itethought depicts a natural elite with an innate capacity for ittiÓs ̄al, Sufi andphilosophical ittiÓs ̄almake room for religious quest and struggle. Ha-Levifinds in the term ittiÓs ̄ala subtlety which he uses to steer a middle coursebetween the activism of the Sufis and philosophers and the passivism ofthe Sh ̄ı¡ites. The term ittiÓs ̄al,which signifies union, contact, or connec-tion, is itself ambiguous; it is not clear who initiates the contact or how34Part One"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"union is achieved. Perhaps the ambiguity of the term ittiÓs ̄al allows Ha-Levi to describe a mutual relationship—a collaborative effort, bothbetween God and individuals and between God and the nation as awhole—made tangible through the divine commandments.2. Communal IttiÓs ̄alGod’s ittiÓs ̄alwith individual founding figures expands to a group phe-nomenon when the twelve tribes grow into a religious nation, solid-ified through the Exodus from Egypt and the revelation at MountSinai. This series of events establishes the unique religious status of theJewish people:The King: Is your Law then confined to you?Th eÓHaver: Yes, but whoever from among the nations joins us, in particu-lar (kh ̄ aÓsÓsatan)70shares in our good,71although they are not quite the sameas us (lam yastawi ma‘n ̄a). For if the obligation of the Law derived fromHis having created us, the white and the black would indeed share equallyin it (lastaw ̄a f ̄ı-hi), for all of them are His creation. Rather the Law (isobligatory) because of His bringing us out of Egypt, and his attaching to us(ittiÓs ̄aluhu bin ̄a), for we are the select (Ósafwa) of humankind.The King: I see you quite altered, oh Jew, and your words are so poor,after having been so rich [1:25– 27: 11] . . .Up to this point, the King has gradually been won over by theÓHaver’sarguments; here he is startled by theÓHaver’s particularism. Like theKing, readers may find several points jarring:1. The exclusivism of this passage is heightened by other pas-sages of the Kuzari. In 111:17, for example, theÓHaveras-serts that God attaches to Israel to the exclusion ofthe othernations.2. The passage can be read to suggest that God attaches to theJewish people because they are innately special. Once again,we are struck by Ha-Levi’s decided ambiguity. With respectto individuals, theÓHaverasserts that certain sons on ac-count of ittiÓs ̄alare the select of humankind. Here, too, on acommunal level, the King is told that God has attached tothe Jewish people and that they are the select. Are the JewsThe Language of Relationship35"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"select because God has chosen them, or are they selected be-cause they are God’s best prospects among humankind?3. For the modern reader, theÓHaver’s reference to “the whiteand the black” calls to mind modern claims of innate racialsuperiority.72We should not overlook or minimize the potentially disturbing im-plications of this passage. The King himself here and elsewhere ex-presses discomfort with theÓHaver’s exclusivity; clearly, Ha-Levi wantsto point out the provocative nature of his claims. As Schweid has em-phasized, the King is brought in as a fair and impartial judge of Judaism.The fact that the King recoils from theÓHaver’s particularism indicatesthat Ha-Levi is aware he is presenting problematic ideas, and expects hisreaders to respond accordingly. If we accept theÓHaveras a simplemouthpiece for the author we oversimplify Ha-Levi’s position.However, we must carefully distinguish the problems this passageraises in a modern context from the way it would have been read by Ha-Levi’s contemporaries. The medieval Islamic context of Ha-Levi’s termsand arguments is crucial. By analyzing his rhetorical strategy within itsIslamic context, we can discover a more complex, nuanced perspectivethan is apparent at first glance.First, we should note a striking innovation Ha-Levi has made. Intranslating the Sh ̄ı¡ite theory of the Ósafwainto a Jewish context, Ha-Levihas shifted from speaking of ittiÓs ̄alas an individual religious experienceto ittiÓs ̄alas a communal relationship.73By using the term ittiÓs ̄alto de-scribe God’s historical attachment to the Jewish people, Ha-Levi drawson classical Jewish tradition to conceptualize religious experience in away which is unprecedented in Arabic thought.In rabbinic literature, the most intense metaphors for religious expe-rience are reserved for corporate experience; for example, until the med-ieval philosophers, the Song of Songs is read as an allegory of the lovebetween God and the nation of Israel.74Whereas Arabic religious think-ers used ittiÓs ̄alto describe individual religious experience, Ha-Levi re-interprets the term to emphasize collective revelation. Moreover, byusing one Arabic term to describe both individual and group commun-ion, Ha-Levi unites the two under a single rubric; he invests Jewish com-munal experience with the aura surrounding individual religious experi-ence in the medieval world.Second, the passage features an ingenious rhetorical twist. In writingthat “the white and the black would be equal to us” Ha-Levi is alluding36Part One"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"to a well-known Islamic tradition (Óhad ̄ıth). In one of its several versions,MuÓhammad lists five ways in which his prophecy differs from that of allthe prophets who came before him; the ultimate difference is that“(every other) prophet was sent to his nation in particular (kh ̄ aÓsÓsatan),but I have been sent to all, the red and the black.75To the modern reader, red and black suggest simple racial catego-ries, but the medieval picture is more nuanced. The Arabs describe them-selves as black or dark- colored, in contrast to the Persians or other non-Arabs, whom they describe as red, yellow, or in general of lighter hue.The red and the black thus refers, in the words of Ignaz Goldziher, to“Arabs and non-Arabs, i.e. the whole of mankind or the whole worldwithout special consideration of races.”76This universalism is most ex-plicit in texts which combine two parallel had ̄ıths. For example, in thetwelfth century Sufi allegory The Conference of the Birds, we read, “Iwas sent to the red and the black,” and “I was sent to all creatures.”77The red and the black—or white and black, in Ha-Levi’s version—evokeIslam’s claim to universalism, to be valid for all of God’s creation.Ha-Levi, in a characteristic turning of the tables, reverses the logic ofthe Prophet’s claim. MuÓhammad argues that as the seal of the prophets,he brings the Law that is most authoritative, because it is universal. Ha-Levi’sÓHaverargues just the opposite: the authority of the Torah derivesfrom its claim upon a specific people. The Law is not incumbent on allhuman beings as creatures of God, but on the Jewish people, becauseGod brought them out of Egyptian bondage. The Torah is not a high-minded, universal abstraction, but a concrete covenant, grounded in apersonal relationship and unique historical events. Whereas Islamargues that it is superior because it offers a universal Law for all human-kind, theÓHaverasserts proudly the distinctiveness and historical partic-ularity of the Torah.78Ha-Levi’s clear allusion to the Óhad ̄ıthmay also shed light on his useof the word kh ̄aÓsÓsatanin this passage. The word in fact echoes theÓhad ̄ıth’sremark that “every other prophet was sent to his nation in par-ticular” (kh ̄ aÓsÓsatan). The Óhad ̄ıthsuggests that to send a prophet to onenation in particular is exclusive and limiting. TheÓHaver, in contrast,argues that particularism is a strength. Just as God chooses to send aprophet to one nation in particular, so a person may choose to join onenation in particular. Whereas the philosopher in I:1 claims it does notmatter which way one serves God, theÓHaverargues that there is reasonto choose the practice of one community over another. Hence: “who-ever from among the nations joins us, as a particular group, shares inour good.”79The Language of Relationship37"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Notice, however, that in 1:27 it is unclear whether the Jews aregiven the Torah because they are inherently special, or whether they be-come Ósafwathrough their acceptance of divine law. The nature of thecollective specialness of the Jews is as opaque as the ittiÓs ̄alof the proph-ets, discussed above. Ha-Levi appears to deliberately leave the precisenature of Israel’s status as Ósafwaambiguous. While many have inter-preted Ha-Levi’s notion of the Ósafwaas inherent, quasi-genetic superior-ity, akin to modern theories of racial supremacy, such a reading is anach-ronistic.80The Sh ̄ı¡ite background of his vocabulary shows that theseterms cannot be reduced to modern racial categories.In fact, close examination shows that Ha-Levi is once again borrow-ing an image from its Islamic context and cleverly transforming it. Wehave seen that the term Ósafwawas used in Ism ̄a¡ ̄ ıl ̄ı texts to refer to anelite line of prophets. The sources Shlomo Pines gathered describe a dis-tinct metaphysical hierarchy beginning with minerals and culminating inprophets, who constitute a rank above the human.These ideas are present in the tenth century encyclopedia of theBrethren of Purity (Ikhw ̄an al- Ósaf ̄a’), a circle of Muslim Neo-Platonistsassociated with Sh ̄ı¡ite and possibly Ism ̄a¡ ̄ ıl ̄ı thought. In the famous de-bate between the animals and humans found in the second treatise, anIraqi character claims for his people:81We are the lubb[heart, core, choice part] of the human beings [al-n ̄as]; thehuman beings are the lubbof the animals; the animals are the lubbof theplants; the plants are the lubbof the minerals; and the minerals are the lubbof the elements. Indeed, we are the heart of hearts.”This character claims further that the Iraqi people bear the gift ofprophecy and that Iraq is the center of all lands.82The correspondences between this passage and the Kuzariare ofcourse not exact. As Harry Wolfson noted, no parallel is found to Ha-Levi’s doctrine that Israel among the nations is like the heart among theorgans of the body, most sensitive and most easily affected (11:36 – 44:66 – 68).83However, we do find a striking terminological parallel. Theterm lubband its sister lub ̄abare keywords in the Kuzari; they are oftenfound together with the term Ós a f w a, and treated as its synonym. Ha-Levi, then, was not the first to claim for his people the status of Ós a f w aand lub ̄ab; his innovation is to apply these intra-Islamic claims to theJewish people.In the Islamic context, such ideas would have important socio-38Part One"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"political consequences. The doctrine of the Ósafwawas used to justify anexclusive, hereditary im ̄amate, the central religious and political authorityof the community. The claim that prophets and im ̄ams are metaphysi-cally superior—a divine species exclusively empowered to legislate mat-ters of divine law—thus becomes an eminently practical matter of relig-ious authority.In Ha-Levi’s subtle borrowing, the terms of the debate shift. TheKing is disturbed by theÓHaver’s exclusivity not because of a debate overmetaphysical hierarchy or religious authority, but because he is troubledby the notion of a revelation intended for a particular nation. The King’sprotest thus echoes the historic claims of Islam and Christianity thatthey are superior because they offer a revelation which is universal. Inaddition, the King has been pre-disposed by the philosopher’s speech tofavor universalism.84According to the medieval philosophical tradition,all human beings are endowed with intellect; the Active Intellect governsthe world impartially, with no unique relationship to any one being, spe-cies, or nation.TheÓHaverdoes not apologize for Jewish particularism, but drawsupon the concept of the Ósafwato explain it to the King. Already in 1:27,theÓHaversuggests that the Jews’ status as Ósafwais not purely biological;it is connected with the historical event of the Exodus from Egypt andGod’s binding himself to the nation through the giving of the Torah.Nevertheless, there is a strong naturalistic component to his response tothe King.Indeed, Ha-Levi’s theory of the select, which he creatively adaptsfrom his Sh ̄ı¡ite sources, maintains a tense balance between the elementsof nature and nurture. He accepts the notion of a metaphysical hierar-chy, beginning with minerals and culminating in prophets, who consti-tute a level above the human. Ha-Levi fully exploits the theory’s natura-listic metaphors. Abraham must be transplanted to choice soil beforeittiÓs ̄alcan be achieved (II:14: 49); the Holy Land is distinguished byittiÓs ̄al(II:14: 48). Moreover, the Jewish people in exile will transform theworld as a seed transforms the soil into which it is planted (IV:23: 172).Ha-Levi uses these natural metaphors—like the Sh ̄ı¡ite metaphysicalhierarchy—to assimilate history to natural processes.Ha-Levi does, then, imbue Jewish ittiÓs ̄alwith a universal purpose.The Jewish people’s particular connection to God serves a vital functionfor the world as a whole, which needs one community that dedicates it-self to ittiÓs ̄al. The nation of Israel serves as a conduit through which Godcan send blessings, and establish a just social order:The Language of Relationship39"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"At the [daily morning] blessing “With eternal love,” the excellent person85thinks about the ittiÓs ̄alof the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ ıwith the community who is preparedto receive it, as a smooth mirror receives the light; and that the Law is theoutcome of his will, in order to establish his Law on earth, as it is inheaven. (III:17: 104)We find here another prominent Sufi image which Ha-Levi has ap-propriated from the realm of individual religiosity and applied to collec-tive religious experience. We find this image, for example in Avicenna’saccount of Sufi illumination: the soul is a mirror, which the adept pol-ishes to reflect the one Truth. The Sufi gazes back and forth at the Truthand at him or herself; in arrival (wuÓs ̄ul), the Sufi merges with the Truthhe or she beholds.86Ha-Levi transforms this image to capture Jewishcommunal experience, shifting the emphasis from the self-reflective tothe interpersonal. Whereas the Sufi image of the soul as a mirror servesas an aid to self-transformation, Ha-Levi’s mirror receives light on acommunal level. Calling to mind Isaiah’s vision of the Jewish people as alight to the nations, theÓHaversuggests that the world needs one com-munity to receive the light of God—perhaps even to reflect the light out-ward—and to mirror the Law of heaven on earth.TheÓHaversuggests further that this function explains Jewish suffer-ing. The tribulations of the Jews are necessary to purify the nation inorder to render it a suitable link to ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı:The trials that befall us bring about the soundness87of our faith, the purityof the pure-hearted88among us, and the removal from us of impurities.89And through our purity and our integrity90the ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ıconnects[yattaÓsilu] with this lower world. (II:44: 67)91Ha-Levi here draws on the vocabulary of Muslim pietism com-mon to Islamic authors of all bents, but especially prominent in Sufithought.92Through this language Ha-Levi articulates a theology ofsuffering that goes beyond simple purification of the self or the na-tion. In his view, the Jewish nation exists to serve as a bridge betweenGod and the world, through which the world as a whole can partici-pate in ittiÓs ̄alwith God. Ha-Levi sees Jewish suffering as serving thislarger extra-mural purpose of purifying the nation in order to enablethe world as a whole to connect to the Divine. Defying Christianinterpretation and Jewish reticence, Ha-Levi embraces Isaiah’s imageof the Jewish people as a servant whose suffering is redemptive for allhumankind.40Part One"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"3. Levels of IttiÓs ̄al:Individual and Communal, Elite andNoneliteHa-Levi thus distinguishes three levels of ittiÓs ̄al: The broadest level isuniversal ittiÓs ̄al, facilitated through God’s connection with Israel; thesecond level is God’s guidance of and providence over the Jewish people;a third level is God’s special relationship with the prophets and pious,who witness God directly.As theÓHavertells the King:[While] [God’s] ™amrand governance93connect [yattaÓsilu] with human be-ings [as a whole] . . . the select [Ósafwa] connect [yattaÓsilu] with God to thepoint that they witness him by means of the Glory, Shekhinah, and othersuch manifestations by which he proves to them that they had been ad-dressed by him on High. (IV:3: 149)Ha-Levi’s notion of communal ittiÓs ̄aldoes not, then, supersede orreplace individual ittiÓs ̄al, either historically or conceptually. Just as thefounding figures of the Biblical nation had individual encounters withGod, so, too, the prophets and the pious continue to have moments ofpersonal communion with the Divine.94In the event at Mount Sinai,moreover, the nation as a whole experienced this intensity of contactwith the Divine.95The individual and communal forms of ittiÓs ̄alwork hand in hand forHa-Levi. Ha-Levi underscores this point rhetorically when theÓHaverdescribes the pious person’s prayers, in a passage cited earlier:One who unites all this with pure intention96is a true Israelite, and it is fit-ting for him to aspire to ittiÓs ̄alwith the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı, which is connected [al-muttaÓsil] to the Children of Israel to the exclusion of the other nations. Hefinds no difficulty in standing in the presence of the Shekhinah. And whenhe asks, he is answered. (III:17: 105)Participation in the regular communal prayer service with pure inten-tion prepares one for a deeper, more personal contact with God. How-ever, God is already connected to Israel as a whole; this ittiÓs ̄alis indeedthe basis for the religious life of the community. Those for whom individ-ual ittiÓs ̄almight be too powerful can take heart in knowing that the ™a m ril ̄ ah ̄ıis already connected (muttaÓsil) with all the Children of Israel, a giftthat need not be earned by individual attainment. On the other hand, it isGod’s connection with the community as a whole that provides the struc-ture and foundation for personal ittiÓs ̄al. Communal prayer is not an im-pediment but a vehicle for individual religious experience.The Language of Relationship41"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"4.IttiÓs ̄alas CovenantalHa-Levi’s telling of the story of Abraham introduced an additional twistto his use of the term ittiÓs ̄al: Ha-Levi uses covenantal language and im-agery to describe both individual and communal ittiÓs ̄al. While the phi-losophers and Sufis used the term to suggest ontological union, Ha-Levistresses that the Jewish connection to God is a covenant—a relationshipbetween two parties, requiring commitment, loyalty, and obedience. TheÓHavertells the king:The ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıfound next to the stars and spheres only a few individualpeople between Adam and Jacob who accepted his command obediently[q ̄abil ̄a t ̄a™i¡an] and clung to the order he had decreed. When they had be-come a people, the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ırested on them out of love, “in order to be aGod to them.” (III:17: 104 – 5)The obedience of the Israelite ancestors forges a connection for the en-tire community of Israel, among whom God chooses to dwell.The notion of obedient acceptance (iltiz ̄am Ót ̄a¡a; here, q ̄abil ̄a t ̄ a™i¡an)is used in Islam to describe acts of devotion beyond the required five pil-lars of Islam; early handbooks of Sufism assert that the pious ones spentdays in acts of obedience. Moreover Ha-Levi had Judaeo-Arabic prece-dents for adoption of this phrase: Sa¡adya uses similar language in hisArabic translation of Biblical passages enjoining the Jews to cling toGod. Unlike many later medieval thinkers, for whom the noun devequt(clinging) became an important mystical term, Sa¡adya interprets theTorah’s injunction to cling to God (u-le-dovqa-vo) in a decidedly non-mystical sense: Jews are commanded to cling in obedience (l ̄azim ̄ınaÓt ̄ a¡a) to God’s ways.97Ba Óhya ibn Paq ̄uda offers another Judaeo-Arabicprecedent to Ha-Levi; he devotes a section of his Sufi-flavored manual tothe importance of worshipful service (iltiz ̄am t ̄a¡a; ¡avodat Ha-shem).98Ha-Levi also echoes the phrase in a parable about a visit to the king ofIndia (I:109: 37– 38). Drawing on conventions of the vassal-lord relation-ship, Ha-Levi’s parable demonstrates clearly that obedience to the Kingbrings connection (ittiÓs ̄al), arrival (wuÓs ̄ul), and ultimate happiness.99Ha-Levi’s parable abounds with Islamic terminology, which he usesto show that the Jewish path to ittiÓs ̄alis wholly covenantal and based onobeying commandments. The king of India recognizes an early visitor tothe king—whom theÓHaveridentifies as Moses—because his ancestors(the patriarchs) had been among the king’s companions (awliy ̄a’i; sing:wal ̄ıy—a frequent Islamic term for pious companions of God). Once the42Part One"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"traveler has accepted obedience (t ̄a¡a) to him, the king charges thetraveler with commands and covenants;100he then sends the traveler offwith messengers, the prophets.101The solicitude of these messengers,who guide subsequent pilgrims along the shortest and most direct path,allows the traveler’s friends to more easily reach (wuÓs ̄ul ™il ̄a) India andsee the king.The terms ittiÓs ̄aland wuÓs ̄ul, of course, are used by Sufis to describefinal arrival in the Divine. Ha-Levi describes seeing the king using theterm ru’ya, a standard Islamic term for the beatific vision of God. He de-scribes the solicitude of God’s messengers as ‘in ̄ aya, the Arabic philo-sophical term for divine providence; he depicts their guidance along thepath to the king with Qur™ ̄anic roots declaring divine guidance (h-d-yand r-sh-d). TheÓHaverdescribes the path they travel to the king as theÓtar ̄ıq, a less common Arabic term for the Sufi path or way (Ótar ̄ıqa).102TheÓHavercontinues:All of them knew that it would be made easy [for] one who wishes to reach[wuÓs ̄ul ™il ̄a] India [if he would] take upon himself obedience [iltazamaÓt ̄ a¡a] to the king and honor his messengers who bring him into contact[muwaÓsÓsil ̄ına]103with [the king]. And they did not need to ask: why go tothe trouble to [take upon oneself] this obedience [Ót ̄ a¡a]? For the reason wasclearly apparent: to make contact [li-yattaÓsila] with the King—and thatconnection [ittiÓs ̄al] with him is fulfillment. (I:109: 37)104While Ha-Levi does use the term tar ̄ıq—reminiscent of the SufiÓtar ̄ıqa—to describe the Jewish path to the king, much of the language inthis parable is drawn from mainstream Islamic thought. Ha-Levi usesthe common terminology of Islamic pietism to emphasize that it is thecommandments themselves that bring ittiÓs ̄al; this path is not supersededor replaced by spiritual exercises or antinomian mysticism, as it wasamong the more radical Sufis. As theÓHaverexplains, later Jews reach(waÓsala ™il ̄a) the king by following the path forged by the prophets andobeying the covenant God establishes with them—ultimately, by obedi-ence to the King (iltiz ̄am Ót ̄a¡at al-malik).What do we make of Ha-Levi’s language of obedience? We have seenthat Sa¡adya uses the phrase “clinging in obedience” (l ̄azimina Ót ̄a¡a) totranslate the Biblical admonition to cling to God. However, other med-ieval thinkers went much further. The same Biblical language gave thema Hebrew term—devequt—to express direct cognitive and mysticalunion.105It is thus significant that Ha-Levi adopts Sa¡adya’s conservativerendering of devequtas clinging in obedience (iltiz ̄am t ̄a¡a), particularlyThe Language of Relationship43"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"when speaking of those who finally arrive at (waÓsala ™il ̄a) the king. Un-like Avicenna, for example, who describes Sufi arrival (wuÓs ̄ul) as unitiveabsorption in the one Truth that is God, Ha-Levi here describes arrivalin a language of respectful obedience, rather than direct clinging.106TheÓHaveruses similar caution when explaining the divine Name“Qedosh Yisrael,” Holy One of Israel. Qedosh Yisraelhe says is “a namefor the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıwhich is attached [muttaÓsil] to Israel [i.e., Jacob], andafter him, to his descendants, an ittiÓs ̄alof guidance and governance, notan ittiÓs ̄alof clinging and contact”107(IV:3: 151).The contrast drawn here reflects two conceptions of ittiÓs ̄aldebatedin the Islamic world: an ittiÓs ̄alin which God remains separate and abovethe individual soul—an ittiÓs ̄alof governance and guidance—or an ittiÓs ̄alwhich is a connection of absolute equality, union, and adhesion betweenthe devotee and the Divine. Perhaps Ha-Levi wants to suggest that di-vine contact is most safe when it is distant and providential attachment,rather than direct and unitive adhesion, which is fraught with dangers,at least for most ordinary Jews.108Similarly, Ha-Levi uses the metaphorof the sun to describe ittiÓs ̄alat a safe distance for the nonelite of Israel;the sun, whose light can mystically penetrate, can also scorch and burn.Providential ittiÓs ̄alis safer than the more direct, intense form of ittiÓs ̄alexperienced by the prophets, but is no less to be accounted communionwith the Divine.Ha-Levi thus portrays Jewish ittiÓs ̄alas existing on a continuumranging from simple obedience to communion with the Shekhinah. Byusing the term ittiÓs ̄alin such a broad-stroked fashion, Ha-Levi suggeststhat the entire continuum of religious experience is crucial for drawingthe ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıto dwell among the Israelites and for establishing God’sLaw on earth. The ittiÓs ̄alof ordinary Jews who cling in obedience toGod’s ways—by observing God’s commandments or imitating God’s ac-tions—is as necessary as the ittiÓs ̄alof the prophets and pious of Israel,who bask in the presence of the Shekhinah.1095.IttiÓs ̄alas UnionThere is one passage in which Ha-Levi is less cautious in his approach toittiÓs ̄al. This is a key passage in the Kuzari: it leads to the King’s epiphany inIV:16, where he articulates the difference between the God of Abrahamand the God of Aristotle. Here Ha-Levi draws upon his Sufi lexicon toexpress the love, longing, and intimacy a Jew experiences in relationshipwith God. However, we will hold off our analysis of that passage untilwe have examined other terms with which it will come into dialogue.11044Part One"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"D.IttiÓs ̄al, Asceticism, and Mitsvot1. Ha-Levi’s Religious Ideal: Against Asceticism and IsolationColored as it is with classical Jewish thought, Ha-Levi’s conception ofittiÓs ̄alis integrally bound up with a covenental ideal of relationshipwithin community. Traditional Jewish and Islamic thought in generaldid not see a conflict between human relationships and relationship toGod, as both tended to view family and community as integral to relig-ious life. However, with the rise of philosophy and Sufism in the Islamicworld there arose a competing ideal of withdrawal from society toachieve a more intimate relationship with God. Moreover, traditionalJewish and Islamic views held that a person is a unity of body and soul;even resurrection was understood to include the physical body. Philoso-phers and Sufis, on the other hand, came to experience a tensionbetween body and soul, and thus became attracted to asceticism as wellas isolation.111Ba Óhya’s Duties of the Heartdemonstrates that some of Ha-Levi’sJewish contemporaries were also attracted to this approach. But whileBa Óhya’s work was closely modeled on contemporary manuals of Sufipiety, Ba Óhya did not go as far as the Sufi ascetics. Given the emphasis oncommunity in traditional Jewish thought, there were limits to Jewish ac-ceptance of ascetic practices. Even Ba Óhya, the most enthusiastic Jewishadvocate of Sufism up to this time, shows reservations and sets boundar-ies to Sufi asceticism.The strong attraction Sufi ascetic practices held for some contempo-rary Jews leads Ha-Levi to address at some length the question of asceti-cism, to which he takes a subtle, nuanced approach.112While admittingthat in Biblical and rabbinic times there were certain individuals whosuccessfully drew near to God through ascetic practices, he denies thatsuch an approach can succeed today. Most importantly, Ha-Levi rejectsisolation as a valid spiritual ideal; ittiÓs ̄al, he contends, is to be foundtoday in communal life.Ha-Levi’s reinterpretation of ittiÓs ̄alin this way serves a polemicalpurpose. SufiittiÓs ̄alis portrayed as the fruit of a path of self-denial andisolation. Sufism holds up asceticism,113humility and self-abasement,114and isolation as ideal virtues.115Philosophers, too, were commonly asso-ciated with asceticism. TheÓHavernotes that the ancient philosophersseparated themselves ascetically from the world,116while the King pointsout that one who isolates himself ascetically117is called a philosopher.The Language of Relationship45"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Ha-Levi’s creative reinterpretation of the term ittiÓs ̄alcounteractsJewish attraction to these ascetic trends. Ha-Levi appropriates the termittiÓs ̄aland its attendant prestige, applying it to an engaged, communalway of life that is antithetical to the self-deprivation normally associatedwith ittiÓs ̄al. In a brilliant move characteristic of his strategy of argument,Ha-Levi plays off the traditional, ascetic view of ittiÓs ̄alheld by bothSufis and philosophers against another philosophical ideal. Using the Ar-abic terms for temperance (i¡tid ̄al) and justice (¡adl), Ha-Levi embracesthe Platonic and Aristotelian value of moderation against the more dua-listic Neo-Platonic trend of asceticism.The term ¡adlis key in the Arabic philosophical lexicon, for ¡adlisthe term chosen to translate dikaiosyne (justice), the concept under in-vestigation in Plato’s Republic.118What Socrates seeks ultimately is anadequate understanding of justice in the human soul. It is only for peda-gogical purposes that he investigates justice in the state, justice writlarge and thus easier to see.For the Greek philosophers, justice is a balance of conflicting ele-ments. Both Plato and Aristotle preach a moral and psychological idealof moderation, achieved by learning to balance the needs of the variousfaculties of psycheor soul. Ha-Levi gives this ideal his own twist. TheÓHaverasserts:The divine law does not bid us to devote ourselves in service through ascet-icism119but rather through moderation [i¡tid ̄al], giving each faculty of thesoul and body its just [¡adl] share, without overburdening one faculty atthe expense of another. (II:50: 69)Ha-Levi thus embraces one prestigious ideal of the philosophers(i¡tid ̄al) to defeat another (ascetic ittiÓs ̄al), arguing that the Torah teachesa path of moderation, balance, or justice. As a further extension of hisanti-ascetic polemic, theÓHavertells the King that those who isolatethemselves today do not enjoy ittiÓs ̄alwith the divine light; ittiÓs ̄alis notavailable without the presence of the Shekhinah, the Temple, and theland of Israel. Those who experiment with asceticism today to achievereligious experience do so without direct divine guidance, and their ef-forts will come to nought (III:1: 91).Ha-Levi’s readers might therefore conclude that ittiÓs ̄alis completelyout of grasp for contemporary Jews. To counteract this notion, Ha-Leviinsists that there exist institutions which make ittiÓs ̄alavailable in exile—the mitsvot, and most specifically, prayer and Shabbat. After denyingthat ittiÓs ̄alis possible today without the land and the Temple, where the46Part One"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"divine Presence had its abode, theÓHavergoes on to state that prayer andShabbat are specifically reserved for ittiÓs ̄alwith the Divine (™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ı)(III:5: 94).Ha-Levi is thus far from systematically consistent. Rather thancreating a systematic philosophy of religious experience, Ha-Levi ap-pears to be addressing Jews attracted to Sufi isolation and asceticism,whom he believes fail to recognize the spiritual value and significance ofJewish life in community.120In particular, Ha-Levi may want to guardagainst extreme attempts at ittiÓs ̄alby those who think themselves farmore spiritually advanced than they are. Ha-Levi thus denies that theseattempts at ascetic piety will come to fruition in ittiÓs ̄al. At the same time,he asserts that the very communion such Jews seek through asceticismand withdrawal is available through the practice of mitsvotand throughJewish communal life.Ha-Levi is clearly concerned to counter philosophical and Sufi anti-nomianism or indifference to the Law. A major theme in his portrait ofthe philosophers’ path is their indifference to religious law; law for themis just a matter of ethics, and one can just as easily follow a rationalisticethic.121Certain Sufis, too, were well known for claiming that once onehas reached an advanced level of spiritual development, religious law isunnecessary, and in fact may keep one mired in the temporal. Ha-Levithus adds to his creative reinterpretation of ittiÓs ̄althe notion that mits-votare not only not antithetical to religious experience, they are in factessential to the achievement of ittiÓs ̄al. The way to experience commun-ion with God in contemporary Judaism is through the practice of thecommandments, a practice that requires community and that establishesa harmonious balance between action and contemplation.122Ha-Levi returns again and again to the assertion that the way toittiÓs ̄altoday is through mitsvot. TheÓHaverasserts, for example, that1. circumcision is a sign of the covenant—that the ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ıwould attach (yattaÓsila) to Abraham and his descendents(III:7: 96);1232. today Jews connect with God through the mitsvot, whichGod has placed as a bond (Ós ̄ı l a) between Jews and the Di-vine (II:34: 65);3. one comes near to God only through God’s commands; Godalone knows their measure, by whose fulfillment comes thepleasure of God and ittiÓs ̄alwith the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı(III:23: 112);The Language of Relationship47"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"4. if love and joy bring singing and dancing, then this is wor-ship and a bond (Ós ̄ı l a) between the worshiper and the ™a m ril ̄ ah ̄ı(II:50: 70);5. all religious laws have as their promise drawing near to Godand the angels in this life and the next, so that one who hasreached (waÓsala) this level need not fear death (I:109: 36).Ha-Levi emphasizes that Judaism is life-affirming, not life-denying.Afflicting oneself is not the primary way to serve God; one serves Godequally with joy. Nor is isolating oneself and denying the senses the bestway to achieve religious experience. One can equally come to experienceGod in community, even while eating and drinking in fellowship withothers. One’s worship may even involve singing and dancing—a notionthat may suggest some Sufi influence.Ha-Levi rejects isolation as a valid spiritual ideal. Ha-Levi’s concep-tion of ittiÓs ̄alis an engaged ittiÓs ̄al, one which values the fabric of humanrelationships. On the other hand, Ha-Levi acknowledges the need for acertain withdrawal from everyday actions and time for quiet contempla-tion. TheÓHaverasserts that “the three times of [daily] prayer are thefruit of [one’s] day and night, and the Shabbatis the fruit of the week be-cause it is reserved124for ittiÓs ̄alwith the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı, to serve God with joy,not with submissiveness” (III:5: 94).Ha-Levi maintains that Judaism is in fact the one religious Lawthrough whose knowledge and practice one arrives (yuÓsilu—related toittiÓs ̄aland wuÓs ̄ul) at experience of the Divine in this life (I:103: 35).IttiÓs ̄alis not only achieved without asceticism and withdrawal; it isachieved in this world, bringing assurance of ittiÓs ̄alin the world to come.E.IttiÓs ̄al, Immortality, and the Afterlife1. New Challenge: Christian and Orthodox Muslim CritiquesHa-Levi thus uses his reinterpretation of Sufi and philosophical ittiÓs ̄altorespond to a challenge from another direction: the orthodox Muslimand Christian charge that Judaism is a this-worldly religion, one lackingthe promise of an afterlife.Orthodox Muslims by and large do not use the language of ittiÓs ̄alwhen speaking of the afterlife. They focus on God’s promise (wa¡d,maw¡id, or mi¡ ̄ad) of a spiritual journey after death and reward for the48Part One"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"faithful at the end of history.125Sufis and philosophers, on the otherhand, focus upon a philosophical and mystical quest for immortalityand union with God (ittiÓs ̄alor wuÓs ̄ul) achieved in this life through spiri-tual development; it is assumed that union with the Divine achieved inthis life will continue upon leaving the body. Ha-Levi cleverly throwsone opponent against another: he upholds many of the Sufi and philo-sophical values associated with ittiÓs ̄aland juxtaposes them against theOrthodox conception of an afterlife. He argues that the promises ofittiÓs ̄alare themselves the greatest maw ̄a¡id; however these are the prom-ises of a specifically Jewish form of ittiÓs ̄al, one that is communal, this-worldly, and achieved through the life of mitsvot.TheÓHaverresponds to the charge that Judaism lacks promises of anafterlife by arguing first that the fulfillment of Jewish promises (maw ̄a¡id)is very much available in this life: for the elite, ittiÓs ̄alwith the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıby prophecy and prophetic inspiration; for all Jews, ittiÓs ̄alof ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıwith the Jewish nation by providence and wonders and miracles (I:109:36). Ha-Levi thus retains the sense of maw’idas the fulfillment of apromise, while stripping it of its otherworldly connotations as a rewardat the end of time.A motif appearing often in the Qur™ ̄an is the inevitability of the dayof judgment at the end of history: God has made a promise (set an ap-pointed time) (wa¡da m ̄ı¡ ̄ada) that he will not rescind.126Ha-Levi sup-ports his point with an echo of this familiar Qur™ ̄anic phrase when theÓHaverasserts that Judaism (“this Law”) assures the fulfillment of itspromises (al-maw ̄a¡id), so that their rescinding127need not be feared(I:109: 36).Ha-Levi’s contention, however, is that in contrast to the Qur™ ̄an’sappointed time of fulfillment (maw¡id), realization of the Jewish promiseis to be found first of all within history, in the Jews’ special relationshipto God and in God’s guidance of the Jews as a people. TheÓHaverassertsthat a Jew need only reflect on such natural and historical wonders asthe fertility of the Holy Land and the miraculous deliverance of the na-tion from its adversaries. Such reflection reveals that “an order [™a m r]greater than the natural order [™a m r] guides your order [™a m r]; all this,and all these laws—their promises [mawa¡id] are assured, one need notfear that they will be rescinded”128(I:109: 36).There is a special religious connection of ittiÓs ̄albetween God andIsrael in nature and history, whether manifest or hidden, and this in it-self constitutes the fulfillment of the Jewish promise. Ha-Levi suggeststhat religious experience may be subtle, historical, and cumulative aswell as intense and dramatic, that there is a form of ittiÓs ̄alwhose trueThe Language of Relationship49"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"significance as religious experience is revealed only in hindsight, uponreflection.129Moreover, theÓHaverjuxtaposes those who ascend to heaven andthose who witness God’s emissaries fighting for them on earth. The for-mer most probably alludes to visionaries who visit the realm of the di-vine chariot; the latter, to Biblical theophanies and to midrashic imagesof God as a mighty warrior rescuing the Israelites at the Sea of Reeds:130There will be those among you who will come into my presence and ascendto heaven, like those who have moved about131among the angels. Andthere will also be those of my angels moving about on earth. You will seethem, singly and in groups, guarding you and fighting for you. You will re-main in the Land which leads to this degree—that is, the Holy Land. Its fer-tility or barrenness, its happiness or misfortune, depend upon the ™a m ril ̄ ah ̄ı, according to your deeds, while the rest of the world will go accordingto its natural course. (I:109: 36)In the same breath, theÓHavermentions heavenly journeys of merka-vahmystics, Biblical theophanies, witnessing the fertility or barrennessof the Holy Land, and the victory of Israelites over their enemies. Thisjuxaposition of images and mixing of historical times suggests that allthese forms of contact with the Divine are equally reflective of God’spresence, equally to be accounted religious experience.To those critics who charge that Judaism holds an impoverishedimage of the afterlife, Ha-Levi responds with a twist on the Sufi and phil-osophical view of ittiÓs ̄al. Ha-Levi agrees with the Sufis and philosophersthat connection with God experienced in this world assures an abidingconnection in the next. TheÓHaverasserts that a good132person in prayermeditates on [prays for] ittiÓs ̄alwith the divine light in this life. And if heprays in the degree of prophecy—and there is nothing nearer for man toGod than that—there is no doubt that he has prayed for more than theworld to come, and if he achieves it, he also achieves the world to come.For one whose soul is attached [ittaÓsalat nafsuhu] to the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı[while he is still] busy with the accidents of the body, it stands to reasonthat he will join [yattaÓsilu] [the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı] when he withdraws and leavesthis unclean vessel. (III:20: 109)Ha-Levi maintains that all Jews experience some degree of ittiÓs ̄alin this life through God’s providential guidance of the Jewish people.He therefore suggests that Christian and Muslim boasting about theafterlife is superfluous to a people who experience connection with50Part One"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"God in this life. Ha-Levi adds that Jewish literature itself disproves hisopponents’ charge. Jewish sources hold many allusions to the afterlife,and it is in fact from Jewish literature, both Biblical and post-Biblical,that Christianity and Islam draw their images of paradise and hell(I:115: 40).Finally, Ha-Levi contrasts the afterlife portrayed in the Qur™ ̄an toJewish this-worldly fulfillment, once again turning his opponents’ cri-tique on its head. Jewish this-worldly fulfillment, Ha-Levi suggests, is infact more spiritual than the Islamic afterlife: “Thus what is promised inthe Torah as a reward for keeping the Law is not beautiful gardens andgreat delights. God rather says, ‘You will be special to me and I will be toyou a God who will guide you’” (I:109: 36).In Ha-Levi’s view, the fact that Jewish fulfillment exists first of all inthis world does not detract from its spiritual nature. TheÓHaverasserts:The promises [maw ̄a¡id] of this Law are all included under one principle:the anticipation [expectation, hope] of drawing near to the Lord and hisangels. One who has arrived [waÓsala] at this degree need not fear death;our Law has demonstrated this plainly. (I:109: 36)1332. Explanation of Biblical Asceticism and IsolationHa-Levi acknowledges, however, that certain great spiritual figures inthe Biblical Age (Enoch and Elijah, for example) did fruitfully practiceasceticism. They could profit from isolation—which Ha-Levi describesusing Sufi terms134—because their isolation was not complete: asceticshad the companionship (uns) both of fellow seekers and of God and theangels. Since the Jews were still in their Land, true ittiÓs ̄alwith the divinewas available. Moreover, those who practiced asceticism in the BiblicalAge created communities, the schools of prophets135(III:1: 90). Ha-Levimaintains that even people who were not themselves prophets but whoencountered prophets had experiences of the Divine that offered them ataste of the world to come (I:103: 35).Today, however, people who attempt an ascetic path no longerachieve true ittiÓs ̄al. To Jews attracted to Sufi asceticism, Ha-Levi arguesthat the Divine is not as accessible as when Jews dwelt in the Holy Land, thedivine Presence rested upon the Temple, and Jews could achieve prophecy.To Jews attracted to philosophical asceticism, Ha-Levi adds that neitheris wisdom as accessible today as it was to the ancient philosophers:Today [the would-be ascetic] does not connect [yattaÓsil] with the divinelight which would be his companion136like the prophets, nor does he haveThe Language of Relationship51"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"the learning that would enable him to be absorbed in it and enjoy it all therest of his life, as the philosophers did. (III:1: 90)While others might view him or her as genuinely pious, a contem-porary ascetic would grow to hate this world—not because this worldis not holy, but because the human body really longs to be active.Moreover, contemporary ascetics actually long for community. Ascet-ics today do not have the fellowship137of spiritual beings, whereas inancient times ascetics—both prophets and philosophers—lived in com-munity, aiding one another in the pursuit of wisdom and holiness.While asceticism may be mistaken by outsiders for the genuine hum-bling of oneself in submissiveness and contrition,138the ascetic actuallyreflects the misery of sickness139and pious fraud, making oneself ill inthe guise of zealous piety: “One who brings himself into ascetic isola-tion140has brought himself into mental and physical sickness and suf-fering” (III:1: 90).Ha-Levi thus suggests that excessive humility and self-abasement isactually a form of arrogance, a pretense to being more spiritual thanthe average person. In a beautiful play with the sound and rhythm ofthe Arabic language, theÓHaverasserts that today ascetics do not enjoy thedelight of isolation (iltidhadh bi-l-tafarrud), but rather experience themisery of sickness (tadhallul al-amr ̄ad).141While genuine religious expe-rience might lead to a desire for asceticism, asceticism alone does notbring religious experience. Self-imposed isolation and suffering do notbring the authentic communion made possible through the balanced,communal life of mitsvot.1423. National-Historical Suffering and the Christian Argument from HistoryWhile Ha-Levi rejects the Sufi virtues of submissiveness and self-abasement as a vehicle to religious experience if they are self-initiated,his position with respect to the historical, divinely appointed suffering ofthe Jews is more nuanced. Countering the standard Christian argumentfrom history—which holds that the Jews’ degradation and misery in thisworld are proof of the truth of Christianity—theÓHavermaintains that ifthe Jews take their divinely appointed suffering in a spirit of submissionto the divine will (khuÓd ̄u¡an li-llahi) it can indeed draw them closer toGod (I:115: 39). TheÓHaverthus suggests to Jews attracted to the asceticlife that they already reap the spiritual reward of humility by submittingto their historical fate and remaining Jews. They can fulfill the Sufi virtue52Part One"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"of submission as Jews, without taking on an additional path of asceticself-abnegation.TheÓHaverturns the argument from history on its head. To thosewho would deduce from the degradation143and misery144of the Jewishpeople that their spiritual light has been extinguished, he points out thatChristians and Muslims themselves extoll the virtue of humility—exem-plified in the persons of Jesus, MuÓhammad, and their early followers—asa means to draw one near to God (I:113: 38). Those who extoll the spir-itual value of suffering and lowliness cannot point to the Jews’ degradedstatus as a sign of God’s displeasure.The King quotes from the Book of Isaiah to show that the HebrewBible declares that God dwells among the contrite and humble.145More-over he explicates Isaiah using Sufi terminology; Isaiah’s words showthat lowliness (dhilla) and humility (khuÓd ̄u¡) are more appropriate to the™amr il ̄ah ̄ıthan are greatness and pride (IV:22: 171). By interpretingIsaiah in Sufi terms, Ha-Levi appropriates the Sufi language of humility,but refashions it according to Jewish experience. He reframes Sufi hu-mility from an individual context to a national-historical one, and re-stricts the value of lowliness, submissiveness, and suffering to that ap-pointed by God. While inappropriate as a self-initiated path to theDivine, these Sufi virtues are appropriate as a response to divinely ap-pointed suffering and exile, and as such can draw Jews closer to God.TheÓHaverconcedes to the King that only a small minority of Jewsdo take on their degradation (dhull) in a spirit of submission (khuÓd ̄u¡an)to God and to the Torah; that more do not accept their lowly status will-ingly is the Jews’ major weak spot, he concedes. However, for those whodo accept suffering willingly, humility will reap its divine reward. In-deed, theÓHavergoes so far as to say that if all the Jewish people were tobear their suffering in the spirit of submission to the will of God, theMessianic Age would come and the Jews would be redeemed (I:115: 39).TheÓHaverpoints out further that with one word, any Jew living underIslam could convert. Under such circumstances, a Jew’s faithfulness toJudaism in itself attests to his or her surrender to the will of God (I:115:39; IV:23: 172).In literary terms, then, Ha-Levi can have it both ways. The historicaldegradation of the Jews is not a sign that they have been rejected byGod. Jews are bidden to bear the burden of degradation gracefully, for ithas been appointed by God. If God appoints exile and suffering uponthe Jewish people, and if they take this period of exile on themselveswillingly, they will both transform the world around them through thedoing of mitsvotand hasten their own redemption.The Language of Relationship53"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"PART 2The Language of Human StrivingQiy ̄as, Ijtih ̄ad, Taql ̄ıdIn chapter 1, we noted that various groups in the Islamic spherewere diversely interpreting common terms for religious experience. Wesaw that Ha-Levi draws upon a cluster of meanings associated withittiÓs ̄aland wuÓs ̄ul, co-opting and transforming these concepts by redefin-ing them in a Jewish context. In the next two chapters, we will see thatHa-Levi adopts an even more daring strategy with other terms, includ-ing qiy ̄as, ijtih ̄ad, taql ̄ıd, mush ̄ahada, and dhawq. Ha-Levi joins to-gether the disparate meanings of each term, forging innovative links notmade previously by Islamic thinkers, and in the process, builds a globalcritique of his contemporary culture.For example, generalizing from his criticism of qiy ̄asin severalspheres—philosophy, theology, pietism, pagan religion and the oc-cult—Ha-Levi portrays qiy ̄asas illegitimate human striving (ijtih ̄ad),any attempt to reach the Divine by sheer human effort. He rejects suchqiy ̄asand ijtih ̄adin favor of witnessing (mush ̄ahada) and tasting(dhawq) the Divine, that is, direct experience not achieved by humaneffort, but granted by the grace of God. Ha-Levi transforms the termsmush ̄ahadaand dhawq—terms associated in the Islamic world withSufi mystical practices—by employing them to describe Abraham’s en-counters with God and the Jewish nation’s experience at Mount Sinai.These encounters, he will argue, bring us closer to God than any formof human qiy ̄as.To understand Ha-Levi’s critique, we must first examine the variousconnotations of the terms qiy ̄as, ijtih ̄ad,and taql ̄ıdin medieval Islamicculture. We will then be in a position to discern the creative use Ha-Levimakes of these terms, forging a cultural critique more encompassingthan its individual touchstones.55"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"1. Introduction: The Islamic Context of the Term Qiy ̄asIn Islamic legal theory, qiy ̄asis a method of legal analogy whereby oneextends law from cases known from the Qur™ ̄an, the way of the Prophet(sunna), or the consensus of the community (ijm ̄a¡) to the many, variedcircumstances that arise over time. Qiy ̄asis considered a particular formof ijtih ̄ad, personal effort or diligent striving; more specifically, it meansexerting oneself to form an independent opinion in law. A mujtahidissomeone who by intellectual exertion forms his own legal opinions,whereas a muqallid(imitator) is one who adopts the opinion of anotherthrough reliance or imitation (taql ̄ıd).1Legal reasoning or juridical discretion in the broadest sense (ra’y)was practiced in Islam as early as the second Islamic century; its practi-tioners came to be known as the Party of Legal Reasoning (ahl al-ra’y) incontrast to the strict Traditionists (ahl al-Óhad ̄ıth). The Traditionistssought to find justification for any legal decision in the practice of theProphet MuÓhammad himself, discovered in statements which relate hiswords and deeds, when they are supported by a reliable chain of tradi-tion (isn ̄ad). However, in practice, the Traditionists preferred a “weak”tradition (that is, one without concurrent chains of transmission) to astrong analogy (qiy ̄as), such was their suspicion toward use of thehuman intellect in matters of religious law. The Party of Legal Reason-ing, on the other hand, trusted individual intellectual striving (ijtih ̄ad)and the method of legal analogy (qiy ̄as) to creatively derive rulings onnew matters not discussed explicitly in the Qur™ ̄an.2In earlier twentieth-century scholarship it was often written that bythe fourth Islamic century (900 c.e.), the gates of ijtih ̄adwere closed. Aconsensus was reached that jurists could no longer venture independentdecisions, that all legal issues had essentially been satisfactorily decided.From now on all that was possible or necessary in the realm of religiouslaw was imitation or reliance (taql ̄ıd): the unquestioning acceptance ofthe authority and decisions of one’s predecessors. No one in this day andage was thought qualified to exercise his own intellectual analogies(qiy ̄asat), to strive (to be mujtahid) by means of his own independentlegal reasoning. Everyone was now an imitator (muqallid), bound topractice taql ̄ıd, unquestioning reliance.3However, more recent scholarship suggests that this commonly ac-cepted view is inaccurate, that both in theory and practice, there contin-ued to be scholars who met the qualifications of the independent juris-prudent (mujtahid) and actually exercised ijtih ̄adin their judicial rulings,including the renowned eleventh-century theologian al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı.4For56Part Two"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"our purposes, what is significant is that the matter of independent judg-ment—who was qualified to be a mujtahid, the unfortunate necessity fortaql ̄ıd—was under debate in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Amongthe educated classes, taql ̄ıdhad a negative connotation; taql ̄ıdwascontrasted with the independent, innovative, creative spirit of qiy ̄asandijtih ̄ad.5This was particularly so among the philosophers who, as weshall see, adapted these terms to their own field of inquiry.It is fair to say, nevertheless, that by the tenth century the terms ofthe debate had shifted. The great jurisprudent al-Sh ̄afi¡ ̄ı (b. 767 c.e.),called by some the “architect of Islamic Law,” restricted the exercise ofjuridical discretion (ra¡y) to the strict method of analogy (qiy ̄as) alone.At the same time Sh ̄afi¡ ̄ı accepted the Traditions (Óhad ̄ıth) of MuÓham-mad’s practice (sunna)—now regarded as divinely inspired—as a sourceof knowledge of the divine will equal to the Qur™ ̄an. In a certain sense,the Traditionists had won, although by incorporating and subsumingthe arguments of those who upheld independent judicial reasoning. Theorthodox schools of law for the most part accepted individual judicialdiscretion as one of the four roots of Islamic law—along with Qur™ ̄an,the practice of the Prophet (sunna), and the consensus of the community(ijm ̄a¡)—but they narrowly restricted its domain to strict analogy alone.6Moreover, there continued to be vocal opponents of qiy ̄as. D ̄aw ̄udal- Ó Z ̄ahir ̄ı (d. 884)—his monikerÓZ ̄ahir ̄ıdescribes him as “the literal-ist”—avoided reasoning by analogy wherever possible, although even herecognized that recourse to analogy was sometimes necessary. As one ofhis predecessors had explained: “written texts are limited, but the inci-dents of daily life unlimited, and . . . it is impossible for something infi-nite to be enclosed by something finite.”7Al- ÓZ ̄ahir ̄ı preferred, however,to rule based upon the literal content of Qur™ ̄an and traditions alone.The influential orthodox theologian Ibn ÓHazm (d. 1064) upheld the tra-dition of the ÓZ ̄ahir ̄ı school, while the ÓHanbal ̄ı school and the Sh ̄ı¡i jur-ists rejected qiy ̄asabsolutely.8Because of its association with the use of the human intellect, philos-ophers extended the term qiy ̄asfrom the realm of legal reasoning to thatof philosophical reason. Qiy ̄aswas the term they coined for the Aristo-telian syllogism; its meaning was thereby extended not only from legalanalogy to philosophical syllogism, but in a broader sense, to any use oflogic or human intellect to derive truth.9Qiy ̄aswas also indispensible inthe literature of Islamic theology (kal ̄am). The term kal ̄amsimply means“word”; in its technical sense, however, kal ̄amrefers to theology incontradistinction to jurisprudence (fiqh).

Qiy ̄aswas a prime tool of the mutakallim ̄un, for it enabledthem to prove the existence of God inductively, arguing from the knownworld to the necessary existence of its unknown Creator.102. Ha-Levi’s Critique of Qiy ̄asWith this background, we can explore Ha-Levi’s critique of qiy ̄as. Thedebate between the Party of Tradition and the Party of Reason was fo-cused in the sphere of jurisprudence, while the use of qiy ̄aswas debatedin the discrete realms of law, philosophy, and theology. Ha-Levi’s cri-tique, in contrast, extends beyond these discrete spheres to reflect an en-tire religious orientation. Ha-Levi’s critique innovates by viewing qiy ̄asas any human-initiated attempt to bridge the gap between the humanand the Divine. Ha-Levi thus capitalizes on certain negative connota-tions of qiy ̄asnow in the air and applies it to all the spheres to which heextends the term qiy ̄as, including the legal, philosophical, mystical, andoccult spheres. Ha-Levi’s use of qiy ̄asin various ways can be seen toform a coherent pattern:1. In the legal sphere, Ha-Levi criticizes the Karaites for using theirown individual legal analogies (qiy ̄as ̄ at) to interpret revealed law. Ac-cording to Ha-Levi, divine revelation of law, including the oral law, istransmitted by rabbinic tradition. Rabbinic tradition is assured both bythe Sanhedrin’s institutional authority and by divine assistance in its ju-dicial decision making. The Karaite mistakenly believes that he can usehis own legal reasoning to interpret divinely revealed law.2. In the philosophical sphere, Ha-Levi, like al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, seeks toprove that the claims of qiy ̄asin Aristotelian philosophy are pretentiousand overreaching. It is not necessarily that Ha-Levi finds nothing ofvalue in philosophy, but he does consider the claim that qiy ̄asuncoversabsolute truth to be misguided.3. In the sphere of mysticism and pietism, Ha-Levi innovates byusing the concepts of qiy ̄asand ijtih ̄adto refer to any systematic or Sufi-like program for the cultivation of religious experience. Genuine reli-gious experience may lead to a desire for asceticism; however, it is ille-gitimate and idolatrous to follow an ascetic program of one’s ownhuman invention. Ha-Levi also innovates by describing asceticism,monasticism, and isolation as supererogatory pietism, forms of worshipnot commanded by God. Ha-Levi thus includes all forms of extra humil-ity and self-abasement under his global critique of qiy ̄asand ijtih ̄ad: asself-initiated, self-invented attempts to draw close to the Divine.58Part Two"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Philosophers, like Sufis, used qiy ̄asto achieve a unitive experience.Ha-Levi’s critique of qiy ̄asextends to any attempt to plan one’s own reg-imen for the cultivation of religious experience, whether philosophical,mystical, or pietistic.4. In the sphere of the occult, Ha-Levi also innovates by using theterms qiy ̄asand ijtih ̄adto extend his critique to magical and occult prac-tices—astrology, alchemy, necromancy, and other methods of divina-tion—through which individuals attempt to discern and influence the di-vine will, to bring down the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıinto human experience.The belief that human beings can force the divine will through theirown self-invented formulas marks a common denominator between “so-phisticated” forms of qiy ̄as, such as philosophy, and the qiy ̄asof pagancults. Ha-Levi’s rhetorical innovation is to discredit the qiy ̄asof law, phi-losophy, mysticism, and asceticism by associating qiy ̄aswith the dis-dained formulas of pagan practices.A.Qiy ̄as:The Legal Context1. R. Sa¡adya’s Critique of Karaite Qiy ̄asAn anti-Karaite polemic was central to the Kuzarifrom its inception; weknow from Ha-Levi’s letter to his friend ÓHalfon that the Kuzaribegan inthe context of a debate with a Karaite.11We know, too, that the Karaitesadopted much from Islamic legal theory and were known for their use ofqiy ̄as. Whereas the Rabbanites had a large body of law upon which todraw, encompassing centuries of continuous legal development and the-ory, the Karaites, claiming to be pure Biblicists, were forced to rely muchmore on qiy ̄asto decide cases not mentioned explicitly in the Torah.12Prior to Ha-Levi, R. Sa¡adya Gaon had already made a frontal at-tack on Karaite use of qiy ̄as, most specifically, on Karaite use of qiy ̄astoderive particular laws—the “branches”—from those revelational lawsgiven in the Torah, the “roots.”13Sa¡adya frames his attack on the Ka-raites in Islamic terms derived from the debate within the Islamic legalcommunity between the Party of Tradition and the Party of Legal Rea-soning. He describes the rabbis solely as bearers (naqal ̄una) of tradition(naql), denying that they innovate legally (yajtahid ̄una) or set forth theirindividual opinions (‘ar ̄ a’ahum, sing. ray’) as do the Karaites throughtheir reliance upon the method of qiy ̄as.14Sa¡adya thus denies outright that the rabbis actually use qiy ̄as.

Sa¡adya sketches aportrait of the rabbis that minimizes their use of legal reason, suggestingthat the rabbis do not create law, but simply hand down law by tradi-tion.15He argues further that God has ordained one law, and the role ofrabbinic tradition is simply to transmit that law, not to elaborate or de-velop it.16Thus the Karaite use of qiy ̄asleads to anarchy in halakhah, anaffront to the will of God. Moshe Zucker has shown that both the gen-eral vocabulary of Sa¡adya’s polemic and the actual arguments he useshave close parallels in the Islamic world, in the arguments against the ju-ridical use of qiy ̄asby such Muslim traditionalists as D ̄aw ̄ud al- ÓZ ̄ahir ̄ı,Ibn Qutayba, and Ibn ÓHazm.17Sa¡adya’s critique of Karaite qiy ̄asis organized around three majorpoints:1. One cannot use qiy ̄asto discover details of laws given byrevelation.2. The rabbis do not in fact use qiy ̄asto develop law at all; thethirteen hermeneutical principles are patterns the rabbis dis-cover in the halakhah, rather than rational principles theyuse to derive law.3.Qiy ̄asleads to legal anarchy, whereas there is in fact onlyone true law commanded by God.2. Strategies of Ha-Levi’s Critique of the KaraitesHa-Levi builds on Sa¡adya’s arguments and, responding to anti-Rabbanite polemics, develops his own nuanced critique of the Karaites.One of the standard charges in Karaite polemics is that rabbinic litera-ture, while claiming to represent received tradition, is actually rife withunresolved controversies. Ha-Levi’s response to this charge is to pushback the question of consensus to the period of the Second Temple.Rather than focusing on the post-Sanhedrin period where the majorityof controversies are found, Ha-Levi points to the absolute consensusthat he maintains existed throughout the entire Second Temple period.Ha-Levi thus traces the source of rabbinic consensus and institutionalauthority to the period in which the Sanhedrin sat within the JerusalemTemple, and attributes the breakdown of consensus to the loss of theSanhedrin. Like Sa¡adya, Ha-Levi maintains that disputes from the early60Part Two"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Mishnaic period on are just details which do not affect the main lines oftradition.18Moreover the fact that the Sanhedrin sat in the JerusalemTemple is not incidental for Ha-Levi; the “place which the Lord shallchoose” is the abode of the Shekhinah. Ha-Levi maintains that the San-hedrin received divine assistance in their interpretation of law, whichguaranteed the correct decision.19A second Karaite charge to which Ha-Levi responds is one set forthby the tenth-century Karaite Qirqis ̄an ̄ı specifically in response to Sa¡-adya’s anti-Karaite writings. Qirqis ̄an ̄ı points out that when Sa¡adya at-tacks Karaite use of qiy ̄as, he is actually rejecting an exegetical methodof the rabbis, heqesh(analogy)—one of R. Ishmael’s thirteen principlesby which the Torah is interpreted.20A late-tenth-century Karaite au-thor, Yefet b. ¡El ̄ı, argues similarly that while Sa¡adya on the one handrejects the use of analogy in halakhah, on the other hand he upholds therabbis’ teachings21in the Mishnah and Talmud, which are themselvesbuilt upon inference,22including the thirteen hermeneutical principles.“Thus,” writes Yefet, “[Sa¡adya] is like the person who says: The wordsof So and So are false, but I believe them because So and So saidthem.”23In several nuanced ways, Ha-Levi counteracts the Karaite argumentthat the rabbis themselves, like the Karaites, use qiy ̄as. Ha-Levi’s ap-proach is a variation on a standard medieval defense of rabbinic exege-sis: the assertion that rabbinic exegeses (derashot) are in fact just a sup-port (asmakhta) for laws known independently by received tradition.Ha-Levi makes this argument, however, using Islamic terminology.The Khazar King asserts that even if the Sages should appear to derivesome legal opinions through the use of qiy ̄as, these conclusions are sup-ported by (musnad ™il ̄a) a tradition (naql) from the prophets (III:38).Ha-Levi’s Arabic readers would be aware that in Islamic law, to verifythe authenticity of a Prophetic tradition, one must invoke a chain of au-thority as a support (isn ̄ad). Through his Arabic terminology, Ha-Levitherefore suggests that the conclusions of rabbinic reasoning are in factsupported by sound tradition—tradition which meets standards of au-thenticity respected in the Islamic world.This approach, of course, harkens back to that of Sa¡adya. Sa¡adya’sattitude toward midrash halakhahhad a decisive impact on the medievalJewish tradition, particularly in the Islamic sphere. As we have seen,Sa¡adya argues that details of the Law required for Jewish practice can-not be discerned from Scripture itself.24How then does he account forapparent rabbinic attempts to derive such details of law from Scripture?Drawing upon the Talmudic concept of asmakhta, he argues that suchThe Language of Human Striving61"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"derashotrepresent mere supports or mnemonic devices (asmakhtot) forlaws known independently by tradition.However, Sa¡adya has given the Talmudic concept of asmakhtaanew twist. In the Talmud, the term describes exegesis used to support alaw regarded as binding by the authority of the rabbis. Sa¡adya, how-ever, uses the term for the exegesis underlying laws deemed to haveScriptural authority as well. Sa¡adya therefore denies categorically thatthe Sages use legal exegesis; the rabbis are simply bearers of tradition.The thirteen hermeneutical principles that the rabbis use to interpret theTorah represent patterns the rabbis discover in the halakhah, rather thanprinciples they use to derive law.25Ha-Levi is thus following in the footsteps of Sa¡adya when he sug-gests that rabbinic qiy ̄asis actually supported by a tradition from theprophets. His view is not simply a restatement of Sa¡adya’s, however,as becomes apparent in III:68 – 73, where he presents a two-fold posi-tion on rabbinic exegesis. The Khazar king protests that qiy ̄as(here,probably something like common sense) rejects as absurd the rabbis’interpretation of verses. TheÓHaverreplies that given the precision ofthe Sages’ halakhic interpretation, can one imagine (a-fa-yuq ̄as—re-lated to qiy ̄as) that they are ignorant of what we know about Biblicalverses (III:71: 143)? In a clever rhetorical twist, the King protests withpuzzlement that whereas the Talmudic rabbis’ interpretation of laws26is always congruent with qiy ̄as, their interpretation of verses in theTorah27rarely accords with qiy ̄as. This leaves two alternatives: eitherwe are ignorant of the rabbis’ method of interpreting the Torah, orthose who interpreted the Torah were not those who interpreted thehalakhah.TheÓHaverreplies with two alternatives of his own. Either the rabbispossessed by tradition (naqlan) some secret methods for applying thethirteen hermeneutical principles, or their interpretations are just sup-ports; they used the verses of the Torah as a mnemonic device for aninterpretation they had received by tradition (naql) (III:73: 143). Which-ever is the case, it is necessary to rely on the Sages,28given their knowl-edge, piety, diligence,29and their great number, which makes the notionof collusion impossible.This picture is less rigid and more complex than that of Sa¡adya.Ha-Levi’s language might even open the possibility that the rabbis useqiy ̄asto engage in creative legal decision making. Nevertheless, theÓHavermakes clear that when the Sages appear to use qiy ̄as, their qiy ̄asis in fact supported by a tradition (naql) from the prophets (III:38:121). The rabbis’ comments on Scripture seem mysterious to us only62Part Two"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"because they are at times based upon traditions or principles of whichwe are ignorant.30We simply do not have all the evidence we need tounderstand rabbinic exegesis.Ha-Levi’s defense of rabbinic tradition thus contains several inter-woven threads. Divine revelation of law is transmitted by rabbinic tra-dition. The main lines of rabbinic tradition can be traced to the earlyMishnaic period, when the Sanhedrin sat within the Jerusalem Temple.There are four supports that assure the truth of the assertions of theSages:a. The institutional authorityof the Sanhedrin.b.Divine assistancein the Sanhedrin’s judicial decision making.c.Consensusof a full scholarly community both within eachgeneration and across generations.d.Rabbinic traditions, which support any legal opinions theSages might arrive at independently through the use ofqiy ̄as. If we do not understand the rabbis’ reasoning, it mustbe because we are lacking knowledge of some tradition(naql) that would explain their methodology.Ha-Levi criticizes Karaite qiy ̄asas lacking these four supports. In ad-dition he argues that when it comes to interpreting divinely revealed law,qiy ̄asis completely out of its league.31Finally, theÓHaverpoints out thatthe Karaites achieve consensus only when they rely upon Karaite tradi-tion.32However, if they must rely upon tradition, they would be best offaccepting that of the Sages, which is the most reliable.Sa¡adya held a strict asmakhtatheory of rabbinic exegesis: accord-ing to Sa¡adya, the rabbis use the thirteen hermeneutical principles notto derive law, but rather to find support in the Torah for independentlyknown traditions. Ha-Levi’s version of the asmakhtatheory expandsupon that of Sa¡adya, adding that the rabbis may have possessed tradi-tions and methods of interpretation that are lost to us today. Ha-Levithus echoes Sa¡adya in pointing to the inadequacy of qiy ̄asto interpretrevealed law. However, Ha-Levi goes beyond Sa¡adya’s focus on tradi-tion: he invokes as a source of authority not only rabbinic consensusdating from the period of the Second Temple, but actual divine inspira-tion of the Sanhedrin. Ha-Levi broadens Sa¡adya’s attack on the Ka-raites by grounding rabbinic law not only in received tradition, but incontinued divine inspiration.The Language of Human Striving63"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"3. Ha-Levi’s Response to Karaite Legal Anarchy; His Ironic Use of Taql ̄ıdThe Karaites accused the rabbis of adding to the Torah through Talmu-dic legislation, violating the prohibition of Deuteronomy 13:1, “Youshall not add to or take away from it.”33In a clever rhetorical twist, Ha-Levi turns this Karaite criticism back against the Karaites. He arguesthat this prohibition was in fact intended to proscribe the use of qiy ̄asbyindividuals other than the Sanhedrin, so that unauthorized individualsnot “pretentiously exercise their intellects,34pretend to be wise [or: playthe judge],35and themselves contrive laws by [their own] analogies(qiy ̄as ̄ at) as the Karaites do” (III:41: 124).The Karaites further challenged the authority of rabbinic traditionon the ground that there is no certainty in the Talmud, owing to theprevalence of unresolved controversies. Like Sa¡adya, Ha-Levi arguesthat it is the Karaite free exercise of qiy ̄asthat in fact results in anarchy;even one individual “will not remain with one law, for a new opinionwill appear to him every day as he increases his knowledge or meetssomeone with a new argument who converts him to his opinion” (III:38:120).36The King points out that when there is consensus rather than diver-gence among Karaites, one knows that “they are relying (muqallid ̄una)upon one or many of their predecessors” (120). Ha-Levi derives his ter-minology from Islamic legal theory, from the distinction between thosequalified to formulate law independently (mujtahid ̄una) and those whoare bound to rely on the authoritative opinions of others (muqallid ̄una,“imitators”), who are only permitted unquestioning reliance (taql ̄ıd).As we have noted, intellectuals had given taql ̄ıda pejorative conno-tation of servile intellectual conformity; taql ̄ıdwas contrasted with theindependent, innovative, creative spirit of qiy ̄asand ijtih ̄ad.37Ha-Leviuses the pejorative connotations of the term taql ̄ıdironically, arguingthat although the Karaites criticize the Rabbanites for their relianceupon tradition, the Karaites themselves ultimately are bound to taql ̄ıdas well.Ha-Levi’s dialogue builds upon arguments for the necessity of tradi-tion found in rabbinic sources and formalized during the period of thegaonim, most particularly in the letter of R. Hai Gaon (939 – 1038).38TheÓHaverprods the Khazar King to concede that the Karaites, like therabbis, believe the written Torah is authentic and trustworthy. In orderto have a completely trustworthy text, the King admits, a communitymust rely upon the judgment of someone divinely assisted,39if not a64Part Two"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"prophet. If this is required for the correct punctuation and vocalizationof the Torah, it is necessary all the more for the meaning40of the text.The community needs an interpretive tradition that is completely trust-worthy because its source is divine, and must follow it faithfully.41Thenecessity of taql ̄ıdfor the written text of the Torah proves its necessity—for Karaites no less than Rabbanites—for the Torah’s interpretation aswell. The Karaites, like the rabbis, are bound to rely on the authority oftheir predecessors; it should come as no surprise, then, that historicallythis is the case.4. Ha-Levi’s Critique of Karaite Ijitih ̄adR. Sa¡adya is intent on denying that the Sages exercise (yajtahid ̄una)their own opinions.42Ha-Levi picks up Sa¡adya’s critique of Karaiteijtih ̄adand develops it. The Khazar King is initially impressed by Karaiteijtih ̄ad, but after hearing theÓHaver’s critique of Karaite legal theory, hemakes a startling concession. The Karaite can never be totally secure inhis religious observance, the King admits, because as far as his diligence(ijtih ̄ad) extends, he knows the laws he practices are the result of his ownpretentious analogizing (taqayyus)43and “playing the judge.”44TheRabbanite, in contrast, knows that his Law is transmitted,45based upona sound chain of tradition (isn ̄ad) from trustworthy individuals whoseknowledge is from God (III:50: 131).Ha-Levi thus plays off two senses of the term ijtih ̄ad: a nontechnicalsense of zealous religious devotion, and its unarticulated echo, the tech-nical sense of individually initiated legislation. Ha-Levi suggests that forall his religious devotion, the Karaite is haunted by the knowledge thatthe “commandments” he practices are in truth the product of his ownintellect—a subtle form of idolatry.Ha-Levi’s foil to ijtih ̄adis a standard Islamic foil: true, transmittedtradition (naql) supported by a chain of reliable authority (isn ̄ad). The Ka-raite knows there are many among the nations more diligent in striving(mujtahid ̄una) than he (III:50: 131). The King himself is said to be verydiligent (mujtahid) in the pagan Khazar religion, but discovers diligencealone is not sufficient (I:1: 3). Ha-Levi has thus extended the term ijtih ̄adbeyond its strict legal context of freedom to innovate law creatively. Byusing the term in a less technically precise sense to signify any kind of re-ligious striving, any human-initiated effort in religious matters, Ha-Levihas extended his critique beyond that of the Muslim Traditionists.To the King’s admiration of Karaite ijtih ̄ad, theÓHaverrespondsthat the Karaites are like wanderers in the wilderness who must alwaysThe Language of Human Striving65"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"be vigilant and properly armed lest they be attacked by robbers, whilethe rabbis can rest content upon their beds of taql ̄ıd, safe and secure.46TheÓHaverhere explicitly calls the rabbis “those upon whom we rely”(or “those whom we imitate”) (al-muqallad ̄una), in comparison with theKaraites, whom he concedes show greater individual initiative (ijtih ̄ad).However he sees the Karaites’ greater ijtih ̄adas a defensive anxiety, asign of the weakness of their position rather than a sign of strength. Withbiting irony, Ha-Levi exploits the pejorative connotation of taql ̄ıdas un-thinking, slavish obedience. The lesser effort of the rabbis and those whorely upon them is not a sign of intellectual laziness but of certainty.There are times, however, when Ha-Levi uses the term ijtih ̄adposi-tively; he praises diligence when it has a preservative, rather than an in-novative function. The King affirms with theÓHaverthat the work of theMasoretes, who preserve the tradition of the text of the Torah, is notsuperfluous and idle work, but rather an effort (ijtih ̄ad) in that which isobligatory.47TheÓHaveralso points to the Sages’ diligence with rever-ence, as proof of their reliability as bearers of tradition: “What need isthere for me to point out to you these (halakhic) details after I’ve toldyou the necessity for reliance (on tradition) (taql ̄ıd), the trustworthi-ness48of those upon whom we rely (i. e., the rabbis) (al-muqallad ̄ına),their greatness and their diligence (ijtih ̄ad)?”49Elsewhere, he points to the Sages’ ijtih ̄adas proof of their reliabilityas Biblical exegetes, despite certain puzzling examples of rabbinic Bibli-cal exegesis: “Relying on the Sages is necessary, considering the sound-ness of their wisdom, piety, and diligence [ijtih ̄ad] and their great num-ber, which does not permit collusion. Therefore, we should not doubttheir words, but our understanding.” He points out that the very factthat we possess these traditions of exegesis is due to the ijtih ̄adof disci-ples who recorded carefully the words of their teachers.50Finally, theÓHaversuggests that is need for a kind of spiritual ijtih ̄adin private religious life, to be distinguished from the ijtih ̄adwhich theKaraites exercise in the interpretation of law. The rabbis adhere to strictboundaries in religious law, to the parameters of legal study or investiga-tion. At times this approach will yield legal loopholes that are off-putting to the religious sensibility. There is thus a need for the individualto exercise a kind of ijtih ̄ad, to exert him or herself beyond the letter ofthe law, so as not to take advantage in practice of every loophole that ispermitted in theory.51TheÓHavermaintains that the Karaites, in contrast, work primarilyfrom ijtih ̄adin their legal interpretation, with no respect for the boun-daries of strict law. Their qiy ̄ascan thus lead them to overstep the limits66Part Two"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"of commandments as spelled out in the Torah (III:49: 128 – 29). Whilethere is a place for ijtih ̄adin personal religious life, legal qiy ̄asmust bealways be bounded by the limits of tradition. The king errs, suggests theÓHaver, by mistaking the Karaite’s excessive legal striving for personalspiritual effort. The Rabbanites, who use both approaches—strict legalinvestigation (naÓzar fikhi) and individual spiritual effort (ijtih ̄add ̄ın ̄ı)—are held to be superior to the Karaites, who rely on ijtih ̄adalone(III:50: 131).TheÓHaverasserts that one should not follow one’s own taste andopinion52in reasoning, that these are unique to the individual and willlead to the legal anarchy of the Karaites, whereby one finds in onehouse ten different opinions.53If one wants to undertake legal investi-gation for oneself, one should investigate the roots of laws known fromtradition54and from the Torah,55using the traditional methods of rab-binic interpretation56(i. e., the thirteen hermeneutical principles) totrace the way specific laws are derived through analogies (qiy ̄as ̄ at) usedby the tradition.57Rather than embark upon one’s own path of inter-pretation, one should follow the path of rabbinic logic, retracing thebranches of rabbinic law to their roots in the Torah, and putting one’sfaith in these (III:49: 129 – 30).58Finally, we should note that in his critique of Karaite qiy ̄asandijtih ̄ad, Ha-Levi may be drawing on ascetic as well as legal connotationsof these terms. The Karaites not only innovated legally, but did so bymaking laws of purity more stringent, and by taking on ascetic practicesof self-mortification. We know historically that the mourners of Zion(avale tsion) among the Karaites had admirers among the Rabbanites.59This may be what disturbed Ha-Levi even more than Karaite legal soph-istry: the presumption that rabbinic Judaism was not sufficiently strin-gent and ascetic. Here too, Ha-Levi will argue, the appearance of ijtih ̄adis deceptive. The moderation of the rabbis is a virtue, not a blemish.In summary, theÓHaverargues that Karaite ijtih ̄adin the strict legalsense—the freedom to innovate law—is no virtue, but a sign that Ka-raites lack sound tradition. The Sages exert themselves to preserve theLaw that God has given, not to out-do God by inventing laws of theirown. It is true that personal ijtih ̄adis sometimes necessary to correct forlegal loopholes permitted by the Law. TheÓHaverargues, however, thatwhereas the rabbis respect the limits of tradition, the Karaites’ excessivelegal striving oversteps the boundaries of the Law. It is better to directone’s effort toward tracing rabbinic law to its sources in the Torah,thereby confirming one’s faith in rabbinic tradition.Ha-Levi extends his critique of ijtih ̄adto include any human-initiatedThe Language of Human Striving67"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"effort to reach the Divine. Zealous striving is impressive at first glance,but ijtih ̄adcan be misleading. Authentic spirituality is expressed not inexcessive striving, but in quiet certainty, resting on the bedrock of God-given law and true tradition.B.Qiy ̄as: The Philosophical ContextDespite the fact that the Kuzaribegan as a result of questions from a Ka-raite, as the book stands now, its central opponent is the philosopher.The challenge issued by philosophy is set out in the philosopher’s initialspeech, and serves as a background for all subsequent discussion.60Though the philosopher does not explicitly mention qiy ̄as, Ha-Levi’sreaders would associate qiy ̄aswith the method of philosophical reason-ing and with the philosopher’s raison d’être.As Baneth and others have shown, Ha-Levi, like the Islamic thinkerGhazz ̄al ̄ı, sought to prove that the claims of Aristotelian philosophywere pretentious and overreaching. It is not necessarily that Ha-Levifound nothing good in philosophy, but he did consider misguided theclaim that qiy ̄ascould discover absolute truth.Ha-Levi’s attack on qiy ̄asis a unifying theme throughout the Kuzari:his rhetorical strategy is to use the negative associations he establishesfor qiy ̄asin one area to taint other spheres. Ha-Levi’s critique of qiy ̄asinthe legal sphere, which we have examined, will find echoes in the realmof philosophy. Moreover, the terminology of qiy ̄asand ijtih ̄adis a linkthat unifies the themes of the book.61Using these terms, Ha-Levi empha-sizes that God reaches humanity through revelation and prophecy, whilehumans go astray when they approach the Divine using their own judg-ment and reasoning.1. Philosophical Reliance on Qiy ̄asHa-Levi turns the tables on those who would charge Judaism with alack of philosophical sophistication. In fact, argues theÓHaver, philoso-phers mistakenly turn to qiy ̄aswith questions that cannot be resolvedby reason alone; they resort to this inadequate tool because they lackdivine assistance and reliable tradition. We should not, then, be dazzledby the brilliance of philosophical proof, but should look deeper. Thephilosophers overcompensate because of a serious lack; they extend theintellect beyond its proper sphere precisely because they lack prophecyand divine light (I:65: 17; V:14: 212).68Part Two"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Ha-Levi thus establishes a parallel between theÓHaver’s critique ofthe philosophers and his critique of the Karaites. Both philosophers andKaraites over-rely on qiy ̄asbecause they lack authentic tradition basedin revelation. However, qiy ̄asis out of its proper bounds in metaphysicalmatters, just as it is in matters of religious law. TheÓHaverdeclares sev-eral times that the philosophers should not be blamed, for they did thebest they could; since their knowledge only came by way of qiy ̄as, theirresults could not but be flawed.622. Inadequacy of the Method of Qiy ̄asHa-Levi takes shots at the philosophical method in a variety of contexts,showing that it is a less accurate tool than the philosophers haveclaimed. Philosophers can use qiy ̄asto prove whatever they set out toprove.63For example, there is no decisive proof of whether the world iseternal or was created in time. The philosophers happen to give prefer-ence to those syllogisms (qiy ̄as ̄ at) which argue in favor of eternity; theyerr in this case by seeking to resolve the question through reason alone.64If they had lived among a nation with an authentic, irrefutable chronol-ogy, they would have used their syllogisms and proofs to establish crea-tion instead. Authentic tradition (naql) from the prophets testifies to thecreation of the world, and prophecy is more reliable than qiy ̄as.65We seehere the parallel between Ha-Levi’s arguments in law and philosophy: inboth, theÓHavercontrasts naql—authentic, reliable tradition—with un-reliable human qiy ̄as.66Similarly, theÓHaverargues that God has given prophets the abilityto grasp mysteries of the universe67that God has not granted ordinaryhuman beings to know by qiy ̄asalone. The evidence of prophetic tradi-tion on such matters therefore outweighs the speculation of qiy ̄as(V:14:211– 12).Not only can philosophers prove anything they set out to prove, butphilosophers’ criteria for what is acceptable as a premise or conclusion iswhat they have encountered in nature. The only reason philosophers didnot affirm such accounts as the vision68of Elijah is because “those things(that are) not perceived by the logical method (qiy ̄asan), the Greek phi-losophers nullified—for qiy ̄asdeclares absurd anything it has not seenthe likes of.” TheÓHavergoes so far as to argue that if Greek philoso-phers had witnessed the Hebrew prophets at the time of their prophesy-ing and performing miracles, they would have confirmed them andsought means through the logical method (qiy ̄asan) to arrive at that spir-itual level themselves. However, just because one has not encounteredThe Language of Human Striving69"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"something does not mean it is impossible. The fact that a doctrine hasor has not been proven by philosophy says nothing about its truth(IV:3: 157).3. The Need for Divine AssistanceTheÓHaverinsists that human beings cannot attain to all the branches ofknowledge by qiy ̄asalone, without divine assistance (II:64: 78). Themembers of the Sanhedrin were knowledgable in the sciences—presum-ably mathematics and astronomy, those necessary for matters of halak-hahsuch as determination of the calendar—because they had such di-vine aid (III:41: 125). Just as human qiy ̄ason its own cannot achievetruth in law or philosophy, so human qiy ̄ason its own cannot achievetruth in science.Even in scientific matters, then, qiy ̄ascannot match what is seen bythe prophets. The prophets themselves would not have believed the phe-nomena they report in their visions if they had not known them by wayof prophecy, “whose perception69is clearer than qiy ̄as” (IV:3: 156).Prophecy is the touchstone of truth in science no less than in law andmetaphysics (V:14: 211; IV:25: 183).70Once one has attained to prophecy, qiy ̄asbecomes superfluous. SeferYetsirah—ascribed by tradition to Abraham, and regarded as the pinna-cle of Jewish achievement in natural science—Ha-Levi assigns to anearly, philosophical period of Abraham’s life that Abraham abandonswhen he receives prophetic revelation from God. Ha-Levi illustrates thispoint by taking off on a well-known midrash. Once Abraham had a per-sonal encounter with God, theÓHaverdeclares,how could he not deprecate his former qiy ̄as ̄ at? [This is just] as the Sagesexplain, “And he brought him forth outside [to look at the stars]” [Gen15:5] [as meaning] “Give up your astronomy!” That is to say, God com-manded him to give up his scientific studies [¡ul ̄umahu al-qiy ̄asiyya] of thestars and other things, and adhere obediently71to him whom he had cometo perceive by taste, as it says, “Taste and see that the Lord is good.”(IV:17: 169)Similarly, after theÓHaverhas explained the complex theories ofSefer Yetsirahto the King, the King asks why one needs to posit a rolefor the Hebrew letters in creation rather than simply affirming creationby the divine will alone. TheÓHaveragrees, “When God revealed him-self (to Abraham), he gave up all qiy ̄as ̄ at” (IV:26 – 27: 184). Knowing70Part Two"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"God through direct encounter makes Abraham’s philosophical questsuperfluous.Only knowing God through direct encounter or authentic traditioncan remove philosophical skepticism. When a person grasps the realityof God in a way that transcends qiy ̄as, all previous doubts are removed,and one laughs at those qiy ̄as ̄ atby which one had tried to attain knowl-edge of God and the universe (IV:15: 168). The experience of revelationand the tradition that follows from it establish unshakable belief (I:89 –91: 26).72Direct encounter not only gives accurate knowledge of God; itestablishes a personal relationship. One who has discovered God in away that transcends qiy ̄asbecomes a loving servant, willing to make sac-rifices, even to die for God’s sake (IV:15: 168). Abraham is willing to becircumcized at a ripe age (and “how far is circumcision from qiy ̄as!”)and is even willing to suffer martyrdom73for the God he has encoun-tered through the events of his life (III:7: 96).In contrast, the relationship between a philosopher and the Goddiscovered through qiy ̄asis detached—an objective, nonemotional con-nection, similar to the relationship one has to any other object ofknowledge. The philosopher is simply inclined logically (qiy ̄asan) to ac-cept the truth of the proposition “God exists,” rather than being pas-sionately committed to the point of martyrdom. Philosophers, assertstheÓHaver, only acknowledge God so long as their lives are not endan-gered (IV:16: 168 – 69).4. Philosophical Qiy ̄asand Taql ̄ıdThe concept of taql ̄ıdholds up a contrast between the philosopher andthe religious believer as well. We have seen that rationalists in the Is-lamic world regarded taql ̄ıdas a necessary evil, suitable only for personsof weak mental capacity, for those who lack the original mind to pursuetruth through striving (ijtiÓh ̄ad) and logic (qiy ̄as).74Ha-Levi points out,however, that even philosophers operate with a kind of taql ̄ıd.75Philo-sophical traditions are accepted on authority and parrotted just as arereligious traditions.76The sole difference is that Aristotle is held up asthe supreme authority rather than Abraham.Philosophers hold many doctrines that are in fact contrary to qiy ̄as,for example the nonexistence of the vacuum (III: 49: 130) and the no-tion that only philosophers attain immortality (I:110: 38).

If taql ̄ıdis necessary, one might as wellrely upon those who are in fact reliable, namely, the Sages (III:39: 123).Ha-Levi’s argument here parallels his critique of the Karaites. Ha-Levi uses the term taql ̄ıdironically to show that philosophical qiy ̄as—like Karaite qiy ̄as—is less certain than reliance upon tradition, whichboth philosophers and Karaites disdain. Knowing God through logicaldemonstration is less certain than reliance upon authority (taql ̄ıd)—aradical proposal for an intellectual to make, even in irony.5. Philosophical Qiy ̄asand ImmortalityWith biting sarcasm, Ha-Levi challenges the notion that philosophersachieve immortality through the intellect. TheÓHaverquestions whetherthere is a particular degree of knowledge necessary to achieve immortal-ity, and whether it is possible to lose one’s achievement if one loses one’sknowledge:[According to the philosophers’ view], what are the limits of knowledge bywhich the human soul becomes separate from the body, without perishing? Ifit is the knowledge of all existence, there is much that remains that the phi-losophers do not comprehend of what is in heaven and earth and sea. . . . Ifit is inescapable that one penetrate deeply and grasp thoroughly [all thesethings] in logic and natural science, then [it is] a thing that cannot be grasped,and one will undoubtedly perish, according to their view. (IV:14: 211)The philosophical doctrine of immortality is as absurd as the notionthat one can save one’s soul by a mere utterance, that one can achieve sal-vation through a confession of faith. We see here one of Ha-Levi’s favor-ite rhetorical techniques: to play his opponents off against one another.Here, he plays the philosopher against the pious Muslim or Christian:It does not agree with qiy ̄asthat man should become nought in his nature,body and soul perishing, as is the case with animals, except for the philoso-phers—according to their view. [The same applies to] the statement madeby believers in other faiths—that man, by the pronunciation of one wordalone, may inherit eternal life, even if, during the whole of his life, he knewno other word than this, and perhaps did not even understand its meaning.Indeed, how great a word—that can raise one from the ranks of a beast tothat of an angel! He who did not utter this word would remain an animal,though he might be a learned and pious philosopher,77who yearned forGod78all his life.

Speaking of divine commandments that from a logicalpoint of view seem absurd—like sacrificing a lamb and sprinkling itsblood—theÓHaverargues:If this were not done from the divine command80one would belittle theseactions and would think that they distance one from God rather than bringone near to God. But as soon as the whole is properly accomplished andyou see the divine fire, or notice in yourself a new spirit, unknown before,or see true visions and great miracles, then you know81that they are the re-sult of [that action] that preceded—and [of ] that great ™a m rwith whichyou have united [ittaÓsalta] and to which you have arrived.Then do not care that you die. After you have united with it82yourdeath is only the destruction of the body, while the soul having reached thislevel, cannot descend from it, nor can it be removed. (III:53: 134 – 35)6. Demonstration Leads AstrayHa-Levi epitomizes his critique of human reasoning in a clever play onwords: logical demonstration (al-istidl ̄al) leads astray (muÓdallil) (IV:3:148). Ha-Levi thus includes istidl ̄al(from the root d-l-l, to show orprove) in his multifaceted critique of qiy ̄asand ijtih ̄ad. Just as he has ex-tended the terms qiy ̄asand ijtih ̄adbeyond their original legal context,Ha-Levi extends the term istidl ̄albeyond its context in logic to criticizedualists, materialists, and other adherents of heretical beliefs.83All theseschools arrive at their misguided metaphysical assumptions as a result ofthe same impulse that guides the philosophers: the desire to demonstratetruths about the Divine (148).The Language of Human Striving73"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"This impulse comes under the scrutiny of Ha-Levi’s attack. There isno need to demonstrate God’s existence, in Ha-Levi’s view; God existswhether or not human beings acknowledge this fact.84The greatestproof of God’s existence is simply God’s presence. When Moses asksGod for a name he can report to the Israelites, God tells him:Say to them “Ehyeh” whose meaning is “I am that I am,” meaning thePresent One, who is present when you seek me. Let them seek no greaterproof [dal ̄ıl] than my presence among them, and let them name me accord-ingly. (IV:3: 150)85TheÓHavernotes that proofs (dal ̄a’il) for the creation of the worldand for its eternity counterbalance one another; neither is proved deci-sively. God has a more powerful method of proof: God performs mira-cles to prove (li-yadulla)86that the Creator can do whatever he wills(I:67: 18). Ha-Levi’s use of the root d-l-lfor both methods of proof setsup an implicit contrast. Logical proof is inconclusive; the proof of expe-rience is more convincing than logic.The way to arrive at accurate knowledge of God is not throughlogic; we can neither obtain certainty nor accuracy through logical dem-onstration. Ha-Levi notes that the various methods of demonstration allarrive at results that contradict what is revealed in Scripture (IV:3: 148).However, while istidl ̄alon its own does not arrive at the truths of reve-lation, the assertions of the Torah are not refuted by istidl ̄al.87The only way that one can discover God is illustrated in the Bible it-self: through personal experience, or through true tradition based upondirect experience (V:14: 211– 13).88Adam, gifted with supreme intellect,would have remained content to believe in a generic God with whom hehad no hope for interaction. However when personally addressed byGod, Adam verified that God is the unique Creator of the universe, apersonal Deity aware of particular human beings—precisely the kind ofinformation philosophers take pains to prove through logic. Adam thenpassed on these traditions to his children, who in turn verified themthrough personal experience (IV:3: 148 – 49).897. Nuances to Ha-Levi’s Critique of Philosophical Qiy ̄asLike Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, Ha-Levi acknowledges that philosophers’ arguments inmathematics and logic offer authentic, irrefutable proof (burh ̄an); ac-cording to both thinkers, however, it is a mistake to deduce from thisthat one can likewise attribute the status of burh ̄anto philosophers’74Part Two"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"arguments in natural science and metaphysics.90In logic and mathemat-ics, philosophers achieve consensus; in physics and metaphysics, we finddoubt and disputes. If we do find certainty here and there, it is only be-cause there exists a philosophical tradition (taql ̄ıd) upon which others inthat school rely.91Ha-Levi maintains, however, that his is not an anti-rational posi-tion.92TheÓHaverinsists that the Torah does not assert anything thatflies in the face of logic, anything that can be refuted through clear, in-controvertible proof93or that the intellect declares absurd.94On theother hand, in any apparent conflict between reason and experience,Ha-Levi gives primary weight to experience; experience itself is an irref-utable proof.95The intellect would not accept certain events—such asthe appearance of God’s Glory and the consumption of sacrifices—if itwere not for eyewitness and personal experience,96which there is no re-futing (II:48: 69). The events of revelation outweigh the judgments ofreason.97Similarly, Ha-Levi gives authentic, reliable tradition weightover pure reason.988. Theological Qiy ̄as: Kal ̄am andTaql ̄ıdHa-Levi does not use the terms qiy ̄asand istidl ̄alin his explicit attackson kal ̄amin Book Five. However the term istidl ̄alis itself a kal ̄amterm;it signifies theological proof, which Ha-Levi asserts “leads astray.” Anal-ogy and inference are the prime tools of theology, for they allow thetheologian to derive that which is absent99from that which is present,100to find evidence for God’s existence and attributes from their traces inthe world.101Ha-Levi’s biting remarks with respect to kal ̄amare thusworth exploring at this juncture.102Critics of kal ̄ampoint out that its arguments are fundamentallyapologetic and polemical: their purpose is to defend the faith and to re-fute charges as they arise, rather than to provide apodictic proof. Thehistorian Ibn Khaldun, for example, writes that kal ̄am“merely wants torefute heretics”; kal ̄amis “a science that involves arguing with logicalproofs in defense of the articles of faith and refuting innovators who de-viate in their dogmas from the early Muslims and Muslim orthodoxy.”103The King and theÓHaveragree that kal ̄amis only needed for thosewho have already stumbled in their faith.104The King, however, begs theÓHaverfor an explanation according to the method of the theologians(V:1: 191).105He defends his request by admitting that he has alreadyfallen into doubts and conjectures, debates with philosophers and mem-bers of other religions. Therefore, he argues, it would be best for him toThe Language of Human Striving75"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"have knowledge and expertise to refute corrupt views, as he has alreadyforsaken the possibility of uncritical reliance (taql ̄ıd):Taql ̄ıdis only appropriate for one with pleasantness of soul.106However,for someone of a wicked soul, investigation107is better. All the more so ifinvestigation brings one to the verification of that taql ̄ıd. Then a personbrings both levels together, I mean knowledge108and taql ̄ıd.[V:1: 191]TheÓHaverdoes not appear to disagree, qualifying the King’s state-ment only by suggesting that the situation is even more grave than theKing realizes:But who among us has a calm soul, which is not deceived by these views . . .of the natural scientists, the astrologers, the makers of talismans, the magi-cians, the materialists, the philosophers, and others. One does not [today]arrive at faith except after one has passed through many stages of heresy.109Life is short and the labor long. Only [unique] individuals have faith by na-ture, and these views are all repugnant to them, and their souls immediatelydetect wherein lie their errors. I hope that you may be among those singu-lar ones.[However], if it be thus, and I can’t avoid [acceding to your request], Iwill not travel the way of the Karaites, who ascended to metaphysics with-out levels. (V:2: 191)110TheÓHaverargues that pure faith is a gift that argument can onlypoorly imitate. Just as the philosopher labors long to achieve what theprophetic inner eye sees in an instant (IV:3 – 6: 155– 61), so the theolo-gian employs dialectics to prove that which the calm soul accepts by na-ture (V:16: 213).Like Ghazz ̄al ̄ı and others in Islamic literature, theÓHaverlikens faithto the gift of poetry. In contrast to the “frightful babble” of poets whoquantify meter according to prosody, the poetically gifted “sense”111thecorrect meter, not erring by the slightest syllable. Ironically, the highestgoal of scholars who quantify meter is to become like the natural poet,who is ignorant of prosody. However, the gift of the natural poet canonly be taught to someone naturally endowed, who can be taught by theslightest hint (V:16: 213).112It is the same with the nation of Israel, argues theÓHaver:Likewise the community that is endowed by nature [with a gift] for relig-ious Law and drawing near to God on High. There ignites in their souls76Part Two"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"sparks from the words of the worthy ones113and there arise flames in theirhearts. One who is not so endowed needs to study kal ̄am; however some-times it does not help him, but rather harms him (V:16: 213).Jews should not need kal ̄am, theÓHaverargues, for they are endowedby nature with faith. Kal ̄amis like the babble of those who try to com-pose poetry by rules; pure faith is like genuine poetry. However kal ̄amisworse than bad poetry; it can actually lead one astray from the truth:The highest goal of that mutakallimin all that he learns and teaches is thathe arrive in his soul and in the souls of his students at principles that are inthe guileless one’s soul by nature. And sometimes the knowledge of kal ̄amharms and destroys many of the principles of truth for him, for they pro-duce in him doubts and changing views. (213)Like Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, Ha-Levi believes that kal ̄amcan be a veil to truth.However, whereas Ghazz ̄al ̄ı believes that blind faith can also be a bar-rier to truth, Ha-Levi here holds up taql ̄ıdas an ideal, if an unattainableone in this age.114Indeed, in III:37 theÓHaversuggests that it is onlythrough unwavering reliance upon the rabbis that the soul can find truerest. Theologians had argued that one could never find peace of mind(suk ̄un al-nafs) in taql ̄ıd; the muqallidfalls into doubt at the slightestpush. Only by proving the truths of faith for oneself can one find truecertainty in which the soul can take rest.115Ha-Levi ironically invertsthis concept: those who, like the Karaites, are ever inventing new argu-ments to guard their faith can never find peace of soul; there will alwayscome along someone with another argument to challenge one’s claim. Ifthe Karaites are ever found agreeing, it is only because they have re-sorted to taql ̄ıd, relying on one or another of their founders. Better thento simply admit the necessity for taql ̄ıdand rely on the rabbinic Sages,who offer sound tradition and thus true peace of soul.116While in III:38 theÓHaveroffers this argument in the context of Ka-raite law, his arguments in Book Five regarding kal ̄am—for which theKaraites were also well known—reiterate this position. Like legal qiy ̄as,kal ̄amhas little value; like Karaite legal ijtih ̄ad, Karaite kal ̄ammerelyboasts an impressive appearance. Who becomes a practitioner ofkal ̄am? The simple, guileless believer does not answer questions byway of kal ̄am; like the prophet or poet, he or she can rarely benefit an-other by instruction. The mutakallimhowever—like the philosopherwho delights in elegant proofs—has an apparent “luster of knowledge”The Language of Human Striving77"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"which fools his listeners into thinking that he is superior to the simple,pious believer. The irony here is that the goal of the theologian with hisdazzling proofs is to arrive at precisely those principles which the simpleperson possesses by nature. And sometimes these complex argumentsdestroy the very principles he seeks, for they produce doubts and chang-ing views not only in others, but in himself as well.According to theÓHaverthe nation of Israel is endowed by naturewith a gift for religious law and drawing near to the Divine. Jews, there-fore do not need kal ̄amarguments; they merely need to hear the wordsof the prophets and Sages, which ignite the sparks of faith dormant intheir souls.What ties III:37– 38 together with the two passages in Part Five,then, is that Ha-Levi contrasts the superficial luster of qiy ̄as—legal ortheological—with the simplicity of taql ̄ıd. In III:37 theÓHaverbemoansthe fact that people are fooled by the greater striving of the Karaites andmistake the calm of the rabbis for laziness. In V:16 he argues likewisethat people are fooled by the theologian’s “luster of knowledge,” andmistakenly think the theologian superior to the simple believer.The Karaites and mutakallim ̄unmust run, as it were, to stay inplace; Ha-Levi hints that they secretly wish for the peace of mind ofthose they scorn. Moreover, underneath the pyrotechnics of the Karaitesand the philosophers, if not the theologians, one finds the specter oftaql ̄ıd. It is better, then, to rely in simple-minded “ignorance” than topartake in the istidl ̄alof the theologians, which truly leads astray.C.Qiy ̄as: The Context of Mysticism and PietismHa-Levi’s overarching theme is that worship of God cannot be derived byqiy ̄as.Ha-Levi applies this critique to the context of mysticism and pie-tism by arguing that those who use their own human judgment to devisean ascetic path toward religious experience are simply using another formof qiy ̄as. Ha-Levi’s innovative use of the term qiy ̄astaints mystics and as-cetics with the negative associations he develops around the term throughhis critique of Karaites, philosophers, and practioners of the occult.1. Asceticism in the Islamic WorldWe have seen in our discussion of ittiÓs ̄althat a major theme in medie-val Islamic civilization, particularly among Sufis and philosophers,was the value of withdrawal and self-abnegation as means to religious78Part Two"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"experience. Sufi hermits and ascetics regarded humility (khush ̄u¡) andself-abasement (tadhallul) as ways of tempering the human soul to re-turn it to its divine Source. This led Sufis, and to some extent philoso-phers, to develop a disciplined path of ascetic exercises.117The exampleof Ba Óhya’s Duties of the Hearthas shown us that some of Ha-Levi’s ear-lier Jewish contemporaries were also attracted to this approach.118InPart One, we explored Ha-Levi’s rejection of asceticism as a componentof his spiritual ideal. In this section we will take up Ha-Levi’s critique ofasceticism as another form of qiy ̄as—a human tool for the cultivation ofreligious experience.Ha-Levi extends his critique of qiy ̄asto asceticism in a notable inter-change between the King and theÓHaverin II:44 – 50. The King initiallyexpresses surprise that Israel—which had been described as the heart ofthe nations, intimate with the Divine—does not have more hermits andascetics119(II:45: 68). Ha-Levi thus has the King express the view, appar-ently held by a number of Jews, that Sufi asceticism and isolation repre-sent the pinnacle of spiritual life.TheÓHaver, in contrast, challenges the notion that one can drawnear to God through the ascetic life, through humility (khush ̄u¡) andself-abasement (tadhallul) alone; he argues that one can only draw nearto God through the actions one has been commanded by God (II:46:68). TheÓHaverthus includes the way of ascetic lowliness with otherforms of qiy ̄as, which he criticizes as attempts to draw near to God byself-invented, rather than divinely commanded, means.In II:49 the King is won over to theÓHaver’s view; he agrees that ifone innovates ascetically, one is brought back to the situation of the phi-losophers and pagans, who sidestep the divine command through use ofqiy ̄as. The human impulse to ascetic self-denial, he suggests, is actually aform of egoistic self-assertion.TheÓHaverassociates asceticism with the philosophers’ belief that avirtuous person can approach God by any moral path, whether it beJewish, Christian, or one that he himself invents. In arguing thus, Ha-Levi taints asceticism with a host of terms that have come under his cri-tique. The King declares: “but now we have returned to speculating,120analogizing [qiy ̄as], pretending to be wise,121each person striving [muj-tahid ̄ına] to invent law by what their qiy ̄asleads them to, and that is ab-surd” (II:49: 69). Ha-Levi thus innovates by associating the concepts ofqiy ̄asand ijtih ̄adwith any systematic or Sufi-like program for the culti-vation of religious experience. Genuine religious experience may leadto a desire for asceticism; it is illegitimate, however, to jump-start theprocess by following an ascetic program of one’s own human devising.The Language of Human Striving79"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"A Jew who has had a powerful religious experience—for example,through encountering a genuine prophet or in the great event at MountSinai—may witness the divine light and “become spiritual,”122whichmight lead him or her to seek an ongoing separation from the senses.The experience itself may invite asceticism: “separation from [thehuman] species by purity of soul, longing123for those [elevated spiritual]levels, clinging to humility [khush ̄u¡] and purity (I:103 – 108: 34 – 36).Ha-Levi, using these Sufi terms, thus reverses the relationshipbetween asceticism and religious experience presumed by the Sufi pathof ascetic exercises and mystical states. Genuine religious experiencemight lead to a desire for asceticism; asceticism on its own does notbring religious experience. Philosophers who use qiy ̄asto achieve a uni-tive connection are similarly misguided. Ha-Levi’s critique of qiy ̄asex-tends to any regimen for the cultivation of union, whether one’s path bephilosophical, mystical, or pietistic (II:49: 69).Ha-Levi, it seems, is uncomfortable with setting up any step-by-stepplan for spiritual growth outside the halakhah.TheÓHaverdoes describethe halakhic way of life as a discipline: the servant of God is one whodisciplines his senses (III:5: 92), and diligent pursuit of the halakhahleads to the degree of prophecy (V:20: 223 – 24). However, Ha-Levi re-sists the notion of a systematic path such as those described by Avicennaand al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı in their writings on the Sufis: training of the will, asceticexercises, a carefully mapped-out journey of specific stages and states.124Rather, Ha-Levi’s focus is theocentric: it is contact with God, and not awillful path of ascetic training designed by humans, that enables one totranscend one’s humanness.Ha-Levi also resists the notion of mitsvotthemselves constituting astep-by-step Sufi-like path. Mitsvotare efficacious, Ha-Levi asserts, butone should not spend time trying to trace the effects of specific com-mandments. Following mitsvotas commanded, rather than trying to de-lineate their effectiveness, brings one near to the divine Presence.125TheÓHaverthus rejects submissiveness (khush ̄u¡) and self-abnegation (tadhallul) as a path chosen by individuals to reach the Di-vine. We saw above that Ha-Levi also uses these Sufi terms to discuss theissue on a national-historical level. TheÓHaversuggests that Jews arebidden to bear the burden of degradation (dhilla) in a spirit of submis-sion (khud ̄u¡), for it has been historically appointed by God. However, itis God and not human beings who decides the appropriate measure ofself-abasement. Humility and submissiveness “work” as a religious pathonly if appointed by God, not if chosen by humans as a theurgic path toreach the Divine by human will alone.80Part Two"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"D.Qiy ̄as: The Context of Paganism and the OccultAs we have seen, Ha-Levi innovates by extending the term qiy ̄asbeyondits context in law and philosophy to ascetic practices by which humansattempt to reach God. Ha-Levi further extends the term qiy ̄asto pagan,magical, and occult practices by means of which human beings attemptto bring down the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıinto human experience.Ha-Levi acknowledges that a common religious quest unites pagansand adherents of true Biblical religion: both seek to make contact withthe ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı. What distinguishes the two for Ha-Levi is that while thepagan tries to make contact with the Divine through human qiy ̄as, thereligious believer aims for connection by obeying the divine commandknown through revelation. Ha-Levi’s rhetorical innovation has two par-allel functions. First, Ha-Levi critiques the attempt to connect with the™amr il ̄ah ̄ıthrough human-invented formulas. At the same time, he dis-credits the qiy ̄asof law and philosophy by associating qiy ̄aswith the dis-dained formulas of pagan practices.That Ha-Levi establishes such a continuum through the term qiy ̄asisnot surprising; occult practices were considered to be applied sciences.Occult books boasted formulas incomprehensible to the layperson, asdid other scientific disciplines. Astrology, like astronomy and medicine,was one of the ancient sciences practiced by the “wise ones” (Óhakha-mim) of Ha-Levi’s day, often Jews employed by the court; Jews were alsoassociated in the popular mind with the science of alchemy (al-kimiyya).Ha-Levi’s innovation is to point out the common denominator between“sophisticated” forms of qiy ̄as, such as those of law and philosophy, andpagan qiy ̄as: the belief that human beings can connect with the Divinethrough their own self-invented formulas.1. Pagan Qiy ̄asand Dualistic TheologyAs we saw in our discussion of philosophy, Ha-Levi maintains that aform of logical demonstration (istidl ̄al) led ancients into misguidedmetaphysical assumptions. What Ha-Levi had in mind presumably wasa form of reasoning that looks at dualism in the world—day and night,light and dark, good and evil—and deduces two causes, or looks at thegreatness and power of the sun or fire and deduces that they are to beworshipped. This istidl ̄alled dualists to believe in two eternal causes,materialists to believe in the eternity of the spheres, and other pagans toworship fire or the sun (IV:3 148).The Language of Human Striving81"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"While acknowledging that the istidl ̄alof the philosophers is moreprecise than that of other pagans, he notes that the philosophers’ istidl ̄alarrives at a God who has no contact with individual human beings andis thus as far from the true God of the Bible as are pagan gods. By plac-ing philosophical istidl ̄alon a continuum with the reasoning and formu-las of pagan cults, Ha-Levi deprecates the philosophers’ results; hepoints out that like pagan worshipers, philosophers believe in that towhich their faulty human reasoning leads them. While pagan qiy ̄ascanlead to a dualistic theology, such qiy ̄asis not different in principle fromthe qiy ̄asand resulting theology of philosophers among the monotheis-tic nations.In contrast to those who would seek to connect with God throughhumanly discovered formulas, Ha-Levi maintains that God alone is ca-pable of creating conditions for connecting with the Divine.126Nohuman science can formulate or fathom these; they do not in any wayconform to human qiy ̄as. Astrologers, makers of talismans, and otheroccultists are mistaken in believing that their qiy ̄asprovides true formu-las for divine connection. The conditions for the appearance of the Di-vine are made known by God, and they are not detachable from God.One cannot simply steal or imitate the formulas and thereby gain con-trol over the Divine Presence.Ha-Levi suggests this through a rhetorical device, playing upon theambiguity of the term ™a m r, which signifies both “command” and themore elusive “thing, matter, affair.” TheÓHaverrepeatedly tells the Kingthat one can only approach the Divine (what he calls the ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ı) bythat which is commanded by God (an ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ı).127This rhetoricalmotif suggests that there is something of God present, as it were, in thecommands themselves, that the commands serve as a bridge betweenthe human and the Divine. It is quadivine command—™amr il ̄ah ̄ı—thatthe mitsvotbring the Divine (™amr il ̄ah ̄ı) into the world.Ha-Levi elaborates on this point through several illustrations: (1)theÓHaver’s description of the building of the Tabernacle; (2) the parableof the ignorant person dispensing medicine from a pharmacy; and (3)the comparison of religious actions to works of nature.The Building of the Tabernacle (III:23)On first reading, this account might invite a theurgic interpretation. Ha-Levi’s language almost suggests that fulfillment of the requisite condi-tions guarantees God’s appearance; theÓHaverasserts that the descent(hul ̄ul) of the Shekhinahis bound up, necessitated by, or connected82Part Two"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"with128the human building of the Tabernacle (III:23: 113). This wouldseem to make the appearance of God in this world a purely mechanicalaffair, dependent upon performance of the necessary procedures.TheÓHaverinsists, however, that pure intention129is among the con-ditions that make possible God’s appearance within the nation (III:23:113). One cannot bring down the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıby formulas alone; one’sworship must be in the correct spirit of devotion. This caveat tempers anapproach that might otherwise appear to be theurgic, a magical formal-ism in which the requisite formula controls the divine will.He also suggests here an intimate connection between the divinecommand and the divine presence:We have already stated that the only way to draw near to God is throughthe commandments of God [™a w ̄amir Allah] themselves, for God aloneknows their measure, times, and places, and what follows from130such re-quirements by whose fulfillment131comes the favor132[of God] and the at-tachment [ittiÓs ̄al] of the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı, as we see in the building of the taberna-cle. (III:23: 112– 13)The Parable of the Ignorant Person Dispensing Medicine from aPharmacy (I:79)The fact that the ignorant person dispensing medicine fails to healproves that the source of healing—“that which is beneficial in itself”—isnot contained in the medicine, but in the knowledge of the physicianwho prescribed it:[The ignorant person] kills people with the very medicine which used tobenefit them. Should some of them by chance derive benefit from one ofthose jars, the people will turn to him and say that he was the one who gavebenefit. . . . They did not know that that which is beneficial in itself133wasthe knowledge of that learned physician who prepared the medicines andexplained the proper manner in which they were to be administered.

This illustration can be interpreted in one of two ways:(1) God alone knows the correct “medicines” and precisely how theyare to be administered; (2) that which is commanded by God has some-thing of God in it; there is a participation mystiquein God’s commands.The Language of Human Striving83"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"According to either interpretation, practitioners of pagan arts are lik-ened to the ignorant person who dispenses harmful medicine in the guiseof benefiting others, whereas that which is commanded by God is with-out doubt beneficial.135Religiously prescribed actions are entirely deter-mined by God; human beings are incapable of deducing them (III:53:132– 33). Like the mysteries of nature and life itself, the appearance ofGod is not fully within human understanding or control.Alchemists believed they could discover and harness the mysteries ofcreation; spiritualists reasoned that just as the prophets had discoveredhow to harness the Divine through investigation, research, and qiy ̄as,they too could conquer the Divine through qiy ̄asalone:When the spiritualists136heard that the appearance of the divine tracesfrom Adam down to the children of Israel was gained by sacrifices, theythought that the appearance was the result of investigation and research,that the prophets were but people pretending to be wise137who accom-plished these wonders by means of their qiy ̄as. They on their part were anx-ious to determine sacrifices to be offered up at certain times and astrologi-cal opportunities, accompanied by ceremonies and burning of incensewhich their qiy ̄asprescribed. They even composed astrological books andother matters the mention of which is forbidden. (III:53: 133 – 34)According to theÓHaver, pagans thought they could imitate theprophets by contriving formulas to unite with the Divine. However it isnot the words prophets say that accomplish their miracles; such wordscould be easily imitated. In fact, Ha-Levi includes Jewish magical formu-las in his critique of human qiy ̄as. Jews who perform magic using the di-vine names are no different from pagans using other magical formulas.The Comparison of Religious Actions to Works of Nature (III: 53)TheÓHavermakes a sharp distinction between magic, which is theurgic,and genuine obedience to divine command, which is not. He asserts thatthere is something divine, mysterious, and unfathomable at the core ofreligiously prescribed actions—as at the core of life itself—such thattheir power cannot be harnessed by human qiy ̄as:The adepts of magical names [shemot], having heard that a prophet hadbeen spoken to138[in this or that utterance] and that a certain miracle hadoccurred to him, imagined the words were the cause of the miracle.

Ha-Levi wants tomake it clear that Judaism is not theurgy, because the mitsvotare pre-scribed by God, not discovered through qiy ̄asby clever human prophets,and we do not know the formula whereby they work. The mitsvotare anecessary but not sufficient condition for the realization of religious ex-perience. True religious experience is not theurgic in nature; qiy ̄asin allits forms is. The appearance of God is in God’s hands; human beings canonly obey God’s will with earnest intention,143and hope to receive divinecontact.2. Pines on the Question of TheurgyShlomo Pines showed that in I:79 Ha-Levi uses the term ruÓhaniyy ̄at(spiritual beings) as it is used in other Arabic texts, to describe a kind oftheurgy whereby spirits are invoked and “brought down” to do the willof the worshiper.144In III:23, theÓHaverincludes spiritualists145amongthose pagans who strive (mujtahid ̄una) to draw near to God, whereastheÓHaverasserts that judging for oneself, speculating, and conjecturingin the Law do not bring about the favor146of God.The Language of Human Striving85"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"He interprets these passages as suggesting that spiritualists are mis-guided in their theurgy because they are using the wrong formulas,whereas only a formula whose source is God can be efficacious. Judaismis superior to pagan systems not because Judaism stands above idolatryper se, but because it is the only theurgic system that is actually effec-tive.147I would like to suggest that the texts Pines cites invite a differentinterpretation.In I:97, he points out, theÓHaverasserts that the golden calf wasmade “from the speculation148of those astrologers and makers of talis-mans among them, who thought that their actions from qiy ̄as149werecloser to the true actions, like the ignoramus who entered thephysician’s pharmacy and killed people [by that from which] they hadpreviously benefited” (I:97: 31). This is a striking analogy; theÓHaversuggests that actions done from qiy ̄ascan “kill” as can medicines pre-scribed in ignorance. Pines does not note, however, the significance oftheÓHaver’s key assertion: the astrologers believe their own actionsfrom qiy ̄asare more efficacious than those prescribed by God. Nor doeshe note an additional remark by theÓHaverin the same passage: “Theirsin was in the image which they had been forbidden, and then in thatthey attributed a divine ™amr[™amr il ̄ah ̄ıyya] to something fashioned bytheir [own] hands and will150without the command of God [™a m rAllah]” (I:97: 31).TheÓHaver’s words demonstrate as close to a Biblical reproof of idol-atry as one can find.151It is clear that for Ha-Levi, the sin of the astrolo-gers is not that they lead people into ineffective theurgic practices, butthat they seek to reach God through self-invented means—that theyworship the work of their own hands. TheÓHaverargues that pagans be-lieve they can outdo God, that actions discovered by human qiy ̄asaremore effective than actions prescribed by the divine physician.According to Pines, Ha-Levi uses theurgic language of “usefulness”with respect to God and God’s commandments, comparing the mitsvotto medicines that are beneficial because prescribed by a wise physicianwho knows precisely which medicines are intrinsically effective.152However, Ha-Levi does not argue that the divine commandments are tobe practiced because they are beneficial; they are beneficial, rather, be-cause they are prescribed by God. These passages may even suggest thatGod’s command does not simply convey correct information aboutwhich actions are beneficial; God’s command transforms actions insome intrinsic way. Ha-Levi does not say this explicitly and does openhimself to a theurgic reading, one implying an almost necessary connec-tion between correct action and the appearance of the Shekhinah.However, his repeated play upon ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıas divine command and as86Part Two"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Divine presence suggests that something of the Divine lies within di-vinely prescribed actions.153Pines argues that what disturbs Ha-Levi about the philosophers isthat they fail to benefit from God, whereas followers of religious law de-rive great benefits from the God they worship.154It seems to me, how-ever, that what truly disturbs Ha-Levi is what he sees as the philosophi-cal attitude: for philosophers, God is merely an object of knowledge,rather than someone to love, serve, and obey (IV:15: 168). Ha-Levi’s po-sition is summed up in theÓHaver’s statement in III:53:The approach to God is only possible through God’s commands [™aw ̄amir],and there is no road to the knowledge of the commands of God except byway of prophecy, but not by means of qiy ̄asand cleverness. There is, how-ever, no other connection [Ósila] between us and these commands except bymeans of sound tradition. (III:53: 135)The key to authentic religious experience of the divine ™a m ris the™aw ̄amir, the commands of God, known only by true tradition going backto authentic prophecy, which is itself the ultimate level of religious experi-ence. Humanly developed means by qiy ̄asand ijtih ̄adare no substitute.3. Ha-Levi’s Theory of the Commandments ( ÓTa¡ame ha-Mitsvot)TheÓHaverrepeatedly points out the miraculous efficacy of the mitsvot:the people build the Tabernacle according to the command of God, andthe Shekhinahmiraculously descends (III:23: 113); the priests offer sac-rifices as commanded and the divine fire consumes their sacrifices (III:53:134). Ha-Levi’s comparison of mitsvotto works of nature is highly sug-gestive: he portrays the mitsvotas a divine mystery, a gift to Israel thatno other nation can boast, and that cannot be rivalled by any speculativescience (III:53: 132– 33).155His portrait of the mitsvotseems designed to impress his readers,well aware of the claims of astrology, astronomy, and metaphysics, thatthe mitsvotthemselves truly constitute divine science. The differencebetween human science and divinely prescribed action is that the lat-ter—as an ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı—is not within our intellectual grasp or control.Over against the flawed efforts of pagans and misguided Jews to reachGod through human qiy ̄as, Ha-Levi sets up the Jewish way of life. Thepractice of mitsvotalone opens the door to authentic religious experi-ence. We will thus turn to Ha-Levi’s alternative to qiy ̄as: Jewish religiousexperience, depicted as witness (mush ̄ahada) and taste (dhawq).The Language of Human Striving87"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"PART 3The Language of PerceptionReligious Experience as Witness (Mush ̄ahada)and Taste (Dhawq)In Part 1, we saw that Ha-Levi describes religious experiencein relational terms as contact or connection (ittiÓs ̄al), a term which fig-ures prominently in Book One of the Kuzari. Part 2 described Ha-Levi’s rejection of human-invented paths to achieve such contact withGod, all of which he denigrates as qiy ̄as. True religious experience isultimately a gift of God. Ha-Levi thus weaves his critique of Karaiteqiy ̄asinto a global critique of all human-invented paths of striving forreligious experience.In the following chapter, we shall explore Ha-Levi’s alternative tohuman qiy ̄as: religious experience described as sense perception, usingthe metaphors of witness (mush ̄ahada) and taste (dhawq).1. Experience vs. KnowledgeAmong the most powerful claims of the Kuzariis Ha-Levi’s assertionthat direct religious experience and not logical demonstration stands atthe heart of Judaism. Only a God known through direct experience, heargues, could have aroused the will to make the kinds of sacrifices madeby Judaism’s founding father Abraham. Hence the following epiphanyin Book Four:The King: Now it has become clear to me the difference between God andLord, and I understand what [the difference is] between the God of Abra-ham and the God of Aristotle. The Lord, may He be blessed, one longs forwith a longing of taste [dhawq] and witness [mush ̄ahada], while we [only]incline logically [qiy ̄asan] to God.89"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"And this tasting prompts one who has attained it to be consumed inlove for him, and to [prefer] death to being without him; while that logic[qiy ̄as] [only] shows that veneration is incumbent as long as one does notsuffer or bear hardship on account of it. . . .The ÓHaver: Whereas Abraham bore justly [all that] he suffered in Urof the Chaldeans, in emigration, in circumcision, in the removal of Ishmael,and in his distressing resolution to sacrifice Isaac—for he perceived[sh ̄ ahada] the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı by taste, not by logic. (IV:16 – 17: 168 – 69)A key to this passage, of which the Arabic reader would have beenaware, is that Ha-Levi has borrowed a Sufi term for intense religious ex-perience, mush ̄ahada. Derived from the root sh-h-d—which also ap-pears here as a verb to describe Abraham’s sensing of the Divine—theterm literally means “witness.” Medieval Arabic writers of all shades usemush ̄ahadato depict direct experiential perception of God and the spiri-tual world.A second key term in the passage is qiy ̄as. While I have translatedthe term here as “logic,” we have seen that qiy ̄aswould carry diverseovertones for Ha-Levi’s Arabic readers: for the lawyer, a method of legalanalogy; for the philosopher, the Aristotelian syllogism; for the theolo-gian, a tool that enabled one to prove the existence of God inductively,to argue that just as all things in this world have a cause, so must theworld as a whole have a Creator.1In the passage quoted here, theÓHavergoes on to argue that someonewho has directly experienced God’s presence would forsake the way ofqiy ̄asas useless. He suggests that sensory experience, direct and irrefut-able, is more reliable than logic. Ha-Levi’s prime example is the patri-arch Abraham, and he draws upon oral traditions about the life of Abra-ham to graphically illustrate his claim: Abraham withstands the test ofbeing thrown into a fiery furnace in his early life in Ur of the Chaldeans;2later in his life, he composes the philosophical and scientific work SeferYetsirah;3finally, God tells Abraham unequivocally to give up study ofthe stars. Drawing upon a well-known medieval topos—that of the phi-losopher or poet who rejects secular pursuits in his old age4—Ha-Levioffers a revolutionary interpretation of the rabbinic traditions he has in-herited. Once God touched Abraham directly, theÓHaverargues, Abra-ham completely abandoned his philosophical quest:For he [Abraham] perceived [sh ̄ ahada] the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıby taste, not by logic[qiy ̄as]. . . . How, then, could he not reject his earlier logical speculations[qiy ̄as ̄ at]? This is the way the Sages explain [the verse] “He brought him[Abraham] outside [to view the stars]” [Gen 15:5]: He said to him: “Give90Part Three"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"up your study of the stars!” [itsÓtagninut] [Shabbat 156a]. That is to say,God commanded him to give up his studies of the stars and other mattersthrough qiy ̄as, and adhere obediently to Him whom he had perceived bytasting, as it is said, “Taste and see that the Lord is good” [Psalms 34:9].(IV:17: 169)In the Talmudic passage from which Ha-Levi quotes, R. Yehudahcites Genesis 15:5—“He brought Abraham outside [to view thestars]”—in order to prove that constellations do not control the fate ofIsrael.5God tells Abraham, Give up your astrology; rely upon God andnot the stars! Ha-Levi creatively reinterprets the mandate “give up yourastrology (itsÓtagninut)” to signal “give up your astronomy.” That is tosay, God commanded Abraham to abandon scientific study of the stars,but more significantly, to relinquish his quest to reach God throughhuman reasoning (qiy ̄as). The goal of his quest has already met him:Abraham has already experienced God’s presence through taste.It is tempting to read this passage from Ha-Levi as an extended exe-gesis of the verse from Psalms. The psalmist’s cry, “taste and see that theLord is good” suggests to theÓHaverthat intellectual pursuit of God isfutile—that human beings have a “longing for taste and witness,” a needto behold God face to face.However, the picture becomes more complex when we realize thatjust as mush ̄ahadais a well-known term for religious experience, so toois the Arabic word Ha-Levi uses for taste, dhawq. Furthermore, dhawqis often linked with mush ̄ahadaas an aspect or dimension of the sameexperience. As ¡Abd al-Razz ̄aq al-Qash ̄an ̄ı writes in his Dictionary ofthe Technical Terms of the Sufis: “Dhawq(refers to) the first levels in thewitness (shuh ̄ud) of the Truth. . . .”6Ha-Levi therefore injects psalm 34with an original twist: he links the Hebrew verbs Óta¡amu(taste) and re’u(see) of the psalm with the well-known Sufi mystical states of dhawq(taste) and mush ̄ahada(witness). This Judaeo-Arabic link would com-pletely transform the way an Arabic-speaking Jew read the psalm.“Taste and see that the Lord is good” was no mere rhetorical flourish.The psalm was intended to evoke a concrete, living experience.2. Mystical Knowledge as Sense PerceptionMore than simply a coincidence of Hebrew and Arabic vocabulary, wefind here a key motif in Arabic religious literature: the notion that know-ing God is more akin to an act of sense perception than it is to intellectualknowledge. Ha-Levi suggests that just as eye-witness of an event is moreThe Language of Perception91"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"reliable than hearsay, so religious experience gives first-hand knowledgewhich the intellect, knowing indirectly, can only approximate.Ha-Levi, like many Sufi thinkers, chooses as analogies to religiousexperience two forms of sense perception that are direct and immediate.The sense of taste is by its very nature unmediated; no second-hand re-port, however eloquent, can convey the actual savor of a feast. Dhawqisnot simply a kind of cognition, but an immediate experience accompa-nied by relishing and enjoyment.7Vision, too, shares this characteristic;whereas a person can hear a report second hand, one cannot see an eventthrough another person’s eyes.8Ha-Levi realizes, however, that unlike taste, vision can have a collec-tive as well as an individual dimension: many people together can wit-ness the same event. In fact, the most rigorous evidence is the corrobo-rating testimony of several eye-witnesses; collective visual testimony(shah ̄ada) can be mutually reinforcing. Ha-Levi thus makes a startlinginnovation. Whereas Arabic thinkers had by and large used the verbalroot for witness (sh-h-d) only with respect to individual religious experi-ence, Ha-Levi—drawing upon the root’s sense of testimony—broadensmush ̄ahadato the historical and the collective. Ha-Levi uses the positivecharge of the Sufi term to advance his case for the superiority of Juda-ism. Judaism has the strongest epistemological base of any religion, Ha-Levi argues, because the entire Jewish people were witnesses to the eventat Mount Sinai, participating in a collective experience of mush ̄ahada.In this claim, Ha-Levi may be drawing upon similar gaonic argu-ments. R. Nissim ben Jacob of Kairouan (d. 1062), writing in Hebrew,had argued that the nation at Mount Sinai knew for certain that Godhad spoken to them because they were aware of the event through sen-sible knowledge [be-yed¡iat ha-hargashot]. R. Nissim contrasts this sen-sible knowledge, which leaves no room for doubt, with knowledge byproofs [yed¡iat ha-re’ayot], in which he believes the other nations en-gage. He even quotes Isaiah’s words that the Jews serve as witnesses[¡edim] to God.9Ha-Levi’s argument is quite similar: the nation as awhole witnessed the Divine at Mount Sinai, and this sensible knowledgeis far stronger than any intellectual proof of God’s existence. Ha-Levi’sinnovation is to bring the prestigious Sufi concept of mush ̄ahadato ad-vance this notion. Ha-Levi makes the Jewish event of revelation concreteand vivid by depicting it as an experience of collective mush ̄ahada.Ha-Levi draws another innovative connection with respect to theArabic root sh-h-d. The root was widely used by Islamic thinkers in thecontext of religious testimony. One becomes a Muslim by the simplestatement of faith known as the shah ̄ada(testimony), by declaring that92Part Three"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"there is no god but Allah, and that MuÓhammad is his messenger.10More-over the religious martyr, willing to die for the divine beloved, is called awitness (shah ̄ıd) to God. Sufi poets extend this sense of religious testi-mony by drawing upon a motif from secular Arabic love poetry: that ofthe lovesick individual who pines away for his beloved, sometimes evendying as a martyr of love. Indeed, for later Sufi poets the martyr ÓHall ̄aj isrevered as the ideal lover of God.11Like Sufi literature, rabbinic texts, too, link the themes of love andself-sacrifice. The rabbis derive the duty to give up one’s life rather thancommit idolatry from the injunction to “love the Lord your God with allyour heart, with all your soul and with all your might—even if he shouldtake your soul.”12Ha-Levi thus draws upon a classical Jewish themewith Sufi parallels when he describes Abraham’s willingness to bearadult circumcision, the sending away of Ishmael, the binding of Isaac,and even the fiery furnace, where he was willing to give up his life forGod, because he has witnessed God directly. TheÓHaverdescribesAbraham’s painful but transformative tests using these Sufi terms:Whereas Abraham bore justly [all that] he suffered in Ur of the Chaldeans,in emigration, in circumcision, in the removal of Ishmael, and in his dis-tressing resolution to sacrifice Isaac—for he perceived [sh ̄ ahada] the Divine[™amr il ̄ah ̄ı] by taste, not by logic.13(IV:17: 169)Like Sufi poetry in which the protagonist is depicted as both loverand martyr, the Kuzarishows Abraham, a lover of God, ready to be awitness/martyr to the God he has witnessed, a terminological associa-tion that may be original to Ha-Levi. The witness to God is willing to bea martyr (shah ̄ıd) because of his experience of mush ̄ahada.143. Witness at Mount Sinai as Public TestimonyHa-Levi thus creatively bridges the gap between the Sufi sense ofmush ̄ahadaas individual religious experience and the broader Islamicnotion of shah ̄adaas public testimony. Ha-Levi connects these twosenses most strikingly when he depicts the revelation at Mount Sinai ascollective mush ̄ahada, a religious experience to which the Jews offer mu-tually corroborating witness. The collective historical experience of thenation at Sinai plays a central role in the thought of Ha-Levi, and the Ar-abic root sh-h-dfigures prominently in his description of it. TheÓHaverexplains: “The masses did not [receive and] hand down these Ten Com-mandments from individual persons, nor from a prophet, but from God.The Language of Perception93"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"However, they did not have the capacity of Moses for witness[mush ̄ahada] of that grand thing” (I:87: 24).Ha-Levi here takes as his starting point the Biblical account of theevent at Mount Sinai. The text tells us that after God speaks the TenWords, the people out of fear ask that Moses and not God speak to themlest they be harmed. Ha-Levi follows rabbinic interpretation, accordingto which the nation heard at least some portion of the Ten Words directlyfrom God and then desisted from hearing.15TheÓHaverthus explains thatthe people had a lesser capacity for mush ̄ahadathan did Moses.16Despite the fact that the people did not share Moses’ gift for an ex-tended experience of mush ̄ahada, the event at Sinai convinced them thatthe philosophical account of prophecy was completely misguided.17Ha-Levi reads back into the scene at Sinai a dispute among his contemporar-ies between philosophers and traditionalists. God’s intention, theÓHavermaintains, was to disprove the philosophers’ claims:And from that day the people believed that Moses had been spoken to inwords whose origin was God. Moses did not first have a thought or an opin-ion. For prophecy is not, as the philosophers claim, from an individualpsyche that has purifed its thoughts and connected with the Active Intellect,which is called Holy Spirit or Gabriel, and thus been inspired. . . . Theseopinions were refuted at that great scene [mashhad], and the divine writingwhich followed the divine address, when he wrote those Ten Words on tab-lets from a subtle substance, and presented them to Moses; and they saw itto be divine writing, as they heard that it was divine address. (I:87: 24 – 25)The people were direct eye witnesses of this great theophany18(mashhad—another derivative of sh-h-d); it was their own seeing andhearing that convinced them of Moses’ claims.19They could no longersuspect Moses of being an imposter, presenting them with a Law that hehimself had originated in his own mind, but sought to pass off as God’s.Once the people of Israel had received God’s direct address, they them-selves had a taste of prophetic revelation; they knew experientially whatMoses had undergone, and thus had no need to construct an elaboratetheory of prophecy.20Ha-Levi is not interested in substituting a “mystical” theory ofprophecy for that of the philosophers with a new faculty of soul capableof perceiving the Divine.21Ha-Levi may have also sought to protect him-self from potential attacks by philosophically educated critics when hehedges his explanation:I do not assert authoritatively that the thing was like this description, andperhaps it was in a way more difficult to comprehend than I could imagine.94Part Three"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Nevertheless, the result of this was that whoever witnessed [sh ̄ ahada] thosescenes [mash ̄ahid]22had conviction that the thing was from the Creator,without an intermediary. (I:91: 26)Ha-Levi shows here his dialectical relationship to Sufism. On theone hand, he borrows Sufi terms, drawing upon the prestige of Sufi mys-tical terminology to affirm that the revelation at Mount Sinai was a pro-found religious event. On the other hand, he does not want to suggestthat such an experience could be the result of a philosophical or Sufi-likeprogram. As we have seen, unlike many Sufi authors, Ha-Levi does notput forward a scientific path, a rigorous step-by-step process wherebyone aims to achieve mystical states, and perhaps even prophecy.23Ha-Levi thereby protects the uniqueness of the Sinaitic revelation, denyingthat it is analogous to any experience that could be cultivated by humanqiy ̄as. Describing the event at Mount Sinai, Ha-Levi rejects the technicalprecision of the scientist, preferring the intuitive sketch of the artist.4. Knowledge as Sense Perception: The Philosophical DimensionWe should not assume, however, that the contrast between qiy ̄asandmush ̄ahadawas absolute in Ha-Levi’s world. Ha-Levi was not a lonerebel against the philosophical method of qiy ̄as; Arabic thinkers were infact debating this issue and expressing the same disillusionment withqiy ̄as—and with the way of intellect in broadest terms—as an adequatetool for knowing God. Philosophers in Spain were eagerly discussing ex-periences claimed by the Sufis, and how they could be cultivated throughan intellectual or spiritual path. Dhawqand mush ̄ahada,and how theycould be achieved, were topics of lively debate among both mystics andphilosophers. Ibn ÓTufayl’s introduction to ÓHayy Ibn YaqÓz ̄anoffers us avivid picture of the controversy in the Spanish culture of which Ha-Leviwas a part.24Al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, for example, had written of his study with the Sufis:I knew with certainty that the Sufis were masters of states, not authors ofwords,25and that I had already learned all that it is possible to learn byway of theoretical knowledge.26What remained was only that which is at-tainable not by oral instruction and study, but by taste [dhawq] and [actu-ally walking] the mystical path.27Ibn ÓTufayl, too, describes his spiritual journey as a two-stage pro-cess, beginning with the way of the intellect and culminating in directThe Language of Perception95"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"experience: “Finally I was able to see the Truth for myself, first by wayof study and theory, and now in the taste [dhawq] that comes in witness[mush ̄ahada].”28And Ibn ÓTufayl writes that when the philosopher Avi-cenna wrote about mystical states: “he only intended that they be[reached] by taste [dhawq], not by way of theoretical knowledge whichis deduced by syllogisms [maq ̄ay ̄ ıs, plural of qiy ̄as], with the prefacing ofpremises and drawing conclusions [from them].”29Ha-Levi’s claim—that the most accurate knowledge of God is moreakin to sense perception than to intellectual knowledge—was thusshared among Arabic intellectuals. And it was not within the mysticalsphere alone that this claim was gaining acceptance. Avicenna—a well-versed exponent of Aristotelian philosophy—advanced the same argu-ment in the sphere of epistemology.The term mush ̄ahadaitself had taken on a technical philosophicalmeaning which lent itself to such an analogy. Avicenna writes in hisBook of Directives and Remarks:As for perceptions [mush ̄ahad ̄at] they are like things known by the senses;they are the propositions whose assent we derive only from the senses, likeour judgment that the sun exists and shines and that fire burns. [Or] theyare like subjective propositions, like our witness [mush ̄ahada] of forcesoutside sense perception, [for example] our knowledge that we have athought, or that we are afraid or angry, or our knowledge of our own selfand our actions.30Avicenna also explains that dreams, the visions of sleep, are perceived bymush ̄ahada.31Mush ̄ahada, therefore, is the direct awareness of an event, so imme-diate that it requires no reasoning and admits of no doubt. A.-M. Goi-chon, in her Lexique de la langue philosophique d’Ibn S ̄ın ̄ athus rendersAvicenna’s understanding of mush ̄ahadaas “vision[vue], particularlyvision in the sense of immediate perceptionwithout reasoning, intuition;[it] designates above all sensible intuitionas opposed to hads, intellec-tual intuition.”32We can thus see that the link between the philosophical and the mys-tical senses of mush ̄ahadalies in the immediacy of the experience. Wit-ness of God is an experience as direct and irrefutable as awareness of ourown inner states, emotions, and sensual experiences. One who witnessesGod knows that he or she has witnessed God with the same degree ofcertainty that one knows one is thinking or afraid, or that one feels theburning of a fire.33Avicenna makes this connection explicit. Louis Gardet notes thataccording to Avicenna, “that which is ‘direct vision’ [mush ̄ahada] can96Part Three"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"only be grasped empirically. It is already thus with sensible intuition; dis-cursive reason can only know globally, without precision.”34For, writesAvicenna,most of what is grasped by qiy ̄asis too obscure to be given in detail. It islikewise with intellectual delight35and the summit of the states36of witness[mush ̄ahada] of the supreme Beauty. Qiy ̄asinforms you only that it is themost excellent splendor, but its singular quality—only direct contact37caninform you of that, and that is not within easy reach [of all].38Discursive reason can make the statement “fire burns,” but such glo-bal knowledge pales beside the direct experience of one’s hand burningin the fire. As a favorite Sufi metaphor asserts, there is a world of differ-ence between talking about the taste of wine and tasting the wine.39Rea-son can delight in discourse on the magnificence of God; in dhawqandmush ̄ahadaone directly “tastes” that magnificence, one sees the radi-ance of the Divine and is burnt by its fire.Whether or not Ha-Levi was aware specifically of Avicenna’s use ofthis analogy, the idea was certainly being discussed in his milieu, and hereturns to it repeatedly. He even goes so far as to suggest that in a con-flict between sense perception and reason, sense perception—direct wit-ness of an event—wins out. It is Israel’s collective historical experiencethat proves the validity of the Law Moses brings, including that of thenon-rational commandments. The experience itself supersedes thatwhich reason could admit on its own:These are the [non-rational] commandments by which Israel is distin-guished over and above the rational. And through them the bounty of the™amr il ̄ah ̄ıcame to Israel, though they did not know how these laws wereincumbent, just as they did not know how it happened that the Glory of theLord descended in their midst, and the fire of the Lord consumed their of-ferings, and how they heard the Almighty’s address, and how all that hap-pened to them took place, which intellects could not bear [believing], if itwere not for eyewitness [¡iy ̄ an] and personal experience [mush ̄ahada],which there is no refuting. (II:48: 69)Mush ̄ahadathus supersedes the reasoning mind. Mush ̄ahadafur-nishes more convincing proof than any degree of sophisticated reasonedargument.5. Logical Demonstration Leads AstrayHa-Levi goes further, however: he suggests that mush ̄ahada, religiousexperience, not only offers a more certain form of knowledge;The Language of Perception97"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"mush ̄ahadaactually gives more accurate knowledge of God than doesspeculation, which is held to be more precise by philosophically orientedthinkers. Mush ̄ahadaenables one to point directly to God rather than toinfer God’s existence, with all the room for error that inference brings. Aspecies of seeing brings one closer to a philosophically accurate under-standing of God than does theoretical knowledge.As we have seen, theÓHaverasserts this by playing on an assonancein the Arabic words for logical demonstration (dal ̄al, istidl ̄al) and goingastray (Ódal ̄al): demonstration (al-istidl ̄al) leads astray (muÓdallil) (IV:3:148). Logical demonstration is not only an inferior method of knowingthe God; it can actually lead to error.Ha-Levi illustrates this with a poet’s feel for language. The Tetra-grammaton, he points out, is a proper noun in the Bible, God’s personalname. The King, however, objects to this explanation: “But how can Ipersonalize one whom one cannot indicate,40one whose existence is in-ferred [ustudilla] from its effects?”41(IV:2: 148)Ha-Levi here alludes to the method of inference used in the Arabictheological tradition (kal ̄am), in which one demonstrates or infers some-thing unknown or not directly perceived from something directly per-ceived. For example, one smells smoke and from it infers the existence orpresence of a fire. The smoke, which is directly perceived,42in some sensepoints to43the fire,44which is not directly perceived.45In the case of smoke and fire, we infer the presence of fire fromsmoke because we have many times seen one following from the other.The smoke reminds us of fire; both sign and that which the sign remindsus of are directly perceivable and knowable. This is what in Stoic logic iscalled a commemorative sign: a thing that reminds us of a fact knownbefore.46The Stoics distinguish between that kind of sign and an indica-tive sign, one that deduces the existence or presence of an invisible causefrom a visible effect. An indicative sign gives only a hint or indication ofsomething that one has never directly perceived, something that may al-ways remain somewhat of a mystery.Although the Islamic theologians do not make this distinction ex-plicit, it is clear that they, like the Stoics, are primarily concerned withthe indicative sign. By this method, the mutakallim ̄uncan infer or pointto the existence of an unknown, not directly perceived God (the madl ̄ul),from the evidence of God’s signs (the dal ̄ıl) on Earth. The mutak ̄allim ̄unrefer to this kind of proof as demonstration (istidl ̄alor qiy ̄as) from thesh ̄ ahid, the perceivable (literally: “the witness,” or more generally, “thething present”) to that which is not perceivable (gh ̄ a’ib; literally: “the thingabsent”).4798Part Three"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Rather than claiming that God’s existence can be demonstrated orthat God can be known, theÓHaversuggests that God can be indicated orpointed to (yushar ¡il ̄aihi). The term yushar48is derived from the root sh-w-r, here in its fourth form meaning to make a sign, beckon, signal orpoint to; and to allude to, hint, or indicate.49Ha-Levi may have beeninterested in drawing upon the ambiguity of the term yushar, both itssense of alluding to or indicating (somewhat indirectly, like the Stoics’sindicative sign), and its sense of pointing to, motioning, pointing out (di-rectly, like the Stoics’s commemorative sign).The sense of pointing directly is indicated by theÓHaver’s next re-marks: it is, he says, as if one were to ask which of the divine forces (elo-him) it is fitting to worship—the sun, the moon, the stars—and the an-swer was Lord. The connotation of the reply Lord, theÓHaverexplains,is that of a personal name, like Reuven or Shim¡on, if by using the namesof these people one could understand their real identities (Óhaqiqatdhaw ̄atihim)50—that is, one could know and indicate who they were byusing their names.One can indicate who a person is either by pointing directly(“There’s Robert,” or “That’s Shari”) or by indicating somewhat indi-rectly (“Remember Robert and Shari?”). What theÓHaverappears to besaying is that only someone who has encountered a person directly, whohas seen or met that person, can know who is intended when thatperson’s name is mentioned. One cannot comprehend the reality of aperson by name alone unless that name is a sign reminding one of a real-ity previously known (i. e., through one’s previous encounter with theperson), or a sign alluding to a reality that will always remain somewhatof a mystery (such as the Divine).51TheÓHaver’s response to the King’s query shows Ha-Levi’s critique ofthe philosophical method of demonstration or inference (istidl ̄al, qiy ̄as):Ah, but [the Lord] canbe indicated in prophetic witnessing [mush ̄ahadanabawiyya] and in spiritual vision [b a Ós ̄ı r a],52for demonstration53leadsastray [al-istidl ̄al muÓdallil], and from demonstration arises heresy and de-structive ways of thought. (IV:3: 148)TheÓHaveranswers that there is indeed a different way of pointingto or demonstrating the existence of God, that in the case of God themethod of istidl ̄alor qiy ̄asis inferior. The existence of God is not provenby logical inference from the perceivable, physical world.

Subverting philo-sophical convention, Ha-Levi argues that logical demonstration leadsastray, while direct sensing is the most rigorous proof.6.Mush ̄ahadaas an Alternate Mode of Proof (Dalil)We find an additional terminological hint that mush ̄ahadapresents analternate form of proof. As we have seen, in IV:3 theÓHaveruses the ver-bal root d-l-lwhen condemning proof through logic; he asserts that logi-cal demonstration (istidl ̄al) leads astray (muÓdallil). However, severallines later he uses the same root to describe proof through mush ̄ahada.TheÓHaverdescribes all forms of God’s Glory as manifestations bywhich God indicates or proves to the people (yadulluhum—from d-l-l)that they are actually witnessing God and hearing the divine address:And the community . . . called Him Lord, insofar as His command andguidance link with the people and insofar as select, pure people link withHim, until they witness Him [yush ̄ahid ̄unahu] by means of what is calledGlory [kavod], Indwelling [Shekhina], kingdom, fire, cloud, image, like-ness, the appearance of the bow, and other things by which He proved tothem [yadulluhum] that they had been addressed by Him on High—andthey called [all those] the Glory of the Lord. (IV:3: 148 – 49)Visual proof, theÓHaversuggests, points to or proves more directlythan does inference. God finds ways to make the divine Presence mani-fest—ways more direct, convincing, and irrefutable than the logical cog-itations of the intellect.We find a similar use of d-l-lin Sa¡adya Gaon’s theological treatise,The Book of Doctrines and Beliefs(Kit ̄ab al-am ̄an ̄ at wa-l-i¡tiq ̄ad ̄ at).100Part Three"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Explaining Moses’ request to see God’s Glory, Sa¡adya writes: “God hasa light which he has created and which he reveals to the prophets bywhich they infer [yastadill—from d-l-l] that the word of prophecy55which they hear is from God.”56According to Sa¡adya, visual proofpoints to or proves more powerfully not only than inference, but eventhan auditory proof. The prophet may doubt whether the words he orshe hears are really from God. God’s purpose in revealing the resplen-dent light of the Kavodis to assure the prophets that the word of proph-ecy they hear is indeed from on High. The similarity in languagebetween the two statements suggests that the passage in Sa¡adya maywell have been an inspiration for Ha-Levi.Ha-Levi uses the root d-l-lto make a similar claim when theÓHaverexpounds upon the meaning of the divine name Ehyeh. The intention ofthe ambiguous name “I will be,” says theÓHaver:[is] to turn away the mind from thinking about the true essence, the knowl-edge of which is impossible. So when [Moses] asked [the Lord], “And theyshall say to me, What is His name?” He answered him: “Why should theyask concerning things they are unable to grasp? . . .

Let them search for no strongerproof58[dal ̄ıl—from d-l-l] than My presence among them, and name Meaccordingly]. (IV:3: 150)God’s Presence alone, experienced in prophetic witness (mush ̄a-hada), is the only proof (dal ̄ıl) the Israelites need that God is real.59A passage from Avicenna offers another source of support for the no-tion of mush ̄ahadaas an alternate mode of proof. It is not only the casethat mush ̄ahadaindicates God more directly than does qiy ̄as; the tastefound in witness reveals a personal, affective dimension to the Divineone would not otherwise perceive. In his Glosses to the Theology of Ar-istotle, Avicenna writes:That [experience] is joy and light, which come from God through the Intel-lect; reflective thought60and logical analogy [qiy ̄as] do not lead to it, ex-cept to confirm it. But as to its specific essence and special quality, only wit-nessing [mush ̄ahada] indicates [yadullu-from d-l-l] that.Only someone who has prepared himself by the health of the tempera-ment of his soul can attain that witnessing [mush ̄ahada]. And one who hasnot tasted [yadh ̄uqu]61the sweetness may admit its delight by a kind ofanalogy [qiy ̄as] or testimony [shah ̄ada]; but one does not savor its specialdelight except by tasting.62The Language of Perception101"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"This passage from Avicenna recalls the epiphany of Ha-Levi’s King,with which we opened our discussion:The King: Now it has become clear to me the difference between God andLord, and I understand what [the difference is] between the God of Abra-ham and the God of Aristotle. The Lord, may he be blessed, one longs forwith a longing of taste [dhawq] and witness [mush ̄ahada], while we [only]incline logically [qiy ̄asan] to God. This tasting prompts one who has at-tained it to be consumed in love for him, and to prefer death [to being]without him, whereas that reasoning [only] demonstrates that veneration isincumbent so long as one is not harmed and does not suffer hardship on ac-count of it.The ÓHaver: Whereas Abraham justly bore [all that] he suffered in Urof the Chaldeans, in emigration, circumcision, the removal of Ishmael, andin his distressing resolution to sacrifice Isaac—for he perceived [sh ̄ ahada]the Divine by taste [dhawq], not by logic. (IV:16 – 17: 168 – 69)Ha-Levi’s approach thus makes use of arguments we find in Islamicpredecessors, but expands them to include collective as well as individ-ual experience. Direct witness and taste offer both the strongest proof ofGod’s Presence, and an emotional flavor that cannot be known in anyother way, a flavor that awakens love and an intimate relationship withGod.102Part Three"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"PART 4The Language of ProphecyA. Prophecy as Witness (Mush ̄ahada)1. Prophetic Witness (Mush ̄ahada Nabawiyya)and Testimony(Shah ̄ada)Ha-Levi repeatedly uses the verb shah ̄ada(to witness) in his discussionsof prophecy. Mush ̄ahadathus functions as a bridge term, one which sug-gests a continuum between the private religious experience of those whoare not prophets, the experience of prophets, and the collective revela-tion at Mount Sinai. Playing with the possibilities of the Arabic language,Ha-Levi takes advantage of the multiple meanings of the root sh-h-dtooffer his own interpretation of the phenomenon of Biblical prophecy.Ha-Levi, using an idea present in both Jewish1and Islamic2thought,suggests that in addition to the ordinary human senses prophets have aninner eye, analogous to the physical eye.3In contrast to Neo-Platonicallyinclined thinkers,4for whom inner vision is not clearly distinguishedfrom other ways of knowing, Ha-Levi draws a sharp contrast betweeninner, spiritual vision—which is like sense perception—and intellectualknowledge. As we saw in the previous chapter, Ha-Levi describes proph-ecy as analogous to other kinds of sense perception, and contrasts pro-phetic knowing, which is direct like sense experience, with intellectualknowing, which is indirect.5Notwithstanding the direct nature of prophetic witness, just as withordinary sight there is true perception and illusion, so, too, with innervision. In both cases communal consensus plays a role in distinguishingbetween the true and the illusory. The testimony over time of Israel’scommunity of prophets is a litmus test to the truth of any one prophet’svisions, just as the testimony of ordinary human beings serves as a checkon the idiosyncrasies of individual sense perception.6103"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Human beings generally believe we live in a common world thatmost of us sense in pretty much the same way. We testify to each otherthat sweet is pleasant and bitter is unpleasant, that there is a differencebetween red and green, and so on. Those who cannot distinguishbetween red and green we single out as diverging from the natural stateof vision; we call them “color blind.” Similarly the prophets witness(yush ̄ahid ̄una) a common spiritual reality about which they testify(yash-hadu) to one another, and see ordinary human beings who lack this per-ception as blind people whom they must guide:One for whom this [inner] eye has been created is a clear-sighted person intruth, and he sees all [other] people as blind, and he guides them and showsthem the right way. . . . And he sees a great, fearsome form which points toindisputable realities [truths]. The greatest proof of their truth is the agree-ment [congruence] of [the words of] all that species [of human beings] re-garding these forms—I mean all the prophets. For they witness [yush ̄ahi-d ̄una] things about which they testify [yashhadu] to one another, as we dowith sensory objects. We testify about the sweetness of honey and the bit-terness of colynth, and when we see someone deviating we say that he is de-viating from the natural thing. [IV:3: 155]The motif of prophets as guides to the blind was present in Jewishand Islamic thought.7Ha-Levi’s innovation is to broaden the notion ofsight, witness, and testimony. Whereas for Islamic thinkers likeGhazz ̄al ̄ı, witness of God (mush ̄ahada) is a purely private experiencewithin the heart of the prophet or Sufi, Ha-Levi broadens prophetic wit-ness to include communal, as well as individual experience. By broaden-ing mush ̄ahadato include collective witness, Ha-Levi makes a bridgebetween prophecy and non-prophetic religious experience.8The collec-tive revelation at Mount Sinai, the religious experience of the seventyelders, and the prophecy of the later prophets are all mutually reinforc-ing testimony to the prophecy of Moses, confirming for all the peoplethat this Law is not simply the empty claim of an individual or an elite(IV:11: 163).9Whereas among Islamic thinkers there is no explicit connectiondrawn between mush ̄ahadaas witness and sh ̄ ahadaas testimony—in-cluding testimony in a religious context10—Ha-Levi forges this connec-tion. Thus prophets can confirm the truth of prophecy for each other,based upon what they have experienced in prophetic witness. Ha-Levithereby softens the impact of the metaphor of blindness, which, takenon its own, would create for him too great a gap between the experienceof prophets and that of ordinary Jews. Ha-Levi wants on the one hand104Part Four"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"to respond to rationalists who find the prophets’ claims to behold vi-sions absurd. He affirms the veracity of prophetic vision by assertingthat prophets have an inner eye that enables them to see what ordinarypeople cannot see. On the other hand, Ha-Levi wants to create a contin-uum between prophets and the rest of Israel. He does this by assertingthat many, varied people among the nation had some experience of di-vine witness, if not to the degree of the prophets (IV:11: 163).Various prophets witness a figure seated upon a throne. Each givescorroborating testimony to what the other has seen, just as the Jews atMount Sinai each bear witness to a common experience. The fact thatvarious prophets testify to a common spiritual reality rules out that thevision is the hallucination of an individual; the fact that these prophetslive in different generations rules out the possibility of collusion in falsewitness (IV:3: 155).2. Witness of the Divine World with the Inner EyeTheÓHaverstates in IV:3 that the prophets no doubt witness(yush ̄ahid ̄una) “that divine world” with the inner eye (IV:3: 155). This,too, was a motif in Ha-Levi’s milieu. The Brethren of Purity (Ikhw ̄an al-Ósaf ̄a’)—a tenth-century philosophical brotherhood—had written in theirEpistles that “believers, wise ones, and prophets witness [sh ̄ ahad ̄u] thespiritual world11with the eyes of their heart and the light of their intel-lects, just as inhabitants of this [lower] world12witness [sh ̄ ahad ̄u] thingswith their senses.”13The philosopher Ibn ÓTufayl, too, used the languageof mush ̄ahadato describe witness of the metaphysical world,14showingthat others in twelfth-century Spain were aware of this image.15Both al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı and Ibn ÓTufayl set forth parables of blindness toand vision of the divine world. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı explains that just as the eye orlight of the intellect knows things that the senses would find absurd, theprophet receives another eye, which gives knowledge unavailable to theordinary intellect. Ordinary human beings doubt the existence of proph-ecy only because they lack this inner eye and have not experienced its vi-sion. The situation is like that of a person born blind who has notbeengradually instructed about the nature of colors. If told about them sud-denly, all at once, such a person would “neither understand them nor ac-knowledge their existence.”16Ibn ÓTufayl, who has obviously studied his Ghazz ̄al ̄ı well, echoesthis parable, with a significant alteration: he speaks of a blind personwho hasbeen gradually instructed about the nature of color. A blindperson is told all about the city he lives in, including its colors.17WhenThe Language of Prophecy105"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"God miraculously awakens his vision, he finds all to be just as he hadlearned, except that he knows it now with greater clarity and with a tre-mendous joy.Ibn ÓTufayl uses this parable to suggest the difference between know-ing the divine world through philosophical learning and syllogism(qiy ̄as)—the original blind state—and knowing that world through di-rect witness (mush ̄ahada), the state of being able to see. Those whoknow the divine world only through philosophical speculation are lim-ited by their indirect way of knowing; they are like one born blind, whomust rely for knowledge of color on the testimony of others. One whohas direct mystical experience (mush ̄ahadaor dhawq) on the otherhand, is like a blind person given sight, who can now see the divineworld directly, in living color.18Ghazz ̄al ̄ı had used the metaphor to describe an absolute oppositionbetween those who possess the prophetic eye and those who lack it andare thus blind to what prophets see. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı stressed that a blind per-son would neither understand colors nor acknowledge their existence.Ibn ÓTufayl revises the metaphor to reflect his notion of a continuumbetween intellectual knowledge and the knowledge gained throughmush ̄ahada. For Ibn ÓTufayl, a blind person who is instructed about col-or would have some understanding of the phenomenon, without theclarity and joy of seeing color for oneself. Ibn ÓTufayl uses the metaphorof sense perception embodied in mush ̄ahadato suggest a way of know-ing that has greater clarity and joy than mere intellectual knowledge—adifference in quality perhaps, but not an absolute difference in kind.The example of Ibn ÓTufayl shows that Ha-Levi was writing within acontext: others in Spain were also trying to strike a balance betweenmush ̄ahadaand qiy ̄as. Ha-Levi, however, is more similar in approach toGhazz ̄al ̄ı than to Ibn ÓTufayl. While Ha-Levi does not reject qiy ̄astotally,he makes a decisive split between the indirect way of reason and the di-rect way of sense experience. Ha-Levi asserts that ordinary human be-ings, including philosophers, are blind to the divine world,19whileprophets witness the divine world with their inner eye (IV: 3: 155); thatdemonstration leads astray and cannot give reliable knowledge of God,while God can be pointed to directly in prophetic mush ̄ahada(IV:3:148). He assumes that once Abraham has directly experienced God inmush ̄ahadahe would scoff at the way of qiy ̄as, the path by which he hadpreviously sought to know the Divine (IV:17: 169).Ibn ÓTufayl, in contrast, sees immediate experience as coming at theend of a long path of intellectual preparation, at least in his own case.He explains to his student:106Part Four"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"I myself would not have [attained] the truth that I have arrived at, the cul-mination of my intellectual efforts, without pursuing the words [arguments]of Ghazz ̄al ̄ı and Avicenna, checking them against one other . . . until finallyI was able to see the truth for myself, first by way of research and specula-tion and now in the taste [dhawq] that comes in witness [mush ̄ahada]. Inow feel able to set down a view to be preserved in my name.20Ibn ÓTufayl maintains that while theory alone is incomplete, it doeshave an important place on the path to direct experience.Even this contrast between Ha-Levi and Ibn ÓTufayl is not absolute,however. In at least one passage of the Kuzarithere is a hint thatAbraham’s earlier philosophical stage, which led to the composition ofSefer Yetsirah,may have come to fruition in his being granted a directexperience of the Divine.21However, later in the same passage, theÓHaverreasserts that one cannot reach God by means of philosophyalone.22It appears that one of Ha-Levi’s strategies is to offer philosophi-cal argumentation as a kind of fallback position. While he most oftenargues for the absolute superiority of prophetic mush ̄ahadaover qiy ̄as,theÓHaverseems to suggest in occasional passages that philosophy andprophecy are simply two different methods whose results converge.In IV:3, for example, theÓHaverargues that the image prophets see ofa figure on a throne—an image that compares God to a human being—should not be troubling to the philosophical sensibility, as philosophers,too, compare God to a human being.23Philosophers assert this likenesswith a rational argument: that in examining God’s necessary attrib-utes—such as living, knowing, powerful, willing—we discover nothingin our direct experience (mush ̄ahada) that resembles God as much as therational soul, the perfect human. Prophets, in contrast, directly “see” theheavenly host in the form of a human being.24TheÓHaverthus suggeststhat philosophy and prophecy are simply two methods of arriving at thesame result. We see here an additional twist; theÓHaver’s argumentworks because it takes for granted that philosophers, too, appeal to di-rect experience (mush ̄ahada), that Aristotelian philosophy is in fact em-pirically based. One might go further: perhaps theÓHaveris suggestingthat philosophers must resort to mush ̄ahada—direct experience—be-cause reason alone does not find anything comparable to God.We see, then, that Ha-Levi’s position is more nuanced than mightappear at first glance. Ha-Levi does not completely reject the way of rea-son; he shows respect for the intellect and its vital role in human knowl-edge, including the prophet’s knowledge of the divine world, as we shallnow see.The Language of Prophecy107"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"3. The Inner Eye and the Intellect: Witness ( Mush ̄ahada)andInference (Istidl ̄al)While theÓHaverstates that the prophets witness (yush ̄ahid ̄una) “the di-vine world” with the inner eye—describing what the prophets witness asan objectively existing spiritual reality—he also asserts that what theysee is an image which “conforms to their own nature and to what theywitness [yush ̄ahid ̄una] corporeally” (IV:3: 155). What the prophets per-ceive is shaped by their nature as perceivers, who ordinarily sense physi-cal reality.If, for example, the prophets witness a figure seated upon a throne,they know that this is the image of a king. The sensory characteristicsperceived are accurate with respect to what the senses and imaginationcan grasp, but the rational faculty seeks a rational essence:25a wise beingwho issues commands that are to be obeyed. The rational faculty there-fore must interpret the image conveyed to it by the senses and imagina-tion. For this reason, theÓHaverstates that we might think of the innereye of the prophet as “almost” the imaginative faculty, but only “insofaras it serves the intellect” (IV:3: 155).26TheÓHaver’s description calls to mind standard Arabic accounts ofprophecy, which in turn build upon accounts of the ordinary process ofperception. When theÓHaversays that the prophetic inner eye may be(said to be) the imagination “insofar as it serves27the intellect,” he infact echoes al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı’s account of the imagination’s ordinaryfunction,rather than F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı’s account of its prophetic function.28In al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı’s theory of knowledge, the imagination functions inthree ways: it preserves impressions from the senses; it combines theseimpressions in new ways; and it reproduces or imitates sense impres-sions.29In most people, this latter function of reproducing or imitatingsense impressions takes place only during sleep, when the imagination isnot kept busy receiving sensory stimuli and supplying them to the intel-lect. However a particularly powerful imagination can imitate sense im-pressions even while a person is awake.30The imagination can also imitate intelligibles; the imagination canrepresent in sensory form the abstract ideas emanated from the ActiveIntellect. These images, like that of a figure on a throne, representing theidea of sovereignty, are then impressed upon the common sense and thefaculty of sight. The images in the faculty of sight can in turn create im-pressions in the air, so that a person sees these images as if they were ap-pearing outside the mind. Thus does al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı account for prophetic108Part Four"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"visions, which depict abstract truths in sensible images, and which theprophet sees as if they were sensory objects outside his or her ownpsyche.31In F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı’s account of ordinary, nonpropheticsense perception, theimaginative faculty receives data before the intellect does: the imagina-tion receives sense impressions, preserves them as images, and suppliesthe rational faculty with these images. The rational faculty must then siftthrough the images, weeding out those that do not conform to what isknown—for example, the image of a unicorn—and making sense of theimages in accordance with reason.In F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı’s depiction of imaginative prophecy, however, the processis reversed: the human rational faculty receives data before the imagina-tion. Intelligible “light” emanating from the Active Intellect reaches firstthe human rational faculty and then the imagination, which translatesthe intelligible idea into a sensible image. In al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı’s theory, therefore,prophetic vision is simply a translation of intellectual concepts into vividimages. For Ha-Levi, in contrast, the prophet actually learns somethingfrom the visual image, which provides source material with which theintellect works.In theÓHaver’s account, the prophetic inner eye serves (that is, feedsor supplies) the rational faculty, just as the imagination serves the intel-lect in F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı’s account of the ordinary process of perception. The ra-tional faculty must interpret the images received from the inner eye justas it interprets and checks information supplied by other senses.32Theimagination or inner eye feeds the intellect information, whether fromthe outer senses or from its own sensing, which the rational faculty mustthen interpret. Ha-Levi makes prophecy more comprehensible by sug-gesting that prophetic experience is not so different from ordinary per-ception, and the interpretation of prophecy not so different from the or-dinary interpretation of reality.4. Tensions in Ha-Levi’s EpistemologyAt the beginning of IV:3, theÓHaverspeaks of prophetic witness(mush ̄ahada) as a more certain way of knowing than inference (is-tidl ̄al),33which leads astray (IV:3: 148). Later in IV:3, however, theÓHaversays that the prophetic inner eye “sees things in their essences,without disparity, from which the intellect draws inferences [yasta-dillu]34about the intrinsic nature of things and their heart” (IV:3: 155).35From theÓHaver’s words at the beginning of IV:3, one would think thatThe Language of Prophecy109"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"direct witness makes inference unnecessary; from his words in the laterpassage, however, we learn that prophetic witness is in fact supplementedby the intellect’s process of inference.To resolve this tension, we must examine Ha-Levi’s larger theory ofknowledge. In fact, we find that theÓHaver’s description of propheticknowing is parallel to his description of the ordinary process of humanknowledge. Human beings find themselves immersed in matter, unableto grasp the essences of things in themselves without the mediation ofsensory attributes. God thus gives human beings faculties which per-ceive sensible attributes; these attributes give relatively uniform sense ex-perience to all human beings. From the attributes perceived by thesenses, the human intellect draws inferences (yastadillu) about the es-sence of things.In both the case of ordinary sensing and in prophetic awareness,then, the intellect is said to “draw inferences” (yastadillu) in a processwhich does not “lead astray”—as istidl ̄alis said to at the beginning ofIV:3—but gives the person information about the essence of things.To make sense of Ha-Levi’s position on the role of inference inhuman knowledge, therefore, we must posit that he is using the term is-tidl ̄alin two different ways. TheÓHaversuggests that the function of therational faculty when it draws conclusions (yastadillu) from the senses issimilar to the immediacy of sense experience itself: a simple, natural pro-cess, far from the belabored arguments of philosophers using qiy ̄asandistidl ̄al, which indeed may lead one astray from immediate experience.Ha-Levi’s view is complicated by his assertion that although the pro-phetic inner eye can avoid istidl ̄alon one level, it can never be com-pletely free of istidl ̄al. The first kind of istidl ̄alcreates a long series of in-ferences to prove the existence of God, without any direct experience ofthe Divine. The inner eye can directly witness God without needing thischain of inferences; it can see in an instant what the philosopher muststruggle to grasp. On the other hand, any person who uses sense percep-tion to experience the world must use intellect to interpret that sense ex-perience. The quasi-sensory experience of the inner eye requires the useof istidl ̄alas does all sense experience.The prophetic inner sense Ha-Levi portrays, like the outer senses,does have a more direct relationship with reality than does the rationalfaculty. Although it cannot sense “things-in-themselves,” the inner sensegathers data about reality directly, while the intellect is dependent uponit as an intermediary. The intellect knows about the true natures ofthings by drawing inferences from the senses. Only sound intellect, suchas is possessed by the angels, can see things-in-themselves.110Part Four"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Ha-Levi does not then deny the common sense use of intellect tointerpret sensory reality; he even acknowledges that it is necessary forthe interpretation of prophetic visions. TheÓHaver,in fact, describes apartnership between the intellect and the prophetic inner sense.A second tension we find in Ha-Levi’s theory is the following. In IV:3theÓHaverstates that only beings that are pure intellect, like the angels,can see the essence36and intrinsic nature37of things (154), but then hegoes on to say that the prophet is endowed with an inner eye that seesthings in their essences (155).38We might thus be tempted to identify theprophetic inner eye with the “sound intellect” of the angels.39However, according to theÓHaver,sound intellect sees the essence ofthings without the need for sense perception, while the prophetic innereye is an “internal sense” that supplies the intellect with sense data tointerpret, just as other senses do. The prophetic eye is likened to theother senses, and the intellect is forced to accept and work with the evi-dence of the senses, whether inner or outer.40Prophets therefore have access to the data of non-physical realityjust as ordinary people have access to physical reality, by “sensing” it.All human beings need the rational faculty as well as the senses and theimagination in order to know.The testimony of the prophet’s inner sense perception, like that ofpeople’s ordinary senses, offers more certain proof than the method oflogical inference.41However, even the prophet must use the rational fa-culty to make sense of what he or she perceives. The intellect is forced toaccept the evidence of the senses, but the senses are also checked andinterpreted by the intellect.5. The Interpretation (Ta’w ̄ıl)of Visions: Ha-Levi and the GeonimIn IV:3, theÓHavergrapples with the interpretive process by which theprophet makes sense of prophetic visions. He examines the psychic fa-culties designed by God—the senses, imagination, and reason—and as-serts that just as God has designed these human faculties to apprehendthe physical world, so God has designed a prophetic inner sense to ap-prehend divine reality.The following cluster of questions, however, remains to be examined:1. Does Ha-Levi carry the visual analogy so far as to assert thatjust as human beings witness a single physical reality, so theprophets witness the same spiritual reality?The Language of Prophecy111"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"2. Can prophetic visions be verified by others, or are these mes-sages specific to the individual prophet?3. When Scripture records visions in which the prophet de-scribes a king sitting on a throne, how shall we make sense ofthis image? Is there an objective correlate to the image, orshould we interpret such a description as a purely internalpsychic vision?42For his theory of the interpretation of prophetic visions, Ha-Levi isindebted to the gaonim, who in turn drew from certain Islamic thinkers.43The Mu¡tazilite theologians—the most influential school of the Islamicrationalists—argued that the literal seeing of God is not possible. Onlybodies (substances) and the accidents inherent in them can be perceivedthrough the physical senses.44Since God does not have a body, God can-not be sensibly perceived, either in this world or the next. Thus al-Ash¡ar ̄ı writes: “The Mu¡tazilites are unanimously of the opinion thatGod cannot be seen by eyesight; they differ regarding the question ofwhether He can be seen by our hearts.”45They explain the vision of afigure on a throne as an internal, spiritual vision.The gaonim and other Rabbanite thinkers use comparable argu-ments against the possibility of actually seeing God. R. Nissim Gaon, forexample, quotes a story—which he reports having received from a non-Jewish source—in which a disbeliever criticizes one of the rabbis forserving a God that he cannot see. The rabbi replies that it is only fittingthat an idolator see the object of his worship, since the idol is a creationof his own hands. However, the rabbi continues, “it is impossible for meto see my God, for I am the work of His hands, and he has no end, to ar-rive at or to see.”46R. ÓHananel writes that all statements about seeing God are “as in adream,” a seeing of the heart (ovanta de-libb ̄a), not a seeing of the eye,for the Creator cannot have a form.47According to the Mu¡tazilites andthe rationalistic gaonim, prophets and the pious do not encounter phys-ical manifestations of God, for the Creator of all cannot be manifest; thevisions of the prophets and the pious are rather visions in the psyche ofthe individual.Sa¡adya Gaon, however, takes a twofold approach, both sides ofwhich find echoes in Ha-Levi. While in some places he explains visionsas taking place internally, for the most part he speaks of God’s createdGlory. The created kavodaccording to Sa¡adya is an objective light,more sublime than the light of the angels, which God molds into various112Part Four"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"spiritual forms when God wants to assure the prophet of the DivinePresence. At certain extraordinary times, such as the revelation atMount Sinai, the kavodalso becomes visible to all the people of Israel.“As for the Creator himself,” Sa¡adya writes, in accord with other gao-nim and the Mu¡tazilites, “there is no means whereby anybody might seehim. Indeed, that is in the realm of the impossible.”In the Book of Doctrines and Beliefs,Sa¡adya introduces the Gloryin response to a hypothetical objection to the allegorical method: howcan one explain Biblical anthropomorphisms allegorically, when theprophets themselves saw the form of a king on a throne surrounded byangels? He counters:Our answer to this objection is that this form was something [specially]created [al- Ós ̄ura makhl ̄uqa]. Similarly the throne and the firmament, as wellas its bearers, were all of them newly produced48by the Creator out of firein order that his prophet became convinced49that it was He that had re-vealed50his word to him.51As we have seen in our discussion of mush ̄ahada, elsewhere in thework he writes: “God has a light which he has created and which he re-veals to the prophets by which they infer [yastadillu—from d-l-l] that theword of prophecy52which they hear is from God.”53For Sa¡adya then,the kavodfunctions primarily as a proof or criterion of divine revela-tion, an assurance to the prophet that this is indeed a prophetic vision.It is possible that Sa¡adya’s doctrine of the created Glory—in partic-ular, the spiritual forms molded from its light—served as an inspirationfor the model developed by Ha-Levi. For Ha-Levi, spiritual images pointto [tadullu—from d-l-l] indubitable truths:One for whom this [inner] eye has been created is a clear-sighted person intruth. He sees all [other] people as blind, and he guides them and showsthem the right way. . . . He sees a great, fearsome form which points to [ta-dullu] realities [truths] about which there is no doubt. The greatest proof oftheir truth is the agreement54of [the words of] all that species [of human be-ings] regarding these forms—I mean all the prophets. [KuzariIV:3: 155]55In Sa¡adya’s doctrine, the Glory or angel or cloud functions merelyto assure the prophet and the people that it is actually God who is ad-dressing them. Ha-Levi develops this idea in the direction of a symboliclanguage; the image not only tells the prophet from whence the commu-nication comes, but actually instructs him more effectively than couldlanguage alone. According to both Sa¡adya and Ha-Levi, visual proofThe Language of Prophecy113"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"can point to or prove more powerfully than can auditory proof or indi-rect inference. Symbols and images hit to the heart, conveying truths in-stantaneously in a way words cannot. A prophet can apprehend more ofthe Divine in one instantaneous vision than could be contained in a vol-ume of philosophy (IV:5– 6: 159 – 61).In the same passage, theÓHaverargues that though philosophers be-lieve they can do without physical forms,56human experience showsotherwise:Do not believe the rationalist57when he claims that his thought is so well-ordered that he can arrive at all the necessary metaphysical concepts withthe intellect alone, without the support58of anything sensible, withoutholding on to perception [mush ̄ahada] of an image or likeness,59whetheroral, written, visual, or imaginative. . . . Without sense which takes hold ofthat intellectual order with images60and imitations,61it simply would notbe grasped. Thus the majesty, power, compassion, . . . of God are ar-ranged62for the prophet in the greatness of that form which is created forhim [al- Ós ̄ura al-makhl ̄uqa lahu] which he sees instantaneously, in one mo-ment. . . . Such and things like it the prophet sees in one instant, and fearand love are implanted in his soul for all the days of his life. (IV:5: 160)63It is the actual presence of the form that has the power to awakenlove and awe in the prophet. No verbal description can match the emo-tional impact of a direct, visual encounter. What then is the status of theforms that the prophet sees? Sa¡adya states explicitly that everythingEzekiel saw—the throne, the angels bearing the throne, the image seatedupon it—each is a created form (Ós ̄ura makhl ̄uqa) newly produced, just asthe word that the prophet hears is newly produced.64Ha-Levi echoes Sa¡adya when he suggests that visual forms arecreated (makhl ̄uqa) for the prophet. However, theÓHaveralso states atthe end of IV:3 that it is not known whether the angels that Isaiah andEzekiel saw were temporary manifestations created specifically for theprophet, or permanent spiritual beings, which the philosophers identifywith the separate intelligences (IV:3: 158). Moreover other passages donot make it entirely clear whether Ha-Levi holds that the image is createdby God, or whether it is created by the mind of the seer. What is crucial toHa-Levi is to establish the absolute necessity and value of images.As in his ironic use of taql ̄ıd, Ha-Levi’s strategy is to turn his critics’argument on its head—here the accusation of anthropomorphism65andlikening a creature to the Creator.66In fact, theÓHaverargues, even phi-losophers use images—for example, the image of the world as a greathuman being, and the soul as a microcosm of the world. Philosophers114Part Four"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"themselves cannot describe spiritual realities without likening them tothe physical; philosophers who claim to be able to do without images aredisingenuous. The notion that one can do without images is just anotherpretense of the intellect.676. Interpretation of Rabbinic AggadotHa-Levi addresses the problem of the status of images in a striking pas-sage in III:73. Here he is discussing rabbinic aggadotabout the Sagesrather than the prophets. The passage is instructive, however, as Ha-Levi places the testimony of the Sages on a continuum with that of theprophets, connecting them through the root sh-h-d.In the course of defending the veracity of rabbinic aggadottheÓHaversays:And among [the rabbinic aggadot] are the descriptions of spiritual visions[mush ̄ahad ̄at r ̄uÓh ̄aniyy ̄at] that [the Sages] saw—[for it] is not extraordinaryfor such excellent ones that they see forms, among which [some are] in animaginative mode, due to the greatness of their isolation [concentration]68and the purification of their minds; and among which [some are] formswhich have reality from outside, such as those the prophets saw. Such is thebat qol, which was their companion in [the time of] the Second Temple, adegree below that of Óhazon[prophetic vision] and qol[prophetic speech].Therefore, do not find far-fetched the saying of R. Ishmael, “I heard avoice [(bat) qol] cooing like a dove,” and others like it, since it was alreadymade clear from that which was seen [mashhad] by Moses and Elijah,which makes this conceivable. And when a reliable report [tradition]69comes to one, it is necessary to accept it. (III:73: 144 – 45)The Sages receive genuine visions (mush ̄ahad ̄at); theÓHaverhere usesthe plural form of mush ̄ahadato describe visionary experiences, as al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı does when speaking of Sufi adepts.70Ha-Levi gives credence tothe visions of the Sages by connecting them terminologically with thetheophany (mashhad) of Moses and that of Elijah, which he also de-scribes using the root sh-h-d.In fact, he takes account of two possibilities: that the visions are seen“imaginatively,” or that they have “reality from outside.” Ha-Levi doesnot make entirely clear what he intends by this distinction.The distinction is unclear because theÓHaverasserts in IV:3 that theinner eye with which the prophet witnesses the divine world might “al-most be (said to be) the imagination.” In other words, the inner eye orimagination is itself the faculty by which the prophet apprehends theThe Language of Prophecy115"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"divine world, which does have “reality from outside.”71Moreover Ha-Levi is clearly not dismissive of those visions witnessed “imaginatively.”He ascribes these visions to purification of the mind and to tafarrud, aterm which can have connotations both of physical seclusion and ofmental withdrawal and concentration.72Perhaps what Ha-Levi has inmind is some sort of meditative practice that leads to visions one wouldnot experience in an ordinary state of awareness. However, this in itselfwould not account for Ha-Levi’s distinction between two different formsof religious experience, as what one witnesses in a meditative state could,nevertheless, have ontological reality.73It is possible Ha-Levi wants to draw a contrast between what is wit-nessed by one individual, and what is witnessed by many individuals andis thus known to have independent existence, such as the events atMount Sinai.74Both kinds of vision could be witnessed by the inner eyeor imagination; the events at Mount Sinai could have been witnessed bythe people with an inner, spiritual eye rather than the physical eye. Theevents could take place “external” to any one individual’s mind, and yetin a subtle, non-physical medium such as Sa¡adya’s second air. More-over, those only witnessed by a single individual could nevertheless beara message from the Divine.75Another possibility is that Ha-Levi seeks todistinguish between visions produced by the psyche as a result of medi-tation, and those sent from the transcendent realm. Ha-Levi may holdthat even a message produced by the mind of the rabbi has value, giventhe spiritual stature of the Sages and the process of mental purificationthey had undergone.Ha-Levi’s language also makes it unclear as to where he would placethe heavenly voice (bat qol) certain rabbinic Sages were said to hear. It ispossible that after creating two categories he intentionally blurs the linesbetween the two, in order to allow flexibility regarding any particularprophetic or rabbinic vision.76While it is not clear then precisely whatHa-Levi intends by distinguishing these two types of vision, it is clearfrom his linking of the two through the language of mush ̄ahadathat Ha-Levi ascribes genuine spiritual value to each.We should note that Ha-Levi displays a similar ambiguity whenspeaking of prophetic visions. TheÓHaverfirst asserts that spiritualforms become visible to the physical eyesight (baÓsar), but then goes onto suggest that the prophets witnessed them with the spiritual eye (¡aynruÓh ̄aniyya):77This place [the Land of Israel] has a special distinction. When there occurs init [someone] receptive, who can fulfill the necessary conditions commanded116Part Four"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"in the Law, those forms become visible to the eye [¡iy ̄ anan bi-l-baÓsar]“plainly and not in dark speeches,” as Moses saw the Tabernacle, and theorder of sacrifices, and the land of Canaan in its parts, and the theophany[mashhad] [when] “the Lord passed before him” [Exodus 34:6], and the vi-sion [mashhad] of Elijah in that same place. These things, which are notgrasped logically [qiy ̄asan] the Greek philosophers discredit, for qiy ̄asde-clares absurd that which it has not seen the likes of. However the prophetsconfirmed them, for they could not deny that which they had witnessed withthe spiritual eye [¡ayn ruÓh ̄aniyya] with which they were graced. (IV:3: 155)Once again, Ha-Levi is more concerned to emphasize the primacy ofsense experience than to state decisively whether spiritual vision is inneror outer.7.Mush ̄ahadaand the Rabbinic PardesHa-Levi uses the language of mush ̄ahadato describe entry into the gar-den (pardes) described in rabbinic literature as well. TheÓHaverquotesthe story in Hebrew from the version in the Palestinian Talmud, offeringhis own commentary before and after in Arabic:Rabbi Aqiva arrived [waÓsala] at a degree [so] near to prophecy78that hecould conduct himself79in the spiritual world,80as it was said about him:“Four entered a garden [pardes]. One peered in and died; one peered in andwas smitten. One peered in and cut the shoots. One entered in peace andleft in peace, and that was Rabbi Aqiva.”81And the one who died82wasone who could not withstand witness [mush ̄ahada] of that world: his con-stitution disintegrated [inÓhalla tark ̄ıbuhu]. [III:65: 140]Through use of the term mush ̄ahada, theÓHaverassociates thepardesstory with other experiences of the Sages such as the bat qol, withthe visions of the prophets, and with the revelation to the nation of Is-rael at Mount Sinai. TheÓHaver’s allusion to the Sage who could notwithstand witness (mush ̄ahada) of the divine world is reminiscent of hiscomment about the people’s inability to bear the divine address at Sinai:they did not possess Moses’ capacity for witness (mush ̄ahada) of thatgrand event.The term mush ̄ahadaallows for a visual dimension to the experiencewithout spelling out any specific content to the vision.83Rationalisticthinkers had described entrance into the pardesas an inner vision, an“understanding of the heart” (ovanta de-libba).84TheÓHaverseems toregard it as an actual vision of or journey through the spiritual world,The Language of Prophecy117"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"without mentioning a specific goal, such as beholding the divine chariotor journeying through heavenly palaces. He does go on to associate thepardeswith the world of separate intelligences:And the third [rabbi] denigrated actions, for he contemplated the intelli-gences [al-¡aqliy ̄at] saying, “Actions are only instrumental to arriving at[muwaÓsÓsila] this spiritual level; I have already reached it [waÓsaltuh ̄a], so Iwill not worry about the actions of the Law. He was corrupted and cor-rupted others; he was led astray and led others astray. Rabbi Aqiva was onewho could conduct himself85in both worlds without being harmed.”(III:65: 140 – 41)We see that Ha-Levi uses the term wa Ósala, like mush ̄ahada, to createa link between the pardesnarrative and other aspects of Jewish religiousexperience. TheÓHaveruses the verb here both for Rabbi Aqiva’s arrivalat a spiritual degree near prophecy, and for the pretense of the thirdrabbi, Elisha ben Abuya, to have arrived spiritually. Rabbi Aqiva reacheda level near prophecy; he could conduct himself in both worlds, the phys-ical as well as the spiritual. Elisha ben Abuya thought he had reached aspiritual level through contemplation alone. For theÓHaver, contempla-tion is not an end in itself; true arrival (wuÓs ̄ul) requires action.86Ha-Levi makes an additional linguistic association between entryinto the pardesand prophetic vision. TheÓHaveruses an ideosyncraticArabic phrase to describe the fate of the Sage who died—“his constitu-tion disintegrated” (inÓhalla tark ̄ıbuhu).”87Ha-Levi borrows the unusualphrase from a key passage in Sa¡adya’s Am ̄an ̄ at. We have had occasionto cite this passage above;88Sa¡adya uses this phrase to decribe prophetswho cannot bear the light of the Glory:God has a light which he creates and makes manifest to his prophets inorder that they may infer [yastadill] from it that the word of prophecywhich they hear is from God. When one of them sees this light, he says, “Ihave seen the Glory of the Lord.” . . . However, when they beheld this light,they were unable to look at it on account of its power and brilliance. In-deed, one who looked at it—his constitution disintegrated [inÓhallatark ̄ıbuhu] and his spirit fled [from his body], as it says: “Lest they breakthrough to the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish” [Exodus 19:21].89Ha-Levi uses the phrase likewise in IV:3 for prophets who try to seelevels of the Glory that are too subtle for their prophetic vision to bear:And of the Glory there is what prophetic vision90can bear, and after itwhat our vision can bear, such as the cloud, devouring fire, which are fa-118Part Four"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"miliar to us, and also what is more and more subtle, till it arrives at a de-gree which the prophet cannot grasp, and if he forces it, his constitutiondisintegrates [inÓhalla tark ̄ıbuhu]. (IV:3: 158)Ha-Levi interprets the Sages’ peering into pardesas witness(mush ̄ahada) of the divine world, and associates it terminologically withprophetic vision of God’s Glory. TheÓHaveris agnostic about the preciseontological status of the kavod: whether it is a created light which Godmolds into the forms he shows the prophet (IV:3: 158; II:4,7: 45– 46) orrepresents the permanent forms of the celestial world, such as the throneand the chariot (IV:3: 158). Ha-Levi emphasizies the affective, experien-tial dimension, the effect of the vision on the person who beholds it.91In summary, Ha-Levi uses the term mush ̄ahadain his account ofprophecy in a variety of ways. The term dovetails with his claim thatprophets possess an inner eye that can witness the divine world directly,while philosophers only learn about the Divine indirectly. He makes thefurther epistemological claim that prophets across the centuries testify(yashhadu) to a common spiritual reality that they each witness individ-ually in their prophetic visions.Ha-Levi builds upon the motif of sight and blindness current in hismilieu. Al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı and Ibn ÓTufayl depicted those who have not experi-enced mush ̄ahadaas in some way blind. For Ibn ÓTufayl, this blindness isonly partial; philosophy gives a useful map to the divine world, which isenhanced when one sees for oneself. Ha-Levi’s position is more similarto that of Ghazz ̄al ̄ı—an absolute opposition between those who possessthe inner eye and those who do not. Yet in several passages, Ha-Levihints that qiy ̄asand mush ̄ahadaare two paths to the same truth. WhileAbraham rejects qiy ̄asonce he has witnessed God, theÓHaversuggeststhat Abraham’s philosophical insight may have led to this direct experi-ence.92TheÓHaveralso suggests that philosophy and prophecy use acommon motif to describe God: the image of the world as a great humanbeing, and the soul as a microcosm of the world.Ha-Levi uses the language of mush ̄ahadato draw together manytypes of religious experience: the revelation at Mount Sinai, propheticvisions, the pardesnarrative of rabbinic aggadah, the bat qolof theSages. It is clear that what interests Ha-Levi most in these narratives isnot the specific ontological status of what the visionaries see, but thestriking impact of direct experience. Whether a vision is produced in thepsyche of the prophet or reveals a being from the permanent spiritualrealm, Ha-Levi stresses that visual experience has an affective dimensionwhich makes it more powerful than rational thought alone.The Language of Prophecy119"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Ha-Levi does show interest in developing a sound epistemology. TheÓHaverexplains that God has given humans mental faculties that affordsome experiential knowledge of the Divine. Human beings witnessforms appropriate to their natures; the imagination endows these formswith attributes it has witnessed corporeally. The fact that religious vi-sions are perceived and interpreted by the human psyche does not ex-plain away these experiences, but enables physical human beings to per-ceive something of a nonphysical, divine reality.However, while Ha-Levi is comfortable describing the visual com-ponent of prophecy in terms of natural human capacities, he is opposedto such views with regard to the prophet’s hearing of divine speech. Ha-Levi is especially adamant about the prophecy of Moses and the revela-tion at Mount Sinai, which he refuses to explain in natural terms, as weshall now see.B. Prophecy as Divine Inspiration (Wa Óhy,Ilh ̄am, Ta™y ̄ıd)1. Ha-Levi’s Terminology for Levels of Divine InspirationIn addition to his treatment of prophecy using the metaphor of senseperception. Ha-Levi also speaks of prophecy as a form of divine inspira-tion. We recall that Ha-Levi reads back into the scene at Mount Sinai thedebate about the mechanics of prophecy between philosophers and tra-ditional monotheists. Through God’s revelation at Mount Sinai, God in-tended to disprove the philosophical theory of prophecy, and to showthat prophecy is the direct communication of God to human beings,with no intermediary Active Intellect or angel. What we will now dis-cover is that Ha-Levi’s Islamic terminology adds a dynamic, polemicaldimension to his argument. There is a great debate in the Islamic worldover the precise nature of prophecy and the Qur ̄anic terms used to de-scribe it. Understanding the history of these terms and the way they areused by Islamic thinkers will uncover the rhetorical finesse with whichHa-Levi constructs his argument.TheÓHaverspells out rather accurately the philosophical account ofprophecy which he believes God wants to disprove, and in its place setsforth his own idiosyncratic account of prophecy and revelation. In doingso, he uses four terms which also are used with a certain technical preci-sion in Islamic discussions of prophecy:120Part Four"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"a. the terms wa Óhy(revelation) and ilh ̄ am(inspiration), whichsignify respectively a higher or ultimate and a lower degreeof prophetic inspiration;b. the term ta™y ̄ıd(divine support, strengthening, backing, con-firmation—from the second form of the root ™-y-d, to sup-port, strengthen, confirm), which Ha-Levi uses to signify anadditional level of inspiration below that of revelation(wa Óhy);c. the term nubuwwa(prophecy), which he uses to signifyprophecy proper—in contrast either to lower degrees of di-vine inspiration such as ilh ̄ amand ta™y ̄ıd, or the higher de-gree of wa Óhy(revelation)—or as a loose, overarching termfor prophetic phenomena in general, especially in adjectivalform (e.g., al-™amr al-il ̄ah ̄ı al-nabaww ̄ı, the prophetic ™a m ril ̄ ah ̄ı).2. The Debate Over Wa Óhy andIlh ̄amIslamic tradition distinguishes fundamentally between wa Óhyand ilh ̄ am.Wa Óhyrefers to God’s revelation as it is given to the prophets; God com-municates to humankind as a whole through messages given to God’strusted servants. Ilh ̄am, in contrast—which means literally “to makeswallow” or “to make gulp down”—refers to messages given to piousfriends of God (awliy ̄a’; singular wal ̄ıy) and others, messages which maybe given purely for individual inspiration.93Ta™yıdis a term for divine assistance—like the more common ma' ̄una—or inspiration (like ilh ̄ am). It is derived from the verb ™ayyada, whichoccurs three times in the Qur™ ̄an with r ̄uÓh al-quds(Holy Spirit) in regardto Jesus: “we gave Jesus, son of Mary clear arguments, and strengthened(inspired, supported) him (™ayyadn ̄ahu) with the Holy Spirit.”94Ta™yıd is in fact a key term in Ism ̄a¡ ̄ ıl ̄ı thought. In Ism ̄a¡ ̄ ıl ̄ı terminol-ogy, the term mu™ayyad(passive participle of a™-y-d) applies to any per-son who receives divine inspiration (ta™y ̄ıd) because of his rank in thehierarchy.95The term is particularly prominent in the writing of al-Sijist ̄an ̄ı—a tenth century Ism ̄a¡ ̄ ıl ̄ı missionary whose views on the pro-phetic hierarchy bear a striking resemblance to those of Ha-Levi.96Theprophet, writes al-Sijist ̄an ̄ı is “that pure man who is inspired with theholy spirit (al-mu™ayyad b ̄ı-r ̄uÓh al-quds).”97Ta™y ̄ıdtherefore appears tobe yet another term which Ha-Levi has adapted from Ism ̄a¡ ̄ ıl ̄ı thought.98The Language of Prophecy121"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The terms wa Óhyand ilh ̄ amwere, however, in dispute in Islamic cul-ture; as Haggai Ben-Shammai has recently argued, these terms were partof a debate which may be reflected in a controversy between Sa¡adyaGaon and the Karaites as well.99This controversy provides a crucialbackdrop to Ha-Levi’s own polemical use of the terms wa Óhyand ilh ̄ am.While Ben-Shammai’s definitions of positions in the debate are some-what more strict than my own, I find his overall historical outline of thecontroversy persuasive and will sketch it here.In the Qur™ ̄an, in literary traditions describing the life of MuÓham-med, and in the terminology of Muslim theologians, the fourth form ofthe root w-Óh-yand its first-form verbal noun wa Óhysignify God’s revela-tion to prophets. These terms often refer to a specific auditory and/orvisual message, which the prophet reports exactly as he perceives it.100The recipient of ilh ̄ am, in contrast, does not necessarily transmit a word-for-word message or report a specific visual image from the Divine.101However, while it is clear that the Qur™ ̄an uses the root w-Óh-yto sig-nify God’s direct revelation to prophets, the Qur™ ̄an leaves some roomfor interpretation regarding precisely how revelation takes place. Is rev-elation, in the words of John Wansbrough, “the unmediated speech ofGod” or is it the “prophetical (angelic) report of God’s speech?”102Some in the Islamic world therefore began to blur the boundariesbetween wa Óhyand ilh ̄ am, often by interpreting revelation (wa Óhy) usingthe concept of inspiration (ilh ̄ am). We find a major thread in the inter-twined history of these concepts in the literature of Qur™ ̄anic exegesis.The term ilh ̄ am—actually its verbal form, alhama—appears once in theQur™ ̄an (Sura 96:8), where it is said that God “‘caused (the soul) to swal-low down’ [alhama] her sins and her fear of God.” The earliest exegeti-cal tradition shows two streams of interpretation. Some interpreterscomment that God “instructed” or “explained” to the soul what wascommanded and forbidden for her. Other commentaries, perhaps ofSh ̄ı¡ite origin, suggest that God “created” or “implanted” these in thesoul, giving the soul an intuitive sense of the rightness or wrongness ofspecific actions. Neither view mentions ilh ̄ amas a species of prophecy.The terms revelation(wa Óhy) and inspiration(ilh ̄ am) came to beidentified with one another through exegesis of the enigmatic Qur™ ̄anicverse 42:51: “And it is not for man that God should speak to him exceptby revelation [wa Óhy], or from behind a veil, or by sending a messengerwho reveals (y ̄uÓh ̄ı) by His command what He pleases.” The Mu¡tazilitecommentator Zamakhshar ̄ı comments on this verse that wa Óhyis “inspi-ration [ilh ̄ am] and casting into the heart or a dream, as [God] revealed[awÓha] to the mother of Moses (Qur™ ̄an 28:7) and to Abraham (peace be122Part Four"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"upon him) in the sacrificing of his son” (Qur™ ̄an 37:102). Zamakhshar ̄ıalso quotes an early commentator who writes that “wa Óhyis that whichGod places in David’s heart by which he (David) writes the Psalms,” anopinion which—while not using the term ilh ̄ am—defines revelationusing the concept of inspiration. Another early exegete comments on theterm wa Óhyin this verse: “as the Prophet saw in his dream, and He in-spired him [yulhamuhu].”This blending of wa Óhyand ilh ̄ amwas taken up by a wide variety ofmedieval Islamic thinkers. Al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, quoting this same verse, writesthat the only distinction between wa Óhyand ilh ̄ amis the privilege inwa Óhyof witnessing (mush ̄ahada) the angel who casts the knowledge intoone’s heart.103The tenth-century Ikhw ̄an al-Ós a f ̄a’define revelation(wa Óhy) ambiguously as instruction about things hidden from the senses,which enters the soul without human effort or intention throughdreams, through hearing a voice while awake, or through hints.104As forilh ̄ am, the Ikhw ̄an,on the one hand, view inspiration as the source ofhuman knowledge of the arts and sciences, including philosophy. On theother hand the Ikhw ̄ango so far as to attribute the composition of Scrip-ture and the promulgation of religious Law to “receiving thoughts[khaw ̄aÓtir] or inspiration [ilh ̄ am] or revelation [wa Óhy],” interchangeably:By means of dreams [comes] recognition of warnings and good tidings; byreceiving ideas [khaw ̄aÓtir] and inspiration [ilh ̄ am] and revelation [wa Óhy][comes] recognition [which leads to] the promulgation of Laws105and thecomposition of divine books and their hidden interpretations.Introducing the concept of ta™y ̄ıd, they continue:We have already made clear in our letter on the Laws that the promulga-tion of Laws and the composition of divine books is the highest level towhich a human being may attain, with divine assistance [ta™y ̄ıd], and it isthe most noble of arts to which human hands reach, such as the Law of thebearer of the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, and the Qur™ ̄an.106The Ikhw ̄anseem to have intentionally blurred the differencebetween the various forms of prophecy, and it is not difficult to see why.Given their Neo-Platonic sensibility, the Brethren regard it as impossiblefor a prophet to hear the voice of God directly. The Ikhw ̄anbelieve,rather, that prophets receive inspiration from the angels—whom theyidentify with the separate intelligences—sometimes hearing distinctwords, but at other times shaping the wording of the prophetic messagethemselves. They write:The Language of Prophecy123"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The speech of angels is [by] hints and indications, while human speech is byverbal expressions and words. However as for the meanings, they areshared by all. The prophets receive revelation [wa Óhy] and informationfrom the angels through hints and indications. . . .

One ninth-century Mu¡tazilite criticized the Sh ̄ı¡ites for at-tributing to their leader supernatural knowledge acquired through inspi-ration (ilh ̄ am), without study.109A ninth-century Mu¡tazilite, a contem-porary of Sa¡adya, ridicules attempts to regard inspiration as a source ofcertain knowledge like logical demonstration (istidl ̄al).110He asks: howcan one know that one has come to the right knowledge by inspiration?If it is by inspiration—the validity of inspiration is still to be proven, andyou have an infinite regress; if by speculation, then one has acknowl-edged the need for speculation, and one no longer needs ilh ̄ am. Theproblem with ilh ̄ amis that inspiration in itself has no criterion thatwould decide whether it is true or false. As Ibn ÓHazm argues, one mightsay, “I have an inspiration to kill someone.”111The philosophical tradition also makes use of the terms wa Óhyandilh ̄am, but they reinterpret these terms in accordance with their Neo-Platonic sensibility. Al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı speaks of wa Óhyfrom the First Cause,through the mediation of the Active Intellect to the intellect and imagi-nation of the prophet. This highest level of prophecy which al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ıterms wa Óhyis a natural phenomenon that a person gifted with both apowerful intellect and a powerful imagination achieves at the height ofhis or her intellectual development. Al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı does not spell out thedistinction between the two forms of prophecy. However, in practicehe reserves the term wa Óhyfor the prophecy of someone who has per-fected his or her intellect, whereas he uses the term nubuwwafor theordinary form of prophecy in which a person need only have a power-ful imagination.112124Part Four"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Avicenna speaks of an imaginative form of wa Óhyin which theprophet can hear the voices of angels and see angelic forms.113He usesboth wa Óhyand ilh ̄ amto describe a specifically intellectual form ofprophecy, whereby one with a great capacity for conjunction with theActive Intellect is inspired (yulham) concerning everything that can beknown.114For Avicenna too, prophecy is the natural development of agifted intellect and imagination. Avicenna does not seem to preserve anyremnants of the distinction between wa Óhyand ilh ̄ am.3. Reflections of the Debate in the Jewish WorldThe controversy over revelation and inspiration was certainly alivewithin the Islamic world. As evidence for its reverberations within Juda-ism, Ben Shammai draws our attention to tenth-century Karaite sourcesand to Sa¡adya’s theory of prophecy.The Karaite Qirqis ̄an ̄ ı mentions that in addition to the degrees of di-rect Mosaic prophecy115and prophecy by an angel or in a dream, “somebelieve that there is an additional means which is inspiration [ilh ̄ am] andthe creation of sudden notions’”116but he declines to elaborate.117TheKaraite Yefet b. ¡El ̄ı suggests that by means of the Holy Spirit (ruaÓh ha-qodesh), which he defines as the second of six degrees of prophecy, Godinspires (yulhimu) the prophet with poems, prayers, and blessings. Re-garding the prayer of Hannah, Yefet writes: “She said this prayer by theHoly Spirit [ruaÓh ha-qodesh], like ‘A prayer of Moses’ (Ps. 90), ‘[aprayer] of Habakkuk’ [Hab. 3:1]. . . . The Lord saw fit to inspire her (yul-himuh ̄a) with this prayer so that she could know her rank with him.”118Yefet here uses the language of ilh ̄ amto depict Hannah uttering aprayer while under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. While Yefet doesnot explicitly define what he means by inspiration, his language is opento the interpretation that when Hannah or David or Habbakuk speak bythe power of the Holy Spirit, it is the people themselves who shape theactual words of their prayers. Yefet’s language, while not explicit, is per-haps suggestive of a view of prophecy that Sa¡adya Gaon actively op-posed.119In contrast to such ambiguous—and, in that cultural context,highly charged—language, Sa¡adya insists that God reveals (awÓh ̄a) thetext of prayers and psalms word for word, as indeed God does everyword of prophecy.Like the Muslim traditionalists, Sa¡adya defines prophecy proper(wa Óhy) so as to distinguish it sharply from other sorts of inspiration. ForSa¡adya, wa Óhyis the revelation of a divine message which grants certain,sensible knowledge, as the prophet reports word for word what he hearsThe Language of Prophecy125"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"(or, if it is a visual image, exactly what he sees). Perhaps influenced byarguments against ilh ̄ amas a source of reliable knowledge, Sa¡adyaclearly seeks to protect wa Óhyfrom being placed on a continuum withother, less reliable forms of inspiration.120In Sa¡adya’s view, all the books of the Bible are divinely dictated bywa Óhy. Wa Óhyis the means by which God directly addresses human be-ings, giving them specific visions (including those of Daniel, Job, and El-iphaz)121and auditory messages (the specific words that constitute Scrip-ture). In addition, Sa¡adya insists that the primary purpose of all therevealed books is commandment and prohibition. This includes even thePsalms, which he argues simply use the rhetorical form of prayer to in-struct readers about divine norms of conduct.122Sa¡adya declares thatevery word in the Bible is the word of God, even if it is expressed as theword of the prophet or the worshiper:I was compelled to begin [my commentary on Psalms] with these words, sothat the reader . . . should not get confused, and attribute the word which ison the tongue of the servant to the servant rather than to his Lord; andthink that “be gracious to me,” “deliver me,” and “save me” and similarphrases are not what God revealed [awÓh ̄a] to his prophet, but are rather thewords of the servant. . . . It is necessary one know that all of this is fromGod, formulated in all forms of language used by his creatures.123For Sa¡adya, then, the Book of Psalms is not a book of personalprayers, but an alternative medium for instruction in commandments.Sa¡adya seems to view wa Óhyas inextricably tied to the revelation of re-ligious norms.In summary, traditional Muslims speak of wa Óhyas God’s direct rev-elation of messages to prophets for the benefit of humankind, and ilh ̄ amas God’s personal communications to individuals such as pious ones.Certain groups—among them Sh ̄ı¡ites such as the Ikhw ̄an al- Ósaf ̄a’—tendto blur this distinction, seeing ilh ̄ amas a source of supernatural knowl-edge for humankind, including not only the arts and sciences but evenreligious law. They thus raise ilh ̄ amto a level others reserve for wa Óhy.Philosophers also tend to blur this distinction, but in the other direction:philosophers “lower” wa Óhy. The wa Óhyspoken of by the philosophersresembles what others would call ilh ̄ am: a semi-natural inspiration froma source beyond the individual human intellect.In the context not of prophecy but of epistemology, Mu¡tazilites denythat individual inspiration (ilh ̄ am) is a valid source of knowledge. Theirposition is similar to the traditional view, but they formulate their posi-tion in conscious opposition to the blurring of Sh ̄ı¡ites and philosophers.126Part Four"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The Karaite Qirqis ̄an ̄ı alludes to ilh ̄ amas an additional means ofprophecy, but declines to describe it in detail.124Another Karaite thinker,Yefet b. ¡El ̄ı, suggests that the prophet utters certain prayers, poems, andblessings under the inspiration of God; there is ambiguity in his lan-guage as to who formulates the words of these utterances. Sa¡adyaGaon, in contrast, flatly denies that any words in Scripture are writtenby the prophet himself under divine inspiration.125God is the Author ofevery word of Scripture.4. Examples of Ha-Levi’s Use of Ta™y ̄ıd, Ilh ̄am, Wa Óhy, andNub ̄uwwaHa-Levi’s culturally charged use of the terms wa Óhy, ilh ̄ am, and ta™y ̄ıdismost dramatic in his account of the revelation at Mount Sinai. However,with our knowledge of the controversy—between Islamic traditionalistsand rationalists, between Sa¡adya and the Karaites—we will also dis-cover other interesting reverberations throughout the Kuzari. Let us ex-amine these first, to prepare us for the full impact of the Sinai account.Ha-Levi makes use of these traditional Islamic terms for prophecy toset forth his own position on levels of inspiration in Jewish tradition. Heis not necessarily consistent in his hierarchical use of the terms, just asdifferences are found among the various Islamic thinkers. Generallyspeaking, Ha-Levi follows Islamic thinkers of a traditional bent. Hetends to reserve the term wa Óhyfor the highest level of divine inspiration,which is generally available only to prophets, but which he asserts is alsomade available to the whole people of Israel at Mount Sinai. The term isthus sometimes best translated “revelation.”Ha-Levi uses ilh ̄ amand ta™y ̄ıdto signify lower degrees of inspira-tion—including that accorded to the Sages, the heirs of legal authoritywith the ending of prophecy, and to pious friends of God (awliy ̄a’, sing.wal ̄ıy) in general. He appears to use nubuwwaas the Hebrew nevuahisused, to signify the specific phenomenon of direct divine inspirationwhich revealed the word of God to Moses and the later prophets, andwhich according to Jewish tradition ceased at a certain time in Jewishhistory.1. Ta™yıd. Ha-Levi uses ta™y ̄ıdto describe a source of knowledge that hassome degree of divine inspiration, support, or assistance. Ha-Levi showsthat ta™y ̄ıdis a bridge term which can be used to describe various formsof divine and human support. For example, theÓHaverasks the King:The Language of Prophecy127"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"“What is your opinion of Solomon’s knowledge [¡ul ̄um]? Did he not dis-course on all the sciences [¡ul ̄um] with divine, intellectual, and naturalsupport [ta™y ̄ıd]? (II:66: 79).126Ha-Levi does not go as far as either Sa¡adya or his opponents in thispassage, for he says nothing about the actual composition of specificBiblical books such as Proverbs and the Song of Songs, which were tra-ditionally attributed to Solomon. TheÓHaverasserts that Solomon him-self had divine assistance (ta™y ̄ıd), without stating that the Biblical booksattributed to him were the product of ta™y ̄ıdas opposed to wa Óhy, orwa Óhyas opposed to ta™y ̄ıd. The ability of ta™y ̄ıdto signify various formsof support distinguishes the term ta™y ̄ıdfrom wa Óhy, which is never usedfor a purely human source of inspiration.127TheÓHaveralso uses ta™y ̄ıd(divine assistance) and its passive partici-ple mu’ayyad(divinely assisted) when speaking of knowledge that is notpurely rational, but is also not full-fledged prophecy, what is termed inrabbinic sources “assistance from heaven” (sayy’ata di-shemaya).128TheÓHaverrefers to the knowledge received and passed down by Adam, andnot known by the Greeks, as the divinely assisted knowledge (I:63:17).129TheÓHaveralso asserts that the work of the Masoretes—thosewho preserved the correct text of the Torah—is a divinely assisted sci-ence (¡ilm mu’ayyad), received from a community of favored ones or anindividual who is either a prophet or an individual assisted (mu’ayyad)by the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı(III:32: 117). Similarly, he maintains that anyone whoinvestigates the Mishnah honestly will realize that no human beingcould have composed it without divine assistance (ta™y ̄ıd) (III:67: 142).In addition, theÓHaveruses ta™y ̄ıdto refer to general divine guid-ance, perhaps including behavioral as well as intellectual support. TheÓHaverasserts that the spirit of holiness (ruaÓh ha-qodesh) enwraps theNazir or the Messiah when the prophet anoints him for priesthood orkingship, or when God assists him (yu’ayyid ̄uhu) or guides him130inany matter. Ta™yıdis here depicted as a kind of divine guidance by theHoly Spirit, reflecting one rabbinic use of Holy Spirit (ruaÓhha-qodesh)to describe many, varied forms of religious experience, while in itsstricter rabbinic sense it refers to the source of prophecy proper alone(IV:15: 168).131Finally, theÓHavercriticizes loose contemporary usage, whereby aperson claims divine assistance as a way of bolstering his or her ownideas. TheÓHaverexplains that a religion whose origin is God arises sud-denly, in contrast to rational laws132whose origin is human, and whichdevelop slowly.133In the latter case, when the person gains ascendancy itis said that the person is assisted by God (mu’ayyad) or inspired (mulham)128Part Four"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"(I:81: 21– 22). The phrase “it is said” is significant; we can detect in theÓHaver’swords a note of derision for what he sees not only as an im-proper use of language, but a spurious claim to divine support. Ha-Levimay have in mind here the thought of al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı,who universalizes thephenomenon of prophecy, maintaining that any law-giver is essentially aprophet. According to al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı the prophet even has the authority toformulate and change religious law of his own accord.134Ha-Levi maywell have regarded as dangerous this co-opting of the notion of divinesupport to promulgate one’s own law, or to abrogate religious law whichis actually divine in origin.2. Ilh ̄am. Ha-Levi uses ilh ̄ amin a manner similar to ta™y ̄ıd, for personalinspiration or inspiration short of prophecy proper. Like ta™y ̄ıd, the termilh ̄ amcan serve as a bridge between divine and natural human knowl-edge. For example, theÓHaverasserts that in the prayer “You favorhuman beings with knowledge” (attah Óhonen le-adam da¡at), a personprays for intelligence (¡aql) and inspiration (ilh ̄ am).The two forms ofknowledge are here paired closely; there is clearly a continuum betweennatural and inspired knowledge. A person should ask for divine assis-tance (“grace us from You with knowledge, discernment, and under-standing”), while recognizing that this may come through the ordinaryhuman intellect (¡aql), as well as the catalyst of inspiration (ilh ̄ am)(III:19: 108).In V:12, in the presentation of the views of the philosophers—actu-ally a treatise from the early thought of Avicenna—theÓHaverassertsthat primary truths (for example, that the whole is equal to the sum ofits parts) are acquired by divine inspiration (ilh ̄ am il ̄ah ̄ı). More complextruths, however, are known by acquisition—that is, by qiy ̄asand de-monstrative discovery (V:12: 204).135Here ilh ̄ amseems to refer to truthsimplanted in the human mind by God or by nature, or at least not dis-covered by an active human process of acquisition. This form of knowl-edge once again bridges the natural and the transcendent.136Like ta™y ̄ıd, ilh ̄ amcan also refer to general religious guidance. InV:10, theÓHaver, describing the views of the mutakallim ̄un, asserts thata person whose temperament is balanced is one who seeks advice andguidance, that God might inspire him (yulhimuhu) along the right path(V:10: 200).137In V:20, describing his own views, he asserts that a relig-ious person seeks inspirations (ilh ̄ am ̄at) if he is a pious friend of God(wal ̄ıy) and miracles and wonders if he is a prophet. Here it is not clearwhether the inspirations referred to are intellectual, behavioral, or someblend of the two (V:20: 220).The Language of Prophecy129"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"TheÓHaverspeaks of ilh ̄ am, too, with a note of derision. We sawabove that in I:81 he pairs being “divinely assisted” (mu’ayyad minallah) with being “inspired” (mulham) as a way of speaking about thefounder of a rational religion. This scorn in theÓHaver’stone is reminis-cent of a critique of ilh ̄ amwe saw above, advanced by a tenth-centuryMu¡tazilite.138TheÓHaverhints that claiming ilh ̄ amis just a way of inflat-ing the authority of one’s own ideas.3. Wa Óhy. Ha-Levi uses wa Óhy, in contrast, to describe direct addressfrom God to a prophet. For example, in II: 68, theÓHaverexplains thataccording to tradition,139Hebrew is the language in which God pro-phetically addressed (awÓh ̄a) Adam and Eve (II:68: 79). On a morecomplex level, theÓHaveruses the term wa Óhywhen contrasting the or-dinary rational way of knowing God with supra-rational, experientialknowledge. In IV:27, theÓHaverterms God’s direct communicationwith Abraham wa Óhy; he explains that when God prophetically ad-dressed (awÓh ̄a) Abraham, Abraham gave up all attempts to know Godby qiy ̄as. Wa Óhycommunicates a knowledge inaccessible to qiy ̄asalone(IV:27: 184).140On the same note, in IV:27 theÓHaverrecounts the following anec-dote (which he mistakenly attributes to Plato), in which he uses the termwa Óhyto describe God’s address to a philosopher through a human oracle:A prophet . . . spoke in a prophetic revelation [wa Óhy] from God141to a phi-losopher who was overweening [or arrogant]142in philosophy, saying,“You cannot reach143Me by this path [philosophy], but rather by thosewhom I have placed as an intermediary between Me and my creatures, i.e.,the prophets and the true Law.144(IV:27: 184)This anecdote brings to mind the contrast we have seen in our discussionof ittiÓs ̄aland qiy ̄as: one cannot reach God (taÓsilu, from w-Ós-l) throughthe philosophical method or qiy ̄asalone, but only through direct contact(wa Óhyor ittiÓs ̄al).Finally, theÓHaveruses wa Óhyto signify the highest level of human re-ligious attainment. TheÓHaverasserts that Christians and Muslims be-came ascetics and hermits in order that prophetic revelation (wa Óhy)might come to them, but it did not come (II:32: 64). While asceticismdoes not lead to wa Óhy, observance of the mitsvotprovides at least thenecessary condition for this experience. Born Jews can achieve the de-gree of prophecy and receive prophetic revelation (wa Óhy) through dili-gent practice of the halakhah:145130Part Four"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Law which is from God confers something of the behavior146andform147of angels on human souls, a thing which cannot be attained148by[natural] acquisition.149The proof [dal ̄ıl] is that diligence and persever-ence in the practices of this Law raise one150to the degree of propheticrevelation [wa Óhy], which is the human level closest to the divine [level].(V:20: 223 – 24).Here wa Óhysignifies not just a source of knowledge or a subjectiveexperience of the Divine, but a state of being, the highest degree of re-ligious attainment to which a human being can aspire. Passages such asthis, which describe the mitsvotas a path to religious experience, pointto a tension in Ha-Levi’s thought. On the one hand, Ha-Levi wants tocombat philosophical arrogance by contrasting what he sees as the pov-erty of the philosophical approach to God compared with the richnessand power of direct experience. For this goal, he makes a sharp distinc-tion between the knowledge attained by natural, unaided reason (qiy ̄as)and knowledge attained only by inspiration. On the other hand, hedoes not want to go as far as Sa¡adya, whose strict definition of wa Óhymight create too strong a boundary between knowledge of God avail-able to all people and the experiential knowledge attained only byprophets. Ha-Levi clearly wants his readers to know that there are de-grees of religious experience available to all Jews in his own time, justas in the ancient past.4. Nubuwwa. Ha-Levi uses the term nubuwwato signify the rabbinicview of prophecy as a phenomenon present among the nation of Israel inthe land of Israel151for a certain historical period of time, after whichpoint God removed the gift of prophecy.152Ha-Levi also draws attentionto nubuwwaas a gift that comes to particular individuals. TheÓHaveras-serts that both Abraham and Moses were eighty years old when nu-buwwacame to them (I:83: 23), that Moses took of his nubuwwaandgave it to the seventy elders (IV:11: 163), and that nubuwwawas re-tained among the descendents of Abraham (II:14: 50).Like wa Óhy, nubuwwasignifies for Ha-Levi the ultimate degree ofreligious experience, a level to which individual human beings (but,alas, only born Jews) may aspire.153Ha-Levi uses nubuwwaas a foil toqiy ̄as;154he takes account of nubuwwaas a phenomenon about whichmany, including philosophers, were debating. He argues that God re-vealed the Torah at Mount Sinai lest people believe nubuwwato besome form of individual inspiration (ilh ̄am, ta™y ̄ıd), by which Mosespassed off his own ideas as divinely inspired, as certain philosophersThe Language of Prophecy131"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"claimed (I:87: 24).155God also wanted to remove any suspicion that nu-buwwawas the hoax of a small elite—the fanciful presumption of thefew who claimed to possess it, rather than a genuine experience of theDivine.1565. Divine Inspiration and Legal Authority: From the Prophetsto the RabbisThe prophets have authority by direct revelation (wa Óhy) from God.When describing the symbolism of the Temple and its service, theÓHaverasserts: “From [the Ark] went forth a twofold knowledge, first, theknowledge of religious law,157whose bearers were the priests; secondlythe knowledge of prophetic revelation [wa Óhy] which was in the hands ofthe prophets.” (II:28: 63)The rabbis have legal authority, both by direct inheritance of tradi-tion from the prophets and by divine assistance and inspiration (ta™y ̄ıdand ilh ̄ am). Commenting on a series of verses in Deuteronomy 17 usedby the rabbis to validate rabbinic authority158—theÓHaverexplains:[This refers to the time when] the Temple Service and the Sanhedrin and thegroups [of Levites] which completed the organization were still intact, andthe ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ıwas connected159with them, without doubt, whether byprophecy [nubuwwa], or by divine strengthening [ta™y ̄ıd] and inspiration[ilh ̄ am], as was the case in the Second Temple. . . . And thus the law160ofMegillahand Purimand the law ofÓHanukkahare binding and we can say“who has commanded us to read the Megillahand “to kindle the light ofÓHanukkah.” (III:39: 122)Direct divine inspiration did not cease, according to theÓHaver, withthe cessation of prophecy proper. In his defense of rabbinic tradition, theÓHaverexplains that the Torah’s admonition, “You shall not add” to theLaw refers to“that which I commanded you through Moses,” and any “prophet fromamong your brethren” who fulfills the conditions of a prophet.[It] further refers to regulations laid down in common by priests andjudges “from the place which your Lord shall choose.” For they are sup-ported [mu’ayyad ̄una, from a-y-d, root of ta™y ̄ıd] by the Shekhinah. . . .The members of the Sanhedrin, as is known by tradition,161had to possessa thorough acquaintance with all branches of science. Not only that, butprophecy had hardly departed from them, or rather what took its place, thebat qol, and things like it. (III:41: 125)132Part Four"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The Sanhedrin’s divine inspiration in deciding law is assured, ac-cording to theÓHaver, because its members receive support (ta™y ̄ıd) fromthe Shekhinah—if not by prophecy proper, then by the bat qol, the di-vine voice, which is a rabbinic term for a level of inspiration below thatof prophecy.The rabbis held that with the departure of the Holy Spirit (ruaÓhha-qodesh) from Israel—the spirit which granted prophecy, according to rab-binic tradition—the heavenly voice or echo (bat qol) remained as a meansof direct divine communication.162Ha-Levi thus draws a parallel betweenclassical rabbinic terminology for the divine inspiration that was ac-corded to the Sages after the cessation of prophecy (bat qol), and the Ara-bic term he has chosen to describe such a level of divine support (ta™y ̄ıd).Ha-Levi’s language in this passage is perhaps deliberately ambigu-ous. It is not clear whether he wishes to say that prophecy had “just re-cently departed” from the community of the Second Temple; this wouldbe problematic, for his language would then imply that the bat qol, too,had recently ceased. Perhaps, then, Ha-Levi wishes to suggest that theinspiration the Sages receive is quasi-prophetic; that prophecy hadhardly ceased at all, for the bat qolhad taken its place.With his dislike for distinct hierarchies, it is likely that Ha-Levi ischaracteristically hedging on whether the Sages receive prophetic inspi-ration; he refers to inspiration by “the heavenly voice and things like it,”without specifying what these other forms of divine communicationmight be. The main focus of this passage seems to be Ha-Levi’s convic-tion—in contrast to the claims of the Karaites—that divine inspirationdoes indeed continue among the rabbis, that rabbinic literature itself hasacknowledged this phenomenon, and that there exists a recognized vo-cabulary for inspiration which, if not at the level of prophecy, is never-theless divine in origin. TheÓHaveralso explains that while prophecywas not newly acquired (muktasab) during the time of the Second Tem-ple, there still remained prophets who had acquired prophecy during theperiod of the First Temple. Moreover Ha-Levi apparently holds thatother prophets could also draw inspiration from the Shekhinah’sabidingin a prophetic individual, just as prophets drew inspiration from theShekhinah’spresence in the First Temple.163TheÓHaveruses the vocabulary of divine inspiration to describe theSages’ extraordinary piety as well as their ability to establish law. In thefollowing passage, he depicts a Sufi-like meditation on the participation ofGod in the pious person’s every action. Describing God’s sustaining pres-ence in the world—an active presence Ha-Levi believes to be absolutelynecessary for the world’s continued functioning—theÓHaverexplains:The Language of Prophecy133"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Creator creates limbs and gives them powers and sustains them inevery moment.

If the pious person meditateson this in all his movements, he acknowledges the Creator’s participationin [his limbs’ movements], for He first created them, and [now] providesthem with his unceasing support [necessary] for their perfection.Then it is as if the divine Presence164is with him continually, and theangels virtually accompany him. If he strengthens his piety, and he abidesin places worthy of the divine Presence,165they accompany him in reality,and he sees them with his own eyes, just next to the degree of prophecy[nubuwwa].Thus the best of the Sages, during the time of the Second Temple, sawa certain form and heard a heavenly voice [bat qol]. This is the degree ofthe pious,166and above it is that of prophets. (III:11: 99)Even if the Holy Spirit of prophecy has left Israel, the rabbis are nev-ertheless of a sufficient degree of piety to merit certain gifts of the spirit,including the ability to see spiritual forms and hear the heavenly voice(bat qol). The Sages’ accounts of heavenly visions are therefore to be ac-cepted and not doubted.167Similarly, arguing that reliance on authority(taql ̄ıd) is necessary for anyone who accepts the veracity of the Torah—as taql ̄ıdis needed to establish the Torah’s authentic text—theÓHaveras-serts that the taql ̄ıdof the Sages is the most authoritative, as they tracetheir inspiration back to prophets whose divine inspiration no onewould dare question.168Ha-Levi appears at first glance to deviate somewhat from his ter-minological model when, to combat Karaite objections, theÓHaverseems to endow the Sages with more direct divine authority to establishlaw than the terms ta™y ̄ıdand ilh ̄amor even nubuwwawould imply. Inexplaining the Sages’ establishment of the date of “putting the sickle tocorn”—the beginning of counting fifty days from Passover toShavu¡ot—as the second day of Passover, Ha-Levi ascribes to the Sagesat least the possibility of the highest degree of divine inspiration, wa Óhy(revelation):This was fixed for the second day of Passover—which does not contradictthe Torah, since it originated with “the place which the Lord shall choose,”on the conditions discussed before. Perhaps this was a revelation [bi-wa Óhy]from God the Exalted.169This is possible, and it frees us from the contro-versy of those who provoke controversy. (III:41: 125)However, Ha-Levi may mean here that the Sages had an oral traditionwhose original source was wa Óhy, what the rabbis call “a law of Mosesfrom Sinai” (halakhah le-Moshe mi-Sinai).134Part Four"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Another exceptional usage of wa Óhyis found in IV:17. TheÓHaversays that the masses do not follow the taql ̄ıdof philosophers, but ratherthat of the Sages, for the souls of the masses are, as it were, propheticallyinspired (wuÓhiya) with the truth—a statement he supports with the Tal-mudic quotation “words of truth will be recognized” (Sota 9b). Here itseems that he uses wa Óhyin rhetorical exaggeration to denigrate the so-phisticated proof of the philosopher, which nevertheless does not foolthe masses (IV:17: 169).These two exceptional uses of wa Óhyreveal once more the parallelsbetween Ha-Levi’s arguments against the Karaites and those he usesagainst the philosophers. Both Karaites and philosophers claim to beabove mere reliance on authority; both are actually slaves to their ownsectarian taql ̄ıd. Each presents its claims using the method of qiy ̄as,which purports to be rationally compelling. Jewish tradition, however,possesses prophetic revelation (wa Óhy), which is even more compelling.In summary, Ha-Levi’s rendering of prophetic inspiration is lessrigid than Sa¡adya and the Muslim traditionalists, but more conserva-tive than the philosophers and the Sh ̄ı¡ites. He uses the terms ilhamandta™y ̄ıdto describe a divine inspiration that gives the rabbis authority tolegislate. Rabbinic tradition recognized in the work of the Sages the con-tinuation of certain forms of inspiration, even after the cessation ofprophecy proper. Accordingly, Ha-Levi equates rabbinic terms for suchinspiration—bat qol, sayyata di-shemaya—with Arabic terms for inspi-ration (ilh ̄ am) and divine support (ta™y ̄ıd). These terms create a bridgebetween purely human knowledge and knowledge assisted by God, suchas the Masoretic establishment of the Biblical text and the compositionof the Mishnah. He also suggests that these forms of support guide thebehavior of priests and prophets when they are embraced by the HolySpirit (ruaÓh ha-qodesh). He connects ta™y ̄ıdwith Solomon, although hedoes not state outright that Solomon composed the Biblical books at-tributed to him by ta™y ̄ıd. He also takes account of people who inventhuman, rational religions, calling themselves inspired (mulham), with-out true prophetic inspiration.Like Sa¡adya, he generally reserves the term wa Óhyfor God’s directaddress to a prophet, a synonym for nubuwwa. Wa Óhygives Abrahamsupra-rational knowledge not accessible to human qiy ̄asalone. Hisgreatest innovation is to extend the term wa Óhyto all Jews. Perhaps play-fully, he suggests that the masses are inspired by wa Óhy tofollow theSages rather than the philosophers. In a more serious vein, he assertsthat practicing the divine commandments can lead Jews to wa Óhy, the ex-periential state closest to the Divine. All born Jews have the potential forwa Óhy, a potential that is realized in the event at Mount Sinai.The Language of Prophecy135"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"6. Three Accounts of Prophecy (Nubuwwa)We have noted that for medieval thinkers, receiving the Torah at MountSinai represents the ultimate prophetic degree, and the one most in ten-sion with philosophical accounts of prophecy. If prophecy requires intel-lectual preparation, as the philosophers contend, how could the untu-tored masses participate in the revelation at Mount Sinai? Ha-Levi’sdepiction of the event of revelation must be read in light of his accountsof prophecy throughout the Kuzari. He offers several descriptions of thephenomenon of prophecy proper (nubuwwa), attributing them vari-ously to the philosophers, the adherents of kal ̄am(al-mutakallim ̄un),and to theÓHaverhimself.In V:10, theÓHaverpresents the views of the mutakallim ̄unand of-fers an account that accords with traditional Islamic accounts of proph-ecy. Speaking of a person whose constitution of body and soul is bal-anced, he notes that such a personseeks advice and guidance, that God might inspire him [yulhimuhu] alongthe right path. This is one upon whom He will pour out a divine propheticspirit170if he is worthy of prophecy [nubuwwa] or [a divine spirit of] inspi-ration [ilh ̄ am] if he is below that, [in which case] he is a pious friend of Godand not a prophet.171(V:10: 200)In V:20 theÓHaveroffers a similar description in the context of a dis-course on his own views. TheÓHaversets forth this account of prophecyand miracles—based upon Islamic models and using Arabic terminol-ogy—as a traditional Jewish approach:The endeavor of one who obeys God’s religious laws172 is to find favor inHis eyes, and to place His desires before him. He seeks inspirations [ilh ̄ am ̄at]if he is a pious friend of God,173 or [seeks] miracles and wonders if he is aprophet, and if his people enjoy the divine pleasure on the basis of the condi-tions of time, place, and action, as set down in the Torah. (V:20: 220)As we would expect, theÓHaveroffers his view of prophecy as an explicitalternative to the tenets of the philosophers. The philosophers had por-trayed prophecy as the natural, humanly achieved end of a path towardhuman realization; God’s role in revelation is at first glance unclear.F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı writes that a person who has perfected his or her intellect andwhose soul has connected (ittaÓsalat) with the Active Intellectis [the one] of whom it is fitting to say that he is granted revelation [yuÓh ̄ailaihi—related to wa Óhy]. For a person is only granted revelation [yuÓh ̄a ilaihi]136Part Four"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"when he has reached this level, which is that there remains no intermediarybetween him and the Active Intellect. . . .And this emanation174which exists from the Active Intellect to thepassive intellect through the mediation of the acquired intellect is revela-tion [wa Óhy]. For the Active Intellect emanates175from the being176of theFirst Cause. And because of this it is possible to say that the First Cause isthe giver of revelation [al-m ̄uÓhy] to this person by the mediation of the Ac-tive Intellect.177How different in tone this is from theÓHaver’s view! F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı must goout of his way to inform his readers that it is possible to call the FirstCause the “giver of revelation;” he implies this is merely a metaphor.TheÓHaver, in contrast, stresses that the prophet seeks to do the will of apersonal, law-giving God. It is somewhat surprising that theÓHaverde-picts prophets as actively seeking miracles and wonders; this is an ele-ment that would seem out of place in rabbinic and Islamic models ofprophecy, and that would constitute “striving” (ijtih ̄ad) in Ha-Levi’seyes. However theÓHaverqualifies his assertion by stressing that in orderfor prophecy to take place, the conditions for prophecy set forth in theTorah must be fulfilled. Prophecy thus occurs by divine will and favor,not simply according to human effort.178In V:12, in contrast, theÓHaverdepicts a philosophical model ofprophecy, an integral part of his extended description of the views of thephilosophers. This account, drawn almost literally from an early treatiseof Avicenna, at first glance sounds much like the philosophical view thattheÓHaverclaims God seeks to disprove at Sinai:179In some people, the rational faculty is aided in180contact [ittiÓs ̄al] with theuniversal intellect [to such an extent] that it is lifted above181using logicalsyllogism [qiy ̄as] and deliberation; inspiration [ilh ̄ am] and revelation[wa Óhy] are rather sufficient sustenance [for it]. This special distinction182iscalled sanctification, and it is called sanctified spirit.183(V:12: 206)It is instructive to compare this passage with Avicenna’s expositionin the Healing(Shif ̄a’). There Avicenna writes of the person who pos-sesses “intuition”184that “it seems as though he knows everything fromwithin himself.” Given that there exist people who can find the middleterm of a syllogism without effort, Avicenna deduces the possibility of aperson of prophetic intellect who can find the middle terms of all syllo-gisms within him or herself:Thus there might be an individual whose soul is so supported [assisted]185bygreat purity and [a] great [capacity for] linking [ittiÓs ̄al] with first intelligibleThe Language of Prophecy137"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"principles that he blazes with intuition,186i.e., with the receptivity [to inspi-ration coming] from the Active Intellect concerning everything.Therefore the forms of all things contained in the Active Intellect areimprinted on his soul either all at once or nearly so, not that he acceptsthem merely on authority [taql ̄ıd], but on account of their logical orderwhich encompasses all the middle terms. For beliefs accepted on authority[taql ̄ıd] concerning those things which are known only through theircauses possess no rational certainty. This is a kind of prophecy [nubuwwa],indeed prophecy’s highest form, and the one most fitted to be called divine[holy] power;187it is the highest human faculty.188In the Shif ̄a’ Avicenna stresses that both in the case of ordinaryknowledge and in the case of prophecy, one must seek the middle term ofa syllogism. He explicitly establishes a continuum between ordinary phi-losophy—in which the seeking of the middle term of syllogisms is simplyslower—and prophecy, in which the middle terms come all at once,without effort.189In a variety of formulations, Avicenna describes the ef-fortless nature of the prophetic form of knowledge, which he terms “in-tuition” or “insight.”190In the account in V:12 that Ha-Levi borrows from Avicenna, how-ever, there is no mention of seeking the middle term of a syllogism; theprophet seems to be lifted above qiy ̄astotally. Dimitri Gutas sees this asan early formulation of Avicenna, in which he had not yet incorporatedthe linchpin of his mature account of prophecy—seeking the middleterm through insight—which ties it to more ordinary ways of know-ing.191Perhaps it is the sharp distinction between prophetic knowingand ordinary knowing in this early Avicennian view which made it at-tractive, or at least palatable, to Ha-Levi.Given that in this account the prophet seems to be lifted above qiy ̄astotally, prophecy might be said to flow directly from the universal intel-lect, and not from the cognitive faculties of the prophet. This is impor-tant to Ha-Levi’s thinking about prophecy, as Ha-Levi wants to make itclear that prophecy is not a natural phenomenon, the highest along thecontinuum of human thought. Prophecy is not inspired speech or think-ing, as in the thought of the Ikhw ̄an al- Ósaf ̄a’and the Karaite Yefet b. ¡El ̄ı.The divine origin of prophecy cannot be explained away, as in the philo-sophical account of prophecy.As we have seen, Ha-Levi deviates from this model with respect toprophetic vision—he introduces the element of the inner eye—but he re-fuses to describe prophetic speech in terms of natural human facultiesand capacities. The origin of the Torah is God, no matter how physicaldivine speech might seem.138Part Four"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"7. The Scene at Mt. SinaiWith this background, we are now in a good position to return to thescene at Mount Sinai. We can see what is at stake for Ha-Levi. He wantsto deny (1) that the revelation that took place at Mount Sinai can betraced to a lower form of inspiration, that is, illumination (ilh ̄ am) or di-vine support (ta™y ̄ıd); and (2) that it took place internally in the mind,through the assistance of an angel or a universal intellect which serves asa bridge to God. The initiator of prophecy, according to Ha-Levi, is notthe prophet who undergoes a process of intellectual purification, as in thethought of al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı, or who is uniquely gifted in connecting with theActive Intellect, as in Avicenna. The origin of prophecy is God.Ha-Levi anachronistically portrays God as setting out to remove theIsraelites’ skepticism and doubt, engendered by the philosophical notionof prophecy as the product of an inspired human intellect. TheÓHaverin-sists it was crucial that the people know that the Torah did not originatein the mind of Moses. While Ha-Levi has shown himself comfortablewith the language of inspiration and divine assistance with respect to theSages’ process of deciding law, he is adamant that the prophecy of Mosesand the revelation at Mount Sinai represent a completely different phe-nomenon, that of wa Óhy.With subtle irony, theÓHaverdepicts among the Biblical nation agroup of skeptics who doubt that God could really have spoken toMoses, a group whose notion of God’s transcendence is so refined that itwould be marred by the attribution to God of something so corporeal asspeech:Despite the people’s belief in what Moses had brought them after thosemiracles, there still remained in their souls a doubt: how could God addressa human being?—lest the origin of the Law be the opinion192or thought193of a human being, accompanied by inspiration [ilh ̄ am] and support [ta™y ̄ıd]from God. Address from a nonhuman being seemed far-fetched, sincespeech is physical. (I:87: 24)Ha-Levi’s Biblical anachronism is striking, for the Bible itself showsno hesitation in asserting that God spoke to Moses. By Ha-Levi’s time,however, Biblical anthropomorphism had become a burning issue; Ka-raites and philosophers alike took the rabbis to task for attributinghuman qualities to God. TheÓHaverthus acknowledges that philoso-phers, responding to Biblical anthropomorphism, seek to diffuse thephysical nature of revelation. TheÓHaverattributes to the philosophersThe Language of Prophecy139"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"the view that while inspiration or support may flow from the divine Ac-tive Intellect, prophetic speech itself issues from the mind of the prophet.We have seen such a view in the Ikhw ̄an al- Ósaf ̄a’, who attribute thesource of inspiration to the celestial spheres, but the words themselves tothe prophet. We may also see this in the view of Yefet b. ¡El ̄ı, who attrib-utes the source of inspiration to the Holy Spirit (ruaÓhha-qodesh); it isnot clear whether for Yefet the wording flows from the Holy Spirit orfrom the prophet. For philosophical rationalists, prophecy is not liter-ally divine speech, but is rather the product of an inspired human mind.Describing his own view, in contrast, theÓHaverasserts that in prep-aration to hear the Ten Words, the people did not undergo a crashcourse in philosophy. Their aim was not to purify the mind to receive in-spiration or assistance from the Active Intellect. Rather, they preparedthemselves to receive a prophetic revelation directly from God:God wanted to remove this doubt from them, so he commanded them[concerning] the requirement of inner and outer [purification], and madethe confirmation of it separation from women and preparation to hear thedivine word. The people prepared and readied themselves for the degree ofwa Óhy—or rather, to hear the address publically, all of them. (Ibid.)Ha-Levi echoes R. Nissim Gaon here, who argues similarly thatthere remained among the people some who doubted the prophecy ofMoses. God thus gave the nation at Sinai an experience of sensibleknowledge (yed¡iat ha-hargashot) so that they would know beyond theshadow of a doubt that these were the words of the living God.194Alsolike R. Nissim, Ha-Levi contrasts the sensory experience of the Jews atMount Sinai with indirect knowledge by proof. In this passage, how-ever, he is most concerned to refute the philosophical view of prophecyas mental inspiration (ilh ̄ am). TheÓHaverthus distinguishes explicitlybetween the prophetic revelation (wa Óhy) that took place at Mount Sinaiand the philosophical account of prophecy. He describes in detail thephilosophical view which the event at Sinai conclusively disproved forthe Israelites who experienced it:The people heard with distinctness195the words of the Ten Command-ments. . . . And these Ten Words the masses did not transmit from isolatedindividuals, nor from a prophet, but from God. However they did not havethe power of Moses for mush ̄ahadaof that great thing.196And the people believed from that day that Moses [peace be uponhim] was addressed by a word whose origin was God. Moses did not firsthave a thought or an opinion—lest prophecy be, as the philosophers con-140Part Four"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"tend, from a soul which has purified its thoughts and connected [tattaÓsilu]with the Active Intellect, which is called Holy Spirit197or Gabriel, andbeen inspired [yulhamu—related to ilh ̄ am]. Or perhaps it occurred to himimaginatively—in that moment in sleep, or between sleep and waking—that an individual had spoken to him, and that he heard his spoken wordin an imaginative mode in his soul, not with his ears, or that he saw in animaginative mode, not with his eyes, and then said that God had spokento him.These views were disproved in that great vision [mashhad] and the di-vine writing which followed the divine address, when He wrote those TenWords on two tables from a subtle substance and handed them over toMoses. And they saw that it was divine writing as they heard that it was di-vine address. (I:87: 24 – 25)TheÓHaver’s description of the philosophical view corresponds inbroad strokes to the views of intellectual and imaginative prophecy inthe thought of philosophers such as al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı and Avicenna. For al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı a process of learning and purification of thought is necessary forthe philosopher’s ultimate union with the Active Intellect. The philoso-pher must acquire primary intelligibles from the Active Intellect, deducecomplex knowledge through syllogistic reasoning, and thereby perfecthis or her own intellect.It is true that for al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı the Active Intellect initially supplies themind with its primary truths, and continually supplies the “light” bywhich the potential intellect passes into actuality.198However, it is onlywhen the intellect has completely purified itself of sensible dross andreached a level F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı terms “acquired intellect” that he or she can makeultimate contact (ittiÓs ̄al) with the Active Intellect and achieve revelation(wa Óhy) and immortality. It may be this process of intellectual purifica-tion that Ha-Levi has in mind when speaking of the prophet cleansinghis thoughts, uniting with the Active Intellect, and being inspired. More-over F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı—like theÓHaver’s foil, the philosophical skeptic—explicitlylikens the Active Intellect to the angel of revelation, Gabriel, and to theholy or trustworthy spirit.199The imaginative aspect of prophecy is also clearly recognizablefrom the theories of both al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı and Avicenna.200Al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı and Avi-cenna both attribute this form of prophecy to an imagination especiallysensitive to impressions upon it, whether in sleep or—in someonewhose imagination is particularly active—in waking. They differ onlyin that Avicenna ascribes the source of these prophetic impressions toan emanation from the souls of the celestial spheres, while al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı at-tributes them to an emanation from the Active Intellect.The Language of Prophecy141"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"8. Ha-Levi’s Approach to the Sinai RevelationWith our understanding of the Islamic background and Ha-Levi’s termi-nology, we can now appreciate the complexity of his view. Ha-Leviwants to deny the philosophical account of prophecy, which seems tomake prophecy an individual achievement of human realization—an im-personal, spontaneous, natural ability attained by the prophet, as op-posed to a gift from the sovereign will of a personal God. Most impor-tantly, the philosophical account threatens to make the words ofprophecy human words rather than divine words. The Ikhw ̄an al- Ósaf ̄a’take this position explicitly; Sa¡adya is clearly disturbed by such a view.It is true that al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı and Avicenna do not state explicitly that theprophet is the source of prophetic language. However, they do describeprophecy as a natural phenomenon, the product of human faculties illu-mined by the Active Intellect.TheÓHaverexpresses in I:87 the most feared result of this position: ifprophecy is the natural product of a fully developed human mind, thenMoses, and not God, could mistakenly be said to be the author of theTorah. Elsewhere, theÓHaverstates clearly his conviction that the wordsof the Torah come directly from God, and not Moses:Our laws were laid down201in the Torah from the divine address202toMoses [which] he handed to the masses assembled in the desert. There wasno need to cite the support of other individuals, chapter by chapter, verseby verse.203Everything [was given] in explicit detail204by God. (I:99:33)Even the words that issue directly from the prophet’s mouth are notof human origin: “The speech of prophets at the time the Holy Spirit205enwraps them, is in every word directed from the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı;the prophetcannot alter a word (V:20: 221).206It is true that both al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı and Avicenna acknowledge that thesource of wa Óhyor ilh ̄ amis ultimately the Active Intellect—a divine ema-nation—and not the prophet’s own mind. However, for the philosophers,this is true of all human knowledge. In the Neo-Platonic scheme the linesbetween revelation, inspiration, and ordinary knowledge are blurred, forthere is a continuum between the human mind and the divine mind.If such philosophical views of prophecy were applied to the Bible,one could maintain that the events of revelation at Mount Sinai did nottake place “objectively” but were creations of the human imagination,and the Torah the product of an inspired human mind. The event at Mt.Sinai could be reduced to a group hallucination, the receiving of the142Part Four"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Torah to a natural process of learning by realized human beings, ratherthan the revealed words of a living God.Ha-Levi thus stresses the public, objective, external nature of therevelation at Mt. Sinai: that it is accompanied by lightning and thunder,that the people see Moses walk into a cloud, and see the cloud on themountain for days. Ha-Levi skillfully uses the language of witness to re-inforce his description of the event at Mount Sinai as wa Óhy—the directrevelation of an active divine agent—rather than a more vague internalform of inspiration such as ilh ̄ amor ta™y ̄ıd. In Ha-Levi’s use of the rootsh-h-dand the terms mashhad(pl. mash ̄ahid) (a vision or scene of a re-ligious event) and mush ̄ahada(witnessing), one sees Ha-Levi’s desire tostress the objective nature of revelation: that these were not just individ-ual, internal visions, but public displays or scenes, religious events whicha great multitude witnessed together and to which they could thereforegive valid testimony.207However, one should also note that although he uses the vocabularyof vision, not all of the manifestations the people witness are visual;some are auditory, for example the thunder that accompanies the light-ning. The Torah itself mixes the senses in its account of the events at Mt.Sinai, telling us that the people “saw the sounds.” Such a phenomenonbespeaks another state of consciousness; synesthesia is known cross cul-turally to be characteristic of altered states of awareness. Of course theTen Words themselves are presumably received aurally, rather than visu-ally. We find in Ha-Levi an echoing, although in reverse, of the Torah’slanguage of synesthesia.208The Torah states that the people “saw thesounds”; theÓHaverasserts that they were prepared to hearthe divineaddress publically and did hear some of the Ten Words, but they did nothave a capacity equal to Moses for the witness(mush ̄ahada) of that greatthing.209The root sh-h-dthus serves Ha-Levi here in its broadest sense oftestimony, indicating a witnessing that is not confined to the visual but isan all-encompassing experience, including all the senses—indeed everyfacet of a person’s being.210The people do experience a direct revelation from God; they are pre-pared for the level of prophetic revelation (wa Óhy), not the lower level ofinspiration (ilh ̄ am) or divine assistance (ta™y ̄ıd). Moreover they clearlyhave some capacity for mush ̄ahada, otherwise they would not witnessany divine manifestations at all. In essence then, the nation receives theTen Words directly from God, in prophetic witness. However on accountof their fear of the Divine, they cannot sustain the experience or thealtered state, as Moses could, to receive all the words of revelation.Ha-Levi thus follows rabbinic tradition according to which the peopleThe Language of Prophecy143"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"become afraid after hearing the first two of the Ten Words. Expressingthis rabbinic idea using his Arabic terminology, Ha-Levi writes: “Andthese Ten Words the masses did not hand down211from individual peo-ple, nor from a prophet, but rather from God. However they did nothave the capacity for the witness [mush ̄ahada] of that great thing”(I:87: 24).212Ha-Levi’s repeated use of the root sh-h-din this passage suggeststhat he wants to draw upon the root’s mystical associations. Ha-Levi’stext evokes the Sufi sense of mush ̄ahada, the state of witnessing the Di-vine with the inner eye of one’s heart, a motif which appears repeatedlyin Ha-Levi’s poetry. At the same time, the text alludes to the philosophi-cal notion we have seen in Avicenna, that mush ̄ahadais an unmediated,experiential form of knowing. Yet, because of its connotations of objec-tive witness and testimony, Ha-Levi can also use the root to prove thatthe event at Sinai was a direct manifestation of divine power, and thus tobolster his assertion that there is direct divine causality in the world(I:88 – 89: 25– 26). The conviction that God acts directly in the world—with no need for intermediary causes—is apparently one of the fruits ofprophetic experience according to Ha-Levi.TheÓHaverthus emphasizes that he does not need to establish anelaborate theory of how revelation and prophecy take place. All who di-rectly experience the Divine know that what they are witnessing is noproduct of the human imagination.9. Revelation as God’s Created SpeechIn I:89 theÓHaverconfesses:We do not know how the intention213became corporealized so that it be-came a word214which struck our ear, nor do we know how He createdsomething from that which was nonexistent or from that which was avail-able to him from among existing things. (I:89: 26)Like Philo and Sa¡adya Gaon before him, Ha-Levi is led to the no-tion of revelation as God’s created speech by two factors: the problem ofhow an immaterial God can speak when words seem to be physical en-tities, and the exegetical difficulties of the statement in Exodus 20:15that “all the people saw the sounds.” R. Aqiva explains the verse as a de-scription of synesthesia; the people both saw and heard that which wasvisible.215Sa¡adya develops from this the notion that when the Torahsays “God spoke,” it literally means that “God created a word which is144Part Four"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"conveyed through the air to the hearing of the prophet or the people.”216Philo, too, derives from the Biblical statement that “all the people sawthe sounds” (Exodus 20:15) the notion of a “newly created voice” thatthe people could both hear and see.217Ha-Levi, however, is less interested in the metaphysics of the issuethan is Philo and certainly than Sa¡adya, who develops the theory of a“second air” in which the divine speech is created.218He thus has theÓHavercharacteristically hedge his explanation in I:91:219TheÓHaver: I do not assert authoritatively that the thing was like this de-scription, and perhaps it was in a way more difficult to comprehend than Icould imagine. Nevertheless, the result of this was that whoever witnessed[sh ̄ ahada] those theophanies [mash ̄ahid] had conviction that the thing wasfrom the Creator, without an intermediary.It is to be compared to the first act of creation. The belief in the lawconnected with those theophanies [mash ̄ahid] is as firmly established in themind as the belief in the creation of the world, and that He created it in thesame manner in which, as is known, He created the two tablets, the manna,and other things. Thus disappear from the soul of the believer the doubts ofthe philosophers and materialists. (I:91: 26 – 27)It is clear from I:87– 91 that the focus of Ha-Levi’s attention is notwhether the scene (mashhad) at Mt. Sinai is ultimately to be traced tothe outer, physical eye or to the inner, spiritual eye; or whether the man-ifestations witnessed are themselves physical, spiritual, or some interme-diate between the two. TheÓHavermakes very clear what concerns himultimately: that “whoever witnessed [sh ̄ ahada] those scenes [mash ̄ahid]had conviction that the thing was from the Creator, without an interme-diary;”220and that “the belief in the Law connected with those theopha-nies [mash ̄ahid] is as firmly established in the mind as the belief in thecreation of the world.” Direct witness (mush ̄ahada) provides certainty, adirect, personal relationship to God, and firm conviction in the divineorigin of the Law.Our examination of Ha-Levi’s account of the Sinai revelation sug-gests that for Ha-Levi the experience of prophetic witnessing(mush ̄ahada) is not simply visual, but has broader experiential over-tones. We will see how these overtones come to the fore in Ha-Levi’s de-piction of the story of Abraham.The Language of Prophecy145"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"PART 5The Language of Intimacy (Uns),Longing (Shawq) and Love (¡Ishq)1. The Language of Love in Ha-Levi’s PoetryWe have seen in our discussion of ittiÓs ̄althat Ha-Levi regards the humanconnection with God as a true relationship between two parties; Ha-Levi is more interested in the experiential dimension to the language ofittiÓs ̄althan he is in any suggestion of ontological union. This does notnecessarily imply that the idea of mystical union was offensive to him.However, in Ha-Levi’s view it is precisely the element of mutuality thatis the key to the divine-human relationship. Ha-Levi’s vision of ittiÓs ̄alsuggests the Jewish covenantal ideal: a concrete, mutual relationship oflove, commitment, and loyalty.We find in Ha-Levi’s poetry expression of the intensity of the poet’ssearch for such a relationship with God, the pathos of his longing to bemet by the divine beloved:O Lord, before Thee is my whole desire—Yea, though I cannot bring it to my lips.Thy favour I would ask a moment and then die—Ah, would that mine entreaty might be granted!That I might render up the remnant of my spirit to Thine hand,Then should I sleep, and sweet my sleep would be.When far from Thee, I die while yet in life;But if I cling to Thee I live, though I should die.1In the last two lines we find an expression of Ha-Levi’s view of theafterlife. True connection with God is available in this life, and guaran-tees life in the world to come, just as theÓHaverasserts in the Kuzari:147"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"For one whose soul is attached [ittaÓsalat nafsuhu] to the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıwhile heis [still] busy with the accidents of the body, it stands to reason that he willjoin [yattaÓsilu] [the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı] when he withdraws and leaves this uncleanvessel. (III:20: 110)The promises of all these laws are included under one principle: the ex-pectation of drawing near to God and his angels. One who has reached[waÓsala] this level need not fear death; our Law has demonstrated thisplainly (I:109: 36 – 37).What we find further in the poem is confirmation that Ha-Levi madean association between the Arabic ittiÓs ̄aland the Hebrew devequt:2When I am far from Thee, I die while yet in life;But if I cling [edbaq] to Thee I live,though I should die.We witness here the poet’s experience of being far from God andbeing drawn near. In the next stanza, Ha-Levi expresses his convictionthat it is through service of God that human beings are able to drawclose—even to reach and cling—to God. Indeed, we hear an echo of theKhazar King’s search for the true way to worship the Divine:Only I know not how to come before Thee,Nor what should be my service nor my Law.Show me, O Lord, Thy ways!And turn me back from bondage of my folly.3In other poems we hear the answer to this quest to “show me Thyways.” It is through the mitsvot, the Jewish framework for service of God,that the Divine can be met in human experience. We find this expressedmost clearly in Ha-Levi’s poems about the experience of prayer; throughprayer, the poet attests, God becomes an ever-present companion:With all my heart—O Truth—and all my mightI love You, with my limbs and with my mind.Your Name is with me: Can I walk alone?With it for lover, how can I be lorn?With it for lamp, how can my light go dim?How can I slip with it the stick by which I stand?They mock who do not understand: The shameI bear because I bear Your name is pride to meSource of my life, I bless You while I live;My Song, I sing to You while yet I breathe.4148Part Five"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"As Raymond Scheindlin has pointed out, the opening lines of thispoem recall the language of the Shema¡, a central Biblical call to the loveof God:Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord aloneYou shall love the Lord your God with all yourheart, with all your soul, and with all your might.And these words which I command you this day shall be onyour heart.You shall speak of them when you sit in your house,when you walk upon the way,When you lie down and when you rise up.Scheindlin notes that in Ha-Levi’s poem, the narrator in one senseexpresses the collective experience of Israel, who suffer for God’s name.At the same time, he expresses a very personal sense of God’s presence,not just as a desire, but as an actual fact. In the Shema¡, the believer isenjoined to love God and to speak of God always. In this poem, the poetdeclares that the Shema¡’s injunction has become a fact: God’s Name iswith him as an ever-present source of sustenance.5Through prayer, thepoet asserts, he sings to God and blesses the Source of his life; in re-sponse, his way is illumined by the lamp of God. Note too that the poet’slove for God is a passionate and embodied love. He worships God withhis very limbs, and not with his mind alone. Like Abraham, he is willingto suffer for the God he knows not merely by logic, but by taste.Ha-Levi most dramatically expresses his sense of the nearness ofGod—despite God’s awesome transcendence—in one of his most fa-mous devotional poems:Lord, where shall I find Thee?High and hidden is Thy place;And where shall I not find Thee?The world is full of Thy glory.6There are many paradoxes expressed in this poem: God is presenteverywhere, but cannot be contained anywhere; God is found within ourhearts, but is the Creator of the external world. The Lord is transcendentand remote from all creatures, and yet is closer to them than their ownbody and soul.7In contrast to the world-denying dualism of the ascetics,the poet affirms the inherent goodness of the world. God is fully present,indeed the whole world is full of God’s glory. We find a striking parallelThe Language of Intimacy, Longing and Love149"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"to this poem in the first gate of Ba Óhya’s Duties of the Heart. Ba Óhya ex-presses the paradox in the name of “one of the pious” [ba¡Ód al- Ós ̄aliÓhin]—which usually refers to a non-Jewish source—who prayed:”My God,where can I find Thee? Nay, where can I not find thee? Hidden and invis-ible art Thou; Yet the universe is filled with Thee.”8It is in moments of prayer, in calling out to God, that the poet expe-riences the miracle of God’s nearness. The poet is not only the seeker,but also the sought, not only a lover of God, but also God’s beloved:I have sought Thy nearness,With all my heart have I called TheeAnd going out to meet TheeI found Thee coming toward me.As Bernard Septimus has noted, Ha-Levi draws here upon a mid-rashic account of the event at Mount Sinai. The Bibical text tells us thatMoses brought the people out to meet God. The rabbis point out thatthe term to meet(liqrat) carries a sense of motion toward someone whois himself coming forward; the people go out to meet a God who is him-self coming forth to meet them. Hence, “the Shekhinahwent out to meetthem as a groom goes out to meet a bride.”9For Ha-Levi, the personalaspect of relationship with God is not one-sided: the seeker is actuallymet by God, who is also in search of the seeker. The relationship is oneof genuine mutuality; God needs human beings just as human beingsneed God.The notion of the inner eye or the eye of the heart, which we ex-plored above, finds expression in Ha-Levi’s poetry as well. Yehudah Rat-zaby and Raymond Scheindlin have shown the influence of Sufi poetryon Ha-Levi’s liturgical poems.10Among the Sufi themes we find in Ha-Levi’s poetry is that while the physical eye fails, the heart has the privi-lege of beholding God:To behold Him [la-Óhazoto] the eye fails,But from my flesh11He is revealed to my heart.12And in another poem:The Creator, who brought forth everythingfrom nothing,Is revealed to the heart,but not to the eye.13150Part Five"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"2. The Sufi Language of IntimacyIn the KuzariHa-Levi expresses these Sufi ideas in Arabic terms; Ha-Levi finds in the Sufi lexicon Arabic words to express the love, longing,and intimacy that characterize the relationship of a Jew with the Divine.TheÓHaverasserts that the Jewish experience of God is one of direct wit-ness (mush ̄ahada) and that the experience of witnessing God leads to anatural response of passionate love, worship, and obedience. In one pas-sage, he even speaks of ittiÓs ̄alin a way that suggests the Sufi notion ofunion with the divine beloved.TheÓHaverexplains in IV:15 that the meaning of the Bible’s genericterm for God (Elohim) can be known by logic; qiy ̄ascan prove that theremust be a God who orders and governs the world. The personal nameLord, in contrast, represents that God known to Israel through directwitness,14not through reason:As for the meaning of Lord, it cannot be grasped15logically,16but ratherexperientially [by witness],17by that prophetic vision by which a persongets to the point where he almost separates himself from his species and be-comes attached to [yattaÓsilu bi]18an angelic species.19(IV:15: 167– 68)TheÓHavercites several Biblical expressions that illustrate this pro-cess by which a prophet transcends the human, by which there befallshim another spirit: “you will become another man,”20“and God gavehim another heart”21“and a spirit enwrapped [lavsha] Amasai,”22“thehand of the Lord was upon me,”23“uphold me with your free spirit.”24All of these expressions, theÓHaverasserts, “are allusions to the spirit ofholiness [ruaÓh ha-qodesh] that enwraps [is on intimate terms with,mul ̄abisa] the prophet at the time of his prophesying” (IV:15: 168).Ha-Levi’s Hebrew and Arabic vocabulary are of note here. The He-brew root l-b-sh, like its Arabic cognate l-b-s, signifies enclothing. TheBiblical phrase “A spirit enclothed [lavsha] Amasai,” which theÓHaverquotes, thus invokes the image of the prophet Amasai’s being en-wrapped by the spirit. In the Arabic, however, Ha-Levi uses the activeparticiple of the third form, whose primary sense is to be in close associ-ation or on intimate terms with; we find a similar use in Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, whowrites that “intimate experience [mul ̄abasa] of [the prophetic] state istasting [dhawq].”25Ha-Levi thus takes advantage of the literary possibilities of Judaeo-Arabic culture. By juxtaposing the Hebrew lavshaand the Arabicmul ̄abisa, Ha-Levi draws upon two images for the relationship of theHoly Spirit with the prophet: one of a garment in close physical contactThe Language of Intimacy, Longing and Love151"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"with the prophet’s body, and one of the spirit of holiness in close associ-ation with the human spirit. Both suggest the intimacy of the relation-ship between God and the prophet, particularly when he or she is beingprophetically inspired.26The prophet, graced with the Holy Spirit, is freed from the doubtswhich plagued him or her when searching for God through qiy ̄as. Whatreplaces doubt is passionate love, service, and the bliss of ittiÓs ̄al. Theprophet becomesa servant of God,27passionately in love28with the object of his worship,29almost annihilating himself out of his love,30due to the greatness of thebliss31of union [ittiÓs ̄al] he feels, and the pain and suffering in being apartfrom Him. (IV:15:168)32The passionate lover we find here is well known in Arabic poetry ofboth sacred and secular love; we often see him on the verge of deathwhen separated from the bliss of union with his beloved.33Sufi writers,like theÓHaverhere, weave together imagery of passionate love, worship,and obedience even unto death, as in the following verse of an early Is-lamic poet:If you would say, “Die!”I would die in perfect obedienceAnd would say to the one who calls me to death:“Welcome, welcome!”34The connection between love and obedience is likewise expressed inthe following verses quoted by Ghazz ̄al ̄ı:You are disobedient to God and pretend to love HimThat is, by my life! a very novel action:If your love were sincere, you would obey Him,For the lover is obedient to him whom he loves.35Love inspires the ultimate obedience and surrender, as anotherpoem quoted by Ghazz ̄al ̄ı illustrates:I want union [wuÓs ̄ul] with him, and he wantsseparation from me;Therefore I give up what I want for what he wants.36152Part Five"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Ha-Levi’s “worshiping servant, passionately in love with the objectof his worship, ready to annihilate himself out of his love,”37is thus thehero of Sufi literature; Ha-Levi’s language in IV:15 echoes the ideals ofIslamic pietism. The phrase “bliss of union” (ladhdhat al-ittiÓs ̄al) also hasSufi resonance; Sufi mystics use the root l-dh-dh—signifying joy, sweet-ness, delight or bliss—to suggest the subjective experience, the pleasur-able sensation of “tasting” union with the divine beloved.38As we have seen, however, these terms can encompass a broadrange of meaning;39Ha-Levi’s language of union does not mean that heregards ittiÓs ̄alas ontological oneness or unio mystica, as do the mostradical Sufis. On the other hand, his pairing of the term ittiÓs ̄alwithladhdhadoes add an ecstatic, passionate dimension to the divine-human relationship, transforming the covenantal bond we see else-where in the Kuzari.Strikingly, theÓHavergoes on to contrast the blissful experience ofunion with the Divine to the intellectual refinement of the pseudo-philosophers:This forms a contrast to those who dabble in philosophy,40who see in theworship of God nothing but extreme refinement, extolling Him in truthabove all other beings—just as the sun is placed on a higher level than othervisible things—and [who see] in the denial of God nothing more than thebaseness of a soul content with a lie. (IV:15: 168)In drawing such a stark contrast, theÓHaverignores the fact thatphilosophers, too, use the term ittiÓs ̄alto extoll the joy of contact withthe Divine. However, while philosophers describe this as intellectualcontact with the divine intelligence,41theÓHaverpoints here to ittiÓs ̄alwith a distinctly Sufi, non-philosophical flavor and discredits the philo-sophical path to God as indirect, uncertain, and uncommitted. TheÓHaverargues that a person would be willing to die rather than be de-prived of One with whom he or she has experienced the bliss of union,whereas he denies one would perish at the thought of being without theresults of a syllogism.42TheÓHaver’s prime concern is thus the commitment, love, and obedi-ence awakened when one knows God through direct experience. Unionwith an abstract intellect, he argues, cannot have the emotional impactof union with a Person to whom one is devoted. Direct knowledge ofGod is transformative and not merely cognitive. Conversely, the Kingpoints out that according to Aristotle, God himself has no knowledge ofindividuals. Without such personal knowledge—human knowledge ofGod, and God’s knowledge of individual human beings—a relationshipThe Language of Intimacy, Longing and Love153"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"of loyalty and service makes no sense. For Ha-Levi, ittiÓs ̄alas union witha personal God and ittiÓs ̄alas covenant with God go hand in hand.3. Love, Longing, and the God of AbrahamThe King’s epiphany in IV:16 echoes this sentiment, and is in many waysthe heart of the Kuzarias a whole. TheÓHaveridentifies the generic Godof the Bible with the God of Aristotle and the Lord with the God ofAbraham:The Lord one yearns for tasting [dhawqan] and directly witnessing[mush ̄ahadatan],43whereas to God we incline through syllogistic reasoning[qiy ̄as]. And this tasting prompts one who grasps it to be consumed in lovefor him, and to prefer death [to being] without him, whereas that reasoning[only] demonstrates that veneration is incumbent so long as one is notharmed and does not suffer pain. (IV:16: 168 – 69)For theÓHaver, it is not only actual taste and witness of God thatcharacterize Jews’ relationship with the Divine, but the yearning(shawq) to partake of such a relationship. Ha-Levi chooses a key Sufiterm to express this idea: shawq, like mush ̄ahada, is one of the spiritualstates one attains on the Sufi path by the grace of God.44Ha-Levi sug-gests here that the human longing to be close to God—a longing he ex-presses so poignantly in his poetry—is in fact the core of Jewish faith.45The Biblical ancestors devoted their lives to a God whom they could notbear to live without. TheÓHaver’s language here is reminiscent of a versequoted by Ghazz ̄al ̄ı:The day of separation is longer than the day ofResurrection,And death is more beautiful than the pain of beingseparated.46Ha-Levi also makes full use of the resonance of mush ̄ahadain thispassage. A witness (sh ̄ ahid) can offer accurate testimony (shah ̄ada); onewho has witnessed God can give the only indubitable testimony to God’sexistence—or better yet, presence. The language of witness is also key tothe Arabic love poetry of the Middle Ages. The love-sick individual will-ing to die for the divine beloved is a witness/martyr (shah ̄ıd) to God.47TheÓHaverexpands on the King’s theme of such ultimate witness byrelating it to the story of Abraham. Whereas philosophers would notsuffer for a mere idea, Abraham rightly suffered through his various154Part Five"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"trials. As we saw earlier, theÓHaverdescribes Abraham’s painful buttransformative experiences using Sufi terms:Rightly Abraham bore what he bore . . . in his distressing resolution to sac-rifice Isaac, when he witnessed [sh ̄ ahada] the Divine by tasting [dhawqan],not by logic [qiy ̄asan]. He saw that not the smallest detail of his [doings]could escape God. He saw that He rewarded him instantly for his good,and that He guided him [yahdihi] on the right path to such an extent thathe did not move a step forward or backward without His permission.(IV:17: 169)TheÓHaver’s reference to the binding of Isaac illustrates most clearlythe breadth of Ha-Levi’s use of the term witness. Abraham’s experienceof witnessing through taste (sh ̄ ahada . . . dhawqan) was indeed a theo-phany. Ha-Levi does not necessarily use the term mush ̄ahadato indicatethat Abraham “saw” the angel who addressed him. Rather, by using theSufi terms witnessand taste, Ha-Levi suggests that whatever Abraham’sexperience was, it had nothing whatsoever to do with logic; Abrahamfound God in the intensity of this key moment in his life.It is striking, too, how the nuance of religious experience has beenbroadened in this passage, through use of the familiar Islamic root h-d-yfor divine guidance. Abraham’s religious experience included whateverdirect witness he had of the Divine, but also his realization that theevents of his life showed immediate reward and punishment:He saw that there was nothing of the details of his [doings] that was hid-den, and he saw that [God] rewarded him instantly and guided him on hisright course to the point where he did not make a move forwards or back-wards without [God’s] permission. (IV:17: 169)Similarly, the priest or the prophet’s guidance by the Holy Spiritcould extend to general guidance beyond specifically prophetic orpriestly functions (IV:15: 168). God likewise promises the people of Is-rael they will be guided as a nation: “you will witness [sa-tush ̄ahid ̄una]that an order higher than the natural order guides your order.” The Jewswill become aware of God’s constant providential care, hidden or vis-ible, in both nature and history (I:109: 36). Ha-Levi in fact seems to connect these two forms of religious experi-ence: witnessing God through taste, and awareness of divine guidance.Abraham did not engage in theological proof; he became convinced—not through mental reflection but through direct experience—that thepresence of God was guiding him. Through his experience of God bytaste, Abraham saw that his footsteps were guided.The Language of Intimacy, Longing and Love155"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"TheÓHaverthen goes on to make a logical leap not taken, for exam-ple, by the Arabic thinker Ibn ÓTufayl. One who has tasted the Lord di-rectly would scoff at the intellectual path he or she had once taken toknow the Divine:So then how could he not belittle his former syllogistic reasoning [qiy ̄as ̄ at]?As the Sages explain the verse “He brought [Abraham] outside” [Gen.15:5] [as meaning] “give up your study of the stars!” [Shabbat156a]. Thatis to say, he commanded him to relinquish his speculative study of the starsand other things, and to take upon himself obedience [Ót ̄ a¡a] to Him whomhe had perceived by taste [dhawqan],48as it is said, “Taste and see that theLord is good” [Psalm 34:9].49For Ha-Levi it is axiomatic that the appropriate response to directexperience is to become obedient to God. Direct, sensory, personalknowledge—in contrast to knowledge through qiy ̄as—awakens emo-tions that foster loyalty.50We see, too, that Ha-Levi has built the entire passage around exege-sis of a psalm which combines language of taste and seeing. It is oftensaid that Hebrew thought builds on the sense of hearing, as opposed tothe Greeks’ emphasis on sight—the most common example given is theinjunction “Hear O Israel!” (shema¡ Yisrael). Ha-Levi finds one verse inthe Bible supporting his conviction that taste and sight, as the most di-rect and irrefutable of the senses, are the metaphors most apt for relig-ious experience. Whereas one can hear another person’s syllogistic proofand assent to it, it is only for oneself that one can taste or see—and it isonly seeing for oneself that awakens true love for God.TheÓHaverlinks this seeing specifically with Israel and asserts it islacking in other nations. The Lord is the God of Israel because only Is-rael possesses the ability to taste and see God.51TheÓHaveraffirms thatevery person who follows the divine Lawfollows the people of this seeing.52Their souls take pleasure in reliance ontheir authoritative traditions [taql ̄ıd], in [spite of] the simplicity of theirparables—a pleasure they do not take in reliance on the authoritative tradi-tions [taql ̄ıd] of the philosophers, in [spite of] the delicacy of their tales,and the excellent arrangement of their compositions, and the brilliance oftheir demonstrations.53Nevertheless, the masses do not follow them, fortheir souls are inspired [wuÓhiya] with the truth, as it is said, “The words oftruth are recognizable.” (Sota 9b) (IV:17: 169)We saw in our discussion of qiy ̄asthat theÓHaveruses the termtaql ̄ıdironically, insisting that reliance on someone who has had a direct156Part Five"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"experience of God is more certain than relying on the indirect, waver-ing human intellect. This is ironic because the way of qiy ̄ashad beentouted as the way of the elite, with taql ̄ıdconsigned to the uneducatedmasses. Ha-Levi deflates the pretension of the intellectual elite, envi-sioning in its place a spiritual elite based on the capacity for direct re-ligious experience.TheÓHaverpoints out that philosophers do not discover philosophi-cal truths ex nihilo, but rely on Aristotelian tradition, putting as muchfaith in the words of Aristotle as the religious masses do in the words ofthe Sages. The philosophers, then—with all their pretense to the origi-nality of qiy ̄as—simply practice another form of taql ̄ıd.54The masses,however, by a native intuition which theÓHaverdescribes as a form ofrevelation (wa Óhy), are inspired to rely for religious truth on the Sages,not the philosophers.In a curious way then, Ha-Levi places the masses above the philoso-phers. The intellectual elite are distracted by the pseudo-sophisticationof logical proof (burh ̄an). The masses, on the other hand, sense thattruths which are missed in the niceties of qiy ̄ascan be found in the sim-ple wisdom of the Sages. The masses enjoy a kind of religious intui-tion—which he calls wa Óhy—simply in knowing upon whom to rely fortruth. For Ha-Levi, such pure-hearted reliance (taql ̄ıd), in contrast to thedry syllogisms of the philosophers, expresses true love for God.4. Intimacy (Uns)for Ha-Levi’s AgeDid Ha-Levi, then, believe that all that was left for Jews in his time wastaql ̄ıd? Did Jews in his day not have the possibility of intimacy withtheir Lord? TheÓHaverdoes suggest in III:1 that the intimacy with Godenjoyed by Abraham and the prophets is lacking in his age; exile andthe absence of the Shekhinahprevent attempts at the contemplative lifefrom reaching fruition.55Biblical figures such as Enoch and Elijah whospent time in seclusion did not suffer from loneliness; they retired fromthe company of humans to the company of angels.56Indeed, in a strik-ing use of Sufi terms, theÓHaverasserts that solitude and seclusion57be-came their very fellowship (uns). It is rather in human company thatsuch prophets would feel lonely,58for they miss contemplation(mush ̄ahada) of the angelic realm (III:1: 90).59However, ascetics in hiscontemporary age, unlike the prophets of old, do not make contact(yattaÓsil) with the divine light, which would offer them the intimatefellowship (ya’nasu ilaiha—related to uns) it did the prophets of old(III:1: 136).The Language of Intimacy, Longing and Love157"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Intimacy or fellowship (uns) is another Sufi stage on the path, alongwith longing (shawq) and passionate love (¡ishq). Intimacy removes thefear of loneliness. A classical Sufi text tells the story of a Sufi master whoplaced his disciple in a very lonely corner and forgot him for a week.When he returned and asked his student to forgive him, the student re-plied, “Do not worry; God has taken away the fear of loneliness fromHis friend.”60While in this story intimacy (uns) leaves no room for wa Óhsha(“feel-ing frightened by loneliness”), the latter term can also be used for thefeeling of estrangement from all creation which can accompany inti-macy with God.61It is precisely this paradox that Ha-Levi expresses inIII:1. While the contemplative prophets of old could be fulfilled in thepresence of angels and lonely in human community, those who attemptasceticism today will experience the loneliness of human isolation.Thus the best hope for intimacy with God today is in community.While Ha-Levi as poet does express an acute mystical longing, much ofthis longing for contemplation is expressed in the realm of liturgicalpoetry. As in the Kuzari, Ha-Levi the poet suggests that God is met mostintimately through Jewish communal prayer. On the other hand, Ha-Levi’s poetry does express an impulse toward withdrawal for commun-ion with God that cannot be easily squared with certain passages of theKuzari.62However, we find resolution of this tension in the Kuzariin the fig-ure of Abraham. Abraham’s passionate love for God is expressedthrough painful human trials; the loneliness he experiences is not that ofthe solitary ascetic, but that of the engaged man of faith, taking those ac-tions in the world required by God. This is the model of intimate rela-tionship and passionate love that Ha-Levi esteems. Using Sufi terms, Ha-Levi transforms the Sufi ideal of ascetic isolation to reflect a Jewish ideal:a path of love for God that can hazard the travails of this world.158Part Five"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Conclusions1. General Remarks: Ha-Levi’s Transformation of TerminologyWhat, then, has our exploration of Ha-Levi’s terminology shown usabout the Kuzari? We have seen that Ha-Levi is keenly sensitive to nu-ances of language; he is a master of Arabic prose and uses the soundsand rhythms of the Arabic language to underscore key themes. Ha-Leviis clearly aware of the power of the Arabic terms he chooses, and usesthem with ironic twists to draw in his Judaeo-Arabic readers.Like Maimonides in his Eight Chapters on Ethics(Shemonah Per-aqim), Ha-Levi may be addressing Jews drawn to Sufi spirituality andasceticism. We have seen that he never mentions the Sufis by name, thatthe Sufi is the absent interlocutor in the dialogue, whose presence isevoked only through characteristic terms and themes. These terms andthemes are at the heart of the dialogue, however.While theÓHaver mentions his Karaite and philosophical opponentsby name, he alludes to Sufism only indirectly. Perhaps this indicates thatHa-Levi does not see the Sufi as an opponent. Ha-Levi’s religious sen-sibility has much in common with certain aspects of Sufi spirituality; hisdevotional poems show the influence of Sufi poetry.1The fact that theSufi is absent as an opponent shows to what extent Ha-Levi has internal-ized and identified with certain Sufi spiritual ideals. Ha-Levi appropri-ates Sufi terminology to describe Jewish religious experience, while de-nying certain ideas associated with the mystical path—for example, thenotion that asceticism and isolation are a component of the true spiri-tual life. His approach is thus very different from that of Ba Óhya ibnPaq ̄uda, who adopted not just the literary form of a Sufi manual, butalso ascetic ideals of the Sufi path.Scholars have long noted that Ha-Levi stands out in the history ofJewish philosophy for his emphasis on concrete experience and the par-ticulars of Jewish history over universal categories of logic. Our studyhas revealed a new dimension to Ha-Levi’s project: he is a phenomenol-ogist of religion, creatively adapting the new Arabic vocabulary of relig-ious experience to the Jewish context.159"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Ha-Levi does this in several striking ways. He uses the termmush ̄ahada for both the individual religious experience of Abraham andthe collective revelation at Mount Sinai; similarly, he uses the term ittiÓs ̄alto describe both God’s connection with individuals from Adam to theprophets and God’s collective covenant with the Jewish people. Ha-Levithus invests Jewish communal experience with the privileged statuswhich individual religious experience had come to hold in the medievalworld. At the same time, he creates a new focus on the experiential di-mension within Judaism. The goal of his project is thus twofold. Byusing Islamic vocabulary to describe Jewish religious experience, he im-plicitly translates the language of classical Judaism into a universal, ex-periential language with contemporary appeal. This translation is alsocritical in nature; it involves a transvaluation of the Sufi experience.We have seen that while Ba Óhya adopts both the language of Sufismand its ascetic ideals, Ha-Levi shows an ambivalent relationship to theSufi terminology he adopts. While he is clearly influenced by certain di-mensions of Sufi spirituality, he is also critical of the ascetic excesses towhich some are drawn on the Sufi path. He suggests that the basic im-pulse of the Jew attracted to Sufi asceticism is valid, as is the basic im-pulse of the philosopher, the Karaite, and even the practitioner of theoccult. All seek to draw near to the Divine; and, indeed, how we are todraw near to the Divine in this life is the Kuzari’s central concern. ForHa-Levi, however, it is not simply that the Karaite, the occultist, thephilosopher, and the Jew attracted to Sufi asceticism have chosen thewrong means of reaching God; they have misunderstood the nature ofthe journey.Ha-Levi suggests each of these seekers err because they conduct theirsearch through human qiy ̄asand striving (ijtih ̄ad); they believe that thepath to God is one human beings themselves can map out. Ha-Levi findsa fundamental flaw in this approach. Only God, and not human beingscan show us the way to the Divine, and God has done so through revela-tion. The event at Mount Sinai is a self-disclosure of the Divine, a reve-lation of the awesome reality of God’s presence. That reality—directlywitnessed by the entire Jewish nation—grounds the authority of God’scommandments.Ha-Levi is sensitive both to the intensity of individual contact withGod and to the centrality of community for Jewish religious experience.He portrays degrees of contact (ittiÓs ̄al) with the Divine, insisting thatGod’s providential guidance of Jewish history in itself creates a powerfulconnection in which every member of the nation participates. Jewishcommunal life is an essential vehicle for religious experience; Jews find160Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"God’s presence not as isolated seekers, but in community. The mitsvotconstitute a bond (Ósila from w-Ós-l) between Jews and God. The threedaily times of prayer and Shabbat, in particular, are set aside for ittiÓs ̄alwith the Divine, to serve God in joy, not contrition—a joy that may evenlead to singing and dancing.Ha-Levi therefore fundamentally inverts the image of ittiÓs ̄alin the Is-lamic world. Union with the divine realm is not reached by a disembod-ied intellect, as the philosophers would have it, nor by the isolated as-cetic, as some Sufis would claim. Nor need one wait for the afterlife toachieve ittiÓs ̄al. Connection with God is experienced by Jews first of all inthis world through the communal life of mitsvot. This “taste of theworld to come” will naturally continue and come to full fruition in theafterlife.The ultimate degree of religious experience for Ha-Levi, as for mostmedieval Jewish thinkers, is prophecy (nubuwwa or nevuah); theprophet alone is privileged to receive direct divine communication(wa Óhy). At Mount Sinai, however, all the nation of Israel experiencedwa Óhy, if only briefly. Ha-Levi even suggests that diligent practice of themitsvotcan lead to the degree of wa Óhy,“the human level closest to thedivine [level]” (V:20: 223 – 224).In contrast, Ha-Levi is suspicious of any humanly invented path toreach God. All are prone to a common error: they seek to obtain byhuman striving that which is essentially a divine gift. Ha-Levi wants tomake clear, however, that true connection with God is available to all Is-rael, and that the divine Law—far from presenting a barrier to contactwith God—is an essential prerequisite for such communion. Ha-Levithus inverts the antinomianism of certain radical Sufis.Ha-Levi finds the Sufi term mush ̄ahada,and all its derivatives, a richresource for the expression of a distinctly Jewish religious ideal. Sufishad used the term mush ̄ahada to describe witness of God within anindividual’s heart. Philosophers, too, used the term to describe directperception of the Truth. Whereas logical analogy (qiy ̄as) is by its verynature indirect, witness (mush ̄ahada) and taste (dhawq) are immediateand irrefutable.One who has witnessed (sh ̄ ahada) God can offer reliable testimony(shah ̄ada).Ha-Levi takes this notion one step further: the nation of Is-rael as a whole witness the reality of God. The idea that Israel is a wit-ness to God is present in the Biblical book of Isaiah, in rabbinic mid-rash,2and in gaonic thought. However, Ha-Levi brings a new texture tothe idea by creatively appropriating the potent language of Sufi spiritu-ality. Direct witness of God (mush ̄ahada) is the province not of the Sufis,Conclusions161"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"he suggests, but of the nation of Israel. Throughout Jewish history, eld-ers, prophets, and Sages have testified to powerful encounters with theDivine—one need only call to mind the theophanies (mash ̄ahid,sing.mashhad) experienced by Moses and Elijah, or the visions (mush ̄ahad ̄at)of pious scholars such as R. Aqiva and R. Ishmael.Ha-Levi’s central paradigms for religious experience, however, arethe event at Mount Sinai and the life of Abraham. The event at MountSinai disproves the philosophical model of prophecy, which placesprophecy on a continuum with other modes of knowledge. The origin ofthe Torah, theÓHaver asserts, is not individual inspiration (ilh ̄ am) or di-vine assistance (ta™y ̄ıd) which philosophers claim to receive from the Ac-tive Intellect (1:87). Rather, the origin of the Torah is God. Philosophi-cally untutored, the nation of Israel received the Torah as wa Óhy, a directrevelation of the divine word. All who were witness (sh ̄ ahada) to thegrand theophanies (mash ̄ahid) at Sinai knew this to be a revelation fromthe Eternal—direct and unmediated.Ha-Levi describes Abraham’s encounter with God in similar terms:once Abraham had directly witnessed (sh ̄ ahada) the Divine, he aban-doned the indirect way of qiy ̄asto become an obedient servant of theLord. Ha-Levi uses the language and imagery of Sufi love poetry to con-vey the intensity of Abraham’s encounter with the One for whom hewould give his life—even the life of his beloved son. Ha-Levi does notstray from the rabbinic biography of Abraham, however, to paint Abra-ham as a solitary mystic or ascetic. Rather, Abraham enters into the cove-nant of circumcision—a sign of the ongoing, historical connection (ittiÓs ̄al)between God and his descendents, the Jewish people. Intimate connectionwith God, suggests Ha-Levi, need not take one away from community.This represents a fundamental rethinking of the Sufi ideals of ittiÓs ̄al andmush ̄ahada.Ha-Levi’s linguistic innovation was thus revolutionary.Using the terms ittiÓs ̄al and mush ̄ahada for both individual and collectivecommunion, Ha-Levi creates a new model of religious experience.2. Ha-Levi’s Rhetorical StrategiesHa-Levi employs several favorite rhetorical strategies cutting across ter-minological lines. Among them, we find the following:1. Ha-Levi Plays Off One Opponent against AnotherIn the opening dialogue, Ha-Levi plays off Sufi and philosophical no-tions of union (ittiÓs ̄al) against each other, and against what he sees as a162Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"more direct, concrete, and powerful religious experience: that found inthe relationship between the Biblical God and the people of Israel. Else-where, he sets the philosopher against the pious Christian or Muslim(I:110:38). TheÓHaverargues that the philosophers’ notion that one canachieve immortality by accumulating knowledge is as absurd as the re-ligious notion that one can save one’s soul by a mere verbal confession offaith.3In the same vein, Ha-Levi plays off the philosopher and the Sufiagainst the Orthodox Muslim (I:109: 36 – 38). Here theÓHaverupholdsmany of the Sufi and philosophical values associated with ittiÓs ̄aland jux-taposes them with the Orthodox conception of an afterlife. Choosingthe term maw¡id—a variant of wa¡d, which Orthodox Muslims use forthe promise of the afterlife—theÓHaverargues that connection with God(ittiÓs ̄al) is itself the greatest promise (maw¡id). However, he describeshere a form of ittiÓs ̄alcolored with themes from classical Jewishthought—an ittiÓs ̄althat is communal, this-worldly, and achievedthrough the life of mitsvot.2. Ha-Levi Also Plays One Term against AnotherWhereas for Sufis the virtue of submissiveness (khush ̄u¡) is associatedwith ittiÓs ̄al, theÓHavercontrasts the two (III:5: 94). He also plays the as-cetic view of ittiÓs ̄alheld by both philosophers and Sufis against the virtueof moderation (i¡tid ̄al), an alternative philosophical ideal. Rejecting adualistic, Neo-Platonic ideal of asceticism, theÓHaverinstead embracesthe Aristotelian doctrine of the mean. He argues that, like Platonic andAristotelian philosophy, the Torah commands moderation (i’tid ̄al) andjustice (¡adl), not extreme self-denial (II:50: 69).43. Ha-Levi Artfully Turns the Tables on His Opponentsa. Ha-Levi turns the Christian argument from history on its head.Against his Christian critics, theÓHaverargues that they cannot have itboth ways: if they extoll the spiritual virtue of suffering and lowliness,they cannot point to the Jews’ degraded status as a sign of God’s dis-pleasure (I:113: 38 – 39).b. TheÓHaveralso turns the tables on those who would criticize Ju-daism for a lack of philosophical sophistication. In fact, he argues, thephilosophers only turn to logical argument (qiy ̄as) because they lack themore fruitful gift which the Sages have: divine assistance and authentictradition (I:65: 17; V:14: 212).Conclusions163"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"c. Ha-Levi reverses the Karaite charge that the rabbis add to Biblicallaw through rabbinic legislation. TheÓHaverargues that it is the Karaiteswho add to the Torah by using their own human qiy ̄asto derive lawrather than relying on the tradition of the Sages (III:40 – 41: 124).d. Ha-Levi also reverses the potent charge that religious law standsin the way of union with God (ittiÓs ̄al). In his creative reinterpretation ofittiÓs ̄al, he suggests that mitsvotare not only not antithetical to religiousexperience, they are in fact essential to the achievement of ittiÓs ̄al(II:34:65; III:23: 112).e. In an incisive response to those attracted to Sufi ideals of asceti-cism, theÓHaversuggests that the human impulse to ascetic denial is ac-tually a form of egoistic self-assertion (ijtih ̄ad). The Law itself presents agreater challenge: the life of moderation, responding to God equallywith fear or awe (yir’ah), love (ahavah), and joy (simÓhah) (II:50: 70).Moderation requires a person to give each of these responses its due, justas one must give each human faculty its due, so that one may be “aprince obeyed by his senses” (III:5: 92).f. Responding to the charge that Judaism is an unspiritual, this-worldly religion, lacking in promises of the afterlife, Ha-Levi contrastsJewish this-worldly fulfillment with the afterlife portrayed in the Qur™ ̄an.Jewish fulfillment in this world, he suggests, is in fact more spiritual thanthe Islamic afterlife. Moreover, ittiÓs ̄alin this life will continue in theworld to come (I:104 – 9: 35– 38).3. Ha-Levi’s Relationship to Judaeo-Arabic Predecessorsa. R. Sa¡adya GaonWe have found that Ha-Levi was not writing in a vacuum, that he bothappropriates and alters concepts from his Judaeo-Arabic predecessors.In several instances, Ha-Levi directly borrows from Sa¡adya Gaon, bothin language and ideas. In a variety of contexts, Ha-Levi echoes a key pas-sage from Sa¡adya’s Book of Doctrines and Beliefswhich describes thepurpose of God’s self-revelation through the Glory. Sa¡adya asserts thatGod creates the light known as Glory (kavod) so that prophets mightinfer (yastadillu—from d-l-l, to show or prove) that they are actuallyhearing the word of God. Similarly, theÓHaverasserts that God appearsto the prophetic elite (Ósafwa), who witness God by what is known asGlory or the Shekhinahin order that he might prove to them (li-yadullahum—from d-l-l) that they had indeed been addressed by God(IV:3: 149).5164Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Ha-Levi is thus indebted to Sa¡adya for a significant element in histheory of revelation. Both thinkers suggest that visual experience is morepowerful than auditory experience; one who sees God’s Glory is con-vinced that the word which he hears is in fact divine. Ha-Levi, however,takes the idea further than Sa¡adya. He argues that the images prophetssee are more than a means of proof; they function as a vital symbolsystem, teaching the prophet through a visual, emotional language morepowerful than words alone (IV:5– 6: 159– 60).Furthermore, Ha-Leviweds Sa¡adya’s theory of the kavodwith his Sufi language of religiousexperience. TheÓHaverasserts that while God connects (yattaÓsilu) withall Jews, the prophets experience a more powerful degree of ittiÓs ̄alinwhich they witness (yush ̄ahid ̄una) God by means of the Glory (I:3: 149).Ha-Levi also echoes Sa¡adya’s language when he suggests that thevisual forms which the prophet sees are created specifically for theprophet. Sa¡adya had written that the Glory, cloud, and throne are eacha created form (Ós ̄ura makhl ̄uqa), newly produced (muÓhdathun), as is thespeech heard by the prophet. TheÓHaversays similarly that divine attrib-utes such as God’s majesty and power and the compassion of God be-come visible to the prophet in a great form created just for him (al- Ós ̄uraal-makhl ̄uqa lahu), which he sees instantaneously (IV:5: 160). TheÓHaveralso states, however, that it is not known whether the angels that Isaiahand Ezekiel saw were temporary manifestations created specifically forthe prophet, or permanent spiritual beings, which the philosophers iden-tify with the separate intelligences (IV:3: 158). Moreover, other passagesdo not make it entirely clear whether Ha-Levi holds that the image iscreated by God, or whether it is created by the mind of the seer.This suggests that Ha-Levi himself may have been agnostic with re-spect to certain theosophical descriptions he expresses through theÓHaver. Concerned most of all with the integrity of spiritual life, he of-fers his readers alternative philosophical options with one goal: to helpthem accept the reality of prophetic visions. His focus is not ultimatelyon the ontological status of the Glory or its spiritual forms, but on thefact that these images inspire awe, love, and reverence in the religiousbeliever.Similarly, Ha-Levi, like Philo and Sa¡adya before him, draws on thenotion of God’s created speech to explain the revelation at Mount Sinai.Ha-Levi’sÓHaver, however, is hesitant to endorse the precise metaphysicsof this explanation. What is important to him is the simple fact of directrevelation, which the experience at Sinai made indubitable.6While Ha-Levi seems to find Sa¡adya’s metaphysical explanations useful, he is farfrom asserting them as dogma.Conclusions165"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"It is true that Sa¡adya’s purpose is avowedly apologetic; he assertsthat he has written his book of theology to rescue fellow Jews from thesea of confusion. Sa¡adya, however, shows more conviction in his kal ̄amarguments than does Ha-Levi;7he exudes optimism about his project ofrationalizing the faith and rescuing the befuddled by means of rationalproof:If both the scholar and the learner follow this path in reading this book, thecertainty of him who feels certain will increase; the doubt of him that is indoubt will vanish. The believer who blindly relies on tradition [taql ̄ıd] willturn into one basing his belief on speculation [naÓzar] and understanding;those who put forth erroneous arguments will be silenced. Those who areobstinate and defy evidence will be ashamed; and the righteous and uprightwill rejoice. . . .In this way the innermost thoughts of a man will be purified andbrought into conformity with his outward behaviour; his prayer will besincere, as there will be enshrined in his heart an inner voice rebuking andsummoning him to right conduct, as the prophet says, “Thy words have Ilaid up in my heart, that I might not sin against Thee” (Psalm 119:11).Their faith will show itself in their dealing with each other; jealousybetween them in matters of this world will diminish. All will turn towardsthe Master of wisdom and not to anything else. He will be for them salva-tion, mercy and happiness, as God [be He praised and sanctified] has said,“Look unto Me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God,and there is none else” (Isaiah 45:22).All this will result from the disappearance of doubts and the removal oferrors. The knowledge of God and his Law will spread in the world like thespreading of water in all parts of the sea, as is said, “For the earth shall be fullof the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea” (Isaiah 11:9).8Sa¡adya shows not a trace of ambivalence about the value of logicalargument; he boldly proclaims the spiritual rewards of rationalizing thefaith. Ha-Levi’s stance in this matter is at first glance quite different.However, while his words on kal ̄amare biting,9Ha-Levi’s own use ofrational argument is not completely different from that of the kal ̄amtheologians, Sa¡adya among them.10As Leo Strauss points out, the veryform of dialogue detracts from the absolute nature of any oneinterlocutor’s statement.11Beyond this, Ha-Levi often has his protagan-ist theÓHaverhedge his assertions, or offer them as one of several pos-sibilities. Only select tenets are non-negotiable for Ha-Levi: foremost,the reality of direct revelation and the self-validating nature of pro-phetic experience. These convictions give integrity to one’s personal re-ligious life.166Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"Ha-Levi weds Sa¡adya’s ideas with Sufi language in another aspectof his prophetology. He describes the rabbinic story of the four whoenter a garden (pardes) as a vision of the divine realm. The one whodied could not bear witnessing (mush ̄ahada) that world, and his consti-tution disintegrated (inÓhalla tark ̄ıbuhu). Ha-Levi uses this same oddArabic phrase to describe prophets who strain to see a level of the Glorywhich they are not prepared to grasp: their constitution disintegrates(inÓhalla tark ̄ıbuhu).12This notion and language in fact have their originin Sa¡adya’s Book of Doctrines and Beliefs. In the key passage on theGlory discussed above, Sa¡adya asserts that only when they see God’sGlory do prophets become certain that God is speaking to them. How-ever, he then goes on to qualify this assertion. The light of the Glory isactually too brilliant for prophets other than Moses to behold; theprophet who dares gaze upon it—his constitution disintegrates (inÓhallatark ̄ıbuhu).Ha-Levi thus shares with Sa¡adya the notion that there are variousdegrees of divine light as well as degrees of spiritual ability to witnessthis light. Both thinkers suggest that some levels of the Glory can only beseen by the angels, and that Moses is superior to the rest of Israel in hisability to behold exalted levels of the Glory.13What is new in Ha-Levi is the link between these ideas and the lan-guage of mush ̄ahada. TheÓHaverasserts that the people did not haveMoses’ ability to witness the grand event at Mount Sinai, just as BenZoma lacked the ability of Rabbi Aqiva to witness the vision of thepardes. It is true that conceptually, the notion of witness was alreadypresent in the writings of Sa¡adya and other gaonim. R. Nissim Gaon,for example, argues that the nation of Israel knows the reality of God bysensible perception, whereas the other nations engage in proof; he evenquotes Isaiah’s statement that the people of Israel are witnesses to God.Ha-Levi weds these notions with Sufi terminology, and—most impor-tantly—places experience at the heart of things. Ha-Levi transformsgaonic ideas by investing them with a new experiential dimension thatwould speak powerfully to his contemporaries.14We find an additional possible borrowing from Sa¡adya in Ha-Levi’s parable of the travelers to India who arrive at (waÓsala ¡il ̄a) thepalace of the King (I:109). We recall that Sa¡adya had used the phrase“clinging in obedience” (l ̄azim ̄ına Ót ̄a¡a) to translate certain instancesin which the Bible speaks of people clinging (deveqim) to God.15Ha-Levi softens the language of union that he uses in this parable by echo-ing Sa¡adya’s conservative rendering of devequtas obedient service. TheÓHaversuggests that later generations of Jews took upon themselvesConclusions167"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"obedience (iltazama Ót ̄a¡a) to the Divine in order to make connection(li-yattaÓsila) with the King, knowing that connection (ittiÓs ̄al) is bliss(sa¡ ̄ada).As we saw in the previous chapter, we have some evidence from Ha-Levi’s poetry that he associated the Biblical language of clinging to God(devequt) with the Arabic notion of union or connection (ittiÓs ̄al)—an as-sociation that many Judaeo-Arabic thinkers and translators were mak-ing. Here, however, by echoing Sa¡adya’s conservative rendering of de-vequt, Ha-Levi’s language suggests that the way to connection with Godis through obedience or worship; arriving at God in a Jewish contextdoes not take one out of the domain of halakhic service. While Avi-cenna, for example, describes Sufi arrival (wuÓs ̄ul) as unitive absorptionin the one Truth that is God,16Ha-Levi describes arrival as respectfulobedience, rather than direct clinging. It is true that manuals of Sufipiety themselves enjoin acts of obedience (Ót ̄ a¡a). The more radical Sufis,however, would have seen these as characterizing the path to ittiÓs ̄alorwuÓs ̄ul, whereas Ha-Levi suggests that obedient worship characterizesthe life ofconnection and arrival with God.Ha-Levi thus borrows key terms, themes, and Judaeo-Arabic associ-ations from Sa¡adya Gaon. While the two thinkers’ overall attitude to-ward the value of rational argument may diverge somewhat, Ha-Leviand Sa¡adya show important similarities in religious temperament.b. BaÓhya ibn Paq ̄udaHa-Levi’s relationship to Ba Óhya ibn Paq ̄uda is not as clear as his relationto Sa¡adya. We found no direct borrowings from Ba Óhya in the Kuzari, al-though we noted one striking parallel in Ha-Levi’s poetry.17While Ba Óhyawas highly influenced by the ascetic strain of Sufism, Ha-Levi’s refer-ences to contemporary ascetism—in passages filled with Sufi language—are overwhelmingly negative.18Ba Óhya structures his work like a Sufimanual, with a step-by-step program for the spiritual life; Ha-Levi, incontrast, resists any systematic approach to spirituality outside theTorah’s commandments.Somewhat surprisingly, Ba Óhya—the pious unworldly ascetic—ismore appreciative of the value of philosophical and theological proofsthan is Ha-Levi.19Ba Óhya borrows from kal ̄am discourse proofs for theexistence of God and for creation; however he embellishes these kal ̄amproofs with Sufi ideals, particularly with respect to the absolute unity ofGod (tawÓh ̄ıd).20One might say that Ba Óhya lived at a time before the en-trenchment of radical Aristotelian philosophy, one in which philosophy168Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"and theology could serve as humble handmaidens to the life of faith.21In fact, Ba Óhya stresses the religious obligation to rationalize one’s belief,sharply denouncing taql ̄ıdas a shirking of the duty to discover the truthfor oneself.22Ha-Levi, in contrast, sees philosophical investigation ashaving reached arrogant proportions and holds up simple taql ̄ıdas anideal. He asserts through the voice of the King—perhaps ironically—that investigation is incumbent only on those who have unfortunatelyfallen into the pit of argument and dispute (V:1: 191).Ba Óhya describes people who rely on the knowledge of others intaql ̄ıdas a company of people who are blind, each following the blindperson in front of him. Only the prophet can see—a most unfortunatesituation for all except the prophet. Ba Óhya’s metaphor of vision here,however, is mental; “seeing” is not distinguished from intellectualknowledge. Ba Óhya holds that every person is required to prove for him-self the truths of faith; those who follow blindly are lacking intellectualvision. For Ha-Levi, in contrast, those who approach the Divine throughthe intellect are themselves, as it were, blind. The prophet alone cantruly see the divine realm; those who do not possess the prophetic fa-culty have no choice but to rely in taql ̄ıdupon those who do. All of Is-rael, however, have at least the potential for this prophetic vision, awak-ened at Mount Sinai. Ha-Levi thus softens the gap between prophets andother Jews by suggesting that through the life of mitsvot, Jews canachieve the degree of prophetic revelation (wa Óhy)—a degree which, asJews, they possess in potentia. Wa Óhydoes not require rationalizing thefaith, but rather observing the commandments.Ba Ó hya and Ha-Levi, then, immersed in some of the same currents ofthought, offer very different responses. Ba Óhya adopts both the form andvocabulary of Sufi manuals of piety; we do not find in Ba Óhya the trans-formation of Sufi terminology that we find in Ha-Levi. Ba Óhya’s state-ment that the soul yearns to connect (li-tattaÓsila) with the divine light,23for example, is a standard Neo-Platonic and Sufi motif. His views ontaql ̄ıdand the necessity of discovering truths for oneself are shared bySufis, philosophers, and kal ̄amtheologians.Ba Óhya is therefore fundamentally in harmony with the intellectualtrends of his day. While he seeks to bring out the pietistic, interior ele-ment in Judaism, he does not do so at the expense of other values held bythe intellectual elite. Ha-Levi’s adoption of Arabic, and specifically Sufiterminology is more subtle and subversive. What Ba Óhya and Ha-Levishare is a common vocabulary and a concern for the integrity of spirituallife. The religious sensibilities of the two thinkers are, however, funda-mentally quite different.Conclusions169"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"3. Ha-Levi’s Relationship to Islamic Predecessorsa. Al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ı, Avicenna, and Ibn B ̄ajjaHa-Levi’s use of contemporary Islamic thought is equally subtle and var-ied. Herbert Davidson, Shlomo Pines, and others observed that the doc-trine laid out by the philosopher in I:1 corresponds to the doctrine of theSpanish philosopher Ibn B ̄ajjah, while that in V:12 is a treatise copiedword for word from Avicenna. TheÓHaver’s description of the philo-sophical theory of prophecy in I:87 corresponds in broad strokes to thetheories of al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı, Avicenna, and Ibn B ̄ajja.Our study has placed Ha-Levi’s use of philosophical material in abroader context. Ha-Levi has not simply rejected philosophical views,but appropriated a vocabulary common to both Sufis and philosophersfor his own purposes. In I:87, for example, theÓHaverexplains that therevelation at Mount Sinai disproved the philosophical theory thatprophecy occurs through lesser degrees of inspiration such as ilh ̄ amandta™y ̄ıd. We now have a broader framework for understanding this state-ment. TheÓHavertells us, in fact, that the Sanhedrin themselves areguided in their judging by ilh ̄ amand ta™y ̄ıd; they also come upon theirscientific knowledge through these forms of inspiration. Ilh ̄amandta™y ̄ıdare rejected, however, as ways of describing the revelation atMount Sinai and the origin of the Torah. The Torah did not originate inthe mind of Moses; prophecy is not simply mental assistance that theprophet receives from the divine Active Intellect. While these forms ofinternal support do not explain the origin of the Torah, Ha-Levi doesnot completely reject their existence and validity.24Ilh ̄amand ta™y ̄ıdnotonly explain the assistance the Sanhedrin receives in deciding law—prophets, too, receive inspirations (ilh ̄ am ̄at), just as they perform won-ders and miracles through the aid of God.The event at Mount Sinai, in contrast, represents a higher degree ofinspiration altogether, which Ha-Levi terms “revelation” (wa Óhy). HereHa-Levi again follows Sa¡adya, who reserves the term wa Óhyfor revela-tion of the books of the Bible, insisting that every word of sacred Scrip-ture is divinely dictated. Sa¡adya appears to be polemicizing against Ka-raite opponents, who attribute the psalms and perhaps other prayersand poems to inspiration (ilh ̄ am) rather than word-for-word revelation(wa Óhy).Ha-Levi reflects the debate over wa Óhyand ilh ̄ am, but shifts oppo-nents. His concern is philosophers such as Al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı and Avicenna, whodescribe prophecy in naturalistic terms as inspiration, and thus blur the170Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"boundaries between ordinary thinking, inspiration (ilh ̄ am), and revela-tion (wa Óhy).25Ha-Levi is also concerned to combat philosophical skep-ticism, to preserve the divine origin of the Torah, and to uphold theuniqueness of the revelation at Mount Sinai. Ha-Levi’s relationship tothese philosophers is not, however, wholly negative. He does incorpo-rate a treatise of Avicennian thought in Part Five of the Kuzari. At times,he offers philosophical argument as a kind of fallback position. TheÓHavergoes to great lengths in IV:3 to justify the reality of prophetic vi-sions through a sound epistemology. Ha-Levi apparently views philoso-phy as a tool which, like kal ̄am, has great dangers and is often misused,but which is not without value in bolstering faith.b. al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ ıAs I noted in the Introduction, David Kaufmann emphasized the similar-ities between Ha-Levi and al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, giving some the impression thatHa-Levi had essentially translated the ideas of Ghazz ̄al ̄ı into a Jewishframework.26More recent scholars have sought to qualify this charac-terization, among them David Baneth in his insightful examination ofthe two thinkers. Let us explore what our study has revealed about therelationship between Ha-Levi and Ghazz ̄al ̄ı.Our research does affirm certain of Kaufmann’s assertions, includ-ing the possible literary relationship between the two thinkers—but withsome qualification. For example, Kaufmann traced to Ghazz ̄al ̄ı a meta-phor in Kuzari III:37, in which the King compares the Karaites—ad-mired for their diligent striving (ijtih ̄ad) in matters of religious law—towanderers in the wilderness, who must ever be prepared for battle. Incontrast, followers of the rabbis can rest, body and soul, upon theirhumble mats of taql ̄ıd.The passage in Ghazz ̄al ̄ı that Kaufmann cites is not an exact par-allel.27Ghazz ̄al ̄ı writes that kal ̄amtheologians are like guards hired toprotect pilgrims on the Óhajjagainst bands of marauders. If the brigandswould cease their oppression, he asserts, there would be no need forguards. Just so, theology is needed to protect the hearts of the faithfulmasses from the innovations of heretics. If the innovators would ceasespewing out their nonsense—the vehemence is Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s—there wouldbe no need for theology.The greatest error of the theologians, Ghazz ̄al ̄ı continues, is thatthey exaggerate the scope of their territory; they claim to have insightinto the nature of God, divine attributes, the afterlife, and other matterswhich belong to the science of revelation (¡ilm al-muk ̄ashafa) proper. LetConclusions171"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"the theologians rather confine themselves to the matter of dialectics, andnot mistakenly consider themselves among the learned (¡ulam ̄a™).28We can see that while there are points of contact between the twometaphors, there are also significant differences. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s metaphor isdirected against the theologians; he describes kal ̄amdialectics as mereweapons of protection to guard the hearts of the faithful, with no intrin-sic value. This, indeed, was a standard critique of kal ̄am—that it was aweapon of debate, of religious polemics, and could not be relied upon asvalid proof (burh ̄an).Ha-Levi’s metaphor in III:37, in contrast, is framed in the context oflaw, rather than theology. Because Karaites approach Biblical law withindividual qiy ̄as, they do not arrive at one common halakhahas do thosewho rely upon rabbinic tradition. The Karaites therefore must be everprepared to defend their legal reasoning against new arguments theymeet each day. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı portrays kal ̄amdialectic as a weapon againsttheological innovation; theÓHaverdescribes Karaite legal qiy ̄asas aweapon of protection to fend off shifting arguments in halakhah.We should remember, however, that while Ha-Levi’s argumentagainst the Karaites is here framed within a legal context, theÓHaveralsorefers to the Karaites explicitly in his attack on kal ̄amin V:1– 2 and inV:15– 16. Further, we have seen a clear rhetorical pattern with regard tothe term qiy ̄as; Ha-Levi uses the negative associations he establishes forqiy ̄asin one sphere to taint other spheres. We may therefore surmise thatHa-Levi intends his attack on Karaite legal qiy ̄asin III:37 to extend totheological qiy ̄asas well, for which the Karaites were also well known.Kaufmann’s enthusiastic assertion of direct literary borrowing musttherefore be qualified somewhat. The common metaphor to which Kauf-mann pointed has shifted from the sphere of theology to that of law, andwe find no direct linguistic links between the two passages. Ha-Levi andGhazz ̄al ̄ı do, however, show a very similar attitude toward dialecticalargument, particularly if we take Ha-Levi’s critique of Karaite qiy ̄asinBook Three together with his attacks on kal ̄amin Book Five.And indeed, we find a terminological connection between BooksThree and Five which strengthens Kaufmann’s case. Ha-Levi’s critiqueof qiy ̄as in Book Three is linked to his attack onkal ̄amin Book Fivethrough the concept of taql ̄ıd. Kal ̄amtheologians argue that peace ofmind (suk ̄un al-nafs) can be found only by proving the truths of faith foroneself, not by relying in taql ̄ıdon the arguments of others. In III:37– 38Ha-Levi inverts this argument. To the contrary, it is those who rely upontheir own qiy ̄aswho can never find rest, for they must ever be preparedto battle those who challenge their views. Reliance (taql ̄ıd) on the rabbis172Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"brings true rest to the soul. In fact, if the Karaites are ever found agree-ing with one another, it is only because they, too, have resorted to taql ̄ıdon one of their founders. They might just as well rely on those who arein fact reliable, the rabbis.TheÓHaverargues similarly in V:14 and in IV:23 that philosophersonly agree with one another if they follow the taql ̄ıdof the same philo-sophical school. The masses, however, prefer taql ̄ıdon the rabbis totaql ̄ıdon the philosophers; they are not fooled by the superficial ele-gance of the philosophers’ proofs. Here, too, he uses the concept ofpeace of mind (suk ̄un al-nafs); the masses find peace of mind with theSages, not with the philosophers, as intellectuals may have led them toexpect (IV:17: 169).29The tie between taql ̄ıdand kal ̄amin Book Five links this attack tothe earlier passages. The King asserts in V:1 that taql ̄ıdis only appropri-ate for one with pleasantness of soul (Ót ̄ı b a l-nafs); for someone who hasalready fallen into doubts, conjectures, and philosophical debates, inves-tigation is necessary. We recall that theÓHaverresponds with pathos:But who among us has a calm soul, which is not deceived by these passingviews—the views of natural scientists, astrologers, makers of talismans,magicians, materialists, philosophers and others. One does not [today] ar-rive at faith except after one has passed through many stages of heresy[zandaqa]. Life is short and the labor long. Only unique individuals havefaith by nature, and these opinions are all repugnant to them; their soulsimmediately note the point of their offensiveness. And I hope that you maybe among those singular ones. [However] if it be thus, and I cannot avoid[acceeding to your request], I will not travel the way of the Karaites whoascended to metaphysics without levels. (V: 2: 191)Ha-Levi’s tone with respect to kal ̄amis more biting in V:16. TheÓHaverasserts that kal ̄amhas little value; the practitioner of kal ̄amonlyfools his listeners into thinking he is superior to the simple, pious be-liever. The tragic irony is that the theologian, like the Karaite, preten-tiously extends his intellect in vain search of that which the Jew pos-sesses by tradition. TheÓHavereven suggests that the Jew is endowed bynature with a gift for spirituality. Like the natural poet, the Jew needsonly hints to awaken a latent understanding (V:16: 213).In both Book Five and Book Three, then, Ha-Levi contrasts thesuperficial attraction of legal and theological ijtih ̄adwith the simplicityof taql ̄ıd. In III:37, theÓHaverargues that people are fooled by thegreater striving (ijtih ̄ad) of the Karaites and mistake the calm of the rab-bis for laziness. In V:16, he argues likewise that people are fooled by theConclusions173"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"theologian’s “luster of knowledge” and mistakenly think the theologiansuperior to the simple believer. The thread between Ha-Levi’s attacks onlegal and theological qiy ̄as thus strengthens the parallel to Ghazz ̄al ̄ı. Ha-Levi may well have been aware of Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s metaphor of qiy ̄asas aweapon of battle in the sphere of kal ̄am, and applied it to the field of lawas well.Ha-Levi’s attack on philosophy in V:14 is also quite reminiscent ofGhazz ̄al ̄ı. Like Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, theÓHaverasserts that many had been fooledby the philosophers. Since philosophers achieved certainty in mathemat-ics and logic, people thought their statements in metaphysics had thestatus of apodictic proof (burh ̄an) as well (V:14: 208 – 9).30We find an equally strong literary link in another sphere. As Kauf-mann pointed out, both Ha-Levi and Ghazz ̄al ̄ı make use of the Sufiimage of the “inner eye.”31In his spiritual autobiography Al-munqidhmin al- Ódal ̄al, Ghazz ̄al ̄ı describes a stage after the intellect in which an-other eye is opened, which sees both the hidden and the future. He com-pares those who are skeptical about this power of vision and the realitiesit sees to a person born blind who has no understanding of color. Simi-larly, a person who had never experienced the dream state would doubtthe fantastic visions people claim to have had there. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı writes:Just as the intellect is one human stage in which a person receives an eye bywhich he sees various species of intelligibles from which the senses are farremoved, the prophetic power [al-nubuwwa] is an expression signifying astage in which man receives an eye possessed of a light, and in its light theunknown and other phenomena not normally perceived [yudraku] by theintellect become visible.Doubt about prophecy touches either its possibility, its existence, orits belonging to a specific individual. The proof [dal ̄ıl] of its possibility isits existence [wuj ̄ud]. And the proof [dal ̄ıl] of its existence is the existencein the world of knowledge which could not conceivably be obtained bythe intellect alone, such as the knowledge of medicine and of astronomy.For whoever examines such knowledge knows of necessity that it can beobtained only by a Divine inspiration [ilh ̄am] and special help [tawf ̄ıq]from God Most High, and that there is no empirical way to it. . . . Theproperties of prophecy beyond those just mentioned can be perceivedonly by taste [dhawq] as a result of following the way of Sufism [sul ̄uktar ̄ıq al-taÓsawwuf].32Almost every statement in this passage finds a parallel in Ha-Levi. LikeGhazz ̄al ̄ı, theÓHaverin IV:3 describes the gift of prophecy as an inner eyethat sees what the intellect cannot perceive. The prophet regards others174Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"who do not possess this eye as blind people whom he or she must guide(IV:3: 155). Ha-Levi is adamant, moreover, that prophetic vision is self-validating. Greek philosophers rejected prophecy only because qiy ̄asre-jects whatever it has not seen. The prophets, however, could not denywhat they witnessed with the inner eye (IV:3: 157).Ghazz ̄al ̄ı asserts similarly that the proof of prophecy is simply its ex-istence. While prophecy is self-validating, however, its existence isproved by the existence of knowledge that could not be attained exceptthrough divine inspiration. Ha-Levi likewise argues that prophecybrings scientific and metaphysical knowledge that human qiy ̄ason itsown could not obtain.33Like Ha-Levi, Ghazz ̄al ̄ı argues that the proper-ties of prophecy can only be known by taste (dhawq); Ha-Levi, too,characterizes the unique prophetic way of knowing God as dhawq(IV:16 – 17: 168 – 69).Consider, moreover, the following formulation, in Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’sMishk ̄at al-anw ̄ar(The Niche for Lights):Why should it be impossible that beyond reason there should be a furtherplane on which there appear things which do not appear on the plane of in-telligence, just as it is possible for the intelligence itself to be a plane abovethe discriminating faculty and the senses, and for revelations of wondersand marvels to be made to it beyond the reach of senses and the discrimi-nating faculty? Beware of making the ultimate perfection stop at yourself!Consider the intuitive sense [dhawq] for poetry, if you would have an ex-ample of everyday experience taken from those special gifts which particu-larize some people.34Here Ghazz ̄al ̄ı compares the additional source of knowledge to theintuitive sense (dhawq: literally “taste”) for poetry, just as theÓHaverinV:16 compares pure faith to a poetic gift.35TheÓHaverpoints out that incontrast to those who quantify meter through the study of prosody, nat-ural poets sense (yadh ̄uqu: literally “taste”) the correct meter. Similarly,the person of innate faith senses the Divine, while the theologian—whoarrogantly constructs proofs for the existence of God—is in fact as awk-ward in religion as is the student of prosody in poetry (V:16: 213). Andjust as theÓHaverpokes fun at the uninspired pedantry of those inept atpoetry, so Ghazz ̄al ̄ı writes of someone lacking dhawq: “Even were allthe masters of music in the world to call a conference with a view ofmaking him understand the meaning of this musical sense [dhawq], theywould be quite powerless to do so.”36Ha-Levi and Ghazz ̄al ̄ı thus agree that prophets possess an intuitivegift for seeing or sensing the Divine which ordinary human beings doConclusions175"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"not. Is such a talent innate or can it it developed? Ghazz ̄al ̄ı suggests thatthe inner eye may be developed by traveling the path of Sufism.37Indeed,anyone who has not traveled the path and had an experience of dhawqknows nothing of prophecy except the name.38Ha-Levi, too, indicatesthat the capacity for prophecy may be developed, through practice of thecommandments (V:20: 223; 1:103: 35). The nation of Israel is naturallyendowed with a potential for prophecy that must be realized; like the nat-ural poet, they need only hints to bring out the hidden sparks of faith.It is true that we do not find in Ha-Levi the openly enthusiastic em-brace of Sufism we find in Ghazz ̄al ̄ı. Nevertheless, the two thinkers sharea religious sensibility in many ways. Both are serious and respectful stu-dents of Aristotelian philosophy, who criticize it using similar argu-ments. Both reject kal ̄am,and do so for similar reasons. For both Ha-Levi and Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, reason has its place, but must be superseded by directtasting of the Divine (dhawq).Both use the metaphor of the inner eye tomake prophetic experience comprehensible in scientific terms. Influencedby similar intellectual and spiritual currents—Sufism, neo-Platonism, andan incipient revolt against rationalism—Ha-Levi and Ghazz ̄al ̄ı weavethese elements together in a strikingly similar fashion.A final parallel that should be mentioned is the two thinkers™ atti-tudes towards the commandments of their respective religions. Bothwere apparently concerned about the potential for anti-nomianism inpursuit of the mystical or ascetic life. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı—like Qushayri, anothermoderate Sufi-inclined thinker—was disturbed by anti-nomian trendswithin Sufism, and insisted on the necessity of the commandments indrawing near to God.39This concern finds a close parallel in Ha-Levi, asnoted by Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, who quotes Ha-Levi to elucidate Ghazz ̄al ̄ı:“It is therefore impossible to overestimate the tremendous importance ofthe commandments [for Ghazz ̄al ̄ı] since, in the words of Judah Halevi,man does not attain to al™Amr al-™Il ̄ahiexcept by divine command; thatis, by deeds that God has commanded.”404. Concluding RemarksMy aim in this study has been to understand Ha-Levi’s thought morefully by situating his language and arguments in their Islamic context.Ha-Levi shows a complex, dialectical relationship to the spiritual andintellectual streams of his day: Sufism, philosophy, Karaism, kal ̄am. Hehas woven together diverse strands of medieval Islamic culture in aunique and unprecedented way. This study has shown that Ha-Levi’s re-lationship to Islamic thought is indeed multi-dimensional.176Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"This multi-dimensional fabric includes doctrines that challenge thereader; Ha-Levi never shies away from the provocative elements of histheories. To comprehend his thought fully, we must hold the conflictingelements of his views in tension, not diminishing the importance or func-tion of any aspect of the debate. Perhaps this is the ultimate reason Ha-Levi chose the medium of dialogue: not to hide his true views, but to re-veal the complexity of truth.41Our literary-philological analysis has revealed that the Kuzari is awork of philosophical poetry, in which Ha-Levi expands and re-shapeslanguage to express his spiritual vision. Deeply indebted to the experien-tial language of Sufism, he depicts a Judaism of rich individual and com-munal religious experience. His spiritual stance is at once militantly Jew-ish and intensely personal. He cannot be easily placed in a conceptualbox; Ha-Levi is neither a Jewish Sufi, an Aristotelian philosopher, a mu-takallim,nor a dogmatic anti-rationalist. Ha-Levi’s transformation ofSufi vocabulary reveals a unique dimension to the artistry and spiritualtexture of the Kuzari.Through it, he points to the religious experience hesenses at the heart of Judaism.Conclusions177"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"AbbreviationsAll references to the Kuzariare from Kit ̄ab al-radd wa¡l-dal ̄ıl f ̄ı¡l-d ̄ın al-dhal ̄ıl (al-kit ̄ab al-khazar ̄ı), edited by David H.

The Cairo Genizah was a storehouse of letters and manuscripts found inthe attic of the Ezra Synagogue; the Genizah was re-discovered mainly by SolomonSchecter in 1896 and researched by many scholars, including S. D. Goitein. Its vastmaterials range from Second Temple texts to signed documents such as the letters ofHa-Levi. On the genesis of the Kuzari, see Goitein, “Autographs of Yehuda Hal-levi,” Tarbiz25 (1955– 56): 393 – 412; idem, “The Biography of Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi in Light of the Cairo Genizah Documents,” PAAJR28 (1959): 41– 56; D.

Langermann, “Sci-ence and the Kazari,” Science in Context 10,3 (1997), 501. Langermann questionswhether the “heretic” mentioned by Ha-Levi was necessarily a Karaite.3. The term rabbinic Judaismrefers to the religion of the rabbis or Sages(ÓHakhamim) whose teachings are recorded in the Mishnah and Talmud in the firstfive centuries of the Common Era. The Karaites challenged the central claim of rab-binic Judaism—the claim that rabbinic law possesses divine authority. In rejectingrabbinic oral tradition, the Karaites claimed to be pure Biblicists; their Hebrewname, Qara™im, means “readers,” i.e., readers of Scripture. Like all “fundamental-ists,” however, the Karaites developed their own authoritative tradition of Scriptu-ral interpretation, which they held up as a counterclaim to rabbinic tradition.

In the letter of Ha-Levi to his friendÓHalfon b. Netanel in which Ha-Levi suggests that the book began in response toquestions from a Karaite scholar, he refers to the work as The Book of the KuzariorThe Kuzari Book(Ha-sefer ha-kuzari).Goitein and Baneth both believe that this is areference to a first edition of the work that was mainly concerned with Karaism,some form of which we find now in Book Three.

Ha-Levi uses the term ‘amal, which signifies action in the broadest sense.While the King is very diligent in the worship (ta¡abbud) and practices (a¡m ̄al) of theKhazar religion, his behavior (‘amal) as a whole is not pleasing to God.8. I have rendered the Arabic term al-ÓHabarin its familiar Hebrew transla-tion: ha-ÓHaver. ÓHabaris an Arabic term for a non-Muslim cleric or a rabbinicscholar;ÓHaveris a Mishnaic Hebrew term for a Jewish scholar. I have chosen thefamiliar Hebrew termÓHaverto capture what I believe to be Ha-Levi’s intent—toconnote a rabbinic scholar and teacher, an authoritative spokesperson for rabbinicJudaism.9.

Ha-Levi was an inspiration for such diverse circles as thirteenth-centuryKabbalists, fourteenth- and fifteenth-century antirationalists, and eighteenth-century ÓHasidim. The standard traditional edition of the Kuzariincludes commen-taries of the Italian Renaissance thinker Yehuda Moscato (Qol Yehudah) and theeighteenth-century Haskalah figure Israel of Zamosc (Otsar NeÓhmad).In the nine-teenth and twentieth centuries, Samuel David Luzzato, Franz Rosenzweig, andAbraham Isaac Kook were all indebted to Ha-Levi.

In 111:17, theÓHaverexamines the firstthree blessings of the silent prayer (‘Amidah) and asserts that the third blessing whichdescribes the holiness of God points to the philosophers’ “negative” description ofGod: the philosophers assert God’s utter transcendence of all physical attributes.This blessing, however, is necessarily preceded by the blessings describing God’s in-volvement in the lives of the Biblical ancestors and God’s mighty deeds, which to-gether show that God is in fact connected with the affairs of this world, governingand guiding as Lord and Sovereign:And after the affirmation of the blessings “ancestors” (Avot) and “mightydeeds” (gevurot) which suggest that He is connected (yata¡allaqa) with thismaterial world (the worshipper) declares him too high (yunazzihuhu) andholy (yuqaddisuhu) and exalted (yurafi¡uhu) for it to be fitting to connecthim (yata ‘allaquhu) with any material attributes, in the blessing “The Holi-ness of God,” (which reads) “You are Holy.”And in this blessing he conceives (yataÓsawwara) (him) as the philoso-phers describe him, as free from anthropomorphism (tanz ̄ıh) and holy(taqd ̄ıs), after declaring his Lordship (rub ̄ubiyyatihi) and sovereignty (mul-kihi) in the blessings “Ancestors” and “Mighty Deeds,” by which we affirmthat we have a king and legislator. (III:17:106)TheÓHavermakes clear, Silman argues, that the third blessing is not meant to ne-gate the first two. The two aspects of God—transcendence and immanence—appeartogether in the same prayer. Silman argues that in his early thought Ha-Levi sawthese two ways of knowing and describing God as complementary; it is only laterthat he conceives of them as mutually exclusive. (Silman, Filosof, 112– 14, 162– 63;English, 120 – 23, 183 – 86).Notes to pages 9–12185"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"However, if we look at IV:3—which Silman ascribes to the later period in Ha-Levi’s thought—we see that theÓHaverdecribes the paradox of transcendence andimmanence in almost identical language. Here theÓHaverexplains the divine name“Holy One:”Holy [Qadosh] is an expression for that which is free from all anthropo-morphism [tanz ̄ıh] and too exalted [tarf ̄ı¡] for any attribute of createdthings to be appropriate, even if he is called that only metaphorically.And thus Isaiah heard, “Holy, holy, holy,” without end, meaning thatGod is too high [munazzah], too exalted [muraffa¡a] too holy [muqaddasa]and too pure [mubarra™a] for any impurity of the people in whose midst hislight dwells [Óhalla] to touch him. “Holy” is a term for the spiritual, whichis never corporealized and to which no corporeal thing can cling [or: whichno corporeal thing can resemble].However God is called “Holy One of Israel” as an expression for the™amr ¡il ̄ah ̄ıwhich is connected to him [Israel] [al-muttaÓsil bi-hi] and then toall his descendents, a connection of governance and guidance, not a connec-tion of clinging and touching. And [thus] not everyone who wants to haspermission to say, “My God” and “My Holy One,” except metaphorically,by way of imitation [taql ̄ıd]. In truth, only a prophet or a wal ̄ıycan saythat, one to whom the™amr‘il ̄ ah ̄ı is connected [yattaÓsilu bi-hi]. (IV:3:151)We see once again the two poles Silman points to in 111:17: God is transcen-dent and free of all attributes (tanz ̄ıh) as the philosophers assert, but God is also con-nected to the affairs of human beings in the material world. TheÓHaverexpresses thisparadox by juxtaposing the name “Holy One,” which suggests the absolutetranscendence of God, with the name “Holy One of Israel,” which asserts that Godis nevertheless connected (muttaÓsil) with Israel (Jacob) and all his descendents—notphysically, but through providential guidance.Silman asserts that in his late thought, Ha-Levi conceives of God as radicallytranscendent and unknowable, whereas in his early thought, he conceives of God asessentially intellect and thus knowable. However, we have seen that 111:17 and IV:3describe the paradox of God’s transcendence and immanence almost identically.33. Ibid., 174; English, 199.34.

On thecontrary, she becomes more distinct and purer and clearer, because she and the intel-lect are then one thing and two, like two species. If the soul is in this state, she doesnot admit change in any way at all, but is unchanging in her world, for she knowsherself and knows that she knows herself, with a single knowledge, with no divisionbetween them.

We should note Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s extensive use of Sufi terminology here; in addi-tion to the root w-Ós-l, Ghazz ̄al ̄ı alludes to the Sufi notions of taste (dhawq), mysticalstate (Óh ̄al), annihilation (fan ̄a’) and permanent abiding (baq ̄a’).

A strong Neo-Platonicand Sufi sensibility emerge as well, as he brings forth the paradox of God’s uttertranscendence and yet absolute nearness. Ba Óhya in fact quotes an anonymous versethat will reappear in the poetry of Ha-Levi: “My God, where can I find You, orrather where can I not find You?

In this passage, theÓHaverdepicts a Sufi-like meditation on the participation of God in the pious person’severy action. The Sufi resonance of this motif—the notion that God acts through thelimbs of the fully perfected human being—can be heard in the language of Ghazz ̄al ̄ı:“All movements [Óharak ̄at] and all restings [sakan ̄at] [of the Sufis], whether externalor internal, are illuminated from the light of the lamp of prophecy [nubuwwa];andbeyond the light of prophecy, there is no other light on the face of the earth whichmay be the source of illumination.” Munqidh, 132; McCarthy, 94; Watt, 60.The Sufis based themselves on the following Óhad ̄ıth quds ̄ı(a tradition in whichGod speaks): “My servant ceases not to draw nigh unto Me by works of devotion,until I love him, and when I love him I am the eye by which he sees and the ear bywhich he hears. When he approaches a span I approach a cubit, and when he comeswalking I come running.” Ab ̄u Na Ósr al-Sarr ̄aj, Kit ̄ab al-luma¡, ed. Nicholson (Lei-den, 1914), 59; cited by Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions, 133.A similar motif occurs in III:51 of Guide of the Perplexed, in which Maimonidesdepicts Moses and the patriarchs as acting with their limbs only, while their intellectsare engaged in the contemplation of God. Barry Kogan and David Shatz note thesimilarity to this passage in Kuzari1:1. See Shatz, “Worship, Corporeality, andHuman Perfection: A Reading of Guide of the PerplexedIII:51– 54,” in TheThought of Moses Maimonides: Philosophical and Legal Studies, ed. I.

It may also be that the philoso-phers were forced to define and explain prophecy through the Active Intellect in re-sponse to Sufi claims that it was the Sufi path alone that led to, and could fully com-prehend, prophecy. The Islamic philosophers sought to describe a theory ofknowledge that would encompass philosophy, prophecy, and religious experience.See Fazlur Rahman, Prophecy in Islam: Philosophy and Orthodoxy(London, 1958).On Ha-Levi’s use of the term dhawq, see Efros, “Mysticism,” 147– 48 and nn.23 – 24.24.maÓtl ̄ub25. Or: knowledge of the hidden (¡ilm ghayb).26. Ha-Levi turns the philosopher’s ironic tone against the philosopher byusing the term maÓtl ̄ub—by which Sufis referred to the divine beloved—to refer to amuch more modest object of union, the Active Intellect of the philosophers. On theKing’s dream, see Robert Eisen, “The Problem of the King’s Dream and Non-JewishProphecy in Judah Halevi’s Kuzari,” Jewish Thought and Philosophy, vol. 3, 231– 47.27. The King also protests that he would expect tales of miracles and won-ders (mu¡jiz ̄at wa-karam ̄at) among the philosophers. These, too, are included in phil-osophical accounts of prophecy.

The term Óhul ̄ulhas a technical sense of “incarnation”: the com-plete indwelling of God in a human being. It is the Islamic Arabic term for the Chris-tian incarnation. Ha-Levi here uses the term Óhul ̄ulin a general, nontechnical sense ofindwelling. He then does go on to use it in the sense of incarnation when he speaksof the Messiah. As a term for incarnation, Óhul ̄ulwas also a heresy leveled againstSufis and others. See Carl W. Ernst, Words of Ecstasy in Sufism(Albany, 1981), 118 –23; Lois Anita Giffen, Theory of Profane Love among the Arabs: The Developmentof the Genre(New York, 1971).

Here both shades of the verb Óhallaare interwoven—a nontech-nical sense of alighting, resting, or dwelling, and the technical Arabic sense of incar-nation. The Christian has thus contextualized this Óhul ̄ulin the larger history of God’sconnection with the Jewish people; there are precedents for this “indwelling” of God.Ha-Levi uses this term repeatedly to describe God’s presence among the Jewish peo-ple. There is also one other passage in which Óhallacomes a bit closer to the Christiansense of incarnation. TheÓHaverexplains that prophecy ceased with the destructionof the First Temple, except for rare individuals: “[Newly] acquired prophecy ceasedwith the departure of the Shekhinah, and only came at extraordinary times or on ac-count of a great force, such as that of Abraham, Moses, the expected Messiah, Elijahand their equals. For they in themselves were a dwelling place [maÓhall] for the Shek-hinah, and their very presence helped those present to acquire the degree of proph-ecy” (III:65: 137). On the verb Óhalla and this passage in Ha-Levi, see my forthcomingarticle “A Dwelling Place for the Shekhinah,” JQR90 (1–2), July–Oct. 1999.37.Pines points out, however, that while later philosophers speak of individuals’quests to unite their human intellect with the divine Active Intellect, early philoso-phers such as Ibn S ̄ın ̄ a described this process in the reverse: the Active Intellect con-joins with (yattaÓsilu bi) the human intellect.

For example, Pines cites a passage in the treatise Kit ̄ab al-radd ¡ala’l-raw ̄afiÓd aÓsÓh ̄ab al-ghuluww(attributed to al-Q ̄asim b. Ibr ̄ah ̄ım, a Zaydi theologian) inwhich we find Ósafwadenoting “choice” or “election,” and the divine ™amrbestowingthis choice. Ha-Levi uses the term Ós a f w astrictly to refer to those who are selected,and never to the fact of selection, as in this text. Ibid., 167– 70.41. For example, in the Ris ̄ala al-J ̄am¡ia(part 2, fourth risala,p. 147), we findittiÓs ̄alin an elaborate Neo-Platonic framework like that described in the Letters ofthe Brethren of Purity (Ikhw ̄an al- Ósaf ̄a’). Here we see the divine ™a m rcoming downthrough a series of emanations to the prophets. Ibid., 176.42. This is of course also true for incarnation, referred to by the Christian in I:4.43. Note, for example, Ha-Levi’s playful use of the term ™a m rin I:109: “youwill see that an ™amrhigher than the natural ™amrguides your ™amr” (I:109: 36).Ha-Levi’s literary sensitivity to the term ™amr comes to the fore in I:97– 98 aswell. TheÓHaverargues that the sin of the golden calf consisted not in building animage per se, but in attributting an ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıto something chosen and created them-selves, without a command of God (™amr allah) (I:97: 31). This, says the King, con-firms the angel’s message in his dream: one can only reach the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı through acommand of God, an ™amr il ̄ah ̄ı(I:98: 32).44. As Barry Kogan expressed it, the ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ıis “Halevi’s multivalent termfor diverse aspects of divine immanence.” Kogan, “Judah Halevi,” in History of Is-lamic Philosophy, ed. M. Fakhry 721.

Goldziher, “Le ™Amril ̄ ah ̄ı,” 32– 41; Efros, “Mysticism,” 145– 46; Wolfson, “Prophecy,” 68 – 85; David-son, “Cuzari,” REJ,381– 95; Howard Kreisel, Theories of Prophecy in MedievalJewish Philosophy(Ann Arbor, 1981), 93 – 114; Silman, Filosof,115– 19, 172– 77;(English) 124 – 29, 196 – 203.45. See now Touati, who made the same choice, for similar reasons. He trans-lates ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıas le divin. Touati, Le Kuzari, xiii.46. There is a passionate, ecstatic strain to Ha-Levi’s thought which figuresprominently in IV:15– 17 of the Kuzariand finds eloquent expression in his poetry.The relationship of these two strands in Ha-Levi’s poetry—the individual quest forunion with the Divine, and the historical, God-initiated relationship with the nationof Israel—are a subject for further research.47.Al- ¡ ̄arif.48.d ̄una ta‘al ̄ım, bal bi-ahw ̄an fikra. We see traces in Ha-Levi of the medievalphilosophical debate over SufiittiÓs ̄al, and particularly over Sufi claims to achieve ac-cess to universal knowledge without a long process of philosophical study. Ibn B ̄ajjarefers explicitly to the Sufi claim that “the attainment of ultimate happiness maycome about without learning (bi-l ̄a ta‘allum), but through devotion and constant re-membrance of God (dhikr).” He criticizes the Sufis on this point; insofar as they seekto bypass the intellect, they have settled for an illusory goal.Avicenna, like the Sufis, believes it possible to receive all potential knowledge in192Notes to pages 29–30"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"the immediate experience of ittiÓs ̄al; although for the Sufis ittiÓs ̄alis union with God,while for Avicenna ittiÓs ̄alrepresents conjunction with the Active Intellect.

Hujw ̄ır ̄ı, an eleventh-century Persian Sufi thinker, writes similarly:“God causes man to know him with a knowledge that is not linked to any faculty.”See ÓHayy ben Yaqdh ̄an: Roman philosophique d’Ibn Thofail, ed.

Elsewhere theÓHaverspeaks of striving for prophecy and achieving it ornearly achieving it (I:103: 35). Ha-Levi in several passages hints at a process of de-veloping one’s spiritual gifts through the mitsvot(e.g., V:20, Fourth Principle: 223),but is inconsistent about levels of development. At times prophecy is spoken of asthe peak of religious experience, whereas elsewhere he speaks of praying for ittiÓs ̄alatthe degree of prophecy (III:20: 109 – 10), suggesting that ittiÓs ̄alitself is the ultimategoal of religious life.63. There is abundant aggadic literature filling in the biography of Abraham.Abraham is praised for being the first to recognize God, whether as a child or as anadult. Rabbinic literature tells the well-known story of the patriarch’s iconoclasm: hesmashed his father’s idols and risked his life in the fiery furnace of Nimrod. Abrahamunderwent ten trials of faith, among which is circumcision; he is tried because of hisrighteousness, and his triumph preserves the entire world.

Baneth, for example, remarks that Ha-Levi’s doctrine of a special relig-ious faculty possessed by the Jewish people bears an unmistakable resemblance tomodern racial theories.

Salo Baron, “Yehudah Halevi: An Answer to an HistoricChallenge,” Jewish Social Studies, 271. Both scholars, however, go on to qualifytheir assertions somewhat.73. This shift was anticipated in the Christian’s speech in Ha-Levi’s openingdialogue (1:4) The Christian’s words—which link providential ittiÓs ̄alto God’s spe-cial relationship with Israel—find expression in III:11: 100 as well.74.

Ha-Levi alludes to this midrash in 1:95: 27,where theÓHaverasserts that the ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ırested upon the entire nation, and evenrested upon the women, some of whom became prophetesses.

The English translations of Heinemann and Hirschfeldrender the second sentence: “If the law were binding on us (only) because God createdus, the white and the black would be equal(lastaw ̄a) since He created them all.”These translations obscure an important point in the passage; they omit thecrucial Arabic particle f ̄ı-hi(in it): “the red and the black would indeed shareequally in it [lastaw ̄a f ̄ı-hi],” i.e. in the law. This phrase sheds light on theÓHaver’searlier statement that “whoever from among the nations joins us, in particular,shares in our good, although they are not quite the same as (or equal to) us [lam yas-tawi ma‘n ̄a].” He clearly means that they do not share equally in the law—a logicalanswer to the question of whether the law is incumbent only on Jews (1:26: 12).79. The adverb kh ̄ aÓsÓsatan, then, can refer both to the action of joining andthe group joined. Whoever takes the specific step to join this nation in particular willshare in its good fortune. Responding to the historic claim that Islam and Christian-ity are superior because they offer a revelation which is universal, Ha-Levi holds upthe Jewish revelation as historically particular—a law to which one is tied by a par-ticular history, or which one must take deliberate steps to join.80. Menachem Kellner writes, “Fairness to Halevi demands that we take noteof the special circumstances surrounding the adoption of his position, and that wenot accuse him of nor blame him for twentieth-century racism. Halevi flourished ina place and time in which conflicting national and religious groupings each ad-vanced its own claims to nobility and belittled the character of its opponents. Chris-tian Spaniards affirmed their superiority over Jews and Muslims; Muslims affirmedtheir superiority over Jews and Christians; Muslim Arabs affirmed their superiorityover non-Arab Muslims; Halevi affirmed the superiority of the Jews over the Span-iards, Arabs, and North Africans.” Menachem Kellner, Maimonides on Judaism andthe Jewish People(Albany, 1991), 110 n.16.81. Pines suggests that this character is a composite of two figures; it is notclear whether he is Iraqi or Iranian. See Pines, 189 – 90, n.168b.82. It is true that in the context of the debate, this passage is itself a parody.However, the fact that these ideas were being parodied indicates that they were wellknown in that cultural milieu.On Ha-Levi’s adaptation of climatological theory, and its use in ¡Arab ̄ıyya/Shu¡ ̄ubiyya polemics, see Alexander Altmann, “The Climatological Factor in YehudaHa-Levi’s Theory of Prophecy (Hebrew),” Melilah1 (1944) : 1– 17; Nehemia Aloni,“The Kuzari: an Anti-Arabiyyah Polemic (Hebrew),” Eshel Be‘er Sheva‘, 2: 119 – 44.On Shu¡ ̄ubiyya ideology, see The Shu¡ ̄ubiyyaa in Al-Andalus: the Ris ̄ala of Ibn Gar-cia and Five Refutations, tr.

The virtue of pure-heartedness is described most often with the fourthform of the root kh-l-s; ikhl ̄asis dedication to the exclusive worship of God, and theparticiple muklhis, describing one who devotes himself to God, appears frequentlyin the Qur™ ̄an.

Idel suggests that while the masses were called upon to participatein clinging to God only indirectly, the elite were enjoined to a more direct clinging,ranging from adhering to God’s ways in imitatio deito “a real contact between twoentities, more than mere attachment of the devotee to God.”The amoraRav interprets the above verse in Deuteronomy as suggesting “twopalm dates that cling to one another” (ke-shtei temarot ha-devuqot zu be-zu) (Sanhe-drin 64a); another image used is the contact of a bracelet with a woman’s arm.

In his critique of the Sh ̄ı¡ite notionof the infallible Im ̄am upon whom one must rely, Ghazz ̄al ̄ı writes: “For instance, ifa man is in doubt about the qiblah[the direction in which Mecca lies, in which aMuslim must face in saying his prayers], the only course open to him is to pray ac-cording to his independent judgment [ijtih ̄ad].

Either the rabbis possess a specific tradition (naql) on the exege-sis of the verse and they are simply using the method of asmakhta, or they possess bytradition (naqlan) methodological secrets for interpreting verses using the thirteenhermeneutical principles. From Ha-Levi’s language it is possible, but less likely, thatthe methodological secrets the rabbis possess are other than an application of thethirteen principles (III:73: 143).31.

Ha-Levi here echoes a Karaite critique of Sa¡adya’s. In his rhymed workEsa Meshali, Sa¡adya argues that because they rely upon their own exegesis ofScripture, Karaites have no certainty or stability in their system of law. “Verilythey give their lives for one of the laws; if only they had lived, it would, in time,have changed.” Sa¡adya extends this critique to normative rabbinic halakhah: ifmidrash halakhahgenuinely created law, rabbinic law could fall victim to the an-archy that plagues the Karaites. Hence Sa¡adya insists that rabbinic midrashispure asmakhta, that the rabbis are faithful transmitters of tradition, rather thancreators of legislation. See Sa¡adya, Esa meshali: sefer milÓhemet ha-rishon negedha-Qara’im, ed. B. Lewin (Jerusalem, 1942), 32, lines 9 – 10; Harris, How Do WeKnow This? 178.37. R. J.

David Kaufmann traced this motif to a passage in Ghazz ̄al ̄ı.Ghazz ̄al ̄ı writes that theology (kal ̄am) is necessary to defend the faith against heret-ical attacks, just as pilgrims to Mecca need bodyguards to protect themselves againstrobbers. If the marauding robbers would give up their attacks, the pilgrims would nolonger need escorts; just so, if heretics would give up their disputes, the science ofkal ̄amwould be unnecessary. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı goes on to say that kal ̄amdoes not knowanything about the truths of God and metaphysics in themselves. Kaufmann citesthis motif as proof that Ha-Levi read Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s IÓhy ̄ a™ ¡ul ̄um al-d ̄ın. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, IÓhy ̄ a™¡ul ̄um al-d ̄ın(Bulaq, 1872– 73), I:22; The Book of Knowledge, tr. N. A.

This is the view of al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, as we have noted above, 201, n.5.

Ba Óhyacompares the person who relies upon tradition to a person who is blind, led bysomeone who can see. He then uses the image of a company of blind people, all ledby one person who can see, to describe a person who learns from others who them-selves only learned by taql ̄ıd. If the leader should fail to watch over those in his orher charge, or should any among the company stumble or fall, the company as awhole would fall down. Ba Óhya’s intent, therefore, is to show the danger of taql ̄ıd: ifone does not come to an understanding for oneself, one can easily stumble or be ledastray by counter-arguments from heretics. Note that his sense of “seeing” for one-self in this parable is intellectual rather than experiential.Sufis also denounced taql ̄ıd, as did certain orthodox thinkers.

It is true that in contrast to characteristic medieval philosophers such asSa¡adya or Maimonides, Ha-Levi does not believe it necessary to show the correspon-dence between faith and reason, between the principles of Judaism and scientificmetaphysics. Nevertheless, theÓHaverdeclares in no uncertain terms that the Torahand reason are in accord. The difference between Ha-Levi and Maimonides is that forMaimonides there is a religious obligation to prove for oneself the accord betweenfaith and reason, an obligation Ha-Levi’sÓHaverdenies (V:1: 191; V:16: 213).As Davidson and Wolfson have shown, the typical medieval philosopher consid-ered it a religious obligation not only to believe in the existence of God but to verifyGod’s existence through rational proof. Even the obligation to love God required208Notes to pages 73–75"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"study of physics and metaphysics in order to cultivate appreciation of God’s world.Maimonides codified these ideas in his code of Jewish law, the Mishneh Torah. Mai-monides stresses the importance of a systematic study of physics and metaphysics inorder to increase one’s knowedge, awe, and love of the Divine. It is precisely thiskind of religious rationalism that is foreign to Ha-Levi.Maimonides’ purpose is to reconcile religion and philosophy for those whosefaith may have been shaken by Aristotelianism. Sa¡adya lived before the full impactof Aristotelian philosophy had been felt, and thus saw philosophy as a tool to bolsterfaith. Ha-Levi, in contrast to both, seeks to show that Jewish tradition is self-supporting and does not need the bolstering of philosophy.

Wolfson notes that the term kal ̄am—which literally means “speech” or“word”—is used to translate the Greek term logos(word, reason, or argument), butalso to designate any special branch of learning. The participle mutakallim(pl.mu-takallim ̄un) signifies the master or exponent of that special branch of learning. ThusHa-Levi in V:14 refers to “people belonging to the same school of mutakallim ̄un . . .such as the school of Pythagorus, the school of Empedocles, the school of Aristotle. . .” (p. 212). In that passage he is clearly referring to thinkers in a broad sense, andnot theologians in the more specialized, Islamic sense of the term. (Contrast Strauss,above, Introduction, p. 19, n.42.)The term kal ̄amalso took on the technical Islamic sense of the discussion ofarticles of faith (theology) in contrast to discussion of matters of law (fiqh),andmutakallim ̄unwere those whose specialty was theological discussion.

Modern scholars such as Van Ess and Wolfson tend to agree. They char-acterize the method of k ̄alamas fundamentally apologetic and polemical, notingthat it does not offer apodictic proofs, but merely rebuts the arguments of opponentsas they arise.

Translators from Ibn Tibbon on have translated both naqland taql ̄ıdasmesorah, qabbalahor “tradition,” confusing two distinct concepts which are notinterchangeable. In Islamic parlance, naqlis true, sound tradition, and always has apositive connotation. Taql ̄ıdis unquestioning reliance, and is most often lookedupon as a necessary evil for the simple-minded.In IV:17, theÓHaverproclaims: “All who follow the divine law [al-n ̄am ̄us al-il ̄ ah ̄ı] follow the people of this seeing. Their souls find pleasantness [taÓtuayyaba] intaql ̄ıdupon them, [despite] the simplicity of their speech and the coarseness of theirexamples, a pleasantness they do not find in taql ̄ıdon the philosophers, [despite] thefineness of their examples, and the fine order of their compositions, and the proof[burh ̄an] that appears to them. Nevertheless the masses do not follow them. Theirsouls are inspired [wuÓhiya] with the truth, as it says, ‘Words of truth are recog-nized’” (Sota 9b) (IV:17: 170).And at the end of theÓHaver’s exposition of the principles of rabbinic Judaism inBook Three, the King expresses his satisfaction thus: “You have given me pleasant-ness of soul [Ótayyabta nafs ̄ı] and strengthened my belief in sound tradition [naql]”(III:74: 146).117.

Perhaps Ha-Levi was also uncomfortable with the spiritual path laid outby Ba Óhya, who arranged al-Hid ̄ayain a series of ten gates through which the soultravels in its journey towards God. Ba Óhya in fact seems to have followed the degreesof piety laid out by the Sufi teacher al-Makk ̄ı. Amos Goldreich observes that Ba Óhyamay have seen the duties of the heart as an autonomous system of inner duties par-allel to the 613 commandments. In contrast, KuzariI:103, for example, describesJacob’s sons as ascending in purity and holiness, but not through a systematic path.Strictly speaking, Sufi thinkers distinguished between spiritual stages or stations(maq ̄am ̄at),which could be mapped out and attained by the disciple, and mysticalstates (aÓhw ̄al,sing.Óh ̄al),which could only be granted by the grace of God.

R. J. McCarthy draws an intuitive connection between Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s use ofdhawqand Psalm 34:8.

I think, then, that dhawqis not simply a kind of cognition, but an immediateexperience accompanied by savoring, or relishing, and enjoyment, i.e., what I like tocall a fruitional (fruitive) experience.”Hava Lazarus-Yafeh shows a development in Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s thinking as he gropesfor an appropriate metaphor for religious experience, moving from scent to taste.See ¡Abd al-Razz ̄aq al-Qash ̄an ̄ı, Istil ̄ah ̄ at al- Ós ̄ufiyya, 162; Translation here is myown.

This profession of faith has its origin in Qur™ ̄an III:18: “God bears witness(sh ̄ ahada) that there is no god but He—and also do the angels and those possessed ofknowledge—maintainer of justice; there is no god but He, the mighty, the wise.”11. While the term shah ̄ıdis used in the Qur™ ̄an in the sense of ordinarytheological witness, the technical sense of shah ̄ıdas witness unto death for the sakeof the faith is a post-Qur™ ̄anic development. At the same time the notion grew thatthe greater jih ̄ador striving for the sake of the faith was not to be found on theouter battleground but in the inner field of one’s own soul, in the struggle with one’spassions. Thus grew the notion in Islam of the ascetic martyr, the person who expe-riences passionate love but restrains his passion and dies chaste. The traditionabout martyrs of love appears first in Ab ̄u Bakr MuÓhammad b. D ̄aw ̄ud al-IÓsfah ̄an ̄ı(868 – 910): “The Messenger of God—on him be blessing and peace—said: He wholoves and remains chaste and conceals his secret and dies, dies a martyr” (Kit ̄ab al-Zahra, 66).We find another use of the root sh-h-din the poetry of both sacred and secularlove—the beloved is termed a sh ̄ ahid(not to be confused with the martyr, shah ̄ıd);his beauty is held to be a physical testimony to the beauty of the Divine. To put it dif-ferently, the boy is a “thing present” (sh ̄ ahid) which points to the “thing absent”(gh ̄ a’ib);the youth’s beauty gives the contemplator some sense of the beauty of theDivine.

Avicenna uses the same form of this verb (the fourth form, in its nominalform ish ̄ara) in the title of his famous “Eastern” work in which he discusses Sufism,al-Ish ̄ar ̄ at wa-l-tanb ̄ıh ̄at. Ish ̄ar ̄ atis often translated as “directions” or “directives,”viz., The Book of Directives and Hints(A-M. Goichon, tr. Livre des directives et re-marques).50. Literally: “reality of their being(s).” The expression Óhaqiqat dhaw ̄atihimis itself multivalent; each word is both a philosophical and mystical term for truth oressence. Al-Óhaqqis the truth or the true; dhaw ̄atis the plural of dh ̄ at, which signifiesessence or being. The phrase could thus plausibly refer to discovering some essentialtruth about God conveyed by God’s personal name Lord.51. TheÓHaverintroduces the subject of mush ̄ahadaspecifically in answer tothe question of how God can have a personal name when God cannot be pointed to orindicated—i.e., in answer to the question of how a transcendent God can be known.TheÓHaver’s answer is that God can be “seen” in prophetic witness (mush ̄ahadanabawiyya) and spiritual vision or insight (baÓ s ̄ıra).One who meets God in propheticmush ̄ahadaknows the Divine in such a way that calling God by a personal name isentirely fitting. TheÓHaver’s words thus suggest the distinction between impersonalknowledge and personal knowledge, expressed in French by the terms savoir(toknow a fact) and connâitre(to know a person or thing). Mush ̄ahadaoffers personal,experiential knowledge, the sense in which we know someone because we have metthat person and experienced his or her presence. To know or to see a person is an ex-perience that is direct and unmediated, one that cannot occur vicariously—and thisfor Ha-Levi is the mode of prophetic knowing.52. Or: in (bi) prophetic witness and in spiritual vision53. Or: inference.54. He goes on: “This is the faculty which philosophers call speculative or re-flective [al-quwwa... al-¡ ̄aqila al-naÓzariyya]. However, when it is illumined by theholy light and its veil is withdrawn by the guidance of the Truth, philosophers call itthe holy faculty.” Jurj ̄an ̄ ı quotes this definition of b a Ós ̄ı r ain his dictionary, and givesa similar definition for dhawq: “Taste [al-dhawq] in the knowledge [or knowing][ma¡rifa] of God is an expression for a knowing light [n ̄ur ¡irf ̄an ̄ı] which the Truth inhis Revelation throws out into the hearts of his Companions, by which they distin-guish between the true [al-Óhaqq] and the false, without their reporting [yanq ̄ul ̄ u] itfrom a book or other [source].”David Kaufmann called attention to the Sufi character of the terms in this pas-sage (IV:3) in Ha-Levi, and mentions ¡Abd al-Razz ̄aq. ¡Abd al-Razz ̄aq, IÓsÓtil ̄aÓh ̄at, ed.Sprenger, 16, “b a Ós ̄ı r a.” Translation given here is my own.

The continuation of Sa¡adya’s passage gives additional indication thatHa-Levi may have had it in mind. Sa¡adya writes of the prophets: “When one ofthem sees this light, he says, ‘I have seen the Glory of the Lord.’ Often, however, hewould say simply: ‘I have seen God,’ by way of ellipsis.” Similarly, in IV:3 after theÓHaverdescribes all the manifestations included under the rubric “Glory,” IbnTibbon’s Hebrew translation reads: “And they called that Glory of the Lord, andsometimes they called it Lord. And sometimes they called the ark Lord.”Some Arabic manuscripts leave out “and sometimes they called it Lord,” andBaneth-Ben-Shammai suggest that the addition may be a scribal error. Even withoutthe addition, Ha-Levi notes the ellipsis present in calling the ark of the Lord “Lord.”If Ha-Levi did have the Sa¡adya passage in mind, this argues for the additionalphrase on calling the Glory “Lord” as authentic. See Baneth and Ben-Shammai,Kit ̄ab al-radd wa’l-dal ̄ıl, 149, n.8; Am ̄an ̄ at, Qafih, 110 – 11; Rosenblatt, 130.Elsewhere in the Am ̄an ̄ at, Sa¡adya writes: “It is a form nobler even than [thatof] the angels, magnificent in character, resplendent with light which is called theGlory [Kavod] of the Lord. It is this form, too, that one of the prophets described asfollows: ‘I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit[Dan 7:9], and that the Sages characterized as Abiding [Shekhinah].’” Aman ̄at, 103 –4; Rosenblatt, 121.

The Talmudic tractateÓHagigah14b describes the vision of the chariot(merkavah) as an “understanding of the heart” (ovanta de-libba).R.

Nathan of Rome interprets R. Hai Gaon’s description of the visionaries of thechariot similarly: “They do not ascend on high, but they see and envision in the cham-bers of their heart like a man who sees and envisions something clearly with his eyes,and they hear and speak with an eye that sees by means of the holy spirit (or: by meansof a seeing eye, by the holy spirit [be-¡eyn ha-sokheh be-ruaÓh ha-qodesh]).” Here R.Nathan borrows a phrase used in Leviticus Rabbah 1:3 with reference to prophecy:“prophets who see by the Holy Spirit” [nevi’im she-sokhim be-ruaÓh ha-qodesh].

The metaphor of the inner eye is common in Sufi thought, which oftenspeaks of the seeing of the heart (ru’yat al-qalb).See Ab ̄u ÓT ̄alib al-Makk ̄ı, Q ̄ut al-qul ̄ub(Cairo, 1310) I, 235; cited by A.

Medieval philosophical texts spoke of internal senses, faculties residingwithin the brain and operating without bodily organs. Today we regard such phe-nomena—for example imagination, memory, estimation—as mental functions. Ha-Levi twice lists the various internal senses (III:5, V:12). In V:12—a passage drawnfrom Avicenna—he also describes how these internal senses function.In the extended passage on prophecy in IV:3, however, theÓHaveruses the terminternal sensein a non-technical way. Ha-Levi is seeking a means to describe whatgoes on in the phenomenon of prophecy. Based on his knowledge of Arabic sources,he attributes it to a “sixth sense,” which in IV:3 he describes alternately as: the innersense (al- Óhass al-b ̄atin),an inner eye (¡ayn b ̄aÓtina),a vision (baÓsar) clearer than logic(qiy ̄as),and the spiritual eye (al-¡ayn al-ruÓh ̄aniyya) by which the prophets were madesuperior (fuÓdÓdilu).He also explains that this inner eye “might almost be said to be”the imaginative faculty (al-quwwa al-mutakhayyila) insofar as it serves (supplies) theintellect. See Harry Wolfson, “The Internal Senses in Latin, Arabic, and HebrewPhilosophic Texts,” StudiesI, 250 – 52; Alfred Ivry, “The Philosophical and Relig-ious Arguments in Rabbi Yehuda Halevi’s Thought” (Hebrew) in Thought and Ac-tion: Essays in Memory of Simon Rawidowicz on the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary ofHis Death, ed.

We have seen that R. Nissim Gaon argued similarly that the event atMount Sinai gave Israel direct, irrefutable, sensible knowledge (yed¡iat ha-hargashot)in contrast to knowledge by proofs (yed¡iat ha-re’ayot) upon which he argues theother nations must rely. Poznanski, “Megillat Setarim,” 178 – 80.6. For a modern theologian who offers a similar argument with respect tocommunities of revelation, see H. R. Niebuhr, The Meaning of Revelation(NewYork, 1941).7. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, for example, writes: “In general, then, the prophets [peace beupon them] are the healers of the maladies of hearts. Reason is simply useful to in-form us of this; to testify to prophecy that [prophecy} is correct; and to itself that itis unable to reach what can be reached by the eye of prophecy; and to take us by ourhands and turn us over to the prophets, [just] as blind men are handed over to guidesand as troubled sick men are handed over to compassionate physicians. Thus farmay the intellect proceed, but it is precluded from going beyond that, except tounderstand what the physician prescribes for it.” Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, Munqidh, 146; Watt, 70;McCarthy, 102; cf. Ba Óhya, Al-Hid ̄ajaI:2, ed. Yahuda, 39 – 40; Qafih, 49; Monsoor,113.8. Similarly, Ghazz ̄al ̄ı sees mush ̄ahadaand dhawqas a bridge between the re-ligious experience of Sufis at the beginning of their path and that of prophets. Lazarus-Yafeh notes the danger traditionalists would see in such a doctrine, which erases thedistinction between prophets and others. Ha-Levi, however, extends this bridge to in-clude not only the pious (awliy ̄a’),but the entire people of Israel who stood at MountSinai. Munqidh, 134; Watt, 61; McCarthy, 95; Lazarus-Yafeh, Studies, 304 – 5.9. A recurring theme in the Kuzariis that of mutually corroborating testi-mony. Ha-Levi draws from the Islamic legal tradition the concept of taw ̄atur, thechain of tradition—ideally, that which is passed down by several independent chainsof transmission, which taken together offer mutually corroborating testimony. Be-cause independent chains of tradition give the same report, collusion and error areruled out. Ha-Levi draws upon this concept with respect to prophetic visions as wellas the transmission of law. Cf. IV:3: 157; I:25: 12; V:14: 213. On taw ̄atur, see AronZysow, The Economy of Certainty: An Introduction to the Typology of IslamicLegal Theory(Ann Arbor: University Microfilms, 1984), 11ff.10. For example, the Islamic confession of faith is known as the shah ̄ada, anda religious martyr is known as a witness (shah ̄ıd) to God. See above, 92– 93.11.

Note that the Ikhw ̄an al-Ósaf ̄a’ draw upon Neo-Platonic ideas; they do notdistinguish the inner eye from the eye of the intellect which sees non-physical truths.While at times Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, too, identifies the heart with the intellect or a power withinthe intellect, in other passages he draws upon the Sufi image of a knowing of the heartthat is superior to intellectual knowledge. Ibn ÓTufayl stands somewhere between thetwo traditions. He recognizes that the kind of knowing Avicenna speaks of when de-scribing the Sufis transcends purely intellectual knowledge, and asserts that his notionof mush ̄ahadaechoes this Sufi conception. Ha-Levi, like Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, draws a sharpcontrast between prophetic knowledge—which for him is like sense experience—andintellectual knowledge. See Baneth, “Halevi ve al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ ı,” 316 n.4; Julius Gutt-mann, “Religion and Knowledge,” 21– 23; Ibn ÓTufayl,ÓHayy, Gauthier, 5– 7; Good-man, 96 – 97; Wolfson, “Merkavah Traditions,” 223 – 24 and nn.140 – 41.16. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, Munqidh, 138; translation, McCarthy 97; Watt, 64. DavidKaufmann traced Ha-Levi’s notion of the inner eye to this passage in Ghazz ̄al ̄ı. Kauf-mann, Attributenlehre, 202 n.180. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı suggests that the dream state offers an-other analogy; its claims would seem absurd to a person who had never dreamed.17. For example, that gray is a sad color, red a lively color. These exampleswere suggested to me by Professor Everett Rowson.18. Originally, the blind person is given enough information to make his wayaround the city; his knowledge is functional knowledge. However it is indirectknowledge, knowledge based upon hearsay or blind trust (taql ̄ıd).When given sight,it becomes direct, experiential knowledge.Ibn ÓTufayl compares the difference between theoretical understanding and ac-tual experience to that between seeing the world in black and white and seeing theworld in color. However, he believes that just as it is crucial that one experience foroneself, so it is crucial that one come to an intellectual understanding for oneself;otherwise one is simply relying blindly on someone else’s understanding, with nounderstanding of one’s own—i.e., one is left in the situation of taql ̄ıd. Ibn ÓTufayl’sposition here is thus similar to Ba Óhya’s (See above, p. 206, n.74). One might com-pare this to the difference between receiving the answer to a complicated mathemat-ical problem and personally going through the process of arriving at the solution.Ibn ÓTufayl offers an interesting argument against taql ̄ıd: if one believes some-thing on blind faith, one cannot develop it further. A person who has been given thesolution to a mathematical proof can do no further investigation into the matter forhim or herself. Ibn ÓTufayl,ÓHayy, Gauthier, 18 – 20; Goodman, 102– 3.19. Ha-Levi makes an exception for the collective experience of Mount Sinai(I:87– 91: 24 – 27), and does describe a continuum in the capacity for mush ̄ahada(IV:11: 163). TheÓHaveralso absolves the philosophers for their use of qiy ̄as, notingthat they only resorted to qiy ̄asbecause of the absence of prophecy and divine light(V:14: 212).20.

When God revealed [himself] [awÓha] to him, heabandoned all his logical arguments [qiy ̄as ̄ at] and turned to seek the favor of God(IV:26 – 27: 184 – 85).22. In a quote mistakenly attributed to Plato. A prophet received a propheticrevelation (wa Óhy),which he related to a philosopher: “You cannot reach me [taÓ silu]by this path [Ótar ̄ıq], but by those I have set as an intermediary between myself andmy creatures, that is, the prophets and the true law” (IV:27: 184).23. As Altmann points out, Karaites and Muslims of a rationalistic bentcharged Rabbanite Jews with gross anthropomorphism, in these very terms; they ac-cused the Rabbanites of tashb ̄ıh, or the “likening” of God to a human being. See Alt-mann, “Moses Narboni’s ‘Epistle on Shi¡ur Qomah” in idem, Studies, 181.24. For, theÓHaverasserts, “prophets have a vision [baÓsar] clearer than qiy ̄as.And that vision perceives the supernal host clearly [directly] [¡iy ̄ anan], and sees theheavenly inhabitants—the spiritual beings that are near [to God] and others—in theform of a person [adam]. There is an allusion to them in his saying, ‘Let us make hu-manity in our image, according to our likeness [Gen. 1:26]’” (IV:3: 156).Moshe Idel suggests that Ha-Levi is drawing here on a notion from the Shi¡urQomahliterature, which describes the angels as collectively comprising a gianthuman form. Idel also points out a problem in Ha-Levi’s argument: while propheticvision is more direct, what is seen is not God himself, but those who serve as God’sprimary instruments and thus can only figuratively be pointed to as God. The philos-ophers, in contrast, use analogies which are indirect, but do nevertheless arrive at adescription of the Divine itself.Idel’s point is well taken, and sheds a somewhat different light on Ha-Levi’sview of prophetic visions. TheÓHaverexplains that God cannot be pointed to di-rectly, for God is not encompassed by place. To speak about God, therefore, we usemetonym; we point to God through things associated with him. The closest repre-sentations we have for God are things that follow God’s will directly, with no inter-mediary—the heavens, the ark of the covenant, the pillar of cloud and fire, evenprophets and scholars.In this context theÓHaverrefers to the vision of Ex. 34: the spiritual form[al- Ós ̄ura al-ruÓh ̄aniyya] which the elite saw, “and under his feet was a sa-phire pavement” and which was called “the God of Israel.” And likewise,one points to the ark of the covenant and says that it is the Lord of all theearth, on account of the appearance of miracles when it is present and theirabsence when it is not, just as we say that the eye sees, even though thatwhich sees is really other than [the eye], namely, the soul. (IV:3: 152)TheÓHaversuggests that the spiritual form which the nobles saw is called theGod of Israel by association, just as we call the ark of the covenant “Lord of all the222Notes to page 107"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"earth” because it is associated with God’s miracles. TheÓHaver’s words suggest thatwe sometimes point to physical images such as the ark, the pillar of cloud, or thespiritual form, and speak of them as divine through an association which is to beunderstood figuratively, not literally. Thus Ha-Levi’s view of prophetic visions maynot be as far from the view of the rationalists as is often assumed. See also above, p.218, n.56.

Ha-Levi does entice the philosophical reader with the de-scription of an inner eye that sees the essence of things, like the Neo-Platonic “eye ofthe intellect,” but he contradicts this assertion in the very same passage. Motzkin,“On Halevi’s Kuzarias a Platonic Dialogue,” Interpretation9.1 (1980): 116 – 17.40. This is not a radical or anti-philosophical position; as we have noted, it isin keeping with Aristotle’s empiricism.41. Cf.

Islamic thinkers had confronted the problem of anthropomorphism whenthey encountered Greek rationalism in the eighth through the tenth centuries. Whilethese scholars were engaged in translating, interpreting, and digesting Greek philo-sophical texts, they also attempted to make sense of Qur™ ̄anic accounts of visions ofGod in light of Greek philosophy. Jewish rationalists in the period of the gaonim—both Rabbanite and Karaite—drew from the work of these Islamic philosophers andtheologians.44. The Karaite Josef al-Ba Ósir uses this characteristic Mu¡tazilite argument.See Altmann, “Sa¡adya’s Theory of Revelation: Its Origin and Background,” inSaadya Studies, ed. E. I. J. Rosenthal (Manchester, 1943), 8.45. Ibid., 9 – 10; A. J. Wensinck, The Muslim Creed(Cambridge, 1932), 64.46. R. Nissim compares this to the fact that God can have no place, for he isthe creator of all place. He explains that this story was mentioned among “their hag-gadot,” which Poznanski interprets to mean Arabic tales. Poznanski could not findthe source of this legend; he posits that perhaps R. Nissim learned it orally from aMuslim sage. See Poznanski, “Megillat Setarim,” 186 – 87.47. The gaonim speak of a “seeing of the heart” similar to that of Sufis andSufi-influenced thinkers such as Ghazz ̄al ̄ı. The inner eye (¡ayn b ̄aÓtin, KuzariIV:3:155) and the eye of the heart (‘eyn ha-lev),which he speaks of in his poetry, probablyderive from both gaonic and Sufi sources.

In our discussion of mush ̄ahadawe noted that Ha-Levi also echoes this pas-sage closely in another statement of theÓHaver’s, in which he says that the select“witness [God] [yush ̄ahid ̄una] by means of what is called Glory [kavod], Shekhina. . . and other things by which he proved to them [yadullahum] that they had beenaddressed by him on High.” (IV:3: 149).

TheÓHaveroffers this explanation in response to the king’s rhetoricalquestion: isn’t it possible to arrive at knowledge of all God’s attributes intellectually,without engaging in anthropomorphism (tajs ̄ım)?In his reply, theÓHaverironicallyshifts the negative connotation of tajs ̄ım, showing that his philosophical criticsthemselves have need for tajs ̄ımto describe God.Although theÓHaverdoes not use the word qiy ̄asin this particular passage, heuses the terms likeness(mith ̄al) and imitation(Óhik ̄aya),which are close to the primarysense of the term qiy ̄as, analogy. In contrast to philosophical qiy ̄as—the Aristoteliansyllogism—the qiy ̄asof the theologians is considered by the philosophers to be just aform of imitation (tamth ̄ıl) of the physical. However in this passage, theÓHaversug-gests that the philosophers themselves cannot speak of God without tamth ̄ıl.64.muÓhdathunIbid., Qafih, 103; Rosenblatt, 121. Sa¡adya says specificallythat the spirit and word referred to by David—”The spirit of the Lord spoke by meand His word was upon my tongue” (II Sam. 23:2)—are things “specially created byGod, constituting the detailed speech revealed [awÓh ̄a] by God to his prophet.” Ibid.,Qafih, 92; Rosenblatt, 105; see below, pp. 125 – 126.65.tajs ̄ım66.tashb ̄ıh67. It may be useful to compare Ha-Levi’s position on the role of images orimitations (Óhik ̄ayat) with the view of al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı. As we have seen above, al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı ex-plains that, in addition to the imagination’s role in ordinary perception, it has theNotes to pages 113–115225"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"function of reproductive imitation (muÓhak ̄at).That is, the imagination can copy sen-sations or rational concepts; it can imitate the concept of a sovereign being by pro-ducing the image of a splendid king. If the person’s imagination is extremely power-ful, the light from the Active Intellect that produces this image in the imaginationcan even produce the image before his or her physical eyes.In al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı’s description it seems that the mind of the prophet creates the image;the imagination translates an abstract idea emanated by the Active Intellect into asensible image. Ha-Levi’s language, however, is ambiguous; theÓHaversays “there isarranged or ordered” (tantaÓzimu) for the prophet God’s majesty, omnipotence andother attributes in an instantaneous image. This ambiguous phrase could suggestthat, as for al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı, the prophet’s mind arranges the abstract concept of a king intoa visual image. However, theÓHaveralso asserts that the form is created specificallyfor the prophet. It is not clear whether the form is created in his mind, or in the spiri-tual realm, whether it is created by God, or by the prophet’s own cognitive faculties.In contrast to al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı, Ha-Levi does not mention a role for the Active Intellectin the production of images. However, he seems to leave open several possibilities:(1) that the form is newly created by God for the prophet (IV:5: 160, IV:3, 158; Sa¡-adya’s view); (2) that the form is a permanent celestial being (IV:3, 158; the Karaiteview, and that of classical merkavahliterature); (3) that the form is created by themind of the prophet (IV: 5: 160; the view of al-F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı). Note also the view of II:4 – 7:45– 46 that the spiritual forms arise from the action of the divine light upon a subtlespiritual substance.

Then their state [Óh ̄al] ascends from wit-ness [mush ̄ahada] [sing.] of forms and likenesses [amth ̄al] to degrees for which theboundary [scope] of words is too confining.”We see then that the term mush ̄ahadais used in two ways: (1) in the plural(mush ̄ahad ̄at) for discrete experiences or for the witnessing of forms, for visionsthat have content; (2) in the singular (mush ̄ahada) for a contemplative experi-ence, which may include witness of forms, or may simply be an awareness of thedivine presence, often within the heart of the seeker.

In Islamic thought, a private message for an individual is called ilh ̄ am(in-spiration), in contrast to that which bears a message for others as well, which isknown as wa Óhy(revelation).

ÓHananel writes of the four who enter pardes: “they did not ascend toheaven but they contemplated and saw by means of an understanding of the heart[ovanta de libba].” (See above, n.1.) R. Hai Gaon identifies the pardesnarrativeexplicitly with vision of the merkavah: “Regarding these contemplations (of theNotes to pages 116–117227"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"merkavah) the tannataught, ‘Four entered pardes’—those palaces were alluded to bythe term pardes, and they were designated by this name. . . . For God . . . shows to therighteous, in their interior, the visions of his palaces and the position of his angels.”R. Nathan of Rome, a younger contemporary, maintains that R. Hai is describ-ing an inner vision. R. Hai, he writes, intended to suggest that those contemplatingthe merkavah“do not ascend on high, but they see and envision in the chambers oftheir heart like a man who sees and envisions something clearly with his eyes, andthey hear and tell and speak with an eye that sees by means of the Holy Spirit.”R. Hai’s famous responsum has been much discussed by scholars in this century.Scholem believes R. Hai is describing contemplation of the merkavahas an actualascent to heaven, and he translates R. Hai’s account accordingly: “. . . he perceivesthe interior and the chambers, as if he saw the seven palaces with his own eyes, andit is as though he entered one palace after the other and saw what is there.”Idel, however, argues that Nathan of Rome’s interpretation is essentially cor-rect, that R. Hai is speaking of an inner journey rather than a celestial ascent. Thechambers perceived, therefore, are chambers in the heart of the visionary him– orherself: “. . . he perceives within himself and in the chambers [of his heart] as if hesaw the seven palaces with his own eyes, and it is as though he entered one palaceafter another and saw what is there.” Idel maintains that R. Hai misinterpreted whatwas originally an ecstatic experience as an inner vision; he suggests this would becongruent with R. Hai’s view of prophetic vision of God’s Glory as an “understand-ing of the heart.”See Otsar ha-Geonim, ed. B. Lewin onÓHagigah(Jerusalem, 1932), Teshuvot,pp. 14 – 15; ¡Arukh ha-Shalem, ed.

We are reminded of theÓHaver’s parable of seeing the king of India; finalarrival (wuÓs ̄ul) includes not just seeing (ru’ya) the king, but keeping his command-ments and covenants. See I:109: 37– 38 and above, 42– 44.Like mush ̄ahada, the term Ha-Levi chooses for Elisha b. Abuya’s act of contem-plation (ashrafa) contains a visual component. However, the fact that he contem-plates the separate intelligences, and believes contemplation exempts him from ac-tion, highlights the intellectual nature of his pursuit.Mention of the separate intelligences reminds us of theÓHaver’s agnostic state-ment about angels: “Perhaps they are the spiritual entities [r ̄uÓh ̄aniyy ̄un] of which thephilosophers speak. We have neither to accept nor reject [their position]” (IV:3:158). Ha-Levi is agnostic about the precise ontological status of what one witnessesin the spiritual world. His emphasis is the subjective dimension, and he drawsequally upon philosophical and aggadic motifs to make his point: that direct witnessis more powerful than logic.228Notes to pages 117–118"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"87.inÓhallameans to dissolve, disintegrate; tark ̄ıbis a structure, construction,physique or constitution.88.

Schramm (Albany, 1991), 81.Yefet depicts a similar form of inspiration in his comment on the story of theseventy elders in Numbers 11:25: “[The Torah’s] words ‘And they prophesied and didno more’ [signify] the prophecy that they prophecied when the Spirit of Wisdom [ruaÓhha- Óhokhmah] rested upon them. The Torah does not explain what they prophesied; itis possible that they said song and praise by the Holy Spirit [shir ve-shevaÓh be-ruaÓh ha-qodesh]. [The Torah’s] words ‘and they did no more’ teaches that the spirit of proph-ecy [ruaÓh ha-nevuah] did not rest upon them except for that time alone.”Ben-Shammai comments on this passage: “The Holy Spirit is not a sort ofspeech or vision that the prophet hears or sees and transmits to his audience; it is aninspiration that causes the possessor of the Holy Spirit to do certain things, to act ina certain way, or to say certain things, chiefly words of songs and praise.” He be-lieves Yefet’s pairing of the Holy Spirit with ilh ̄ amis deliberate and far reaching:232Notes to pages 124–125"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Yefet intends to suggest that while Hannah speaks under the inspiration of the HolySpirit, it is she herself who shapes the words of her prayer.Ben-Shammai adduces much textual evidence to support his notion that Yefet issuggesting an equation between the Holy Spirit and ilh ̄ am. Ben-Shammai’s textualevidence is highly suggestive, although I am not certain it is conclusive. That is, thenotion of divine inspiration is a slippery one; it is not always clear what the Sagesthemselves intend when they speak of David or other Biblical figures being inspiredby the Holy Spirit. The term Holy Spirit is used in rabbinic literature in many differ-ent senses, some of which refer to prophecy, some to a more diffuse form of divineguidance.If the rabbis did make a clear distinction, it was between literal dictation—Mo-saic prophecy—and inspiration by the Holy Spirit, that accorded to other prophets.We find in rabbinic literature a sense that the background and personality of partic-ular prophets does shape their individual messages. For example, we find the notionthat Isaiah and Ezekiel see the same divine realm; however, given Isaiah’s aristocraticbackground, the heavenly court is not a surprise to him, while Ezekiel, as a villager,is awe struck and so describes it in great detail. Underlying such a statement is the as-sumption that the prophet is not a passive instrument receiving dictation. The pro-phetic message in some way reflects who the prophet is; the message is to some per-ceptible degree filtered through the human personality. On the Holy Spirit, see belowp. 133 n.162. For discussions of prophecy and inspiration, see James Kugel, ed.,Poetry and Prophecy(Ithaca, 1990). For Ben-Shammai’s textual evidence that Yefetis equating prophecy and ilh ̄ am, see Ben-Shammai, Qirqis ̄an ̄ı ve-Yefet ben ¡El ̄ıvol-ume I, pp. 251– 73, including notes and passages cited in appendices (volume 2). Itranslate several of these passages into English in my dissertation, pp. 361– 62.119. The notion of David or Hannah’s uttering prayers under the inspirationof the Holy Spirit is not in itself radical, nor does it necessitate non-literal inspira-tion. Ilh ̄am, on the other hand, had clearly become a charged term in the Islamicworld. What is problematic in Yefet’s statement about Hannah is his equation ofHoly Spirit with ilh ̄ am, not the fact that Hannah uttered the prayer under the influ-ence of the Holy Spirit.120. For Mu¡tazilite arguments against ilh ̄am, see above, 124. This motiva-tion, it seems to me, is clear in Ha-Levi as well. For example, Ha-Levi writes: “Thespeech of prophets at the time the Holy Spirit [ruaÓhha-qodesh] enwraps them is inevery word directed from the ™a m r i l ̄ah ̄ı;the prophet cannot alter a word” (KuzariV:20: 221).This statement in Ha-Levi calls to mind MuÓhammad’s words regarding therecitation (Qur™ ̄an) he received: “It is not for me to change it of my own accord[min tilq ̄a’ nafsih] I only follow what is revealed to me [ ̄uÓhiya ¡il ̄ayya].” It is inter-esting to note that the Ikhw ̄an al- Ósaf ̄a’, while holding that the prophet himselfshapes the words of prophecy, insist that the prophet does not inject anything ofhis own ideas or opinions into the revelation he transmits.

See Tehilim, tr. Qafih, 35 (long introduction); 53 (short introduction).Among other reasons, Sa¡adya is countering those Karaites who saw the Book ofPsalms as prayers that David himself wrote under divine inspiration, and which Jewscould therefore use at any time as their personal prayers. Sa¡adya restricts permissibleprayer to those prayers prescribed at set times of the day by rabbinic authorities.While Simon sees this polemic against the Karaite use of psalms for prayer asSa¡adya’s primary motive in his long introduction to Psalms, Ben-Shammai arguesthat the polemic over prayer must be understood within the context of the widerissue of revealed Scripture as wa Óhy, divinely dictated text. See Uriel Simon, Four Ap-proaches to the Book of Psalms(Hebrew) (Ramat Gan, 1982), 18 – 24; (English), tr.Schramm, 5– 12; Sokolow, “Saadiah Gaon’s Prolegomenon to Psalms,” 148 n.75;Ben-Shammai, “On a Polemical Element,” 131; idem, Review of Uriel Simon, FourApproaches to the Book of Psalmsin Kiryat Sefer58, 400 – 406. For a fuller discus-sion of the Karaite view of inspiration, see my dissertation, Appendix B.124. One might regard this blurring of boundaries either as a raising of ilh ̄ amto the level of prophetic revelation, like the Sh ̄ı¡ites,or as a lowering of wa Óhyto thelevel of inspiration, like the philosophers.125. Even, apparently, ruaÓh ha-qodesh. See my dissertation, 471– 72; BenShammai, “On a Polemical Element,” 128ff.126. Compare I:42: “The king: This degree [of the prophets] is divine and an-gelic, if it exists, and it is of the nature of the Divine [™amr il ̄ah ̄ ı], not the intellectual[™amr ¡aqli], the human [™amr insaniyy], or the natural [physical] [™amr Ótabi¡i]” (I:42: 13)127. The philosophers adapt the term wa Óhyto describe the highest level ofhuman intellectual attainment precisely because the term signifies inspiration whosesource is in some sense divine. The philosophers, however, do not preserve the sub-stantive distinction between wa Óhyand other forms of inspiration which exists in tra-ditional Islamic usage.128. Or sayy’ata min shemaya, as in the following passage from the Babylo-nian Talmud, Megillah6b: “R. Isaac said: If a person says to you, I have labored andnot found, do not believe him.

In this passage Ha-Levi appears to blur the boundaries somewhatbetween prophecy or wa Óhyproper and other forms of inspiration, for he also assertsthat the Holy Spirit enwraps the prophet at the time of prophecy, as well as the priestwho inquires of the urim ve-tummim. However by mentioning divine guidance ofthe Nazir and Messiah separately from prophecy, he may be pointing to various de-grees of inspiration by the Holy Spirit, as in the looser rabbinic use of the term ruaÓhha-qodesh.

For example, according to the Amora R. Avdimi of Haifa, “Since the de-struction of the Temple, prophecy was taken away from the prophets and given tothe Sages” (BT, Bava Batra 12a). Many of the phenomena associated with the HolySpirit continued among the early rabbis, including wonder working, intercessionaryprayers, divination, and receiving messages through dreams.There is also debate about when the Holy Spirit (ruaÓh ha-qodesh) ceased fromIsrael. In addition to the statement in Yoma 9bthat it ceased with the death of thelast prophets, we find opinions both that it dated from the destruction of the FirstTemple and from the destruction of the Second Temple (Yoma 21b).

Or: faculty (quwwa qudsiyya)188. Avicenna, Shif ̄a’: De Anima, published as Avicenna’s De Anima, ed. F.Rahman, 249 – 50.189. In the ordinary process of knowledge, the cogitative faculty (mufakkira)must search through the images of the imagination for the middle term, while theprophet simply makes contact with the Active Intellect and comes upon it immedi-ately. In Avicenna’s theory of intellect, the human intellect must link (yattaÓsilu) withthe Active Intellect each time it has an actual thought. Thoughts, therefore, are nevercontained totally within the human soul; the ordinary person, the philosopher andthe prophet must all turn to the Active Intellect for actual knowledge. The distinctionbetween ordinary knowledge, philosophy, and (intellectual) prophecy is thereforeblurred. Avicenna, like al- F ̄ar ̄ ab ̄ ı, also describes an imaginative form of prophecy.190.hads. “Learning occurs in two ways: one is by way of intuition [hads],which consists of the middle term occurring to the mind without search and thus beingobtained, along with the conclusion [of a syllogism]. The second is through contrivedmeans [h ̄ıla] and [after] search. Intuition [hads] is a divine overflow [fayÓd] and an in-tellectual contact [ittiÓs ̄al] taking place without any act of acquisition [kasb] at all.Some people may reach a stage [of consummate intuition] that they almost have noneed of reflection in most of what they learn, and possess the sacred faculty of thesoul.” Avicenna, Kit ̄ab al-mub ̄aÓhath ̄at, in ArisÓt ̄u ¡ind al-¡Arab, 231; Davidson, “ActiveIntellect,” 167.

Ha-Levi uses two technical terms for the imaginative and estimative facul-ties of the soul, khayaland wahm, which are among the “internal senses” he lays outin detail in several passages of the Kuzari. Like his use of inner eye and internal sensein IV:3, Ha-Levi may be using the terms in a less precise, nontechnical sense here.201.manÓs ̄uÓsan202.mukh ̄ataba203.isn ̄ad afr ̄ad, s ̄ura s ̄ura, wa-aya aya204.bi-bayy ̄an205.ruaÓh ha-qodesh206. Of course, the philosophers, too, use such traditional religious language.Avicenna, for example speaks of the capacity for prophecy as sanctified spirit (ruÓhmuqaddas) and describes the prophet’s mind as a holy intellect or divine power(quwwa qudsiyya).However the philosophers radically reinterpret these traditionalterms. We recall that for Avicenna all human knowledge requires linking with theActive Intellect. What, then, distinguishes ordinary knowledge from “prophetic”knowledge for Avicenna, other than the speed with which it is acquired? Not with-standing Avicenna’s religious language, the “holy intellect” of the prophet is simplymore adept at discovering the middle terms of syllogisms.207. Interestingly, Ha-Levi uses the verb ra’a(to see) rather than sh ̄ ahada(towitness) when speaking of the people’s witness of natural events (the lightning andthunder) and of Moses entering the cloud, although he repeatedly uses sh ̄ ahada,mashhad, and mush ̄ahadawhen speaking of the experience as a whole.208. For an extended sense of the concept of synesthesia, see Warren Zev Har-vey, “Judah Halevi’s Synesthetic Theory of Prophecy and a Note on the Zohar,”147– 58, 151– 52.209. “And the people prepared themselves for the degree of prophetic revela-tion [wa Óhy], even to hear the divine address explicitly [jahran], all of them. . . .

However they did not have the capacity for the wit-ness [mush ̄ahada] of that great thing” (I:87: 24). Hirshfield’s text reads sh ̄ ahadan,rather than jahran, which would make this point even stronger: “The people pre-pared themselves for the degree of prophetic revelation [wa Óhy], even to hearthe di-vine address witnessing[sh ̄ ahadan].” Ha-Levi does use such adverbial phrases withrespect to Abraham: “The meaning of Lord is not grasped analogically [qiy ̄asan],but by witnessing [mush ̄ahadatan]” (IV:15). Similarly in IV:17: “when Abrahamwitnessed [sh ̄ ahada] what he witnessed of the divine ™amrby tasting [dhawqan], notanalogically [qiy ̄asan].”210. Cf.

Comment-ing upon the ruaÓh elohim Óhayyim(divine living spirit or wind) of Sefer Yetsirah IV:1,he posits a subtle “second air” in which are created both the visual forms of theKavodand the created Word of God.

Or: joins, unites; makes contact with; conjoins with, attaches himself to.Ha-Levi’s use of the verb yattaÓsiluhere is open to at least two interpretations. On theone hand, his language is suggestive of an intellectual or spiritual ascent, by which aperson of prophetic vision disengages himself from that which is human in order toascend to the angelic realm and make contact with the angels and the higher visionsavailable to them. However one could also read Ha-Levi’s language of attachmenthere as a matter of classification rather than as a phenomenological description.When a person grasps the meaning of the Tetragrammaton directly by prophetic wit-ness, he or she can no longer be classified strictly as a member of the human species;the person has now joined the species of angels, insofar as he or she has exhibitedthis angelic faculty.242Notes to pages 149–151"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"19.

There exist such images for intimate relationship with the Divine in rab-binic literature as well. See above, p. 199, n.108. Moshe Idel has pointed out that thefirst Biblical use of the root d-b-qoccurs in the story of the Garden of Eden. AfterEve is created from Adam’s side, the text tells us “thus a man leaves his father andmother and clings [davaq] to his wife, and they become one flesh.” Idel notes thatthis clinging suggests an actual union and interpenetration; he speculates that theverb was chosen by Jewish mystics precisely because it could convey such intimatecontact, or even total union (unio mystica).Idel thus suggests that when the Book ofDeuteronomy uses the root d-b-qto enjoin clinging to God, the term retains at leastsome hint of a very intimate connection. He asserts further that when we find in rab-binic literature the motif of Israel’s clinging to God as two dates cling to one another,the rabbis are developing an image of intimate union inherent in the root’s Biblicalusage.

At a certain point, the boundary between sacred and secular love poetrybecame blurred. Any love poem might be quoted and understood in a religious sense,and poets often played with the ambiguity. This trend—which Raymond Scheindlinhas called the “intentional overlapping of secular and sacred love, this pretendedconfusion of the boundaries”—was present in medieval Jewish poetry as well.

Goichon, 493; quoted by Ibn ÓTufayl,ÓHayy,Gauthier, 6; Goodman, 96.39. For example, in addition to its Sufi sense, we find in Avicenna a philo-sophical use of l-dh-dhto describe the bliss of perfect conjunction with the Active In-tellect: “When [a person] is delivered [liberated] from the body and the accidents ofthe body, it becomes possible for him to be conjoined [yattaÓsilu] in a perfect conjunc-tion [ittiÓs ̄al] with the Active Intellect.

The sentence literally244Notes to pages 152–154"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"reads: the Lord is yearned for with a yearning (shawqan) of tasting and witnessing.The phrase is difficult to translate. Tasting and witnessing here are adverbs; it is theyearning that one viscerally experiences. However, it would seem that Ha-Leviwants to say that the seeker yearns to taste and witness the Lord, as the Psalm sug-gests. My translation, if somewhat awkward, is an attempt to allow for both senses,while being true to Ha-Levi’s Arabic.44. Ab ̄u Na Ósr al-Sarr ̄aj lists ten states (aÓhw ̄al) of the soul: constant attention(mur ̄aqaba),proximity (qurb),love (maÓhabba),fear (khawf),hope (raj ̄a’),spiritualyearning (shawq),familiarity (uns),tranquility (iÓtmi’n ̄an),contemplation (mush ̄a-hada),and certainty (yaq ̄ın).

See above, 42– 44.51. This notion is found in Philo, who offers an etymology of the name “Is-rael” as “one who sees God.” See, for example, Philo, On Rewards and Punishments44; On Dreams2.173; On Abraham57; The Embassy to Gaius4. Ellen Birnbaum dis-cusses this idea extensively in her illuminating study of Philo. See Birnbaum, The Placeof Judaism in Philo’s Thought: Israel, Jews, and Proselytes(Atlanta, 1996).

As in the following striking verses, translated gracefully by RaymondScheindlin:If only I could see Him in a dream.I’d sleep at ease, not caring if I died.If I could see His face within my heart,My eyes would never turn their gaze outside.Aharon Komem has traced the theme of dreaming and sleep in Ha-Levi’s po-etry, as the states of the soul most conducive to intense religious experience. Henotes Ha-Levi’s paradoxical use of the image of sleep: it can express the laziness ofthe soul mired in the delights of the temporal, or its opposite, the soul running to-wards communion with her Creator. Komem points out that in both secular and sa-cred poetry, Ha-Levi expresses a longing to remain in sleep so as to prolong dreamvisions, a preference for prophetic vision over everyday reality. He suggests thatHa-Levi’s emigration to the East, in contrast, expresses a desire to realize on the his-torical stage that which he had experienced in dream-visions—in particular, theevent at Mount Sinai.This latter pole is expressed in an exchange between the King and theÓHaverinBook One:TheÓHaver: What do you think of someone who experienced those grand,divine theophanies [man yush ̄ahidu al-mash ̄ahid al -¡aÓz ̄ıma al-malakutiyy]?The King: No doubt he would long for his soul to separate from hersenses and remain delighting [tabq ̄a maladhdatuhu] in that light.

(I:107– 9: 35– 36)Both impulses were no doubt present in Ha-Levi. Komem interprets Ha-Levi’semigration to the Land of Israel as a turning away from the inwardness of meetingGod in dreams and visions, a dramatic statement of the necessity of meeting Godthrough action.

Davidson, Ivry, and others have stressed, correctly I believe, direct divinecausality as one of Ha-Levi’s cardinal principles. See Davidson’s landmark article,“Cuzari,” 374 – 81, 392– 95. Davidson, in fact, interprets the ™amr il ̄ah ̄ıas Ha-Levi’sexpression for direct divine causality (395). See also idem, Intellect, 190 – 95; Wolf-son, “Hallevi and Maimonides on Design, Chance, and Necessity,” PAAJRII (NewYork, 1941), 159.7. For Sa¡adya’s use of kal ̄amarguments, see Wolfson, The Kal ̄am, 85, 87,passim; idem, Repercussions of the Kal ̄am in Jewish Philosophy(Cambridge, 1979),passim. Wolfson notes that Sa¡adya modified some of the kal ̄amarguments he uses,rejecting such Mu¡tazilite ideas as the existence of modes in God and the theory ofatoms.8. Sa¡adya, Am ̄an ̄ at, Introduction, Qafih, 7; Rosenblatt, 9.9. See above, 75– 78 and below 171– 174.10. As Isaak Heinemann points out, the dialogue’s avowed purpose is a “de-fense of the despised religion,” and not a general theological presentation. Heine-mann, Rabi Yehudah Ha-Levi: Ha-’ish ve-hogeh ha-de¡ot, 132.11. Strauss points out that kal ̄amby its very nature is apologetic; its goal is todefend religion and—in Ha-Levi’s words—to refute the heretic. Strauss characterizesthe Kuzariitself as a work of kal ̄am; however, it is doubtful that Ha-Levi would con-cur, given his attacks on kal ̄amin V:1 and V:16. See Motzkin, “On Ha-Levi’s Ku-zari,” 122 n.22. As we noted above (75 and notes), this was an internal Muslim cri-tique of kal ̄am, one which Maimonides echoes in I:71 of the Guide.Notes to pages 158–166247"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"12. Contrast Maimonides’ intellectual notion of ascending to levels of meta-physical study for which one is unprepared. See, for example, GuideI:32. On thispoint, see now Howard Kreisel, “Judah Halevi’s Influence on Maimonides,” in Mai-monidean Studies II, ed. Arthur Hyman, 111.13.Am ̄an ̄ at, Qafih, 111; Rosenblatt, 130; Altmann, “Saadya’s Theory ofRevelation,” 19.14. This assessment holds true even if there may have been original Sufi influ-ence on the ideas of the gaonim. For possible Sufi influence on the gaonim, see Wolf-son, “Merkavah” 219 and sources in n.24.15. The one instance in which Sa¡adya does not give a conservative renderingof the verb d-b-qis in the admonition (or promise) “and you will cling to him [u-le-dovqa bo]” (Deuteronomy 11:22). Here, Sa¡adya uses the same verb, but withoutthe object obedience(Ót ̄ a¡a), translating simply lazimahu. However, perhaps he isrelying on the previous phrase which speaks of “walking in all His ways,” to inter-pret the language of clinging as metaphorical. See above, 198 n.97.16.Ish ̄ar ̄ at, ch. 9; Ibn ÓTufayl,ÓHayy, Gauthier, 7; Goodman, 97.17. See above, p. 242 n.8.18. Fenton affirms that theÓHaver’s “criticism of ascetic solitude in the Kuzari,III:1 . . . is most certainly directed against Sufism.” Fenton, The Treatise of the Pool54, n.3.19. Note that Ba Óhya praises the benefits of Sa¡adya’s works with as much en-thusiasm as does Sa¡adya (see p. 166 above): “Understand from the Book of yourLord that to which I have called your attention, and help yourself in that through theworks of our Rabbi Sa¡adya Gaon, for they bring light to the heart, sharpen themind, direct the careless, and arouse the idle.” Ba Óhya, al-Hid ̄aya, Qafih, 42.20. See Wolfson, Kal ̄am, 85, 87. Wolfson notes that Ba Óhya, like Sa¡adya be-fore him in the East, used modified forms of the kal ̄amarguments for the creation ofthe world and the existence of God, ones which eliminate the theory of atoms. Seealso Menahem Mansoor, “Translator’s Introduction,” Book of Direction, 25– 29,38 – 39.21. Cf. Bernard Septimus, Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition, 61– 62 andnn.3, 11; Baneth, “Autographs,” 300.22. In this, Ba Óhya follows Sufis like Qushayri who also denounced taql ̄ıd. Seeabove, 207 n.74.23. Ba Óhya, Al-Hid ̄aja, ed. Yahuda, 379; tr. Qafih, 410; tr. Ibn Tibbon, Hyam-son, 342– 43.24. Some in the Islamic world did reject ilh ̄ amas a source of valid knowledge.See Van Ess, Erkentisslehre, 121ff.25. These are at least theÓHaver’s avowed opponents. If Ha-Levi was indeedaware of Sa¡adya’s views on wa Óhyand ilh ̄ am, as seems likely, he might also have theKaraites in mind in I:87, although he does not make this explicit.248Notes to pages 166–171"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"26. See Baneth, “Halevi,” 312. Kaufmann comments, for example, that “thestatements of Yehudah Ha-Levi sound like a translation from Ghazz ̄al ̄ı.” Attributen-lehre, 128.27. See Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, IÓhy ̄ a™ ¡ul ̄um al-d ̄ın(Bulaq, 1872– 73), I:22; The Book ofKnowledge, tr. Faris, 54 – 55. For Ghazz ̄al ̄ı on kal ̄am, see also Munqidh, 80 – 83;Watt, 27– 29; McCarthy, 68 – 69.28. Ironically, thinkers often themselves exhibit some of the traits againstwhich they polemicize. Just as Leo Strauss saw the resemblance between the Ku-zariand kal ̄amliterature, so David Baneth suggests that Ghazz ̄al ̄ı’s Tahaf ̄ut al-fal ̄asifashares some (negative) traits of works of kal ̄am. See Baneth, “Halevi ve-al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı,” 313.29. TheÓHaverat the end of IV:25 tells the King: “I communicated these prin-ciples to you lest the philosophers confuse you, and you might think that if you fol-low them, your soul would find rest in satisfactory proof [la-araÓhat nafsuka bi-l-burh ̄an al-sh ̄ af ̄ ı]” (IV:25: 183).And in IV:17, theÓHaversays: “All who follow the divine law [al-n ̄am ̄us al-il ̄ ah ̄ı] follow the people of this seeing [baÓsar]. Their souls find pleasantness[taÓtayyaba] in taql ̄ıdupon them, [despite] the simplicity of their speech and thecoarseness of their examples, a pleasantness they do not find in taql ̄ıdon the philos-ophers, [despite] the fineness of their examples, and the fine order of their composi-tions, and the proof [burh ̄an] that appears to them. Nevertheless the masses do notfollow them” (IV:17: 169).30. Cf. Kaufmann, Attributenlehre, 126 – 28; Baneth, “Ha-Levi ve-al-Ghazz ̄al ̄ı,” 315– 16.31. There are, of course, significant differences between the two thinkers’ useof this image. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı appears to draw upon both a Neo-Platonic, intellectual con-cept of inner vision and a Sufi, mystical or intuitive concept. Ha-Levi, in contrast,sharply contrasts prophetic vision with intellectual knowledge. However, like Ha-Levi, who describes the inner eye as an “internal sense,” Ghazz ̄al ̄ı firmly believesthat the inner eye sees what is not available to the ordinary intellect.32. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, Munqidh, 139 – 40; McCarthy, 98 – 99; Watt, 65– 66.33. See, for example, IV:3, V:14, II:66, III:41. Note that Ghazz ̄al ̄ı attributesknowledge to ilh ̄ am—a controversal assertion, as we saw in Part Four.34. Ghazz ̄al ̄ı, Mishk ̄at al-anw ̄ar (The Niche for Lights),ed. A.
