Thealleged cooperation of the Provençal Jews with local Church officials in theiranti-Maimonidean campaign came as no surprise, Abraham chided,“for thefaith of these is not very different from the faith of those.”1As for the Jewsliving in Islamic lands, he observed with more than a little irony, they expressnot the slightest doubt in the strict monotheism advocated by Maimonideanrationalism.“There is no doubt as to all of this among any of the Jews living inthe lands of Ishmael, from the farthest east to the foremost west.”2As if thispointed suggestion were not absolutely clear, Abraham then directed hisreaders to consider the religion of Islam on its own terms, so as to emphasizeits strict adherence to pure and unadulterated monotheism.The children of Ishmael have, for their part, adopted this [monotheistic] faith fromthe children of Israel and have built the foundation of their religion upon it. Theyhave rejected the error and folly of their ancestors, who used to worship idols anddid not affirm the unity and exaltedness of [God’s] name, as it is written,“Nationsshall come to You from the ends of the earth and say,‘Our ancestors have inheritedlies, [vanity] that is of no avail”(Jer. 16:19).3This was also expressed by one of theprophets,“From the rising of the sun to its setting, My name is great among thenations”(Mal. 1:11). Because their worship is characterized by pure monotheism,scripture likened it to the sacrificial rite [in the Temple] offered for His name, as itis written,“And in every place incense and a pure offering are brought for Myname”(ibid.). Whoever differs and asserts that the Creator, may He be magnifiedand exalted, has a likeness or image, a body or a circumscribed space, does not1SeeMH, 55.2SeeMH, 51.3The word“emptiness”(hevel), as cited from the verse, is missing from the manuscript, asindicated by Margaliot ad loc.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"believe in the truth of his Creator by making [such] a comparison to [God]. He is,for this reason, a heretic and has no place in the world to come.4Abraham Maimonides’remarks in his epistle to the Provençal Jews, full ofdisdain for his wayward coreligionists and respect for the core faith of theIslamic religion, call to mind many of the surprising turns of his remarkablecareer, and, what is more, encapsulate many of the themes at the heart of thisbook. The career of Abraham Maimonides (or, as he is frequently called in themedieval sources and throughout this book, the Nagid)5came to dominateand define his generation, the twilight of the Ayyubid dynasty in Egypt and, ina larger sense, thefinal chapter of what S. D. Goitein has dubbed both theclassical Genizah period and the zenith of“the physical and educationalsymbiosis between Muslims and Jews”in the High Middle Ages.6As weshall have cause to revisit on a number of occasions in this book, the Nagidwas far from complacent with the religious and spiritual condition of hispeople, whether in Provence or (more frequently) in Egypt, and the urgencyof his critique is on full display in this epistle. He was, if nothing else, anadamant reformer of the religious life of Egyptian Jewry in all its aspects.While his own community did not suffer from the alleged heresy of theProvençals, his rebuke bears all the characteristics of discontent with thefaithful of his own religion in the light of the dominant faith of Islam, amajor leitmotif of his controversial career.The irony of Abraham’s polemic in the epistle could not have been lost onhis contemporaries. His comparison of the faith of his coreligionists inChristian Europe with that of the communities of the Islamic world,“fromthe farthest east to the foremost west,”carried a double valence. Beyondthe simple contrast of proper and misguided doctrine, Abraham’s remarksbespeak the more basic contrast between the religion of Christianity and thatof Islam in the eyes of Abraham and many of his Jewish contemporaries in theNear East. While Christianity was perceived, without exception, as idolatrousand polytheistic in essence, Islam was generally viewed as completely anduncompromisingly monotheistic, a view for which Maimonides, Abraham’sfather, was predominantly, though not exclusively, responsible.7With this in4MH,51–2.5For background to this term, the Hebrew equivalent of the Arabicra’īs al-yahūd(“head ofthe Jews”), see Goitein,Med.

In their current downtroddenstate, as a result of generations of decline and degradation in exile, the Jews ofhis day were depicted as highly swayed and influenced by the dominant faithin their respective environments.8If for the Jews of Christian Europe, hesuggested, the influence had largely been a pernicious one, for the Jews ofIslam it had had a remarkably salutary impact on the purity of their faith.“Themisguided faith concerning these principles [of monotheism],”Abrahamcontinued,“in the land of Shin‘ar [Iraq] and the east, Syria and the BeautifulLand [Palestine], Egypt and the land of the west [Maghrab], is negligible for itsscarcity. As soon as anyone [with this faith] would utter it in public, even inthe company of the ignorant, such a one would be reduced to mockery,derision, and scorn.”9The implication is clear. In contrast with some of thegreatest sages dwelling in the realm of Christendom, even the greatest ignor-amuses among the Jews of Islam are unwavering and unsullied in theircommitment to monotheism. While the anti-rationalist scholars of Provence,as the Nagid acerbically hinted at the end of the passage in the epistle citedabove, have been reduced to the status of heresy, the simplest Jew in the realmof Islam, thanks in large part to the salutary influence of their immediateenvironment, remain impeccable believers.Here we are confronted with yet another leitmotif of Abraham Maimonides’legacy—intimately connected with thefirst—the role played by Islam in hiseffort to reform Jewish practice. Despite appearances to the contrary in theepistle, the Nagid found much to critique in his own community’s practicalobservance and the general state of religious life in Egypt. As we shall soon see,not long after his rise to communal leadership, Abraham became embroiled ina number of communal controversies of various kinds and with varyingdegrees of tenacity and success. As the foremost authority over all adminis-trative and religious matters affecting Egyptian Jewry, many of the Nagid’sinitiatives were laden from the beginning with controversy and polemic overthe current state of affairs in his community. A number of these controversiesinvolved internal disputes of Jewish practice and scholarship with no bearingon Islam, as was the case with his liturgical reforms. Others, such as his effortsto reintroduce long-defunct postures and rites into synagogue practice,bespeak the more delicate question of the appropriation of religious normsfrom the Islamic environment. This was all the more evident in the case of hisperception of Islam versus Christianity in light of previous attitudes, see D. Lasker,“Traditionand Innovation in Maimonides’Attitude toward Other Religions,”inMaimonides after 800 Years:Essays on Maimonides and His Influence, ed. J. Harris (Cambridge, M.A.: Harvard UniversityPress, 2007), 167–82.8On the theme of spiritual and religious decline in exile in the thought of the Nagid and hiscolleagues, see the discussion on pp. 64, n. 85, 161, n. 13, 175, n. 67.9SeeMH, 54.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiIntroduction3"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"pietist revival, which engaged openly and intensively with the Sufimatrix ofhis day.A consistent yet complex theme of his polemical writing, as we have alreadywitnessed in the epistle, is the unique role—sometimes implicit, sometimesexplicit—played by the image of Islam as the foil to the current spiritualmalaise in the Jewish community. The epistle cited above makes a deliberatepoint of praising the unadulterated faith of Islam, with the not-so-subtleimplication (articulated before and after this passage) that not all Jews, inparticular those residing in Christian Europe, deserve such praise. For thediscerning reader, however, the epistle includes an additional, more subver-sive, theme at play in the relationship between Judaism and Islam. The passagebegins with the calculated observation that the monotheism of“the children ofIshmael”may be traced historically to the original influence of“the children ofIsrael,”thereby casting the dominant Islamic faith in a derivative position vis-à-vis its Jewish subjects. The purification of Jewish monotheism after themodel of Islam is thus depicted as a return to its origins, ironically mediatedby the faith of another.It is here that the deeper implications of Abraham Maimonides’campaignto reform Jewish faith and practice in his day emerges with greater clarity,albeit with a surprising twist. The undercurrent of reform can only be under-stood in light of the paradoxical interplay of Judaism and its host religion. Thepath to Jewish renewal for Abraham Maimonides and his circle, expressed as aconservative and straightforward appeal to tradition, was a circuitous one,with frequent stops through the spiritual byways of its most intimate rival.More so than at any other point in medieval Jewish history, under crescent orcross, Jewish tradition was explicitly and rather boldly recast through thelooking glass of the majority religion. In its fervent call to revive the innercore and ancient traditions of Judaism, the call to religious renewal byAbraham Maimonides and his pietist circle found itself encompassed andthoroughly entangled in the embrace of Islam.THE PRESENT STUDYThefirst half of the thirteenth century was one of the most tumultuous andcolorful chapters in the history of Egyptian Jewry in premodern times. It isalso one of the best represented by the papers of the Cairo Genizah prior to thedecline in Genizah documentation that began in the second half of thatcentury. For all of thisembarras de richesses, it remains at present amongthe most neglected periods of historical research.10The Ayyubid period of10For the periods of greater or lesser Genizah documentation, see Goitein,Med.

D. Goitein’s magisterialA Mediterranean Society, provides a wealthof information on daily life from nearly every facet of Jewish society, yet byvirtue of its sheer breadth moves back and forth through the classical Genizahperiod, from the tenth through the thirteenth centuries, without covering anysingle period in greater detail than any other. The present work does notattempt to address the larger desideratum of a comprehensive history ofJewish life in the Ayyubid period, focusing instead on the foremost socio-religious movement within the Egyptian Jewish community during thoseyears. In an earlier iteration of this work, I called attention to the tumultuousevents of the early thirteenth century, the combined result of natural catas-trophes in Egypt and the Levant and socio-economic strain within theEgyptian Jewish community proper.13This book provides a detailed portrait of the foremost spiritual movementof medieval Egyptian Jewry, known to its adherents as pietism (ḥasidut), theonly religious and intellectual movement among the Jews to take root andflourish in Egyptian soil. The rise of Egyptian Jewish pietism is unique in thehistory of Jewish spirituality, both for its broad (and almost immediate) appealacross the social spectrum—among scholars and non-scholars, rich and poor,men and women—and for its bold appeal to an external tradition as alegitimate model and source of inspiration. From its inception in the secondhalf of the twelfth century to its height in thefirst half of the thirteenth, the11See, for example, M. Cohen,“Maimonides’Egypt,”in Eric Ormsby, ed.,Moses Maimonidesand his Times(Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 1989), 21–34, andAndrew Ehrenkreutz,“Saladin’s Egypt and Maimonides,”inPerspectives on Maimonides: Philo-sophical and Historical Studies, ed. J. Kraemer (Oxford: The Littman Library of Jewish Civiliza-tion, 1991), 303–7.12The landmark study by Jacob Mann,The Jews in Egypt and in Palestine under the FātimidCaliphs, reissued with a new preface and reader’s guide by S.

Goitein (New York: KtavPublishing House, 1970), has largely been surpassed by the important contribution by MarinaRustow,Heresy and the Politics of Community: The Jews of the Fatimid Caliphate(Ithaca: CornellUniversity Press, 2008), although the two works do not cover identical terrain and Mann’s workremains a classic reference for the Fatimid period. Eliyahu Ashtor’s fundamental study of theJews of the Mamluk period,History of the Jews of Egypt and Syria under the Rule of the Mamluks(Hebrew), 3 vol. (Jerusalem: Mossad ha-Rav Kook, 1944–70), has thus far not been matchedby any subsequent work.13The coincidence of war, famine, and natural disasters, coupled with the influx of waves ofByzantine and French Jews onto Egypt’s shores, and thefinancial strain it imposed on an alreadybeleaguered population, was discussed in my“Between Politics and Piety: Abraham Maimonidesand his Times,”Dissertation, Harvard University, 2009, 34–97.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiIntroduction5"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"movement was perceived by opponents and adherents alike as indebted to thespiritual matrix of Islamic mysticism, leading some modern scholars to de-scribe Egyptian Jewish pietism as“Jewish-Sufism,”whether on account of itsresemblance to Sufism or its implicit competition with it.14The book is subdivided into three parts, each exploring a different facet ofthe ramified movement at its height in thefirst half of the thirteenth century.Thefirst part addresses fundamental questions of origins, scope, and impact,arguing for a gradual shift in both the character and content of the movementfrom the late twelfth to the early thirteenth century. Chapter one explores thehistorical background and social foundations of the pietist movement, itsimpact on communal and family life, and the internal Jewish controversies itprovoked. Critics of the pietists and their innovations to Jewish devotional lifewere quick to respond, notwithstanding the prominence of the movement’schief proponent, Abraham Maimonides, in his capacity as head of EgyptianJewry. Chapter two, in turn, delves into the details of pietist practice, both asprivate devotion and collective praxis, concentrated within circles of disciple-ship and formal conventicles under the guidance of spiritual masters.If Sufism served as a spiritual template for the nascent pietist movement,other aspects of Islamic religious life were key to the broader reform of Jewishdevotional practice—the subject of Part three of this work. In addition to thecontroversial liturgical reforms instituted by Abraham Maimonides in syn-agogues throughout Egypt, the Nagid was the most outspoken proponent ofthe revitalization of Jewish worship, including a considerable overhaul ofprevailing practice.15Chapter three takes up the theme of prayer and the14On the language of“Jewish-Sufism,”see Chapter one, p. 46, n. 13.

I shall return to a number of Cohen’s interpretations, including his denial of Sufiinfluence,on several occasions throughout this book.15Abraham Maimonides’liturgical reforms (including the removal of the synagogue recita-tion of the morning blessings, the cessation of poetic changes to established prayers, and hiseffective crippling of the Palestinian liturgical rite), like his devotional reforms, were concen-trated on synagogue life, yet the two should not be confused as identical, or even similar. Theliturgical reforms were imposed by Abraham in his capacity as head of the Jews, whereas thedevotional reforms were recommended to the broader community but were only practiced in hisown pietist circle. On these reforms, see the articles by M. A. Friedman,“Opposition toPalestinian Prayer and Prayer Rites in Responsa from the Genizah (from the Responsa ofR.

The proposed changes—including prostration and kneeling, as well as other rituals considered authen-tic and beneficial, such as the ritual washing of the feet before worship and thearrangement of worshipers in orderly rows—are the subject of Chapter four.Each of the devotional forms advocated by Abraham and his associates, whilefound in one form or another in the classical Jewish sources, was stronglyinfluenced not by Sufism in particular but by more general Islamic practice.The promotion of reform required an extensive reinterpretation of Jewishtradition in support of the proposed rites and a simultaneous argument for theselective appropriation of Islamic praxis, while raising a defense against thosewho did not hesitate to charge the pietists with outright imitation of gentilepractice.At the heart of the effort to revitalize Jewish worship was the belief that thespiritual awakening initiated by these reforms constituted a vital step towardthe rehabilitation of Israel in exile and the arrival of the messianic era.According to Abraham’s overall vision, the Jewish pietists were expected toserve as the spiritual vanguard of this transformation and as models ofreligious devotion for the people as a whole. Even more significant was thecontention expressed by a number of prominent leaders that the pietist pathaimed at nothing less than the revival of prophecy among the people inanticipation of the advent of the messianic redemption. Chapterfive addressesthe question and significance of prophetic attainment among the pietists, withits synthesis of philosophical and mystical traditions in search of a language ofultimate human attainment. Chapter six turns to the pietist conception ofprophetic attainment within the framework of sacred history. Biblical proph-ecy was idealized not as a relic of the past, but as a tradition of propheticdiscipleship, severed over the course of the exile and in vital need of restor-ation. In this conception, the revival of the prophetic path in the community ofIsrael serves as the harbinger of the long-awaited redemption of Israel, and,with it, the onset of the messianic era.Viewed in the context of the tumultuous events of the early thirteenthcentury, it is tempting to interpret the turn to mystical piety and messianicexpectation among segments of Egyptian Jewry as the result of the economicdistress and social volatility of the period. Yet to do so would be to reduce amovement of intellectual and spiritual depth (and the polemical activity itspawned) toflights of mystical rapture as a means to escape the upheavals ofthe day. I would suggest that the socio-economic interpretation is problematicfor at least two reasons. First and foremost, the bold effort to integrate keyelements of Islamic practice into the substructure of Jewish piety involvedanything but a passive retreat from social engagement. Pietist leaders did noteschew thefierce reaction of the community, but took a polemical approachand aggressively appealed to their coreligionists to embrace the new reforms.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiIntroduction7"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Equally significant is the fact that the most outspoken proponent and publicface of Egyptian pietism, Abraham b. Moses Maimonides (1186–1237),16served as official head and chief religious authority of Egyptian Jewry, respon-sible for overseeing and directing the life of the community in its myriaddetails. The life and career of the head of the Jews—known to the Muslimauthorities asra’īs al-yahūdand to his constituents simply asal-ra’īsoral-rayyis—was anything but a retreat from communal engagement.17As justnoted, Abraham’s protean activity for religious reform was designed to spir-itually rehabilitate the Jewish people from its state of cultural decline in exile.The turn inward was at the same time a turn outward, in which mysticism andmessianism constituted not an escape from society but a total regeneration ofcommunal life.During thefirst three decades of the thirteenth century, spanning nearlyhis entire adult life, Abraham served as the administrative and religiousfigurehead of Egyptian Jewry, a position hefilled not long after the deathof his father in 1204. Both in his direction of the religious life of hisflock andin his oversight of communal affairs and management of the crises confront-ing his generation, Abraham was directly engaged in virtually every level ofdaily administration. As such, while this book is not a biography of theNagid, Abraham’s singular role in every aspect of communal life for threedecades, including the social and religious transformations that would cometo define the period, make his story (and his writings) an integral part of thehistory of his generation. It is to the story of this critical and somewhatenigmaticfigure, and his reception or reinvention in modern scholarship,that we now turn.16Abraham is often referred to by scholars as Abraham Maimonides or Abraham Maimuni,suggesting that these were not patronymics but family names. Although this is clearly erroneous,it has become quite standard to refer to Abraham with the patronymic of his father and I do notdepart from this practice in this book. In addition, I refer to the Nagid’s elder pietist colleague,Abraham“the Pious”(he-ḥasid) ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘(d.c.1221), not as Abraham or Abraham thePious alone but either by his full name or simply as ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘, in order to avoid confusionwith the Nagid, who was also occasionally known as Abraham“the pious.”See ENA 2379.1v,ll. 9–10, published by A.

For his sake people prayed and fasted. / They merited tosee his birth...and to witness his [attainment of] wisdom and his wedding day. In him they havefound contentment.”Based on this poem, Fenton suggested that“Maimonides...had fasted andprayed”to sire a child. According to the alternative reading of the poem offered here, theverses attest that Maimonides’family or others in the community prayed and fasted“for hissake”(le-ragelo [pilel]u ve-ṣamu), according to Allony’s reading. This use ofle-regelmay be basedon Gen. 30:30. For Fenton’s reading, see his“Maimonides—Father and Son: Continuity andChange,”inTraditions of Maimonideanism, ed. C. Fraenkel. (Leiden: Brill, 2009), 104, n. 1.Goitein suggested that Abraham’s surname, Abū’l-Munā’, meaning roughly“object of mydesire,”was given him by his father as an expression of gratitude after fathering a child (orson) after many years of waiting. See Goitein,Med. Soc., V:640, n. 284.20There has been considerable speculation as to the existence of a possible daughter ofMaimonides who died young. In a letter to his disciple, Joseph b. Judah, Maimonides wrote,“I have already informed you of the passing of the little daughter. May God, may He be exalted,make her death an atonement!”SeeIggerot ha-Rambam: Ḥalifat ha-Mikhtavim‘im R. Yosef b.Yehudah, ed. D. H. Baneth (Jerusalem: The Magnes Press, 1985), 93–4. Following Geiger andSteinschneider, Baneth was of the opinion that the“little daughter”in question was notMaimonides’own but that of his brother, an interpretation shared by Mordechai Friedman.SeeIggerot ha-Rambam, ed. Baneth, 91, and S. Goitein,“R. Ḥananel the Chief Judge, Son ofSamuel ha-Nadiv, Brother-in-Law of Maimonides”(Hebrew),Tarbiz50 (1981), 376 and 394.This suggestion is supported by the fact that Maimonides took responsibility for his brother’syoung daughter after the former’s death at sea. SeeIggerot ha-Rambam, ed. Y. Shailat (Jerusalem:Shailat Publishing, 1995), I:229.

Asfor the possibility of another, younger, son of Maimonides, there is a legendary report of a son,David, born to Maimonides in his later years and named after his late brother. According to thissingular account, the sage was preferential to David, while his wife favored Abraham. SeeA. Neubauer,“Documents inédits,”REJ4 (1882), 179.

Though one cannot rule out the possibility that a second son wasborn to Maimonides late in life as the legendary report has it (“the son of his old age”), it is morelikely that the letter writer in question either did not know the number of Maimonides’childrenor included one or more unknown daughters in the expressionḥamudekha, meaning, in thatcase,“your children.”On the origin of this legend, see the different suggestions by Freimann,“The Genealogy of the Maimonidean Family,”24, and M.

There are suggestions that Maimoni-des may have groomed him from an early age in the running of communalaffairs, although the evidence, in my view, suggests otherwise.26Even whencommunal honorifics are applied to Abraham as a young man, they must betaken as little more than epistolary etiquette.27Other details of Abraham’s24The medieval Hebrew translation of the original Judaeo-Arabic letter (not extant) isdifficult to render and may have referred to the patriarch Abraham rather than God, althoughthis does not resolve all of the difficulties.25Iggerot ha-Rambam, ed. Baneth, 96. Both Baneth and Shailat speculated that the referenceto the difficult“state of the world”may have been an allusion to the trials of the early years of thethirteenth century, around the same time as Se‘adiah b. Berakhot’s letter, cited on p. 10. SeeIggerot ha-Rambam, ed. Baneth, 95, andIggerot ha-Rambam, ed. Shailat, 423. I agree that theletter could not have belonged to that sent in 1191, with which it has been traditionally grouped,if only because that would have made Abraham no more than 6 years old when he so impressedhis father. Both Fenton and Friedman are inclined to accept the traditional dating. See P. Fenton,“Abraham Maimonides (1186–1237): Founding a Mystical Dynasty,”inJewish Mystical Leadersand Leadership in the 13th Century, ed. M. Idel and M. Ostow (New Jersey: Jason Aronson Inc.,1998), 131, and Fenton,“Maimonides—Father and Son,”104; and see n. 3; and Friedman,“TwoMaimonidean Documents,”209, n. 82.26In an analysis of a Genizah letter describing an encounter with Maimonides and his son,tentatively dated to the late 1190s, Fenton suggested that Abraham’s attendance at the meetingis an indication that he was being groomed to learn“the intricacies of communal affairs.”SeeP. Fenton,“A Meeting with Maimonides,”BSOAS45 (1982), 2–4; cf. also P. Fenton,“Abrahamben Moses ben Maimon,”inEncyclopaedia Judaica, ed. M. Berenbaum and F. Skolnik, 2nd ed.(Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007), I: 304–5, and“Maimonides—Father and Son,”104.As I understand the letter, TS 8 J 14.18, Abraham’s presence need not be surprising, given thatthe meeting took place in his home. Abraham’s role in the meeting was to entertain themessenger’s young child, which he appears to have done to his father’s great delight. See theabove fragment,verso, ll. 6–17. In spite of the fact that the letter may have been delivered froma community leader (nasi) in Moṣul, as Fenton suggested (“A Meeting with Maimonides,”2),there is no indication that the meeting was a matter of communal business. It should also berecalled that Abraham was 10 years old at the time or possibly a bit older. See also Ben-Sasson’shesitations in his essay,“Maimonides in the House of Maimonides—Between Conservatismand Reform”(Hebrew), inHa-Rambam: Shamranūt, Meqoriyut, Mahapekhanut, ed.

Though there are Genizah sources to support this use ofsar, such as those cited byMann,Jews in Egypt, I: 260, it is worth recalling that similar titles were at times purely formulaic.Such was no doubt the case when applied to Abraham’s own sons, David and Obadiah, who wereadorned with the honorificha-sarim ha-adirimin 1230, when they were no more than 8 and2 years old respectively.

Abraham, it may be recalled, was also called“rabbi”in the account of the meeting with Maimonides described above, when he was perhaps asyoung as 10. See TS 8 J 14.18,recto, l. 16, andverso, ll. 7, 14, published by Fenton,“A Meetingwith Maimonides,”4. While not following Eppenstein’s hypothesis, Friedman has more recentlyconjectured as to whether Abraham wasfirst assigned the post of head of the Jews by the Muslimauthorities, and only later accepted as Nagid by the community, which would explain the earliertitles ofsarand the like before the title Nagid was applied to him. Friedman acknowledged thatthis would be counter to the usual sequence of appointment. See M. A.

There is also a strong suggestion that Maimonides trained a nephew in medicine, on whichsee TS 16.291 and n. 21 above. That Maimonides trained Abraham in medicine has at times beentaken for granted, although direct evidence is lacking. SeeSefer Birkat Avraham, ed. Goldberg,intro., no. 2. It is evident that Abraham also possessed at least rudimentary training in astron-omy, based on his remarks inMH, 87.31Abraham recalled asking his father a question on the seventh introduction to the secondpart of theGuide, which proved too difficult to answer immediately. Unfortunately, his fathernever managed to give him an answer before he died. SeeTeshuvot, 141, no. 96.

Intricate questions of talmudic exegesis werebrought before him in 1208 from a well-known French judge in Alexandria,Meir b. Barukh, which the 22-year-oldra’īsanswered with the full corpus oftalmudic, geonic, Iberian, and Maimonidean writings at hisfingertips.33In aheated halakhic exchange dating to the same year, Abraham faced down thechallenges of an elder scholar with the biting retort that such trifles were notworth his time and an implicit rebuke for the latter’s lack of propriety.34Numerous queries were sent in the years that followed, including a series ofquestions from a scholar or group of scholars in Yemen in 1216, who began aquerulous correspondence with him on various controversial customs andother matters.35According to Judah al-Ḥarizi (d. 1225), who visited Fustataround 1218, Abraham proved a worthy heir to his father’s legacy, being“young in years but great in knowledge, a young man who makes fools outof the wise.”36While Abraham’s prestige as a rabbinic scholar may have facilitated hissudden transition to communal leadership on his father’s death, his appoint-ment was no doubt influenced by the unique reverence held for his late father,known throughout Egypt as“the great sage in Israel,”37and perhaps even due33See Langermann,“Sayings and Commentaries of Maimonides,”1–12, nos. 1–3, and see 1,n. 2, for the likely identification of this Me’ir as Me’ir b.

If you did review it carefully, [your teachers] have not explained itto you clearly.”See SeferBirkat Avraham, ed. Goldberg, 81, no. 47.

The reason for not attending was concernover violating a ban, originally promulgated in 1170, prohibiting the invoca-tion of the chief communal authority, known as thereshut, in the syn-agogues.44According to Goitein, the appeal to the ban of 1170 reflectedcommunal protest over Abraham’s appointment, at the age of 19, as head ofthe community.45It is striking, however, that the document in question does not allude to asingle critique of Abraham or of his selection by members of the community.The appeal was made not against the appointment itself but against theinvocation of thereshut, which appears to have been reintroduced inthe synagogues following the appointment, prompting a reaffirmation of thedecree instituted thirty years earlier under the guidance of Abraham’s father.Rather than renounce their new leader, members of the community foundthemselves“unable to listen to thereshutfor thera’īson account of the oldordinance and the effectiveness of the ban.”46There is no reason to assume, onthe basis of this document, that the authority of the new leader was ever castinto doubt. When communal officials conceded to the public concerns byremoving thereshutfrom the synagogues, a separate decree was issuedprohibiting private worship services“with the exception of the residence of41On the liturgical controversies initiated by Abraham, see above, p. 6, n. 15.42The documents in question are TS Arabic Box 51.111, published by Goitein,“NewDocuments,”717, and TS 16.187, also published by Goitein,“Renewal of the Controversy,”52.Thefirst document, dated by Goitein to the reign of Malik al-‘Ādil (d. 1218), has been tentativelydated by Friedman closer to the end of Abraham’s career,c.1235, although he did not provide animmediate explanation. See Friedman,“Controversy for the Sake of Heaven,”276.43It should be recalled that Islamic law did not permit the construction of new synagogues orchurches after the advent of Islam. As a result, new prayer services were typically organized ininformal settings, often in an individual home or local study hall. This was the case withMaimonides himself, as Abraham attested in hisCompendium. See Abraham’s remarks inSM,180. See alsoSM, 215, where Abraham described the protocol for priests ascending to thepodium“when there is nohekhalordukhanin the place of worship, since communal prayermay be conducted other than in a synagogue, such as...in study halls and the like.”Note alsoTeshuvot, 64, no. 62:“given that they [pray] in their own homes”(ho’il u-ve-vatehem hen‘osin).44For the ban of 1170, seeTeshuvot ha-Rambam, ed.

Abraham’s opponents sought to issue a complaintto the Sultan, al-Malik al-‘Ādil (r. 1200–18), regarding his controversialreform of the Palestinian liturgical rite, of which members of the ha-Levifamily were leading advocates. The desperate efforts of this faction to under-mine thera’īsby appealing to the Sultan had everything to do with salvagingthe venerable Palestinian rite from its detractors and, on the surface, betraysno trace of political rivalry. Goitein may indeed be right that the ha-Levifamily hoped to gain politically from Abraham’s expected fall from grace, butthe document in question is silent on the matter.48Whatever hidden motiveslay behind the scandal, the opposition was primarily motivated by the threatposed to the survival of their congregation in Egypt rather than by overtpolitical rivalry.49Much has been made of the fact that Abraham was not known by the title ofNagid during his early years in office. According to Goitein, the title was notconsistently applied to him until late 1213 or early 1214.50While it is true thatthe title was not regularly applied before this period, it was used in Fustat as anhonorific of thera’īsas early as 1209.51Yet, as Goitein himself recognized, thetitle of Nagid was not the preferred designation for the head of the Jews untilthe latter part of Abraham’s career, after which it became common among hisdescendants.52There are no clear grounds to assume that the application ofthe title in 1213 marked an end to political discontent, as the title was not thesole, or even primary, honorific associated with the office at this point in47TS 16.187, ll. 19–20.48For Goitein’s theory, see“New Documents,”709–11.49It should be noted that the prayer invoked in favor of contested leaders, known fromGenizah letters, (“May God turn the hearts of all Israel to you”) is found in the case of Abraham’sson, David, but not of Abraham himself. See Goitein,“Title and Office of the Nagid,”103.50See Goitein,“Title and Office of the Nagid,”96, n. 8.51Gaster published a Genizah fragment dating to“the month of Mar[ḥeshvan] of the year1520 [ED = 1209CE] in Fustat, Miṣrayim, on the Nile...[upon the authority of] our lord andprince (va-adonenu negidenu)...”See M. Gaster,“Geniza-Fragmente,”inGedenkbuch zurErinnerung an David Kaufmann, ed. M. Brann and F. Rosenthal (Breslau: Schles. VerlagsAnstalt, 1900), 236.

Samuel, who served for a period as chiefjudge in Fustat.56This may have served as a parallel Hebrew term to theArabicra’īsorrayyis, and may have been applied with the sameflexibility asthe latter terms during the early years of the thirteenth century.57Court Duties and Communal GovernanceAbraham’s rise to communal prominence was likewise due to his inheritedposition as court physician to the Sultan,58a job that was historically associ-ated with communal headship due to its potential for intercession on behalf ofEgyptian Jewry.59It is for their role as intercessors that communal leaders and53Friedman, as already noted, proposed that the adoption of this title marked the cessation offormal opposition in the community.54The conflation of the two terms appears in Goitein’s translation of TS 16.187, ll. 8 and 13,where he renders“ra’īs”as“Nagid.”See Goitein,“Renewal of the Controversy,”52–3.55See above, pp. 15–16.56See MS Frankfurt a. M., published by J. Horovitz,“Ein arabischer Brief an R. Chananel,”ZHB4 (1900), 155–6, reproduced by Goitein,“R. Ḥananel the Chief Judge,”379–80. Accordingto Friedman, Ḥananel may have served as Nagid for a time, although this assumes that the titlehad an exclusive application in Egyptian society—an assumption that ought to be revisited.

Whennot referring to Abraham Maimonides by name, I will designate him by the title of Nagid,ra’īs,or head of Egyptian Jewry.58In addition to his father, who became court physician in al-Afḍal’s court in the winterof 1198–9, Maimonides’brother-in-law, Abū’l-Ma‘ālī, was al-Afḍal’s mother’s personal scribe,as we learn from al-Qiftī’s report. SeeIbn al-Qifṭī’sTa’rīkal-Ḥukamā’, ed. Lippert (Leipzig:Dieterich’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1903), 318.59It was quite common for heads of the Jews to be court physicians.

Gottheil,“An Eleventh-century Documentconcerning a Cairo Synagogue,”JQR, o.s., 19 (1907), 498, and Goitein,“The Medical Profession,”178–81.

Writing to Daniel ha-Bavli in the summer of1211, Abraham referred to his work as court physician as an official engage-ment from which he could not hope to extricate himself on account of hisresponsibilities as head of the Jews:“My sins have gotten me stuck working inthe service of the gentiles (khidmat al-goyim) and I am not a free man toabsolve or extricate myself from it.

Can a man walk upon coals and his feet not be singed?”(Prov. 6:27–28)...Anyone who is pursuing [the path of] asceticism must avoida leadership position as far as possible and extricate oneself from it if oneis already involved in it, unless doing so would have a deleterious effect onreligious life.74Yet for all his inner ambivalence, Abraham thrust himself into the torrent ofcommunal governance well beyond the standard set by his predecessors.75Given the high stakes of his vision for communal life and the spiritual perilposed by inaction, the newra’īsdid not wait long before embarking on hiscontroversial policy of reform.76It is reasonable to assume that the urgencyof Abraham’s early liturgical reforms was driven not only by a zealous pursuitof“controversy for the sake of heaven,”which provided him with a measureof justification for his unpopular policies, but also by his own self-perceptionas the guardian and champion of the Maimonidean legacy.77In a uniquecombination of public roles, Abraham functioned as chief administratorand overseer of all communal posts throughout the country, appointingjudges and welfare workers and arbitrating disputes, while simultaneouslyserving as the foremost religious authority in matters of jurisprudence andsynagogue life.73SeePerush, 231 (Ex. 4:13) and also 299 (Ex. 18:19–20).74HW, II:260, l. 17 to 262, l. 3, and ll. 12–15, and seeSefer ha-maspik, 180.

Recovering a Lost Legacy: Between Historyand HistoriographyScholars have not failed to note, with some degree of lament, that Abraham’slegacy was already eclipsed within his own lifetime by the imposing shadowcast by his renowned father.83There are indications that this was the case evenwithin Abraham’s inner circle, among those inclined toward pietism. Evenamong Abraham’s colleagues and immediate successors who most ferventlyadvanced the pietist movement in Egypt, Maimonides and hisoeuvrecon-tinued to exert a disproportionate influence. An interesting case in point isthat of Abraham’s younger son, Obadiah, whose pietist work on the attain-ment of mystical communion, known asTreatise of the Pool, includes morereferences to the works of his grandfather than to those of his father, when thelatter clearly provided the immediate inspiration for the work at hand.84Perhaps even more telling is the way in which Abraham’s memory was lateralmost entirely eclipsed in comparison with his father, as when Obadiah wascited by a later pietist author as“our master, Obadiah, grandson of our master[Maimonides]”rather than as son of Abraham.85Even if not for his father, Abraham’s impact outside of Egypt was com-promised by other factors. The potential impact of Abraham’s magnum opus,Kifāyat al-‘ābidīn,orThe Compendium for the Servants of God(hereafter:Compendium), may have been blunted already during his lifetime by beingdistributed piecemeal rather than as a self-contained work.86Another consid-eration is that of the linguistic discrepancy. As earlier classics of Judaeo-Arabicliterature were being translated into Hebrew in thirteenth-century Provence,Abraham’s work was never once honored with a translation, cutting off any83See R. Margaliot,Rabbenu Avraham ben ha-Rambam: Milḥamot ha-Shem(Jerusalem:Mossad ha-Rav Kook, 1953), 11, and, more recently, Fenton,“Abraham Maimonides,”154:“Had Abraham’s works not been overshadowed by those of his illustrious progenitor, they wouldcertainly have deeply marked the course of Jewish spiritual history...Were it not for having hadso great a father, it would surely have been said of the son:‘From Abraham to Abraham, therewas no other Abraham.’”See also the remarks by A. Grossman,“Woman and Family in theThought of Abraham Maimonides”(Hebrew),Dine Yisra’el26–7 (1999–2000), 121–2. For thisexpression (“From Abraham to Abraham...”), seeBirkat Avraham, ed.

Fenton,“The Literary Legacy ofDavid ben Joshua, Last of the Maimonidean Něgīdim,”JQR75 (1984), 3.86In a Hebrew letter addressed to an unknown admirer outside of Egypt, Abraham alludes tothe way in which his work was distributed in separate sections in distant lands.

Unlike Maimonides, who wrote in a universalist vein with littlereference to local context or controversy, Abraham devoted considerablespace to internal Egyptian Jewish disputes and to polemical jousts with hisopponents, none of which would have been particularly relevant, if evenintelligible, to readers outside the Egyptian community. For all these reasons,Abraham’s works were only sporadically cited in theological and legal writingsup to the sixteenth century, and became increasingly marginal to the intellec-tual and spiritual life of late medieval Jewry.8987It is ironic that Abraham’s choice to write theCompendiumin Arabic was likely due to hiswish for the wide dissemination and reach of his work, as already noted by Friedman,Maimonides,55, and n. 21. It is noteworthy that Abraham was not an exception in his lack of a translation.While translation activity continued as a dynastic tradition among Provençal Jews into thefourteenth century, no translation was made of any Judaeo-Arabic author after Moses Maimoni-des. This has much to do with the relative lack of Jewish migration from Islamic to Christianrealms after the Almohad period, limiting the access of European Jews to literary developments inJudaeo-Arabic. For an overview of the Provençal tradition of Hebrew translation, see Robinson,“The Ibn Tibbon Family: A Dynasty of Translators in Medieval Provence,”inBe’erot Yitzhak:Studies in Memory of Isadore Twersky, ed.

A section of Abraham’sCompendiumon rabbinic homilies,Ma’amar‘al odotderashot ḥazal(Epistle concerning Rabbinic Homilies), has often been considered a separatetreatise and was one of the few sections of the work to be translated into Hebrew, although itremains unclear when the anonymous translation was produced. It was published by SamuelGoldberg in the journalKerem Ḥemedin 1836 and has been reprinted a number of times.88While the rapid rise of Qabbalah may have contributed, in its own way, to the displacementof the Judaeo-Arabic pietist tradition, there can be no doubt as to the impact of Sufi, and perhapseven“Jewish-Sufi”ideas and ideals on Qabbalistic praxis in the thirteenth century and beyond.See the studies of Fenton,“La‘Hitbōdedūt’chez les premiers Qabbalistes en Orient et chez lesSoufis,”inPrière, mystique et judaïsme, ed.

G. Cohen’s analysis in his two-part study,“Soteriologyof R. Abraham Maimuni”(1967), while offering many valuable insights into Abraham’s thought,contains a number of tendentious interpretations that must now be rethought in light of laterscholarship. Perhaps the most problematic interpretation offered by Cohen was his insistence onthe primarily internal Jewish roots of Abraham’s pietism (viz. Pirqe Avot) over Sufiinfluence,and his claim that Abraham’s mystical doctrine was intended for public effect rather thangenuine belief (p. 54:“If he could not lick’em, he would seem to join’em.”).

In addition to his unique personality, his life and teaching conveyso harmonious an impression because they were in conformity with the bestand most congenial elements in the contemporary surrounding civilization, andat the same time represented the most perfect realization of the religion of hisforefathers.102Goitein’saffinity for Abraham was thus emblematic of his underlying enthu-siasm for a Judaeo-Islamic cultural nexus, a motivating historical outlook thatwould come to define his scholarly career.103From his graduate training inBerlin in the early 1920s to his anthropological work with Yemenite Jewry inthe 1930s, Goitein felt powerfully drawn to the history of Judaeo-Islamicculture, which he endearingly and even wistfully referred to as“the worldof the east.”104In an article written in 1949, anticipating many of the themesof his later work, Goitein wrote passionately of what he called the culturaland religious symbiosis—adopting a biological term implying intertwineddestinies—of the Jewish and Islamic traditions, suggesting that the culturalclimate of Islam was more congenial to traditional Jewish life than that ofmodern western civilization.105Goitein again emphasized the unique affinityof Judaism and Islam in his pioneering survey,Jews and Arabs: Their Contactsthrough the Ages,first published in 1955, in which he distinguished medievalJudaeo-Islamic symbiosis from all other examples of cultural integration inJewish history, whether before or after.Modern Western civilization, like the ancient civilization of the Greeks, is essen-tially at variance with the religious culture of the Jewish people.

From the vantage point of cultural influence and appropri-ation, Goitein espoused a diachronic approach to Jewish–Muslim symbiosis,suggesting that Judaism initially exerted a definitive influence on the newreligion, which in turn, after becoming the dominant cultural and politicalforce from the western Mediterranean to the fertile crescent and beyond,exercised its own influence on Jewish society in its midst.108But beyond the question of appropriation and acculturation that has longexercised historians, Goitein suggested an additional, more intimate form ofsymbiosis. Jews and Muslims in the medieval Arab world shared, in Goitein’sview, an intertwined social and legal system and a parallel religious sensibility,permitting a mutual understanding and even genuine respect among the moreenlightened scholars of the period.109Goitein devoted much of his career toinvestigating the daily features of this Mediterranean society, only rarelyturning his attention to intellectual or spiritual biographies of individualfigures who best exemplify this social and religious interplay.

For Goitein, asfor a number of his successors, the term captured an unparalleled measureof cultural cooperation as well as religious compatibility between medievalJudaism and Islam.111As Goitein strongly suggested inJews and Arabs, theunique synergy of the two communities was due less to temporary conditionson the ground than to the essential congeniality of their religious traditions,producing in time“a close and fructuous symbiosis”that had no true parallelin Jewish history.112The notable parallels between the Jewish and Islamictraditions—already observed and discussed by medieval Jewish authors—haveelicited renewed inquiry of late among historians, and certainly warrantfurther investigation.113Yet Goitein’s assertion as to the essential compatibility111For an early example of the adoption of this term, see G. Vajda’s language of“unesymbiose positive,”in his“Mystique juive et mystique musulmane,”Les nouveaux cahiers2(1966), 37–8. For a more recent use, see Maimon,“The Limits of the Encounter betweenRabbinic Judaism and Islamic Mysticism,”70 (part II):“It is possible to describe the interreli-gious encounter as symbiotic—two partners benefitting from the partnership yet battling forsupremacy within it.”Maimon’s approach, however, is not tied to this concept, but viewed thepietist encounter with Islam as the product of a posture of spiritual openness, stemming“from agenuine inquiry into the points of truth in the world of the‘other’,”suggesting that this openposture can and should serve as a model for intercultural and interreligious dialogue today.

Inhis review of scholarship indebted to the notion of“creative symbiosis,”followed by a systematic treatment of the subject in his monograph on theJews of early Islam, Wasserstrom sought to deconstruct the meaning ofsymbiosis and whether it may yet be salvaged by contemporary historians.115In consideration of the power imbalance between the two communities (andits manifold implications) from the earliest period of their coexistence intomodern times, Wasserstrom rejected the literal conception of symbiosis asmutual benefit, and likewise dismissed the projection of binary influence asoverly simplistic. Yet Wasserstrom was reluctant to abandon the term“sym-biosis”altogether, offering a subtler alternative to the current usage.“Symbi-osis,”he wrote,“as a thinly happy and monovalently positive benefit, did nothappen. Its complexity is reduced tomerebenefit only by a tendentiousdilution. It does suggest, however, a view of real relations sufficiently capaciousto include the means by which harm helps.”116Even when each entity viewsthe other as fundamentally illegitimate and detrimental to its own self-conception, Wasserstrom suggests, the very means of engagement and nego-tiation with one’s rival demonstrates a level of mutual accommodation to therealities of coexistence, present in various guises in every age of Jewish–Muslim relations.Jew, then, served as an essential and necessary catalyst in the self-definitionof Islam; andMuslim, likewise, operated in synergy with a Jewish effort atMaimonides: Al-Aḥkām al-Kamsah”(Hebrew).Te‘udah10 (1996), 225–44, and G.

The other—whether as myth or as history, image or enemy,precursor or opponent—had its uses. The uses of the other, in the end, produceda kind of symbiotic interdefinition.117In this novel application of the term, symbiosis ceases to correspond toconcrete instances of social integration or cultural cross-pollination, but tothe grey area of what Wasserstrom calls“modes of accommodation”and ofsocial and literary constructs he describes as“imaginary worldmaking.”118Inthis view, the very accommodation to the other and the traces of one traditionon the symbolism and psyche of the other constitutes a form of symbioticconnection—indeed, for Wasserstrom, theprimaryform of such connectionpresent through the centuries. Such a working definition may provide suffi-cient latitude to warrant the continued use of the term, but only once ithas been denuded of the primary connotation originally applied by Goitein.For Goitein, symbiosis wasfirst and foremost a characteristic of mutuallybeneficial engagement, from economic association to intellectual cooperation.Goitein described this as an outgrowth of the intertwined culture of Mediter-ranean society—what he called“the physical and educational symbiosis be-tween Muslims and Jews”—noting that the cultural cohesion and economicenterprise shared by both communities was at the same time a product andsymbol of their very physical proximity to one another.119In spite of their different conceptions of symbiosis, Goitein and Wasser-strom both viewed the encounter of Judaism and Sufism in thirteenth-centuryEgypt as the epitome of religious tolerance and of positive Jewish–Islamicsymbiosis.120Goitein, as already noted, considered Abraham’s synthesis of117Wasserstrom,Between Muslim and Jew, 11.118See Wasserstrom,Between Muslim and Jew,10–12 and 207–10.119See Goitein,Med. Soc., V:9 and II:289–99. Goitein’s emphasis on the dual factors ofproximity and culture has been reformulated recently by Miriam Goldstein as the“combinationof diachronic kinship and synchronic contiguity.”See her introduction to D. Friedenreich andM. Goldstein, ed.,Beyond Religious Borders: Interaction and Intellectual Exchange in the Medi-eval Islamic World(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012), 2. On the economicculture of the new multifaith bourgeoisie, see S. D. Goitein,“The Rise of the Near-EasternBourgeoisie in Early Islamic Times,”CHM3 (1956–7), 583–604. Goitein stressed that Jews,Christians, and Muslims tended not only to live in the same neighborhoods, but even in the samehousing or apartment complexes. See Goitein,Med. Soc., II:289–91. There are, nevertheless, acouple of mitigating factors when considering the physical integration of the religious commu-nities. One is the presence of specifically Jewish quarters in some towns and cities in Egypt, notedby Goitein. The relevant documents include TS 12.166,recto,l.7(bi-ḥaṭṭḥārat al-yahūd),mentioned by Ashtor,“Number of the Jews”(first part), 18, no. 22, and Goitein,Med.

The second mitigating factor is the presence of a Jewishban on selling property directly to Muslims, a policy that appears to have been largely disre-garded in practice. SeeTeshuvot ha-Rambam, ed. Blau, e.g. I:10, no. 7, and 70, no. 44, and II:672,no. 394.120Lazarus-Yafeh also took Abraham Maimonides and the Egyptian pietist movementas the crowning example of what she boldly called“a common Jewish-Muslim culture.”OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi32Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Islamic and Jewish traditions to be“the perfect realization of the religion of hisforefathers”and the model of inter-confessional exchange unique to Mediter-ranean society, declaring that Abraham“stood for everything regarded aspraiseworthy in the society described in this book.”121Wasserstrom, too,found in“the joint mystical tradition of Jewish Sufism”the most strikingexpression of the ecumenical synergy of the age.122In this view, Jewish-Sufipietism, together with the intellectual partnership of scientists and philo-sophers, marked the apex of religious symbiosis in the late medieval period.123This view, Wasserstrom asserts, constitutes the scholarly consensus and theineluctable conclusion of anyone acquainted with thefield of Jewish-Sufism.Herein lies the paradox of Egyptian pietism for the history of Jewish-Islamicrelations. By all estimations, the encounter of Judaism and Sufism is the moststriking manifestation of the spiritual cross-pollination of the two religions.Nothing in the rich history of these two communities even resembles theconscious and forthright integration of Islamic religiosity exhibited by theJewish pietist movement. Yet it raises important questions of reciprocityimplicit in any conception of symbiosis. The bold synthesis and positivelyopen stance to one’s chief spiritual rival witnessed in pietist writings from theperiod under consideration is not paralleled in Islamic sources. Equally vexingis the question of documentation. Other examples of Jewish–Muslim culturalexchange during the medieval period—whether in the form of philosophicalspeculation, scientific inquiry, or literary expression—are known from acombination of Islamic and Jewish sources (albeit disproportionately Jewish)that provide information on these individuals, and occasionally on theirecumenical gatherings. By contrast, Egyptian pietism, the Jewish movementexhibiting the greatest measure of openness to Islamic religious practice, asopposed to merely secular Arabic culture, is not granted a single mention inthe Islamic writings of the time. The information we do possess on themovement and its extensive literature comes exclusively from the Jewishsphere, primarily in the form of literary fragments and private documentsemanating from the Cairo Genizah.See Lazarus-Yafeh,“Judeo-Arabic Culture,”108:“Judeo-Arabic culture should not, therefore, betreated as a Jewish culture which merely expressed itself in Arabic, but as a common Jewish-Muslim culture cultivated by Jews who lived under the rule of Islam, spoke Arabic, and weredeeply influenced not only by some spheres of Islamic civilization, such as Muslim philosophy,but by Islam as a religion in its widest sense.”121See Goitein,Med. Soc., V:495–6 and 474. It should nevertheless be noted that Goitein hadearlier suggested a different candidate for the“acme of Jewish-Arab symbiosis”:“The mostperfect expression of Jewish-Arab symbiosis is not found in theArabicliterature of the Jews, butin theHebrewpoetry created in Muslim countries, particularly in Spain.”See Goitein,Jews andArabs, 155.122See Wasserstrom,Between Muslim and Jew, 233.123See the latter’s full discussion: Wasserstrom,Between Muslim and Jew, 225–35.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiIntroduction33"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"All of this raises the thorny question: does the exclusively one-sidednature of“Jewish-Sufi”activity detract from the picture of cultural symbiosisdescribed by Goitein and his successors?

If one were to speak of mutual influence at all, as Goitein andsubsequently Fenton have argued, it would be in the diachronic interplayof religious traditions rather than the synchronic exchange of religiousthinkers.130Symbiosis aptly captures the non-sectarian marketplace of ideasand goods, with partnership and exchange across diverse groups, but is lessuseful as a barometer of religious interaction and mutual influence. To be sure,such personal exchanges most likely did occur between Jewish and Muslimmystics, but the evidence strongly suggests that only one of the two commu-nities actively sought out, and creatively adapted itself to, the spiritual tradi-tions and rites of the other. As impressive as it is in the history of Jewishreceptivity to Islamic civilization, Egyptian pietism cannot be taken as abarometer of Jewish-Muslim symbiosis in general, or of mutual interfaithactivity in particular.The conspicuous imbalance reflected in this state of affairs raises a numberof methodological and terminological challenges. Methodologically speaking,we would do well to consider the appropriate framework within which todescribe the creative, albeit unidirectional, synergy of religious traditions atwork in Egyptian pietism. The questions facing us are not new in the bur-geoningfield of medieval Jewish–Islamic interactions, and they have beenrecently formulated by Miriam Goldstein in her schematic examination of themeaning and function of religious borders and border crossings. A number ofher questions are quite relevant to our discussion in this context:“In whatways were boundaries permeable, and in what ways were they impermeable?In what ways did locally or temporally specific factors affect the nature of such128The chief exception was Maimonides, who elicited a measure of interest among Muslimscholars.

What was, by all appearances, not accepted Jewishpraxis was recast as such by directly and brazenly engaging with Islamicnorms. And, by a similar turn of the interreligious mold, what was perceivedto be authentically and exclusively Islamic was reimagined as originally andessentially Jewish. While questions of identity and institutions remainedfirmlyfixed on the outside, they were, in the hands of Abraham Maimonidesand the broader movement of thirteenth-century Egyptian pietism, subject tointernal upheaval and realignment.The terminological conundrum facing a scholarly examination of Egyptianpietism is no less elusive. Even with the historical and methodological diffi-culties inherent in such a paradigm, a number of recent scholars have soughtto reapply Goitein’s concept of symbiosis to the medieval Jewish-Islamiccontext, or else have redefined the term so as to imply a more abstractframework of coexistence and mutual accommodation.132Others havepointed to alternative possibilities with which to describe and categorize theintercultural and interreligious matrix that was the medieval Islamic NearEast. Marshall Hodgson’s coinage of the term“Islamicate”over“Islamic”todescribe the world civilization of the Near East and North Africa during thisperiod has encouraged, in recent years, a more nuanced approach to the activerole played by religious minorities in this cultural tapestry and the novel formsand norms that result from this engagement.133131See her introduction to Friedenreich and Goldstein,Beyond Religious Borders,2.132Among the former, one can list the late Georges Vajda, who wrote of the“symbiose judéo-musulmane”as a process by which Jewish piety was enriched by the judicious integration ofIslamic spirituality. See Vajda,“Mystique juive et mystique musulmane,”38. A more recentparallel is the title of Diana Lobel’s important monograph on Baḥya ibn Paqūda,ASufi-JewishDialogue. While Lobel does not explore the significance of dialogue as a paradigm in her work,she described Baḥya as“a keyfigure in what the great scholar of Genizah literature S. D. Goiteintermed‘the Jewish-Arab symbiosis.’Baḥya shows the cross-fertilization of Islamic and Jewishculture at its most creative.”Perhaps she has in mind, as she suggested in the case of Baḥya’sintegration of philosophy and mysticism, an“internal dialogue,”rather than one that was in factbidirectional. See D. Lobel,ASufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibnPaquda’sDuties of the Heart (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007), xiii.

Thefirst example, raised by Nathan Hofer in a recentdissertation on Sufism in Ayyubid and early Mamluk Egypt, conceives of theJewish pietists as“subaltern Sufis,”alluding to their status as minorities“ofinferior rank or station,”who nevertheless exercise their spiritual agency in thesocial and intellectual sphere.135With the language of political dominationand minority self-assertion as his frame of reference, Hofer goes one stepfurther, arguing that the Egyptian pietists“were taking up these institutionalmodels for a revolutionary end,”aimed at“the liberation of the people ofIsrael from foreign rule.”136Within this framework, the entire pietist projectis reinterpreted as a“hidden transcript,”harboring the secret ambition“to upend the political and social order.”137Given that neither AbrahamMaimonides nor anyone in his circle openly claimed such a revolutionaryend in their writings, the hypothesis that they harbored such a hidden agendaremains just that. While intriguing, it appeals to the same spirit of esotericismapplied in a very different vein to the elder Maimonides, to whom a number ofmedieval and modern scholars have attributed a covert intellectual agenda.138Another approach, primarily associated with the work of Homi Bhabha,adopts the language of“hybridity”to address modes of acculturation andengagement with the dominant culture.139Even more than symbiosis, hybrid-ity has recently commanded a strong cachet in Jewish cultural studies and haselicited a sustained response in turn.140According to Jonathan Decter, work-ing on the medieval Andalusian context, the advantage of hybridity lies in itsevocation of the power dynamics implicit between majority and minoritycultures.

Despite its importation fromthe postcolonial to the medieval context, Decter maintains that hybridity“accounts for the new cultural forms that inhere in and emerge through therelationship between political bodies of disparate power, be they the colonizerand the colonized or the conqueror and the conquered.”142Decter’s and Hofer’s approaches, for all their differences, both seek toaddress the problem of power and powerlessness in the equation of interfaithengagement and estrangement. In the case of Egyptian pietism, it must beacknowledged, they address the subtle mechanism by which Islam was per-ceived as the historical foil to the messianic unfolding of events in Jewishsacred history. Islam, as we shall we see in Chapter six, was conceived as amere (if vital) intermediary between the original state of Jewish religious life inantiquity and its ultimate restoration in the anticipated future epoch.143But,even as it seeks to resolve one set of challenges, the application of postcolonialtheory to the medieval context raises still more vexing problems. Preciselybecause of the political undercurrent of this discourse, it threatens to reduce arich and dynamic phenomenon in the history of religions to a struggle forpolitical emancipation, on the one hand, or the political agenda of culturalexpression, on the other.144As Moshe Rosner has observed, a consequence ofapplying the postcolonial discourse to the premodern Jewish context is that“Jewish culture is always [imagined] in a hierarchical relationship with theculture of the Other, with the Jew in the inferior position...[thereby] owingits evolutionary position to energy supplied by the encounter with thehegemony.”145In the pages that follow, I seek to address the extraordinary rise and innerlife of the Egyptian pietist movement in thefirst half of the thirteenth century.The creative engagement with the dominant Islamic culture was alwayspresent, even when unspoken, and we shall frequently call attention to theSufisubtext of Jewish pietism, while striving not to reduce its spiritual141See J.

Moses Maimonides, who urged Jewish readers of his ethics to“listen tothe truth from whomever utters it,”and Moses ibn Ezra, who encouraged hiscoreligionists to read the Qur’an as a brilliant work of literature, are twooutstanding examples of this open posture.31See the synopsis by Scheindlin on this topic,“Merchants and Intellectuals, Rabbis and Poets:Judeo-Arabic Culture in the Golden Age of Islam,”inCultures of the Jews, ed.

In his view, religion was the one sphere deemed impregnable fromoutside influence:“From the time our kingdom was destroyed and ourpeople dispersed...we followed in the ways [of other nations] and adoptedtheir customs, assumed their manners and spoke their languages...The oneexception is in matters of religion and in [observance of] the statutes of theTorah.”10Despite these reservations, Jews from Iberia to Iraq in the second half of thetwelfth andfirst half of the thirteenth centuries increasingly drew from Sufimodels of ascetic piety, including adopting supererogatory prayer, strict regi-mens of fasting, and solitary retreats in the desert and mountainside. Anintriguing source for the Jewish attraction to Sufism appears in an earlywork of Maimonides. In the introduction to his commentary on MishnahAvot (generally known as the Eight Chapters), Maimonides noted certain“saintly individuals,”who adopt a discipline of“fasting, nightly vigils, absten-tion from meat and wine, separation from women, wearing wool and hair-cloth, dwelling in the mountains, and secluding themselves in the deserts.”While acknowledging the genuine piety of those who adopt this disciplinewith the intention of curing their vices through a severe mode of therapy,Maimonides proceeded to mock those Jews of his day who merely“imitatethe other nations...tormenting their bodies and renouncing pleasures as atreatise of Se‘adiah’sBook of Beliefs and Opinionsis genuine, it too points to the author’s critiqueof the extreme asceticism and devotionalism practiced by the Sufis of his day. See I. Efros,“Saadia’s General Ethical Theory and its Relation to Sufism,”JQR57 (1967), esp. 172–7.8The works of Joseph ibn‘Aqnīn, written in Fez, reveal the direct influence of Sufiideas, andreference Suficlassics, although no more than other Arab authors and poets.

For the use of Sufiworks on love of God by Jews of the period, seeP. Fenton,“Deux traités musulmans d’amour mystique en transmission judeo-arabe,”Arabica37 (1990), 47–55.

With the EgyptianJewish pietist movement, the Judaeo-Arabic cultural synthesis that hadflour-ished over the preceding two centuries reached its most intimate expression asthe Jewish embrace not of Arabic letters but of Islamic piety. This chapterexplores the early trajectory of Egyptian Jewish pietism, recently dubbed“Jewish-Sufism”on account of its adoption of Sufimodels.13The history ofJewish pietism in Egypt must be reconstructed from the trail of availablesources, both documentary and literary, which present two distinct challengesfor such an undertaking. Thefirst is the fragmentary nature of the sourcematerial, forcing the historian to proceed with caution. There are clear gaps inour information, where the realm of certainty ends and that of possibility andspeculation begin. A great deal of our source material emanates from thefamed Cairo Genizah, which offers a snapshot of developments in Egyptproper, with only the possibility (occasionally confirmed by other sources)that its fragments are indicative of developments in the wider Mediterraneanor Muslim world.The second difficulty thrust upon us by our sources concerns the chrono-logical scope of a historical reconstruction. While a good number of primary11Haqdamot ha-Rambam, ed. Shailat, 382–3. Maimonides critiqued those who adopt asceticpractices“thinking that...God hates the body, desiring its destruction and ruin”(Haqdamotha-Rambam, ed. Shailat, 382). Maimonides’comments are especially interesting in light of hisson’s inclination toward this spiritual discipline. Abraham never referred to his father’s qualifiedcritique of asceticism in his extant writings. On the place of“piety”(ḥasidut) and“beyond theletter of the law”(lifnim mi-shurat ha-din) in Maimonides’writings, see the recent study byB. Septimus,“Structure and Argument in the Book of Knowledge”(Hebrew), inHa-Rambam:Shamranut, meqoriyut, mahapkhanut, ed. A Ravitzky (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar Institute,2008), I: 227–9, 238–42.

I will occasionally refer to a fragmentassociated with the movement that bears the marks of the early thirteenthcentury but that lacks a clear date or other marker to anchor it securely in theperiod. Any reconstruction of Egyptian Jewish pietism must contend with thedifficulty of achieving chronological precision, and this effort is no exception.But, as the Talmud reminds us, a judge can only render a judgment based onthe evidence at hand.14With all the caveats just mentioned, the combinationof documentary, literary, and juridical sources from the thirteenth century tella compelling story that, while far from exhaustive, may point the way forwardand provide a foundation for future efforts.ORIGINS AND DEFINITIONSIndividual Jewish pietists were active in Egypt in the late twelfth century, if notearlier, although the details regarding this early activity remain opaque. By thetime information on Egyptian pietism begins to swell in the documentary andliterary sources, from the turn of the thirteenth century, it is already depictedas a vibrant, popular, and multifaceted movement. Among the earliest infor-mation we possess on the movement already attests to a diverse assortment ofpractices and emerging mystical literature, together with a recognizable spir-itual leadership. A key letter, which can be dated to thefirst or second decadeof the thirteenth century, heaps praise on the leaders and practitioners of thenascent movement, whose commentaries reveal“the inner meaning of scrip-ture”(sod perush ha-miqra),15and whose practices include“arising at nightand fasting during the day as on the day of atonement...purifying their souls,polishing their bodies,16removing the chaff of their hearts, and purging thedross of their minds. How exalted is their state—these and many similar things14See BT Sanhedrin 6b.15A number of Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘’s commentaries were cited by his colleague,Abraham Maimonides, in the latter’s commentary to Genesis and Exodus and in theCompendium.See, e.g.,Perush,377–81, andHW,II:418,ll.6–10.

At their head is...Abraham the Pious...and [hisbrother] Joseph...”17A number of signs point to a newly burgeoning movement from the earlythirteenth century, with a leadership and activity emanating largely fromFustat. In the letter just cited, the group is described as performing certaincommon rites, which together came to define its ascetic orientation andindebtedness to Sufipractice—most notably prayer by night, fasting by day,and spiritual discipline under the guidance of one or more recognized masters.But other signs of the vibrancy of the nascent movement abound. Its creativityand productivity can be gleaned from the long trail of Genizah fragments(including some nearly complete manuscripts) emanating from thefirst half ofthe thirteenth century, including multiple copies of Sufiwritings and originalpietist works written by members of the circle in Egypt.18The social status ofindividuals associated with the pietist movement suggests that its influencecould be felt in every level of Egyptian Jewish society, gaining critical accept-ance not only among the poorer strata of the community but also amonginfluential members of the establishment.19Maimonides’remarks on Jewish ascetics in his Mishnah commentary,composed between 1161 and 1168, cannot be used to infer activity in Egyptwith absolute certainty, as Maimonides composed much if not most of hiscommentary en route, and completed it after settling in Egypt.20As we do notknow precisely when Maimonides arrived in Egypt, nor in what order hecomposed his commentary, it is impossible to verify which group of JewsMaimonides had in mind when writing these lines. Nevertheless, the autograph17TS 20.148,recto, ll. 4, 10–15, 22, 30. In a reference to this letter, Fenton rendered someabridged lines to the effect that“many are their followers and at their head is Abraham thePious.”See Fenton,“Some Judaeo-Arabic Fragments by Rabbi Abraham he-Ḥasīd, the JewishSufi,”48, n. 3. If this reading is correct, it would indicate a wide following belonging to Abrahamthe Pious (and his brother) at the beginning of the thirteenth century. My own reading of thesedifficult lines is somewhat different. Following a long (though in the main rather vague)description of pietist practices, the letter writer observed:“These and many similar things arefound among them (ka-henah rabbot‘imam)”(recto, ll. 15–22). I am led in this translation by thewriter’s choice ofrabbotrather thanrabbim. Even thoughrabbotis part of the rhyme scheme ofthe poetic prose (maqāmah), it is difficult to see how it can be rendered“many people.”Fentonelsewhere wrote that Abraham the Pious was described as“the head of the pietists”in TS 20.44(published by E. J. Worman,“Two Book-Lists from the Cambridge Genizah Fragments,”JQR,o.s., 20 (1908), 460–3), although I could not discover this epithet in the original document. SeeP. Fenton,The Treatise of the Pool: Al-Maqala al-Hawdiyya(London: The Octagon Press, 1981),57, n. 32. He may have intended 20.148 instead of 20.44.18See Fenton,The Treatise of the Pool,5–6, and cf.

Given the importance of Egypt as the center ofthe pietist movement in the coming decades, there is good reason to assumethat Maimonides had his Egyptian coreligionists in mind when alluding to aband of Sufi-influenced Jewish ascetics in his day. This wouldfit well with anorganic model of development for Egyptian pietism, beginning with individualascetics and only gradually organizing along institutional lines with discretemaster–disciple circles.21In light of these sources, the Egyptian pietist movement should not beviewed as the creation of any specific individual, but as a slow developmentoriginating in a groundswell of individual ascetics that only gradually organ-ized into a unified movement under the direction of influential masters withdefined discipleship circles. As the reference to the leadership of Abraham“thePious”(ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘) and his brother Joseph illustrates, Abraham Maimoni-des was not thefirst pietistfigure to emerge as a major leader and spokesmanof the movement. It is significant, however, that while the Nagid described ibnAbī’l-Rabī‘as his colleague (ṣāḥib), he never referred to the elder pietist as hismaster or teacher.22It is likewise clear that Abraham Maimonides had alreadyestablished his own pietist circle by 1205, which met in his academy forworship and presumably pietist fellowship under his guidance.23As we shallsee in our discussion of his efforts to revitalize synagogue worship, the Nagiddid initiate a number of pietist practices of his own as he sought to give shapeto a dynamic and increasingly diverse movement.24His dispute with Danielibn al-Māshiṭah in the 1220s over the synthesis of pietism and rationalism isan example of the Nagid’s efforts to define a movement that had grown toounwieldy for any single individual, no matter how influential, to mold in hisown image.2521Earlier references in the Genizah to Egyptian ascetics, both male and female, indicatethat they acted on an individual basis and adopted the name“nazirite”rather than“pietist.”SeeTS NS J 251 (nazir) and TS 13 J 8.11,verso(nezirah), and cf.

D. Goitein, raises questions asto the meaning of the terms“pietist”and“pietism.”Goitein argued thatAbraham’s interest in pietism may have originated from his mother’s side ofthe family. The operating question behind Goitein’s hypothesis was howAbraham became the most eloquent spokesman of a pietist revival so severelycriticized by his father.26On the basis of a newly discovered Genizah fragment,Goitein suggested that Abraham was exposed to pietist tendencies by hismaternal relatives or from a family tradition on his mother’s side. Thefragment in question consists of a genealogical list of Abraham’s maternalline, in which many of the names were followed by the epithet“pious”(ḥasid).27In Goitein’s estimation,“It follows that Abraham Maimonides’maternal side of the family was well known for its devotion to pietism, andwe may infer that our [Abraham] continued this venerable tradition and gaveboth theoretical expression to it in his books and practical expression to it inhis mode of conduct in his pietist circle.”28The genealogical list discovered by Goitein is identical to another listpublished over forty years earlier by Jacob Mann, with the exception thatGoitein’s list includes the pietist epithets.29Goitein’s hypothesis rests on theassumption that the more detailed list is by definition the more authentic, andhence the original of the two. Its repeated mention of“pious”and“crown ofthe pious”(pe’er he-ḥasidim) is unlike any other genealogical list of its kind—another argument for its authenticity. According to this view,“pious”wouldbe better read as“pietist”(the same Hebrew term), in so far as we are dealingnot with a mere personal characteristic but with a conscious mode of livingdevoted to piety. Goitein’s theory is an attractive explanation for Abraham’sapparent deviation from his father’s doctrine of moderation, but the chiefand Piety: Abraham Maimonides and his Times,”Dissertation, Harvard University, 2009,115–20. Ibn al-Māshiṭah’s traditionalist critique and Abraham Maimonides’response requiresa sustained analysis, to which I intend to return in a separate context.26My personal contention is that Maimonides’remarks on Jewish asceticism in the EightChapters should not be interpreted as a generalized critique of asceticism or of pietism per se.This is, however, a larger and more complex topic than can be treated in a footnote. I intend torevisit this question on a separate occasion.27The fragment, TS Box K 15.68, was published and discussed by S. D. Goitein in“AbrahamMaimonides and his Pietist Circle”(Hebrew),Tarbiz33 (1964), 181–4.28See Goitein,“Abraham Maimonides and his Pietist Circle,”182. Goitein’s proposal wasaccepted by M. A.

As Paul Fenton has shown, the scribe who wrotethe fragment discovered by Goitein, Joseph b. Solomon ha-Levi, was active atthe end of the thirteenth century.30Given that the genealogical list onlyextends to the end of the twelfth century, more than a century before Josephb. Solomon, it stands to reason that the more minimal list was the original ofthe two. For the compiler of the original list, the termḥasid(which appearsonly once) was a mere honorific for a pious individual and not a mark ofaffiliation with a movement that, at the time, was still in its infancy. By the endof the thirteenth century, after key members of the Maimonidean dynastywere known both as practitioners and proponents of Egyptian pietism, Josephb. Solomon attached the newly significant epithets (ḥasidandḥasidim)toprevious generations.31It is in this context that we ought to clarify the term“pietism”as a conceptand as an indicator of social and religious movements. As has already becomeapparent, the term“piety”is easily confused with“pietist,”particularly giventhat the two are translations of the same Hebrew word. The difference lies inthe social construction of the two terms. When externally attributed to anindividual as an expression of religious reverence,ḥasidutconnotes piety.When it is self-described, designating for the individual an ideal way of lifedirected to the attainment of piety, it is better translated as pietism.32We mayadd that medieval Jewish pietism typically manifested itself in additionallegal strictures and a maximalist approach to religious devotion.33But asSoloveitchik stressed in the German example, such common principles alonedid not a pietist movement make. It is the manifestation of uniqueformsofpietism, expressed in outer bearing and special disciplines, typically thoughnot always organized around a charismatic leadership and geographic setting,which gives a particular case the trappings of a social movement, rather thanan interior orientation. It is precisely the social dimension, consisting of30See Fenton,The Treatise of the Pool, 6, andDeux traités de mystique juive(Lagrasse:Éditions Verdier, 1987), 37.

Friedman,“The ibn al-AmshāṭīFamily, In-Laws of Maimonides”(Hebrew),Zion69 (2004), 276.31This is not to imply that there was not interest in pietism among the in-laws of Maimonidesduring his lifetime and that of his son. Maimonides’brother-in-law, Mishael b.‘Uzziel, forexample, was an admirer of the pietists, on which see MS Frankfurt a. M., published by Horovitz,“Ein arabischer Brief an R. Chananel,”155–6, and reproduced by Goitein,“R. Ḥananel the ChiefJudge,”379–80. As noted above, Mishael referred to Ḥananel’s residence as one of“piety andasceticism”(al-war‘īwa’l-zāhidī), attributes indicating more than formulaic praise.32See I.

From the latter part of thetwelfth century, the new Ayyubid government in Cairo led by Salāḥal-Dīn(Saladin) lent its administrative andfinancial support to local Sufiinstitutionsand brotherhoods, among other philanthropic projects.36By the early thir-teenth century, as attested by the Fustatshaikh,Ṣafīal-Dīn, Egypt had becomea center of Sufiactivity not only in isolated circles but in the public sphere.37We have direct testimony of pietists personally observing Sufirites in thefirsthalf of the thirteenth century and an explicit acknowledgement of adoptingsimilar, if not identical, rites in their own circles.38In many instances, Sufiterms were adopted by the pietists in their original forms, while in others casesHebrew terms were applied in novel ways, as withderekhroughly supplanting34For a comparison of the German and Egyptian pietist movements, see P.

In this view, mysticism and philosophy need not be viewed in mutualopposition but may occasionally be complementary—a synthesis variously de-scribed as“intellectual”or“philosophic”mysticism by David Blumenthal, draw-ing upon the formulation of a number of earlier scholars.43The binary modelopposing pietism with philosophy, best exhibited in Islamic Sufism in the thoughtof AbūḤāmid al-Ghazālī(d. 1111), found its Jewish exemplar in the case ofDaniel ibn al-Māshiṭah, a traditionalist critic of Maimonidean rationalism and itspietist vanguard, best exemplified in the writings of Abraham Maimonides and hiscircle, which is best described as a form of intellectual illuminationism.44But whatunited the rationalists and anti-rationalists in the pietist camp was their mutualemphasis on the practical discipline of the spiritual life. The growth of themovement, in this view, was not due to its mystical doctrine (of which preciouslittle is preserved in the sources) but to its pietist regimen.Egyptian pietism did not invent a new doctrine or devise a new regimenpreviously unknown in the region. Its success was not a function of its novelty,41P. Fenton,“Abraham Maimonides (1186–1237) : Founding a Mystical Dynasty,”inJewishMystical Leaders and Leadership in the 13th Century, ed. M.

In one letterpreserved in the Genizah, we hear of a Jewish merchant from Fustat, whoselifestyle did not accord with the rigors of the pietist path but who neverthelesspracticed some of its rites in the hopes of curing his wayward temperamentand perhaps even earning himself a pious reputation. In the letter, themerchant wrote to his wife while on a business trip to India and Yemen.After describing some of his adventures, he observed:Day and night I was constantly drinking, not of my free will, but I conducted myselfin an exemplary way and if anyone poked fun in foul speech in my presence, Ibecame furious with him, until he became silent, he and others. I constantly fulfilledwhat God knows, and cured my soul by fasting during the days and praying duringthe nights. The congregations in Aden and in India often asked me to lead them inprayer, and I am regarded by them and regard myself as a pious man.46The incongruity of the merchant’s tumultuous lifestyle and his pious self-regard is a telling sign of the pervasive culture of piety at the turn of thethirteenth century.47Whatever the reason for his constant drinking bouts, it ishardly the lifestyle typical of one striving for a discipline of piety.48Yet whenseeking the proper antidote or“cure”for his raucous life, the merchantadopted the quintessential mark of piety of his day, fasting by day and prayingby night, the same rites that became the hallmark of the nascent pietistmovement.49Equally significant is the fact that a recognizable culture ofpiety, initially cultivated by Sufimystics, was shared by Jews across the Islamicworld, from Egypt to Iraq to Yemen, and embraced universally as their own.45See Judah Ḥarizi’s praise of the Iraqi Jewishshaikh,‘Imrān al-Hītī, for his ascetic practicesof fasting during the day and rising in the night for supererogatory prayer in Blau,Kitābal-durar, 211–13, and on these practices, see Chapter two, p. 104.46ENA 2739.17, translated by S.

On oneoccasion, wefind Abraham Maimonides defending the participation of non-scholars, as well as that of women and children, in pietist prayer groups,suggesting that the movement included not only a coterie of devoted disciplesbut also drew on a wider circle of interested community members.50On anotheroccasion, Abraham chided those who adopted pietist behavior without thesincerity and dedication of a true disciple, such as“one who spends a long timein prayer and worship, wearing fringes and phylacteries all the time, in the hopethat people will view him as pious.”51Even if Abraham’s remarks exaggerated thestate of affairs, they confirm the impression from other sources that the move-ment had grown to the point of including a fringe who wished to be associatedwith its outer trappings.52Equally important is the fact that a not insignificantnumber of pietists were unlearned individuals, a phenomenon that the Nagidlamented and even criticized as unbecoming of a pietist.53Even in its early years,interest in the movement had grown beyond the direct control of its mostinfluential members.The appeal of the pietist movement extended not only to Rabbanites but toKaraites as well. There is ample testimony of extensive Karaite involvement inthe movement and no evidence whatsoever that the two camps operated50SeeSM, 168.51HW, ed.

But note the tradition quoted byal-Qushairī, Lazarus-Yafeh,Studies in al-Ghazzali(riyā’al-‘ārifīnafḍal min iklāṣal-murīdīn).Abraham could be quiteflexible on the question of sincerity, as seen inSM, 173, citing the rabbinicprinciple that“from an impure motive may come a pure motive”(e.g., BT Pesaḥim 50b). Yetelsewhere he placed great emphasis on this virtue. Abraham devoted a chapter of theCompendiumto the topic of“sincerity in actions”(iklāṣal-a‘māl)inHW,I:152–60. He used bothmurā’ah(spelledperhapsmurāyah)andriyā’for hypocrisy, as inHW,I:160,l.1(fortheformer),and154,ll.3,5,and160, l. 4 (for the latter).

One must conclude that,while liturgical prayer was necessarily conducted separately, all supererogatoryrites and ceremonies, not to mention guidance under ashaikh, were performedjointly. In many ways, the reformist ideal of Egyptian pietism was concerned farmore with the rehabilitation of biblical models of piety than with rabbinic ones,especially with the insertion of prostration and kneeling in worship, the subjectof Chapters three and four, and the revival of prophecy and prophetic disciple-ship, the subject of Chaptersfive and six.The Karaite attraction to Sufism in general, and to Egyptian pietism inparticular, may have had as much to do with the heightened scripturalism ofthe movement as with its emphasis on ascetic discipline and messianicanticipation. As Paul Fenton has demonstrated, numerous pietist writings ofthis period were either composed or copied by Egyptian Karaites.54Equallysignificant is the fact that most of the pietist manuscripts that have survived innear entirety and are currently housed in the St. Petersburg library werediscovered by Abraham Firkovitch in the Karaite synagogue of old Cairoand perhaps other Karaite depositories in the region.55Karaite participation in the pietist movement has revived interest in aseventeenth-century report by the Egyptian Jewish chronicler, Joseph Sam-bari, who told of a mass conversion of Karaites to Rabbanism under theauspices of Abraham Maimonides.56Sambari’s brief report reads as follows:In the days of [Abraham Maimonides], a large number of the congregation ofKaraites [in Egypt] converted57under his authority and accepted the terms ofrabbinic law. Many Jews from good and upright families, including priests andlevites, contracted marriages with them.58Of the many Genizah papers documenting the history of the pietist movementand the Karaite involvement in it, not a single source has emerged thatconfirms Sambari’s report of a Karaite conversion to Rabbanism in the earlythirteenth century. As I have shown on another occasion, Sambari appears tohave derived his information from an earlier source that erroneously54See P. Fenton,“Karaism and Sufism,”inKaraite Judaism: A Guide to its History andLiterary Sources, ed. M. Polliack (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2003), 199–212.

The absence of any reference onhis part to such a mass“conversion”of Karaites merely underscores theinaccuracy of the report. What is more, there is no evidence of any frictionor controversy between the two camps during the period of Abraham’sNagidate. If anything, the pietist movement appears to have alleviated thedifferences between Rabbanites and Karaites by means of a fruitful partnershipas members of a common mystical fellowship (ṣuḥbah).60The attraction of pietism, among Rabbanites and Karaites alike, was evidentin all economic strata of Egyptian Jewish society. Its known leaders wereprominent and fairly well-to-do individuals, including physicians and mem-bers of the communal establishment, but its membership appears to have beenquite diverse. The letter addressed to Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘and his brother,Joseph, cited earlier, was sent from an indigent pietist teacher named Joel, whosoughtfinancial assistance from two prominent and wealthy fellow pietists.6159I explored this and the role of Maimonides and his son in Karaite–Rabbanite relations inmy talk,“Karaites and Rabbanites in Medieval Egypt and Palestine: Between Law and Reality,”atBen-Gurion University of the Negev (Jan. 2013).60Pietists referred to one another as“fellows”(aṣḥāb), and expressed a sense of kinship tofellow disciples. In one letter, in which an anonymous pietist master instructed his disciple onspiritual matters, he closed by extending greetings“to anyone whom you know to be among[our] companions.”See ENA NS 10 (laminated 46),recto, ll. 22–3, published by Fenton,“APietist Letter from the Genizah,”163.

It is not known how this poor judgeearned a livelihood while in Fustat, as he could not afford equipment for theonly profession for which he had training. It seems likely that poorer disciplesof the Nagid were provided with basic subsistence while under his care bywealthier members of the group.67In this case, Ṭahor also served as judge,which would have earned him a modest emolument from the communalchest, although the amounts doled out to local officials were often quitenegligible, and necessitated a supplementary income.68In a commentary of Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘, preserved by the Nagid, thereis a suggestive remark on the economic status of the majority of pietists inEgypt. While it is often difficult in sources such as these to draw a clear linebetween generality and historical allusion, the reference to the experience of“most”pious ascetics in this passage suggests that the commentator had inmind the historical situation of pietists in Egypt, with which he and the Nagidwere intimately familiar.“You shall not privilege (lit. honor) a poor man in his judgment.”Abraham thePious, of blessed memory, had an interpretation as to why the verse expressed thisprohibition with the verb“honor”as opposed to“take pity”or“have compas-sion,”as Onqelos translated it.69He said that it alludes to a pious ascetic (li’l-wari‘al-zāhid), who is for the most part poor (alladhi huwa faqīr‘alā’l-akthar), and ishonored for his piety, just as great scholars are honored, of whom scriptureforbids their honor in judgment, as it says (Lev. 19:15)“You shall not privilege(lit. honor) a great man.”Here, too, it warns you not to show him honor injudgment on account of his piety, but to render the verdict that isfitting in hiscase.

SeeB. Dinur,Israel and the Diaspora(Philadelphia, P.A.: Jewish Publication Society of America,1969), II:3 and 331, n. 73. The idea of such afunduqwas based on a legendary chronicle onMaimonides, published by A.

The state of inner poverty, and its outer manifestation intattered clothing, had become so characteristic of the Sufipath by the thir-teenth century that certain masters, beginning with‘Umar al-Suhrawardī(d. 1234), sought to distinguish between the mendicant (faqīr) and the genuineSufiand to assign them different ranks within the cloister (ribāṭ) belonging tothe order.71In a similar acknowledgment of the spread of mendicant ideals inEgyptian Jewish society, Abraham Maimonides distinguished between those“who wear tattered clothing and eat meager portions not by choice but out ofnecessity”and those who have renounced physical pleasures from their heartsand dramatize their spiritual poverty with an outer comportment of simpleclothing and minimal food.72The Nagid did not conceal the fact that the nearest model for the spiritualideal of inner poverty came from the Sufienvironment, although he made itclear that the source of the Sufiideal was not Islam but the practice of theancient prophets of Israel:“[The prophets’] lack of pride, as well as theirrenunciation and contentment, were such that they accepted whatever wasgiven to them in the manner of alms given to the poor...This practice ofeating what comes to hand is among those [customs] borrowed [from theprophets] by the Sufis of Islam.”73And again:“[T]he customary dress of thegenuine prophets was such that they would wear tattered garments and otherclothing worn by the poor (malbūs al-fuqarā’), in the manner of the clothingof the Sufis in our day...But do not hold us in contempt for comparing thiswith the situation of the Sufis, because it was the Sufis who imitated theprophets and walked in their footsteps, not the prophets in theirs.”74Yet, apart from the spiritual ideal of poverty, the Nagid confirmed thegeneral observation of ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘that many pietists were not only poorin spirit but also poor in fact, in some cases living“in extreme poverty.”75Aswe shall see, he appears to have followed his father’s injunction and encour-aged his disciples to earn a livelihood so as not to be dependent on thehandouts of the community.7671See Suhrawardī,‘Awārif al-ma‘ārif, A.

Wehave already observed the interesting fact that Abraham Maimonides did notdiscourage, and perhaps even encouraged, the attendance of women andchildren in pietist prayer circles in Egypt. While it is possible that somewomen may have participated independently of any family connection andviewed themselves as pietists in their own right, as we know did occasionallyoccur in the Sufisphere,77it is likely that many if not most of the women inattendance were spouses of pietist disciples, and that the children mentionedin this context were part of the same family units.78Assuming this to be thecase, it is the only evidence we possess to suggest that affiliation with themovement may have become something of a family affair. Even more inter-esting is the possibility that pietists may have coalesced—as families and notonly as individuals—in a cohesive social unit which resembled and reinforcedthe fellowship experienced in public worship. An interesting parallel to thefamilial experience of the Jewish pietists can be found among their Suficounterparts in Egypt, who maintained a family culture in their cloisteredresidences throughout the country, forshaikhand disciples alike.7977The well-known treatise by Abū‘Abd al-Raḥmān al-Sulamī(d. 1021), known asṬabaqātal-ṣūfīyah, originally included an appendix on Sufiwomen saints, calledDhikr al-niswahal-muta‘abbidāt al-ṣūfīyāt, which bears witness to the important role of women in Suficircles.The appendix was circulated separately from the main treatise and was lost for centuries, beforeit was recently rediscovered and published with an English translation, by R.

As attractive as the pietist ideal was for many inEgyptian Jewish society, there is ample testimony of the acrimony and ani-mosity it engendered from other quarters. Beyond the opposition it receivedfrom traditionalists in the communal establishment, including judges andindependent scholars, we also hear of resistance to the movement in themore intimate sphere of family life. In an anonymous pietist treatise on prayerand the spiritual life dating to the reign of al-Malik al-Kāmil (r. 1218–38),we hear of the need for utmost care not to reveal one’s pietism to familymembers, lest they reveal their hostility to the movement and denounce it asheresy. As we shall see, a number of pietists designated a place in their homesfor solitary meditation and private prayer, and the fear of discovery by familymembers must have posed both existential and practical barriers to theobservance of the pietist life. After a lengthy description of meditative ecstasy,the author offers the reader a word of caution:Now it is essential for anyone who truly comprehends the discipline of thiswondrous, noble, and exalted station (maqām) that he conceal himself in what-ever way possible, so that no onefind him out, not even members of his ownfamily, if they are opposed to him. For these practices are unfamiliar to ourcontemporaries, the generations of the exile.85If they dofind him out, they willzealously demand that he reveal [what he is doing] or hand him over to someoneelse in the midst of the exile. This is because his family denies any knowledge ofhis ultimate goal. They are so ignorant of it that when they see one of the practicesleading to this noble goal, they declare it to be mere heresy and strictly forbidden.They will then bring proofs as to its prohibition with sayings the inner meaning ofwhich they do not understand. This is the meaning of the hiding of the divine face(hastarat panim), regarding the likes of which Elijah, peace be upon him, said,“You have turned their hearts backward”(1 Kings 18:37). It is therefore essentialfor anyone who is mindful and astute to be vigilant and not be unaware, topractice without cease while concealing himself to the utmost extent (wa-yuta-sattir ghāyat al-tasattur).8685Lit.“the people of the exile”(ahl al-galut).

At the end of this chapter, we shall consider the evidence for the effort tobrand the pietists as heretics and the variety of pietist responses to thisanimosity. The testimony of the anonymous pietist in this treatise casts lightnot only on the delicate state of Egyptian pietism in its early years but, equallysignificant, the fact that such heresy-mongering had already become a force ofdivision within families, adding yet anotherfissure in an already strainedcommunal fabric.89The impact of pietism on family life must be considered from yet anotherangle: the connection between pietist views on marriage and sexuality andintimate family relations. In a recent article, Avraham Grossman argued thatAbraham Maimonides represents a shift toward a more positive view ofwomen than his father, who was still beholden to the Aristotelian paradigmof female inferiority based on women’s perceived materiality, while in otherways reflecting the stereotypical image of the status of women in society.90Grossman attributed the absence of the philosophical doctrine of inferiorityothers in the Sufitradition, see ibn Aṭā’Allāh al-Sakandarī(d. 1309); see ibn Sīnā,Al-Ishārātwa’l-tanbīhāt, ed.

On the theme of the exile in pietist theology, see especially pp. 174–and n, 67.88Note the author’s observation that it is all but impossible to conceal everything (i.e. toremain self-conscious) in the midst of meditative trance. When this does occur, he reassured, thetrue adept should not be ashamed or diminished by being caught. See Goitein,“AbrahamMaimonides and His Pietist Circle,”146:“One’s practices ought to be concealed from everyoneand he should not reveal it to anyone except what is impossible to avoid. It is impossible toconceal his limbs when his interior overpowers his outside. For whenever the heart becomesfilled with awe of the majesty of the Creator, may He be exalted, compared to the smallness ofman and he his soul grows exceedingly humble, his emotional state (al-infi‘āl) is manifest andcannot be concealed. Whenever a person is upright in his condition, absorbed in this state ofpossession, he is not diminished or embarrassed when people see him.

While we do havetestimony of female attendance at pietist prayer circles, we cannot extrapolatefrom this an ideal image that women were active members of pietist fellow-ships, nor do we have explicit testimony of female pietists as we do of femaleSufis, and even the phenomenon of femaleshaikhāt. To the contrary, pietistsources that describe a tension between religious devotions and the distrac-tions of family life take for granted that it is the husband who is pursuing thereligious life and the wife who is the distraction (in addition to children andthe need to earn a livelihood).9491See Grossman,“Woman and Family,”144, and cf.

Chipman(Waltham: Brandeis University Press, 2004), for a somewhat systematic treatment of rabbinicviews on women in the Middle Ages.92This view ironically underscores pietism’s intellectual debt to the philosophical tradition.Grossman acknowledged the philosophical affirmation of the female capacity for prophecy,considered the most exalted attainment of a human being.

While women were by no means confined to the homeduring the classical Genizah period, the expectation was for the husband toearn the family’s livelihood and for the wife to care for the maintenance andnourishment of the household.95What made pietist families exceptional inthis milieu was the additional expectation that the husband would requireextra time for religious devotions beyond the time already spent apart from hisfamily. In the view of the Nagid, this situation gave rise to two distinct, butrelated, challenges. On the one hand, the Nagid counseled pietists (which is tosay, male pietists) to focus on the essentials of the household and“to train[the members of his family] little by little, to the extent that they are able, to becontent with the necessities [of life] and to do without excess...”96On theother hand, for those who were contemplating becoming disciples, he coun-seled them to avoid marriage until they had successfully advanced on thepietist path. The challenges facing an aspiring pietist, we are told, are not newbut were confronted by the sages and prophets of earlier times.[It is vital that] one undertake the elevated path [of pietism] before one hasbecome consumed with marriage and children, which interrupt one’s religiousdevotion, as the sages said in surprise at one who thought that one shouldfirstmarry and then learn Torah,“Shall he have a millstone round his neck and thenlearn Torah?”97One of [the sages], explaining why he avoided marriage, said,“My love is for the Torah.”98Our father Jacob, too, did not marry until he reachedthe age of eighty-three years, while Elijah and Elisha never married...99The question arising from passages such as these is whether Abraham or otherpietist leaders encouraged some of their disciples not only to delay marriagebut to avoid it altogether. This is a particularly vexing question fromthe perspective of the movement’s normative status and perceptions of itsantinomianism and heretical tendencies. The Nagid testified to the fact that“we have seen many ascetics of our nation and of other nations”abstain frommarriage altogether, and added that this was the custom of numerousprophets and saints of previous generations.100Abraham himself neverdeclared unequivocally that one need not marry, but he strongly implied95On women’s domesticity during the classical Genizah period, see Goitein,Med. Soc.,III:341–4. For the standard image of husband–wife divisions of labor, seeHW, II:180, ll. 3–12.96HW, II:264, ll. 7–8.97See BT Qiddushin 29b.98See BT Yevamot 63b.99HW, II:264, ll. 12–19.

Such acloister was intended to function as a type of permanent devotion, modeled onthe ancient priesthood in that its members would be supported by communalfunds, without any external distractions from family responsibilities or theneed to earn a livelihood. The only expectation for such individuals would beto serve as teachers and spiritual models for the community. There is noevidence that institutions of this type existed in fact, only that they wereenvisioned to stimulate the religious revival of the people for which the pietistswould serve as spiritual vanguards.It is essential for the leadership of Jewish communities that a group of people beselected from each one who are all upright and virtuous, renouncing this worldand longing for the world to come.104They should be permanently secluded inthe synagogue for the recitation of the Torah and to practice solitary devotion(al-tafarruḡli’l-‘ibādah). They should be exclusively occupied with this importantreligious work to the exclusion of any worldly occupations. Their basic requirements101Note that Maimonides had already accepted the view of Ben Azzai as acceptable in uniquecircumstances. See MT,“Laws of Marriage,”15.3, paving the way for Abraham’s more developedposition. See Friedman’s remarks on the influence of Maimonides on the question of marriage inthe following note.102Mordechai Friedman has suggested that Abraham’s views on marriage in general, and onpostponing marriage in particular, were informed by those of his father, who may have had theseviews in mind when deciding to postpone his own marriage. See the discussion in Friedman,“Two Maimonidean Documents,”203–8, esp. 206:“I do not believe that Abraham Maimonidesdeveloped a new approach [to marriage]. In essence, this was the approach of Maimonides in hiswritings, an attitude that [Maimonides] apparently implemented in practice in his personal life.”See also the discussion in Halbertal,Maimonides,34–7.103In light of Abraham’s son Obadiah’s views on marriage, Fenton speculated that Obadiahmay himself have avoided marriage. See Fenton,Treatise of the Pool, 25. There is, however, arecord of Obadiah having had a son, named Abraham, for whom he wrote theTreatise of thePool, on which see A. H. Freimann,“The Genealogy of the Maimonidean Family”(Hebrew).Alumah1 (1936), 25. No dates or biographical information have been preserved on Abraham b.Obadiah.104In Jewish pietist thought (as in Sufism), the world to come was the spiritual world of purecontemplation and divine communion. We have already observed the idea of a taste of the worldto come, in this world, in pietist thought. The discipline of the spiritual life was sometimesknown as“the path of the world to come”(ṭarīq al-ākhirah) and“the practice of the world tocome”(‘amalora‘māl al-ākhirah).

As Mordechai Friedman has recently observed, Abrahamutilized the category of the tenbaṭlanim, especially as formulated by his father,105SM, 112–13. Abraham observed prior to this passage that his father had initially inter-preted the role of the ten resident members of the synagogue (‘asarah baṭlanim) as congrega-tional and ritual officers, but later changed his interpretation to view these individuals as devoidof any occupation, engaged exclusively in communal responsibilities and the study of Torah. Seehis commentary to M. Megillah 1:3 inMishnah‘im Perush Rabbenu Mosheh ben Maimon, OrderMo‘ed, 345. It was along the lines of the latter interpretation that Abraham offered his ownversion here. Maimonides appears to have changed his mind once again, as can be seen in aresponsum that appears to have escaped the attention of his son. SeeTeshuvot ha-Rambam, ed.Blau (Jerusalem: Rubin Mass Ltd., 1986), 219–20, no. 123, where he wrote that these individualswere not without work, but merely available to attend to the needs of the community and thesynagogue at any time.

Though he does not address the question ofcelibacy explicitly, it is impossible to reconcile this type of monasticism with afunctioning family life. It is in this context that we are to understand theprecedent of priests and levites. Though not an example of celibacy in and ofthemselves, they underscore the fact that the ideal pietist cloister was intendedto function as an exceptional group, whose exclusive devotion to the spirituallife was not to be emulatedin totoby others.110They were, like the leviticaltribe of old, to constitute a spiritual class unto itself.111Also like the idealizedpriests and levites of Temple times, this class of devotees would serve asreligious leaders“for the rectification of Jewish worship,”and would in turnbe supported by the community for its service.112For the Nagid, the perpetu-ation of such an elite group in Jewish society was essential for the revitalizationof religious life and the preservation of the community as a whole.“An arousalof the heart toward [God], may He be exalted, is something we cannot survivewithout. Were it not for the fact that it exists in a few of us, we would allperish.”113CONFRONTING COMMUNAL OPPOSITIONDespite its appeal to common conceptions of piety and its support from theNagid and other prominentfigures, Egyptian pietism faced considerableopposition from other rabbinic leaders, whose names remain anonymous,109See Friedman,“The TenBaṭlanim,”807.110The Nagid noted that the nation as a whole could not sustain a renunciation of marriagewithout assuring its own destruction. SeeHW, II: 278, ll. 10–15.111On the parallel with the tribe of Levi, seeHW, II:280, ll. 5–20, in which Abraham cited hisfather’s words in MT,“Laws of the Sabbatical and Jubilee,”13:13:“Not only the tribe of Levi, butany individual whatsoever who has dedicated himself and set his mind to separating himself andstanding in the presence of God...who has removed himself from the many [worldly] calcu-lations which most people pursue, such a person has become sanctified as the holy of holies. Godshall be his portion...and will provide for his needs in this world, as [God] provided for thepriests and levites...”What Maimonides described of an exceptional individual, Abrahamsought to develop into a self-perpetuating institution that would be of spiritual benefit to thebroader community.112Note, e.g., the language of the following expressions in the passage above:zuhhādfī’l-dunyārāghibūnfīḥayye ha-‘olam ha-ba; al-tafarrugh li’l-‘ibādah;‘ubbād; kol mevaqesh ha-shem.Blidstein has likewise argued that this ideal cloister was intended as a pietist enclave, pointing tothe almost sectarian nature of the movement.

Opposition to pietism isevident from a variety of Genizah sources, which consistently depict theNagid as the chief spokesman responsible for replying to criticism on behalfof his fellow pietists. We read of juridical pronouncements against pietists,accusing them of heresy, which had a ripple effect in the community at large. Itis occasionally possible to distinguish between popular and scholarly oppos-ition, although it is not always clear where one ends and the other begins.We likewise hear of prominent individuals, with influence in the commu-nity and even the government, making life difficult for members of themovement. Such was the opposition facing the pietists of Alexandria, whowrote to the Nagid in distress at“the tumult caused by the wicked, who seek toprevent us from engaging in our devotions by various contrivances andmischief.”114We will concentrate on three major cases of criticism: theaccusation of heresy and antinomianism, the condemnation of the imitationof Islamic religious practice, and the concern over the popularization of pietyreserved for prophets and great sages. We will consider each of these criticismsand the responses they elicited in turn.I. Heresy and AntinomianismAccusations of heresy were well known to the world of medieval Sufism. Sufimasters, and occasionally entire orders, deemed heterodox or iconoclastic bymembers of the political establishment, were subject to waves of violentpersecutions by the Islamic authorities.115Sufimasters occasionally took upthe pen in defense of Sufism against juridical opponents.116Without a similarstate apparatus or threat of capital punishment to buttress their authority,Jewish communal leaders resorted instead to the ban of excommunicationwhenever necessary and feasible to enforce communal norms.

In her study of Rabbanite–Karaite relations in the Fatimid period,Marina Rustow has recently shown how communal politics often trumpedideological divisions, while exposing the vulnerability of rabbinic modes ofenforcement in the face of real or potential government interference.117The situation in Ayyubid Egypt was equally complex, though for ratherdifferent reasons. During much of the tenure of Abraham Maimonides, thecomplexity of Jewish power structures was exemplified not in the underuse ofexcommunication and heresy-mongering but in its overuse. The controversyin Alexandria in the 1220s between thenasi, Hodayah b. Jesse, and the Frenchjudge, Joseph b. Gershom, erupted after the former issued writs of excommu-nication on his own personal authority as heir to the Davidic throne. On beingchallenged by Joseph as to his illegitimate authority, Hodayah proceeded toexcommunicate him in turn. Rather than stop there, Hodayah branded Josephand the entire French community in Egypt as heretics and corporealists.Joseph, for his part, argued that Hodayah’s illegitimate charge of excommu-nication turned back on himself, thus effectively excommunicating Hodayahin return. In response to this affair, and in the hopes of putting an endto this state of communal anarchy, the Nagid issued a formal ban on anywrit of excommunication not signed by a formal synod of local rabbinicauthorities.118An even more vivid illustration of the disparate use of communal authorityduring this period is evident in the controversy over Egyptian pietism. Inresponse to the perceived excesses and heretical anomalies of some pietists, anumber of rabbinic judges across Egypt (whose names are not preserved)initiated a campaign to excommunicate and brand these individuals as heret-ics. The original accusations have not survived, but we do possess the rejoinderissued by the Nagid in the form of a circular to the judges under his jurisdic-tion, urging caution and restraint. The circular is undated, but the handwritingof the Nagid is unmistakable.119Two distinct messages emerge quite clearlyfrom the Nagid’s letter. He was,first and foremost, unswerving in defense ofhis fellow pietists, openly rebuking the judges for exceeding their expertise andhence their authority to act. Those judges whose accusations were found to beunjustified, he cautioned, were to face the very penalty of excommunicationthey sought to impose on the pietists.Judges and adjudicators (al-dayyanim wa’l-muftiyīn) are not permitted to renderjudgment on ascetics and devotees (al-zuhhādwa’l-‘ibād), without havingattained an advanced level in their path and knowledge of its relationship and117See M.

Stories related in the Talmud bear witness to the fact that notevery judge is pious and that pious individuals occupy a higher rank thanjudges...120Only those121should judge [in such cases] who take into consider-ation the state of the ascetics and devotees and others among the pietists(al-ḥasidim) and render an accurate account of their affairs. Whenever theyhear a rumor that one of them has a fault or deficiency in their belief, they shouldnot [...]affirm what they hear...since most people have an aversion to theadherents of these disciplined paths due to its being so different from what theyare accustomed to...Rather [the judges] should proceed with caution andinquire with great discernment...and confer with them repeatedly on what heheard about them until their situation becomes clear...If the investigationshould prove...that they are innocent of the slander and accusations of theiropponents, the latter shall receive the punishment they sought, just as Godcommanded regarding a false witness:“You shall do unto him that which heplanned to do unto his fellow”(Deut. 19:19).122The situation underlying the Nagid’s defense is of major importance for thehistory of the pietist movement, although many of the key details eludeadequate reconstruction. It is evident that the judges did not initiate theaccusations in each case, but sometimes responded to rumors of unorthodoxpractices circulating in the community at large (“whenever they hear arumor...”). It is likewise clear from the Nagid’s account that the cries ofheresy took a variety of forms, including doctrinal deviation and heterodoxbehavior. Assuming the importance of the language of asceticism and asceticsthroughout the letter, it is plausible that heretical doctrine and hereticalbehavior overlapped in the judges’accusations, including an emphasis oncelibacy as a legitimate option and the encouragement of solitary prayer asan alternative to public worship, to name two controversial examples amongmany.123The Nagid hinted in response that, even when not immediatelyevident, most pietist practices arefirmly rooted in Jewish tradition and thatit is the task of each judge to assess“its relationship and place within the law.”The Nagid added the backhanded barb that the pietist devotee occupies ahigher spiritual rank than the learned judge before whom he stands accused.This polemic was something of a refrain for the Nagid, who elsewheredescribed the pietist path as“more elevated”than that of“scrupulous”120This sentence and a damaged portion at the bottom of the page too difficult to decipherappear in the text as a marginal addition.121I readhā’ulā’iafter consulting the manuscript.

Without openly acknowledging the legitimacy of the judges’charges, the Nagid did not dismiss them outright, and left the door open forre-examination. As the public face of the movement, Abraham took a specialinterest in maintaining the orthodoxy of the groups under his influence and inresponding to the more egregious cases of deviation. In a nod to the judges, theNagid affirmed their jurisdiction to investigate suspected heresy at the sametime that he cast doubt over their expertise in pietism. In a carefully wordedclause, he admitted that there may be pietists who have deviated from theproper course, in deed or doctrine, but who can be brought back to the foldwith patience and persuasion. While admonishing the judges for their unduezealotry with one breath, he acknowledged with the next that genuine cases ofblasphemy and heresy require due vigilance on their part.Should inquiry and investigation prove [...], after patient deliberation anddiscussion, that there was nothing wrong with their ways other than lack ofguidance or unrestrained, even blasphemous speech, have them restrain theirtongues and limit their speech. Should [investigation prove] laxity in any of thereligious requirements, due to inadvertence or error, they should be made torepent. But should inquiry and investigation prove, after the utmost deliberation,that there is doctrinal deviation (fisādi‘itiqād), even of a single Jewish doctrine, orsomething that can lead to doctrinal deviation, should they not cease after beingordered to and not repent after being told to, they shall then be punished just likeone who corrupts and leads astray.125The acknowledgment of the existence of isolated heretics appears to have beenpart of a political calculation on the part of the Nagid, who may have sought tomarginalize extreme cases so as to ensure that the majority of normativepietists were not swept up in a frenzy of condemnation. He likewise distin-guished between genuine antinomianism and occasional utterances charac-terized by“unrestrained, even blasphemous speech”—a likely parallel to theSufitradition of ecstatic utterances, including the well-known cases of Bustāmīand al-Ḥallāj.126But if the latter can be controlled with moderate persuasionand admonition, the Nagid showed little patience for antinomian heresywithin his ranks. An entire chapter of theCompendiumwas devoted to theprinciple that even the elect“remnant whom the Lord calls,”127those whohave advanced in the pietist path, are never exempt from the minute dictates124SeeSM, 105.125Bodl.

The creditor will not take the gift and relinquish hisdebt.”130This is part of what is meant by the verse [enumerating] His attributes,“He will not take [a bribe]”(Deut. 10:17)131...You who seek to ascend to thelevel of the elect and to pursue the special paths of the Lord, the path of the piousof Israel and the disciples of the prophets...know that ten years of fastingthrough pietism (ḥasidut) is squandered by eating a single piece of food stolenor robbed!

He dismissed“those who adopt thepaths of asceticism and piety and devotion without any knowledge of thelaw...who do not know what the master has required,”134insisting thatthe obligation to keep the law does not abate at any stage of the pietist path.Similar appeals tofidelity to the law were made by other pietist leaders,including Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘, who argued in a polemical context thatthe laws incumbent on all Israel were instituted for the sake of drawing near toGod, and as such are indispensable to all pietists in their pursuit of theultimate goal.135II. Imitation of Islamic WorshipThe biblical prohibition on following in the ways of the Canaanite (andEgyptian) nations became the basis for a series of early rabbinic stricturesfrom the Greco-Roman period aimed at stemming the influence of“idol-atrous”culture on Jewish life.136None of the warnings against following theways of the gentiles concerned actual idolatry, which was considered a separ-ate prohibition.137A distinction was traditionally made between idolatryproper and the fashions and amusements of the society classified as idolatrous.For this reason, the chief examples of the“imitation of gentile practice”(ḥuqqot ha-goyim) mentioned by the rabbis of late antiquity were those ofpopular Roman culture, such as the theater, the circus, and fashions of hairand dress,138although a few were aimed at distancing aspects of ritual life from134II Firk.

See also TS Arabic Box 46.71, 2r,ll. 1–12, published by Fenton,“Some Judaeo-Arabic Fragments,”63–4. A similar exhortation tokeep the commandments and refrain from transgression in the context of the spiritual path canbe found in the anonymous pietist work published by Fenton,“A Mystical Treatise on Prayer,”149–50. See esp. 150:“According to the attainment of the commandments is the attainment oflikeness unto God”(fa-iḏāḥaṣala al-insānfī’l-miṣvot hakaḏāḥaṣala al-munāsabah).136The biblical prohibition derives from Lev. 20:23, but see also Lev. 18:3 and Deut. 12:30.The object of the verses in Leviticus was originally the sexual offenses of the Egyptians andCanaanites, whom the Israelites were exhorted not to follow. The verse in Deuteronomy isconcerned with idol worship and idolatrous sacrifice that it attributed to Canaanite religion. Forearly rabbinic views of the prohibition, see especiallySifraon Lev. 18:3.

It is, to my knowledge, thefirst recorded case in which a group of Jewsstood accused of imitating the rites of another religion. It is evident from theNagid’s account that rebutting these accusations was critical to legitimatingthe movement from within the tradition. The accusation of imitating gentileworship was even more weighty when leveled at the head of the Jews,constituting an open challenge to his legitimacy as religious authority ofEgyptian Jewry. The Nagid devoted two sections of theCompendiumtorefuting these claims, thefirst as one of seven preambles on controversialtopics in the work as a whole, which sadly has not survived, and the second ina separate unit responding to anti-pietist criticism, from which the followingpassage is drawn:141[I]t has been said that the gentiles worship in this way and that it should thereforebe prohibited so as not to imitate the gentiles (laylā’yatashabbiha bil-goyim)...This specious claim has been stated and misconstrued by one of those consideredscholars in our time in his prohibition of facing the ark (qiblah) while sitting,whose obligation and proofs I have explained, on account of the fact that thegentiles sit thus in their prayers.

What appears atfirst to be three practices,however, turns out on closer inspection to be four. The requirement to face thedirection of prayer, orqiblah, while sitting is bound up with the sitting posturemore generally—what Abraham Maimonides termed“devotional sitting”(julūsta‘abbud).145According to this view, sitting was to be performed notonly in the proper orientation but in a kneeling position. Together, thesepractices constitute the core and most visible components of the Nagid’sdevotional reforms, those most conspicuously indebted to the Islamic envir-onment. It was these reforms more than the others that aroused the greatestopprobrium and generated the most opposition in the community.146The marked refrain in each of the scholar’s objections,“on account ofthe fact that the gentiles do thus in their worship,”reflects something of therhetorical force of the original accusation, one the Nagid in his official positioncould not afford to take lightly. While he belittled his challenger as“one ofthose considered scholars in our time,”the dismissal itself testifies to the factthat the individual in question was, in the eyes of the community, a scholar ofsome standing and repute. This impression is confirmed by what follows afterthe passage just quoted. The Nagid acknowledged wryly that the scholar’sobjections were known to the public and had an impact on communalreactions to the reforms.“This specious claim [of the scholar] has prejudicedthe ignorant among the community and those of similarly weak mind who aredeceived with the slightest of specious claims.”147As it turned out, while thescholar in question was equally opposed to all devotional reforms suspected offoreign influence, the community as a whole was particularly agitated over theintroduction of prostration, the most visibly Islamic of the postures.148Abraham Maimonides’primary challenge in theCompendiumwas tosubstantiate the antiquity of the practices associated with Islamic rites inclassical Jewish sources. He was at pains to illustrate, with the support ofbiblical and rabbinic prooftexts, that each of these devotional rites was not newat all but“an ancient mode of worship in Israel”149and“among the ancient143Or:“bowing with one’s face to the ground”(keri‘ah‘al apayim).

This can be observed in hismethod of building normative readings upon circumstantial sources. A classicexample is his frequent use of the Psalms as a source for normative practice.Consider the following example:“The most appropriate places to prostrate asan expression of God’s majesty in our prayers, that is in communal prayer, isduring theqaddishandqedushah, as David...exhorted,‘Glorify the Lord ourGod and prostrate yourselves.’152This is obligatory and necessary and is thepurpose of theqadishandqedushah.”153The appeal to biblical and early rabbinic models was an important strategyin his answer to the challenge ofḥuqqot ha-goyim, as when he wrote concern-ing the kneeling posture:“[O]ne who sits in the state of prayer in a kneelingposition facing theqiblahbecause this is how Daniel and Solomon acted shallnot be prohibited [merely] because this is the way in which the gentiles sit intheir prayers. And one who has prostrated in theqadishand the like becausethus David commanded,‘Glorify the Lord our God and prostrate,’154shall notbe prohibited from this [merely] because the gentiles prostrate thus.”155It goeswithout saying that the ancient postures of Daniel and Solomon and theexhortations of David had no normative force either in their own contextsor for future generations. With the sole exception of prostration, whichsurvived in an altered form during the medieval period,156the classicalrabbinic tradition did not continue these biblical postures but developednew ones in keeping with its new cultural environment and sociopoliticaletiquette.157In the creative hands of Abraham Maimonides, however, both theexempla and the exhortations of the biblical saints were no mere spontaneousor poeticized prayers. They were, in thefirst case, normative precedent and, inthe second, direct commands to the individual and community in worship to150SM, 150:min qadīm siyar yisrael.151Abraham attached a special importance to prostration out of all the postures, calling it“the highest form of exertion in outer worship”(nihāyat al-ijtihādfī’l-‘ibādah al-ẓāhirah), and“the most elevated posture in devotion”(nihāyat marātib hay’at al-ta‘abbud).

This is the case inthe matter concerning us here, that of prostration, which we are now discussing.For prostration is an obligation of the law and ancient custom of the people, a factneglected over the course of many years in exile. And when one has been madeaware that it is an obligation and puts it into practice, it appears to the deludedand ignorant as if it is a religious innovation.159It is an innovation only inrelation to the intermediate time [in which it was defunct], not in relation tothe time of the original community.160In this brief passage, the Nagid effectively reversed the accusation of innov-ation by describing the community, in their own eyes staunch defenders ofancient custom, as having introduced unwarranted change into the ancientcanon, while recasting the pietists as the restorer of authentic and orthodoxpractice.161Developing this idea further, the Nagid asserted that it is the gentiles whohave imitated the Jews in adopting parts of the Torah, such as fundamentalprinciples and beliefs in the case of Islam and the acceptance of the sanctity ofscripture in the case of Christianity. In this respect, there is a distinct echo ofhis father’s notion, articulated in theMishneh Torah, that these religions haveserved to prepare the world for the Bible and the idea of monotheism and themessiah.162Abraham Maimonides connected this doctrine with the biblicalideal of becoming a“kingdom of priests”and a beacon of light for the nationsof the world:158Note Abraham Maimonides’use of“David commanded”(amara David) in his citation ofPs. 99.159The charge of innovation was a serious one as much for Islam as for Judaism during thisperiod. The usual term for innovation in the Islamic sources wasbid‘ah, which Goitein wrote wasused in the context of the pietist debates as well. See S. D. Goitein,“New Documents from theCairo Geniza,”inHomenaje a Millás Vallícrosa(Barcelona: Consejo Superior de InvestigacionesCientíficas, 1954), I: 712, and“A Treatise in Defence of the Pietists,”108. Although this term wasin fact not used in the sources at our disposal, a point already made by Fenton, the concept andaccusation of innovation were very much present in this context.

The argumenthere was quite different from the former. While the Byzantine scholar openlyconceded that these practices were used in antiquity, as recorded in numerousbiblical narratives, he contended that they were later prohibited once theybecame adopted by gentiles in their worship. Basing his argument on therabbinic proscription of stone altars once they became incorporated intoidolatrous worship, he maintained that their use by Muslims had taintedthese forms for Jewish worship and may no longer be performed as a result.167In his lengthy retort, the Nagid declared that were it not for the reverence inwhich this scholar was held and the widespread use of his argument byscholars and non-scholars alike, he would have considered it beneath him to163I readmilḥunāaccording to the original reading of the manuscript rather than Dana’semendation tomillatunā.164SeeSM, 152.

If the opponents of the rites acknowledged theirbasis in the law and yet abandoned them for having been tainted by associ-ation with the gentiles, logic compels them to forsake a good many othercommandments and principles of the Torah shared by Jew and gentile alike.The rhetorical effect of the Nagid’s onslaught was to demonstrate the absurdimplications of his challenger’s claim. The use of the charged idea of“abro-gation”(naskh) as a polemical device was all the more effective as a way ofimputing that the scholar’s arguments went even further than gentile rejectionof the Torah. In the Nagid’sreductio ad absurdum, the gentiles abrogate only aportion of the law, while their Jewish counterparts would go even further ineliminating a majority of commandments!Abraham Maimonides went even further, however, in attempting toexclude Islam from the prohibition ofḥuqqot ha-goyimitself. Referring tothe practice of ablution, he observed that,“Whatever...is not required orencouraged in the law, but is a well-known practice and statute of the gentileswhile not of the traditions of Israel, shall be prohibited if its purpose is toimitate them...”Such would be the case, he continued, if one were to gobeyond the washing of the hands and feet to wash the arms, behind the ears,the fore-hair, or nostrils in the Muslim fashion. Nevertheless, he insisted,“Idonot apply to this [the category of]ḥuqqot ha-goyim, in so far as those whopractice such [things], namely the Ishmaelites, are monotheists (muwaḥḥi-dūn) and prohibit idolatry. All the same, there is no need for an imitation ofthis sort, for what is contained in our law and customs is sufficient.”172It isnoteworthy that Abraham Maimonides described this intriguing view as hisown, yet there is precedent for such an exception in the case of Islam in theGaonic period.173As for his acknowledgement of Islam’s strict monotheism,he closely followed his father’s views on the subject, though such a positionwas unlikely to have aroused much controversy among the majority of Jewsliving under Islam.174It is interesting to observe that, in spite of his exception of Islam from theprohibition of imitation, Abraham appears to have accused others of asimilar violation. His accusations include cases of imitating both Muslimsand Christians, although it is the former that occupy us here in light of theapologetic context of theCompendium.Thefirst and most important of these,172SM, 157–8.

[It is likewise necessary] that the oil kept in theimmediate vicinity of the ark177be olive oil and that [all] the lighting in the rest ofthe synagogue likewise be made from the purest and most illuminating of oils,and that the extent of the candelabra or the candles be enough to illumine the[entire] space completely and thoroughly. But one should not be excessive in thisas we observe [people] doing with exorbitant amounts of lighting by settingnumerous candles in imitation of the lighting of the gentiles (muḥākātan li-waqīd al-goyim) in their places of worship. On some occasions, this amusementreaches the point of selecting the orderly arrangement of the candles and varyingthe colors of the waters between red, green, and yellow, according to patternsmore befitting the places for the festivals of the gentiles (’alyaq bi-mawāḍi‘afrāḥal-goyim) than [those] of Israel’s worship, called“holy”and consisting of piousand religious people, on the whole. This should be lamented and prevented as faras possible.178Abraham Maimonides was in general accord with his coreligionists on thespecial importance attached to the quality of lightfixtures in the synagogues.I know of no other halakhic manual from this period, including his father’scomprehensive code, that so much as mentions the particulars of synagoguemaintenance, let alone goes into such minute detail on the subject.179Hisrejection of extravagance in this area is all the more important as a result. Onecan only imagine that the excessive lighting was noticeable to all and com-monly compared with that found in neighboring mosques. The Nagid’s chargeof“imitating the lighting of the gentiles,”however, is more comprehensible inthe case of the special arrangements of lighting and colored water reserved byboth communities for holy days.180On another occasion, the Nagid accused175On this type of lamp (atbāq) in medieval Egyptian synagogues, see Goitein,Med.

Equally significant for the entirecontroversy ofḥuqqot ha-goyimis the fact that both the imitation and its accusation stronglysuggest an intimate knowledge of the interior adornment of mosques on the part of the generalJewish population and its Nagid. Whether or not the Nagid’s assertion, already noted, thatadditional (supererogatory) ablutions would constitute imitation of the gentiles was directed atspecific Jews of his own day remains an open question.

The Problem of InclusionAbraham Maimonides’appeal for synagogue and devotional reform wasintricately linked with his efforts to encourage others in the community tojoin in pietist worship. As shown earlier in this chapter, pietist prayer circlesincluded a cross-section of the Egyptian community, including scholars andlaymen, men and women, adults and children alike. The objections to thescope of the pietist reforms were therefore directed as much at their theoreticalambitions as at their implementation in practice. Once again the challengecame from rival scholars with some influence in the community at large. Thesescholars accepted prostration and the like as praiseworthy in and of them-selves, but feared their vulgarization in the hands of the masses. Rather thanencourage unworthy individuals to adopt the ways of the saints, they viewedprostration as something“to be kept secret [such that] not anyone whatsoeverundertake it but only a highly learned individual...imbued with religiosityand correct belief, in such a way that only a prophet or great pious man orsomeone resembling them may approach it, and even then only in secret andnot in public view.”As the Nagid attested,“I have seen this argument wieldedmany times by those who have the audacity to issue legal pronouncements,saying‘Not all who make a claim to greatness may do so.’”182As a result, headded,“the gullible community has been deceived [by the scholars] in theirpoor ignorance...to the point that some of them deprecate the practice ofprostration as suspect...”183Influences, 17, though this cannot be determined with certainty on the basis of the source in theCompendiumalone.181SeeSM, 159.182SM, 167, citing from M Berakhot, 2:8.

Simeon b.Gamaliel that even one who wants to recite theshema‘(i.e. to take hold of the divine name) onhis wedding night ought not to do so on account of his distraction. My translation of the phrasefollows Maimonides’commentary to this Mishnah. SeePerush ha-Rambam le-Avot, ed. Shailat,66. The phrase was adapted quite freely in this polemical context.

Hisanswer to the skeptics was twofold. Hisfirst approach was to underscorethe non-elitist teachings of the biblical and rabbinic traditions. There is,he admitted, an esoteric body of knowledge known as“the mysteries of theTorah”(sitre Torah), associated in rabbinic lore with the account of creationand the vision of Ezekiel.184He cautioned against drawing a false connectionbetween this esoteric tradition and other domains of the religious life.They are not mysteries because they have an underlying or misleading or dubiousmeaning, such that we are afraid of their becoming known, may God shield usfrom such a thought! Nor is it [due to] a niggardly attitude toward most Jews andthe intention that the elite be superior to the community. For this would be a viletrait, condemned by reason and prohibited by law, since the law commandedprecisely the opposite:“You shall love your neighbor as yourself”(Lev. 19:18). Itis rather that most minds have difficulty grasping the mysteries of the Torah, suchas the account of creation, the account of the chariot, and other matters that aresimilarly abstruse and subtle, without intellectual training...But there is nothingso exalted about the posture of prostration that should keep it from being taught,as if only someone with powers of perception and immense learning shouldapproach it. If someone says this, let this be their answer: O fool! It is even moreappropriate to apply this idea to prayer! For prostration only cultivates meeknessand humility in the one prostrating through [physical] enactment, [downward]movement, and placement [upon the ground]. Prayer, on the other hand, consistsof language and speech, the mention of God’s attributes, glorification, supplica-tion, intercession, thanksgiving, and confession. And how many majestic andexalted matters and great mysteries did I allude to when I explained the meaningsof the blessings ofshema‘and the‘amidah!185Yet not a single [sage], whetherancient or modern, claims that only one who is religiously virtuous and perfect inknowledge should pray, as if the community should not utter these prayersbecause they are not worthy of them!186The many forms of speech in prayer enumerated by the Nagid in this passageconstitute“a form of audacity,”in contrast with the simplicity of prostration,directed solely at“the glorification of the One before Whom one prostratesand the aim of humility and a posture of awe in the one prostrating. All ofthese are matters which logic and reason enjoin upon everyone alike.”187According to the description in the passage cited above, prostration“cultivatesmeekness and humility”through the physical gestures themselves. The veryact of lowering one’s body to the ground in humble submission not only184See BT Ḥagigah 13a and Maimonides’introduction to part two of theGuide.For an application of the principle ofsitre Torahby Abraham elsewhere, seeTeshuvot, 47, no. 43.185The section of theCompendiumdealing with the meanings of these prayers is no longerextant.186SM, 168–9.187SeeSM, 174–5, and cf.SM, 87, 126–7.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 27/6/2015, SPi86Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"testifies to a prior state of reverence in some, but actually creates such anattitude in others. It embraces the most experienced of pietists and theuninitiated in a single community. To those who objected that these postureswere too demanding for all to perform, the Nagid spoke of their spiritual andethical benefits for combating inner vices, and thus their benefit to worshipersof all levels.“Of the [religious] obligations and recommendations I havedescribed, there is no great physical exertion. To the contrary, they areexceedingly easy! The great exertion in them is entirely aimed at one’s lessernature, which leads to arrogance, envy, baseness, and vice.”188Abraham’s second answer to the skeptics on the question of inclusivity isequally important for an appreciation of the social make-up of pietist prayer.The very premise of the pietist reforms was the expectation that they wouldlead to a revitalization of religious life. Yet in the eyes of its opponents, theinclusion of non-adepts was a sign of the vulgarization of the movement. Inresponse to this challenge, the Nagid invoked the rabbinic principle that,though one must ideally study Torah for its own sake, one is bidden tostudy even in the absence of pure motivation, in the hope that study will itselftransform the student. By the same token, the outer devotions have theintrinsic power to transport the worshiper in the absence of a purermotivation.While it may be true that some [worshipers] do not have full mental concentra-tion in prayer or stand like a learned and pious person or understand the reasonfor facing the sanctum like one who is learned, it is nevertheless incumbent on allpeople without exception to prostrate, even if one is not aware—in the very act ofprostration—of the majesty of the One before Whom he is prostrating, [even if]—at the moment of outwardly throwing one’s face to the ground—one’s heart is notbroken and trembling within in the presence of God...A true confirmation ofthis is [the talmudic tradition that]“One should always immerse oneself in theTorah even if not for its own sake, for from an impure motive may come a puremotive...”189The prostration of an ignorant person or a young child and theirimitation of one who is older or nobler in disposition is therefore essential, foreven from an impure motive one may come to a pure motive. The basic point isthat worship is shared by all alike. Neither scripture nor reason justifies limiting itto the select few.190188SM, 185. See, however,SM, 125, where the Nagid described these postures as being of“some difficulty.”His purpose in this source was not so much to persuade his readers as todescribe the practice.189See, e.g., BT Pesaḥim 50b. On this important topic, see C. Cohen,“‘Not for its Own Sake’:The Value of Divine Worship‘for an Impure Motive’,”Me‘aliot18 (1997), 129–36.

His efforts at a broad revivalreflect his concern for the religious potential of the general community ratherthan a self-selected group of devotees. This in itself helps explain his formid-able efforts to draw as many people as possible, of all ages and capacities, intohis circle. His goal was nothing short of a spiritual renewal at every level ofsociety. For this reason, the connection between his two public roles, ascommunal and pietist leader, was a natural and necessary one, not only todefend the movement from its opponents but to bring the fruits of religiousrevival to the community at large.

It was marked,first andforemost, by a demanding regimen of supererogatory devotion and asceticdiscipline, only to be undertaken by the most sincere devotees, who therebyearned the epithetḥasidim.1Abraham Maimonides’role as spiritual directorof a conventicle of pietist“companions”(aṣḥāb) in Fustat was dedicated to thetraining of individual devotees by means of a regimen of strenuous practices,from fasting and nightly prayer to solitary retreats and meditation. Abrahamreferred to this discipline as the“special path”of the pious“remnant whomthe Lord calls,”not to be undertaken casually or without total devotion to anascetic way of life. In addition, Egyptian pietism was distinguished by aconcerted effort to reform and revitalize public worship from what wasperceived to be generations of corruption and decay over the course of theexile. Its pursuit of synagogue reform, unlike its ascetic regimen, was intendedfor the renewal of religious worship in the community as a whole. It vieweditself as a spiritual vanguard and a model for others to follow. As in theprevious case, its novel features were depicted as a return to origins, yet bearthe unmistakable impact of the Islamic environment. But, if the latter soughtto revive long obsolete customs of biblical and talmudic worship, the formerlooked for inspiration from the tradition of the ancient prophets and thecontemporary practice of Sufimystics. The Nagid’s efforts to reform theprayer life of the people will occupy our attention in Chapter three. We turnat present to the ideals and institutions that distinguished Egyptian pietismamong the community as a whole dedicated to a life of voluntary prayer andspiritual discipline.The emphasis on practical discipline over theosophical doctrine, whichcharacterized Egyptian pietism from its inception, bears an interesting resem-blance to the early development of Sufism. Long before Sufism developed acoherent system of doctrines and common spiritual ideals, it was distinguished1For the epithets by which the pietists were known, see p. 53, n. 40.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 27/6/2015, SPi"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"by a spirit of strict asceticism and renunciation of worldly goods.2Its earliestexponents were known as“those who renounce the world”(al-zuhhādfīal-dunyā) and“those who constantly weep”(al-bakkā’ūn) in fear of divinejudgment. Theirs was a practical spirituality, uninterested in theologicalspeculation or mystical secrets. As one of the foremost modern scholars ofSufism put it,“thefirst ascetic tendencies in Basra and its environment,”bestexemplified in the school of Ḥasan al-Baṣrī(d. 728) and his disciples,“werealmost exclusively devotional and lacked any interest in speculative thought.”3A similar impulse animated the early pietist movement, which, as we saw inthe previous chapter, found its strongest expression and its earliest activity inthe realm of ascetic praxis.4A doctrinal literature did develop over the courseof the thirteenth century and beyond, but much if not most of this was devotedto an elaboration on, and exhortation toward, pietist practice.5All indicationssuggest that when pietists were enjoined to embrace a life of“practice andknowledge”(al-amal wa’l-‘ilm), knowledge of the pietist path was understood,first and foremost, as a gnosis oriented toward a life of practical discipline.6An interest in devotional praxis is less immediately apparent, but just asfundamental, in the Sufi-inflected Jewish pietism of Baḥya ibn Paquda, whichpredated the Egyptian movement by at least a century. Following on the heelsof the Judaeo-Arabic rationalist tradition of Iraq and al-Andalus, Baḥyaexhibited an overriding interest in the theoretical foundations of his subject,even as his ultimate purpose was to implement the fruits of his speculationinto a life of spiritual virtue. In his introduction to theDuties of the Heart,Baḥya laid the foundations of rational inquiry and scholarly investigation intothe demands of the religious life, from which the imperative of the inner dutiesemerges as the necessary conclusion.“I inquired regarding the duties of the2For an overview of this transition conceived as a linear development, see I.

He advised his reader to undertake“voluntary fasts during the day,if one’s body is capable of enduring it, and voluntary prayer each night...andsolitary meditation in remembrance (dhikr) of God,8may He be glorified andmagnified, and intimacy (uns) in His presence during the time when every loveris alone with his beloved...as scripture says,‘My soul desires You at night’(Is.26:9), and‘Upon my bed each night [I have sought the one my soul desires]’(Song of Songs 3:1).”9To this end, Baḥya included two lengthy prayers of hisown composition at the end of his work, one a rebuke to the soul (tokhaḥah)and the other verses of praise and petition (baqqashah), which he recommendedbe recited as part of the voluntary prayer of the pietist.10But he added thefollowing prescription for the interested devotee:“One who takes upon himself[to read these prayers], should take upon himself to pray thetokhaḥahin aseated position...and afterwards pray thebaqqashahwhile standing andprostrating until the end,11then he should rise and recite any other supplica-tions he chooses, after which he should follow this with‘Happy are theupright...’(Ps. 119: 1),12and‘Song of ascents’(Ps. 120:1), until the end.”13The core of Baḥya’s ascetic regimen, based on the medieval Sufiascetic idealof daily fasting and nightly prayer (ṣiyām wa-qiyām), may have served as thefoundation for private pietist devotions in Andalusia and North Africa, ofwhich some evidence has survived.14The same core elements were later to7SeeKitāb al-Hidāyah ilāFarā’iḍal-Qulūb, Maqor ve-Targum, ed.

As this chapter illustrates in somedetail, the heart of the movement was to be found not so much in specu-lative theology as in practical discipline.Our survey of the social and intellectual background of the pietist move-ment in the previous chapter may now be rounded out with a description ofthe key principles and practices of its devotional regimen, some of whichwere conducted within the Nagid’s conventicle, while many continued to beperformed in isolation. As already noted, I have set aside our considerationof the Nagid’s devotional prayer reforms, which he did not view as part ofthe ascetic discipline of the pietist elite but as part of the spiritual renewal ofthe people as a whole, for a separate analysis in Chapters three and four.While the subjects of these two chapters are conceptually distinct andrequire separate treatment, it must be borne in mind that they are practicallyand institutionally linked, in so far as they were each exclusively foundwithin the pietist movement.

Hofer suggested that Sufiinstitutions should beconceived not as the physical structures (such as thezāwiyah,khānqāh,ribāṭ,ormadrasah), but as“the systematization and formalization of doctrine,terminology, and practices”that had developed as early as the tenth oreleventh centuries.19Hofer therefore identifies the thirteenth century not asa period of institutionalization but of organization and expansion, viewing theJewish pietists as yet another example of self-identified Sufis in Egypt whosought to utilize preexisting doctrines and practices toward their own ulteriorends. In so doing, Hofer maintains that the pietists viewed themselves as notonly Sufis, but the only authentic Sufis.20Given the fact that the pietistsstudiously avoided designating themselves as Sufis, whether authentic orotherwise, I am reluctant to read such a bold claim into the sources. YetHofer is no doubt correct that the Jewish pietists creatively appropriated avariety of preexisting Sufiinstitutions—perhaps the most symbolic example,representing the broader shift toward a formal organizational structure, beingthe place of the spiritual guide at the head of a dedicated circle of disciples.The process of consolidation or organization in Sufism received a majorboost with the ascendency of Saladin in Egypt and the Levant, whosepolicy of generous endowments for legal academies and lodges for Sufibrotherhoods ensured the ongoing stability of the latter in Ayyubid society.21The Jewish pietist movement, from its origins in Andalusia to its growth in18For this development in Sufism, see J.

See Hofer,“Sufism, State, and Society,”20–1.

Here the discontinuity of Egyptianpietism from the earlier activity of Baḥya ibn Paquda is particularly evident.For all his emphasis on the ladder of ascent and the systematization of aspiritual–ethical discipline and doctrine, Baḥya never once advocated a formatof training under the guidance of ashaikh, nor did he cite at any point fromthe famous dictum from Mishnah Avot to“acquire yourself a master,”aninjunction that was to become fundamental to later developments in Egypt.22The parallel with Sufidevelopments of mystical discipleship is largely self-evident, but the formation of an organized system of fellowship must beconsidered as part of a complex historical evolution. The pietist movement,not unlike its Islamic counterpart, incorporated the model of a spiritual guideas increasing numbers of pietist seekers of varied levels of training began tocoalesce around charismatic and venerated leaders. The development of pietistbrotherhoods, known collectively as“fellows”(aṣḥāb) and“fellowships”(ṣuḥ-bah) after their Suficounterparts,23should be viewed as a sign of the matur-ation of the movement in Jewish society, whose main lines of development wetraced in the previous chapter. It is not unlikely, given what we know of thediversity of Egyptian pietism, that multiple, and even competing, circles ofmasters and disciples proliferated in this environment.24Ashaikhwas expect-ed to have undergone considerable training on the spiritual path and berecognized as a moral paragon before consenting to impart something of hisexperience to his willing disciples.25Apart from regular devotions performedin common, pietist fellowships were primarily a series of independent rela-tionships between a single master and multiple disciples, each of whompursued separate trajectories and specialized training from theshaikh.2622See M Avot, 1:6 and 1:16.23On these and related terms, see TS 10J13.8, l. 16 and TS 12.289r, l. 10, and cf.HW, II:82,l. 19.

It is for this reason that the biblical model of“the disciples of theprophets”(bene ha-nevi’im) was so vital to the Nagid and his colleagues, asubject tied to the revival of prophecy among the pietists, to which we shallreturn in Chapter six.36Seen in this light, Sufimodelswere transformed byEgyptian pietists into Sufiimitationsof the ancient prophets of Israel:“Con-sider, then, these wondrous traditions and grieve at how they were removedfrom us, appearing in a different nation while disappearing among us!”37In the previous chapter, we observed that Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘and hisbrother Joseph functioned as early leaders of the nascent movement and were30See the above description of the master,HW, II:326, ll. 9–10:...wa-sabara al-mujāhadahtajribatan wa-qata‘a‘urūḍahāwa-salima min akhṭāriha wa-waṣala ilānihāyatiha...31The Nagid used the termtafā’utto describe the variations among the disciples of the pietistpath.

Although the details remain obscure, a rough outline of the dispute is notdifficult to decipher.50Abner, a loyal pietist disciple, was informed by theNagid of a former member of the fellowship, still living in Fustat, who had notonly defected from the group but appears to have been stirring up somecontroversy for the embattled pietist circle. This is in addition to the slanderof another individual, perhaps also a lapsed pietist and connected with thefirst, now residing in Syria or Palestine.51In what is certainly the mostinteresting detail of the letter, Abner pleaded with his former colleague notto mention him any longer, while the damage already caused by both indi-viduals was a desecration of God’s name, requiring them to“beg forgivenessfrom him”for the rest of their days.52The specification“from him”suggeststhat the damage done by these individuals, presumably both lapsed disciples,was directed against Abraham Maimonides and his circle.53The details of the letter are equally revealing of some of the inner workingsof the pietist conventicle (majlis) belonging to the Nagid.

One whoguides others in piety, he maintained, must“adopt external humility in thecompany of those whom he guides, in order for them to be trained throughhim (li-yuta’addabūbihi) and for them to follow his path by learning fromhim and imitating him. In this way, he will instruct them in the path of theLord and help them to progress in it.”64According to the therapeutic model of“spiritual striving”(mujāhadah) and“discipline”(riyāḍah), developed in large part from the ethical theory ofMaimonides,65Abraham stressed that one must continue to combat theworldly attachments of the soul“until the spiritual perfections become pref-erable, desirable, [and] pleasurable, while the physical pleasures of the bodyare despised and scorned, so that one is disturbed by them, becoming like acharacteristic (ka’l-malakah) of the soul. At this time, one can dispense withextreme spiritual exertion (yustaghnī‘an mujāhadah qawīyah).”66Theshaikhon his own, according to the Nagid’s model, no longer requires the disciplineof outer humility beyond the basic requirements of the law.67As a leader andguide of his disciples, on the other hand, he must adopt (yu‘tamid) this outerdemeanor to serve as a model for his followers to imitate in their own quest toattain the spiritual virtues.Maimonides as more significant, when he wrote:“I have no doubt that...this title wasmentioned in every public announcement in which his name occurred.”See Goitein,Med.Soc., V:483.

Sleeplessness and hunger became basicelements of spiritual training in Sufiliterature, with a wide variety of customsarising according to individual temperament.68The two practices of self-denial were considered intertwined and are known in classical Sufisourcesas a pair:“fasting and nightly vigils”(ṣiyām wa-qiyām).69As we observedearlier, Baḥya ibn Paquda was thefirst Jewish pietist to incorporate theseclassic Sufipractices into his brand of Jewish spirituality, although it appearsfrom his own account that a practice of early morning or pre-dawn hymns wasobserved in a number of Andalusian Jewish communities, as when he referredto“the customary hymns”(al-zemirot al-mu‘tādah) familiar to his reader inthis context.70A hint of this early practice is also found in a Gaonic responsum, whichdescribes“a pious custom”(middat ḥasidut) of rising at midnight to recitesupererogatory hymns of praise before morning prayers in the synagogue.71Traces of this ideal in rabbinic literature are quite old, although preciseinformation on the origin of the practice is lacking.72Thefirst attestation ofsuch a practice in Egypt comes from a query posed to Maimonides:“Instructus concerning one who rises during the night to recite supererogatory prayersor [hymns of] praise or [biblical] verses or chapters of Psalms73until dawn oruntil the time for the recitation of theshema‘. Is one obligated to make theblessing on the Torah beforehand or not?”74Maimonides’reply does not addany new information on the ritual, although the question confirms both theexistence of this practice in twelfth-century Egypt and Maimonides’awareness68See Schimmel,Mystical Dimensions of Islam, 114–17.69See the discussion of fasting and nightly vigils in Suhrawardī,‘Awārif al-ma‘ārif,A.

The question should most likely be viewed in light of the customdescribed by his son in theCompendiumof reciting the“morning blessings”on waking, whether it is already morning or in the pre-dawn hours as part ofthe nightly vigil. As he described it,“These blessings...are to be recited onlyonce a day, either at daybreak or toward the end of the night (fī...ākhiral-lail), when one has arisen from slumber.”75The earliest testimony on nightly prayer and daytime fasting from thir-teenth-century Egypt suggests that they had become symbolic of pietist dedi-cation. In the Hebrew letter addressing Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘, which I havecited on a number of occasions, he and his brother were praised with thecrown of piety:“[They are] zealous in the service of the Creator of all. Theirnights they spend standing [in prayer] and their days they fast as on the day ofatonement...purging themselves of sin, purifying their souls, and renderingtheir bodies as [luminous as] crystal.”76It has already been observed that vigilsand fasting are known to have been adopted by anyone seeking a reputation ofpiety on account of their well-known association with the movement.77Thepractice of nightly prayer vigils, in particular, came to be considered a definingpractice of pietism.78Among the truly devout, nightly vigils could be per-formed in solitude as a form of meditation or among fellow pietists ingatherings for supererogatory prayer, distinguished by frequent bowings andprostrations.79Much like what we learn from the query to Maimonides,pietists would rise in the middle of the night and spend thefinal hours beforedawn in voluntary prayer and meditation.80Here, too, Abraham acknow-ledged the indebtedness of the pietists to Sufipractice, but only insofar as the75SeeSM, 247.76TS 20.148,recto, ll. 10–13.

Nightly vigils were viewed asoccasions for spiritual inwardness and solitude, not for lamenting the exile orthe destruction of Jerusalem. A passage fromThe Treatise of the Pool, thepietist tract of Abraham’s son Obadiah, may suggest another way to under-stand the inducement of tears. Obadiah encouraged his readers to cast asidetheir attachment to worldly matter that has separated them from the Lord, andto seek repentance and supplication in nightly prayer.We have turned aside from the soul so that it has become tarnished like a mirrorthat no longer reflects any light, because of its sin in forsaking [its own] improve-ment (al-iṣlāḥ). Therefore I recommend to you that you seek His face, may He beexalted, when you are free from the burdens of matter. When Satan rests, rise inthe dark of night to greet Him (tawājuhahu), may He be exalted, in supplicationand submission (bi’l-taḥanun wa’l-taḍarru‘).89Obadiah’s exhortation for the practice of the vigil in theTreatise of the Poolsuggests that it may have served, for some if not a majority of pietists, as a timeof repentance from the attachments to the world and a private supplication ofdivine grace from past transgression.90The praise of weeping as a sign ofsincerity would be perfectly in keeping with the introspective and supplicatorygoal of the nightly ritual.9188On solitary meditation in pietist practice, see below, esp. pp. 114–122.89Bodl.

SeeHW,II:404, ll. 4–14. It is worth noting in addition that thefinal two sources cited on the vigil mentionthe constant remembrance or mentioning (dhikr) of God.

Ḥanina, who was known to consume no more than a singledry measure (qav) of carobs from one sabbath eve to the next.92The Nagid’sdiscussion of fasting leaves room for speculation as to whether the pietistsmade an exception to their rule of abstinence on the sabbath or viewed theholy day as no different in this respect. On a number of occasions in theNagid’s writings, there is an allusion to what appears to have been the idealsabbath observance toward which fellow pietists ought to strive.

Despite itssurprising implications, I see no reason not to take the Nagid’s words on thediminishment of food and drink on the sabbath as perfectly sincere. Given thatfood, like all other bodily requirements, is an impediment to the soul’s questfor“inner sanctity,”its diminution on the sabbath is most consistent with thespecial bond with the divine, the very attainment of which is the inner purposeof the holy day.101SOLITARY PRAYER AND MEDITATIONIt has already been observed that, while a number of pietist rituals wereperformed in a common gathering (jamā‘ah) connected with a master’s con-venticle (majlis), such as that belonging to the Nagid, the majority consistedof solitary exercises and extensive individual training under the tutelage ofan experienced master. The emphasis on solitude (khalwah)102for privatedevotions and meditations was not self-explanatory and required someexplanation on the part of the pietists, as the general thrust of traditional Jewishpiety was a communitarian one. There is a definite preference for communalprayer expressed in classical rabbinic sources, a view echoed and reinforced byMaimonides, who articulated this preference in his codification of the laws ofprayer as follows:“Communal prayer is always heard and the Holy Blessed One100Perush, 453–5 (Ex. 31:13), and seePerush, 319 (Ex. 20:10).101Abraham’s words need not necessarily be interpreted as advocating fasting on the sabbathso much as a diminution of food intake conducive to intensive contemplation.102This is the most common term for solitary meditation in the pietist sources.

A person oughttherefore to join to a community and should not pray alone whenever it ispossible to pray with the community.”103Abraham’s coda to his affirmation ofthe priority of public prayer, to which we shall presently return in greater detail,provides an indication of the new direction initiated by the pietist movement:“The teachings of [the sages] on the special status of communal prayer arenumerous...including the saying that‘communal prayer is always heard.’Their intention is that this is most often the case (ya‘nūn‘alāal-akthar).”Ashe subsequently added in explanation,“It is altogether possible...that anindividual mayfind increased sanctity and purified concentration in solitaryprayer, such that it is far preferable to communal prayer.”104As is well known, Maimonides’position on solitude is more complex thanthe above citation from his code would initially suggest. In his laws of prayer,Maimonides never went so far as to invalidate private prayer and may haveeven preferred private prayer with appropriate concentration to public prayerlacking the requisite concentration.105It should moreover be recalled that, intheGuide, Maimonides advocated a regular regimen of solitary contemplationconducive to intellectual apprehension. Although Maimonides’subject in thissection of theGuiderefers to“intellectual worship”rather than statutoryprayer, his language foreshadows that used subsequently by his son in theCompendium.“[W]hen you are alone with your soul (fīwaqt khalawātika bi-nafsika), with no one else present...take great care then not to turn yourthoughts during those precious moments to anything other than this intellec-tual worship (al-‘ibādah al-‘aqlīyah), namely closeness to God and being trulyin His presence...”106Maimonides’comments throughout this importantchapter reflect his own genuine longing for such moments of solitude and trueworship, free from the company of society. Yet, as already noted, Maimonides’ideal of“intellectual worship”was never intended as a substitute for commu-nal prayer, nor did he condone (let alone encourage) the fulfillment ofstatutory prayer in solitude.Among the most intriguing developments of Egyptian pietism is the valueattached to individual prayer over and above that of communal prayer in thesynagogue. To be sure, the pietists formed their own prayer circles andmaintained regular public worship as discrete communities. But pietist litera-ture, beginning with that of the Nagid, encouraged private prayer and evendevoted sections of their legal writings on prayer to the requirements of the103MT,“Laws of Prayer,”8:1.

As we shall see in greater detail in Chapter three, an an-onymous pietist treatise on prayer, composed for the benefit of fellow com-panions or disciples, urges its readers to follow the example of the“earlypietists”(ḥasidim ha-rishonim) as described in the Mishnah, by devoting anhour before and an hour after prayer for private meditation.107Stressing theimportance of the preparatory hour for freeing the mind of all worldlydistractions, the author calls us to attention:“[See] what importance [theearly pietists], peace be upon them, attached to the benefits of this hour foremptying one’s mind (tafarrugh) of thoughts and imaginings and removing allthat is hidden in the recesses of one’s heart, whether harmful things one hasheard or destructive things one has seen, from the preoccupation with theworld and the gossip of people and their doings.”108The hour after prayer isboth a“return of the person to himself”and for reflection on the audacity ofhaving stood in the presence of God.“[Let him consider] with what legs hestood, with what arms [outstretched] he made his request, with what tonguehe spoke, with what eyes he contemplated, with what head he prostrated.”109As both public and pietist leader of Egyptian Jewry, Abraham Maimonideswas divided between traditional ideals of communal prayer and pietistdemands of devotional solitude. He confirmed the rabbinic ideal of the prayerquorum, while allowing a measure offlexibility for those drawn to solitaryprayer for the greater concentration it affords. In the passage from theCompendiumcited above, Abraham justified the ideal of public prayer notin terms of the needs of the community but on account of its tangibleeffects on the concentration of each individual within the quorum. As GeraldBlidstein has observed, Abraham was unique in his emphasis on the psycho-logical impact of prayer, whether public or private, on the individual.110“Whenever the concentration of ten individuals who have joined togetherfor prayer...are combined, it is greater than the concentration of each of theten praying individually. These are mysteries revealed by intuition (asrār107See the two tannaitic traditions (baraitot) cited in BT Berakhot 32b compared withM Berakhot 5:1.

That one empties one’s heart of all thoughtsand envisions oneself as if he were standing in the presence of the divine presence.”108See the composite text on prayer published by Fenton,“A Mystical Treatise on Prayer,”152.

Thecontext of private versus public prayer supports the opposite conclusion. Weknow, for example, that the Nagid’s father-in-law went on solitary retreats forweeks at a time, in which all prayer was conducted in isolation. These lengthyretreats, as well as more limited ones, were precisely what Abraham had inmind when discussing the value of private over public prayer. By making thecollective subservient to its individual members, Abraham Maimonides man-aged to preserve the communal ideal of the quorum while justifying occasionalabsences for solitary prayer and meditation.113His remarks are characteristicof the delicate balance he struck throughout his writings as a publicfigurebetween the communal realm and the pietist elite.The considerable emphasis on private prayer in the literature of the Nagidand his contemporaries speaks to a new reality in pietist life that required notonly theoretical consideration but an expansion of the legal categories. Privateworship was more than a mere exception to the communal norm; it hadbecome a legitimate subsection of the overall structure of the laws of prayer, allof which a devotee was now required to know. The Nagid followed his father’slogic of the essence of prayer to its logical conclusion by attributing legalpriority to the individual in worship.114In so doing, Abraham Maimonidesbecame of one the few legal scholars to devote not only passing consideration,but a positive legal value, to the individual in solitary prayer. As it had mostlikely already been during Maimonides’time, private prayer had become areality of contemporary piety that Abraham was compelled to address, onewhich he found reason to support, and which he hoped to incorporate within111The word for mystical intuition, lit.“taste”(dhauq), was a technical term in Sufiparlance. See the discussion of“tasting and drinking”(dhauq wa-shurb) in Qushairī,al-Risālahal-Qushairīyah, 271–2. See alsoSM, 131 and 133. The termdhauqwas also used by the Nagid todesignate an intuition of the hidden meaning of scripture, even if not with a mystical import. SeePerush, 334 (Ex. 21:14).112SM, ed. Dana, 188–9; cf. also his explanation in what follows, that in some cases suchsolitary prayer can become a vehicle for prophecy (SM, 189).113See Blidstein,“Community and Communal Prayer in the Writings of Abraham Maimoni-des,”esp. 154–5.114On the essence of prayer as defined by the individual in Maimonides’code, see Blidstein,Prayer in Maimonidean Halakha,23–5, 77–95, and see 154, where he notes that thefirst sevenchapters of Maimonides’laws of prayer , before any discussion of communal matters, emphasizethe duties associated with prayer for each individual worshiper.

The followingpassage at the end of a chapter on thefitting place for prayer confirms theparallel terminology employed for public and private prayer in his thought:It must additionally be mentioned in this context what is required of everyindividual when alone in his prayer space at home. It is required that he has adesignated place (maqom qavua‘),116as I have explained, and that this place be inaccordance with his [living] conditions and place of residence, whether as a partof his home set apart for this purpose, or a corner of his house preserved [for this]as far as possible. The mat or carpet that he sits upon [for prayer] should be pureand clean, and if it is possible to have them specially reserved for this purpose,how much the better! This place or corner should be preserved not only fromdisrepair andfilth, but also from dust and the like. And whatever is added to thisand any special caution shown is a sign of greater regard for what is due indevotion to [God], may He be exalted, and provides for greater preparation andsincerity of concentration and a strengthening of the fear of God.117The elaborate details for the proper structure and dedication of place in privateprayer constitute a logical extension of the rules for worship in the publicsphere of the synagogues. This is clearly the case with the recommendation toemploy formal prayer mats, preferably kept pure and dedicated in advance forthis specific purpose.118This is likewise the case with the selection of a“designated place”(maqom qavua‘) in one’s private home, specifically setaside for the purpose of prayer, whether solitary or in an informal worshipcircle, such as those used at the time by Abraham and the pietists and thosemaintained by Maimonides and his colleagues a generation before.119In spite115Blidstein speculated that Maimonides’supplement to his exhortation to communalprayer,“even when sinners are in its midst,”may have been formulated in response to aresistance among some of his contemporaries to praying in the company of sinners, and apreference for solitary prayer. See Blidstein,Prayer in Maimonidean Halakha, 154.116Compare Maimonides’comment, MT,“Laws of Prayer,”5:6:ve-qovea‘maqom li-tefillatotamid.117SM, 113.118The use of special carpets and mats for prayer recall the custom in the mosques and ofIslamic prayer mats. Maimonides already mentioned the use of prayer mats in synagoguesamong the Jews of Arab lands. See MT,“Laws of Prayer,”11:5. Other than this passage in theCompendium, I am unaware of any other reference to private prayer mats among the Jews,parallel to those used by Muslims, outside the mosque. It is worth noting that Abraham’sremarks on the need to keep private prayer mats clean and pure suggest that they were in useamong Egyptian Jews during this period.119As Gerald Blidstein has argued, it is likely that the Nagid took a cue from his father, whoincluded his discussion of the“designated place”not in a chapter devoted to public prayer or thesynagogue but in a chapter on the requirements incumbent on each individual in prayer, whetheralone or in a group.

Abraham Maimoni-des alluded to the practice of“sitting in a devotional manner”(julūs li-‘ibādah)in a synagogue, outside of the context of formal prayer,“for the purification ofthe mind or for meditation on [God], may He be exalted”(li-jam‘fikrahnaḥwahu ta‘ālā).121The two sites singled out by the Nagid for solitary retreat(apart from the mountains and wilderness) are houses and places of worship(al-khalwah fī’l-buyūt wa-mawāḍi‘al-‘ibādah).122In a separate passage fromtheCompendium, discussed in the previous chapter, Abraham also called for acloister of pietist devotees in the context of the synagogue.123In recent studies,Paul Fenton and Mordechai Friedman have both called attention to thebroader significance of the Nagid’s call for such a cloister—the former inlight of the Sufiinstitution of thekhānqāh, and the latter in the context ofMaimonides’earlier interpretations of the tenbaṭlanimof the synagogue.124There is a distinct possibility that Abraham’s ideal cloister, as depictedin the important passage on the ten synagoguebaṭlanim, who“should bepermanently secluded in the synagogue for the recitation of the Torah andto practice solitary devotion,”125had some foundation in contemporarypractice—or, alternatively, that it may have contributed to or inspired a pietistpractice to retreat to a remote synagogue, whether individually or in smallgroups.126One synagogue that appears to have served as a site of solitaryretreat was the venerable“synagogue of Moses”(bet keneset shel MosheRabbenuin Hebrew andkanīsat Mūsāin Arabic), located in Dammūh, onthe west bank of the Nile near the pyramids of Gizah, toward which Egyptian120On the 1205 ban, see the Introduction.

The pietist regimen required that a numberof rites be performed in solitude—whether in a synagogue, at home, or in aremote location—not in the conventicle of the master and the company offellow pietists. As we saw in the previous chapter, the solitary regimen couldand sometimes did pose a challenge for pietists whose family members werehostile to their participation in the movement.131The likelihood that one’sprayer space at home, without the special maintenance employed in thesynagogues, would become compromised by other members of the familyprompted the Nagid to encourage extra precaution and, whenever possible, aseparate area of the home reserved for this purpose.While precise information is lacking on the maintenance and dedication ofprivate prayer circles in Egypt, it is clear that the Nagid was not alone inpromoting the ideal of a reserved space or room at home for pietist devotions.In a recently discovered treatise composed by an anonymous Maghrabi writerwith clear affinities to the Egyptian pietist movement, we encounter anexhortation to maintain a private space for prayer and devotions:“It isdesirable that you have a room in your house or a corner in your room132set aside for meditation on God (li-dhikri’llah),133for reading of scripture, for127On the designation“synagogue of Moses,”see J.

It is clear, however, that such a space wasnevertheless reserved for solitary devotions and meditation even if all standardprayers were recited together with the community.Certain times were reserved by the pietists as especially advantageous forsolitude. One of these, immediately before and after prayer, spent in medita-tion, has already been mentioned. It should also be recalled that the solitarymeditative retreat (khalwah) was considered an important component ofnightly vigils:“For solitary meditation, it is commendable to perform thestanding vigil toward the end of the night and to awaken at midnight...Attimes, one who follows this path does not sleep at all during the nights of hissolitary meditation.”136According to an anonymous pietist tract on prayer,followers of this spiritual discipline were encouraged to spend as much as“anhour or a day or a number of days”in meditation. In special cases, one could“become detached such that one becomes one of those of whom it was said,‘and they had a vision of God and they ate and drank’(Ex. 24:11).”137We arefortunate to possess a letter from the mid-thirteenth century describing a moreextended version of the solitary retreat. The letter, composed by one Benjaminto his friend, Ḥayyim, apparently the son of Ḥananel b. Samuel,138sought tocalm the worried son’s mind over the“journey”undertaken by his father.Eliyahu Ashtor, who published the letter, interpreted this journey as a lengthybusiness trip.139More recently, Paul Fenton has conclusively argued in favor134This is the only case of the termmasjidused for the synagogue of which I am aware.135See II Firk.

Compare also Abraham’s reference to“extended”(aktharīyah) versus“limited”(waqtīyah) solitude,HW, II:386, l. 19. It is interesting to observethat, although Maimonides interpreted this verse as an example of how not to conduct oneself(seeGuide, I:5 inDalālat al-Ḥā’irīn, ed. Qafiḥ, I:32–3), it has been given a positive meaning inpietist exegesis. Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘interpreted it as an indication of the previous fastingthe nobles of Israel had undergone as part of theirkhalwah, followed by eating and drinking.Abraham Maimonides seems to have offered a similar (but simpler) version of this interpretationas one of his suggested readings. He likewise cited an interpretation of Se‘adiah Gaon, though nothis father’s negative interpretation in theGuide.

The commentary on the Song of Songs composed by Abraham ibnAbī’l-Rabī‘suggests that the biblical book known from rabbinic literature as“the holy of holies”may have been a focus of study.149According to the elder pietist, the Song of Songs was given this designationon account of its inner spiritual content,“by means of which one attains theultimate end and noble goal, leading one to the spiritual realm by means ofouter and inner sanctity and by an exceeding love of [God], may He be exalted,and a delight in the recollection of Him and His holy names.”150Study of theSong of Songs and of scripture in general was no less a medium for receivingmystical illumination than prayer or meditation.151The Nagid’s son, Obadiah,148On spiritual study in Abraham Maimonides’writings, seeHW, II:44, ll. 1–3, andHW, 82,l. 18.

In Sufipractice, the forty-day retreat had attained asemi-canonical status by the thirteenth century as part of the ongoing asceticand devotional training of the devotee.153It is mentioned in the letter as apractice initiated by Moses in his two forty-day retreats on Sinai, as it wasperceived to be a core element of the prophetic path that had long since fallenout of practice, subsequently adopted by the Sufis in turn.154In its presentcontext, the forty-day retreat, though substantial (and perhaps even danger-ous) in its own right, was described as a relatively light regimen in comparisonwith lengthier retreats. Ḥananel b. Samuel, the well-known judge of Fustat andfather-in-law of Abraham Maimonides, was apparently well known for under-taking even lengthier retreats.155We can only assume that the practice ofsolitary meditation, whether daily or nightly in one’s home or undertaken onperiodic“journeys”to the surrounding mountainside, was a basic disciplinecommon to pietists and Sufis alike in early thirteenth-century Egypt.156From the pietist literature at our disposal, all types of solitary meditationwere bounded within a given time frame. The shortest described in oursources are an hour, such as those devoted to the preparation for, andtermination of, prayer. But it is noteworthy that even the longest retreatswere circumscribed journeys, after which the pietist was to return to societyand resume a state of relative normalcy. A more extreme pietist element,however, was known to persist in Egypt despite the ongoing efforts of mod-erate leaders to suppress it. The Nagid’s younger son, Obadiah, warned in theTreatise of the Poolnot to confuse such extreme isolation from society with152See Bodl.

Moses and otherprophets (and patriarchs) were taken as models of the practice ofkhalwahthroughout Abra-ham’soeuvre. SeeHW, II:386–400, and seePerush, 465 (Ex. 33:7, 11), and 59 (Gen. 24:62).155It is nevertheless interesting that Ḥananel’s son, Ḥayyim, was concerned for his father’ssafety. Presumably such journeys involved some element of risk of harm at the hands of animalsor bandits.156See also Daniel ibn al-Māshiṭah’s description of those pietists and disciples of the prophetswho trust in God to provide for their needs and seclude themselves in the mountains andwilderness (inqiṭā‘al-ḥasidim wa-talmide ha-nevi’im fī’l-jibālwa’l-barādī) in hisRectification ofReligion, in II Firk.

It is not so!”157It is possible that this passage alludes to thesame extreme element among the pietists that were critiqued by AbrahamMaimonides in his time for their neglect of the exoteric law.Onefinal observation must be made in order to grasp the real purpose ofsolitary meditation among the pietists. Abraham Maimonides made a criticaldistinction in theCompendiumand other writings between“outer solitude,”namely the act of physical isolation and meditation, and“inner solitude,”or thespiritual transformation and withdrawal for which the outer discipline serves aspractical training. According to these sources, the training by which this innerstate is attained constitutes a form of asceticism, sometimes imagined as“mortification of theflesh.”On more than one occasion, the Nagid cited theverse attributed to the ancient psalmist, Asaf, who declared,“Myflesh andheart perish while the Rock of my heart and my portion is God [forever]”(Ps.73:26).158The way to achieve such a death of theflesh“consists in the emptyingof the heart and mind of everything other than Him, may He be exalted, andallowing it to befilled and inhabited by Him (wa-ta‘ammurihi bihi).159This isachieved by suspending the sensory part of the soul, or most of it, directing theappetitive part away from all other worldly matters and inclining it towardHim, may He be exalted, and preoccupying the rational part with Him...”160The complete absorption of the heart and mind in the divine was alreadyobserved in the special observance of the sabbath for the pietist adept.161There,too, the withdrawal of the soul in the act of meditation culminated in a totalsilencing of bodily sensation and self-awareness.162The background to this idea is rooted in the devaluation of theflesh and ofphysical matter as a whole, common to pietist and philosophical thought alike.In both traditions, matter is an obstacle to the intellect and to divine perception.According to Maimonides, all bodily sensation, including the intake of food, is asource of degradation, and shame, and an obstacle to the philosopher in search157Bodl. MS Or. 661.14,recto, ll. 13–15, published by Fenton,The Treatise of the Pool, n.p.; cf.Fenton’s translation,The Treatise of the Pool, 93. Though Abraham was not as adamant on thispoint, the following passages in theCompendiumshould be noted,HW, I:148, ll. 2–3; II:386,16–21. Obadiah’s critique in context was clearly a polemical appeal for“inner solitude”asopposed to mere physical isolation. My reading is based on the assumption that his harshwords were for more than mere rhetorical effect, but alluded to a more extreme pietist elementknown also from Abraham’s writings.158The word“forever”is in the original but not the citation. SeeHW, II:382, l. 21 to 384, l. 1,andHW, ll. 9–10, andPerush, 309.159Compare the near identical expression, including the notion of divine indwelling (ta‘am-mur) in the heart,Perush, 307.160HW, 384, ll. 1–5.161See the citation and discussion in the previous section, pp. 106–8.162In Sufism, too, the goal of ecstatic attainment (wajd) was sometimes referred to as a“lossof sensation”(faqd al-iḥsās).

The goal ofkhalwahwas to deaden the body to all worldly stimuliand thereby refine the soul’s natural inclination to its divine origin.“Thereforethe person whose matter is refined, its coarseness slight and its essence pure, hisspiritual nature is manifest and he attains perfection.”165For the pietists, as fortheir Sufimentors, the darkening of outer vision is the preliminary to innerillumination.166Abraham Maimonides explicitly referred to the Sufipractice ofsolitary retreat in dark places (al-khalawātfī’l-mawāḍi‘al-muḍallamah), whichhis colleague Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘had praised as an original discipline ofthe ancient prophets.167The mortification of theflesh in the solitary retreat consisted primarily inthe gradual diminution of food and drink, which were likely to distract thepietist from full mental withdrawal from worldly matter in meditation. In acharacteristic interpretation on the experience ofkhalwahpracticed by theIsraelites in the desert, Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘extended the principle ofsolitary retreat beyond the individual experience to include the communityof Israelites at the moment of the Sinaitic revelation. Reading the verse inwhich the nobles of the tribes of Israel“had a vision of God and then ate anddrank”(Ex. 24:10), he identified the resumption of physical indulgence as areference to the termination ofkhalwah, following the soul’s beatific vision.His interpretation is all the more notable for his adoption of the notion ofcommunity-wide solitude in the desert, comparable to the communal“wit-nessing”(mushāhadah) at Sinai described by Judah ha-Levi in theKuzari.168As we shall see in our treatment of prophetic illumination, both AbrahamMaimonides and Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘looked to the revelation at Sinai as163On this general topic, see J.

As weshall explore further in Chapter six, the goal of such retreats was nothing shortof prophetic illumination, accessible to the seeker who has detached himselffrom all physical sensation and animal desire so as to achieve a state of innerillumination.

In a key study of thenotion of the self (nafs) in early Sufithought, Sara Sviri distinguishedbetween what she calls“a pietistic approach that upholds asceticism as anidealized way of life and a mystical approach that sees asceticism as a meretechnique, often a temporary technique, whereby inner transformation canbe achieved.”174Sviri’s conception of pietism as an idealization of asceticismdevoid of mystical aspiration bears further inquiry in light of the presentstudy. Yet, paradoxically, her definition of the mystical path in Sufism as onethat is oriented toward a transformation of the self, which utilizes the rigorof asceticism as a means toward that end, is quite apt as a depiction of theascetic strain in Egyptian pietism.For Abraham Maimonides, the practice of outer solitude and the regimen ofascetic detachment were perceived as points of spiritual progression on thepath toward mystical-prophetic insight. At the point at which the individual isfully in control of the sensitive, imaginative, and impulsive faculties of the soul,all of which become sublimated to the rational faculty, the mind becomes fullyabsorbed in what he refers to as“the essential religious and intellectual [modesof] knowledge and understanding.”The culmination of this intellectual andspiritual attainment is“a glimpse of [God’s] exalted existence...as Davidhinted in his testament to Solomon,‘And you, Solomon, my son, know theGod of your father’(I Chron. 28:9)...as my father and teacher, may thememory of the righteous be a blessing, explained at the end of theGuide, suchthat one’s mind is connected to [God], may He be exalted, and removed fromall else. This is arrival (wuṣūl) [at the culmination of the path].”175For all ofthe apparent divergence of father and son in their spiritual outlook,Abraham’s remarks in this passage are a potent reminder that his thoughtin theCompendiumpicked up where his father left off in theGuide.Maimonides’rather esoteric exhortation to the philosophical-religiouselite in theGuideIII:51 to cultivate solitary contemplation and“intellectualworship”became, in the able hands of his son, the portal to a compre-hensive path of spiritual discipline and intellectual training leading toprophetic attainment as the culmination of the pietist path.173On the experience of the“world to come”in pietist thought, see Chapterfive.174See Sviri,“Self and its Transformation in Ṣūfīsm,”197.175HW, II:382, ll. 5, 8, 9, 13.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 27/6/2015, SPi122Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"MUSICAL CHANTIn the history of Sufipractice, music and dance played a vital, if oftencontroversial, role in the arousal of ecstatic experience and the public ritualof many medieval orders.176Chant, in particular, became a prominent featureof collectivedhikrpractice, in which devotees followed the lead of the presid-ingshaikhin chanting rhythmic formulae and the holy names of God.177It iscurious that, with all that Egyptian pietism owed to the spiritual world ofSufism, there is no direct evidence for paralleldhikrceremonies in Jewishcircles of the period.178A possible allusion to a collective, as opposed to purelyindividual, ritual may be detected in the letter from a member of the Nagid’spietist circle in Fustat, cited above, in which the writer counseled his waywardcolleague to“attach yourself to the conventicle of therayyisand the compan-ions both in practice and in learning,”though the reference is too general to becertain.179Given the fact that pietist leaders, including Abraham Maimonides,sought to root their new devotions in the prophetic tradition of ancient Israel,the absence of any corresponding ritual in biblical and rabbinic lore wouldhave made the introduction of Jewishdhikrceremonies an unjustifiableimitation of gentile custom.180The controversial nature of adopting suchSufirituals may be detected in a Genizah letter, in which we learn of aschoolteacher accused by a localdayyanof introducing a so-calledzuhdīdance to his pupils.181The teacher wrote in his defense that these accusationswere baseless and vowed to travel to Cairo to confront his accuser to clearhis good name.182The discovery in the Genizah of a citation from the176See A.

They needed to look no furtherthan Maimonides’writings for the connection between music and propheticreceptivity. In his discussion of prophecy in the code, Maimonides wrote that“the disciples of the prophets would [place] a harp, a drum, aflute, or a lyrebefore them in seeking prophetic inspiration.”184Developing his father’s ideaone step further, Abraham wrote of music and song as a means for elevatingthe soul’s temperament to facilitate its receptivity to the prophetic overflow.“In order to attain inner solitude that leads to communion [with God](al-khalwah al-bāṭinah al-mu’aṣṣilah), the prophets and their followers usedmusical instruments and melodies, seeking to arouse the appetitive facultytoward [God], may He be exalted, and to empty the mind185of anything butHim.”186There is tantalizing evidence for the use of the classic Sufirite knownassamā‘, in which religious poems would be chanted and set to music in thegroup.187We likewise possess a fascinating poem in Judaeo-Arabic, attributedto Judah al-Ḥarizi, whose Sufimotifs and language point to a pietist origin.The poem addresses God with the rhythmic language reminiscent ofdhikrchants:“O He, O He, I have none but Him (yāhuwa,yāhuwa,mālīillāDavid Ha-Nasi Son of Hezekiah the Exilarch(Hebrew) (Jerusalem: Mekize Nirdamim, 2009),123,first noted by J.

In an intriguing passage on the use of voice in prayer, AbrahamMaimonides encouraged the use of song by the prayer leader and individualworshipers alike. He wrote in this vein of the importance of employing“atender melody”in prayer so as to add a visceral power to the words of theliturgy, in the hope of inducing in the worshipers“an overwhelming sense ofawe,”and at other times“a softening [of the heart] and submissiveness,”aswell as“an acknowledgment of one’s debt and sense of gratitude,”all“for thesake of the arousal and attainment of concentration.”191While this is true ofthe congregation through the guidance of the prayer leader, it is no less true ofthe individual in solitary devotion, who may likewise use melody and chant tofocus and purify the mind of all distracting thoughts.An individual praying in solitude should adopt a similar practice. If one combinesa softness and tenderness when uttering the words, it will lead to a [heightened]sensitivity and a mild temperament,192arousing the heart and bringing aneffusion of tears and weeping. This is the goal in preparing oneself in prayer...If one can achieve purity of concentration in one’s mind alone, well andgood...But if one can [only] achieve it through the use of the voice and over-whelming emotion and chanting—and this is more often the case—then it is likewiseessential...and for this reason we are commanded to praise [God], may He beexalted, with musical instruments and melodies...Understand this and conductyourself accordingly, and in this way facilitate your concentration [in prayer].193The Nagid’s words in this passage take the role of music and chant out of therealm of prophetic attainment and into the daily performance of statutoryprayer. But the function in each case is very similar: to facilitate an appropriatestate of mind for standing in the divine presence with purity of concentration.Melody is used to focus the mind and empty it of all but God. It is described asthe ideal preparation for prayer (ghāyah fī’l-tahayyu’al-ṣalawī), bringing the188TS Box H 10.18, 2,recto, ll. 6, 9–10, published by Stern,“Some Unpublished Poems byal-Harizi,”361.189See the manuscript, TS Box H 10.18, l. 5.

Joshua Maimonides(d.c.1410), who wrote of music in hisDoctor ad Solitudinem et Ductor adSimplicitatemas“an illuminative and spiritual therapy of the soul, causing it topine for the noble world and supernal realm that is its source.”195On the basisof Abraham Maimonides’conclusion of the passage from theCompendiumcited above, we may assume that speculation as to the role of music and chantin spiritual elevation did not remain at the level of abstract discourse, but wasthe basis for an uplifting model of prayer in pietist circles, including in theconventicle of the Nagid, where he held regular prayers with his disciples.To prayer leaders and pietist disciples alike, the Nagid advocated the conscioususe of melody to uplift the spirit in worship.“Understand this,”he insisted,“and conduct yourself accordingly.”196PIETIST ATTIREAmong the defining features by which Egyptian pietism came to be distin-guished was its adoption not only of key Sufirituals but of traditional Sufiattire as a demonstration of dedication to the ascetic life. While wearing woolor cotton was a sign of the individual adoption of penitence in the early Sufiperiod, by the tenth century it had become a social symbol of a devotee’s194SeeHW, II:404, ll. 4–14.195See the text from Bodl.

It is possible to point tothree distinct types of clothing worn by members of the movement, whetheron a consistent basis or at designated occasions, which together make up thepietisthabitus, known to Abraham Maimonides as the discipline of“outerhumility”(al-tawāḍu‘al-ḍāhir).200I. Woolen or Coarse MantleThe adoption of a woolen garment was among the earliest characteristics ofearly Jewish pietism in Egypt and perhaps beyond, even before it coalescedinto an organized movement.201In a rebuke of self-styled pietists, who imitatetrue devotees by adopting the outer trappings of the movement, the Nagiddismissed the mere adoption of the woolen cloak, thehabitusby which pietistshad already become known by this time.“It is a grave error for one to imagineabout himself, or for someone else to imagine about him, that he is aḥasidbecause he avoids marriage or practices fasting or eats little or wears wool(ṣūf), while at the same time being remiss in the commandments or trans-gresses prohibitions.”202A number of passages in theCompendiumtestify tothe wearing of woolen clothing as the daily habit of the adept. But, oncloser inspection, the pietist habit varied according to the season. AbrahamMaimonides recommended the use of a“coarse mantle”(libās al-khashin minal-thiyāb), made of coarse cotton in the winter and threadbare linen in the197See Massignon,Essay on the Origins of the Technical Language of Islamic Mysticism,104–5.198SeeHW, I:144, l. 20 to 146, l. 2.

As weshall see in Section III on pietist attire for prayer, the adornment of outerhumility functioned additionally as a symbolic act, representing the disrobingof worldly attachment and the donning of the mantle of piety and humility. Ina fascinating responsum, the Nagid replied to a request for an interpretation ofthe suggestive passage in I Samuel 19:24:“He, too, stripped off his clothes andlikewise prophesied before Samuel, and he lay down naked that whole day andthe whole night.”The Nagid’s interpretation of the verse, while tantalizinglybrief, serves as a window into the prevailing view that the coarse garments of203SeeHW, II:74, l. 20; 76, ll. 6–7.

Here, as before, Abraham acknowledgedthe prevalence of the custom among contemporary Sufis as compared with thesmall contingent of Jewish pietists who continued the practice in his day.He nevertheless maintained that the origins of the rite were to be found inthe ancient prophetic path cultivated by the likes of Elijah and Elisha, whoserved as the models for future practitioners of the initiatory rite, whetherMuslim or Jewish.211Teshuvot, 35, no. 24.212For Abraham’s adoption of the Sufiideal offaqras a spiritual virtue, seeHW, II:220, l. 21,and compare 240, l. 11.

But, in light of this passage, the more immediate and symbolicfunction of the initiatory cloak was to serve both as a formal induction of thenovice into the fellowship of disciples and as a“joyful annunciation”to theeffect that the disciple would now travel the pietist path under the directionand protection of the master.

Prayer AttireAmong the most intriguing prescriptions for pietist dress in the pietist litera-ture of the thirteenth century is the special attire disciples were encouraged towear exclusively for prayer. Given the total dedication to the spiritual liferequired by pietism, the prayer habit did not necessarily entail a separategarment.217In theRectification of Religionof Daniel ibn al-Māshiṭah,“thosedistinguished by pietism, who spend all of their time with God,”are identifiedby“cleanliness of body and cleanliness of clothing, with the purity required by215HW, II:264, l. 20 to 266, l. 9. The passage continues with the acknowledgment that hisfellow pietists have also adopted the sleeveless shirts (al-baqā’ir) mentioned above. The implicitinterpretation of Deut. 33:3 is that traditions native to the Jewish people (the initial recipients of“Your words”) were subsequently appropriated by other nations.216SeeHW, 266, l. 4, and cf.HW, 422, ll. 7 to 424, l. 9.217On classical rabbinic views on proper attire for prayer, see Ehrlich,Non-Verbal Languageof Jewish Prayer, 128–47.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 27/6/2015, SPi130Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"religion, as it says in Ecclesiastes (4:17),‘Guard your foot when you go to thehouse of God’.”218Abraham Maimonides, on the other hand, recommended aseparate prayer raiment for those capable of the additional exertion, althoughhe acknowledged that such a regimen was excessive even for many dedicatedpietists. The garment prescribed by him appears to have been a version ofsackcloth and ashes, again in imitation of the prophets of old. Here, as before,Elijah and Elisha were brought forth as witnesses, although the fact that suchclothes were set aside by some for prayer suggests that it was different than theusual coarse garments worn by most adherents to the movement. As we shallsee, the Nagid’s treatment of the prayer attire of the strict pietist is of greatimportance for his approach to the movement in general.The garment worn for prayer must be the cleanest of one’s garments. If it ispossible for one to reserve one or more garments special for prayer, apart fromthe garments he uses for other activities, how much the better! This is especiallyso for the prayer leader, on the analogy of the priestly garments just as prayer is inplace of sacrifice...If this is too difficult, and not everyone—not even every piousperson—is capable of it, one must at least make sure that his clothing is cleanand pure...Be careful not to misunderstand what is related of the practice ofthe sages, of blessed memory, and also of the prophets, peace be upon them,of making oneself look ragged in supplication...and of wearing sackcloth(al-musūḥ),219[a custom] found throughout the prophetic books but hardly tobe found among those mired in the exile on account of their lowly state. Now, toadopt this custom is even greater and more elevated than the cleanliness ofclothes and their adornment...One should not even consider bringing this[advice to scholars to wear clean clothes] as proof against a pietist who practicesasceticism (ḥasid tazahhada) by wearing different clothing and by other means.For an ascetic such as this travels a path more elevated than the path of scholars,just like the path of Elijah and Elisha, peace be upon them, is more elevated thanthe path of David and Solomon. In the same way, the prayer of a pious and asceticperson, who accepts upon himself (al-multazim) in his state of prayer to wearsackcloth and sit upon ashes, is more elevated than the scrupulous (al-mutaḥar-riyīn) [of the law]...But even the few pious individuals who adopt this customdo not do so regularly but only occasionally.220In this passage, the Nagid appears once again in the role of reformer, resur-recting the customs of the prophets and sages of antiquity over against theways of his contemporaries, most of whom appear“mired in the exile onaccount of their lowly state.”221But the Nagid’s words were concerned not218See II Firk.

It is nevertheless noteworthy that the Nagid openly conceded tovarying degrees of tolerance for a special prayer raiment among the pietists,suggesting a certain variety in practice within the group. This picture con-forms well with what we know of pietist prayer circles more generally, inwhich fellow devotees“view[ed] their bowings and prostrations as a sign of[heightened] concentration.”223Pietism in general was defined in terms ofincreasing levels of spiritual striving, reflecting the different points at whichdisciplesfind themselves along the path.224As a result, Pietist conventicleswere characterized by variation in individual practice, depending on thespontaneous movement of the spirit, leading to prostration at different mo-ments in prayer, or on a more penitent form of attire, adopted by each pietiston an individual basis (known here and elsewhere as a form of“commitment,”iltizām). For the few who aspired to more rigorous forms of piety, the cleanand specially consecrated prayer garment was replaced by a raiment ofsackcloth and ashes. For the majority of pietists, however, the Nagid encour-aged the more suitable practice appropriate for each disciple. As with hisprayer reforms more generally, to which we turn in the next chapter, thisapproach was part and parcel of the Nagid’s overall effort to make increasedlevels of piety more accessible to his coreligionists, with the goal of graduallybringing the fruits of the pietist movement into the mainstream of Jewishsociety.225222On the opposition to pietism in general, and the Nagid’s devotional reforms in particular,see Chapter three.223SeeTeshuvot, 62, no. 62, on which see the beginning of Chapter three.224See the Nagid’s remarks inTeshuvot, 65, no. 62:“Most pietist practices are not obligatorybut an added stringency.

But for the curious onlooker(such as the author of our query), the most distinctive feature of Egyptianpietism was its novel approach to prayer and prayer rites. As we shall see inthis and the following chapter, each element of pietist prayer described in thequery—the direction of prayer, the manner of sitting, new forms and occa-sions for bowing, and an emphasis on heightened concentration—were essen-tial components of the new pietist prayer rites of the early thirteenth century.The examples mentioned in the query are by no means exhaustive, and in thischapter we shall have occasion to consider additional prayer reforms intro-duced by the pietists of Egypt.Before turning to the prayer reforms themselves, it is worth pausing toconsider the unique significance attached to prayer in Egyptian pietistthought. An entire treatise on prayer and its role in the inner life of the“seekerof God”(ṭālib allāh), composed in the early years of the thirteenth century byan anonymous pietist master, was brought to light some twenty years ago byPaul Fenton and provides a vivid portrait of the role played by prayer amongthe pietists. Like their counterparts in Germany during the same period andthe later pietists of early modern Eastern Europe, prayer became the desiredmedium of spiritual transcendence in Egyptian pietism, but for somewhatdifferent reasons. The latter shows no traces of the numerological or theo-sophical speculation found in European Jewish pietism in its various forms.4For the Egyptian devotees, prayer served the same purpose as other devotionalrituals: to clear the mind of all worldly distractions so as to concentrate fullyon the divine. Prayer performed“with the sincerity of the tongue and theheart,”in which the soul cleaves to God and“yearns to turn toward its sacredrealm,”is designated by the author,“the worship of the devotees”(‘ibādatal-ārifīn).5Writing on the advantages of prayer for the attainment of spiritualperfection, the anonymous pietist author explained the necessity of temporarymoments of retreat from worldly activity:Thefirst thing [to know] regarding the essence of prayer is that prayer is not anend in itself, but is [performed] for the purpose of polishing the majestic soul4On numerology in the prayer life of medieval German pietism, see I.

For the more a personis immersed in, and preoccupied with, the world...the more the soul of necessitygrows dim and those faculties vital to its ability to attain its own perfection areweakened.6The emphasis on the luminescence and perfection of the soul, so central topietist thought in general and to this manual on the spiritual life in particular,is a subject to which we shall return in Chapterfive on prophecy. But it isworth observing at this point that the author found it necessary to stress thatprayer is not an end in itself, but rather serves a critical yet auxiliary roletoward a more sublime purpose. For this reason, our author has interwoventhe standard obligations for prayer with additional pietist requirements to beperformed before, during, and after the formal prayers, including the revival ofan ancient practice recorded in the Mishnah, according to which the“earlypietists”(ḥasidim ha-rishonim) would devote time before and after prayer tocontemplative devotion.7This raises yet another theme addressed later in thischapter, namely the complete synthesis of pietism and law, in which devo-tional and supererogatory practices were integrated seamlessly, yet not with-out a measure of ambiguity, into the framework of religious obligation.The best example of this new emphasis on devotional worship and itsrelationship to the normative structure of statutory prayer is manifest in thewritings of Abraham Maimonides from the same period. Elsewhere, I haveexplored the pivotal role played by the Nagid in the liturgical reforms enactedin synagogues throughout Egypt during the second decade of the thirteenthcentury.8Here, too, we are concerned with prayer reforms undertaken by theNagid, but this time with two critical differences. First and foremost, thereforms we examine here were not liturgical but structural. That is to say,they were directed at the appropriate preparations for, and required posturesof, statutory prayer, rather than at the words of prayer per se. Second, unlikethe liturgical changes, these reforms betray a key ambivalence toward theiractual position in the law.Surprisingly, despite his zeal in rectifying synagogue practice in the caseof liturgy and waging a“controversy for the sake of heaven,”AbrahamMaimonides declined to impose his structural changes in the main syn-agogues, so they were only adopted in practice (as is attested by the querywith which we began the chapter) among the pietists in their private worship6II Firk.

And yet Abraham explicitly and repeatedly referred to the reforms asobligatory for the proper fulfillment of worship. It is important to bear inmind that he included his treatment of these structural forms in the secondpart of hisCompendium. As already noted, thefirst three parts of the workdealt with laws obligatory on the people as a whole—what he dubbed the“common path”incumbent on all Israel—while the fourth andfinal partdealt exclusively with the“elevated path”of pietism. On more than oneoccasion, Abraham chastised the people as a whole for their neglect ofthese prayer rites, yet he never enforced them in the synagogues. We shallreturn to the perplexing status of these rites later in the chapter. For now, itwill suffice to take note of the urgency with which the Nagid addressed theproblem of prayer and the restoration of the neglected rites in the followingpassage from theCompendium.I have dwelt on this topic at length on account of the people’s general decline overthe course of the exile in the area of communal worship. Many years and multiplegenerations have passed since they have properly observed those obligatory riteswhich I have described...There is no greater need [in our worship] than toobserve these commendable obligations (al-wājibāt al-mandūb ilaihā).“It is timeto act [for] the Lord—they have neglected Your Torah”(Ps. 119:126)9...TheTemple is destroyed on account of our sins. Sacrifice and all that is connectedwith it is no longer available to us. All that remains is prayer and similar[devotions], yet no one gives them any heed.10Abraham’s stated goal was to rouse the Jewish community from its currentmalaise, invoking the time-honored verse for the reform of communal norms:“It is time to act [for] the Lord; they have rendered void your Torah.”11As weshall see, his father had formerly invoked the same verse in the midst of hisown synagogue reform, a change to the statutory standing prayer that re-mained on the books in Abraham’s day and which remained relatively stableuntil the sixteenth century.12As was his father in this case, Abraham was theprimaryfigure responsible for formulating and implementing his reforms,although in some if not all of them he was supported by the elder pietist,Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘(“the Pious”), before the latter’s death in or shortlyafter 1223.13Referring to one case of reform, the Nagid observed that“I have9The scribe of this manuscript (Bodl.

The proceeds of the auction wereto pay off his debts while the remainder was to go to his living heirs. See TS 20.44, published byE. J.

On another occasion,however, the Nagid wrote of his cooperation with Abraham the Pious inestablishing his prayer reforms:“I myself and Rabbi Abraham the Pious,may the memory of the righteous be a blessing, established our custom,followed by others who followed our example.”16If the Nagid was the centralfigure behind the changes, he appears to haveworked closely with the revered elder pietist and enlisted his assistance insupport of the undertaking. As already noted in our account of the growth ofthe pietist movement in Chapter one, Abraham the Pious and his brotherJoseph were respected leaders of the nascent movement in the early years ofthe thirteenth century.17It is likely that they were among the charismaticfigures behind the early pietist activity to which the young Abraham wasdrawn even before his father’s death.18In a fascinating aside in the contextof his case for sitting in rows, to which we shall return in due course, Abrahamwrote:“Even I, who detest [the current practice] and disallow it, was among460–3, and N.

Anonymous polemicalcriticism of this sort is notoriously difficult to verify with any precision,especially when it attributes to“those misguided leaders in our day”a sin-gle-minded“lust for power.”22But there are echoes of more specific battlesover the synagogue reforms buried in the Nagid’s polemic. On one occasion,he mentioned“one of the contemptible leaders”who“wage war against thetruth”and“seek to justify erroneous customs.”23Elsewhere, he referred to“thearguments of those who oppose the truth with distortions and fabricationsthat cause the Lord’s people to stumble,”suggesting something of a concertedeffort on the part of his opponents to justify the prevailing customs before thebroader community.24One senses in the Nagid’s trenchant polemic against his adversaries in thecommunal establishment an additional factor, namely the staunch oppositionof his rivals, who appear to have stymied his efforts. Abraham may havealluded to this resistance when describing his“limited ability”to renewlong-obsolete practices in the synagogues.25In another revealing passage,Abraham contrasted the negative reception accorded his own reforms withthe generally positive response to those initiated by his father some decadesearlier. Turning to the substance of the two reforms, Abraham noted withsome umbrage how his own modifications of synagogue ritual were more insync with Jewish law than those of his father. While his father eliminated acustom with afirm foundation in the Talmud,26he sought, by contrast, merelyto reintroduce long-neglected rituals, whose biblical and talmudic precedents19This is the meaning of the term (taqaddum) as used throughout Abraham Maimonides’oeuvre, although Dana translated it as“my life.”20SM, 98.21See TS 16.187, discussed on pp. 15–16.22SeeHW, II:74, l. 4, andSM, 96, respectively.23SeeSM, 96.24SeeSM, 96, 183, and cf. alsoHW, 408, l. 11–410, l. 3.25See B.

In spite of this, he observed wryly, the commu-nity at large was more willing to adopt his father’s changes than his own.This ordinance [of my father] has become widely accepted throughout all Egypt(fī’l-diyār al-miṣrīyah)27during his lifetime and after his death and it has becomethe norm, replacing the [former practice]...Not a single scholar of his gener-ation opposed him in this matter nor did anyone impute that such a thing wascontrary to the [institution of the] sages, despite the fact that it runs counter tothe text of the Talmud. The reason for this is that, at that time, there was noobstinacy or envy among [the leaders], nor anyone who wrote hasty rulings inspite of their ignorance and lack of scruples. This is precisely the outrage that hasoccurred in this generation on account of those who oppose the great emend-ations and important recommendations and obligations that I have proposed.28Abraham’s remark on the compatibility of his reforms with talmudic law (or thelack of it in the case of his father) was not a rhetorical aside, but the theoreticalbasis of his structural emendations and the source of his exasperation at thegeneral reaction to his reforms. Much of what the Nagid proposed looked alienand inauthentic to the community, not only for its association with Islamicprayer rites but also for its total absence from living Jewish practice for as long asanyone could remember. The fundamental question of what constitutes authen-tic Jewish ritual—actual practice or textual precedent—was of major significancein Abraham’s thought. As I have recently argued, Abraham and his father bothinclined toward an authentication of talmudic authority over a justification ofprevailing custom, even if the two men did not always act with equal zeal in therepeal of established custom and the restitution of talmudic norms.29Thisbackground adds an element of irony to Abraham’s comment on the lack oftalmudic support for his father’s reform. His words were duly calculated to castaspersions on all those who were quick to accept his father’s emendations whilerenouncing his own.Yet, in another respect, much of the Nagid’s reformist writing was defensivein nature. His general appeal to biblical (and not only talmudic) precedent wasintended in part to validate his claims of a return to origins, a restoration of27One gets the impression of some resistance to Maimonides’ordinance from anotherresponsum: seeTeshuvot ha-Rambam, ed. Blau (Jerusalem: Rubin Mass Ltd., 1986), II: 485–6,no. 259. Yet, as Abraham testified here, they were nevertheless widely accepted throughout thecountry. From a responsum of the sixteenth-century Egyptian scholar and Maimonideancommentator, David ibn Abi Zimra, we read that Maimonides’change was still in effect bythat late date (though repealed by the latter). SeeShut ha-Radvaz, ed. A. Walden (Israel: SuperSefer, 1971), IV:2, no. 1079, where the custom is described as prevalent“throughout this entirekingdom.”Ibn Abi Zimra repeated, and elaborated on, Maimonides’justification of the enact-ment as necessary in light of Muslim opinion.

As already noted in Chapterone, a major part of the Nagid’s reformist argument consisted in the assertionthat these rites were the“ancient modes of worship”and“ancient practices ofIsrael.”30“Be careful,”he wrote in the same vein,“not to confuse a new ideaand custom with ancient [rites] that have been neglected to the point of beingforgotten and [only] later...restored and revitalized...”31The implication ofthe Nagid’s remarks are clear. What was originally binding, no matter howmany years it had lain in abeyance, retains its obligatory status. As a result, heconcluded, it is incumbent on the community to resume its practice“when it isshown to be an obligation.”32Yet if, as he insisted, the rites were indeedobligatory, how may we explain his unwillingness to push them through atall costs, as he did with his liturgical reforms? Here we turn to the paradoxinherent in the Nagid’s treatment of the reforms, a paradox hinted at morethan once and only obliquely resolved in his writings.REQUIREMENT OR RECOMMENDATION?The inability of Abraham’s reforms to gain traction beyond his own pietistfollowing or to survive far beyond his own brief, if colorful, career, has been asubject of curiosity for a number of scholars. Goitein famously lamentedAbraham’s“tragic fate”as a communal leader, suggesting that his many dutiesto hisflock and obligations to the Sultan’s court“limited the extent andduration of his impact.”33According to Goitein, Abraham neglected theimplementation of his own reforms out of a desire to implement his father’sreforms, choosing to remain in the very position of authority that tragicallyconstrained his own life’s work.34In a recent study, Mordechai Friedmanargued that opposition to Abraham’s leadership, even more than the burdensof that leadership, contributed to this failure, suggesting further that Abrahamremained in office precisely because of his desire to promote his agenda ofreform.3530SeeSM, 149 and 150, respectively, and see the discussion on p. 175.31SM, 161.32SeeSM, 161.33See Goitein,Med. Soc., V:492. Expressing his well-known sympathy for Abraham’s char-acter and career, Goitein then added:“The nobility of his mind and the excellence of his spiritualgifts were deserving of richer response.”34See Goitein,Med. Soc., V:493.35See M. A. Friedman,“Abraham Maimonides on His Leadership, Reforms, and SpiritualImperfection,”JQR104 (2014), 499–502. Friedman differs with Goitein in assuming thatAbraham’s desire to remain in a position of authority was not to maintain the observance ofJewish religious law in general, and his father’s reforms in particular, but that“his paramountgoal in pursuing leadership was the promotion of his program for radical reform in divineworship for the entire Jewish community.”See Friedman,“Abraham Maimonides on HisOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi142Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"In my view, the primary reason for the failure of Abraham Maimonides’devotional reforms to gain acceptance, beyond the immediate communalresistance it engendered, was his unwillingness to enforce them in the syn-agogues“for the sake of heaven,”as he had done despite loud and angryobjections in the case of his liturgical reforms. Abraham’s reluctance istherefore surprising and requires some explanation. In the passage fromtheCompendiumcited above, Abraham described his synagogue reforms as“the great emendations and important recommendations and obligationsthat I have proposed”(al-maṣāliḥal-kubrāwa’l-mandūbātwa’l-wājibātal-‘uẓmā).36The peculiarity of obligations that are merely proposed (ratherthan imposed) puts the problem of Abraham’s reforms in full relief. There islittle doubt that he hoped to implement the changes beyond his pietist circle.But, as we shall see, he did not consider the added strictures to possess thesame obligatory status as other mandatory conditions of prayer, and at notime sought to institute them beyond the prayer service in his private resi-dence. Not a single document from this period suggests that they were everembraced in either of the main synagogues in Fustat. While the Nagid was nostranger to controversy (or to holding his ground in the face of popularopposition), he pinned his hopes for these new reforms on his own powersof persuasion to convince the people of their importance. Once again, heattributed the people’s reluctance to adopt the reforms to the opposition ofother communal leaders.I have seen the community drawn in whatever direction they are led with greatease, much as they are led toward the opposite with great ease. [They are] like anempty receptacle that takes in whatever youfill it with. Whether youfill it withlife-giving waters or with harmful waters, it receives them and isfilled [one way orthe other]. God will bring punishment upon those leaders who have no pity upon[the community] but lead them astray, as He said to them,“O my people, yourleaders lead you astray and destroy the way of your paths”(Is. 3:12).37And howgreat is the reward for those leaders who have pity upon them—pity for theirreligious well-being—leading them toward what God, may He be exalted, desires.Of those it is said,“And the enlightened shall shine [as the glory of thefirma-ment], and those who bring many toward righteousness are as the stars forever”(Dan. 12:3).38Leadership, Reforms, and Spiritual Imperfection,”502. If, by“radical reform,”Friedman intendsAbraham’s changes to prevailing liturgical rites, I am in full agreement. As I argue in whatfollows, the Nagid did not impose, nor intend to impose, his devotional reforms (i.e. thosediscussed in general in this chapter and enumerated in greater detail in the following chapter) onthe community at large. This is not to say that he did not view his position as valuable inpromoting these reforms through the force of persuasion, though not through imposition.36See p. 141.37Abraham most likely cited the verse from memory and omitted the word“please”(na). Theomission could also be a scribal error.38SM, 185–6.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiThe Devotional Life143"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Abraham’s low estimation of the independent judgment of the community isstriking for a work that purports to be for a general audience. Yet it should beemphasized that he wrote these words as an affirmation of his faith in thepeople’s eventual acceptance of these important reforms.39The real rebuke inthis passage is directed at the communal leadership (murshidīhim), scholarsand magistrates, who stymie the religious improvement of the people. Yet it isnotable that, for all that, the Nagid did not seek to implement his changes overthe opposition of rival leaders, beyond the power of persuasion directed at thepeople. There is no mention of enactments or decrees, merely preaching andmild condemnation. Abraham’s repeated reproach of opposing leaders for allbut guaranteeing the failure of his reforms to take root in the community lendsa certain air of authenticity, and ought, in my view, to be taken at face value.Among the documents published by S. D. Goitein on the Nagid’s reformsis a letter written by a supporter of the Palestinian rite, concerning an appealto the Sultan accusing the Nagid of religious innovation.40A number ofscholars have interpreted this letter as a critique of his structural changes tosynagogue devotional practice, rather than noting its relevance to the litur-gical controversies.41Yet the letter does shed important light on the questionof how far Abraham was willing to encourage devotional practices incommunal worship. In the letter, the Nagid was denounced to the Ayyubidauthorities for introducing changes into the synagogues, a charge he openlydenied. In a written report to the government, Abraham attested to the factthat he never compelled others to adopt his synagogue reforms:“I...dodeclare that I voluntarily undertake devotions to God and supplementaryprayers with bowing and prostration and prayer in my house for myself(fībaitīli-nafsī). I do not compel anyone to do the same nor have I imposedany changes on the [community] in their synagogues.”42To settle thematter, the Nagid and his immediate circle solicited“the entire commu-nity...close to two hundred people,”to affirm his claim that he had neverimposed his changes in the main synagogues, an assertion that most peoplereadily agreed to be true and affixed their names in confirmation.The author of the letter expressed outrage at what he considered the blatantlie perpetrated by the Nagid and confirmed by the unscrupulous people. Hecharged that“the writing of the report demonstrates a weakness and deficiency[of character],”adding that“as for everyone who wrote their confirmation, may39Note his remarks on his general audience in the preceding passage,SM, 185.40See TS Arabic Box 51.111,recto, ll. 8–26, published by S.

Yet, apartfrom the notable fact that some 200 local Jews gave their official confirmation tothe Nagid’s report, it is worth remembering that the precise claim made by theNagid as to the private and non-coercive nature of his pietist worship waslikewise true.It appears that both parties in this dispute were right in their assertions,though in reference to different reforms. The controversy over the Palestinianrite, together with the other liturgical changes, constituted a clear impositionby the Nagid on the community. The pietist reforms, on the other hand, were adifferent matter altogether. There are no grounds to assume that AbrahamMaimonides ever imposed these changes on the main synagogues. In hisresponsum to the query posed to him on pietist worship, with which webegan this chapter, he correctly pointed out that,“since [the pietists] dothese things in their homes (be-vatehem hen‘osin), whether in private orcommunal prayer...whoeverfinds [their practice] difficult should not jointhem and pray with them, thus avoiding any difficulty. The synagogue isavailable to them.”44The consensus of scholarly opinion has tended to read the letter on thedenunciation of the Nagid to the Sultan as evidence that he did initially seek toimpose his structural reforms in the main synagogues and was later rebuffed.Goitein, who published the letter, was thefirst to suggest that“it is...possiblethat in his younger days [Abraham] had been more high-handed”with thepietist reforms.45As I understand the controversies alluded to in this letter,Abraham’s high-handedness can only be demonstrated in his liturgical, nothis structural, reforms. Even before Goitein’s publication of the document,Naphtali Wieder had already suggested that Abraham did at one pointintroduce the devotional rites in the main synagogues of Egypt,46althoughelsewhere he hinted at the possibility that contemporaries of the Nagid mayhave stymied his efforts to implement the reforms.47A number of scholars have followed Wieder and especially Goitein. GersonCohen asserted that Abraham Maimonides and his colleague, Abraham ibnAbī’l-Rabī‘,“were responsible for introducing into Egyptian synagogues theliturgical reforms that were inspired by pietist motives,”and that the commu-nity viewed this as“but one more innovation that a family of Andalusianinterlopers had brought to, and forced upon, an old and proud Jewish43Goitein,“New Documents from the Cairo Geniza,”ll. 24–5.44Teshuvot, 64, no. 62.45See Goitein,“New Documents from the Cairo Geniza,”713.46See Wieder,Islamic Influences, 31 and 71.47See Wieder,Islamic Influences, 57.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiThe Devotional Life145"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"community.”48Hava Lazarus-Yafeh went a step further, suggesting that, underpressure from the Muslim authorities,“R. Abraham was compelled to apolo-gize to the Muslim ruler and to announce that he did not intend to abusehis authority...by introducing such religious innovations.”49In an essayon the practice of prostration as a backdrop to the Nagid’s reforms,Y. T. Langermann adopted a similar view, arguing that“Abraham introducedinto the synagogue kneeling, prostrations and other bodily postures,”althoughhe qualified this by saying that these changes enjoyed but a“brief, controver-sial, and ultimately unsuccessful re-entry”into general synagogue life.50PaulFenton has interpreted the letter in a similar vein. Following Goitein’s con-jecture cited above, Fenton wrote that“it seems that at some point, perhaps inthe early days of his office, thenagidhad endeavored to enforce his practicesupon other sections of the community,”though with no success.51The sources do attest to Abraham Maimonides’expectation that his syna-gogue reforms would eventually be accepted and stimulate a religious revivalin the community as a whole. But there is no evidence to suggest that he tookthe next step and enforced them at any point. The contrast with his approachon the liturgical reforms is all the more evident when we consider that bothsets of changes were undertaken during the same period, beginning in thefirstyears of his headship. Consider his remarks at the end of a responsum on aprivate dispute between two community members:“[It is well known] thatI devote much effort in the service of my God...with all my heart and with allmy soul, performing many bowings and prostrations and similar things, thelikes of which I do not conceal but have written about in my treatise. May itbe [God’s] will that you inquire of me regarding these noble matters!”52His appeal reflects a degree of helplessness in stimulating interest in hisdevotional changes, an interest that was not entirely forthcoming.How then can we explain the Nagid’s caution in this case, as opposed to hisliturgical reforms? The question is all the more intriguing given his frequentuse of the language of obligation when discussing the structural changes in theCompendium.His strategy in each case was to enumerate at great length notonly the traditional precedent for the rites but their legal requirement, accord-ing to the“triple cord”of scripture, tradition, and reason. To be sure, thisshould be viewed in the context of the apologetic purpose of the work as a48G. Cohen,“The Soteriology of R. Abraham Maimuni,”PAAJR35 (1967–8), 76.49H.

But if the Nagid was sincere in describing their legal obligation, whatconstrained him from imposing them and engaging in a similar“controversyfor the sake of heaven”? As it turns out, a close look at his language ofobligation reveals a somewhat ambiguous relationship between law andpietism.Now since prostration is obligatory (wājibah), as required (muta‘ayyanah)byscripture, tradition, and reason—scripture according to what I have cited, trad-ition according to what I have explained, and [reason due to the fact] thatprostration is the highest form of exertion in outer worship—it is incumbentupon us to clarify in what circumstance it is obligatory (tajibu)—or, if you prefer,imperative (talzumu)...[A]s for the circumstances in which it is imperative orobligatory or required (talzumu au tajibu au tuta‘ayyanu), it is obligatory (tajibu)in three circumstances: that of glorification of His name, may He be exalted, thatof acknowledgement and thanksgiving for His goodness, and that of supplicationfor His mercy.53The passage begins, like most others of its type in theCompendium, with thescriptural and traditional basis for determining a given practice as obligatory.It concludes with an enumeration of the three circumstances in which thepractice of prostration is obligatory. But it is the imprecise and hesitantlanguage in between that is so striking. If the three terms he employed forlegal obligation were purely synonymous, what would be the purpose ofhesitating over which is the most accurate? Surely no wavering wouldbe called for in the case of other religious duties, whose legal status isunquestioned. When we look at parallel passages of the Nagid’s structuralreforms, wefind the same curious multiplication of terms. Thus we reada description of spreading out the hands in supplication as“among thepreferred, obligatory, and commendable postures”(al-auḍā‘al-mukhtārahal-wājibah al-mustaḥabbah).54Similarly, when describing the ritual ablutionof hands and feet before prayer, he wrote that one who performs this rite“hasfulfilled an obligation and has applied a commendable practice, which is closeto being a duty”(fa‘ala wājiban wa-‘tamada mandūban yuqārib al-farḍ).55Aswe saw earlier, the Nagid described his reforms in general with the combinedexpression of“obligatory and commendable practices”(al-wājibātwa’l-man-dūbāt).56Though these last two terms in English translation may pass for amerely rhetoricalflourish, readers accustomed to the technical distinctionbetween the two in Arabic legal literature will immediately detect the apparentoddity of the Nagid’s formulation.5753SM, 134.54SeeSM, 100.55SM, 158.56SeeSM, 183 and 196 (in reverse).57Whilewājibin Islamicfiqhrefers to an absolute commandment,mandūbis the technicalterm for a praiseworthy, though not obligatory, act.

In caseswhere there is a clear legal foundation, even if a qualified one (as in the caseof prostration), his language of obligation drew on earlier formulations inthe tradition, particularly those of his father. He introduced his chapterson the laws of prayer with a preface on the different degrees of obligation inJewish law, with clear parallels to Islamic jurisprudence.Know that the word“obligation”(al-wujūb) in Arabic refers to an imperative(al-luzūm) and necessity (al-ḍarūrah), as is well known from the meaning of thelanguage, and therefore the opposite of obligation is prohibition. [Obligation] cansometimes have a less absolute meaning, indicating something commendable butnot necessary (al-mandūb ilaihi al-ghair ḍarūrī), as when it is said that a personought (yajibu) to be generous or brave and the like. The word“obligatory”(al-wājib) used here refers both to the necessary (al-ḍarūrī) and the commendable(al-mandūbilaihi). Of the duties of prayer included in our law, derived fromscripture and tradition and synthesized and enumerated by my father and tea-cher...five are necessary obligations, without which one has not fulfilled one’sobligation, and eight are commendable ones, which one is not permitted to trans-gress unless absolutely necessary. If one did not fulfill [the latter] due to negligenceor laxity, one has still fulfilled the obligation of prayer and is not required to repeat it,even if one committed the transgression with intentional neglect...58As Abraham’s careful parsing of technical terms reveals, Jewish law recognizestwo distinct meanings for the notion of religious obligation. The use of Islamicterminology,“obligatory”(wājib) versus recommended action (mandūbilaihi), is evident here, though Jewish law views the two not as differingdegrees of obligation. The distinction is not unique to prayer, but is a basicprinciple of talmudic law. In rabbinic parlance, thefirst category representsthe principle of‘ikkuv, a legalsine qua nonwithout which one’s obligation hasnot been fulfilled. The second category, on the other hand, refers to actionsrequired though not essential to fulfilling one’s obligation. As Abraham notedin the passage just cited, Maimonides listedfive obligations of thefirstcategory59and eight in the second.60Maimonides’distinction is also reflecteddistinction.

Though he frequently asserted the requirement to prostrate, Abrahamincluded it, like his father, among the non-binding obligations:“As for anyonewho does not fulfill any of these [occasions for prostration], due to laxity inconcentration and an absence of [religious] zeal, it cannot be said that such aone has not fulfilled his obligation.”62In light of the foregoing, we are in a much better position to appreciateAbraham Maimonides’decision to come down forcefully on some customswhile treading lightly on others. As we have seen, the Nagid viewed both theproblematic liturgical rites and the contemporary observance of synagoguepostures as faulty customs that took root over many years in exile.63Henevertheless distinguished between those customs that are essential for thefulfillment of the law and those that are desirable yet non-binding. Whilethe obligation in each case was rooted in scriptural and rabbinic tradition,one required an uncompromising rejection while the other demandedvigorous persuasion but without enforcement. Paradoxically, AbrahamMaimonides showed greater restraint in matters he considered the founda-tion of all religious life, while displaying the utmost zeal for the sake of lessfundamental, yet legally binding, rites.64In his vision for communal revital-ization, Abraham stopped short of provoking a direct confrontation with thepublic by implementing his changes in the face of local resistance. But thisdid not stop him from publicly promoting them to the general public, acourse that brought him into conflict with rival scholars in Egypt. In arevealing passage, the Nagid encouraged his followers to approach the newrites as if they were as binding as any other law. Here again, one senses hispalpable frustration over the opposition of rival leaders.“On account ofthose who have contempt for the truth and wish to turn people away fromdevoting themselves and increasing their effort (ijtihād) in the worship oftheir Creator, may His name be blessed, we ought to be especially zealous inits [fulfillment].

As already noted in theIntroduction, thereligiousadaptation of Islamic rites, as opposed to theliteraryorintellectualadaptation of Arabic culture, was unprecedented onthis scale. To be sure, traces of Islamic influence are well known in isolatedcases before the Nagid’s time. Thefirst sustained effort to collect informationon the impact of the Islamic environment on Jewish ritual, and to date still themost systematic treatment of the subject, was undertaken over sixty years agoby the late Naphtali Wieder, who detected at least two clear cases of cross-fertilization from as early as the Gaonic period.66Wieder looked at evidencefrom Iraq and Palestine in the Gaonic period and from Egypt, Palestine, andNorth Africa in the period leading up to Maimonides and his son. Yet Wiederclearly perceived the unique significance of the reforms to Jewish ritual thatwere the fruit of Egyptian pietism, singling out prostration, kneeling, facingthe ark, the arrangement in orderly rows, and the spreading out of the handsas the primary innovations of the pietist movement.67In light of the background analyzed by Wieder, it is clear that the case ofEgyptian pietism is qualitatively different from those of Islamic influence inearlier periods. The most noteworthy case of Islamic influence from as early asthe Gaonic period—that of ritual ablution of the feet before prayer—betraysno explicit acknowledgment from its early proponents of its associationwith Islamic worship. Its significance is to be found simply in the extentto which it mirrors, seemingly quite unconsciously, a dominant mode ofworship in Islam.68A noticeable shift in scope, and more importantly in self-consciousness, sets the Egyptian pietist reforms apart from previous casesof Islamic influence. Unlike the earlier cases, the pietist rites were not onlydiscontinuous with local custom, but reflect a conscious break with it, andtherefore fully deserve their designation as full-fledged reforms to prevailingpractice. The protestations of the pietists to the effect that the changes tosynagogue ritual were not innovations but restorations of original Jewish ritesin no way diminish the fact that they were, for all practical purposes, bothnovel and reformist at their core. Even as he insisted on their authenticity andantiquity, the Nagid acknowledged that such a massive change“appears to the66See Wieder,Islamic Influences,10–25, for the evidence of Islamic influence on Jewishworship before the time of the Nagid. For reviews of Wieder, see G. Vajda,“Naphtali Wieder,Hashpa‘ot Islamiyot‘al ha-Pulhan ha-Yehudi, Islamic Influences on the Jewish Worship,”REJ108(1948), 107–8, and, more recently, S.

In a sectionof his monograph entitled“Prayer and its Mystical Purpose,”Wieder wrote:“The reforms that [Abraham Maimonides] introduced into prayer observanceflow from his mystical perspective on the importance and purpose of prayer. Inthis respect, he was entirely under the influence of Sufism.”70In what follows,he sought to connect the value attributed to prayer in Sufism with the newpietist emphasis on worship. Yet, in an attempt to illustrate his point, Wiederbypassed Sufiliterature concerned with statutory prayer and pointed instead tothe unique supererogatory prayers for which Sufidevotees were known.[The Sufis] went beyond the limitations of divine worship atfixed times duringthe day and instituted supererogatory prayers on a voluntary basis, in which adevotee converses with his God out of the depths of his heart. In particular, theydeveloped a new form of worship, the rite ofdhikr, which they would practice atany time, without a specific connection to location or time, and which constitutesto this day the primary observance of Sufiascetics.71On the surface, it would appear that Wieder was right to connect the add-itional devotions of the Sufis with the novel rites of the pietists. To be sure,both groups felt the need to supplement the prevailing norms, which in bothcases failed to provide a sufficient outlet for religious fervor and pious devo-tion in their respective communities, by introducing new forms of divineworship into the traditional canon. But that is as far as the parallel goes. Aswe saw in the previous chapter, there is no direct evidence of a comparabledhikrservice among the pietists, although there are tantalizing hints thatsomething similar may have existed in all but name and content. To thecontrary, supererogatory Sufirites are not the best model with which togauge the significance of the pietist prayer reforms, for at least two reasons.For one thing, we are concerned here not with supplementary and super-erogatory rites, but with what were deemed to be obligatory postures accom-panying the statutory prayers. The Nagid in no way judged these postures tobe separate from the required rites associated with normative worship, but infact fundamentally integral to them. Second, and most importantly for thepurposes of comparison, the novel postures were not intended for pietistdevotees alone, to justify a“mystical purpose”unsuited for the general com-munity of worshipers, but as a common ritual for all alike. This is not to saythat Wieder was wrong in associating the novel postures with pietism. As we69SeeSM, 161.70Wieder,Islamic Influences, 42.71Wieder,Islamic Influences,42–3.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiThe Devotional Life151"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"have seen more than once, the postures both originated among the pietistsand, even years after they werefirst introduced, were exclusively adoptedwithin pietist prayer circles, to the point of being denounced by leaders inthe main synagogues. Yet pietist leaders, from the Nagid to Abraham ibnAbī’l-Rabī‘a, envisioned the devotional postures as part and parcel of authenticJewish prayer, without singling out one class of worshipers from another.In thefinal analysis, a distinction must be made between the specificinfluence of Sufism, so central to the self-construction of Egyptian pietism,and the general impact of Islamic norms that have no particular mysticalvalence. It should be recalled that, unlike his predecessor Baḥya ibn Paquda,the Nagid was not averse to calling explicit attention to the Sufiinspiration forspecific pietist rites, even as he asserted an original Jewish source from whichthe original Sufis ostensibly drew their practices. In the last chapter, wepointed to a number of cases in which newly incorporated pietist practiceswere unambiguously ascribed by the Nagid to Sufimodels. If the paradigm forthe prayer reforms were likewise attributed to a Sufimatrix, we would haveexpected the same testimony regarding their Sufiprovenance as in the previ-ous cases. Instead, wefind a discussion regarding their similarity to generalIslamic (rather than specifically Sufi) rites. Each of the prayer reforms, fromprostration to sitting in rows, were familiar from the Islamic environment andwere not specifictoSufism proper. As already noted, the rites associated withSufism were included by the Nagid in the fourth part of theCompendium,exclusively devoted to pietist themes, whereas those associated with Islam ingeneral were incorporated in the second part, concerning normative practicesthat were binding on all worshipers in common.The question of Islamic influence weighed heavily on the Nagid, whoexerted a good deal of effort in refuting the claims of his opponents that thereforms were little more than Islamic rites in Jewish guise. One of theintroductions to theCompendiumwas a full-fledged definition of the prohib-ition on imitating gentile practices, which he was at pains to differentiate fromhis own initiatives.72In one case, he recalled the“spurious claim [of] one ofthose considered scholars in our time,”who argued that the Nagid’s proposedreforms were included in the prohibition“on account of the fact that thegentiles [do] thus in their prayers.”73His primary response, discussed at lengthin Chapter 1, was a rhetorical argument based on areductio ad absurdum:“This would result in the prohibition of fasting, charity, prayer, and numerouscommandments, in so far as these are [also] practiced by the gentiles...”74Anindication of how much weight the Nagid gave to these accusations can beobserved in the fact that he returned to the question of gentile imitation in his72See the reference inSM, 147.73SeeSM, 148, and the opposition of another scholar on similar grounds,SM, 149.74SeeSM, 153–4, and see my discussion on pp. 76–85.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi152Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"responsum on the pietist prayer reforms, with which we began this chapter,despite the fact that the questioner in that case never raised this as a potentialobjection.

The Muslims stand in prayer, just as westand. They bow from the waist, just as we bow during [the blessings]“fore-fathers”and“thanksgiving.”77Rather than avoid the mere suggestion of Islamic imitation in his writings andcommunal work, the Nagid sought instead to bring it out of the shadows and intothe full light of day. What might appear atfirst glance as an attempt to diffuse theaccusations by all means possible should, quite to the contrary, be seen as avigorous effort to reignite the conversation, by showing why it is not only notprohibited but occasionally even salutary to take a page out of the currenthandbook of Islamic worship. The reasoning is quite similar to the Nagid’sargument in favor of adapting the ascetic regimen of the SufisonthebasisofitsJewish roots, which we examined in the previous chapter, and to his generalobservations on the paradoxical necessity of the Islamic matrix for the renewal ofJewish piety.Abraham Maimonides, perhaps more than any other Jewish sage in themedieval Islamic Near East, including his father, conceded much spiritualmerit to Islamic piety and practice, from which Jews could and should draw avaluable lesson. From the purity of its monotheism to the piety of its practi-tioners, Islam provided Judaism with a mirror of its former self. By arguingthat the best of Islam ultimately derives from Jewish origins, Abraham posi-tioned himself in a long tradition of cultural appropriation. In his sweepingstudy of what he calls the myth of Jewish origins, Abraham Melamed hasnoted numerous examples from the Middle Ages (and other periods beforeand after) in which Jewish scholars justified interest in matters of generalculture—including everything from philosophy and poetry to science andmathematics—on the grounds that the non-Jewish wisdom wasfirst attestedby Jews or ought to be construed as ancient Jewish wisdom.78In his own way,75Lit. gentiles (so in the rest of the passage).76Lit.

Rather than merely emphasize the derivative statusof Islam, he turned the polemic on his own community, chiding them for theextent to which the daughter religion surpassed her exemplar. After centuriesof neglect of their native traditions, Judaism was now in a position of seekingits own inheritance from the hands of a foreign religion. This was not only thecase with the pietist (or, as we shall see in Chaptersfive and six, prophetic)regimen, which he believed to have been adopted by the Sufis, but with thecore belief in monotheism, fundamental to both religions. The Nagid noted,with not a little irony, that whereas the Jews“from the uttermost east to theuttermost west throughout the lands of Ishmael”are pure in their monothe-istic belief, the same cannot be said of all Jews living under Christian rule,“forthe faith of one [i.e. the Christians] is not unlike the faith of the other [i.e. Jewsof Christian lands].”79As for Islam,“the children of Ishmael received this[monotheistic] faith from the children of Israel and built the foundation oftheir religion upon it...”80The unavoidable logic of the Nagid’s intra-Jewishpolemic is that the restoration of original Jewish traditions, whether the revivalof the prophetic path or the purification of biblical monotheism, requires acertain embrace of Islamic faith and norms.81The same positive gesture toward the Islamic environment, coupled withthe internal polemic against current Jewish practice, is evident in the Nagid’sremarks on the prayer reforms. In a passage on the correct way to performprostration, Abraham contrasted the faulty custom prevalent among fellowJews in his day with the pure (and, in his view, originally Jewish) formmaintained by Muslims in worship. The allusion to an existing custom ofJewish prostration prior to the pietist reforms should come as no surprise, as anumber of medieval sources attest to the practice of partial prostrationperformed during a portion of the liturgy following the statutory prayer(known asnefilat apayimornefilat panim) among the Jews of the Islamicworld. These sources, including his father in theMishneh Torah, refer to thecustom simply as“prostration”(sujūdin Arabic,hishtaḥavayahin Hebrew).82This practice, as it developed over the generations, required the worshipers toturn their head to one side, apparently so as not to touch one’s bare head to thefloor of the synagogue.8379SeeMH, 51 and 55.80SeeMH, 51, and cf.SM, 85.81For a discussion of Abraham’s view of Islam, see my“Respectful Rival: Abraham Mai-monides on Islam,”inA History of Jewish-Muslim Relations: From the Origins to the Present Day,ed.

Forone thing, as we shall see when we look at his discussion of prostration, heconsidered this posture to be the form of bowing proper to the statutoryprayer itself, though not exclusive to it. More importantly for our presentconcern, he opposed the manner in which the Jews turned their heads in theact of prostration, rather than bow directly to the ground. Here he invoked thepotential criticism or even mockery directed at Jews by Muslims, who witnesstheir half-prostration and deride it as“the prostration of the Jews”(sujūdyisrael). As he put it, the custom“has gotten to the point of being notoriousamong the Muslims as the prostration of the Jews and has become the butt ofgossip...”84If the Jewish custom, in its current form, is unacceptable, themodel for reform—or restoration—is to be found within the matrix of Islamicworship:“One who prostrates in this way does not spread one’s limbs on theground entirely, but folds in one’s legs, with the hip against the thigh, like akneeling [animal], while the remainder of one’s body—stomach, chest, andhead—are positioned against the ground.”85Abraham’s concern for the image of Jewish worship in the eyes of neigh-boring Muslims may have been partly inspired by his father’s example.86In hiscapacity as head of the rabbinic court in Fustat, Maimonides issued anordinance (taqqanah) abolishing the silent recitation of the‘amidahonsabbaths and festivals when large numbers were in attendance in the mainsynagogues.87As Maimonides wrote in one responsum, his change to thesynagogue service was motivated by the casual talking and general disorderthat ensued following the congregation’s silent recitation and during thecantor’s repetition.88In order to remove the opportunity for these disturb-ances, Maimonides ordained that all worshipers pray in tandem with the“be-har,”9:5, and BT Megillah 22b, and see MT,“Laws of Idolatry,”6:6–8, and“Laws of Prayer,”5:14. On the rabbinic prohibition in the early rabbinic sources, see G. Blidstein,“Prostration andMosaics in Talmudic Law,”BIJS2 (1974), 19–39. Abraham addressed the nature and extent ofthis prohibition inSM, 162–5; see alsoHW, II:42.84SM, 145, and cf.SM, 142 and 170. As before, the word“Muslims”is a translation ofgoyim(lit.gentiles).

This is what they witness in thismatter.”89On another occasion, Maimonides repeated this justification withlanguage that recalls his son’s words:When it comes to prohibitions of the Torah, we say,“It is time to act for the Lord;they have rendered void your Torah,”and all the more so concerning the order ofprayer. Another reason for this is to remove the desecration of God’s name, inthat people think of us that our prayer is a joke and a mockery and [merely] tofulfill people’s [religious] obligations, something that is no secret.90The reforms enacted by father and son were by no means identical, and notonly for the reason noted by Abraham as to their degree of talmudic prece-dent. If Abraham sought to restore an ancient practice, Maimonides sought toremove one, although on the surface both may be perceived as uprootingcustoms that werefirmly held for generations. Yet the similarities are remark-able, well beyond the simple act of reform. Fundamental to both leaders, atleast in part, was the external motivation generated by the real or potentialperception of Jewish worship by their Muslim neighbors. The language in eachcase suggests that their private fears of Muslim impressions were grounded insome measure of reality rather than a mere hypothetical reaction. Maimonidesspoke of the desecration that“they witness”and that was“no secret,”whileAbraham, even more suggestively, alluded to the current Jewish practice thatwas“notorious among the Muslims”and had already become“the butt ofgossip.”The preeminent concern for both father and son was the perceived lack oforder in the Jewish synagogues, in contrast with the state of decorum prevalent89Teshuvot ha-Rambam, ed.

It is interesting to note an early Islamic admonition to the faithful to avoid talkingduring prayers so as to avoid the improper conduct of Jews and Christians in their worship. SeeKister,“‘Do not Assimilate Yourselves...’,”334, and n. 45. It is worth wondering whether the“mockery”Maimonides heard of Jewish talking during prayer was a result of the observation ofsynagogue worship by Muslims or merely the repetition of this early tradition.

A number hadsome precedent in the customs of Jews throughout the medieval Islamic world,although the evidence for Egypt in particular is not always forthcoming.It would, however, be wrong to assume that they were all born from a desireto conform to Islamic worship, and the intersection of Jewish and Islamiccustoms is not always simple to detect. What is clear is that, taken as a whole,the modifications initiated by the Nagid represent the most thoroughgoing—and, as we have already observed, self-conscious—adaptation of Jewish wor-ship to its Islamic environment. Equally alarming to opponents of the reformswas the sheer extent of the modifications enacted in a single gesture.In qualitative and quantitative terms, the prayer reforms have no directparallel to any previous case of Islamicization in Jewish worship, nor werethey viewed as such by either opponents or proponents. The number andextent of the reforms requires a certain degree of consolidation and categor-ization of the material. In what follows, the reforms are divided into fourseparate parts: preparations prior to prayer, and sitting, standing, and bowingwithin the prayer service itself. The overview provided here does not strive tobe exhaustive, but should be viewed as representative of the prayer reformsand their overall significance to the religious revival envisioned by the Nagidand his supporters.PREPARATIONS FOR PRAYERIn his laws of prayer, Maimonides included a well-known stipulation forconcentration in the statutory prayer, so as to ensure that one does not pray“like one who carries a burden and then casts it off before going on his way.”In order to avoid rote and mechanistic prayer, he added that one ought tofocus one’s mind for a period of time before and another period after prayer,just as“the early pietists would spend afixed time before and afixed time afterOUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"praying...”1Although Maimonides was drawing on an old tradition of pietistprayer, included in the Mishnah and discussed in both Talmuds, his inclusionof the principle raised it from a pious example to a legal standard for properconcentration in the context of prayer.2In the context of his own laws of prayer in theCompendium, the Nagidcarried his father’s injunctions further, likewise explaining the example set bythe early pietists as the legal framework stipulated by the sages, referencingin the course of his remarks a separate chapter earlier in his code on concen-tration (kavvanah) that unfortunately has not survived.3A contemporaneoustreatise on prayerfills in the gaps for how Abraham and his disciples followedthe example of the“early pietists.”The anonymous author articulated thebenefits of concentration as a kind of mental cleansing from the pervasiveconcerns of society, which consume a person’s attention during the remainderof the day.The more a person becomes occupied and absorbed with the world and takes anactive interest in other people’s business, listening to their conversations anddoings, engaging in their activities, the soul necessarily grows dim and thosefaculties critical to the attainment of its perfection grow weak. Among the benefitsof prayer is that the mind ceases to be attached to those distractions and one’sthoughts are purified of all dross, so that a person is able to attain mental focusand equilibrium. It is for this very purpose that the [sages] said,“The early pietistswould spend afixed time before prayer.”See how much the [sages], of blessedmemory, extolled the advantages of thisfixed time! It is [a time] devoted toemptying one’s mind and thoughts and to removing all distracting sounds andnoxious sights that come from a preoccupation with the doings of society andthat lie hidden in the recesses of one’s heart.4Although neither this treatise nor the extant material of the Nagid attests tosuch a ritual explicitly, one must assume based on these passages that theEgyptian pietists encouraged devoting a set time before the formal beginningof prayer for mental concentration. This type of meditative cleansing, as it isdescribed in the passage, was a more concentrated version of the solitarymeditation practiced by the pietists and described in the previous chapter.As with the solitary retreat (khalwah), the preparatory time prior to prayer wasdesigned to purify one’s attachments to worldly distractions and preoccupa-tions, allowing the worshiper to reap the benefits of genuine prayer, which was1See MT,“Laws of Prayer,”4:16, and cf.

As is well known, Islamic worship consists of an extensiveprocess of bodily ablution before each prayer (unless the worshiper remainedin a state of ritual purity,wuḍū’, since the previous prayer). According tocontemporaneous Islamic practice, the required ablutions include a thoroughcleansing of parts of the face and extremities.6In a suggestive passage in hisCompendium, Abraham Maimonides hinted that there may have been certainpietists who performed these additional ablutions, although without his bless-ing.“Whoever washes his arm[s] and obliges himself to wash behind his ear[s]and to rinse the hair on his head with water and to breathe water up his nosebefore prayer, out of imitation of Muslims, ought to be stopped and forbiddenfrom doing so, because it is not a Jewish custom, whether written or oral.”7Asnoted in Chapter one, the Nagid did not consider these Jewish ablutions atechnical violation of the prohibition of imitating idolatrous practices, for thesimple (though noteworthy) reason that he did not consider Islam to be an5See Halevi,Kuzari, III.5, inKitāb al-radd wa’l-dalīlfī’l-dīn al-dhalīl, ed.

As Naphtali Wieder observed over sixty years ago, the Nagid’s reformdrew on earlier precedent from Jewish practice in the Islamic world, partiallyendorsed by his father.9In his laws of prayer, after recording the practice ofpurifying the hands before prayer, Maimonides added an explanatory note:“Under what circumstances is one only obligated to purify one’s hands? For allprayers other than the morning prayer, whereas in the morning one mustfirstwash one’s face, hands, and feet and then begin to pray.”10The oddity of the requirement to wash one’s feet and face for prayer inaddition to one’s hands is attested by the quizzical comment of R. Abraham b.David (Rabad) of Posquières (d. 1198) to Maimonides’code, in which hesimply wrote:“I do not know why the feet.”What was surprising aboutMaimonides’requirement was not so much the details as the context. TheBabylonian Talmud includes a tradition requiring or encouraging a person to“wash one’s face, hands, and feet every day in honor of his Creator,”but thereis no indication that this washing was understood as a preparation or pre-requisite for prayer, prompting Rabad’s skeptical response.11As Wiedershowed with examples from Gaonic and later literature, Maimonides appearsto have drawn his requirement for more extensive washing before prayer fromthe prevailing custom of the Jews of the Islamic world, providing it with amorefirm foundation in talmudic tradition.12If Maimonides applied the talmudic injunction to wash every morning tothe context of prayer, the Nagid extended his father’s novel ruling one stepfurther. Central to Abraham’s theology of worship is the premise that syn-agogues serve as a substitute for the Temple and prayer for the sacrifices. As hearticulated this principle on one occasion,“For us who live in the exile, thesynagogueisthe temple that remains for us.”13As we saw earlier in thischapter, Abraham elsewhere expressed a similar idea in his chastisement of8For the Nagid’s view of Islam, see my“Respectful Rival: Abraham Maimonides on Islam,”inA History of Jewish-Muslim Relations: From the Origins to the Present Day, ed.

See alsoSM, 111–12, where he again laments that thesynagogue is all that remains after the fall of the Temple, yet“our eyes have been blinded fromthe travails of the exile, to the point at which we have added to the [divine] wrath against us byour own doing, by neglecting these remnants [i.e. the synagogues] that remain to us.”OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiPrayer Reforms161"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"the people for their lethargy in religious worship:“The Temple is destroyed onaccount of our sins. Sacrifice and all that is connected with it is no longeravailable to us. All that remains is prayer and similar [devotions], yet no onegives them any heed.”14But it is one thing to draw a parallel between thesanctuary of old and the exilic sanctuaries of latter-day synagogues, andanother matter altogether to rewrite synagogue ritual on that basis. Applyingthis paradigm to the preparatory ablutions before prayer, the Nagid empha-sized the importance of washing the feet and its foundation in Jewishlaw, while conceding that its level of obligation is not equal to that forwashing the feet.While the purification of the hands is an essential requirement, without whichone has not fulfilled one’s obligation, it is preferred and recommended to washone’s hands and feet together, not only during the morning prayer, but for eachand every prayer. For“the prayers were established on the model of the sacrifices”(BT Berakhot 26b). Prayer occupies the place of sacrifice, and the Torah states,“You shall make a bronze basin...and [Aaron and his sons] shall wash [theirhands and feet from it]”(Ex. 30:18–19)...One is obligated to practice washingof hands and feet before each prayer and ought not to neglect it unless absolutelynecessary. If a proof [for the position of my opponents] may be adduced from thewords of David,“Let me wash my hands in cleanliness [and circle Your alter,O Lord]”(Ps. 26:6), a proof may also be brought from the words of the Torah,“They shall wash their hands and feet”(Ex. 30:21). In this way, there is asimilarity to the service of the Temple...15The argument adduced by the Nagid for the washing of the feet reflects hisnovel approach to the assimilation of Islamic modes of worship to the Jewishtradition. Unlike the ablution of the arms, nose, or hair, for which no justifi-cation could be found apart from the imitation of gentile rites, Abraham didfind an authoritative source for the washing of the feet in the Jewish tradition,but in a rather unexpected place. He did allude to the talmudic source utilizedby his father, although he carefully omitted any reference to washing ofthe face, emphasizing instead the hands and feet. He likewise extended theinjunction to wash the feet to include every prayer, again departing from hisfather’s precedent, which explicitly limited the practice to the morning.16Even more interesting, and characteristic of his approach in general, was hisappeal to biblical precedent by drawing a parallel to the priestly service in theTemple. The Nagid used the model of priesthood on other occasions, but thisis the only example in which worshipers were compared to priests for thepurposes of adopting rites allocated to them in the context of the ancient14SM, 184.15SeeSM,69–70, and cf.SM, 61.16See, however,SM, 70, where the Nagid did refer to the talmudic parameters, but as aminimum and not as a maximum, and without adducing any particular significance to thewashing of the face.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi162Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"sanctuary.17The use of priestly precedent in this context reflects the lengths towhich Abraham Maimonides was willing to go in order to provide an authen-tic Jewish foundation to rites that were absent from current Jewish practice yetcharacteristic of the immediate Islamic environment.Part and parcel with the ritual purification of the feet was the understandingthat prayer, according to this model, was to be performed without shoes.Whereas Maimonides made the wearing of shoes conditional on the localcustom to wear footwear in the presence of honored individuals, the Nagidviewed the prevalent custom of wearing shoes not as the optimal practice, butas a concession to necessity.18The sages“only permitted [the wearing ofshoes],”he contested,“when absolutely necessary, not that a person mayenter the synagogue with shoes that have dirt orfilth on the bottom.”19Ratherthan relegate the matter solely to a difference in local custom, the Nagiddismissed what he viewed as the permissive stance of the sages (and, byextension, the current practice) as a last resort in extreme circumstances,reserving his own reform as the normative and optimal practice under normalconditions.It is interesting to note that Maimonides described the custom of“all Jewswho live in Sepharad and the Maghreb, in Shin‘ar [Iraq] and the Land ofIsrael...to place rugs to sit on [in their synagogues], while in the cities inEdom [Christendom], they sit on chairs.”20Abraham also wrote of the customof placing rugs in the synagogues, and even using mats when praying privatelyat home, but nowhere is this connected directly with praying without shoes.21While the custom of praying barefoot is attested among the early Jews ofArabia, perhaps even influencing early Islamic worship, the reform introducedby the Nagid must be seen as part of an independent effort to revive ancientdevotional forms, whose roots theoretically originated in ancient Jewish trad-ition but which were in practice attested only in the religious matrix of theneighboring environment.22SITTINGAt the heart of Abraham Maimonides’prayer reforms was a concern torecapture the solemnity and ceremonialism of authentic prayer.

The formalaspect of prayer was considered a vehicle for inner experience and its restor-ation was deemed vital to a renewal of religious life. An outgrowth of thisattention to formalism in the thought of the Nagid, and reflected in pietistpractice, was a renewed emphasis on the proper postures associated withgenuine worship. Thefirst set of devotional postures, to which we turn now,consists of various modes of sitting in a mannerfitting worship. As it turnsout, the simple act of sitting for prayer and the concomitant seating arrange-ment of worshipers in the synagogue became a source of great contention inEgypt, fueled entirely by the Nagid’s polemical reforms. While he neverformally imposed these modifications, his proposals for synagogue reformbecame the occasion for profound and politically contentious divisions in theEgyptian Jewish establishment.In the query addressed to Abraham Maimonides, with which we began thischapter, it is evident that among the most striking features of pietist worshipwas, quite literally, its rearrangement of the traditional seating structurecommon to the Jews of the medieval Islamic world (and which, in largemeasure, has continued unchanged down to the present day in Sephardic,Middle Eastern, and North African communities). As Abraham described it,the prevalent custom was for worshipers to arrange benches and pillowsaround the walls of the synagogue and to sit such that everyone faced everyoneelse, including the elders of the congregation, who sat with their backs to theark and their faces toward the worshipers.23As we noted earlier in thischapter, Abraham confessed to having sat with the elders in this manner atthe beginning of his period of headship,“before God removed the veil frombefore my eyes, leading me to repent to Him for this and similar [errors].”24Bycontrast, we are informed by the author of the query, when the pietists prayin their private prayer circles,“they sit for the‘hymns of praise’and for theblessings of the recitation ofshema‘in fear and awe, their faces toward thesanctum, which is in the direction of the land of Israel and Jerusalem andthe Temple of the Lord...taking it upon themselves to sit in the same way inwhich they stand for the prayer [toward Jerusalem].”25That is to say, they didnot sit around the walls facing one another, but in rows facing the ark, in thedirection of the Jerusalem Temple, much as it was the custom for both pietistsand non-pietists to face Jerusalem during the standing statutory prayer.26While the Nagid used the classical Hebrew term for sanctum (qodesh)to23SeeSM, 98.

The natural and frequent use of the wordsuggests that it was deemed a neutral (and perhaps colloquial) term—a clearmark of the Islamic environment yet devoid of any exclusively Islamic con-notation in this case.27In his response to the query on the pietist prayer reforms, the Nagidprovided a condensed version of the justification for the change that he offeredin theCompendium. The key source cited by the Nagid in both cases was thefollowingbaraitain the Tosefta on the proper arrangement of worshipers inthe synagogue:“How do the elders sit? [They sit] with their faces facing thepeople and their backs facing thesanctum...And the entire congregationfaces thesanctum.”28While thebaraitadoes not specify precisely how thecongregation of worshipers is to be (or was) arranged vis-à-vis the elders,Maimonides inferred this from the fact that thebaraitadescribes the elders asfacing the congregation and the latter facing thesanctum. In his remarks onsynagogue arrangement in his code, he added the following coda to the wordsof the Tosefta:“And the entire congregation sits in rows, each row behind therow in front of it, such that the entire congregation faces thesanctum, theelders, and the ark.”29Maimonides’addition as to the congregation sitting inrows need not be taken as an indication that he intended to reform theprevailing practice in his day, nor does this arrangement appear anywhereelse in his writings or responsa, but merely as an interpretive interpolation ofthe original tradition.30the current custom was that the sages only obligated worshipers to face this direction for thestanding prayer and not for the entire worship service.

To justify his own reforms in the eyes of his contemporaries,and especially his fellow scholars, the authenticating source could not merelybe his father’s code, a recent (and, as we saw in Chapter three, somewhatcontroversial) composition in thefield of Jewish law, but one of the founda-tional texts of the rabbinic tradition, on which no legitimate doubts oraspersions could be cast by his opponents. He made no secret of the oppos-ition to his reform in hisCompendium, although he could now dismiss theseopponents as committing“a transgression against the language of thebar-aita,”and acting“not in accordance with the words of the sages.”32Having allbut established the bonafide credentials of his reform, Abraham accused hisopponents (and, by implication, the entire community apart from his coterieof followers) of“sitting in the manner in which people sit down for aconversation one with the other, not sitting in a way that isfitting for one tospeak in the presence of his Creator.”33The latter remark exposes the fact that the Nagid’s polemic was not so muchabout restoring an ancientbaraitato its proper place, as rehabilitating thedignity and decorum of the synagogue. The formal character of the worshipwas a reflection of its spiritual content, with the implication that one could notbe reformed without the other. In this case, the haphazard and disorderlyseating arrangement in the synagogues was more conducive to a casualconversation than a meeting with the divine. As a result, Abraham’s insistenceon sitting in rows during the entire prayer service was not merely directed atthe congregation as such, but also at their leaders, the“elders”in the languageof the Tosefta, who justified their practice of facing the congregation on theverybaraitaused by the Nagid in defense of his reform.In keeping with his effort to provide an authoritative, if unconventional,interpretation of thebaraita, Abraham explained that, according to theTosefta, congregational elders were permitted, though by no means required,to face the worshipers and turn their backs to the ark. The reason for theTosefta’s concession to the ideal arrangement, he argued, was the expectationthat beholding the faces of the elders would induce greater reverence among31SeeSM,96–7.32SeeSM, 96, andTeshuvot, 63, no. 62, respectively. See also his remarks inSM, 99, to theeffect that“the current customs are haphazardly arranged.”33SeeSM, 96.

In their own day, given that the elders are no longer models ofpiety, but“display arrogance in the way in which they sit in the synagogue,sitting upon elevated seats and reclining on cushions, sometimes even in thehekhalitself,”34the concession granted to the elders, he argued, no longerapplied. After a brief period during his early time as Nagid, in which he, too,sat facing away from the ark, Abraham came to the conclusion that the entirearrangement, for elders and lay worshipers alike, required reform from itscurrent laxity.35“Under these circumstances,”he attested,“I myself and RabbiAbraham the Pious, may the memory of the righteous be a blessing, estab-lished our custom, along with those who followed our example.”36If the customary seating arrangement was to be reconstituted from aninformal arrangement of worshipers along the walls of the synagogue to asolemn pattern of orderly rows, the physical form of seating for eachworshiper was itself refined to reflect the ideal mode of sitting“in thepresence of his Creator.”37As we shall see toward the end of this chapter,the physical posture for prayer was, with few exceptions, considered integralto the experience of worship itself. One who exhibits the proper posture forsitting was said to perform“a sitting conducive to worship”(julūsta‘abbud)or“a devotional sitting”(al-julūs al-ta‘abbudī).38Worship should not beperformed“sitting while leaning against the wall...or sitting like someonerelaxing at home or in a private space among friends and family, but...‘likea servant before one’s master’(BT Shabbat 10a).”39Two practical conclu-sions were drawn from the ideal of sitting in the divine presence. Thefirstwas the importance of facing one’s master in supplication, which in the caseof prayer includes facing the direction of Jerusalem.40The second, addressedby the Nagid in the context of maintaining proper“bodily posture”(waḍ‘al-badan), was the way in which the worshiper ought to sit while facingJerusalem.In this manner, the person sitting ought to sit during worship in the manner inwhich a servant would sit properly disposed (muta’addib) in the presence of hismaster, when the latter grants him permission to sit.

But Abraham’sextensive justification of his changes was only partly concerned with theaccusations of imitating gentile worship. The bulk of his explanationinvolved a lengthy examination of the native Jewish sources that ostensiblyrequire kneeling and arrangement in rows. The Nagid’s appeal to trad-itional sources in this instance was typical of other cases, in that his novelapproach in general required a novel reading of the sources. We havealready seen his insistence that the reading of the Tosefta provided in hisfather’s code was the only conceivable interpretation for this text. But hisreliance on novel interpretations was equally—if not more vividly—manifest in the case of kneeling. Here his only sources for the Jewishtradition of kneeling in prayer were biblical, drawing repeatedly on thepersonal prayers of Solomon and Daniel as witnesses of this gesture inancient Jewish worship.42As he acknowledged elsewhere, where there is no rabbinic injunctionprescribing or prohibiting, one must infer logically from the availableinformation on ancient practice known from the biblical tradition.43With no explicit rabbinic tradition or continuous Jewish custom fromwhich to draw support, Abraham Maimonides constructed a novel inter-pretation of the biblical verses as authoritative and binding models for theoriginal posture of kneeling practiced by the prophets (and presumablythe people) before it was corrupted and ultimately forgotten over thecourse of the exile. As with the other postures, restoring the pre-exilicforms of prayer was to be part and parcel of the religious revival necessaryfor bringing an end to the long exile and inaugurating the ultimateredemption.41SM,99–10042See I Kings 8:54 and Dan. 6:11, cited a number of times by the Nagid in support of thisreform.

The rationale behind the effort to restructure the seating arrangementin the synagogues, as noted in the previous section, was two-pronged. Itinvolved,first and foremost, a reinterpretation of the early tradition onsynagogue arrangement in the Tosefta, but it also involved a logical deductionof the proper orientation in prayer based on the classical rabbinic conceptionof prayer as standing in the divine presence, in this case requiring theworshiper to face the Temple in Jerusalem.44As the Nagid alluded in hispolemical remarks against his opponents, one local scholar dismissed thisorientation for all prayers apart from the standing statutory prayer, whichboth sides in the dispute agreed was to be performed facing Jerusalem, as if inthe presence of God. But if the anonymous scholar, and the prevalent customto which he gave voice, required worshipers to face the same direction duringthe standing prayer, it did not demand their arrangement in orderly rows,permitting them to stand up from any point in the synagogue where they hadpreviously been sitting. The new arrangement advanced by the Nagid and hisfellow pietists required the same formal division into rows for the entireservice, whether sitting on the knees or standing for set prayers.As with the rationale for the change in seating arrangement, Abraham Mai-monides justified his requirement to stand in orderly rows on the basis of a ratherobscure rabbinic source. Unlike in the previous case, however, he could not rely onhis father’s interpretive precedent, yet he sought in similar fashion to portray hisunconventional exegesis as both exclusive and normative. The text in question wastaken from the Mishnah, from the unlikely tractate of Avot, an atypical source fordetermining legal procedure of any kind. It is derived from a unit delineating theten miracles which befell the people during the days of the Temple. The eighthitem on the list reads as follows:“They would stand close together (‘omdimṣefufim), yet they had sufficient room in which to prostrate.”45The originalmeaningofthispassageseemsratherstraightforward,althoughtheuseoftheformṣafufis unique in early rabbinic literature.46It is, however, quite certain thatthe Mishnah was not concerned with establishing normative law, nor was it adescriptive account of the manner in which the people would stand in the Templecourt. In the Nagid’s reading, on the other hand, what appears atfirst glance as amiraculoustraditiononTempledaysisrereadasanindicatorofproperworship.44Although this idea is implicit in a variety of talmudic sources, it is formulated most clearlyby Maimonides, MT,“Laws of Prayer,”4:16.45M.

This is not in accordancewith the ancient Jewish practice described in the Mishnah:“They would standṣefufin47...”This is the required arrangement, while the other one [i.e. theprevailing practice] is a faulty custom which ought to be restored to its requiredform.48If one were not paying careful attention to the Nagid’s application of the text,one would hardly think twice of its use in this context. The Mishnah was givenin its barest form, without additional clarification as to its application ormeaning. Unexpectedly, however, the Nagid achieved much the same goal inhis use of this source from the Mishnah as in his earlier citation of the Tosefta,although by an entirely different means. Rather than insisting on a giveninterpretation of the passage, as in the previous case, Abraham merely alludedto the intended meaning of the Mishnah, leaving one to piece together how itserves as a prooftext for his understanding of the required ritual. If one were toread the wordṣefufimin this Mishnah along the lines of our translation above(“close together”), its application in this passage would be incomprehensible.But, as Naphtali Wiederfirst demonstrated in his study of the Islamic back-ground to these reforms, Abraham Maimonides read the wordṣafufnot as“compact”(as variations of the rootṣafafwere universally applied in classicalrabbinic literature), but in light of the Arabic wordṣufūf(sing.ṣaff), meaning“rows.”49With this reading of the word, Abraham’s application of the Mish-nah in Avot comes into clearer focus. In contrast to the haphazard configur-ation of worshipers in his day, the traditional arrangement in the Temple wasthus understood to be designated in orderly rows, an arrangement thatallowed everyone present sufficient room to prostrate in the course of theirworship.It is tempting to read the Nagid’s omission of any clarifying clause provingthe validity of his interpretation as an implicit acknowledgment of the ques-tionable nature of his Arabic rendering of the Hebrew word. If he were toinvoke the Arabic etymology, one would imagine that it could have under-mined his own efforts at reaching his coreligionists. Paradoxically, the oppos-ite is more likely to have been the case.

The novelty of hiscitation was therefore not so much in his interpretation as in his application ofthe passage. Building on a common conception of what Jewish worship lookedlike in the Temple courtyard, Abraham Maimonides converted a traditionabout the miraculous nature of Temple worship into a normative legal frame-work for Jewish worship suitable for all time.This last point is directly connected with the Nagid’s emphasis on Templeworship as a model and precedent for Jewish prayer in his own day.51Theorderly arrangement in rows was explicitly identified with“the custom [prac-ticed] in the Temple”(sīrat bet ha-miqdash).52The preoccupation with Tem-ple norms was part and parcel of the messianic ambitions of pietist thought, towhich we shall return in thefinal chapter, according to which the exiliccustoms that had long passed for Jewish rites would at last be restored totheir proper format. The other reason for the special interest in Temple ritual,connected with thefirst, was the belief that the more original a rite in thehistory of Jewish worship, the more authentic and authoritative it was forpresent and future practice. Abraham Maimonides drew on his father’sprinciple of greater legal weight granted to talmudic law over later (albeitestablished) customs.53Based on his defense of his prayer reforms, we may saythat Abraham went a step further by attributing legal authority to all pre-exilicprecedent, whether rooted in the Bible or Temple lore, and viewing the latteras the groundwork for the rehabilitation of authentic Jewish worship in hisown day.In his explanation of the standing posture in theCompendium, AbrahamMaimonides attested to the fact that the importance of standing in prayer is a“matter confirmed by reason,”based on its use in formal human etiquette.“Given that standing is a proper form of respect, which a servant shows to hismaster as part of his service, it is incumbent upon the worshiper to standupright during worship.”54But if the statutory standing prayer was the coresection requiring a standing position in talmudic law, Abraham and his fellowpietists applied the same logic of proper etiquette to other prayers not previ-ously designated as times for standing.55Worshipers were encouraged tostand for special sections of the hymns of praise recited prior to the blessingsofshema‘, while the prayer leader was enjoined to stand for the entire51See the earlier discussion on ablution of the feet.52SeeSM, 194.53See my remarks on this subject in“The Maimonidean Legacy in the East: A Study of Fatherand Son,”JQR102 (2012), 211–16.54SeeSM,72–3.55On the obligation to stand for the central prayer, known from the early medieval periodsimply as“standing”(‘amidah), see BT Berakhot 30a and MT,“Laws of Prayer,”4:3.

He distinguished between the legal guidelines for individual wor-shipers, which do not require one to stand, and the custom for the congrega-tion as a collective body, in which the prayer leader representing the groupmust stand throughout.“Nevertheless,”he added,“if a scrupulous individualor group of individuals (mujtahid au mujtahidūn) decide to stand on theirown like the prayer leader and require themselves (yultazim) [to stand] duringthe blessings ofshema‘and theshema‘itself, just as they do during the[statutory] prayer, how praiseworthy this would be (hare zeh meshubaḥ)!”57An even more forceful stipulation for standing was made in the case of thesanctification prayer, known as theqadish. Although none of these innov-ations were imposed in the main synagogues, Abraham described his injunc-tion to stand during these prayers as one of the customs he and his followersestablished in their own prayer circles. Local customs regarding theqadishdiffered from place to place, and the Nagid went to great lengths describing thecustoms with which he was familiar (“I investigated all the divergent customspeople practice in this area, which I either witnessed or heard reportsabout”),58but no custom with which he was familiar required worshipers tostand for everyqadish. He observed with some interest the custom to stand fortheqadishrecited at a burial service, for which he considered a number ofpossible explanations. At the end of his speculations on this custom, Abrahamused the occasion to propose an entirely different approach to the question ofwhether to stand and why:As for me, I don’t see the need for such an elaborate argument for why to standduring this prayer, whose composition was intended to glorify His name, may Hebe exalted, nor [do I see] what a great burden it is to stand for something of suchgreat importance! For this reason, I have established the custom, out of my ownvoluntary desire (istiḥbāb) and regard for the majesty of His name, may He beexalted, to stand during everyqadish.

Such a person lacks suffi-cient intelligence [to recognize its importance], but habit is his [only] excuseand of those like him.”The Nagid’s appetite for controversy led him in this instance to encourage ameasure of pious defiance among his followers against any scholars whoargued in favor of the prevailing custom.60“On account of those who havecontempt for the truth and wish to turn people away from devoting them-selves and increasing their effort in the worship of their Creator, may Hisname be blessed, we ought to be especially zealous in its [fulfillment].”61Significantly, however, the response to this criticism was more than a defenseof pietist devotion, and included its own criticism of those who neglected toadopt the reforms. What began as a desire to take on greater levels of piousdevotion beyond the minimum required of the community devolved into apolemical posture of pietist opposition to, and even bitter castigation of, theirfellow coreligionists.In addition to his general concern for standing in prayer, the Nagidintroduced one other posture to be performed while standing or sitting—thepractice of spreading out one’s hands in supplication. As with the case ofremoving one’s shoes, it appears from an early Islamic tradition that someform of this practice of extending the hands in worship was practiced by Jewsin the early Islamic period, and was initially spurned by Muslims as adistinctively Jewish custom.62A collection of early legal material emanatingfrom the Palestinian academy in Tiberias in the early Islamic period (if notearlier), known as the“[Legal] Exempla of the Jews of the Land of Israel”(Seferha-ma‘asim li-vene ereṣyisra’el), includes the following stipulation:“A prayerleader may not spread out his hands until he reaches the age of twenty and hasa recognizable beard.”63The fate of this custom in the Palestinian rite isunclear, although it was not mentioned as a current practice by the Nagid inhis discussion of the posture in theCompendium. It appears that what beganas a Jewish custom in the early Islamic period was later adopted as thestandard Islamic practice, only to be revived by the pietist movement underthe influence of the custom pervasive in the surrounding environment.60See Friedman,“Controversy for the Sake of Heaven,”and my“The Maimonidean Legacy inthe East,”for examples of the Nagid’s approach to communal controversy.61SeeSM, 79.62See Kister,“‘Do Not Assimilate Yourselves...’,”332, and n. 40 and 41.

Scripture provided theprecedent, but logic demanded its rehabilitation and application at the appro-priate place and time.65BOWINGThe culmination and focal point of the Nagid’s prayer reforms was theintroduction—or, as he maintained, reintroduction—of prostration as amedium of worship.66As we observed earlier in this chapter, medieval Jewryin the Islamic world did practice a form of prostration, performed during thesupplicatory prayer known asnefilat apayimbut not in the central prayer norat any other point in the service. In our review of Abraham Maimonides’polemic against the prevalent Jewish practice, we noted his barbed critique ofhis coreligionists for earning the derision of their Muslim neighbors for theirmode of worship. The latter, we are told, mocked the posture in the syn-agogues as“the prostration of the Jews”(sujūd yisrael), as opposed to pros-tration proper as it was performed in the mosque. Abraham Maimonides’chastisement was not simply a matter of distress at the image of Jewishworship among Muslims. It was primarily a concern as to the dissolution ofJewish rites from their original and authentic forms and their replacement,over many years, with exilic rites with no foundation in the ancient tradition.While this concern was particularly evident in the case of prostration, it wasby no means limited to it. On numerous occasions, the Nagid wrote of thecorruption of Jewish worship over many years in exile. I have alludedmore than once to the messianic implications of his preoccupation with64SM, 100.65See the Nagid’s comments on the relationship between the application of scripture andreason in the absence of an explicit rabbinic source,SM, 182.66Abraham distinguished between prostration as a devotional posture in worship and as asocial gesture of respect.

But, if thetheme of restoration was a major trope of the Nagid’s efforts, it was especiallyevident in the case of prostration. The following passage has been cited beforein a previous chapter, in the context of responses to accusations that thepietists were imitating Islamic worship, but considering its direct bearing onprostration and the rehabilitation of lost rites after years of neglect, it is worthciting again in this context:Be careful in this matter not to confuse a new idea and custom with ancient [ones]that have been neglected to the point of being forgotten and [only] later broughtto the attention [of the community], restored, and revitalized. This is the case inthe matter concerning us here, that of prostration, which we are now discussing.For prostration is an obligation of the law and ancient custom of the people, a factneglected over the course of many years in exile. And when one has been madeaware that it is an obligation and puts it into practice, it appears to the deludedand ignorant as if it is a religious innovation. It is an innovation only in relation tothe intermediate time [in which it was defunct], not in relation to the time of theoriginal community.68Given the pride of place devoted to the revival of prostration in Abraham’sCompendium, it is evident that it was perceived, by the author no less than byhis contemporaries, as the hinge connecting all the reforms and serving astheir common touchstone. In the eyes of an outside observer (as attested bythe author of the query on pietist prayer), it was the most distinctive feature ofEgyptian pietism and the most recognizable indicator of the influence of itsIslamic environment. But if prostration stood at the center of the prayerreforms, so it stood too at the center of anti-pietist polemic and communalcontroversy. One of the seven preambles to theCompendium, which servedcollectively as anticipatory arguments in defense of the work’s most contro-versial themes, was exclusively devoted to a justification of prostration, adistinction that does not appear to have been shared by any other posture orrite among the reforms.69What is more, the Nagid devoted no less than sixlengthy rebuttals of real and hypothetical criticisms of this reform, plus afinal67For this expression, seeSM, 75, and cf. 77 and 78 in that same pericope.

His remarks on the relationship betweenthe different reforms suggest a more internal motivation. As we shall explorein greater detail at the end of this chapter, the postures in prayer were intendedby the pietists both as a reflection of the internal states of the worshiper and,more commonly, as an outer inducement of these states. While these statesvary from prayer to prayer and from worshiper to worshiper, the mostfundamental and the most frequently invoked of these states was understoodto be humility in the divine presence. As an outer comportment conducive of aproper inner bearing, prostration occupied for the pietists the most exaltedposition of all the devotional postures. In a passage delineating the virtues ofthe various postures, the Nagid moved in hierarchical fashion from kneeling tostanding to bowing from the waist to prostrating, suggesting that, in additionto their separate merits, they help the worshiper progress to increasingly moreexalted forms of devotion.It is best...that one sit in a manner conducive to worship, namely in a kneelingposition, as I have explained. This is thefirst level of devotional postures inprayer...Worship may also be performed upright in a standing position, andthis is even greater and more exalted than sitting...In addition to standing,worship may also include bowing (rukū‘), which [the sages], of blessed memory,calledkeri‘ah, namely bending [from the waist] (al-ḥany)71...This posturedemonstrates even greater deportment and humility in His presence, may Hebe exalted, than standing upright. And, in addition to standing and bowing,worship may be performed with prostration, by casting one’s body and foreheadto the ground. This is the culmination of [all] the levels of devotional posture(nihāyat marātib hay’at al-ta‘abbud), for beyond this there is no greater form ofdeportment and humility available to the worshiper.72Much like the expanded application of standing, in which worshipers wereenjoined to stand beyond the minimum amount (on the grounds that standingin the presence of the Creator is a“matter confirmed by reason”), the uniquestatus of prostration demanded that it be performed with greater frequency.70SeeSM,184forhisremarksontheimportanceofarevival of prayer as a precondition for arevival of religious life in general, cited and discussed on pp. 240–1. The six criticisms and theirrebuttals, found inSM, 147–83, were concerned with the following problems: (1) imitation of gentileworship, (2) prohibition of prostration outside of the Temple, (3) prostration limited to extraordin-ary or miraculous occasions, (4) prostration notfor everyone, but only for exceptional individualsand only in privatem, (5) practice of prostration contrary to prevailing custom, (6) prostration notmentioned as a requirement by the talmudic sagesand hence an implicit criticism of the sages.71Note thelapsus calamiin Dana’s transcription ofanḥany(Ps. 19:13).72SM, 128–9, and cf.SM, 118.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi176Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"As we noted earlier, there was a widespread custom of prostrating with one’shead to the side during the supplication following the statutory prayer, but theonly other evidence for the general use of prostration was found among theKaraites.73Following the Nagid’s example, the pietists adopted the posture as areplacement for bowing from the waist during the main standing prayer.74Even in this prayer, however, Abraham encouraged his followers to prostratefor all of the benedictions, rather than merely at the beginning and end of the“patriarchs”and“thanksgiving”benedictions.75In addition, three other typesof prayers were singled out as appropriate occasions for prostration: glorifi-cation of the divine name, gratitude and thanksgiving, and petition.76Forexample, worshipers were encouraged to prostrate at the end of each chapterending with“hallelujah”during the hymns of praise andhallel, as well asduringbarekhuandshema‘, among many other places.77We are given awindow into the way in which the Nagid’s reforms were put into practiceamong the pietists in the responsum devoted to the topic. As we shall see, thesource confirms the Nagid’s strictures of prostrating notflat on the groundwith one’s arms and legs outstretched, but bowing to the ground from akneeling position, as was common among Muslims and Karaites alike.78They bow to the ground and prostrate in the form of bowing (ve-yishtaḥavubi-kheri‘ah)duringqadishandqedushah.

SeeSM, 141. There had already been a custom in Egypt, recorded in a responsum ofMaimonides, to bow upon reading the following verse in the evening service:“And the entirenation saw and fell upon its face and proclaimed,‘The Lord is God, the Lord is God’”(I Kings18:39).

In an article on the subject, Tzvi Langermann has argued that, inthe case of prostration,“Abraham’s reform represents not a direct importationof Muslim custom, but rather a relocation of a private practice (which itselfprobably owed a great deal to Muslim praxis) to the public space of thesynagogue.”80Drawing primarily from the exhortations to prostrate in thework of Baḥya ibn Paquda and Judah Halevi, as well as an anonymous pietisttreatise emanating from North Africa, enjoining devotees to prostrate inprivate spaces in the home set aside for worship, Langermann suggests thatthe practice of prostration was well known in Andalusian and Maghribi circlesas a private devotion.81The evidence for this practice is undeniable, but its influence on AbrahamMaimonides is, in thefinal analysis, inconclusive. Given his propensity tomention any customs pertaining to his reforms, and particularly that ofprostration, it would be highly surprising for the Nagid to omit any referenceto the rite, even in modified form, had it been known to Jewish contemporariesin the Mediterranean basin. On the other hand, even if we cannot concludewith absolute certainty that Abraham Maimonides drew on earlier practices inhis own reforms, the evidence does suggest that, among the Jews of themedieval Islamic world, prostration was perceived to be an authentic demon-stration of Jewish piety.82In one instance, it is evident that Abraham’s reforms appear to have beenthe catalyst for the spread of the practice of prostration beyond Egypt. In afragment published close to a century ago, a number of former French émigrésscholars, who had lived in Egypt for a period of time before completing theirvoyage to Palestine, were described as having adopted the particular modifi-cations to the posture advocated by the Nagid and his fellow pietists. It wassaid of“those who are currently settled in Acre, R. Joseph b. R. Matthew,R. Judah, and R. Samuel,”that they“bow and fall upon their faces, but without[facing] to the side, and when they pray it is on their knees with their facesto the ground.”83The double reference to falling on their faces (noflim‘alpenehem) and to praying on their knees with their faces bowed to the ground(u-fenehem ba-qarqa) suggests that the Frenchmen adopted both the modified80See Y.

It isclear, however, that, with the passing of Abraham Maimonides, pressurefrom opponents of the pietists increased considerably. His two sons, David(d. 1300), who succeeded as Nagid, and Obadiah (d. 1265), both experiencedthe ongoing disputes over prostrationfirst-hand. David was forced to close hispietist prayer conventicle and attend the main synagogue in 1250, after aformal complaint was issued to the newly installed Mamluk authorities againstthe pietists, and for a brief time he was compelled to take refuge in Acre (forreasons that remain uncertain) before being reinstalled as Nagid in 1252.85Even before this episode, however, we are informed of a clash that broke outimmediately following Abraham Maimonides’death concerning the practiceof kneeling and prostration in Jewish worship. In this case, pietist leadersappealed to the Muslim authorities for a formal ruling on the appropriateresponse to the opposing party.86The government’s response is not preserved,but the dispute continued to simmer until the authorities became involvedonce again in theembrouillementwith David and his supporters. The repeatedappeals to the Muslim authorities during the controversies over the pietistreforms testify to the deepening rift in Jewish society at the end of the Ayyubidand beginning of the Mamluk periods over the fate of Egyptian pietism. It wasmost likely in reaction to this crisis that Abraham’s son Obadiah wrote in hisTreatise of the Poolof the need for the utmost caution so as not to reveal one’spietist affiliations to opponents of the movement.“Should any of your prac-tices be brought under investigation, the unthinkable may happen87...It is84On the connection of Abraham Maimonides with the Jews of Acre, see A.

As the account makesclear, the pietists did not all bow in a synchronized motion, but each bowed ina slightly different manner from the others.

Depending onthe degree to which one has cultivated this form of devotionalism (andpossesses a certain predisposition), the natural expression of humility andfear of God includes a spontaneous need to bow one’s body to the ground.This inner impulse, which he describes as an overwhelming force or move-ment (ḥarakah), causes the worshiper to involuntarily prostrate in a state ofbewilderment (mutaladdidan). We have already noted a number of occasionson which worshipers were taught to cultivate this experience by prostrating atkey moments in which the liturgy invokes divine grandeur and instills a stateof sincere humility.92Following this idea to its logical conclusion, Abrahamsuggested that someone who recites liturgical passages mentioning prostrationand grasps their inner meaning, yet does not follow suit in outer prostration,“is like one who bears false testimony about oneself.”93Of particular interest in the Nagid’s remarks is his articulation of aninarticulate and involuntary movement from within, compelling the worship-er to prostrate. It is described as the physical embodiment of sincere humility,“such that one cannot but prostrate in a state of bewilderment and submis-sion”when standing in the divine presence. In a recent study on mysticalrapture in thirteenth-century Sufism, I called attention to the pervasiveaccounts of physical tremors and involuntary movements associated withdhikrand ecstatic prayer in Sufimanuals from the period.94Among themost interesting parallels to the involuntary prostrations described by Abra-ham Maimonides come from the pen of his contemporary, the Persian Sufimaster and founder of the Kubrawīyah order, Najm al-Dīn al-Kubrā(d. 1221),who wrote in Arabic and spent many years in Egypt. Describing the physicalmovements that occur uncontrollably duringdhikrin hisFragrance ofBeauty and Portals of Grandeur(Fawā’iḥal-jamāl wa-fawātiḥal-jalāl),Kubrārelated that“one’s limbs become light as if inflight, moving uncon-trollably and unconsciously (ḥarakātḍarūrīyah ḡair ma‘hūdah), like themovements of one caught by tremors.”95The involuntary movements,Kubrārelates, can cause the devotee to fall on one’s face in prostration.“He begins to tremble and shake (fa-yatazalzal wa-yuntafiḍ) and, overcome92See the section on prostration above.93SeeSM, 141, where the comparison is made to reciting theshema‘without wearingphylacteries, to which the concept of false testimony was applied in the Talmud (BTBerakhot 14b).94See my“Physical Embodiment and Spiritual Rapture in Thirteenth-Century SufiMysti-cism,”inLes mystiques juives, chrétiennes et musulmanes dans l’Égypte médiévale: Intercultualitéset contextes historiques, ed.

Here,too, there are important parallels in the ideas of thirteenth-century Sufimasters, although their direct impact on Egyptian pietism remains to beseen.98For the Nagid and his pietist disciples, each posture in prayercorresponded to a separate inner disposition and was performed chieflyfor the purpose of inculcating this disposition in the worshiper. Sitting in akneeling position in the direction of theqiblahwas“a preparation for thefocus and refinement of the mind, which is awakened and purified in onewho strives ceaselessly and dedicates oneself, progressing in one’s hearttoward increasing levels of sanctity.”99In a similar manner, praying withone’s hands outstretched was deemed conducive to inculcating a state ofhumility in a prayer of supplication,“just like a beggar who asks forcharity.”100The outer form in each case was meant to mirror and reinforcethe inner disposition of the worshiper.96See Meier,Die Fawā’iḥal-ğamāl, 25 (no. 53). See also Meier.,Die Fawā’iḥal-ğamāl,9(no. 20), in which the devotee is said to“tremble, grow agitated, and shake out of terror of whatcame over him, such that he is compelled to prostrate (wa-yasjud iḍṭirāran).”97See, e.g., the work of pseudo-Qushairī,Tartīb al-sulūkfīṭarīq allāhta‘ālā, ed.

The physical submissionof the body to the ground is the simplest expression of the state of humilityand glorification of the divine, which is the core of worship.103This is preciselywhy the exalted position of prostration among the various postures was not anargument for keeping it apart as a posture of the elite, but for its adoptionamong the people as a whole.“For prostration...cultivates meekness andhumility in the one prostrating through [the physical] enactment, [downward]movement, and placement [of the head upon the ground].”104The physicalmotion is“the greatest expression of humility and gesture of awe for the oneprostrating,”whether the latter is the most experienced pietist or the simplestworshiper.105The spiritual benefits more than repay the effort required to bowto the ground, as it is aimed“against one’s lower nature, which breedsarrogance, envy, baseness, and vice.”106In thefinal analysis, it was the self-evident power of prostration and theother postures to induce a state of sincere worship that led Abraham Mai-monides to devote the preponderance of his career exhorting his coreligioniststo embrace his prayer reforms. He conceded that, for“the individual elect,”such as the prophets and“the few whom the Lord calls”(Joel 3:5), worship canbe purely internal,“such that it is exclusively in concentration andthought.”107The vast majority of worshipers, on the other hand, require acombination of physical postures to arouse the proper concentration within.In so far as people“are made of matter and change from one state to anotherrather than remaining static, it is essential that worship [of God] in prayershould be now sitting...now standing...now bowing and prostrating...”108Yet, as we have seen in the case of Sufism, not even the devotions of theprophets and the elect are devoid of an intimate symmetry with the forces ofthe body.

Pietist leaders cultivated a fellow-ship of close disciples while simultaneously working toward a renewal ofdevotional practice in the broader community. The twin goals of the move-ment were mutually reinforcing from the beginning. According to the modelenvisioned by Abraham Maimonides, pietists were themselves to take on aleadership role as models and guides of religious practice, in some cases beingsupported materially for their service to the community.1More importantly,the pietist revival was expected to lay the groundwork for the messianicredemption that would ensue when the people turned in repentance anddevotion to the service of God. At the core of this messianic restoration—and its harbinger—was the belief in the imminent renewal of prophecy,believed by many pietists to be attainable through the ascetic discipline andmeditative techniques that had come to define the pietist movement.Much like the restorative purpose of Abraham’s synagogue reforms, thequest for prophetic renewal sought to bridge the gap between the idealizedpre-exilic past and the rehabilitation of the messianic age.2The restorativemessianic vision of the pietists drew on traditional conceptions of exile as atemporary aberration that would in the fullness of time return full circle to itsidyllic past. In the future redemption, not only was Israel to regain its kingdomand rebuild the Temple, but the spirit of prophecy would be restored and thedivine presence would again dwell in the midst of the people.3By the medievalperiod, the idea had crystallized in the belief that“in thefinal [redemption],1SeeSM,112–13. As discussed in Chapter one, the reciprocity envisioned by AbrahamMaimonides, modeled both on the biblical institution of priestly gifts and the rabbinic traditionof ten synagogue stewards (‘asarah baṭlanim), is the closest the pietists came (in principle, if not inpractice) to the Sufimodel of thekhānqāh.2Pre-exilic here refers not to ancient Israel before the Babylonian exile as in biblical studies,but to the state of the Jews before the destruction of the second Temple and the Hadrianicdispersion.

But the pietist doctrine thathas come down to us did not envision a radical equalization of prophecy as hintedat in the early midrashic sources and later formulated by Se‘adiah Gaon andothers.6Already in the rabbinic period, however, there are indications of a shifttoward an idealization of prophecy as the sign of spiritual merit.7In philosophicaland mystical circles of the medieval period, prophecy came to be viewed as thesummum bonumof the religious life.8Egyptian Jewish pietism, in many ways,bears the double imprint of philosophicalrationalism and ecstatic mysticism inequal measure, producing a unique synthesis of what has sometimes beendescribed as intellectualist mysticism.9The philosophical tradition provided thepietists with the theoretical foundation for prophetic attainment, while Sufismsupplied them with much of the language and technique of mystical illumination.Yet unlike either of these, the Egyptian pietists viewed their movement as vital tothe renewal of biblical prophecy and the spiritual transformation of Jewish society,giving their mysticism a unique sense of urgency at the dawn of a new era.4See the Judaeo-Arabic midrash included in J.

But just as crucial was its adoption of a certain philosophicaldiscourse regarding the nature and objective of prophetic attainment. Atthe heart of this discourse lay a conception of human perfection (al-kamālal-insānī),12derived from Aristotelian and Neoplatonic notions of humannature and the teleology of the human soul.13While most pietist authorsexhibited little independent interest in the philosophical literature behind thistradition, there was a considerable absorption of Maimonidean doctrines,which continued to exert a powerful influence on the movement for severalgenerations. After addressing the pietist theme of human perfection and itsphilosophical background in what follows, we shall return to the Suficoncep-tion of the prophetic path and mystical illumination further on in this chapter.The doctrine of human perfection was adopted from the Arabic Peripatetictradition articulated initially by al-Fārābī.

For him, it is not the philosopher but the prophet who is upheld asthe model of human perfection.17Unlike his predecessor, for whom prophecyconsisted of the perfection of the imaginative (rather than the rational) faculty,Maimonides declared the perfection of both faculties together the mark of trueprophecy.18By restoring prophecy to its exalted rank, Maimonides did forsubsequent Jewish philosophy and mysticism what ibn Sīnādid for theirIslamic counterparts.19According to his definition in theGuide, prophecyconsists of an“overflow overflowing from God”(faiḍyafīḍmin allāh), viathe active intellect, upon the rational and imaginative faculties.“This,”hedeclared,“is the highest state for a human being and the ultimate perfection14See M.

Those pietists who, like Abraham, were grounded in the rationalismof Maimonides, adopted a number of the latter’s presuppositions and precon-ditions regarding the nature of prophetic experience. Among the most regret-table lacunae of the pietist legacy is the loss of thefinal chapter of Abraham’schef d’oeuvreon prophetic attainment, the culmination of the pietist path.Mere fragments remain from this critical chapter, a number of which haveonly recently come to light.21From what has survived of this chapter andallusions to illumination in preceding sections, it is clear that Abraham lookedto his father as a model in his account of prophetic experience.22The mainfeatures of this process, from the reception of the divine overflow (faiḍilāhī)tothe interplay of the rational and imaginative faculties, are all present inAbraham’s work.23Key to Abraham Maimonides’doctrine of perfection is his rather idiosyn-cratic language of attainment—or, quite literally,“arrival”at the destination(wuṣūl)—a term long recognized as central to his mystical system. The conceptof arrival is repeatedly linked with the image of traveling on the path (sulūk,maslak,derekh hashem), and thus pietists (and their prototypes in the legend-ary past) are frequently designated as wayfarers (sālikūn).24The precise20Guide, II:36, ed.

As a result,“arrival”is usually best translated as“attainment,”as in the following descrip-tion of Joshua’s extended solitude in the tent of meeting in the wilderness:“Joshua remained in continuous solitary meditation in this tent, pursuing theunique path (sulūk) aimed at attaining an attachment to God (wuṣūl wuṣlatallāh), may He be exalted, afterward, namely the attainment of prophecy(wuṣūl al-nubūwah).”27As we shall see, Abraham conceived of the ultimatearrival as only fully realized with the ascent (or return) of the soul to the rankof the angels in the world to come, yet it began in this life with the intellectualillumination of prophecy.28The perfection of prophecy was thus a limitedperfection, the arrival or culmination of the soul’s trajectory within theconstraints and distractions of theflesh. The doctrine of attainment andthat of perfection are intrinsically linked in Abraham’soeuvreand it is notuncommon for the two to appear as a pair, as in the following:“‘But I amcontinually with You; You holdfirm my right hand’(Ps. 73:23): [This is] anallusion to one’s state following the attainment of complete perfection.”2925See esp. Rosenblatt’s remarks in his introduction,HW, I:52, 96–101. Maimon has correctlypointed to the ambiguity of the term, although he plays down its connection with revelation,which he sees as exclusive to Moses and the Israelites at Sinai. See D. Maimon,“The Limits of theEncounter between Rabbinic Judaism and Islamic Mysticism”(Hebrew),Aqdamot7 (1999),57, n. 59.26SeeMH, 66:“Then he shall know the Lord his God when his intellect and soul cleaves to theactive intellect and the two unite as one entity”(ve-ḥazar hu ve-hu davar eḥad). On the additionof the printed addition, see Margaliyot’s note,MH, 8, n. 6. That said, the passage echoes thelanguage of“cleaving”(devequt) used by Abraham Maimonides in his chapter onwuṣūl(seeHW, II:424, ll. 17–19), as well as the language of conjunction employed by his father, to wit“thesurvival of the soul with the survival of that which it cognizes, this and that becoming one entity(wa-kaunuhāhiya wa-huwa shay’wāḥid). SeeHaqdamot ha-Rambam la-Mishnah, ed. Shailat,366. Note also the similar language in Halevi,Kuzari, I.1 and IV.13, inKitāb al-radd, ed. Baneth,5 and 164, respectively.27Perush, 465 (Ex. 33:11). In the last phrase (wuṣūl al-nubūwah),wuṣūlhas clearly become atechnical term for attainment and cannot be read as arrival.

As withAbraham after him, complete knowledge for Maimonides is only possiblewith the attainment of the angelic realm:“Felicity and the ultimate end consistin the arrival (wuṣūl) in the celestial retinue.”The ultimate end or perfection ofthe soul consists in the conjunction of the human intellect with the angelicrealm of separate intellects, both in the intellectual apprehension that occursafter death and in the imperfect apperception glimpsed in this life.30Evenmore significant is Maimonides’use of the critical term,wuṣlah, in reference tothe intellectual bond between the human and the divine.31As just noted,Abraham used the termwuṣlahto denote the bond with God attained (i.e. asthe object ofwuṣūl) in the moment of prophecy. It is precisely this term whichAbraham seems to have identified with its Hebrew counterpart,devequt, thebiblical image he elicited to evoke the prophetic bond.32In light of the rare useof these terms in Sufiliterature to denote the goal or end of the mystical path,Abraham’s choice of the termswuṣūlandwuṣlah(and their correspondingverbal forms:waṣalaand, occasionally,ittaṣala) must be viewed as a deliberateextension of his father’s sporadic use of these terms in theGuideto denote theattainment of prophetic knowledge and intellectual attachment to the divine.33As did his father before him, Abraham identified the training associatedwith the prophetic path as a series of stages leading to ultimate perfection.“Prophecy,”in Abraham’s expression, is defined as“the highest state ofon human perfection as the end of the spiritual path that led his translator, Samuel Rosenblatt, todesignate the work asThe High Ways to Perfection.

The veryfirst chapter of Obadiah’s treatise openswith a direct entreaty to the creative fusion of traditions sought by Maimonidesand Abraham in their own works.

There seems to have been a considerable divergence in approachbetween those inclined more toward exclusively Sufimodels and those whoperpetuated the delicate balance of intellectual mysticism found in Abrahamand Obadiah. That balance is discernible not only in larger trends andassumptions, but in the technical vocabulary derived from these traditions.A number of anonymous works from this period testify to the creativeinterplay of Sufiand philosophical terms used to describe the ultimate stateof illumination.

In an explanation of Moses’hesitation before accepting the public role assigned him by God, Abrahamargued that the communal task posed considerable impediments to the spir-itual and intellectual perfection of the individual, suggesting that“[Moses]preferred to be in solitude with his own soul, immersing himself in attaininghis own perfection (takmīldhātihi).”64An individual mayfind himself in thenecessary, if undesirable, position of overseeing the public welfare, but the taskinevitably carries a heavy toll on the spiritual life of the leader.65Not all pietists viewed the secondary, or public, task of prophecy as a matterof mere personal discretion. For some it was an integral part, if not theprimary purpose, of the institution of prophecy. A curious example of thistendency is found in a treatise of philosophical pietism once attributed,interestingly enough, to Maimonides himself. The treatise, composed in thethirteenth century in Judaeo-Arabic and ostensibly written with a specificdisciple in mind, was circulated in medieval Hebrew translation under thetitle,“Chapters on Felicity.”66The relatively brief work is a remarkableexample of the heightened aspirations for prophetic inspiration that char-acterize this period. The combination of philosophical and mystical elementsis evident from the opening of the treatise, which exhorts the addressee topurify his heart like the saints (al-auliyā’) in order to enter the“company ofdictum (BT Bava Batra 12a) that sages are preferred over prophets, a passage that Maimonidesnever cited in the code. As we have seen, Abraham shared his father’s view of prophecy as themost exalted human rank. There is a responsum attributed to Abraham defending this dictumover those who view prophets as greater than ordinary sages—an attribution which is highlyquestionable in light of his stated position on the subject. SeeMH, 117–22. The responsum is notincluded in Cod. Sim. Jud.-Arab 2, the manuscript in the David Simonsen collection inCopenhagen University Library, the second half of which comprised the bulk of the materialin the Freimann-Goitein edition of Abraham’s responsa.64SeePerush, 231 (Ex. 4:13).65SeeHW, II:260, l. 16 to 262, l. 3, and esp. ll. 11–16. In light of much of what has beendiscussed in this book, however, it should go without saying that Abraham did, in fact, spendconsiderable effort and innumerable hours not only in managing the general affairs of thecommunity but in serving as a spiritual mentor to his pietist disciples. Abraham’s ultimatevision for Jewish society, as mentioned on more than one occasion, included the religiousguidance provided to the community by members of the pietist elite.66On this work and its author, see Davidowitz’remarks in his introduction toS. T. Davidowitz and D. Z. Baneth, ed.,De beatitudine(Hebrew) (Jerusalem: Mekitse Nirdamim,1939). It is interesting to note that this intriguing work has, subsequent to its publication byDavidowitz, been attributed by scholars variously to Abraham Maimonides and to his sonObadiah. See N. Wieder,Islamic Influences of the Jewish Worship(Hebrew) (Oxford: East andWest, 1947), 45–6, and Fenton,Treatise of the Pool,44–6, respectively. Although Fenton’sidentification with Obadiah, based on a number of thematic and terminological parallels, iscertainly probable, the latter may also be due to the fact that both authors hailed from similarcircles of intellectualist pietism.

This is as Solomon, of blessed memory, said:“Let yourspringsflow (yafuṣu) outward”(Prov. 5:16).70And Isaiah said:“You shall be likea watered garden, like a spring whose waters do not fail”(Is. 58:11). In thismanner, the early [sages], of blessed memory, said of one onto whom Godoverflowed a constant overflow and uninterrupted attainment:“Unto him isrevealed from heaven the mysteries of Torah and he is made into a spring thatnever ceases and a river that increases in power”(cf. M Avot 6:1).71The impact of Maimonidean thought on thirteenth-century Jewish pietism,both in Egypt and beyond, has only just begun to be recognized for the criticalrole it played in shaping the intellectual life of the movement. Even asMaimonidean scholars increasingly draw attention to the role of philosophicalmysticism in Maimonides’own writings, the rationalist component of Egyp-tian pietism remains largely unappreciated.72The mystical tradition cultivatedby Maimonides’pietist heirs is a critical chapter in the development of thediverse Maimonidean legacies thatflourished both east and west after themaster’s death. In the case of the doctrine of intellectual perfection, the fusionof philosophical and mystical elements is as significant as it is often subtle. Butthe intellectualist pietism cultivated by Abraham and his followers reflects asustained engagement with Maimonidean doctrine, with which they expectedtheir readers to be fully conversant. As we shall see throughout this chapter,Maimonidean precedent played a crucial role in the growth of prophetic67See Davidowitz and Baneth,De beatitudine, 1, ll. 1–4.68See Davidowitz and Baneth,De beatitudine,4,l.6(ruaḥha-qodesh), and 12, ll. 9–10(al-idrāk al-nabawī).69See Davidowitz and Baneth,De beatitudine, 9, l.1 (ittiṣāl kamāl al-sa‘ādah). See thedescription of the visions from 7, l. 14 to 8, l. 12, in which one experiencing this state is referredto as“living, perfect, perceiving”(ḥayy,kāmil,mudrik).70This is a clear literary echo of the Arabic and Hebrew verbs of similar meaning, a wordplayonly possible in the linguistic context of Judaeo-Arabic. As Baneth noted (10, n. 12), ibn Janāḥconsidered the Arabic and Hebrew verbs to be cognates.71Davidowitz and Baneth,De beatitudine, 10, l. 9–11, l. 172On the concept of philosophical mysticism, see p. 54, n. 43.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi200Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"speculation and the pursuit of mystical illumination that came to define thespiritual trajectory of the pietist movement.MYSTICISM AND PROPHETIC ATTAINMENTWithout explicitly claiming to have attained a form of prophecy, pietistwriters identified the prophetic experience—and everything resembling thatexperience—with a form of divine illumination and ecstatic vision aboutwhich they were more forthcoming. The range of terms for these states reflectsthe diverse traditions from which pietists drew inspiration. While some,including attachment (ittiṣāl), apprehension (idrāk), and perfection (kamāl),emerge from the philosophical tradition, others clearly derive from the mys-tical lexicon of classical Sufism. Among the latter, some project a sense ofintimacy and immediacy, as in the language of sensation, such as taste (dhauq,dhawāq) or smell (rā’iḥah), while others speak of revelatory vision, such asbeholding (baṣar,mushāhadah), illumination (ishrāq,tanwīr), and perception(shu‘ūr,istish‘ār). By far the most common term used by the Nagid, as alreadynoted, is the term for arrival or attainment (wuṣūl), alluding to the culmin-ation of the spiritual path (sulūkandmaslak) pursued by spiritual wayfarers(sālikūn).73These terms are occasionally paired with more straightforwardallusions to personal revelation (waḥy,tajallī), unveiling (kashf,mukāshafah),and divine communication (amr ilāhī).The adaptation of Sufimystical terms should not be misconstrued as asimple borrowing of language and ideas, but seen as a creative reuse of keyterms within the framework of pietist prophetology. As Yohanan Friedmannand Jawid Mojaddedi have each shown in different contexts, the well-knowndistinction in the Sufitradition between the prophets and the so-called friendsof God (al-anbiyā’wa’l-auliyā’) was less rigid for some authors than forothers.74From Tirmidhīin the ninth century to Ibn al-‘Arabīin the thirteenth,one can detect a strain of classical Sufimysticism that never aligned itself withthe doctrine of propheticfinality in an absolute sense, increasingly advanced bymainstream‘ulamā’from the ninth century on. I have recently added my voiceto the growing scholarship that recognizes a distinct prophetic consciousness inSufimysticism, suggesting that this important, albeit underdetected, tendency73See the discussion on pp. 191–2.74See Y.

One who arrives, for example, at a stateof inner solitude, described by Abraham as a form of inner sanctification,“reaches through [this state] the fruit of prophetic attainment or somethingresembling it.”79One who achieves a state of inner worship, whether purelyof the mind or with minimal use of the body, has reached a level“similar tothat attained by the prophets”(shibh li-māyuḥṣal li’l-anbiyā), and“may inthose moments speak with the holy spirit or something similar to it”(bi-ruaḥ75This was the subject of my address at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Jan. 2012),entitled“The‘Disciples of the Prophets’and Their Followers: The Quest for Prophecy inMedieval Egyptian Pietism and Sufism.”76See Ghazālī,Al-Munqidh min al-ḍalāl(n.e.)

One approach was to associate variousterms for prophetic inspiration with differing degrees of spiritual attainment.An instructive example is the adoption of the rabbinic language of the holyspirit (ruaḥha-qodesh), associated by the classical sages with a high level ofsanctity and virtue, yet designated by Maimonides as second in the hierarchyof divine inspiration.88Abraham, following his father, contrasted the highestform of divine communication with a lesser form“acquired as propheticperception or [divine] speech through the holy spirit or something similar.”89Yet for the spiritually adept, the attainment of the holy spirit is among thehighest levels to which one may aspire. According to Abraham, it is accessibleonly to those who have achieved a purity of inner worship such that they areno longer in need of outer forms. While still obligated in the public forms ofworship, such individuals have penetrated to a state of“true worship”knownotherwise only to the prophets.[Pure inner worship] is realized only by the select few as a result of certain states,for it is the worship of those who have attained the fear, love, and devotion of Godin the manner attained by the prophets...That exalted type [of worship], whichhas no outer form or express words, emanates from the purity of the concentra-tion of the heart that precedes it.

There is a strongtendency among the leadingfigures of the movement to read the illumina-tionist ideal back into scripture and, more importantly, back into the spiritualidentity of the religious community. The reconstruction of the prophetictradition, beginning at Sinai and transmitted through a succession of mastersand disciples, was a crucial part of this project. For this reason, the pietistdisciple could identify his individual quest for illumination as an integral partof the original mission of the people.The fusion of pietism and philosophy, exhibited in this letter and in otherdocuments from the period, may go some way in determining the nature ofthe prophetic illumination sought and cultivated by the pietists. On more thanone occasion, Abraham Maimonides alluded to his father’s doctrine of intel-lectual illumination at key moments of his exposition of the propheticencounter, intimating that the two doctrines, for all of their apparent differ-ences, were in Abraham’s eyes one and the same. He explicitly identified theglimpse of the divine essence (lamḥwujūdihi al-‘aẓīm)—the culmination ofthe pietist path—with the knowledge of God discussed by his father in theGuide.115The illumination attained by the souls of the righteous in the worldto come and already glimpsed, if only partially, in this world is identifiedby Abraham with his father’s doctrine of intellectual attainment.116YetAbraham’s embrace of his father’s philosophical doctrine was tempered by aconcern for its impact on the pietist faithful, for whom the well-worn way ofthe prophets and saints offered more assurance of safe passage.There are two paths leading (al-muwaṣṣilah) to this exalted perfection. One ofthem is long and arduous,filled with numerous and highly perilous pitfalls, whilethe other is more accessible, less arduous, and free from peril...The long,arduous, and perilous path is the path of philosophy. This is the path of inquiry,investigation, and logical demonstration, and there is no doubt that this pathleads to attainment (ṭarīq al-muwaṣṣil bi-lāshakk). Yet the reason for it beinglong, difficult, and perilous, as we have explained, is that one must delve into theirviews and maybe get caught in their errors concerning the most importantdoctrines, [such as] the creation of the world and [divine] knowledge of particu-lars.117Whoever gets caught in this is like someone who went for a stroll and fellinto a deep pit leading to his demise.

Here, as we shall see in the following chapter, Sinai wasinterpreted as a moment of collective solitude as the people prepared them-selves for prophetic illumination. The commentator made no attempt toobscure the fact that the prophetic encounter, even amidst the throngs atthe foot of the mountain, was at heart a solitary path of inner preparationculminating in a form of individual perfection. The searching lover of thebiblical canticle was indeed the individual seeker, longing for a vision ofthe divine beloved in a world of diversion and distraction.

As we shall see, the importance of the Sinaitic revelation, for manypietists, was its testimony to the original destiny of the people as a whole.Equally important, the biblical narrative records the wish that all Israel attainthe rank of prophecy, and foresees a time when the people will return to itsoriginal destiny at the end of days. One anonymous pietist commentarycaptures the perception that the prophetic chain has been broken and thatthe promise of Sinai, in its original form, remains unfulfilled until messianictimes. Only in thefinal redemption will Israel be restored to its originalmission.“Moses ordained that the elite (al-khawāṣṣ) of Israel—and, in thedays of Moses, all of them were of the elite—be guided toward the path ofthose who experience proximity to [God], may He be exalted...[God] ori-ginally intended that all of them become prophets, as it says“You shall be untoMe [a kingdom of priests and a holy nation]”(Ex. 19:6).

The language of“perfection”(kamāl) suggests a fulfillment of naturalhuman capacity, in accordance with Aristotelian teleology. Yet the philosoph-ical tradition articulated by Maimonides and his Muslim predecessors, such asal-Fārābīand ibn Bājjah, insisted that any intellectual perception attainedwithin the confines of a corporeal body was necessarily limited and incom-plete.

This reading of Maimonides, as we shall see,was apparently the one preferred by his son, Abraham, who similarly con-sidered a full grasp of the divine grandeur to be the privilege of souls in theworld to come, while allowing for a perception, or“taste,”of this ultimatecognition in this life by the righteous and pious.

A full contextualization of each passage willonly be possible if and when thefinal chapter is discovered in its entirety.In his introduction to“Pereq Ḥeleq,”Maimonides implicitly described theworld to come as an extension of intellectual-prophetic attainment or, moreaccurately, as its culmination and completion. In so far as prophecy (asMaimonides defined it succinctly in the sixth principle of faith in the sameintroduction) was conceived as the perfection of intellectual illumination inthis life, the knowledge of the divine in the world to come was thus the crown124See Pines,“The Limitations of Human Knowledge,”82–109, and H.

It is in this sense thatthe conjunction of the soul with the intelligibles constitutes for Maimonidesthe“ultimate end”(al-ghāyah al-quṣwah) that is only attainable in the world tocome when human nature has been perfected in an individual before death.126Seen in this light, the world to come constitutes a state of ultimate metaphys-ical knowledge, a state which was never, and could never be, fully realized inthis life, immersed as it is in physical sensation and bodily appetite. AsMaimonides put it toward the end of his“Book of Knowledge,”“There is noway for one to attain and know the supreme good of the world to come in thisworld, for in this world we only know and desire the good of the body...”127But, as his remarks in theGuide for the Perplexedintimate, this worldly veilmay serve to obfuscate intellectual vision, yet it does not eliminate italtogether.Matter is a great veil preventing the apprehension (idrāk) of that which isseparate from itself...As a result, whenever our intellect seeks to apprehendthe deity or one of the intellects, this great veil intervenes between the one and theother. It is alluded to in all the books of the prophets that we are separated fromGod by a veil and hidden from us by a cloud...This is the meaning of the verse,“Clouds and darkness surround Him”(Ps. 97:2)...Similarly when it speaks ofHis manifestation (tajallīhi), may He be exalted,“in a thickness of the cloud”(Ex. 19:9), and in“darkness, cloud, and fog”(Deut. 4:11), this was also intendedto hint at this meaning. For everything that is apprehended in a vision ofprophecy (yudrak fīmar’eh ha-nevu’ah) is merely a parable for a certain meaning.And although that great assemblage was greater than any vision of prophecy andbeyond any analogy, it also indicated a meaning, namely His manifestation, mayHe be exalted,“in a thick cloud.”128As with many passages in theGuide, Maimonides’words in this chapterexpress two realities simultaneously. The straightforward message is relativelytransparent. Matter serves as a barrier or veil to a human intellection ofmetaphysical truths. Any manifestation of divinity or of the separate intellectsby the human mind is necessarily veiled by the coarse matter enshrouding ournature. Yet, itself partly veiled by Maimonides’skeptical epistemology, thereference to divine“manifestation,”to a“vision of prophecy,”and to themental“notion”that is the true site of prophetic illumination point to anunderlying, albeit subtle, acknowledgment: that some degree of divine mani-festation in the form of prophetic mental vision exists for those who haveperfected their mortal natures, no matter how enveloped that vision maycurrently be in“darkness, cloud, and fog.”Unlike ordinary intellection,prophecy represents the highest level of perfection attainable by a humanbeing in this life, grasping at least part (through a“thick cloud”) of the126SeeHaqdamot ha-Rambam la-Mishnah, ed.

As withhis father, who revealed what he considered“mysteries of the Torah”in thathe believed the times demanded a temporary breach of the demand foresotericism (“It is time to act for the Lord”),130Abraham invoked the needto reveal the inner meaning of the rabbinic homily on the future vision of therighteous in the Garden of Eden:131“It contains a mystery...and the mysteryis not in accordance with its plain sense. I shall explain it—‘It is time to act forthe Lord:’The‘circle of the righteous’is a parable for the delight of their soulsin the Garden of Eden...‘and He stands in the middle of them’is a parable fortheir knowledge.”132In a parallel passage in theCompendiumon the inter-pretation of rabbinic homilies, Abraham further depicted the pleasure of theworld to come with intellectual perception:“The reward of the righteousmentioned as the world to come is their apperception of Him (idrākuhu),may He be exalted, which apperception is not possible in this world.”133Likehis father, Abraham identified the pull of earthly matter as the barrier betweenthe soul in this world and full perception.134Yet Abraham was far more explicit than his father in affirming that the soulmay still attain a high degree of perception in this life, even if it pales incomparison with the world to come:“Human perfection in this world,as greatas it is, is quite small in comparison with the complete perfection which it willattain.”135The reason, as he continues to elaborate, is due not to the prophetic129SeeGuide, II:36, ed.

Yet it is the destiny of thishuman soul to“sublimate itself and ascend and yearn within itself to reach itsspiritual, celestial world”(li-‘ālimihāal-rūḥānīal-malakūtī).140In otherwords, the ascent of the soul to the spiritual world is a process that mustbegin with rigorous training in this world.141I would suggest that the“spir-itual, celestial world,”from which the soul is said to originate, is identical withwhat he elsewhere calls the“world to come,”toward which it is meant toreturn. In a fragmentary passage from the lostfinal chapter of theCompen-dium, Abraham Maimonides made an explicit connection between the two:“How full of delight is the world to come and all contained within it! Knowthat the soul (neshamah) is a divine light, whose purpose is to sublimate theself (nafs) to increasingly higher levels.”Thenafs, he explained, ascendsgradually from the nutritive level to the animal level, from which it ascendsto the level of humanity and ultimately“to the active intellects, which are theroots of the souls and the source of the sciences and the virtues, and which arein proximity to their Lord.”The mission of each soul emanating from thecelestial realm is thus to sublimate itself back to the rank of the angels (i.e.active intellects), and in this manner to demonstrate“the nobility of theirworld in contrast with the lowliness of this world.”142136SeeHW, ll. 3–6.137For the language ofidrākin the context of prophecy, seeHW, II:382, ll. 2–13, esp. 7.138SeeHW, 224, ll. 19–20.139SeeHW, ll. 8–9 and 20–1.

We have already seen that Maimonides concededthat the prophet (unlike the mere philosopher) could obtain a“propheticvision”(mar’eh ha-nevu’ah), a glimpse of metaphysical truth“in the thicknessof the cloud,”that is, through an epistemological veil. But while Maimonideslaid the primary intellectual groundwork for Abraham’s conception of pro-phetic perception as a veiled glimpse of the world to come, he was by no meansthe sole influence. We have already observed the impact of the Neoplatonicdoctrine of the descent and ascent of the soul in this regard, which conceivedof the soul as in a perpetual state offlux, allowing for an ascent to differentlevels of consciousness within its earthly abode, beginning with the nutritiveand culminating in the purely intellectual, the realm described as the world tocome in contrast to this material world. Yet, as we have seen time and again, itwas the Sufitradition that played a key role in the development of Abraham’sspiritual worldview and especially his terminology, often in a creative synthe-sis with Jewish and other motifs. In one notable example, Abraham sought toexplain why the Bible at no point promises, let alone describes, the world tocome as the reward of the righteous, preferring to speak of the blessings of thisworld. In the process, he offers a further clue to his conception of the world tocome as a perception partially accessible in this life:Since, then, the law is for the entire nation, and [since] the hopes of most of them,according to the nature which God, may He be exalted, has implanted withinthem as an inborn disposition, are tied up with the world and enamored with it—“Not many are wise!”(Job 32:9)—God, may He be exalted, set their reward forobedience in this world, in accordance with their desire...[God], therefore, didnot describe in his scripture the precise nature of the good of the afterlife (khairal-ākhirah), for it is something which most people do not grasp or desire, exceptone who has tasted something of it or smelled its fragrance in this world (mandhāqa shay’an minhu au ishtamma rā’iḥatahu fīdār al-dunyā). These are theones of whom the sages, of blessed memory, say:“They entered the Garden ofEden in their lives.”143Such people are extremely rare, as one of them said:“Ihave seen the elect and they are few.”144Like his father, Abraham conceded that the full apprehension of the world tocome is“not possible in this world,”but left open the possibility that the selectfew may indeed perceive something of its essence during their lifetimes.145Atthis point, however, language seems to fall short of articulating the mystery of143SeeDerekh EreṣZuta, 1:18,Masekhet Kallah Rabbati, ch. 3adfin., and cf.Yalkut Shim‘oni,no. 367 (Ezek. 28).144HW, II:274, ll. 9–13, 15–21, citing from BT Sukkah 45b and Sanhedrin 96b.145See AIU II.A.1, 1verso, ll. 16–17 (lam yumkin).

While the experience is most certainly anattachment of the human intellect to the active intellect(s) in that“spiritual,divine realm,”the language Abraham reached for to depict this experience isnot, strictly speaking, intellectual but sensory. Drawing on a well-known motifin Sufiliterature, Abraham depicted the state of knowledge in terms of a“taste”or“smell”of the world to come, much as he earlier spoke of a taste ofdivine providence for the elect or a taste of the fruit of prostration or mysticalprayer for the pious.146A similar tendency to describe the mystical experi-ence as direct sensation (taste, smell, and even drinking) can be found in avariety of pietist works from the period, and points to the pervasiveness ofthe motif.147It is in the same vein that we ought to understand the languageof light and illumination discussed at length earlier in this chapter. Allsensory images, from seeing to tasting, serve to underscore both the direct-ness of the experience and its fundamental untranslatability into ordinaryepistemological language.148146SeeHW, II:204, l. 14, andSM, 131, 133, and 188–9. InSM, 133, Abraham concludes hisdiscussion by citing from Ps. 34:9—“Taste and see [that the Lord is Good].”147See, e.g., ENA NSI 10 (laminated 46),recto, ll. 12 (mudhāqāt wa-tanazzuhāt)and13–14(fa-yashrab min‘ayn al-ḥayāt), published by Fenton,“A Pietist Letter from the Genizah,”162, and IIFirk.

Frank (Leiden: Brill, 1992), 313–14, and see the compositepietist text published by Fenton,“A Mystical Treatise on Prayer,”147 (second paragraph, third line).148In addition to utilizing the language of“the world to come”(‘olam ha-baandal-ākhirah)and the“Garden of Eden”to denote the experience of the soul beyond the constraints of thisworld, Abraham drew on the term“permanence”(baqā’), referring to the“state of permanence”(ḥāl al baqā’). It is tempting to interpret this as a creative reuse of the classic Suficoncept knownby the same name, classically coupled in Sufiliterature with the state of“annihilation”(fanā’)—the loss of selfhood or individual consciousness in the unity of divinity. This combination offanā’andbaqā’, derived from their coupling in the Qur’an (55:26–7), is attributed in Sufitradition to AbūBakr al-Kharrāz (d. 899), on which see Schimmel,Mystical Dimensions ofIslam, 55. Whilefanā’in the classic Sufisense (as articulated by Ghazālīin theIḥyā) does featurein a very interesting fragment from the lostfinal chapter of theCompendium(Strasbourg BNU4110, 61, esp.verso, ll. 5–9), it is not found in the extant work of Abraham Maimonides. In TSMisc. 24.152, 1a,recto, ll. 11–13, Abraham wrote ofḥāl al-baqā’ba‘d al-mufāraqah. The choiceofmufāraqah(“separation”of the soul from the body) instead offanā’indicates that he wasindeed referring to the survival of the soul after death rather than a mystical attainment of theworld to come in this life. In this usage, Abraham followed the precedent of his father, who wrotein his introduction to Pereq Ḥeleq of the“permanence of the soul with the permanence of itsintellectum”(baqā’al-nafs bi-baqā’ma‘lūmihā), and in theGuidethat“the soul’s perceptiongains strength at the moment of separation (mufāraqah)...and the intellect remains in thateternal permanence (dhalik al-baqā’al-dā’im)...”SeeHaqdamot ha-Rambam la-Mishnah, ed.Shailat, 366, andGuide, III:51, ed.

What contemporarypurpose, if any, was reserved for prophecy in post-biblical Judaism? Did thetalmudic tradition not stipulate that prophecy, once the dominant religiousinstitution of ancient Israel, had ceased to exist once and for all? Talmudicaccounts vary widely on the exact termination of prophecy, from the period ofJeremiah to that of Alexander, but all versions concur that divine revelationwas a thing of the past well before the destruction of the second Temple.1Pietist writers did not attempt to deny such a deeply ingrained tradition, andopenly described the cessation of prophecy as a watershed event in thespiritual history of Israel.2The approach of Egyptian pietism to this traditionalconundrum was twofold. Thefirst, rather technical, solution was to refer toprophetic inspiration not by the classical biblical term (nevu’ah) but by avariety of alternative expressions, including the rabbinic (and Hellenistic)concept of the holy spirit (ruaḥha-qodesh).3The second and conceptuallymore interesting solution was the belief that the cessation of prophecy was nota matter of theological doctrine but a historical accident with tragic conse-quences. Ongoing revelation was considered the ideal for all times, as muchfor the guidance of the community as for the perfection of the spiritual elite.Unlike the Islamic tradition, which came to view prophecy after Muḥammadas inimical to its doctrine of scripturalfinality, the Hebrew Bible testified to1For a review of these traditions and their significance, see E.

This stateof affairs was no less true of the crisis of ritual praxis that Abraham workedtirelessly to rectify. In the view of the pietists, prophecy was as vital to Jewishlife as prayer or other essential rituals. The restorative vision of the pietiststhus looked backward to the original blueprint of the biblical and talmudiccanons for spiritual direction. Though much had been lost over the period ofthe exile, traces of what they considered the prophetic tradition were recon-structed from scattered allusions in sacred writ and stories of the prophets. Atthe heart of this vision lay the belief that the prophets had established a systemof discipleship and training to perpetuate the prophetic tradition for futuregenerations. For Abraham Maimonides and his colleagues, the chief task ofthose in positions of religious and communal leadership was to restore thelegacy of the prophets and early sages to its original state prior to exile.The challenge for the pietists was not merely to reconstruct the prophetictradition from the biblical record but to reclaim it as an integral part of theJewish heritage. As Abraham and a number of his fellow pietists acknow-ledged, the traditions of the prophets were not altogether lost. Parts of theprophetic path were faithfully preserved, albeit in fragmentary form, in themystical rites of Islamic Sufism, whose adherents allegedly modeled theirmovement on accounts of the ancient prophets that circulated in theirtime.5By asserting the Jewish origin of the cardinal rites of Sufimysticism,the pietists sought to naturalize and integrate key elements of the Sufitraditionin their quest to revive the legacy of biblical prophecy.6But unlike therestoration of prostration and other devotional postures, to which Abrahamascribed a Jewish origin while rejecting the very possibility of Islamic influ-ence, Abraham considered the Sufis a valuable resource in his own effort toreconstruct the prophetic tradition.7His lament at the Sufiappropriation of4The pietists were not thefirst to attribute the loss of divine revelation to the conditions ofexile. The view of the ultimate restoration of prophecy was commonly accepted among medievalJewish thinkers. See the discussion in the previous chapter.5In addition tofirst-hand observation of Sufirites, attested somewhat enigmatically byAbraham himself, Egyptian pietists had direct access to a wide array of classical Sufitexts, notonly in the original but, in some cases, as noted in Chapter 1, transcribed into Hebrew charactersand preserved in the Genizah.6On the assertion of original wisdom in medieval Jewish thought, see A. Melamed,The Mythof the Jewish Origins of Science and Philosophy(Hebrew) (Haifa and Jerusalem: University ofHaifa Press, Magnes Press, and Hebrew University Press, 2010), esp. 94–157, although the bookdoes not cover Abraham Maimonides and the Egyptian pietists.7See, e.g.,HW, II:266, ll. 4–10.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi220Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"the prophetic path is as much a powerful rebuke of his coreligionists for theirwillful neglect of their own heritage.We witness the Sufis of Islam practicing spiritual discipline in restricting theirsleep, which they perhaps derive from the sayings of David,“I will give no sleep tomy eyes or slumber to my eyelids”(Ps. 132:4), and“I arise at midnight to givethanks to You”(Ps. 119:62), and others like them. It may also be discerned fromthe report of the messenger, of blessed memory,8regarding his seclusion in themountain with the divine presence:“I lay prostrate before the Lord for thoseforty days and forty nights”(Deut. 9:25), indicating that he was in the same stateboth day and night, without sleeping or eating...Take note of these marveloustraditions and grieve at how they were transmitted from us (nuqilat‘annā)toanother religion and have [all but] disappeared from among us!

BT Ḥagigah 5b).9For each rite practiced among the Sufis, Abraham adduced a correspondingexemplum of the prophets attesting to its antiquity in the Jewish community.10The related disciplines of nightly vigils and meditative retreats, which as weknow were incorporated into pietist practice, were accorded a measure oflegitimacy by being anchored in biblical models. That the“SufisofIslam”represented the living link to these ancient rites is openly acknowledged, butis the occasion for a two-pronged polemic. The entire Sufimovement, thoughadmirable in itself, is portrayed as a mere subsidiary and faint echo of its biblicalpredecessor. But the primary target of his polemic was not Sufism but the Jewishfaithful, who permitted their prophetic legacy to be appropriated by Islam withlittle regret. The task facing the pietist leaders was thus deeply paradoxical. Theyappealed to Jewish pride by exposing the Sufiimitation of the prophetictradition, while openly turning to the latter as a spiritual model requiringemulation. In this fashion, Egyptian pietism hoped to reclaim the mantel ofthe prophets from their illegitimate heirs within Islam. Paradoxically, therenewal of Jewish life and the restoration of its spiritual legacy were onlyconceivable through a deep engagement with the living model of Islamic piety.118The term“messenger,”ubiquitous in the Islamic tradition, is common in medieval Judaeo-Arabic literature.

In itsown way, the messianism of Egyptian pietism, while not focused on a charis-matic individual or overarching messianic doctrine, must be regarded as moreactive than passive in nature.12The emphasis on religious reform and pietistrevival, including the renewal of the ancient prophetic tradition, were con-ceived of by Abraham Maimonides and his circle as an integral part of thetermination of the exile and the dawn of the anticipated redemption. As weshall see, the prophetic thrust of Egyptian pietism was built on clear Maimo-nidean foundations, even as it transformed them thoroughly in the process.Whereas Maimonides wrote of thereturnof prophecy on the eve of themessianic age, his son sought to promote therestorationof prophecy as aharbinger of the redemption. The fact that Maimonides preserved a familytradition on the imminent return of prophecy and even conceded that theprophetic claims of one of his contemporaries, Moses Dar‘ī, may be a sign ofthe return of prophecy in his own day, was no doubt highly significant toAbraham’s generation. Yet, while these views certainly contributed to a newwave of messianic and prophetic consciousness in the thirteenth century, theyare not in and of themselves sufficient to explain the decisive direction thepietists would ultimately take. The pietist revival was predicated not merely onthe renewal of propheticexperiencebut on the restoration of the prophetictraditionas a whole, the interruption of which (like the exile itself), was nomore than a temporary aberration. Before turning to the messianic underpin-nings of Egyptian pietism, we must then assess its conception of the prophetictradition that served as the vital link between the imagined past and theidealized future.THE PROPHETIC TRADITIONI. Disciples of the ProphetsCrucial to the pietist revival was the need to establish a direct link between itsown activities and the tradition of ancient Israel, enshrined in scriptural andrabbinic lore. This was accomplished in two mutually reinforcing ways. Thefirst was the development of a highly nuanced hermeneutical tradition in12On the difference between active and passive messianism in the Jewish tradition andMaimonidean thought and their connection with more recent developments, seeA. Funkenstein,Maimonides: Nature, History and Messianic Beliefs, tr. S.

Closely connected with this was the retelling of archetypal stories of theancients as a spiritual drama exemplifying the quest for prophetic attainment.The second was the identification of the adherents of the pietist path with aclass of people aspiring to prophecy in ancient Israel, known in one biblicalsource as“the disciples of the prophets”(bene ha-nevi’im).13This expression,used only minimally by the sages, had already developed an interesting historybefore its adoption by the pietists. Both Baḥya ibn Paquda and Judah ha-Leviassociated this group with a particular spiritual tendency toward increasedasceticism that could in principle manifest itself in any generation.14Forneither author, however, was there an immediate application of the class tocontemporary aspirants or a sustained appeal to a particular mode of piety.An important turning point in the history of the expression comes inMaimonides’discussion of prophecy both in theGuideand the code. Hisuse of the concept of prophetic disciples was closely linked to his view ofprophecy as the natural culmination of“moral and intellectual perfection.”Unless otherwise prevented on account of the divine will, Maimonides assert-ed that“the natural occurrence is that one who has perfected his dispositionand disciplined himself with cultivation and training will prophesy.”15In thecode, Maimonides identified the training for prophetic attainment as a par-ticular mode of intellectual concentration achieved in solitary meditation.16Inboth sources, the group associated with this form of prophetic training isidentified with the disciples of the prophets. Significantly, Maimonides did notrefer to this group as a historical phenomenon but as a general designation foranyone pursuing divine revelation. He described them as individuals who“areconstantly absorbed in preparation,”17and who“follow the path of prophecyuntil they prophesy.”18With his consistent discussion of the path leading13For this expression, see esp.

Onoccasion, pietist writers described the inner illumination resulting from theirspiritual exercises, a revelation of divine mysteries that some in the movementbelieved constituted a renewal of prophecy in their day. The pursuit of innerillumination was conceived of,first and foremost, as the revival of the prophetictradition and of the ideal represented by the ancient disciples of the prophets.The latter were frequently invoked as a model and inspiration for contempor-ary seekers. The pietist and traditionalist, Daniel ibn al-Māshiṭah, with whomAbraham found himself at odds, described the practices of“the pietists andstudents of the prophets,”such as solitary retreats in pursuit of inner illumin-ation (istinār), as a familiar sight to any observer.19Abraham, in turn, enjoinedhis fellow pietists to pursue the same preparatory paths as the disciples of theprophets of old, as if to make themselves disciples of the disciples.20While singling out the spiritual elect, who strive to walk in the footsteps ofthe prophets and their disciples, Abraham was careful to emphasize that sucha path must coincide with a dedication to the law in all its aspects. In hisfinalchapter of theCompendium, devoted to prophetic illumination which is theculmination of the path, Abraham made this point abundantly clear:“Anyonewho strives to attain the end that is the object of [his path] (al-wuṣūlal-maqṣūd), must necessarily occupy oneself with the study and practice ofthe commandments—the occupation of the pietists and men of stature—andthe knowledge of the purposes of the commandments (ma‘rifat ghāyātal-miṣvot) and the inner purposes of the law and afirm grasp of its principlesand applications, for this is the elevated path traversed by the disciples of theprophets and those who are like them”(al-maslak al-rafī‘alladhīsalakahubene ha-nevi’im wa-naḥwahum).21The same theme with which he ended hisMaimonides’notion of the relationship between the source of the divine overflow and itsrecipient. The active intellect is described as constantly overflowing in relation to that whichhas prepared itself to receive it (fi‘luhu dā’im kullamātahayya’a shai’qabila dhalik al-fi‘l). It isprecisely in this sense that God is said to cause his knowledge to overflow to the prophets (afāḍa‘ilmahu‘alāal-anbiyā’). SeeGuide, II:12, ed. Qafiḥ, 303.19See II Firk.

It is likely that the repeated emphasis on practical obser-vance was a reaction to the antinomian element within the nascent pietistmovement, which sought the prophetic path outside of the normativestructure of the law.22Abraham sounded a note of caution to all whoaspired to follow the lofty example of the prophets and their disciples, bothancient and modern.You who seek to ascend to the level of the elite and to walk in God’s elevatedpaths, the way of the pious of Israel and the disciples of the prophets, who seek thepath of divine favor and succor, so as to reach the object of your quest, as [thesages] said,“He who seeks purification is assisted”(cf.

Only then shall you pursue the special path.23While underscoring their direct link with the prophetic tradition, the desig-nation of the pietists as disciples or followers of the prophets served theadditional purpose of avoiding the pitfall—or accusation—of spiritual hubris.By adopting the label of discipleship, they effectively assumed the mantle ofthe prophets and saints without overtly identifying themselves as such. Even apious seeker, a mere“beginner in [the course of] training,”may therefore beincluded as one of“the followers of the prophets and saints,”and may emulatetheir ways in order to achieve a state of divine illumination.24In the absence ofrecognized prophets in their own day, the pietists relied on allusions to modesof spiritual discipline recorded of the biblical prophets and rabbinic sages andeven the living example of modern-day saints, and proposed to make them-selves disciples of the latter.25But even at such a remove from the tradition ofthe ancients, the pietists designated their own saints as modern-day disciples,“wayfarers on the divine path and followers of the prophets.”26The cultivation of spiritual discipleship quickly became a centerpiece of thepietist movement and was crucial to their broader aspirations.

At its core was the desire to restore the ancient model as a livinginstitution and perpetuate it in the community. Such a goal presumed that thedisciples of today were to become the spiritual mentors of the next generation.While the path itself was fundamentally a private one, cultivated in momentsof solitude and often in the dark of night, it was concentrated aroundfellowship circles under a recognized master, an institution known to Sufisand pietists alike by the termṣuḥbah.27The practice of spiritual discipleshipwas envisioned as a re-enactment of the ancient institution cultivated, then asnow, for the sake of prophetic attainment, a state designated by Abraham asarrival (wuṣūl).28A spiritual seeker, described as a wayfarer on the path, mustfirst become a disciple and attach themselves to“one who has arrived”(wāṣil),on the model of the disciples of the prophets, who attached themselves to theprophets for instruction.Whoever travels the path without a guide will experience difficulties and encoun-ter obstacles in his quest for attainment. Such a person will ultimately deviatefrom the path or else come to believe that he has reached attainment when he hasnot, as occurs with many false prophets. But with the guidance of a master whohas reached attainment, a seeker who is worthy and is a good disciple will reachattainment.29Abraham’s account, as in so many cases, shifts seamlessly between theprophets, their disciples, and the contemporary seeker. The fusion of ancientJewish models with current practice was as natural as it was necessary. Thesystem of prophetic discipleship, the initial inspiration for the very notion of aprophetic tradition, became the mechanism of its own restoration. From theoutset, pietist disciples turned not only to scriptural models but cultivatedliving mentors who had already undergone a process of inner training and had“emerged unscathed from its dangers and reached its ultimate attainment.”30The master determined the particular course of spiritual training appropriatefor each disciple in accordance with his temperament and capacity.The emulation of the ancient prophets thus took on two dimensions. Thepractical regimen of ascetic withdrawal and solitary devotion was conceived asthe spiritual successor to what Maimonides and Abraham each designated“the path [leading to] prophecy.”31But equally important to the movementwas the restoration of the very model of discipleship established to perpetuate27On the role of the pietist fellowship, see Chapters one and two, especially p. 94 and n. 23.28On this key term, see my discussion of prophecy and human perfection in Chapterfive.29HW, II:422, ll. 16–21.30SeeHW, 326, ll. 10–11.31See MT,“Laws of the Foundations of the Torah,”7:4 (derekh ha-nevu’ah), and cf. 7:6, andPerush, 325 (Ex. 20:17:maslak al-nubūwah).OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPi226Judaism, Sufism, and the Pietists of Medieval Egypt"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"the prophetic tradition for future generations. The“arrival”described byAbraham and his colleagues was conceived as a form of mystical illumination,a state which pietist devotees could only hope to reach after extensive trainingunder the direction of“one who has arrived.”While not explicitly equatingarrival, or attainment, with biblical prophecy, Abraham drew attention to thefact that the corruption of this exalted state—by those who set out upon thehazardous path alone, without the aid of an experienced guide—is nothingshort of the false prophecy of which the Bible repeatedly cautioned.32II. The Sinaitic TraditionThe central drama at the heart of the medieval Jewish speculation on prophecywas the scriptural account of the theophany at Sinai. As prophecy wasincreasingly interpreted not only as a divine utterance but as a mark ofintellectual and spiritual perfection, interest in the Sinaitic narrative shiftedfrom the theological event itself toward the collective experience and propheticvision of the people.33But what served as philosophical fodder for earlierthinkers was of far more than theoretical interest to the pietists. There is anawareness of the theological conundrum of divine speech or the spectacle of avisible theophany, but the overriding concern was practical in nature.34Thequestion was not so much what transpired at Sinai but what lessons of innerpreparation leading to prophetic attainment may be drawn from the experi-ence of the people at the mountain. The hermeneutical key to the pietistreading of scripture is the inner drama of the spiritual quest, reflected asmuch in the collective experience of the Israelites in the wilderness as in thestories of individual prophets. Thefirst task of the interpreter was to recognizethe signs and stages of the inner life within the outer contours of scripture.In the hands of pietist interpreters, the wandering tribes came to represent afellowship of disciples, each at a different point along the path and, as a result,capable of a different reception of the divine overflow. Taking their cue asmuch from Maimonides as from talmudic and midrashic tradition, the pietistsmaintained a spiritual hierarchy among the Israelites that allowed for multiple32See Deut. 13: 2–6 and 18:20–2; Jer. esp. 14:14–18, 23:15–40, 27:9–18, 21, and 29:8–9. Seealso MT,“Laws of the Foundations of the Torah,”9:2–3, and 10:1–2.33This was especially the case with ha-Levi and Maimonides. See D.

The term served adouble purpose by casting the image of the people standing at the mountain interms of the private state of inner illumination and meaning, quite literally,standing before God.39The heightened interest in the revelation at Sinai took on new urgency inpietist spirituality. More than a model of mystical experience, Sinai was theparadigmatic moment of the divine directive to the people as a whole.According to ibn Abi’l-Rabī‘, whose teaching and writing were crucial to theearly development of the movement, the Sinaitic injunctions came in two35SeePerush, 309 (Ex. 19:16):“‘All the people trembled’: in the state of all who prophe-cy...for they all strove to become prophets”(li-an kulluhum tanabba’ū).

On the different ranks of prophecy in general, seePerush, 177 (Gen. 46:1), 195(Gen. 49:1), 247 (Ex. 7:1), and cf.Guide, II:45. See also P. Fenton,“Mystical Treatise onPerfection, Providence and Prophecy from the Jewish SufiCircle,”inThe Jews of MedievalIslam: Community, Society, and Identity, ed. D. Frank (Leiden: Brill, 1992), 329, 330–1.A different approach was taken by Daniel ibn al-Māshiṭah, who maintained that the peopledid not exhibit any facilities of prophetic illumination and relied exclusively on the intermediacyof Moses. See II Firk. I.3132, 55a–b.36SeeHW, II:390, l. 20 to 392, l. 4.37SeeHW, II:326, ll. 11–17.38SeePerush, 463 (Ex. 33:6). As their guide on the prophetic path, Moses continued to pray,even after the sin of the golden calf, that the people attain the rank of prophets. SeePerush, 455(Ex. 32:4). On his subsequent prayer that they all attain prophecy, seePerush, 477–9 (Ex. 34:9).39For the use ofmaqām(lit.“standing”) as a substitute for the Hebrew phrasema‘amad harsinai(lit.“standing at Sinai”), see the commentary of ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘to the Song of Songs, TSAr. 43.108, 1b, ll. 8–9, published by P.

Thefirst was reflected in the outer system of law that remained thebedrock of the religious community. The second, also directed at the people asa whole, was the mandate to preserve and transmit the form of divinerevelation modeled by the collective experience at the mountain. Each gener-ation was expected to pass on not only the written record but also the oraltradition of this collective experience as a spiritual heritage alongside the outerstructure of the law. The Sinaitic revelation thus provided not only a historicalmodel, but a framework of obligation in order to perpetuate the prophetictradition. For the pietists, the scriptural witness—along with vestiges of theprophetic path preserved by the Sufis—was all that remained to reconstructthe people’s prophetic beginnings. Yet scripture continued to call anew to eachgeneration to reassert its spiritual patrimony. In an oblique rebuke to hiscoreligionists for having abandoned this heritage, Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘spoke of the double injunction originating at Sinai.Proximity to Him, may He be exalted, consists of many levels, the highest ofwhich is the proximity of revelation (tajallī), the state of unveiling, and ofwitnessing, with its delights and divine gifts to whomever he singles out for it.The standing at Sinai was Israel’s state of unveiling and thefirst of its sta-tes...“For what nation [is so great] as to have its God so near...and whatnation is so great as to have such righteous statutes and laws...”(Deut. 4:7–8)?40Thefirst meaning grasped by spiritual intuition is the proximity of revelation andthe unveiling of outer and inner visions and illumination.41The second [verserefers] to the giving of the statutes and laws...Preserve both of these nobledoctrines and practice them, thefirst of which is the state of unveiling andrevelation through...preparation and sanctification, the path of divine attain-ment which I have explained to you for your benefit and the purifications whichI have entrusted to you, by which you may ascend to that state.42So bequeath andteach them to your descendants so that they will be an inheritance that will neverbe severed, such that your descendants will transmit the wayfaring path (ṭarīqal-sulūk) received from their ancestors...43In the prophetic doctrine of Abraham ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘, divine revelation wasnot merely the mechanism for giving the law but the culmination of a path ofpreparation and sanctification.According to his interpretation of the days of separation leading up to therevelation, the people prepared themselves for the experience with an extensive40The words“is so great”are part of the original, but were omitted in Abraham the Pious’citation.41The verb translated as“grasped by spiritual intuition”isyudhāq, based on the Suficoncept of spiritual taste, on which see e.g. p. 111, n. 111.42Here again ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘referred to“that state”(dhalik al-maqām), alluding to the stateof unveilingfirst experienced by the people at Sinai.43TS Ar. 43.108, 1b, ll. 4–9; 2a, ll. 10–15; 3a, ll. 11–15, 17; 3b, ll. 1–4; published by Fenton,“Some Judaeo-Arabic Fragments,”61–2.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiFrom Prophecy to Redemption229"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"process of solitary meditation and a gradual withdrawal from all food andwater.“The entire holy congregation, according to their various levels [ofattainment]...were isolated unto Him, may He be exalted, during that periodof solitude which they experienced at the holy mountain, until they reachedthe perfection of proximity and worship which they sought...”44In aremarkable rereading of the biblical narrative, ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘imagined an entirecommunity isolated in individual cells or otherwise withdrawn in meditation forthe sake of prophetic illumination. Even when experienced as a community, theform and result of what he called the“state of unveiling”(al-maqāmal-kashfī)remained utterly private in nature. But the prophetic path, while undertaken byindividuals within the community, was to be transmitted to the people as theultimate aspiration of Torah, as it once had been at the foot of the mountain. Ashe put it elsewhere, the mystical knowledge imparted from divine illuminationis“the most perfect of all forms of knowledge and is the prophetic knowledgewhich was intended for Israel.”45The exegetical position adopted by ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘on the Sinaitic revelationwas amplified by Abraham Maimonides in his own commentary. There again,wefind the theme of communal sanctification achieved through a form ofouter and inner solitude. The people strove for a state of inner sanctification,described as a purification and a focusing of the mind in anticipation of whathe, like his colleague, called prophetic perfection. The path to prophecy islikewise achieved through the practice of inner solitude even in the midst ofthe entire congregation. So it was at Sinai, and so it was ordained for futuregenerations. In his interpretation of the enigmatic words of Moses followingthe Decalogue that“God came but to test you”(Ex. 20:17),46Abrahamcommented that the divine test could either refer to an actual trial or to themeans by which the people were“tested,”or readied, for prophecy.“If themeaning is a training, then the intention is to train you in the path of prophecy(maslak al-nubūwah) and its means [of attainment], in order for those of your44This interpretation of ibn Abī’l-Rabī‘was preserved in its entirety by Abraham Maimonidesin his own commentary on Exodus.

As GeraldBlidstein has observed, Maimonides, too, appears to have viewed a prophetic chain of traditionas part and parcel of the inheritance of Torah received at Sinai. See G. Blidstein,“The Institu-tionalization of Prophecy in the Legal Teaching of Maimonides”(Hebrew), inMaimonides inDa‘at: A Collection of Maimonidean Studies(Hebrew and English) (Ramat Gan: University ofBar Ilan Press, 2004), 95:“It follows that the wisdom of the Torah and the prophetic attainmentwere given at one and the same time to Israel, and both traditions stem from the fact that Mosespassed it on to Joshua.”46The biblical narrative puts the reaction of the people after the Decalogue. According torabbinic interpretation, the congregation witnessed thefirst two commandments directly andthen asked Moses to serve as prophetic intermediary on their behalf.

It was, in the handsof the pietists, a living model for future generations of seekers, wayfarers onthe path of prophetic attainment, to claim as their own. Remarkably, thepietists did not consider the original Sinaitic theophany itself, which producedthe holy scriptures—not to be annulled or (in the language of Muslim-Jewishpolemics) abrogated for all time48—a sufficient reason why the event wasrecorded in so much detail in the Bible. Alongside the actual content of theSinaitic revelation was the imperative to transmit the experience that pro-duced it among the people (apart from what was experienced by Moses), in theexpectation that it would lead to new revelations among their descendants anddisciples, from one generation to the next in an unbroken chain of prophetictradition.49After generations of neglect in the long exile, it was now the dutyof those seekers of the present generation to reconstruct and restore the sacredinheritance to its rightful place within the prophetic community. By the veryact of restoring exilic Judaism to its ancient luster by undoing generations ofneglect, the pietists imagined themselves to be the vanguard that wouldwitness an end to the exile as they knew it and help usher in the long-awaitedredemption.FROM PROPHECY TO REDEMPTIONThe revival of the original spiritual mission of Israel was, according to anumber of pietist sources from the period, a vital step in the unfolding ofthefinal messianic redemption. The physical and spiritual depravity of Israelin exile, it was believed, constituted the primary impediment of the people inits realization of its historical destiny. The ascent of the nation of Ishmael overits ancient rival, a reversal of the divine blessing from its rightful heir, was asource of lament and a sign of the exile. The ultimate redemption of Israel was47Perush, 325 (Ex. 20:17).48On the polemic over abrogation (naskh), see H.

What gave this messianism a sense of urgencywas the belief that the restoration was at hand if the community were toundertake sincere repentance. The communal enactments that came to defineAbraham’s career should be viewed in part as laying the foundation for thespiritual transformation that would usher in the messianic era. The communalreform took two directions, thefirst aimed at the restoration of prophecyamong“the remnant whom the Lord calls”and the other at a completerenewal of religious life among the people at large. While the prophetic revivalof the pietists was viewed as a harbinger of the future redemption and could, itwas hoped, stimulate greater piety in the broader community, it could nothasten the messianic era alone.Behind the heightened expectation of redemption in the early thirteenthcentury was a series of pronouncements by Maimonides to the effect that theNote also Samau’al al-Maghribī’s mockery of Jewish messianic longings in M.

Cohen,“Soteriology”(part II), 52,n. 148.54The suggestion that the messianism of the pietists had“an overtly political goal since itwould mean an end to Islamic rule and the beginning of a new Jewish state”was made by NateHofer in his recent dissertation, on thirteenth-century“Sufism, State, and Society in Ayyubid andEarly Mamluk Egypt, 1173–1309,”Dissertation, Emory University, 2011, 20–21. Hofer, more-over, argued that Egyptian pietism should be understood as a form of“subaltern Sufism,”in sofar as it reflects the desire of a group outside the current religio-political hegemonic structure toassert itself and upend that very structure. Hofer suggested that the Jewish adoption of Sufiinstitutional models was“for a revolutionary end,”including“the liberation of the people ofIsrael from foreign rule,”and that Egyptian pietism was therefore motivated by a desire“to createan organized messianic movement”that would signal the beginning of Jewish political domin-ation over Islam. In light of this approach, Hofer argued that“[Abraham Maimonides’] over-arching project was to organize the [pietist] movement into a more unified collectivity for thepurpose of political emancipation.”Hofer views the political aspirations of pietist messianism asnot limited to the land of Israel, or even Egypt, but global in scope:“The Pietists were careful anddeliberate thinkers and writers who attempted to create what they saw as a better world in whichJews would be politically sovereign.”See Hofer,“Sufism, State, and Society,”220, 222, 225,respectively. Given that such a global, or even a local, political messianic movement is nowherealluded to in the pietist sources, Hofer suggests that it should be understood as“the‘hiddentranscript’of theKifāyaand the Pietist movement as a whole,”alluding to the postcolonialtheory of subaltern political aspirations functioning as“hidden transcripts,”or critiques of thecurrent power structure. See Hofer,“Sufism, State, and Society,”277, and cf. 224, n. 25. As I arguelater in this chapter, Abraham Maimonides did envision a reversal of the spiritual and temporalhierarchy between the children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael, but this messianic vision ofthe end of the Jewish exile ought not to be exaggerated so as to attribute a revolutionary andpolitical dimension to the pietist movement. If Abraham Maimonides and other pietistsimagined a reversal of fortunes in the spiritual destiny of Israel, this should not be misconstruedas a struggle for political emancipation in Egypt or any other land under Islamic rule.OUP CORRECTED PROOF–FINAL, 25/6/2015, SPiFrom Prophecy to Redemption233"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Jewish people were on the eve of the messianic era and were perhaps evenliving in its early stages.

Isaac Migash, MosesDar‘ī, who upon settling in Fez began to preach of the imminent advent of themessiah. He then announced certain predictions of symbolic portents whichtranspired as he foretold. As Maimonides related, peopleflocked in largenumbers to Moses Dar‘īon account of his predictions and began referringto him as a prophet. At this point in his narration of the episode, Maimonidespaused to clarify the legitimacy of such a claim.“This,”he acknowledged,“isnot impossible from the standpoint of the Torah, according to what I haverelated to you concerning the return of prophecy before the advent of themessiah.”64The error of Moses Dar‘ī’s augurs, according to Maimonides, wasnot the claim to prophecy, which he acknowledged may be truthful, but hismistaken prediction of the imminent arrival of the messiah, with fatefulconsequences for his followers.65According to the family tradition related by Maimonides in the epistle,while nofixed date may be given to the redemption proper, one may cau-tiously determine the date for the restoration of prophecy, a sign and harbingerhimself in his Epistle on Persecution.

It is striking, however, that Maimonides mentions thisepisode as an example of the possible revival of prophecy in this age after having earlier given adate for the renewal of prophecy for almost a century after Moses Dar‘ī’s time.65After Dar‘ī’s messianic augurs did not materialize, he was forced toflee al-Andalus toCrusader-held Palestine. Maimonides continued to marvel at his true predictions—or proph-ecies, as he called them—until his death in Palestine. SeeEpistle to Yemen, ed. Halkin, 102 (qadwa‘ada...bi-kull māṭariya fībilād al-maghrab ṣaghīrah wa-kabīrah), indicating that, for all ofthe error and danger of the Dar‘īaffair, he continued to maintain that his prophecies were trueand perhaps were a harbinger of the return of prophecy.

From this tradition and his statement regarding thepossible prophecy of Moses Dar‘ī, Maimonides most likely believed that hewas living in the period of prophetic renewal and the dawn of messianictimes.66The revelation of such an important family tradition on the returnof prophecy, publicized and proudly affirmed by Maimonides in the epistle,puts the prophetic movement cultivated by his son’s generation in starkerperspective. We have seen the deep imprint of Maimonidean thoughtthroughout the warp and woof of pietist spirituality. The extraordinary revivalof the prophetic tradition in the early thirteenth century, with pietists identi-fying their quest with that of the prophets and their disciples of old, can onlybe seen as the realization—and institutionalization—of the prophetic renewalpredicted by Maimonides.67In light of this background, it is all the more significant that Abraham andhis colleagues invested so much writing on the attainment of prophecy andthe holy spirit and so little on the ostensibly more pressing question of themessianic era itself. In Abraham’s writings, thefinal redemption was thesubject of pious prayer and abiding faith in the divine promise, but withoutthe faintest allusion to the anticipated end.68From Maimonides’remarks inthe epistle to Yemen and other writings, there were two main reasons for thisreticence. Thefirst and most pressing was the danger of raising false hopesamong the people,“which lead masses of people astray andfills them withdelusions when the foretold time arrives and [the messiah] has not come.”69From this perspective, sages and leaders bear a special responsibility not to fanvain hopes or encourage speculations that could lead to desperation in thecommunity. The second explanation for the general reticence on the messianicarrival was the belief that the moment was determined not byfixed calcula-tions but according to the state of the people. Only a return to the foundationsof religion and sincere repentance could hasten the arrival.66See the contrasting views of Hartman inCrisis and Leadership, 190–3, and Friedman,Maimonides, 59, n. 48, and on Friedman’s review of other skeptical readings of Maimonides’family tradition, Friedman,Maimonides,52–63. It is interesting to note in this context thatMaimonides identified the anticipated messiah not merely as the culmination of propheticrevival, but its very embodiment. The messiah, in his view, would himself befilled with theholy spirit (ruaḥha-qodesh). See MT,“Laws of Kings,”12:3.67According to an early study by Gerson Cohen, it is“almost unthinkable”that AbrahamMaimonides should not have been privy to this most important of family traditions.

Most of the questions dealt with various legal controversiesdividing the Yemenite scholars into two opposing camps, one in favor ofreligious reform and the other defending local custom, for which they soughtAbraham’s adjudication.72But the last of the thirteen questions sent toAbraham was not legal at all but turned to the theme of the messianic eraand its estimated time. The Yemenite scholars asked Abraham for any furtherinformation on the messianic arrival and to elaborate on the tradition receivedfrom his father. Abraham’s brief but pointed response reflects his deepreluctance to encourage messianic speculations.With regard to the report of the end time transmitted by my father and teacher,may the memory of the righteous be a blessing, my answer on this matter is thathe already related whatever [information] he possessed in his epistle to Yemen,which you have. In his epistle, he said all that needs to be said on this matter.I myself will not transmit anything concerning this subject other than what theTorah states, namely that the [redemption] is contingent upon repentance, as it issaid,“When you return unto the Lord your God,”etc.,“then the Lord your Godshall return your captivity,”etc. (Deut. 30:2–3).

Heschel once speculated that the French émigrés in the early thirteenthcentury traveled to Palestine in anticipation of the messianic redemption on the authority of thistradition. He further suggested that they traveled via Egypt in order to greet Abraham andinquire into further details of this messianic prediction. See A. J.

Thefirst is that, while Maimonides viewed prophecyas a harbinger of the redemption, his tradition said nothing whatsoever ofthe actual arrival of the messiah.74From Abraham’s response, it is evidentthat the original question of the Yemenite scholars was concerned notwith the return of prophecy per se but with the precise calculation of“theend time”(al-qeṣ).75All other dates and calculations from the medievalperiodfixed the“end time”with the arrival of the messiah, and there was noreason to expect the Maimonidean tradition to be any different.76ButAbraham maintained that the absence of any precise date in the epistle,other than that signaling the onset of a new era of prophecy, was notaccidental. No further information was given, he declared, because nothingfurther may be known other than the necessary preconditions for redemp-tion recorded in scripture.But behind his disavowal of any additional information concerning theMaimonidean tradition, Abraham suggested that he simply would not trans-mit anything further on the matter. The language and terseness of his replysuggest a considerable discomfort with the subject altogether. His abruptrefusal to expatiate on the subject, beyond a mere allusion to the biblicalpromise, is particularly unexpected in a letter to the very community that hadturned to his father for solace in the midst of persecution and that had fallenprey, only one generation earlier, to false messianic augurs. The brusque toneof his response strongly suggests that he sought to discourage any furtherspeculation on the matter. But Abraham’s caution should not be taken as asign of indifference. As it happens, the Maimonidean tradition of the end ofdays surfaces somewhat enigmatically in a Genizah fragment of an otherwisemissing chapter from theCompendium. As he did on more than one occasion,Abraham lamented the decline of religious knowledge and practice in hisgeneration. Alluding to a rabbinic prediction of a time—not unlike his own—when the religious law would fall into desuetude, he consoled his readers that asimilar prediction of great antiquity has been preserved concerning the time of74Maimonides did refer to the return of prophecy as coinciding with the“end time,”in so faras the messiah was to come on the heels of its return.

BT Shabbat 138b).77As Maimonides reminded the Yemenite Jews in his epistle, the familytradition on the return of prophecy was“the most accurate [tradition] of theend time that has come down to us.”The authenticity of the tradition was due,in large part, to the fact that it originated not in the fanciful calculations of asingle individual but was a continuous tradition from the original exiles ofJerusalem, preserved and transmitted faithfully from one generation to thenext among Iberian Jews:“I am in the possession of an extraordinary tradition,which I have received from my father and grandfather...from the beginningof our exile from Jerusalem in Sefarad, as the prophet testified by calling it“theexile of Jerusalem that is in Sefarad.”78Abraham’s reference to the tradition of“the sages of the west”(‘ulamā’al-maghreb)regardingtheadventofthefinalrestoration at the end of days is without a doubt an allusion to the Iberiantradition related by his father.79But, as in his response to the Yemenite scholars,Abraham let the matter go without further elaboration or clarification.From his suggestive remarks in theCompendium, there is every reason tobelieve that Abraham accepted the veracity of the Iberian-Maimonideantradition and imagined himself, like his father before him, to be living at thedawn of messianic times. What prevented the fulfillment of the expected hourwas the diminished state of religious knowledge and practice in the presentgeneration. Like many others in the medieval period, Abraham reconciled thebelief in a preordained time with the tradition that only a virtuous generationwill be worthy of redemption.80As he hinted in his responsum, the moment ofredemption will continue to be postponed until a large-scale repentance andrestoration of religious life is undertaken by the people. According to hisinterpretation of the scriptural prophesies concerning the generation of the77See Bodl. MS Heb. d. 23, 9v, blurred in many places.

According to the Yemenite Jewish theologian, Netanel ibn al-Fayyūmī, the father of therecipient of Maimonides’epistle, a lack of repentance could postpone the set time for redemp-tion:“Far be it from the omnipotent Creator, praised be His name and exalted His glory, to fulfillHis threat (wa‘idahu) and to abandon His promise (wa‘dahu).

The promise ofredemption required a profound challenge to the status quo. Prayer becamethe sole means of achieving a form of atonement and of total return to God. Itwas,first and foremost, intended as a path of return to the ancient worship ofIsrael in its purest form. But how were the people expected tofind their wayback from the corrupting ways and stunted mentality of the exile in order torecapture—perhaps even to reconstruct—their original heritage?The answer to this enigma was among the most extraordinary propositionsof the Egyptian pietist movement. According to Abraham and his colleagues,the Jewish community, though heirs of the prophets and bearers of the divinerevelation, could not undertake such a monumental task in a spiritual vacuum.As with the restoration of the prophetic path, which was modeled in large parton the living example of Sufism, the road to Jewish origins was expected topass through the matrix of Islam. Even more than his father, Abrahamexpressed a deep admiration for the faith and piety of the religion of Ishmael.92As he lamented the corrupt faith of his brethren in Christian Europe,Abraham proudly pointed to the purity of monotheistic belief among theJews of the Islamic world. Yet in other respects, Abraham observed, Islammaintained ancient Jewish rites long after they had been abandoned by thereligion of Israel. The Jewish community, though believed to be the originalSee Blau,Dictionary, 493. It is interesting to note that, among Jews of the classical Genizahperiod, the Arabic kunyah, Abū’l-Faraj, was typically given to men with the Hebrew nameYeshu‘ah. See S. M.

We are fortunate to possess a citation froma missing portion of Abraham’sCompendiumthat puts the paradoxicalrelationship of Judaism and Islam, and the challenge of the moment, in fullrelief.Our honored and saintly Rabbi Abraham has explained in theCompendiumthat[part of the law] has been transferred (muntaqil) to the nations among whomthey reside, and [thus] it has become established within Israel from [the influenceof] the nations (waqa‘afīyisrael min al-goyim). [Divine] wisdom [has ordained]that [the law] will [initially] disappear from among them while they reside [inexile],93until they repent and turn in repentance unto God, on account of whichthey will be delivered [from exile]. Thus the nations will become the instrumentfor the rebirth of [Israel] and of the restoration of their dominion.94According to another surviving fragment from the last chapter of hischefd’oeuvre, cited above, Abraham believed that the end of the Jewish exile wouldcoincide with a period in which the Torah would be forgotten by largesegments of the Jewish community.95As we know from similar statementselsewhere in the same work, Abraham believed that the ancient premonitionof the rabbis had come to fruition in his own generation. Plagued by theconditions of exile and by their own indifference, the people had lost touchwith the living tradition of ancient Israel. The community stood at thethreshold of redemption but searched in vain for the fulfillment of theirprayers. The only way out of their predicament, Abraham believed, was toinitiate a restoration of the most basic forms of divine worship. For this, theylooked not only inward at the original sources of the tradition, but alsooutward at the example of their Muslim neighbors and ancient rivals.In the most remarkable attestation of the intertwined destinies of the tworeligions, Abraham expressed the intricate role played by Islam in the rebirthand ultimate redemption of Israel. In the dual vision of exile and redemptionat the heart of Abraham’s pietist eschatology, the political order is a mirrorimage of the spiritual order. Ishmael’s blessing is a function of the fulfillmentof its spiritual mission on the world’s stage. By extension, it served as theprimary instrument for Israel’s return to its own pre-exilic mission. According93The object of this statement appears to be Israel itself. According to this reading, parts ofthe law (such as prostration and the like) will come to disappear among the Jews while takingroot among the“nations”—by which is intended the Muslim community.
