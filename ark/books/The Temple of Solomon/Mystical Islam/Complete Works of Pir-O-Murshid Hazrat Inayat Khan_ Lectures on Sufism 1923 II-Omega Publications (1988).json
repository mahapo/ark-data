Since the present volume and those to follow are to contain Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's lectures and other teachings, and are therefore of a different char- acter, it seems appropriate now to adjust the series' general title from Authentic Versions, more relevant to the Sayings, to Complete Works. The texts as presented are intended to answer such questions as: What happened to Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's words from the moment he spoke them until they were published for the first time? What alterations and changes of these words occurred, and by whom were they made? Background The possibility of preserving and passing on the teachings in the most authentic way was given by Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan himself when he cre- ated a depository, which he named 'The Biographical Department', under the supervision of his disciple and secretary Sakina ~urn6e. This Biographical Department has since continued to function on the same premises, 34, Rue de la Tuilerie, Suresnes, France. It is here that, in addition to biographical documentation as such, Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's words, taken down in shorthand and longhand, as well as those he wrote down himself (as was often the case with the sayings), were gathered, kept and listed. During her lifetime (she continued working in the Biographical Department until her death in 1973), Sakina created and endowed the Nekbakht Foundation in order to provide the Biographical Department with a legal framework and a permanent housing for its precious collection of Sufi documents and other items, and thus to ensure the continuation of its activities. What gives these valuable archives particular importance is Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's insis- tence, expressed on several occasions, that the wording of his oral teachings and extempore addresses be preserved exactly, and not modified for edito- rial purposes, as, for example: Do not change my words, form or phrase unless it is most necessary. Even so, most carefully avoid all changes which can be avoided. Otherwise you might lose the sense of my teaching.,. which is as essential to the Message as the per- fume in the rose. If the form in which I give my teaching seems to you not as correct as it ought to be from a literary point of view, do not mind, let it be my own language. There will come a time when there will be a search for my own"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"words. Just now if my words are not accepted as the current coin, they will always be valued as the antique. Sangita I, p. 32, Talim It has therefore long been the Biographical Department's aim to publish Pir- o-Murshid lnayat Khan's teachings in an original version, following as closely as possible the basic reportings or records of the words pronounced by him, in chronological order. Where changes had occurred in early versions of the texts, Sakina proposed that these be preserved and noted alongside. This objective is realized in this series by giving the oldest available version of Pir-o-Murshid's words as the basic text. Differences in other early versions are mentioned in notes at the bottom of each page in chrono- logical order (insofar as that can be determined from the available docu- ments). The lectures and other teachings contained in this volume were given during the second half of 1923 (2nd of July through 31st of December). Not all the words of Pir-o-Murshid found their way to the Biographical Depart- ment. Several lectures or other teachings are still missing. Insofar as title, date and place have become known, mainly from early newspaper articles on the lectures, these are mentioned in the Contents of this book. Each volume appearing in this series (Sayings Part 1 and 2 excepted) will bear as a subtitle an indication of the period during which the lectures contained in it were given. Reasons for Alterations and Changes In the relatively small amount of material written personally by Pir-o- Murshid lnayat Khan, we sometimes find a word crossed out and replaced with another which might be more acceptable to the listener or easier to grasp for the reader. On the same principle, in the transcripts of the lec- tures, here and there we find that Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan changes a word, or begins a phrase and then, part way through, decides to replace it with another. A second source of alteration arose from words missed or misunder- stood by the shorthand reporters, and particularly from longhand records, where gaps were filled with the help of memory or by interpretation. The third major source of alteration came from preparing material for reproduction and publication. These changes took place for any number of reasons, presumably to make the meaning somehow clearer to the reader by correcting the English, omitting repetitions, and so on."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"When Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan occasionally saw the alterations of his words, he seldom changed them back to his own words, even if the full meaning of the idea expressed by him was no longer conveyed. It should, however, not be taken for granted that this meant he found the alterations an improvement; he apparently accepted that his words should be filtered through the understanding of his hearers. Particulars about the Basic Text The lectures and other teachings are given in the oldest version as taken down in shorthand by Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's secretaries, Sakina FurnGe and Kismet Stam. If no such reporting of the original text is to be found, the version considered the oldest available is used instead. Differ- ences and uncertainties in other early versions as compared to the basic text are mentioned in the notes at the bottom of each page. The main part of the lectures and teachings given in the second half of 1923 was taken down in shorthand by Sakina. During the Summer School at Suresnes that same year, a second secretary, Kismet Stam, appointed by Pir- o-Murshid lnayat Khan, began to take part in the important task of report- ing his lectures as well. She used the shorthand system of ~imk Paris, while Sakina followed Pont's system. On the whole, Sakina's reportings were very complete and exact, and she had also had more practice than Kismet. As a rule, Sakina used Kismet's reportings to fill in her own when necessary before she made her transcription. It is this text which may be considered to render Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's words most faithfully. No copies of Sakina's original transcripts of her reportings, which she sent to the admin- istrative office of all Sufi activities, the International Headquarters of the Sufi Movement in Geneva, have been found in the archives. Sakina only kept her shorthand notebooks. Of a considerable part of these she made a new transcription some thirty years later, since she held it of the utmost impor- tance that, even after the publication of the books, the text of her short- hand reportings should remain available. However, not surprisingly it some- times happened after so many years that Sakina did not succeed in correctly reading her own shorthand again. For this reason, the present compiler has made an exact new transcription of all Sakina's shorthand reportings. This is presented here as the basic text, and the heading 'Sakina's shorthand re- porting transcribed by the compiler' is added above each lecture and/or teaching. Also, in those cases where this process could not be followed, the origin of the text is explained at the top of the page. Punctuation and paragraphing are not indicated in the shorthand. Differences in punctuation and in arranging paragraphs between the basic text and other early versions are mentioned in the notes only if thereby the meaning of a sentence is changed. In the cases where the original document is not a shorthand reporting but a longhand manuscript or typescript, the original spelling and paragraphing generally have been retained. In some"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"cases the punctuation has been changed where this does not change the meaning of the sentence. As far as possible, the sequence in which the lectures were given has been maintained. This obviously shows best the unfolding of the various ideas in Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's teaching. In. Appendix A to this book it can be seen what lectures on a certain subject have been put together and published in book form, and/or made into a series for private distribu- tion by International Headquarters. The original documents of a minority of the lectures make mention of the time of day the lecture was given. As in most cases no time is indicated, this detail has been omitted; the chronological order in which the lectures are presented renders it practically superfluous. During the Summer School of 1923, Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan often gave a lecture or address in the morning, then at 3:30 and 5:30. in the afternoon, and again sometimes in the evening as well. Questions and Answers When questions and answers followed a lecture, even if some of them refer to a previous lecture, they are placed in this book immediately after the lecture as given by Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan. If given on another occasion not immediately after the lecture, they are placed separately after the lecture to which they refer or seem to refer. In preparing new publica- tions from the original texts, a selection may have to be made from the questions and answers in order to include only those which, in the editor's opinion, refer to the lecture; there may be different points of view on this matter. The exact reporting of questions and answers often appears to have been more difficult than the reporting of the lectures. The questions from the audience were written down during or after the lecture and passed on to Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan, who read them aloud and answered them. Pre- sumably the questions were not always written very clearly. In any case, several omissions and uncertainties in Sakina's shorthand show that the re- porting of this part of Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's teaching was not an easy task. The questions do not, of course, represent the words of Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan; therefore, to make this evident, the questions have been printed in italics."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Publication of the Teachings Murshida Sherifa Coodenough had already been Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's secretary in London during the First World War. She also was author- ized by Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan to take down his words. The special task entrusted to her, however, was to prepare the lectures for publication in book form and to prepare other teachings for multiplication to be distributed among a limited number of mureeds (pupils initiated in the Sufi Order). As she had not learned any shorthand system, she used Sakina's and Kismet's reportings as the basis for the text to be published, although after some re- vision, mainly of the English wording or style. In a letter to Munira van Voorst van Beest of 12 November 1972, Sakina writes: '... so in the many lectures of which 1 therefore handed over to Murshida Goodenough the typewritten transcript of my shorthand report- ing, she made minor changes.' At that time and also in later years Sakina often hesitated as to whether she should adopt Murshida Goodenough's changes, and those some- times made by other mureeds, or not. Again and again she came to the con- clusion that she had to restore the changed words back to those she had taken down in shorthand. This becomes clear also from her letters to various mureeds and from notes she made. There are instances where Murshida Goodenough calls various texts copied by her from Sakina's shorthand transcriptions with a few alterations, 'reportings* or even indicates them as 'reported by Murshida Coodenough.' This may seem somewhat confusing. In this series of original texts the word 'reporting', although not an established English usage, denotes the lectures or other teachings taken down while Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan spoke them. This is not the meaning which Murshida Goodenough sometimes gives to the word 'reporting.' As to the questions and answers, in several cases Murshida Goodenough also took down what she could in longhand, abbreviating many words. Even though the result was often very fragmentary, it sometimes helped to fill in gaps in Sakina's shorthand. Besides that, Murshida Goodenough worked with the questions and answers, and they are found in her handwriting, copied, recopied and revised, partly to be inserted in the lectures and partly for what appear to be her own compilations on certain subjects of Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's teachings. Notes The guidelines designed and observed by the present compiler in draw- ing up the notes call for a somewhat more detailed explanation. The first thing taken into consideration was the value of the variant readings and da-"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"ta regarding each lecture as collected in the Nekbakht Foundation archives. In the case of handwritten copies, for instance, answers are required to such questions as these: 'Whose handwriting is this?', 'Is this a longhand report- ing or a copied text?', and if it is a copy, 'From what has this been copied and for what purpose?' And so on. By a thorough study of these documents it has proven possible, on the whole, to trace the history of the text of a lecture or other teaching: from the shorthand or longhand reportings of Pir- o-Murshid lnayat Khan's words, handwritten and typewritten copies, cyclo- styled copies (an early form of stencilling) and preparations for multiplica- tion and/or publication, up to the Headquarters' copy for distribution among mureeds or the first edition of a book. Later versions have not been taken into consideration, as the object of this series of books is to present the source materials of Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's teaching in the words spoken by him and reported as such. Strictly speaking, of course, even the preparations for multiplication and distribution among mureeds by Interna- tional Headquarters, and the book preparations and first publication of a lecture in book form, do not belong to this object. However, for purposes of study and research, it clearly is important that the variants in these versions from the shorthand reportings, or other documents nearest to the source, should also be indicated in the notes. Not all the available documents have been mentioned in the notes, as this would create a needless confusion. Shorthand reportings made by those entrusted with this task by Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan naturally represent a more exact and reliable rendering of the words spoken by him than longhand reportings. Sometimes a small group of mureeds would gather in the evening during the Summer School and, using their memories and longhand notes, try to reconstruct the lectures given on that same day; these again have less value, of course, than longhand reportings. The value of copies--handwritten or typewritten--made for the purpose of multiplication or publication, or other elaborations showing alterations or revisions, again varies greatly. Only if the shorthand reporting is missing, or if it shows omissions and uncertainties, do these other documents come to the fore. In.the notes some particulars regarding the texts are given. With the variant readings, it has been indicated what kind of document is referred to and who produced it (see Explanation of Abbreviations). The numbers in the text indicating the notes have been repeated in the following instances: I 1. when a word has been moved within a sentence; 2. when the note refers to a set of words rather than just one; 3. when the same information applies in more than one place."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Purpose and Use of the Book A study of this book can serve various purposes, and not all the notes will be equally interesting to all readers. For instance, an editor, comparing the basic text with the text of the first edition of a book in order to decide if a new edition would be justified, need only consult the notes marked 'Bk.'. For students of Sufism as taught by Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan, and/or leaders of Sufi groups, a comparison between the basic text and the versions multiplied and distributed by International Headquarters ('hq.t.' or 'hq.st.') may be of interest. Most researchers will probably wish to concentrate on the words as spoken by Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan, or as near as we can come to the original words, to be found in the basic text, and will probably wish to con- sult the notes only when this text is unclear or incomplete. The extensive subject index may prove useful for private study, as well as for scholarly purposes in general. In conclusion, the objects of this book, and indeed of the whole series, may be summed up as threefold: -- to safeguard for posterity the teachings of Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan gathered in the Biographical Department; -- to serve as the basis of future publications and translations; -- to make the earliest source materials of Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's words available to scholars, researchers, students and the many persons interested today in finding the sources of authen- tic spirituality.

The omnipotent intelligence, which is in the rock, in the tree, in animal and man, shows its gradual unfoldment; it is a fact accepted by science and metaphysics both. This intelligence shows its culmination in a complete development of human personality. And it is in this personality, such as that of Jesus, Christ was recognized by his followers. The followers of Buddha recognized the same fulfilment5 of the object of creation in Gautama Buddha and the Hindus saw the same in Shri Krishna. In Moses the followers of Moses recognized that, and maintained their belief for thousands of years. And the same culmination of the all-pervading intelligence was recognized in k4ahommed6 by his fol- lowers. Notes: The lecture \"Christ\" has become \"Religious Gatheka\" no. 21 and was first pub- lished in the book The Unity of Religious Ideals (1929). Where \"book\" is mentioned in the notes, it refers to the book The Unity of Religious Ideals, compiled and prepared for publication by Murshida Good- enough. 1.

The teaching3' is31 like the composition of a composer who writes music in all different keys, and who puts the highest note and the lowest notes32 and notes of different octaves in his music. The teach- ings of the prophets are nothing but the answer to the demands of individual and collective souls. Sometimes a childlike soul comes and asks34 and an answer is given appropriate to his understanding.35 An old soul comes .36 When two teachings are brought to- gether, 38a teaching which Krishna gave to a child and a teaching which Buddha gave to an old soul, one does not do37 justice to compare.38 It is easy to say that39 'I do not like the music of Wagner, I simply hate it,' but I should think it would be better to become40 Wagner first and then to hate if one likes.

But what is most essential is not a miracle; the most essential5* is the understanding of life. 6 The soul who realized before he claimed to be Alpha and Omega is Christ. To know intellectually that life is eternal or that the whole life is one is not sufficient, although it is the first step in the direction towards perfection. The actual realization of this comes from the personality of the God-conscious a fragrance in his thought, speech and action, and proves in the world as incense when put on54 fire. There are beliefs, such as the salvation through Christ, and the man who is agitated against religion closes the doors of his heart before having the patience to understand what really it means. It only means that there is no liberation without an ideal before one. The ideal is a stepping-stone towards that attainment which is called liberation. There are others who cannot conceive of55 the thought of Christ's di- vinity. The truth is that the soul of man is divine, and that di~ine,~~~~' with the unfoldment of the soul, when58 reaches the point of culmination, then it59 deserves being called divine. And there is a great difference in the beliefs of people who have vari- ous opinions about the immaculate birth of Jesus. And the truth is that when the soul arrives to8 the point of understanding the truth of life in its collec- tive aspect, he realizes that there is only one Father and that is God; and this world, out of which all the names and forms have been created, is the Mother; and the Son, who deserves6' by his recognizing the Mother and Father and by hisd1 serving his Mother and Father and by fulfilling the aim of creation, is the Son of God.

There is no end of68 faults in man's life, and if they were all recorded and there was no erasing of them, life would be terrible to live,69 impossible to live. The impression of sin in the terms70 of metaphysics may be called an illness, a mental illness, not physical.71 And as the doctor is able to cure the illness, so the doctor of the soul is able to heal. And if people have said that through Christ the72 sins are forgiven, that can be understood in this way, that love is that shower by which all is purified. No stain remains. What is Cod? Cod is love.73 His mercy, His compassion, tiis kindness, when73 expressed through a Cod-realized personality, then the stains of one's faults, mistakes and wrongdoings are washed away, and the soul becomes as clear as it has always been.

It teaches that those who 'give importance to the flesh and blood of the Master are mistaken, that the true being of the Master was bread and wine. If he had any flesh and blood, it was the bread and wine. And what is bread and wine? The bread is that which is soul's sustenance; the soul's sustenance is the knowledge of God; it is by this knowledge that the soul lives the eternal life. And the blood of Christ is the love element, the love principle,g0 the intoxication of which is a bliss; and if there is any virtue, it all comes from that principle. And there is another question:91 Christ gave his life to save the world. It only explains sacrifice, that no man in this world going toward the goal will escape from the testg2 that life will give him.92 And that test is sacri- fice. At every step towards the final goal to the attainment, he will be asked a sacrifice which will be a greater and greater one as he will continue on the path, where he will arrive to8 a point where there is nothing, whether his body or mind, or action or thought or feeling that he keeps back from sacrifice for others. And it is that by which man proves that realiza- tion of divine truth.

But as man has lived for generations 24increasing the life24 of artificiality, he has moved further25 and further25 from nature. Therefore this vehicle, which was made a perfect instrument to experience life fully, has become more and more incapable of attaining that object. It is this incapability of experiencing life fully and that26 innate desire27 of experience of life28 which makes29 soul strive for spiritual attainment. What man does not know, he thinks it does not exist. In this is to be found the reason of materialism. But the tendency towards spiritual realization remains there, as an innate desire which is consciously or unconsciously felt by every soul, whether spiritual or material. It is therefore that a material person has a silent craving in his heart to probe the depth30 of the spiritual ideal which he disowns. The work of the senses is to experience the taste, smell, touch, to hear and to see.31 But besides this32 the inner sense is one sense. It is by exper- iencing through different organs of the senses that 33 one sense becomes many senses.

And by being in the45 akasha the nature of all things is revealing.46 Plainly speaking there is nothing in this world which does not speak. Every thing and47 being is continually calling out its nature,48 character and its secret. And the more the inner sense is open, the more it becomes capa- ble of hearing the voice of all things.

Or by surrounding it with some chemical substance you may preserve it for a very long time. So with sins; all that has been made can be destroyed. If one individual has the power of destroy- ing, another has the power of creating. Creating is more diffi- cult than destroying. A great Sufi saint said, on hearing 'from his mureedsl problems of sin and virtue, reward and ~irtue:~ 'My mureeds, do not worry over problems of sin and virtue. They are things which man makes.' The difficulty is that man lives so much in the outer life, he thinks he can destroy a table or a chair because he holds it in his hand, but what he holds in thought and feeling, he is not master but slave of. But if he can learn to be master of his3 feeling,4 he can destroy what he wishes. Notes: Sk-tp. here refers to Sakinats typewritten copy of Sr., with a few alterations. 1.

He was called Buddha because his spirit expressed the meaning of the word Buddh. The word Buddh in San- skrit means reason. ln2 Buddhistic terminology the Spirit of Guidance is named Buddhi Sattva, which means the essence of reason. Reason in its essence is of a liquid form, it is the cream of3intelligence. When it is crys- tallized it becomes rigid. Very often intellectuality explains a knowledge formed by reasons, most of them of rigid character. The fine reason is subtle; the finer the reason, the less it can be expressed4 in words. It is therefore that the5 people with fine reason cannot very well put their reason into words. Reason in its essence is the depth of intelligence. The intelligence knows, not because it has learned; it knows because it knows. In this higher reason the Spirit of Guidance is conceived, and from that6 fountain of reason all the great prophets have drunk. In the teaching of true Buddhism Buddha has never been considered as an exclusive personality. Buddha has been known to the Buddhists who have understood his Message rightly, as a man who attained the realization of that essence of reason in which is the fulfilment of life's purpose. ln7 worshipping Buddha it7 does not mean that a8 Buddhist worships the person- ality of his spiritual master. He only means by this worship that, if there is Notes: The lecture \"Buddha\" has become \"Religious Gathekaw no. 22, and was first pub- lished in the book The Unity of Religious Ideals (1929).

The finer the organ, the more perceptible3 it is; the grossness takes away from the organ its perceptibility.4 This shows that the body may be likened to a glass house made of mirrors. ln5 Persian language the poets have called it ainah-e-khana, meaning the temple of mirrors.

So this17 is natural when a soul feels downhearted or18 depressed, that there is something wrong with the vehicle. When the writer wishes to work and the pen is not in order, it annoys him; there is nothing the matter with the writer, it is the pen which is not right.

It becomes unhappy when something is the matter with its vehicle, which is its instrument, its tool, to experience life with.lg Care of the body, therefore, is the first and the20 most important principle of religion.

Question: If the past can be destroyed, what happens to the akasha records? Answer: What is once created, manifests and goes on manifesting. It requires a tremendous power to destroy what one has created, but the idea of the mystic is hidden in the word 'annihilation,' which is not generally understood. Annihilation is really the art of the mystic. Shiva is called the destroyer, his power is considered greater than that of Brahma, the Creator. This sub- ject takes man in one of the greatest of mysteries. If there were no means of destroying, then the unharmoniousl elements would consume the whole creation. By means of destruction, creation is restored, but one must know what to destroy. A Persian verse says: 'The master-mind is that which knows what to destroy and what to restore.' The plants and trees have bugs and germs. These may be destroyed and the plant may be better. So in the character of man, in his mind and thought, are things that may be destroyed. Many people hold the thought of illness fast for many years and, in spite of many remedies, they are still ill. Healing is the way of destroying these thoughts. True healing is the destruction of these thoughts. Question: As the whole life is based on destroying, and the end, the fulfillment of all creation will be de- stroying, what is meant by the Buddhistic law \"not to destroy.\" Why is this law not in this form in other religions? Is \"not to destroy\" an incom- plete expression of a law? What is the real mean- ing of that law and how should be its more bal- anced expression? Answer : The idea of the Buddhist in not to destroy is that which should be maintained should be protected. The people who are very destructive, they are destroying things which should be protected and preserved. So kindness and love is taught to the Note: 1.

Two among these centres are of great importance: the heart and the head.

Metaphysics. Cen- tres' of July 4th, 1923. 1 Summer School Suresnes, July 1923 Question: As .the Sufi training differs from that of the Yogis in training both centres from heart and head together, there must be two ways of the Yogi training, i.e. training the heart more than the head and training the head more than the heart. Is this right? Will you tell us more about it? Answer: The Yogis of ancient times had one training only? the training of the head centrd to make the sight keen and the perception deep, but the training of the heart is the Sufi method. Among the Yogis came from the time of Krishna the training of Bhakti. The Sufi has always considered that train- ing of head and heart gave balance in life. If one visits in India places of the great Yogis and of the great Sufis, the atmosphere and the impression that one gets in the presence of Yogi is very strong, the impression is that everything is worthless and nothing is worthwhile in life. Only one thing they desire and that is to get away from it, and by getting away from it, to get above it. This makes one feel that one does not wish to remain one moment in this world, one wants to go to the caves and forests and to pass one's whole life in the eternal peace, the only true bliss and happiness there is. Then there is the feeling in the presence of the Yogi as if nothing exists, not even trees, plants, birds. The overwhelming influence of the Yogi is such that the person feels for the moment that he is blind and deatp to the whole world. He only feels the One Eternal Being, all else is non-existent witp him, and in his presence you may even come to the point where you do not know any existence at all. In the presence of the Sufi you feel the atmosphere of love, kindness, affec- tion, service, sociability, friendliness, because the central Notes 1.

So he lives in the pres- ence of his Beloved and love he considers as life. So in his presence you have the feeling of fulness of joy and of the fra- grance of roses, of incense bringing ecstasy with the joy. Many in disappointment, heartbroken and in trouble, go in the pres- ence of the Sufi and from his word, his glance, his silence, his atmosphere, get encouraged to fight on, courage to look for- ward to life, if it is not now good it will be better to-morrow, if he does not understand now, he will tomorrow. That which he cannot attain now, to-morrow will be attainable. A Sufi has always hope, because while the idea of the Yogi begins with the object to lose his self and to live in the perfection of Cod, the Sufi begins his journey to perfection in the human soul first and in this the Sufi considers the fulfilment of coming upon earth. After accomplishing this, the other thing which the Yogi strives for, does not come so difficult, he can then easily attain that ideal, which is one step further. In this way the Sufi fulfils the first step to experience the perfection of the human soul. A second step is to learn the perfection of the being of Cod. To one the Yogi part is more akin, but as far as I see I think that to many the part of' the Sufi appeals most. Imagine if all had to leave the world and go to the caves and the forests in order to become wise, then what would the world be without any of the wise? The power of the Yogi is such that their presence is an intoxication. To the Indian tem- perament the Yogi method appeals much. Vairagya is very dear to the people of India. The very presence of the Yogi con- vinces many of the futility of life. Question: What do you mean by saying that breath gives food and breath to the centres? Answer: Food and breath both, food taken into the breath and breath also in a symbolical sense, breath created by the power of vibration. Just as in an engine steam is necessary as well as the engineer, so in the working of the centres two things are necessary: nourishment of finer food' inhaled through the breath and vibrations of finer motions created by the repeti- tion of a certain word. This word sets certain atoms into motion; so they come into life again. Question: What is the proportioned value of the sacred words spoken in the silence? Answer: Mind has its own vibration. A person, f.i. in a chaotic state of mind comes into your presence and you feel it at once. Therefore thought has its vibration, but thought and word together make the vibration more perfect and more powerful."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Sakina's handwritten copied text;' it is not known if she also reported it.

Question: Did the Zoroastrians worship nature or the spirits of nature? Answer: The worship of God as taught by Zarathushtra was not of- fered to the spirits of nature, but through nature to God. Nature was the object through which God can be communi- cated with. He taught his followers to think of God and bow to nature. Question: Do you mean by nature human nature as well as the nature surroundings? Answer: Human nature comes as a second or third step in spiritual development. First man learns to see God through the sun, moon, stars, clouds, forests. There we see the endlessness of nature, that suggests that God is unlimited, endless. It is easy here to imagine the endless unlimited aspect of God. By seeing man, one sees his limitation until life has become clear. Then, when you consider a drop and see in that drop the ocean, that is an advanced stage. To see the ocean and to realize the drop, that is one step, but to see the ocean in the drop is a very advanced step, because then he sees in the drop the ocean, the source of the drop. When a person is able to recog- nize through the limitation of the human being with all his errors, the God behind him, then his sight has become keen. Purity is the main thing that Zoroaster had to teach, not fire worship. Fire was only the suggestion element. The interpretation of fire is light. Man by nature is attracted to light. The sun gives such a joy; when the sun is covered by the cloud it causes depression. One likes to sit by the fire. Light as a jewel and in every form is appealing. The jewel only reflects the light. Gold is valuable because it reflects the light. So in all its aspects earthly and heavenly 'light is attractive. Note: 1.

Moses i.9 the most shining prophet of the Old Testament, gave to the world the Divine Law, the Ten Commandments, which in reality was the in- terpretation of the Divine Law that he perceived, expressed in the words of those who stood before him at that time of the world's civilization. It is in- teresting to notice the Sufi-saying which comes from the ages, which says: 'Be the follower of love and forget all distinction1'; for in this path of spir- itual attainment to claim that 'I am so and so* is meaningless. Moses was found by the riverside by a princess, who knew not what family he came from, or who was his father and mother. Only the Name of Cod came to the mind .of every thoughtful inquirer as to the Father and Mother of Moses. When people compare the teachings of different religions, and readily form their opinions upon them, they are often mistaken; it is premature to make such distinctions. There comes a stage in the evolution of an illuminated soul who2 begins to see the law hidden behind nature, the true psychology; to him the whole life reveals the secrets of its nature and character, and when he gives an interpretation of these secrets to others, they become limited, for they take the colour of his own personality and the form of the thought of those to whom the Message is given. The story of Moses, as told by Sufis, is most interesting and helpful to the traveller on the path. Moses has been the favourite character of the poets of Arabia and Persia, and in the poems of the Persian Sufis, Moses is3 often mentioned, as Krishna is mentioned in the poetry of the Hindus.

From that time the7 Mount Sinai was the place where he often went and communicated with God.

No, labour is necessary for material attainment; for spiritual attainment what one needs is the seeking soul like that of Moses. hioses8 falling down upon the ground, may be interpreted as the cross, which means: 'I am not, Thou art.' In order to be, one must pass a stage of being nothing. In the Sufi terms it is called 'Fana,' when one thinks '1 am not' g(what I had always thought myself to be).9 This is the true selfdenial which the Hindus called 'laya' and in Buddhism the termlo annihilation. It is the annihilation of the false self which gives rise to the true self. Once this is done, from that moment man approaches closer and closer to God and stands face to face with his Divine Ideal, with Whom he can communicate at every moment of his life.

And he had to fulfil the particular office that at the time he was acting in the capacity of. Question: What is the symbol ogy of the burning bush? Answer: When illumination comes, it seems to bring annihilation, but it does not bring annihilation, it is in reality illumination. Question: What is the symbology of Moses striking the rock? Answer: It is the symbology of a heart. The heart is a rock; where a cleft is made in it, the spring of life pours out. Question: What is the meaning of Moses breaking the tables of stone? Answer: There are times that souls like Moses at one time they receive the Ten Commandments and give them to the people, and at other times they see the endless laws before them, which a million commandments may not be enough to express. So with us there are times of goodness and badness, times of joy and depression; all individuals have these changes.

Metaphysics' of July 7th, 1923.' Summer School Suresnes, July 1923 Question: Is the form of mind character? Answer: No, the soul, the spirit of man is his character. The form of the mind is what the mind thinks about, and generally thinks about the body which is attached to it. So, when anything is wrong with the body, the mind feels: ' I am ill', while the pain and discomfort is not in the mind; it is in the body. It is re- flected badi! in the mind. Mind has power to hold everything in its memory; so if the body is cured by medicine, if the mind still holds the thought of pain, the body cannot give up the ill- ness. The greatest difficulty in the spiritual path is to remove the false self from the intelligence; it stands in the way of the soul. It strives te-8ttai.n for all that pertains to the false self. So the soul is kept busy with something which in the end is nothing, and cannot see beyond it. Question: What is the key of the mind? Answer: The key of the mind is to open the house of the mind, to open all the doors and cupboards and see what is hidden, what is valuable, and what is worth keeping: what should be put out. The soul is like the crown-prince, he does not know the secrets of his kingdom, he knows he is the crown-prince and once he got the key enters in the possession. His kingdom is then before him.

In this re- spect Rama was not only an ideal for the Hindus of that particular age but was a model to mould the character of those who tread the spiritual path in any age. Rama was a prince by birth, but was given to be trained unde? a sage, where6 he lived the life in the solitude, the life of study and play both to- gether. He was not only taught to read and write, but he was trained in7 athletic exercises, in sports, and had a training of8 all theg manner of war- fare.

Answer: Hanuman is the primitive set& man, and the monkeys also, they were not monkeys, but primitive men. Rama had no army, so he used an army of primitive men. This shows how to the unlettered primitive men the illuminated soul is born to give the Message. They were willing to sacrifice life in the cause of Rama. It was not by his knowledge and wisdom that Rama attracted, but by the power of love and compassion and realization of God. He endeared to him all who came in con- tact with him. There was a real bridge made in that place. Lanka was the country we call Ceylon. In a sense was4 all symbolical. Another part of the story of Rama tells how equipped in scientific knowledge they were in those days. When Rama returned with Sita, he came in a 'vima', which means aeroplane.

This shows that the condition of the one who is blinded by anger and passion, so that he forgets the existence of Cod, he has not yet arrived to what may be called human. An example of this is the story of Ali: Ali was fighting in the battle-field, a hand to hand fighting. The man who was fighting with Ali insulted him with spitting at him. That brought a changed condition. Though the man was under the grip of Ali, he let him loose. The man could not understand why he did this, when he could have killed him. He asked: 'what is the reason?' Ali said: 'Yes, I fight in war- fare, but not in anger. When anger comes, I suspend the activ- ities of my life and think of God'. There can be no greater sign of spiritual development than control over temper and anger. If one can control these, one controls life. Anger rules man more than anything else. If one can control anger, one will always prove successful over one's8 adversaries. The one who fails in anger, he will find failure after failure. The rule of life is that failure causes failure, success causes success. When one fails to govern himself, he fails to govern everything in life. So the life ge-te of many go9 to bits, they cannot con- trol their outer affairs because they cannot control them- selves. The one who struggles with himself, gains very great part. 7.

The mind is made after the body. It is therefore that its form is that of the body. We read in the Old Testament that2 heavens were made after the earth. The real place where the heavens are made is within man. 3~ind is made of all one learns, one experiences, one loves and one remembers. It is therefore that man is that which his mind contains. If his mind contains a sorrow, man is s~rrow;~ if his mind contains joy, he5 is joyous; if it contains success, he is successful. If it contains failure, failure awaits him; every- where he may move,6 he will find7 failure. %ind is an accommodation in which man collects all that he learns and experiences in life.

Meta- physics' of July 8th, 1923.' Question: What do you mean by the secret of reincarnation as a doctrine of Hindus? It did not explain Karma. Answer: Karma is another side of reincarnation. What I am saying is: why some are born as a genius for art, music, painting, etc. Why are they born like this? The Hindus say: it is reincarnation of a great genius. The child does not only inherit from the nation, the parents, the races, etc. Certain impressions gained by the soul from some spirit as he passes through. Question: Is there some law when one comes on earth? It does not happen in a haphazard way? Answer: This very subtle problem is very difficult to explain. We are helped by understanding the meaning of accident and in- tention. They are two things, distinct, one intention and one accident. It helps us whenever if we try to discover what is hidden behind accident. Then we come to the intention in the scheme of working of the whole. Everything has a purpose, nothing is an accident. But there is accident to our mind, so accident exists for us like a shadow. Neither shadow has a real existence, nor accident. As the idea of accident goes on, it attracts accidents more and more, i.e. a person may wander for six months in Paris and he will not find a thief, but for a thief it will not take six hours to find one, for the law of attraction works. There is a verse in Qur'an, which explains this very well: 'Not one atom moves without the command of God'. Intention is behind every activity and intention which we do not know, we call accident. Question: Is the mind complete when it no 1 onger has a body? Some people died very young. Answer: The mind is complete according to the experience it has. Then you can call it mind.

It is not the body which becomes individualized, the mind becomes individualized through the mastery of the body. The mind as a record begins as soon as the child sees and hears. The body is like a machine that the soul takes and recalls2 every impression upon it. Question: Does the soul not come on earth then many times? Answer : It is very difficult to define 'soul'. The best answer is: the, soul is the ray of the sun, which is the infinite spirit. Ray is an action of the sun, it is the ray itself, it manifests and returns as man inhales and exhales. Man's breath is himself, the existence is the one whose action it is. So is the soul we speak of. Question: Does the soul retain the experiences gained on earth? Answer: This brings one to the ultimate truth. You see, the light in all its forms is the light of the sun. In the gas, in the electric light, candle, star, planet, it is all a property of the sun, but we call it by different names. Soul is the life and light itself, it is God's own being. It manifests outwardly, and because of the smallness of the channels through which it comesI3 becomes small. But it is louder4 than we can possibly imagine. When the light is put out, it is not lost, for it is the property of the sun. Every experience, even of animals, germs, are all col- lected and all remain in the one mind, which is the mind of Cod. Distributed at the same time to different souls, the closer we are, the more we benefit. And so we all have the right to make use of the storehouse of Cod. Therefore spiritual people have been inspirational physicians, scientists, kings judges, inventors, statesmen, because they get the key to this 4 storehouse of knowledge. Scientists such as Edison may not appear to be spiritual, but their soul touched the storehouse of knowledge and they got inspiration. Solomon said there is nothing new under the sun. All the knowledge that ever was, is stored in the storehouse of God, and can be gained in accord- ance to our openness. 2. Sk-tp.: flrecalls\" changed into ttrecordstt 3. Ibid.: \"Itw added 4.

When we think deeply on the problem of life, there is no path in the world-- whether spiritual or material--which we can tread successfully without a44 sacrifice; sometimes the sacrifice is great and45 sometimes small. Some- times the sacrifice is made first, before achieving the success, and some- times afterwards. As sacrifice is necessary in life, it is made by everyone in some form or the other.46 But when it is made willingly, it turns into a virtue. The greater the ideal, the greater47 sacrifice it demands; and if one saw wisely the process of advancement through life, in any direction of life, it is nothing but a continual sacrifice.

Though from the point of view of the Absolute, truth is one and the same, everywhere, the form differs greatly. The form given by the prophets of Ben lsrael is the form of Cod as Creator, Sustainer, Judge. The form in which Buddha gave it was more scientific and IogicaJ, appearing2 to the intellect of India. The. truth'does not differ, though the method of presenting it does. All the Hindu-religions originated from the esoteric school of Egypt, also the relig- ion of Ben lsrael came from Abraham, who was initiated in the same school. Therefore as the source and goal of all creation is one, so the source and goal of all religions is one. In the family of Abraham, Jesus Christ was born, also Mohammed, also Moses. The influence of Abraham's teaching travelled to Persia and moulded into the religion of Zoroaster with some Hindu ideals. So Zoroastrianism differs in some way with the religions of Ben lsrael but it has the influences of both.. One can 'find fault with any religion that is vastly spread. Because those who come to follow bring their own faults and merits and add these to the religion. We human beings have very few merits when we compare them with our faults. Notes: 1.

A man was travelling in the hot sun towards the woods. He became so tired that he felt like sitting under the shade of a tree. Then he thought: 'if there were a little mattress to sit on, it would be better than stones'; and as he looked, he saw the mattress already there; then he thought: 'the tree is so hard to lean against', and when he turned, he saw there was a cushion already existing. Then he thought: 'this mattress is too hard, if I had a cushion to sit on at the same time, now I am so tired'; and it was there. Then he thought: 'if I had some cooling syrup to drink, itz6 would be very nice'; and then he saw someone bringing him syrup. He was astonished and very glad. Then he thought: 'this tree is not enough, it would be nice to have a house'; and a beautiful little house was there. Then he thought: 'walking in the woods is very tiring, I must have a chariot'; and the chariot and thez7 horses were there. Then he was very astonished and could not understand.

Question: What is the special character of Mohammed's Mes- sage? Answer: The unity or the oneness of God. At this time there were many gods worshipped in Arabia. Every family had their own god. The many wars of that time were mostly religious wars caused by the insults from the followers of the different gods. At that time a large part of the world worshipped idols of many gods. The main truth of life was forgotten, so the Message of the Prophet was to teach the worship of one God. Question: Why is it said that the Message of Mohammed is the most compl ete one? Answer: One finds in history no scripture so authentic as Qur'an has been kept. All the Prophet has said is to be found there in his own words. The actual word preserved has a greater value than the interpretation of that which he taught, because man colours every interpretation with his own ideas. Question: Has the Message of Mohammed a special democratic character? Answer: The Prophet had a democratic idea in praying. In Islam king and servant stand shoulder to shoulder before the Almighty. When they go to Mecca the Moslems must wear one and the same H.,~ whether king or pauper. At the same time equality was taught in more pronounced way in Islam, so the priesthood was not allowed. When they travelled, three or four disciples with the Prophet, the desire of the disciples was to make the Prophet comfort- able and for them to do work and to bring food to him, but Notes: 1.

So human and so democratic the Prophet was in his life, that when he desired to go back to Mecca, where he had been exiled and insulted, he had the only wish that he still wanted to bring the Message there in his lifetime. His disciples all said 'Prophet, no one dare stand against you, we will stand with youm. Ten thousand people arrived with Mohammed at2 doors of Mecca. Many lives were lost, but the Prophet was success- ful and entered. Those who had insulted and killed his most beloved followers, they were arrested and brought before the Prophet. The Prophet said that they must be brought with re- spect. When before him, they said: What will you do with us? we are guilty. And the Prophet said: there is nothing, I have forgiven all. They said: what shall we do? He asked his army: what do you want from them, money? or part of their country? They said: no Prophet, we have fought to bring the Message, and we have brought it. All we want is to have our Prophet with us. And the Prophet said: I will renounce my home and country, and live all my life with you; and he blessed them the people of Mecca and left with them the Message. Question: Why did Mohammed all ow polygamy? Answer: Why has2 Creator created nature among animals and birds? That nature being given, shows that polygamy did not belong to the teaching of Mohammed, but to nature itself. Mohammed was the first prophet who spoke on that subject, and brought the number of wives to less than it had been. It was the wrong interpretation of his teaching that made his name molest. Question: Did you say that Mohammed ordained no priests? Answer: Yes. 2. Sk.tp.: \"them added"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"An old typewritten copy made of Kismet's shorthand transcription.

It is the inharmony18 between mind and body which most often causes sickness andlg affairs go wrong. when2 body goes South and the mind North then the soul is pulled asunder, then20 there is no happiness. The secret of mysticism, therefore, is to feel, think, say,21 speak and act at the same time, for then all that is said or felt or done becomes perfect. The different minds in the world may be likened to various mirrors, capable of projecting reflections and subject to reflect all that falls upon them. No one, however great in wisdom and power can claim beingZ2 free from influences. It is like the mirror claiming 'I reflect all that falls upon me'. Only the difference between the wise and foolish is that the wise24 turns his back to what he must not reflect, the foolish does not only reflect the undesirable thought, but most proudly owns25 it. 2~ind is creative and 2mind is destructive.

Question: Which part of the mind makes the dream? Answer : The mind itself, that which creates thought and imagination; but there are three functions which go together in ierrn making the dream: the memory, the imagination and the ego. In every dream there is the ego. The clearer the mind, the clearer the dream and the subtler the mind, the subtler the dream. Dream is an instrument which tells man in what condi- tion heis his mind is. Why dream has its influence upon life, it is because the mind has its influence upon life. Question: What does mean: \"Body is made by mind, not the same mind, but by other minds\"? Answer: This means: The mind before the body was made, was only an akasha, the experience is gained through the body as a vehi- cle, that has become its knowledge and it is knowledge, which makes it mind. The akasha which becomes mind after the soul was born on earth, has already gathered some indistinct knowledge from various minds with which it came in contact while coming on earth; perhaps more from one mind than from others, in that case it has won more character than of one soul, who passed from earth. Upon this that2 akasha (mind) has gained the knowledge or the mentality, from the parents, from their ancestors, its race and from the particular grade of evolution of that particular time of the whole humanity.

Answer: Man is always at fault, at a thousand faults. Illness can have several causes. lnharmony between the mind and the body. lnharmony in life. Illness is inharmony. If one will avoid inharmony, one will be well. This is the key to life. The first is to make peace with oneself and that gives the strength of thousand. If falling down by trying to do good to others, one has done no good to others, but if he was so strong that he could stand alone, that would be good work. The idea is this: we must first concern with ourselves, make our thought, word and action harmonious, then we give example to every one, and this must sooner or later have its effect. If we only knew, there is no use troubling about others. We must try to correct ourselves, because there is no end to the correction we need in every thing. An awakened soul does not concern the faults of others, but concerns itself and takes itself to task. Question: What is meant: by feeling, thinking, eeC4-g-aind epee3&ag speaking and acting at the same time? Answer: For instance in our prayers, in the elevation service, when we say prayers we must realize its meaning, feel its effect, and perform the movements. It is feeling, speaking, thinking and acting at the same time. It means all our activities devoted to one direction and this concentration of every form into one action has the perfect power.4 3.

Summer School Suresnes, July 12th, 1923 Address to the rnureeds.' I would like to speak a few words to my mureeds on the question of the Message. There are some who are aware of the aspect of the Movement which is most important: the Message. No doubt the Sufi School has existed all the time, but the Sufi Message is destined for this time. The School of Sufism has existed in the East as a School of esoteric studies, but that does not mean that our esoteric School differs from that of the Sufis. If it differs it is only that this is the School of all Schools. The most important feature of the Sufi Movement now is the Message. We call it Sufi Message because it is the Message of Wisdom, but in point of fact it is Divine Message, and since it is His Message God Himself is responsible for its spread. This Message is the answer of Cod to the cry of humanity. As all things have to be small before they grow large, so the Message is in its infancy, and it needs on the part of the mureeds a great struggle of faith to feel confidence in the activity and strength of an infant. The crescent is not necessarily full moon, and those who are not acquainted with the nature of the crescent might say, this is not the moon which we know as full moon. The work of our Movement is quiet working for God and humanity, and such mureeds who from their own feeling are convinced of the truth of the Message and those who do not require any claims made or any wonders per- formed, in order to prove the genuineness of the Message, and in whose heart there is no question as to the blessing and good tidings the Message brings, they think and feel as I do that we are all destined to play our part in this blessed Movement. And in this way we are united heart and soul one with another. The more we are conscious of this unity, the more we can realize the importance and the benefit of harmony, which is the key note to life in the world. What is wanted in the world is harmony and we, the work- ers for the Message, by our harmony with each other must prove to the world the central theme of the Message. We must show love and kindness to our fellow-workers in the Movement, we must be happy and proud if they do good work, and we must try to shield their faults instead of trying to expose them in order to show our superiority over others. The spirit we should observe is the spirit of not only brotherhood, but of losing our self in Notes: 1.

There are many things to learn in order to enable ourselves to be worthy of this great privilege of serving God's Message, and it is a question of deep study. It is not only the willingness to work which helps, it is knowing how to work. Success is the thing we must learn. Often one thinks that 'in order to work I must be appointed to a certain positionm, but my experience has given me the belief that whatever be one's position, the true worker will prove in the end worthy of whatever position he has. The worker need not follow the position, the position will pursue the worker. Always we must remember that there is so much work to be done, and that it is the workers which are needed, in spite of existing conditions in every direction in life; I always listen to what they say with pessimism when a person says there is no work to do. There is a work to do for every soul, but the workers are very few. There is no end to the demand, for unselfish workers in the Cause of God, in the path of truth, are so rarely to be found. At this moment our Movement needs workers more than anything, workers who are not only willing to do the work, but workers who know how to do it. In all aspects of life, spiritual or material, there is a continual struggle, and we must remember that to become a worker in the spiritual path even2 must be thorough in one's knowledge of the struggle of life. 1 feel stronger and more hopeful to find by my side souls who are earnestly desirous of helping the course3 to whatever extent they can, for which I feel thankful to Cod, and if I have anything more to say, it is only this: we must all try to prepare ourselves to become such workers that we may be able to fulfil the Divine trust, which has been given to us in our lives. 2.

Question: How can be explained from a Sufi point of view the expression: the Hessage from above? 1 Is a certain aspect of God thought to be above and why? What does mean God from the East and the West? and why is not added from the North and the South? Answer: 'The mystical conception of above is not always 'in the sky, but above means higher, greater, beyond. But it is most wonderful to notice that the same tendency to reach above can be found in all aspects of life. It is the tendency of the tree to rise above. %he waves struggle2 continually to rise. They fall because they cannot rise. The tendency of the earth beneath our feet is also the same, which is shown by3 the mountain. It is as if the earth speaks through the mountain, 'if I could I would also rise in the air.' The flame shows that the fire has the tendency of going upwards. The animals who are made so that they stand on their four legs, show in their evo- lution also the tendency to stand on their hind-legs; in that they express their4 aspiration to rise. The most beautiful thing in5 horse is when it rearsI6 showing its desire to be man one day. Even heavy animals such as elephants show this. So there is no man in this world which7 does not desire to attain higher, he may not know it, but the desire is hidden in his heart just the same. Notes: 1.

No sooner the soul has touched2 the inner kingdom, which is the divine kingdom,3 the true nobility of the soul becomes manifest from that soul in the.form of graciousness. The kings and those belonging to the aristocratic families were trained in the manner of graciousness. But it is born in the heart of man. This means,4 every soul shows the aristocratic manner from the moment it touches the inner kingdom. This shows that the true aristoc- racy is the nobility of the soul, when the soul begins to express in every feeling, thought, word and action that graciousness which belongs to God Himself. Graciousness is quite different from that wrong manner which is termed in English patronising. The gracious one,5 before expressing that noble6 attribute, tries to hide himself even from his own eyes. The reason why the great ones are gracious, the truly noble people, is because7 they are more sensitive to all the hurt or8 harm that comes to them by9 the unripe. And therefore out of their kindness they try to keep themselves back from doing it lo to another, however small in position.

Question: Is intellectual knowledge located in the brain and wisdom located in the heart? Answer: Neither of these are located in brain or heart, only intel- lectual knowledge has much to do with brain and wisdom comes from within the heart. But in wisdom heart and head both work. Wisdom is spiritual knowledge. The best explanation of wisdom is perfect knowledge, that is the knowledge of life within and without . What is gained by intuition, the mind makes it clear, and yet often it is the mind which spoils the intuition, for the mind in- terferes with the intuition. If the mind did not stand as a hin- drance to intuition, every person would be intuitive, for intui- tion is more natural and more easy than the reasoning of the mind. The intuition by nature is clear, the characteristic of the mind is confusion. If the intuition is disturbed, it is because it has been confused by the mind. However, it is not necessary to give up reason for intuition. But naturally cultivate the fac- ulty of intuition without letting it stand in the way of reason. For instance if a person always did everything trusting to his intuition, he would have many difficulties, for very often the intuition will be wrong, for the reason that as a child he did not begin with intuition. So often reason disguised as intuition deceives him. While developing the faculty of intuition, we1 did not mind being deceived, and risked, then in time the mind would not play its tricks and the intuition will be powerful enough to manifest clearly. In time a person of finer feelings will be able to perceive the voice of intuition and will learn to discriminate between intuition and reason. One thing must be remembered and that is to perceive the first suggestion that rises in the heart before it is disturbed by the action of the mind. If that opportunity is lost, it will not take one moment for the reason to attack the intuition and estab- lish its own place there. Notes: 1.

Saluk. -ihergu,ar- Dar ~usar.' July ISth, 1923 There is a tendency which growingly manifests in a person advancing spiritually, and that tendency is overlooking. At times the same tendency might appear as negligence but in reality negligence is not necessarily2 overlooking. everth he less^ negligence most often4 is not looking. Overlook- ing in other words may be said:5 rising beyond6 things. One has to rise in order to overlook. The one who stands beneath life, he cannot overlook even if he wanted to. Overlooking is a manner of graciousness; it is looking and at the same time not looking. It is to see and not to take notice of seeing. It is to be hurt or harmed or disturbed by something and yet not mind it. It is an attitude of nobleness of nature. It is the sign of souls who are tuned to a higher key. One may ask: is it practical? I may not always be able to say that it is practical but I mean it all the same. For in the end7 the one who overlooks will also realize the practicality of it. May be that he will realize in the long run, before8 he has met withg great many disadvantages of it. Nev- ertheless, that is well which ends well. Very often by overlooking it costs less than by taking notice of something that could well be overlooked. In life there are things which matter and there are things which do not matter, and as one advances through life he finds that there are many things that do not matter, that one could just as well overlook them.

While climbing thisl1 mountain of life, the purpose of which is to reach its top, if a person will trouble about everything that comes along, he will perhaps never be able to reach the top. He will always be troubling at everything at the bottom of it. No soul after realizing that thelo life is only four days on this earth, will trouble about little things. He will trouble about things which really matter. In the strife of little thin s a person loses the opportunity of accomplishing great things in life. The1% one who troubles about small things, is small, the soul who thinks of great things is great. Overlooking is the first lesson of forgiveness. This tendency comes out of love and sympathy; for whom12 one hates, one takes notice of his13 every little fault, but whom12 one loves14 one naturally overlooks his15 faults and very often tries to turn the faults of the one a person loves into merits. he l6 life has endless things which suggest beauty and numberless l7 which suggest ugliness.

Any efforts made in developing the personality or character building, must be2 not for the sake of proving oneself superior to others but in order to become more agreeable to those around one and to those with whom we come in contact. Reconciliation is not only the moral of the Sufi, but3 is the sign of the Sufi. This virtue is not only4 learned and5 practised easily, for it needs not only goodwill, but wisdom. The great talent of the diplomat is to bring about such results as are desirable, with agreement.6 Disagreement is easy. Among the lower creation one sees it so often. What is difficult is the7 agreement, for it wants8 a wider outlook, which is the true sign of spirituality. Narrow- ness of theg outlook makes the horizon of man's visionlo small. That person l l cannot easily agree with another. There is always a meeting ground for two people, however much they differ1* in their thought. But the meet- ing ground may be far off and13 man is not always willing to take the troub- le of going far enough, if it was required in order to make an agreement.

Summer School Suresnes, July 16th, 1923 The most important thing in life is the opening of that clear vision which is opened by the help of insight. The effect of every emotion covers the insight just like2 clouds covering3 the sun. It is therefore that most clever and qualified people often do things especially at the moment of pas- sion or anger, which they would not have done otherwise. The reason is that the mind loses its rhythm under the strain of a passion or emotion and so it upsets the rhythm of4 body. It makes man perplexed and unable to see any condition or situation clearly. It is therefore that the seers, the sages, try to keep their tranquillity at every cost. For life in the world.brings up many things at5 every day and hour to disturb that tranquillity, which is the secret of insight. Every little noise or disturbance in oneself and outside, can upset a person who keeps the rhythm of his whole being in the proper order. It is therefore that the sages have chosen solitude and a life away from the world. But the best way of keeping one's tranquillity is to keep this rhythm under the control of one's own will. By doing this one preserves one's tran- quillity in the midst of life's greatest turmoil. In the terms of Vedanta life is likened to the sea, where there is a continual rising and falling of the waves. Every man b nature seeks peace l and in peace alone6 is his7 satisfaction. But most often he seeks it wrongly. Therefore instead of producing peace, he creates more struggle in life. The secret of peace is in the willpower. Instead of resisting againstg the forces which jar and disturb one's life, if one would only stand firm against them, then one can attain to that tranquillity which is most neces- sary to have a greater insight inlo life. Man is made of atoms, gathered together around the intelligence, phy- sical atoms and mental atoms which make his body and mind.

When this power is absent, the body and mind both go to pieces, broken by every jarring effect coming from what- ever direction. This is the reason hidden under most of the illnesses and weaknesses. Every mistake, failure and every disappointment in life has this reason behind it: the lack of control, the lack of steadiness and strength againstt1 di~turbin'~ influences which come from within and without. The great lesson that12 one learns, which helps most in keeping that tranquillity in life, which helps insight, is to be able to become like ebb and flow. When the first is needed, then to become the13 ebb, when the next thing is needed,14 to make oneself in that way.

Question: To keep tranquillity of mind in presence of an angry person, is deep breathing before answering a he1 p? Answer: One does not need to breathe deeply. When there is distur- bance it shows first in disturbance in rhythm of breath. The one in temper first loses the power over his breath. Therefo're breath is the result, not the cause in this case. What is neces- sary is willpower. Question: What is meant by saying that the will has to become like ebb and flow? Answer: I did not say the will has to become like ebb and flow. I said we have to become like ebb and flow. It is a symbolic expression. A thing that is accomplished at one time by sym- pathy, is accomplished at certain time by indifference. We must meet one situation by taking interest in it and another situation by taking not interest in it, by disinterestness, not- concerning. If the sea always was ebb and not flow, or vice versa, then it would be dead sea. The sea has times of exhaling and inhaling. So in every thing we do we must have power over these two things. There are times you create a good result by saying a word and at times you better say nothing. One must train through life how to meet every situation and one must be able' to meet them all with the manner and action that situation demands. Question: What is the difference between soul and will? Answer: The will is the action of the soul, the soul is the self of the will.

There are two distinct paths opposite to each other, those of the Master and of the Saint. 3The path of the Master is a path of war, war with outer influences which prevent one from making one's way through life.3 The path of the Saint is also a path of battle, but it is a battle with oneself. No doubt in the path of the Master also battle with oneself is necessary, for if one did not fight with oneself one would not be able to make his way through life. But 4the path of the Saint has a constant battle with the self,4 for the nature of the world is such that from the good person more good is asked, from a kind person more kindness is demanded, from a person who is patient more patience is expected, from a person who is gentle more gentle- ness is asked. There is no end to the world's demands, all one gives to the world, and more is asked; and always do right, and, it is always wrong. Therefore there is no end to the battle in both the paths that the wise take, and it is the warrior in life's path who in the end becomes victorious.

The work of the Saint is to console the wretched, to take under the wings of mercy and compassion those left alone in life, to bless the souls that come in their6 way.5 But there is a third line of the wise in which there is a balance of the spirit of the Master and of the Saint. 7~his line is called Kemal, or perfect, or balanced,' and it is on this line that the destiny of the Prophet leads him. For the Prophet's work is more difficult and complicated than that of the Master and of the Saint. To the souls who ask from him that compassion which they would ask from a Saint, he gives it: to those who ask of him that power, that strength which is necessary to be able to stand through the sweeping waves of life, the Prophet gives that. But beside^,^ gthe Prophet is the Message-bearer, the Prophet is thelo master and a servant at the same time, the Prophet is a teacher and at the same time a pupil, for there is a great deal that he must learn from his experience through life, not in order to make himself capable to receive the Message, but in order to make him- self efficient enough to give the Message. For God speaks to the Prophet in His divine tongue, and the Prophet interprets it in his turn in the language of men, making it intelligible to them, trying to put the finest ideas in the gross terms of worldly language. Therefore all ' 'is not given ' ' that the Prophet comes to give to the world1 l in words, but all that cannot be given in words is given without words. It is given through the atmosphere, it is given by the presence, it is given by the great affection12 that gushes forth from his heart, it is given in his kind glance, and it is given in his benediction. And yet the most is given in silence that no earthly sense can perceive. The difference between human language and divine words is this, that a human word is a pebble, it exists, but there is nothing further; the divine word is a living word, just like a grain of corn. One grain of corn is not one grain, in reality it is hundreds and thousands.

Afterwards he goes and stands before the sun and does his Igbreathings every day and performs hislg breathing exercises while adhering2' to the sun.21 That completes the next part of his worship. However primitive this form of worship, at the back of it there seems to be a great meaning. The meaning of the bath in6 Ganges is to become purified before one makes any effort of journeying in22 the spiritual path. The purification of the body and of6 mind, both are first23 necessary before one takes the first step towards6 God ideal. One must not approach24 deity before such purification, the outer purification as well as the inner purifica- tion. For then alone, when once a person is pure, he will find it easy to attain the desired Presence. The meaning of the flowers which he takes, is that God is pleased with the offerings which are delicate, beautiful and fragrant. Delicacy means tenderness of heart, beautiful25 in colour is a26 fineness of character, fra- grant27 is the virtue of the soul. This is the offering with which God is pleased. He stands with a28 thought that his self is devoted in perfect dis- cipline to the Supreme Will of God. His hands folded express no action on the part of himself, but complete surrender. The meaning of prostration is self-denial in the right sense of the word, which means: ' I am not, Thou art.' Whispering the words and ringing the bell is that the same word is rung in the bell of one's heart.

Question: Who gives them their words and breathing e.52? Priests, are they Murshids? Answer: First of all Brahman is a priest by birth. B.~~ is a born priest. Therefore the first lesson he receives is in his own family of the sacred word, but when he takes an esoteric path, at that time he needs the guidance of a Murshid, what the B.~~ calls Guru. And it may be the same word perhaps which he has learned from his parents. Still, when that word is given by your54 Guru, that has a different value again. Perhaps he has repeated that word in his life, but when it is given by the Guru, the value of the word is different. 49. Skosh.: W.\"; Sr.: \"Vaishnava\"; Sk.tp.: \"Vaishnavas\" 50.

Summer School Suresnes, July 17th, 1923 There are three important things to be considered in the development of insight. 3~teady gaze of the eyes and of4 mind, which helps one in pene- tration. Another thing is losing everything else from one's sight except the object 5that one wishes to penetrate through,5 and that comes by sufficient interest in the object of penetration. But the third thing which helps the most is 610sing for the moment6 the thought of one's self. When one's own7 body and mind is not before one, it is then that one has the proper insight into things one wishes to know and understand. Sufis therefore have differ- ent concentrations, by which they are helped not only in keeping their gaze steady, but standing firm upon one thought. When a person cannot take in- terest in any object8 or a9 being, then his mind is not steady, for there is nothing that it 'takes interest in. It is the interest which makes4 mind steady. A certain thought which is inspiring or helping1' in some way, or a certain form which is inspiring when once one has concentrated upon it, then the mind becomes steady also. Then it can easily hold an object before it without wavering. The character of mind is exactly l l as12 the character of l3 the eyes. The eye5 which take in all that comes under their horizon. So the mind jumps from one thing to another, upon all thoughts which may be standing Notes: The lecture \"Insight\" of July 17th. 1923 has become Gatha Kashf - Insight, Series I I I No. 9. 1.

And as it is not always easy to keep the gaze steady, so it is15 with4 mind. To keep mind firm upon one thought, form or image, is not easy. 16~he third thing is morel7 difficult: lethat is to lose oneself in the thought of the object that is before one. In this way the self which stands in the way between the soul and its object of penetration, is lost to1' view for the time being. Thus the person is enabled20 to penetrate through all things, knowing thereby the natureI2l character and secret of all things. There is no other cause of all depression and despair than the inability of seeing through life. There may be many reasons apparently seeming to be the different causes of unhappiness, but this one is the greatest reason, the reason of all reasons. Even animals in whose nature the tendency of fighting is pronounced, become friends22 when they come to know one another by association. Many troubles in4 life of the individual23 and of the multitude may24 be avoided if keen sight was25 developed. For all confusion is caused by misunderstanding. Not only human beings, but all things of this world, which seem of use or of no use, which seem to be easy to use26 or difficult to obtain, all are for the use of man.

Question: Will you please explain what you said yesterday about the two paths, the one who leads to saint- liness and the other28 who leads to mastership? Answer: I had said of the two paths, one of the saint and the other of the aster.^' One is the path of renunciation, abne- gation, resignation, self-denial from the beginning to the end. And by doing this, one arrives to that meeting ground where one touches that divine perfection. And then there is the path of the master. The path of firmness and obstinacy, breaking and penetrating through every difficult situation that comes before.30 And so fighting all along from the beginning to the end. In this he has to fight with himself and with the life out- side. Therefore the struggle is both sides. And there is all the time the work of the willpower, and all through there is a battle and in this battle all the conditions that one has to go through, are of the same character and nature as of the war- fare. To be wounded, and to cause wounds, and to be hurt and to hurt another also. And in this way it is a constant struggle, but still for the higher aim and for the greater gain. In the end he strikes the same note which 3'the saint has struck. Neither the path of the saint is easy, neither32 of the Master. The place where they meet, both become one.

Question: ~u~~osing~~ a person has had for years some interest very near36 his heart, which has developed his power of concentration. And that interest ceases. Is that person more capable of strong concentra- tion on a new interest because of his previous experience? Answer: Yes, certainly. All of our experiences are nothing but prep- aration for something else. Nothing that belongs to this world, however precious, must hinder one's path of. progress. For every step in the direction to that spiritual gain must be the aim of every soul. And the concentration upon the object is just a step. Question: A feeling of deadness seems to come ....... .? Answer: Here is the question of concentration and not of its effect. The question of effect is quite a different subject again. Then the question comes: of what object? Something to steady the mind: it may be a tree, a flower, the sun or a star, of course according to the object, a reaction is produced. And according to the reaction, an object is produced. According to the nature of the object, reaction is produced. Every belief and every experience for a wise person is a step of a staircase; he has taken this step, there is another step for him to take. The steps of the staircase are not made for one to stand there. They are just made for one to pass, to go further. Because life is progress. Where there is no progress, there is no life. One should go on. Death and disappointment, two things, are one. And if there is a hereafter, then the death was a passing stage, and so is dis- appointment.

I Dervishes are those among Sufis who adopt a certain method of pro- gressing through the spiritual path and who try to live a life as much away from the midst of the world as possible. Dervishes are called faqirs and are most powerful in their power of wonderworking, and in the2 power of insight. They are dreamers and lovers of God; they worship God in nature, especially in human nature. Among the3many ways of spiritual development, they have one way which is called sama, which is listening to music. They listen to music in an assembly of initiate^.^ No unititiate5 is allowed to enter their assembly. They address one another, saying: '0 king of kings, 0 Sovereign of all sovereigns' and are mostly clad with the robes of patches or in rags. They never think of a6 tomorrow; their7 thought is only for that moment, to quench the thirst of the moment and to satisfy the hunger of the time. The case of tomorrow they leave to the morrow. It is with just now that they are concerned, if they are at all concerned with life. They are the ones who are really entitled to enjoy the beauty of music, whose spirit and soul is re- spondents with open centres, who make themselves as a medium of reso- nance of the music they hear. Therefore music touches them differently from any other person. Music touches the depthg of their being.

It is therefore that those who do not understand the meaning of their dance, call them howling dervishes or dancing dervishes. The gold of Heaven is dust to the worldly man, and the gold of the earth is as dust to the heavenly man. l4 To both l5 the gold of one another l6 means nothing but dust. Their coins are not interchangeable. Therefore the bliss of the dervish is understood by very few. But something that one can learn from this, is the theory of the whole process of their spiritual develop- ment. By making God their beloved and by seeing God in the sublimity of nature, they create the presence of God. And as the whole day's affair in life constitutes joy and pain both, so the life of the dervish is also filled with joy and pain both, in the presence of God. By the help of concentration, poetry and music, l1joy and pain both are felt more deeply. Therefore to him God becomes living, His Presence before him in all his moods.

Upon any20 object or any person that he may cast his glance, it reveals21 to his soul its22 deepest nature, character and secret, thus 2haking the whole life23 clear to his vision in the light of Cod. Question: What do you mean by joy and pain in the presence of God? Why should there be pain? Answer: If there was no pain, one would not enjoy the experience of joy. It is pain which helps one to experience joy. Everything is distinguished by its opposite. The one who feels pain deeply, is more capable of experiencing joy, and personally, if you were to ask me about pain, I should say, if there was no pain, life would be most uninteresting to me. For it is by the pain that the heart is penetrated and the sensation of the pain is a deeper joy.

Question: You said yesterday: Self-denial in the right sense of the word is: \"I am not, Thou art.\" What is self-denial in the wrong sense of the word? Answer: The right meaning is always one and wrong meanings are many. And among many wrong meanings there is one which is mostly understood by .numberless, that self-denial is to deny oneself of the pleasures and happiness that the world can offer. Question: Not thinking on tomorrow, living in the thought of the moment, is also taught by Christ. But can that be an ideal of a nation whose life must be built upon organization? Answer: The path of spiritual attainment is not to be journeyed by nations. Spiritual progress is individual progress. Every individ- ual his own direction, and therefore the teaching of Christ also in this respect was individualistic. Question: Are the dervishes always in Chishtia School?

Summer School Suresnes, July 19th, 1923 The Message. The Message which has come in all ages and has been called and known by different names, this very Message is now the Sufi Message, and there- fore the work that this Message has to accomplish is not only with a section of the world, but2 the whole humanity. . The Message has two aspects as has been the case in all times, the eso- teric aspect and the exoteric. In the exoteric Message it has all that is nec- essary for that aspect, and yet it can not very well be compared with many other religions, for the reason that we have in our devotional services in the Church of All, the universal worshipt3 a form, and yet the form is taken from the form of all the different religions. We have scriptures, the scriptures of all religions. We adhere to the Teacher, but to the Teachers of all religions, 4and thus4 shows from the democratic aspect that it is the Message of the dayO5 That idea that every other religion has held of holding one's own par- ticular Teacher in high esteem and disregarding the other Teachers, consid- ering one's own scripture the only scripture and the others of no worth. Therefore this form introduced in our services proves by its nature two things, its democratic tone and at the same time it6 being the Message of the time. And as in all times there is need of the esoteric side, that need remains and will always remain. This aspect has been taught in the ancient schools of Sufis; it cannot be different. The only difference is the difference of the form in which it is presented with the consideration of the psychology of the time and the people to whom it is given. In this great work which has been the destiny of our Movement, the only thing that gives me strength, courage and consolation, in spite of diffi- Notes: 1.

And having some few who are sincere in their faith and belief, and standing firm and steady with their Murshid in the strife, to them I would like to speak of our needs and wants. To-day what we greatly need is the field workers in the Cause, those who would be willing to travel if they were needed, and those who cannot travel, that they may work in the place where they are, the workers who will make, I am sure, a phenomena7 owing to their belief in the Message and what it is to bring to humanity. They must remember that no Message, great or small, has been accepted by all and rejected by none. where there is praise there is blame. Neither do we care for praise or d blame, our ears are closed to both, praise and blame. We do not need to think whether it will be a success or not; if so, we do not know what the Message is or Whose it is. We need not let that question enter our minds for one moment, for the success belongs to the One Whose Message it is, Who is the Owner of all success. We are the workers and we must work. During my tour through America I have felt more than ever this great need of field workers. If one thinks he is not capable, he will be incapable and with all good intention not able to help; but the one who has trust and confidence in Murshid will see the reason behind Murshid's suggestions. (Here Murshid told the story of Guru and che~a.)~ The true Teacher is the true pupil and the true pupil the true Teacher. The path of Teachership is from beginning to end pupilship, and the path of the true pupil is all along a Teachership, whose heart becomes reflected by a Teacher, so that all he says,10 does andt1 is what the teacher himself would say and do. And therefore every one of my mureeds, sincere and in12 ear- nest, must know he is the channel of l3 Message, and must await patiently the call and answer it without doubt or hesitation, with courage and with hope. The other need just now is the need of a Temple for the Universal Wor- ship. There is no doubt that one day this will be accomplished, it is even possible that it will be before one can imagine. But now that destiny has made your Murshid settle here in Suresnes, not very far from here, in this vicinity a miniature Temple may be erected, and on such a model, however small, that it may be copied in the different countries. There are many ideas for this question, but when the outline is engraved in our hearts the rest will follow. So I hope all my mureeds, with their devotion and sympathy, will think.of this whenever they can. 7. I bid.: corr. wphenomenon'~ 8. I bid.: \"norw instead of worll 9.

And they are included in all the kingly gran- deurs. And peacock is the bird upon which rode the goddess of music and literature, Saraswati. Also the peacock feathers are used at the tombs of the Sufis by the guardians of the tomb, also by the healers: that by the passes of the peacock feathers, which is the pass of harmony and beauty, the bad influences may be turned4 away. Also in India they use peacock feathers in the necklace of a child and that is a little psychological trick. A child who is susceptible to evil eye, is saved from its severe/serious (I) in- fluence because it is natural that the first glance of a person instead of falling upon the child, will fall upon the peacock feather, because it attracts curiosity of every one. In that way the first severe/serious (?) glance is so to speak shielded by the peacock feather. And the same thing is done by the lion's nails, which are put in the necklace of a little child.

Answer: Conscience is as everything else. 27 If it has been accustomed to handle one's thought, speech or action, the stronger it becomes, if not accustomed, weaker and remains only as a tor- ture and not as a contro~ler.~~ Conscience is faculty of heart as a whole, in it reason, thought, memory and heart.

Answer: The heart in its depth is linked up with the divine mind, there- fore in the depth of the heart there is a greater justice than on surface.29 And therefore there comes a kind of intuition, inspiration, knowledge as that inner light falling upon one's own individual conception of things and both come together then.

How would it be possible to know what to change and what to keep when the conventionality of each person depends upon his environment? There would sure1 y a1 wa ys be people who disagreed in this. Answer: Of course this necessitates the exclusiveness of envi ron- ments. Also this is the cause of divisions of humanity and yet no civilization can avoid it very well, however greatly advanced in its thoughts. The progress will create necessities of such kind. They will not admit it, but they will live it just the same. But I should think that the best way of understand- ing conventionality is the spiritual. Once a person understands the spiritual moral, he does not need to learn the man-made refinement. It will come by itself; as soon as man begins to regard the pleasure and displeasure of Cod in the feeling of every person he meets, he cannot be but most refined, what- ever be the position of his life. He may live in a cottage but ' his manner will surpass the manner of palaces. Another thing, when man has begun to judge his own actions, the fairness will develop in his nature and therefore everything he will do, will be just and fair. He does not need very much the study of outer conventionalities; he naturally will become conventional. And the third thing is that Sufi conception of God as the Be- . loved. When this conception is practised in everyday life and one regarded53 in dealing with everyone that in everyone there is the divine spirit, more or less, one would regard54 everyone with that devotion and respect, with that thought and consideration, which one would give to the Beloved, God. And in these three ways this spiritual life teaches man the very best55 of conventionalities. And if a civilization was built, which no doubt will be built one day, on spiritual basis, the conventionalities of the world will become genuine and worth having. 53.

Answer: Sometimes based on common sense, sometimes on the super sense and sometimes beneath it. Question: How can one make people who were lacking education see a thing that does not exist in their eyes, where they think there is no such a thing as what the aristocratic people feel as necessary for their happiness? Answer: Civilization means a progress. Those who are not educated, they must be educated to understand life better. There are only two things: either go forward or go backward. Either begin to think as everybody else without education thinks, or take the one who is not educated with you and go forward. One thing or 56As the inner inclination is to go forward and to take the one who cannot understand just now 57gently 57that the beautiful things are for the benefit of humanity. I should think that an ordinary man in the street, he is neglected, man turns his back to him. If he was taken closer to oneself, if he was taught with simplicity and good will, not showing that he was ignorant of beauty or culture, but showing him that in this is his real benefit, I am sure that the conditions, as bad as they are now, will not be and there will be a better understanding between the classes as they are just now. I will tell you a little example. When travelling in India, I was staying in a place near a Hindu temple and there were two porters who took care of that temple. They were of Afghanis- tan, proud and stiff, rough and rigid in their manner and yet in their expression there was honesty and goodness. 58 I passed through that way, I saw them ignoring so to speak my entering and going out, lest they may have the trouble of ob- serving any conventionalities.

In order to know the secret of life, one must understand the law of creation, the law of sustenance and the law of destruction. We must understand that destruction awaits every created thing and to save it from destruction there wastg one mystery to be solved and that is the mystery of sustenance. What happens is this:20 that2' every activity which is directed toz2 a certain result, owing to one's anxiety and eagerness, one draws that result closer before the time; and in this way very often man brings about that destruction which 23he knew that it can be helped,24 he can put it25 off to a later time.

For him the sugar is a poison. If he took the poison once, the same would become sugar for him. All things that one thinks that they are foreign to his nature, by this he makes his nature exclusive. And by becoming exclusive, he makes himself subject to them in a way. There comes a time when they rule him, a situation when he is under them. A person who says: 'bitter quinine, it is too bitter, I cannot stand it'; he is in fever, the doctor says he must have it. He dreads having it. At the same time he cannot help it. Therefore the way of the Shiva was always to work against one's weaknesses. He counted them as weaknesses, not as nature. Nature, all is my nature, but what I cannot have, that I make it foreign from my nature. If I have separated it, there comes a time perhaps that I become so weak that I cannot help having it. Would you believe that the snake charmers, I have found some of them, who have gradually by 52the snake52 that when they go, they just catch the snake in their hand.

Question: Is it perhaps God's way of making us immune to sorrow, when He sends us troubles and difficul- ties? Answer: Every way is Cod's way. When He sends us troubles and difficulties, that is Cod's way; neither there is the law of Cod to send only 60s. and t.P0 neither to send us only 61. But if we are thankful and see the hand of Cod in all, we would cer- tainly be 62grateful 62 and even after a sorrowF2 and to see in both the way of Cod. Very often there are people more impressed by the doctrine of karma, who say that if illness has come, 'Well, now it is our karma that we have to pay the due. Then we must take it patiently.' I think there is a virtue in it also63 to see that it is from karma. But it is not sufficient. We must know that hap- piness is our birthright. In our happiness there is the happiness of Cod. In our sorrow there is not the pleasure of Cod. There- fore we must do everything in our power to get out of that ill- ness instead of thinking that the karma had thrown that ill- ness, and we mud4 lie patiently65 like a rock over us and not try to push it off, because it is karma.

And although there are many societies and in- stitutions which are established and working along this line of Brotherhood, yet our contribution to this great service of God and humanity has its pecu- liarity owing to its ideas being based on spiritual ideals. We believe that the brotherhood brought about by coming to an understanding of exchanging the good of one another in the interest of one another is not sufficient. The reason is that the nature of life is changeable; where there is a day there is a night, and there is light and darkness and therefore the interest in life is not always even. If two persons are friends to6 one another and they make a condition that we shall be friends and we shall love one another, if each wishes to regard justice,' they will quarrel a thousand times a day. Because who is to be the judge? When two people quarrel both are just, both think they are on8 the right. And a third person has no right to interfere. There- fore brotherhood cannot be brought about 9to satisfactory resultsg only by teaching the law of reciprocity based upon selfinterest. Because even if they said: ' I will give you a pound in gold and you will give me in return a poundlo', and the exchange is made, there is a dispute.

No, the brotherhood from13 spiritual point of view that may be learned, is the brotherhood of rivalry 14in goodness, in kindness.I4 It is not weighing: what good have theyi5 done to me, but it is trying to do more for another and not thinking what he will do for me. The ideas of the Sufis in all times have been different from16 the man in the world and yet not too different for a man to practise. The Sufi ideas are that when one does an act of kindness to another, it is because he wishes to do it. Because the action itself is his satisfaction, not17 a return even in the form of appreciation. Any form of appreciation or any return he thinks consumes, takes away that act of goodness or kindness that one has done. And when one thinks that one does some good expecting that another must return it, then it is a business. And a person who thinks thatt8 perhaps I shall do twice more good to another from whom I received half fromlg the good I do for him, he is in a very bad situation, for sooner or later he will be disappointed because he shares goodness which cannot be shared in this way. As soon as man begins to think that20 'has another person treated me like a brother, why should I treat him as a brother', he does not know what brotherhood is, he will never be able to act as a brother. The Sufi point of view is that man must be concerned with himself, if he does right that is what he is concerned with and not whether another person takes it rightO2l The trouble of22 Brotherhood at this time when humanity is so vastly divided, seems so very difficult to bring in23 practice. And yet I do not think if we saw the idea of brotherhood in this light, that it would seem very dif- ficult.

A feeling gwhich one feels9 in himself lo of wanting something to make up one's ideal, llgives that feeling which one calls shame; or when one sees in another person something wanting, it is that which brings to one's mind that sense of want12, and one expresses that sense by the word shame.

The springing of this sense in a child is worth noticing andi8 is of a19 very great interest to a seer. But when one sees it20 from a spiritual point of view it opens up21 a very vast field of thought 21before one2I. One learns by thinking about this sense of wanting that l3 human soul by nature is perfect and22 the life of limitation on earth is imperfection. Therefore the soul continually sees wanting23 in itself and24 want in others and becomes unhappy over it. The soul who sees the want in others becomes unhappy over others. Therefore there will be no end to the unhappiness of that soul, for there will always be the want in this life of limitation. But the soul who sees the want in oneself, no doubt has a chance to gain all that whichz5 is wanting, although the more a soul will advance26, the more it will find in itself wantingz7. It is therefore that28 the nobler is29 the the more sense of shame it has, for that sense is wakened30 in it. And the lack of the7 nobleness31 of spirit is significant of32 the lack of that sense. There is one person who33 fights against that34 sense, which in time becomes blunted; and he might feel happier for the moment, having had that sense in him so blunted. However, the limitation will be35 there. The sense of shame is a channel which leads to that goal which is called perfection, but no doubt the more it is wakened30, the more one is subject to unhappiness, and yet true happiness is in the realization of perfection. And therefore in the end he does not lose much in spite of the apparent gain3' that comes37 to the one who is shameless. In the7 practical life in the midst of the world the shameless38 has apparently more ease of 39movement and action39. The one who has the sense of shame awakened, for him life is difficult.

The Word Shame' of July 23rd, 1923, but given on another occasion. Question: False accusation fills a child with a sense of shame, though there is no justification. Answer : Anything wrongly suggested has always a wrong result. Some- times a person carries a sense of shame too far, but it has its own value when it is used rightly.2 Often people have done great things, beyond their ordinary power, lbecause taken hold of l by their sense of shame. They get such a desire to amend that they are awakened from a sense of death, they make su- perhuman efforts and they live again. Repentance is the outcome of shame. When the sense becomes more living, the person feels lack himself and so he respects the lack in others. So what he does is to cover the lack of another instead of exposing it by criti- cism. When he develops further he sees other persons fa++ates exposing their own lacking. So the pain of the wise and of the saintly souls, they feel for others as themselves. They feel it like a knife; spiritual life means to feel the life of another as one feels one's own life. It looks so cruel on the part of man in exposing the lack of another. It may satisfy his vanity or bring him a moment's pleasure, but from the spiritual point of view it looks very cruel. One can overcome this by feeling the oneness of life, the same life in him and in me, so his pain, his sorrow, his pleasure I share, because his life is my life. *So one cannot but be sympathetic all in life, have more or less love, but the difficulty is they do not know how to use it to their best advantage.2 Notes: The first q.a. of the \"Question and Answer Class'l given on August 15th, 1923, refers to the lecture \"Tasawwuf.

The existence of God is a question which rises3 in every mind, either4 in the mind of the believer in God or5 in the mind of the unbeliever. hd6 there are moments when the greatest believer in God questions His exis- tence, whether there really7 is a God. He finds it at the second thought 8a notion such as that as sacrilege8 and he tries to get rid of it.

This craving of attaining15 something which is unattainable gives the soul a longing to reach life's utmost heights. It is the nature of l2 soul to try and discover what is behind the veil. It is the soul's constant longing to climb such heights, which is16 beyond his17 power. It is the desire of soul to see something whichl8 it has never seen. It is the constant longing of the soul to know someone it has never known. But the most wonderful thing about it1' that the soul already2' knows to some extent21 that there is something behind this veil, the veil of perplex- ity; that there is something to be sought22 in the highest spheres of life, that there is some beauty to be seen, that there is someone to be known who is knowable. This desire, this longing is not acquired; this desire is a dim knowledge of the soul, which it has in itself. Therefore tmbe+ief disbe- lief in12 God ideal is nothing but a condition which is brought about by the vapours 22arising from the material life of illusion and covering as clouds the light of the soul which is its life. It is therefore that the unbeliever is not satisfied with his disbelief23. Yes, sometime his vanity is fed by it to think that he is wiser24 in not believing in someone whose existence is believed25 by numberless blind be~ievers~~. So he begins to think that after all to believe in God is not a difficult thing. Any simpleton can reallyz7 believe in l2 God ideal. He takes therefore the opposite direction, of refus- ing to believe. He is honest, 28yet he is29 someone who stands before a wall which hinders his path to progress. If this world offered30 to one person all it possesses, even then the soul will not be satisfied, because its satisfaction is in its higher aspiration.

When we can compre- hend the idea' of another also, then there is the balance. Question: The God-denying people, are they always far away from the goal? Answer: It depends upon their consciousness. 67 Most of them will find as a kind of wall which gives them the idea of limitation, which gives them the idea that there is nothing further. heir^^ horizon will always give them a kind of discomfort. Just like a bird in a cage. He does not know that there is anything else; it is all closed up. I cannot say about all those who are unbelievers, because we often misjudge people. They may have a better belief than . One cannot judge it. Question: What faculty is most helpful in the progress towards God realization? Is it the imagination? Answer: I should say aspiration. Aspiration cannot be considered as one of the faculties. It is behind all faculties. Therefore it is the soul of all the faculties. Aspiration is the chief thing. But my experience with great many people whom I have seen in the world, has brought me to acknowledge69 70 sometimes what happens? A very fine soul, whose tendency is to aspire 64.

Very often it has happened. The person is not ready to accept the existence72 of Cod at once, but at the same time he is desirous to find something. The desire is there just the same. There is a story of a scientist, who was a great unbeliever in God. All his life he has been in this and the wife's only sorrow was that the husband did not believe in Cod. There came a time in his later part of life when he began to call her near him in his time of pain and suffering, and in answer to her re- grets he would say: 'I share in your belief because you believe.

Very often the parents say something to their child in which there is a53 voice of God. Very often a kind friend suggests something to his friend out of his love and sympathy which happens to be a Message of God. Sometimes a teacher says an inspiring word which is as a word coming directly54 from Cod. Even from an innocent child a word comes which comes as a warning from God. For all faces are His faces and from all lips it is His word that comes, whenever it comes. But those who can respond to Him, they become as His appointed servants. People call them Chosen Ones.

Answer : 77 this I will make a lecture itself and therefore I will be giving that lecture as a complete idea. Question: 78 Answer: The rhythm of every individual body changes in one hour; there are five elements which change. A person changes through five elements and every such change changes his mood. Therefore in an hour's time a person may be hot and cold, and calm and excited, and everything. And if a person tends to show his changes, he is a79 moment in a spell of goodness, next 80. Therefore a self-controlled person controls all. One cannot help going through these five ele- ments every hour. Every element has its influence upon a person. Question: Is it true that the moon, because it is a dead body, has a vampirising influence upon man? Answer : It is not dead. It is living at the lifeB1 of the sun, so its life is greater. And vampirising--you may call it vampirising effect. Really speaking it is magnetic effect. Its magnetism is more beautiful and greater because it is soft. The sun attracts, but its currents repel one. The soft currents of the moon have a soothing power. Therefore one is more attracted to the moon than the sun. The sun has a much greater attraction but the power of the sun is too great sometimes for a person to stand. The power of the moon is soft.

Does he mean there is nothing which creates this world, or what else? That God is not living in His creation? Answer: Well, what generally one sees: every intellectual person sees the cause and effect. And as far as the mind reaches, it takes one to see that he goes to the atoms, electrons, and ra- diance, and in the end he comes to the movement. Now a ma- terialistic person says the movement is the cause; from the movement the matter has come. In the matter he includes what he calls atoms or electrons. But he thinks that behind it all it is the movement, and a perpetual movement which gives a force to everything to come up. From one thing another thing comes, and in this way the consciousness of man is the outcome of matter. He thinks that the matter, as it evolves, the process of evolution continues, and a kind of consciousness is produced: after the tree the animal, after the animal the human, always greater and greater.

One was the idea of the wise to make every kind of power and attribute in a4 form of deity and to call it a certain god. It was done in order to give the ordi- nary mind the most needed thought that Cod is in everything and that 5 Cod is all power. Many afterwards have6 misunderstood the idea and the wisdom behind it became obscure'. Therefore some wise men had to fight against the ideas of the other wise men and8 yet they did not fight with the idea. They have9 fought with the misconception of it. But now, at the present time, that 10 there exists no such idea in Europe of many gods, llmany have lost their faith after the recent war, saying: 'if Cod is all goodness, all jus- tice and all powerful 12, why 13 such a dreadful thing as war has 13 have 14 allowed to take place?'

The mystics20 of all ages have therefore given Cod many names. The Sufi Schools of esotericism have possessed these21 different Names of Cod with their nature and secret, and have used them in different meditations along the path of spiritual attainment. Therefore22 Sufis have not many gods, but many Names of Cod, each expressive of23 certain attribute.24 Suppose if25 these Names which the Sufis have used were not the Names of God, if they had only held in thought words such as mercy, compassion, pa- tience, it would have been a merit, not a person. Merit is not creative and merit is only something which is possessed. Therefore attribute26 is not important. The important one is the possessor of the attribute. Therefore instead of thinking of success, the Sufi calls upon the Cod of success. For him the Cod of success is not a different Cod--27the One and Only God27-- but only by calling28 that Name of Cod which is expressive of success, he attaches his soul to that perfect Spirit of success. The other source 2sfrom where29 the idea of many gods has come, is the deep thinkers and philoso- phers who have seen Cod in every soul and every soul making a god of its own according to its stage of evolution. Therefore there is a saying among the Hindus: 'There are as many gods as30 are the31 strains of music', in other words, there are numerous imaginations and numberless gods.

Wali is the initiate whose will has come close to the Divine Will and he shows it by3 the harmony which reigns in his own life, harmony with the4 friends and he himself is5 in harmony with the adversary also. He shows harmony with the changing weather and its different influences and6 in har- mony with all he eats and drinks, he is in harmony with the place he lives and moves about7, and he harmonizes with all atmosphere8 and so his will becomes the Will of God, in other words, the Will of God becomes his will.' He does that work for which he is appointed, mostly in an unknown way. The greater a person is 10spiritually advancedlO, the less assuming he becomes and1 avoids every show of piety or spirituality. Ghous is the next grade of the initiate.12 The influence of the ghous is wider. He gives up his personality fully13 to the Divine Guidance.

It may be, one person goes as far as the wali, another goes as far as the qutub, that are the grades of the servers5', not of the perfection. Perfection is something from which God has not deprived of58 any soul unless that soul de- prives himself of that perfection. God does not deprive any soul of it. Question: How does one reccrgnize the different grades of in- itiates, the different Masters? Answer: This is a question which is difficult to answer and by giving an example it will not be difficult. If a person wants to know the difference between Handel, Bach, Wagner, Beetho- ven, he must study them, play their music, become one with their composition. When his soul is charged with that, it will be easy for him to find it out, because he has become the in- strument to find59 out. But no third person can say that Bach is greater than Beethoven. No doubt the initiates they know it themselves and they know one another also. They do not need to speak in order to know another. They know one another by the meeting of their glance.

He was an initiate. He was a preacher and thousands of people were impressed by every word he said. His word was a living word, and we passed through the district of the poor where among some ragged people who were sitting in the street and laughing and chat- ting, there was one person sitting there among them, no outer form of piety or spirituality or learning or anything--one among all the others in rags. And this one who was sitting in the carriage, he at once noted63, greeted him gently and called out in the terms of the mystic, asking for a word of help, in other words, for benediction. I turned at him, I saw it also. This man said to me: 'Don't you see the king in his eyes? ' The glance proved it. And if I were to tell you a little further: What is the reason? What is it of a wonderful character there? The souls of all are one, from the same source, but a soul which becomes unveiled shines out, its whole character and nature become different, that there is nothing that stands before it.64 If the clouds stand before it, it will break it, it will shine out by itself. The clouds for the time may cover the sun, but the nature of the sun is to break it. The light and the love which come from such souls spontaneously 65 . You do not recognize such person by his learning, argument or by his claim. The recognition is the love and light; all that is divine is love and light, and that is living. You do not need proof for it; it is the only thing living; all else is dead in com- par ison. Question: Are there always66 wali, ghous and qutub in the differ- ent parts of the earth? Answer: Yes, certainly there are, if our eyes were open to see them and to recognize them. There is no part of the earth whether East or West where real souls are not to be found. 60.

Therefore it is difficult to find and say which is which, unless our heart is open to find them. Because the thing is that the very thing which makes a person claim or be known or seen, which is the false ego, it is the very thing which is not there. The more spiritual the less egoistic; if there is any sign of spir- ituality, the more dead is the false ego, the greater is the soul. That is why Christ has said: 'Blessed are the poor in spirit,' whose false ego has been so crushed and mashed that nothing is left except God. What they do 67as67 existent is67 God alone, they do not exist. They are quite different from our everyday attitude: 'that person insulted me, I cannot for- give all my life.' They are ready to forgive a thousand times. Without asking they forgive, for goodness is theirs; there is no bitterness there. There is no desire for revenge there, there is no desire for benefit there. They cannot stand the harm and hurt to another person, even the worst person in the world. It is not their pleasure to see anyone suffer, even the worst person. They have the love of the mother and father towards the children; so their love is for the whole humanity and it68 can even reach that perfection where they love every little insect and worm, that their love goes out to the trees and plants. They do not care what people call them, wali, ghous or qutub, that does not increase their honour. It is no pride to them to be anything. The false ego is dead. Only one thing they know and that is God. And if there is such an initi- ation, it is put on them in order to make use of them. Their only desire is the consciousness of God, that is sufficient for them. Question: What did you mean by real soul? Answer: 'Real' I said in this way: there is a real gold and imita- tion gold. Gilt will turn out to be not the same. But the real will prove in the end to be real, as we say 'the real friend.' A person may be a friend one day and turn out different next time. Just think how man has always loved real, although man lives in the midst of the world and has to meet with falseness. Yet he has that innate love of reality. Even in a false thing, as earthly treasure, he seeks for the real gold. He is not satisfied with the gilt. If one becomes conscious of the reality which is in oneself, one does not need to strive for anything else in life. If once a person has got hold of the real, he needs noth- ing else, for that is the seeking of every soul. 67.

This question can be answered that though the seed does not show the flower in it, though5 the seed culminates into6 a flower and there- fore the flower has already existed in the seed.

The proper expression for Cod is 'the Only Being.' The God Ideal is so enormous that man can never comprehend it fully and14 therefore the best method15 the wise have adopted is to allow every man to make his own God.

Man is not capable of picturing Cod36 other than a person, a person with best qualities, the ideal person. lt38 does not mean that all that is ugly and evil does not belong to the universe of Cod or, in other words, is not in Cod Himself. But the water of the ocean is ever pure in spite of all3' things that may be thrown into it. The pure40 consumes all impurity41 and turns them all into purity. Evil and ugliness is42 to man's limited conception; in Cod's great Being these have no existence. Therefore he is not wrong who makes Cod ,in his imagination43 Cod of all beauty, free from ugliness, 43~od of best qualities, free from all evil. For by that imagination he is drawn nearer and nearer every moment of his life to that divine ideal which is 45the seeking of his And once he has touched divine per- fection in it he will find the fulfilment of his life. Question: What do you mean by \"God has no opposite\"? Answer: There is the sun and there is the moon. There is man and woman. There is night and day. The colours are distinguished by their variety and so are the forms. Therefore to distinguish anything there must be the opposite to distinguish46. When there is no opposite you can not distinguish. There must be health to distinguish illness. If there was no health and only illness, then it would not have been illness. Furthermore many have tried in the ancient times to help the imagination of the Cod-seekers by giving them a belief of a Satan: that Cod is all goodness and the Satan all badness.

In reality God has no comparison. No doubt God can have a comparison if we make5', as many do, 'good'.

But wali is not a grade of spirituality alone. Wali is a special service and a servant cer- tainly knows for what work he is appointed. If he was unaware of it, he can53 not perform his duties.

One day I was very struck by seeing:66 a girl was working in a factory, a girl who was not educated but she had a great feel- ing for Jesus Christ. Her love and devotion for the Master was the only thing that she lived for. She had not read philosophy or anything. And the manager of that factory whose thought has been saturated with many different ideas, he had recently read one book which said that Jesus the Christ is an ideal, not a man of history, that he never existed. He, being so enthusi- astic, he wanted to talk about that philosophical idea to some- one and he happened to come to this girl, who was simply working in the factory, with her devotion. And the listening to that idea shocked this6' girl so much that she cried for days together, thinking that her whole religion was broken, that there was nothing for her to live for, for68 here and in the hereafter, that it was all broken. So a friend of hed9 seeing her so unhappy brought her to me and she came with the same thought that somebody had told her. And when I told her dif- ferently, then there was no end to her happiness. Her heart was again full with something that was lost. It was just like the soul that was lost and came again to her. Her belief came again to her.

Beside l6 all the prophets have taught, it is l7 the personality of the prophets which proved their prophetship 19. In their thought, speech and work20 they reflected God, which was more than morals, doctrines and teachings could do. Every inspired person reflects in his own way some divine spark, hidden in his soul, which wins the world. A musician may show the21 inspiration in music, a poet may show it in his poetry and22 artist may show his inspiration in his art, but the central ray of light which the prophets reflect, falling upon every plane and every aspect of life, makesz3 all things clear to their sight. Therefore their pres- ence clears away perplexity from the minds of the confused ones. A person in the presence of aZ4 prophet can feel and think more clearly even without having spoken to a25 prophet. Many forget theirz6 questions27 before a prophet, for the light falling upon their heartz8 brings beforez9 them the answer and they find out that the answer was in themselves--something that they have already known. No doubt it is true that the question and answer both are in the soul. The first step of the soul's progress raises questions and the second step is the answer. It is therefore that a pro- phetic30 soul is a physician at the same time. A prophetic soul is a scientist, is an artist, is capable of commerce, industryI3l business, qualified in war- fare and competent in peacemaking. 33he Spirit of Guidance is like33 a searchlight.

When it is received from without, that is the first step. Next step is to receive directly. All those who begin to receive the inspira- tion, they first receive from the outer life. he^^ man is cre- ated so that the first he looks is outside, then he turns within, when he is disappointed, when he cannot find all that he wants to find in the outer life. He turns within to see if he can find something which he is seeking and something which he cannot 54 find in the outer life.

Question: Why should God wish to realize His own prfection? Answer: For it is His nature. If it is an artist, his wish is to bring out the best that is in him. If a musician, the same idea; there is his satisfaction. In every soul there is that longing of bring- ing out to culmination what is waiting there. And the moment it has realized the culmination of that, there comes that fulfil- ment of the purpose of that soul's birth on the earth. As is the nature of the creatures, so is the nature of the Creator. His satisfaction is also in the realization of His own perfection. It is towards that end that all this universe was created, that by going through all that process in the end He may realize the perfection wherein is the fulfilment of His own desire. All that is in our nature, is in the nature of God. Only the difference is:4' we are limited, God is unlimited. Question: Is God evolving through us?

This is a question which is always asked: How the prophetic soul 5receives the ~essa~e~ of God, in what form. Does the angel Gabriel bring this6, as7 said in the school8 of Ben lsraelg? Does it come as a voice? Does it come in thelo form which is visible? And the answer is that everythingl1 said in the ancient Scriptures regarding it, has so much truth in it, though very often some symbolical ideas are misinterpreted by the uninitiated. Gabriel ''is a Messenger of l2 imagination. The real Gabriel is that Spirit of Guidance which is the soul of the prophets. Its voice is intuition. But to the attentive mind of the prophet sometimes this voice is so distinct that it becomes much louder than what one hears through the ears. For in their hearts a capacity is produced, in other words, their hearts become as domes, which give echo to13 every word. The heart of the ordinary person does not give that echo.

There is nothing in this world which is void of form except Cod, Who is formless. The form of some things is visible and of other things invisible. Even thoughtlg and feelings have forms20. You may call them as their2' results, but form is always a result. The heart which can hear the inner voice louder than the spoken word22, can certainly see the form, even23 the form which is not seen by every soul. The question if24 the eyes of the prophets25 see a form, may be answered: yes. For what the heart sees fully, that26 becomes reflected in the eyes also. It is not seen from without, but from within, and yet it is seen. Every person cannot conceive of 27an idea such27 as this28, who is only2' accustomed to see and hear all that comes from outside30.

That limited ideal becomes as an instrument, as a medium of Cod, Who is perfect and Who is limitless. Question: Is the form in which Gabriel is, seen by the mind of the prophet and is4' general? Answer: Yes, it is made by the mind of the prophet. Yes, also in general, because every power and condition has also a form. Therefore inspirational and intuitional power has also a form. Every illumination has its own form. There is nothing without a form. Question: Are the forms man sees sometimes made by their own minds? Answer: Not always, but often. Question: The world we see has no reality, it is an illusion. But why do we see that illusion; what is the cause of this which torments us? Answer: The word illusion is used by the wise for the convenience, and the truth of this word is only realized when the reality of life is compared after the innermost life or the eternal life is realized. But when you compare it, then it seems an illusion because illusion is something which appears to be something, but in the end disappoints. And so is the nature of things which are subject to change and destruction. For they exist and they do not exist. Their existence is momentary. But the effect produced by them upon our soul is to a certain extent intoxicating, that we are so hypnotized by all things that we see that we forget for that4' moment that it is momentary. We see the reality of it.

And when there is a series of such inspi- rations coming time after time, then it is named Gabriel, the Angel of God. 1. Sr.: added \"Will you explain more about\" 2.

Very often to our limited view things in the world appear unjust and often it seems that there is man's law: what he wishes he does, if he has72 power to do it. But behind this illusive73 appearance there cer- tainly is a strict justice and a real law. No sooner the heart becomes74 living 75and that law has manife~ted~~. One cannot but marvel at life and nature to see that76 how great is the Justice of God that 77it is78 with the right hand and take(n~~~ with the left, all you give and80 all you take. And no soul has to wait for days or weeks or years or for thes1 death to come for the law to manifest. Every day is a Judgement Day and every hour is the Hour of Justice. A criminal will escape82 the prison bars but83 cannot go from under the sky. There is the judge within and without. When his eyes are closed he is being judged within, when they are open he is being judged without. We are always in a Court of Justice. If we do not realize it, it is because we are intoxicated by life and we become like a drunken man in the Court who does not see84 the judge nor85 justice. But what we can marvel most86 in life is to know that in spite of His great jus- tice God is87,88 Forgiver. He forgives even more than He judges. For justice comes from His intelligence but forgiveness comes from His divine Love. When His divine Love rises as a wave, it washes away the sin89 of a whole life in a moment.

Question: \"God forgives even more than He judges.\" How do we know that God forgives? Answer: In the first place, justice is born and love has never been born, it always has been and will be. Justice is born of what? It is born of the sense of fairness2, and there is a sense in man, and as this sense becomes matured, it3 begins to seek for the4 evenness. What is not even, it5 does not like.6 7~ut all must exist first to inspire this sense to deve~op.~ Justice is the out- come of what we see, not love; love is spontaneous, it is always there. As in Bible, God is love. And therefore justice is God's nature, but love is God's very being. And therefore He forgives, because He is forgiveness Himself. He judges because it is His nature to judge. Question: Justice comes from God's intelligence and forgive- ness from His divine 1 ove? Answer: God's intelligence in this world of illusion has limited expression, because when you judge limited things, your intel- ligence becomes limited also. One is as limited as the object before one. The greater the object, the greater becomes the vision. But forgiveness does not judge, it only is the feeling of love.

Justice has not that joy. The one who judges too much is himself unhappy and makes the one whom he judges unhappy also. The one who forgives is happy, he does not keep any grudge in his heart.

No doubt it helps to express the spiritual Message which their l5 heart l6 receives, in a more in- telligible form possible 17. We see in the worldi8 Scriptures four different forms in which the prophetic Message was given. The ancient Hinduistic l9 form, which can be traced in the Scriptures of India, and which was contin- ued by Buddha. The other form of the 20children of 20 Ben Israel which is to be found in the Old Testament from the time of Abraham to the time of ~ahommed~. The third form is the form of Zoroaster 2i, which shows in it 22 two aspects: its 23 one aspect is the gayatri 24 of 25 Hindus and another 26 aspect is the prayer of the2' Ben Israel. And the fourth form is the form of the New Testament, which gives the legend and interpretation of the teach- ing of Jesus Christ and which was made at every new version more intelligi- ble to the mind of the people in the West. But the moment a soul dives deeper into these Scriptures, he28 begins to realize2' one voice within all these outer forms and30 the same voice which 31 has adopted these different forms to answer the need of every age. What the prophet says is much less than what really32 he hears and the sense in33 what he says is much deeper than what his outer words mean. For the work of the prophet is a most difficult one. It is trying to present to the world the whole34 ocean in a bottle. No one has ever been able to do it; yet they have all tried, for that has been their destiny.

But by what the prophets have taught in the Scriptures, they have only tried to point out the way, but they have not pictured the goal. For no one can put the goal into a pitcher38. The goal is above all form39 and beyond the power of the40 words to be explained4'. Those who have benefited by the life and the Mes- sage of the divine Message bearers, are not necessarily the followers of their Message, but the imitators of their life. For they have not followed the teaching only but followed the Teacher, who is the living42 example of his teaching. All the ancient traditions of 43 religious evolution tell us how those around the prophets have benefited by the imitation rather than by following the strict laws and by arguing upon the difference^^^ between the laws. There is no Scripture in which contradiction does not exist. It is the contradiction which makes the music of the Message. The Message +theat would be rigid like pebbles if there was45 no contradiction. Even all pebbles are not alike; how 46all words should46 mean the same? The Message is nothing but an answer to every condition4! every question, every need and desire48 of the individual life49 and of 50 collective life.

I remember an amusing instance. Once I had been for a relative to the house of a Physician, an Indian Physician, whose method has been of the most ancient kind: to write prescription(s) which took him about five or ten minutes. In a small room where fifteen or twenty persons were al- ready sitting, among them I went and sat also. He came to write prescrip- tions for everyone who came. And when those who were before me went finally, then he began to write prescriptions for those who came after. Having thought that Physician as friend of family, should have seen me per- haps before the others. And so went on until he had seen everyone (I was last person) and then said: 'Now tell me what you have to say'. I two hours he had been writing out prescriptions, was at ease, quiet, and when I was going away he said: 'I hope you understood that I did not want to see you when the other people would still stay. I wanted to see you at leisure.' It was a favour which had tried all my patience. But still a majestic sort of favour. This gave me a very good example of love in the form of indifference. Note: 1.

It is above division and therefore it is the soul which really can be called an35 individual. Very often the lo philosophers have used this name for the body, mind and consciousness, 36all three. Sufism originally comes from the word safi, which means purity. This purity is attained by purifying the soul from all foreign attributes that it has acquired, thereby discovering the 37 real nature and character 380f the Pure water means something which is in its original element 39and no sugar or milk mixed with it 39. If it happens that there is sugar and milk in the water, then the one who wishes to analyse 40n41it must separate them40 and will try to see42 water in its pure condition. Sufism therefore is the analysing of the self, 31self which has for the43 moment become a mix- ture of three44 things, of body, mind and soul. By separating the two45 outer garments of the soul, the Sufi discovers the real nature and character of the soul, and in this discovery lies the secret of the whole life. Rumi has said in the Masnavi that life on the46 earth is a captivity of the soul. When one looks at the 47air being47 caught by the water, one sees the meaning of ~umi~~, that something which is free to move about, becomes captive by the atoms of water for a time and loses its freedom for that moment.

It is this which the sufis17 call the process of unlearning, which purifies orl8 makeslg intelligence free from knowledge.

When one sees this law and finds out its secret, one admits the truth of both the opposite doctrines, fate and free will. There is such a thing as fate and there is such a .thing as free will; sometimes they clash and sometimes they work harmoniously, and sometimes one overpowers the other. Every nation has its destiny, every race has its life designed, every individual and every Message that has ever come to humanity. The prophets have brought the divine Message from time to time. It took so many years for them to deliver it to the world; so many years for it to spread after those who brought it have6 passed. So many years it took for the people to practise it and to get the benefit out of it. And many more ,years it took for the same to become corrupted, which has always caused the declination7 of religions. No doubt that ended the8 cycle, and a new cycle began with the same process all over again. History repeats itself, and the wonderful thing in this that is to be noticed is that no sooner was Cod's Message declared, than even the nearest and dearest friends of the deliverer of that Message became his worst enemies.

For it has often happened that, adversaries apart, friends with their goodwill and devotion may cause difficulties in the furtherance of the Cause, only by lack of prudence. Therefore, besides enthusiasm and willing- ness to work in the Cause, it is necessary that a wider outlook must be de- veloped; and there is one way of developing it and that is by forgetting the self. There is only one condition for becoming the real server and that is to forget the self, for it is the thought of the self which blocks one's own path and the way of that Movement the fulfilment of which will be a blessing forlo humanity. Besides this, the deeper we think, the more we shall realize that every moment of our life, especially in the work of the World Cause, is beyond price, and every next moment that follows, becomes more valuable. Once this is realised, we shall not say that 'I will do to-morrow what can be done to-day', and we shall not say: 'I will not do it for there are many others who can', but we shall consider it our greatest privilege in life to use our life and effort to its best advantage in the service of Cod and humanity. 10.

His feet on the earth and5 head in6 Heaven, he has to journey in7 the path of life, 8to respect and regard theg reason, and yet to cling to that rope which hangs down from Heaven, which he calls faith: one thing contrary to the other.

In the Sufi terms there is a word12: akhlak Allah, which means the manner of Cod. This manner is seen in the prophetic soul, for no one knows the manner of Cod, as God is not seen by all and if there is any sign of Cod seen, it is in the Cod-consci~us~~.

The best way of following a prophetic Message, which has been known to very few, is to adopt the outlook of the prophet, for the point of view of every person one can fully understand by seeing it7' from that person's point of view. Question: 72 Answer: By adopting the outlook of the prophet, is by following the way how he looks at things, by trying to understand, that73 one reaches the ideal of the prophet sooner than by any other method. But this.can be seen even with everyday affairs, when two people differ in their thought. It means that each one of them stands in their omopinion and they have a certain point of view. And the one who is more pliable, he is able to adopt the other person's point of view. Then his knowledge becomes more perfect, because he knows already from his point of view and is 74 If the follower of the prophet is able to look the prophet's point of view, then he has risen where he can understand the Message. But I think not only in the case of the prophet one should try, but in every case, with every person. Life would become much more harmonious if one tr.ied with every person one meets. One always sees from one point of view, one cannot help. By seeing from another point of view, one does not lose, because one sees already from one's own point of view.

All disap- pointments which are the natural outcome of this life of illusion, disappear when once a person lias touched the God ideal, for what one seeks14 in life, one finds that8 in God. Now the question is that15 all beauty, goodness and greatness, how- ever small and limited, can be found on the earth, but where can the same be found in3 perfection 16which is16 called God? This may be answered that 'what is first necessary is the belief that there is some17 such a Being as Cod in Whom allla goodness, beauty and greatness is19 perfect.' In the beginning it will seem nothing but a belief, but in time, if the belief was2' kept in sincerity and faith, that belief will become like the egg of the phoe- nix, out of which the magic bird is born. It is the birth of Cod which is the birth of the soul. Every soul seeks for happiness, and after running after all2' objects that22, for the moment, 23seem to be the source23, 24seem to be happiness-giving24, finds out that nowhere is25 perfect happiness except in God. This happiness cannot come by merely believing in God; believing is a process; by this process the Cod within is wakened26 and made living..lt is the living of God which gives happiness. When one sees the injustice, the falsehood, the unfriendliness of human nature, and to the27 degree that28 this nature develops, and29 culminates in tyrannies30 of which individuals and the multitude become victims, there seems to be only one source, and that is the centre of the whole life, 31which is31 God, in Whom there is the place of safety32 and the source of peace which is the longing of every soul.

He says: 'The grains which take refuge in the centre of the millstone are saved.' He has pictured the whole life as a mill, grinding. The safety of the soul is in going in the centre; there it is safe. I was once very interested in the advice of a sailor, when sailing in the boat. I asked him: 'Is there not any medi- cine for the sea-sickness?' He said: 'No, for a long time doc- tors have tried, but nothing is really successful. 1 will tell you one experience: you must fix your eyes on the horizon; that will keep you from sea-sickness.' On following that example I was benefitted. It was an example as a stimulus34 to my imag- ination, that the wider the outlook, the less is your troubles in life. If one fixes one's eyes on the horizon, as far as one can see, then one is saved from the little things and troubles of every day which make it unhappy. God is that horizon. Why? Because neither can you touch the horizon, nor God. The hori- zon is as far as you can see, and so is Cod. Question: What is the use of all philosophers who contradict each other? Answer: Someone asked the Prophet, on hearing from the Prophet that all things were created for a certain purpose: 'I cannot understand why mosquitos were created.' The Prophet answered: 'They were created because you may get up quickly at night for your vigil, and not sleep all night.' Everything has its purpose, only the knowledge of that purpose makes us able to utilize it. It is the ignorance of that knowledge which keeps us back from that benefit which we could realize. And so every person 35 . Saadi says that every soul is created for a certain purpose, and the light of that purpose has been kindled in that soul. As we need goldsmiths and blacksmiths, and farmers and gardeners, all sorts of different people, so we need philosophers, mystics, thinkers, believers and unbelievers. That makes the harmony of the whole thing. Just as in music, we want sharp and flat, high notes and low notes. Beauty is created from variety. 33. Sk.sh.: No question has been reported 34.

Summer School Suresnes, August 4th, 1923 Tolerance is the sign of an evolved soul, that3 a soul shows the proof of its evolution in the degree of the4 tolerance it shows. The life in the lower creation shows the lack of tolerance. The tendency of fighting with one another which one sees among beasts and birds shows the reason at the back of it, that intolerance is born in their nature. By a psychological study of the4 nature and the tendency5 of the lower creation one will find that the evolution that takes place among birds and beasts shows this tendency of6 intolerance becoming less and less. It is the love element developing in their nature which brings them together to form flocks and herds. The same tendency of intolerance sometimes manifests in a more distinct and pro- nounced form in man. The reason is that man's responsibility in life is great- er, his difficulties are many, and he lives in a crowd which is larger than a flock or a' herd. At the back of this tendency there is8 a most wonderful secret hidden, the depths of which are fathomed by the mystic. The gmystics who seeg God within and without bothlo, who recognize12 Cod in unity and variety both1', the mystics realize13 that it is the One Who has known Himself to be One, Who does not know of two, Who feels uncomfortable and agitated, and shows a revolt on knowing that 'there exists another besides Me.'

One may give a thousand reasons for intolerance. They exist too, but the inner reason is one and the same in all aspects, of intolerance. The Sufis have called it kibria, which means vanity23, vanity23 of24 the Whom alone it belongs. As one evolves spiritually so a person seems to rise above this natural tendency:26 intolerance, for the reason that he begins to see, besides him- self and the second person, Cod; and he unites himself with the other person in Cod. It is the third person whose love or27 devotion makes two people unite. For an28 instance, the children of the same parents, they29 love one another in realization of the idea that they are of the same parents; 3opeople of one nation, they31 love one another in the thought that they belong to one nation.

Answer: It is very difficult. Therefore that tendency of rejecting, dis- like61, prejudice62, it is that tendency which must be con- quered. It gives such a mastery. I remember my own experience once, that in the school my teacher said that there was a tree, that the leaves of that tree are very good for a person. They purify the blood. That did not interest me. 'But,' he said, 'it is so bitter that you cannot drink it, nor taste it, nor touch it' 63 . ' 1 think I can! ' 63 1 did not care for the medicine, only I thought: 'Cannot ......, no one can...'

If one would fight with oneself, then one would fight against the tendency of reject- ing; that leads in the end to mastery. Question: I thought it was no use trying to force yourself.

Summer School Suresnes, August 4th, 1923 Resignation. Resignation is the outcome of the soul's evolution, for it is the result of either love or wisdom. In the first place man has a free will, but its power is too small in comparison to the 2all-powerful will2 of Cod, which stands as more powerful individuals, or as conditions which cannot be helped, or as many other things. Resignation does not mean to give up a thing. Resignation means to be content3 in giving up; to be resigned means a satisfaction in self-denial. That self-denial cannot be a virtue which comes eat as a result of helplessness and culminates into4 dissatisfaction. The nature of an unevolved ego is to resent against5 everything that comes up in life as a hindrance on the path of accomplishing a certain object. And when one6 accepts to become7 resigned in the face of a difficulty, and which8 at the same time gives one9 satisfaction, he, without having accomplishedi0 has risen1', resigned. ~nd'~ in this way even a defeat of a truly resigned soul is 13success in truth13. Resignation is a quality of the saintly souls. It is bitter in taste, but sweet in result. Whatever be the power and position of a person, he has always to meet with a more powerful will in whatever form it manifests, and12 which in truth is divine Will. By standing against the divine Will one may break oneself, but by being resigned to the divine Will one makes a way, for the14 resignation is the manner of the water.

Such is the way of the saintly souls who tread the path of resignation, and yet keep the14 self-will alive. That will which16 has the power to make its way. A person who is resigned by nature becomes in the end a consolation to the17 self and a happiness to the others18. Resignation is not necessarily weakness or laziness or coward- nesslg or lack of enthusiasm. Resignation is only the expression of the14 mastery over oneself. The tendency to resign to the will of another or to conditions does not always work to the disadvantage of the resigned one. It sometimes may prove to be profitless, but the benefit of such a virtue is realized in the end. It is the lack of the power of endurance which is the cause when souls e\\ri.H-~et-be-resi.g~ed are not ready to resign; for they cannot endure their pain, they cannot sustain their loss. Resigned ones prac- tise resignation even in small things of everyday life. They avoid giving20 unnecessarily the power of will in every little thing they do. Resignation is passivity, and it shows sometimes21 disadvantageous in the life of an active person, who has an object before him to accomplish. But it may be under- stood that a continual activity with power and energy given to it very often results into22 a disaster. Every activity is balanced by passivity. One must be active when there23 is a24 time 25to be active25; and one must become passive when the conditions present26 to be passive27. It is in this manner that success in life is attained, and happiness which is the seeking of every soul is gained. 28~he truth of this can be seen in the life of the child and that of the grown-up person. As soon as the child becomes attracted to objects29, what it knows is that it wants it. And if it is denied of30 that object the child is dissatisfied. And as ene-gtew the child grows it learns, with its evolution in life, resignation.

If a motor comes, I do not mind, I will just go on.' He will come against something which is more powerful, and will destroy himself.'Therefore the wise cyclist will see that there is some wagon3' before him, or that the way is blocked; he will take another way. It is just a little hindrance at the time, but still that resignation makes him safe from disaster and gives him a chance to strike another line by which he will come to the same destiny38. Very often people who are strong-headed, they will not be resigned, and very often they will find in their lives that by not being resigned they get what they want, and that gives them a proof of the beneficial nature of the strong-headed- ness, that means the lack of resignation. But what happens in the end? Their own power sometimes strikes them so hard, that it breaks them to pieces. Because there is no passivity. After all man is Ijmited; and there is an unlimited power before him. And if he always wishes to fight, he must of necessity break himself. As in English: 'Man proposes, God disposes.' If man is conscious of that, he will know when to try and make his way, and when to strike a different way.

In our everyday life we come per- haps when we see people, there are twenty times or a hundred times, that we happen to come in a position where we, our feeling, is struck by somebody40 has said something, and we want to answer. That is a natural tendency, which goes out spontaneously to answer. And if the wisdom at that time was wakened: 'Is it necessary to answer? If we did not answer?' That is to become resigned to the Will 41 . Spontaneously is to just to give the answer. But kindness, or the feeling per- haps the person does not understand, or the person has perhaps a little more experience, that tendency when it comes, keeps the tendency to speak back; and there is the mastery. There- fore it is bitter for the time, it shakes one; that force which will come out is controlled. By being able to sustain that, one has gained a certain mastery over oneself. Question: In your example it is stopping for a moment, but mostly in life it means going quite another way. Answer: It is both.

It seems to come from above but it rises from below first4: 5the vapours which rise from the sea first5 and6 turn into clouds. so7 every knedeeige aspect of knowledge gained by all beings rises upwards as vapours8 forming into clouds as the idea is9, and again falling from above as the rain.

But do the prophets differ from one another? No, they cannot differ. The reason is that it is the various minds which differ, not40 souls. The one who lives in his mind, he41 is conscious of42 mind; the one who lives in his soul is conscious of his43 soul. What does the word spiritual44 mean? It means 45soul-conscious, or 45spirit-conscious. There is a line of a song: '46~ight has a thousand eyes; 46day has47 but one.'

He has something in his mind already. And it is with that design that he begins his work. But once he has begun his work, then his work begins to inspire him and56 change his design. That design which was first made by the artist was the predestination, and that change which took place while he was doing, is what we may call free will. 57 . 58This gives a key to this prob- lern58. By thinking more about it, it will become more and more clear. The difficulty is, to separate Cod from man and man from Cod is the most difficult point. There is no separa- tion between Cod and man. Therefore one cannot say 59 that Cod designs and man has his free will. No, Cod designs and Cod changes; and60 man designs and man changes6'. 620nly Cod's action is perfect, man's action is limited. For an instance a band is playing, the flute is playing. There is a part that the flute is playing. 63~t the same time the band is play- ing as the composer has made it.

Answer : Human body represents five elements; and the 65 nature's law is that every element returns to its own origin. Naturally therefore the breath which is the air part, it turns into air, and the heat is absorbed by the heat. After the body is dead there is no heat any longer; so the fire element has left al- ready. Then what the body belongs to, either to the earth or to the water; these two elements remain. But the body was born on the earth, not in the water, and 66he its comfort in the earth, not in the water. And the body which was always afraid of being drowned in the water, an element which has always been foreign to it, better be saved from that67 element also, and be buried into the earth. Question: That explains the reason why the Roman Catholic Church forbids cremation? Answer: There-are-peep)@-te-be Everybody has his own idea, better respect their idea. 68 sometimes one's nearest relation 69 . From psychological point of view70 I have said. Now there is another point of view. Every living being, either man or animal, has the fear of fire. A powerful animal like the lion is afraid of the fire. The elephant with all its large body and strength runs away from the sight of the fire. If that is the nature of all living beings, that fire is frightening, then imagine for a person who is not yet dead, for him to know that when he is dead his body will be put into fire. If he still retains in his mind that fear, although the mind becomes disconnected from the body, the mind will have a shock just the same. The elephant should not be put into the fire to make it afraid; just the sight makes it run. So with man also. For man to feel that 'the body which is72 always saved from being burnt - - -,' it has a shock upon the spirit73. But at the same time if a person is willing, he may just as well be.

For an instance: two people who are real friends, their pleas- ure and displeasure, if they feel at a distance, the same thing it is afterwards because in the hereafter they are not sent in another country.

Question: Can all souls on higher planes see on all planes lower than they? Answer: Yes. But at the same time there is no plane in which we do not exist. The only difficulty is that if we close the door of that plane ourselves, then nobody is to be blamed. It is we who have closed the door. For an instance, our senses, thoughts, imagination, all centre upon the outward life, and that itself makes us bound to the outer life. Because the law of nature is such that we are bound by every object to which we respond. Everything that our eyes see we are bound by. And therefore all the external life binds our attention. And therefore attention is so bound from every side, it keeps the soul drawn to one plane. The soul who is capable 87 of other planes 88 . Meditation is the path by which we make a habit of closing ourselves to the outer world for a moment, and experience what we can. Once we are able to set the soul free, then there is no plane that the soul will not experience, because all planes are a natural experience of the soul. It is not what the soul need adopt, it is for the soul to find itself in its free condition. There it can move about and feel 89 . Of course, many would lose balance over it, by trying too much to dabble with phenomena, which is so much done in the world.

Every little lack of consideration or regard for all those who wish to call the attention of the prophets has been noticed and remarked in the lives of all7 the prophets. It means to live in the8 tkaven and to liveg on the earth at the same time. The heart of the prophet is meant to be the harp, every string of whichlo to bell tuned in its proper pitch, 12that Cod may play upon it His music. And it is that celestial music which is called the divine Message. It is therefore that all the ancient Scriptures were named Gitas or Gathas, which means the same13, music.

The Jewish Scriptures are sung15 when recited; also the Qur'an is recited in the form of singing. Every musician knows how difficult it is to keep his violin in tune, especially when it is knocked about wheneveri6 he has to move in the crowd. The heart therefore is uncornpa- rably17 more susceptible to get out of tune andl8 it is therefore that the seers and mystics sought solitude, and kept themselves away from the crowd. But the prophet, by his natural mission, is placed in the midst of the crowd. It is the problem of the5 life in the crowd which he has to solve, and yet not solve it intellectually, as everyone wishes to do, but spiritually, by keeping that instrument, the heart, in proper tune to the Infinite, that he may get the answer for all questions arising19 every moment of the day. It is therefore that even the presence of the prophet is the answer to every question; without having spoken one word the prophet gives the answer, but if a mind restless and confused cannot .hear it, then that mind receives the answer in words. The answer of the prophet uproots every question, but the answer always comes from the heart of the prophet without20 even2' having22 asked the23 question. For the prophet 240nly the medium between God and man, therefore the answer is from Cod. It is not true that the prophet answers a question because he reads the mind; it is the mind of the one who asks the question striking25 in the inner plane the divine bell, which is the heart of the prophet, and God, hearing this26 bell, answers. The answer comes in a manner as if words were put in27 the mouth of the prophet. The prophet, therefore, need not think on the question he is asked, it 28a11 automatically works28, so that the question, 29spoken or unspoken2', draws30 out of him the answer.

So the true character of the sacred Scriptures is that even the Book answers the ques- tion, if a person opens it automatically in order to find out38 a39 solution to a certain problem. Imagine, if the Book answers, then one could expect more from the prophet, for the soul of the prophet is the living Book, his heart the sacred Scripture. What is religion? In the outer sense of the word, a form given to wor- ship Cod, and a law given to a community to live harmoniously. And what does religion mean in the inner sense of the word? It means a staircase made for the soul to climb, and reach that plane where the5 Truth is real- ized. Both these aspects of religion may be found in the words and in the soul of the prophet: his words the law, his Message the wisdom, and his40 being that peace which is the seeking of every soul. Cod has never manifested as Himself in this world of variety where everything and4' being is a divine expression, yet with its limitations. And if the world has been able to believe in Cod and to recognize God in a being, it is in the godly, it is in the soul which reflected42 Cod. With all the argu- ments for and against the idea of the divinity of Christ, no43 sincere Cod- believer44 can deny that Cod reflects45 through the personality of the Master.

That the one who is dead, if his body can be preserved, then he cannot be dead, but is alive still and can live long. There was a custom among the old Egyptians; in the East that custom does not exist, but the tendency exists, that in every banquet or feast, when everybody was inclined to be happy, a mummy was brought; and it was just brought for a moment, and then taken away, in order to waken man in the midst of his joy and pleasure, for him to see the other side of things.

Answer: Cod, the Infinite or the Absolute, is the Cod Whom our in- telligence cannot grasp. And in order to make that47 Cod in- telligible we first make a Cod of our imagination, and worship Him. And as we worship Him, so our 48imaginations become\" a kind of step to lead to the real Cod, Who is the lnfinite and the Absolute.

Many answers may be given and yet no answer will satisfy, for the true answer is that all is God and God is all, none exists save He. And the question what are we then, may be answered by the phrase of the Bible, that 'we live and move and maket5 our being in God.' God is usI6 but we are not Gods. The difference between God and our being is not of the Being; in Being, God and we are one. The difference is of our limitation andla the perfection of God. How are we to conceive19 the idea of God the Absolute? We are not made20 to conceivelg that21. We as limited beings are not able to know perfection, but perfection itself knows perfection. We can imagine and make a God of our own, to make God intelligible to us, to make it easy for us to advance in22 the spiritual path, and as we advance, the unlimited Being working through us, makes His own way and realizes His perfection. For in this realization He only realizes Himself, which is not at all difficult for Him. Man thinks that religion or philosophy or mysticism, all this he has learned as he has evolved. Yes, it23 is true, but the result of all this learn- ing and evolution is realized in24 a certain degree, not only by unevolved human beings, but even by the animals and birds.

Question: You said: \"this is all the world there is.\"49 Are there no other worlds in what the scientists call the universe, which are inhabited by beings in physical form? Answer: VJhen I said the world, I meant the universe. Very often we mix these two words. Question: Do there exist eCkef beings on other planets? Answer: Yes, they do exist and even more so, which science has not yet discovered. Question: How far are plants self -conscious? Answer: A scientist from lndia50 was here and lecturing on the subject of the trees and plants breathing. No doubt compared with the birds and insects, the plants are less wakened. But at the same time, when from a mystical point of view one looks at them, one finds that as the animals and birds are more intuitive and capable of feeling more deeply, the plants and trees are even more so. If one knew the intuitive power of the plants and the feeling that they have, one would feel that they feel and they know some things even better than a human being. An illness or a death in a family, pleasure and displeasure of the ones who are around a plant, and the condition of the life of a person who waters the plants, is felt more than his most dear friend, a human being. For the reason that man is most selfish and so he is absorbed in his own interest in life; and in the 46. 0.t.: Isto don, changed back by Gd. into \"to bess 47. Ibid.: s*onn Instead of \"inw 48.

There are two different conceptions of the prophetic souls3. 40ne as is held4 among the Hindus; they call5 the prophe@ an ~vatara~, which means Godhead. They have also distinguished the characters of their Avataras from their claims. Some claim8 to be the Avatara, or the incarnation of Vishnu; some claim8 to be the incarnation of Shiva. It was easy for the people in9 India to grasp the idea of a prophet being a God incarnatelo, rather than accepting a prophet to be as every other human1 l being.

The difference between the prophets among24 Hindus and among the Ben lsrael12 that can be noticed is one. The Hindu prophets claim as25 God themselves. The reason was that the people in India, owing to their philo- sophical evolution, were ready to accept24 divine in man. But on the con- trary in Arabia and Palestine even the claim of prophetship26 aroused such ad7 opposition against the prophets that their lives have been28 in danger, and their mission became most difficult for them to perform. After the ~laimin~s~~ of Godhead there have been many reformers in India to whom people responded without much difficulty. But in the Near East it has always been difficult, and will always be so. It is for this reason that the ancient of esotericism, 31 the ancient 0rder30 of the Sufis, 32had diffi~ulties~~ to exist under the reign of orthodoxy. The lives of many great Sufis have been made a victim33 to34 the orthodox powers which reigned. Sufism thereford5, which was as a mother of the coming reform in the re- ligious world, was protected by Persia, and in the end found a greater free- dom in the land of ~indus~~, where37 Hindus respected it and Mohammedans followed it without the slightest hesitation.

The Sufi Message which is now being given in the Western world is the child of that mother, who has been known for many years as Sufism.

Question: Will you explain to us the meaning of the different signs of the Zodiac and the special influence of each one12? Answer: In order to know the meaning of the signs of Zodiac, and the special influence each one has, one must study astrology. It is a science itself. But if I have to say anything about it, I shall only say that the soul is light, the mind is light, the body is light. It is the light of different grades. And it is this reali- zation which connects man with the stars and planets. And the influence of the stars and planets works upon the person, for the reason that the person is connected with that planet, by the reason of the time, and its influence upon the planets and souls. Plainly speaking, there are certain times when a certain planet has its influence; at that time a child is born. Then the child is born under that planet. Then the child has that char- acter. The signs of13 Zodiac are expressive of the symbolical meaning of the influence14.

This was much contradicted by bidqy - and theoso- phist students. Can you tell about it? 30~t will be contradicted even more.30 Answer: There are two aspects of this question which must be consid- ered. One aspect is biological aspect. One sees how from the vegetable kingdom the animal kingdom is born in the insects, in the germs and worms. Then one sees the primitive man. As the scientist today cannot find the link between man and the monkey, the missing link, but many races have come and been destroyed, and several races even now live in places which the geographical society has not yet found. Therefore if the geo- graphical society has failed to find the missing link, it is not that it does not exist. The difference31, the mystic puts it in a beautiful form, the scientist writes it naturally. A mystic vaguely tells, without presenting a natural history museum to see. But when we read the traditions, and when we read at the time of Hanuman, and his army went to help Rama, the monkey word was used, because we have no word for that missing link between man and animal. C)1-the-ee~ttary -peegCe nedd-beeerne It is a very bad thought that man has come from animal. But at the same time yesterday is not today. But that is not the only process. Another aspect of this ques- tion must be looked at32 from quite a different point of view. And unless this question is seen from a different point of view, it will always be difficult to understand it fully.

And so one sees that from vegetable comes the animal, from the animal man. Every living being or object has as its source a certain material.

By looking at the question from that point of view, one sees that this is natural also, when the different colours were not ready to make out of it a substance to make something. But when he has made the substance, then he has different substances to work with. For instance, the work of the chem- ist and the artist. The work of the chemist is to mke take dif- ferent 35 , the artist does not have to WFI~ make that pro- cess. He just goes to the chemist and takes them.

Summer School Suresnes, August loth, 1923 There is a custom 3in the Western world3 prevalent everywhere3, of proposing toasts, which is significant of a psychological truth behind it, which is to wish for a certain thing to happen at the4 time when one's own wish is being granted in a smaller5 or greater form. This shows that the moment when one's wish is granted is that moment, is6 when one is satis- fied. We should not therefore wonder why people go to spiritual souls for their blessing. Those who are spiritually blessed, their innermost wish has been satisfied, and a wish made by them acts as a quick blessing in the life of everyone. But this also teaches one to catch the opportunity of getting the good wish of every person at the moment when his wish is being granted. Having known this psychological law, the people in the East look for such an opportunity of offering food to the hungry or a gift to the one who needed it, that7, awhile accepting ita, the wish that naturally rises from the heart of theg persona will certainly be granted. Very few in thislo world know what great power is hidden in the wish of a person whose heart is in the state of dancing, so to speak full of joy. We read in the legends of the1 l old of sages calling upon their friends, pupils or followers at a certain time and asking them to make a wish, for they knew the moment when the wish could be granted. There is a story of Hafiz, that near the home of the Shaikh there were eleven pupils whose name was Hafiz, but among them there was only one who used to engage Notes: Where vlGd.copyw is mentioned, this refers to a copied text in Gd.8~ handwrit- ing, either made from her own longhand reporting of the questions and answers, or from Sakina's shorthand transcription.

One eve- ning13 Shaikh called: 'Hafizl' There was only one Hafiz awake, all others asleep. The Shaikh was holding the bowl with the thought of the wish to be granted. With his eyes closed he gave it to Hafiz. But then as he knew there were ten more, he again called: 'Hafizl' And as all others were asleep, the same Hafiz came again and received the bowl. Eleven times the teacher called, and the same Hafiz went again and again. In the morning ten were disappointed, and that one Hafiz was14 blessed with elevenfold blessings. It would not be an exaggeration if one said that even Cod has a time when He grants wishes. And if one knows that time one certainly becomes benefited and blessed. Since Sufism teaches that15 'look for God in the heart of man,' the wise mureeds therefore look for16 the pleasure and dis- pleasure of God in everyone they meet, and they carefully regard the pleas- ure and displeasure of every person17 they come lainto contacti8, knowing that in this manner19 they regard the pleasure and displeasure of God. Besides having one's wish granted, the joy of giving another happiness, that itself is greater20 a wish granted, if one had21 risen to that plane of human evolution when one can enjoy pleasure with the pleasure of another, when one can feel satisfaction in the satisfaction of another, when one can be happy in bringing happiness to another. No one will give another happi- ness and will not have the same come to him a thousandfold. There comes a stage of evolution in the life of man when he feels more satisfied by seeing another person satisfied with food than he22 himself23 having eaten it23, when he feels comfortable in seeing another person comfortable, when he feels richly adorned by seeing ,another person clothed nicely; for this stage is a24 stepping-stone to the realization of God. 12.

One should always think that life is an opportunity. Every moment is an opportunity25. Sometimes one can do good by not troubling much oneself; it is just by seizing the oppor- tunity. If one is attentive and brings some pleasure and happi- ness, it is not always that it costs. What it costs is attention, if one keeps one's attention fixed upon that idea, and one is constantly seeking where one can do some little good to another. By giving one's place in a bus or tramcar; by just having a little consideration for the aged, a little consideration for someone who is perhaps 27honoured or 26 or respect- edZ7, if one can offer what a person is lacking in his life, without him knowing, that is always a great 28 . To do good is the work of the sage. Sometimes people become over- enthusiastic, which does harm. It is a spell, a fit of goodness. That does no good. The real goodness is which comes spon- taneously. A thief is always on the lookout to rob something; so a good person is always looking for an opportunity; he will always find. Question: Can you tell something more of the time that God grants wishes? Answer: That Cod grants wishes at two times. he time is when your heart is free from every thought, or feeling, or emotion; in the most peaceful and tranquil condition; at that time every wish that is sown is just like a seed sown in fertile soil2'.

God knows better than me. I may wish something wr0n~.3~' The one who gives his life in this33 way in the hands of God is 34 . Answer: The other time when the wish is granted is when somebody is satisfied, has been made happy by you, and naturally, out of his heart springs a kind of fountain which pours upon you a kind of blessing.35 It will be just like rain from above, which in time will bring its fruits and flowers. Question: When a man is poor, but can just live with the means he has, is it then good when he gives away mate- rial things, and so makes himself dependent upon others? Answer: You see, the question what is good is a very difficult question to decide. Good is peculiar to a person. It all depends upon what that person thinks. When he thinks it is right, it is good. That is the only question. The story of36 Saint Aias3': he was an ascetic, and for his food only a loaf of bread was enough every day and perhags mete than-that he would not keep anything for tomorrow. If he was given four people's food in one day he would distribute it. If he had still more, he shared it all. Next day he was without. If one said, why did he make himself dependent upon people for the next day? He would say that 'we live in this life interdependent. As long as I do not go to anybody, not force upon anybody, only people brought it, what does it matter? It is from Him. It is not depending upon others. It all comes from God. It all goes to the creatures of God. What does it matter?' It all depends upon the person, and how the person looks at it. 32. Gd-copy: \"God knows what Is right\" added 33.

What must they sacrifice? Answer: In the first place I should say that if one object is the seeking of one's soul, and the other object is life's necessity, and if one object is to be sacrificed, it is better the one which is necessary, but keep to the soul's seeking. There is another point of view; in order to become spiritual, we should not become unworldly. We can just as well38 in the world and yet not be of the world. We can be active in our everyday life, and yet be concentrative. A person who can concentrate well can manage the affairs of the world better. Those who have attained success in business, in worldly affairs, they had their concentration better. Therefore concentration is in no way a hindrance. A 39 gained through the power of spirituality is more secure and has a stronger foundation. Furthermore, there is one rule of life, which must be understood. That the success is gained by two ways: by the right way and by the wrong way. Wrong way means which is against spiritual idea. And when a person has started by one path, he must keep to that path in order to be successful. And if he finds that per- haps the other path will be better for the success, he will lose. A person who is going the wrong way, if he thinks that the right way will be better, he will lose. The person who is going in the right way, he will not lose. His success will perhaps be slow, but it is secure, and he will all through be successful. The other has no danger, but his greatest danger is: going into the right path; that is his loss. 38.

In the Qur'an it is mentioned: 'We have made thy light out of Our Light and from23 that Light We have made the whole24 universe.' In plain words this explains that, when there was nothing, no form, no name, no person, no object, there was Intelligence and it is the contraction of that Intelligence which brought Its essence into a form of light, which is called the Divine Spirit. 25~he expansionz6 of the same Light has been the cause of the whole manifestation. 271n plain words27 the manife~tation~~ is the exhalation of God and what is called ~aya~~, destruction 300r the end of the world30, is the inhalation of God.

Many wish to limit divine law to this man-made conception of time and make speculations about it. But the tendency of the mystic is to bend his head low in worship as the thought of the Eternal Life of Cod, the Only Being, comes to his mind.

One would 73never have73 thought that the cobra could eat the whole chicken. Then the cobra's power is great because it is meditative. In all mystical symbols the cobra has been made a mystical sign, because there is so much that one can learn from the life of a cobra.

There is so much in the world which21 we can pity and which would be right for us to take pity on22, but if we had no time free from our own self we cannot give23 mind te-the-emditten-& to others in the world. Life is one long journey and the more24 behind we have left ourselves25, the further we have progressed toward the goal. Verily when the false self is lost, the true self is discovered. Question: Why do we find a satisfaction in self-pity? Answer: The reason is that by nature we find satisfaction in love. And when we are confined to ourselves, we begin to love our- selves; of26 our limitations we have self-pity. But therefore the love of self always brings dis 27, because the self is made to love28 and therefore when we love, the first condition of love is that we forget our self. We cannot love another person by loving our self at the same time. The condition of love is to forget oneself; then one knows how to love. If one said: 'give me a sixpence and I will give you a shilling,' that is another kind of love.29 Ibid.: \"thatu1 instead of llwhichm Ibid.: \"a\" added Gd-h.: omitted Hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: \"the\" Instead of \"aw Gd.h., hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: Itthe worstt1 instead of \"worse\" Ibid.: \"of\" instead of \"ton I bid.: \"is left\" placed before '@afterwardsw Ibid.: \"that\" instead of ttwhichw I bid.: \"uponI1 Hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: \"ourv1 added I bid.: I1furthern lnstead of llmoren Gd.h., hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: lloneselfw Gd.hwr.copy, Sk.l.tp.: \"overI1 instead of Skesh.: after \"dism follows a small blank; Sr.: \"dissati~factlon~~ Sr.: \"but not to be lovedn added Gd.hwr.copy: \"that Is more a businessn added"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"Question: Do you mean by false self the ego? Answer: Yes, by the false self I mean30 false ego, the deluding ego, someone who has guisedl himself as the ego. The reason is that man's ego is false ego. What is ego? It is that line which connects God and man, that line, one end of which is man, the other is Cod. Therefore that end which is man's ego is false, because man has covered it with false ego. The ego is true, it ' is divine, it cannot be anything else. But man covers it with illusions and calls it 'me,' 'self3*.' When that33 wrong con- ception is broken by knowledge, love, wisdom or meditation, then it is just like the clouds which are broken, which cover the sun, and the true ego comes out, the only ego there is. Answer: There are two ways of looking at it: the way of the Master and of the saint. The way of the saint is: 'Thy will be done'; the way of the Master is: 'my will be done.' 35111 the end both things become one. But to say: 'Thy will be done' is a resignation. Question: Is it possible for an ego36 to come on earth and never be covered by clouds of illusion? Answer: No, the beauty is to come out of that illusion. If one came wise, there was no joy of coming out of it. The joy is in the unveiling. The question is, what is the ego? It is the ego in us which says 'I,' 'this is mine.' What is it? It is that ego which says: 'this is mine.' When a person says 'I am sorry,' what is it in him that says ' I am sorry'? It is his ego; not his hand, his eye, his ear. 30.

Answer: Yes, the result of the manifestation of the real ego is unselfishness. It is a natural outcome of it and the more one is absorbed in the false ego, the more selfish that person is. Answer: The real ego does not know sorrow; it is happiness. We long for happiness because our true being is happiness. Cod is happi- ness. There are many people who do not long for God but they long for happiness. It is the same thing. For instance an athe- ist, he says there is no Cod, but he longs for happiness. God is happiness. Question: What is real1 y the character? Answer : Character is so to speak a picture with lines and colours we make within ourselves. And it is wonderful to see that 'how the tendency of character building springs up from child- hood just like one sees the instinct of building a nest in a bird.' he^^ little child begins to note everything in the grown-up people and begins to adopt all that seems to it the best: the word, the manner, the movement, the idea, every- thing that it grasps from the grownup, whatever seems to its own mind best. It attracts it and it builds so to speak a build- ing which is its character. It is being built all through the life. By this we understand that when a person is absorbed in the self, one has no time to see the other, then there is no other. But when one forgets oneself, one has the time to see here and there and add naturally to one's character. So the charac- ter is built. One need not make an effort in building the char- acter. If one only forgets oneself. For instance the great actors and actresses40 with great qualifications, if they do not forget their selves, they cannot act; they may have all capa- bility. So a musician, when he cannot forget at the time when he is playing, he cannot perform music to satisfaction. So with the poet, the artist. Think then the whole work of building 37.

And I have again seen people with great qualification, but they re- member themselves so much that they cannot do the best of their lives. I have known a vina player, he tried so much to play his instrument, for six, nine hours a day, but whenever he used to go in the assembly, he used to become so nervous because he thought of himself, and all the impressions of the people would fall upon him. And he used to take his instrument and cover it and run away, and had never a chance of being great, with all his qualifications. Self-confidence is a great thing but forgetting oneself is greater still. I have seen Sara Bernard. She was singing a very simple song: the National Hymn of France. When she used to come on the stage she used to win every person there.

The idea that the angels are nearer to cod12, according to this doc- trine is right12. Souls who have not journeyed further13, are naturally close to the Divine Spirit; they are angels. Someone asked the Prophet why man was greater than the angels, man who caused14 all the bloodshed on the earth 15and angels who always occupy16 themselves15 in the praise of Cod. 17~he answer was17 that the angels knew not anything of the earth.

Answer: It is the strength with which the mechanism was wound. One clock goes on for the whole month, and the other clock wants winding after twenty-four hours. There is another clock which can go on for a whole year. So is the whole mechanism of the whole life. There are some beings, souls, which can go on much longer, because the winding is stronger; some shorter, because .the force that is at the back of it is only that much. It does not mean that the angels were meant to be angels, not to go further, but it happens that the soul who goes so far and only remains in that Heaven 56 . There are other souls who have a greater power to go further, they have gone to the angelic sphere, and go farther still by the power by which they have first started.

Answer: If it is natural for a little child that every time he strikes his hoop it will not go as far as it went first, so it is that natural movement which comes from the divine Spirit that strikes one, to go further than another. If we study the light, we shall find that all the rays do not go evenly; some go very far, others remain very near the flame. Every ray, large or small, has a different distance to which it reaches. Question: What causes some beings to become mortal and some to remain angels? Answer: It is the mortal garb that they take and therefore it is the garb which is mortal; they are not mortal. Upon the con- sciousness of the soul it becomes impressed. It is the garb which the soul has adopted for its use. As every person begins by thinking: ' I am my body,' from that time the illness of the body thinks: ' I am ill,' and the death of the body means: ' l am dead' to that person, then he becomes his garb; he is not himself.

Answer: Yes, since all has come from Cod, then all has come from the divine Light. The first offshoot of the divine Light is angel. Question: Do they experience life on each succeeding plane of existence towards the physical life? Answer: Yes, they do, but not all. For instance, imagine a picture of a thousand birds starting from Paris to go to England. Some were able to go as far as Rouen. There they liked the place, they stayed there, they enjoyed it, they forgot all. Some went to Havre and they enjoyed the seashore, and just lived there and were happy. Some went still further, crossed the Channel, and arrived in England. Those who stayed in Rouen, they had not a very long journey to come back to Paris again. Those who had crossed, for them it was a very long journey to come back. Question: Do angels have a form before they reach the physi- cal plane? Answer: It is a question which is very subtle, and most difficult to explain in words. The reason is that every thing or being that has a name has a form. But we are accustomed only to call something which we can see a form, and what our eyes cannot see we do not call it a form. And to conceive the form of an angel, it wants to turn into an angel in order to conceive what the true angelic form is. But as we are accustomed to picture every one like us, and therefore whenever we think of fairies or angels, spirits or ghosts, we picture them very near us. The fairies of the Chinese have more the Chinese figure, and the fairies of the Russians have Russian hats5', because the mind will picture what it is accustomed. 59.

Because the angel should fall on the earth. And as soon as it touched the earth, it would not be angel any longer. Evil spirits is quite a different thing.

According to the religious law, also spiritual law, it is a very bad thing to break the law of fasting. It is a sacred law, a religious law. So every mureed refused. This peasant could not understand why they refused. They were too modest to say that they were fasting, but at the same time they did not break their vows. When he came to the Murshid, Murshid said: 'Yes,' and very gladly sat at the table with the family. He was very pleased, and very sorry that all these young men did not eat. They thought: our Murshid has perhaps forgotten, he is perhaps in his dreams. After the dinner was finished, and the peasant was very glad, when they went out, one of the daring pupils came to the Murshid: 'Murshid, I am sorry to say, per- haps you have forgotten that we are fasting.' He said: 'No, 47child, I had not forgotten; I would rather break the fast, however sacred, than to break the heart of the one who pre- pared that\" 84.. for me.' That was the idea. It is to answer life's demands. At that time life had demanded to keep Murshid's word, though inwardly 49 Question: 5%hen one may not hold light tight to any original plane and gets into all sorts a€ unhappy circum- stances, how to get out of this best?

For we shall wake5' to every plane as we go on in life's journey. What is necessary is to be wide awake through life, and see what is asked of us, by our friend, by our neighbour, by our acquaintance, by a strange person who is travelling with us. It is just becoming more and more considerate and observing more clearly what another expects of us. Do we harm him, or do we serve him, are we kind to that person, or are we cruel? Because everyone through life has his motive before him, and in going towards that motive he is often apt to forget whom he pushes away and whom he hurts, and on whom he treads, and to whom he becomes unjust, and to whom he becomes unkind. Who does not observe, does perhaps a hun- dred 52 mistakes, 53 . It does not mean that one can become without mistakes. Still if he can avoid nine hundred out of a thousand, it is something.

Answer : To go in your own direction is good as long as one under- stands one's own direction and one's own 55 . Nothing, however much good it appears, is a virtue unless it is willingly done. Because in the willingness in doing a sacrifice, there one experiences the breath of freedom. A virtue which is forced upon oneself or another is not a virtue; it loses its beauty. We must do what seems good to us. If we think that it is a virtue to keep to our own idea, if we think that by giving up our idea and follow the idea of another, then it is a virtue when there is willingness.

' 2l wish to speak on the subject of2 our sacred task, 3what is our sacred task3, not only as4 the members5 of the Order, but as the6 servers of the divine Cause. Our sacred task is to awaken7 among those around us and among those whom we can reach in the first place the spirit of tolerance for the religion, Scripture, and the ideal of devotion of one another; our next task is to make man understand8 people of different nations, races and com- munities, also of different classes. By this we do not mean to say that all races and nations must become one, nor that all classes must become one; only what we have to say is that whatever be our religion, nation, race or class, our most sacred duty is to work for one another, in one another's in- terest, and to consider that as the service of God. A spirit of reciprocity we must create among the people of different races and nations, different classes and communities, forg the happiness, prosperity and welfare of each depends upon the happiness, prosperity and welfare of all. Besides that, the central theme of the Sufi Message is one simple thing, and yet most difficult, and that is to bring about in the world the realization of the divinity of the human soul, which hitherto has been overlooked, for the reason that the time had not come. The principal thing that the Message has to accomplish in this era is to create the realization of the divine spark in every soul, that every soul according to its progress may begin to realize for itself the spark of divinity within. This is the task that is before us. Notes: This lecture has become Gatheka no. 23. I1Kf.tp.\" points to a typewritten copy, probably made of a reporting by Kefayat LLoyd.

The Message is this: that the whole humanity is as one single body, and all nations and communities and races as the different organs, and the happiness and wellbeing of each of them is the happiness and wellbeing of the whole body. If there is one organ of the body in pain, the whole body has to sustain a share of the strain of it. That by this Message mankind may begin to think of'' his welfare and of his wellbeing is not12 int3 looking after himself, but it is in looking after others and when in all there will be reciprocity, love and goodness towards I 4 another, the better time will come. Now the question is, how are we to set15 to work? It is a difficult question to answer, because we all have our own way of working in the world and one form of work cannot be accepted16 by all. But it must be remembered that a great sacrifice on the part of the worker is necessary. Without sacrifice a worker will not be able to fulfil his mission. You will have to stand opposition17 from your friends, from your acquaintances, there will be monetary sacrifices18 to be made if occasion arises. A great deal of time will have to be sacrificed, action besides. Then you will have to sacri- fi.ce the desire for appreciation;lg work and the reward of the work is the satisfaction that 'I have done it.' You will be hindered by those who oppose, also by those who sympathize, by the bitterness of some and by the?O ignorance of some, and it will be easy, if you arez1 sensitive, to take the work upz2 one day and give it up onez3 day, and it will need a great deal of courage to go on with it against all sorts of opposition. But besides this, a great amount24 of prudence is necessary, and in the25 absence of that, the work cannot be successful; on the other hand it can26 suffer. Not prudence before strangers, opponents, but even prudence to those near and dear to you, your best friends, even there you will have to use prudence. What is wanted most of the worker in the Cause is prudence. You will have to work quietly, unassumingly, for this task can not be accomplished and cannot be made known by the noise of drums; for that there are other Movements.

The Soul towards Manifestation. The souls in the angelic sphere2 have all goodness, and this proves3 that goodness is natural and what is contrary to our nature, we call it4 bad- ness5. The anget+c souls in the angelic sphere2 are innocent. This also shows that innocence is the natural condition of the soul and the lack of inno- cence is a foreign element which the soul acquires after coming on6 earth. In the angelic sphere7 the souls are happy; this shows that unhappiness does not belong to souls8.

Seeking after goodness, innocence and happiness helps the angelic qualities to develop in a soul.

Question: The soul coming on earth is the angel; if a soul coming on earth is affected by the spirits, from the returning spirits, why are not all the angels affected by those spirits? Answer: A sphere means a certain limit, a certain horizon, that in that horizon nothing dense or earthly can enter. Before it enters it must become melted. And therefore the souls in those spheres are not touched by any souls coming from the earth. No souls coming from the earth are allowed to enter that sphere before they were purified by all elements of denseness. As an example very well known in India: the story of Indra. It is a story which has been made into dramas and operas, and produced for ages. The people of India have never become tired of it. It is always new and very interesting, because it has interest for the ordinary mind and for a thinking mind, both. The story is that a prince was taken up in Heaven by a fairy who loved him, and the prince urged upon the fairy to take him to the court of Indra, where she was appointed to dance every day. The fairy refused, because, she said: 'No earthly being is allowed to enter in Heaven. I have already done something against the rule. To bring you in the court of lndra will be the end of your life.' He said: 'I will not listen. I must see where you go.' She said: 'If you wish it, I will take you.' She took him to the court of Indra, where she was appointed to dance. She told him to hide behind her wings. But the wings could not cover, and those who saw, they told lndra that a man from the dense earth44 was not allowed to come to Heaven, was brought by this fairy. And the wrath of lndra arose, and he said: 'I will cast you down, the fairy who was privileged to be in Heaven, that you should live a life in a wilderness, a life of loneliness for many years to come. And for this man another sphere of wilderness. And until you will not be purified of five elements, you will not be able to enter the spheres of Heaven.' Well, it is an allegorical story. The fairy was the soul, and the man is the body. They were separated, because in Heaven 41. ibld.: \"that it absorbs all that Is around it, and in time develops so that it will emergen Instead of \"to absorb all else which Is around it In time, and to develop, so that it would immerge\"; \"To immerge, to immersen, are obsolete forms of \"to mergen (Oxford Dic- tionary) 42.

The soul was also cast out, because it loves the body so much. Then they were urified of five elements: no longer of fire, earth, water, aira. Then only the angel remains. Human went away; what remains? The angel only. Question: The soul that goes back, does it go back rich? Does it develop spiritual 1 y? Answer: It is spiritual already. Why has it come? To get the expe- rience of the earthly spheres. 46~nd then to lose it? Yes, there is nothing in it. It is. to come from innocence41 to virtue, and to be purified from it, from virtue to innocence41 again. 46 Question: Will you give us a definition of what initiation is, and what of ordination? Also explain more48 about the two different ways of working? Answer: The initiation is which is given in the Sufi Movement, in the circle which is called the Sufi Order. The ordination is which is given in the Sufi Movement, in the circle which is called Church of All, or the Universal Worship. By this ordina- tion a person is made Cherag, whose responsibility it is to serve God and humanity in the path of religion. It is a question which can be answered in many volumes, the ways of working. In short one can say that the devotion and love is the most desirable path, which welcomes every soul, and by which every soul is blessed. That is the work of the Cherag. The path of initiation has its many aspects. The pa- tient soul going through different aspects attains to the desired goal. 45. Ibld.: \"ethertt added 46.

And if there was no difference there would have been no joy in life. Life is interesting because of the differences. Question: Then the soul who has less to begin with, ie9 is handicapped? Answer: No one is handicapped in life. Life is progressing. Some have more to begin with and less in the end. Question: When one is purged of the five elements, are all the souls then equal? Answer: Still there is a variation. Where there is duality there is variation. Where there is two there is variation. When there are two flames5' they are not alike though-they-are-of-the same-demnt. In truth there is one, but in fact there are two. Question: iT the soul keeps its angelic qualities on earth, and does not experience eart hl y passions and other experiences of the earth, why does it come on earth? Is it on1 y to be an example to others? Answer: If you think so, yes. No one lives without action; and every action has its meaning. And therefore no one has come here without a purpose. If the meaning of his life and action we cannot understand, it does not mean that that person has not come for a purpose. And therefore in sum total, of the whole working of the universe every individual seems to have filled a certain place which was meant for him, and has been of a certain use in the whole working of the universe.

Only the difference between the wise and everyone is this: that everyone does not know the secret, the meaning of life. The wise learns his wisdom in learning to understand the meaning of life. Question: What does initiation mean? Answer: Initiation means entering53 a vow, a trust and confidence, in order to know and understand the life which is beyond the conception of everybody. Of course, as one goes further in the path of initiation, the higher one reaches in one's understand- ing. Every soul after having reached a certain stage receives an initiation. Some initiation which the soul does not know, and yet it is a step further in life. But the real initiations begin when the soul knows that it is being initiated. Ordination is the service of Cod. When Cod wishes a soul to serve in His path, an ordination comes. One thing54 is the unfoldment of the soul, the other thing55 is the utilizing of the life, using the life to its best purpose. 51.

Afterwards one finds that one should not have said it or perhaps one would5 have said it differently. The same thing is with the6 action. One feels ' I should not have done so' after having done something, or one thinks ' I should have done differently', but once it is done it is too late to do it otherwise. In human nature there is an inner urge to express oneself and that urge so to speak pushes out a word out of oneself before one has thought over7 it. And this all shows the sign of lack of control over oneself. It also is a sign of nervousness. Very often a person tries to answer somebody who has not yet finished speaking. Before a sen- tence is completed the answer is given. such8 answer given to an incom- plete idea is often not right. What generally happens in such cases, gthat one takes all things that come from outside in lifelo too much to heart and allows the outer things and influences to go into oneself deeper than they arel1 due. In this way one becomes sensitive and out of it rises nervousness. Notes: This lecture was first published in the book Character-Building.

Every word that is said to one need not be taken to be so important that it should upset one's whole being, disturb one's balance and rob one of one's will power. There are things the13 matter but there are many things in one's everyday life which do not matter much and one often is apt to give14 an undue stress upon them. Independence is achieved by indifference. It does not mean that one should take no heed of what another15 does or says. It only means to dis- criminate between important and unimportant things of everyday life, that every necessary and unnecessary thing must not demand so much of one's attention, thought and feeling. Political economy has become a subject of education. but spiritual economy is the main thing in religion. All one says and does and all that one thinks and feels, makes a certain strain upon one's spirit. It is wise to avoid every chance of losing one's equilibrium. One must stand peacefully but firmly against all influences that disturb one's life. The natural inclination is to answer in defence to every offence that comes from outside; by that one loses one's equilibrium. Self-control therefore is the key to all success and happiness. Besides this16 there are17 many who feel urged and obliged to say or do because someone asks of them, and in this way get weaker and weaker. There are others who roughly fight against it; and in this way both are in the18 error. The one who is able to keep his equilibrium without being annoyed, without being troubled about it, gains that mastery which is neededlg in the evolution of life. No principle must be blindly followed. Spiritual economy is not always a virtue if that disturbs harmony, if that in any way keeps one back from progressing20 if that puts one in a worse con- dition. However, it is most necessary to know the science of spiritual econ- omy, how to guard against all influences in one's21 everyday life which come to disturb our tranquillity, the peace of our soul.

Answer: Yes, there are many apart from those who do not follow the Christian Faith, but those who are Christian question whether there is some truth in this. And yet it is so simple to understand that the soul of the God-conscious who truly lived and moved and made his life in God, his every word, every thought, every action was directed to the service of humanity, who kept nothing back from sacrificing that for humanity, even his life. And therefore no appreciative heart who looked at this question in this way would ever deny the fact that Christ gave his life to save humanity. This can be the best expression of that appreciation which one can have of that self-sacrif icing soul who proved through his life divinity.

When the My is awake, then it must wander with the body, wherever it will take it. The-sane it22 when the body is asleep23 must go with mind where mind takes it go24. Often 25 . Of course in this connection one must think of that sentence in the Bible: 'Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.' It is not the heart, it is soul there where the treasure is. Is it in Heaven, then it is in Heaven; is it on earth, then it is on earth. If the treasure is in the purse, then the soul is in the purse, if it is in music, poetry, philosophy, thought, then the soul is with26 thought. All one admires, values, loves in life, the soul is with it. If one loves sadness, then the soul is in sadness; if one loves to experience joy, then the soul is joyous. What one seeks after, that is where the soul goes. Yet the soul touches all spheres from the lowest to the highest. Even the soul of the most wicked person, it touches all spheres. Only he does not experience the benefit of it because when he is conscious he is tasting2' wickedness. But when the soul is unconscious and touches the highest, what is 22.

Therefore as it is mentioned in The Message af Spiritual Liberty, there are many paths, even one could never imagine28 that a person could arrive at the same goal. Still the thing is this, that the blessing of life is in the consciousness of thatz9 blessing. When one is not conscious of that blessing, it is nothing. If a kitten is privi- leged to sit on the sofa of the king and is dwelling all the time at30 Buckingham Palace, it is not privileged when it is not conscious of the privilege. Question: Would you tell us how far it is right to take the in- dividual temper3' into account in trying to build character? Answer: I would really, if I were to devise to myself personally I would take extreme measures in keeping individuality pliable, not set to a certain temper31. No doubt individuality is made of a certain temper32, but I would not allow personally to set it to a certain temper32. For another person 1 would not advise towards an extreme measure. I will tell you an33 experience of my own life. Once I began my musical work and having that sensitiveness of an artist, if there was among my audience of five, ten, twenty people one person lacking under- standing or antagonistic to it, it would choke my breast and I would not be able to do anything. I saw it one, two, three times, but how shall 1 do my work? Next day 1 said: 'I shall shake it off, not take it to account. I shall sing for myself; if no one shall enjoy it, I shall still sing. If I was pleased, it is quite enough.' Since that feeling came that artistic temper31 went to pieces. It never came again. It is fighting against temper32. What is temper3'? It is a nature we make. What makes a nature34? We have something of it; in making it we enjoy it. By saying I hate it, I cannot stand, tolerate it, he does not know what he is doing. he has confined35 himself a limitation, a weakness. Why can I not tolerate? Then I cannot tolerate myself. I cannot bear it. Then there will come a day that one cannot bear oneself. It is a terrible fight because the self begins to cry for nights and days.

But they lost consciousness of their soul. The one who is not conscious of his soul, his spirit has lost it, at least from his consciousness.

It cannot arrive in a certain place earlier than in due time. But once he has passed from this plane, he can reach much sooner. The one who is living in the physical body has many more fa- cilities also. Because when a person is face to face with his friend, he can help that friend much more than being hidden from the sight of the friend, who does not see him.

Question: .When one has the intention to do a thing, and a friend wants not to do it, is it best to listen to one's own intuition or to follow the friend's advice?

Whether his intuition is greater as one's own. One cannot take it as a principle to always follow a person's advice. It might seem a virtue, but sometimes it will prove to be otherwise. 5.

The branch has bent and the fruit is touching the earth, but at the same time, it is still in 18, it has not yet lost the connection with the stem. It is that soul which is called deva.

Not only the living creatures but also trees and plants, and planets and stars, everything that exists has a spirit at the back of it, and that spirit is its soul. Question: How can we know that it is the angel of death we see, if we clothe the angel with our imagination? Answer: But what is our imagination? Very often our imagination is inspiration, intuition; especially at1' the time of death a person is pitched to a very high state of being and therefore even a person who did not have much inspiration during his lifetime, has at that time, when he is lifted up already before the breath has left the body, closer to the higher sphere.

Is this not the condition which we see in thez2 human nature? There is no person living on earth of whom all say good things 23and no one says bad thingsz3. soz4 there is no person living, about whom all say bad things and no one says any good; and the most interesting part25 for a keen observer of life is how each tries to prove his argument to be correct. In thez6 sufi2' terms these two are called the angels of khair andz8 khar, and the difference is very little in theirz9 spelling: one is khair and the other is khar. 30~hat shows how30 little difference there is between goodness and badness31. The ancient belief is that immediately after a person32 is buried, these33 two parties of angels come on34 his grave with their records and dispute about him. But do we not see in human nature the same thing? People wait not even until after death; they begin to say 35good things and bad35 things about the person they know, about their friends and foes and dispute over36 them37. 38~here is also an ancient Bk.: \"keep the record of the good deeds and those who record the evil deedsw instead of \"take good record and the ones who take the record of man's bad things\" I bid.: llAlsoll instead of \"Besides\" E.t.: \"recordsw Bk.: viandii added Ibid.: llthell omitted Ibid.: this part of the sentence was omitted E.t.: uAisoll instead of flSo\"; Bk.: l1andn instead of wSoll Bk.: vlpointw instead of \"partn Sk.sh.: \"thel1 crossed out by Sk.; Bk.: \"the\" omitted Bk.: lvSuf1cv1 instead of \"Sufiw E.t., bk.: \"ofv1 added Bk.: vlthen instead of \"theirI1 Ibid.: \"This suggests what a\" instead of I1That shows howl8 Ibld.: added \"as Ornar Khayyam says: 'A hair divides perhaps the false and true, Yes, and a single alif were the clue, Could you but find it, to the Treasure House, And per adventure to the Master too. - Quatrain 1.\"' E.t.: \"the deadt1 instead of I1a persont1; Bk.: l1the dead personv1 E.t.: \"thatv1 instead of llthesell, changed back by Sk. into I1thesew Bk.: \"tot1 instead of \"onI1 Ibld.: l1good things and badN omitted Ibid.: \"aboutf1 instead of Ivoverl1 Ibid.: added I1even during their life-time11 Ibid.: \"The ancient belief wasf1 instead of IvThere is also an ancient beliefvl"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"belief38 that after the dead is39 in40 his grave and buried, 41there come two angels4' to ask him questions and by this cross-e~amination~~ prove their43 contrary arguments true43.

Question: Do the angels who have descended on earth follow the lives of human souls, and take real interest in their affairs, much the same as human souls do among themselves? Answer: No, angels are not interested in the same way as human beings. Because the kind changes, and there is a great gap between them. Their interests are not the same. Therefore if ever angels came on the earth, either they are in touch with the innocent souls of the children, because they are closer, or the interest is in the illuminated soul, the spiritual soul.

It is a most important thing in character building to become conscious of one's relation, obligation2 and duty to each person in the world and not to mix that link and connection which is established between oneself and another with a third person. One must think everything that is trusted to him by every person in life as3 his trust and one must know that to prove true 4to the confidence4 of every person in the world, 5one's sacred obliga- tion. In this manner6,' harmonious connection is established with every person and it is the harmony established with every person which tunes the soul with the Infinite. It requires a great study of human nature together with tact to keep on harmonious terms with every person in life.

It is in this, self-denial is learned; not always by fastingslg and retirements in the wilderness. Man, conscientious of his duty, of his obligations to his friends, is more pious than someone sitting alone in a solitude. The one in the solitude does not serve Cod; he only helps himself by enjoying the pleas- ure of solitude. But the one who proves to be trustworthy to every soul he meets, and considers his relation and connection, small or great, as some- thing sacred, certainly observes the spiritual law of that religion which is the religion of20 religions. Faults, everyone has faults, oneself2 l, one's friend and one's enemy, all are subject to faults. The one who wishes that his own faults may not be22 disclosed, must necessarily consider the same for the other23 he meets.

It is the same bridge which connects two souls in the world, 26when once stretched27 becomes the path to Cod. There is no greater virtue in this world than proving kind and trust- worthy to one's friend, worthy of his confidence.

Answer: I would never say to anybody: go and consider the friend who has ill-treated you. But do what you consider the best. There cannot be one principle for all to follow; for each there is a particular principle. But by considering the main principles of character building, then one will be helped. It does not mean that one should follow exactly these principles which are spoken as character building. But by knowing them, they can be a great help in choosing the best way in dealing with life.

It is this6 divine current which really speaking is nufs, which means7p8 breath or the ego. Breath is the ego and ego is the breath. When the breath has left the body, the ego has gone.

Therefore in the angelg spherelo which is the sphere of radiance, the soul collects the atoms of radiance. A Sufi poet of Persia has given a most beautiful expression in a verset1 of this ideai1.

Even the birth of thought and idea is incomparably small to the life of angels. Question: As man is judged by the God in his own heart, I do not understand what the use is of this outside recording of our actiod5? Answer: But it all goes on in the plane of our life66, even67 of the angels. We are accustomed to put outside, but it all is in our heart, and therefore it is not outside at all; it is in the heart. The heart is a mirror which has two sides. It reflects all that is outside and all that is within. And therefore God and angels, and all that is within, is reflected in the heart, and all that is outside is also reflected, because it has two sides. It is not necessarily a piece of flesh. The heart of flesh is only that part of .the body which was first made, and upon6' the whole body was .formed. And therefore as it was first made, it is more sensitive to the heart which is within than any other organ. And therefore when there is a depression 69 I every little excitement or little\" feeling has a feeling in the heart. 'And because man does not see the heart which is the mirror, but feels it in the heart, even that piece of flesh which one calls the heart, there is the seat of the function, though the soul is incomparably greater than the body. But the body is the seat of it. Therefore man gives a great importance to his body. I bid.: \"planen Ibld.: \"are In each thing.

Answer: Certainly, because the manifestation has begun, has com- menced from the heavenly source, from divine spheres. And therefore every atom of this universe, mental or material, is an outcome of that. And therefore it cannot exist without a part of that heavenly radiance with it. Even an atom of the dust, it has behind it a radiance. And if it were not a radiance, it would not have manifested to our view. We see it because it has light in it. It is its own light that shows it to us, that is its soul. What seems to be void of intelligence is not in reality void of it. Only, intelligence is buried in its heart. It is so to speak: intelligence has projected itself, and then its own out- come has covered it, and buried intelligence in itself. But the intelligence must come out someday. Therefore through all these phases of life it is trying to break out. You can see this in volcanic eruptions, this power, working through the floods, lightning, planets, stars, its desire is to burst out where it is in a way captive.

A person who is on a wrong direction may abuse this great faculty. When a person who is subtle by nature is compared to the personality which is void of it, it is like the river and the mountain. The subtle personality is as pliable as the2 run- ning water; everything that comes before that personality is reflected in it as clearly as the image in the pure3 water. The rock-like personality, void of subtlety, is like a mountain, it reflects nothing. Many admire plain speak- ing, but the4 reason is the lack of understanding the fine subtlety. Can all things be put into words? Is there not anything more fine, more subtle than spoken words? The person who can read between5 lines makes a book6 out of one7 letter. Subtlety of perception and subtlety of expression are the signs of the wise. Wise and foolish are distinguished by fineness on the part of the one, and rigidness on the part of the other. A person void of subtlety wants truth to be turned into a stone; and the subtle one8 will even turn a stone into truth.

For asll further in the path of life's mystery a person will sojourn12, the more subtle he will have to become in order to perceive and to express the mystery of life. Cod is a mystery; His knowledge is a mystery. Life is a mystery; human nature is a mystery. In short, depth of all knowledge is a mystery. Even the13 science or art, all that is more mysterious is more deep. What all the Prophets and Masters have done in all ages is14 to express that mystery in words, in deeds, in thoughts, in feelings; but most of the mystery is expressed by them in silence. For then the mystery is in its place. To bring down the mystery to the ground is like pulling down a king on to the ground from his throne. But allowing the mystery to remain in its own place in the silent spheres, is like giving homage to the King to whom all homage is due. Life's mysteries15 apart, in little things of everyday life, the less words used the more profitable it is. Do you think more words explain more? No, not at all. It is only a16 nervousness on1' the part of those who wish to say a hundred words to explain a thing which can quite well be explained in two words. And on the part of the listener it is the18 lack of intelligence when he wants a hundred words in order to understand something which can just as well be explained in one word. Many think that more words explain things better. But they do not know that most often as many moretg words spoken, so many veils wrapped around the idea.

In spiritual ideas and thoughts subtlety is more needed than in anything else. If a spiritual person were to bring his realizations at 25 the marketplace and dispute with everyone that came along about his beliefs and disbeliefs, where would he end? What does make a spiritual person har- monize with all people in the world? The key to the art of reconciliation that a spiritual souI26 has, is subtlety in both perception and expression. Is it lack of frankness? Is it hypocrisy to be subtle? Not in the least. There are many people who are outspoken, 27ready to tell the truth as hitting the head of another person, who proudly support their frankness by saying: ' I do not mind if it makes anybody sorry or angry. I only tell the truth.' If the truth is as hard as a hammer, may truth be never spoken! May no one in the world follow such 28 truth! Then, what 29 is that truth which is peace-giving, which is healing, which is comforting30 every heart and soul? That truth which3' 32 the soul, that truth which is creative of harmony and33 beauty, where is that truth born? That truth is born in subtlety of intelligence, in thought, speech and action, of 34 fineness which brings pleasure, comfort, beauty, harmony and peace. Question: Will t~ou35 explain that the heart of man is the heart of the universe? Answer: In the heart of man the whole universe is reflected, and as the whole universe is reflected in the heart of man, it may be called the heart of the universe. Question: What is the heart and what is the soul? Answer: Suppose, if we take a lamp, a burning lamp as a picture of human being. The flame is the soul, and the globe is the heart. The inner part of the globe is called heart, the outer part is the mind, and the shade over the lamp is the body. Ibld.: \"atv1 changed by Gd.

So is a soul who may be a young person and yet he may have a greater understanding because of37 his soul being ripe. Question: How can one cultivate this s~btleness~~; I thought one was born with it, and could not acquire it? Answer : If one knows how wonderful is the life of man, of whom God says that ' I have created man on My own Image'; is there anything which is not in Cod? If all things are in God, then all things are in man, whom He has made on His own image. No doubt, the things that he tries to acquire he is able to acquire them better; the things that he neglects, he does not 39 often seen4' people with intelligence, with brain, yet unwilling to trouble their brain very much; for they do not want to trouble, it is not that they cannot understand. If they can get it easily explained by someone, they do not want to trouble. Very often one sees that. And therefore subtlety is a fineness. Such fineness can be acquired by the love of fineness. Not only in human character, but in every- thing. An artist, if an artist has not the love of subtlety, it will only be on the surface. It will become living if he has subtlety in his nature. So with poetry. If the poet only writes words, nothing behind it, that does not give life, that is only the structure. What makes a verse beautiful? Twist. A person could write five lines and make the soul dance at its fineness, subtlety. Another person will write41 hundred letters, it means nothing; too many words, only tiredness is the result of it. The book of Rumi has lived hundreds of years, the interest is always growing. Why? Because there is subtlety from the be- ginning to the end. When one does not take the trouble to cul- tivate fineness in nature and subtlety in perception and expression, it is just like a stubborn4* child, who wants his 36. Sk.l.tp.: llunrlpell 37.

A subtle person is only a conscien- tious person; a person on his guard, who has taken the life as a horse, he has the rein in his hand; who makes it dance when he wants it to dance, lets it go slowly when he wants. A dancer, a poet, a singer, in every aspect, in all one does, subtlety pro- duces beauty. Subtlety is the curl of the beloved, used by Omar Khayyam and most of the Sufi poets. Question: How is the periodic coming and going of events, cataclysms, wars, et~.~~ to be explained, as well as the fact of the possibility of purely mathe- matical reading of all life in astrology? These things seem to speak in favour of the idea that all life is an automatically running clock, and that there is no liberty of action and thought. (Death of44 babe or child.) What is the sense of a human being dying before it has reached a certain development? It seems a great waste of energy, and a great sufferance in vain. Answer : The first question in which it is asked if the whole uni- verse is going on automatically and there is no free will, the answer is that: yes, a man is born in a universe which is going on automatically, and he is born helpless. Therefore it is true that the condition is such. But what the child is born with? He is born with a desire to do as he wills. This desire is the proof of there being a free will. A free will which is put to test under all opposing conditions and influences, which the soul meets with through life. And to rise above all the opposing in- f~uence~~ and to give the fullest expression to the free will brings about that result of life which is the fulfilment of the soul's coming on earth. The second question. The reason of many things having sprung out of this automatically working universe, such as the birth of a babe who has passed soon after, and one does not see the reason behind it. But in this case we must understand that although outwardly it is automatically working, inwardly there is Cod. There is no mechanism without an engineer. Only the 43.

There is a very interesting story told in the Arabic Scriptures, 26that Cod made lblis the head-ef-u++-ange+l chief among angels and then told him to bring some clay, that He might make out of it an image28.

I have said that the enjoyment through the senses made the soul come into the body. It would not have entered otherwise. Because through the senses the physical life became intelligible to the soul, and therefore thisg9 intoxicated the soul so that it entered the body. But there is one question: that before entering the body, how did it experience the senses? First it experienced the senses through the sense of other mediums, those who are in the body; as the child shares the food of mother before birth, so it experiences through the senses before its own senses have developed. Question: Then the desire is to have for itself 100 Answer: Yes. Question: Does it get more enjoyment by the senses on earth than it would without them in Heaven? Answer: Certainly. Because the enjoyment that the soul gets here on earth by the medium of senses is just like the wine touched to the lips. It is an illusion, it is no wine. As the world is illu- sive, so enjoyment is the same. They have never made one happy, nor will they ever make one happy forever.

Not only open, but dependent for its external life on104 the food of the earth and the water. As itslo5 life depends upon the things of the earth, it still seeks for the pleasures of the earth. The more close to Heaven a person is drawn, the less important the pleasures of the earth become. All that seems to be pleasure fades away; it has no colour, no taste any more. Therefore the religions have taught self -denial by denying all the pleasures of the earth. But I think a soul which naturally rises towards Heaven does not need to practise self-denial. It comes by itself as the soul grows and rises towards Heavens. Question: Was not the question of a soul who had not yet mani- fested? Why a soul should leave the greater hap- piness of Heaven for earth1 y pleasures-- lo6which is so much greater106? Answer: The idea is that the tendency of every motive is to go to the utmost point, forlo7 the farthest point, whether in its result it gives happiness or unhappiness. The tendency of the one who has every motive, will experience it to its final result. For instance a singer sings. He very comfortably sings on the lower note. His heart's desire is to go as high as he can go. He may take a chance of breaking his voice, lo8 but his tendency is to go to the highest note.

That shadow is of something that the soul does not know, something that is strange to the soul. For instance take a person who has never learned to swim, near the water; he is not acquainted with the water, he is not at ease there. There is his fear. Another person gets rid of that strange feeling, knows his own power over the water; he has no more fear. Therefore fear comes by ignorance.

' There are two attitudes which divide people into two sections. The one attitude is an ever-complaining attitude, and the other attitude is an ever- smiling attitude. Life is the same, call it good, call it bad, call it right or call it wrong. It is what it is, it cannot be otherwise. A person in order to get the sympathy of others, and in order to show his good points to others, sometimes in order to show himself more just, more intelligent and on2 the right, he3 complains. He complains about everything, about friends and about foes, about those he loves and much more so4 about those he hates. He com- plains from morning till evening, and there is never an end to his complaint. It can increase to such an extent that the weather is not good, and the air is not good, and the atmosphere is not good. He is against earth and sky both. Everything everybody does is wron . Until it develops to such a stage that man begins to dislike his own wordsf and it culminates when he dislikes himself. In this way one6 becomes against others, against conditions, and in the end against himself. Do not imagine that this is a character rarely to be found in the world; it is a character you frequently meet with. And certainly the one who has this attitude is his worst enemy. The person with a right attitude of7 mind tries to make wrong even right, but the one with a wrong attitude of mind will turn even right into wrong. Besides, magnetism is something which is the need of every soul. The lack of it makes life burdensome. The tendency of seeing wrong in every- Notes: This lecture was first published in the book Character-Buading. The Art of Personality (1931), chapter VI of the first part.

For the nature of life is such that by nature the life of the multitude repdses throws out everyone and accepts only those who enter the multi- tude with the power of magnetism. In other words, the world is a place where you cannot enter without a pass of admission; and that pass of admis- sion is magnetism. The one who does not possess it, will be refused every- where. Besides, many you will find who complain always about their health. There may be a reason, and sometimes there may be a very little reason, too little indeed to speak of. And when once a person has become accustomed to answer in the negative, when sympathetically asked: 'How are you?', he certainly waters the plant of illness in himself by the complaining tendency. Our life of limitation in the world, and the nature of this world's comforts and pleasures which are so changeable8 and unreliable, and the falsehoodg that one finds in everything, everywhere, if one complained about it all the life time1' would be too short to complain about it fully. Every moment of our life would become filled with complaints. But the way out of it is to look at the cheerful side of it, the bright side of it. Especially those who seek Cod and truth, for them there is something else to think about. They need not think how bad the person is; when they think who is behind this person, who is inll the heart of the person, then they will look at life hepe+d+y with hope. When we see things wrong, if we only give thought12 that behind all workings there is Cod, Who is just and perfect, we certainly then will become hopeful. The attitude of looking at everything with a smile is the sign of the saintly soul. A smile given to a friend, a smile given even to an enemy will win him over in the end; for that13 is the key to the heart of man. As the sunshine from without lights the whole world, so the sunshine from within, if it was raised, would illuminate the whole life, in spite of all the seem'ing wrongs and in spite of all limitations. Cod is happiness, soul is happiness, 14spirituality15 is happiness14. There is no place for sadness in the kingdom of Cod. That which deprives man of happiness, deprives him fromi6 Cod and from16 truth. One can begin to learn to smile by appreciating every little good thing that comes in one's way throu h life, and by overlooking every bad thing that one does not like to see; '$by not troubling1' too much about unneces- Sk.sh.: the sh. sign for \"~hangeable'~ was put between brackets by Sk. together with the same word in Ih.; Ail other documents: '~changeablev E.t., bk.p., bk.: \"faisenesst~ I bid.: '~llfetlmeu E.t.: \"inN omitted, but reinserted by Sk.

In that light many flowers grow and many fruits become ripe. Question: \"Thou shalt not kill, and2' love thy neighbour as thyself\", is written in the Bible.

If the revolver or sword were not used at all, it is a beautiful thing, but what would happen? All human beings should think as a saint thinks?

Because in that way you are in harmony with nature. In the new moon the nature is progressive, 77the waning moon, 78declining. The new moon is the day of nature, the waning moon is the night.

You can quite see that the words of the Lord, given three hundred years before Saint Paul and then brought to him, and then different versions and interpretations in different languages, all these things we must take into consideration. If I were to give an interpreta- tion of this, I should say: 'Let us not be led into temptation.' Question: How must we explain: \"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us\"? And if we do not forgive? Answer: This is a suggestion that 'forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those,' it only means that we are trying to forgive others for their trespasses, and so we expect that You will forgive us also.

Question: Would you tell us if souls remain a very long time on the angel-61 and jinn-plane on the return jour- ney, as they do on the way to manifestation? Answer: Yes, certainly. Free will is the basis of the whole life. In spite of all limitations and helplessness that man meets through life there is a wonderful power in man's soul if it was discov- ered. That what makes man .helpless is the ignorance of the power of free will in him. It is Cod-power. Therefore.it is most wonderful power. It is the ignorance of this which keeps man \"in darkness as regard to his divine heritage; and every difficulty he meets with through life, owing to the life's limi- tations, covers that divine spark of free will which is in him, and in time it becomes obscure to his view, which culminates into the tragedy of life.

Some do more than the others. But as I have said, I shall repeat it a thousand times: 'Not only the souls, 63angel's, jinn's souls, human being63, but even the and birds, trees and plants, and the smallest germ and insect, they all have a spiritual fulfilment in their life. And if that would not have been in their life, the life would have been a waste. No creature that has ever been born on earth will be deprived of that spiritual bliss, however bad or wrong that person may seem to be. It is only a matter of time, and a difference of process through which one has to touch it. As I have said that, as human beings with their different plane65 of evolution will have a moment, a day, when they will touch that spiritual bliss, so even the animals, carnivorous or herbivorous, birds or insects, they all have a moment, a moment of promise. And that promise is the fulfilment of the promise of their life. Even if an insect has been born for one moment, but the pur- pose of that moment has been accomplished. And by this we understand that there is nothing in this world which is here without a purpose. And by this we learn that although our place in the scheme of life and our work in this plan of the whole universe may seem different one from the other, yet in the sum total of things we all, as the lower creation, together with jhs and angels, have one and the same result, and that result is the realization of truth, in greater or smaller degree, and which comes to all in the form of bliss. Question: Is it true that animals have a group soul? Not each a soul? Answer: That is a conception of some people, but there is one and there are many. These two things must be understood. In the manifestation there are many, in truth there is one. In fact there are many, in truth there is one. For instance, there is a rise and fall of a nation; and there is a prosperity and declin- ing of a race; and so there is also the birth and death of a world. But at the same time with all these grou souls we all are individual entities, and so with the animal6'. And at the same time we are one; we become one as race, as the whole world. In this sense if a person will make a speculation of the animals having a group soul, he may. But in the point of fact every animal, tree, plant has its own soul and spirit. They may call it by a different name. One might see in the form of a group soul, as France as a nation has its good or bad 66 . 63.

The best way of working in all directions of life, at home or outside, is the noiseless working: a thing which so little is2 thought of by many and which is so much3 necessary in creating order, harmony and peace in life. Very often a person does4 little and speaks much about it. In doing every little thing one makes noise and thereby very often, instead of finishing a thing successfully, one attracts difficulties. The first thing that is to be remembered in character building is to understand the nature-and secret and character of human nature. We must know that every person in the world has his own object in life, his own interest, and his own5 point of view,, and he is concerned with himself. His peace is disturbed when you wish to interest him in your object of interest, if you wish to force upon him your point of view. However near and dear he may be to you, he is not pleased with it. Very few consider this, and6 wish to pour out their own troubles and difficulties upon someone, standing next to them, thinking that7 'everyone has the same interest in my object8 as I myself,' and thatg 'everyone has the same point of view as 11° myself,' lithat 'everyone will be glad to hear meI2 8 .

He in the end finished the story by telling the person who spoke to him that15 'When I do not care to know about my own ancestors, what do I care to know about your ancestors?' There are many who are very enthusiastic to let their neighbours know about every cold and cough they had6; every little gain or loss, however small, they would be glad to announce with drums and bugles. This is a17 child- like18 quality. This tendency shows a child soul. Sometimes such a tendency frightens away friends and helps the foes. People with noisy working accom- plish little. For 19being attracted9 by their noise ten more people to come and interfere and spoil the work which one person could have easily fin- ished. Noisiness comes from restlessness. And restlessness is the sign of tamas, the destructive rhythm. Those who have made any success in life, in whatever direction, it is by their quiet working. In business, in industry, in art, in science, in education, in politics, in all directions of life, a wise worker is the quiet worker. He tells about thedo wher?l time comes, not before. The one who talks about things before he has accomplished thed2 is like a cook who is announcing abouG3 dishes before they are cooked, through the whole 24 . There is a story told in the East of an enthusiastic servant. The master had a headache, and he told the servant to go and fetch a medicine from the chemist. The servant thought it would not be sufficient only to bring25 a medicine, on1g6 from the chemist. So he made also an appointment with the doctor, and on his way home he visited the undertaker. The master asked: 'Why are you so late?' The servant said: 'Sir, I haveZ7 arranged every- thing.' Enthusiasm is a great thing in life. It is creative, and it is a key to success. But too much of it sometimes spoils things. The more wise a person, the more gentle he is in everything he does.

Question: Do the jinns know their own imagination as imagina- tion or as external things? Answer: The ego is at the back of everything. Their mind is more capable of knowing2. They have more innocence and less wisdom. Notes: 1. Gd.hwr.copy: nsometimesm added 2.

Answer: There have been times when man lived much longer than now. Life is not meant to be painful and yet in human life one experiences pain in everything, pain in birth and in death. It should not be, it comes from artificial life, from unnatural state of living; he has gone far beyond the normal state of living. Question: Do jinns communicate with spirits returned from experiencing the earth? Answer: Yes, sometimes they do communicate, 4but they are in their own surroundings much happier. They do not like it, it destroys their knowledge and their peace, it is not agreeable to them.4 Question: What is meant by the Greek saying: \"Those the Gods 1 ove die young\"? Answer: It is 5an exaggeration; saying5 it only means that even in the death of young people there is the love of Cod, there is something better for them, which those at this side do not know. 3.

In breathing after every 3/4 of an hour there comes a short time when breath changes and then there also is Kemal. So certain time in a day a person feels lazy, depressed or confused, for that is the outcome of Kemal. Kemal has no tendency to action4. Certain days come in the week when a person with all his enthusiasm does not wish to work, that is Kemal. In some people's life Kemal obsesses them6, they don't see the way, they feel the whole life as a stillness, eve- rything seems so still and without movement. This is a deplor- able state, and it results in a kind of insanity, he wants to commit suicide. In other forms of insanity there is an inclina- tion to fight (another); there is hope because there is action. The cause of this insanity is disorder of breath; if that person would breathe rightly, he would be cured. He requires balance in breath. There is a good type of Kemal also, and that is in equilibrium, which is to be seen in the sage. When the switch is closed, the electric light goes out. So when the sage brings out the Kemal, he closes the switch, that means closes the action of mind for that time. He does it by his will, he needs the time of quiet. When one feels this inertia (the ordinary person) must not give way, for it is like death of mind. Question: Must one not go against this inertia? Answer: No, it is no use to fight it. But give them some interest. The world has so many beautiful things in poetry, music, nature. 6.

When this3 tendency is abused it develops into inquisitiveness. It is wonderful to think4 that the-eti.gin-a+-& at5 the root of all defects is a right tendency. And it is the abuse6 which turns it into a 7wrong tendency7. 8~hen we consider8 how little time we have to live on this earth, 9we would see findg that every moment of our life is precious and that it should be given to something which is really worthwhile. When thislo time is given to inquisitiveness, wanting to know about lthe affairs of anotherll, one has wasted that time which could have been used for a much better purpose.

Free will is given to attain15 to one's own duties, to gain one's own objects, to attend to one's own affairs. And when that16 free will is used in trying to find out about others, the weakness17 of others, the lacks of others, the faults of others, l8then hel8 certainly abuses the free will. Sometimes a person is inquisitive because lgthere is lghis interest in the lives of others. But very often a person is inquisitive because it is his ill- ness. He may have no interest in the matter at all, only because he wants to satisfy himself by hearing and knowing about others. Self-knowledge is the ideal of the philoiophers, not the knowledge 200f the lives of20 the21 others. There are two phases in the development of man; one phase when he looks at others; another phase when he looks at himself. When the first phase has ceased, and the next phase begun, then one starts his journey to the desired goal. Rumi says: 'Trouble not about others, for there is much for you to think for yourself.' Besides this22, this is a sign of great respect to the aged and to those one wishes to respect, to show no tendency of know- ing more than one is allowed to know. Even in such close relationship23 as parents and as24 children, when they respect the privacy of one another they certainly show there a great virtue. To want to know about another is very often a lack of trust. he^^ one who trusts does not need to unveil, does not need to uncover26 what is covered. He who wishes to unveil some- thing, he27 wishes to discover it. If there is anything that should be first discovered, it is the self. The time that one28 spends in discovering others, their lives, their faults, their weakness1', one could 29have just as well 29 in discovering one's soul. The desire to know is born in the soul.

Why does the dizziness come? Because the earth attracts one7. It is quite possible that that attraction would become so great that they would be without control or resistance8 and would jump down. Because it is a kind of magnet which is attracting him with power. Then a man holds himself back from it, with force, not to jump. Wherever there is a gap and there is an attraction, there is that feeling. I have very often met people who, as soon as the philosophical ideas began, and the relation between God and man, that person gets so afraid, there comes that feeling of dizziness. Because he cannot deny the truth of it. But he wants to save his life from the attraction. It is the fear of a gap, of a wide horizon which a person is not accus- tomed to see. But it is a matter of getting accustomed. There are builders of houses, they stand on the highest top of the house, especially in America; there they are working and from there look down and move about; they do not fearg, they have become accustomed. It is exactly the same with the sage, the thinkers. The picture of the workers on the high.10 houses is the same picture of the sage who looks at what may be called the life on the surface and the eternal life. What people call death becomes a bridge for him. The more he thinks of it, the less fear he has. There is a saying of a Sufi: 'Wali has no fear of death,' he loses the fear of death. Question: The col our of flame is red or yell ow? l2 Answer: Flame is not heat. It is the glow which is heat. Flame is only a light. The real heat is in the glow. If one catches the glow the hand burns, not if one touches the flame. In other words, one may say: the red fire covered by yellow. Question: And the blue in the flame?

The body is composed by the atoms from l9 which the body exists; in the physical world, physical atoms, attracted by some secret cur- rent. That secret current is the soul. There is, in one globe there is another globe. There is something within the body but at the same time it is all collected and gathered by20 that current which is within.

Question: From where the fear of death comes? ~nswer:' Ignorance of the self gives the fear of death. The more one learns from the self, the less fear of death there is. The more one lives in his soul, the less hold one has upon the body. The body has fear according to the consciousness it has in itself. Man is not only dependent upon his mind for thought, but every atom of the body is to some extent conscious, and it protects itself. Man must learn to control his consciousness and then he can raise it. When a person is conscious of headache, he feels headache, but when asleep, then he is not conscious of head- ache and does not feel it. If a person could collect his con- sciousness automatically and raise it step by step by the power of will, he would rise above pain. The degree of consciousness in the atoms is dependent upon the soul. Note: 1. This could well be the answer to the last but one question after the lec- ture llTasawwuf.

And what is the result of unity? The result of unity is equality. No sooner 4the unity has4 illuminated the heart of man, realizes equality. Therefore before us there is a task to perform and that taskI6 to give in our lives the example of that equality which we wish may be spread throughout the world. No doubt to arrive to7 this ideal the process we take is different from the process of those who do not tread our path. when8 people wish to bring about the idea of equality with the idea of individuality, we want to bring about this idea of equality with the idea of unity. Therefore the idea is the same, the method is different. But the first thing is that this idea must be realized and used in our own circle, and in9 this ideal it must be practised, thatlo it gives the example which is needed at present in the world. How l lthe others are1 l practising12 mostly ? Violently, crudely, thoughtlessly. The manner that we have adopted is the manner of art, beauty, love, harmony, and the unity of God. Now coming to the Message.

The religion or the form or the Scripture or any- thing else was secondary. The teaching of Jesus Christ was, 'love your neighbur, love your fellowman'; and it is this principle that we must cling to, because this is the central theme of every divine Message, whenever and13 whatever period it has come to the world. Now, our difficulties in bringing it 14abut to practise14 are number- less. I5Our own methods may seem to be different in our Cause. But this difficulty will always remain tilli6 the idea is not understood clearly. Now, for instance, havingi7 different grades of those who are ordained and initi- ated, and18 who are given different names. We have the distinctionlg of the robes given to them. But it must be understood that a robe or a name is not given to any soul in order to distinguish themz0 as superior to the others. Not at all. We are all equal, and we shall all stand equal before Cod, the humblest among us and someone among us who is full of faults and errors. We have the same place to standz1 and the same Cod to face and we shall stand shoulder to shoulder. Every mureed of the Sufi Order, everyone who is there, with all his faults and errors, whatever is his stage or degree out- wardly, his soul, his heart, it all makes us equal. We all stand before Cod with our love for one another as brothers and sisters. If the robes and22 names make any distinction, it is the distinction of the office, it is the duty, it is the service that they have to perform. Remember therefore that it would not be right on our part to distinguish among such grades or degrees or names or robes which is which, who is higher, who is lower, who is great- er, who is smaller. For in the eyes of Cod there is no one superior, no one inferior, and His one glance of favour can raise a person from the depth of the earth to the highest Heavens, and His displeasure, the slightest displeas- ure can cloud all man's goodness and piety and spirituality. What is it? It is nothing before Cod. Therefore the humblest of us, the most modest among us, the most insignificant, we must not think that because he has no robe, he is not spiritual. Perhaps he is the most spiritual among us. What do we know? The spiritual idea is too sacred to talk about, and it is a subject which is too delicate to discuss. And those who tread the spiritual path, for them the first lesson to learn is that humility and that respect for every soul, however backward in spiritual evolution apparently he seems.

When we have to cross the ocean, we must build a ship to journey33. Even for the soul, which is divine, that soul had34 to experience life on the earth, it35 had to adopt an earthly body, it is a necessity. Therefore by our Movement in the world 36we are not building a ,36 we are building an organisation which is necessary, and yet we ought to be careful that the organisation may not blind us, and veil our eyes from the Truth which is before us. And when there is an organisa- tion of the workers, of the servers, it is necessary that those who are ap- pointed on37 certain duties they ought to be recognised as such. This is the army to serve humanity and God.

Therefore if we understand that clearly, then there will be no need that4' any feeling of ri- valry, or envy, or jealousy, or pride, or superiority, or inferiority is41 among us.

Question: Answer: This creation does not bring something new to Cod, only it makes Him conscious of what He is . It is most inter- esting to watch how that nature of Cod works in man. For in- stance sometimes a person begins to walk in the room or to play the drum or look up and down, and there is no need for it. Why he does it? Because the absence of action has an effect of paralysing the activity of mind and when the absence of activity has paralysed mind, then the soul begins to feel lonely, it begins to wonder whether it is living or not living. And when it begins to tap or to walk, then it realizes: 'No, no, I am livingl', because it lives in the outward consciousness of life.

Sr.: a version so different from the one In Gd.ih.r., that it Is quoted here in full: \"The consciousness must have something to become conscious of, otherwise it is conscience in essence. A man who is in a dark room with his eyes open--that does not mean that he does not see because his eyes are In- capable of seeing, but it means that there is nothing to be seen then. Though the eyes have the capability of seeing, there is nothing to become conscious of seeing. So creation makes God conscious of what He is, con- scious of Himself. it is most interesting to see how the nature of God works in man. Sometimes a person walks without reason or plays with his fingers a drum on the table or rubs himself without there is a need for it. Why does he do it? Because the absence of action has an effect of paralyzing the activity of the mind. So the soul begins to feel lonely and to wonder whether it is living .or not, and wants to be sure of its iife. So by some little action it knows it lives In outward sensation and its out- ward sensation gives it consciousness of its iife. This thought will give the deepest knowledge possible. God's desire is to feel Himself.\""},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"Question: Is it rest1 essness? lo3 Answer: lo4 Question: lo5 Answer: There are two things, there is weakness and there is strength. lo6when a person is weak, his body once put in motion acts and acts without any control.

Question: As music plays an important part in the higher spheres, should it not be good to have music in the education and to teach it every day, before the beginning of every other thing? Answer : I believe so. I think music can be the foundation in train- ing of children and on that foundation, whatever is built will stand firm. Life is rhythm and life is tone. What is music? Music is rhythm and tone, and if a child learns music, he learns the divine language. And if1 child has intuition later2 in life whatever work he does, he will express in some way that which has been the foundation of his character, in other words his life will become music. Question: Why must certain things about the Message and the Sufi Movement not be talked about? Why this se- cretness?

Summer School Suresnes, August 25th, 1923 Character ~uildin~.~ It must be remembered that one shows the2 lack of nobleness in the character by his love for gossip3. It is so natural, and yet it is a great fault in the character to cherish the tendency of talking about others. 41n the first place4 it is a great weakness one shows when one passes5 remarks about someone at6 his back. In the first place it is against what may be called frankness, and besides it is judging another, which is wrong according to the teaching of Christ, who says: 'Judge ye not, lest ye be judged.' When one allows this tendency to remain in one, one develops love of talking about others. It is a defect which commonly exists. And when two people meet who have the same tendency together they complete gossip. One helps the other, one encourages the other7. And when something is supported by two people, it of necessity becomes a virtue, even if it were for the time being. How often man forgets that, although he is talking about someone in his absence, but8 it is spoken in the presence of God. Cod hears all things and knows all things. The Creator knows about His creatures, about their virtues and faults. God is as9 displeased by hearing about the fault of His creature as an artist would be displeased on hearing bad remarks made by anyone on his art.

Answer: There is always 70 a saying of Qur'an which even the MS. 71 have misinterpreted: 'The creation has come out of darkness.' The soul is not always coming with open eyes. It is coming with closed eyes, the picture of which the infant shows, whose eyes open afterwards. But at the same time to compare our condition with other condition needs that one is familiar with conditions and that time comes after being born. If this ques- tion will be considered more deeply, one will come to a very great realization of secret of life and especially of good for- tune and bad fortune 72 that it is not always a design in which soul is so limited that it cannot get out of that, but that every soul makes for itself a condition, even after coming on earth. Are there not thousands who live in miserable, in bad conditions because they have known no better. If known better, would have mana ed to become better. This rule applies to (many persons)\" in life . 74 Most of rea- sons of misery are in own ignorance. If they knew how to combat, how to get out of misery, there are many doors (many ways to get out of it).

Summer School Suresnes, August 27th, 1923 Character ~uildin~.' The spirit of generosity in nature builds a path to God. For generosity is outgoing, is spontaneity. Its nature is to make its way towards2 a wide horizon. Generosity, therefore, may be called charity of heart. It is not necessary that the spirit of generosity must be always shown by the spend- ing of money. In every little thing one can show it. Generosity is an atti- tude which one shows in every little action that he does towards2 people that he comes in contact3 in his everyday life. One can show generosity by a , smile, by a kind glance, by a warm handshake, by a patting the younger soul4 5with a patting5 of encouragement, 6with the patting6 of showing appreci- ation, 7with that patting which7 expresses8 affection. Generosity one can show in accommodating one's fellow man, in welcoming one's fellow man, in bidding farewell to one's friend; in thought, word and deed, in every manner and form one can show that generous spirit which is the sign of the W& godly. The Bible speaks of generosity by the word charity. But if I were to give an interpretation of the word generosity, I would call it nobility. No rank, position or power can prove one noble. Truly noble is he who is gener- ous of heart. What is generosity? It is nobility, it is expansion of heart. As the heart expands, so the horizon becomes wide; and one finds greater and greater scope in which to build the kingdom of God. Depression, despair and all manner of sorrow and sadness come from the lack of generosity. Where Notes: This lecture was first published in the book Character-Building.

The life in the world offers every opportunity to man, whatever be his position in life, to show if he has any spirit of generosity. The changeableness and falsehood of human nature, besides1' inconsideration and thoughtlessness that corne12 out of those that13 he meets through life, and furthermore the selfishness and grabbing and grafting spirit that disturbs and troubles his soul, this situ- ation itself is a test and trial through which every soul has to pass in the midst of the worldly life. ,4nd14 through this test and trial one holds fast to his principle of charity and treads along towards2 his destination, not allow- ing the influences that come from the four corners of the world to keep him back from his journey to the goal; he in the end becomes the king of life, if in the end of his destination, if there was not left one single earthly -coin to his name.

Sometimes it seems that most undeserving become enti- tled to a privilege. There is a story of the Prophet's passing to the other world. That the day when Mahornmed was leaving this world he went to join the last prayers at the Mosque. And after the prayers were finished he gave an address. In that address he mentioned that the Call has come from above, that he had fulfilled his mission and that he had to leave. And it produced a great panic among his devotees. There were many who were greatly devoted to him. And he said, if he had ever spoken at any time in the slightest degree to the displeasure of a person, that person may return it in hundredfolds. Or if he has28 borrowed from anyone anything, they must ask him to return it to them, that as he was on the journey. And if he ever had insulted anyone, that he asked them to please return it in hundredfolds and if he hasz8 in any way done any hurt or harm of any kind, that he would like it to be done to him before he left. The devotion and respect that the disciples had for the Prophet was so great that, asking for anything like this apart, they were all choked up, they had no words to express to the Prophet their gratitude. But there was one man, unre- fined, and yet ambitious, stood up and said: 'Prophet, I re- member that one day yourself touched me with a whip; and as it is your order, now I shall do it.' Prophet said: 'I do not re- member, but I am very glad, you may do it ten times more.' And the panic was still greater in the Mosque. And this man came with his whip near the Prophet, and said: 'It was on my bare back.' So the Prophet had to remove his shirt. Instead of a whip he kissed the back of the Prophet, because he had believed that there was a seal of Prophetship on the back. It was his belief; and in order to have that privilege, he had to make up that story. It was arrogance outwardly but devotion inwardly.

Question: Why does part of the light become rays or human souls and other part remain plants and animals? Answer: No, I did not mean that the other part remains plants and animals. I have only said that where there is no individual appearance, a separate appearance, but where there is a mass of matter before us, as a lake or river, mountain, there we see the light of the same divine Sun 75 in its radiant form, there is intelligence also. But the ray is a kind of straight living current, and it is this living current, functioning into76 more developed body77 is able to produce that experience which is the fulfilment of the whole creation. As soon as the trees begin to appear as separate trees7', no doubt they7' are separate rays; it is most difficult to differentiate rays from the light, and light from the rays; it is more for our conven- ience. Through the rays it is more distinct, more separate; in the form of light it is more together. And therefore all that is before our eyes as something connected together, that is the of that light; and all that shows outs' as an entity, that is expressive of the ray. But at the same time one must remember that the truth cannot be put into words. What one can do is to make as much as possible an effort to make the mystery of life more intelligible to the mind; therefore 'light' and 'ray' and 'sun' are used.

If we picture it as a divine rain, then this divine rain falling in the form of light, takes in everything that is there, and raises out of it all that comes. Question: Can you83 explain when and how the difference in the development of the soul comes in the different kingdoms? Answer: I really cannota4 Question: How can you see the kingdom of God in all the man- ifestation? Answer: If you develop your eyes to see, you can see. For instance what man thinks, he sees; all man sees is his own thought. Man can produce out of his thought a ghost or a satad5 or a devil. And out of his thought he can produce Cod, the most Merciful and Compassionate. When man has come to the realization 82.

If the degree of the light of a soul was not developed to a certain mark of the body, that it would meet on its way to expression, It would not take It and would only be attracted to another body, with another mark. There are numerous differences between the rays. Rays are first expressed and then they fall upon all that meets them. The differ- ences of the rays are, they are not of the same grade of intenseness, of Illumlnatlon, of expresslon. Souls are first expressed, there Is nothing to attract them. Then Influences come and the souls go where they are attracted, to the mineral, the vegetable, the animal or the human king- dom.

Question: Is the attraction from the body towards the ray or soul entirely by accident? Is there not an ele- ment of justice? (gap of reincarnation) Answer: The idea of justice is based upon good and bad. Where there is justice, there is injustice, that means there are two. Truth is only one. The idea of justice and injustice is from man's conception. When a person rises above justice and injus- tice, which is subject to change in his every evolution, but when he gets above this, he will reach the knowledge of truth. Fairness and unfairness belong to our particular evolution. The less intelligent, the more fairness and unfairness man sees and thinks about. A stupid person is always ready to judge. In Heaven there is only one truth, and truth is one, and where there is no comparison there is no fairness and no unfairness. Something is greater than fairness and unfairness and that is the truth. It cannot be explained. l~ruth cannot be acquired, only disc0vered.l Man is not born with judging. Question: Is the doctrine of reincarnation not a missing link in the understanding of the attraction of the rays by the different kingdoms? Answer: Sufism is not against any doctrine. A message which has come to reconcile must it oppose any doctrine? In India you will hardly find a man speaking about reincarnation. He will only speak about the result of the karma. All we have learned about reincarnation comes from theosophical sides. If you ask a Yogi about it, he says: 'No, I am starving for mukti - for freedom, it is you who will be born again.' To whom he points you? The Buddhist also says that Buddha has never spoken Notes: 1.

Sa'adi says: 'The sun and moon, and the rain and clouds, all are busy to prepare your food for you.' And it is unfair indeed if you do not appreciate it in thanksgiving. Cod's goodness is something that one cannot learn at once to know. It takes time to understand it. But little actions of kindness which we receive from those around us we can know, and we can be thankful, if we wanted to be. In this way man develops gratefulness in his nature, and expresses16 in his thought, speech and action, as an exquisite form of beauty. As long as one weighs and measures, and says: 'What I have done for you and what you have done for me' and 'how kind I have been to you and how good you have been to me,' he wastes his time17 en over something which is inexpressible in words. Besides he closes by this that fountain of beauty which rises from the l8stream of gratefulness18. The first lesson in the path of thankfulness that we can learn is to forget absolutely what we do for anotherlg; remember only what the other person has done for us. Throughout the whole journey intoz0 the spiritual path the main thing 21that isz1 to be accomplished is the for etting of our false ego. That in this way we \"might arrive in some way tof2 the realization of that Being Whom we call Cod.

This made many jealous of a35 sudden rise of Ayaz from a slave to a treasurer of the king, a position which many envied. No sooner people knew36 that Ayaz became37 a favour- ite of the king, 38they began to bring numerous stories about Ayaz, in order to bring him 39to the disfavour 0f3~ the king.

Question: Will you please explain what you mean when you speak of listening to music spiritually? Can one listen to common music such as tunes played on a street organ? Answer: But we do not sit and meditate in the street58. Besides, there is a technical stage; as a person develops in technique, in appreciating a better music, so he feels disturbed by a lower kind6O of music. But then there is a spiritual way which has nothing to do with technique. It is only to tune oneself with the music, and therefore the spiritual person does not see about its grade. No doubt, the better the music, the more helpful it is to a spiritual person; the higher the music the better.

What it makes is that it brings to one's soul one's own voice, and the voice echoes once again before Cod, Who is within ourselves.

But singing with thought makes it ten times more; because there may be a person but his mind is somewhere else, he is not thinking of the song.

Answer: We repeat, after coming on earth, the same process through which the soul has passed: infancy is expressive of angel7' world; then childhood is expressive of the jinn world; youth is expressive of human world; and when one passes on, so one closer7* gets again73 to the higher spheres. Question: Are the differences of the rays going to the differ- ent kingdoms not differences in the grade of indi- vidual iza tion? Answer: When they start from there they are not marked with indi- vidualization. But as they go further they are influenced in each step to take that particular direction. For instance, a child was born; then he went to see the play. He liked it so much that he became an artist. That was the second thing. That means one step helps another step; in this way the soul's direction becomes changed. 69. Sk.l.tp.: Ifand clearw omitted 70. Ibid.: flandfl instead of a semi-colon 71.

Question: Then God's gain after creation is a gain in individu- ality, in power to create? (for individuality = vanity = power to express) Answer: Till some extent, but Cod is perfect, you cannot say there is a gain for Cod. Question: Does a soul travel up-end-dewls from Che-me-p&else Ce-Cke-chef-e~d-hee-vefsa plane to plane and vice versa? Answer: Yes, this is true, but from spiritual point of view it is not true, for the soul does not travel, the soul is always in Cod, soul itself is Cod. Instead of saying that the soul travels, we can rightly say that God travels. Travelling means losing con- sciousness in one plane and awakening in another plane, but is not moving from the soul. The soul does not travel, the soul remains in God. f'fheagh-t he-pti.netp+e-ef -tndivtdaa+tsati.en ts-in-6ed) Though the individuality begins in the Divine Spirit, the oneness is so great, that1 we cannot say it is the same soul, though1 it is the same I -ness. It is also not the soul who reincarnates, it is the soul that gains and loses consciousness on the different planes, it is its vehicle of consciousness on the different planes, which reincarnates. The thing is: the whole puzzle is solved by solving the ques- tion: who is I? I is Cod Himself. With time it is the same as with the bodily form. It does not exist. All here is a play of shadows. The sentence: I slept in the mineral, I stirred in the vegetable, I dreamed in the animal, I awoke in man, who is I? It is Cod who says this.

Yes, from the human point of view there ,is time, but from the spiritual point of view there is not. The question that all souls have a sum total of difficulties which are the same, means the sum total of their difficulties in the shadows. The only living moment in this world of shadows is the now. Past and future do not really exist. But can the past be changed? Yes, it can. The past can be changed. That is the whole key to the understanding of this illusion. Two things have to be understood in this: 1. To utilize matter to its best advantage. 2. To raise above matter. Why the past is dead? Because dead is that which does not have a real existence. The shadow is dead, not the light, the light has only disappeared. Why God lives only in the moment of now and not in the past and in the future? Because God is eternal, and the life of the moment is his fullest experience. The past can be changed by making oneself independent from its horrible effect. The thing is that one must deny what one does not want to have. The secret is that God's mind only 'lives, and not the minds of mankind, which are doing acts of shadows. To live means for man his only chance to focus his mind in God's Mind. The whole secret is that things which belong to the earth and things which belong to Heaven cannot be compared. 1.e. one moment of the jinn-world is equal to hundred years of this world, and hundred years of the jinn-world is equal to one moment of the angelic world. There is no comparison. Question: Is it possible for a soul to reach divine perfection after having been only once on the earth? Answer: Yes. Question: Does this sometimes happen? Answer: Very often. Question: But is it not the way of the mu1 titude? Answer: No, it is not everyone's way. Question: Can one change one's way and go quicker?

Angels were made to sing the praise of the Lord; jinns to imagine, to dream, to meditate; but man is created to show humanity in character. It is this which makes him a person. There are many things5 difficult in life, but the most difficult of6 all things is7 to learn and to know and to practise the art of personality. he* nature, people say, is created by God, and art by man. But really speaking in the making of personality it is God Who finishes His divine art. It is not what Christ has taught gwhich madeg his devotees love him. They dispute over theselo things in vain. It is what he himself was, it is that which is loved and admired by his devotees. When Jesus Christ said to the fishermen: 'Come here, I will teach you to be fishers of men,' what does it mean? It means: I will teach you the art of personality which will become as a net in this life's sea.

If one's friend lacks the art of personality, 16the allt6 above said things are but17 of little use and value to him. There is a question: how are we to learn it? We learn it by our love of art, by our love of beauty in all its various aspects. The artist learns his art by his admiration of beauty. When a person gets an insight into the18 beauty, then he learns the art of arts, which is the art of personality. Man may have a thousand qualifications or rankslg or position, man may possess all the good0 of the earth, but if he lacks the art of personality, he indeed is poor. It is by this art that man shows that nobleness which belongs to the kingdom of Cod. The art of personality is not a qualification. It is the pur- pose for which man was created, and it leads man to that purpose in the ful- filrrient of which is his entire satisfaction. By this art man does not only satisfy himself, but he pleases Cod. This phantom play on the earth is pro- duced for the pleasure of that King of the Universe, Whom the Hindus have called Indra, before Whom Gandharvas sang and Upsaras danced. The in- terpretation of this story is that every soul is purposed to dance at the court of Indra. It is to learn to dance in the court of lndra perfectly which is really speaking the art of personality. 21~he one who says: 'But how can I dance, I do not know how to dance,' he defeats his purpose.

Answer: Well, all things are desirable if they are properly used, and all is undesirable when they are abused. In the point of fact vaccination is the same spirit26 which is taught by Shiva, Mahadeva, as Hatha Yoga. It is said of Mahadeva that he used to drink poison; and by drinking poison he got over the effect of poison. Mahadeva was the most venturous among the ascet- ics; that one can see by his wearing the serpent in27 his neck. Now, would you like to do it? If one can be so friendly with a serpent as to keep it in28 the neck, I think one can sit com- fortably in the presence of someone one does not like; that hatredness, prejudice, nervousness in the presence of someone we do not like, will not come if one can take a serpent 29 , if one can take the bitter bowl of poison and drink it, which is against nature. When the soul has once fought its battle with all things that make it fear and tremble, shrink back and run away from it, that soul has conquered life, it has become the master of life, it has attained the king 30 . Of course, the methods Mahadeva has adopted are extreme meth- ods; no one can recommend them to his pupil 31 in this modern world, where there is a fear--and vaccination comes from there--it is partaking that poison32 which we fear, which might come someday in some form, one might breathe it in the breath or take it in the water or from the food, the same germs might come and enter one's body. But now I have heard from a friend that a man in Switzerland has worked most part of his life in getting the germs of consumption, tuberculosis, in order to inject them in cases where they can be cured; and he has33 a great degree of success. Of course, such new methods may meet with a great deal of opposition, but at the same time the principle behind it has a very strong reason. This brings us to a much higher realization and a great conception of life; it causes us to think that even what we call death, if that death were put into a cup and given to us to drink, that would bring us to life.

What is colour? hat^^ is green, this is blue, this is high, this is low, this is right, this is wrong. All colours for our common sense they become a property, a reality, but in the realm of truth they fade away, they have no existence. It is not an intellectual realization; it is living it. If 780ne runs away with one's hat, you run after him, and he says: 'It is mine, it is not yours'; that is the test whether he has the Nirwana. But there are the blessed souls, the souls who are really satisfied, whose hunger is really satisfied when they saw another person having eaten his dinner; their hunger is satis- fied. There are such souls living on earth who by seeing another person adorned in beautiful clothes, are satisfied. Their gladness is to see another person dressed beautifully. It might seem: what a renunciation, self-denial! It is not. They have risen above it. They have gone through a cross. They arrive to79 Nirwana. In such a stage it is no pain; it only gives them pleasure. But the spark of this Nirwana is in every soul. Nirwana is the perfection of that, but the spark is in every soul. The other day I told a child, I said: 'Would you rather give your toy to the other poor child?' Now that child had just got its toy, and had not yet played with it. I saw the face of the child. I said: 'Would you be really glad to see another child playing with your toy? You should not give the toy if you were not glad.' And I tell you, it was just like striking a match to a candle, that spark of Nirwana, even call 80 . The child most willingly went and gave his toy to the poor child. His face was beaming with joy at the happiness of giving it. It was so happy to think that the other child was happy. There was no end to his happiness. Therefore it is not something which we must learn. It is in us, but it becomes buried in us. If it was only dug up by our love for it. We need not look for . It is not something which we acquire. We must develop it, then it becomes brilliant. Then it consumes all the impurities of life. Call it sin or wrong or mistake of the past; it is all consumed in that brilliant light. itsa2 all eats it up, and turns it into that brilliant light which is Divine Light. 77. Ibid.: llThlsm 78.

Question: Does the soul find the accommodation of mind when he arrives on earth, or does he make it after- wards? Answer: The soul brings on earth an accommodation already made in a very negative state from the world of jinns; that is the place where this50 gets the mould of its mind. The body it gets after coming on the earth. But that accommodation is filled later on, after the soul's wakening on the earth plane. It is here that that accommodation completes itself, and becomes mind. Question: Is it on1 y a mould? Answer: Yes, a mould with impressions, that is the accommodation. For instance, there is one child who very attentively hears music. There is another child who runs away from it. The child who runs away from it, his mind has not got that mould, music is not engraved there. He will learn it, as he will hear it; but another child where there is already there the mould, is musi- cal. He will be seeking for some music to come in and fit in that mould which is there already.

That is the only convenient word I can find. For in- stance, if the sun is thickly clouded, the light does not reach the earth. So with the soul which is divine and has all the light; if that is thickly clouded, then man does not receive the light which is in himself. The light is there, but he does not receive it. What difference there is between52 diamond and an ordinary stone? The difference of a thickness. The diamond reflects the light which falls upon it, and the stone is so thick that it will not allow the light to reflect in it. The diamond allows the light of the sun to reflect in it, and the stone would not. There is a story of a Murshid. A mureed went for a long time to the house of the Murshid, and teedved tried to devel- op spiritually. But with all his enthusiasm and desire to advance, he remained in the same place. Long time after he said,'Murshid, I have no more patience now. A long time 1 have given under your guidance. I do not see any further. I am standing in the same place as before.' Murshid felt very embarrassed to hear those words from him, and most sad. He said: 'Look here, my son, come with me.' And there was, the first thing that they met in the street, was a mad dog, bark- ing53 and wanting to bite. Murshid looked at that dog, and in- stantly that dog became sane. He said: 'Look here, do you see the change? If the glance of Murshid can do that to an animal who is not accustomed to wisdom, what must it do for5* human being like you? But if your doors are closed, what can Murshid's glance do? You are enthusiastic, you are eager, you are willing, but you are not open.' Therefore it is the openness of heart, it is the response, respondent54 attitude, that is the principal thing in pupilship. That is what makes one a disciple. That we can learn by seeing the difference between the pebble and the diamond. The pebble does not take the light of the sun, the diamond does. And the question 55whether 'is it55 the favour or disfavour of the teacher which enlightens the mureed?' may be answered that that soul cannot be a Murshid who favours and disfavours. The first condition of being a 52. Sk.l.tp.: \"am added 53. Sr.: \"and howllngl' added; Sk.l.tp.: Itand howlingl*, probably copied from Sr. 54. Sr.: llresponsivef~ instead of \"respondent\" 55.

There is no lack of favour if a person does not become enlightened; when the rain falls, it falls upon all trees, but according to the response of those trees, they grow and bear fruit. The sun shines upon all trees; it does not make distinction between this tree or that tree. But in accordance to the absorption56, which is falling upon it, in accordance to the response that the trees give to the sun, they get it. And remember at the same time, that very often a mureed is an inspiration for the Murshid, because it is not the Murshid who teaches, it is Cod Who teaches. Murshid is only a medium. And as highly the re- sponse of the mureed reaches, so strong1 it attracts the Mes- sage of Cod. \"~ureed can inspire, and5' mureed can shut his inspiration too.

The Art of ~ersona1ity.l Summer School Suresnes, September Ist, 1923 Every impulse has its influence upon the word and upon the action; and4 therefore naturally every impulse exerts its full power through words and deeds, unless it was5 checked. There are two types of persons: those6 who have acquired the power of checking their word and action, when 7it exerts its full power and expresses itself7 into* abruptness. The other kind of persons are those who mechanically allow this natural course of impulse to show itself in their word and deed, without giving any thought to it. The former therefore is gentle, and the latter is man. Gentleness is the principal thing in the art of personality. One can see how gentleness works as the principal thing in every art: in painting, in drawing, in line and colour, it is theg gentleness which appeals theg most to the soul. The same we shall see in music. A musician may be qualified enough to play rapidly and may know all the technique, but what produces beauty is his gentle touch. It is gentleness mainly which is all refinement. But where does it come from? It comes from consideration, and it is prac- Notes: This lecture was first published in the book Character-Building.

There is a saying in the ~astl~: 'The weaker the person, the more ready to be angry.' The reason is that he has no control over his nerves. It is often lack of control over oneself which is the cause of all lack of gentleness. No doubt, one learns gentleness by consideration. One must learn to think before saying or doing. Besides 12e~e-mst-say-er ele, while saying or doing12 one must not forget the idea of beauty; one must know that it is not enough to say or do, but it is necessary to say or do everything beautifully. It is the development of the nations and races which is expressed in gentleness; also it is the advancement of the soul's evolution which expresses itself in gentleness. Nations, races as well as individuals will show backwardness in their evolution if they show lack in gentleness. At this time of the world's condition it seems that the art of personality has been much neglected. Man intoxicated with the life of avariciou~ness~~ and the^ the competitive spirit that exists, heldt4 by15 commercialism of the day, keeps man16 busy in the acquirement of the17 needs of one's18 every- day life; and the beauty which is the need of the soul is lost to view. Man's interest in all things of life, science, art, philosophy, remains unfinished in the absence of the art of personality.

Summer School Suresnes, September Ist, 1923 I The Soul's Manifestation. The soul, manifested on the earth, is not at all disconnected with the higher s heres. It lives in all spheres but knows mostly one sphere, ignorant f' of the other spheres2 to3 which it turns its back. Thus the soul becomes deprived of the heavenly bliss and conscious of the troubles and limitations of the life on the earth. It is not true4 that Adam was put out of the Garden of Eden; he only turned his back to3 it 7and it5 was like7 an exile from the6 Heaven. The souls of thea seers, of9 saints andlo masters and prophets are conscious of the different spheres. It is therefore that they are connected with the worlds of1' angels and jinnsl* and with the spirit of God.

The secret of life is that every soul by its nature is an2' akasha, an accommodation, and has in it an appetite; and22 all that it partakes, it creates 230f it23 a cover which surrounds it as a shell and the life of that shell becomes de- pendent upon the same substance of which it is made. Therefore that24 shell becomes susceptible to all influences and subject to the laws of that sphere from which it seeks its sustenance, 25which means25 the sustenance of the shell. The soul cannot see itself. It sees what is round it; it sees26 in which it is functioning27 and so it enjoys the comforts of that28 shell which is around it and experiences the pains and discomforts which belong to that2' shell. In this way it becomes an exile from its birthland which is the Being of God, which is29 Divine Spirit, and seeks consciously or unconsciously once again 30that happiness and peace30 of home. God therefore is not the goal, but the abode of the soul, its real self, its true being. There are five spheres of which the soul is capable of being conscious. What are these spheres? These spheres are the different shells, each shell having its own world31. 320ne, Na~ut:~~ a sphere which is commonly te~a+t~~ known as the physical sphere34. the comforts and discomforts of this sphere are35 experienced?

Now there is a question, if a soul by rising to all these spheres becomes conscious of the gljinn worldg1 and of the 92world of angelsg2 or if it only sees within itself its owng3 made world of mind and the spheres of joy and peace ing4 itself. The answer is, yes95, first it sees its own world by rising to the sphere called Malakut. It experiences the joy and peace96. It belongsg6 to its own heart, 970f its own being. But that is thes0 one part of spiritual attainment. This part of the attainment is the way of the yogig8. hat^^ in which the Sufi differs from the Yogi, is in his expansion, and it is theloo two sides of the journey which islO1 pictured by the two lines of the cross, lo2the perpendicular and the horizontal linelo3. The perpendicular line shows a progress straight within from Nasut to Malakut Io4, experi- encing one's own world 1050neself withinlo5, but that which the horizontal line denotes, is expansion. The Sufi therefore tries to expand as he goes on progressing. For it is the largeness of the soul which will accommodate106 and in the end will become107 all-embracing. The man who will shut up himself from all men, howeverlo8 high spiritual log he may be, he will not be free in the Malakut, in the higher sphere. He will have a wall around him, keeping away jinnsl lo, even 12angels when in the angel1 l1 world1 12; and so his journey is113 exclusive. It is therefore that Sufism does not only 85.

I wish to speak a few words before the Service ~ornmences.~ 2~his Service of the Church of All is a universal worship? 31n this service3 a Christian Service, a Muslim, a ~uddhist~, a Hindu Service, all Services are included. Therefore the blessing of Christ is given from the altar to the seeker of Jesus Christ's blessing. The one who seeks for the blessing of Moses, to him the blessing of Moses is given. The one who seeks the bene- diction of Buddha, for him there is the benediction of Buddha. But those who seek the blessing from all of5 these great ones, who have come at dif- ferent times, they are blessed by all. 6~his service therefore is the fulfil- ment of the desire of Christ. This is therefore the Service which hloses would have had, if he could at those times. And this is the Service which Mohammed had intended, for Islam was meant for all religions in the world. No great teacher ever came on earth with the thought of dividing people into different sects and communitiese6 Our Movement therefore7 is busy rendering our8 service to God and humanity this direction9, without any intention of forming an exclusive community, but to unite in this Service the people of all different religions. This Movement, in its infancy, is commencing its work, but its culmination will be inlo a world Movement. It is the World Message and that religion which will be the religion of the whole humanity. A religion which does not distract the mind of any person from his own religion, but makes it more firm and enlightened, more sympathetic to his own religion. A religion which Notes: This lecture became \"Religious Gatheka no. 37\" and most of the lecture was first published in The Unity of Religious Ideals, Part VII in chapter V The Sufi Movement and in chapter Vi The Symbol of the Sufi Movement.

Ideal seems to be something for the hope to hold, and in absence of the ideal the hope has nothing to look forward to. The present degeneration of humanity can be accounted for by the lack of ideal3, in spite of all the progress that humanity has made in all directions of life. There are many ideals, ideals such as principles, as virtues, as objects of devotion, but the greatest and highest of all ideals is the God ideal. And when this God ideal upon which all other ideals are based4, 5when this ideal5 is ignored5, then6 Notes: This lecture was first published in The Sufi Record of 0ct.-Nov.-Dec., 1930. \"Tp.copyfl points to a document which shows some revisions by Murshida Good- enough, partly in Sakinals handwriting. 1.

And when we look at life at the moment when we are sober of l6 life's intoxication which is continually intoxicating the mind, at that moment we see the futility of life, its falsehood, its changeability, its illu- sionary17 character.

We can sustain the ideal just the same in the tenderest spot of our heart and do our very best 58in the practical life58 59to put the ideal in application59; and if we cannot do60, still we can hold our6I ideal in our heart62, that will do63 a great deal of good to us63. The ideal must be taken as a lamp, as a torch, and all practical things in life are as the objects in the house. We do not need to burn these things with the torch, we only need to hold the torch. The idea64 is to illuminate our lives, not to paralyze the action. The ideal which paralyzes our action is not properly applied. It is not the fault of the ideal, it is our own fault, our own weakness when a person says, '1 am too good to do this.' It is his weakness, it is not his goodness. If it happens to be his duty, then his goodness must be an illumination for it, but his duty must be performed. There must be a discrimination what may be done and how it may be done 65in everything we do in our practical life, and the ideal must not hinder what is to be done65. The ideal must only give the light on the path. Those who bring about a conflict about their action and the ideal, they are not clear in themselves. In reality the ideal and 66action are not made to confuse man's life, they are made to perfect it. Now before humanity there is a question. How shall we live in this67 world making the best of our life? ~nd~~ this question can be seen from two points of view.

But if one thinks of75 this question con- stant~~~~, one will prepare the way for his own happiness, 77illumination and calm and peace and rest which his soul constantly longs for. NOW^^ thinking of the next question, 'tiow shall I make the life of those around me happy? It is not only those around me, in my home, but those7' in my village, in my town, in my country, in the whole world, that I am responsible, however humble and small, to produce happiness for all.' This takes man from his home to the other end of the world with his sympathy, with 'what can I do for mankind'.

In the life of all the prophets and Teachers this one thing has been the cause of their sufferings, and the greatest pity is, when the Teacher gives the Message to the world and is taken away in the midst of it before he has fulfilled the Message. No doubt to a great extent the life of the Teacher is in the hands of Cod, he is sup- ported and protected, and his Message and his workers; nevertheless we25 are given free will and our discernment of right and wrong ways and meth- od~~~, and if we fail to accomplish our duties in some degree27, 28the fault is ours28.

Question: You told us on saturdayZ3 of the great refreshment derived during sleep. Many distinguished men, as Napoleon as example, have performed 24 of work on very little sleep. Is this because of their ability of contact with the higher planes during the waking state?

And so every such experience as hearing something, or seeing something, or a fragrance, perceiving26 a depression without reason or a laughter without a cause, all these are the phenomena, proving that man is the living wireless.

There would be only a kind of little attraction, such as there is a blood rela- tionship, there is a kind of attraction. But even that does not manifest to knowledge. It is a natural attraction, one does not know it. There is a very well-known story in 'Shahnamah' which explains this. There was a young man of whose ancestry the great king of Persia knew, an ancient king. And he brought outz9 this young man with a great care and made him a most qualified wrestler; and his name was Rustam. This wrestler became the champion of the country and was trying to be a world champion, and was very promising in his youth. He was kept by the king in reserve, he was not to see people, talk with people, mix with people. There came many wrestlers, and he won, this youth. But the custom of that time was that a person must, among two wrestlers the one who is defeated, must acknowledge his defeat. And if he does not acknowledge, then he must be killed. And there came a world champion, and this king wanted this young man to fight with this world cham- pion. And they fought.

And when the knife was pierced through his throat, while bleeding he had a little sense and he said: 'Remember, you have killed me, but some day you will meet my father and certainly he will win success over you.' This world champion asked his name. He said: 'Rustam.' The world champion went mad when he heard his name30. This young man happened to be his son. All the time they fought there was an attraction; and yet the father did not know the son and the son did not know the father. To the mind there is a silent attraction, but it is not clear, because it is matter. Question: What is it that accounts for when two people meet, when they meet the first time they feel they know each other? Is it the same thing? Answer: Yes. The only difference between the spirit and matter is, the divine intelligence pouring out directly is the spirit, and radiated through a dense medium is matter. Therefore either in spirit or in matter there is divine intelligence just the same. There has been a talk about the excremation31 in Egypt, that they should have felt agitated and angry against this. It is not so. The souls have much better occupation than to think about their body. Just when one's nails are cut one does not think of the nails any more. There is no link any more. If he keeps it all the time in his mind, there may be a little thought. It is the thought that keeps connection. But the possibility of the same kings who are being excavated is through the minds of those who do it32; that is the medium, because they are conscious of what they are doing. And it is through that medium they can know that something is being done to their body. There are strange stories told in India about snakes guarding the place where money was buried. Because in the ancient times they used to dig up in their house, and put money there when going to travel. They did not want to tell anybody about it. Then they died and the thought was with the thought of the person who was dead. In order to protect that when there was no other person to be there, 33 were inspired to k-there and guard it.

Then there are mothers, very often having left young children with the thought of protection. There has always been that reflection of the thought of protecting the children, that either among the relatives or friends, then at once as if an in- tuition or an innermost desire springs up in their heart to take charge of those children, and they have proved as kind as mothers. Because the mother's love. was reflecting upon the heart of someone capable of protecting, protects them. Answer: The prophetic idea rises above36 philosophical 36 Because the Prophet says: it is Cod Who is merciful and com- passionate; and all children are His children, either to mother or someone else they give their heart. Therefore there is no need to distinguish the motive, because in reality all motives belong to One, and that is Cod. But of course that is the ideal side. In the philosophical side there is a distinction. But I should think that either guided by anybody or obsessed, an act of kindness and a service of love, it is always a virtue. Because after a study of metaphysics or philosophy, after reading or meditating, or after living like a saint, or after accomplishing all that a master may accomplish, in the end one thing a person learns out of all that he has studied, and that is to serve another. There is all religion, philosophy and mysti- cism in it, and if one has not learned that, he has not learned 37 . There are wealthy people with millions, and there are people of rank who are on high positions, and there are mighty magicians with great power, and yet they all will prove to be poor and useless in the end compared with the one who is always ready to do what he can for his fellow man.

Summer School Soresnes, September 3rd, 1923 The Soul's ~anifestation.~ There arises a question, what is the cause of the different stages of evolution that one sees in the world of variety? The answer is that there are three principal causes. One--the heritage of the soul which it has brought from the and from the jinn-world5; second--the inher- ent6 qualities that a7 soul possesses, having receiveda from its parents and ancestors9; third is what the soul acquires after coming on earth. It is these three things which make what maylo be called individuality, which after, in its result, culminates intoll a personality. There are five principal stages of evolution recognized by the Sufis, named as five a9peetg conditions12 of nufs13 14which means the ego14. Every condition of the ego shows its pitch of evolution. As there are five elements and five notes recognized by the ancient musicians, so there are five egos, each showing a certain pitch. Notes: 1.

Answer: There are many mechanical reasons. For instance, if a person is bad natured, it is because he has acquired that4', or because his position makes him so, or because the people make him so. But there is also a reason: because there is something wrong with him physically, though no one knows. A person is ill, at that time he will be irritable; a person is tired, at that time he will be disagreeable, besides his bad nature. But the reason is a mechanical, physical reason; not a moral reason. Therefore there is a physical reason which can be seen from another point of view, which is: vibrations. Every soul which starts from the divine Sun, vibrates differently. What makes the notes of the piano different? Because of their difference in vibration. Only when they are harmonious, they give us great pleasure. Even music can give us more pleasure than the spoken words. Therefore the vibrations with which these souls start from the angel world, they are of various kind. That is the beginning, which harmonizes, co-ordinates, with all that comes in harmony with it. In this way by a vibratory law, that the souls in the first place attract and harmonize the equal vibrations. For instance, a person comes in the room, a strange person. You feel like welcoming that person, talking to him. There is something attracting you to him. Another person comes in the room; he repels, his personality is repellent; if one thinks about it: even before that person has spoken one word. What is the cause? To me it is most amusing, who always does against the influence of the people; to me it is most in- teresting that 'I do not like that person, I hate that person.' That amuses me very much. They cannot understand whom49 Murshid stands. 'If we cannot stand, he must stand even less than usl' It amuses me very much. What is in that person, without having talked to me, being repellent, having turned him against? What is it? It is the vibrations. When they do not harmonize with that person, that person feels a chill, even physically, mentally. He wants to run away. If that is true, then the souls who have started from the ange150 world, they are nothing but vibrations, as said in the Christian Scripture: the angels playing on the harp. They have not got the earthly harp, they are harps themselves, they are music, they are vibrations themselves. And therefore, in accordance to that they attract what first comes to them. And they are directed to that, because they are living vibrations, they are life itself. 48. Ibld.: \"natureI1 added 49. Sk.l.tp.: llwhomn changed Into \"how1# 50.

Answer: I have seen the contrary case, harmonious first, unharmoni- ous afterwards. 51~hild is very susceptible to vibrations. This must be remembered, that a person with excitable vibrations may come in the house, and may not see the children. When that person has gone, the children are more naughty, they are tuned to that pitch. For they take up the conditions of the atmosphere. A person full of depression may come in the home, and the child will cry all night. Therefore in the East there is a custom that52 first, forty days, the infant is not brought before anyone. Because at that time the infant is most sus- ceptible, and it is kept in seclusion. Question: When the soul comes to the angel plane, is there a1 ready tendency to differ? Answer: According to their own vibrations, they harmonize with those souls who are of the same harmony. For instance, there are different laws of harmony which I have given in the 'Mys- ticism of Sound.' I shall tell in short the two different kinds. The one law of vibrations and of harmony is: the similar ele- ment53 t05~ the55 similar kind; that means a conceited person will become attracted to the conceited person, a humble person will be attracted to the humble, so good to the good, and bad to the bad. Just like the note c, if you play the note c on the piano, in six or seven octaves it will sound harrnoni- ously, because it is the same note. Wherever there is the same note there is attraction. There is another law: of contrast. And that law of contrast is such, that sixty francs will be attracted to forty francs in order to make it hundred. Ninety- nine will be attracted to one, in order to make it complete. What one lacks, that something attracts. And very often, what happens? That what one lacks may have much less value in comparison to what one has; and yet he will pay anything for what he lacks. That is another law, and that is the law of con- trast. Therefore you will always find, when a person says: 'Why a serious person like this person seeks a friendship with a very childish person?' But that is what he lacks. All day with a long face, what must he do? He must have something to give 51. I bid.: \"Aw added 52. Ibld.: \"them added 53. Sk.sh.: \"attracts?\", afterwards added by Sk. in Ih. 54.

Question: At the beginning of all, the difference of vibration of souls may seem unjust. But if everything vi- brated in the same way there would be no har- mony. Answer: Rumi says: 'Suppose we find cause behind every cause; where shall we end?' Endless cause. There should be some end. The end is Cod. When we come to that end, there is no cause. God is the cause. That is the impression of the Proph- ets, and their inspiration. And therefore they give the causes which are perhaps useful for the nourishment of the intelli- gence57, but at the same time they say that the cause of all cause is one, and that is God. Omar Khayyam, he58 treats that subject59 from the same point of view as Saint He explains it more briefly. Question: What is the essential difference bet ween . . r 6 1 Answer: Everything is in a circle. And where the circle- completes, there comes the same thing again. For instance, the infancy and the old age. The youth is different, the middle age is dif- ferent, But there comes that condition of infancy in-old age, where the innocence comes, and all the bad feelings and wrong thoughts and pride and conceit, and all that is bad, acquired, becomes forgotten. And those childish qualities with the help- lessness of the age begin to rise. And that is where the circle completes. For instance, there is the morning and afternoon. But the circle becomes complete when it is again morning. In the same thing the circle in the exhaling and inhaling. It is the completing of the circle which is the completing of the octave in music. Because before us there is a piano, but in reality it is not so, it comes round in a spiral. 56. Ibid.: Sk. changed \"whent1 into \"ifl' 57. Ibid.: tflntelligencew changed into ttintellecttt 58.

There is a story that there was a king, and he was travelling through different places, and it happened that he came into troubles, and he had to make a profession of a baker in order to get along for some time until he again went to his place. When serving in the house of the baker, he made a little money that he could go back to his kingdom, he was hiding for some difficulty. He told the baker one day: 'YOU have been so very kind, now I tell you that I am the king. But you must keep this as a secret.' But the moment the baker heard, he said: 'Halm And when he said 'ha' he got a kind of upset in his system; he was almost ill. He said: 'Take me to the doctors, there is something ill.'

The ghost went in the same kingdom and obsessed someone, and the secret came out. And the king knew that nobody knew except the baker. He sent for the baker, and49 came before him. And he said: 'I have never told any living being; I have only said in the forest, because I was ill.' But the king said, 'But how the secret came out?' Then they found that it was the ghost told'the secret. This story tells that it is not everyone who can assimilate the drinking of the liquor of any intoxicating drink. Someone whom you just gave a little sip, he becomes drunken, another you can give one good glass. The one who becomes a seer, to him God trusts. The prophets and Messengers, they have first proved in their lives in keeping the secret of their friends. They have been the trust of all those, just like a safe. People came with their mistakes and difficulties, errors, sorrows they have poured out. It all went in their heart; it was safe, no one could look at it; more safe with the spiritual beings than with themselves. The spiritual being told them: 'Do not tell another, as you have told me.' They did not trust the person with their own secret. When that was the capacity of heart, then in the end God begins to trust: 'You have become the trust of my creatures, now I give you my trust.' It is the reward of that virtue. It shows the best quality in man who can keep ttie secret. 49. lbld.: \"hew added"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"Sakina's shorthand reporting tran- scribed by the compiler.

Answer: Imperfection is not learned. Imperfection is the state of being; it is the limitation which is imperfection. Limitation is the condition of life. If God is perfect, all others are imper- fect; however great, strong, mighty, they are all imperfect. All goes towards perfection. This whole manifestation is made that we all go towards perfection. The interest of life is going towards perfection. If we were born perfect, there was no joy in life, no interest. The whole beauty, we enjoy in our imper- 58.

Answer: We can make them correspond. They do not necessarily. One shows the earthly qualities, the other water qualities, the third the air element, and the fourth ether. Question: *s-tkefe-see-d+4efef)ee 61 Question: Is it possible to change that type? Answer: All is subject to change. One could change entirely from one type to another. Yes, even such a vast distance as there is between saint and sinner can be changed. For I have always been unwilling to admit when a person says: 'This person behaved very wickedly last month.' And if that person is brought to me, I will say: it is last month; that is gone, it may not be so today. Even if he is62 wicked yesterday63, today63 there is a hope. An accusation of last month has no claim for me today. The reason is that man by nature is good. Goodness is his very self, his very being. Badness is only a cloud over him. And the cloud is not such a thing which is pinned; it is the ever-floating- game: it is sometimes here, sometimes it has moved. Do the clouds remain in the same position? So badness, the evil, does not remain. Just a cloud that passes; it comes and goes. And if we trust in the goodness of man, there may be a thousand clouds of wickedness, they may disappear one day. Our very trust will break it. For the depth of every soul is good. And it is belief in this doctrine which can be the reason of the belief in the goodness of Cod. Cod cannot be good if man can always be wicked, for the origin of man is in Cod. As God is good, so man is good, wickedness is a passing phase. 61.

Answer: Really speaking, these distinct four qualities are also a speculation of human mind, as human mind distinguishes these four qualities. But in the point of fact there are myriads of qualities. Every quality has its origin in the heritage. And it is a kind of mixture of different qualities, a kind of solution, just like a medicine is made of different drugs and herbs, and so one prescription is not like another prescription. And so every person has a peculiar personality, has his peculiar qualities. And every person is unique in his way.

Answer: Yes, but it is not necessary to be discouraged68 or disap- pointed in life, because man has the key of his own life in his hand, if he only knew. And it is absurd to say: 'I have not got this.' There is nothing in this world that he has not got, either a good quality69 or a bad quality. Man has got everything. His denial of not having it makes him weak and ignorant of that key, which he has. And the most psychological secret is this: that what one thinks desirable, best attainable, one must affirm, and say one has in oneself. And what is undesirable one must deny: ' It does not belong to me.' That is the key. Question: Is our standard of good and bad by our vanity? Answer: Not standard, but vanity itself is a power behind every impulse which leads man to good or bad.70 Question: Be yeu we.

The one who does not care for it, he does not need to take trouble about it; it is only for the one who seessomething valuable4 in self- respect. A person with self-respect will be respected by others, even regardless of his power, 5position, possession5 or rank. In every position and6 situation of7 life that person will command respect. There arises a question: Has light-heartedness then any place8 in life, or is it not necessary in life at all? All is necessary, but everything has its time. Dignity is not in making a long face; respect is not in making cross brows. In frowning or9 stiffening of the body one does not get'0 honour.

The person who is laughing all the time, his laughter loses its power. The person who is always light-hearted does not command that weight in society which is necessary. Besides, light-heartedness often makes man offend others, without meanin tt to do so. The one who has no respect for himself has no respect for thJ3 others. He may think for the moment that he is regardless of conventionalities and free in his expression and feel- ing, but he does not know that it makes him as light as a scrap of paper 15, moving hither and thither in the space, 15taken14 by the windt5.

There is another person who is too weak to stand; he may just be as kind to say that a chair may be brought, not give his own chair; by that he will not be fulfil- ling his duty properly. When he is out of the court, then he can show his kindness. Question: Will you please tell us how it is that sometimes when people meet for the first time there is in- stinctive repulsion in them and yet afterwards they may become friends? Answer: It is not often so, perhaps sometimes. Because really those who are to be friends they become friends at the first sight. The first impression is really speaking a continual impression, and that becomes more and more. But it is quite possible that sometimes something that had the-tnf+aenee a repellent influ- ence, if one has come over it one can bear it more easily; then one finds something more interesting in that person, then one gets friends. It is only a matter of getting accustomed. A person who does not withstand because he is not accustomed to those vibrations, but by tolerance and endurance he may become accustomed; then he has conquered that weakness. It is the same as becoming accustomed to the poison.

Dignity, by seeking to be dignified, by seeking truth which will give dignity, 330r may seeking dignity to truth the same thing?33 Answer : 34~y learning to think one develops dignity in nature. The more thoughtful one becomes, naturally the more dignified one becomes. Because dignity springs from th~u~htfulness.~~ A person who offends is light-hearted; and the one who is light- hearted is foolish. One may seem clever and yet be light- hearted; but he goes no further than the worldly cleverness, and very often that cleverness falls in35 his feet as an iron chain. As Saadi says: 'My cleverness, thou acts so often a- gainst me.' Question: Sometimes an egoistic person is very dignified. Answer: The true dignity is always unconscious. It is a natural out- come of thoughtfulness. It may be that a person has a dignity and at the same time he is egoistic. He is not yet risen above the ego, because it is the greatest difficulty to conquer the ego.36 31.

Is it that one should be embrac- ing or running after people or talking sweet 40 1 What is it that one could4' show loving? Because every person has a different way of expressing his love, perhaps there is someone who has a love hidden in his heart; it does not manifest. By another it comes out in his words, action. Another perhaps, it rises just like the vapours and charges the whole atmosphere. Another, like a spark in the stone: outside the stone is cold, inside there is a spark. Therefore to judge who has love and who has not, it is not the power of every person. It is very difficult. For instance, love as a fire rising from a cracker, calling out 'I am love!' and burns up and then finishes. There is also a fire in the pebble which never manifests. If one holds the pebble, it is so cold; at the same time it is there, some day you can strike it, and it is there.42 And as many people there are, so many different qualities. One cannot judge the love of one person, of the other, because the manner of expressing love of every person is different. For instance, when we ask the followers of other religions they have a thousand things to say against the religion of hi& adversaries. Not only about44 religion, but also about the prophet. It is not that they-&+- edy because they are of another religion, but they will find fault. The very prophet who is perhaps the prophet of milli- on~~~ people, easily a person can find fault with him, and may havgquite a reason to find a fault.

The regard for the word, many in this world have gone through sacri- fices, sufferings and pains have been inflicted on them, but it was only to put their virtue29 to the test. For every virtue has to prove itself by going through a 30fire of test 30. When it has passed31 its trial it becomes a solid virtue. This can be practised in ever little thing one does in one's daily life. A person who 3%ays one moment 3' one thing, 33 another moment another thing, even his own heart begins to disbelieve him.

MahommedJ5, before having come36 before the world as a prophet, was called 'Arnin' by his com- rades, which means 'trustworthy.' The story of Harish Chandra is known to the Hindus down the ages, the example that37 he has set is engraved upon the mind of the whole race. The story of Hatim, a Sufi among Zoroastrians, has been a great inspiration to the people of Persia. In whatever part of the world, and in whatever period, by the thoughtful and those with ideal the word of honour will be valued the most. 3qhis39 is a man of history: it may be the name was Chava. It was a Rajput, 401 have forgotten40, a41 Maharaja. There was a battle between that4* Maharaja and the Mogul Emperor of Delhi, and this battle continued for a very long time. And while the emperor of Delhi made many other Maharajas come to his court and bow, it was only this one Maharaja, he had said that as long as he lives he will never bow, and therefore a great many sacrifices he had gone through. His power was decreasing, but his mind power was increasing. But he was of a very fine nature, and a very high ideal, and he was very fond of poetry. When this emperor became very dis- heartened after a long battle, he then asked the brave men of his court in confidence that there would be a very big prize43 given to the one who will bring the head of this Maharaja, for this Maharaja has44 caused a very great trouble and great expense. No one in the court seemed to take a vow read- ily that 'I will do it,' except a poet. He was a great poet of the court of the emperor. Everybody laughed at him, all the big warriors, they said they could not do with his army. This poet says: he will do. This poet went to the court of the45 Rajput and his great talent made such an impression upon the Rajput; and perhaps this was a moment of some planetary influence working, that he happened to say that 'Ask, o poet, I really do not know what to give you. There seems to be nothing in my treasure46 that is equal to your knowledge. Ask what do you want me to give you? What can please you? ' 'No, king,' he said, 'do not promise that.' 'No, once promised is promised,' said the king. The poet said: 'Will you keep it?' He said: 'You do not need to ask, a promise is a promise.' The poet said: 'I feel very embarrassed to Gd.h., hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: \"a great\" added Gd.h., bk.: **Mohammedw; Hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p.: nMuhammed** Hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: wcomingn instead of \"having come*' I bid.: *Ithatt* omltted Gd.h., hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: the lecture ends with the words *%slued the mostw and the following story was omitted Sk.l.tp.: Sk. read \"theret1 for \"thlsW from her sh.

He at once unshielded his sword, gave it in the hand of the poet and said: 'Here it is, a very small thing you have asked; it is not greater than the word I have given.' His people, his children, his family, they were all upset. Ministers became very upset. He was not upset at all. He was in good spirit. He said: ' I have promised, it must be given; here it is.' The poet said: 'Now as you have promised me your head, what are you to do with your body?' Why not the body also? Come along with me.' He said : 'Yes.' He walked behind the poet, the poet first, he after. The poet brought him alive in the court of the emperor, and there was a great excitement in the whole court, thinking that for years and years they have had the battle, no one could bring him; here the poet brings him. In order to satisfy his vanity the emperor asked to bring him in the court. He should be brought as a prisoner. He was no prisoner, still he went where the poet brought him. And the emperor looked at him, at that enemy with whom there was a war for so many, many years, And he said: 'You have come after all. But still it does not seem that your pride has gone, for you do not even think of bowing now that you have come to the court.' He said: 'Who must bow, a dead person? A dead person never bows. As long as he was living he never bowed. Now this is the dead body, let anything be done with it. It is nothing.' No doubt the iron-hearted king overlooked that beauty which was brought by this Maharaja and 47that he was beheaded47. But the poet said: 'No emperor, if he is to be beheaded, I am the first to be killed.' The emperor said: 'No, thisl' 'No,' the poet said, 'I also, for I will never find another soul who will appreciate my merit 48 as he has done. He has given his life.' So the poet died with this Rajput. And the son of this poet, the whole family came, they were all so gifted and inspired, they were just like the salt4' of the soil. Everyone of them said one poem and died. The whole family of the poet was sacrificed for the sake of this Maharaja, in his appreciation to that merit and that great virtue that he had shown. And though he has passed through that suffering, and yet there was no suffering, his ideal went through the test; he died that death of honour which has made the record of his merit. It is not one case. In many cases you will find the noble souls who have proved themselves to be in the path of Cod and spirituality, they have shown it in the esteem of the word. Once the word was given, if the earth 50 was upset, 51 they will keep to it just the same.

And why? The king did not speak as a person, but as the nation; therefore God speaks as the whole being, the whole creation. In 'Us' it means all the souls that exist, including them all. Question: IS it better then to keep to one's word, even if one finds later that one was mistaken in giving it? Answer: It depends upon what it is discerning. A mistake is a mis- take. This question has nothing to do with the keeping of word. Keeping of word is more like a promise. Besides this, a person speaks without thought when he 52has to chan e52. But when a person makes the habit h , and if a person will say, yes I spoke with a mistake, then next time he will make another mistake. But if he will always try to speak, whatever he speaks, to speak without mistake, then in time he will be able to do without a mistake. I mean, it is not easy always not for everybody to become so thoughtful and wise that everything one says is without mistake. Mistake is in the nature of man. But try to make it less and less; there must be the tendency of making less mistakes. But it all depends upon a person's evolution. There is a certain state of evolution when a person can maintain his word; another, where he cannot maintain his word, he is too weak to keep it. But by having the tendency, he will get that strength as he goes on, that desire and the esteem of the word. The more you alter, the more there is a tendency to alter. And the more one keeps, the more there is a tendency to keep it. There was a very wonderful story of a ma)d girl, she was a Rajput girl born in Kashmir. She was playing with the little girls, somewhere around her house. And the Maharaja, the king of that place, happened to be walking about in her54 street, disguised as an ordinary man, to see the condition of his sub- jects. He happened to come near these girls talking to one another. They were very young. 5?his girl was55 about eight, nine years. And they were all talking about the doll's mar- riage. Then that conversation came to the Maharaja. One of the girls happened to say, just unconsciously, when they asked: 'who are you going to marry,' she said: 'Maharaja,' who was standing there. He was very amused. He was like her grandfa- 52. Sr.: Itchanges often\" instead of \"has to change\" 53. Sk.sh., Sk.l.tp.: a blank 54. Sk.l.tp.: whisll Instead of l'herll 55. Ibld.: Sk. read \"These girls weren for \"This girl wasw from her sh."},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"ther. Only he said to the parents of the child in a joke: 'Now note it down, that when the marriage of this child will take place, the dowry must be given of the State as a gift of the Maharaja.' Soon after that the Maharaja had56 died. And the girl became grown up, and the time came of her marriage. But whenever there came a question of marriage, her word was: 'I gave my word.' People said: 'The Maharaja has died, what do you say?' She said only: 'I have given my word.' That was all people heard from her, never another word. It seemed as if it was born with her, that honour of word. The word that was given was given. No doubt, ideal is such a thing that one could go to extremity, as it is said in Sanskrit language: 'The extremity of all things must always be avoided as undesir- able.' One might go in any kind of virtue too far. But at the same time ordinarily it is not so. Ordinarily one does not con- sider enough. For instance one cannot be too good one cannot, or in the trueness one cannot be too true 51. The way how one can practise this is in one's everyday life in every little thing one does, if one only thought that 'what I have said, I must do, even if it be a very small thing.' 'First was the Word, and the Word was Cod,' so really, when breaking the word, one breaks Cod. For the one who realizes that, then every word one speaks one can see Cod 58 . When one sees Cod in it, then Cod begins to speak, because then59 Cod comes through the word of man. Then one begins to realize, then what he says becomes his religion. It is too sacred for him. 56.

What about the time that every soul spends in the ~eaven~~ of the angels and48 the ~eaven~~ of the jinns27? The speed of every soul is dif- ferent; it is according to the speed with which they manifest; it is a differ- ent dimension. The difference of speed is like travelling on the earth, 50travelling in50 the water, and journeying51 through the air 52is differ- ent52. ~hel~ difference of speed between different souls may be likened to one child advancing in his53 thought so that he may learn in ten years something which another one 54has not learned54 in a55 hundred years of life on7 earth.

Question: Question: Do the jinn and angel worlds occupy what we would call the same space as our world, and per- vade it? Answer: The question of the space is a difficult one to answer very well in words, for the reason is that the space which we are accustomed to know as space, we only think of any other space in the same way as the space we are accustomed to. For instance, there is so little said about the space which is in the iris, in the pupils of the eye, so small and yet so 59vastly accommodating59. If the space is accommodating that little 60 of the eye, so little, if we can measure it according to our idea of the space, what is the explanation of the space accommodation?

And when this idea has become clear to man, then before him the vision of the Heavens is open. A Chinese philosopher, while answering the question: 'What is soul like?', answered: 'Like the iris,' the pupil of the eye, which means that it is accommodation, it accommodates. It is a6' space itself. And think of the heart. If there were a thousand universes it would accornm~date~~; it is so large. Although every person knows the name of the heart, he cannot realize what the heart is. If he only knew it, he would say as the mystic Nizam has said, that 'What is this earth and the whole Cosmos? If the doors of the heart were open, the heart would prove63 larger than the whole uni- verse.' And what little one can say is by showing the picture of the cross, that there is a horizontal space, and then there is the other kind of space, which can be pictured as a perpendic- ular line. It is not the same space, it is quite a different space. And it is to explain that space, the mystics and the seers have used the word 'withinm--to explain this space they have used the word 'without.' Question: Can an illuminated soul be conscious of all the past events in the evolution of man? Answer: To some extent. For I would ask: this eye, which is so accommodating, does it collect within itself all that it sees? Besides, mind, which has got the most wonderful source of record, which is memory, does it always remember all that it sees and experiences through life? No, certain things which have made a deeper impression upon it. If we remembered all the faces we have seen after one64 trip to Parisl I do not know where a person would be! And if we remember all things, all the good and bad words that people have said, insult65 and bitterness, and foolish and crazy things, where would we be at the end?

Because he must have many experiences of great remorse; it would only create in him bitterness. It is the greatest relief to forget. It is like bathing in Ganges. That is the meaning to be purified of the past. The present has so many beautiful things to offer us, if we opened ourselves to the beauty, that we do not need to look for beauty in the past. Beauty is always there--only we have to open our heart to it--ever new, and ever fresh. Question: Are the jinns conscious of the or the conscious of the jinns? Answer: Not all; as all human beings are not conscious of the angels and jinns, so the jims are not conscious of the angels. But some are conscious. Question: Does the time a soul remains in angel or jinn Heaven depend from its earth1 y life? Answer: I have not come yet to that subject, because this subject will be given in the return journey. Question: Till what extent is the difference of the speed of a soul a difference from his past? Answer: Difference of every Heaven is incomparable. The difference of journey in every Heaven is incomparable for the difference of the speed.

For economizing with one's moneylg is of much less importance com- pared with the economizing of one's life and energy, and 20the same20 of thS1 others. For the sake of beauty, grace, dignitg2 and respect, when dealing with others, one must go so far and no further. One cannot drive with s3 same whip a friend, an acquaintance and a stranger. There again the question of economy must be considered 24. The person who is sen- sible enough to guard his own interest in life may be called clever. But the one who guards the interesS5 of the others, even more than his own, is wise, for in doing so he without knowins6 does things to his own advantage also. It is the same sense of economy which one uses with little things oe7 one's everyday life at home and in theZ8 .business; the same sense used in a higher form by thoughtfulness and consideration 29makes one29 more capa- ble of serving others, which is the religion of alpo religions.

If his inner being is unmoved, he 41 single-minded concentrates4' on a certain spot, outer part does not matter. But really speaking, what is the life of a mystic, of a Cod-realized man, if it is not a playing the part? His life is nothing but playing the part; not one part, but thousand parts: a part he has to play as a servant, as a master, as a friend, as a son of his parents, as a father of his children, as a neighbour of his neighbours, and yet in his mind realize that oneness of all, that love of God, that love of the whole humanity; in all capacities playing part and yet keeping the link with the truth which is within. It is all playing. In this way one will have to learn playing a part. The further one advances in the spiritual path, the more one will have to learn playing the part. When it is said that the twelve apostles, after the blessing came upon them, they were able to speak all the languages, it was playing the part. From that moment they have learned to answer the question of each in his own language and his evolution. That inspiration is the playing of the part.

Harichandra was known to be a king who always kept promise and there was discussion going on among rishis, great mystics with miraculous power, they discussed: is there a man who really keeps hls promise?

King very surprised to see monk of such a high order at the court. As a rule they never come to the court. He said, King, in my need I have come to you. The king said: ask anything of me and I will do it. The rishi said: do you promise, Klng, and he said \"yes1'. So he asked him to give kingdom and 3000 pounds more. The king said \"Yes, I will do itf1. So the kingdom was given to this man. Of course it was a great shock to his people and ministers and his family. He had a queen and a son.

They went and no wealth was taken from the State and the whole kingdom belonged to this rishi. The king and queen suffered as they went through forest without shoes, it was a new experience to them all and then came after six months, when they had suffered, came the rishi again and said: King, you promised three thousand pounds and more. The king said: no, I have not forgotten. What about it, the rishi said, it Is just a matter of the word you gave. The king said: no, I won't take my word back. So they went to a little town and a rich man made a contract that he would pay t 2000 if queen and son would serve as domestics in rich merchant's house. And it was agreed. And the king went with rishi further to look for t 1000 and they came to another town crematorium looking for a tax collector for that place, glad to take H., he did duty there and so gave last t 3000 gold coins he had promised. Not one word, no speaking about it, trying to forget it. No light thrown upon virtue, forgotten. And so H. continued life there and queen and prince their time as servants. They heard Insults of landlady who never knew a queen was serving, doing every kind of work that came along, never saying who they were. And it so happened that the prince was bitten by serpent, last shock to the queen, he only one, he passed away. No friends to call for funeral, she had to carry him to another country herself. And when she came to crematorium, she found H. standing at gate as tax collector. He saw a sad woman, he did not recognize. He said, woman, have you brought your tax? She said, no, I am too poor. He said, my master does not allow anyone to be cremated here who does not pay tax. He recognized his son and the queen and saw her grief, but he stood firm on his duty. That was last trial. He could have had his son cremated and he still stood firm, never spoke to his wife who did not recognize. This moved all spiritual hierarchy and proved his ordeal. There appeared the same rishi, bringing good tidings that his son should be awakened and kingdom given back, just a trial, all righteous souls are put to the utmost trial, the greater the soul, the greater the trial, but when they have passed through the trial and stood firm, the end is nothing but bliss."},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"Sirdar's undated handwritten copy of two questions and answers, referring to 'The Art of Personality' of Sep- tember 8th, 1923, but spoken on another occasion.

Question: Would it be possible for a soul to come on earth, and yet remain free from ill usion 'and attachment? Answer : Yes, but to some extent there must be illusion and attach- ment. But it can be 74even least attachment and illusion74. But if there were not illusion and attachment, it would have been just like a day all the time, and no night. We need day and night both. We can enjoy the sun by having had the night; the rising and the setting of the sun, all gives us a joy, a75 happiness. But in the illusion and attachment there is a motive power, and by that a purpose in life is accomplished. And if there were not attachment and illusion, even to a small extent, the soul would not be able to hold the body, because even that is attachment. Therefore another thing, in connection with this: that there are many people who become so ill, and yet they do not die. For years and years they go through an ill- ness, and they do not die. The reason is the attachment with the body. They may say they would like to leave the body, but still they are attached to it. And as long as they hold this attachment the soul cannot leave it. Because attachment is a soul power, the magnetism is there. Question: Are there not three different kinds of space76? Will you explain a little more on this question?

Because there are two : the three kinds of space: this sphere, and the sphere of the jinn, and the sphere of the angels. And then there is another aspect of looking at it, according to the explanation of the four dimensions: the length, the breadth, and the height, besides that there is the fourth dimension,, that is what the mystic calls within. There came a scientist one day to hear my lec- ture. He was very interested in some of the ideas, but he asked me that ' If you can say 'in the body' then I can under- stand, but when you say 'within,' now I cannot understand what you mean by this?' He is right. But I explained to him that what is the space: space is which accommodates; that is the definition of the space. Then your mind is a space also, it accommodates a space which is wider than the world. Your eye is a space also. But mind is not necessarily the brain; nor these eyes, which outwardly appear to be the eyes, are the only space; but behind it there is another space connected with the eye. Therefore eye is te++ rope7' between man and God, therefore it is ' I.' It means the self; it has a different spelling, but it is the same thing: the ego. It sees. What sees? God Himself sees through it. Therefore there is a direct road between the earth and the Heaven through the eyes. The eyes are two which appear before us. The sight is one. That is the third eye. The third eye is where the two eyes are linked to- gether and become one. That is the key to the whole Egyptian mystery, where there is the sign of eye. In that eye there is eye and the ego both. And when we say that there are three different kinds of space, naturally there are three different kinds of time, incomparable. The times of the higher Heavens are more durable, are longer, compared with the times of this world. The time of the highest Heaven is still longer. And therefore there are three different worlds, and three different times. However, to the one who realizes the ultimate truth, the time and space both are of little importance. He rises above it. This yard, and foot, as and inch is nothing. Once you begin to think of the eternity, day or month or year is nothing. Question: A rapid oneS0 seems to give a less profound experi- ence than the slow progress. Is it one's choice, or a question of temperament? Answer: I should say, it is a question of temperament. But I think that the happy medium is the best. Too slow is monotonous, 78. Sk.sh.: a blank; Sk.l.tp.: \"ways of iooklng at Itft added 79. Sk.l.tp.: \"rope (road)\" 80.

For instance, if the speed of the ant or worm or germ, if by that speed man travelled, he would not go very far; he is not made to travel like that. He is made to travel in his own way, in his own speed. But when he adopts an artifi- cial speed, that is not his own speed. Therefore always re- member, a person who will go in the aeroplane, or railway train, he will not enjoy the full pleasure of the journey than8' the man who goes travelling on foot. I one day met a gentle- man in the train. He said: 'I have been about twenty times this journey, and then travelled walking.' That is the joy. The man who travels in the train, he cannot imagine to what extent the one who walks can enjoy. Because that is his natural speed. In everything we can see the same thing. From the gramophone we hear the human voice, but it loses the magnetism82. Because it is the human voice which gives the full joy to human being. Question: Do those who die with an object unaccompl ished do so in a moment of despair? Answer: It so happens that when their mind is not strong enough to hold that object which 83they want83 to accomplish, then it gives way. Besides that, sometimes the body is not in a fit state to hold it, and therefore one dies with the object unac- cornplished. But that is in accordance to his mind; not in the scheme of nature. It would be in harmony with the scheme of nature if his object were accomplished as well as the scheme of nature, because that is the natural death. Question: Do those who make suicide out of despair, also do so out of iZl usion? Answer: Yes, certainly. It is just like breaking two things which are attached with one another. It is cutting them84, by will, sep- arating them by will, which are not meant to be separated. The scheme of nature would have accomplished something. By separating it they have deprived themselves of what the scheme of nature would have given them. 81. Sr.: wllke\" Instead of \"thanw 82. Ibld.: \"as It has not Its own speed\" added 83.

Summer School Suresnes, September loth, 1923 The Art of ~ersona1ity.l After having acquired refinement of character, merits and virtues that are needed in life, the personality can be finished by the wakening of the sense of justice. The art of personality makes a statue of2 fine specimen of art, but when the sense of justice is wakened, that statue comes to life. For in the sense of justice there is the secret of the soul's unfoldment. Everyone knows the name of justice, but rarely %here can3 be found someone who really is just by nature, in whose heart the sense of justice has been awak- ened. What generally happens is that every person claims to be just, though he may be far from being so. The development of the sense of justice lies in unselfishness. One cannot be just and selfish at the same time. The selfish person can be just, but for himself. He has his own law best4 suited to him- self, and he can change it, and his reason will help him to do so in order to suit with5 his own requirements of life. A spark of justice is to be found in every heart in every person, what- ever be his stage of evolution in life. But the one who loves fairness, he so to speak blows that spark, thus raising it to a flame, in the light of which life becomes more clear to him. There is so much talk about justice, and there is so much discussion about it, %here is so much dispute over it, and in the end one will find that7 two persons arguing upon one certain point, and differing with8 one another, yetg both thinking that they are just. Yet nei- ther loof themlo will admit that the other is lljust as much as himselfll. Notes: This lecture was first published In the book Character-Budding.

One may say, if one will not judge, how 3one will1 learn justice? But the one who judges oneself l can learn justice, not the one who is occupied in judging others. In this life of limitations, if one only explored oneself, one will find within oneself so many faults and weaknesses, and when dealing with others, so much unfairness on the part of oneself, that15 the soul who really wants to learn justice, 16for him16 his own life will prove to be a sufficient object1 to practise justice withl7. ~henl~ again comes a stage in one's lifelg, a stage of life's culmina- tion, a stage of the soul's fuller development, when justice and fairness rise to such a height that one 20arrives to20 the point of being blameless21. He has nothing to say against anyone, and if there be, it is only against himself. And2* it is from this point that one begins to see the divine justice hidden behind this manifestation. It comes in one's life as a reward bestowedz3 from above, a reward which is as a trust given by God to see all things appearing24 just and unjust in the bright shining light of perfect justice. Question: Is it not very difficult to avoid judging, because in order to become just one has to come to a certain concl usion? Answer: Yes, but what man generally does is not only that he judges anyone in the mind, he is very ready to give his judge- ment25 out, he is not patient enough to wait and analyse the matter and think about it more. But as a rule a person is not only ready to judge, but without any restraint on his part he will express his judgement instantly. He does not think: 'Have I the right to judge that person, have I risen to that stage of Hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: \"ye1' omitted Gd.h., hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: wwlll one\" Ibid.: glhimself'l instead of woneselfll Tp.bk.p., bk.: \"forg1 added Ibid.: \"for him1' omitted Ibid.: \"with whichw added, and omitted wwithn at the end of the sentence Gd.h.: \"Then1' changed by Gd. into \"There\"; Hwr.bk.p., tp.bk.p., bk.: \"Theren Hwr.bk.p.: added \", when one arrives at being void of blamew but again crossed out by Gd.

When Jesus Christ himself refused to judge himself, and said that 'Whoever is faultless, it is this26 person's place to accuse or to punish.' That teaches a great lesson, that even in order to learn justice it is not necessary that we should be ready to judge and ready instantly to express our judgement, our opinion. The idea of the Sufis who see in every form the divine form, in every heart the divine shrine, for them to judge anyone, whatever be his position, his action, his condition, is in the first place against their religion, their attitude, for it is their respectful attitude towards everyone, and in this manner they develop that philosophy which has been learned by them as intellectuality. Question: Does the fact of not'blaming others mean that one does not see their faults any more, that we are above seeing them? Answer: No, in the first place, it is a question of self-restraint or a self-control, politeness, of kindness, of sympathy, of gra- ciousness, of a worshipful attitude towards God, the Creator of all beings, and that all are His children, good or bad. If any person's child happened to be homely in appearance, would it be polite to say before the parents that 'your child is homely?' Then the Father and Mother of all beings is there ever-present, and knows what is going on in every person's heart. His creatures with their faults and their merits before us, when we are ready to judge and express our opinion against them, it is certainly against the Artist Who made them, and not behind His back, but 2 7 28it would not be difficult to feel the presence of God everywhere, if we only were conscious of this. Besides this, it is not only the faults and merits of people which we judge impartially, it is always our favour and disfavour which is connected with it. Our favour is always inclined to see the merit, 29 disfavour 29 fault. Is there any person, however great, without a fault? Any person, however wicked, without a merit? Then if we see more faults, it means that we close our heart and30 favourable attitude, and we open that attitude which is unfa- vourable, in order to criticize that person. 26.

Yes, there comes a time, after a continual practice of this virtue, there comes a time when we see the reason behind every fault that appears to us in anyone we meet in our life.

It disturbs us, and we say: 'how terrible, how bad, annoy- ing, what a bad nature that person has got.' It is not the nature, it is the illness. If we looked from a different point of view; it is the reason that makes us tolerant, which can give rise to that forgiveness, the only essence of Cod which can be found in the human heart. Question: Lf death as we understand it is not necessary, what is the alternative? Answer: Change. Life is change. What we call death is our impres- sion of that change. It is change just the same.

Summer School Suresnes, September loth, 1923 The Story of Hatim. The life of Hatim is written by the Persians, and there are many stories told about him, but there is one story which is best known by the people in the East, and that story is that a princess, who was very much known for her beauty and greatness, had made a condition for those who loved her and desired her hand, that 'only someone who will bring me that desired pearl that I long to have, will be able to marry me'. And there was one lover of this princess who really loved her. But he did not find the way of getting that pearl from anywhere. And the work of Hatim was to roam about from country to country, and to do what he could for those who needed his ser- vice. And he met this man, who was most unhappy because he could not find that pearl. Hatim consoled him and said: 'Continue in your path of love, even if it be difficult, and remember that I shall not rest until I have brought you, to your heart, the rest, by bringing that pearl that you wish.' Hatim then went in the pursuit of that pearl. And then the story tells what difficulty he had in obtaining that pearl. And when he obtained the pearl he brought it. And then the princess was won by that pearl, and when she con- sented to accept Hatim as her lover, then he said that this promise must be granted to his friend, who was really her lover, and that Hatim was the lover of those who were in need. This story explains to us that there are two stages of the workers. The one stage of the work: who works for himself; and the higher stage of work- ing is the work for the other. The one who rises above that stage of working for himself, he comes to that stage of working for the others, bringing in their life that blessing which is the need of their life."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"Sakinals shorthand reporting tran- scribed by the compiler.

It is this which 22from the metaphysical point of view22 may be called purgatory. Once the soul has recovered from this state, it again begins to progress, advancing towards2 its goal on the tracks which it had laid before. 2*he picture of this idea may be explained thus: a simple24 man who was told in jest by his friend that, when a person is yawning, that is the sign of death. He was impressed by this idea and after once he had the experi- ence of yawning, he thought certainly he was dead. He was very sad over his death and went to look for a grave for himself, despairing over the idea that 'how false are friends that no one came to his funeral.' He found a hole 25in the round25, dug by the wolves and he thought to himself: 'how nice, I do notB6 need to dig a grave for myself, at least that much is done for me'. He threw himself in that hole and was lying comfortably sorrowing over his death. A man happened to pass that way, who was looking for someone to carry some of his load and who was talking to himself: 'if only I had someone in these woods who could carry half of my load, + wedd be se it would be so nice.' In answer to his thought he heard someone say: 'Alas, now I am dead; if I was living, I would certainly have helped you.' This man could not understand how a person who is dead would speak. As he turns back and looks, he finds a man lazily lying in a hole dug under the ground. He thought, perhaps he was ill; he could help him. He came near and asked27: 'what is the matter with you? ' The simpleton said: 'nothing is the matter with me, I am quite well, only that I am dead.' This man said: ' 28~ow can you be dead, you do not look like a dead man, you are speaking. How could you be dead and speak29 at the same time? You are not dead'. But the simpleton was good at argument; he still continued saying: 'no, no, I am dead' until that man had to kick him out of that hole. Then he got up and tried to believe that he was not yet dead.

And how many souls 3%e will 34 find in the world, who believe the end of life 3?n the death, a belief of mortality which cannot be rooted out from their minds. The whole teaching of Jesus Christ has as its central theme to rise36 towards * the realization of immortality. Question: How can we make 37 believe in this immortality, and make them rise above the fear of death? Answer: Gradually, and not suddenly. Because suddenly the knowl- edge3' frightens a person more than death. It is therefore that the knowledge of truth is made a mysticism, a secret science. If not, there was no necessity of hiding from one's fellow man3', before whom one can bring anything, however precious, if it was for his good. And such a spiritual wealth, the more you give, the more it is increased. By giving another soul you have not lost, only gained. What one has is doubled when one has given to another. But the thing is that one must know whether a person is prepared. Do you know what happens sometimes when a person is fast asleep, and you suddenly wake him1 He gets a shock on his mind and body both, from which with a great difficulty he recovers, and which does him a great deal of harm, physically and mentally. And the same thing is with the truth. That is why all these initiations, all is secret; the vow of secrecy. If not, there is no one's loss in giving the truth to any soul, to friend and foe both. A sage would be as willing to give the truth to friend and foe. Because once he has raised40 the truth there will be no longer a foe. The difficulty is that it cannot be given at once. One cannot place dinner before the newborn infant, who must be fed first with the milk. Question: Do some souls remain under the impression of death for a great length of time? Answer: Time of the next world is quite different from the time here. Certainly, the length of the time which they have to pass through purgatory depends how deep was the impression. The deeper the impression, the longer the time--the impression of the horror of death. The sages, the prophets, have shown 33. I bid.: wstlllw placed before \"greaterw 34.

Besides that, the person who has earned peace throughout his life, then he shows his wealth, when passing away, that he is passing away peacefully, that shows the riches; and his willingness to meet with what comes in the life beyond, that shows his nobility. Question: Will you please tell us about the scenery of the jinn world; does that world interpenetrate this world? Answer: The scenery of the jinn world is peculiar to itself. It is a negative state of what one sees positive in this world; but more in beauty than what one sees on the earth. In this way it interpenetrates. But at the same time it has its own peculiar- ity, which is incomparable with the beauty of this earth. The reason is that the manifestation on this plane has more limita- tions; owing to its rigidity. The higher the world, the less are the limitations to be met with44. Question: You spoke in \"The Mysticism of Sound\" of the power there is in the word. Would it not be of great in- fl uence if those who believe in a continuation of life in another world, left off Cke using the word \"death\", but spoke instead of that \"passing over\" or \"passing into the unseen\"?

And there was a lover of Cod, but he would not go and take that trouble which one has to take to obtain it. There was someone else ready: his work was to take the trouble and go deep, even if it was not for himself but for the others, and to get the knowledge and to give to the one who has the love to have it. This also is the same thing. Question: Will you please speak about the subject47 of God's justice4% Answer: By giving49 a little simile I will show you what difference there is between man's justice and Cod's justice. There are children of the same father and they are quarreling over their toys. heir^' quarreling over toys, for which they have a reason. The one thinks that that certain toy is more attractive to him, why should he not possess it? The other says, that toy is given to him, he must have it. Both have their reason, and both are just. But the father's justice is different from theirs. The father has not only given them the toys to play, but at the same time he knows what is the character of that child, and what he wishes to bring out of that child, and whether that particular toy will help to bring out from him that which he wishes to come out. It happens perhaps that the toy seems poor to him, and to his sense of justice he cannot understand why that toy was given to him, and not to the other. If he was a grown-up child, he would have accused his father of injus- tice. But one does not know the justice of his father. He has to grow to'that state of evolution where his father is, in order to understand the meaning behind it. The same is with the jus- tice of Cod and man. Man's justice is covered by his limited experience in life, by his favour and disfavour, by his precon- ceived ideas, by the learning he has, which is nothing com- pared with the knowledge of God. When one compares the father with his innocent child they are too near to be com- pared with Cod and man, where there is such a distance. If we counted the human beings that exist, they will be like drops tnte the compared with the ocean. There is no comparison between Cod and man. Therefore man's justice is imperfect, Cod's justice is perfect. And if one ever gets a glimpse of divine Justice, the only way is first to believe in the justice of Cod, against all the proofs which contradict His justice. And there are many proofs which will contradict His justice. If one began to see: 'Why this person is rich, why the other person is poor, why that person in a high position, why this person has suffered so much, why the other has lived long and had a 47.

By judging this one will come to a conclusion, when he will say that 'Oh, there is no justice. It is all mechanical working per- haps behind it.' The idea of Karma and Reincarnation will satisfy one. But at the same time it will root out God behind it. Then God, He has no power, if everyone has the power of making his own Karma. Root out Cod, then everything is mechanically working. If so, then there cannot be a machine without an engineer; for a machine there must be an engineer. If there is an engineer, then He must be powerful. Is He sub- ject of His power, or the Controller? If He is subject, then He is not powerful enough, then He is limited. Then He no more can be God. God is He Who is perfect in His Justice, in His Wisdom, and in His Power. But if we question the cause of all such happenings which do not give us a justification, we then come to another question. And that is: can a composer give a certain justification to every note that he has given in his composition? He can only say that 'It is the stream that has come out of my heart. I have tried to maintain certain laws, but if you ask me the jus- tification of every note, 1 am unable to do it. I am not con- cerned with every note; I am concerned with the effect that the whole produces.' It is not true that there is no law. There is a law. But is law predominant or love? Law is a habit, and love is the being. Law is made, love was never made. It was, it is and it51 will be. Therefore love5*, what do we read in the Bible? God is love. So God is beyond the law. Love is above the law. Therefore, if we come to any solution to our ever rising question: 'Why 51s it53 so?', it is not by the study of the law; never. It is only: increasing the study of the law54 will give an increasing appetite, and will never &re bring sat- isfaction. In diving deep into love, and let the love inspire the law, that will open up a realm of seeing the law55. Then we will see that there is nothing in this world, which has no justi- fication. It is inexplicable, but it is perceptible, that all has its justification. Then we shall not have one word to say, that this56 is unjust. Even the cruelest thing we saw. That is the point where the wise reach, and call it the culmination of wisdom. 51. Sk.l.tp.: \"itfi1 omitted 52. Sk.sh.: a blank; Gd.hwr.copy: Ills predominantn added 53.

To become re- fined is to become musical; it is the musical in8 soul who is artistic in his personality. One word spoken in different toneg, the same word changes its meaning. A word spoken at the proper moment and held back at the moment when it should not be expressed, completes the music of life. It is a contin- ual inclination to produce beauty which helps one to develop art in personal- ity. It is amusing how readily man feels inclined to learn the outer refine- ment, and how slow many souls are loto be foundlo to develop ' lthat beauty of personality11 inwardly. It must be remembered that the outer manner is I meaningless if it was not prompted by the inner impulse towards12 beauty. Notes: This lecture was first published In the book Character-Building.

When interpreted in plain words this means that God is the essence of beauty. It is His love of beauty which has caused Him to express His own beauty l5 in the manifestation. And He is pleased when He sees beauty in His manifestation16, for it is His desire fulfilled in the abject-of-the objective world. It is amusing sometimes to watch how a good manner annoys someone who is proud of his bad manner. He will call it shallow, because his pride is hurt by1' the sight of something which he has not got.

And many even become tired of a good for it seems foreign to their nature. As it is not a merit to become unmusical, so it is not wise to turn against refinement. One must only try and develop beauty, trusting that the beauty is24 the depth of one's soul, and its expression in whatever form is the sign of the soul's unfoldment. Answer: Individuality is the consciousness of the soul of its oneness, in spite of its various possessions with which it still identifies itself to be one. And that individuality can be seen in the child who says: 'NO, I do not want this toy, I want another toy.' The moment it says 'I,' it becomes conscious of an individuali- ty in spite of having the different organs of the body and dif- ferent thoughts, and in spite of knowing that this is my hand, this is my foot, this is my head; seeing one's various parts and yet the tendency of attributing oneself all the different parts, and yet realizing that 'I am one.'

Personality is a development, an improvement of an individuality. When an individual becomes a person, in becoming a person that beauty which is hidden in an individual, which is divine, develops itself, and it is the development of that beauty which is personality; what we express from our- selves as an improvement to what we are.26 Question: ~f a child does not show a desire for beauty, can one teach the beauty or can beauty not be taught? Answer: If the child does not show inclination towards beauty, it is only that something is closed in him. It does not mean that the beauty is missing there; in no soul, however wicked or stupid it might seem, the beauty is still hidden there. And it is our trust and confidence in the greatness of the soul which will help us to draw out that beauty; in some sooner and some later, but some day it27 must come out, which is hidden. Only the diffi- culty is for everyone to have patience; we have not patience enough, that is the difficulty. The lack of beauty in some people strikes us so hard that we lose our patience, and become pessimistic and try to run away from them. In doing so we encourage them to become still worse. But if we had the patience to bear it, to endure it, and trust that in every soul there is a goodness and a beauty somewhere hidden; with pa- tience we can ex lore it and dig it out; some day or the other we shall 28. that 30brings one to the belief in ~0d~O.

So many per- sons do. He thinks: I have got it. Instead of forgetting oneself and think that it could be found one day in the other, only if we had patience to wait. As soon as we think that 'here is someone who is lacking beauty; away, away from him1 He has not got what I have,' one shows a pride and one locks the door which otherwise could have kept open for one to toil and work. And it is a weakness to turn our backs to anyone who might seem lacking that beauty which we expect. It is the opening of the heart to every soul, whatever will be the state of evolution, it is that3' alone which will inspire that heart with that beauty, and by opening that beauty one will find it coming to life. Question: Where does the quality of conceit come from, and why is it so difficult to conquer? Answer: It is such a difficult thing to conquer, and it is almost impossible to get rid of. The reason is that where there is a light there is a shadow, there will be darkness as a contrast. So is the conceit, 32it is, an attribute of the ego we call it32, because it is the intoxication of the ego. The soberness of the ego may be called divine vanity. The intoxication of the ego is conceit of man. It is so subtle. The word vanity has been used in a very ordi- nary sense of the word, and there being no equivalent word it is very difficult to express it in any other way. Just like Vai- ragya, indifference and independence; Kibria for the di- vine vanity. But if plainly explained, it is that satisfaction of God which He wanted to derive by this manifestation. But it is not again the satisfaction of the ignorant soul, which makes him conceited. Only satisfaction is now in its proper place, then it is the greatest virtue. Sin and virtue is only the change of place. It is the inspiration which its own beauty gives, which causes33 the peacock to dance. 31. Sk.l.tp.: \"thisn instead of \"thatn 32.

Therefore, even to a small extent, it begins in the angel34 sphere, also in the jinn sphere, and completes one- self35 in the human nature sphere, when it shows itself to the utmost. But really speaking the understanding of vanity is the most enjoyable vision of life's phenomena. What the Sufi calls 'wine' is the pleasure that he derives from that36 phe- nomena3'. As soon as this phenomena37 is disclosed to his soul, and he sees different actions from life, nothing disappoints him, but gives him a wonderful joy, and offers him such an amusement, that it is almost like a drink. That is what Omar Khayyam calls wine. 'Amuse yourself and38 by seeing the phe- nomena of life, and get above the worries and anxieties that come from self-pity.' And always you will find the seers, the most evolved seers, always amusing themselves with life. Therefore they are pleasant to speak with, pleasant in their atmosphere and pleasant and39 every 40 . When self is for- gotten then there is no worry. Worry comes from fear. What the fear is made of? The clouds of ignorance. The life will break it. One who wishes to be happy he can find a thousand things to amuse himself with, and be happy. And if one wants to sorrow over things, he will find a million things to sorrow over.

Summer School Suresnes, September 12th, 1923 The Art of Personality.' A friendly attitude expressed in sympathetic thought, speech and deed is the principal thing in the art of personality. There is a limitless scope to show this attitude, and however much the personality is developed in this direction, it is never too much. he' spontaneity, the tendency of giving, giving that which is dear to one's heart, in this one shows the friendly atti- tude. Life in the world has its numberless obligations towards3 friend and foe, towards3 the acquaintance and the stranger. One can never do too much to be conscientious of one's obligations in life, and do everything in one's power in fulfilling4. To do more than one's due is perhaps beyond the power of every man, but to5 in doing what one ought to do one does accom- plish one's life's purpose. Life is an intoxication, and the effect of this in- toxication is negligence. The Hindu word7 dharma and adharma, religious- ness and irreligiousness, both signify, the6 one's duty in life to be dharma, and the neglect of the same is adharma. The one who is not conscientious of his obligations in life towards3 every being he comes in contact with, is indeed irreligious. Many will say that8 we try to do our best, but we did not know it, or we do not know what is our due, or how are we to find it9 out which is really our due and which is not? No one in this world can teach what is anyone's10 due, and what is not. It is for every soul to know for himself by being conscientious of his obligations.

The man who neglects his duty to his fellow man, absorbed in the14 life's intoxication, his eyes certainly will become dazzled, and his mind exhausted before the presence of Cod. It does not mean that any soul will be deprived of the divine vision. It only means that the soul who has not learned to open his eyes wide enough, will have the vision of Cod before him 15during his eyes15 closed. All virtues come from the wide outlook on life; all understanding comes from the keen observation of life. he' nobility of soul therefore is significant16 in the broad attitude that man takes in life. Question: How can one work for personality unconsciously? Answer. The best thing is to develop in nature love for beauty. And that can be developed by admiration of beauty. 17~eauty's best expression is17 in human nature. And if the beauty of human nature we learn to appreciate and admire, and we are impressed by all we admire, then by all we come intola con- tact, that becomes our property. In that way we can make a beautiful collection of every person, what he has to offer. It is the critical tendency and the lack of appreciation which keeps the personality back from progress, Because the best opportunity that life offers to get all good from every person, that opportunity is lost by seeing the bad side and overlooking the good. But if we saw some good in every person, we can take and collect it, and in this way we develop the love of art. Just like a man went from here to China, and different coun- tries, and found the best pieces of art, and collected them and then made a museum ~us6e Cuimetlg. When in a material way a person can do this, in a higher way it can also be done. By taking the good of a person one does not rob that person of the good.

And beauty so collected in the end results into a beautiful person- ality. There is never an end; in the most ordinary person there is something to be found, something we can learn from every person, if we only had the desire to appreciate and find good in that person. And if the good was hidden, to try and draw it out. And to draw out good from another person, what does it want? It wants currency. What is currency? Goodness in one- self. Give that currency; it gives back which is hidden there. Question: How can a soul a1 ways know its duty? May not over- scrupulosity bring confusion of thought and wrong action? Answer. Over-goodness or over-kindness or over-lovene~s~~, 'over' is always bad. But what generally is the case, what one always finds is the intoxication. Soberness is very difficult. The life has its effect upon every soul of intoxication, on a saint, sage, on2' everyone. That intoxication is overwhelming, it is keeping a person back from a clear understanding. And therefore, however far advanced a person, even in the spiritual life, he can never be too sure of himself that he will not be taken up in this22 intoxication. Because he is breathing it in with eve- rything he smells or tastes or hears, which veils, and veils eve- rything else, and therefore one cannot be too much conscien- tious. For instance such a case may be found in the mind of a person who is unbalanced, who has already a confusion. He does not know whether he has done wrong or right. I am not talking about that person at all. That person I do not call con- scientious. That person I call confused. He does not know what he is doing. A conscientious person does not discuss over it, only continually he is wide awake, and he always sees 'where should I have done something, and why have I not done it?' In every situation, condition. But he does not confuse himself. He.just does what he thinks right. And if it happened that it turned out to be wrong, next time it will be right. The one who wants to do right will do wrong 230nce, twice, thrice23, but in the end he will do right, because he wants to do right. 20.

Answer. No; one must not trouble about it. Because the thought of accident attracts accident. It is best not to trouble about it. But in order to avoid such accident the best thing is to keep tranquil. Because all accidents come when the tranquillity of mind is disturbed. And if one kept one's mind in a proper bal- ance, no accident will come. Accident always follows the broken rhythm of mind. When mind has lost its rhythm, then there is an accident. But you may say, when a person has a motorcar accident, is it his fault? Not the fault of the chauf- feur? But the answer may be May be it is the fault of the chauffeur, may be it is his fault, that his mind has upset the chauffeur, or someone else, also by his mind. The accident might come from another motorcar, and also reflected by his mind. No one can blame the other, because they do not know. Accident is not natural. It is something unnatural, and some- thing undesirable. For instance the false note and lack of rhythm was not meant by the composer, he did not mean it. When the person is playing it, it is a mistake, it is not a desire. 24.

Summer School Suresnes, September 12th, 1923 The Soul towards2 the Goal. What does a soul do after having arrived at the sphere of the jbn3? It continues to do the same4 which it has5 been doing6, right or wrong, good or bad7. It goes along the same lines that it 'had gone8 through life. Is there no irrptavement progress for that soul? Yes, there is, but in the same direction. No ultimate change necessarily takes place[?]g yeslo, the soul finds itself in more clear spheres, therefore\" knows its way better than it had 12known before12 when on earth. What is its destination? The same destination13 may be hidden under a thousand objects; every soul is bound tot4 the same goal. How can it be otherwise? ~anc~'~ how a person becomes attached to a place where he has been before, how one is attracted to a spot in a solitude, where once he16 has sat and enjoyed the beauty of nature. How much then the soul must be attracted, either consciously or unconsciously, to its source, which is its eternal abode.

But how72 these brave ones arrive at this stage? By rising above themselves. If this limited self, which makes the false ego, is broken, and one has risen above the limitations of life in73 all the planes of existence, that69 soul will break all boundaries and will exper- ience ~iberation~~, which is the longing of every soul. Question: You said yesterday75 that it was better if the soul after passing could throw off all that it had learned while on earth. Surely the spiritual de- velopment and wisdom must be valued, even after passing? Or does the soul learn that all over again, and much quicker, and thus loses no time? Answer: I doubt whether I have said exactly the same words: that it was better that the soul . . . . . And if I had said it, I think it was my mistake. I may have said in other words, in other capacity. Question: Is the soul hindered in its progress by being called back to earth by mediums and76 sorrowing friends? Answer: Certainly. Suppose a person was going from here to Paris, and he has not yet gone as far as that door and someone calls77 him: 'Please, stop, come here, I Is' Perhaps he has gone further, and there a person calls: 'Please stop, I want to speak to you.' It means that he always will be de- tained, he will never arrive there. Then the purpose for which he was going is hindered. Now it is meant that he must go further; to call him backward, I should think is a fault against the nature itself. With all our love and affection, the one whom we love, if it happens that that soul has passed, and is going forward, it is better to help that soul to go forward; and that one can do by sending one's loving thought, helping it on to go forward.

It is most amusing: to detain a person, that that person was meant that a person should be with another person, he should not have gone! It is for his good. Detaining him would be pulling him back from that progress which is the longing of every soul. Question: When the soul coming towards manifestation meets a soul on its return journey, 79the latter one aware79 of the meeting? Answer: Not always awareB0. It depends upon the soul. Are there not in this world many souls who are unaware of any pres- ence? There are other souls who are conscious. Question: Do the souls who come to realization here, not go to the jinn- or angel8'-world after death, but straight back to God? Answer: But it is the same way; they go by the same way, the way they came, that is the way to Cod. But the ones who go to Cod, they do not stop here. Even on the earth, they can go to Cod, not be on the earth. To go to Cod, one need not go through death. Crucifixion is the condition. They can go to Cod even from here. For Cod is nearer to them than any sphere of angels or anything else. Even to the jinn world, perhaps one step journey; to the angel8' world two steps. But to go to Cod: no step. He is there; if one was only conscious, He is there. Now also can say by this question82 that the last, or the highest stage that the soul perceives, is that stage attained without experiencing the jinn world? I should say, yes, but there is no joy in it. The joy of life is the joy in the journey. If one closed one's eyes, and was immediately put on the top of the Himalayas, he would not enjoy it so much as the one who would climb and see the different scenery, and meet with dif- ferent people, and breathe the different atmosphere and air. That is the joy of it. If he was put there with closed eyes, he would be frightened. The whole joy is of the journey. 79.

But at the same time unconsciously they receive them. And very often they do errands, thinking that they are doing them at their free will, or because they wish to do it; 'really speaking they were doing an errand of a spirit gone beyond.

And if I have left my home, I have found in the sympathy of my mureeds that happiness of home, or even more than that. For me there is no greater joy than to rejoice in your joy, and to sorrow in your sorrows. And the ideal for which we all are working takes away the importance of the home, as our home now is the whole humanity. It is for4 this ideal that we are working, and therefore, the home is never forsaken; the home is here or wherever I live or I work. Besides this, the Message which is being given to my friends, what does it teach, what has it brought? it has brought the memory of that home which is the home of us all. A home to which all souls belong, a home in which we are all living now and in the future, and a home to which we are 5bound all5. When I came I was alone, and now I find some few but sincere souls like you around me, willing to do all that is in their6 power, with their devo- tion and sympathy.

Summer School Suresnes, September 14th, 1923 The Soul towards2 the Goal. The soul which functions on its way to manifestation in different bodies, covering3 itself thus with a4 body over another body5, 6has a power6 which it uses to a smaller of greater degree in7 renewing of the tis- sues of the body and8 in healing it9. The child born inlo thel1 family in which there are physical infirmities, is often born already healed12 and13 tissues renewed. The reason is because the soul is the divine breath; it puri- fies, revivifies and heals the instrument in which it functions. On its return journey the soul shows the same phenomena14 in a different way. 15~11 the impressions of illness, of l6 sadness, of l6 miseries17, which lethe soul hadla experienced while on the earth, and hadlg taken 21the same impressions21 Notes: This lecture was first published in the book The Soul Whence and Whither?, Part Ill Towards the Goal, as the second part of chapter II ( 1924).

It purifies it26 from all illness and 27its impressions27, and thus renews its2' life in the spirit world in accordance to its2' evolution. But, apart from evolution, it is the tendency of the soul to repel3' all that is foreign to it, either from the physical body or from the mental body, which it still has in the spirit world. The soul is on a continual journey; in31 whatever plane32, it is journey- ing all the time and in31 this journey it has a purpose to accomplish; many purposes contained and hidden in one purpose. There are objects which remain unfulfilled in one's lifetime on the33 earth. They are accomplished in the 34further journey34 in the spirit world. For nothing that the human heart has once desired, remains unfulfilled. If it is not fulfilled here35, it is accomplished in the hereafter. The desire of the soul is the wish of Cod, small or great or36 right or wrong and37 it has a moment of fulfilment. If that moment does not come while the soul is on the earth plane, it comes38 39in its further journey39 in the spirit world. ~he~O soul proves its divine origin in31 all4\\ planes of existence, 42wherever it happens to pass42, in creating for itself all it desires, in pro- ducing for itself 43its heart's object43, 44in gratifying itself with all it wishes44 and in attracting and drawing45 to itself it wants.

Question: Do children who die as infants come to maturity, and on which plane? The angel- or the jinrr ? Answer: Yes, they do; often on the jinn plane, and sometimes in the plane of the angels. It depends upon the quality of the soul, and upon the object it was meant to accomplish. Question: Is there then no illness, or impression of illness on the jinn plane? Answer: Yes, there are. As there are illnesses tn-the-human-p+ane on the plane of the earth, so there are certain discomforts on the other plane54. But in telling you the healing power of the soul, I have explained that it heals the body that it functions in, even on the earth. And the illness that it takes from the earth, it heals again in the hereafter. No doubt, the discom- forts of that plane still remain; for life is a continual struggle. The struggle there is more easy to combat with, for the reason that the facilities of the other plane are greater, as the limi- tations of this plane are great.

Question: You said: the desire of the soul is the wish of God, small or great, right or wrong. How can the wish of God be wrong? Answer: There are many things for which man accuses God to have done wrong. It is only out of his respect to God that he does not say anything. I think'there is no person in the world who can be accused so many times for wrong doing as God. The reason is that it is our limited self who judges, who is not capable of judging. Question: You once said that this Message would teach the labour men to make from the labour their way of meditation. Will you please speak more on this subject? Answer: By this I had meant that the chief work of this Message is to make the everyday life of man a religion, his profession his religion, his work his religion. Whatever he is capable to do, he must do it, and at the same time while doing it, he can medi- tate on the same work, by knowing the secret56 meaning of that work which he is doing, and in this way turning the57 life, the same life, from worldly life into spiritual life. From every- thing he is qualified to do, and which he is needed to do, while doing this, he will be accomplishing his religion, and attaining spirituality by it, by his meditation on58 the evolution of his work, however uninteresting59 his work, as soon as he knows how to do the meditation rightly. 60~esterday I was envying a fisherman, sitting there.

Of course the man in the factory has not that facility. Nature is a bliss. Still the man in the factory, his wages will be nothing compared with the bliss he gets if he knows 61 . Now it is a loss. By that he is gaining what he gains, and at the same time 62 . What will happen when the initiated ones, some of the mureeds, who have the interest in the factory or the trade, then they will have the leading of the thing? Then they will be giving the Message at the factory.63 There is no other thing to think about, when the right teach- ing64 is given. Even better than other people, because his mind will be concentrated. My own experience: I came at the sta- tion of Rajputan; I had to send a telegram. There I saw a man who was busy with his telegraphic work and at the same time he was doing his meditation. lt65 interested me very much, a man so busy as that, who had to listen every time to the bell, and do the work. A mistake of one letter would have held him responsible. He came to me, and I said: 'I have come to give you this telegram. But I marvel at you.' I said: 'It is wonder- ful how you are keeping your concentration during this work.' He smiled instantly, and we became friends, and had a very in- teresting talk afterwards. But if not, the spiritual work would be a nuisance. And especially in such times when the life's need is so great, that everybody has a certain work to do, and they have very few hours of rest. And if only once in a week a person, or66 if a person thought that after he had reached a certain age, he will have a leisure, then the whole life is wasted. The best method therefore is to use the way of medi- tation in one's everyday life. Whatever one does must be done with meditation. One will not only have the benefit of earth, but also from Heaven. The benefit will be a thousand times greater. 61.

If it was not so, there would not be a justice8! What is not gained in this life is accomplished in the next. Therefore there is a scope for the hope throughout life. Question: Is the person who definitely communes many hours a day with God closer to Him than he who must con- centrate on his duties, without chance of commun- ing definite1 y? Answer: One must make one's duties a religion, and find a means of communication through one's everyday life. If the Sufi Mes- sage has to bring anything to the world, it is this. By the med- itations and concentrations which are given to the mureeds, it is not meant that that is the only means for them to communi- cate with Cod. That is a way, that is a key. From that8* way they must develop to learn to communicate with Cod in all things that they do in their life. It is not sufficient to sit for half an hour or an hour in the thought of Cod. Every moment of our life must be devoted to it. I remember the words of my Murshid, answering my question one3 the sin and virtue. He said: 'There is one sin, and one virtue. The moment which is passed in the absence of Cod is the sin, and every moment in life which is passed in the presence of God is virtue.' The whole working in the Sufi culture, its object is that we must arrive to a stage in our life, after learning this way of concen- tration, that every moment of our life we are in communion with Cod. When we are talking with others, when we are walking, sleeping, in every action we do, Cod must be before US. 79. Ibid.: \"same\" omitted 80. Sk.l.tp.: \"a.s.o., who Istt in place of \"etc., astt 81.

Just think, when a person is in love with someone, he is capable of doing it. He thinks of the same person all the time, while eating, drinking, or walking; the image of the beloved is there. That shows that man is capable of it. When the same love is developed for God, it is natural to think that84 at every moment of our life of God, all we do. Question: Do souls on the mental plane retain the memory and knowledge of their experience on the earth? Answer: Retain? They are engraved by it. It is just like a white cloth which has its colours and impressions, and all that is printed upon it. It is printed with it. With this it has made its world. The soul comes alone, but goes with a world with it. And really speaking, the soul would have liked to have taken the earthly body, if it could. But is is not allowed there; therefore it has to leave it here. Question: Are there courtship and marriages85, and are chil- dren born on the mental plane? Answer: It is not necessary that the law of the spiritual plane should work so much in accordance with the law of the physi- cal plane. Even on the physical plane the law differs. Among the living creatures there are egg-born and there are different creatures. Then there are living creatures who are born out of the animal world, come from the leaf, 86from thee6 fruit; quite a different process. When there are such varieties here, so the laws of the spirit world must not be compared exactly with the law of this. \" Still, one law remains all through, in all planes, and that is the law of duality, negative and positive, the law of expression and conception; that every issue in whichever plane, it comes subject to this law.

When our belief has become living, it must have influence upon others; it cannot fail, it will not fail. Question: Do the personalities of unevolved souls, such as those of primitive natives, and those sunk in ma- terialism, persist through death? Answer: Certainly, they all do. Every soul that has wakened on the earth has a next station to make, and that station is the spirit world before it starts for the next world. Not only human beingh9, but this also applies to all living creatures. Question: When the soul decomposes its bodies, after using them, does the matter of the decomposed body, thus used by man, do anything to lift the matter of the planes they return to? Answer: Yes, matter evolves, and used by the higher entities it evolves still. But the nature of evolution is different. For in- stance, the matter as a whole, it is evolving to a much better condition and more fresh than the matter which has gone again in it and taken by it.

It is this which is generally known as obsession. In point of fact there is no soul who has not experi- enced obsession in the true sense of the word. For there are moments in one's everyday life when those on the other side take the souls on the earth as their medium1 to experience life on the earth20. 21 ~ransmi~ration of the soul is a much deeper impression upon the soul than what obsession might give.21 For in time the sea) spirit22 who enters into the being of a person on earth, makes the23 person entirely void of himself.

Question: Is it a great lack in a character when a person cannot give the love which friends require? To receive love and be unable to return; to have forgotten friends, while absorbed in work and occupation? Answer: The question is what work or occupation? There are works and occupations which are of the higher character, which take one's whole attention, one's life. And such works may require renunciation and sacrifice. Then one does not become loveless, it is the duty. One cannot be regardless. But if one can manage to give and take love at the sanie time, it is prefer- able. 16.

Answer: Such a punishment, it purifies. Suffering purifies a person from sin. Life is dear, more so to a material person than to a spiritual person. Therefore his pain is great. And that pain comes as a rescue for his spirit.77 Question: What do you mean, that God is helpless on earth, but all-powerful in Heaven? Answer: For the very reason that Cod is divided in the world into different personalities. In Heaven He remains in one personal- ity, then all His power is in one. But His object in all limited personalities is-the which are on the earth, is the same as 78 His Will be done. Therefore every person, whether poor or rich, has the wish: 'My wish be done.' Whose desire is it? Cod's desire. This desire can only be fulfilled if he would give up his desire to the desire of Cod. Only on one condition: If he can give up his self for the Self of Cod. That is the meaning of Abraham's sacrifice of his son. And that is the true meaning of crucifixion: give up the false self for the Self of Cod. Then there is perfection, that His Will is done.

Answer: Certainly, both. How can there be light without shade? It is the light and shade which make the picture complete. Question: They have a certain choice? Answer: Yes. As every step they go and every impression they take, that becomes the guide to their further step. For instance, when we are walking in a forest, the way we do not know, we only walk by the inspiration from all we see; so we go. So the impression of the soul is from the place it starts. It always goes, hearing that music, where the music comes; all the vibrations and beauty, all it becomes accustomed to, it goes and receives it. For instance, if all people were fond of good music, no one would go and hear the jazz band. But it seems there are more who are fond of the jazz band. It has become a society custom to go to operas. It is very good that it is made a custom. They go because they pay more there. If that was not the thing, then very few people would have gone. If that is the case, then everyone is attracted to that beauty which particularly appeals to his mind, that the mind has beforehand a preparation which makes it appreciate that.

Does the spirit impart its merits, talents, experience3 and knowledge4 to the new coming soul, passing through the spirit plane to5 the earth, 4consciously or unconsciously4? sometimes6 it imparts consciously, in 7some cases7 unconsciously, but in the conscious action there is the greatest pleasure of8 the spirit. For this soul, which is taking the knowledge from a spirit as its heritage of the world of the jinng, is considered by the spirit as a child by his parents or a pupil by his teacher. In lothe heritage oflo this soul there is a great joy for that spirit. Do they keep connection in any way? No connection except a sym- pathetic link, for one goes to the north while the other goes1 l to the south, one ascending to Heaven, the other descending to the earth.

The soul eventually rises to that standard which was the standard of its ideal. It does that work which was its desire. Are there difficulties in the spirit world as on the earth in doing something and in accomplishing something? Certainly there are, but not so many as here on the earth. But 17if there was17 one object that was desired by various spirits, how can they all attain to it? Will they all get some particles of that object? And if it be a living being, what 18about it18? The law of that world is different from thelg world of these20 limitations. There souls will find in abundance all which is scarcely here21 to be found21 on earth. The picture of this22 spirit world is given in the story of Krishna. The Copis of ~andravana~~ all requested young Krishna to dance with him24. Krishna smiled and answered each one thatz5 260n the evening of the full moon27 27~11 Copis gathered in the Vandravana and a miracle happened that as many Copis were there so many 28~rishnas there were28. The spirit world is incomprehensible to the mind which is only ac- quainted with the laws of the physical world. An individual who is a limited being here is as a world there. A soul is a person here and a planet there.

Life lives and death dies; the41 one who lives will live, must live42, no alternative. Question: Has it ever happened that a soul which had meant to go forward to the physical plane remained in the sphere of the jinn for the 1 ove of a soul there? Answer: It does happen very often. It is the love that takes one forward in one's progress, and again it is love sometimes which changes one from progress. Only it is the difference of the higher love. Higher love always takes one forward. When the love is not high enough, it has not the power to go forward. And sometimes it pins one to the same point where one stands. Love is the battery which should be used to go forward. Question: Could a soul only43 persuade a soul who was meant to stay in the jinn plane to go with it to earth? Answer: 44~s a soul has individualized itself in a certain plane, it becomes the inhabitant of that certain plane; it does not go forward. It stops as long as it wishes to stop, or as it is meant to stop, which is thousands of years of this earthly plane. It can go quicker.

The way of the Sufi therefore is the way of expansion; as he draws within, so he widens his outlook on life. So that in the end when he has touched the innermost of his being, by that time he has embraced almost all that is living. And it is this idea which is pictured by the sign of cross. Reaching +n one's innermost being is signified by the perpendicular line, and the expansion which widens man's outlook on life is signified by the horizon- tal line. Therefore the cross in the end becomes the heart- round. For the circle does not show the two aspects in their essence as the heart shows. When you see in the centre of the heart, it shows the perpendicular line to the mind with keen imagination, and also it gives an idea of the horizontal line. The difference between the circle and the heart is that the circle which expresses the cross is the heart. Therefore the leaves are of heart shape, rather than round. And the veins of the leaves show the cross. The Yogi's attitude is keeping away everyone at a distance. He will bless, but he will bless a person from a distance, and say kindly: 'Do not come near.' He does not hate, but he would rather be left alone. The Sufi comes with the open arms to welcome all who come. For in every person he sees the spark, the divine Being. Therefore he becomes all embracing; in this way he widens his outlook. 54.

We shall see all cruelty and ugliness and unkindness everywhere. Question: Do the planets of different souls interpenetrate, or are they Answer: There are entirely aparte2 from the other. But at the same time the law of the cosmic system is the same here and in the next world. For they all hold one another by their power of magnetism, by their power of attraction. And so we, the human beings on earth, attract one another and repel one another, subject to the law of magnetism. Furthermore, as human beings on the earth, each stands apart, and yet have in- fluence on one another, and have friendship and attachment and acquaintance, a connection, a relation; the same can be found in the cosmic system with the planets, and the same law is to be seen in the sphere of the jinns. Question: In focussing on on1 y the beautiful, is there not a danger of shutting our eyes to the uglinesse3 and suffering we might a1 1 evia teB4? Answer: In order to help the poor one ought to be rich. And in order to take away the badness of a person, we ought to be so much more good. And that goodness must be earned, as money is earned. And that earning of goodness is herding collecting goodness. And if we do not focus on goodness, we shall not be able to collect sufficiently. What happens is that man becomes agitated against all the absence of goodness that he sees; and being himself poor, he cannot add to it. But unconsciously he develops in his own nature what he sees. He says: 'Oh, poor person, I would like you so much to be good.' But that does not help. His agitation, his looking to the badness, only adds one more wicked person. When one has focussed one's eyes on the goodness, one will add to the beauty. But when his eyes are focussed on the bad, he will collect the wickedness suffi- 80.

Answer: 'Died before death,' what do you mean with it? He is the king of this world. And never think, that the one who has died before death, has no desire. The desire springs up again, only he is not beneath the desire, he is above the desire. The pic- ture of the god Vishnu showsE6 Vishnu sitting upon the lotus. Lotus is the desire, every petal.

If a person has sta ed on the earth for a shorter time, his task a more little &I the duration in9' his stay in the world of jinns will be less: But at the same time there is another condition, and that is: the one who has stayed less here has much more to accomplish there than the one who has sta ed for longer here.

Surely it must spoil the harmony for all the others? Answer: Yes, that shows that even there is no peace in Heaven. The inharmonious people follow the harmonious one as far as in the Heaven. But as the soul goes further, it becomes more and more in tune. But at the same time, the vibrations are differ- ent; one is more harmonious than the other. But they in the one music of the Heaven, for the reason: in music you do not want all alike; all different notes are necessary.

These elements have worked in consonance with one another 45and against one another45 in order to bring about the 46desired results46 by the Divine Wisdom working behind it47. In every akasha or asman4' they have been present more or less; one without the other did not exist. The four together brought the fifth.

Answer: Before manifestation the Being of Cod existed as all. All in it: unity, trinity, duality, no duality 67 not distinct. If it was not there, how would it have come? It all existed. But beyond and above, what existed? God, the Only Being. The knowledge of two, three, four, five, is for us, for our benefit, for us to understand things better. But the is the knowledge of unity, One, the Only Being. Question: Were the four elements part of the manifestation, life of the Only Being? Answer: They are all the outcome. The duality is the outcome of manifestation. In the origin there is unity, oneness; all duality is manifestation. Question: We hear them spoken of as great beings. Answer: These four powers are great powers which work through all planes of existence, and which play their role in every form. Question: As thoughtdg necessitates movement or mental ac- tion, it is difficult to see how it arose in the absolute before the manifestation. Answer: In the absolute thought69 did not rise. It was the con- sciousness which was its predisposition, which was in it, in its being. That woke, just like a person who is asleep. It does not mean that it is not his disposition to wake up. It is his nature to wake up, but he wakes up from the sleep. The waking was the first impulse towards manifestation. That distinct impulse is called WaMat. But to understand these two distinct planes is rather a difficult thing, because it is most fine and delicate; the difference between wahdat and wah- daniat: to become conscious is one thing, and to become self-conscious is another thing. One person is asleep, just a little awake; a little noise would tell him something is going 67.

Therefore it is the Logos. Question: Are not all five elements in their essence colour- 1 ess? Answer: In the essence everything is colourless. The nearer to the essence, the less colour there is. But it is the colour by which they are distinguished in the outer planes.

We cannot call silent consciousness no consciousness. If there was no consciousness there would never have been a consciousness. It was the development of the consciousness of the Only Being which brought the Self- consciousness.

We do not need to think or trouble about its greatness, when it is yet so small, for the greatness of everything is according to our own ideal4, and there is One only, Who can be called great and that is Cod. As to the devotion 5among many of5 my mureeds I have not the slightest doubt; in order for me to know the devotion of my mureeds I do not need words or any outward6 expression, for devotion itself is a living thing; if there is anything living, it is devotion, but there is something more that could be done to utilize7 the8 power of devotion to its best advantage. The Sufi orderg is an embodiment, a body which is being formedl0 to deliver ~isll Message, 12the Message of God. Therefore my mureeds are the organs13 of that body, the particles14, and the more they realize15 this16, the more they will know their responsibility.

Summer School Suresnes, September 23rd, 1923 Beloved ones of God,l 2~efore the Service begins I would like to speak a few words to intro- duce the Universal What is this Universal Worship, 3this Church of AII~? Although in its infancy, it is the religion of the day and the faith of to-morrow. But what religion is it? It is the same religion of which Jesus Christ has said ' I have not come to give a new law, I have come to give the old law'. Therefore, this new Message, what is it? It is the same old Mes- sage that has ever been. Are the workers of this Message priests? No, they are the soldiers of the army of peace, the army which is working to bring about4 peace in the diverse5 religions of this world, who6 have disputed and argued, and have7 kept themselves away from one another, looking upon one another's religion as something wrong. Then what is our idea in this Service? Our idea in this Service is the8 learning, we learn something here. We learn by this Service that wisdom, gwhenever and wherever timeg it came to the world, was one and the same truth, the truth which is the only religion, and it is truth which will save. 101s itlo not then the religion of Christ, without limiting the Master only to a certain period and only to a certain book? To the thought- ful person it is the Message of Christ. But is it not also the Message of Buddha, is it not of Mohammed, and Moses, of Abraham, and Solomon?

If they came with many truths, there must be many Cods, and if there are many Cods and many truths, then we cannot understand one another's language, beyond it we cannot understand onell another's heart. But it is not so. We can understand one another's heart, even if we cannot understand one another's language. But what does it teach us? It teaches us that in this world of variety, in this world of names and forms, where we see each other separated and divided, individually and collectively, by being different nations and religions, in that spirit we are one and the same, and in that spirit we can unite. Can that be religion for one moment which can separate the children of God from one another by l2 the name of faith, by the name of religion? Where lies true happiness? In the understanding of one another, in our unity with one another, in our harmony with one another. Imagine the troubles that the13 humanity has gone through the past few years, do these troubles seem to end? Not at all. If the troubles seem to end in one form, then in some other form they arise. It seems as a blood poisoning, that if one wound is healed, at some other place it takes its outlet. And how can the world be purified and rise above this difficulty? Not by political and financial activities. No, the religion is the healing of the world of humanity. And which religion? Not this religion or that relig- ion. 'The' religion, the only religion. The religion which is the religion of Hindu, of Moslim, of Christian, and of Jew, and of everyone. For we all, whatever be our cast, creed, race, nation or religion, can only unite in one, and that is that one God and in truth.

In reality this Movement is the answer to the cry of humanity. Whose answer? Cod's answer. If it is a religious Movement, it is not a Move- ment to make6 propaganda for a7 particular creed. It is a religious Move- ment in this sense that this Movement is meant to bring about peace between the followers of all religions. It is a religious Movement in this sense that we all may learn, whatever be our belief or faith, whatever be8 the faith of our ancestors, that we may learn to respect the religion of another. That eventually by doing so we may rise to that state of under- standing, when to our mind comes one religion as the sum total of all relig- ions. At that moment we rise above the differences and distinctions which come from the narrow outlook of man, from his limitation, and we begin to understand that this religion or that religion, its name and its form, was only a cover. A cover over that religion which always was and which always is and which always will be. God is one, the truth is one; how can there be two religions? There is one religion, the only religion.

By not teaching them this one deprives them of a great virtue. For the' joy and happiness lies8 in the appreciation of a certain thing of9 condition. Prayer trains the soul to be more appreciative of God's goodness. One can pray silently, yes; but sensation is psychological. Saying words lohas power, they gol0 through the akashas of the body, re-echot1 in the inner plane of our being. So prayer repeated1* has greater effect on the soul than sil- ence13. Prayer is done for our own benefit, and not for God's benefit. Notes: This lecture was flrst published in The Unity of Religious Ideals, Part VII The Sufi Movement, last part of chapter 5 (1929).

Geneva, Salle de I'Athine'e, October 6th, 1923 The Christ Generally what is known by everyone in the world about the Christ is in1 the idea of the Lord and Master Jesus Christ, in whom the2 humanity had seen that divine spirit reflected on the3 earth in the form of man. Recogniz- ing that in that particular being, humanity has held forever that thought of Jesus Christ. No doubt there has always been a dispute over the question whether the Master was human or divine. ~nd~ some, those5 who had6 considered the Master divine, they separated him from human; and some who considered him human, they tried to keep him from that divine identity which was in the3 point of fact his own. However, it can never be out of place, it can never be an exaggera- tion, if one said that it was in Jesus Christ that the likeness of Cod was to be seen, proving the phrase of the Bible that 'We have created man on7 Our Own Image ' . In reality the art of the artist is expressive of his soul, of his being; and so the whole creation is the expression of the divine spirit of God. And why is it that in the Bible there must be that special hint that 'We have created man on7 Our Own Image\"? Not the trees, nor the plants, nor the stones, nor the rocks. Why not the animals and birds? All are the creation of the Lord. The reason is a most subtle one, most complex. The creation is the creation of God, but the aspect of the creation through which God expresses Notes: An unusual document was found in the archives, a handwritten transcription by Sakina of her sh. reporting (\"Sk.h~r.sh.tr.~O, probably made in later years.

It was something which won1' the hearts of humanity. It was something that attracted every soul that the Master met, as he had said to the fishermen: 'come12 hither, I .will teach you the fishing of the hearts of men.' What does it mean? It means that to this13 end man was created, that he may cultivate, that he may develop in his heart, in his character, that beauty which is called divine. If there is any religion, if there is any moral, if there is any education, if there is any civi- lization, it is the unfoldment of the soul, it is the development of the char- acter.

I would like to tell my mureeds what responsibility it is and what an opportunity it is to be on the soil of Geneva to work for this Cause of Brotherhood. This place, the soil of Geneva, is not only the place which is chosen by all the nations to form a league of nations to work for the humanity and for peace, but also destined by God that the centre of this universal harmony and peace from a spiritual point of view may also be formed here. It is therefore our privilege, which is our blessing, to be here together and to think of forming that2 league of friendship beyond all the difference3 and distinctions of faiths or beliefs. What is the meaning of the word Gen'eve? The meaning of the word Ceneve in Sanskrit language is the sacred thread. And who must prove the meaning and the value of this sacredness? It is us who are serving in that sacred Cause to bring about harmony and peace for humanity. We unite here on the soil of this land, coming from different countries, being4 born in dif- ferent lands, and yet come here with that brotherly love to do good for one another, and we are welcomed by the people of this land with open arms to discuss the affairs of the world and the affairs of humanity for the benefit of which all the people are anxious and happy5. Now what benefit there is 6for our Movement in storet6 From the spir- itual point of view it is destined, it is promised that the Message must spread, that the Message must reach in7 all the parts of the earth. But the other benefit which is attached to the centre being here on the soil of Geneva is, that people coming from all different nations with the idea of uniting the world, bringing about better understanding, harmony or peace, Notes: 1.

But from a mystical point of view number is not counted, it is the depth, it is the sincerity, it is the solidarity of the faith which is the thing and which is9 counted. Now I should like to explain a little more what work we have to do in the Movement of Brotherhood. Is it political work,? Not at all. We have the League of Nations here to discuss for it, we do not need to discuss uponlo that matter. Our love for humanity, our good will, our desire for the1 l fra- ternity, that itself will spread as an atmosphere congenial to those who will come to discuss matters at12 the League of Nations. Then are we to discuss socialism? That is also not necessary. There are several unions and there are various movements working on that question. That is not our promise13, that is not our work. Then are we to discuss the difference of the faiths and re- ligions? Not even that. The problem that is before us is that problem, that, when that problem is solved, the divine light will manifest. And that problem is what purpose is behind this whole creation, what purpose is behind the life of an individual. And how 14best we can14 solve this problem, that is the subject of our study. And it is the work of our practice.

He arrives at one stage, and that stage is the stage of brotherhood. What does it show? It shows that the first lesson that we have to learn in this world is brotherhood, and the last lesson, after learning all philosophy and mysticism, and18 our efforts, is brotherhood. Then remember my friends, that19 you studied Sufism for twenty years, all the problems of metaphysics and philosophy, and if that spirit of brotherhood were not developed in you, you must be sure that prog- ress has not been made.

It is nothing what has been done to us, if only we did all we wished to do, that is what counts. Either learning or wisdom, possession or power, or wealth, all these things gained are very small compared with what one can give to the others.

It is living that brotherhood, and realizing that one Source of all which is the Father, and in Whose Fatherhood we observe brotherhood.

I am also happy to see our reverend Cheraga the ~aroness~, to who the credit of our Movement being in the land of Switzerland is greatly due, who was one of the first members, the pioneer mureed, to look after the plant which was sown on this ground. She has watered it and reared it faithfully and sincerely and devotedly, which will always remain on the record of the Sufi tradition. And now you will all be happy with me to know that our most sincere workers in whose house today this blessed meeting and Service is held, Mr. Dussaq and Countess Pieri, are to be ordained as Cherags, the first Cherags being ordained on the soil of Switzerland. And you will also pray and wish with me that, 'May they be granted by God. Almighty the strength and in- spiration and power to strive in the Cause of God and humanity'. Notes: 1.

Was this idea not supported by Jesus Christ, who said: 'I have not come to give a new law, I have come to fulfil the law'? If Jesus Christ said this, who else can come out and say that 'I give you a new religion'? There cannot be a new relig- ion; one could as well say that7 ' I wish to teach you a new wisdom.' There cannot be a new wisdom; wisdom is the same which was and is and 8will always8 be.

This only shows the childish character of human nature. ~helO religion which was given and which is given, wherever it is given, thelo re- ligion which was given for unity, for harmony, for brotherhood, was used by the childlike human nature to fight and to dispute and to engage themselves in battles for years and years. And the most amusing thing for a thoughtful person is to think and to see how they have given in the past history a most sacred character to the war, to the battle, and called it sacred war, or holy war. And the same tendency of making a war with one another which began in their religion, pursued11 in the time of materialism; the same tendency turned into a12 war between nations l3 . And at the same time the differences and distinctions which existed between the different faiths and beliefs still exist, and that prejudice and that difference which14 the bigotry which existed between nations, still exist in a smaller or greater degree. What does it show? It shows that the meaning of true religion has not been understood by the majority. And therefore that mission that the15 religion had to fulfil in connection with humanity, still remains to be ful- filled. And it is to16 that fulfilment that Jesus Christ has hinted: 'I have come to fulfil the law, not to give a new law'. Religion can be seen from five different points of view17: Isreligion which is known to us as certain dogmas, laws or teachings. And when we think and see the condition of the world, we see that the law is now given by the nation. Every nation now is responsible for the order and peace of the people. Besides this, the otherlg aspect of the religion wasz0 the church and the form of the service. In this of coursez1 there are differences and there will always be differences; it is the22 matter of temperament, it is the matter of tendencies and it also depends upon the customs and beliefs of the people who have inherited those tendenciesz3 of their ancestors. Some have in their house of prayer different forms and different ceremonies which help them to feel elevated; the others have a simple service. 240ne appeals to one and the other appeals to the other.24 Bk.: '*thew omitted Hq.st., hq.t., bk.: \"persistedN instead of \"pursuedm I bid.: \"at* omitted Skosh.: nearly a whole line blank Hq.st., hq.t., bk.: @*them instead of wwhlchv I bid.: 'Ithew omitted Ibid.: \"at1' instead of \"tow Hq.st.: \"point of viewsn; Hq.t.: \"point of viewsw with \"sW on *lvie~s~~ crossed out and f*sl* added to wpoint** Hq.st., hq.t.: 1 )I* Inserted; 6k.p.: l*1)\" crossed out \"The first is\" written in; Bk.: \"The firstf* Hq.st., hq.t., bk.: **secondll instead of I*otherff Ibid.: \"isn rather than wwasf* Bk.: \"of course'* omitted Hq.st., hq.t., bk.: **a\" rather than *'the\" Ibid.: \"that tendency\" in place of *tthose tendencies1* Bk.: \"The one appeals to the former and the other appeals to the latter.'* instead of \"One appeals to one and the other appeals to the other.'*"},{"pageNumber":778,"pageContent":"No doubt the world is evolving to uniformity, and as now we see a25 very great difference between the form26, the form2' of everything, of dif- ferent customs of meetings28, of dressing and many other things, that people are coming to a certain uniformity.

But that does not mean that that name limits that ideal. There is only one ideal, the divine ideal. Call him Christ, and let the same Christ be known by different names, given to him by various communities. For instance, a person who has a great devotion, a great love and attach- ment for his friend, and he53 is speaking about friendship in high words, and he is saying what a sacred54 thing55 it is to become friends.

There will always be fights and discussions that68 'The Cod of our family is one and the God of your family is another.' There have always been fights. In the old times there was a dispute between69 people saying that the God of Beni70 Israel was a special God; and so every community and every church made its God a special Cod. If there is a special God, it is not only a spe- cial God of 71 community, but a God of every being72. For man has to make his own Cod before he realizes the real Cod. But that God which man makes within himself becomes in the end the door by which man73 enters that shrine of ~od~~, the real Cod which75 is in the heart of man. And then one begins to realize that God is not a Cod of a certain community76, but77 Cod is the God of the whole being. And when78 we come to another aspect of religion, which is not nec- essarily the law or the ceremony or the divine ideal or God, which is apart from all these four, that is something living in the soul, in the mind, and in the heart of man, the absence of which keeps man as dead, and the pres- ence of which gives him life.

In this life there are so many liquors that man drinks: the love of wealth, 33the passion, the anger, the greed, the love of power, the desire of Sk.sh.: Sk. crossed out \"the powern and inserted \"power and wealthn in Ih.; Gdeh.: \"the wealthv, changed into \"the power and wealthm; E.t.: \"the power and wealthv; Hq-st., Sk.l.tp., bk.: \"power and wealthm Hq.st., bk.: \"in whose eyesw added Gd.h.: \"ofw added; Eet., hq-st., bk.: \"ofn Gdeh., e.t., hq.st., bk.: \"aboutn omltted Ibid.: \"lessenedn Instead of \"lessw Hq.st., bk.: \"In his eyesn omltted Ibid.: \"then added Gd.h.: \"ton added; Sk.sh.: afterwards Sk. added \"ton In very light pencil; Eet., hq-st., bk.: \"to\" Eat., hq.st., bk.: nsoul\" instead of \"personn I bid.: \"praisesw Hq.st., bk.: \"blamesn Ibid.: \"then omitted Bk.: \"for\" instead of full stop Hq-st., bk.: \"forn Instead of \"ton Bk.: \"is he\" instead of \"he isw Ibid.: \"forn instead of \"ofn Ibid.: \"then omitted Gd-he, e.t., hq.st., bk.: \"then omitted Bk.: \"does .... wantn instead of \"the drunken person wantsw Gdeh., e.t., hq.st., bk.: \"thinkn instead of \"carew E.t.: \"the passlon, the anger, the possessionw instead of \"the passion, the anger, the greed, the love of power, the desire of possessionu; Hqost., bk.: \"passion, anger, possession\"; Hq-t.: afterwards Sk. added \"greed, the love of power, the desire ofw after \"angern"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"posse~sion~~. Man is not 340nly satisfiedB4 with possessing the29 earthly properties, but he also wishes to possess those whom he pretends to love. In this way he35 proves to be tyrannous and foolish. For all things of this world that man possesses, he does not in reality possess them, only he is possessed by them, 36may it be36 wealth or property, or37 friend or possession38 or rank. The soul with divine manner is therefore sober compared with the drunken man of this39 world. It is this soberness that produces in him that purity which is called Sufism, and it is through that purity that God reflects in his mirror-like soul. For the soul who reflects Cod, nothing frightens, for he is above all fright; for he possesses nothing and all fright is connected with the possession40 that man has. Does it mean that he leaves the world and goes and passes his life in the cave4' of the mountain? Not in the least.

When we do not understand the real nature and character of life, we make our difficulties. I can assure you that in every man's life 5 percent of the difficulty is that which the condition of life brings about, but 95 percent is the difficulty which is caused by our- selves. And now you will ask me, where does it come from when it comes from ourselves? We do not love struggle in life, we do not like strife, we only want harmony, we only want peace. But it must be understood that before making a peace, a war is necessary and that war must be with oneself. Our worse enemy is our self, our faults, our weaknesses and our limitations. And our mind is such a traitor. What it does? It covers our faults even from our own eyes and points out to us the reason for all our difficulties: 'others.' And so it deludes us constantly, keeping us unaware of the real enemy, and pushing50 us towards the others, to fight with the others, showing us that they are our enemies. But beside51 this we must tune ourselves to Cod; as higher we rise, so high becomes our point of view and as higher our point of view, so wide the horizon of our sight. And in this way when a person evolves higher and higher, his point of view becomes wider and wider and so all that he does; in it he strikes that divine note, the note which is healing and comforting and peace-giving to all souls. Question: 521 am asked to 52 the meaning of that subtle phrase which is in Gayan: \"The mother was the stepping-stone of ~esus\" .53 Answer: The human nature is such that he very often forgets, seeing the great glory of the Master, that modest and humble help which was given in the time of need and which enabled the Master to show forth his divine glory. That soul which was to manifest as Jesus and that soul which was to expand as Christ, was enabled to come on earth by the mother. It is therefore that in every case the thought and consideration for the mother is important. This saying only shows that even Jesus Christ, the Master and the manifestation of the Almighty God, was dependent upon his mother for his manifestation. 50.

Very often what happens? A man loses the chance of attaining something by his over-enthusiasm, because it puts the3 life out of balance. At the same time the power of impulse is a great power. The person who has no strength in his impulse must certainly lose. It is to strike a balance between impulse and control. There must be an impulse, but it must be under control. A person who is over-joyous 4at the4 having the5 riches, must be sure that he will very soon lose. And the same is with everything. And the balance is kept by knowing that 'there is nothing too good for me in this life of the earth', %hat 'compared to all things that the earth can offer, my soul to me is more precious.'

It is not by over- enthusiasm, for over-enthusiasm is intoxicating. A person intoxicated by enthusiasm is liable to do the wrong thing instead of the right thinglo. It is always the inner power which is the secret of attainment. And the less the inner power is expressed the better it is. A person who allows his power an outlet, he only wastes it. It is the conserving of the power which makes man a reservoir of power, the power with which all things can be accomplished. To the person who has attained to the mystery of Sadhana, the attainment, for him there is nothing in thisl1 world which12 cannot be attained; all is within his reach, all within his power, all within his grasp. As high as13 one's object se-high I40f attainment14, asI5 high one arises; and as low the object of attainment be, so low stands16 the person. If the object is honour-giving, the person is honourable; if the object is painful, the person is sad; if the object be pleasant, the person is joyous; if the object is exalting, the person is holy; and therefore a17 person must know what object to keep before one's view, what object one should pursue through life. There are many childlike people who do not know what is their object in life. One minutel8 they think of one thing, another minute they think 19it isI9 another thing. In the end they arrive to20 nothing; because they have no object set before their view.

He only will upset. Neither he can attain for himself, nor 23he can23 help another. Therefore it is a thing to be remembered continually that one must make one's mind so clear as to see one's object before oneself; to see its character, its nature, its value, and then to set forth in its pursuit, every effort to pursue the object patiently till one has attained it. No matter how small the object, the attainment of it builds one step towards the final goal. Question: \"The ideal is the means, but its breaking is the goal .\" What is the breaking of the ideal? Answer: 24~he true ideal always is hidden behind a man-made ideal which covers it. For instance, the fragrance is hidden under the petals of the beautiful rose. And when you have to take the spirit out of it, you have to crush it. By that the same rose which was to last for twenty-four hours, has been turned into the spirit, into the essence which can last for you for the whole life. That is what is made by the ideal. Question: Is it not often necessary to raise one's ideal still higher, even before attaining to it? Answer: It depends upon what ideal. If that ideal is such which could be made higher, no doubt, in raising the ideal, the soul is certainly raised. Question: Is it not generally that one's ideal, the more one approaches it, the more the ideal is going further away; but when you come nearer to it you still more feel far from it, because the object becomes greater? Answer: The keener your sight becomes, the greater becomes the beauty of the ideal. In that way it becomes larger. But in that way you are not removed further; in reality you are brought closer to your ideal. 23. Gd.h.: \"can he\" instead of Ifhe can1@ 24.

One thing is harmlessness. That it is a human ten- dency to hurt and harm, which man has inherited from the lower creation. It is that tendency which prompts him to kill the poor creatures and make out of them his food in spite of all the vegetables and cereals and fruits and nuts that are pro- vided for him by nature. And the other point is that for the purification of the blood and for the health of the muscles and for a general purity of the body the vegetable diet is much more preferable to the flesh food. At the same time the training in the Sufi Order is a spiritual treatment, and as a physician sees in every case what is best for that particular person, so the Murshid prescribes to his mureeds what is best for him27. There is one person, per- haps for him a vegetarian28 diet is not sufficient, or is not good; there2' meat for him is like a medicine. And therefore in the Sufi Order there is no such restriction, because the need of every individual is according to his health, and we do not make a dogma out of it. In connection with the same question I may make one30 remark, that the shepherds of the ancient times used to clad themselves with a tiger skin in order to secure their lives from wild animals when moving about in the forest, taking care of their herds. When a wise person, a good person, a kind person lives in this world of all different natures, for him it becomes more difficult to live in the gross vibrations than for the others who are perhaps more or less of the same kind. Very often therefore one hears of a person who has died young, they say: he was a good person. And there is some truth about it too. Many souls, fine and good and beautiful, come on the earth and cannot withstand the coarseness of the human ordi- nary nature. And what is diet? Diet is not for the soul, it is only for the body. And what is body? Body is a cover, a blanket. If the body is covered with the armour, then it can stand the struggle of life. And it was this reason, if ever great ones allowed themselves to partake of the flesh food, which in reality was meant for an average person. 25.

Especially after the war, the pain that the world has experienced, people are beginning to think on the subject of reconstruction. But no doubt every person looks at it according to his own mentality, and in this way the ideas about the reconstruction of the world differ very much. Considering the condition of the world as it is today, in the first place when one thinks of the financial condition, which is most essential for the3 order and peace, it is so confused and has become so difficult to solve, that it seems that 4there are4 many, with their intellect and brain and under- standing, 4helpless before this most difficult problem. No doubt there are many who will tell us that there is no other remedy for the betterment of humanity but5 the solution of the financial problem. But at the same time it seems that %he problem6, the financial problem, is becoming every day more and more difficult, and bringing nations and races and communities to a greater and greater destruction. And before this problem will be7 solved there8 is no wonder, andg great deal of damage will be7 done to many nations. And although intoxicated by thelo absorption in one's1 l own prob- lems12 of life, man does not think enough about these things, nevertheless in the end the world in general will realize the weakness, the feebleness, caused by this disorder and unbalanced condition of the financial problem of Notes: This lecture was first published in the booklet The Solution of the Prob- lem of the Day, chapter 111 (1936).

For instance, if 16for the cause l6 of one part of one's body, if l7 the other part suffers, in the end it will prove an unbalanced condition, a lack of health in the physi- cal body. What does health mean? Health means all the organs of the body in good condition, and so the health of the world means all nations, all la. When one leaves this financial question and comes to the problem of education, in spite of all the progress that has been made in the educational world, no one with thought 19will deny the fact that a19 little child, what is his age, what is his strength and what work is given to him to accomplish. It seems that in the enthusiasm of making the3 education richer and richer, a kind of load has been put on the mind of the children, and what 20does happen20? It is like a dish which was meant to be ready after half an hour's cooking, 21that dish is2' made ready in five minutes' It is perhaps burnt, it wanted a longer time. The child knows too much for his age what he does not require, what he does not value, 23, is forced upon his mind. And how few of us stop to think of this question that child- hood is a kingliness in itself. It is a gift from above that the child is grow- ing and 25when it is towards25 his growth, that it26 is unaware of the woes and worries and anxieties of life, his27 only days experiencing the kingliness of life, the days when he should play, when he should be near to the3 nature, when he should grasp what nature gradually teaches.

When 35we leave35 the problem of education and come36 to the prob- lem of nations, one becomes still more perplexed.

As Cod is omnipotent3, He loves all and His interest is in all, and so it is with the godly soul. The divine personality expressed through the godly soul, shows itself in its interest for all, whether known and4 unknown to the that soul. His interest is not only for another because of his kind nature or of his sympathetic spirit. He does not take in- terest in another person in his welfare and well-being because it is his duty, but because he sees in another person himself. Therefore the life and inter- est of another person to the godly soul is as his own. In the pain of another person the godly soul sorrows, in the happiness of another person the godly soul rejoices. So the godly soul who has almost forgotten himself, forgets also the remaining part of the self in taking interest in others. From one point of view it is natural for the godly soul to take interest in another. The one who has emptied himself from5 what is called \"self' in the ordinary sense of the word, is only6 capable of knowing the condition of another7; who7 sometimes knows perhaps more than the person himself, as a physician knows the case of his patient. Divine manner therefore is not like that of the parents to their chil- dren, of a friend towards8 his beloved friend, of a king to his servant or of a servant to his master.

For in every form of love and affection there ist0 somewhere the self is hidden, which asks for appreciation, for reciproc- ity, for recognition. The divine manner is above all this. It gives all and asks nothing in return in any manner or form; in this way proving the action of God through man. Question: Would you please tell us if every soul can attain to healing, if not a spiritual healing, at least to magnetical healing? Answer: I have very often said at different times that there is nothing which is not latent in human soul. It is only a matter of wakening it. There are certain qualities which are asleep. If you keep them sleeping, they will keep asleep, but if you wish them to wake1 l, you can wake1' them. Once they are awake you can use them. Why should one not have a spiritual healing power if the soul is there? No one exists without a soul. It is after all the power of the soul. Question: Will you please explain what you mean by the godly soul who has almost forgotten himself? Answer: I call musical soul who has almost forgotten himself in mu- sic; I call poetical soul who has almost forgotten himself in poetry; I call worldly soul who has almost forgotten himself in the world and I call godly soul who has almost forgotten him- self in God. All the great musicians, such as Beethoven, Wag- ner, who have left in the world their work, which the world will always keep as a sign of their works, they would not have done that work if they would not have forgotten themselves. They altogether lost the idea of their being themselves and in that way they became deepened in the thing they had come to give. Therefore, forgetting the self is the key to perfection.

When one loves, one must love for the sake of love, not for return. When one serves, one must serve for the sake of service, not for return. In everything one does, if one did not think of reciprocity or appreciation in any manner or form, that person in the begin- ning may seem perhaps a loser but in the end that person is the gainer, for he has lived in the world and yet held himself the-dd12 above the world cannot touch him. Furthermore that tendency to doubt, the tendency to be de- pressed, the tendency of fear, suspicion, confusion and puzzle, where does it all come from? It all comes from that thought of getting back, whether another one will give me back what I have given him. That is the thought behind it. 'If I will get the just portion back or less,' that is the thought. There will be fear, doubt, suspicion, puzzle and confusion. Because doubt--what is doubt? Doubt is a cloud that stands before the sun, keeping its light from shining. So is doubt. Doubt gathers on the soul, keeps its light from shining out. So man becomes confused and complexedt3. Once selfishness14 is developed, it breaks through the cloud. He says: 'What do I care whether anyone appreciates? I only know to do, to give the service and that is all my satisfaction. I do not look forward to get it back; that is where my duty ends. I have done and it is fin- ished.' That person is blessed because he has conquered, he has won. Furthermore it is the lack of' the knowledge of divine justice that man doubts: 'If I will get my just portion, or whether the other person will,, get the best of me.' If one looked up and saw the perfect Judge, God Himself, Whose Justice is so great that in the end the portion is made equal and even; it is only the question of the beginning, not of the end. If he only saw the Justice of God, Ishe would not become gave 15, he would trust and he would not trouble about return. If man will not return, God is responsible to return it in thousandfolds what man ever has given. 12. Sk.sh.: It apparently confused Sk. to hear the words \"the worldm pro- nounced twice.

Answer: One makes one's nature by one's likes and by one's dislikes, by one's favour and disfavour. When one has said: 'I do not like a certain thing in the eatables,' he has built a nature in himself. If afterwards he would eat the same, it would disa- gree with his nature. It is not because it was not meant to agree with him, but because he has built up that it does not agree with him. When one says: ' l cannot endure it, not with- stand it,' in all these things one makes one's nature, either agreeable or disagreeable. Either one makes one's nature so hard as a rock, the rock which will not allow anything to come in, or one will make one's nature so pliable as the water that the boats and ships all can pass through it without hurting. It gives a way to all to pass. The water is there just the same. Man by his thought makes his nature. When he says: 'I cannot agree with that,' he will not agree with it; he has made a wall before himself, he cannot agree. When one says that 'I cannot bear that person,' if he has said it once, he has made in him- self something; when that1' person comes again, that person makes him sick, that person becomes his master, he wants to runla from him, he is his master. wheneverlg this person comes, it makes him ill. It is not because that person brings him ill, but that illness he has brought it upon himself. Question: What is madzub? Answer: In short one can say, I might quote a verse of a great Persian poet, the meaning of which is that 'Be thou friend within and indifferent without.' This manner is very becoming, yet very rare. The manner of madzub is that. Of course one need not go as far as the madzub to find this manner, but very often one finds among friends and relatives, perhaps you may have seen some father2'--of course among mothers it is very difficult to find one--but a father, full of affection for his children, great kindness and love and yet no expression, no outward expression, and sometimes this manner is to be found among kings who have great love and affection for someone, or favour around him, but it is never expressed. It is there or perhaps it is expressed, but in a form that no one knows how it 16.

And sometimes one finds among friends also that manner. There is the great feeling of friendship and warmth and yet it is not seen. I will tell you a funny experience. I was traveiiing in Scotland and I was speaking in Clasgow. A young Highlander used to come and stand behind the crowd and listen to the lecture, and the response that one could see on the face of the people, there was no expression, there was a stone standing there, but standing there all the time. But the wonderful thing was that after2' the lecture was finished and when the people were looking at the literature, the Highlander was standing there also. I came out and there was a person who asked if anybody wanted to see me. There came some people, but this Highlander had not offered himself to come. He was standing there. All the people went away; he was standing there. When I went out, he did not speak to me. I went away. He was standing there. Next day he was again in the lecture. I thought: one day he did not show any response; why was he there again? The whole series of lectures went on and many showed their response. The Highlander was every day there. He would stand there, he would not be coming, but he was there till the finish of the whole affair. I felt that this man perhaps tried to understand. Then, after the series was finished, many people were very sorry, but this man was standing there just like a statue. And to my great surprise, after I had left Clasgow, on myz2 day that I came in Edin- burgh, there was the Highlander, standing with the same expression. He had followed me. I thought that he must be in- vited, so I sent someone. Of course then he was pleased that the invitation was sent, but would you believe, he did not speak one word during the whole interview. All that he had heard was so much that he could not say one word. But the friendly feeling and appreciation, he was holding it back, just like a person would hold back his tears. There is an example; of course the extreme of everything is not something that one should follow. If everybody followed it, the world could not go on. But it is something which one can appreciate; a side of it is most beautiful: that it is so sincere and true. It gives the idea that there can be a love, appreciation and friendliness, it is so secure and sincere and lasting, and yet it has no outer expression. Of course, what we call madzub is the friend of Cod, the lover of God, who hides his love for Cod before his fellow men. He does not want them for one moment to think that he is in love with God. Everything he does to hide his love; he puts it in such a form that it confuses the other manz3, who 21. Ibld.: Sk. read lllfw for llafterll from her sh. 22. Ibid.: \"then Instead of \"myI1 23.

Sadhanal The secret of life is the desire to attain something, the absence of which makes life useless. Hope is a sustenance of life; and hope comes by the desire of attaining something. Therefore the wish to attain something is in itself a very great power. The object a person holds to be an object of attainment may be much smaller compared to the power one develops in the process of attainment. Therefore the Hindus call the attainment Sadhana; the power gained through attainment is called in Sanskrit Siddhi, which is the sign of spiritual mastership. By learning the mystery of attainment one learns the divine mystery which is suggested in that phrase of the Bible which says: 'Thy will be done on earth as is2 in Heaven.' This phrase is a veil which covers the mystery of attainment. The man who is the instrument of Cod on coming on the earth loses so to speak a connection with that divine power, whose instrument man is; thus depriving not only himself but even Cod aeeempItsIt+nd helping His will to be done. Man, who is born to be the instrument of Cod, when he does not perform his mission properly he naturally feels dissatisfied. It does not mean that he does not accomplish what he desires, that is why he is unhappy, but he does not help God to make His will be done, by keeping himself disconnected with Cod, Who is his innermost being. This condition is like a hand coming out of joints; for it is not that the hand suffers only, but the person whose hand it is, not being able to use his hand, suffers also. Therefore in accomplishing the work one undertakes, in attaining to the aim one has in life, man does not only help himself, but also he serves God.

Answer: It is a metaphorical expression; but at the same time one can understand by this a philosophical truth: that life means pain or pleasure. The absence of pain or pleasure is death. The Heaven as expressed by the Scripture, or hell--both--have either pain or pleasure. What is void of pain and pleasure is not what may be called in our ordinary sense of the word 'life.' Life is either pain or pleasure. And if one wishes to live, either he must accept pain or pleasure, whatever he can gain. But where these two are absent it is no life, it is death. Now coming to the Bible. From the beginning to the end, what is the teaching of Jesus Christ? To rise above mortality, to find out eternal life, )which means:) to learn the art of being, the science of being. All Scriptures, all religions, every philosophy, or mysticism teaches this. Now there is the question, why do they teach this? The answer is that-what: there is one thing undesirable, and that is mortality. Death, no sane person will ask death. Desire for death is unnatural desire. And if mind is craving for death, the soul is longing to live. The soul is living, is life; it does not want to die. Death is something foreign to it; it does not know death. Therefore the smallest insect, whose life is most insignificant, protects itself in every way in order to avoid death. And so it is the longing of every soul. If any soul thinks that it longs to die, it is its mind, not the in- nermost being. Question: Is it not true that to express a1 ways weakens a thing, and to repress strengthens it? Answer: There is always a limit to expression and repression. Too much expression might kill a thing, and too much repression might deaden a thing. Too much of everything must be avoid- ed. For instance, sometimes prisoners who are sentenced to the life's imprisonment, after being in a prison for a certain length of time, they lose their mind. Because the prisoner is alone there, no one to speak to, there is no expression. And by being by himself all the time he loses his mind. If this person were brought among people again, he proves to be insane. 4. Km./Sk., Sk.l.tp.: \"In the Gayan we find1' instead of 1' Gayan . . II .

One can see the beginning of the spirit of brotherhood when one sees the flocks of birds flying in the sky together, when one sees the herds of animals in the forest together and the swarms of little insects all living and moving together. No doubt in man this tendency of brotherhood is pro- nounced, for man is not only capable of realizing the spirit of brotherhood but2 fulfilling that purpose which is hidden in this natural tendency. What is called good or bad, right or wrong, sin or virtue, the secret behind %his all3 diversity is one, and this secret is that all that lea& to happiness is right, is good, and is virtuous; and what leads to unhappiness, that is wrong, that is evil, and if there is any sin, it is that which may be called a sin. When corning to the idea of brotherhood, it is not something which man has learned or acquired, it is something which is born in man, and according to the development of this spirit man shows the unfoldrnent of his soul. Coming to the great religions which have been given to the world, for instance when we read in the Bible the words of Jesus Christ, what do we read? 'Love your fellow man, love your neighbour,' from the beginning to the end. lf4 any moral that the Master has5 taught and has repeated con- stantly, it was this moral, the moral of brotherhood. The different religions which 6are existing6 in the world, the followers of which are perhaps mil- lions and millions, 'if one studies their religion, what is the central thing of it all? It is the one and the8 same brotherhood; love one another, serve one another, be sincere one to the other. Notes: This lecture was made Into Social Gathekas numbers 13 and 14.

The first tendency of brotherhood, of love, brings him satisfaction, and happiness to the other. The other tendency of hating his brother brings him dissatisfaction, and unhappiness for the other. Broth- erhood therefore is creative of happiness, and what+ the spirit which is contrary to it, is productive of sorrow. When we read the Scriptures of great religions in this world, be it Bible or Kabbala, or Qur'an, Gita, or Buddhist scriptures, in some form or the other, the manner best suited to the people to whom the religion was given, it was the sameg symphony, it was the same music which was per- formed before them. The great teachers of the world, lowhenever, and whatever time they came to the world,1° were they especially engaged in giving the mystical or occult teachings to the world, or were they engaged in discussing the philosophical problems? Not at all. Though they were mys- tics, they knew philosophy, they knew occultism. But that was not the prin- cipal thing that they came to give. If ever they have done anything, or given to the world anything, it was that simple philosophy which is never new to anyone. Even a child knows: love one another, be kind, be sincere, be serviceable to one another. And one might ask +f-+t+s 'when it is a simple thing, and so simple that even a child knows it, what necessity1' that the great ones, the godly souls should have come and taught it?' It is most simple and yet most diffi- cult to live, and man does not accept 12any teaching1* from someone who does not live it. And if he accepts it, he will not hold it long. Therefore they came with the love from above to the world, and lived that simple moral, that simple philosophy of brotherhood. The Mogul emperor of Hindu- stan who was a great poet--in the history we read his name, Chasnavi-- 13he writes that 'having been born13 in a palace, and having reigned from the first day that I came on the earth, I saw nothing but thousands and thousands of people bowing before me. But the day den in my life when I learned my first lesson of love, my proud head bowed and bent before every slave that was14 standing before me l5 ; then16 those who were standing before me as my1' servants I then felt that I was their slave.' 6 What does it show?

There are many relations, there are many connections in this world, oft8 blood, and byI8 law19. But the great relationship is friendship. But what is the culmination of friendship? It is the culmination of friendship which is called brotherhood. Brotherhood means perfect friendship20. 20~~t now comes 21a question, a question that21 how this brother- hood-principle22 may be lived, how may it be practised? It is most difficult to teach this principle to anyone. The best of way of teaching 23its princi- ple23 is of24 living it oneself.

And the absence of anything, one could have endured, but the world cannot be happy and the order and the peace of humanity attained57 in the absence of brotherhood, the brotherhood which can be learned and that every person has the facility of learning in his life.

Fire starting from two ends of a certain line, will be attracted75 to the other flame, which is coming from the opposite end and will meet and will become one. And so an artist is attracted to an artist, thinker to thinker,76 and the man of action to the man of action. It is not that they are attracted because there is the same element in them. No, no. 77~ecause there is a comfort, there is a happiness there 78to be78 attracted by the same element. Think of the joy when two people of79 the same thought meet together.

Very often a person asks of5 himself if it is a fate6 which governs his life or if it is his free will. And there is one7 temperament that takes one point of view and there is another temperament who8 takes the other point of view. And when the people of these two opposite points of view meet together and discuss, geach hasg a thousand reasons to give in support to their own argument. For instance the man who thinks that thelo fate governs life, hell can find a thousand reasons by examining his own life, by looking at the life of another, when one12 thinks of the mystery behind what we call coincidence, when one finds the secret of what one calls accident, and when one finds the times in life when success comes continually, other times when failure follows failure.

Often it hap- pens that in one week's time a person has heard from several places a15 bad news, and there are times when in one day's time perhaps, from many corners a good news comes. If a person wishes to see the truth behind what one calls fate, there are a thousand reasons. For instance, is it always the qualified who is successful? 161s it always the most learned &-wses-the name-bigh-ef whose name and fame rises1' high? l6 Is it always the most capable who becomes rich? Not always, very often quite the contrary. Often you will find a businessman, very little he knows about his business, but every move he makes, there is a success. And there is another man, perhaps he has learned and experienced and understood business, and yet he tries all. his life18 is not l9 there. And when we come to think about the point of view of those who think that there is a20 free will, there is no such thing as fate, we can give a thousand arguments in support to21 their idea also. There are many in this life who are lazy and inactive, and they will always say that 'it is because of my fate that things go wrong, there is no use taking any step.' They remain where they are. Besides, a person who has the desire22 to attain either health or wealth or power or rank or position, learning or wisdom, it is all attained by wisdom23, by hope. One finds in the lives of individuals, as well as of the people collectively24 those who make the effort to advance: there is the advance. In support to25 the idea, to25 the belief of the fatalist, one may quote a saying of the English language that 'man pro- poses, Cod disposes,' and in support to26 those who believe in free will, one might quote an English saying that 'where there is a will there is a way.'

And we come to a realization that from the point of 30view of29,30 metaphysics, from a mystical point of view, both are right, and yet both lack the complete idea. It is like the blind people after having seen the elephant by touching: one day some blind people were allowed to see the elephant. As they could not see, they went near the ele- phant and touched it. And coming together, they began to dispute and to fight. 31Che had felt that the trunk was the elephant, the other had felt its leg to be the elephant. When the argument went still further, there came a fight3' on32 fists. And only33 someone who had seen the elephant, he34 said: 'My friends, both are right, only that you have seen the part of the elephant, I have seen the whole.' The mystical point of view comes from the study of life, from the observation of life. The nature of creation is such that not only every object 35is an but even every person is an object. A chair is made to sit upon and a table is made to write upon, and so every object is made for a certain purpose, and so36 there is a 37pu rpose 38 . Of course a person will become offended if he was told that they are3g a thing, not a being. But one must know that a soul begins its life as a thing. As everything, every object is affected by the climate, and the weather has its influence upon every object, so on human beings.

And when a person is standing at the bottom of this life's mountain, he is a thing, he is subject to fate; he is not only subject to the planetary influences and to the effects from %he visi- ble and an invisible world, but he is also under the influence of his own thought, speech, and action.

And experiencing this freedom as he goes upwards, so more67 and in this experience he finds that secret of free will.

It shows one is conscious of his Heavenly heritage, the other is buried in his earthly heritage. A success for the first one is not a difficult thing. Whatever be the situation, whatever be the difficulty, he will make his way. The condition will be heartbreaking, but his heart is something which cannot break, it breaks conditions that stand against it. A person of the latter kind, he is hopeless71, he is pes- simistic, he has no courage, he has nothing to look forward to in life. His life becomes worse than death. For what is life? Life is not even the exper- ience you have just now, life is something you look forward to. Rich envi- ronments, comfortable surroundings, these do not give happiness; they give pleasure, comfort for the moment, they do not give life. Life is hope, life is aspiration72, that which raises the eyes looking at the horizon, that some- thing which I expect will come, must come. That soul is living, not only living, but life-giving to those who have lost their life. Therefore, friends65, it is good for a pastime to dispute whether it73 is fate or whether it73 is no fate, whether it73 is free will. Both these contrary beliefs are true, and yet the truth is beyond it. What is, then, the teaching of the ~ufis~~ in this respect? The teaching of the ~ufis~~ is to observe life keenly, to analyze oneself, one's being, and to fight within oneself what heritage one has from the earth and what heri- tage one has from Heaven. Then one knows how to make the best of these heritages, when one knows how to expand oneself in order to draw from Heaven the divine which is given to man. And by doing this one raises above life's difficulties and troubles and worries which make one helpless. And as one goes on in one's study and practice of what we call Sufism, one begins to see every moment of the day an expansion of the soul and unfoldment of the spirit. The development of each being will not be at the same speed, but it will be in accordance to every individual's response to that divine heri- tage.

And it is natural that there should be various beliefs, for the reason that every man has 3his own conception3, his own conception of Cod. There is no comparison between Cod and man. The. reason is that, man being limited, he4 can be compared with another being; Cod being per- fect, He is beyond comparison. The prophets and Masters in all ages have tried their best to give man some idea of Cod's being. But it has always been difficult for it is impossible to define Cod in words. It is like trying to put the ocean in a bottle. However large a bottle, 5the ocean5 it can never accommodate5. The words that we use in our everyday language are the names of limited forms, and we give God a name for our convenience, someone who is above name or form. And if there is any possibility of understanding Cod and His Being, it is only possible6 in finding the relation between man and Cod. The reason why the7' subject 8of this evening8 was called 'Man, the seed of Cod'? ~ecause~ it is this picture which gives to some extent that idea of the relationship which exists between man and Cod. 'O~here is a root and there is a stem, and there are branches and there are leaves. There comes a flower, but in the heart of the flower there is something which tells the history of the whole plant. One might say that it is for the sake of the flower that the plant was purposed; but really speaking it is the seed which comes in the heart of the flower which con- tinues the race of that plant. It is that seed which is the secret of the plant, which is the source and the goal of that plant. It is that seed which was the beginning, it is from out of that seed that the root came, and the seedling came out, and so it became a plant, and then that seed disap- Notes: After February, 1927 this lecture was made into Social Gatheka no. 39.

But after the coming of the leaves and branches and the flowers it appeared again. It appeared again, not as one seed, but l1 several seeds, in multiplicity, and yet it is the same. And it is this seed which told12 us the story that first it was the seed, and then the whole plant appeared. And towards what goal, what result? In order to come again as the result of a whole plant. ~0~~ the man of simple belief, to13 the man who believes only in his particular idea, for him14 there is no relation between God and man. ~utl~ the man who wishes to understand the relation between man and God, for him the proof of this argument is to be found in everything. And it is this idea which is spoken of in the Bible, in the words where it is said that 'on l6 Our Image We have created man.' If the seed out of which the plant came, and which came in the result, had said that 'Out of my own image I have created the seed which will come forth from the heart of the flower,' it would have been the same thing. Only that seed out of which the plant came could have said that 'I shall appear in plurality, although in the be- ginning I am one grain.' It is this idea again which tells us of the reason that why it is said that 'We have created man on17 Our Image,' when the whole manifestation, the whole creation has come eat-ef from Cod, that the leaf and the branch and the stem, all have come out of the seed. But that is not the image of the seed. The imagela is the seed itself. But not only this, the essence of the seed is in the seed. No doubt, there is some energy, some power, some colour, some fragrance in the flower, in the leaf19 and in the stem; but at the same time all the property that is in the stem, flower, petal and leaves is to be found in the grain, This shows to us the result that man is the culmination of the whole creation, and in him 20is the whole universe manifest20. ~ither~l the mineral kingdom or22 vegetable kingdom or animal kingdom, these are all to be found in the being, in the spirit of man. It does not mean that the different properties such as mineral and vegetable arez3 to be found in the physical body that is made for man. But also his mind, his heart, show all different qualities.

No doubt, there is another side of the question. As man evolves, so he finds the limitation^^^, the errors, and the infirmities of human nature. And so it becomes difficult for him to live in the world and to withstand all that comes. Also it becomes very difficult for man to be fine, to be good, to be kind, to be sensitive, and at the same time to be tolerant. And what comes as a tendency, is to push away everything, and to find oneself76 away from everybody and every being. But the purpose of being born on earth is dif- ferent. The purpose of being born on earth is to find that perfection which is within oneself. And however good and kind man77, if he has not found the purpose, for what purpose he is born on earth, he has not fulfilled the object of his life. There are as many different aspects of that purpose 78as many people there are7* in the world. But behind all different aspects of that purpose there is one purpose.

Before the service commences I would like to speak a few worck to in- troduce the idea of our movement. The Sufi Movement has three aspects of its work: the esoteric work, the devotional service and the third, the activ- ity of brotherhood, the activity the meeting of which took place this after- noon and the religious activity you will see here, In spite of all the different opinions of the different people in the world, it is an undeniable fact that humanity needs religion greatly. But which religion does it need? Does it need the sectarian religions as of old? No. Mankind is getting tired of that idea of being confined in a sect. And the new generation today is beginning to see that there is no such religion in this world which can be considered inferior to its own and therefore that narrow outlook of the sectarians of the religions does not appeal to him. Now the question--if the Sufi Message is a new religion. 'certainly it cannot be a new religion. When Jesus Christ has said that: 'I have come to fulfil the law, not to give a new law.' It is the same religion which Jesus Christ has brought still continued further.' It is one and the same stream which all prophets have brought and given to humanity, it is carried along. It is the same stream which is always there. The 2~essage of the Sufi2 is Notes: Although undated, this address may well have been given on October 15, 1923, at Geneva. Parts of this lecture were published in The Unity of Religious Ideals (1929) in Part VII The Sufi Movement: one sentence in chapter VI, \"The Symbol of the Sufi Movementtf, and a longer passage in chapter V, \"The Sufi Movementf1. Where \"bookf1 in mentioned in the notes, it refers to this edition of The unity of Religious Ideals, compiled and prepared for publication by Mursh da Goodenough. 1. 6k.p.: a similar passage (which may derive from these three sentences) appears in the bk.p.

It is the same Message which is being given to humanity.f* 2.

He leaves it to the individual to think as he thinks. He only holds his service as the proof of adhering all the teachers and respecting all the Scriptures which are respected by the collectivity. 5~ut with all its forms the Sufi idea has also the formless ideal of wor- ship. The form is to help the one who can be helped by seeing the form because all education is an education of names and forms. If there was 6no form and no name6 we would not have learned them. The form is only sug- gestive of what is behind it, of the one and same truth which is behind all religions. Therefore this service is a teaching at the same time and yet every Sufi is free to take up a form or not to take up a form; a Sufi is not bound by a form. The forrn is for his use, not to make him captive. And one may ask, is there a priesthood in the Sufi Movement? Priesthood, not in the sense as it is understood; priesthood only to conduct the service and to answer the need of a priest which is always in our everyday life. And those ordained in the Sufi Movement, are called Cherags and by other names. There is no distinction of woman or man; the worthy soul is ordained, 7who has the desire to serve humanity7, by this showing the8 example to the world that in all places, in the church, in the school, in the houseg of parliament, in the court, it is woman and man together who complete evolution. But at the same time every Sufi is a priest, is a preacher, is a teacher and is a pupil of every soul that he meets in the world.5 Since the only ideal in working is to qualify oneself in order to be a proper servant to serve the cause of God.

We have three objects in view, l2 brotherhood, 1 l2 Message, and 11 l2 eso- teric school as-the-thitd-ebjeet. The more we notice the condition of the world at the present moment, the more we will realise the necessity of human brotherhood. There has never been a greater need of human brotherhood than at the present moment. There are trade-unions, political institutions and socialist institu- tions, they all work towards this-end the same object3. Still there is a very great necessity of spiritual work4 done toward the unity of mankind. We are doing this work in different places in America, in England, in'Holland, in Belgium, in France and in Switzerland, where the centre of the Sufi Order is being established. No doubt we would prefer5 if we could do5 the work without an organisation or centre, for6 it is impossible, it is just like imagining the soul to walk about on earth without a physical body. To be without a centre means for a person to live in the cold and heat without having a house. Even the insects need a hole to live7, even the birds need nests. There are reasons 8in favour and against8, both, why the international centre of the Order must be in Geneva.

This main centre which is made to collect the Message given in different places, ' lwill l call it l1 to reproduce it, to circulate it and to preserve it for the coming generations.

The Sufi Message. The message of the Sufi Movement is a call to humanity in general to unite in a world brotherhood beyond the boundaries of caste, creed, race, nation or religion. The Sufi Movement has no particular creed, dogma, or doctrine. Its philosophy teaches tolerance to all, and, above all things understanding of one another, thereby awakening sympathy with one another, and the realization that the wellbeing of each depends upon the well-being of all. The voice of God has always warned and guided man through the divine message given by the prophets and reformers of all ages, who came in answer to the need of man. Every religion, in whatever period it was given and accepted by the people, was an answer to the cry of humanity. As the rain falls from the clouds, drawn by the need of the plants and trees, so the divine message has ever responded to the longing of souls seeking guidance. The battles that have been fought throughout the ages are chiefly caused by religious differences. The true religious ideal has as its principal aim the harmonizing of man in the unity of God. But it has always happened that the religious authorities have used religion for selfish purposes and thereby destroyed its purpose, turning the form of religion, which was a living spring of immortal life to souls, into a stagnant, dead form. The increasing materialism and overpowering commercial influence which has veiled the heart of humanity from Truth, has caused the greatest distress during the last few years.

In point of fact there is no doubt that humanity is pro- gressing. The proof of progress is to be found in all the wonderful phe- nomena that have been created in the form of marvellous scientific inven- tions. But all these inventions have only helped to carry out the greatest disaster in the history of the world, a war that has swallowed up numberless lives, among them youths who had inherited the culture of many genera- tions. In spite of the prosperity and flourishing condition that one sees, there is a total absence of the ideal. The minds of the generality seem to be centred in one thing only, and that is the struggle of life. Millions are busily occupied, physically and mentally, every moment of the day and night, in collecting wealth or treasure, the nature of which is to pass from hand to hand. As long as they have it in their possession there is a kind of intoxica- tion; when it is lost there is nothing to hold on to. This has made man more avaricious in the strife of material life. Today he is considered the most practical man who is most capable of guarding his own interests to the best advantage. The same is true of nations--each is working for its own interest. In any nation he who is called the man of the day is not the one who feels for the welfare of humanity, but the one who, exclusively, stands by the interest of his own party, community or nation. Patriotism can only be a virtue when used as a stepping-stone towards a universal brotherhood. It can be justifiable only if it is made a means to conserve forces in order to work for the welfare of all. But today patriotism has become a lock upon the hearts so that no alien may be admit- ted into a country, except only those of their own kind. What is missing in modern education, in art and science, in the social, political and commercial life, is the ideal--the ideal which is the secret of heaven and earth, the mystery hidden behind both man and God. Man, with all he pdssesses in the objective world, is poor in the absence of the ideal, and it is that poverty which creates irritation, conflicts and disagreements, causing thereby wars and disasters of all kinds. Man's greatest necessity today is the exploration of the human personality, to find there the latent inspiration and power, and upon this to build the whole structure of life. For life is not only to live, but to ennoble oneself and reach that perfection which is the innate yearning of the soul. The solution to the problem of the day is that the consciousness of humanity may be awakened to the divinity of man. The undertone of all religions is the realization of the One Life which culminates in the thought of Unity. It is to raise humanity to this consciousness that the efforts of the Sufi Movement are directed.

The hustle and bustle of life leaves very little time to man to think of his general condition. The only news he' receives in life is from the newspa- pers, and so he depends upon the papers to have some idea, and the intoxi- cation of life leaves him very little time to think about the real meaning of life. When looks around one and considers2 the condition of nations today, one3 finds in spite of all the progress there is an ill-feeling rising4 between nations. Friendship exists only for self-interest. One5 nation thinks about its own interest whether it has to deal with friend or enemy. And if we consider the world as a body, we could say that a poison has been put into the heart, owing to the feeling of hatred which arises from every person toward every other. No period like this is to be traced in the history of the world, this age has accomplished a much greater destruction than ever before. It reminds one of a spider, which weaves its web in order to get comfort, but it6 cannot get out of the web it has made itself. And if we go to the root of the subject we see all these disasters, all this disorder has7 been caused by a spirit of materialism. Money seems to be the only gain and aim. It is undeni- able that when one is continually thinking of such a subject, all one's thoughts and energy will go in that direction. And in the end perhaps man awakes and finds that all his life he has given his thoughts to something which does not last, which does not even exist and is only an illusion.

This may be called disinterestedness: Vairagya. It is not the man who leaves the world, but the one who lives in the world, understanding the difficulties and troubles that belong to humanity, who is great. It is he who sees, not his little self but the whole. Jesus Christ says: 'Think of your fellowmen, love your fellowmen'. And what do we see today? Difficulties arising between masters and workmen; peace conferences where nothing can be decided concerning peace. And all this because this point of view is not there, the point of view that 'I will do for you and you will do for me.' 'No' says everyone, 'I will do for myself and you will do for yourself.' To serve one another, to love one another, to work for one another, that should be the aim of life, which man has lost hold of altogether. Look at the central theme of the education of today. Only a short time is given to the child to prepare him for the kingliness of life and the freedom of the spirit. And every year the child's intellectual burden is getting heavier, and the older the child grows, the more he sees life before him as an ocean which he has to cross, as something dark awaiting him. And later on, the child, having become a man, gives all his time to work, to his office, and there is even no time for love or friendship, and yet, after all, he cannot even take all these things with him. After sacrificing all his life to these things, what has he really gained? By his external life in the world the complications of life have in- creased. The more laws are given, the more prisons are filled with criminals; the more contracts are signed, the less peace and brotherhood are to be found among men; something more genuine in human life seems to be neglected. And yet no man is deprived of this human inheritance. There is a treasure in himself which has to be found. There is religion which should have helped man on. The authorities of religion have very often failed to uphold the inner qualities of their religion. The question is not what religion one fol- lows, but to live one's religion. When religion has lost its hold on inner life and faith, there is nothing else. Many people, especially among the intellec- tual ones, have lost their religion, and among the younger ones there are a good many who even fear the name of Cod. Now what is needed today? It is the education which will teach hu- manity to feel the essence of their8 religion in everyday life. Man is not put on this earth to be an angel. He need not be praying in church all day long, nor go into the wilderness. He has only to understand life better. He must learn to take a certain time in the day to think about his own life and doings. He must ask himself: 'Have I done an honest deed today? Have I proved myself worthy, in that place, in that capacity?' In this way one can make one's everyday life a prayer. Among politicians, doctors, lawyers, mer- chants it might be possible to have love as the battery behind every deed, every action and a sense of harmony behind all these doings. 8.

For to live in the world is not easy, every moment of the day demands a victory. If there is anything to learn it is this tolerance, and by teaching this simple religion of tolerance to one another, we are helping the world. It is no use keeping the idea that the world is going from bad to worse. That germ of disease will spread and bring greater consequences. Every man's being is good, in the depth of his heart there is something certainly good. There are teachings about healings, but the best way is the way of character healing, healing one's own character and instead of accomplishing miracle13, in this way one's whole life becomes a miracle. The lack of relig- ion today has created a strange belief in speaking with ghosts, fairies, etc. l4 or about things one does not 15, nor can l5 understand. But this has very little to do with religion. The Bible is full of simple things, one would be happy if one could accomplish onet6 of these things. There has been a great demand for getting knowledge of occult powers etc.14 but what has man reached with all his intellectuality but the destruction of his brother? The need of the world today is not of learning, but how to become considerate to one another. To try and find out in what way happiness can be brought about, and so to realize that peace which is the longing of every soul and to impart it to others, so attaining our life's goal, the sublimity of life.

The Religion of the Heart. When we think of the different religions which are known to humanity we shall find that each of them brought to the world the message of love in some form or other. And now the question arises who brought religion in the world? And the answer is that religion has always existed in the heart of man. Religion is the outcome of the heart, and among all races, however primitive, a certain religion has existed, perhaps incomprehensible to people more evolved in different directions. For religion is instinctive, and as it is instinctive, not only in the world of man but also in the lower creation one sees a glimpse of religious tendency. For instance, one finds among pet ani- mals, such as the dog, the cat, the horse, some such faithful creatures, and sometimes one has such experiences with them that one cannot today expect from mankind. Besides this, the absorption that one sees among the birds, the little sparrows in the morning absorbed in the beauty of nature; so to speak, sing- ing a song, a hymn to Cod--that all is religion; if we can understand it. For man has made his religion so narrow that he is not able to appreciate the broad religion of nature. By being narrow he has named his creed a religion, or the particular place of worship religion, or the book religion, or the form of service religion. If one would only think that the religion when one goes in the woods, in the forests, and stands alone in the forest near the silent trees standing in contemplation through the summer and winter, through all seasons! That silent contemplation, what does it give one, what thought arises? It lifts one up and makes one think that there is a religion.

The affection and the attachment that the doves show to their mates, it is something to learn and to understand. And there are many instances, many experiences of thoughtfulness, of considera- tion, and of the nature of attachment that one sees in the lower creation, and that make1 one think that there is an instinctive religion. But then, there are stories known in the East about the elephants. In the herd of elephants there is one who always leads them and he has a stem of a tree in his trump, and he goes on feeling the earth--if there be a pit or if it be a good way for the elephants to pass. And if there was a pit, he gives a warning to his followers, that they may not fall victims to this. When we consider the birds we see that there is among them a leader who knows and understand the coming and the continuing of rain and storm, and according to that he guides them, and they all follow him. B~~ what is it all accounted for? This taking care of those who depend upon one, and then to yield, to respond, to trust someone who guides one, it is not only in the human beings, but even more in the animals. And man, who is always sup- posed to have a religion and thinks that he has a religion, has always opposed in all ages the ones who have served him, those who have wished to awaken him from his errors. The saints and the sages and the great souls who have continually tried to work for him they have always had to suffer and they were the ones who found opposition from all directions. And in this way man has shown a lesser tendency to religion than the animals. But now coming to understand what is the religion of the heart - It is said by the Sufis, ' lshq Allah, Ma' bud Allah,' the same that one reads in the Bible, that 'Cod is love.' And if God is love, where is He to be found? Is He to be found in the seventh heaven or is He to be found in the heart of man? If He were so far away as to be in the seventh heaven then it is most unfor- tunate for man to be kept far away from the very life and the very reason of his being. And it is toward this realisation that Cod is in the heart of man that all religions have taught in different ways and different forms. But so many in this world only know the word 'love', but to understand what love is or to speak about it or explain it is impossible. For whoever tries to express love makes an effort in vain, it is like trying to express God in words. Neither Cod can be expressed in words nor love. There is a saying of a Persian poet who was an emperor, 'I was destined to have so many slaves serving me, but from the moment love was born in my heart I became the slave of my every slave.' The moment love is produced, that person does not need to go and find out where the Truth is, the Truth is born. For it is the loving one, the loving heart which is capable of understanding, of com- prehending Truth. The reason is that the Truth is not outside of self, it is within us. For instance when a person's heart is melted by a terrible suffer- ing in life, it is then that what he says, or what he thinks, or what he does, 1. Hq.t.: flmake\" changed into \"makesw by Sk. 2. Ibld.: \"By\" changed into \"Butm by Sk."},{"pageNumber":846,"pageContent":"in all is a fragrance of love. What is called in the Old Testament by words, 'tongues of flame' or 'words of flame,' what are they. It rises when love has risen, it revivifies the thought, word, and action. What, generally, man knows about love is the give and take: 'if you give me 12 pence, I will give you a shilling.' For as long as one sees life in the form of business, in the form of give and take, he does not know love, and it is a great pity, when, after knowing something of love, the heart has turned cold and bitter. And what reason is there? The reason is this, that when one digs the ground one must dig until the water comes. But if one digs halfway, then there is no water, there is mud. But what is love? Love is a continual sacrifice. And what does sacrifice mean? Sacrifice means forgetting of the self. As Rumi says in his poem, the Masnavi: 'The Beloved is all in all, the lover merely veils him. The Beloved is all that lives, the lover a dead thing.'\" But what is this death? The death in life is life. Can anyone say, 'I practise in life to be good,' or 'to be re- ligious,' without having the love element? But what use can his religion be if he is praying perhaps all day, or seems to be all goodness if there is no love in his heart, what use is his religion to him? There is a story told of a young girl who was passing through a farm, and there there was a person who was offering his prayers to Cod. And according to the custom of the East, no one should cross the place where a person is offering his prayers; and she did not mind, but passed. And when she came back, this pious man was still sitting there, and he called the girl and said, 'How thoughtless of you, girl; here I was offering my prayer and you passed this place.'

Toward the One, the Perfection of Love, Harmony and Beauty, the Only Being, united with All the Illuminated Souls, who form the Embodiment of the Master, the Spirit of Guidance. The Religion of the Heart. (cont.) The power of love is seen in all things, and in whatever form it acts it shows in it a great virtue. And one does not know always what power love has behind it, that there is nothing in the world which is more powerful than love. Think of the hen with its little chickens. At the time when they are so young that they seek her protection, if the horse came, if the elephant came she would fight in defence. And how man has abused the word: love, how he uses in his false pre- tences the word: love1 What happens is that man has made a false world and in this false world he is so absorbed that he cannot see the reality. It is for this that the saints and the sages and the upraisers of mankind have been sent from time to time, because he is in a dream and he cannot awake from it. And of what does he dream? He dreams of this false world that he has created. And what is religion? Religion is what breaks away the barriers of falsehood and shows man, guides man toward the Truth. What we call kind- ness, helpfulness, gentleness, meekness, or humility, what do all these virtues come from? Are they all not made of love? They are different forms of love. That shows that there is only one stream of virtue and that is love, and all different virtues that man knows, they are all different drops falling in different directions. And the idea of right and wrong, good and bad, we can find among all different people in different ways, but in love we all unite, whether from East or South, or West or North, for no one who is thoughtful will argue on the question that cruelty is virtue and kindness a sin. There- fore from the point of view of love we can all unite in one conception of good and bad, of right and wrong. All that is guided by the principle of love has its virtue and all that is done by coldness, it is that which is wrong. And when we think of the condition through which humanity has passed in all different times--in the name of religion there have been wars and battles--one wonders if it was taught by the religion. Not at all, religion was the pretence, that men by this pretence wanted to cause bloodshed, absorbed in selfishness. And if ever there has been a kind of accusation against any religion in the world, it is not against the religion, it is against the misunderstanding of that religion by the followers of that religion. Think of the life of the great Master Jesus Christ who was the soul of religion. One sees that from beginning to end there was nothing but love and forgiveness. The best expression of love is that love which is expressed in"},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"forgiveness. Those who came with their wrongs, errors, imperfections, before the love, that was all forgiven, there was always a stream of love which always purified. If one had followed the idea of forgiveness and of tolerance, humanity would not have come to the condition to which it has come today. The hatred and prejudice and bitterness that exists today between nations is beyond words to explain. And if there were one religion or a thousand relig- ions if that were to go one4, one doubts if there be a religion. It seems that man has now the profession of it, but what is needed is to live it. Why is humanity not coming together more? It is the lack of tolerance, the lack of forgiveness, it is the lack of love. And there may be a thousand different schemes that people will make in order to make the conditions better, and every effort made in that direction is worthwhile, but at the same time there remains a question what effort would be most worthwhile. It is the waking of the divine spirit which is called love, which has been buried in the heart of man. There are many political institutions, social institutions, and moral institutions, but what is most necessary today is the wakening of the religion of the heart. It does not matter what religion they profess if they know the depth of the religion, which is love. And then, all the different forms, the forms of religious service and the forms of prayer, behind them what secret is there? The secret is to prepare the heart of that bliss which love only can give. The school of the Sufis, in whatever age, has been the school of the mystics. Its religion has been the religion of the heart, and it is therefore that there is a verse of Abul Allah, who says, 'Koran, the Bible, or a martyr's5, all these my heart can tolerate, since my religion is love alone.' For the religion of love is the religion of tolerance, the religion of love is the religion of forgiveness. The life in the world is such that it is as difficult for the rich as for the poor. A world such as this, made by falsehood, has its blows, continual blows, that a person of good heart has to stand. And there is only one safety from all these blows that might destroy the heart altogether, it is to learn how to tolerate, to learn how to forgive. For everyone says or does or thinks only according to his own particular evolution, and he cannot do better. Why not, therefore tolerate? Why not, therefore, forgive? And if there is intoler- ance, then there must be a continual reciprocity, it is giving and taking in- tolerance. It means killing the element of love and giving life to the element which is death itself. And if there is any inspiration, any revelation, that also is attained by a loving heart. The life's purpose is to make use of this shrine which is the human heart and which was made for Cod. And if there is a shrine and no Cod, the shrine is purposeless. And if there is a heart and the heart has not 4. Hq.t.: \"one1' changed into \"on1' by Sk. 5. Ibld.: Sk. added \"bone\" In the margin"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"yet attained to that ideal, the only ideal which is worthy of love, that heart has not yet attained its purpose. But no doubt it can be worthless if a person says, 'I love God, but I do not love mankind.' That profession is worthless. It is like saying, 'Friend, I love you very much, but I cannot look at your face.' The creation is the manifestation of God. It is in the art of the artist that we recognize him. If we refuse to acknowledge the art, we do not know the artist. The man who does not express his love, who does not forget himself in love, expressing it as a respect, tolerance, forgiveness, does not know religion. Of course this is the first step, that one loves those one meets on the surface of the earth. Someone asked a great teacher if he would initiate him in mysticism. The great teacher answered, 'Young man, have you ever loved?' The young man said, 'I have not.' The great teacher said, 'Then go and love first, then come to me, that is the second step.' No doubt the love of the human being which is not progressive and has not developed to the love of God, is not yet perfect. For love, is for the real Beloved, Who really deserves it and Who alone deserves it. As children learn the lesson of'home life by playing with the doll so the soul that learns, he learns in human love and completes his study in the love of God. And the love of God is that which is the purpose of the whole creation, and if that were not the purpose, the creation would not have taken place. As the whole creation is from God, then it is of God. If it is of God, then it is the manifestation of love, and the manifestation of God is purposed to realize the perfection of love.

Florence1, November 6th, 1923 Filosof ica. From Limitation to Perfection. One often asks, 'No doubt life has its many tragedies, but which is the greatest tragedy in life?' The greatest tragedy is the one only tragedy which is veiled by a thousand tragedies but which stands as the root of all tragedies; and that tragedy may be called limitation. Humanity apart, if the heart could listen to the cry that rises out of a rock, out of a tree, a plant, one would hear that even from there the cry comes of limitation. What did the saints and sages of all ages realize in their seclusion in the solitude? What did they hear after sitting under the shade of a tree for about six hours in silence? And what did they hear who perhaps passed many years of their lives in the caves of the mountains, hearing the word coming from there, that word of great patience in which the voice and cry in a rock, a tree, a mountain speaks aloud, saying, 'Patiently I have waited, waited for that moment when this limitation will break.' And those who know the language of the animals and birds, what do they hear from it? They also hear the same voice: When that day, when that hour of freedom will come, then I shall be free as I would like to be.' If one would hear the cry of the whole universe as one single cry, the cry is one and the same; 'When shall I be lib- erated, when shall I be free, when will this limitation end?' No doubt man whose life is active, whose responsibility is great, whose intellect is advanced, compared with the lower creation, his cry is greater still. Is there anyone in this world who is without this cry, without a com- plaint? Every soul has his complaint, every soul has his reason for complaint, only the story of every soul will be different. The servant will find the limi- tation of his master, the master will find the limitation of his servant, the friend is finding the limitation of his friend. From every side one finds the limitation of man, saying, 'He does not give me', or 'he does not do to me what he must'; which means, in other words, for a servant to say, 'My master is not generous enough', and for a master to say, 'My servant is not diligent enough', for a lover to say, 'My beloved is not listening', and for Notes: This lecture was first published in the magazine The Sufi, Vol. I no. 1 of March 1933, where it is included in a compilation on the subject \"From Limita- tion to Perfection\". 15.\" refers to the article in the magazine The Sufi. 1. In Italy (add. by the compiler)"},{"pageNumber":851,"pageContent":"the beloved to say, 'My lover has not sufficient love'; the mother saying, 'My child does not listen', the child saying, 'My mother is not understand- ing'; then the people of the world saying, one about someone, one about the world, one about the universe, one about Cod; then one has perhaps a com- plaint against his own weakness, follies, health, and condition. And when we leave this as perhaps only an idea, then it comes to this, that every soul without knowing what it waits for, is waiting most earnestly, not knowing for what, and yet it is waiting. You may find a person, perhaps, in such misery, before whom there is no possibility of getting above it, yet he is waiting he does not know for what. Yet his soul knows; he waits, he does not know for what. And if there were not this spirit, this something which seeks, that waits and looks forward to something, man does not know what, (it is the only thing that makes him live) if not, how many would die! Man awaits the moment of getting above his misery perhaps all through life, and yet there is something that is promising from within he does not know what; and yet he waits, not knowing for what. But what does it all mean? It means that there are things that man loves. There is wealth man loves, beauty, justice, kindness. He loves them, but he cannot get them sufficiently, because there is limitation. And then he blames, saying: 'This person does not give me goodness*, 'That person was not kind', 'That person was not just.' He is right, but at the same time he does not know that no person here is perfect. And man must know that nei- ther he will give anything perfect nor will he receive it. For this world of illusion is a phenomenon of limitation. It is a wine press where the glass of wine is offered, but only offered to touch your lips, not for you to drink it. There is that tragedy of the soul that cries out, 'Oh, I would like to have a glass of wine,' not knowing that it will only touch his lips. And the idea, 'I have found my ideal', is a dream, an illusion. In the morning he will realize, 'It is not so.' On this earth the ideal does not arrive. But it is the ideal again which is the beauty interest2 of life. The man who is interested by touching with his lips only the glass of wine, he is still in limitation, he does not know the mystery of life. And that may be said of those who are absorbed in the material life, they do not know what is within it, what is beyond it, they do not know what real joy means. The world is a market, a market where all that is sold costs more than it is worth. One is delighted at having something, considering it precious and a good bargain; but that joy has a limited time. And then a man is like Buddha, who came in this life and who looked at its limitation, and who saw every soul complaining of it, and then awoke to another consciousness. It is said that Buddha was kept by the king, his father, in a palace, and all pleas- ures and comforts were around him, and he was never allowed to go out in the world or to see the pain of the world. But the day when he was allowed to go out, what did he see? He saw the cry of limitation, the cry of help- lessness, and the longing of mankind for something, they knew not what. And he since then engaged himself in finding the remedy for the pain of life, that 2.

Now what is it seeking, what is the soul seeking in seeking different things? It is seeking only one thing, to rise above limitation, and it is that which is called perfection3. In a small way one sees this phenomenon in the world, and one wonders what the true perfection may be. For instance, from a child I had a great love for seeing the persons who have accomplished sornething in their lives, whatever it is4. For me it was a satisfaction to see a great poet, if I did not hear one poem of his, to see that personality. And once it so happened that I heard the name of a great wrestler who was the greatest of his time in my country. Personally having no interest in fighting, boxing and wrestling, yet hearing that was the greatest person, I had a longing to go and see. And when I went there and saw this man I was imme- diately won by his personality. A wrestler so great as he had a child's nature and the innocence of an infant. Being so young, standing before him just like a little plant before a large tree, and yet to find in that great man that love, meekness, gentleness, and that friendly attitude, it surprised me very much. And that became for me a key5 to understand what greatness means. Greatness is a reflection of perfection. And since then, after leaving that country of religion, of spirituality and devotion, after coming to the Western world and travelling in America, what did I find? That greatness is great- ness, whether in the East or in the West. A person who, in whatever direc- tion has touched the top note, in him there is perfection, and one can feel it in his personality. What does it mean? A person who has striven in art, phi- losophy, science, scientific inventions, in whatever line, if he has gone to the depth of what he has been interested in, he really touches perfection, which manifests in him in a special sense and in a particular quality. Nevertheless, there is one object which is the object of the seeking of every soul, and that object is the realizing of the divine perfection, and it is in that divine perfkction that there is the fulfilment of the soul's coming on earth6. And how can one find that perfection? Only by a belief in Cod? No, the belief in God is the first step, there is another step needed. And that step, the next step, is the understanding of the perfection of God. And how does one comprehend it? One comprehends it by finding all that he misses in the world of limitation in his ideal of Cod. For instance, a true worshiper of God, when he finds injustice done to him by his fellow man, does not give up the seeking for justice, for he finds justice in God. When he misses friend- ship and love and sympathy in this world of limitation, he does not become discouraged. He says, 'This is the world of limitation. What more can I expect? I will find it in the ideal of God'. When man is disappointed in the beauty of this earth which is so illusionary, and when one has found out that there is no perfection of beauty here, he is not discouraged; he finds the perfection of beauty in his God. The world has never given to anyone all 3. Ibid.: inserted 2 1/4 pages from another lecture or lectures 4. I bid.: 'lbe\" instead of wls\" 5. Ibid.: 'I, a keyv added 6.

It is Cod alone Who is rich and it is Cod alone Who has all that is missing in this world and that one can only borrow. And if man has found a glimpse of perfection, of justice and love from the examples of humanity such as Jesus Christ, that he has found from such souls who bor- rowed from Cod and have given to man. Man has said, 'This is the saint', 'This is the prophet', 'This is the sage', 'the holy man', of him in whom he has recognized kindness, love, greatness, justice, but he knows not that it is Cod's love, God's justice, and it is that which is reflected through them.7 But now there is a question: How can one arrive at this perfection? Is it so very difficult that it is unattainable by man? And how long does it take to attain that perfection? That is another question that arises in the heart of the intellectual man. But this question may be answered by saying, 'How does one want to proceed if one makes a journey from here to Moscow? ' If one wants to walk there is a different time; if one wants to motor there is a different time; if one wants to go by train, or by *aeroplane, the time is dif- ferent again. Nevertheless the desire to attain perfection is the deepest desire of every soul, and it is through not knowing this mystery that one feels that8 'I am unhappy because I have not got this or that position, power, wealth, a friend.' Man at once finds some answer for that longing, because he does not know for what he longs. But after you have given a person what he desires, you will find that he is not happy, he wants some- thing else; because it is true he does not know his need. It is just like a child. Give a child a toy, he is pleased for a moment and after a moment he throws it away and wants something else; he does not know what he wants. And how is this perfection to be attained? It can be learned by seeing how the earthly perfection is to be attained. If a person becomes very wealthy, what sacrifice he makes1 He has forgotten himself, he has not cared for himself; 9he attains to name or fame or position or wealth. Verily it is self-sacrifice from beginning to end, either for material gain or for that gain which is the seeking of every soul. But what does this sacrifice mean? Does this mean that man should live a certain kind of life, a life of poverty and seclusion? One may be living a life of poverty, a life of seclusion, and yet he may be holding himself so fast in hand that he may be far from perfection. It is rising above the false conception of one's own being and what may be called the false ego. It is that musician who has learned music who has forgotten his name. It is that poet who has written the true poetry, a living poem, who has lost himself. In the same realm you will see the way to perfection, the highest perfection, of which Christ has promised in the Bible, 'Be ye perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect.' lo 7.

L The fbwer of the Word. 3~ Lecture given by lnayat Khan, Rome, November 13, 1923.~ The word is in itself a profound mystery in every sense, and every scripture has considered the mystery of the word as the most profound mys- tery4 compared to all other secrets of life. ln5 the scripture that6 is most known to the Western world we read that first was the word and the word was Cod, and then again one reads that it was the word which was first and then came light. These two sentences7 convey to us two things. The first conveys 8to us8 that if gthere existed anything9, loand if we can express what existedlO, we can only express it by the name 'word\" And when we come to the second sentence1 l it explains another phase of the mystery, and that is that in order for the soul 2that was1 surrounded by the darkness of this world of illusion to come to the light, the word was first necessary; which means that the original spirit was in the mystery of the word and by the mystery of the word the mystery of the spirit was to be found. And Notes: After February, 1927, this lecture became Social Gatheka no. 43, and it was first published in a French translation in the magazine SouflSme of Sep- tember, 1927, then in The Sufi Record of Jan.-Feb.-March, 1931.

For instance there is a phrase in the Sanskrit language which says, 'Nada Brahma:, which means, 'the mystery of creation was in Nada', which means, 'in the word'. In the Qur'an one reads in the15 Arabic word16 '~unfaukun'~~, that first was the exclamation 'Be', 'and it became.' The One Who said, 'Bew,--and it became--was not a mortal being; He was and is and will be all the life there is. And if that is so, then the word was not the mystery of the past, but the word is a continual and everlasting mystery. And at this time when man has engaged himself in the material phenomena and has progressed very far compared with the past in industry18 and commercial activities, 19at this time19 this one aspect of discovering the might which lies under the word is still unexplored. In the first place the mystic who knows the value of the word finds that word in himself first. For the secret of all knowledge that one acquires in the world, whether worldly knowledge or spiritual knowledge, is the knowledge of the. self. For instance, music is played outside, but where is it realised? It is realised within. A good word, or a bad word, is spoken out- side, but where is it realised? It is realised within. Then where is the reali- sation of this whole manifestation, all this creation that stands before us in all its aspects? Its realisation is within. And at the same time the error of man always continues; instead of finding it within he always wants to find it without. It is just like a man who wants to see the moon and looks for it on the ground. And if a man sought for thousands of years for the moon by looking on the earth, he will never see it. He will have to lift up his head and look at the sky. And so with the man who is in search of the mystery of life outside; he will never find it, for the mystery of life is to be found within. There is the source and goal, and it is there that, if he seeks, he will find. What is sound? ls20 soundz1 outside, or is it something within? The out- side sound also becomes audible because the sound within is continued, and the day when the sound within is closed, this22 body is not capable of hear- ing the outside sound. Man today, living in the life of externality, has become so accustomed to the outside life that he hardly thinks of sitting alone. When he is alone he engages himself with a newspaper or with something. Always working with the life which is outside, always23 occupied with the life outside, in this way man loses his attachment with the life 24which within; his life there- 13.

The mystery of vibrations does not concern only the material plane but it goes still further. If the human body is a lute, then every word man speaks, every word he hears, has an effect upon his body; it has 48not only an effect48 upon the body, but also upon the mind. For instance, if a person repeats, or hears himself called by the. name 'foolish', even if he was wise in time he will turn foolish. And it is true also that a man who is simple, call him wise and in time he will become wise. The effect of the name that man has, has a great deal to do with man's life, and very often one sees that the name 49that man has49, has an effect upon his50 life5' and his career; 52the reason is only that so often in the day he is called by that name5*. And is it not true that a man saying a humorous thing bursts out laughing, and a man saying a sad thing breaks into tears? If that is true, then every word that one speaks in one's everyday life, what effect 53it has53 upon oneself and upon one's surroundings! And the superstition that has existed in all times about not saying an unlucky word, an undesirable word, one can see that that superstition has a meaning. In the East there has always been a training given to a child that he must think before he utters a word, for it has a psychological meaning and effect. Very often people reading a poem or singing a song with a54 great love, a song of sorrow or tragedy, are affected by it, and very often their life takes a turn, and is affected by it. Besides a person who speaks of his illness55 nourishes his illness 56by his speaking56. Very often I have heard people say that if there exists a pain,.it is a reality, 'and how can one deny it? ' It is so amusing to hear them say this, because reality is so far away, and our everyday life is such that from morning to evening we do nothing but deny it. If one only knew where lies the truth, if one only knew what is the truth, if57 only were to know it and see it, one would think that all else is non-existent in reality. And if one st~die8~ the depth59 of this idea then one must admit the power of the word. But then it is a science, a metaphysics that must be studied.

And besides this, sometimes a person full of sadness, heartbroken, 61 from there61 a voice comes, a word comes, which is full of sincerity, and it has all the power to penetrate, 62it has62 such an effect62 upon the listener! Then there is another person, who is lighthearted, who is not deep, 63not serious enough in life, everything he says and does is always on the surface, 64no one he inspires64 with confidence, for he himself has no confidence. But besides that there is a power of the word according to the illumi- nation of the soul, because then that word does not come from the human mind, that word comes from the depth, from behind, that word comes from some mysterious part that is hidden from the human mind. And it65 in con- nection with such words that one reads in the scriptures of words such as 'sw0rds6~ of flamem, or 'tongues of flames. Whether it is67 a poet, or whether it were a prophet, when that word came from the burning heart, then the word rose as a flame. In accordance with the divine spirit which is in the word, 68in accordance to it68, that word has 69power, life69 and in- spiration. Think of the living words of ancient times, think of the living words that one reads in the scriptures, the living words of the holy ones, of the illuminated ones! They live, and will live forever. It is as70 a music which may be called a magic, a magic for all times. Whenever such words are repeated they have that magic, that power. 71~he sages of all ages, what they have said,71 their72 words have been kept by the people, by their pupils.

And therefore wherever one goes in the East one finds the followers of different religions whenever they pray have the words of the illuminated ones, and they do not need to put them in their own language. And one finds in this way that the words said by the great ones have been preserved for ages 76to be used76 for meditation. Besides this there is a still more scientific and a greater mystery of the word. It is not only what the word means, it is not only who has said the word, but the word in itself has also a dynamic power. The mystics and77 sages and seekers of all ages, knowing the mystery of the sacred word, have been always in its pursuit. The whole meditative life of the Sufis is built upon the mystery of the word. For the word 'Sufi', according to the expla- nation of. the initiates, is78 from 'Sophia', which means 'wisdom'. But wisdom, not in the outer sense .of the word, because worldly cleverness cannot be wisdom. The intellect, which 79very often man79 confuses with wisdom, is only an illusion of wisdom. Wisdom is that which is learned from within, and intellect is that which is acquired from without. The source of wisdom is above, the source of intellect is below. And therefore it is not the same method, it is not the same process whichB0 one adopts in order to8' acquire intellect. And82, in short, the attainment of that wisdom is made in various ways by various people, but at the same time the great mystery of attaining the divine wisdom is in the mystery of the word. 75.

After a great enquiry made regarding the depths of life one finds that the only seeking of all souls is the knowing of the meaning of life. The sci- entist looks for it in his search in the realm of science, and the artist finds it in his art. People in all the different interests, whatever they are inter- ested in, their only inclination behind it is to find the meaning of life. And this shows that it is the nature of the soul, that the soul has come here for this purpose, that it may realise, that it may understand the meaning of life. Therefore either through the material way or through a spiritual way, every soul in his particular way is striving for that seeking which is its longing all the time. And this one can see even in the life of an infant. The desire of an infant to look at a thing, to tear it to pieces and see what is in it, shows that it is the soul's desire to look into life, to understand life. No doubt the effect and the influence of the life on earth is intoxicat- ing and man through this intoxication becomes so absorbed in himself and his own interest that he, so to speak, loses the way, the way which was inborn in man. And it is not to be found only in man, but even in the lower creation one finds the same attitude. In the animals, in the bird, the deepest desire is not looking for the food or seeking for a comfortable nest, the deepest ten- dency is to understand the nature of life, which then culminates in man. One sees in the life of the youth the continual asking of questions to the parents, 'What does this mean?\" 'What does that mean?', that continual longing to know the meaning of life, that continues all through life. And what does it teach us? This teaches us of that principle that the Source and Coal of the universe being one and the same, that the Creator created all this in order to koow His own creation nature. But how does the Creator see and understand His creation? Not only in its highest and deepest aspect but also through every thing and every being He is continually know- ing and understanding His creation. For instance if a person were to tell me, 'What is art? Is it not made by man?' I would answer, 'Yes; made by Cod also, through man.' And if that is the case, then what is this whole mecha- nism of the universe doing? It is working. Working for what purpose? Work- ing for understanding it. And what is this mechanism of the world, is it living Notes: 1. A blank in Gd.hwr."},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"or is it dead? All that we call living is living, and all that we call dead is living too. It is for our convenience that we say 'thing' and 'being'. In reality there are no things, thete they are all beings. Only it is a gradual wakening, a gradual wakening from that witnessing aspect to the recognising aspect. And no science, however material, will deny the truth of this, for the truth is to be realised from all things, from religion, from philosophy, from science, from art, from industry, it is to be realised from all things. Only the difference is that one takes a longer way and the other takes a shorter3 way; one goes round about and the other takes a straight way. There is no difference in the destination, the difference is on the way, whether one goes on foot or whether one drives, whether one is awake or whether one is asleep and is taken blindly to the destination not knowing the beauties of the way. If the destination4 may be divided into two parts it is only in this way, that one part is the mechanism that works the destiny and the other part is the soul that knows. Therefore the mechanism is the machine and the soul therein is the engineer who is there in order to work this mechanism and to produce from it what is to be produced. There are many methods, there are many systems, there are many ways men adopt in order to know and under- stand, and the mind is the vehicle, is the tool by the help of which, by taking this as a medium, man experiences life in the accomplishment of this pur- pose. And it is therefore that in the Sanskrit language the mind is called 'mana', and from the word 'mana' the English word 'man' is derived. And that means that man is mind, not his body. And as the soul has its tool, according to the readiness of its tool, it experiences and it knows life. It is the condition of mind which enables the soul to see life clearly. The mind is likened to the water, when water is troubled there is no reflection to be seen, when the water is clear then it shows the reflection. But the thing is this, that man in the pursuit of material gains through life, which he values the most, (as it is said in the Bible, 'Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also') in this way man has absorbed himself in the material life and has lost the benefit of life. At this moment when one gives the explanation of civilisation as commercial or industrial progress, when that becomes a civilisation, then that becomes the ideal of every soul; and it becomes diffi- cult for a soul to keep that tranquillity in order to accomplish that purpose for which the soul was born. Do I mean by this that industrial or commercial development is not necessary for the life of man? Not at all, as long as it does not ruin the purpose, as long as it does not hinder the life's purpose for which he was born. If not, in spite of all his progress, he has wasted his life, he has not attained the purpose for which he was born. There are superstitions in the East, also in the West, saying that the animals such as the horses, dogs, and cats, and the birds, give warning of a 2, Gd, crossed out Iflongerw and wrote lvshorterW instead 3.

Gd. afterwards crossed out Ifthew"},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"person's being ill, or of death, and many have perhaps found that there is some truth in these superstitions. If one were to ask and investigate the truth in this, where lies the truth in this, why does not man understand and perceive life as the animals do? The answer is that the animals live a more natural life, they are nearer to nature than man, who is taken up in the arti- ficial life. A thinker will not deny for one moment how many things one thinks and does and says that are far from what is true, from what is natural. The more one will be one with nature and one with the deeper life, the more one will realise that it is a continual agitation against reality that man does. I do not mean in doing wrong or evil, but even in doing good. If the animals can know, man is more capable of knowing and it is knowledge alone which is the satisfaction of his life, not all external things, as there is the word of the Bible, 'The spirit quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.' A man with all his wealth, what is his wealth? It is in his knowledge. If it is only in the bank and not in his knowledge he has not got that wealth, it is the property of the bank. All good things and great things, values and titles, position and possession, where are they? Outside? No, outside is only that which that knowledge which one has within, and therefore the real possession is not without but within. Therefore it is the self within, it is the heart which must be developed, it is the heart which must be in its natural rhythm and in its proper pitch. When it is tuned to its natural rhythm and pitch, then it can accomplish the purpose for which it is made. There are five different ways by which the knowledge of life is per- ceived. One way which is known to many of us, to woman perhaps more than to man, and that is the impression. Very often a person comes in the house or one meets a person, before one has spoken to that person one gets a kind of impression, a pleasant impression or an unpleasant impression, a certain knowledge of that person's being. Sometimes at the sight of that person one feels, 'Keep away'; sometimes at the first glance one feels drawn to that Person, [ [ I] The mind does not know, but the soul knows it. It is not only that one gets the impression of a person whom one meets, but even if a person is more sensitive to impression, he can also feel the impres- sion of a letter that comes to him from a stranger. And there are many who say that they know the character, or physiognomy, or phrenology, but if they have not the sense of impression in their heart, if a thousand books of physiognomy or phrenology %hey ready they will never get the impression in their heart. And what does it show? It show that the true knowledge, from beginning to end, does not belong to the material realm. And that there is another way, that is the intuitive way, by which one knows before one does something whether there will be a success or whether there will be a failure. There are some more intuitive people who 6. A blank In Gd. hwr. 7.

Gd. substituted \"thent1 for mthatt8"},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"feel before doing anything, before undertaking anything, and it is not rare, it is very often to be found, that people before doing anything know what will be the result. But then there is the third way, and that is the dream or the vision. Some will say that the dream has a meaning, and there are many who will say that there is no meaning in the dream. But in point of fact there is nothing in this world which has no meaning, there is no situation, no action, no [[ I] lo that has not its meaning. All that one does with intention and all that is done without intention, all that has a meaning behind it, if one only can understand it. And there is a reason why one should see more clearly in the dream than in the wakeful state, because when a person is in a dream his mind is naturally concentrated. For when man is in his wakeful state all that is perceived through his senses calls his attention at every moment. But no doubt one thing one finds, that the impression or intuition or a true dream is not manifested to every soul and it is manifested to one soul more than to another, and also one finds that it is not everyone who always [[ ] ] l2 lives in the rhythm and tune l3 of receiving impressions and intuitions. No, at different times his impression differs and it shows that in accordance to one's evolution he is able to experience the knowledge of life. The more evolved spiritually, naturally the more he receives from within the knowledge of life. And the fourth form in which one perceives the knowledge of life is what may be called inspiration. It may come to an artist, it may come to a musician, it may come to a poet. At the time when it has come he can write or compose or do something that afterwards he will be surprised that did he really do it, or did someone else do it? If it were not for that inspiration that same poet might strive for six months and would not be able to write that verse which he wrote in three minutes' time. And what is the explana- tion of it? Is it the development of man's mind by which he receives inspira- tion? No, it is the receiving quality of mind, it is the purity of mind, it is the absorption in the art, the l4 in which he has devoted his life. The great souls whose inspirational works have become immortal, where have they got them? They have got them from inspiration. And how did they get it? They have got it by forgetting themselves, by being absorbed in the object of their love. That is the meaning of sacrifice, sacrificing to the beauty of the ideal. One has the ideal to stand before one, that is the way to get it. And then one step further there comes the realisation which may be called a revelation. When the soul is tuned to that state then the ears of the heart are open, the eyes of the heart are open to see and hear the word that comes from all sides. In point of fact every atom of this world15 10. Afterwards Gd. fllled In ffwordff and crossed out the brackets 11. Gd. changed mwakefuln to flwaklngw 12.

It is for this that every soul has been created and it is in the fulfilment of this that man fulfils the object of God. When that spark that every heart has, that spark that may be called the divine spark in man, when it is blown and when the flame arises the whole life becomes illuminated and he hears and he sees and he knows and he understands.

Rome, November 17th, 1923 The Maturity of the Soul. The maturity of the soul may be pictured in the same way as that a little girl coming towards her youth, does not give that importance and that attention to her dolls. Her sentiment, her desire is changed from that idea. It does not mean that she did not have love before; she had it. It does not mean that she did not have sentiment before; she had it. But here, with the maturity, a consciousness has developed. The development of that con- sciousness has made all the toys and dolls, and all different things she' used to p+ay-6th pay such attention to, 2not to2 matter. Is this maturity de- pendent upon a certain age? No. Does it depend upon certain environments? Yes. It is just as3 a fruit put in the warmth ripens, so environments help the maturity of the soul. Nevertheless the ripening of the fruit on the tree is ideal, for that is the place for the fruit to ripen. And all different attempts made in order to make the soul ripen, they all help, but they are like a fruit being put in some warmth, it is no longer on the tree. There are people, who think that by renouncing the world they4 will arrive at the maturity of the soul. There are others who think that by suffering all kinds of torture, by inflicting torments and suffering on5 one- self one will arrive at the maturity of the soul. Often to me friends 6have come6 and asked me, if they would have some kind of suffering, some kind Notes: At a later date (after February 1927) this lecture became Social Gatheka no. 46.

If one wants to torture oneself for the sake of tor- ture, one may do so, but not for spiritual perfection. As the ripening of the fruit is in the course of nature, so it is in the course of nature that the soul should mature, and there is no use in being disappointed, being disheartened, about oneself andg those dear and near to us, worrying over the question,10 'why my husband' . . . 11 'my wife' . . .l 'my father' . . .l 'my mother does not look at life12 in the13 way14 I doll5 I am worrying about it.' In the first place no man, however great or pious, has the right to judge another soul. Who knows behind what action, what appearance, what speech, what manner, what is hidden. No-one knows it. And when a person begins to know what is hidden behind the human soul, he, in spite of all deluding appearances, will have a respect, a respect for mankind, thinking that in the depth of man's16 soul there is He Whom one worships. There is a story told in the East, that a wife was very much troubled, thinking that her husband was not religious enough, and the reason was that besides all the17 goodness that the man had shown l8 she had never heard him say the Name of the Deity. She continually prayed and prayed for a long, long time, and after many years it happened that she heard her hus- band utter the Name of the Deity, while asleep, when changing sides. The simple wife, she was full of joy. In the morning, as the husband awoke, she began to prepare all sorts of ceremonies and everything in the house, cele- brating that day, that the day of her desire had arrived. After the whole celebration the husband asked, \"My good wife, will you tell me what it is all about?' But she said, 'It is too sacred and secret 19to be saidlg.' He said, 'No, you must tell me.' She said, ' l have been in a kind of illusion and now I was disillusioned. For I was most unhappy knowing you, my husband, to be a good man, and yet as20 thought godless. But last night I happened to hear you utter the Name of the Deity while changing sides, and this has made me most happy.' 'Did I?' said the husband. 'Ah!' And he was finished.

No-one knows it. And many true souls one will find whose heart is in a kind of shell, a hard shell, closed. No-one knows that the very Essence of Cod is in their heart. The outer shell of the heart is so hard that no-one can under- stand it. Therefore a Sufi from Persia says, ' I went among the pious and the godly, and was so often deceived; and I went among those looked down upon by others, and I found among them real souls.' It is easy to blame, it is easy to look down upon someone, but it is difficult to really know how deep is the soul of a person. No doubt there are signs of maturity, but who knows22, and how to know them? The signs of maturity are such as23 is the subtlety between24 youthful lovers. When the soul is matured a passion has wakened in it, a pas- sion for what? A passion for that incomprehensible, for that which is the longing of every soul. And what is that passion like? That passion is like Culliver's travel. The life on the earth is just like 25~ulliver's travelling25. All souls, all persons, that all seems26 to be of a different world, that all seems26 to be of a different size, that all seems26 to be different from what 27it claims27 to be. Before one28 there are many little children, before him there are numberless little children, before him there appear many drunken people, drunken souls. There is a saying of the that there will appear in the Hereafter, on the Day of Judgement, a being in the form of a witch, and man will be frightened at the sight of this witch, and will cry out, '0 Lord, what a hqrrible sight is this! And-what Who is this?' and he will receive the answer from the angels,10 'This is the same world, the world which all your life attracted you, wtmm which30 you have worshipped, which30 you have adored and have esteemed most valuable and all that you desired. This is the same world that is before you.' All things of people's desire3 ', whether32 wealth, rank, possession, position or honour, whether32 33fame or33 pleasure, all these fade away when the maturity of the soul comes. All claims of love, 'I am your brother', or 'your sister', or 'your son', or 'your daughter', all these claims mean very little to the mature soul. A mature soul does not need to wait for the Day in the Hereafter in the form of a witch. He sees it now. No sooner has the soul matured than he sees the unreality of the world, which man has always considered real, and Hq.t.: \"for itf' omitted Gd.hwr.: \"themf* added Hq.t.: ffthereIf added I bid.: ffthe\" added Ibld.: Ifwhat Gulliver travelledm instead of 'fGulliverls travellingff I bid.: \"seemff Ibld.: ffthey claim'f instead of **it claimsf* .

There are three aspects of the reac- tion that this realisation of life 42rmkes produces on42*43 a person. Thete +944 One reaction it 45produces in45 a person is'?6 that one says in answer to every claim of love and attention and respect, 'Oh, no, no. I don't believe you, I have had enough.

Either he goes to the 52caves of the or to the forest. 53~e lives the life of an ascetic, at war with the world, at peace with God. There is another aspect of the reaction.

And the more he goes on in this path, the more he develops love. He mourns over the unreality, over the fal- sity57 of life, but at the same time he is there, he is in the midst of it. his work is58 to help those who may be disappointed at the result of every little expectation they had in their love and devotion, as for every soul every disappointment, every heartbreak is a surprise, is a shock, some- thing suddenly 59come before him59, and for 60this mad0 it is continua^+^^^ 38, it is not new, it is the nature of life.

If he happens to be in a business, in an65 industry, in seme a worldly affair, although he has not id6 view any monetary affair, any profit, it, yet64 at the same time, in order to keepz4 harmony, he stands with them. He will sacrifice his life in this way, and he enjoys doing all things and caring nothing for it. There is a manner of this, it is the68 manner of 69an actor69, an actor who acts on the stage. If he is made a king he is not very proud of his kingship, if he is made a servant he is not impressed by that, for he knows and understands, in his robe of a king or a servant, 'Neither am I a king nor am I a servant. I am myself.' And it is such souls really who come to save the world. They are as the elder brothers of humanity, who help the younger brothers. Te onT0 them there is no impression of that position, that title, that spiritual grade.

And this is a continual struggle for the seeker after for the Truth. Imagine, the industrial and business and domestic life apart, even in77 things that might seem to be covering the Truth, even in such things the seeker may be deluded. For there is a very important thing that the seeker has to consider. As Christ has said, 'I am the Truth, and I am the way.' That shows that there are two things; there is the Truth and there is the way. The way may lead a person, and the way may become a puzzle for a person. Hew It shows78 how careful he one has to be, for79 even through the way that seems to lead to the Truth, even in that way he may be puzzled. For in reality life is a puzzle, a continual puzzle, and soman seems to'have the love of a puzzle80, and therefore he goes in this puzzle, andB1 even a seeker after Truth, as he has ita2 in his nature to go into the puzzle first. For instance, if a man of Truth calls the seeker who has the love of the puzzle, and tells him, 'Here is the Truth', 'Oh', he says, 'this is something unheard of. Truth at the first step1 How is it possible? It must be 9errseth a thousand years before I can arrive at it. One life is not sufficient, tt-m9t Lse-a-tbea9and-+tve9-befere-+-ean-arti.ve-atit a thousand lives I must live 83before I cana3 realize the Truth.' But verily, the lover of the puzzle, for him even a thousand lives are not 9aff+e+ent enough. Besides, every man is not ready to accept the bare Truth, he is not accustomed to it. On hearing the Truth he says, :It is too simple. I want something which I cannot under- stand.' In point of fact, if it is too simple, certainly it is simple; it is man who makes it difficult for himself. Because all other aspects of knowledge one has to get from outside, the Truth is something which is within man him- self. It is something which is nearest to us we imagine to be farthest from us. It is something which is within we imagine to be without. It is something which is knowledge itself, we want to acquire it. The seeker, therefore, has a continual struggle, struggle with himself, struggle with others and struggle with life. And always the end and the result is that the one who has jour- neyed finds in the end,1° 'I have journeyed because it was my destiny to journey; but in the end I found out that it was the starting point which was my final goal.' 73.

Sunday afternoon. Beloved ones of God, my friends and mureeds, Words are too inadequate to express the joy and happiness which I feel to find myself again with my friends in Paris. And it is a great pleasure and surprise together to have met with my friends in these new quarters, which are offered by the devotees of the Cause. True it is and it gives me a great joy 'to think, as our great and sincere worker Merne L. has said, that all the devotees of the great Cause have contributed to it in thought, in feeling, in prayer, in every form they could, in order to make this be realized. I cannot forget a friend whose thought is just now with me, our faithful friend Colo- nel Guillon, who is not here today, but I feel his spirit with us. But I am most delighted to find with us today Meme Baronne d'Eichtal, who has been our backbone for the blessed work in Paris; and the devotional work most beautifully carried, quietly and modestly by Rev. Cheraga Meme Detraux, has always brought exaltation in our group. And I do not need to say in words, as you all know and you have seen, the most valuable efforts that from the beginning of the work in France M. L. has been doing and to whose most earnest efforts we credit this joy of today. You all know as well as I the present condition of the world and the need of a work of uniting the divided sections of humanity together. Our Movement is not a new religion; it has no desire to form a sect or communi- ty. On the contrary, our efforts are to invite the followers of different com- munities and different religions to come and meet on one single platform where everyone professes respect for all religions. Do we therefore call humanity to leave their own community or par- ticular way of worship? No, only what is studied in the Sufi Order, it is the essence of all religions, which brings man to the realization that there is one religion; there cannot be two religions. At this present condition when humanity is divided into many sections, one section opposing the other, at this moment it is most necessary that a Movement such as this, the impulse of which is directed by God, may work and work to its utmost to serve the divine Cause. No doubt efforts are being made by many different institutions, many different Movements, in order to bring about brotherhood, a better condi- tion, and we are perfectly in sympathy with any Movement of the kind."},{"pageNumber":872,"pageContent":"Every effort made in the direction of unity in bringing this harmony and peace which is the Ibnging of every soul, is worthwhile and is worth being appreciated. There are efforts made through educational channels, there are efforts made through social and economic efforts. But it must be remembered that there is a certain work which religion can perform, which spiritual activity1 can perform, and that is the work to which our Movement is destined. And what is mostly needed in the world today is the spiritualising of the world, and it is towards this end that the work of the Sufi Movement is directed, No doubt, as in every work, there are difficulties. So there is no end of difficulties that we have to go through. And if we had no belief in that saying that there is no difficulty that cannot be surmounted, we would have given up such efforts long ago. But through all these difficulties I must admit that there has always been a divine blessing in one form, a tangible form, and that form is: faithful friends, sincere workers, under all condi- tions, with all difficulties they have gone through, and they have proved the tests that very often came to try them, and they have proved in the end sin- cere. If we have any treasure just now, counting upon the treasure we have undertaken, the service of God and humanity, that tangible form in only these sincere hearts faithful. The phenomena3 of this is seen in this accomplishment and if there is any power behind, it is the power of God, our conviction of the power of the Almighty God, Whose responsibility it is, Whose service it is, to Whom we have all given our lives. Let us therefore lift our heart in prayers before Him Whose service we have undertaken to perform and pray that His blessing may remain, and maintain this place of the work which we have arranged for His service.

Paris, November 27th, 1923. Rue du Dragon 26. Tuesday evening class Man. Man is likened to the light; his soul the glow, his mind the flame, and his body the end of the flame. The heat that comes out of the light is the atmosphere of man, and the smoke that rises out of the light, it in reality does not belong to the light. It belongs to the fuel. As ignorance of man is troublesome, so the smoke rising out of the light disturbs. As different lights differ in the1 degree of radiance, so different souls differ in the degree of radiance. However, the element in every man is the same, and that is light. We read in the ancient Scriptures that the angels were made of fire. It is not fire, it is light. But when we ask to2 ourselves the question that3, 'Were the angels made of light, and no one else?', the answer will be that all, each and every one, were created of the light. The difference between our soul and body, which sometimes we consider as great as4 the earth and the5 Heaven, is not so different6. It is one light; and therefore the external7 of the5 man is expressive of his inner being, and the inner being of man is also dependent in many ways of8 his external being. But inner and outer part of one's being is for our convenience. In reality there is one being, there is one light. If man lacks magnetism, 9if man lacksg enthusiasm, 9if man lacksg courage, 9if man lacksg power of accomplishment, it is all owing to the lack of thatlo radiance which belongs to his being. The health of the body, the balance of mind, the purity of the soul, these1 l all depend1* upon the radi- ance of his being. Therefore the health of the body is spiritual, the balance of mind is spiritual, and so is the purity of the soul. All these are the signs Notes: After 1927, this lecture became Gatheka no. 30, which exists as a Headquar- ters' typescript (hq.t.1 and stencil (hq.st.), identical in wording.

The power in14 the word 13is a sign of spirituality13. he^ courage without fear 13is the sign of spirituality 13, fearlessness, self-confidence 15is also the sign l5 of spirituality. The capability of accomplishing something, also the strength to struggle through life, all these are the signs of spirituality. The purpose of the life of an individual is to perfect the light which is in himself, which is his very being. Whatever may be the qualification of the person, whatever be his source16, position17 and rank, if the light within himself is not bril- liant, he cannot fulfil the purpose of his life. In the Bible there is a story which explains somewhat the same idea, in the analogy l8 of the ten wise virgins andlg ten foolish virgins: the foolish ones who did not keep the oil in the lamps and the ten who kept it. The ten wise ones therefore answered the purpose on the day which was promised, the ten foolish ones repented. Now ten means one, zero means nothing: one wise soul and one foolish soul. The wise soul collected all the material in order to make thisz0 light more brilliant for that day, the day which was the day of romise. And the foolish soul wasted it, and found it absent at the time wheng1 needed. NOW^^ when we come to our life in the world, in our material strife, in our spiritual struggle, whatz3 we need? We need that light, the spark of which is within us, is our being. Every time when we are without it, when we lack it, it causes us failure and all distress of life, since our health, our balance, and the clearness of vision all depend upon the light that is within. As every light needs aZ4 fuel, so the light which is ours, ourself, that needs fuel also. For the hysical part of our life, what we call food is the fuel, but for the lifeZ5 of '?mind, intellectual sustenance is necessary. If the body is fed and the mind is not fed, then naturally that26 light becomes less. Then the sustenance of the soul is divine ideal, divine ideal which is love and light both. if the soul does not receive that nourishment which is necessary for it, then the soul is starved. The body may be nourished, but that is not suffi- cient for it. Therefore, before our physical eyes we see many famine- struckz7 souls, but if we saw with the spiritual eyes, we should see still more famine in humanity.

We learn in Sufism that mysticism which teaches us how to collect that fuel which is necessary, not only for the body, but for our mind and soul, by concentration, by meditation, by all other ways of contemplative practices. The purpose that is accomplished by the Sufi is that purpose which is the longing of every soul. Question: What are the means, except contemplation and medi- tation, to develop and strengthen in oneself that light? Answer: Right living. Question: What means a right way of living? Is it as everyone thinks right? Answer : If each person's way of right living would be, there would be anarchy. The right living I would consider which is right to oneself and to others. If not, all those who do good or who do wrong, they all justify themselves by thinking that what they do is the best. And reason is the slave of man; it always comes to sympathize with him: 'Have I not done right, or wrong?' The reason says: 'Yes, you have.' Question: How can one live so that it is approved of by oth- ers? Answer: It is impossible to live the life that one considers best and others consider best. But one can do one's best. Question: Is it an ideal which one cannot reach, but one can have? Answer: Yes, it would be a help to do right. But one can always try to live that ideal. But no man on earth can live that ideal. But ideal is always that which cannot be lived. Question: One cannot reach, yet one sees people in whom the divine spark of light is more or less extinguish- ed, still they live an apparent virtuous life."},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"Answer : An apparent virtuous life is a different thing. Apparent is apparent. Right living, in my meaning, is not only a virtuous living. Right living has a deeper meaning still. Because what I call right life is the first step to that which may be called true life. The third step is truth itself. Therefore the mystics say: there are three steps to the goal: right, true and truth. A person who loves to live a right life, and who tries to do it, even if he was not a contemplative or meditative or religious person, he must certainly arrive to that high stage, to,that goal which is the ideal goal. Because within man there is truth; and seeking of man is truth. Therefore right living helps him to realize the truth. But if I were to interpret the words of Christ which say: 'Strait is the gate, and narrow is the wayw28, I would say that there is a path in life, a path of going straight, and that path is walking upon a wire in the circus. They make a show of this. That is exactly the picture, that at every step you take there is a fear of falling, either this side or that side. But even a better picture is made by the jugglers in India in the same way. They take two very high bamboos, and tie a rope on the top of the bamboos, and the man stands is a brass tray, and that brass tray is on the rope. His task is to go from one point to the other point, and while he is travelling thus his colleagues from below beat drums, and sing horrible songs, in order to distract his mind, and he has to keep his concentration and secure balance in spite of all the musical calling that he hears from below. That is the picture of right living. Question: Yes, but once one is falling29 Answer: Truth is merciful. One cannot fall but on the truth. If he falls, he will only fall in the arms of the truth. A seeker after truth has no loss. If he apparently loses anything, in the end it is not a loss. Question: What is it to fall in the arms of truth? Answer: Every struggle, if a fall is caused in a certain struggle, one has fallen in the arms of that particular struggle. If in the struggle of love, then he is in the arms of love that he falls. If in the struggle of righteousness he falls, he falls in the arms of righteousness. Just like they have said that the holy war means that a person gives his life for a holy purpose. And therefore 28. Quotation is from Matt. vii.14, A.V. 29. Sk.sh.: it is not clear that the question ends here"},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"he is in the arms of that holy object. In the struggle of truth, if a person has fallen, he has fallen in the arms of truth. Besides, the hopeful has never fallen. His rise and fall both mean success. Failure is the loss of hope. As long as there is hope there is no failure. Question: And those who do not hope any 1 onger? Answer: There the success is finished. Question: Is there notki which can help them? Answer : A miracle can do something. Nothing is impossible. There is nothing more painful than the loss of hope. A hopeless person is a dead person. A person who is dead, with hope is living; but a person walking on earth without hope is as dead. Question: How can one revivify a soul? Answer: Impart one's life into him, as a lighted candle can light another candle which is put out. When the fire is gone out in the stove one must bring some other fire to light it again. One has to give from one's own hope. Therefore the one who gives must be powerful enough to give it. Question: When can a person consider himself sufficiently powerful to give? Answer: One can judge it from one's own self-confidence. Because that life which one gives from one's own life to another, that comes from the self-confidence. In the Sufi terms it is called Iman, which is the most sacred thing in the whole religion. Self-confidence is the secret of all miracle. Question: Is love for one's neighbor not the 30force31 to he1 p? 30 Answer: Love is the substance. By self-confidence you make that sub- stance, by the power of self-confidence you are able to impart it. For instance, in healing. If you saw a person, and saw 30.

Sk.sh.: \"forcen difficult to make out In the sh."},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"that32 this'person is very ill; and you felt: what can I do, how can 1 do it? Then you can do nothing. In healing it is all self- confidence, in healing the self, and in healing another, it is all self-confidence. But not only healing, but all things, business, industry, in all work self-confidence is necessary. Question: How can self-confidence, 330neself, in one's own af- fairs, help another person? Answer: Self-confidence gives you the power to manage your affairs better, and help others also. Now suppose there is a doctor who came to see a patient, who was in a bad condition. He says, 'Oh, it is too late that you have called me. Now this person has gone very far: Still I shall write a prescription now that you have called me here.' There is another doctor, he says: 'It is never too late, I am sure that all will be well. I shall do my very best, and certainly he will recover.' He may give the same prescription as the first doctor, but his prescrip- tion will be of a much greater value. Why? Because besides the medicine he has given his self-confidence, which is a mil- lion times greater in healing than prescriptions. In all things it is the same. A person may be starting a business enterprise; a man may come and take away all his strength by saying: 'What a fool you are to have begun this. Have you thought of this?' Then all the power and radiance the man has can be lost in a moment's time. There is another person34: 'It is a noble un- dertaking, I am sure you will succeed; therefore my prayer, my thoughts35 with you, we shall do all we can to36 your enter- prise. We wish you success.' Question: To be quite sure to be able to give to another, one must have a great deal of vitality oneself? Answer: Vitality also comes from self-confidence. But again I shall tell you. For instance very often you will see a person not with an extraordinary strength and vitality has sometimes a much greater strength than a ando ow^^. Independence is the sign of self-confidence.

A person with limited means after the generosity of one day, 38 next day he will be broke . Question: What can one do to help people who suffer from psychic forces? Answer: They are more difficult to help, because they become moody, they have moods. In one mood they will say yes, and in the evening they will say no to the same thing. Just now a person will think that now he is your friend; next day he will doubt, that is is his mistake. Such person once will listen to you, another time will refuse. That person may be a very good person, but at the same time changeable in moods. For such a person a kind of very great power is needed to tune that person gradually.

Paris, November 29th, 1923 1 The Sufi Ideal. The word Sufi, althoug# comes from the3 Creek origin which means wisdom, still there is another meaning which is from the Arabic meaning: Sufi means pure. Often one wonders what this purity means. Because as in our everyday language we have corrupted many words, and we give in- terpretations4 to such words, our own interpretation, and so many call good- ness purity, many call moral character a purity. But for a mystic purity is quite different; for a mystic purity has its natural meaning. Pure water means nothing mixed with it, no other element in it, and therefore purity is to find that substance within oneself which is pure. No sooner that sub- stance is realized, 5one finds all such things as good or bad, right or wrong, besides that purity. Since there is no such goodness which is not touched with what may be called evil nor there is evil which has no touch of good- ness, there is no such wrong which has no right side to it, and there is no right side which has not got the wrong of it. So as one realizes this purity, so one feels backward in expressing his opinion upon anything or anybody. You will always find that it is the foolish ones who are more ready to express their opinion upon a person; the wiser the person, the less inclined he feels to form an opinion on anyone. If he has to say anything it is only good of the person. Besides, no person who has once realized this purity, tries to force his belief or his opinion upon another. For the reason is that no sooner the purity which is within is realized, 5he has no longer an opinion which can be expressed in words. There are three steps to this purity. When a person takes the first step towards this purity, he distinguishes between right and wrong. When he takes the second step, he only sees the right, and overlooks the wrong.

One might say, a realization like this would upset the whole conception of right and wrong, and the standard made by the nations and by religion. Yes, it is true, but at the same time in order to keep in harmony with the world, with those one lives with, it does not mean that one should close one's eyes and not see the truth. It is therefore that the Sufi says that ' live as the others live, think as the others think, but feel as you feel8, and realize as your soul guides you to realize life.' There is one error which is the greatest sin, if ever sin exists, and it is that sin which is expressed in the story of Adam; and that sin begins from the time that the infant begins to come to child- hood. That is the exile from the Garden of Eden of that soul who experi- ences the kingship of infancy and began to feel 'Im, 'I am somethingg sep- arate from the others.' No sooner the soul begins to say 'I' he is exiled from heaven. For all blessing belongs to that state that the soul has experi- enced before having claimed to be '1', a separate entity. And every curse has come upon man from that time that he has realized himself to be an entity separate from the others. I it therefore that man whatever be his position, whatever be his situation in life, he is not fully happy. The trouble of one may be perhaps greater than of the other; but the one resident in the heaven-like palaces, and the other inhabitant, he lo had a grass hut, both have their troubles, both have their pain. But the reason of all the trouble man finds in the life outside of him. '~ufi finds the reason of all trouble in that one sin, having claimed 'I.' With this claim all the trouble came. It continued, and continues always. There is such a hold that this sin gets upon the soul, that it is like the eclipse upon the sun, covering its light from shin- ing. In the practical life one finds this claim and the spirit of 'I' sometimes helpful, and so l2 the practical man looks upon a person who has less of this element, he thinks that he is weak, he thinks that he is unpractical. If that person seems l3 more simple he calls him dreamy. A practical man in connec- tion with this man says he is floating in the air. But after all how long this practical sense lasts, and to what end 14it does l4 lead? The end of the one who was l5 practical and the inpractical l6 one is the same.

This young man asked: 'May I know what is the name of the place where you live?' 'The place of liars, it is near a Temple.' This young man was very confused; he thought: he was speaking of truth all the time and he lives in the place of liars. Only he found the place in the end by coming near that Temple. When this young man saw the Sufi, he says: 'The first question that rises in my mind is: why do you call this place the place of liars?' The Sufi said to the young man: 'Come along with me, we shall have a little walk in the little graveyard', which was just close to it. He said: 'Here they say that that prime minister was buried, and here the king was buried, and here the chief judge was buried, and here a very great general was buried. Were they not liars? They prove here to be liars. There are nothing but the same in the same ground; they are buried, with anyone else, the same end they had as anyone else.' If that is the end then think of the beginning. In the beginning there also was no such a thing as distinction. No infant is born in this world saying that 'I am so and so, my name is so and so, my position is such and such.' This all the soul has learnt after coming here. The soul has learnt the first lie in saying 'I' as a separate identity 19; and after that first lie he says numberless lies. Therefore the teaching and the occupation of the Sufi is to erase that error from the reeerd surface of his heart. And therefore the first lesson and the last lesson that the Sufi learns is 'I am not, Thou art.' And when this20 false claim does not exist in his conscious- ness, then that claim which is called in the Bible 'the Word', that 'First was the Word, and the Word was God', begins. And by listening to that divine Word and by giving oneself to that Word, it is by this that the Sufi experi- ences that joy, that heavenly joy, which is incomparable, that joy which is ecstasy. The belief in God leads to that perfection which is the seeking of the soul. But is is not only the belief; for there are numberless souls in this world who have belief in God. Do you think that they are very much advanced? Very often you find that those who claim a belief are much more backward than 21those who perhaps21 do not claim a belief in Cod. Belief in God must serve the purpose of that purification, that purity which is the ideal attainment for man. And it is that purity which is attained by the med- itation. And in that purity is fulfilled the purpose of life. 17. Ibld.: ttwhere\" instead of Itthat\" 18.' Sk.a.: \"rnayI1 instead of ltmlghtt1 19.

Answer: That is not a rule. The rule is that the one who succeeds through wrong will only succeed through wrong. By doing right he will have a failure. The one who succeeds by right will always succeed by right. If he will do wrong he will have a failure. Furthermore, the one who descends2! for him right and wrong all become as steps to descend23. And the one who descends, for him good or evil all become a step to descend. Yet it is a consoling thing because it takes one to the ideal that 24 there must be the ideal before one to ascend, and even his error will help. For instance, to25 a person who is to be cured, the medicine and no medicine, both help him towards the cure. And the one who is not meant to be cured, neither medicine nor its absence helps him. It teaches us to find out what we are seeking, what is our ideal, do we ascend, how do we descend2q Another picture of this, that if a person is climbing a staircase, if he is going up, if his foot slips, even he will go up, because he is bound to go up. And the one who is going down, if he slips he will go down, because he is bound to go down. There is no man in this world who can say: 'I am faultless.' But that means27 that he is not destined to reach that to which he is bound to reach. It is a great pity if a person does right or does good because he wants to progress or to become spiritual. For what is goodness after all1 It is a very small price to be paid for spirituality. And the man who de- pends upon his goodness to attain to spirituality, he may just as well wait a thousand years. For is is just like the picture of a man who is collecting all the sand he can in order to mount 28 a hill in order to mount to heaven. If one is not good for the love of goodness, if one does not right for his love for justice, for his own satisfaction, there is no meaning in doing right, there is no virtue in doing good.

I would like to speak this evening on the subject of the secret of 1ife.l Man's attitude is the secret of life. For upon man's attitude depends the2 success and failure. Man's rise and fall both have behind it3 his atti- tude. One may ask what do I mean by the word attitude? Attitude is that impulse which is as a battery behind the mechanism of thought. It is not man's thought which is man's attitude, it is something behind man's thought pushing it outwardlfl; and according to the strength of that impulse that that5 thought is6 becomes realized. he beginning of every work hasg the attitude aslo the most important factor in bringing l to its1 l suc- cessf ul accomplishment. Now there are three different sides connected to12 this subject, that one could observe. One side of it is one's attitude to oneself. Whether one treats oneself as a friend or as an enemy; if one is harmonious to12 oneself or inharmonious. And remember, it is not everyone who is harmonious to12 himself, and it is not everyone who treats himself as friend, although he13 may think so. For man generally is his own enemy; he does not know it, but he proves it in his doings. 140ne reads14 in the Qur'an, 15which sayst5: 'Verily, man is foolish and cruel.' Foolish because he does not even know his own interest, and cruel because he very often proves to be his own enemy. 16~0 be16 cruel to others apart, man begins his cruelty on himself. But that cruelty 17is the cause of17. foolishness. That foolishness is impru- dence. Imprudence means ignorance.

Someone asked Buddha: 'What is ignorance? What is it like? Quddha said: 'A person was clinging to a branch of a tree, his feet not touching the ground, all night l9 was hanging in the air, and was every moment afraid lest he might fall and hurt himself. Neither 20he knewz0 that there was a ground, nor 21he thoughtz1 that there was water. He was only afraid of his life, he only felt his own body. And in order to protect his body he was clinging to the tree all night. But with the breaking of the dawn he saw that he was but two feet'sz2 distance from the earth. He could have just let loose that hold he had upon that little branch, if only he hadz3 that trust, that faith, that the ground was just beneath his feet. And this is the igno- rance of man'. Man mayz4 consider himself very practical and very clever, but at the same time he very often proves to be his own enemy. As Saadi says, the great writer of Persia, 'My cleverness, very often thou provest to me25 my worst enemy.' Very often worldly cleverness without that faith and strength and trust is iiothing but a delusion. It is the development of the trust in the heart, the development of faith, that gives man a friendly atti- tude first to himself. But how must one become one's own friend first? By bringingz6 one's external 27 in 28 harmony to one's inner being. For it is when the inner being seeks something else, and the external being does something else, then 29 there is inharmony in oneself. 3%hen one's good self, 30 when one's higher self desires one way, and the lower self strikes another way, then there is inharmony. And what is the result of this inharmony? The result of that inharmony is like the3' volcanic eruption. The two parts of one's own being which should unite together in love strike together, and fire comes out of it. What causes people to 3~ake af2 suicide? What brings that illness and depression and despair? Very often that conflict which exists within oneself. Therefore the attitude towards oneself must be first friendly, must be first kindly and harmonious. Even in such thing 33 as spirituality one must not go against oneself.

When one thinks about one's dealings with one's friends, with one's rel- atives, with those with whom one comes into42 contact in one's everyday life, 4%ne attracts them or repels44 them according to one's attitude. Whether a person is in business, in commerce, 43n whatever walk of life, he either repels 44 or attracts them, and in 46 that depends his success or failure of 42 life. That secret of magnetism, whether you consider yourself friend or47 enemy, whether a stranger or a friend, and to the one who considers anyone else a stranger, to him even the friend is a stranger. And the one who considers one 48 a friend, to him even a stranger is a friend. If you are afraid of someone who will, you think, harm you, then you inspire that person to harm you. If you distrust someone, and think: one day that person will deceive you, certainly you will inspire that person to deceive you. But 49even in the enemy 49, if you have the trust 49, the power of your trust may someday turn him from your enemy in50 your friend. In everything one does, honesty and dishonesty is 51 reflected in the same way. If the attitude is not right, whatever work one does, whoever one sees, that wrong attitude is reflected upon that person, and that person will answer in the same way. Therefore right-doing and wrong-doing is 51 not only 52a teaching 52 of a re- ligion, some virtue which is forced upon the2 people; 5?t is53a scientific, a logical truth.

He said: 'It is not one day, but many times; I thought it may be an accident, but whenever that temptation has robbed that sacred power which is in me, then that day I was not successful in my business.' What does it show us? It shows us that there is hidden in our heart a wonderful power, a power which can be called divine power, a sacred power, a power which can be developed and cherished by keeping our attitude right. But then it is not always66 to keep the attitude right. 6?he influence of this life on the earth that one has, this life full of changes, full of temptations, full of falsehood, continu- ally upsets that steadiness of 68 attitude. Nevertheless, the2 strength still6' lies in the steadiness of the attitude. And any lack in that steadiness is the cause of every failure and disappointment. There is a Hindustani saying, that 70 ' 'steady attitude secures success.' And when we come in the spiri- tual region the same rule applies. It is not the prayer that man says, it is not the house where the man prays, it is not the faith that man claims, it is the72attitude that counts in religion. It is just like73a ticket is wanted74 at the gate door75 of the railway station. Yea They do not ask what position you have, what property you have, what ancestor^^^. No, they ask: 'Ticket', and you are admitted. That ticket is man's attitude. In order to enter in the spiritual spheres that right attitude is needed, and77 that short- ens the path.

To know the right attitude from7' wrong is as easy as seeing all things when the eyes are open. When one does not see the wrong attitude, it means that at 79 that time 8%e closess0 his eyes. His eyes do no fail him; he closes them. He does not want to admit to himself his wrong attitude, he is afraid of his own fault. But if one 82 looks at one'sa3 own error face to face, it is that man who criticizes himself, he has no time to criticize others. It is that man who will prove to be wise. But mostly human nature seems to be doing quite another thing. Everyone seems to be most interested in criticizing another. If one would criticize oneself, there are endless faults; however saintly or sagely, there is no end of faults in a soul. And it is only the2 con- sciou~ness~~ of 85 correcting one's faults, of making oneself better, of taking hold of that right attitude, which is the secret of success, by which one attains to that goal which is the object of every soul. Now adding to this subject what the Sufi Movement, especially the Sufi Order, has to teach in this direction. According to the Sufi point of view there is only one Teacher, and that Teacher is God Himself. No man can teach another man. Only what one can do to another is to give one's experi- ence to another to make 8%ne's success86. For instance, if a person happens to know a road, a way, he can tell another man: 'That is the road that leads to the place which you wish to find.' The work of the spiritual teacher is like the work of the Cupid. The work of the Cupid is to bring 87about thea7 two souls together; and so isa8 the work of the spiritual teachera8 to bring together Ged the soul and God. But what is taught to man who seeks after truth? Nothing is taught. What is taught is only how he should learn from God. For it is not man who teaches spirituality, it is God alone Who teaches it. And how is it learned? These ears which are open outwardly when from outward they are closed and when they are focussed to the heart within, then instead of hearing all that comes from the outward life whena9 begins to hear the words within. Therefore, in a few words, if one were to say what is meditation? That is also the attitude, the right attitude to God. Right attitude to God is a direct response to God. For the voice is continu- ally coming as an answer to every call. It is the ears of the heart which should be open and focussed to that source from where the voice is coming. And once that is done, then the Teacher within is found; and there is a Km,tp., Gd.rv.tp.: fttheln added Gd.rv.tp.: tlat't omitted I bid.: \"man has closed\" In place of Ithe c10ses~~ I bid.: \"If1' omitted I bid.: llwhott added Ibld.: \"histt instead of t80ne1sv I bid.: changed to ~tconscientlousness~~ Ibld.: Itin\" Instead of 'Iofw Ibld.: tthlm successfult1 instead of l'onels successft Ibid.: \"about thett deleted Ibld.: ttlsln moved to after ttteacherll Km.tp., Gd.rv.tp.: \"onet1 lnstead of ''when Gd.rv.tp.: wwithln88 moved to after ''foundtt"},{"pageNumber":890,"pageContent":"continual guidance, and theng1 only remains to what extent one keeps close to that guidance, to that extent one is guided. It is true that one needg2 no other guidance than the inner guidance. But 93if oneg2, in order to come nearer to the inner guidance, if there is any guidance to come to that 94 is necessary. The Sufi Order therefore is the way to that inner guidance. Once a person has come into contact with that inner guidance, then one can 95go along 95 through life. 96~ttitude builds a channel for an effort. A right attitude builds a channel for a right effort. The world is the3' place of tests and trials. If one does not live in the world one has no chance of doing 97 or bad 97, and if one lived a very spiritual life in the wilderness, it hasg8 no good for anybody, not even for oneself, because one has not gone through the testsg9 and trials of the world. Neither one can praise the life of a hermit, nor can one condemn keaase loo. If he is happy, it is good. Each knows his own life. When he is happy he will give happiness to others also. For instance, a man is born to live a hermit's life. In living a hermit's life he does not find any torture or trouble in it. Let him live that life; in that he will prove to be his own friend. In the second step he will be the friend of another. If my friends asked me: is the hermit's life ideal? I will say: It may be ideal for him, you need not follow it. 96 Question: Is it notlo' that the life of a hermit is selfish? Answer: It is very difficult, if we observe life, to say who is not selfish. But at the same time the life of a hermit is not a life which one should make all sacrifices Io3 in order to follow it. I vtould be the last person to recommend it to anyone. But if one followed it form his own pleasure and found happiness in it, I would not prevent it.

Answer: The attitude must be that first to seek Cod within. And after seeking Cod within, then to see God without. And the story of Aladdin, that we hear in the 'Arabian Nights', that Aladdin went to find some lantern. That lantern is the divine light within. And that fight+-feand-by lantern is very diffi- cult to find. And once a person has sought that lantern, the next thing to do is to throw that light on the life outward, in order to find God within and without, both. For instance, a prayer, a night vigil, a form of worship, all these things are helpful. But if man was not inclined to make peace with his brother, to make harmony with his fellow man, to seek the pleasure of those around him, then he has not performed the religious duties. For what can man give to Cod, Who is per- fect? His goodness? His goodness is very little. His prayers? How many times will he pray? The whole day he spends for himself. If two times, three times he prays, it is' nothing. If man can do lo4 in order to please Cod, it is only to please His creatures, to seek their pleasures. There cannot be a better prayer and a greater religion than being conscientious to the feeling of man, being ready to serve him, to please him in every way, to forgive him, to tolerate him. And in doing wrong, if the thought that he was doing wrong to Cod, and in doing right if he was thinking: I am doing right to God, his attitude is right. All mysticism and philosophy and meditation, and everything that we learn and develop, the end and the sum total of the whole thing is to be a better servant to humanity. The whole thing, from the beginning to the end in the spiritual path is a drilling, is a training to be better able to serve mankind. And if one does not do it with that intention, he will find in the end that he has accomplished nothing. There are many who seek wonder working, or great power to accomplish things. Yes, they may try to and gain perhaps this or that power. But the soul will never be satisfied. The true satisfaction of the soul is in an honest and humble service of Io5 another. If there were two people before me: one had a great power of wonder working, one could perform phenomena; and another, humble and kind and gentle and willing to do all he can for his fellow men, I would dwy9 prefer this last man.

Musee Guimet (Paris), Sunday, December 2nd, 1923 The Intoxication of Life. It is not only what one eats or drinks gives a certain amount of stimu- lance to him, but also what one smells, what one sees or hears, even that has an influence and effect on man's being. And stimulance that one experi- ences by the food and drink in the real sense of the word is a small intoxi- cation. But is is not only the food that one eats and the water that one drinks and all that one sees and hears and touches gives man intoxication, but even breathing the air that man breathes from morning to evening, it is continually giving to him a stimulance and an intoxication. And if this is true, then is there one moment when man is not intoxicated.? He is always intoxicated, only sometimes more than other times. But this is not only the intoxication. Then his absorption in his affairs of life, which keep him also intoxicated. Besides that second intoxication of the work and affair in which one's mind is absorbed, there is that third intoxication. And that third intoxication is that attachment that man has with himself, the sympathy that man has with himself. It is this intoxicatiori which makes him selfish, which makes him greedy and very often unjust towards his fellow men. The effect of this intoxication is that man continually is busy feeling, thinking and acting: what would be to my interest, what can bring me a certain interest and profit? And in that his whole time and life becomes fully . lt is through this intoxication that he says, h his^ my friend, and that is my enemy; he is my well-wisher, and he is against me,' and it is by this intoxi- cation that the ego, the false ego of man, is made. And it is this third intox- ication which keeps man continually in the thought of attaining that which is for the profit of himself. But as an intoxicated man does not really know what is profitable to him, so man, selfish, in his selfishness he never knows, he does not understand what really is to his benefit. And at the moments of soberness man wonders, 'If this is intoxication, what is in the reality? I would like to know what reality is.' But for the reality it is not only the eyes and ears that are necessary, but it is the soberness besides it which is needed to hear and see better. One might ask, 'HOW could we call this in- toxication if this seems to be a normal state and this seems to be the state of every person?' Yes, it may be called normal condition only because it is Notes: 1. Skosh,: Sk, later added lfinvolvedll in Ih. 2.

And then there is an innate longing for a certain satisfaction which man does not know, and for that satisfaction, man seeks 4for it4 and never 5 that satisfaction which is the continual longing of his soul. No active person with some wisdom will deny the fact that always every effort he makes for a happiness seems to bring out a disappointing result. And that shows that the effort is made always on the wrong direction. But'to make an effort to find reality is apart. The first thing is to realize what this in- toxication is. And the first step in the path of truth is to know that there exists such a thing as intoxication. The intoxication that the childhood has, if one can only imagine what attention, what service, what care the child demands. At the same time he does not know how6 take the trouble, who takes care of it. It plays with its toys, it plays with its playmates, it knows not what is awaiting it in the future. What it wants, what it is pleased with, is what is immediately around him. He does not see far7. No child has ever known in his childhood what value is his mother or his father or those who care for him, except when man arrives at that stage when he begins to see for himself. And when see8 the condition of youth, which is another in- toxication again, that time of blossoming, that time of the fullness of energy, the soul in that time of spring never thinks that there can by any- thing else. The soul never thinks that this is a passing stage. The soul only thinks that at that time it is full of intoxication. It knows not anything else but itself. How many errors, how many follies, many thoughtless things and many things of inconsideration a youth has done, which it afterwards re- pents, but the timeg it never thinks about it. It is not the fault of the souls10, it is the time, it is that intoxication. The person who is intoxicated, what he does he is not responsible for it; he is intoxicated. Neither child is to be blamed for his not being responsible or appreciative enough, nor the youth for being blind in its energy. It is natural. This intox- ication goes on as .a person goes on in life. Only it is the change of wine. The wine of childhood is different from the wine of youth, and when the wine of youth is passed, then some other wine is taken. Then according to the different walks of life that man goes along, so he drinks that wine which absorbs his life, either collecting of wealth or requiring power or looking Sk.sh.: Sk. tried to change something in the last syllables of this word; Sk.l.tp.: t8satlsfactoryt1 Sk.l.tp.: \"for it8* omitted Sk.sh., Sk.l.tp.: a blank Sk.sh.: Pir-o-Murshid lnayat Khan's pronunciation of 8thoww and 81who8t may have been quite similar, for there are several places where, as here, Sk. took down \"howm where \"whow would make more sense; Sk.l.tp.: Sk.sh.: Sk. later changed \"fart1 to I8farther\" Ibid.: Sk. later changed \"we seet8 to \"he seesw Sk.'s separate annotation (instructions to typist) reads: \"Km. tat the same time1 but it should be as in my sh.\"; Sk.l.tp.: Itat the same timew, changed by Sk. in Ih. to \"at that time\" Sk.l.tp.: t8soul\" Sk.sh.: a small blank"},{"pageNumber":895,"pageContent":"after a position.

It may be joy15 in music or fondness of poetry, it may be a love of art or a delight of learning, it is all intoxication. But now a person may ask, 'If all these different occupations and things of interest are like different wines, then16 what is there in the world what can be called a state of soberness?' It is wine, no doubt, from begin- ning to end. Even those who are good and advanced spiritually and morally, they also have a certain wine. Wine one has to take all along, but it is a dif- ferent wine. A highly advanced artist, a great poet, an inspired musician will admit that there are moments of intoxication which come to him as a joy, &ten1' as an upliftment from his art, music, poetry, and it makes him exalted; lahe is if he is not living in this world. The higher intoxication cannot be compared with the lower intoxication of this l1 world, but that is intoxication. What is joy, what is fear, what is anger, what is passion, what is the feeling of attachment and what is the feeling of detachment? All these have the feeling of wine, all ate- different have their intoxications. Understanding this mystery, the Sufis have made their culture founded upon this principle of intoxication. The in- toxication of which I have said, the Sufis call it hal, and ha1 means in its verbal meaning: condition, state. And there is a saying of the Sufis that man says and does according to his condition. One cannot say differently and cannot do differently than the wine one has had l1 . The one who has had the wine of anger, what he says or does, it is irritable, it is irritation. The one who has drunk the wine of de- tachment, in his thought, speech, action, you will find nothing but detach- ment. One who drinks the wine of attachment, you will feel in his presence that all are drawn to him and he is drawn to all. A person does and says all that he does and says according to the wine that he has taken. And-if that is true, then the Sufi says: 'the Heaven and hell is in the hand of man, if he only knew its mystery.' The world therefore for a Sufi is a winepress, a store in which all sorts of wine are collected. He has only to choose what wine he will joicelg and what wine will bring him that delight which is the longing of his soul. I had once an experience in India, which was my first impression and deep impression indeed, in this direction of life. When walking in the district of dervishes, where the dervishes have their solitude, I found ten or twelve dervishes together sitting under the shade of a tree, in their ragged clothes 12.

As I was curious to hear and see the path of different thoughts and ideas, I curiously stood there watching this assemble and what was going on there. These thinking souls sitting on the ground without a carpet made first 20 impression as if poor people, helpless ones, who have nothing perhaps in their possession, sitting in disap- pointment. But as they began to speak with one another, I could not keep any longer that impression. For when they addressed one another, they addressed by saying: 'Oh King of Kings, oh Emperor of Emperors.' And all that was to be said was said afterwards, but that was the address. I took aback first on hearing these words, but after giving a little thought of it, I thought, 'What is an emperor, what is a king? Is the real king and emperor within or without? And the emperor who is the emperor of the environments without is dependent on all that is without. The moment he is separated from the environment2', he is no longer an emperor.' But these emperors sitting on the bare ground were real emperors. No one could take away their empire, for their empire, their kingdom was not an illusion; their king- dom was a real kingdom. It seemed as if an emperor had a bottle of wine before him but these emperors had drunk that wine and had become real emperors. Do we not see in our everyday life a person who says: ' I am ill, I am sorry, I am miserable, I am wretched'? Put him in a palace and put a thousand doctors and nurses around him, he will still be wretched. And one may have a great suffering and pain and at the same time he says: 'No, I am well, I am happy.' All is well, all goes right, for that person is right. Does it not show to us that we are, we become 22that, which wine we drink22? The man who is drunken with the wine of success, he knows not failure. And if circumstances made him fail nine times, the tenth time he will succeed. The one who has drunk the wine of failure, you may give him all the possibility of success, but he has drunk the wind of failure, he cannot succeed. But with all this there is one subtle feeling every soul has, a feeling which cannot be explained in words, a feeling which makes man more corn- fortable in his armchair at home than befete perhaps before ten thousand people standing before him paying him homage. To a person he may be loaded with wealth, but the moment when all the pearls and jewels he has set aside and he has sat without anyone, and taken a rest, that is the time when he breathes a free breath. And what it teaches us? It teaches us that all else in the world that man has, it may have the greatest value in his eyes, but yet there is something hidden which he is seeking. When he has that, then he is happy. One might explain it with perhaps more examples, the same idea: that a person, however beloved, one does not want to have all the time; one wants to have one moment away from even the dearest person in the world. However proud one23 of his thought24, the thoughts may be great, deep and good, but his greatest joy is the moment when he is not 20. Sk.sh.: perhaps a small blank 2 1.

One25 may have best feeling of love, tenderness and goodness, but there are moments when there are no feelings. That moment is more exalt- ing. What does this26 show? This shows that the whole life is interesting because it is all intoxicating. But what is desired by the soul is one thing and that is a glimpse of soberness. this glimpse of soberness, how one experiences this glimpse of soberness, which is the continual longing of the soul? One experiences it by the way of meditation, by the way of con- centration. But if it is a natural thing, why one has to make an effort for it? The reason is that one enjoys this intoxication so much that afterwards one becomes addicted to drink. And that is the condition of every soul in this world. Every soul becomes addicted to drink the wine of life, and at the same time there comes a moment, if not in the28 early part of life, then later, if not when a person is happy, then when he is unhappy, then a time comes when he begins to look for that soberness which is a continual longing of his soul. The Sufi culture therefore is a culture in order to experience that soberness. It is no doubt very difficult to explain how this soberness is at- tained, and yet after having explained this subject of intoxication, it is not so very difficult. For it is as simple as saying that how to get rid of a drink is to keep away the drink for a time being and let one be without a drink. And therefore, as I have said that there are three principal wines, three principal intoxications: the intoxication of oneself and the intoxication of the occupation, and the third intoxication is29 the what the senses every moment feel. Now these three wines could not be taken away at once. It is just like taking away from a person who lives on wine his life's sustenance. But one can give a person a certain time, that during that time he may keep sober, he may take two wines, not three. And try another time only one, not two. And as in meditative life a person advances, he may arrive to that stage that the three wines on which he lives may be kept away, and yet he feels he lives and he becomes convinced that he exists without these three intoxications. Verily, this conviction of existing independent of these three wines, which brings man the realization of &vine eternal 301ife, which is the essence of 31 all religions.30 25.

Paris, Rue du Dragon, December 4th, 1923 lI would like to speak this evening on Sufism. It happens that often my mureeds who meet their friends, they are mostly asked what is Sufism. And you know already what human nature is. It wants to ask you about your whole life in one word, for it is very easy to ask a question; the difficulty is in answering. Perhaps these words that I will now say will to some extent help my mureeds to answer these questions, but at the same time they must know that the answer must come from their heart; that alone will make an effect. Only my explaining will make things clear.' Sufism in the meaning of the word is wisdom, wisdom which is a knowl- edge acquired from within and without, both. Therefore Sufism is not only an intuitional2 knowledge, nor it is only a knowledge acquired from the life in the world and outside. Sufism in itself is no religion nor even a culture3 as a distinct or definite doctrine. 4~here is,4 no better explanation of Sufism can be5, than6 saying that any person who has a knowledge of life outside and within is a Sufi. Therefore, there has not been in any period of the world's history a founder or an exponent of Sufism, but Sufism has been all the time. No doubt, as far as we can trace, we find that since the time of Abra- ham there have been esoteric schools, many of them were called Sufi schools. The Sufi schools of Arabia had7 Arabic culture; it was more meta- physical. '~nd sufism8, the Sufi schools of Persia, developed more the liter- ary aspect, and the Sufi schools of India developed9 meditative faculty. But the truth and the ideal has remained the same as the central theme of Sufism in all these schools.

These schools even till now exist, and it would not be an exaggeration if I said that there are millions of souls of the followers of different religions who are benefitted by the of these schools. No doubt every school has its own method and in every method it is coloured by the personality of the leader. There are the schools of dervishes and there are the schools of fakirs, there are schools of the Salik, who teach the12 moral culture with the philosophical truth. 13~ersonally I owe every obligation to the Sufi school of the Chishtis, in which I was initiated by my Murshid, Abu Hashim Madani.13 But there the account of the ancient history of Sufism finishes. 13~ow I wish to explain to you our Movement. l3 Our Movement is a movement of the members of different nations and different races, united together in the ideal of wisdom. That wisdom does not belong to any partic- ular religion or any particular race. Wisdom belongs to human race; it is a divine property which mankind has inherited, and it is in this realization that we, in spite of different nationalities and races and different beliefs and faiths, still unite and work for humanity in the ideal of wisdom. NOWI~ we have three aspects of our activity. The one aspect of our activity is what we call the Sufi Order, in which a member is admitted by the initiation. You may ask, 'By this initiation, to what school do we belong?'. We belong to the International School of the Sufi Order. What method is it? The Sufis of the ancient times, when they brought wisdom before the Muslim world, they have presented that wisdom in the realm of Muslim terminology. Our school today, having a wider field of work, we are presenting l5to the followers l all religions, besides to those who have per- haps no religion: to a spiritual person, to a material person, both. Therefore the realm in which the Esoteric School of the Sufi Order presents its method is necessarily different and distinct in itself. The representatives of this school, therefore, and those who are initiated, have a more general idea of Sufism than those belonging to special schools, who have an idea of that particular section. Therefore, you should not be surprised if one of our initi- ated members of the Sufi Order proved 16in his outlook a wider outlook compared with another member16 of the Sufis which is only a sectional school of the Sufis. However, you will find the central theme the same. This I have not said in order for us to be proud of our broadness. It is only said in order that we may try in our life that we may keep up to that ideal and not fall short of that broader17 outlook and that broader17 ideal.

The other part of our work is the part of the Universal Worship. Now in this, there is no doubt, religion is a subject which is most delicate to touch. The less spoken, the better. 13~wever, every problem that is before us, must be spoken when we are only mureeds together.13 No one can live with food and without water, and so no one can live with only esoteric re- ligion18, without a religion. And when one says that 'I will only live in the esoteric ideal and will not care for the outer religion,' that person may just as well say 'I will live in my soul and not be conscious of my body.' Besides providing that religion which is destined to be the religion of today, the great work that this activity is doing is to bring about that possibility of the people of different religions worshipping together, for all worship one God. However great be the possibility of opposition--every good work has to meet with opposition--nevertheless every man with clear sense and just and clear conscience will certainly approve of the idea which is behind it. And now coming to the third idea, of the brotherhood. The need of this idea no one with any thought can deny, and the one who will deny it does not know what he denies. The more one will study the12 life in its deeper sense, the more one will realize that the whole wisdom is summed up in the idea of brotherhood. lgBut now so far I have spoken to you the explanation of our work,lg but now 201 wish2' to give a more intimate idea of our work. Beside all the three special works that we are engaged in, it is the Message. It is not a man-made scheme of work, it is destined by God; and 2'mureeds, as they wi1121 advance, so this22 will be the one thing which will develop with their advancement, to be the real witness of the Divine Hand behind. I have en- gaged myself after having received the Call, without anything before me or by my side to encourage me on this path, and no words can explain how in this world of changes and difficulties I made my way. But at the same time I had within me that voice continually; that was all the consolation I had, without any encouragement that the outer world can offer. Now you are beginning to see the evidences of it. And if there are ninety-nine things to discourage you, perhaps23 there is one thing now for you to be encouraged. But think of your Murshid, that he has passed through a way when there was nothing to encourage24 except discouraging.

It is not that I am speaking, it is the sphere; the sphere is continually speaking of the Message. It is the answer of Cod to humanity.

And you will see that our sincere answer to the Divine Call will prove to be more successful than perhaps we had all the means that the world can offer. Only I want my mureeds to realize their responsibility and not to allow themselves to be discouraged by anything, and feel 28more strong28 for the very reason that we are small in number.

Paris, Rue du Dragon, December 7th, 1923 The Ideal and Work of the Sufi Movement. 2~he Sufi word2 itself is significant of its meaning since it comes from sophas or sophia, which means wisdom; wisdom not in the sense as every- body understands, for in our everyday language we confuse intellect with wisdom. But wisdom is not only intellectuality but is that knowledge com- bined with intellectuality which comes from within. Sufism, therefore, has never been in any period of history as a religion of a certain creed. It has always been as the essence of every religion and of all religions. When it was given to the world of Islam, it was presented by the great Sufis in Muslim terminology, and so, whenever the Sufi ideal is presented to a certain people in order to make it intelligible to those people, it has been presented in the realm of their own understanding. Now coming to the principal points, 3l should first say that3 Sufism is not necessarily a dogma or a doctrine. It is neither a form nor a ceremony. It does not mean that a Sufi does not make use of a doctrine or a dogma, of a ritual nor4 ceremony. He makes use of it but he is free of5 it. It is neither dogma, doctrine nor ceremony..nor ritual that makes a Sufi a Sufi. It is wisdom alone which is the property of the Sufi; all cither things he uses for his convenience, his benefit. %ufi is not against any creed, any doctrine, any dogma, any ritual or ceremony. To be against a creed or a religion apart, he is not even against the man who has no belief in God or spirit, for6 Sufi has a great respect for man. The God of the Sufi is the God of all; his ideal, His very Being. The Christ of the Sufi is his ideal. Therefore to a Sufi no one's Saviour is foreign to him. For he sees the beauty and greatness and the perfection of a human being in one ideal. Therefore he does not mind if that ideal is called by one person Buddha, by another person Krishna, by one Notes: This lecture became Gatheka no. 16 and exists in the form of a Headquarters' typescript (Hq.t.) and stencil (Hq.st.), which are identical In wording.

His ideal does not belong to history or tradition, His ideal belongs to the sacred sentiment of his heart. So how can he dispute and compare the ideals of the different creeds who dispute in vain, without making' impression upon one another, on historical and traditional points of view? The idea of the Lord, the Lord in the form of man, is the outcome of the deepest senti- ment, of devotion in-the of the heart. An ideal like this cannot be disputed and argued1° and compared. %ufi therefore considers the less spoken ''the better on the subject1 l, as he has the respect of that one ideal which is called by different people by different names. To a Sufi the life, human nature, the nature around, all this1* is a revelation, all this12 is a sacred Scripture. Does that mean that6 Sufi does not look upon the sacred Scriptures held in esteem by humanity in13 re- spect? No, on the contrary, he holds them as sacred as the followers of those Scriptures, only the Sufi sees14 that all Scriptures are different in- terpretations of thisf2 one Scripture which is before us constantly as an open book, if we could only read it and understand it. The object of worship for the Sufi is beauty. Not only the beauty in form and colour and line, but beauty in all its aspects, from gross to fine. The moral for the Sufi is the understanding of the harmony: in what way one can harmonize with one's soul, how one can harmonize with one's fellow man15. lnstead of labelling one action as a sin, another action as a virtue, instead of arguing on the subject of right and wrong of certain actions, he tries16 himself, as a musician trains his ears, to see what is harmonious and what lacks harmony in himself and in dealing with others. It is this continual development of understanding the law of harmony which produces in the Sufi that goodness which he calls divine. But harmony, the harmony l7 is the sign of life, and what is life? Life in poetic words may be called love. The heart, lo~eless~~, may have all the religion, all the knowledge, and yet it is dead. As the Bible says: 'God is love.' ~henl~ God is in the heart of man, and the heart of man is the highest Heaven. When that heart is closed by the absence of love, then God is closed. When that20 heart is open, God is open and man is living from that time. For the21 action, the21 conscience is the guide for a Sufi, and he seeks continually for justice.

Now 291 should like to speak a few words29 to explain the mission and work of the Sufi Movement in the world. Do we intend to do away with wars? Do we intend to disarm the whole world? Do we intend to make the whole world one nation? Do we intend to make the whole humanity the fol- lowers of one religion? Do we intend to make all men spiritual Z Do we try to make all people wise? We would be the first people to accuse our self30 for such a presumption. The world is as it is. All different institutions and movements are working in whatever they think would be the best thing for humanity. Our work is a humble service to Cod and humanity, to call our friends to3' right attitude, an attitude which will bring all different results. But we are not working for any particular result, we are working for the Cause which will produce results. If the attitude will not change, even if better results are brought about, they will not last. Therefore no doctrines, dogmas or principles we force upon people. Our work is only to present that attitude which is a natural attitude, that every soul from its depth is seeking for that attitude which is not new to human nature. The Sufi Movement, therefore, is a group of friends, belonging to different religions, different nations, different races, who have united in wisdom, in understanding, to serve at this juncture32. And the only source of protection 33that we draw from33 the energy and courage, is that one source, the Source in Whose ser- vice we devote our lives.

Answer : Yes, certainly there is a method in which a person is initi- ated, the one who is seriously seeking for truth and would steadily go on in that path with patience and trust. Question: What is the difference f rom34 Sufism and other move- ments? Answer : In the first place if a person says that 'my wisdom is dif- ferent from the wisdom of others,' he defeats his own argu- ment. Sufism would rather take away its name Sufi if it did not believe in the word wisdom not only belonging to Sufism alone, but as a divine heritage of man. And therefore there is no pretence nor intention of proving the Sufi wisdom as supe- rior to any other wisdom, but is acknowledging it as the same wisdom which has always existed, and calling35 it wisdom. Besides at this moment when the mechanism of the world's life has become so upset by the spirit of competition which is aris- ing, by the spirit of commercialism at this36 time, if we, those who try to do our best in serving God and humanity, if we had also the same view to prove our own way perhaps superior to the others, it will be the same spirit, we shall be doing no good. Our deepest sympathy goes to all those who are doing, in whatever way they can, good to humanity by their service, by bringing humanity together. And if we leave any opinion to form, we leave it to those who tread the path of Sufism, for them to find out for themselves how it has helped and whether it has been more suited to their nature or not. But apart of your question that3' 'how +tis-mele it can be applied to the practical life,' I will answer that Sufism, the central theme of our esoteric working, is practising so to speak the Presence of God. But in metaphysical terms it may be called: to keep before one's view reality in spite of the continual illusions which come before us from morning till evening. Those who tread this path, whatever be their method, we respect it, we consider they are treading the same path that we are.

Wisdom, not necessarily the cleverness which we often confuse with wisdom, but wisdom which is learned from within in addition to all the knowledge that man acquires from without. In the Muslim world no doubt the Sufis had to give their knowledge in the Muslim terminology, as the Sufi always is inclined to present that wisdom which is the essence of all religions in the language of the people that he meets. The ideal with which the Sufi Movement has2 formed today, is the idea of uniting the divided sections of humanity in the medium of brother- hood. There are many ways that people are trying to adopt in order to bring about a better understanding between people, social, industrial, commercial, but wisdom is the best way to bring about a better understanding. And now coming to the question of what is the Sufi Ideal. The God of the Sufi is the God of all people, God, Who is the means for the greater understanding of life, the highest ideal that man can conceive and at the same time his own being. The Master of the Sufi, his Saviour, is that Spirit Who is recognized as the Perfect in humanity. But does a Sufi dispute over this question, does he blame the Buddhist he thinks Buddha his Saviour, or does he doubt in the ideal ~indu~, Krishna? He, behind all different names and forms idealized by different people, sees one and the same Spirit, Who claims: ' I am Alpha and Omega.'

Every religion, every creed has its cer- tain moral teachings4 as to this particular principle is right, that particular principle is wrong. No principle or action is labeled by a Sufi as such and such. It is its application which makes it right or wrong. That light which guides the Sufi in the is his proper conscience, and harmony is the justification which guides him step by step onward to his idealized goal: to harmonize with oneself. And that is not sufficient. Also to harmonize with others in thought, speech, and action, that is the attitude of the Sufi. The highest Heaven of the Sufi is his own heart, and that love which man only knows as love, for a6 Sufi is Cod. And different people have called the Deity as the Creator, as the Judge, as the King, as the Supreme Being, but the Sufi calls Him: Beloved. Are there any dogmas, are there any rituals, ceremonies, which may be called Sufi? There is no such thing as this which restricts a Sufi, that by following them he can only be a Sufi. At the same time he is free to make use of any ritual, any ceremony that he thinks suited for his purpose. But now one might say: 'Then what can you tell us in order to make us intelligible the Sufi Idea?' In answer to this I will say that truth is that which can never be spoken in words, and that which can be spoken in words is not the truth. The ocean is ocean; the ocean is not some little water that one puts in the bottle. So the words cannot limit the truth. The truth must be known, as it is natural that the knowledge of truth comes sometime or the other. The disputes and discussions and arguments that people of one community have with another community, ' ecrn these things do not in- terest much the Sufi, for he sees the right in all things and the wrong of dif- ferent things also. There is no such right which has no wrong side to it, nor there is such wrong8 which has not a right side to it. Very often the wrong, made inside out, may appear right and very often the right made inside out, may appear wrong. Therefore, as Christ says: 'Judge ye not.' lnstead of judging the others, if a Sufi judges, he judges tt himself. If he acts right, that is whereg he is concerned with, because if man judges another, there is where man makes a mistake. For it is everybody who judges another; rarely anyone judges himself. The one who really judges himself, has no time to judge another. He has so many things to judge in himself, that he-has-ne time-te jaelge-anet her this lo occupies him .

Its object is to recognize the universal creed. But one might sat that it has a name. But if we did not have a name, people will give us one. It is just as well that we have one. And now coming to the question what is the striving of the Sufi. The striving of the Sufi is the13 self-realization. It is to this self-realization that he arrives by the means of his divine ideal, his Cod. He, by this, touches that truth which is the ultimate goal, and which is the yearning of every soul. It is not only realization, it is a happiness which words cannot explain. It is a peace, the peace which is the yearning of every soul. And how does he attain to it? By practising the presence of Cod. By realizing the oneness of the whole Being. By working every moment of the day con- sciously or in his subconsciousness that continual holding of the truth before his vision, when14 in spite of the waves of illusion which come every moment of the day dividing the glance of man from the absdate truth15. And no matter what name, any sect, cult or creed has, so long as the souls are striving to that object, to a Sufi they are all Sufis. But what is this Movement? This Movement is a group of the people belonging to different nations, different faiths and different creeds, to work by understanding the inner wisdom for the good of the whole humanity. A group who is in full sympathy with any other institution or activity, which is engaged in the same sort of work to whatever degree. The attitude of the Sufi to all different religions is ofI6 respect. His religion is the service of humanity and his only attainment is the realization of truth. 13.

Paris, MusEe Guimet, December gth, 1923 The Divine Blood Circulating through the Veins of the Universe. Often man has vague ideas as to the meaning of the word 'divine'. The word 'divine' has become his ideal, but this ideal is to be made first a real- ity. Ideal can only serve its proper purpose when it is made into reality. If the ideal is not made into reality the purpose is not accomplished. In the first place we must inquire, what is it that reminds us of the divine, what brings to us a feeling of the existence of the divine Being? It is what may be called beauty: the beauty, the delicacy, the colour in the flower and the brilliancy and the light of the precious stone. For in all this what is beauti- ful is intelligence, even manifest through material objects. The definition of the secret of fragrance, the secret of the brilliancy of the diamond, %eauty of the pearl, the secret behind3 all that appeals and attracts man, it is intel- ligence. Only true intelligence in all things is so to speak imprisoned, cov- ered, and in living beings this intelligence begins to manif.est and in man there is the great possibility of the manifestation of this intelligence. There- fore in things or beings, if anywhere, there is a trace te-be-feanel of the divine to be found; it is in the intelligence. And as many different degrees may be found in the beautiful flowers, one better than the others4, and as many different degrees may be found between the pebble5 and the diamond, a million more different degrees may be found between man and man. At this present time when man has disregarded that6 beauty and the value which is hidden in human personality, by this he has disregarded that divine substance which is hidden in man, Today there is no place, there is no recognition to human culture, whereas every other object is classified and a value has been fixed7.

There is no loss to the person who possesses this wealth; only by this before the world there is nothing distinguished, and there is no chance for every man to find out what is behind the veil. If one could explain the real meaning of education, and a true education, it would be, from the beginning to the end of man's life, realization of the circulation of the divine blood through the veins of the universe. For there is no limitation of time for the study and practice of this, for it is endless. The secret behind magnetism, which has its different aspects, is one and the same. No doubt, thelo magnetism, thelo personal magnetism, is divided into several different parts. There is a physical magnetism which comes llwith the l1 youth, with energy, with the healthiness of the body. The more healthy the person is, especially at the time of the lo youth, the person begins to show a certain energy in every action and in his every movement, and by this he expresses magnetism. Then there is a greater magnetism than that and that is the magnetism of mind. A person with a living mind is like a light; and as light attracts, and its warmth comforts, so a comfort comes out of that l2 person as a radiance. Besides, there is a magnetism of culture; a person who is well trained and has a certain culture, then his action, his word, his thought, all become rhythmic. And the fourth magnetism is the magnetism of the soul, the soul which is living. By living I mean which is not closed or covered by a grave, but which manifest l3 outwardly ad well as inwardly. It is that6soul which has another magnetism, a magnetism which is greater still and greatest of all other aspects of magnetism. Now the question is that l4 in order to attain l4 to that l2 highest mag- netism which alone is the endurable magnetism, '%ow can one attain it 15? It is by watching the divine essence, by noticing the divine essence in all things. You will always find the difference between two men of different temperament: there is one man appreciative of music, poetry and art, re- spondent l6 and ready to admire all that is good and beautiful; and there is another person who closes himself, he is not open to appreciate anything, 17ready to respond to anything or willing to admire anything. And when the door is closed from the divine manifestation which is in all things, then that continual source of attracting that new life and magnetism is closed. Then the soul dies of poverty. For the physical body, since it is limited, its suste- nance is also limited. But the soul, as the soul is not limited, so its suste- 8. Sk.l.tp., hq.t.: \"universities\" 9.

Soul is not satisfied with one moment's meditation only, nor l8 the soul is j9 satisfied with20 one good action in the week, nor l8 the soul is21 satisfied by attending one prayer perhaps in a week's time. The soul's hunger is greater than the hunger of the body or mind. Its hunger is satisfied by beauty, beauty in a11 22 aspects: beauty of colour, beauty of thought and imagination. Therefore naturally the soul of the artist, of the poet, of the musician, of a thinker, is always living. ~ut at the same time the difference is this, 23 that the one who is fond of beauty and derives that nourishment which comes from beauty, also has only a limited food. For the perfect satisfaction can only come when one knows all beauty to be one beauty, and that one beauty to be the divine beauty. Very often man questions to the idea of communication, a divine com- munication. But it is not an impossible thing, it is the most desirable thing there is. Only the person who thinks that the divine communication can be made by 24 Heaven and leave 25 this earth, he may well wait for some time. As for the example, we have no lack of examples in the world, if only we can see. For instance, to a true musician, a real musician, the music is not only an art, a symphony; it is something which speaks to him it is some- thing with which he communicates. A musician who arrives toi this stage, he may be perhaps striking one chord, and the continual striking of that 27 one chord will bring him to an ecstasy. For another person it is only striking a chord, but for him it is speaking with the piano; he is conversing with it. Besides all the great men that I have seen in my country, I having28 the great pianist of the Western world, Paderewsky, and I valued my privilege of hearing him at his house, when there were not many people, when he was29 himself. When he began to play and his play it seemed as if there was a question of his soul and an answer of the piano; the whole time it was a question of his soul and an answer of music. In the end it seemed as if at the close of the whole thing, that 30 the soul of the player and the music became one and perfect. Now this is one3' example, but there can be many other examples such as this. In order to attendJ2 to this perfection, one need not be a musician.

When man is not open, he is not even open to himself, he cannot communicate with life. Then he is lonely. But the man who is in communication with himself, he may be in the forest, in the wilderness, yet he is in the world, the whole universe is around. How many souls are among one's33 friends who, living in this world of crowd and34 yet are lonely, when it is so natural and possible that a man outside the world may keep in connection35 with the whole being. The scientist today has discovered that by touching or attaching one- self to the ele~trical~~, one can get37 in a certain part where the energy is less, more can be attained by it. If this material aspect of electricity can give a new life, a new vigour to the body, then this continual battery, if one came in contact with this, could he not attain from that l2 all he desires? An38 energy which is everywhere, and everywhere one can get in touch with it, if one only knew how to communicate with it, an energy which is not without an intelligence, but which is the perfection of intelligence, and the mind and soul which39 become more and more intelligent by coming into contact with it. But now one might ask: how can one attain to40 it? As it is necessary that, in order to sing well one must cultivate one's voice, and as it is necessary, in order to get muscularly strong one has to make physical exercises, so it is most necessary to get in touch with the divine life which is all around and above41 us, which is within and without us, to practise to get in touch with it and to keep in eentaet touch with it. We see that in all different occupation42 of life, whether it is scientific inventions or in indus- try or in business, one must be so absorbed in it in order to do something worthwhile in life. The same law43 can be applicable to the spiritual work as it is to the material work. Concentration is the main thing, and when the concentration is not attained44, then whatever a person will do, it will not bring about worthwhile results. You can find in all different occupations the cause of failures in ninety-nine among a hundred cases is the lack of concentration.

A spiritual or religious attitude apart, even from a material and selfish point of view a48 cannot deny the greatest value of concentration in life. But when we come to realize that there is one great49 energy, an energy which is not only an energy, but intelligence itself, and which is divine, and which is all over, then one has come face to face to the object one is searching50. 0111~5~ then what remains for him is52 that intellectual knowl- edge does not satisfy his purpose. For him37 remains to try and find out how he can communicate, how he can come into touch with that l2 all-pervading energy. And the answer is: one has to mould oneself, one has to prepare oneself in order to become a fitting instrument in order to fit in with this all-pervading energy. And the question is thati3, how one has to prepare? The answer is that every soul has been made to answer in this symphony of the whole universe as a certain note, and when he will not give that note, he will not be fulfilling his life's purpose, and thereby he will always feel dissatisfied with himself and others. And how will he arrive54 to attain or to tune himself to that note? By the ear training, in symbolical expression; plainly speaking, by studying the law, the nature and secret of harmony in life. 55~ut how will he fit in with the rhythm? All distress, all misunder- standing, all the tragedy that one experiences through life is also the lack of keeping in life a certain rhythm, which is asked of him by56 life.55 Does it not teach us that there are two important things to remember? One is to develop the sense of harmony in one's everyday life and to develop the sense of rhythm in everything one does. If one has developed the sense of har- mony and yet has not known the secret of rhythm he still will have difficul- ties. And if one knows the rhythm and how to fit in with the rhythm of the universe, and yet has no sense of the nature and secret of harmony, then also he will meet with failures. It teaches us that the whole life is as a music; and to study it, we must study it as music. It is not only study, but it is only 57 practice which makes man perfect. If anyone told me, that person is a miserable or a wretched person, or a distressed person, the answer will be, 'He is out of tune.'

Very often people ask that53, 'There is a good man; why must he suffer? There is a very nice person, a religious person; why has he distress?' And there are others who will answer a thousand different reasons. They will say that perhaps in the life before he had done something wrong; there- fore, he has to pay his debts. Or some will say, 'The goodness must always suffer.\"ut when we come to the practical side of the question, the answer is simple: that man-made goodness is not nature's 58 goodness. Nature de- mands, life demands a certain standard of understanding, of thinking, of living, and this59 can be learned by learning the tune and the rhythm, not only by learning, but by putting oneself to that tune and setting oneself to that particular rhythm which makes the music of life. It is by this, in this manner, that the happiness is attained, that happiness which is the seeking of every soul. And it is in this manner that one will progress continually until he will touch the divine spirit, the spirit that pervades all through and which is everywhere. 58.

Brussels, Avenue de ~lor&al,~ December 15th, 1923 2 It is my great happiness today to be able to speak from the same platform where I have once spoken before, when the founder and the leader of this group which exists of this centre was living and when I had received in this house the great kindness and love and appreciation of those who have met here. Now coming on the subject, the subject of the power of3 word, I should like to first mention that a subject which is so little thought of today stands in the Bible on the foremost. it says, 'First was the Word and the Word was God.' In another place we read in the same Bible that the 'First Word came, then became light'. By this we learn that the origin and the source of light4 is to be found in the word. But when we go a few thousand years before, a few thousand years before the Bible, in the most ancient scriptures of Hindus, there we read also that 'Word was Brahma', in other words that the Creator was existing in the form of Word. He created by the power of Word. When we come to the latest scripture, which had its direct or indirect influence upon the whole humanity, that scripture, the Qur'an, that scripture says that 'God said the word be and it became.' It is not only these three, but many other scriptures also. They all give evidence of the power of the word. But a thing so known to the prophets of all times, where has that gone, where that science has gone? That science has been lost to the view of generality. The reason is that man engaged himself with the things of the earth and the knowledge of material things, and in that way he has lost the art of the ancient times. But by losing this5 great science, this5 mystical secret, what the soul has attained? The soul has attained an increasing deafness. And this increasing deafness prevailed with the prevailing for6 material life. Nev- ertheless there have been some thinkers at every time, and there have been some servants of God working knowingly or unknowingly in every period. They have always admitted that the Word was lost. It was not lost to them, they saw that from generality that word was lost. By the loss of this word it is meant that the secret of the whole life was lost. But it is an exagger- Notes: 1. Sk.l.tp.: \"Avenue de Fior'eall' omitted and added w~ommunaut6 'Monads\"' 2.

Besides, man did not hear that word from the sky, but he heard that word from the earth, the outcome of which is the great progress and awak- ening in the material science. All these great inventions which are just like miracles from this time, they have come to such great minds who have so to speak communicated with the matter and the matter so to speak has spoken with them face to face. All these great inventions are the answers from the earth to their communication with the matter. In this way the word was not lost, only the direction was lost. Man learned continually from the objective world things that he can touch and can make them intelligible, and always disbelieved in things that are not intelligible to him, and so became far re- moved from the main part of life's mystery. Nevertheless if at any time in the world's history, if man has probed the depth of life, he has found by communicating with the inner life in artistic expression, by communicating with the heavens. And what that communication is? That is the word. Now coming to the ancient usages, Zarathustrians who existed before the Jewish and Christian religion, and whose religion is till now being fol- lowed by a limited number of people, till now repeat their prayers and their words in the same language in which they were given in that time. Hindus after their thousand of years' progress in wisdom, they have kept for their meditation the same words of Vedanta. And it is from that that science of Mantra yoga has come. There are many yogas among Hindus, but no yoga can be compared to Mantra yoga. Now coming to the Moslims whose religion was modern. The Prophet when he thought that there is someone to communicate with, he went away from the town and had solitude on the top of a mountain. Sometimes fast- ing, standing, staying there for two, three days, night and day, what in the end he found? He found that a voice began to come to him, a voice in answer to his soul's cry. His soul so to speak went, pierced through all the planes of existence and so to speak touched the source of all things. But how the answer came, in what form? The answer was coming from every- thing, the wind, the water, the sphere, the air, everything bringing the same answer. But it is not limited to a certain person or a certain time. In our everyday life there are times when a sadness comes, and it seems as if everything in the world, even the voice of the beasts and birds, cause the sadness. There comes again the hour of profound joy. 7~t that time the sun helps to give the joy, and the clouds covering the sun also give the joy; the cold, the heat, the friend, the enemy, all help to give the joyO7 This world to a mystic is like a dome, a dome that gives the re-echo of all that is spoken in it. But what is spoken from the lips only reaches as far as the ears, but what is spoken from the heart reaches the heart. The word reaches as far as it has come. It depends from what source it has come, from what depth it has risen. The Sufis of all ages have therefore given the greatest impor- 7.

There is nothing that is not accomplished m, there is nothing that achieved or known by the power of the word. Therefore esotericism or mysticism has word as its principal and central theme. But what is the word? Is word just what we say, is that the word? No, that is the word of the surface. Our thought is a word, our feeling is a word, our voice, our atmosphere is a word. There is a saying, 'what you are speaks louder than what you say.' That shows that man does not always speak, but his soul speaks also. And not only that. How the fortune-tellers read the future? They hear it. They say %hat they read it from the lines, from the astrology. They will say8 that they see from the action of man. But what is it all? It is all a word. Because word means expression, expres- sion in voice, in word, in form, in colour, in line, in movement. And it is in this that 9we see thatg all are united in one thing and that is esoteric side of mysticism. Of course many people in the Western world have said that 'for us it is very difficult to have a meditative life in the activity of the Western world. We have so many responsibilities and occupa- tions.' But my answer is that for the very reason they need more medita- tion. Then a person may say that 'I have loweaknesses to over~ome,'~ things to do, how can I go in a meditative life?lO' But the answer is that the way of getting above weaknesses is, one must go through meditation. Besides, when there are many responsibilities1 l of life, the very reason tells that it is better to meditate and make the responsibilities\" lighter. It is not the getting worried over one's responsibilities that helps man, it is being responsible, but at the same time being strong enough to lift it up12. There are words, the words which are known by the mystics, words which do not belong to any language; but the words of many languages may seem to have sprung from these mystical words. And it is by the help of these words that one develops two faculties: seeing and hearing. Seeing, I do not mean seeing by the eyes as everybody sees. By seeing 1 mean pene- trating, and it is the penetrating quality of seeing that makes man a seer, and it is that word really which was meant by clairvoyance. Of course now people have used the word so much, that one would not even like to use it. But the people have not left any word that exists in this world without having misused it, and for this one has to leave the whole language, if one was so sensitive about words. But then there is hearing. By hearing I do not mean to listen. But by this I mean to respond, to respond to heaven or to the earth, to respond to every influence that helps to unfold the soul, and 8.

Brussels, Rue de la concordel1 December 16th, 1923 Sunday afternoon Beloved ones of God, My subject this afternoon is, 'Man, the Seed of God'. It is in this secret that man finds that key that has been lost, the proof of which is that the religions of the world seem to be losing their hold upon people, in the Eastern part of the world, as well as in the West. Why is there an increasing number of the ungodly? Why materialism is ever on the in- crease? That itself answers that man has lost the key, the key which opens the secret of life. And it is God Who is the key of that secret. During my travelling of some years throughout the Western world, I found that in every part of the civilized world people getting tired of not only religion, but also of the belief in God. It seems that the deity's name is repellent to an advanced thinker. He thinks that tha? was something which was a creed of the past. The old people, who did not know life better, they had some cer- tain idea. And now we are too advanced to hold on to the ideas of the past. Many know it, but very few will admit it, and many will not say it, but almost all know it, In the East perhaps it is different, but the whole world moves on in the same direction. If the material3 direction is humanitf' direction, then the whole world goes in the material direction. If it is a spiritual5, naturally the whole world must go in the spiritual direction. In spite of all the material progress which had raised the value of civilization Notes: There are two later typescripts of Saklnats shorthand transcrlption; the ear- lier one has some alterations and additions In Saklnats handwriting (Sk.l.tp.1) and the later one gives most of these alterations In type (Sk.l.tp.11).

It fell down during this ' which this new construction has shown during the war. It has made 8at least8 the thinking world to, at least, think for a moment that theg civilization that we thought to be the best, has not proved to be the best. And no just person, a person with some thought, will deny the fact after having reflected upon it. If we ask to ourself, 'has the world advanced?' there is no doubt, the answer will come, 'yes'.' The new inven- tions which have brought about the miraculous phenomena, and the organi- zations which have brought alllo the countries closer in communication by telegraphy and telephone and by the wireless, it all shows that the1 ' human- ity has progressed, but only progressed in a certain direction. The progress which cannot bring all the satisfaction, it can only bring that outer happi- ness and pleasure, but that inner happiness remains. It would seem to be a saying of a simple believer, that in the belief of God there is the remedy for12 all diseases. But I should declare that even the wisest person can claim the same after having arrived to a certain realization of life's secret. Now coming to the question of this evening, that if we ask to ourselves the definition of the seed, we shall find that the seed is not only the begin- ning of the plant, but the seed is the end of the plant's destiny too. Because the plant is meant to bring out the seed. When we take the whole manifes- tation as a plant, then all the different grades in which the manifestation has manifested, we shall find that tt-mrr the final thing was the bringing up of man. One may say in connection with a plant that the stem sprung first, then leaves, then came the flower, and from the flower came the seed. And one may say the same thing in connection with the whole manifestation, that there was the mineral, then vegetable, then animal, but in the end it finished in man. And this idea, although the scientist today says that this is a new discovery, I have discovered that from the animal life comes the man13 life. I can show you in the scriptures of Persia perhaps thousand14 or two thou- sand years before, in which you can find the statements which give you the proof of them having known this idea. But what this idea tells us? This tells that this whole creation was intended to bring about a certain purpose and one purpose. But it is the incapability of every man of understanding that purpose, which brings about life's catastrophes. If majority understands that purpose, then the minority follows. But if those who know the purpose are in minority, then the majority may have their thought. If I were to explain the picture of the material conditions of the world which directed15 man to such occupations as war and disasters and bloodsheds, besides the hatred between nations and races, one will understand that this all comes from the lack of Sk.l.tp.1: Sk. added *'it\"; Sk.l.tp.11: \"it1' Sk.sh., Sk.l.tp.: a blank Sk.'s separate annotation: l'e+-+eas+rl Sk.1.tp.l: Sk. crossed out \"them Sk.l.tp.11: \"about\" instead of \"all\" Sk.l.tp.1: Sk. crossed out lithe\"; Sk.l.tp.1 I: \"then omitted Sk.l.tp.: llofll instead of \"forn Ibid.: 'Ihumanw instead of \"manw I bid.: ~thousandsll I bid.: \"direct\" instead of \"directed1'"},{"pageNumber":921,"pageContent":"the understanding of that one secret. Knowing this, the great souls like Buddha or Krishna, they have all tried their (utmost)16; for an instance in the 'Prayer of the Lord' one reads that 'Thy Will be done on earth as in Heaven.' If one could only understand the meaning behind it, it is the whole philosophy. For it makes one know and understand that by this only it is meant that if every man has his purpose 17as a17 separate from another, there will always be the lack of order and peace outwardly and inwardly both. Why the wars come, why ladifferences come?18 Because of the differ- ence of purpose. When the nations have their different purpose, when everylg individuals have their different purpose, then there will be no unity. But at the same time it is unnatural too. For the purpose of every tree is to bring about the seed. And so the purpose of all nations and each individual as the final purpose is to bring about that seed, that seed which is the source of this whole manifestation. It is not the trees who have declared God, nor mountains, neither the birds have taught the Gospel, nor the ani- mals have preached religion. If ever it has been taught, if ever God has been brought to the idea of mankind, it has been brought by man. It is not only one man's right but it is the right of every man to bring about that source, the source of which all has come. By this do not think that I at all mean that one must not do one's occupation in life, but what I mean, that one must think that every occupation, everything that he does, that the fin- ishing of that is not only the aim. His aim is to bring about that seed, the source of his whole life, in his life. The modern psychologist says that, 'Well, any idea like this is acquired', but it must be remembered that teaching has made this idea clear, but God-ideal is the inborn tendency of man. The best explanation of the word God is to be found in the Persian word, which is Klluda, because it is not only a name, but it is the meaning of the idea. For - it means that self-revealing. This itself shows that if God is self-revealing, theGO man is not always depending upon the teaching of another, but his natural longing is for God. Very often I have met the people without a belief in God, but I have always found that there is some craving behi~d, in spite of their denying. But the craving is there all the same. Besides this, man by nature is vain. And when once his vanity has taken up21 the idea of disbelief, it is very difficult to make his vanity believe what his soul craves for. Besides, a person feels proud sometimes to think that, ' l do not believe as everybody believes, because I am more intelligent, and I am different from others.' But at the same time there are many among those who have all their life denied the idea of God, after having a kind of sorrow in their life, or a heartbreak or a disappointment, or after having gone through life, in the end they have gone to search for somewhere.

And whenever she said, 'But you do not believe in God, how can you be happy?', the answer was, 'But you believe in God, and I believe in you, so that is the same.' No doubt, I do not by this mean to say that belief in God is suffi- cient for our lives. The belief in God is only a first step, first step towards the accomplishment of the purpose for which this whole universe is formed. But if a person with his belief in God is content, there are millions and mil- lions and millions who believe in God, and they are not all saints, nor they are the best people. You may find perhaps among those who seem to be unbeliever more true and just people than you might find among those who have such belief. Nevertheless for a thinker, for a wise person, God-ideal is the key to the life's secret. The person who only stands on his belief, he is like a man standing on a step instead of walking on the staircase. But the person who goes along on the stairs, he is the person who is reaching to a realization which can only come by the belief in God. Therefore there are many people whose feet are so to speak stuck in the path of truth. Neither they are in the world nor in Heaven. They become stuck in their belief and they do not move from there. By the belief in God, the first thing that we have to learn is the source. And as soon as we know the source, we begin to feel differently from an average person. For the difference is this, that the person who is wise in God and the person who is worldly wise, now, if these both people happen to be good, the person in the world, he will say that,' If lZ4 good to another person, it is a pleasure to me and the other person will learn to do good also.' But the man who is wise in Cod, he will say that, 'When I do good to that person, it means that I am doing good to myself.' That makes a great difference, because when a person realizes the source, he becomes one with another, and whenz5 does not meet with another person in the realization of that source, then another person is another person. In this there are two ideas: there is one idea of unity and there is an idea of duality. The idea of unity comes from the realization of God, which is the ultimate truth. The idea of duality comes by the absence of that knowledge, and if one has not attained through the idea of God that idea of unity, his realization is not complete. And if one has belief in God and hag6 not arrived to the idea of unity, he has not accomplished the pur- pose of life. Therefore the destination of the Sufi Movement is to serve humanity towards this end. It is not a new religion, it is not a certain cast or creed, it is only wakening the people of all different religions or of no religion to the divine ideal. To waken humanity to the understanding of truth, which is to be learned by the understandingz7 of God, especially after such time that humanity has gone through, after these passed years, and the hatred that exists in the heart of man for one another is ever on the increase. People know about different diseases, but they do not know that the worst disease 24. ibid.: \"dof' added 25. Ibid.: \"het1 added 26. Ibid.: \"has\" 27.

And it seems that this plague is vastly spreading in the world. The bitterness in the heart, if one could only think that what psychological effect the thought of prejudice, of hatred, of bitterness gives man. It is not only that 0utwar8~ make persons ill, but the great many illnesses come from inner reasons. To take a bitterness and to keep it in the heart, it is worse than keeping a drop of poison in the boddo. Now the time has come that humanity, after its contemplation on ma- terial gain must contemplate on another gain. These gains which are taken away in a moment of time, and leave man in his grave alone, without any of these3'; and this earth which has not even kept the wealth of the pharaohs near to their heart, eved2aftet my-take-the , that even after so many years that wealth which has been buried with them, has been taken from them. That shows that this world has never allowed anyone to have his belongings33 forever. It is a disappointing world. The true conso~ation~~ of man does not belong to the earth or in its knowledge. It does not mean that the knowledge of the world is useless, but the knowledge of the world does not suffice the whole purpose of life. There is only one thing in which the true satisfaction can come, and that is the knowledge of the deeper side of life, the knowledge of the source and goal of all things. And it is the reali- zation of that knowledge which can be called divine light and if there is any happiness ever to be found, if there is a peace to be found, it is in this. And in35 absence of this all the good of the earth that the earth can offer man, it will not suffice one's36 life's purpose. Whether man is young or old, what- ever age, whether he is wise or not wise, that is another question. But every person's life has need of spiritual guidance.

Brussels, December 17th, 1923 at Mme. Craeffe's. I have the great happiness of meeting my friends again in Brussels, and in this house where the Message commenced. It is a great pity, %ur friend Madame Craeffe, is not with us just now, owing to her poor health. Nevertheless we feel her with us in the heart just the same, and we pray from the bottom of our hearts that from this moment that we all pray to- gether for her, that she soon will be better and well. Now coming to the question of the work of the Message since I left you. I should like to say a few words in what way the work has been done. The Message was given in the different parts of the United States, in New York, in Chicago, 3~etroit, in San Francisco. Of course the time was too short for a large place like the United States. In four months I had to finish my visit, whereas four months only a city like New York would take. No doubt, after having spread the Message, there was a great demand for insti- tutions to be founded in different places for the study of the philosophy, and only I was able to do so in4 few places like Detroit, New York, Santa Bar- bara and Los Angeles. In San Francisco already a society existed. Of course my.greatest difficulty in the United States was that the response is greater, and to answer that response there is a lack of workers who are trained and ready to answer the great demand of the place. I returned with the hope that soon some of our friends will be ready, with enthusiasm and with their study and practice to do what little they can, if not in their own countries, then in the United States bho have taken a deeper interest 5. In America no doubt I found that there is one thing which appeals to an American, whatever be his occupation, Aatevet-be or position, and that is the idea of brotherhood.

There has been a great difficulty between America and Japan, but when the diffi- culty came in Japan, this disaster, when the president wanted some few mil- lions, twice as much was at once contributed, because the feelin of broth- erhood touches the heart of these people. When we think of thatf1, it shows that brotherhood is needed evervwhere. No man who has some deeu12 sense of divine ideal, will deny the fact that brotherhood is the main thing which 13 on l3 . It is a great pity that religions, whether in the East or West, have their own creeds and church. When it comes to brotherhood they say, 'We have our brotherhood, you have yours.' Each thinks14 they have their own broth- erhood. But the way we have to look at it, is as one brotherhood. Therefore the work of the Sufi Movement is not to create a Sufi brotherhood. It is noti5 a brotherhood, but a means to create a brotherhood, it is working for a human brotherhood. There is a necessity of a certain organization. Therefore the organiza- tion has not only supplied the need for a brotherhood, but also it has helped to support the two activities l6 . The one part is the devotional part; that what the world is lacking today is devotional attitude. People study and they want to practise if they can attain some certain power. But what they lack of17 devotion, which means the lack of a fuller life. If there is a trace of God is to be found, it is in the heart of man. If it is not open enough, then the natural flow is closed and the life becomes incomplete. To live a complete life is to live a life of that sympathy and friendliness which pours outl8 another person, to the one who deserves it in the form of love, to the one who does not deserve it, in the form of tolerance.

People have quarreled because the source has been covered by different veils. But for us to know it as one 22 . If there has come enlightenment to people, it has come form one source instead of quarreling about it. When- ever it has come, it has come from one light23 and one source. And if there have been different scriptures and teachers, they have been just veils over24 one truth. Mat-deeg Why to dispute over names? The spirit is one, God is one, religion and truth are one. Now coming to even more important work that on which25 strength our whole Movement 26 , that is the esoteric work in which anybody is received by the initiation. It is not in the ordinary word of initiation, it is a word, there is no other word to interpret, Bayat, we call it. Initiation, it is a trust, when the pupil says, 'I give you my trust, that whatever you give me I am sure I shall be benefited.' The teacher says, 'All that27 I shall give to you, you will keep as your sacred trust', that is the teacher's trust. When the trust is given from both sides, that is an initiation. What is attained by the initiation? One is to acquaint oneself with the deeper side of life. What is the deeper light28 of life? The education, whatever it is, it is not compete one is keeping to the outer side of life and not yet entered into the deeper side of life. And now the question is, how can one attain to the deeper side? It is quite a different meaning. One method is to acquire the knowledge from the life without, and that is going to the school and attaining the knowledge in that way. Another method is quite different; not going to a school or insti- tution and study, but closing the door of one's room, sitting in solitude, clos- ing the eyes, being oneself once again, and try and put one's mind within, and seek the source within, to get the knowledge which can be got only from within. Of course that art has its rules and regulations, which are not applicable to each in the same way. Like the science is one and the same, still when a physician receives different people, to each he gives a separate prescription for each condition to get it right.

But by attaining that strength which comes from the deeper side of life, one is able to get above things, to 33put 33 the influences which come up and jar one's sensibility34. They are all thrown back and one can keep oneself in the right tune35 and rhythm. The purpose of life is to keep oneself in the right tune35 and rhythm. The nature of life is to put us off the right tune35 and rhythm. Every moment there36 is that struggle. Even for a saint or sage there is this struggle to meet; from the37 first moment one gets up in the morning, one has to meet with this struggle. 38~o if38 the advanced souls, then what with the ordinary people? Therefore there are so many suicides, people unhappy. Very few you will find content, those who say they are content. But still really content you will find 39 . That shows that life is a continual struggle. It is no need to say that it is no struggle. One must develop one's strength to combat with this struggle and to harmoniously40 and4' rhythm and tone cope with this struggle, creating at the same time harmony in life. Therefore Sufism is called the philosophy of love, harmony and beauty.

For it is the friendship for the East and for the West which gives him that scope of serving the world at large. I very much wish that at this time there were more souls like he, who are open with their heart to all the wisdom coming from different sources, from different parts of the world; so as the Palais Mondial accommodates of the world, so the heart of our friend. Now coming to the question of East and In order to distinguish East from West, it is natural that I shall give the points where they differ. Now the points that differ, and if we thought about them more we shall say the same thing as the great English poet3 has said, that 'East is East, and West is West, and they can never meet.' I should like to first give those points which prove his saying true. The idea is that the people in the East, in all ages had one object in view, and that object was to get in touch with the deeper side of life. Some came sooner to that point, some later, some had to struggle along, and for some it was easy. But naturally to the wise and fool- ish4 the outer world 5had a5 less contact. By this I do not mean to say that there are not people who are after the material gain and material things and that there are not people who love wealth and all that belongs to the earth. There are earth worshippers in all places and there are hell worshippers in Notes: At a later date (after February 1927), thls lecture became Social Gatheka no. 35.

Now, for an instance, if you go among the most learned people in the East, they will show their great learning and knowledge about things, about science and about art, but at the same time you will find that it is all to gain the-deepet the knowledge of the deeper side of life. You can see an artist there, you can talk to him, you can find that in any work he is doing, you can see that his whole motive is to gain the deeper side of life. In the same way the politicians and warriors of that time, their minds always7 attached to that same idea. For instance we have before us the his- tory of the Prophet Mahommed8, a Prophet who was not only a mystic, but a general of his army and a statesman, who wasg first in the history of the Orientals who made a constitutional government in Mecca, the first consti- tutional government in the world. Those who formed the first parliament in Medina, that group was called Madina, and every man and every woman in the city had the right to vote in that parliament. Remember, it is now 1500 years10! Besides, about the policy, MahornmedB was born in Mecca, and was three times exiled from his place because he was giving to his people the new ideas of religion, which was not agreeable to his people. There were people who killed his disciples, and made every kind of difficulty, and apen Hm all sorts of sufferings were thrown upon him. There camel1 a time that he has now a large number of disciples, when he says, 'Shall I go again to my motherland? I want to go and give again the message which I have tried to give.' They said, 'Prophet, we shall come with you and we shall give our lives in the cause, and we shall see that your messa e is received1' in the same land where from they have insulted you andy3 thrown14 you have been14 out.' h4ahomrned8 went with his dele army of disciples, not for in- vasion, but to give the message. But hearing that he came with an army, they prepared an army and there was a battle. In the end Mahommed was victorious and entered Mecca. When he entered, the whole arrangement l5 there, all the leaders were16 surrendered and all those people were brought before him. When they were brought before him, he asked, 'What treatment do you expect from me? ' 'What treatment could we expect', they said, 'except the fitting treatment which would come from the Prophet of Cod?' And the answer of the Prophet was, 'Yes, the same treatment will be given to you. All you have done to me and my people I have forgiven.'

They said thati7, 'we have come, we have followed you to your country, but we want you.' The Prophet said, 'Yes, they will take my message, but I will go with you.' After all that war and bloodshed, lawhat the Prophet didla? He left, the Qur'an and gave the prin- ciplelg, left20 Medina and died.

Now today a man comes and tells the world about the repetition of a word which cures people from illnesses. The scientific and unscientific world seems to be moving about, and says, 'What is this?

In the first place a race which came from the ancient Aryan sources, in a country where they had the diffi- culties of climate, where it was necessary that life had, owing to the cli- mate, great responsibilities, it naturally made them more active, and being active, activity with the things of matter gave them that communication with the matter, the result of which is a phenomena40. All these inventions that we see today are no less than a phenomena40, a miracle. But this mira- cle has come from a communication with the things from the earth, and as the product of things of the earth is as visible and tangible as the earth.

Another one is sitting one hand upon another hand, and perhaps in his character thoughts, feelings developing, something, but he has nothing to show. It is something developing in himself which he himself cannot define very well, nor eon-he-himdf others can see it. Therefore it is natural that a progress made in the objective line is visible and tangible, 44a progress in the 45p46 is difficult to say4' how far one has reached. However, with all 48that difference\" human nature is the same. Those who have developed in their thought, in their feelings, they are not only in the East, there are many of them to be found in the West also. Besides those who have a material inclination and produce49 from the matter something4', they are not only in the West, they are in the East also. But in the West there is a scope to bring it out what one has invented, what one has found out, but in the East there is no scope to bring it about, and in this way the difficulty arises. Nevertheless the East and West both have their actions directed in two different poles, the material progress of the East has been hindered by one thing which is the climate, a climate which makes the whole day useless. One would rather sit and dream than be active and work. That also makes difference in inclinations. Besides that, very much of the West- ern progress is due to the uniformity of the people; and the backwardness of the East in that line of progress is the lack of uniformity. Every man in the East has his individual progress, and whenever there is an individ~alistic~~ progress, it is a very free progress but at the same time a progress which is not recognized by the ones \" individualistic progress, I mean if a sci- entist comes with a new invention, which is not understood by another sci- entist, he will certainly oppose him. Therefore every intelligent person in the East, whenever he progresses in his own line, he52 has a great opposition to meet with, and no one he finds who can perfectly understand him.

And thats8 brings us a great hope that East and West, whoh depend for their progress fromd0 their mutual exchange and understanding, will soon come 61 .

But the greatest benefit that can come from the meeting of East and West together63#64 by the interchange of thought and ideal, and65 in order to meet in that light which is the light of intelligence and which is divine by nature. The Sufi Movement has directed all its efforts that the East may be able to appreciate all that is good and worthwhile in the West and that the West may understand and sympathize with all that is worth understanding and sympathizing66 in the East. Words cannot explain to what extent the world will become benefited if once this67 idea is realized, because just now the East working in its own way, the West working in its own way, is like working with one eye, the other eye closed. It is in the unity of East and West that the vision will become com- plete, and in this completion68 the great disasters6' and troubles which have kept the world in a kind of uneasiness, will be rooted out.

Zs Can that scientific point of view bring sympathy in73 East to the point of view74 individualistic progress? Answer: I thank . Mr. Otlet for his kind words and for his question. If as I understand the question you ask if there is75 individual- istic tendency among the people of the East also in the realm of science? Yes, there is a scientific tendency, a great deal. No doubt there is never a separation between science and metaphysics in the East, and therefore to us there is no such a thing as re- ligion as a separate subject. To us all that educates our life is religion. For instance science in the West is considered as a science. Science in the East is considered as a part of religion. Grammar for instance is grammar. In the East it is a petal of religion also. For instance astronomy is a separate part, it is an education, perhaps a science, but rot in^^^, we call it rot in^^^, is part of the religion. We do not separate one part of knowledge from the other part, but we take all different aspects of knowledge as one, and that knowledge is to probe the depth of life. But one thing is very much against us and that is our individualistic effort. Our individualistic effort sometimes goes so far that the man on our side does not understand and he wants to pull it down. For instance you will find the example of Wagner's music, that when he began his music, people began to throw stones at him before he met with the king; he appreciated and first became his audience, then, after that all went well. That is individualistic effort. And you can see how individualistic effort is met with by the masses who cannot understand fully.

And after having79 the Western culture, he has established now in Calcutta an institution on the Eastern prin- ciple. He gives his inspirational work free of charge to any man of the world who would be willing to come and learn. Not only to the people of his land, but to anyone. And that is the ideal behind the institution of Rabindranath Tagore; that is in the depth of the Eastern person: to share his loaf with all. Now the time has come when we in the East and West will waken and to share our loaf one with the other. There is a greater happiness.

Brussels, Rue de Loxum, 18th December 1923 ' Art and Religion. 2~y subject of this evening is art and religion.2 Very few in the world link religion with the3 art or art with religion. But in the3 point of fact the3 art is much more important than an average person realizes it to be, in spite of the saying that the3 art is what man makes and nature is what Cod makes. But I would like to say that the3 nature is what Cod makes as Cod, and art is what Cod makes as man. The artist who has arrived to4 some perfection in his art, whatever be his art, he5 will come to realize that it is not he who ever did. It is someone else who came forward at every time. And in the perfect things that the artist produces he hardly can imagine that it is produced by him, for6 he can do nothing but bow his head in perfect humility before that unseen power and wisdom who7 takes his body, his heart, his brain and his eyes as its instru- ment. Whatever be that art, be it a8 music or poetry or painting or writing or whatever manner, whenever the3 beauty is produced, it must not be thought that man producesg it. It is through man that Cod finishes His cre- ation. Therefore art is not only an imitation of nature, it is an improvement upon it. '?here is nothing that is done in this world and in heaven, which is not a divine immanence, which is not the divine creation. It is the dividing of that divine work that makes that perplexity that separates man from his Lord. Notes: This lecture became Social Gatheka no. 25.

No doubt there are certain things in life in which we accomplish a greater purpose, and that can be accomplished by an inspiration from within. Art is a redm domain through which the3 inspira- tion has a great facility to manifest. In order to become spiritual it is not necessary that man should be very religious or extra good. In order to attain to inspiration, what is necessary is love for beauty. What is art? Art is a creation of beauty, in whatever form it be cre- ated. As long as an artist thinks that whatever he creates in the form of art, that l3 it is his own creation, and as long as the artist becomes vain over his creation, he has not learned the true art. For the true art can only come by one condition, and that condition is that the artist forgets himself. He forgets himself in the vision of beauty. And there is one condition when his art can be still more valuable, and that condition is when14 the artist begins to recognize15 divine in the art. As long as the artist has not real- ized it, he has not touched the perfection of art. The artist in the true sense of the word, is the king of a certain kingdom, which is even greater than the kingdom of the earth. There is a story known in the East, that Farabi was a great singer, a singer who was invited to the court of the Sultan. The Sultan received him very warmly in the court and as the singer entered, the Sultan went to the door to receive him. On coming in the drawing room, the Sultan asked the singer to take his seat. 'Where shall I sit?', said the singer. The Sultan said, 'Sit in any place that may be fitting to you.' On hearing this he took the seat of the king. No doubt, it aston- ished the Sultan very much, but after hearing his art he thought that even his own seat was not quite suitable. For the kingdom of the Sultan had a certain limitation, but the kingdom of the artist is everywhere, wherever beauty prevails. As beauty is everywhere, so the kingdom of the artist is everywhere. But art is only a door, a door through which one can enter in16 still a wider area. The religions have in17 different times considered art as some- thing outside, but this has been very often a kind of fanaticism on the part of religious authorities. And it is not only in the East, but l8it isl8 in the West and15 East l9 one finds a kind of idea existing to separate art from re- ligion.

No one who has touched the depth of relig- ion can ever deny the fact that religion itself is an art, an art which accomplishes the greatest thing in man's life, and2' that art, to be made void of beauty, +s there cannot be a greater error than that. In the first place we can see in the ancient times in all the Hindu and Buddhist churches and pagodas there was music, there was poetry, there was sculpture and there was painting. At the time when there were not printing presses, nor 22books be brought out on philosophy and re- ligion, if one can find an scriptures expressing the ancient religious and philosophical ideas, they2! can be found in the old24, ancient art. For in- stance the mysticism and the religion of ancient Egypt, of which so much has been spoken and so little has been known, if there is any sign of it to be found, it is not in a manuscript, it is in art. Besides, the ideas of the ancient Sanskrit age are yet to be found in India in engravings on the carved stones, rocks and temples. Very often the3 travellers of25 the Western world go to the East in order to see in how far the art had26 attained its perfection. But very few really know that it is not only 27the art that2' came to a cer- tain perfection, but the art which28 has been given as something to com- municate to those who can read. Besides that, the art of the3 ancient Greece, it is the sign and proof of their great perfection in divine wisdom. Every movement that29 in the Greek pictures 29you see29, it is not only a graceful movement, but it has a meaning, and ever little statue30 it3' de- Y; notes a great meaning, 32with a great meaning32 3only if33 a person can read it. But from this we come to learn that, in order to do34 the work of art, and in order to be able to understand the work of art, for both intuition is necessary. And it is the very thing that today15 human race seems to be losing more than in any time in the world's history. One might ask, 'What is the reason that man has lost that intuitive faculty?' 35~ecause man has become so absorbed in material gains, that he has so to speak become in- toxicated by the earthly life, and intuition, which is his birthright and his own property, he has lost to36 view. It does not mean that it has gone out from him, it only means that it has become buried in his own heart.

When the water of that little pool is troubled, you cannot see the reflection. But when it is not troubled, then it is quiet, then you can see, when the water is clear. So is the heart of man. By the heart I do not mean the piece of flesh. By heart I only42043 that inner being of man which very often in the Bible is called 'spirit'. It is the calmness and qui- etness of that spirit which quickens that tendency of inspiration. But when the mind is troubled by worries and anxieties and respon~ibilit~~~, then. naturally that intuition is lost. But man i.9 asks often tf-it-i.9, 'how can it be possible to leave out45 worries and troubles 450f life?' That is quite true, but at the same time if one is thinking that one cannot leave out the troubles and anxieties, 46if one 46, one is going further and further the truth, the truth which is the safety of man. Many think that13 if we cannot be spiritual, then we shall be material; of course then we shall be more and more material, because we cannot be spiritual. But really speak- ing the right thing would be to strike the happy medium. If life forces one to go in48 material things so much, so much the more necessary49 to go into spirituality. It matters very little what religion a person claims and what faith he says he has, what way of prayers he adopts. What really matters is if he is really religious from his heart. The admission to that field of happi- ness is by tickets. For at the door of the station, they do not ask you whose son you are, what class you belong to, what are your ancestors, how much money you have. What they ask is for the ticket, and the same thing is I bid.: uFrlends,\" omltted Ibld.: \"that\" instead of \"whow Ibid.: \"those riches which areN instead of \"that riches which ism Ibld.: \"themm instead of \"Itw Ibld.: \"1s intultlont* Instead of \"Intuition Is\" I bid.: \"onlyw omitted Sk.sh.: one word is missing; Hq.t.: \"meanm added Hq.t.: t*responslbillties~ Ibid.: mouttt placed before \"of lifew Sk.sh.: a blank after wonel*; Hq.t.: \"If one ,** omitted Ibid.: t*fromn instead of **oftr Ibld.: \"Intow lnstead of \"inw Ibid.: \"1s\" added, to which In Sk.hwr.

In that field of happiness one has no entrance by saying, 'I belong to a very high church', or 'my prayers are better than others150.' No, there it is not so, it is only here we hate one another by saying, 'You are of a dif- ferent religion, your belief is bad, my belief is good.' There is no distinction there. The question is if you are sincere. If you really are seeking after truth, then they do not ask what channel you are coming from. They open the door, you are allowed in. But now coming to the question that13, how can that art which is re- ligion be attained? Even a religion is a kind of art. Of course its elementary aspect makes it a religion of form. 510f course5! form is the outward art, whether it is a ceremony, a ritual, a form of service, it is a form of art, no doubt. But as one goes further, it is another art. Among the Sufis that art is called Akhlak Allah, which means the manner of God. That the first step in life is to know and understand how to become a human being. or^^ as there are two words, in15 English language, man and gentleman, and there is such a vast gulf between man and a gentleman. No doubt if one bought a nice dress and put it on, he can become a gentleman very soon, but this12 is not what I mean. A true gentleman the real sense of the word, 54what the word itself expresses. And what makes one gentle? Man by nature is just like an uncut diamond. And that diamond wants cutting in order to re- f lect its light fully. A man becomes a gentleman, not by becoming rich or55 a high position. No, when the rough edges of his character are cut, just like a diamond, then he becomes a gentleman. And if one judged oneself 56and not judges56 the others, one will find how very difficult it is to becomes a gentleman. Of course man keeps on in a kind of intoxication, not knowing his own faults. He is always busy finding fault with the others. Always he as complaining that the rough edges trouble him from the others and so the whole life goes, the life which is the greatest opportunity to rise and to become better. And that one who feels that after having the rough edges of the other hurt, 57who feels57 that, 'also58 the rough edges of my part must5' hurt the others.' ~nd~' when he begins to cut those rough edges, then he begins to learn the art. For other arts cannot be compared with the art of personality. The character is not born with man's birth, the character is built after coming here. But even a person can call himself as60 a human being, still he ha$ not yet known that greater art still, which may be right- fully called a true religion. For there is another grade to pursue, and that grade is the personality of Cod. As soon as one seeks for the personality of God, it is different from a human personality, for in the character of man, man has to make his point of view a human point of view. But in the point 50.
