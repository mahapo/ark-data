Itsinterpretation, then, requires a certain audacity. How can one begin to say whatGod “meant” by His revelation? How does one balance the praiseworthy desire tounderstand the meanings of the Qur1an with the realistic fear of reducing it to themerely human and individualistic? Is interpretation an art, a science, an inspiredact, or all of the these? Suficommentators living in the classical time period ofIslam from the tenth to the fifteenth centuries answered these questions in theirown unique way, based on their assumptions regarding the nature of the Qur1anictext, the sources of knowledge considered necessary for its interpretation, and thenature of the self seeking this knowledge. The commentaries they wrote aredistinct from other types of Qur1anic commentaries both in terms of content,which reflects Sufiideas and concepts, and the variety of styles ranging fromphilosophical musings to popular preaching to literary narrative and poetry.Early Western scholarship on SufiQur1anic interpretation focused on the ori-gins of Sufithought. In his Die Richtungen der islamischen Koranauslegung,Ignaz Goldziher characterized the Sufiapproach as eisegesis, the reading of one’sown ideas into a text.1Goldziher firmly believed that Sufithought is radically dif-ferent from “original, traditional Islam,”2finding little basis for their beliefs in theQur1an. Not surprisingly then, he viewed SufiQur1anic commentary as an attemptto reconcile these different belief systems and to justify the Sufiworldview withinan Islamic framework through the method of allegoresis. According to Goldziher,theSufis were influenced in this by Platonic thought which contrasts the world ofappearances with the world of Ideas, just as Sufiexegetes distinguish the exoteric(zahir) from the esoteric (batin) levels of meaning of the Qur1an. Although Sufisinsisted that they were uncovering deeper meanings of the Qur1an, Goldziherfound them reading ideas into a text essentially alien or even hostile to their sys-tem of thought.The conclusions of Goldziher regarding the sources of Sufithought were debatedby Louis Massignon, who attempted to show through an analysis of early Sufivocabulary that it was the Qur1an itself, constantly recited, meditated upon, andpracticed which was the origin and genuine source for the development of Sufism.3Paul Nwyia continued Massignon’s research, focusing particularly on the mystical1"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"commentary attributed to Ja2far al-Sadiq (d. 765). Nwyia concluded that Ja2faral-Sadiq’s commentary was the result of a dialogue between personal, mystic expe-rience, and the text of the Qur1an. The vocabulary found in this commentary marksthe beginning of the development of specific Sufiterminology that was not derivedfrom foreign ideas and concepts but rather was created to describe the dialogueoriginating from and remaining within a Qur1anic context.4Both Massignon andNwyia insisted that the Qur1anic text remains primary for the Sufi; that is to say,the Muslim mystic does not impose his own ideas on the Qur1anic text, but ratherdiscovers ideas in the course of his experiential dialogue with the text.5The term allegoresis used by Goldziher does not adequately convey the complexand varied use of metaphorical language in SufiQur1anic commentaries. Studiesby such scholars as Henry Corbin,6Toshihiko Izutsu7and William Chittick8onthe use of language in other types of Sufiwritings have shown the relationshipbetween symbolic and metaphorical language and the concept of imagination,understood not as fantasy, but as an objective reality of the mind and cosmos. Inhis study of the Dhakha1ir al-a2laqof Ibn 2Arabi(d. 1240), Chittick identifiesimagination as a concept referring to three different things: a faculty by whichhumans may obtain knowledge, just as they obtain knowledge from propheticrevelations and rational thought; an intermediate realm between the world of purespirit and the world of bodies, sometimes called the “world of images” (2alamal-mithal); and something that reflects the nature of the cosmos as a whole.9Thekind of language and discourse used in Sufiwritings may, then, appear tobe metaphorical while in fact being descriptive of experience in this intermediaterealm, or it may be truly metaphorical since language using imagery is consideredto be a better indicator of the nature of reality than abstract, rational thought.The issue of language is related to the problem of defining the nature andobjective of Sufiwritings. The possibility that Sufis are merely describing thereality that they see is rejected by those who consider their experiences a formof fantasy and their writings fictive compositions. In an article on the concept ofthe “world of images” (alam al-mithal) Fazlur Rahman rejects the ontologicalexistence of this realm and therefore criticizes the claim of some Sufis to mysti-cal experience within it; instead of descriptions of theophanies, he sees only anartistic impulse struggling to express itself.Once the flood of imagination is let loose, the world of figures goesbeyond the specifically religious motivation that historically brought itinto existence in the first place and develops into the poetic, the mythical,and the grotesque: it seeks to satisfy the relatively suppressed andstarved artistic urge. Much of the contents of the 2alam al-mithal[theworld of images], as it develops later, has, therefore, nothing to do withreligion but indirectly with theater.10Leonard Lewisohn, on the other hand, suggests that reading Sufiliterature with-out accepting the reality of mystical experience results in a distortion of theirINTRODUCTION2"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"writings. If one approaches Sufiworks from an aesthetic and literary perspectivealone, one will see only allegories instead of metaphysical referents which can onlybe grasped experientially. While the aesthetic and literary element of Sufiwritingsis undeniable, Lewisohn states that there is no “art for art’s sake in Sufiliterature.”11Hamid Dabashi has looked at the political dynamics behind Persian Sufipoetry, describing its development within the context of a competition for author-ity among jurists, philosophers, court politicians, and the Sufis. As Sufis beganwriting poetry, or when poets became Sufis, they became propagandists for theirmystical doctrines rather than poets first and foremost, subordinating the artisticimpulse to a mystical worldview. Like Lewisohn, he agrees that the artisticimpulse is secondary, but describes the phenomenon as an appropriation of art forother purposes.12Michael Sells views the interaction between these groups in adifferent way, as a creative clash of cultures. He suggests that the use of differentlanguage contexts by Sufis demonstrates a central aspect of classical Islamicculture, “the interpermeability and interfusion of discursive and culturalworlds.”13J.C. Bürgel notes the major role that Sufism played in allowing the artsto flourish in the Islamic world and suggests that this is because Sufitheoriesmade acts of creativity “licit magic,” while more orthodox Islam criticized andsometimes condemned poetry, representational art and music, seeing in theirpower an attempt to rival the creativity and power of God.14The objective of this book is to add to these previous discussions by studying therelationship of Sufis to the Qur1an more comprehensively. Understanding the natureof this relationship provides insight into the use of creative composition in othergenres adopted by the Sufis as well. Part I of the study concerns Sufihermeneutics,a word used here to refer to the way in which Sufis described the nature of theQur1anic text and the types of knowledge and methods needed to understand it. Theunique characteristics of Sufiinterpretation are further highlighted by means of ananalysis of the writings of those who criticized and defended it. Part II begins witha brief overview of the lives and exegetical works of the Suficommentators stud-ied for this work. Selections from their commentaries on the story of Musaandal-Khadir, the figure of Maryam, and the Light Verse will be presented in order todemonstrate common themes and different compositional styles.The most basic question addressed in these works, and the question from whichall other questions are derived, is how to best approach the Qur1an in order todiscover its richness and transforming possibilities. It is a question asked directly inthe hermeneutical writings and addressed indirectly in the commentaries themselves.Because interpretation is seen as an unending process which will be different foreach individual, Sufiinterpretations are more suggestive than declarative; they are“allusions” (isharat) rather than explanations (tafasir), to use the Arabic terms. Theytherefore indicate possibilities as much as they demonstrate the insights of eachwriter. The concept of imagination which plays such a prominent role in Ibn 2Arabi’sthought is less pronounced in the writings studied here. There is instead an empha-sis on the connection between knowledge granted directly from God (2ilm laduni)and the ethics and spiritual practice of the individuals seeking this knowledge. TheINTRODUCTION3"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"language and type of discourse chosen to express this knowledge varies with the dif-ferent commentators, and demonstrates the individuality of each. The interplay oflanguage worlds and discourses in classical Islam which Sells notes is very muchapparent here; many of these commentaries can only be understood within the con-text of discussions occurring within other areas of Islamic thought.The role of creativity in these writings is not a question that is addressed, prob-ably because the self is not viewed as the origin of this knowledge. This is not tosay, however, that the writers studied here are unaware of issues of style and com-position. On the contrary, these aesthetic matters are considered importantbecause the primary function of these works is didactic. The question of creativityis addressed somewhat indirectly through the justifications made for the highlyindividualistic nature of these interpretations, especially in the apologetic writingsof AbuHamid al-Ghazali(d. 1111).Much of the subject matter in this book could be productively compared tostudies on the interpretation of books considered sacred in other traditions as wellas contemporary hermeneutical and literary theories on reading texts. I have,however, deliberately avoided making these comparisons in order to keep thefocus on the complexity of the classical Islamic and Sufidiscussions on Qur1anicinterpretation. Western scholarship has only just begun to scratch the surface ofthe vast literature included within the genre of Qur1anic commentary; this studyrepresents only a small contribution towards what will hopefully be a greaterappreciation of the enormous variety of Islamic thought.A word should be said about the use of the terms SufiandSufism throughoutthis work. As Carl Ernst has pointed out, the Arabic equivalents to these words areterms used relatively infrequently in the writings we now label as Sufi. When theyare used in classical works, it is in a prescriptive rather this descriptive sense.15Inthe works studied here, the authors do not refer to themselves as Sufis but ratheras “the people of allusion and understanding” (ahl al-ishara wa’l-fahm), “the peo-ple of meanings” (ahl al-ma2ani), “the people of love” (ahl al-2ishq), “gnostics”(2arifun), “verifiers” (muhaqqiqun), and “the people of states” (ahl al-mawajid),to give just a few examples. However, despite the different terminology and writingstyles employed, these works share common hermeneutical assumptions andelements. The use of unifying terms to describe their approach, then, seemsappropriate and the words “Sufi” and “Sufism” are the logical choice in English,despite the problems outlined by Ernst.The translations in this work are my own unless otherwise noted. I have bene-fited greatly from the work of previous translators and the choice to use my owntranslation in many places is due to a concern for consistency in terminology ratherthan a criticism of the translations of my predecessors. The translations of theQur1an have been made after consulting the translations of Arberry, Ali, and Asad.I have taken the liberty of omitting the frequent phrases of blessings that occur inthese texts for the sake of brevity and clarity. The transliteration system used is thatofThe Encyclopedia of Islamwith the exception of jforjimandqforqaf.INTRODUCTION4"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Part IHERMENEUTICS"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"1THE QUR1AN AS THE OCEAN OF ALL KNOWLEDGESufiinterpretation begins with several basic premises: that the Qur1ancontains many levels of meaning, that man has the potential to uncover thesemeanings, and that the task of interpretation is endless. In their exegeticalwritings,Sufis quote such Qur1anic verses as We have left nothing out fromthe Book(6:38),We have counted everything in a clear register(36:12),There is nothing whose treasures are not with Us and We only send itdown in a known measure(15:21),1and, If all the trees on the earth were pensand the sea seven seas after it to replenish it, the words of God would notbe depleted(31:27).2The image of the Qur1an as an ocean is a particularlypopular one, as in this quote from the Jawahir al-Qur’anof AbuHamidal-Ghazali.I will rouse you from your sleep, you who have given yourself up torecitation, who have taken the study of the Qur1an as a practice, whohave seized upon some of its outward meanings and sentences. Howlong will you wander about the shore of the sea with your eyes closed toits wonders? Was it not for you to sail through its depths in order to seeits amazing things, to travel to its islands to pick its delicacies, to dive toits bottom and become rich from obtaining its jewels? Don’t you despiseyourself for losing out on its pearls and jewels as you continue to lookonly to its shores and exoteric aspects?Haven’t you heard that the Qur1an is an ocean from which theknowledge of all ages branches out just as rivers and streams branch outfrom the shores of the ocean? Don’t you envy the happiness of peoplewho have plunged into its overflowing waves and seized red sulfur,3whohave dived into its depths and taken out red rubies, shining pearlsand green chrysolite, who have roamed its shores and gathered grayambergris and fresh blooming aloes wood, who have clung to its islandsand found an abundance in their animals of the greatest antidote andpungent musk?47"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"HERMENEUTICS8A similar passage can be found in the introduction to the Qur1anic commentaryof2Abd al-Razzaq al-Kashani(d. 1329):Their souls are purified by [the Qur1an’s] exoteric sense (zahir) becauseit is water which flows copiously and the thirst of their hearts isquenched by its inner sense (batin) because it is a surging sea. Whenthey wish to dive in order to extract the pearls of its secrets the watercrashes over them and they are submerged in its current. The riverbedsof insights (fuhum) flow from this deluge according to their capacities,while the streams of realizations (2uqul) proceed from its rivers. Theriverbeds bring forth piercing jewels and pearls upon the shores andthe streams cause flowers and fruit to bloom upon the banks. Hearts takefrom the overflow as much as they can, filling their laps and sleeves,while souls set out to harvest the fruits and lights, grateful for findingthem, their desires fulfilled by them.5The idea that there are exoteric (zahir) and inner (batin) senses of the Qur1an waswell developed by Sufis before al-Kashani. Although the division of the exotericand the inner has its basis in the Qur1an,6its importance in hermeneutical discus-sions is more closely tied to a hadithattributed to 2Abd Allah b. Mas2ud (d. 652).Thehadithof Ibn Mas2udThehadithof Ibn Mas2ud is the hadithmost frequently quoted by the Sufis asproof of the many dimensions of the Qur1an open to interpretation. Commentatorswho were not Sufis, such as AbuJa2far al-Tabari(d. 923),7quoted it as well butthey understood it in a different way. Here is al-Tabari’s version of the hadithfrom the introduction to his Qur1anic commentary, Jami2al-bayan:The messenger of God said, “The Qur1an was sent down in seven ahruf.Eachharfhas a back (zahr) and and belly (batn). Each harfhas a border(hadd) and each border has a lookout point (muttala2).”8Al-Tabariincludes this hadithamong several other ahadithabout the seven ahruf,devoting several pages to the controversy over the meaning of the word “harf(pl.ahruf)” and concluding that the seven ahrufrefer to both dialects (alsun) ofthe Arabs and aspects (awjuh) of the revelation.9The meaning of this particularTradition, according to al-Tabariis as follows:“Eachharfhas a border (hadd)” means that each of the seven aspects(awjuh) has a border delimited by God which no one may go past. As forhis words “and each harfhas a back (zahr) and a belly (batn),” its back(zahr) is that which becomes apparent (zahir) in recitation and its belly(batn) is its interpretation (ta1wil) which is hidden (batana). His words,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"“and each of the borders has a lookout point (muttala2)” means that eachof the borders in which God has delineated the permitted and prohibitedand the rest of His revealed laws has a measure of the rewards and pun-ishments of God which will be seen and beheld in the Hereafter and metat the Resurrection, just as 2Umar b. al-Khattab10said, “If everything inthe world belonged to me, assuredly I would ransom myself with itagainst the terror of the lookout point (muttala2).”11For al-Tabari, the inner sense (batin) refers to events in the future, knowledge ofwhich is not given to man until the Day of Resurrection. The word ta1wilhasdifferent meanings in the Qur1an; al-Tabariseems to use it here in its sense of theunfolding of events, not interpretation.12Roughly contemporary with al-Tabari, the Sufiinterpretation of Sahl al-Tustari(d. 896) gives us a reading of this hadiththat is different in two importantrespects. The first is in its designating knowledge of the external sense (zahir) aspublic (2amm) and knowledge of the inner sense (batin) as private (khass). Thesecond difference is in the interpretation of the lookout point (muttala2). Using thetradition from 2Umar, al-Tabariunderstands this as a terrifying vantage point onthe Day of Resurrection. Al-Tustari, on the other hand, understands the muttala2as a vantage point of the heart, an overview from which one can understand whatGod meant by certain verses of the Qur1an while still in this life.Every verse of the Qur1an has four kinds of meanings: an exotericsense (zahir), an inner sense (batin), a limit (hadd), and a lookout point(muttala2). The exoteric sense is the recitation, the inner sense is under-standing (fahm), the limit is what [the verse] permits and prohibits, andthe lookout point is the elevated places of the heart (qalb) [beholding]what was intended by it as understood from God Almighty. The knowl-edge of the exoteric sense is public knowledge (2ilm2amm) and the under-standing of its inner sense and what was intended by it is private (khass).13Al-Tustaridoes not specify in this passage as to exactly who possesses this publicand private knowledge. Throughout his tafsir, he uses the terms “elect” (khusus)and common people (2umum) without saying what he means by this distinction.14AbuTalib al-Makki(d. 998), writing about a hundred years after al-TustariinhisQut al-qulub, interprets the hadithin much the same way as al-Tustari, addingdetails regarding exoteric and esoteric knowledge, and confirming the view thatthe lookout point (muttala2) refers to a vantage point attainable in this life. Heseems to reference the saying of 2Umar found in al-Tabari, but manages to softenits frightening aspect by a play on words:Its back (zahr) is for experts in the Arabic language (ahl al-2arabiyya),its inner sense (batin) is for the people of certainty (ahl al-yaqin), itslimit (hadd) is for the exotericists (ahl al-zahir), and its lookout pointTHE QUR1AN AS THE OCEAN OF ALL KNOWLEDGE9"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"(muttala2) is for the people of elevated places (ahl al-ashraf) who are thegnostics (2arifun), loving and fearing; they have beheld (ittala2u)the kindness of the One who looks down (muttali2) after having fearedthe terror of the lookout point (muttala2).15Al-Ghazalimentions the Ibn Mas2udhadithin his defense of Sufiexegesis inhisIhya1 2ulum al-din. His use of the hadithis part of a more combative styleintended to rebut religious scholars who believe that Qur1anic commentary shouldbe based entirely on the transmitted traditions of the Companions and theFollowers of the Prophet. Al-Ghazali’s challenges them to explain the meaning ofthe Ibn Mas2udhadithif exegesis is to be so restricted. He bluntly states that “theone who claims that the Qur1an has no other meaning than what exoteric exegesis(zahir al-tafsir) has explained (tarjama), should know that he has acknowledgedhis own limitations and therefore is right with regards to himself, but is wrong inan opinion which brings everyone else down to his level.”16But al-Ghazaliis rather unique in his desire to engage with the opponents ofSufism head-on. The approach of Ruzbihan al-Baqli(d. 1209) in his Qur1aniccommentary 2Ara1is al-bayanis more typical. He writes for his fellow Sufisalone, describing the division between exotericists and Sufis as part of God’s planin Creation:Then he gave the external reins of [the Qur1an] to the hands of the exo-tericists (ahl al-zahir) among the scholars (2ulama1) and the wise(hukama1) so that they introduce its precepts, limits, regulations, andlaws, and He reserved the unseen of the secrets of His speech and thehidden subtleties of His signs for the best of His people. He disclosedHimself in His words by the attribute of unveiling (kashf), eyewitness-ing (2iyan), and explanation (bayan) to their hearts (qulub), spirits(arwah), intellects (2uqul), and innermost secrets (asrar).He taught them the sciences of His realities (haqa1iq)and thephenomena of His intricacies (daqa1iq). He purified the degrees of theirintellects by the unveiling of the lights of his Beauty. He sanctified theirunderstandings by the splendor of His Majesty. He made them the placesfor the hidden deposits of the symbols (rumuz) of His speech, the obscu-rities of His secrets deposited in His Book, the subtlety of His allusions(isharat) to the sciences of the ambiguous verses (mutashabihat) and[other] difficulties of the verses. He Himself informed them of themeanings of that which He hid in the Qur1an so that they would come toknow by means of His causing them to know. He anointed their eyes bythe light of His nearness and communion. He showed them the unseenmysteries of the brides of different kinds of wisdom and knowledge, andthe meanings of the innermost understanding and innermost secret, theexoteric sense (zahir)of which is a fundamental principle (hukm) in theQur1an and inner sense (batin) of which is an allusion (ishara) andHERMENEUTICS10"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"unveiling (kashf) which God (al-haqq) reserves for His purified onesand His greater friends (awliya1) and His exiled beloved among thesincere and close companions (muqarrabun).He veiled these secrets and marvels from others, those among thescholars of the external sense (2ulama1al-zahir) and the exotericists (ahl-rusum) who have an abundant portion of the abrogating and theabrogated, and the comprehension and knowledge of the permitted andprohibited, the limits and rules.17AlthoughSufis in this time period used the term “exotericists” (ahl al-zahirorahl al-rusum), they did not call themselves “esotericists” (batiniyya) since thiswas a derogatory term applied to those who rejected the literal sense of the Qur1anand the exoteric practices of Islam, especially the Isma2ilis. None of the Sufisstudied here rejected the external aspects of practice and knowledge, but ratherconsidered these the necessary prerequisites for proceeding with the inwardaspects.Nizam al-Din al Nisaburi(d. 1327) echoes the thoughts of Ruzbihan inhis interpretation of the Ibn Mas2udhadith, found in the introduction to hisQur1anic commentary entitled Ghara1ib al-Qur1an wa ragha1ib al-furqan.He writes that the exoteric sense (zahir) of the Qur1an is what scholars(2ulama1) know, and the inner sense (batin) is what is hidden from them, andhe adds, “and we speak of it as we have been commanded and entrust theknowledge of it to God most High.”18Al-Nisaburiprovides both exoteric and eso-teric definitions for the word muttala2. The first repeats the tradition of 2Umarfound in al-Tabariregarding the lookout point on the Day of Resurrection. Thesecond definition confirms theSufibelief in the possibility of acquiring thisvision in the here and now. The muttala2is “the point of ascent (mas2ad), a placeto which one arrives where one understands [a thing] as it is (yafhamu kamahuwa).”19Al-Kashani’s commentary on the hadithinterprets the back (zahr)and the belly(batn) as exoteric exegesis (tafsir) and esoteric interpretation (ta1wil). He under-stands the limit (hadd) as the place “where understandings of the meaning of thewords end” and the lookout point (muttala2) as the place to which one rises upfrom the limit and “beholds (yattali2u) the witnessing of the all-knowing King.”20In all of these interpretations of the Ibn Mas2udhadith, the division of theQur1an is basically twofold, exoteric and esoteric. The exoteric is the externalsense (zahr) and the commands and prohibitions that constitute the limit (hadd).The esoteric is the inner sense (batn)and the gnostic’s lookout point (muttala2).In2Ala1al-Dawla al-Simnani(d. 1336), this twofold sense is expanded into afour-fold hierarchical interpretative process:O seeker of the inner meaning of the Qur1an! You should first study theliteral level of the Qur1an and bring your body into harmony with itscommands and prohibitions. Secondly, you should occupy yourself withTHE QUR1AN AS THE OCEAN OF ALL KNOWLEDGE11"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"purifying your inner being so that you may comprehend the hiddenmeaning (batn) of the Qur1an according to the instruction of the MercifulOne and the inspiration of the Holy Angel. Thirdly, you should contemplatethe gnosis of its limit (hadd) in the realm of hearts. [Only then] will yoube distinguished with witnessing its point of ascent (muttala2) withoutthought or reckoning.21According to al-Simnani, the source of interpretation varies according to thesefour different levels of the Qur1an:The commentator on the exoteric dimension of the Qur1an should relyexclusively upon his external sense of hearing through which he learnedthe verses himself. The mystic should rely on inspiration (ilham) to com-ment on the esoteric dimension, while the accomplished Sufi who hastruly declared the unity of God should only comment on the limit withdivine permission. The individual who has attained the secret of theessence should not comment at all, but proceed in a faltering mannerinto the point of ascent of the Qur1an.22Al-Simnanirelates the four levels of meaning to four realms of existence: theHuman Realm (nasut), the Kingdom (malakut), the Omnipotence (jabarut), andthe Divinity (lahut).23Sayings from 2Aliand Ja2far al-SadiqIn addition to the Ibn Mas2udhadith, the Sufis found validation for their belief inthe existence of deeper, discoverable meanings in the Qur1an in sayings attributedto2Ali(d.661) and Ja2far al-Sadiq (d. 765), important figures for both Sufis andShi2is.24The first of the sayings attributed to 2Aliquoted below echoes the hadithof Ibn Mas2ud:Every verse of the Qur1an has four kinds of meaning: an exotericsense (zahir), an inner sense (batin), a limit (hadd), and a lookout point(muttala2). The exoteric sense is the recitation (tilawa), the inner sense isunderstanding (fahm), the limit (hadd)is the rulings of what is permit-ted and prohibited, and the lookout point (muttala2) is what is meant byGod for the servant by [the verse]. It is said that the Qur1an is a clearexpression (2ibara), an allusion (ishara), subtleties (lata1if) and realities(haqa1iq), so that the clear expression is for hearing, the allusion is forthe intellect (2aql), the subtleties are for witnessing (mushahada) and therealities are for self-surrender (istislam).25There is no good in an act of worship without comprehension, nor ina recitation without pondering.26HERMENEUTICS12"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Messenger of God (peace and blessings of God be upon him), didnot confide anything in me which he concealed from people, except thatGod most High gives a servant understanding of His Book.27If I had wished, I could have loaded seventy camels with commentary(tafsir) on the Fatihaof the Book (the opening sura).28For the one who understands (yafhamu) the Qur1an, thereby wholebodies of knowledge are explained (fussira).29Those attributed to Ja2far al-Sadiq are:The Qur1an is recited with nine aspects (awjuh): the Truth (haqq), truth(haqiqa), realization (tahqiq), realities (haqa1iq), oaths, contracts, limits,the cutting off of attachments, and the exaltation of the One who isworshipped.30The Qur1an was sent down in seven modes (anwa2): to inform, entrust,awaken affection, ennoble, unite, frighten and restrain.

A key verse here is Qur1an 3:7 because itaddresses the problems in interpreting a text that is both clear and ambiguous.He it is who sent down to you the book containing clear verses(ayatmuhkamat)which are the mother of the Book and others that are ambigu-ous or similar(mutashabihat).As for those in whose hearts is a turningaway, they follow what is ambiguous or similar(mutashabih)in it, seekingdiscord and seeking its interpretation(ta1wil)but none knows its interpre-tation except God.

The muhka-matverses constitute the basic message necessary for salvation addressed to allmankind while the mutashabihatare addressed to an elect group of individuals;the Qur1anic text is designed both to reveal and conceal, to communicate bothsimply and profoundly. This concept is described in the Qur1anic commentaryof the SufiAbu’l-Qasim al-Qushayri(d. 1074). Al-Qushayri, always liberal in theuse of metaphor in his writing, appears here to be using the literal meanings of thewords “revelation” (tanzil) and “interpretation” (ta1wil) to evoke an image ofsomething that descends with ease but is brought back up with great difficulty.He has classified the discourse for them. From its apparent sense (zahir),there is the clarity of its revelation (lit., “its being sent down,”tanzilihi)and from its obscure sense (ghamid), there is the problem of its inter-pretation (lit., “its being brought back,”ta1wilihi). The first kind is forthe purpose of unfolding the law and guiding the people of the outwardlymanifest (ahl al-zahir). The second kind is for the purpose of protectingsecrets (asrar) from the examination of outsiders.4The Persian Qur1anic commentator Rashid al-Din al-Maybudi(fl. 1135) usedal-Qushayri’s commentary as a source for his own, incorporating and expandingon his work in a decidedly literary manner. In this section of his Kashf al-asrar,al-Maybudidevelops al-Qushayri’s suggestion that the obscurity in the Qur1an isintentional, adding a short poem that taunts those who would undertake the searchfor deeper meanings casually:There are two exalted parts to the Qur1an. One of them is the clearapparent sense (zahir-i rawshan) and one is the difficult obscure sense(ghamid-i mushkil). This apparent sense is the majesty of the law(shari2at) and that obscure sense is the beauty of reality (haqiqat). Thisapparent sense is so that the masses (2amma) of mankind might under-stand and practice this in order to reach the comfort (naz) and blessing.That obscure sense is so that the elite (khawass) of mankind mightsubmit to and accept that, in order to reach the blessing of the secret(raz) of the friend.

Because of the grandeur of that state and the nobility ofthat work, the veil of obscurity (ghumud) and ambiguity (tashabuh) isnot removed, so that not just any stranger could set foot in that quarter,since not everyone is worthy of the tale of the secrets of kings.Do not stroll around the royal curtain of secrets!What can you do since you are not a man?A real man ought to be peerless in each of the two worldssince he drinks the last drops of the draught of friends.5By creating a series of corresponding polarities here, the muhkamatand themutashabihatof the Qur1anic text, the masses (2amma) and the elite (khawass),the law (shari2a) and the reality (haqiqa), God’s Majesty and Beauty; al-Maybudiconnects the structure of the Qur1an to that of mankind and the cosmos.This linking of the structure of the Qur1anic text to the nature of existence canalso be seen in the commentary of Ruzbihan al-Baqli. For Ruzbihan, the muhka-matare those verses that cannot be altered from how they were in pre-eternity.These are verses for believers that contain the practical application of thecommandments, functioning like medicine for the sick in healing mankindand strengthening faith. They provide all that is necessary for man’s salvation.Themutashabihat, on the other hand, give information, to the few who are pre-pared to receive it, about the mysterious way in which God manifests Himself inHis creation.Themutashabihatare descriptions of the ambiguous wrapping (iltibas)of the Attributes (sifat) and the manifestation (zuhur) of the Essence(dhat) in the mirror of witnessings (shawahid) and signs (ayat).6Iltibasis a term found frequently in Ruzbihan’s writings. It is a verbal nounderived from the Arabic root lbs. Two first form verbs from this root occur in theQur1an:labisa, which means to wear something or to clothe someone, and labasa,which means to confuse. The eighth form of the verb, iltabasa(verbal noun:iltibas), means “to become entangled” or “to become confused.”7Ruzbihan usesthe word to refer to the process by which God “clothes” His messages in formsthat can be confusing or ambiguous to people.8Themutashabihatare examplesof these kinds of messages.Another way to express the concept of iltibasis to speak of unity and multiplic-ity, the terminology that 2Abd al-Razzaq al-Kashaniuses in his comments on Qur1an3:7. Without specifically identifying it, al-Kashanirefers to Ibn al-Zubayr’s inter-pretation before expanding it to include Sufimetaphysical ideas and terminology:Potentiality of meaning and ambiguity cannot touch [the muhkamat];they convey only one meaning. They are the mother, i.e. the root (asl) ofHERMENEUTICS16"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"the Book. And others that are mutashabihat. They convey two meaningsor more, and the truth and falsehood are ambiguous (yashtabihu) inthem. That is because the Truth (haqq) has one face, which is the absoluteabiding face after the annihilation of creation, not admitting multiplicityor plurality. He also has multiple additional faces in accordance with themirrors of the loci of manifestation (mazahir). [These faces] are whatbecome manifest from that one face according to the preparedness(isti2dad) of each locus of manifestation. The truth and falsehood areambiguous in them. The revelation appeared in this manner so that themutashabihatwould turn towards the faces of the different forms ofpreparedness (isti2dadat). So everyone clings to that which is appropri-ate to it, and the test and trial thereby become manifest.9When al-Kashanispeaks of loci of manifestation (mazahir), he is employingone of the terms initiated by Ibn 2Arabito explain the nature of existence. God isOne both in His Essence and His attribute as the Manifest, while the loci withinwhich He manifests are qualified by multiplicity. “Preparedness” (isti2dad) is theterm he uses to describe the receptivity of individually created things and beingsto the manifestation of God, each becoming a locus of manifestation according toits innate capacity.10Although the terminology of al-Kashaniand Ruzbihan aredifferent, the basic concept is the same, that God created the world in such a waythat truth and falsehood intermingle in an ambiguous way. Like al-Qushayriandal-Maybudi, they distinguish between the muhkamatverses that send a messageto all mankind and the mutashabihatverses that are addressed to a few. Theelitism here is not unique to Sufis but how the elite are defined is, as we shallsee in the following section.Those in whose hearts is a turning away and those who are firmly rooted in knowledge (al-rasikhun fi1l-2ilm)Qur1an 3:7 describes two ways in which mankind responds to the ambiguousverses (mutashabihat) in the Qur1an. Those in whose hearts there is a turningawaytry to create discord by means of these verses, whereas those who are firmlyrooted in knowledge(al-rasikhun fi1l-2ilm) have faith in God’s message as a uni-fied whole. This part of the verse provoked extensive discussions in Qur1anic exe-gesis concerning what constitutes sound interpretative methodology. The answerdepends on how the mutashabihatare defined. If the mutashabihatare taken torefer to those events known only to God, such as future events, then those firmlyrooted in knowledge(al-rasikhun fi1l-2ilm) leave their interpretation to God.11This is al-Tabari’s preferred interpretation and the one which produces the clear-est statement regarding the role of the interpreter. By narrowing the definition ofthemutashabihatto the verses of disconnected letters and the verses having to dowith future events, al-Tabarinarrows the area of the unknowable in the Qur1an,thereby emphasizing its clarity.THE QUR1ANIC TEXT AND AMBIGUITY17"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"all of the verses of the Qur1an that God revealed to His Messenger wererevealed as a clear explanation (bayan) to him and his community andguidance to the worlds. It is not possible that anything could be includedin it that they did not need, or anything that they did need but had no wayof knowing by interpretation.Since this is so, mankind has a need for everything in the Qur1an eventhough there are some meanings they can do without and many mean-ings that they very much need. This is like when God says, on a daywhen some of the signs of your Lord will come, no soul will benefit if ithas not already believed or earned something good by means of its faith(6:158). The prophet taught his community that the sign that God speaksof in this verse...is the rising of the sun from the west. What theworshippers needed to know was the time period in which repentancewould benefit them without restricting it to years, months, or days. Godexplained this for them by means of the Book and clarified it for themby means of His messenger acting as an exegete (mufassir). They did notneed to know the length of time between the revelation of this verse andthe appearance of this sign. They had no need of knowing it for their reli-gion or present life. It is knowledge that God has reserved for Himselfexclusively and not His creation, and He has veiled it from them.12Themuhkamatconsist of everything except the verses having to do with thefuture events and disconnected letters. Although these mukhamatverses couldbe interpreted in various ways, their intended meaning has been made clear else-where in the Qur1an or in the explanations of the Prophet. The role of the religiousscholar (2alim) is merely to present this intended meaning.If the mutashabihatare as we have described, everything else is muhkambyvirtue of its having only one meaning and one interpretation. No one hear-ing it would need any explanations for it. Or, it is clear despite its possess-ing many aspects and interpretations and the possibility of many meaningsbecause there exists an indication to its intended meaning either through anexplanation by God Himself or an explanation by His Messenger to hiscommunity. The knowledge of the religious scholars (2ulama1) in the com-munity will not go beyond that because of what we have explained here.13In keeping with his narrow definition of what constitutes the mutashabihat,al-Tabariprefers the reading of the verse that limits knowledge of the interpreta-tion (ta1wil) of the mutashabihatto God alone, although he presents views fromthe Companions and Followers of the Prophet supporting the other reading aswell. Because the verses with disconnected letters and those relating to futureevents make up a relatively small portion of the Qur1anic text, al-Tabari’s pre-ferred interpretation retains a broad role for the religious scholar in interpretation,since in this definition the muhkamatconstitute the majority of the Qur1an.HERMENEUTICS18"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"However, if the mutashabihatare taken to refer to verses that can be interpretedin more than one way, then those who are firmly rooted in knowledge (al-rasikhunfi’l-2ilm) are those who know how to interpret them in light of the muhkamat.Al-Tabariquotes Ibn al-Zubayr as saying,Then they refer the interpretation of the mutashabihato what they knowof the interpretation of the muhkamathat admit only one interpretation.The book is thereby harmonized by what they say, one part confirminganother. By means of it, the proof (hujja) is established, victory appears,falsehood departs and infidelity is refuted.14As for those in whose hearts is a turning away, they do the opposite, finding themeaning they want in the ambiguous verses, even when this meaning contradictsthe clear verses.15The Mu2tazilicommentator al-Zamakhshari(d. 1144)16gives examples of howthis methodology works in his Kashshaf2anhaqa1iq al-tanzil, applying it to sup-port Mu2taziliviews denying the possibility of seeing God and affirming man’sabsolute free will. According to al-Zamakhshari, the Qur1anic verse Vision cannotencompass Him(6:103) is the muhkamverse to which the mutashabihversegazing at their Lord(75:23) must be referred. The first verse is to be understoodliterally while the second must be interpreted in light of the literal truth of thefirst. Likewise, the muhkamverse God does not command what is shameful(7:28) makes sense of the mutashabihverse When We intend to destroy a town,We command those who live easy lives in it, and they act sinfully (17:16), whichotherwise would seem to suggest that God commands some people to sin.17The problem with this interpretative methodology is that one person’smuhkamverse is easily another’smutashabihand vice versa. In the process, the potentialexists for undermining the very message of the Qur1an, a danger noted by thetheologian Fakhr al-Din al-Razi(d. 1210)18in his Al-Tafsir al-kabir:Know that among the apostates there is one who has attacked the Qur1anbecause of its inclusion of the mutashabihat. He said, “You say thatthe duties which mankind has been charged with are connected tothis Qur1an until the Coming of the Hour. Yet we see that [the disagree-ment over the mutashabihat] reaches the point where each follower ofa school of thought clings to it according to his own school, so thatthe Jabarite [determinist] clings to the verses of compulsion such asWe have placed veils upon their hearts lest they understand it, and heav-iness in their ears (6:25, 17:46, 18:57). The Qadarite [proponent of freewill] says, “no, this is the school of infidels,” indicating that God relatedthis about the infidels when blaming them, saying, They say our heartsare veiled from what you call us to and in our ears is a heaviness(41:5)and in another place, they say, “our hearts are enclosed in a covering”(2:88, 4:155).THE QUR1ANIC TEXT AND AMBIGUITY19"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Similarly, the one who affirms the beatific vision clings to His wordson that day faces will be radiant, gazing towards their Lord(75:22–3)and the denier clings to Vision cannot encompass Him(6:103). The onewho affirms that God has direction clings to His words they fear theirLord above them(16:50) and His words the Merciful sat upon the throne(20:5), while the denier clings to His words there is nothing likeHim(42:11).Then each one calls the verse that agrees with his school muhkamandthe verses which disagree with his school mutashabih. Maybe thesituation of preferring one verse over another derives from covertpreference and weak positions. So how can it be fitting for the Wise tohave made the Book that is the reference point for all of the religion untilthe Coming of the Hour thus? Wouldn’t the objective be more likelyattained if He had made it conspicuously evident and free of thesemutashabihat?19After quoting this provocative question al-Raziprovides several possibleanswers. He tells us that there are many religious scholars who believe that thedifficulties of the mutashabihatincrease the reward for those who struggle todiscover the truth, forcing them to exercise their minds, and freeing them fromignorance and uncritical faith (taqlid). These verses also cause one to learn themethods of interpretation (ta1wilat) and preferring one (verse) over another (tarjihba2diha2alaba2d). The strongest benefit, according to al-Razi, is that these versesfacilitate comprehension of the more difficult aspects of God’s attributes andactions for those with the capacity for such comprehension, while at the sametime not confusing those for whom simple explanations are best.20Despite the dangers al-Razioutlines for the interpretative method of preferringone (verse) over another (tarjihba2diha2alaba2d), he nonetheless accepts itsvalidity and necessity, and attempts to establish guidelines for how this is to bedone. Simply put, any expression in the Qur1an that can be interpreted in morethan one way must be interpreted by its more probable meaning (rajih) unlessthere is a clear-cut indicator (dalil munfasil) that demonstrates the absurdity ofthe apparent sense (zahir). According to al-Razi, this clear-cut indicator (dalilmunfasil) can be either linguistic (lafzi) or rational (2aqli). However, even thougha definitive rational indicator can demonstrate the absurdity of the probablemeaning, the intended meaning remains a matter of conjecture (zann). Guessingis permissible only for legal matters where action is required, not for the funda-mentals of faith.21An example of the kinds of expressions al-Razimeans here are the anthropo-morphic descriptions of God in the Qur1an in verses such as The Merciful satupon His throne (20:5). According to al-Razi, anthropomorphists (mushabbiha)seek to validate their beliefs with the apparent sense (zahir) of this verse, eventhough it has been clearly established by reason (thabata bi sarihal-2aql) that Godcannot be characterized as confined in space. The anthropomorphists, then, areHERMENEUTICS20"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"amongthose in whose hearts there is a turning awaybecause they try to supporttheir false ideas by claiming that an ambiguous verse is a clear verse.22The interpreter’s task, in al-Razi’s opinion, is to correctly identify which versesare the clear verses and which are the ambiguous verses, working as “impartialverifiers” (muhaqqiqun munsifun) rather than proclaiming the verses that agreewith their school of thought muhkamatand the verses which disagree with thesamemutashabihat. When it can be shown definitively that the apparent sense ofa verse is impossible, the sound interpreter knows that what is intended is a figu-rative expression (majaz) for its reality (haqiqa). However, figurative expressionsare capable of many meanings and the preference of one over another can only bea linguistic preference. Since this is not definitive proof, it is not permissible.Accordingly, when those who are firmly rooted in knowledge(al-rasikhun fi’l-2ilm)andthose who possess understanding(ulual-albab) see something ambiguous inthe Qur1an, they accept that it has a sound meaning with God and believe in itwithout knowing its exact meaning. Al-Razi, then, prefers the reading of thisverse that stops after and no one knows its interpretation except God.23However,far from belittling the role of the commentator, al-Raziunderstands this verse aspraise for those who do exegesis correctly.This verse indicates the grandeur of the situation of the theologians(mutakallimun) who search for rational indicators (al-dala1il al-2aqliyya)and by means of them seek knowledge of the essence, qualities, and actsof God.24Al-Raziis following the views of his fellow Ash2arial-Ghazalihere, who makesthree recommendations in his Qanun al-ta1wilfor dealing with verses whoseliteral meaning seems to contradict knowledge obtained by the intellect(ma2qul). The first is not to aspire to fully know the meaning of these verses. Thesecond is to accept that interpretation is unavoidable because reason does not lie.The third recommendation is to refrain from specifying an interpretation whenthe [various] possibilities [of interpretation] are incompatible.25The best recourseis to say,I know that its literal meaning is not what is intended, because it containswhat is contrary to reason. What exactly is intended, however, I do notknow, nor do I have a need to know, since it is not related to any action,and there is no way truly to uncover [its meaning] with certainty.Moreover, I do not believe in making judgements by guessing...Thismeans that one should say, “We believe therein; the whole is from ourLord” (3:7).26Others, such as Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328),27a fierce critic of the writings ofal-Ghazaliand al-Razi, asserted that the literal sense of the Qur1anic text mustnever be abandoned, whether that abandonment is through interpretation (ta1wil)THE QUR1ANIC TEXT AND AMBIGUITY21"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"or through entrusting its meaning to God (tafwid). Ibn Taymiyya’s insistence uponstaying with the literal sense was not a rejection of the use of reason, but rather wasbased on the claim that true reason will never be in contradiction with the Qur1anand sound ahadith.28He defines his own methodology of sound interpretation basedentirely on these sources, a methodology which we will examine in Chapter 5.Although al-Ghazalilimits the role of reason in his Qanun al-ta1wiland thepermissibility of interpreting the mutashabihat, he makes a significant exceptionto this rule in a book written towards the end of his life, Iljam al-2awamm2an2ilmal-kalam.The book addresses the problem of traditions attributed to the first gen-erations of Muslims (salaf) that appear to interpret anthropomorphic descriptionsof God in the Qur1an literally. Al-Ghazalinot only denies that the salafever inter-preted these passages literally, but also claims that they established guidelinesdetailing how the general public (2awamm) should understand them. According toal-Ghazali, the general public should avoid literal interpretations of anthropo-morphic verses of the Qur1an while, at the same time, avoiding any attempt tounderstand their true, non-literal meanings. They should avoid paraphrasing thetext or engaging in theological proofs and arguments regarding them. Instead,they should accept that these verses do have a meaning that is fitting to God, buta meaning that can only be understood by the Prophet, his leading Companions,saints (awliya1), and those firmly rooted in knowledge(al-rasihkun fi’l-2ilm). Themutashabihat, then, are primarily addressed to an elite.If you were to say, “What is the benefit in speaking to mankind aboutsomething which they do not understand?” Your answer is that the goalof this speaking is to facilitate the understanding of those who areworthy of it: the saints (awliya1) and those firmly rooted in knowledge(al-rasihkun fi’l-2ilm).29Important here is the definition that al-Ghazaliprovides for what he means bythe general public (2awamm) on the one hand, and the saints and those firmlyrooted in knowledgeon the other. He includes in the first category the litterateur(adib), the grammarian, the hadithspecialist (muhaddith), the exegete (mufassir),the jurist, and the theologian (mutakallim). None of these people should attemptinterpretations (ta1wilat), nor act freely with the external sense of the words (al-tasarruf fikhilal al-zawahir) of the Qur1an or traditions. Al-Ghazaliwarnsthat it is prohibited (haram) to plunge into the sea if you are not a good swimmer,and the sea of gnosis (ma2rifa) of God is far more dangerous than the sea of water.Those who are permitted to interpret the difficult passages of the Qur1an arethose who devote themselves exclusively to learning to swim in the seasof religious gnosis (ma2rifa); who restrict their lives to Him alone; whoturn their faces from this world and the appetites; who turn their backson money and fame, mankind, and all other pleasures; who devote them-selves to God in the different types of knowledge and actions; who actHERMENEUTICS22"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"in accordance with all the ordinances of the religious law and its courtesies(adab) in performing the obediences and avoiding the objectionable;who have emptied out their hearts from everything except God; whodespise the world and even the Hereafter and the Highest Paradise nextto love of God. They are the divers in the sea of gnosis.30In shifting to metaphorical language, al-Ghazalisignals his shift from theolo-gian to Sufi. The only people qualified to interpret the mutashabihat, after theProphet and some of his immediate followers, are the Sufis, and their methodologyis that of Sufipractice.Al-Ghazalifrequently functions, as he does here, as an apologist for Sufism,and we will examine some of his many attempts to defend SufiQur1anic inter-pretation in more detail later. For now, however, we will move on to what otherSufis have to say in less apologetic works about how those firmly rooted in knowl-edgeapproach the mutashabihatof the Qur1an. The echoes of the discussions wehave seen so far regarding verse 3:7 can be heard in these works, but take secondplace to the claim that there are some who receive knowledge directly from Godconcerning the ambiguous passages of the Qur1an. Here is what al-Qushayrihasto say about those firmly rooted in knowledge (al-rasikhun fi’l-2ilm):The way of those whose knowledge is firmly rooted (al-2ulama1al-rasukh)in seeking its meaning is in accordance with the fundamentals (usul).Whatever their investigation obtains is acceptable and whatever resists theeffect of their reflection (fikr) they surrender to the World of the Unseen.The way of the people of allusion and understanding (ahl al-isharawa1l-fahm) is listening with the presence of the heart (hudur al-qalb), sothat the object of their levels of understanding (fuhum), appearing fromthe things that are made known, is based upon the allusions of unveiling(isharat al-kashf).31Again making a distinction between public and private interpretation, al-Qushayrinotes that those who receive this knowledge should not share it withothers without being commanded to do so.If they have been asked to maintain the veil and conceal the secret, theyfeign dumbness. If they have been commanded to reveal and proclaim,they freely release the elucidation of the Truth and speak from knowl-edge received from the Unseen.32Al-Qushayriuses metaphors to describe those who understand these deepermeanings and those who do not.Those who have been confirmed with the lights of insights (anwaral-basa1ir) are illuminated by the rays of the suns of understandingTHE QUR1ANIC TEXT AND AMBIGUITY23"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"(fahm). Those who have been clothed in a covering of doubt have beendenied the subtleties of actualization, so that states (ahwal) divide themand mere conjectures (zunun) plague them, and they are swept away inthe wadis of doubt and deception. They only become more and moreignorant, more and more estranged through their uncertainty.33Ruzbihan al-Baqligives one possible explanation for why some can legitimatelyinterpret the ambiguous verses while others should not. He writes that those whounderstand the meanings of the mutashabihatsee God in everything withoutfalling into the trap of believing that God is incarnated in the world, while thosewho do not understand this mystery create chaos when they try to interpret them.As for those in whose hearts is a turning away, they follow what ismutashabih in it. The people of blind imitation (taqlid) plunge into themutashabihat, seeking unity (tawhid), but are cut off from witnessing itbecause they are the victims of illusion (ashab al-wahm), and the victimof illusion does not recognize the truth of temporally originated things(al-ashya1al-muhdatha). How can he recognize the existence of theTruth (haqq) by the mark (rasm) of illusion? If he tries to seek thedifferent kinds of knowledge of the mutashabihat, he will not reachthe truth regarding them and may create discord (fitna). It is because ofthis that the Prophet said, “Reflect upon the bounties of God, not HisEssence.” One who has not traversed the seas of the realities of certaintyhas not seen the mirror of realization. The distinguishing mark (rasm) ofthemutashabihatfalls short of that which has been marked for his faith.He does not grasp their meanings because this is the station of the lovers(ahl al-2ishq) who see the Truth (haqq) in everything. As one of thepeople of meanings (ahl al-ma2ani) said, “I do not see anything withoutseeing God in it.” This is the description of the manifestation of theDivine self-disclosure (tajalli) in the mirror of engendered existence(kawn). But this does not mean that God is in things because He isfree from all forms of incarnation (hulul).34Becausethose firmly rooted in knowledgeare inwardly rooted in the knowledgeof how things really are, they are outwardly calm, courageous, and self-effacingbefore life’s vicissitudes.Those firmly rooted in knowledgeare those who witness the quality ofspirits (arwah) [existing] prior to the bodies (ashbah) in the court of pre-eternity, who have seen with their own eyes the concealed secrets of theparticulars of the eternal types of knowledge. They have understoodfrom them the end results of their situation in the pathways of subsistence(baqa1).

They know that all of it is a trial and a test, so theyremain tranquil in servanthood (2ubudiyya) as their outward distinguishingmark and are firmly rooted in the witnessing of lordliness (rububiyya) intheir inward absolute reality.35Once again al-Kashaniexpresses a similar idea using different terminology.Those who are firmly rooted in knowledgeare those who see unity and not mul-tiplicity, the abiding face and not the appearance of multiplicity in the mirrors ofcreated things. Al-Kashaniunderstands the scholarly tradition of interpretation ofreferring the mutashabihatto the muhkamatas interpretation through this modeof perception.The gnostic verifiers (al-2arifun al-muhaqqiqun),36who recognize theabiding face in whatever form or outward appearance it takes, recognizethe true face among the various faces which the mutashabihattake andthey refer them to the muhkamat, following the example of the poet:There is only one face yetwhen you count the qualities there is multiplicity.Those who are veiled, those in whose hearts is a turning awayfrom theTruth, seek what is mutashabihbecause of their being veiled by multi-plicity from unity. The verifiers follow the muhkam, subordinating themutashabihto it and choosing from its possible aspects what conformsto their religion (din) and school of thought (madhhab).Seeking discord,i.e. seeking to mislead themselves and others. And seeking its interpre-tation (ta1wil) according to what conforms to their state (hal) and method(tariq). When the knife is crooked, its scabbard becomes crooked.Because they do not recognize the one abiding face among the otherfaces, it necessarily follows that they do not recognize the true meaningamong the other [possible] meanings.37According to the Sufis, the knowledge of those who are firmly rooted in knowl-edgeis not like the knowledge of religious scholars, but neither does it contradictit. One of the earliest writers on this topic, al-Tustari, explains that their knowl-edge comes from their detachment from ordinary passion – a detachment whichopens up the possibility of being granted profound knowledge directly from Godof the many levels of meaning in the Qur1an.Those firmly rooted in knowledge.

They are those who haveuncovered (kashifun) three kinds of knowledge, since those who know(2ulama1) are of three kinds: those who devote themselves exclusivelyto knowledge of their Lord (rabbaniyyun), those who devote themselvesexclusively to knowing the Light (nuraniyyun), and those whodevote themselves exclusively to knowing the Essence (dhatiyyun).38Additionally, there are four kinds of knowledge: revelation (wahy),God’s self-disclosure (tajalli), [knowledge] from what is near [to Him](2indi) and [knowledge] from [His very presence] (laduni), as in Hiswords We gave him mercy from Us(alaynahu rahmatanmin2indina)andtaught knowledge to him from Our very presence(2allamnahu minladunna2ilman) (18:65).39In his comments on but no one remembers except those who possess under-standing, al-Kashaniadds detachment from habit (2ada) as another prerequisitefor receiving deeper understanding. He also uses the etymology of the word albabfrom the phrase those who possess understanding(ulual-albab)40to create ametaphor for the transformation that is necessary to become wise. Lubb(pl.lubub) means the choicest part or the kernel of foods such as nuts or wheatandlubab(pl.albab), from the same root, is the choicest part of anything. Whensaid of a man, it means his intellect or understanding.41Referring implicitly tothis dual meaning, al-Kashanicompares the “kernels” of the wise to the “husks”of the more ordinary human characteristics.And no oneremembers that singular and decisive knowledge (al-2ilm al-wahid al-fasl) within the ambiguous and manifold particulars (al-tafasilal-mutashabiha al-mutakaththira)exceptthose whose intellects (2uqul)have been purified by the light of guidance and freed from the husk(qishr)42of passion (hawa) and habit (2ada).43Al-Nisaburiuses the metaphor of husks and kernels somewhat differently inhis commentary on this verse.

They are those who are firmly rooted in thehusks of the acquired types of knowledge (al-2ulum al-kasbiyya) andwho have reached the realities of the kernel (lubab) of types of knowl-edge received from His very presence (al-2ulum al-laduniyya)fromthe very presence of one who is Wise, Knowing (min ladun hakimkhabir) (11:1).In the verse there is an allusion (ishara) to the fact that the types ofknowledge of those who are firmly rootedwere all taught to them on theDay of the Covenant (al-mithaq), since He disclosed the attribute oflordship to the seeds of future humanity and He made them testifyregarding themselves(7:172) by the evidence of lordship, Am I not yourLord?(7:172). Through the witnessing of this evidence, the knowledgeof unity (tawhid) was firmly embedded in the natural disposition (jibla)of the seeds of future humanity and they said, “Yes.”All of the differenttypes of knowledge are included in the knowledge of unity, just as Hesaid, and He taught Adam all of the names(2:31).The seeds were sent back to the loins and were veiled by the attributesof humanity (sifat al-bashariyya), and were transferred to wombs andwandered through the ages from one state and place to another, from themost remote places to the process of birth. The speaking soul, whichknew the knowledge of unity, was sent back to the lowest of the lowforms, veiled in the veil of humanity, forgetful of these different types ofknowledge and the speech regarding them.But then his parents remind him of this knowledge by means of sym-bols (rumuz) and analogies (qara1in) until he remembers some of themfrom beneath the veils of human nature and stages of development.

In a similar way, the entire outerand inner existence of man are husks of the kernel (lubab) of thatexistence which heard and answered on the Day of the Covenant. Hishearing is the husk of that hearing which listened to the speech ofthe Truth. His sight is the husk of that sight which saw the beauty of theTruth.

Most Muslim thinkers accepted some combination ofreason, authoritative tradition, and linguistic expertise as valid tools for interpret-ing the Qur1an. For the Sufis, the sciences based on these tools are part of whatal-Nisaburicalls acquired knowledge (2ulum kasbiyya). The sciences that lead todeeper knowledge of the Qur1an’s meaning, however, are received directly fromGod (2ilm laduni). In Chapter 3, we will see the relationship between this type ofknowledge and spiritual practice.HERMENEUTICS28"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"3UNCOVERING MEANINGKnowledge and spiritual practiceFor the Sufis, knowledge cannot be separated from spiritual practice. AbuNasral-Sarraj (d. 988)1explains this view in his Kitab al-luma2, one of the earliestbooks to discuss the methodology of SufiQur1anic interpretation. According toAbuNasr al-Sarraj, the Sufis are characterized by their practical application(isti2mal) of the verses of the Qur1an and the Traditions of the Prophet, which pro-duces noble qualities, virtuous actions, and higher states, all of which are impliedin the word adab. Although this manner of acting in imitation of the Prophet isalso discussed in the books of scholars (2ulama1) and jurists (fuqaha1), al-Sarrajclaims that their understanding of these behaviors and attitudes is not as deep astheir understanding of other sciences. He states that it is the Sufis who aloneunderstand the various realities and attributes of states such as repentance(tawba), piety (wara2), trust in God (tawakkul), contentment (rida1), to name justa few. The people who experience these states attain them in various degreesaccording to what God has apportioned to them.2In addition to their experience of states, the Sufis are also characterized by theirknowledge of the soul (nafs), its characteristics and inclinations, the subtleties ofhypocrisy (riya1), hidden lust (al-shahwat al-khafiyya), and hidden polytheism(al-shirk al-khafi). They know how to rid themselves of these vices by turning toGod and giving up any sense of one’s own ability and power.3TheSufis are distinguished as well by what they have discovered (mustanbatat)in sciences that are difficult for jurists and scholars to understand. Their ability toloosen the knots and understand what is difficult comes from their sacrificing thevery core of their beings (badhl al-muhaj), so that when they speak of thesediscoveries, they speak from direct experience of them.4Because of what theyhave discovered, the people of understanding (fahm) among the actualized(muhaqqiqun) conform to the Qur1an and the practice of the Prophet externally(zahiran) and internally (batinan). When they act in this manner, God grantsknowledge to them of the deeper meanings of the Qur1an and Traditions ofthe Prophet.5This last passage from AbuNasr al-Sarraj alludes to a hadiththat is cited in fullby al-Ghazaliin his discussion of the relationship between certain kinds ofknowledge and behavior in his Jawahir al-Qur1an.29"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Maybe you will say, “So demonstrate the purpose of the relationshipbetween the two worlds, and why visions are by similitude (al-mithal)and not the unambiguous (al-sarih), and why the Prophet used to seeGabriel often in a form other than his own but only saw him twice in hisown form.”Know that you have become arrogant and have reached quite a heightif you think that the knowledge of this can come to you all at oncewithout your undertaking the task of preparing yourself to receive it bydiscipline (riyada), effort (mujahada), complete renunciation of theworld, disengagement from the tumult of creation, utter immersion inlove of the Creator, and the search for Truth. Knowledge like this will bewithheld from the likes of you and it will be said,You have comein order to learn the secret of my happinessbut you will find me stingy with it.Let go of your greed to attain this knowledge by means of exchanging treatises.Seek it only through the door of effort (mujahada) and piety (taqwa). Then guid-ance will follow and strengthen your effort, just as God said, We will surely guideto Our paths those who have struggled(jahadu)for Us(29:69). And the Prophetsaid, “For anyone who practically applies what he knows, God will bequeathknowledge of what he does not know.”6Linking the bestowal of knowledge to practice and behavior was not unique totheSufis but the emphasis they placed on it was. Abu2Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami(d. 1021) quotes a ninth century Sufias saying, “The whole of Sufism is ways ofbehavior (al-tasawwuf kulluhu adab).”7Reading the Qur1an with presence of the heart (hudur al-qalb)Among the manners (adab) that the Sufis tried to cultivate was a respectful andthoughtful way of reciting or listening to the Qur1an, intended to facilitate theunderstanding of its deeper meanings. AbuNasr al-Sarraj writes thatThe people of understanding (fahm) among the people of knowledge(2ilm) know that the only way to correctly connect to that to which theQur1an guides us is by pondering (tadabbur), reflecting (tafakkur), beingwakeful (tayaqquz), recollecting (tadhakkur) and being present with theheart (hudur al-qalb) when reciting the Qur1an. They know this as wellfrom His words, A book which We have sent down to you as a blessing sothat they might ponder its verses and so that those who possessunder-standing might recollect(38:29). Pondering, reflecting and recollectingare only possible through the heart being present because God said,HERMENEUTICS30"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"surely in that there is a remembrance for one who has a heart(qalb)orwill lend an ear with presence(aw alqaal-sam2a wa huwa shahid)(50:37), that is to say, one who is present with the heart (hadir al-qalb).8There were several different ways in which Sufis tried to awaken themselves tothe task of listening with presence of the heart. One way was to remind them-selves of the awesome nature of the revelation and its transcendent origins. Anoft-repeated quote is attributed to Ja2far al-Sadiq saying, “I swear by God that Godhas disclosed himself (tajalla) to His creation in His speech but they do not see.”9AbuTalib al-Makkiwrites in his Qut al-qulubof a man from the first generations(salaf) who used to read a suraand, if his heart wasn’t in it, he would repeat it asecond time.10Another method is recorded in AbuNasr al-Sarraj’sKitab al-luma2and attributed to AbuSa2id al-Kharraz (d. 899):There are three ways to listen and to be present while listening. The firstis to listen to the Qur1an as if you were hearing the Messenger of Godrecite it to you.Then you should rise from this and hear it as if Gabriel was reciting itto the Prophet, because Allah said, and surely it is the revelation of theLord of the worlds. The trustworthy spirit descends with it upon yourheart(26:192–4).Then you should rise from this so that it is as if you were hearing itfrom God (al-haqq). That is God saying, We revealed the Qur’an whichis a healing and a mercy to the believers(17:84), and His words, the reve-lation of the Book is from God, the exalted, the wise(39:1) and it is as ifyou were hearing it from God most High. Likewise, Ha. Mim. The reve-lation of the Book is from God, the exalted, the knowing(40:1).In your listening [as if you were hearing it] from God, understanding(fahm) is brought out by the presence of your heart (hudur al-qalb) andyour being devoid of any preoccupation with the world and your self by thepower of witnessing (mushahada), the purity of remembrance (dhikr),focused attention (jam2al-hamm), good manners (husn al-adab), purity ofthe innermost secret (sirr) and sincerity of realization (sidq al-tahqiq).11The result of this approach is described as both sweet and awesome. AbuTalibal-Makkitells us that a scholar said:I used to read the Qur1an but found no sweetness in it until I recited it asif I was hearing the Messenger of God reciting it to his Companions.Then I rose to a station above it and I recited it as if I was hearing Gabrielpresenting it to the Messenger of God. Then God brought me to anotherway station and now I hear it from the Speaker. Here I found from it ablessing and delight I could not resist!12UNCOVERING MEANING31"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"He then tells the story of Ja2far al-Sadiq who was overcome by something duringprayers and fainted. When he came, he was asked about it and said, “I keptrepeating the verse in my heart until I heard it from its Speaker and my body wasunable to stand firm when I saw His power.”13Al-Kashaniquotes this traditionfrom Ja2far al-Sadiq and then relates his own experience:Frequently, I used to engage in reciting the Qur1an and pondering itsmeanings by means of the faculty of faith. In spite of diligence in devo-tions, my breast was tight and my heart was agitated, my heart neitheropening because of these meanings, nor my Lord turning me away fromthem, until finally I became familiar and intimate with them. I tasted thesweetness of their cup and their drink. Then my soul was animated, mybreast opened, my mind broadened, my heart expanded, my innermostsecret made spacious, the moment (waqt) and the state (hal) made pleas-ant, and my spirit delighted by that opening. It was as if continually,morning and evening, meanings were being unveiled to me in everyverse such as would fatigue my tongue to describe. There could be nopower adequate to contain them, nor enumerate them, nor any strengthpatient enough to divulge and disclose them.14As in many other aspects of Sufipiety, the various methods towards mindful readingwere systematized by al-Ghazaliin his Ihya1, drawing upon much of the materialfound in AbuTalib al-Makki’sQut al-qulub,15expanding it and arranging it neatlyinto ten categories regarding the external courtesies of recitation (zahiradab al-tilawa) and ten categories regarding inner practices in the recitation of the Qur1an(a2mal al-batin fitilawat al-Qur1an).16The external courtesies, which will not be dis-cussed here, have to do with the ritual state of the reciter, where and when he recites,the quantity, speed, volume and beauty with which he recites, the advisability ofweeping while reciting, the ritual prostrations and supplications in reciting, andhow the Qur1an is to be written down.17The inner practices are as follows:1 Understanding the exaltedness and grandeur of the speech of the Qur1an, andGod’s grace and kindness to His creation in His descending from his exaltedthrone to the level of their understanding. One of the examples used toexplain this is a story of a wise man (hakim) who preached to a king. TheKing asks him how it is that man is able to bear the speech of God. The wiseman tells him that God’s speaking to man is similar to man’s speaking to theanimals, descending to their level through the use of sounds and whistles. Itis also like the Sun, the full gaze of which man is unable to bear, and yet heis able to attain what he needs from it.182 Exaltation of the Speaker. The reciter must be mindful19of the majesty of theSpeaker, knowing that what he reads is not the speech of man, and that thereis an extreme danger in reciting the speech of God. Just as only the rituallypure may touch the Qur1an, only the inward part of the heart that is pure andilluminated by the light of exaltation and reverence will be able to understandHERMENEUTICS32"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"its inner meaning. The act of exaltation of the Speaker will come about onlywhen the reciter reflects upon the attributes, majesty, and acts of God.203 Presence of the heart (hudur al-qalb) and abandonment of the talk of the soul(hadith al-nafs). Al-Ghazaliseems to be talking here about distractingthoughts. He says that a gnostic was asked, “When you read the Qur1an doesyour soul talk about anything?” He said, “What would be more beloved to methan the Qur1an so that my soul would talk of it?” This kind of mindfulness fol-lows from the previously mentioned exaltation that creates an intimacy with-out any inattentiveness, as the reciter finds unending delights in the Qur1an.214 Pondering (tadabbur). Pondering goes beyond being present with the heart(hudur al-qalb), for one might not be reflecting on anything but the Qur1an yetnevertheless be merely hearing it without pondering it. Al-Ghazalitells us thatthis is the purpose of reciting the Qur1an and it is why it is recommended toread it in a slow and distinct manner (tartil). He quotes 2Alib. AbuTalib assaying, “There is no good in an act of worship without comprehension, nor ina recitation without pondering.”22Al-Ghazali’s distinction here between thepresence of the heart (hudur al-qalb) and pondering (tadabbur) is not onemade by other Sufiauthors, who seem to use hudur al-qalbas shorthand forall of the methods used in listening attentively. For example, Al-Qushayriwrites, “the method (sabil) of the people of allusion (ishara) and understand-ing (fahm) is listening with the presence of the heart (hudur al-qalb).”235 Trying to understand (tafahhum). This is to seek to clarify each verse in asuitable manner by contemplating the meanings of the attributes and worksof God, and the circumstances of the prophets and the people to which theywere sent.246 The abandonment of the obstacles to understanding (fahm). Al-Ghazalisaysthat the veils to understanding are four: too much concern for the correctarticulation of letters; rigidity and zealotry in following (taqlid) a school ofthought (madhhab) instead of allowing for insight (basira) and witnessing(mushahada); persistence in sin, being prideful, or being afflicted in generalwith a passion for the world with which one complies; belief that there areno meanings of the Qur1an other than those transmitted from Ibn 2Abbas,25Mujahid26and others, and that all other commentary is that from prohibitedpersonal opinion (tafsir bi’l-ra1y).277 Personal application (takhsis). The reader should assume that every message inthe Qur1an is meant for him. Since God’s message is intended for all people, itis intended for each individual. Al-Ghazalihere is inviting people to contextu-alize the text to their own experience, for if the reader assumes that he himselfis being spoken to by God, he will not consider the study of the Qur1an as workbut, rather, will meditate upon it and act in accordance with it.288 Affectivity (ta1aththur). His heart should be affected by the tenor of differentverses, so that for everything which he understands, his heart will be con-nected to a state (hal) or strong emotion (wajd) such as grief (huzn), fear(khawf), hope (raja1), and so on. When his knowledge is perfected, theUNCOVERING MEANING33"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"predominant state of his heart will be awe (khashya), for constriction (tadyiq)predominates in the verses of the Qur1an. Therefore, he will notice that themention of forgiveness and mercy is connected to conditions that he hasyet to fulfill. The Qur1an is meant to attract these states and to cause one toact on it; otherwise, the trouble of moving the tongue with its letters isinsignificant.299 Ascent (taraqqi). Al-Ghazalirepeats the three stations of reciting the Qur1anfrom AbuTalib al-Makki’s Qut al-quluband elaborates. The first station isthe servant who assumes he is reading to God, standing before him, and Hesees him and hears him. His state is one of petitioning, adulation, imploring,and supplicating. The second station is when he witnesses with his heart thatGod sees him and speaks to him with His kindnesses and whispers to himwith His blessings and beneficence. Therefore, his state is one of modesty,exaltation, attentiveness (isgha1) and understanding (fahm). The third stationis when he sees the Speaker in the speech and the Attributes in the words.Therefore, he does not look to himself, nor to his reading, nor to his blessingsbut rather, his attention is confined to the Speaker, his reflection devotedto him as he is immersed in witnessing the Speaker to the exclusion ofanything else.3010 Disavowal (tabri1). This is the disavowal of one’s own ability and power, andof considering oneself with approval and self-validation. The reciter will notconsider himself among those who are pious, although he hopes to join them.Instead, he should view himself as one among those who are disobedient andnegligent.31HERMENEUTICS34"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"4METHODS OF INTERPRETATIONBeyond describing how to prepare oneself for reading the Qur1an,Sufis alsowrote more specifically about their exegetical methodologies, referred to by avariety of different words or phrases. Most avoided using the term tafsir, reservingthis instead for what they called exoteric Qur1anic interpretation.AbuNasr al-Sarraj and the methods of understanding (fahm) and allusion (ishara)AbuNasr al-Sarraj tells us that there are three things that the sound interpreterwill never do: change the word order of the Qur1an; forget his basic servanthoodby contesting the divinity; and distort words. Although he gives no examples ofthe first two errors, he illustrates word distortion (tahrif) with several examples.Here are two of them:This is like what is related about someone who, when asked about Hiswords, When Job cried to his Lord, “Truly I have been touched by dis-tress(massanial-durr)”(21:83), said that its meaning was, “I have notbeen touched by distress (masa1anial-durr).” We have heard that some-one else, when asked about His words, Did He not find you an orphan(yatim)and give(you)shelter?(93:6), said that the meaning of yatimwas understood [not as an orphan but] as the singular, incomparablepearl (al-durra al-yatima allatilayujadu mithlaha).1In contrast to these interpretative errors, AbuNasr al-Sarraj gives examples fromtwo methods he deems to be correct Sufiexegesis, the method of understanding(tariq al-fahm) and the method of allusion (tariq al-ishara). One of several exam-ples he gives to illustrate the method of understanding is from AbuBakr al-Kattani(d. 934) on Qur1an 26:89, only the one who brings to God a sound heart.According to the method of understanding (fahm), the sound heart is ofthree types: One of them is the one who comes to God with a heart inwhich there is no partner to God; the second is the one who comes to35"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"God with a heart uninterested in anything but God, not desiring anythingbut God; and the third is the one who comes to God, existing only inHim, having been annihilated from all things in God, and then annihi-lated from God in God.2Another example is from al-Shibli(d. 945), who was asked about Qur1an 50:37:Truly in this is a remembrance for the one who has a heart or will lendan ear with presence, and he said, “For the one for whom God is hisheart,” and then he recited, “From me to You, a heart has no meaning.From me to You, every one of my limbs is a heart.”3These interpretations do not radically change the topic of the verses but rathermeditate upon the meaning of the phrases “sound heart” or “listening with pres-ence.” The controversial aspect of the interpretations has more to do with the factof the inclusion of such Suficoncepts as the annihilation of the self which wasstrenuously opposed by some Muslims.The examples AbuNasr al-Sarraj gives for the allusive method of interpreta-tion (tariq al-ishara), on the other hand, demonstrate far-reaching interpretativeanalogies which constitute a far more problematic kind of exegetical methodol-ogy. He quotes AbuYa zid al-Bistami(d. 874) who, when asked about gnosis(ma2rifa), replied with an allegorical interpretation of a Qur1anic verse from thestory of the prophet Sulayman and the queen Bilqis.He said, Truly, when kings enter a village, they destroy it and debase theexalted among its inhabitants. This is the way they behave(27:34). Whatis meant by that is that it is the custom of kings, when they descend upona village, to enslave its people and make them submissive to them, sothat they can do nothing without the command of the king. Likewise,when gnosis (ma2rifa) enters the heart (qalb), nothing remains in it thatit does not uproot, and nothing moves in it that it does not burn.4In the story of Bilqis and Sulayman, these words are spoken by Bilqis, demon-strating her political sagacity in trying to avoid a violent confrontation withSulayman’s forces. Al-Bistamicreates an analogy between the force of an invadingking and a powerful knowledge that seizes the heart completely.Another example AbuNasr al-Sarraj gives of this method is attributed to al-Junayd(d. 910). Considered a more “sober”Sufithan al-Bistami, his allusive interpretationdemonstrates the acceptability of this kind of interpretation for most Sufis.When asked about his silence and lack of movement during the spiritualconcert (sama2), al-Junayd alluded to His words, and you see the moun-tains, thinking them to be firmly fixed, but they will pass as the cloudspass: the artistry of God who perfects everything(27:88).5HERMENEUTICS36"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The verse is part of a passage describing the events of the Day of Judgment, butal-Junayd applies it here to his spiritual state in the present world.This method of allusion (tariq al-ishara) is the more problematic of the twomethods that AbuNasr al-Sarraj describes because it goes beyond the literal senseof the text. The controversial nature of this kind of interpretation is addressedsome 200 years later in the writings of al-Ghazali, who attempts to distinguish themethod from that of the batiniyyaand philosophers.Al-Ghazaliand the method of striking similitudes (darb al-mithal)Al-Ghazali’sMishkat al-anwaris a book that includes both a methodology forQur1anic interpretation and al-Ghazali’s interpretation of the Light Verse of theQur1an. Al-Ghazalicalls the methodology “the secret and method of creatingsimilitudes (sirr al-tamthil wa minhajihi)”6or “the method of striking similitudes(minhajdarb al-mithal).”7The phrase darb al-mathalordarb al-amthalisused twenty-seven times in various forms in the Qur1an – mostly to describe theanalogies and parables created by God to explain things to mankind.Al-Ghazaliconnects the method of “striking similitudes” to the existence oftwo worlds, worlds which he describes using both philosophical and Qur1anic ter-minology. The one world is spiritual (ruhani), intellectual (2aqli), and supernal(2ulwi); it is the world of Sovereignty (malakut) and the Unseen (ghayb). Theother world is physical (jismani), sensory (hissi), and lower (sufli); it is the worldof Dominance (mulk) and the Visible (shahada).8The World of the Visible (2alam al-shahada) is the place from which one risesup to the World of Sovereignty (2alam al-malakut), an ascension made possibleby the interrelationship (munasaba) and connection (ittisal) between the two. Tohelp man’s ascent, God has made the World of the Visible parallel to the World ofSovereignty. There is nothing in this world that does not have a likeness (mithal)or several likenesses in that world, and there is nothing in that world which doesnot have a likeness or likenesses in this world.9To illustrate this, al-Ghazaliusesthe example of the viewing the celestial bodies by Ibrahim (Abraham).10Indeed, there are high and noble luminous substances (jawahirnuraniyya sharifa2aliyya) in the World of Sovereignty (2alam al-malakut)that are called angels. Because lights emanate from them to human spir-its, they are called “lords” (arbab) and God is the “Lord of lords.” Theyhave varying degrees of luminosity that have similitudes (amthal) in theWorld of the Visible (2alam al-shahada): the sun, the moon and the stars.At first, the traveler on the way (al-salik lil-tariq) reaches a degreethat is the degree of the stars, and the radiance of [the star’s] lightbecomes clear to him. The fact becomes unveiled to him that the lowestworld is entirely under its authority and the radiance of its light.Suddenly, from [the star’s] beauty and sublimity, it becomes clear to him,METHODS OF INTERPRETATION37"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"and he says,“This is my lord!”(6:76). Then, when what is above[this star] becomes clear to him, the degree of the moon, he sees that theformer has set in relationship to the latter, so he says, “I do not love thatwhich sets” (6:76).Likewise, he continues to ascend until he reaches that which has itssimilitude in the sun, and he sees that it is greater and more sublime. Yet hesees that it also has its similitude in its interrelationship (munasaba) to theothers, and whatever has a relationship with something imperfect is imper-fect itself and “sets.” From this, he says, “I have turned my face to the onewho created the heavens and the earth in pure faith(hanifan)” (6:79).11The method of striking similitudes (darb al-mithal) is to find the connectionsbetween the physical and the spiritual world. Another example al-Ghazaligivesof this interpretative method in the Mishkat al-anwarconcerns God’s speech toMusa(Moses) in which Musais asked to remove his shoes in the holy valleywhere he has seen a fire.12If the first waystation of the prophets is the ascent to the world sancti-fied from the turbulence of sense perception and imagination, then thesimilitude (mithal) of that waystation is the holy valley(20:12). And if itis not possible to tread that holy valley without removing the two worlds,meaning the present world and the hereafter, turning towards the One,God (al-haqq)..., then the similitude of that removal is the taking off ofthe shoesat the time of switching to the pilgrims’ garments in order toturn towards the holy Ka2ba.13Al-Ghazalifinds two parallel meanings for the removal of Musa’s shoes here.In the first, he compares the removal of the shoes to a spiritual state in which onedistances oneself from concern for this world or the next. In the second, he com-pares it to the ritual enacted during the preparation for the pilgrimage. Al-Ghazaliexplains that the method of striking similitudes (darb al-mithal) is like thescience of dream or vision interpretation (ta2bir).14Accepting the literal and the symbolic meaning simultaneously is like acceptingtwo different kinds of language acts. In his Jawahir al-Qur1an, al-Ghazalisuggests that knowledge of the deeper meanings of the Qur1an requires knowl-edge of the language of similitudes:I do not think that you will be successful (in seeking out the secrets ofthe Qur1an) if you obstinately proceed with your own opinion (ra1y) andintellect (2aql). How can you understand this when you do not under-stand the language of states (lisan al-ahwal)? Instead, you only believein propositional speech (maqal)!

You will not understand the words of the speaker whosaid, “The wall said to the peg, “Why are you making a hole in me?” Hesaid, “Ask the one who is hammering me and does not drop me! Behindme is the stone which hammers me.” You are not aware that these wordsare true and more correct than propositional speech, so how will youunderstand the secrets that are behind this?15The example of the talking inanimate objects, the wall and the peg, is one thatal-Zamakhsharialso uses in his commentary, written some twenty years after al-Ghazali’s death, in his interpretation of verse 41:11.16Either al-Zamakhshariborrowed from al-Ghazali, which seems unlikely, or they both adopted the exam-ple from a previous commentator or theologian. Al-Zamakhshariunderstands thewords spoken by the heavens and the earth, “We have come willingly,” as a figu-rative expression (majaz) which is either the creation of a similitude (tamthil) oran imaginative representation (takhyil) whose only purpose is to depict the effectof God’s power over decreed things, having nothing to do with the real acts ofspeech and answering. He uses the example of the talking wall and peg both toillustrate the figurative use of speech and to confirm the meaning of the verse.Whereas al-Zamakhshariuses the concept of figurative language to solve theproblem of the anthropomorphism of the verse, al-Ghazali’s point seems to bedifferent. Although he might have agreed with al-Zamakhshari’s interpretation asit explains a verse which otherwise seems literally absurd, al-Ghazaliis sayingsomething more than that; he is asserting that metaphorical and symbolic ways ofspeaking are superior modes of expression for facilitating deeper comprehensionof the Qur1an. Ibn 2Arabidevelops this idea further in his writings by comparingthe rational and imaginative faculties in man.Ibn2Arabiand the method of allusion (ishara)Unlike al-Ghazali, Ibn 2Arabirejects rational interpretation (ta1wil2aqli) outright.Although there are aspects of the revelation which reason declares impossible,this only proves the imperfection of man’s rational faculties, not the necessity ofinterpretation.17Man has two faculties by which he obtains knowledge of God.The faculty of reason (2aql) in man works by means of reflection (fikr), using thelanguage of abstraction. It is capable of knowing God’s incomparability, how Heis utterly different from His creation. The imaginative faculty (khayal) in man, onthe other hand, works through sensory perceptions, using the language of images.It is capable of perceiving God’s similarity in His self-disclosures (tajalli) in Hiscreation. Perfect knowledge combines both of these faculties. Use of only therational faculty turns God into an abstraction and use of only the imaginativefaculty leads to polytheism and anthropomorphism.18The Qur1an uses both abstractions and images to communicate its message, butthe latter predominate because revelation entails a descent of meanings into theMETHODS OF INTERPRETATION39"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"imaginal realm and sense perception and is an act of connection, not separation.The rational faculty is unable to understand the images of the Qur1an and there-fore seeks to interpret it so as to make it conform to the dictates of reason, butthis leads to a distortion of its meaning. Prophets and friends of God, on the otherhand, accept the whole of the Qur1an because they understand the language ofimages by means of unveiling (kashf).19To use al-Ghazali’s example describedpreviously, the prophets and friends of God will understand what the verse Theysaid, “We have come willingly”(41:11) means because they have experienced itthrough the seeing, hearing, and tasting of the imaginative faculty.Only the prophets and friends of God understand the principles of “strikingsimilitudes” (darb al-amthal). They can strike similitudes themselves becauseGod has taught them how to do this, and they recognize the similitudes that Godhas struck for Himself because they have witnessed the connection between thesimilitude and the meaning it represents.20However, “striking similitudes” (darbal-amthal) is not the term Ibn 2Arabiuses to describe Sufiinterpretation of theQur1an, nor does he use the term ta1wil, which he applies almost exclusivelyto the kind of rational interpretation (ta1wil2aqli) of which he is so critical.21Instead, the term Ibn 2Arabiprefers is “allusion” (ishara). He explains that Sufishave chosen this word over “commentary” (tafsir) in order to defend themselvesfrom the ignorance of exotericists. The word ishara, which literally means “topoint,” is used just once in the Qur1an (19:29), in a verse referenced by Ibn 2Arabias part of his explanation for the Sufis’ adoption of the term. Just as Maryam(the Virgin Mary) “pointed” to the infant 2Isa(Jesus) so that he spoke in herdefense against the accusations of her people, so do Sufis “point” or “make allu-sion” to what they know so that they will not be attacked by uncomprehendingexotericists.22Some of the examples of Ibn 2Arabi’s own Qur1anic interpretation in hisFutuhat al-makkiyyaresemble AbuNasr al-Sarraj’s method of allusion (tariqal-ishara)23and al-Ghazali’s “striking of similitudes” (darb al-mithal), albeitwith the addition of his own technical vocabulary. Chittick translates one suchexample from the Futuhaton verses 52:1–8 of the Qur1an:By the mount– the body, because of the natural inclination within it,since it is not independent through itself in its wujud[existence].And a book inscribedfrom a divine dictation and a right hand writingwith a pen of potency.On a parchment, that is your own entity – by way of allusion, notexegesis.Unrolled, manifest, not rolled up, so it is not curtained.By the inhabited house, that is, the heart that embraces the Real, soHe is its inhabitant.And the uplifted roof– the sensory and suprasensory faculties in the head.And the burning sea, that is nature kindled with the ruling fire thatnecessitates movement.HERMENEUTICS40"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Surely thy Lord’s chastisement is about to fall.

Between these two properties become manifest the barzakhs[isthmuses], which possess towering splendor and firmly-rootedknowledge.24In this interpretation, the five signs invoked to attest to the reality of the Dayof Judgment are taken to refer to the spiritual makeup of man. Events which willoccur at the end of time are taken to refer to events which happen in the here andnow. What makes Ibn 2Arabi’s correspondence between these two realities uniqueis the way in which he connects them. The first verse of this suraisBy the mount(wa1l-tur); as Chittick explains,The word turor “mount” derives from a root that means to approachsomething and to hover around it. The Shaykh takes the etymologicalsense as an allusion to the bodily nature’s inclinations, which draw ittoward things that it desires.25It is this close attention to the etymological and grammatical possibilities of thetext which distinguishes Ibn 2Arabi’s approach to Qur1anic interpretation, anapproach based on the assumption that all the possible meanings which the Arabiclanguage allows for any given word or group of words in the Qur1an are valid. Toreject any one of these meanings is to limit God’s knowledge, to imply thatHe was unaware of the various ways in which His Book could be interpreted.26One example which shows the difference between this kind of hyperliteralismand a more purely symbolic or allegorical approach is Ibn 2Arabi’s interpretationof the verse, “laysa ka-mithlihi shay1un” (42:11), which can be translated as, thereis nothing similar to him. The kameans “like” and mithlmeans “similar.” Ibn2Arabiaccepts the common explanation that the kahere merely serves to reinforcethe meaning of mithl. He also endorses an interpretation in which karetains itsmeaning, making it possible to translate the verse as there is nothing like His sim-ilar, and to understand it as a reference to the Perfect Man.27Although the com-mon interpretation of this verse is that it asserts God’s incomparability, Ibn2Arabi’s acceptance of all possible interpretations allows him to find in it confir-mation for God’s incomparability and His similarity. Ibn 2Arabiunderstood thisinterpretative approach as an extreme fidelity to the possibilities of the Qur1anictext. His critics denounced it as a distortion of its meaning (tahrif ma2ani1l-Qur1an).28METHODS OF INTERPRETATION41"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Al-Nisaburiand al-Kashaniand the method ofesoteric interpretation (ta1wil)The terms tafsirandta1wilhave a complicated history.29In the first few centuriesof Islam, they were used interchangeably to refer to any commentary on theQur1an. Over time, however, the word tafsirbegan to be applied only to thoseworks that relied heavily on the transmitted interpretative traditions from the firstfew generations of Muslims, while ta1wilbecame a term used to describe othertypes of interpretations. In the fourteenth century both al-Nisaburiand al-Kashaniused the word ta1wilto describe their interpretative activity.Al-Nisaburidivides his commentary Ghara1ib al-Qur1aninto three sectionscomprised of variant readings (qira1atandwuquf), exoteric commentary (tafsir),and esoteric commentary (ta1wil). His understanding of how the last two relate toone another is set forth in his introduction:Know that the requirement of religion is that the Muslim should notinterpret (yu1awwilu) anything in the Qur1an or the hadithaccording tomeanings which would invalidate the essentials which the Prophet andthe pious first generations (al-salaf al-salih) commented (fassara) on,like the Garden, the Fire, the Path, the Balance, the palaces, the rivers,the trees, etc. Instead, he must affirm these essentials just as they havebeen set forth.Then, if he understands from them other realities (haqa1iq), symbols(rumuz), and subtleties (lata1if) which have been unveiled to him, thereis no harm. For surely God has not created anything in the world of form(2alam al-sura) that does not have an equal (nazir) in the world of mean-ing (2alam al-ma2na). And nothing is created in the world of meaning,which is the Hereafter, which does not have a reality (haqiqa) in theworld of Truth (2alam al-haqq), which is the unseen of the unseen (ghaybal-ghayb). And nothing is created in the two worlds that does not havepatterns (namadhij) in the world of mankind (2alam al-insan). But Godknows best.30The essentials (a2yan) that Nisaburimentions here are elements of the Afterlifethat Islamic philosophers interpreted allegorically, an act of interpretation forwhich they were strongly criticized. Al-Nisaburiemphatically states that theseelements must be accepted as literal truth. His method of interpretation resemblesthat described by al-Ghazaliin his Mishkat al-anwar, in which correspondencesare uncovered between the physical and spiritual worlds.Writing in the same period, al-Kashaniuses the terms tafsirandta1wilinmuch the same way as al-Nisaburidoes, although al-Kashaniwrites only ta1wil.In addition to the term ta1wil, al-Kashanirefers to “tatbiq,” a word that means “tomake correspondences.”31In the introduction to his commentary, al-Kashaniwrites that the process of ta1wilis unending, while that of tafsiris limited.

As for esoteric interpretation (ta1wil), it neverceases because it varies according to the states of the listener and his cir-cumstances in the stages of his traveling and his different phases. Wheneverhe rises from a station, a door of new understanding is opened to him, andhe beholds (ittala2a)32by means of it the subtlety of a ready meaning.33Here, al-Kashani’s view is not without precedent. AbuNasr al-Sarraj had alsopointed out this difference between exoteric and esoteric commentary:[TheSufis] differ in their deductions just as the exotericists (ahl al-zahir)do. However, the differences of opinion between the exotericists lead toerror while this is not so in the science of the inward (2ilm al-batin)because the differences [represent] virtues, advantages, noble character-istics, states, morals, stations and degrees. It is said that the differencesof opinion among the scholars (2ulama1) in the science of exotericism(2ilm al-zahir) is a mercy from God because the one who is right refutesthe one who is wrong, thereby making the error of his opponent inreligion clear to people so that they turn away from him. If this were notthe case, people would leave their religion.But the differences of opinion between the people of realities is also amercy from God because each one of them speaks from where he is atthe moment (waqtuhu) in response to his state, making allusions fromhis ecstasy (wajd). There is a benefit in their words for everyone fromamongst those who observe acts of obedience and the lords of the hearts,the aspirants and those who are realized, according to their differentcapacities, characteristics and degrees...[AbuNasr al-Sarraj demon-strates his point here with different interpretations of what the “truefaqir” means from ten different Sufis . . .] They have all differed in theirreplies just as they have differed in where they were at the moment(awqat) and their states, but all are sound (hasan). Each reply belongs tothe group of people suitable for it, and each is a benefit, blessing,increase and mercy for them.34Ruzbihan comments on this as well, speaking of the Sufis in the past:They spoke according to their stations (maqamat) in the presence of HisOmnipotence (jabarut) and according to the extent of their travelling inthe open spaces of His Kingdom (malakut).

The “seven inner senses” is a reference to a hadithwhich states, “TheQur1an has an exoteric sense (zahr) and an inner sense (batn), and its inner sensehas an inner sense up to seven inner senses (butun).”36The “special technical terms”(istilahat) refer to spiritual faculties of man called “subtle substances” (lata1if),each of which corresponds to a prophet mentioned in the Qur1an.37It is a system of correspondences based on Qur1an 41:53: We will show themOur signs in the horizons (afaq) and in their souls (anfus) until it becomes man-ifest to them that this is the truth(41:53).38Knowledge and deeper understandingof the Qur1an, as well as the ability to benefit from it, requires the discovery ofthe connection between the horizons (afaq) and souls (anfus), between theprophets and the subtle substances (lata1if) of man. Man has the potential todevelop spiritually from a speaking animal to the bearer of the trust of God.At each level of his development, he becomes the possessor of a new subtlesubstance (latifa) as shown in Table 4.1.The reader of the Qur1an should recognize these correspondences so as to beable to practically apply the lessons of the stories of the prophets to one’s ownstruggle. Al-Simnaniexplains this process with examples from each of the sevenlevels, as in this passage on the bodily subtle substance (latifa qalabiyya) and theprophetAdam:Whenever you hear a part of the Book addressing Adam, listen to it withyour subtle bodily subtle substance (latifa qalabiyya). Apply your bod-ily subtle substance practically in what has been commanded and pro-hibited for it, and take heed in the similitudes struck for it (bi-maduribamathalanlahu).

Al-Simnaniexplains that no one willbelieve what he has said until they have witnessed it for themselves. But once thisscheme has been understood, the reader will know with certainty that the Qur1anhas seven inner senses. Al-Simnanigives an example of how these can be discoveredin a single verse of the Qur1an 4:43. He addresses only the first part of it:O you who believe, do not come to prayers while intoxicated until youare able to know what you are saying; nor in a state of ritual impurity,unless you are traveling, until you have done the major ablution.The external meaning of this verse is clear, admonishing the believer in a stateof drunkenness or impurity to delay saying his prayers until he is sober and ritu-ally pure.

Disagreements continued,however, over what constitutes legitimate commentary and exegetes had to justifytheir endeavors in light of a hadithon interpretation transmitted from Ibn 2Abbas:The Prophet said, “Whoever speaks of the Qur1an from his personalopinion (ra1y), let him take his seat in the Fire.”1A similar tradition quotes the first caliph AbuBakr al-Siddiq as saying,What earth would carry me, what heaven shelter me, if I were to speak ofthe Qur1an from my personal opinion (ra1y) or of what I do not know?2The question became how to distinguish sound and acceptable interpretation fromthe prohibited interpretation by personal opinion (tafsir bi1l-ra1y).

Al-Ghazaliwas one of the firstto contest this view.Al-Ghazaliontafsirbi1l-ra1yAl-Ghazaliaddressed the problem of defining what constitutes tafsir bi1l-ra1yaspart of his defense of SufiQur1anic interpretation in his Ihya1 2ulum al-din.What is intended by [the prohibition on commentary of the Qur1an] musteither be a restriction to what has been transmitted (naql) or heard[from authorities] (masmu2), abandoning any deduction (istinbat) andindependent understanding (istiqlal bi1l-fahm), or what is intended issomething else. It is completely wrong to think that what is intendedis that one should not speak about the Qur1an except according to whatone has heard, for several reasons.6Al-Ghazalipresents four arguments for not confining commentary to the trans-mitted tradition. First, the traditions traceable to the Prophet explain only part ofthe Qur1an. Most of the transmitted exegetical tradition comes from Companionssuch as Ibn 2Abbas and Ibn Mas2ud and represents their own opinions, not whatthey heard from the Prophet himself. Therefore, these interpretations can becalledtafsir bi1l-ra1y. Second, the Companions and early exegetes had disagreementsover the interpretation of Qur1anic verses. Third, there is a distinction betweeninterpretation and revelation. This is demonstrated in the Prophet’s prayer for Ibn2Abbas, “O God, instruct him in religion and teach him interpretation (ta1wil).”Al-Ghazaliasks, “If interpretation was what has been heard [from authorities](masmu2) like what has been revealed (tanzil), what would be the purpose ofgranting him that?”7Fourth, the Qur1an confirms the possibility of deduction(istinbat) independent of transmitted knowledge in Qur1an 4:83,“Truly, thoseamong them who are able to deduce(the matter) (yastanbitunahu)know it.”8Having discussed what the hadithontafsir bi’l ra1ydoesnotmean, al-Ghazalicontinues with what he believes is the correct interpretation of the ban on tafsirbi1l-ra1y.The prohibition is for one of two reasons: The first is where someone hasan opinion (ra1y) regarding something to which he is inclined by hisnature (tab2) and inclination (hawa), so he interprets (yata1awwalu) theQur1an in accordance with his opinion and inclination so that he canargue for the authenticity of his own objective (gharad). If he did nothave that opinion and inclination, that meaning would not have appearedto him from the Qur1an.Sometimes this is done knowingly like the one who argues for theauthenticity of his innovation (bida2) by means of some verses of theHERMENEUTICS48"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Qur1an, knowing that that is not what is meant by the verse, but he seeksto deceive his opponent by it.Other times it may be done unknowingly but, since the verse has apotentiality for more than one meaning, his understanding of it inclinesto the sense which agrees with his objective, that view having been pre-ferred because of his opinion and inclination. He has commented bymeans of his opinion, i.e., his opinion has led him to that commentary. Ifhe did not have that opinion, then he would not have preferred that sense.Other times he may have a sound objective, and so he seeks someindication (dalil) for that from the Qur1an and then proves it with some-thing he knows was not intended for that...this is like someone whocalls for struggle with the hard heart and says, God says, “Go toPharoah. Truly, he has transgressed,” (20:24) and he points to his ownheart and indicates that that is what was intended by Pharoah. This kind[of interpretation] is what some preachers do with sound intentions ofbeautifying their talk and attracting the listener, but it is prohibited. Thebatiniyyahave utilized this with corrupt intentions to deceive people andinvite them to their false school of thought. In accordance with theiropinion (ra1y) and school of thought, they bring the Qur1an down to mat-ters which they most certainly know are not what was intended by it.These categories are the first of the two reasons for the prohibition oftafsir bi1l-ra1y. What is meant [in the hadith] by personal opinion (ra1y)is the false personal opinion that agrees with inclination (hawa) withoutsound personal effort (al-ijtihad al-sahih). Personal opinion (ra1y)includes the true and the false. That which agrees with inclination(hawa) can be designated by the term “ra1y.”9Al-Ghazaliis making a distinction between two types of personal opinion(ra1y): sound personal effort (al-ijtihad al-sahih), which is praiseworthy, and opin-ion biased by inclination (hawa), which is not. The latter is blameworthy whetherthe interpreter is aware of his distortion of the meaning of the Qur1an, andwhether his intention is sound, as in the case of the preacher, or unsound, as in thecase of the batiniyya. His example of the sound-intentioned but nonethelessblameworthy interpreter who suggests that what is meant by Pharoah is the hardheart is a strange one, given that this is exactly the kind of interpretation practicedby some Sufis. Al-Ghazalihimself justifies it in his other works with his theoryof correspondences, a theory we will return to shortly. Al-Ghazalicontinues withthe second reason for the ban on tafsir bi1l-ra1y.The second is where someone hastens to comment on the Qur1an onthe basis of the external sense of the Arabic without seeking help fromlistening [to authorities] (sama2) and transmission (naql) regarding thestrange words (ghara1ib) of the Qur1an, its obscure and alternate expres-sions, its abridgment, elision, ellipsis, and word order.

After that,understanding (fahm) and deduction (istinbat) will be expanded. Thestrange words (ghara1ib) that can be understood only through hearing[from authorities] (sama2) are many. We will point out some of them sothat one can seek information about words like them and know that it isnot permissible to neglect the memorization of exoteric commentaryfirst; there is no hope of reaching the inner sense (batin) before masteringthe exoteric sense (zahir). One who claims to understand the secrets ofthe Qur1an without mastering exoteric exegesis is like one who claims tohave reached the inside of the house before crossing through the door, orthe one who claims to understand what Turks mean in their speech with-out his having understood their language. Truly, exoteric commentary isthe same as learning the language that is necessary for understanding,and there are many areas that can only be learned by hearing from[authorities] (sama2) and there is no hope in reaching the inner sense(batin) before mastering the external sense (zahir).10Al-Ghazaliis stating his belief that understanding the information transmittedfrom the Companions and Followers of the Prophet is necessary, but only as a firststep in interpretation, and he appears to be limiting the usefulness of their com-mentary primarily to linguistic explanations. Because of the conflicting interpre-tations found among early exegetes, al-Ghazalirejects an unquestioningacceptance of their interpretations in areas other than issues of language. Althoughal-Ghazali’s purpose here is to defend Sufiexegesis in particular, his argumentworks as well for any exegete wishing to go beyond the interpretations of the firstgenerations of Muslims. His argument was, in fact, adopted by one of the mostwell-known Qur1anic commentators, Abu2Abd Allah Muhammad al-Qurtubi(d. 1272),11who quotes al-Ghazaliwithout due attribution to him almost word forword in the introduction to his commentary, Al-Jami2li-ahkam al-Qur1an.12Ibn al-Jawziand Ibn Taymiyya on the importance of transmitted informationAl-Ghazalifirmly believed that the interpretation of the Qur1an should not berestricted to the transmitted tradition.

Ibn al-Jawziattemptsin this book to identify and correct the errors he sees among his fellow Muslims,devoting approximately half of the book to the errors of Sufis even though heappears to have been a member of a Sufiorder himself.14According to Ibn al-Jawzi, the starting point for all the delusions of the Sufisis their turning away from seeking transmitted knowledge.15The devil deceivesthem in this matter in several ways. First, he shows them how much work isinvolved in seeking knowledge while making ease and comfort seem attractive.SomeSufis have said that preoccupation with transmitted knowledge is idlenessbut this is only because they have seen the commitment it requires.Second, he causes them to be content with just a little knowledge, so that theybelieve that those who seek extensive knowledge of hadithdo so only for prestigeand their own pleasure. Ibn al-Jawziconcedes this desire for prestige, but com-pares it to the desire for marriage, a desire that is necessary for the greater goalof procreation.Third, he causes some of them to believe that the objective is practice (2amal)without understanding that devotion to knowledge is the most perfect practice.Last, the Devil deceives the Sufis into believing that knowledge is acquiredfrom inner processes (bawatin) and inspiration (ilham), without intermediary (bi-lawasita). Ibn al-Jawzidoes not deny the possibility of inspiration but insiststhat it is not knowledge in and of itself, but is rather the fruitof knowledge andpiety. He insists that there can be no knowledge without the intermediary of trans-mitted knowledge; otherwise, there would be no way of knowing whether theinspiration received is sound or merely a Satanic suggestion. Those who belittletransmitted knowledge attack the religious law (shari2a), a charge tantamount toinfidelity. He notes that this is the case with AbuYa zid al-Bistamiwhen he criti-cized religious scholars, saying, “Poor people! They get their knowledge from thedead, but we get our knowledge from the Living One who never dies.”16According to Ibn al-Jawzi, there is never a point where one moves beyond theneed for transmitted knowledge. He disapprovingly relates a story regardingtheSufiAhmad ibn Abu1l-Hawari:Ahmad ibn Abu1l-Hawarithrew his books into the sea and said, “Yes,you wereproof (dalil), but devotion to proof after attainment (wusul) isabsurd.” Ahmad ibn Abu1l-Hawarihad searched out hadithfor thirtyyears. When he attained all he could from them, he carried his books tothe sea, submerged them and said, “O knowledge, I have not done this toyou out of disdain, nor out of disdain for what is your due. Rather, I usedto seek you out in order to be guided by you to my Lord. Now that I havebeen guided by you, I have no further need of you.”17SÁFIQUR1ANIC INTERPRETATION51"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Ibn al-Jawziunderstands that Sufis justify their position concerning transmittedknowledge by dividing knowledge into the exoteric (2ilm al-zahir) and esoteric(2ilm al-batin), but it is a distinction he rejects.Many of the Sufis make a distinction between the law (shari2a) and thetruth (haqiqa) but this is an ignorant thing to say because all of the lawis different kinds of truths (haqa1iq).18Despite this criticism, Ibn al-Jawzinotes that there have been many Sufis who doinsist upon the necessity and primacy of the law.Ibn Taymiyya was an admirer of Ibn al-Jawzi, and he demonstrates a similarbelief in the primacy of transmitted knowledge. He insists that knowledge cannever be received directly without the intermediary of the hadithand Traditions,and he attacks any belief to the contrary as a corrupt influence from philosophy.What is stated by different groups of the batiniyya– the Shi2ibatiniyyasuch as the writers of the “Epistles of the Brotherhood of Purity” and theSufibatiniyyasuch as Ibn Sab2in and Ibn 2Arabiand others, and as alsofound in the writings of AbuHamid [al-Ghazali] and others – that it is pos-sible for men who practice spiritual exercises, purification of the heart,and development of the soul by means of praiseworthy characteristics, tocome to know the realities that have been related from the Prophets con-cerning belief in God, angels, the Book, the prophets and the Last Day, andinformation about the jinn and devils, without the intermediary of com-munication from the prophets, is based upon this false premise, which isthat when they purify themselves this will descend upon their hearts eitherthrough the “Active Intellect” or by some other means.19He criticizes AbuHamid al-Ghazaliin particular for stating this belief frequentlyin his works and for suggesting that those who practice spiritual disciplines mayhear the speech of God just as Musadid. According to Ibn Taymiyya this contra-dicts the correct beliefs held by the founders of the four Schools of Law, hadithscholars and the “real”Sufis (sufiyya muhaqqiqun) who follow the Messenger.20However, Ibn Taymiyya does not deny that there is a connection between knowl-edge and practice but rather insists that this knowledge will never be receivedother than by means of the prophets.Some theologians have criticized what is true in [al-Ghazali’s writings],claiming that the practice of spiritual disciplines and purification of theheart has no effect whatsoever in obtaining knowledge. They are alsowrong in this denial since the truth is that piety and purification of theheart are among the strongest means to acquiring knowledge. However,the Book and the Sunna must be resorted to for knowledge and practice.It is not possible for anyone after the Prophet to know by himself withoutHERMENEUTICS52"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"the intermediary of the Prophet these things from the Unseen. No onecan do without that which has come from the messengers in under-standing the Unseen. The speech of the Messenger is clear in and ofitself. There is no unveiling to anyone nor is any analogy of it equal toit. An “unveiling” or “analogy” of someone is sanctioned only when it isconsistent with [the speech of the Messenger]; otherwise it contradictsit. However what is called an “unveiling” (kashf) or an analogy (qiyas)does contradict the Messenger and is therefore a false analogy and falseimagination (khayal). This is what was meant when it was said, “I seekrefuge in God from philosophical analogy and Sufiimagination.”21Ibn Taymiyya affirms a limited role for inspiration in areas where there areinadequateshar2iindications. In his Sharhkalimat li-2Abd al-Qadir, he writesIf the salik[the person seeking knowledge] has creatively employed hisefforts to the external shar2iindications and sees no clear probabilityconcerning the preferable action, he may feel inspired – along with hisgoodness of intention and reverent fear of God – to choose one of twoactions as superior (to the other). This kind of inspiration is an indica-tion concerning the truth. It may be even a stronger indication than weakanalogies, weak hadiths, weak literal arguments (zawahir) and weakistishabswhich are employed by many of those who delve into the prin-ciples, differences, and systematizing of fiqh.22Ibn Taymiyya’s acceptance of a limited place for inspiration, however, does notextend to what Sufis call the knowledge of states (ahwal). A basic error of theSufis, according to both Ibn al-Jawziand Ibn Taymiyya, is their acceptance of thestate they call ecstasy (wajd). We have already seen how the Sufis found a modelfor Qur1anic recitation in Ja2far al-Sadiq, who is said to have repeated a verse con-tinually in prayer until he heard it from the Speaker Himself and fainted. Ibn al-Jawzidoes not refer to this particular story in his Talbis Ilbis, but he states thatthere are many examples in books on asceticism of men fainting, crying, and evendying upon hearing the Qur1an recited.23Although acknowledging that there mayhave been some sincere believers amongst them, he nonetheless rejects what hesees as a loss of control without precedence among the Companions of theProphet. According to Ibn al-Jawzi, the Companions had the purest of hearts buttheir strong emotion (wajd) did not go beyond weeping and humility (khushu‘).24Ibn Taymiyya also makes it clear that those who faint or even die upon hearinga recitation of the Qur1an are not to be emulated. In his Al-Sufiya wa’l-fuqara1hedescribes three ranks of those who listen to or recite the Qur1an, knowinglyor unknowingly contesting the levels found in the Sufiversions:Instead, there are three ranks [to those hearing the Qur1an]. One of themis the state of those unjust to themselves, those who are hard-hearted, notSÁFIQUR1ANIC INTERPRETATION53"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"yielding to the audition [of the Qur1an] nor to the remembrance [ofGod], and they are comparable to the Jews...The [second rank] is the state of the pious believer who is too weak tobear what suddenly afflicts his heart.

For hewas made to travel by night into the heaven, and God revealed to himwhat He revealed. Yet, he awoke as he had spent the night; his state didnot change. Thus, his state is more excellent than that of Moses – Godbless him and give him peace – who fell swooning (Q. 7:143) when hisLord manifested Himself to the mountain. Moses’ state is a splendid,exalted, and excellent state, but the state of Muhammad – God bless himand give him peace – is more splendid, exalted, and excellent.25Ibn Taymiyya’s views on the subject of losing consciousness are more complexthan Ibn al-Jawzi’s. Whereas Ibn al-Jawzileans towards a complete condemnationof losing consciousness, Ibn Taymiyya carefully and clearly distinguishes theinsincere who seek unconsciousness, even through alcohol and drugs, from thesincere who succumb because they have not yet realized the more perfect state ofsobriety. It is a discussion similar to that found in many Sufitexts.26Ibn al-Jawzi,however, rejects the entire notion of knowledge by means of states and stations,calling al-Qushayri’s description of them a worthless and confused mess(al-takhlitalladhilaysa bi-shay1).2Abd al-Karim b. Hawazin al-Qushayriwrote a book, Al-Risala, for [theSufis] in which he makes extraordinary remarks on annihilation (fana1)and subsistence (baqa1), contraction (qabd) and expansion (bast), themoment (waqt) and the state (hal), ecstasy (wajd) and existence/finding(wujud), gathering (jam2) and separation (tafriqa), sobriety (sahw) andintoxication (sukr), tasting (dhawq) and drinking (shurb), obliteration(mahw) and affirmation (ithbat), self-disclosure (tajalli), presence of theheart before God’s signs (muhadara)and unveiling (mukashafa), flashes(lawa1ih), rising stars (tawali2) and glimmers (lawami2), originating(takwin) and consolidating (tamkin), the religious law (shari2a) and thetruths (haqa1iq)and so on – all that from a delirium without any basis,and his tafsiris even more incredible.27For both Ibn al-Jawziand Ibn Taymiyya, valid Qur1anic exegesis will not deviatein any way from the interpretations of the early Companions and Followers of theHERMENEUTICS54"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Prophet. Ibn al-Jawzispecifically criticizes many of the books we have beenmentioned so far and will be discussing in Part II. He mentions AbuNasr al-Sarraj’sKitab al-luma2, wherein are mentioned “repugnant beliefs” and “despicable state-ments.” AbuTalib al-Makki’sQut al-qulubcontains “false ahadith” and “corruptbeliefs.”2Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami’sHaqa1iq al-tafsircontains astonishingexamples of Sufiexegesis “which occur to them without the support of any ofthe fundamentals of knowledge.” Al-Ghazali’sIhya1 2ulum al-dinis full of falsetraditions which al-Ghazalidoes not know are false.28According to Ibn al-Jawzi, the problems in Sufiinterpretation occur as a resultof linguistic error or distortion, deviation from the transmitted tafsirtradition,abandonment of the obvious and clear meaning of a verse, and incorrect belief.He gives examples of these errors, taken primarily from al-Sulami’sHaqa1iqal-tafsir, and then ends with these dismissive words:The entire book is like this. I had intended to show quite a bit of it herebut I see that time will be wasted in recording something which bordersbetween infidelity (kufr), error (khata) and drivel (hadhayan). It is likewhat we have related from the batiniyya. These are examples for anyonewho wants to know what the book is like; if anyone wants to knowmore, let him look at this book.29Ibn Taymiyya on sound interpretation of the Qur1anIbn Taymiyya’sMuqaddima fiusul al-tafsir30can be seen as a point-by-pointrebuttal of al-Ghazali’s arguments for not confining Qur1anic commentary to thetransmitted tradition. Al-Ghazali, as we have seen, asserted that the Prophetexplained only part of the Qur1an, and that most of the transmitted exegeticaltradition comes from the Companions of the Prophet and represents their ownopinions, not what they heard from the Prophet himself. According to al-Ghazali,this material is contradictory and should not be considered as authoritative as therevealed text. Instead, al-Ghazaliviews the interpretative tradition from the firstgenerations of Muslims (salaf) as a model for the independent exercise of judg-ment (ijtihad), not as conclusive proof (hujja) that demands acceptance.31Ibn Taymiyya’s approach, on the other hand, is to create a hierarchy of sourcesthat are to be consulted in descending order until the explanation of a Qur1anicverse is clear: the Qur1an, the Sunnah of the Prophet, the statements of theCompanions of the Prophet (sahaba), and the statements of the Followers of theCompanions of the Prophet (tabi2un).32Ibn Taymiyya supports his methodologyand rebuts the points made by al-Ghazaliby making two assertions. The first isthat the Prophet completely explained the meaning of the entire Qur1an to hisCompanions.33The second is that the Companions and the Followers have greaterauthority in interpreting the Qur1an than any generation of Muslims after them, tothe point where their consensus is conclusive proof (hujja).34Ibn Taymiyyadiffers from other SunniMuslim commentators, not so much in his degree ofSÁFIQUR1ANIC INTERPRETATION55"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"reverence for the Prophet and the pious predecessors (salaf), but in his confidencein the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and unity of the material transmitted fromthem.35He does not accept the assertion that the Companions or the Prophet andthe early exegetes disagreed over interpretation of Qur1anic verses. Instead, hegives examples proving that their differences amount to variation rather thancontradiction.According to Ibn Taymiyya, errors in interpretation are the result of error inone of two areas. He states that knowledge is either the result of authentic trans-mission (naql musaddaq) or verifiable deduction (istidlal muhaqqaq) and that,therefore, commentators make errors either through their imperfect knowledge ofahadithor by faulty thinking. Mostly these errors are the result of either precon-ceived ideas that are read into the Qur1an, or attention paid only to the words andnot to the context of the revelation. Like al-Ghazali, Ibn Taymiyya divides thosewho make these errors into those who know full well that they are distorting themessage of the Qur1an and those whose intention is good. According to IbnTaymiyya, the second type includes many Sufis, preachers, jurists, and otherswho have the correct meanings but the wrong Qur1anic verses to support thosemeanings. Ibn Taymiyya tells us that this is the case for much of what the SufiAbu2Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami(d. 1021) includes in his commentary, Haqa1iqal-tafsir.36Ibn Taymiyya is not opposed to Sufiexegesis per se, but ratherconsiders it as falling into the category of tafsir bi1l-ra1yif it does not agree withthe interpretations of the earliest exegetes.Al-Ghazali’s defense of ta1wilThe fact that al-Ghazaliwas criticized well before Ibn Taymiyya for defendingQur1anic exegesis that goes beyond the transmitted interpretative tradition can beseen in his work Fa ysal al-tafriqa.37It is a book that calls for careful discriminationin evaluating the beliefs of other Muslims before charging them with disbelief(takfir). It was apparently written to console an unnamed colleague upset byattacks on al-Ghazalihimself. Al-Ghazalistates that the problem of excessivetakfirstems from a lack of differentiation between those who deny the messageof the Prophet and those who have different interpretations of that message.Al-Ghazaliagrees that those who deny the message of the Prophet are guilty ofdisbelief (kufr), a legal category in Islamic societies with serious consequences.But those who accept that message, differing only in their interpretations of it,are guilty only of innovation (bida2) or error (khata1) if they are wrong in theirinterpretations, both lesser charges than disbelief.Al-Ghazalibegins his argument with the statement that interpretation is essen-tial for those verses of the Qur1an and ahadithwhose meaning, if taken literally,would be absurd. According to him, this interpretation is incumbent on everyMuslim, however literal-minded, if they are not to prove themselves completelystupid and ignorant.38However, since al-Ghazaliagrees that some interpretationsdoconstitute disbelief, he provides a system for evaluating interpretative activity.HERMENEUTICS56"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The system is based on a conception of existence (wujud) as comprised of fivedegrees (maratib), each of which has a different relationship to interpretation.39The first degree is essential (dhati) or absolutely real existence (al-wujud al-mutlaqal-haqiqi), which is made up of the heavens and the earth, the animals and theplants that exist whether or not we perceive them. Al-Ghazaliasserts that there isno need for interpretation (ta1wil) of this degree of existence because it entailswhat is manifest (al-zahir). Significantly, al-Ghazaliincludes in this category theThrone, the Footstool and the Seven Heavens mentioned in the Qur1an and theTraditions of the Prophet, elements of the Unseen world which he insists are solid,real things, and therefore not subject to interpretation.The second degree of existence is sensible (hissi), that which we see but whichhas no existence outside of our perceptions. Included in it are the dreams andhallucinations of ordinary people and the visions of prophets and saints. Anexample of a hadithwhich corresponds to this level of existence is the one inwhich the Prophet says, “The Garden was shown to me in the breadth of thiswall.” The person who has proof (burhan) that physical bodies do not intermingleand that the small cannot contain the large, knows that this means that the like-ness of the Garden appeared (tamaththala) to the senses (al-hiss), so that it wasas if the Prophet was witnessing it.The third degree of existence is the imaginary (khayali), referring to things thatwe create in our imaginations that are absent from our senses, for example, thelikeness of an elephant that exists in our brain but not outside of it. The hadithused to illustrate this degree of existence is one which begins with the Prophetsaying, “It was as if I were looking at Yunus (Jonah)...” Al-Ghazaliinterpretsthis to mean that the Prophet was not really seeing (lam yakunhaqiqa’l-nazar),but it was likeseeing (ka’l-nazar). However, he seems unsure of his own example,saying that it would not be farfetched to say he was really seeing it, as describedin the sensible degree of existence.The fourth degree of existence is mental (2aqli) existence, based on thedifference between a thing’s meaning (ma2na) and its form (sura). The hand is theform (sura) for the meaning (ma2na) “the ability to strike.” When the Qur1an orhadithspeak of God’s hand, the person who has proof (burhan) of the absurdityof God’s having a sensible or imaginable hand attests to God’s having the powerto strike, give, and withhold, which is the meaning or reality of “hand.”The fifth degree of existence is analogical (shabahi) and refers to somethingwhich does not exist in any of the prior degrees of existence, and can only be under-stood by its resemblance (ishbahormunasaba) to the attributes or qualities ofsomething else. The examples al-Ghazaligives are the qualities such as anger, long-ing, joy, and patience, when they are attributed to God. The person who has proof(burhan) knows that God cannot possess qualities that imply imperfection, so heunderstands anger, for example, as the will to punish.It is the last two degrees of existence that produce the most radical interpreta-tions through the use of metaphor (majaz) and figurative speech (isti2ara).Al-Ghazaliinsists that this kind of metaphorical interpretation is unavoidable,SÁFIQUR1ANIC INTERPRETATION57"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"supporting his claim by stating that even Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the man mostopposed to this form of interpretation, found himself unable to avoid it completely.40Having established the necessity of metaphorical interpretation, al-Ghazalisetsforth a rule of interpretation (qanun al-ta1wil) so as to define the parameters ofits permissibility. In any given text of the Qur1an or hadith, the interpreter mustaccept the literal sense (zahir) based on its essential existence (al-wujud al-dhati)unless he has proof (burhan) of its absurdity. If it is absurd, he looks to the nextdegree of existence for its meaning, unless this too is absurd. The metaphoricalinterpretation required by the mental and analogical degrees will only be permis-sible if the interpreter has proof of the absurdity of interpretation based on all theother levels.Al-Ghazaliconcludes that disagreements over interpretation are based on thematter of proof, with the Hanbalideclaring there is nothing inconceivable aboutGod’s being described by the direction “above,” and the Ash2arideclaring there isnothing inconceivable about the ocular vision of God. To avoid internal strife inthe Muslim community, al-Ghazalihas two different recommendations, one forthe common man untroubled by doubts in his faith, and one for intellectualswhose faith needs more proof. For the common man, he recommends the unques-tioning acceptance of the literal meanings of the Qur1an,hadith, and the interpre-tations of the Companions of the Prophet. Speculative thinkers whose beliefs aremore troubled may cautiously use this method of going beyond the literal sensein order to strengthen their faith. They should not, however, charge others withdisbelief, unless there is denial of one of the roots of the faith (belief in God, inHis Messenger, and in the Last Day), or one of its branches when based on thesoundest Traditions.41One of the examples al-Ghazaligives to illustrate those who deny the funda-mental tenets of Islam, and therefore deny the message as a whole, are thephilosophers who deny God’s knowledge of particulars or the physical reality ofthe Garden and the Fire in the Afterlife. He charges them with having abandonedthe literal meaning of the Qur1an and the soundest hadithon these matters withoutany valid proof of the inconceivability of these concepts. What is particularlydamning to them is their belief that the physical Afterlife is merely a fictiondevised for those unable to grasp the intellectual Afterlife. This belief implies thatthe Prophet engaged in a kind of lie, however well meaning. This, according toal-Ghazali, is what places them at the first degree of atheism (zandaqa).42As for those who interpret matters that do not pertain to Islam’s most basicbeliefs, al-Ghazaliadvises against accusations of disbelief, although one may stillmake accusations of innovation and error. Al-Ghazaliuses a Sufiinterpretation asan example. He states that a certain Sufifound it inconceivable that the ProphetIbrahim (Abraham) could have believed that a star, the moon, or the sun could beGod (Qur1an 6:76–9). Instead, al-Ghazaliexplains, the Sufi took this as an indi-cation that the celestial bodies mentioned represent something non-physical,which he then understood to mean the angelic luminous substances (jawahirmalakiyya nuraniyya). Al-Ghazaliis critical, saying that this rejection of theHERMENEUTICS58"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"literal sense is not based on proofs (barahin) but on conjectural indications(dalalatzanniyya). Nonetheless, he insists that the Sufishould not be chargedwith disbelief as this matter is not one of the fundamental beliefs of Islam.43Theinterpretation referred to here is, in fact, al-Ghazali’s own, or at least one hequotes at length in other works. Versions of it can be found in both his Ihya1 2ulumal-din44andMishkat al-anwar.45Al-Ghazalidoes not even identify himself as a Sufihere, but rather says, “Thisis their kind of interpretation.” He then refers to two other Sufiinterpretations,one of which is also discussed in his Mishkat al-anwar.46They have interpreted (ta1awwalu) “the staff ” and “the shoes” in God’swords, “Take off your shoes” (20:12) and “Throw down what is in yourright hand” (20:69). Perhaps conjecture (zann) in matters such as thesethat do not relate to the fundamentals of belief is analogous to proof(burhan) regarding the fundamentals, so there should be no accusations ofdisbelief or innovation. To be sure, if the opening of this door were to leadto confusing the hearts of the common people, then the author should beparticularly charged with innovation in everything whose mention has notbeen related on the authority of the first generations (salaf).47Al-Ghazaliadvocates tolerance for this kind of Sufiinterpretation so long as itdoes not confuse people and so long as the Sufidoes not claim to be released fromthe obligations of religious law. Al-Ghazalirecommends that such a Sufibe killedbecause, even if he were still a believer, his actions would open a door to licen-tiousness (ibaha) that cannot be closed, thereby causing great harm to religion.48Problems with al-Ghazali’s defense of ta1wilAl-Ghazali’s uses the word ta1wilin his Fa ysal al-tafriqato refer to the interpre-tation of verses in the Qur1an whose literal meaning can be definitively shown tobe absurd. Ta1wilused in this way is a concept that can be traced back to the the-ologian al-Ash2ariwho strove to find a defensible exegetical stance between pureliteralism and the type of metaphorical interpretation practiced by the Mu2tazila.49Hanbalischolars felt that God should be described only as He described Himself,or as the Prophet described Him. They therefore felt that the anthropomorphicverses of the Qur1an should not be interpreted as the Mu2tazila interpreted them,but rather should be understood bi-lakayfa, without asking “how” or “why”. Theclassic definition of the bi-lakayfadoctrine goes back to a tradition from Malikb. Anas,50quoted here from Tahrim al-nazar fikutub ahl al-kalam(Censure ofSpeculative Theology), written by the Hanbalischolar Muwaffaq al-Din ibnQudama (d. 1146):Has he not heard the story of Malik b. Anas when he was asked withregard to the Koranic verse, “The Merciful on the throne sits firm,”51SÁFIQUR1ANIC INTERPRETATION59"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"“how 2sits firm’?”? Malik inclined his head and was silent until the sweatof fever covered his brow; then he looked up and said: “The attributeistawa52is unknown, the modality of it is not rational; but belief in it isobligatory, and inquiring about it is a heretical innovation.”53Al-Ash2arialso relied on the bi-lakayfadoctrine, but opened the door to somedegree of interpretation if there was any proof (hujja) that the literal sense shouldbe abandoned. The way that the later Ash2arite theologian Fakhr al-Din al-Raziunderstood this was to divide the verses of the Qur1an into three parts. The firstare the clear verses (muhkamat) whose apparent sense (zahir) can be confirmedby rational indicators (al-dala1il al-2aqliyya). The second type of verses are thosewhose apparent sense (zahir) has been shown to be impossible by definitive indi-cators (al-dala1il al-qati2a). The third type of verses are ambiguous in meaning(mutashabih) and indicators like these cannot be found to either affirm or deny[one meaning or another].54The sound exegete, according to al-Razi, will knowhow to discover the truth concerning the first two types of verses, and will knowto entrust the meaning of the third type to God.When al-Ghazalibrings up examples of Sufiinterpretation in his Fa ysalal-tafriqa, he expands the definition of verses open to ta1wilbeyond the anthro-pomorphic verses that are usually the subject matter of this debate, verses whoseliteral meaning was generally accepted by Muslims as being absurd. In discussingthe story of the Prophet Ibrahim and the celestial bodies, al-Ghazaliacknowl-edges that the rejection of the literal sense of this story is not based on proofs(barahin) but on conjectural indications (dalalatzanniya). What al-Ghazaliismost likely referring to here are theological arguments objecting to the idea thatthe Prophet Ibrahim could have mistaken the celestial bodies for God. However,when al-Ghazaliproceeds from his comments on the story of Ibrahim to Sufiinterpretations of Musa’s “staff ” and “the two shoes,” he is now addressinganother kind of verse altogether, verses whose literal sense is not at all in question.Clearly, Musa’s staff and shoes can be accepted as existing literally and thereforedo not have to be interpreted metaphorically. Al-Ghazali, however, seems unawarethat he has violated his own hermeneutic principle. The weakness of al-Ghazali’sdefense of Sufiinterpretation in his Fa ysal al-tafriqais that his argument onlyworks for the interpretation of Qur1anic verses whose literal meaning is problem-atic, verses that constitute only a small portion of Sufiexegesis.Al-Ghazali’s final defense of SufiinterpretationWhether al-Ghazalirecognized the problem with his argument, his later writingsaddress it nonetheless in two ways.55The first concerns defining who is qualifiedto interpret the ambiguous verses of the Qur1an. In his Fa ysal al-tafriqa, al-Ghazalihad recommended that the common people (2awamm) accept the ambiguousparts of the Qur1an, such as the anthropomorphic verses, without interpretation.The rule of interpretation he suggests in this book is only for those people whoseHERMENEUTICS60"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"faith has become troubled. However, by the end of his life, as we have alreadyseen, al-Ghazalihad expanded the definition of the common people in his Iljamal-2awammto include Qur1anic exegetes, jurists, hadithscholars and theologians,all of whom he believed should not go beyond the literal sense of Qur1anic verses.Instead of confining ta1wilto those whose faith has become troubled, al-Ghazalinow confined the right to interpret ambiguous verses to “those firmly rooted inknowledge”(al-rasikhun fi1l-2ilm), defined by al-Ghazalias individuals of highspiritual attainment. Al-Ghazalishifts from using rational criteria for definingacceptable ta1wilto criteria based on the interpreter’s spiritual practice and divinegrace.56The second area in which a change can be seen in al-Ghazali’s exegetical think-ing is in how he distinguishes Sufiinterpretations from batiniinterpretations. Inhis early writing on the subject in the Ihya1 2ulum al-din, al-Ghazali, he mentionsthe allegorization of the Qur1anic figure Pharoah as an example of blameworthyinterpretation in his discussion of tafsir bi1l-ra1y:This is like one who calls for struggle with the hard heart and says, Godsays, “Go to Pharoah. Truly, he has transgressed.” (20:24), and he pointsto his own heart and indicates that that is what was intended by Pharoah.This is what some preachers do with sound intentions of beautifyingtheir talk and attracting the listener, but it is prohibited. The batiniyyahave utilized this with corrupt intentions to deceive people and invitethem to their false school of thought.57The problem here is that equating Pharoah with the hard heart is exactly the kindof symbolic or allegorical commentary that Sufis do.58If one follows the rule ofinterpretation which al-Ghazaliproposes in his Fa ysal al-tafriqa, any interpreta-tion that goes beyond the literal sense of a Qur1anic verse is unacceptable unlessthe literal sense can be shown to be absurd. Al-Ghazalirevises his defense of Sufiinterpretations in the Mishkat al-anwar,59now relying upon the Ibn Mas2udhadithto insist that all the different levels of meaning in the Qur1an must beaccepted as valid. Unacceptable interpretation would be like saying that Musadidnot have any shoes, or that he did not hear the words, “Take off your shoes.”Equally unacceptable is the denial of other levels of meaning.God forbid! Surely the annulment of the literal meanings (zawahir) isthe view of the batinyyawho have looked one-eyed towards one of theworlds, not knowing the parallelism (muwazana) between the twoworlds, nor understanding this aspect. Likewise, the annulment ofsecrets (asrar) is the teaching of the hashawiyya.60Whoever looks onlyto the external sense (zahir) is a hashawi, and whoever looks only to theinner sense (batin) is a batini, and whoever joins the two is perfect(kamil). Because of that [the Prophet] said, “The Qur1an has an exotericsense (zahir) and an inner sense (batin), a limit (hadd) and a point ofSÁFIQUR1ANIC INTERPRETATION61"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"ascent (muttala2). It may be that this is transmitted from 2Aliand stopswith him (mawquf2alayhi).61Rather, I say that Musaunderstood from the command to take off hisshoes the removal of the two engendered worlds, so he followed(imtathala)62the command externally by taking off his shoes andinwardly by the removal of both worlds. This is “taking heed” (i2tibar),i.e., the crossing over (2ubur) from one thing to another, from the externalsense (zahir) to the secret (sirr).63Although it is questionable whether the Isma2ilis would have denied the realityof Musa’s shoes, al-Ghazaliargument here is, nonetheless, his most effectivedefense of Sufiinterpretation. In adopting it, however, he abandons the conditioncontained within the Ash2aridefense which allows for ta1wilonly when the apparentsense of a verse can be shown to be absurd.The success of al-Ghazali’s argument can be seen in the fact that al-Simnaniadopts it, with a few modifications, in the introduction to his tafsir:Know with certainty that anyone who rejects commentary on the exo-teric sense (zahir) of the Qur1an regarding the human world of horizons(al-2alam al-afaq al-nasuti) is a stubborn batiniapostate. Anyone whorejects commentary on the inner sense (batn) of the Qur1an regarding thekingly world of souls (al-2alam al-anfus al-malakuti) after havingaffirmed its external sense is a stupid and anthropomorphic idiot. Butthe one who combines the external and the inner sense is a happy Sunnimuslim. The one who knows the limit (hadd) of the Qur1an in the Worldof Dominion (2alam al-jabarut) is a rightly guided gnostic believer(mu1min). The one who ascends to the lookout point (muttala2) of theQur1an in the World of Divinity (2alam al-lahut) is a perfectly virtuousman (muhsin kamil), witness for communities, looking out (muttali2)over unseen things, praiseworthy and noble.64Al-Simnaniadds an interesting interpretation of the hadithontafsir bi1l ra1y,suggesting that the definition of unacceptable interpretation changes according tothe level of meaning of the Qur1an.The one who interprets the external sense (zahr) of the Qur1an by hisown opinion (ra1y), without hearing from a commentator whose author-ity derives from the Companions, has become a disbeliever because ofhis ignorance of most of its precepts (ahkam), causes of revelation(asbab al-nuzul), and parables (amthal).The one who interprets the inner sense of the Qur1an by his own opin-ion (ra1y), without secret, spiritual, hidden or real inspiration (ilham sirriaw ruhiaw khafiawhaqqi), has becomes a disbeliever in all the allusions(isharat) coming from the presence of Lordship through the particularsHERMENEUTICS62"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"of the powers (al-daqa1iq al-quwa) and the kingly subtleties (al-lata1ifal-malakutiyya).The one who interprets the limit (hadd) of the Qur1an by his own opin-ion (ra1y), without the permission emanating from the Ka2ba of Divinity,has become a disbeliever in the gnosis of the tenuities of the qualitiespertaining to the Dominion (ma2arif raqa1iq al-sifat al-jabarutiyya).The one who interprets the lookout point of the Qur1an by his ownopinion (ra1y), before His permission to enter into the exalted presenceand before obtaining great purity and comprehension of the core ofthe real subtle substance (al-latifa al-haqqiya) which nurtures the subtle“I” substance (al-latifa al-ana1iyya), has become a disbeliever in therealities of the Qur1an.65Al-Simnani’s definitions of the different types of prohibited tafsir bi’l ra1ycanbe compared to the restrictions which al-Ghazaliapplies as to who may interpretthe Qur1an in non-literal ways. Determining the legitimacy of interpretations thatgo beyond the literal sense of the Qur1anic text becomes far more difficult herebecause there are no external formulas to follow. There is a possibility of error atevery level, and al-Simnanitherefore makes suggestions on how to combat them.Just as a healthy and sound ear is a requirement for hearing the external sense ofthe Qur1an and learning its exoteric commentary, a healthy and sound “ear” of theheart is a requirement for hearing the inner sense of the Qur1an and learning itsesoteric commentary. Each higher level of comprehension requires a correspond-ingly healthy and sound “ear.” Just as there are remedies for ailments of the phys-ical ear, there are remedies for these inner ailments, consisting of theabandonment of attachments and various forms of remembrance (dhikr), for whichal-Simnanisuggests several examples.66The defense of Sufiexegesis that al-Ghazaliends up with is the one that mostSufis seem to have quietly adopted. As detailed in the hadithtransmitted from IbnMas2ud, the Qur1an has many levels of meaning, and therefore it would be wrongto limit its meaning to only those meanings transmitted in the interpretativetradition. The literal or exoteric aspect of its message must be accepted whole-heartedly along with these other levels of meaning. The interpretations of otherlevels of meaning correspond to the different states experienced by individualSufis, and are the result of their spiritual practices and divine grace. Their valid-ity cannot be verified by external means, and communicating them will notnecessarily be of larger benefit to the community of Muslims.SÁFIQUR1ANIC INTERPRETATION63"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Part IICOMMENTARY"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"6SÁFICOMMENTATORS ON THE QUR1ANIn a religion as firmly based on a book as Islam, almost any writing whichemerges can conceivably be classified as commentary on the Qur1an, leaving uswith the difficult task of deciding which works should be included in the genreof exegesis. The task of identifying the formal characteristics of tafsirhas beentackled with great skill by Calder.1He suggests that, first and foremost, a work oftafsirmust follow a “canon and segmentation, lemma and comment” format thatsequentially addresses the complete, or nearly complete, text of the Qur1an.”2Second, the tafsirmust allow for polyvalent readings through the citation ofnamed authorities, a polyvalence that may, however, be limited by the selectionof material included and the statement of preferred interpretations. Last, a tafsirmust measure the Qur1anic text by use of outside disciplines, both linguistic(instrumental) and theological (ideological).3Given these defined characteristics,Calder does not include Sufiworks within the genre of tafsir, although he acceptsthe use of Sufiideas as an ideological structure against which to measurethe Qur1an.4As we have already seen, the Sufis themselves often reserved the term “tafsir”for the types of commentaries following the characteristics that Calder describes,and used different terms like “allusion” (ishara) and “interpretation” (ta1wil), ormore rarely, “understanding” (fahm), or “striking similitudes” (darb al-mithal),for their commentaries. What holds these writings together as a genre, however,is the fact that they follow the lemma and comment format of tafsir, and addressthe Qur1an in a sequential, even if in a more selective manner.5Works such asJalaluddin Rumi’sMathnawiand Ibn 2Arabi’sFususal-hikamare examples ofSufiworks that present a large amount of Sufiinterpretations of the Qur1an, butare not generally considered as part of the commentary genre because they do notfollow this format.Suficommentaries on the Qur1an differ from the tafsirgenre described byCalder in another way, in the area of style. These works have been described as“allegorical”6and “symbolic,”7but these are terms that do not adequately conveytheir varied forms of discourse. As part of their interpretation of Qur1anic verses,Sufis displayed literary characteristics that are not often found in work of tafsir,creating their own metaphors, wordplay, narratives, and poetry as an integral part67"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"of their exegesis, and it is this use of language and style as much as specific Sufidoctrines and beliefs that gives Suficommentary its distinctive character.The commentaries chosen here to represent Sufiexegesis consist of a varietyof influential works, but is should be noted that many important Suficommen-taries remain in manuscript form. Because the exegetical works included in thisstudy will be excerpted as part of an analysis of selected Qur1anic passages, theunique style of each of the commentaries may not be obvious. What follows, then,is a chronological introduction to each of the commentators, with biographicalnotes, and comments on the style and method of each.Al-TustariAbuMuhammad Sahl b. 2Abd Allah al-Tustariwas born in the Persian provinceof Khuzistan and died in Basra in 896.8He became involved with Sufism early inlife under the influence of his uncle, a hadith scholar and disciple of the SufiMa2ruf al-Kharkhi(d. 815). His teachings are preserved in writings that reflect hisown hand as well as the disciples who took oral instruction from him.Al-Tustari’stafsiris the oldest continuous Suficommentary on the Qur1an.Exegesis attributed to other early Sufifigures exists in the compilation ofal-Sulami(d. 937 or 942), Haqa1iq al-tafsir, but al-Tustari1s commentary is theearliest work to survive independently. Although there is yet no critical edition ofthe commentary, which comprises a small volume, Böwering has made a thoroughstudy of it on the basis of six extant manuscripts.9He describes it as a disjointedwork, which “resembles a collection of jottings, noted down in loose sequenceand linked to each other without any apparent principle of logical order.”10Thesejottings appear to come from three different sources: al-Tustari’s exoteric andesoteric interpretations of Qur1anic verses, his aphorisms and stories taken fromother works no longer extant, and additions and glosses inserted into the text,either by disciples of al-Tustarior later Sufis.11Given the nature of the compilation of this work, its rather eclectic content isnot surprising. According to Böwering,There are literal and metaphorical interpretations of the Qur1anicphrases: illustrations from the Prophet’s normative and customarybehavior; examples from the legends of the prophets of old; traces ofmystical views shared by earlier Sufis and anecdotes concerning theirpractical conduct; fragments of Tustari’s mystical themes, his religiousthought, and ascetic practice; exhortations and guidelines for disciplesand answers to their questions; and finally, episodes about Tustari1s life,glosses and explanatory insertions into the text.12Al-Tustari’stafsirhints at the possibilities but leaves to others the task of a moreconscious and comprehensive presentation of Sufiexegesis.COMMENTARY68"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Al-SulamiAbu2Abd al-Rahman Muhammad b. al-Husayn al-Sulamiwas born in the city ofNisabur (Nishapur in Persian).13Although he traveled extensively to study hadithand perform the pilgrimage, most of his life was spent in his home city, where hedied in 1021. Like the grandfather who educated him and the Sufiteacher whoinitiated him, al-Sulamiwas a Shafi2ischolar of hadith. He was a prolific writer,with more than 100 books to his name, about 30 of which are extant. His Tabaqatal-Sufiyya, the oldest extant Sufihagiographical collection, and his two compila-tions of Sufiexegesis, the Haqa1iq al-tafsirand the Ziyadathaqa1iq al-tafsirareinvaluable because they preserve oral teachings and written works from Sufis ofthe eighth to tenth centuries.TheHaqa1iq al-tafsircomprises two volumes in a recently published edition.14Portions of the work were previously published by Massignon and Nywia.15TheZiyadathaqa1iq al-tafsiris an appendix to the Haqa1iqrecently discovered andpublished by Böwering in one volume.16According to Böwering, al-Sulamigath-ered the material for his commentaries from both written and oral sources. Theonly written sources which al-Sulamimentions explicitly are those attributed toAbu1l-2Abbas Ahmad al-Adami, known as Ibn 2Ata1(d. 921) and Ja2far al-Sadiq(d. 765).17The most frequently cited authorities in the Haqa1iqare Ibn 2Ata1, AbuBakr al-Wasiti, known as Ibn al-Farghani(d. 932), Sahl al-Tustari, AbuSa2idal-Kharraz (d. 899), al-Junayd (d. 910) and AbuBakr al-Shibli.18In the Ziyadat,the most frequently cited authorities are Sahl al-Tustari, Ja2far al-Sadiq, and Ibn2Ata1.19Both books include anonymous quotations as well.In the introduction to his tafsir, al-Sulamistates that he included two types ofquotations in his compilation. The first he calls ayat, by which he means inter-pretations of specific verses, and the second he calls aqwal, which are Sufisayingsrelated to key Qur1anic terms. Noting the wealth of commentaries based upon theexoteric sciences and the relative lack of the same for Sufiexegesis, al-Sulamiwrites that he has deliberately confined himself to the latter. Böwering remarksthat, in preserving the earliest Sufis’ exegetical comments, al-Sulamiperformeda function similar to that of al-Tabariin his Jami2al-bayan, and in doing so estab-lishedSuficommentary by allusion (ishara) as a distinct genre within the tafsirtradition.20The style of al-Sulami’s commentaries reflects their structure as a compilation.Because there is no unifying voice behind the many citations that follow oneanother, linked only by the verse being interpreted, themes remain underdevel-oped and terms unexplained. Without a larger context, many of these commentsare somewhat cryptic. The focus is on key Qur1anic words, rather than on largersegments of the verse and its context. Böwering understands the interpretationsas encounters between key Qur1anic words and mystical experience.These allusions are the result of the merger between Qur1anic keynotesand the matrix of the Sufiworld of ideas. The keynotes, Qur1anic wordsSÁFICOMMENTATORS ON THE QUR1AN69"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"or phrases striking the Sufi’s mind, may be taken up in total isolationfrom the actual context or, less frequently, presuppose familiarity with awider frame of Qur1anic reference. It is significant to realize that thesekeynotes are not studied as a text, but aurally perceived by men experi-enced in listening attentively to Qur1an recital and intent on hearing God,the actual speaker of the Qur1anic word. Listening to the Qur1anic word,theSufiis captured by a keynote, a fleeting touch of meaning commu-nicated to him by the divine speaker. This keynote signals to the Sufithebreakthrough to God, revealing himself in His divine speech and open-ing a way to Himself through and beyond His divine word.With these keynotes the listener associates a cluster of images emerg-ing from the content of his personal experience. These images mergewith the Qur1anic keynotes and find their expression in the allusions thatare jotted down in the commentary in a condensed, abbreviated form.These jottings thus reflect the gist of the listener’s encounter with thedivine word merging inextricably with the matrix of the Sufiworldof ideas. In this process the allusions achieve a synthesis that makes itimpossible to discern where “exegesis” ends and “eisegesis” begins, andwhere the discovery of man’s own existence disappears in the revelationof the divine word.21This interaction between the Qur1anic text and Sufiexperience in Suficommentarywas first noted by Nwyia. One of the most distinctive examples of this is found inwhat Nwyia calls the “intériorisation des figures prophétiques.” He writes,In their meditation on the Qur1an, the figures of the prophets become pro-totypes of mystic experience or figures of religious consciousness. Thatwhich they read in the stories of the ancients (akhbar al-awwalin)are not“histories” but a lesson (2ibra), a doctrine on the relationships betweenGod and man. In this way Abraham becomes the figure of suffering butfaithful consciousness or the prototype of friendship with God, Moses,the figure of spiritual experience as dialogue with God, etc.22While many of these comments can be obscure because of their use of esotericsymbolism or technical Sufiterminology that is left unexplained, other commentscited in the Haqa1iq al-tafsircould be characterized as homiletic, especially whencompared to the reticence in this area of other types of commentaries that confinethemselves to the interpretative tradition.TheHaqa1iq al-tafsirwas recognized almost immediately as representing avery different approach to understanding the Qur1an, an approach deemed unac-ceptable by some. Al-Sulami’s near contemporary, the Qur1anic scholar al-Wahidi(d. 1076), said, “If al-Sulamithinks that this is a tafsir, he is an infidel.”23In hisTalbisiblis, Ibn al-Jawziwrote that 2Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami’sHaqa1iq al-tafsircontains astonishing examples of Sufiexegesis “which occur to them without theCOMMENTARY70"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"supports of any of the fundamentals of knowledge,”24and he quotes numerousexamples from it in order to point out the errors of Sufiexegesis. Critical judg-ments of the Haqa1iq al-tafsirwere also made by such later scholars such as IbnTaymiyya, Shams al-Din al-Dhahabi(d. 1348), and Abu1l Fadl2Abd al-Rahmanal-Suyuti(d. 1505).25Al-QushayriAbu1l-Qasim2Abd al-Karim b. Hawazin al-Qushayri(d. 1074) was an Arab fromNortheastern Iran who studied with al-Sulamiafter his primary spiritual teacherand father-in-law, Abu2Alial-Daqqaq, died.26Upon meeting his first teacher, al-Qushayriabandoned his life as a wealthy landowner, and, at the urging of histeacher, adopted the life of a scholar of hadithand Ash2aritheology. This quiet lifewas interrupted when the Saljuqs began to persecute al-Qushayriand otherprominent and vocal Shafi2i-Ash2aris. Al-Qushayriwas imprisoned for a shorttime before escaping to live in exile, returning to Nisabur only when the politicalsituation became more amenable to Ash2aris.Although al-Qushayriwrote theological works and an exoteric Qur1anic com-mentary, his fame rests upon his Sufiworks. The most famous of these is Al-risala fi2ilm al-tasawwuf, considered by Sufis to be the classic formulation oftheir doctrine. His expressed purpose in writing the book was to reconfirm theorthodoxy of Sufism against those Sufis who no longer observed the religiouslaw (shari2a). Al-Qushayriwas a cautious writer, avoiding the type of excessivestatements attributed to al-Hallaj and other Sufis; consequently, his Suficom-mentary, the Lata1if al-isharat, has never been attacked in the manner of the com-mentaries of al-Sulamiand al-Kashani.TheLata1if al-isharatconsists of al-Qushayri’s own comments on Qur1anicverses as well as anonymous Sufisayings. According to Basyuni, the editor of acritical six-volume edition,27al-Qushayri’s goal in writing this tafsirwas to helphis fellow Sufis and, as such, is a better example of his school of thought than theRisala.28Although many of the elements found in al-Sulami1sHaqa1iq al-tafsirare present here, al-Qushayriavoids the extensive use of Sufiterminology andfar-reaching wordplay and allegory, instead adopting a consistently homileticalstyle. Al-Qushayrisearches Qur1anic verses for something to inspire the readerwhether those verses are parts of narratives or religious legislation. The qualitiesof the prophets become lessons for the aspiring mystic. A verse on the distribu-tion of booty prompts al-Qushayrito comment on the booty to be enjoyed whenone succeeds in capturing the soul from the enemies of passion and Satan.29Foreshadowing al-Ghazali’sIhya1 2ulum al-din, al-Qushayricontinually stressesthe importance of the inner aspect of acts of worship, the need to go beyond merebodily compliance to discover layers of meaning in these acts.30As Basyunipoints out, al-Qushayri’s method is more literary than intellectual,a fact which he attributes to the Sufiemphasis on “tasting” (dhawq) and an appre-ciation for the inimitability (2ijaz) of the Qur1an. This method is apparent in theSÁFICOMMENTATORS ON THE QUR1AN71"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"attention al-Qushayripays to individual words and phrases, drawing upon theroots of the language, etymology, inflections and rhetoric.31In addition to show-ing his appreciation for the literary subtleties of the Qur1anic text, al-Qushayriresponds himself to the text in a literary manner by the use of elegant prose,metaphors, and poetry.32AbuHamid al-GhazaliAbuHamid Muhammad b. Muhammad al-Tusial-Ghazaliwas born in Tus nearpresent day Mashhad in Iran.33His studies brought him to Nisabur as a young manwhere he studied with the prominent Shafi2ijurist and Ash2aritheologian Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni(d. 1085), a colleague of al-Qushayri. Al-Ghazaliresided inthe court of the Saljuq vizier Nizam al-Mulk until he was appointed as rector andprofessor at the Nizamiyamadrasain Baghdad. Four years later he resigned fromthis prestigious position as the result of a personal crisis that he later described inhis intellectual autobiography, Al-Munqidh min al-Dalal, which also details al-Ghazali’s disenchantment with theology, philosophy and Isma2ilism, and his con-sequent adoption of Sufism. Al-Ghazalispent the next ten years in practicing andstudyingSufism in Damascus, Mecca and Medina before returning to his home-town. He taught once again in Nisabur before he died in Tus in 1111.Al-Ghazaliis said to have written over 400 works, of which about 70 are extantmanuscripts. His writings cover a broad range of the intellectual sciences of theclassical Islamic world. Among his early works is an exposition of Islamicphilosophers entitled Maqasid al-falasifa, which was followed by a criticism ofthe same in the Ta hafut al-falasifa. Among his juridical works is Al-Mustasfamin2ilm al-usul al-fiqh, a work which is still used as a textbook on the sources ofIslamic law today.

The Iljam al-2awamm2an2ilmal-kalam, written at the very end of al-Ghazali’s life, expresses his reservationsabout the study of theology. Among al-Ghazali’sSufiworks is the Ihya1 2ulumal-din, a four-volume book that attempts, as its title announces, “the revivificationof the religious sciences.” Borrowing extensively from AbuTalib al-Makki’sQutal-qulub, al-Ghazalireorganized and amplified this material into a systematicwork written in a clear and lucid style, addressing the topics of knowledge, worship,and behavior from a pietistic and mystical standpoint. His shorter works includeAl-Risala al-laduniyya, a treatise dealing with the distinctive epistemology ofSufism, the Jawahir al-Qur1ancontaining various theories regarding the Qur1anand its interpretation, and the Mishkat al-anwar, a short hermeneutical andexegetical work concerning the Light Verse of the Qur1an and the Veils hadith.Al-Ghazaliis said to have written a forty-volume commentary on the Qur1an aswell, but an extant copy has yet to be found.34Al-Ghazali’s commentary on the Light Verse in the Mishkat al-anwaris,unique among the Sufis studied here in the extent to which it combines theoryand exegesis.35If al-Ghazaliabandoned philosophy and theology as a means forCOMMENTARY72"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"attaining truth, he nonetheless continued to employ their analytical and logicaltools in his writing. We need not go so far as Ibn Taymiyya in saying, “Ghazaliwent into the belly of the philosophers (falasifa) and when he wished to come outhe was unable to do so,”36but it could be said that al-Ghazali’s contribution toSufiexegesis is more intellectual than poetic and literary, as it is with al-Qushayriand al-Maybudi. However, he writes in a very accessible and non-obscure manner,and therefore functions quite effectively as an apologist for Sufitheory. The styleof the commentary is consistently allegorical, although, as we have seen, al-Ghazalihad distinctive ideas regarding the use of metaphors in the Qur1an.Rashid al-Din al-MaybudiWe know very little of the life of Rashid al-Din Abu’l-Fadl Ahmad al-Maybudi(fl. 1135), the author of the ten-volume commentary Kashf al-asrar wa-2uddatal-abrar.37From his name we know he was from Maybud, a small town near Yazdin central Iran. On the basis of the contents of his commentary, Rokni has concludedthat al-Maybudiwas a Shafi2iSunnihadithscholar who showed his respect for theShi2itradition by quoting 2Ali185 times and other Shi2iimams 68 times.38Al-Maybudiexplained the purpose of his writing the Kashf al-asrarin hisintroduction. He had read and been greatly impressed by the tafsirof2Abd Allahal-Ansarial-Harawi(d. 1089) but was disappointed by its brevity, and so set outto expand it.39Although al-Ansari’s commentary was purely mystical, al-Maybudidecided to add other dimensions of tafsiras well. He divided the Qur1an into read-ing sections (majlisha), and then divided each of these sections into three parts.The first part in each section is a literal Persian paraphrase of the Qur1anic Arabicverses. The second part, the largest of the three parts, is exoteric tafsirwritten inboth Persian and Arabic which addresses philological, narrative, juridical, andtheological issues as found in the transmitted salafiand post-salafiexegeticaltradition. The third part, also written in both Persian and Arabic, contains whatal-Maybudicalls “symbols” (rumuz), “allusions” (isharat) and “subtleties”(lata1if),40and it is this part that makes his tafsirdistinctive.TheKashf al-asrarhas sometimes been called the tafsirof Khwaja2Abd Allahal-Ansari, but, in fact, al-Ansariis only one of the sources al-Maybudiused in thethird part of his tafsir. When al-Maybudiquotes al-Ansari, he sometimes refersto him by name and sometimes calls him “the spiritual guide of the way” (pir-itariqat), or “the learned one of the way” (2alim-itariqat). Al-Maybudi’s otherprimary source for this part of his tafsiris the Lata1if al-isharatof al-Qushayriwho is quoted or paraphrased anonymously in Arabic or in Persian translation.Other sources must have been used as well for the sayings and interpretationsattributed to early Sufis which he includes. Böwering states that, at least in thecase of those sayings attributed to Sahl al-Tustari, the material appears to havebeen taken from AbuNasr al-Sarraj’sKitab al-luma2, AbuTalib al-Makki’sQutal-qulub, and the hagiographical work, Hilyat al-awliya1wa-tabaqat al-asfiya1ofAbuNu2aym al-Isfahani(d. 1038).41SÁFICOMMENTATORS ON THE QUR1AN73"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Rokni has identified three different types of interpretation within this third partof al-Maybudi’sKashf al-asrar.42The first kind he calls ta1wil, by which hemeans interpretation that uncovers Sufidoctrines and beliefs in Qur1anic verses.Rokni illustrates this with al-Maybudi’s commentary on verses 2:67–71, in whichMusacommands his people, on God’s behalf, to sacrifice a heifer and they ques-tion him regarding what kind of cow this might be. The qualities of the cow to besacrificed are taken as an allusion to the qualities needed for the mystical aspi-rant. Another kind of ta1wil, according to Rokni, is the juxtaposition of Sufiter-minology with Qur1anic verses. His example is the commentary on Qur1an 3:31.Al-Maybudicompares the first part of this verse, Say,“If you love God,” to theSuficoncept of dispersion (tafriqa) and the second part, “God will love you,” tothe concept of union (jam2).The second kind of interpretation that Rokni identifies in al-Maybudi1sSufiexegesis is homiletic elucidation (tawdih. . . bi-ravish-i majlis-i ghuyan vakhutaba1). Adopting the style of preachers, al-Maybudiuses rhymed prose, poetry,puns, stories, similes, and metaphors to exhort and inspire the believer. Thesubject matter might be the inward qualities and outward practices of the believer,the stations of the prophets, or God’s glory. It is in this kind of interpretation thatal-Maybudi’s literary skills are most apparent, and as Rokni points out, the valueof the Kashf al-asrarlies in its mystical and literary aspects, its Sufita1wil, andits homilies.Rokni’s third type of interpretation occurs less frequently. He calls it tashqiq,by which he means the way in which al-Maybudibreaks apart a Qur1anic verseand then expands these various parts by means of related verses, hadith, or poetry.As an example he cites al-Maybudi’s commentary on Qur1an 3:191, those whoremember God standing, sitting and on their sides, in which al-Maybudiidenti-fies three different types of people who remember God. The first type remembersGod with the tongue while forgetting Him in the heart. This is the remembrance(dhikr) of the unjust. The second type remembers God with the tongue and apresent heart. Yet he seeks reward, so this is the remembrance of those who adopta middle way. The third type remembers God with a heart full of Him, while histongue has become silent as one who knows God. This is the remembrance ofthose who have outdistanced all others (sabiqun).43Ruzbihan al-BaqliAbuMuhammad Ruzbihan b. AbiNasr al-Baqlibegan his life in the Persian townof Fasa(Pasain Persian), where he was born, as he put it in his autobiography, “toignorant folk who were a prey to drunkenness and error, gross and vulgar menlike unto ‘startled asses fleeing before a lion’ (Koran 74:50–1).”44He claims tohave experienced mystical states beginning in childhood, states which increasedin intensity until he fled into the desert as a young man, and was overwhelmeddaily by visions in which he perceived the heavens and the earth as pure light.Following this period, he lived with Sufis and began to balance his extraordinaryCOMMENTARY74"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"experiences by studying the exoteric sciences of Islam as a Shafi1iand an Ash2ari.Most of his life was spent in Shiraz, where he established a Sufilodge and afollowing, and died in 1209.Ruzbihan wrote over forty works in Arabic and Persian dealing with bothexoteric and Sufitopics, many of which are no longer extant or exist only infragmentary form. Among those which have been published in critical editions, atleast in part, are the aforementioned autobiography, Kashf al-asrar,45the2Abharal-2ashiqin46which presents Ruzbihan’s theories on love and beauty, the Sharh-ishathiyat47containing the ecstatic sayings of al-Hallaj and other Sufis, and the2Ara1is al-bayan fihaqa1iq al-Qur1an, his Suficommentary on the Qur1an.The2Ara1is al-bayanhas been published so far only in lithographic form,comprising two large volumes in the edition used for this study.48Alan Godlas iscurrently working on a critical edition and English translation of this work.49Thecommentary on each Qur1anic verse begins with Ruzbihan’s own exegesis,followed by quotations from al-Sulami1sHaqa1iq al-tafsirandZiyadathaqa1iqal-tafsir, and al-Qushayri1sLata1if al-isharat. The style of Ruzbihan1s commentsis quite distinct from the Sufis he quotes. Jami(d. 1492) remarked on its diffi-culty, saying, “he has sayings that have poured forth from him in the state of over-powering and ecstasy, which not everyone can understand.”50The Moghul princeDaraShikuh (d. 1659) was impressed enough with Ruzbihan’s writings to havewritten an abridgement and update of his Sharh-i shathiyat, and to have hadRuzbihan’s Qur1anic commentary translated into Persian, yet he found his style“fatiguing.”51On the other hand, modern scholars have noted the literary meritsof Ruzbihan’s writings. Mu2in writes,His speech is like a rose that flutters apart once grasped in the hand, orlike an alchemical substance that turns into vapor when barely heated.His language is the language of perceptions; he praises the beautiful andbeauty, and loves them both.52Similarly, Schimmel writes,What so profoundly impresses the reader in Ruzbihan’s writings, both inhis commentary on the Shathiyatand his 2Abhar al-2ashiqin–“Le Jasmindes fidèles d’amour,” as Henri Corbin translates its title – is his style,which is at times as hard to translate as that of Ahmad Ghazzaliand pos-sesses a stronger and deeper instrumentation. It is no longer the scholasticlanguage of the early exponents of Sufism, who tried to classify stages andstations, though Baqlisurely knew these theories and the technical terms.It is the language refined by the poets of Iran during the eleventh andtwelfth centuries, filled with roses and nightingales, pliable and colorful.53In his Qur1anic commentary, however, Ruzbihan’s role changes from creator ofsymbols and metaphors to interpreter of those he locates in the Qur1an, and inSÁFICOMMENTATORS ON THE QUR1AN75"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"these interpretations the influence of Sufitheories and technical terms is moreevident, and above all, mystical experience. Unlike the popular homiletical anddidactic style of the commentaries of al-Qushayrior al-Maybudi, Ruzbihan’s isvisionary and esoteric.Al-KashaniOther than the fact that 2Abd al-Razzaq Kamal al-Din b. Abi’l-Ghana1imal-Kashani(or Qashani, Kashior Kasani) came from the province of Kashan inIran and died in 1329, we know little of his life.54He studied logic and philoso-phy as a young man before turning to Sufism, where his philosophical bent foundnew expression in the school of Ibn 2Arabi.55Al-Kashanibecame one of the mostwidely read of the early interpreters of Ibn 2Arabi, having studied with Mu1ayyidal-Din al-Jandi(d. 1291), himself a student of Ibn 2Arabi’s stepson, Sadr al-Dinal-Qunawi(d. 1274). Al-Kashaniwrote an influential commentary on Ibn 2Arabi’sFususal-hikam, a commentary on al-Ansari’sAl-Sa1irin, and a dictionary oftechnical terms, the Istilahat al-Sufiyya, which explains the terms found in hisown and other Sufis’ writings. His Qur1anic commentary, the Ta1wilat al-Qur1anhas been published several times in two large volumes inaccurately attributed toIbn2Arabi.56It has been shown that, in fact, al-Kashanihad an attitude towards exegesis verydifferent from Ibn 2Arabi. The school of Ibn 2Arabi, beginning with al-Qunawi,focused on the more philosophical and abstract areas of Ibn 2Arabi’s thought,reducing if not eliminating Ibn 2Arabi’s strong emphasis on the role of imagina-tion and Islamic practice.57Al-Kashaniwas no exception here. As Morris writes,Kashani’s Koranic commentaries, like his other books, are all clearly dis-tinguished by a thoroughgoing pedagogical concern and didactic proce-dure that is manifested in such interrelated characteristics as theirrigorous systematization, the clarification and simplification of vocabu-lary (especially if compared with Ibn 2Arabi), and the conceptualization(often in an openly reductionistic manner) of what were originally mul-tivalent symbols. These tendencies are not merely stylistic particulari-ties; they also reflect a shift in the content and underlying intentions ofKashani’s writing (when compared with Ibn 2Arabi) that brought himvery close to the prevailing systems of Avicennan philosophy (especiallyin their interpretations of the phenomena and claims of Sufism) andrelated schools of kalam – to such a degree that their verbal formulationsare sometimes virtually indistinguishable.58Morris judges al-Kashani’s commentary as an aberration from the usual normsofSufiexegesis, replacing personal spiritual realization with “theapplicationtothe Koran of a coherent metaphysical system.”59Whereas Ibn 2Arabiemphasizedthe primacy of knowledge by unveiling (kashf) over reason (2aql), MorrisCOMMENTARY76"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"suggests that al-Kashanialters or even reverses this perspective. The result is “asort of allegorical reduction of the complex symbolism of the Koran and hadithto a single (or at most twofold) plane of reference.”60What Morris is responding to here is al-Kashani1s primary methodology, whichis that of finding correspondences between Qur1anic verses and spiritual psychologyand the stages of an individual’s spiritual path. According to Lory, this is themethodology al-Kashanicallstatbiq.61Al-Kashaniis not the first commentator touse this technique, but he is the first to use it so extensively and exclusively,and the first to apply it to entire passages of the Qur1an. It is this method thatinvites the charge of allegorical reductionism, and yet, however one judges theresults, this does not appear to have been al-Kashani’s intention. We have alreadyseen how he characterizes the Qur1an in the introduction to his commentary as asea containing endless treasures to be found and ta1wilas a process of ever chang-ing interpretation related to the ever changing states of the reader.62Al-NisaburiNizam al-Din b. al-Hasan al-Khurasanial-Nisaburi(d. 1327), known as Nizamthe Lame, was born and lived in Nisabur.63He was a renowned scholar who wroteon subjects ranging from astronomy and mathematics to morphology andQur1anic recitation. His most important work was his Qur1anic commentary,Ghara1ib al-Qur1an wa ragha1ib al-furqan, printed in thirty parts in twelvevolumes.64TheGhara1ib al-Qur1an, like al-Maybudi’sKashf al-asrar, divides theQur1an into sections made up of both exoteric and Suficommentary. After quot-ing a group of Qur1anic verses, al-Nisaburigives different readings (qira1at) andrecitation pauses and stops (wuquf). This is followed by commentary (tafsir)primarily derived from al-Razi’sAl-Tafsir al-kabir, as well as al-Zamakhshari’sAl-Kashshaf2anhaqa1iq al-tanziland other commentaries. These sources arequoted without attribution throughout most of the commentary, althoughal-Nisaburiacknowledges his debt to al-Raziand al-Zamakhshariin the intro-duction and names a few additional sources in a postscript. He also states in hispostscript that the final part of each section, entitled ta1wil, was taken mostly fromthetafsirof the SufiNajm al-Din al-RaziDaya (d. 1256).65Daya was a disciple of the founder of the Kubrawiorder, Najm al-Din al-Kubra,who is said to have begun a commentary on the Qur1an that he was unable tocomplete before his death, a commentary that ends in sura51. A number of man-uscripts credit Daya with the work, and it is therefore unclear to what degree thiscommentary was co-authored or revised by him. The commentary of 2Alaal-Dawla al-Simnani(d. 1336), also from the Kubrawiorder, contains an intro-duction and commentary on the first surafollowed by commentary from sura52to the end of the Qur1an. It exists independently and as a work appended to thetafsirof Kubraand Daya. This collective work of the Kubrawiorder is sometimescalledAl-Ta1wilat al-najmiyya.

In general however, al-Nisaburiis lessphilosophical and theoretical than al-Kashaniand often demonstrates a morelyrical response to the Qur1anic text. In the introduction to his commentary,al-Nisaburiprovides a context to understand ta1wilas part of the methodology of“extracting many issues from brief expressions” (istinbatal-masa1il al-kathiramin al-alfazal-qalila). These issues pertain to either topics of wording or content.Included in the first are matters related to recitation (qira1a), lexicology(lugha), etymology (2ilm al-ishtiqaq), morphology (2ilm al-harf), grammar (2ilmal-nahw), and rhetoric (2ilm al-badi1). Included in the second are matters relatedto meanings (ma2ani), explanation (bayan), deduction (istidlal), the fundamentalsof religion (usul al-din), the fundamentals of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh),jurisprudence (fiqh), and the science of mystical states (2ilm al-ahwal).

Inthis case there is an evidence for the latter in a hadithtransmitted on the authorityof the Jewish convert Ubayy b. Ka2b (d. 642), a hadithwhich identifies the servantof God mentioned in these verses as al-Khadir (or al-Khidr), “the green man.”Early Western scholars attempted to identify external sources for the Qur1anicstory and found common features in the Gilgamesh epic, the Alexander romance,and the Jewish legend of Elijah and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi.1While Wensinckclaimed that the Qur1anic story is derived from Jewish legend,2Wheeler hasdemonstrated more recently that it is, in fact, the Jewish legend that can be tracedto Arabic sources.3He states that the common narrative elements isolated byWensinck and earlier scholars conflate the Qur1anic version with material fromlater Qur1anic commentaries. For example, the theme of the water of eternal life,common to the Gilgamesh epic and the Alexander romance, is mentioned explic-itly in the story of Musaand Khahir only in the commentaries and not in theQur1an itself. Wheeler views the appropriation of themes from earlier sources aspart of a purposeful interpretative strategy for uncovering meaning rather than asan attempt to “get the story straight.” It should be pointed out, however, that whileWheeler attributes these narrative elements to Qur1anic commentators, the classicalcommentators themselves attribute details such as the water of eternal life and thesalted fish that comes to life to the Prophet himself through the hadithattributedto Ubayy b. Ka2b, giving them a near canonical status.Thehadithrelated from Ubayy b. Ka2b contextualizes the Qur1anic narrative byexplaining the reason for Musa’s journey.

He said, “The one who remembers Me and does not forget Me.”Musasaid, “And which of your servants is most judicious?” He said,“The one who judges by the truth and does not follow his own inclination(hawa).

It will rock in the waves with him until the Day of Resurrectionand that is because it was not for him to drink from it but he did.”11As for al-Khadir’s immortality, it is not mentioned in al-Tabari’stafsir, but canbe found in his Ta1rikh al-rusul wa1l-mulukwhere he mentions reports thatal-Khadir drank from the water of life and became immortal and that he meetsthe Prophet Ilyas (Elijah) every year in Mecca during the pilgrimage season.12Al-Qurtubispends three and half pages discussing the matter of al-Khadir’simmortality in his tafsir. He writes that most people believe that al-Khadir diedon the basis of a hadiththat states that not a soul living at the time of the Prophetwould be alive 100 years after his death. Al-Qurtubi, however, sides with thosewho interpret this as a general statement for which there are exceptions, includ-ing al-Khadir, 2Isa(Jesus), Ilyas, and the Dajjal (Antichrist). Although the hadithstates that “no on will remain on the earth (ard),” al-Qurtubiargues that ardhererefers only to the Arab world. He finds additional support for al-Khadir’s immor-tality in traditions that mention the yearly pilgrimage of al-Khadir and Ilyas toMecca, and a treatise attributed to al-Qushayrithat contains many reports frompious men and women who have seen and met al-Khadir. Additionally, 2Aliis saidto have received a private prayer (du2a1) directly from al-Khadir. A hadithin theSahihof Muslim tells of the Dajjal’s meeting with the best of men at the end oftime, and al-Qurtubicites those who identify this man as al-Khadir and who saythat the Dajjal will finally end al-Khadir’s long life. As always, though, he admitsthat “God knows best.”13Although al-Khadir1s immortality is often mentioned in other Sufiworks,especially in his role as a spiritual initiator,14this idea is not mentioned in the Suficommentaries studied here. Instead, the focus on al-Khadir concerns the knowl-edge which he is said to have possessed, knowledge received directly from God(2ilm laduni).2Ilm laduniIn non-Suficommentaries, exegetes attempt to clarify ambiguous or difficultwords and phrases and to explain variant readings of the text.

Indiscussing a passage from al-Qushayri’sal-Risalathat lists various definitions forthe term Sufism, Ernst writes[the definitions] accomplish a powerful rhetorical transaction; the personwho listens to or reads these definitions is forced to imagine the spiritualor ethical quality that is invoked by the definition, even when it isparadoxical.15The definitions in Suficommentaries for 2ilm laduniserve this function, beingdidactic rather than descriptive or explanatory. In commenting on the knowledgethat God taught al-Khadirfrom Our very presence(ladunna), al-Tabari, as wehave seen, compares the inner and outer aspects of the knowledge possessedby al-Khadir and Musa.Sufis commentators provide much more extendeddefinitions and meditations on this type of knowledge.Al-Tustaridefines al-Khadir’s special knowledge as inspiration (ilham),understood as a kind of revelation (wahy) that is not restricted to prophets:Inspiration (ilham) acts as a substitute for revelation (wahy), just as Hesaid, and your Lord revealed(awha) to the bees (16:68)16andWe revealedto the mother of Musa(28:7).17Both of these were inspiration (ilham).18After al-Tustari, numerous tenth-century Sufis are quoted in the commentaries of al-Sulamiand Ruzbihan al-Baqliwith different definitions of 2ilm laduni. According toIbn2Ata,2ilm laduniis not book learning, but knowledge from the Unseen:[It is] knowledge by unveilings (kushuf), not by the dictation of letters.Rather, the place to encounter it is in witnessing (mushahada) the spirits(arwah).19For al-Qasim (d. 953–4),202ilm laduniis bestowed rather than acquired knowledge.The knowledge of deduction (istinbat) comes with exertion (kulfa) andintermediaries but 2ilm ladunicomes without these.21Not only is this knowledge not from this world, it distracts one from anythingother than its source in the Unseen, bringing about a total absorption in God.Al-Shiblisaid, “[and to whom We had taught]knowledgethat made himpreoccupied with Us from anything other than Us.” It is said, “it directs himto Us and cuts him off from created things or anything concerning them.”22This early material is confirmed and expanded upon in the eleventh-centurycommentary of al-Qushayri. He adds that this is knowledge reserved for God’sQUR1ANIC VERSES 18:60–8283"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"elite, but as a benefit for all believers. Al-Qushayri’s definitions also illustrate theinherent tension between Sufibeliefs and traditional theology, since 2ilm ladunitakes precedence over the proofs of rational thought.It is said that knowledge from the very presence (min ladun) of God issomething that is obtained by means of inspiration (ilham) without beingburdened by seeking (tatallub).One can say that it is that which God (al-haqq) teaches the elite(khawass) among His servants.One can also say that it is something that God (al-haqq) teaches Hisfriends (awliya1) according to what is appropriate in it for His servants.It is said that it is something whose benefit does not belong to itspossessor, but rather that which is in it from the truth of God belongs toHis servants.One can also say that it is something that its possessor cannot find away to deny. Evidence (dalil) of soundness would be what one findsdefinitively, but if you were to ask him about his proof (burhan) he willnot be able to produce any evidence (dalil), for the most powerful kindsof knowledge are those which are farthest from evidence (dalil).23Although several of these definitions seek to define 2ilm laduniin relation toother types of knowledge, none do so systematically. This task was taken up byal-Raziin his commentary on the verse, beginning with a rebuttal to those whobelieved that 2ilm ladunicould only be bestowed on a prophet. For the exegeteswho believe al-Khadir was a prophet, the fact that God describes him as one towhom We taught knowledge from Our very presence(ladunna)requires that God taught him without the intermediary of the instruction ofa teacher and the spiritual guidance (irshad) of a spiritual guide (murshid).Any person whom God teaches without the intermediary of a human beingmust be a prophet who knows things by means of revelation (wahy).24We have already seen that this issue is a contentious one, with those like Ibnal-Jawziand Ibn Taymiyya insisting that only prophets can receive knowledgedirectly from God. Al-Razidisagrees, claiming that there are many types ofknowledge that come to man directly without an intermediary.This deduction (istidlal) is weak because different types of necessaryknowledge (al-2ulum al-daruriyya) are obtained initially from God, butthat does not indicate prophecy.25The term “necessary or self-evident knowledge” (2ilmdaruri) refers to sensory(hissi) knowledge from both internal and external sensory perceptions; intuitive(badihi) knowledge of self-evident truths such as the fact of one’s existence andCOMMENTARY84"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"the fact that one half of two is one; and information established by multiplereports (mutawatir). It is usually contrasted with acquired knowledge (2ilmmuktasaborkasbi), which consists of rational (2aqli) and religious (shar2i)knowledge.26Although al-Razicompares2ilm ladunito2ilmdarurifor the sake ofhis argument here, he classifies 2ilm laduniamong the types of knowledge thatare acquired (2ulum kasbiyya). Al-Razi mentions that al-Ghazalihas a treatiseconcerning God-given types of knowledge (2ulum al-laduniyya), and al-Raziproceeds to “verify what has been said regarding this matter.”27He begins bysaying that we become aware of things either by conceptualization (tasawwur) orassent (tasdiq). Each of these types of perception, in turn, are either considerative(nazari) or acquired (kasbi).28Considerative types of knowledge (al-2ulum al-nazariyya) are obtainedin the soul (nafs) and intellect (2aql) without acquisition (kasb) or study(talab), like our conceptualization (tasawwur) of pain and pleasure, andexistence and nonexistence; and our assent (tasdiq) that negation andaffirmation cannot coexist nor be mutually eliminated, and that one ishalf of two.Acquired types of knowledge (al-2ulum al-kasbiyya) are those thatcannot be initially obtained in the substance of the soul (jawhar al-nafs)but rather their acquisition must be arrived at by means of some path.This path has two parts. One of them is where man combines theseconsiderative and intuitive types of knowledge (al-2ulum al-badihiyyaal-nazariyya) until he reaches knowledge of unknown things. This wayis called consideration (nazar), reflection (tafakkur), pondering (tadab-bur), contemplation (ta1ammul), deliberation (tarawwin), and deduction(istidlal). This mode of obtaining different types of knowledge is thepath that can only be completed by effort and study.The second mode [of obtaining types of knowledge] is when manstrives by means of spiritual disciplines (riyadat) and efforts (mujahadat)in which the sensual and imaginative faculties (al-quwwat al-hissiyawa1l-khayaliyya) become weak. When they become weak the power ofthe rational faculty (al-quwwat al-2aqliyya) becomes strong and thedivine lights shine in the substance of the intellect (jawhar al-2aql).Gnostic sciences (ma2arif) are obtained and different types of knowledge(2ulum) are perfected without the intermediary of effort or study inreflecting and contemplation. These are what are called the God-giventypes of knowledge (al-2ulum al-laduniyya).29If the treatise written by al-Ghazalithat al-Razirefers to is, in fact, Al-Risalatal-laduniyyathat has come down to us,30al-Razihas stripped al-Ghazali’sdescription of 2ilm laduniof its Neoplatonic terminology.In al-Ghazali’s work, the acquisition of knowledge is said to be achieved eitherby human (insani) or divine (rabbani) teaching.31When it is the latter, it may beQUR1ANIC VERSES 18:60–8285"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"either an internal or an external process. The internal process is the process ofreflection (tafakkur). Reflection (tafakkur) differs from knowledge gained byhuman teaching because reflection is what one gains from the Universal Soul(al-nafs al-kulli), while learning from another human being is confined to whatone gains from a particular individual. When the divine (rabbani) teachinginvolves an external process, this will either be revelation (wahy) or inspiration(ilham). When it is revelation, the teacher is the Universal Intellect (al-2aqlal-kulli)32and knowledge is inscribed within the sanctified soul (al-nafsal-qudsiyya) without learning or reflection. According to al-Ghazali, revelation(wahy) is reserved for prophets alone.Revelation (wahy) is engendered from the emanation (ifada) of the Universalmind (al-2aql al-kulli), while inspiration (ilham) is engendered from the illumination(ishraq) of the Universal Soul (al-nafs al-kulli).33Inspiration is the awakening ofthe individual human soul by the Universal Soul according to the degree of itspurity and receptivity (qabul), and the strength of its preparedness (isti2dad). Theknowledge received from this process, which occurs in both prophets and saints,is called God-given knowledge (2ilm laduni), and is the type of knowledge thatal-Khadir received.What is common to the theories presented by al-Raziand al-Ghazalihere is theway in which they seek to confirm the possibility of individuals who are notprophets acquiring God-given types of knowledge (al-2ulum al-laduniyya); thisvalidation is accomplished by incorporating 2ilm laduniinto existing philosophicaland theological epistemological frameworks. Using the verse on al-Khadir’sknowledge as a proof-text, al-Raziand al-Ghazaliprovide a theoretical frame-work for the Sufi’s belief in knowledge through inspiration (ilham). It is an expo-sitional and apologetic approach that differs from Suficommentaries that takethis form of knowledge as a given. Although all of the Suficommentators stud-ied here understood 2ilm ladunias a kind of knowledge that might be received bythe rare individual, none of them addressed the issue of whether these individu-als, like al-Khadir, are entitled or even obliged to follow a different set of rulesthan the common believer. But apparently there were those who did propose suchan argument, and al-Qurtubiattacks them in his tafsirnot only for believing thatthey could receive knowledge by any means other than the prophets, but espe-cially for claiming that this special knowledge frees them from the need to followthe religious law.34Our shaykh, Imam Abu1l-2Abbas said that the esotericist heretics(zanadiqa al-batiniyya) are of the opinion that traveling a path requiresthese religious precepts but they say, “These general religious preceptsare only imposed upon the stupid and the common. As for the friends ofgod (awliya1) and elect (ahl al-khusus), they don’t need these texts;the only thing meant for them is what happens in their hearts and theyare ruled by whatever seizes them in their thoughts.” They say, “Thatis because of the purity of their hearts from all kinds of turbidityCOMMENTARY86"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"and the freedom of their hearts from all others, so that the divine kindsof knowledge (al-2ulum al-ilahiyya) and lordly realities (haqa1iqal-rabbaniyya) are disclosed to them and they understand the secrets ofcreated things. They know the principles of individual things and bymeans of them they are able to dispense with universal religious princi-ples just as happened with al-Khadir. Because of what was disclosed tohim from different types of knowledge, he was able to dispense with theunderstanding Musahad of these things.” Included in what they havetransmitted is, “Seek the legal opinion of your heart even if the Muftisgive a legal opinion for you.”Regarding that, our shaykh said that this is the talk of heresy(zandaqa) and infidelity (kufr), the proponent of which should be killedwithout being given a chance to seek repentance, because it is a denialof what is known from the religious laws. Truly God has imposed hispractice (sunna) and implemented his wisdom through his preceptswhich can only be known by means of His messengers who mediatebetween Him and His creation. They convey His message and word fromHim explaining His religious laws and precepts. They have been chosenfor that just as He said, God chooses messengers from angels and frommen. Truly, He is Hearing, Seeing(22:75). He also said, God well knowswhere to place His message(6:124), and Mankind was a single commu-nity and God sent prophets to give glad tidings and warn(2:213) inaddition to other verses.In sum, definitive knowledge (al-2ilm al-qat2i), necessary certainty (al-yaqin al-daruri) and the consensus (ijma1) of the pious predecessors anddescendants all agree on the fact that there is no way that anyone can haveknowledge of the precepts of God referring to His command and prohi-bition except by way of the messengers. And the one who says, “Here isanother way by which to know His command and prohibition without themessengers,” so that he dispenses with them, is an infidel (kafir) whoshould be killed. His repentance should not be sought and there is noneed for questions and answers from him. It is a belief in the perpetua-tion of prophets after our Prophet whom God has made the seal of Hisprophets and messengers. There is no prophet or messenger after him.35Al-Qurtubi would seem to be denying the possibility of what al-Raziand al-Ghazalidefended, 2ilm ladunireceived by those who are not prophets, at leastwith regards to knowledge of God’s commands and prohibitions. But al-Qurtubidoes not deny the possibility of there being friends of God (awliya1) to whomcharismatic acts (karamat) occur. Although he agrees with other exegetes who saythat al-Khadir was a prophet, al-Qurtubinonetheless uses him as a starting pointfor discussing charismatic acts (karamat) occurring in individuals who are notprophets, and the question of whether it is permissible for a friend of God (wali)to know that he is a friend of God.36In the latter discussion, al-QurtubiquotesQUR1ANIC VERSES 18:60–8287"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Sufihagiographical material approvingly,37demonstrating that his criticism ofsomeSufis should not be taken as a general condemnation of Sufism.The journeys of MusaThe fact that al-Razidescribes2ilm ladunias acquired knowledge that requires spir-itual disciplines (riyadat) and efforts (mujahadat) on the part of those seeking it doesnot contradict the Sufis who say that it comes without exertion or seeking. Theircomments refer to the actual bestowal of the knowledge from God, whereas al-Razi1scomments refer to the preparation needed to receive this knowledge. According totheSufis, the difficulties that Musaunderwent in his journey to and with al-Khadir,were part of the process of learning proper behavior (ta1dib). Their comments in thisarea demonstrate another distinctive characteristic of Sufiexegesis, one that seeks touncover the edifying potential of the characters and events described in the Qur1an ina manner similar to that of preachers. They place Musa’s journey with al-Khadir inthe context of the other journeys in his life, and compare this to the different states(ahwal) and stations (maqamat) through which a spiritual seeker continually moves.The fact that al-Khadir possessed 2ilm laduni, while Musadid not, at least not at thatpoint in his life, relates to their different stations.Faris38said:Musasaid, “God willing” about himself in “You will find mepatient, God willing,” but al-Khadir did not do the same when he said,“You will not be able to be patient with me,” because the knowledge ofMusaat that time was the knowledge of what religious law has prescribedand deduction (istidlal), but the knowledge of al-Khadir was God-givenknowledge (2ilm laduni) from one unseen to another. Musawas in the sta-tion (maqam) of learning proper behavior (ta1dib) while al-Khadir was inthe station (maqam) of unveiling (kashf) and witnessing (mushahada).39Musa’s task in this journey, however, was not to learn about states, but rather tolearn about proper behavior, and this could not be achieved by asking questions.In response to al-Khadir’s request to Musa,If you follow me, do not ask me any-thing until I myself mention it to you, al-Husri40is said to have said,There was no way to learn the knowledge of al-Khadir from a place ofquestioning. Musacame to him to learn proper behavior (ta2dib), not forinstruction regarding any particular state (hal).41While the purpose of the journey with al-Khadir was to learn proper behavior,al-Qushayripoints out that this was not the case in the journey of Musato MountSinai, nor when he set out into the desert fleeing from Pharoah.In this journey Musawas the one who carried a burden (mutahammil).It was a journey to learn proper behavior (ta1dib) and to endure difficultyCOMMENTARY88"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"because he had gone to ask for greater knowledge, and the state (hal) ofseeking knowledge is the state (hal) of learning proper behavior (ta1dib)and a time for bearing difficulty.

Thisis not as it was when he watered [the animals] for the daughtersof Shu2ayb, for the toil and hunger that afflicted him [in the search foral-Khadir] was greater. In that time he was the one who was carried (mah-mul) while this time he was the carrier of the burden (mutahammil).43Al-Qushayri’s analysis here of the different journeys of Musais not original. In2Ara1is al-majalis fiqisasal-anbiya1, a book on the stories of the prophets, AhmadAbuIshaq al-Tha2labi(d. 1036) states that wise men (hukama1) have said thatMusahad a total of five journeys. The first of these was the journey of escape(harab) after killing a man in Egypt (Qur1an 26:21). The second was the journeytoTur where Musasaw a fire and heard a voice (Qur1an 27:8 and 28:30). Thethird was the journey of seeking (talab) when he left Egypt with his people(Qur1an 20:77). The fourth was the journey of war (harb) when he exhortedhis people to enter the Holy Land (Qur1an 5:27). The fifth was the journey ofhardship (nasab) and this was his journey to find al-Khadir.44While the stories found in the genre of qisasal-anbiya1were viewed with somesuspicion, their engaging details and style led some commentators to loosen theirstandards of authenticity so as to include excerpts from them.45Al-Qurtubiwasone such commentator whose critical comments on isra1iliyyatmaterial did notkeep him from including some of the more amusing anecdotes from al-Tha2labi1stafsir.46However, the homiletic and literary style considered acceptable and evenpraiseworthy in preaching was not generally accepted within the genre of tafsir,except when it could be shown to be transmitted from traditions whose authen-ticity was unquestioned. In contrast, Sufiexegesis incorporates isra1iliyyatmate-rial and original homiletic and literary material into a style most fully developedin the commentary of Rashid al-Din al-Maybudi. As we have already mentioned,al-Maybudiincorporates a good deal of al-Qushayri’s work in his own tafsir,without attribution, but displays his originality in the way he weaves al-Qushayri’scomments into a decidedly literary format. In al-Maybudi’s version of the jour-neys of Musa, there are four journeys and four rhyming words used to describethem:harab,talab,tarab, andta2ab.Musahad four journeys. The first was the journey of escape (harab) justas God told in the story of Musa,“So I fled from you when I feared you”(26:21).

Hehad killed the Copt, just as the Lord said, Musastruck him and killed him(28:15). How remarkable was the salvation and victory in God’s solici-tude in forgiving him that killing! Musasaid, “The hand of him who hasstruck reaps the harvest,” but He said to Musa, “There was no sin in that.The sin belonged to the devil and that act was from him.”He said, “Thisis the work of Satan” (28:15). Thus the believing servant is excused byHis grace and receives His pardon. He said, Satan made them slip insome of what they earned but indeed God has forgiven them(3:155).God overlooked their sin because that was the whispering of Satan andthe work of the devil.After this there was the journey of searching (talab), the night whenMusawent in search of fire, a fire that was such that the entire worldwould be extinguished by it. The entire world falls in love with every placewhere the tale of the fire of Musahas gone. Musawent in search of fireand found light while the brave youth (javanmard) went in search of lightand found fire. If Musareceived the sweetness of hearing the word of God(haqq) without intermediary, how amazing is it that the smell of thatreaches His friends (dustan)?

The boat which al-Khadir ruins representsthe poverty that one must embrace in order to escape the notice of Satan who isattracted to prosperity and the outward display of one1s religion.49The boy he killsis an allusion (ishara) to the desires and opinions that shoot up in the field of spir-itual discipline (riyada), and struggle (mujahada) that must be cut off becausethis “offspring” will become a disbeliever as it grows.50Finally, the wall whichal-Khadir rebuilds is an allusion (ishara) to the soul at peace (nafs mutma1inna)51that must not be destroyed. The purpose of spiritual effort is to purify the soul, notannihilate it, for the Prophet said, “Your soul has a right over you.”The treasures of the secrets of eternity have been placed underneath it.If the wall of the soul becomes ruined, the treasure of the lordly secretswill fall upon the desert and any feeble idiot will covet it. The secret ofthese words is that the treasure of reality has been placed in the humanqualities and the natural manners of dervishes have been built upon thispartition. This is the very thing that brave youth (javanmard) has said:Religion for dervishes is searching (talab)for it is the custom of kings tobury treasures in deserted places.52In contrast to al-Maybudi’s very readable and didactic style, Ruzbihan’s commen-tary on the story of Musaand al-Khadir is mostly a commentary on the com-mentary of his predecessors, written in a difficult style made all the more obscureby unexplained terminology and concepts.

Hisintention should be to seek a shaykh to emulate, for seeking a shaykh, intruth, is seeking God (al-haqq).The junction of the two seasis the junction of the sanctity (walaya) ofthe saint and the sanctity of the aspirant (murid). There is the real springof life. When a drop of it fell upon the fish, the heart (qalb) of the aspi-rant, it came to life and took its wayin the sea of sanctity (walaya)as ina tunnel.When they had gone on. There is an allusion (ishara) in this to the factthat if the aspirant becomes weary in the course of his travels, his heartwill succumb to exhaustion and he will allow himself to be seduced intorelinquishing the companionship of the shaykh, thinking that his goalcan be obtained by other means. What an idea! This is false and worth-less thinking if the divine solicitude does not reach him and return thesincerity of desire (irada) to him.66The knowledge which al-Khadir possesses is knowledge of the inner nature ofthings (bawatin al-ashya1) and their realities (haqa1iq), a knowledge which can-not be taught but can only be obtained by the purification (tasfiya) of the soul andthe disengagement (tajrid) of the heart from corporeal attachments. This processis illustrated by the allegorical interpretation of al-Khadir’s actions.The scuttling of the ship represents the destruction of one’s outward reputationand one’s pride in devotional acts, for only devotional acts performed in a spiritof brokenness and humility are safe from Satan. The youth killed by al-Khadir isthe commanding soul (al-nafs al-ammara) killed with the knife of spiritual disci-pline (riyada) and the sword of struggle (mujahada). His parents are the heart(qalb) and spirit (ruh) who will receive a better child in his stead, the soul at peace(al-nafs al-mutma1inna). The wall is the attachment (ta2alluq) that acts as a barrierbetween the rational soul (al-nafs al-natiqa) and the world of disengaged things(2alam al-mujarradat). Al-Khadir’s fixing the wall is the strengthening of thebody and kindliness shown to the different faculties (quwa) and senses (hawass),just as it is said, “Your soul is your mount, so be kind to it.” The two orphans arethe soul at peace and the inspired soul (al-nafs al-mutma1inna wa1l-mulhama) andthe treasure waiting for them is the obtainment of theoretical and practical perfec-tions (al-kamalat al-nazariyya wa’l-2amaliyya).

The common objective of all these commentaries, despite theirdifferent styles and methods with regards to the story of Musaand al-Khadir, iswhat al-Ghazalicalls applying the Qur1anic text to oneself (takhsis) and whatal-Simnanicalls recognizing the correspondences between the prophets and thesubtle substances (lata1if) of man.“I wanted,” “we wanted,” and “your Lord wanted”When al-Khadir finally explains his mysterious actions to the frustrated Musabefore their parting, there is a shift in pronouns in his words from “I wanted” to“we wanted” to “your Lord wanted.” This narrative oddity was understood bySufis as a reference to the ambiguous nature of human volition.Ibn2Atasaid: When al-Khadir said, “I wanted,” it was revealed to him inthe innermost heart (sirr), “Who are you that volition (irada) shouldbelong to you?” Then, in the second situation he said, “We wanted,” andit was revealed to him in the innermost heart, “Who are you and Musathat volition (irada) should belong to you?” They he came back and said,“Your Lord wanted.”68Al-Hallaj explains these as different stations.The first station (maqam) is the total mastery (istila1) of God (al-haqq).The second station is conversation with the servant. The third station isa return to the inner understanding (batin) of [God’s] supremacy in theouter world (al-zahir)...because to get closer to something by means ofegos (nufus) is to get farther away while to approach [the supremacy] bymeans of [the supremacy] itself is to draw near.69What al-Hallaj seems to be describing here is a change in awareness as the mys-tic draws nearer to God. Initially, al-Khadir said, “I wanted,” because he perceivedthe distance between himself and the all-powerful Creator and therefore judgedhimself as a separate entity acting on his own volition. When he said, “Wewanted,” he judged the intimate conversation between himself and his Lord asindicating a kind of partnership in action, but this was also an illusion which kepthim from true nearness.70Finally, when he said, “Your Lord wanted,” he returnedto the awareness of God’s Omnipotence, achieving true intimacy by recognizingthe secret of His pervasive agency and allowing his own ego to be eclipsed.71QUR1ANIC VERSES 18:60–8295"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"As we have already seen, Ruzbihan often builds his meditations on the ideas ofhisSufipredecessors, and his comments here are followed by the interpretationsattributed to Ibn 2Ataand al-Hallaj.These expressions of volition (iradat) are in different forms but in truththey are one because volition (irada) is the volition of God since desires(iradat) emanate (sadarat) in their various types from His volition. Hiswords, “I wanted” tell of the source of gathering (2ayn al-jam2) and unity(ittihad).72His words, “We wanted” tell of taking on the attributes (itti-saf) and becoming expanded (inbisat). His words, “Your Lord wanted”tell of the separation of eternity (qidam) from the temporally originated(muhdath), and the obliteration of temporality (hadath) and the annihi-lation of the one who declares God one (muwahhid) in the unified(muwahhad).In its quality (wasf), this volition (irada) is the inward dimension (batin) ofwill (mashi1a) and the inward dimension of will is that which is the unseen of theattribute (sifa). That which is the unseen of the attribute is the secret (sirr) of theessence (dhat) and the secret of the essence is that which is the unseen of allUnseen things. When al-Khadir moved from the quality (wasf) of unity (ittihad),jealousy (ghayra) cut him off from pure unity to the source of gathering (2aynal-jam2), and cut him off from the gathering (jam2) to taking on the attributes(ittisaf), and from taking on the attributes to becoming expanded (inbisat). Thenit drowned him in the sea of divinity and annihilated him in its depths from anyvision (ru2ya), knowledge (2ilm), volition (irada), act (fi2l), and allusion (ishara).By his act (fi2l) God (al-haqq) spoke in the first, second, and third case andnothing remained in the explanation except God.73The switch in pronouns from “I wanted” to “we wanted” to “your Lord wanted”is something which is only minimally addressed in non-Suficommentaries.

Extended references to Maryam occurin the Qur1an 3:35–3:47, 19:16–29, and 66:12; other verses containing briefreferences to Maryam are 4:156, 4:171, 5:17, 5:75, and 5:116. In addition,Maryam’s name is mentioned twenty-three times as part of 2Isa’s name, “the sonof Maryam.” Only three other persons are mentioned more frequently in theQur1an and she is the only woman mentioned by name.1Maryam has beenreferred to as the prototype of the mystic in Islam,2a characterization thatcertainly holds true for the Suficommentaries studied here. Even more so thanthe figures of Musaand al-Khadir, the figure of Maryam illustrates the way inwhich Sufis adopt a Qur1anic figure as a prescriptive model for themselves. Thefact that she is a woman only makes this all the more striking.What interests Sufis is Maryam’s unusual relationship with the world and thedivine, especially as seen through her detachment from the world, her special rela-tionship with prayer, and the virginal conception of her son. Her detachment fromthe world is tied to the special vow and prayer made by Maryam’s mother for herunborn child and Maryam’s resulting service in the temple as a child. As in thepassages quoted on the concept of 2ilm laduniin the previous chapter, Suficom-mentary here is distinguished by its focus on an unusual Qur1anic word, whosemeaning is explored in a consciously didactic manner.MuharrarWhen a woman of 2Imran said, “O my Lord, I have vowed to you what isin my womb in consecration (muharraran). So accept it from me, for youare the Hearing, the Knowing.” When she gave birth she said, “My Lord,I have given birth to a female!” God knows best what she gave birth toand the male is not like the female. “I have named her Maryam and I seekrefuge for her and her offspring in You from the accursed Satan.”(Qur1an 3:35–36)97"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Ibn Ishaq (d. c.767), an early source for explanatory details on the narratives inthe Qur1an, is quoted in al-Tabarias saying that the woman of 2Imranmentionedhere was a woman named Hannawho had been barren for many years. One dayshe was sitting beneath a tree and saw a mother bird feeding her young. She solonged for a child that she prayed to God and He answered her prayer. When sherealized that she was pregnant, she vowed to give the child up to be a servant inthe temple. Although this was an accepted practice of the Jewish people in hertime, only boys could serve. In light of her vow, Hannawas dismayed when shegave birth to a girl, Maryam. Nonetheless, Her Lord accepted her with a graciousacceptance(3:37), and she grew up in the temple.3The word muharrarin this passage is explained by al-Tabariand others4asreferring to this practice of giving up one’s children for service in the temple. Itis a passive participle of the verb harrar, a verb which occurs five times in theQur1an, always with the meaning of setting free a slave, and it is this sense ofemancipation that Suficommentators focused on. Ja2far al-Sadiq is said to havesaid that muharrarmeans:in emancipation from the bondage of the world (dunya) and its people.Muharraranmeans, I have vowed to you what is in my womb as a sincereservant (2abd) to You, not in servitude to any created being.5Al-Tustariwrites that it means:[the child’s] being freed and emancipated from the bondage of the world(dunya), the following of its personal inclination (hawa), and the desiredobjects of its self (nafs). She made [the child] a servant to the worshippersof the temple in exclusive dedication to God.6Al-Qushayriadds,God (al-haqq), glory be to Him in His preeminent wisdom, has emanci-pated this one from the bondage of being preoccupied with all appearances(wujuh) and states (ahwal).7The references here are brief definitions of a concept developed more fully inotherSufiworks. In his Risala,al-Qushayriexplains the relationship of freedom(hurriyya) to servitude (2ubudiyya), devoting one chapter to each. He writes, “Letit be known to you that the real meaning of freedom lies in the perfection ofslavery (2ubudiyya).”8The relationship of the human being toward God is alwaysthat of a slave subject to His commands and prohibitions; those who haveachieved the difficult and rare station of freedom experience it in relation to theCOMMENTARY98"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"world, not God.

Maryam’s freedom (hurriya)was in her servitude (2ubudiyya). She was not subject to the tumult of the world,its people and its objects of desire and was freed from preoccupation with alltransitory things. Al-Maybudiwrites,The following is an example of freedom. They tell of that gem of histime, BuBakr Qahtubi,10that he had a son who rejected all rules andregulations and kept company with foolish, corrupt and impure youths.One of the Pirs of the Way passed by this boy sitting in one of his wantonand forbidden assemblies, holding hands with those lawless ones. Peoplebegan criticizing him behind him back. That Pir was sympathizing withBuBakr Qahtubi, thinking of the consequences of all this, and that theprattle of people about his son would follow him to the end of his days.With these thoughts, he went to Qahtubiand found him in such a statethat he was beside himself and unaware of that tale and condition!Clearly, he knew neither relatives nor strangers. Clearly, he knew neitherthe world nor people. The Shaykh was astonished by this state and said,“I’d give my life for one who is unaffected by the soaring mountains!”He asked Qahtubiabout the state that so astonished him and he replied,“Indeed, we were freed from slavery to things from beginninglesseternity (azal).”11According to Suficommentaries, it is this quality of servanthood that warrantsthe special status granted to Maryam in Qur1anic verse 3:42, And when the angelssaid,“O Maryam, truly God has chosen you and purified you, chosen you abovethe women of the world.”In al-Tabari, the verse prompts a discussion of the hierar-chy of the four perfect women in the world, namely, Asiya (the wife of Pharoah),Maryam, Khadija (the wife of Muhammad), and Fatima (the daughter ofMuhammad);12and the question of whether Maryam is preferred over all womenfor all time or just the time in which she was living.13Al-Qurtubistates that someinterpret this verse to mean that Maryam is a prophet, an opinion he agrees with,on the grounds that God spoke to her by the intermediaries of the angels.14Suficommentators, however, consider Maryam’s state to be one that is more broadlyQUR1ANIC VERSES ON MARYAM99"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"attainable by saints and the elect who possess this same quality of servanthood.Commenting on Qur1an 3:43, “O Maryam, be obedient to your Lord, and prostrateand bow with those who bow,” Ruzbihan writes,“and bow with those who bow,” that is to say, draw near with your humil-ity with those who are humble among the saints, prophets, and the electof the people of My love so as to attain the blessings of unification(jam2), because the companionship of the saints is firmly rooted inservanthood (2ubudiyya) and purification from the bondage of humannature (bashariyya).15In commentary on Qur1an 66:12, Ruzbihan adds an element of consciousness tothis quality: Maryam chooses servanthood with full knowledge of its value.And Maryam, the daughter of 2Imran, who guarded her chastity, so Webreathed into her Our Spirit and she testified to the words of her Lordand His books and was one of the devout (qanitun).Ruzbihan writes,She testified to the words of her Lord.

Nothing holds them up but God!(16:79). The sun,moon, stars, and clouds have all been made subservient, by God’s command,and all that is in the heavens and the earth, held in this divine thrall, has beenmade subservient to man.17The perfect man or woman remains in a state ofconstant servitude towards God and in doing so, becomes His representativebefore creation. Maryam is one of the obedient (qanitun), a word that the Qur1anapplies to both believing men and women, and the cosmos.18It is becauseMaryam represents the soul in complete submission and receptivity towards thedivine that she is sometimes referred to as the soul at peace (al-nafsal-mutma1inna).19COMMENTARY100"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"PrayerIf the portrayal of Maryam were to be confined to her consecration to God fromthe world (muharrar), she would remain an ascetic but ideal attainable by only afew. But the Suficommentaries studied here look to other, more visceral elementsin the Qur1anic and extra-Qur1anic narratives, creating evocative meditations onthe meaning of prayer as an expression of human longing and pain, and hopefor God’s response. The story of Maryam’s uncle, the prophet Zakariyya,and his awakening to the possibilities of prayer occurs in Suficomments onQur1an 3:37–9.Her Lord accepted her graciously and caused her to grow in a beautifulmanner and He made Zakariyya her guardian. Whenever Zakariyyawent into the mihrabto (see) her, he found her with food. He said,“O Maryam, how does this come to you?” She said, “It is from God.Truly God provides to whom He pleases without measure.” Zakariyyaprayed there to his Lord, saying, “Lord, grant me from Yourself goodlyoffspring. Truly You are the hearer of prayer.” So the angels called to himas he stood praying in the mihrab. “God gives you the good news ofYahya who shall confirm a word from God, noble, chaste, and a prophetfrom among the righteous.”Al-Tabaritells us that it was Zakariyyawho built Maryam a special chamberin the temple (mihrab) and took care of her needs. According to numerous tradi-tions reported from the Companions and Followers of the Prophet, the food men-tioned here refers to fruits miraculously sent to Maryam, winter fruits in thesummer and summer fruits in the winter. When Zakariyyasaw this miraculousprovision given to Maryam, he desired a similar miracle for himself, to have a soneven though he was old and his wife was barren.20Suficommentaries on these verses note the importance of ZakariyyaservingMaryam, quoting an inspiration said to have been sent to the prophet Dawud(David), “If you see someone seeking me, be a servant to him.”21Ruzbihan saysthatHe made Zakariyyaher guardian(3:37) because only a saint (wali) can servea saint.22Zakariyya’s desire to serve Maryam is such that he is concerned whenhe finds her in the mihrabalready provided with food, since he did not initiallybelieve that this food was the result of a miracle. According to al-Qushayri,“Hewas afraid that someone other than him would seize the opportunity of servingher and beat him to performing these duties,”23but it was one of the signs of the“gracious acceptance” that she was not entrusted to Zakariyyaentirely butreceived provision from God directly “so that the worlds might know that Goddoes not burden others with the concerns of His saints.”24Ruzbihan writes thatZakariyyawas initially afraid that Maryam’s charismatic gifts (karamat) were theresult of a ruse of Satan but was reassured that this was not the case afterquestioning her.25QUR1ANIC VERSES ON MARYAM101"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Al-Kashanisuggests that the food described here may also refer to specialknowledge given to Maryam.He found her with (2indaha) food.

Truly You are the Hearer of prayer,” (3:38)that is to say when he saw the charismatic gift (karama) of God with her,he grew more certain and more hopeful, so he asked for a son in spite ofhis advanced age and the fact that his request was granted was contraryto ordinary reality (naqdanl-il-2ada).31Ruzbihan describes Zakariyya’s desire for a miracle as the jealousy (ghayra) ofprophecy.Zakariyyaprayed there to his Lord. When Zakariyyawent to [see]Maryam, he found her with all kinds of fruits, knowledge given to her fromthe precious charismatic gifts (karamat) of God. The jealousy (ghayra) ofprophecy was aroused in him and he dwelt there in retreat (khalwa) andasked God for a son and God gave him what he asked for.32God answers Zakariyya’s prayer out of compassion for this jealousy33andbecause the request is a worthy one. Both al-Qushayriand Ruzbihan write thatZakariyyaasked for a son to help him in obeying God and to be a successor tohim in carrying out the message and guiding the community.

There is a tension here between this desireand supplication, and the acceptance of God’s will. In commenting on Qur1an 3:39,So the angels called to him as he stood praying in the mihrab, al-Qushayriwrites,In this is an allusion to the fact that one who needs something from kingsshould stay at the door incessantly until the request is granted.

Commenting on Qur1anic verse 66:12, al-Kashaniwrites,What is taken into account in worthiness for the charismatic gift(karama) from God is good work and true belief, such as the chastity(ihsan) of Maryam, her believing the words of her Lord, and herobedience, which prepared her for the acceptance (qabul) of the breathof the spirit of God to her...The soul adorned by the excellence of absti-nence and the aforementioned chastity is a receptacle (qabila) for theeffusion (fayd) of the holy spirit and the pregnancy of 2Isa, the heart(qalb), illuminated by the light of the spirit, believing in the words of theLord, the wise tenants, and the divinely revealed religions, obeying godabsolutely with knowledge and deed, secretly and openly, participatingin the unity in everything large and small, inwardly and outwardly, andGod knows best.48COMMENTARY106"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Because Maryam guarded the preparedness of her soul, her soul was able tobecome a receptacle (qabila) for the effusion of the holy spirit and the pregnancyof2Isa, described most fully in Qur1anic verses 19:16–22:Mention Maryam in the book when she withdrew from her family to aneastern place and veiled herself from them. Then We sent to her Our Spiritand it appeared to her as a well-proportioned man. She said, “I seekrefuge in the Merciful from you if you fear God. He said, “I am only amessenger from your Lord, to grant you a pure son.” She said, “How canI have a son when no man has touched me nor have I been unchaste!” Hesaid, “Thus said your Lord: It is easy for Me and (We give him to you) sothat We may make him a sign to men and a mercy from Us. It is a matterdecreed.” So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place.The complexity of Sufisymbolic interpretation is amply illustrated inRuzbihan’s commentary on these verses. He begins by equating Maryam’s essentialnature with the very nature of holiness itself. Her withdrawal to the eastern place,the source of divine lights (ma2din al-anwar al-uluhiyya),49refers to her profoundmystical experiences and intimacy with the unseen world.The real allusion here is that the essential substance (jawhar) of Maryamis itself the primordial substance of holiness (qudus). Raised by God(al-haqq) in the light of intimacy, with every one of her breaths she wasdrawn by the quality of nearness (qurb) and intimacy (uns) to the sourceof divine lights. She became watchful at every moment for the appearanceof the sun of omnipotence (jabarut) from the place in the east of domin-ion (malakut). She withdrew from created things by her high aspirationcharacterized by the light of the unseen. She turned towards the places ofthe east of the suns of the Essence and the Attributes, inhaling the breezesof union (wisal) from the world of eternity without beginning (azal).50“The places of the East” and the suns that can be witnessed rising there aresymbols for the different levels of reality or worlds of the Unseen, with the firstreferring to the unseen intermediary world of jinn and angels (the malakut) and thesecond to the divine world of God’s names and attributes. In his commentary on19:16, al-Kashanicalls the eastern placethe holy world (al-2alam al-qudsi) and thewestern place from which Maryam withdrew and to which she returns the worldof nature (al-2alam al-tabi2a) and the horizon of corporeality (al-ufuq al-jismani),or the dwelling place of the soul (nafs). In describing what happens to Maryam inthiseastern place, Ruzbihan uses two concepts to describe the meeting of thedivine and human: divine self-disclosure (tajalli) and clothing (libas).When we have finished describing the holiness (qudus) of the divinity(lahut) from human nature (nasut) and that human nature is incapable ofreaching the divinity, far removed is the Majesty of God (haqq) fromQUR1ANIC VERSES ON MARYAM107"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"mixing with creation, and eternity is segregated from contingency,exalted is His beauty and the grandeur of His beginninglessness (azal)above likeness and resemblance), we can say regarding God (haqq) send-ing His spirit to her that the Spirit is the visible manifestation (tajalli) ofthe holiness of the essence (dhat) in the light of qualities (sifat); and thelight of qualities is in the clothing (libas) of the acts (af2al) in accordancewith the beautiful form made desirable to her, which draws every spirit toit through the attribute of yearning (shawq), and that was the spirit of theact (fi2l), the spirit of the quality (sifa) and the spirit of the essence (dhat)in the clothing of His light according to the capacity of her intellect (2aql).Because of that, He said, and it appeared to her as a well-proportionedman. This is the usual way of the appearance of the God (haqq) in thebeginning of the passionate love (2ishq) of the lovers, so that their spiritsand hearts may be attracted by it to the treasure of being granted knowl-edge of the qualities and the essence, turning away after separating thetruth (haqiqa) from creation (khaliqa). The Prophet, peace be upon him,said about that, “I see my Lord in the most beautiful form.”51Elsewhere in his Qur1anic commentary, Ruzbihan quotes al-Tustarias definingthe divine self-disclosure (tajalli) as one of the ways in which God gives knowl-edge to His servants, the others being revelation (wahy), and knowledge with(al-2indi) and from (al-laduni) God, all of these being subsumed within the cate-gory of knowledge by unveiling (mukashafa).52The verb tajallaoccurs inQur1anic verse 7:143, in which Musaasks to see God. God replies, “You willnever see Me, but look at the mountain. If it remains in its place, then you will seeMe.”When His Lord manifested Himself (tajalla) to the mountain, He made it asdust and Musafell down in a swoon.Like Musa, Maryam does not perceive God directly. The holiness (qudus) ofthe essence (dhat) descends in the light of the qualities (sifat), which are“clothed” in the acts (af2al), the level of reality visible to her. The acts functionas a mirror for the manifestation (tajalli) of the essence and the qualities. Thedivine self-disclosure (tajalli) is always clothed or made ambiguous (iltibas) inthis manner and is therefore hidden from those who are unaware of the secret. Asevidence for his statements, Ruzbihan quotes the hadith, “I saw my Lord in themost beautiful form.” A more complete version of this hadith, called the hadithof vision (hadith al-ru1ya), reads,I saw my Lord in a form of the greatest beauty, as a youth with abundanthair, seated on the throne of grace: he was clad in a garment of gold; onhis hair a golden mitre; on his feet golden sandals.53It is a hadithwhose authenticity was mostly rejected outside of Sufism andcaused some problems within Sufism itself from those who saw in it license forthe practice of gazing at youths.54Thehadithplays a central role in the thoughtCOMMENTARY108"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"of Ruzbihan because he believed the form of human beauty is the most perfectlocus for the divine self-disclosure (tajalli) and that love of the form can lead tolove of God.55It is not only the form of the well-proportioned man that acts as amirror in which the tajallioccurs, but also Maryam.A breath of the union of eternity (azal) came to her and the sun of wit-nessing of holiness rose upon her. When she witnessed the rising of themanifestation (tajalli) of the eternal (azal), its lights shown and itssecrets reached her spirit (ruh) and her spirit was impregnated by thebreath of the unseen (ghayb). She became pregnant with the great Wordand the light of the highest Spirit. When her state became exalted by thereflection in her beauty of the manifestation of the eternal, she veiledherself from created beings and became intimate with the bridegroom ofreality (haqiqa).56If Ruzbihan seems to be suggesting a union of the human and divine here, else-where in his writings he qualifies this. Commenting on verses of al-Hallaj thatwould seem to describe union with the divine, Ruzbihan writes that this is a fancy(wahm) born of human weakness as it contemplates God, and he notes that “theintoxicated speak in this way frequently, even though they know that the essenceof divinity is unattainable by the created.”57But if Ruzbihan is careful to stressGod’s distance from created things, nonetheless his description of the intimacyMaryam enjoys with the “bridegroom of reality” is a provocative one that includesdesire, yearning, and passion; the erotic imagery would be even more apparent ifRuzbihan1s writing style was not so dense and his terminology so technical.QUR1ANIC VERSES ON MARYAM109"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"9QUR1AN 24:35 (THE LIGHT VERSE)God is the light of the heavens and the earth. The similitude ofHis/his light is as a niche in which is a lamp and the lamp is in aglass, and the glass is like a glittering star lit from a blessed olivetree neither of the east nor the west, whose oil would well-nighshine even if no fire touched it. Light upon light. God guides whomHe wills to His light and strikes similitudes for mankind, and Godhas knowledge of all things.The Light Verse has often been closely associated with Sufithought, primarilybecause of al-Ghazali’s well-known and influential commentary on it. Goldzihersomewhat questionably stated that the verse is one of the few in the Qur1anamenable to mystical thought.1It has been selected for discussion here becauseof the questions it raises concerning literal and metaphorical language, and howone can speak of God and His attributes.God is the light of the heavens and the earthThe majority of non-Suficlassical commentators considered the expression Godis the light of the heavens and the earthto be a metaphor or idiom which mustbe understood in such as way as to avoid equating God with the phenomenon oflight. In his Jami2al-bayan, al-Tabaristates that the Ibn 2Abbas’ interpretation,“God is the guide (hadi) of the people of the heavens and the earth,” is the best ofthe interpretations from the Companions and Followers because it is the logicalcontinuation of the preceding verse, We have sent down to you signs making thingsclear, as a similitude of those who passed away before you, and as an admonitionfor those who are Godfearing(24:34).2Another interpretation al-Tabaricitessuggests that the phrase means that God “governs (yudabbiru) the affair (amr) withregards to [the heavens and the earth], their stars, sun and moon,” an expressiontaken from Qur1anic verses 10:3, 13:2, and 32:5.3Other commentators quoteadditional interpretations traced back to the Companions and Followers, whichmake God the agent of illumination rather than light itself; that is, God is theilluminator (munawwir) or ornamentor (muzayyin) of the heavens and the earth.4110"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Only one interpretation cited in al-Tabariretains the original wording of the phraseby suggesting a synonym for “light” (nur), i.e., “light” (diya1).5Al-Zamakhshari’s commentary is one of the first to reject the literal readingof the phrase and to insist upon its being interpreted. Like other Mu2tazila,al-Zamakhshariwas intent upon protecting the unity of God by denying that therecould be a plurality of eternals, that is, a power, a knowledge, or a light that haveexisted independently with Him for all eternity. Their preferred manner ofexpressing the relationship between God and His attributes was to say that God ispowerful, knowing, etc., by His very essence. In other words, the attributes are notdistinct from His essence, but neither are they equivalent to it. One can say, “Godis powerful,” but not “God is Power,” because this would be likening God to acreated thing. Therefore, Qur1anic phrases such as God is the light of the heavensand the earthmust be interpreted because God is not like anything created, in thiscase light. Al-Zamakhsharisuggests that the phrase God is the lightis like oursaying, “Zayd is generous and munificent” (Zaydunkaramunwa judun) and thensaying, “He revives men with his generosity and munificence” (yun2ashu al-nasbi-karamihi wa judihi). The first sentence does not mean that Zayd is generosityand munificence per se, but rather that Zayd possesses these attributes. Similarly,the meaning of the phrase God is the light of the heavens and the earth, accordingto al-Zamakhshari, is thatHe is the possessor of the light of the heavens and the owner of the lightof the heavens. The light of the heavens and the earth is the truth(al-haqq), which can be compared to light in its manifestation andclarification, just as He says, God is the friend of those who believe; Hebrings them forth from the shadows to the light(2:257), i.e., from thefalse to the true (al-haqq).6The Mu2tazilidoctrine concerning the attributes of God was one of the mostsignificant differences setting them apart from their Ash2aricounterparts wholabeled them “deniers” (mu2attila) for supposedly denying the existence of theattributes of God, leaving God as an abstract symbol of unity.7In his commentaryon this verse, however, the Ash2aritheologian al-Razihas more in common withal-Zamakhsharithan differences. Like al-Zamakhshari, al-Raziinsists that thephraseGod is the lightmust be interpreted. As we saw in the discussion ofQur1an 3:7, al-Razibelieves that the abandonment of the probable meaning ofany expression in the Qur1an requires a clear-cut indicator (dalil munfasil) thatdemonstrates the absurdity of the apparent sense (zahir).8Al-Raziapplies themethodology to this verse, setting forth argument after argument for proving theabsurdity of calling God “light.” He begins by explaining various definitions ofthe word “light” (in its physical sense), and then demonstrates the absurdity ofapplying any of these definitions to God.Further evidence to support his rational arguments is drawn from three Qur1anicverses, one of which is the Light Verse itself. Al-Razifinds a contradictionQUR1AN 24:35 (THE LIGHT VERSE)111"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"between the phrase God is the light of the heavens and the earthand the phrasesthe similitude of His/his lightandGod guides whom He wills to His light, sincethe first phrase appears to equate light with God’s essence while the other phrasesimply that light is attributed (mudaf) to God. One of the ways in which al-Raziattempts to resolve this seeming contradiction is by referring to common usage ofthe Arabic language. He quotes the same sentences found in al-Zamakhshari,although he does not mention al-Zamakhshariby name.9Like al-Zamakhshari,al-Raziunderstands the verse as meaning that God is not “light” per se but ratherthe possessor and creator of light, since Qur1an 42:11 states There is nothing likeHim. According to al-Razi, if God were a light, this verse would be false becauseall lights resemble one another. Nothing resembles Him and therefore He cannotbe called light. Another verse al-Raziquotes to support his view is Qur1an 6:1, Hemade the shadows and the light. This verse proves that the quiddity (mahiyya)of light was created by God, making it impossible that the divine being could bea light.10Based on this rational and Qur1anic evidence, al-Raziinsists that the phraseGod is the light of the heavens and the earthmust be interpreted (la budda minal-ta1wil). His preferred interpretation is the one attributed to Ibn 2Abbas and “themajority,” which states that the verse means, “God is the Guide of the heavens andthe earth.” Al-Razimentions several Qur1anic verses that support this interpreta-tion.11He considers it the best interpretation because the last part of the LightVerse, God guides whom He wills to His light, “indicates that what is meant is thelight of guidance to knowledge and action.” Al-Razibriefly mentions other tradi-tional interpretations such as God as governor (mudabbir), arranger (nazim), andilluminator (munawwir).12This discussion of traditional interpretations is followed by an extensivesummary and expansion of the first part of al-Ghazali’sMishkat al-anwar, acommentary on the Light Verse that will be discussed in greater depth in what fol-lows. For now however, we can state that al-Ghazali’s basic premise is that lightis a word used for many different types of phenomena. The relationship betweenthese different kinds of phenomena is a hierarchical one, and lights that are higherare more worthy of the term “light” than lights that are lower. The light of thephysical eye is inferior to that of the intellect (2aql), a fact that al-Ghazaliprovesby listing seven imperfections of physical sight when compared to rationalinsight; al-Raziexpands this list to a total of twenty imperfections. Even higherthan the light of rational insight is the light of God. According to al-Ghazali, theperfection of His light is such that He alone is worthy of the term “light.” God islight in reality (haqiqa) while all other light is metaphorical (majaz) in relationshipto His light; in truth there is no light but He.13At first glance this view would seem to be antithetical to that of al-Razi, whobegan his own exegesis by arguing that God cannot be called light. Nonetheless,al-Raziconcludes after his long summary of al-Ghazali’s work that no contradic-tion exists between al-Ghazali’s interpretation and the traditional interpretation oflight as “Guide,” al-Razi’s preferred interpretation.14Al-Razi’s acceptance ofCOMMENTARY112"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"al-Ghazali’s interpretation makes more sense when seen in the context of otherdiscussions of God’s attributes. A precedent for al-Ghazali’s statement that God islight in reality (haqiqa) while all other light is metaphor (majaz) can be found inthe work of the Mu2tazilitheologian al-Nashi1al-Akbar (d. 906), who attemptedto solve the problem of anthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Qur1an by thetheory that the attributes of God, when applied to God are “true” (haqiqa) butwhen applied to men are “metaphor” (majaz). The more common way to solveanthropomorphic problems was to say the opposite, that attributes are majazwithregards to God but haqiqawith regards to mankind. But, as Heinrichs has pointedout, either theory works well to solve the problem of anthropomorphism. The firsttheory, however, raises an additional issue, which is whether Nashi1al-Akbarunderstands the distinction between the real (haqiqa) and metaphor (majaz) to beon an ontological or a linguistic level.15Nashi1al-Akbar’s view is ambiguous, butal-Ghazali’s is not. He clearly asserts that God’s light, like His existence, is theonly real Light and Existence. Al-Razi’s position is less clear; while he repeatsal-Ghazali’s emphatic phrase, “There is no light but He,” he omits key passagesexplaining what al-Ghazalimeans by this. Al-Razi’s main concern is the theolog-ical problem of eliminating any possibility of equating God with the physicalphenomenon that we call light.Ibn Taymiyya wrote a commentary on the Light Verse that is structured as arebuttal to an unnamed adversary. Many of the arguments quoted from this adver-sary are arguments found in al-Razi’sTafsir al-kabirand the section on God’sname “light” (nur) in his Sharhasma1Allah ta2alawa1l-sifat.16The wording issimilar enough to suspect that Ibn Taymiyya’s opponent is, in fact, al-Razi, but thefact that some of the arguments quoted are not found in either of the two worksof al-Razi, at least not in the passages studied here, makes it difficult to defini-tively identify him as such. Ibn Taymiyya’s commentary is highly polemical; heaccuses his opponent of distorting the Qur1an (tahrif), apostasy (ilhad) withregards to God’s signs and names, lying (kidhb), iniquity (zulm), and enmitytowards the rights of God.17Ibn Taymiyya attempts to highlight, point by point,what he deems to be the contradictions in his opponent’s arguments and their per-vertedness (fasad). For our purposes the most important material pertains to IbnTaymiyya’s response to the claim that the phrase God is the light of the heavensand the earthmust be interpreted. Ibn Taymiyya not only rejects the necessity ofinterpreting this phrase, he insists that the majority of Muslims do not interpret it,this being the view of the first generations (salaf), the Attributionists (sifatiyya)18among the theologians, jurists, Sufis, and others. The interpretation of God’sattribute “light,” according to Ibn Taymiyya goes back to the jahmiyya19and theMu2tazila.Ibn Taymiyya’s opponent claims that the phrase God is the light of the heavensand the earthmust be interpreted because “light is a mode of being (kayfiyya)existing in corporeality, which is the opposite of darkness, and far be it from God(al-haqq) to have an opposite”20Ibn Taymiyya understands the term “light” aspossessing different meanings appropriate to different contexts. He disagreesQUR1AN 24:35 (THE LIGHT VERSE)113"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"with the definition of light as a mode of being existing in corporeality, stating thatcreated light can be either an essence (2ayn) or an accident (2arad). An exampleof the first is fire while the second would be the reflective light of the fire on awall. Only the second can be said to be a “mode of being existing by means of abody.” In other words, sometimes the word light refers to a substance (jawhar)and sometimes to a quality (sifa). Similarly, the names of God sometimes refer toHis essence and sometimes to His attributes. As an example of this, Ibn Taymiyyaquotes a hadith, “You are the real (haqq), Your speech is the real (haqq), theGarden is real (haqq), the prophets are real (haqq) and Muhammad is real(haqq).”21Similarly, Ibn Taymiyya understands the phrase God is the light of the heavensand the earthas meaning that light is part of God’s essence as well as being oneof His attributes; that is to say God is both light and possesses light. Therefore,there is no contradiction between the first phrase, God is the light of the heavensand the earthand the second phrase the similitude of His/his light, and it wouldbe wrong to interpret the first phrase to mean “God is the possessor of light,” asdo al-Zamakhshariand al-Razi. Ibn Taymiyya finds further proof for acceptingthe exact Qur1anic wording as it is in the hadith, “O God, praise be to You, lightof the heavens and the earth and what is in them,” and the Prophet’s reply to thequestion of how he saw his Lord, “I see a light.”22Ibn Taymiyya’s insistence that God is light, however, does not mean that herejects the metaphorical interpretations of the first generations (salaf) regardingthis light, comments that he does not call ta1wilbut rather tafsir. According to IbnTaymiyya, saying that “God is the guide of the heavens and the earth” does notnegate the fact of God being Himself a light. Using many of the same examplesthat he uses in his book on Qur1anic methodology, Muqaddima fiusul al-tafsir,Ibn Taymiyya explains that the custom of the first generations was to use differ-ent expressions and examples to explain the meaning of the Qur1an. When theysaid, “God is the guide of the heavens and the earth,” they were making a state-ment regarding one of the meanings of God is the light of the heavens and theearth, a statement that does not invalidate its other meanings. Likewise, whenthey said, “God is the illuminator (munawwir) of the heavens and the earth,” theywere not contradicting the fact of His being a light, because part of the definitionof light is being something that illuminates something else.23Ibn Taymiyya, then,accepts both the interpretation that God is the light of the heavens and the earthas “God is the guide of the heavens and the earth” and the interpretation thatinsists upon the literal meaning. However, he does not explore the implications ofaccepting the literal meaning.24Sufiinterpretations of God is the light of the heavens and the earthIt is the literal understanding of the phrase God is lightthat interests al-Ghazaliin his Mishkat al-anwar, although the conclusions he draws regarding it are notCOMMENTARY114"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"ones that Ibn Taymiyyya would have accepted. He explains that the variousinterpretations of the Light Verse are due to the different definitions of light theypresuppose. He judges the understanding of light found amongst the Sufis to besuperior to that of other interpretations, but suggests that it is not an interpreta-tion that should be widely broadcast. As we saw in the commentaries on Qur1an 3:7,theSufis asserted that the Qur1an contains both public knowledge that should bedisseminated and private knowledge that is made deliberately obscure except tothose few intended to receive it. Al-Ghazalirefers to this principle in the intro-duction to his Mishkat al-anwarand explains why, then, he is revealing some ofthis private information:What is more, not every mystery is to be unveiled and divulged, andnot every reality (haqiqa) is to be presented and disclosed. Indeed, “thebreasts of the free (ahrar) are the graves of the mysteries.”25One of thegnostics has said, “To divulge the mystery of Lordship is unbelief(kufr).” Indeed, the Master of the First and the Last [the Prophet] said,“There is a kind of knowledge like the guise of the hidden; none knowsit except the knowers of God. When they speak of it, none denies itexcept those who are arrogantly deluded by God.” And when the peopleof arrogant delusion become many, it becomes necessary to preservethe coverings upon the face of the mysteries. But I see you as one whosebreast has been opened up by God through light and whose innermostconsciousness (sirr) has been kept free of the darknesses of delusion.Hence, in this discipline I will not be niggardly toward you in allud-ing (ishara) to sparks and flashes or giving symbols of realities andsubtleties, for the fear of holding back knowledge from those whoare worthy of it is not less than that in disseminating it to those who arenot worthy of it.He who bestows (manaha) knowledge on the ignorant wastes it,And he who withholds (mana2a) it from the worthy has done them wrong.26With this said, al-Ghazaliproceeds to the first section of his treatise on thedefinition of different types of light, and his interpretation of the phrase God isthe light of the heavens and the earth.Al-Ghazaliasserts that the term “light” is understood in three different ways.The first usage (wad2) is that of ordinary people (2ammi) and indicates manifesta-tion (zuhur) to visual perception. “Light” here is “an expression for what can beseen in itself and through which other things can be seen, like the sun.” The Arabiclanguage, however, also includes the possibility of using the word “light” to referto the organ of perception involved, the eye, as in the phrase “the light of theeyesight of the bat is weak (fi’l-khuffash inna nur2aynihida2if).”27Al-Ghazalisuggests that this second definition of the term “light” is more appropriate than thefirst definition because the eye perceives and through it perception takes place,QUR1AN 24:35 (THE LIGHT VERSE)115"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"whereas seen light is merely the place where perception takes place. An even moreperfect organ of perception is the “eye” of the intellect (2aql) and so this too canbe referred to as a “light.” It is in this sense that “light” can be used to refer to theProphet and, to a lesser degree, the other prophets and religious scholars.28While this second definition of “light” occurs among the elect (khawass), theelect of the elect (khawassal-khawass) have a third definition, which defines“light” as “the first light” (al-nur al-awwal) and “the real light” (al-nur al-haqq)because it is the only light that does not borrow its luminosity from somethingelse. The use of the term “light” for anything other than this real light is metaphor(majaz). God is light, there is no light but He, and He is the totality of lights andthe universal light. God is hidden from us because He is pure light. In everythingother than God light is mixed with darkness, allowing us to see, but God has noopposite, no darkness mixed with His light and He is therefore veiled from Hiscreation by the very intensity of His manifestation. He is everywhere but cannotbe seen.Just as the real light (al-nur al-haqq) is God, the real existent (al-mawjudal-haqq) is God. And just as our light is “borrowed,” so is our existence “borrowed(isti2ara).” Once one has recognized what is real and what is metaphor, one willunderstand that “there is nothing in existence except God,” and Everything isbeing annihilated except His face(28:88). The state (hal) of seeing this is attainedeither by cognitive gnosis (2irfan2ilmi) or “tasting (dhawq).” In the latter casethere is an intoxication that overcomes the intellect and gives rise to such state-ments as those made by al-Hallaj and AbuYa zid al-Bistami(d. 875), but whenthe state ends the intellect knows that it was a state that was not the reality of uni-fication (haqiqat al-ittihad) but the ambiguity of unification (shubha’l-ittihad).The possessor of this state has been annihilated (faniya) from himself andannihilated from his annihilation (faniya2an fana1ihi) because he has lost allconsciousness of himself.In relationship to the one immersed in it, this state is called “unification”(ittihad), according to the language of metaphor (majaz), or is called“declaring God’s unity” (tawhid) in the language of reality (haqiqa).29Al-Ghazaliquotes a poem here attributed to Sahib b. 2Abbad (d. 995):The glass is clear, the wine is clear,the two are similar, the affair confused,As if there is wine and no glass,or glass and no wine.30And he adds, “There is a difference between saying, ‘The wine is the cup’ and ‘Itisas ifthe wine is the cup.’ ”31It was just this kind of ambiguous statement whichtroubled critics like Ibn Taymiyya who rejected the distinction between the realityand the metaphor of unification (ittihad) and therefore could only see these ideasCOMMENTARY116"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"as heresies, a denial of God’s complete transcendence. Ibn Taymiyya believed thatthis denial was at the root of both the ecstatic utterances of the early Sufis andtheir philosophizing successors, hidden beneath the deliberate ambiguity of Sufiterminology and style. Ibn 2Arabidescribes the state of bewilderment (hayra)which occurs in the mystic when he realizes the ambiguity of existence, but IbnTaymiyya declares this merely confusion, the result of the logical absurdities ofthe mystic’s thinking.32In the Mishkat al-anwar, al-Ghazalianticipates thiscriticism, expressing his concern that what he has said will be misunderstood andsuggests that those who cannot grasp this kind of knowledge should avoid it:It may be that some people will fall short of understanding the innermostmeaning of these words. Hence, they will understand the words, “God iswith everything, just as light is with the things,” to mean that He is ineach place – high exalted and holy is He from being ascribed to place!Probably the best way not to stir up such imaginings is to say that He isbefore everything, that He is above everything and that He makes every-thing manifest. Yet, in the knowledge of those who possess insight, thatwhich makes manifest cannot be separate from that which is manifest.This is what we mean by our saying that “He is with everything.”Moreover, it is not hidden from you that the manifester is above andbefore everything made manifest, although it is with everything in acertain respect. However, [the manifester] is with [everything] in onerespect and before it in another respect, so you should not suppose thatthis is a contradiction. Take an example from sensory objects, which lieat your level of knowledge: Consider how the movement of a hand isboth with the movement of its shadow and before it. He whose breastcannot embrace knowledge of this should abandon this type of science.There are men for each science, and “the way is eased for each personto that for which he was created.”33For ordinary people the declaration of God’s unity (tawhid) is “There is nogod but God,” but for the elect the declaration of God’s unity is “There is no hebut He.”34TheMishkat al-anwarrepresents a type of Sufiwriting which uses thelanguage of philosophy and theology to describe a view of reality based on theSufiexperience of annihilation (fana1) and subsistence (baqa1). Although Ibn2Arabihas often been considered the originator of this theoretical form of Sufism,theMishkat al-anwardemonstrates that al-Ghazaliwas clearly his precursor.35Elsewhere, al-Ghazalidid address the types of theological issues which are theprimary focus of al-Razi’s commentary on the Light Verse, but these are not hisconcerns in the Mishkat al-anwar. His concerns are also different from the purelyphilosophical approach of Ibn Sinain his interpretation of the Light Verse foundinFiithbat al-nubuwwat. Like al-Razi, Ibn Sinadeclares physical light the“essential” meaning of light and the use of the term “light” in the Qur1anic phraseQUR1AN 24:35 (THE LIGHT VERSE)117"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"God is the light of the heavens and the earth“metaphorical,” a linguistic stanceopposite to that of al-Ghazali.I say: lightis an equivocal term (mushtarak) partaking of two meanings,one essential (dhati) and the other metaphorical (musta2ar). The essentialstands for the perfection of the transparent inasmuch as it is transparent,as Aristotle said. The metaphorical meaning is to be understood in twoways: either as the good, or as the cause that leads to the good. Here, thesense is the metaphorical one in both meanings. I mean that God, theExalted, is in Himself the good and the cause of everything good.”36In this respect, Ibn Sinahas more in common with exoteric exegesis on thisverse than with al-Ghazali’s interpretation, because he assumes that the meaningof the term “light” can be easily understood. For al-Ghazali, in contrast, the truemeaning of “light” contains a secret regarding the ambiguous status of man’sexistence. Al-Ghazalilinks this particular understanding of man’s relationship toGod to problems of Qur1anic interpretation both here and in his discussion in theIhya1 2ulum al-dinof the meaning of the Qur1anic verse You did not throw whenyou threw but God threw(8:17). The verse was revealed after the Battle of Badrand refers to a moment in the battle when the Prophet threw dust at the enemiesof the Muslims.The external sense (zahir) of this verse is clear but the truth of its meaningis obscure (ghamid) since it both affirms and negates the throwing. Thisis contradictory in the external sense unless one understands that hethrew from one point of view and did not throw from another point ofview, and from the point of view in which he did not throw Godthrew. . . The reality of this is taken from the vast ocean of the knowledgesof unveiling (2ulum al-mukashafat). The external sense of the commentarywill be of no use.37The similitude of His/his light is as a nicheWhile the phrase God is the lightwas interpreted both metaphorically and literally,the phrase the similitude of His/his light is as a nicheand the various elements ofthis niche was understood by all commentators as a metaphor, but a metaphorwhose referents are ambiguous. Al-Razilists ten different interpretations that canbe grouped according to whether these words refer to God, Muhammad, or thebeliever.38Although al-Raziincludes interpretations from later commentators, allthree referents can be found in the earliest interpretations transmitted from theCompanions and the Followers. Al-Razi’s preferred interpretation, as it wasal-Tabari’s, is that the extended metaphor of the niche serves the purpose ofdescribing a pure and perfect light, thereby describing, by analogy, the perfectionof God’s guidance. His lightmay also refer to the Qur1an. Another interpretationCOMMENTARY118"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"suggests that the words mean Muhammad, just as the Qur1an 33:46 describesMuhammad as a light-giving lamp.

Or the nichecan be com-pared to Ibrahim, the glassto Isma2il, the lampto the body of Muhammad, andthetreeto prophecy and the message.Whereas these interpretations identify the elements of the niche as referring toGod’s guidance or Muhammad, the other interpretations cited by al-Raziunder-stand this part of the verse as referring to the believer. One interpretation suggeststhat the lightis knowledge of God and the religious laws in the heart of thebeliever. The evidence for this interpretation is in Qur1an 39:22, Is he whosebreast God has opened up to Islam so that he has a light from his Lord...andverse 14:1, in order that you might bring mankind out of the darkness into thelight. The interpretations of al-Ghazaliand Ibn Sina, which understand the nicheas referring to the human perceptual faculties are summarized. Al-Razithenquotes a Sufiinterpretation which states that the nicheis the breast, the glassis the heart, the lampis knowledge, and the blessed treeis the angels and theirinspirations which are neither of the east nor westbecause they are spiritual(ruhaniyya). The oil from this tree would well-nigh shine even if no fire toucheditbecause of the plentitude of their different types of knowledge and the power-fulness of their understanding of the secrets of the kingdom (malakut) of God. Al-Raziadds critically, “It is obvious here that the thing compared (mushabbah)is not the thing compared therewith (al-mushabbih bihi).”39Al-Razidoes not explain why he finds this particular interpretationunacceptable. Al-Qurtubiis clearer in his commentary that the issue is one ofunderstanding the proper use of language. He states that metaphorical defini-tions of light are part of standard Arabic speech and gives examples of suchfrom Arabic poetry to show that the statement God is the lightrefers to He whobrings all things into existence, including light. He adds that the mistake ofcorporealists (mujassima) is that they follow the external sense of the verseandahadithwhich seem to suggest that God isa light.40Metaphor, then, is partof the language of the Qur1an. This does not mean, however, that words andexpressions can be interpreted in ways that go beyond the metaphors that area part of standard Arabic speech. Al-Qurtubiquotes his teacher’s critique of aninterpretation of the elements of thenichesimilar to one of the interpretationsal-Razicites.Al-QadiAbuBakr b. al-2Arabisaid: It is strange that there was a juristwho said that this is a similitude which God has struck for Ibrahim andMuhammad, and for 2Abd al-Muttalib and his son 2Abd Allah...2Abdal-Muttalib is likened to the nichein which there is a candle that is theglassthat is like 2Abd Allah.

Ibrahim then Muhammad.Al-Qadisaid: All of this is an abandonment of the obvious sense(zahir) and nothing in the process of creating metaphors (tamthil)prevents one from expanding it.41Al-Qurtubi’s teacher is drawing attention to what he perceives to be the dangerinherent in metaphors, their openness to endless interpretation. Yet he also statesthat metaphor in the Qur1an is necessary because man can only understand that ofwhich he already has some knowledge, namely himself and his world.This verse is a similitude which God has struck for His light. It is onlypossible to strike a similitude for His exalted light as an exhortation toHis creation by some part of His creation, because men, due to theirlimitations, can only understand by means of themselves. If that were notso, no one would know God except He Himself.42Still confusing here, however, is the definition of the boundaries of acceptablemetaphorical interpretation. Ibn Taymiyya states that the use of analogy (qiyas) ininterpretation is acceptable if the analogies produced are in agreement with otherQur1anic verses, sound hadith, and salafiinterpretations. In his commentary onthis passage of the Light Verse, he quotes a Sufiinterpretation which he deemsacceptable.Among the sayings of the gnostics (2arifun) is that the lightis that whichilluminates the hearts of the sincere by its declaration of God’s unity andilluminates the innermost hearts (asrar) of the lovers by its confirma-tion. It is said that it is that which enlivens the hearts of the gnostics bythe light of its knowledge and the souls of the worshippers by the lightof its worship.43This is the talk of some shaykhs who speak in a manner of admoni-tion without verifying [what they say]. Shaykh Abu2Abd al-Rahman inTahqiq al-tafsir44mentions allusions (isharat), some of which provideuseful lessons and some of which come from invalid or rejected trans-mitted material. The allusions of the Sufishaykhs can be divided intoallusion by state (ishara haliyya), which are their allusions by means ofhearts – and it is this by which they characterized – but this is not the casehere; and allusions connected to teachings such as they take from theQur1an and the like. These allusions are in the category of considerationCOMMENTARY120"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"(i2tibar), analogy (qiyas), and appending that which is not in a text to thatwhich is in the text (ilhamalaysa bi-mansusbi’l-mansus).

If the analogy is weak, it is judged accordingly.If it is a distortion (tahrif) of the words beyond their [acceptable]interpretation, it is the type of sayings of the qaramita,46batiniyyaandjahmiyya.47Ibn Taymiyya, then, finds metaphorical interpretations beyond those transmittedfrom the Companions and the Followers acceptable provided they can be verifiedas sound by the Qur1an,ahadithandtafsirfrom the Companions and Followers,a process of verification he suggests the Sufis rarely do.Sufiinterpretations of the similitude of His/his light is as a nicheIbn Taymiyya identifies an important point here. Suficommentaries rarely referdirectly to the commentaries of the Companions and Followers of the Prophet, butthis fact should not be taken to mean that they were unaware or critical of them. Oneof the earliest recorded Sufiinterpretations on the Light Verse, attributed to Ja2faral-Sadiq, reflects and expands upon all the salafiinterpretations of the similitude ofHis/his lightin its detailing of a long list of the varied manifestations of God’s lightand the hierarchy of those who possess it: God, Muhammad, and the believers.The lights are different. The first of them is the light of the protectionof the heart, then the light of fear, then the light of hope, then the lightof recollection, then vision by the light of knowledge, then the light ofmodesty, then the light of the sweetness of faith, then the light of Islam,then the light of doing beautiful acts (ihsan), then the light of blessing,then the light of grace, then the light of benefits, then the light of gen-erosity, then the light of affection, then the light of the heart, then thelight of comprehension, then the light of awe, then the light of bewil-derment, then the light of life, then the light of intimacy, then the lightof uprightness, then the light of humility, then the light of tranquility,then the light of grandeur, then the light of majesty, then the light ofpower, then the light of might, then the light of divinity, then the light ofoneness, then the light of singularity, then the light of eternity, then thelight of endless time, then the light of eternity without beginning or end,then the light of permanence, then the light of sempiternity, then thelight of subsistence (baqa1), then the light of universality, then the lightof He-ness (huwiyya).QUR1AN 24:35 (THE LIGHT VERSE)121"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Each of these lights has a people, a state (hal) and a place (mahall), andall of them are part of the lights of God (al-haqq) that God has men-tioned in his words, God is the light of the heavens and the earth. Eachone of His servants is drinking from one of these lights and perhaps hasa portion of two or three lights. These lights will not become completefor anyone except Mustafa48because he stands with God by virtue ofbeing rendered sound in servanthood and love. He is a light and is in alight from his Lord (huwa nur wa huwa min rabbihi 2alanur).49The language in this interpretation can be compared to an interpretation of theblessed olive tree neither of the east nor of the westandlight upon lightrelatedfrom the Companion Ubayy b. Ka2b. Here, the believer is compared to a tree thatreceives just the right amount of light just as the believer is protected from life’svicissitudes by the strength which God gives him.He balances four characteristics: if he receives he is grateful; if he isafflicted he is patient; if he expresses an opinion he is fair; and if hespeaks he is truthful. Among other men he is like a living man walkingamidst the graves of the dead. Light upon light. He freely moves aboutin five different kinds of light. His speech is light, his action is light, hisprivate affairs are a light, his public affairs50are a light, and his ultimatedestination will be the light on the Day of Resurrection in the Garden.51What distinguishes Suficommentaries, however, is not only their expanded useof the metaphor of light but also a seemingly literal way of understanding thislight, as in al-Tustari’s description of the role of light in the creation ofMuhammad and the believers. In his commentary on the Light Verse, al-Tustarisuggests that the similitude of His/his lightrefers to Muhammad. He also quotesal-Hasan al-Basrias saying that what is meant is the heart of the believer. The cre-ation of the lights of Muhammad and the believers is described in al-Tustari’scomments on Qur1anic verse 7:172, a verse which describes the primordialcovenant between God and man.When your Lord took from the children of Adam their seed (dhuriyya)and caused them to bear witness concerning themselves, “Am I not yourLord?” They said, “Yes, we bear witness.” That was so that you wouldsay on the Day of Resurrection, “We ignored this.”In his commentary on this verse, al-Tustaridescribes three types of seedsrepresenting future mankind. The first type of seed was Muhammad who wascreated directly from God’s light.God Most High, when he wished to create Muhammad (the blessingsand peace of God upon him), manifested some of his light. When itattained the veil of majesty, it bowed down in prayer before Allah.

The third type of seed was mankind, the children of Adam, whowere created either from the light of Muhammad or the light of Adam. Those whoare guides, who are desired (muradun) were created from the light ofMuhammad, while those who are seekers (muridun) were created from the lightofAdam.53Mankind is created directly or indirectly from Muhammad’s light andwill return to the divine light from which he was created.54The lights of God interpreted as Muhammad and the believers are also mentionedin the writings of al-Hallaj. In the first chapter of his Kitab al-tawasin, al-Hallajrepeats many aspects of the theory of Muhammad’s light of al-Tustari, who was histeacher for a brief period of time.55In the fragments recorded of al-Hallaj’s Qur1aniccommentary, the focus is on light as representing the qualities of the believer.He compared the heart to a candle whose water is certainty and whoseoil is patience and the sincerity which develops from it, and whose wickis trust in God and whose light is contentment. If it is characterized bythis quality, the flavor of life can be found in its light.56God made submission (islam) a light for His people, and faith a lightfor His people, and assent (tasdiq) a light in the heart of the believer.Knowledge (2ilm), intelligence (2aql) and insight (basira) are lights. Allof the moral traits (akhlaq) of the believers are lights. All of the acts ofworship are lights and the nearness of the servants to God is in proportionwith their lights.57God is both “the light of light” (nur al-nur)58and “the illuminator (munawwir) ofyour hearts until you come to know and find (wajadtum).”59At this point thebeliever becomes full of light.In the head is the light of revelation (wahy) and in the two eyes is thelight of intimate dialogue with God, and in the ears is the light of certainty,and in the tongue is the light of clarity, and in the breast is the light offaith, and in the humours of the body (taba1i2) is the light of glorifyingGod. When something catches fire from these lights it overwhelms theother light and incorporates it into its authority. When it has subsided theauthority of that light returns and you are increased by what happened.When everything catches fire, it becomes light upon light. God guideswhom He wills to His light.60QUR1AN 24:35 (THE LIGHT VERSE)123"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Another distinctive element of these early Sufiinterpretations of the Light Verseis the comparison made between the macrocosm of the universe and the micro-cosm of man, a type of analogical thinking which becomes even more pervasivein the later commentaries of al-Kashaniand al-Nisaburi. Ibn 2Ata1, al-Hallaj’s con-temporary, explains what it is that God illuminates in the heavens and the earth.God adorned (zayyana) the heavens with the twelve signs of the zodiac,and they are the Ram, the Bull, the Twins, the Crab, the Lion, the Earsof Corn (Virgo), the Scales, the Scorpion, the Archer, the Sea Goat, theWater Bearer, and the Fish. He adorned the hearts of the believers withtwelve characteristics: the mind, attention, explanation, intelligence,knowledge, certainty, understanding, insight, the life of the heart, hope,fear and life. As long as these signs of the zodiac exist the world will bein order and abundance. Similarly, as long as these characteristics existin the heart of the Gnostic (2arif), there will be the light of the gnosticand the sweetness of worship.61Al-Wasitishows how the microcosm, man, is illuminated directly by God.God created the spirits (arwah) before the bodies (ajsad). He illuminatedthem by His attributes (sifat) and addressed them by means of Hisessence (dhat), so they are illuminated and receive light by means of thelight of His sanctity (qudus). He told of it in His words God is the lightof the heavens and the earthbecause He is the illuminator (munawwir)of the spirits (arwah) by the perfection of His light.62The interrelationship between the corporeal (jismani) and the spiritual (ruhani)forms the basis of the cosmology and hermeneutical theory that al-Ghazalidevel-ops in his Mishkat al-anwar. As discussed in Part I of this work, the theory statesthat what exists in one world serves as a similitude for what exists in the other andthat the similitudes of the Qur1an can be understood by understanding the rela-tionship between these two worlds. Al-Ghazaligives many examples of this, oneof the most significant being that of man. Man was created “in the form of theMerciful,” an allusion to a hadithwhich al-Ghazaliunderstands as referring toman as a microcosm of the universe.God showed beneficience to Adam. He gave him an abridged form(surat mukhtasar) that brings together every sort of things found in thecosmos. It is as if Adam is everything in the cosmos, or an abridgedtranscription (nuskha mukhtasar) of the world.63TheMishkat al-anwaris divided into three parts. The first part is thediscussion of the mystery of understanding God is the light of the heavens and theearth. The second part describes the two elements necessary for this understanding.COMMENTARY124"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"One of them is the hermeneutical theory of using similitudes which we havealready discussed. The other is the structure of man himself and the relationshipbetween the corporeal and spiritual worlds within him. This is described, accord-ing to al-Ghazali, in the similitude of the elements of the niche, which representthe layers (tabaqat) of the spirits (arwah) of the human clay (al-tinat al-bashariyya)and the degrees (maratib) of their lights.64Unlike most Suficommentators,Al-Ghazaliis careful to link his interpretation to salafiinterpretations, in this casethose of Ibn Mas2ud, whom he quotes as saying, “the similitude of his/His lightinthe heart of the believers is like a niche,” and Ubayy b. Ka2b, whom he quotes assaying, “the similitude ofa light in the heart of one who has faith.”65According to al-Ghazali, the first of the “luminous human spirits” (al-arwahal-bashariyya al-nuraniyya) is the sensory spirit (al-ruhal-hassas) which isfound in animals and infants. It is like the niche because its lights come out of thedifferent openings of the body such as the two eyes, ears, and nostrils, etc. The sec-ond is the imaginal spirit (al-ruhal-khayali) which is capable of rememberingand is found in older children, adults, and some animals. It is like glass, a densesubstance which can be purified to channel light. The third is the rational spirit(al-ruhal-2aqli) which comprehends meanings outside of the senses and imagi-nation and is found only in human beings. It is like the lamp. The fourth is thereflective spirit (al-ruhal-fikri) which combines part of the rational knowledge toderive a higher form of knowledge. It is like the tree because it begins from thisroot and then branches out. The fifth is the sanctified prophetic spirit (al-ruhal-qudsial-nabawi) which belongs only to the prophets and some friends of God(awliya1) and is beyond the intellect (2aql). It is the oil which would well-nighshine even if no fire touched itbecause there are those among the friends of Godwho could almost do without the help of the prophets, and there are prophets whocould almost do without the help of the angels.66The third part of the Mishkat al-anwarapplies al-Ghazali1s understanding ofthe Light Verse to classify different types of people, by means of an interpretationof the hadith“God has seventy veils of light and darkness. If He were to unveilthem, the glories of His face would burn up everyone whose eyes perceived Him.”The third part synthesizes the points made in the first two parts by demonstratinghow the perceptions of the lower spirits of man lead to faulty conclusions regard-ing the nature of God. Al-Ghazalidefines three kinds of people who are veiledfrom the truth in various ways.To summarize his categories briefly, the first type are atheists (mulhida)veiled by darkness; they include materialists and egotists, the latter being furthersubdivided into hedonists, predators, materialistic people, and status seekers.The second type are those people who are veiled by light and darkness. Theirveils correspond to the levels of the spirit that al-Ghazalihas described as the ele-ments of the niche. Some of them are veiled by sensory darkness, meaning thatthey can only understand God as an object perceived by the senses. The objectswhich they perceive as divinities range from precious substances such as gold orsilver, to beautiful human beings, to fire, the stars or the sun, or unlimited light.QUR1AN 24:35 (THE LIGHT VERSE)125"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"More advanced than those are individuals veiled by imaginal darkness, who canonly understand God as an imagined being sitting on a throne, having a body,existing in a certain place, etc. Finally, there are those who are veiled by the dark-ness of faulty rational comparisons who can only understand God in relation totheir own attributes.67The third type are those veiled by lights.68Among these are those who understandthat God’s attributes cannot be compared to those of humans. More advancedwould be those who recognize God as the Mover (muharrik) of the furthest celes-tial sphere which envelops the lower celestial spheres moved by angels. Mostadvanced are those who recognize that the “Mover” must still only be an angelobeying the Lord who “is a mover of everything by means of command (2amr),not direct contact.”69Those who have arrived (wasilun) have found God to bebeyond any of these descriptions. Like Ibrahim, they recognize that all theirprevious understandings of God are faulty.Therefore, they have turned their faces from the one who moves theheavens, from the one who moves the furthest celestial body, from theone who commands moving them, to Him who originates the heavens,originates the furthest celestial body, and originates the one who com-mands moving the heavens. They have arrived at an existent thing that isincomparable with everything that their sight had perceived. Hence, theaugust glories of His face – the First, the Highest – burn up everythingperceived by the sights and insights of the observers. Thus, they findHim too holy for and incomparable with all that we described earlier.70Some who reach this stage remain as perceivers and yet what they perceivecompletely disappears. Others, the elect of the elect (khawassal-khawass), ceaseto observe themselves as well; in other words, the perceiver himself disappears,as in Everything is being annihilated except His face(28:88).71This self-disclosureof God (tajalli) occurs in stages for some, as was the case with Ibrahim, and forothers all at once, as was the case with Muhammad.72Al-Ghazali’s interpretation of the nichewas clearly influenced by Ibn Sina’sinterpretation in Al-Isharat wa’l-tanbihat,73but while the similarities between thetwo interpretations are undeniable, al-Ghazali makes significant modifications.While the five elements described in Ibn Sina’s version are all parts of the intel-lect (2aql) which only man possesses, al-Ghazali’s version calls the faculties“spirit” (ruh) which opens up the metaphor to include all types of perception,even those shared with animals.74This change enables al-Ghazalito classifyfaulty notions of God based on whether the possessor of those beliefs is bound bythe limitations of animal or human perceptions.Al-Kashani’s interpretation of the Light Verse suggests a familiarity with theinterpretations of both al-Ghazaliand Ibn Sina. He explains the elements of theniche as the integrated physical and spiritual elements of man which combine toenable him to achieve perfection.

Like his predecessors,al-Nisaburiunderstands the different elements of the niche as referring to the var-ious faculties of man which must be developed in order to achieve perfection, astate in which man realizes the nature of the mysterious relationship between Godand man.

This is thestation (maqam) of the hadith, “I am his hearing, his seeing...”81Al-Nisaburi’s interpretation seems to suggest that, having experiencedannihilation (fana1) and subsistence (baqa1), the perfected man is both illuminatedby the light he receives through the fire of God’s self-disclosure (tajalli) and inturn illuminates others by this light which emerges from the “aperture of thephysical senses (hawass).”In the interpretations of Ibn Sina, al-Ghazali, al-Kashaniand al-Nisaburi, each andevery element of the Qur1anic verse is explained by a single term. The similarities anddifferences in the resulting interpretations can be seen in Table 9.1. Another approachseen in Sufiinterpretations of the Light Verse has more in common with that of theinterpretation of Ja2far al-Sadiq previously quoted. Here, the words open up to largermeanings rather than one-to-one correspondences and often refer to states in thebeliever. The believer is both created from light and engaged in an ongoing processof receiving light. To reach the higher states of light upon lightthe believer must bedetermined in his resolve to avoid man’s natural tendency towards laziness, to allowhimself to respond to the different states through which he travels, using the tensionwithin and between them to motivate himself to continue in his exertions. This is howthe phrase neither of the east nor the westwas understood by Ja2far al-Sadiq:Neither the fear which imposes despair nor the hope which brings aboutdelight. One should stand between fear and hope.82Al-Qushayriwrites,The allusion (ishara) in it is to the fact that the fear in their hearts shouldnot be separate from the hope so that one would come close to despair.Neither should their hope be separate from fear so that one would comeclose to complacence.

Light upon lightappears to him in hisdifferent states until he reaches a stage where words can no longer describewhat has been unveiled to him. Al-Qushayriis usually thought of as a moderateSufi, but what he describes at the end of this passage appears to hint at somethinglike the concept of the unity of God as interpreted in al-Ghazali’sMishkat al-anwar.It is said that the effect of the light of the heart is the continuance of astate of agitation which does not allow one to remain lazy. One comes tohis journey by the use of his reflection (fikr) and God nourishes him bythe light of the success He grants until none of the obstacles to spiritualeffort (ijtihad) can hold him back, neither love of leadership, nor theinclination to evil, nor indulgence. When the truth of one’s forgetfulnessis disclosed and vision takes hold of his situation, knowledge will bemost certainly obtained. Then he will continue to increase in certainty(yaqin) upon certainty based on what he sees in the interaction of con-traction (qabd) and expansion (bast). The reward and compensation is inthe increase of unveiling (kashf) upon the increase in effort and theobtainment of ecstasy (wajd) when performing the litany (wird).Then after it there is the light of interaction (mu2amala), then the lightof the mutual waystation (munazala), and the broad daylight of theconnection (muwasala). The suns of the declaration of unity (tawhid)shine and there are no clouds in the sky of their secrets and no fog in itsair. God said, light upon light, God guides whom He wills to His light.It is said that the light of appeal (mutalaba) appears in the heart andprompts its owner to settle his account. When he has seen his record andhis prior disobedience, the light of examination (mu2ayana) comes to himand he reverts to blaming himself and drinks cups of remorse. Then herises up from this by persistence in his goal and purification from whatremained with him from the times of his lassitude. When he has becomeupright in that which was revealed by the light of observation (muraqaba),then he knows that God watches over him. After this is the light of behold-ing (muhadara) which are flashes (lawa1ih) that appear in the innermosthearts (sara1ir). Then after that is the light of unveiling (mukashafa) andthat is by means of the self-disclosure (tajalli) of the attributes (sifat).Then after it is the light of witnessing (mushahada) and his night becomesday, his stars moons, and his moons full moons, and his full moons suns.COMMENTARY130"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Then after this are the lights of the declaration of oneness (tawhid) andat the same time disengagement (tajrid) is realized by the qualities ofsingle-mindedness (tafrid).

Unity (ahadiyya) isexalted, everlastingness is sublime, perpetuity (daymumiyya) is sancti-fied, and the divinity is unblemished.84Al-Qushayribreaks through the common understanding of the metaphor oflight here by focusing on its qualities of energy and movement. Rather thanaccepting the simple equivalence of light as guidance, he gives us the unusualimage of light as something agitating to the heart. What al-Qushayriis talkingabout becomes less clear as he moves from the heart to the innermost secret(sirr, pl. sara1ir)and he gives up on language entirely when it comes to the stateof annihilation.Al-Maybudi’s commentary also recalls the interpretation of Ja2far al-Sadiq, inhis comments on the lights of Muhammad and the believer.Know that the inner lights are different in their respective degrees. The firstis the light of submission (islam) and with the submission is the light of sin-cerity. Another light is faith (iman) and with faith is the light of truthful-ness. Another light is doing beautiful acts (ihsan) and with doing beautifulacts is the light of certainty. The splendor of submission is in the light ofsincerity and the splendor of faith is in the light of truthfulness and thesplendor of doing beautiful acts is in the light of certainty. These arewaystations (manazil) on the path of the religious law and stations(maqamat) of the general believers. There is another light and state (hal) aswell for the people of truth (ahl al-haqiqat) and the brave youths (javan-mardan) of the way, the light of perspicacity (firasat) and with perspicac-ity is the light of unveiling (mukashifat). There is also the light ofuprightness and the light of witnessing (mushahadat). There is also thelight of declaring God’s unity (tawhid) and with declaring God’s unity thereis the light of nearness (qurbat) in the presence of “withness” (2indiyyat).Until the servant has been in these stations, he will be captive to hisown way.

A poem:A sword of Indian steel drawn from amongst the swords of God.86Al-Maybudicombines this style of interpretation with the relating of ahadithand traditions from the Companions and the Followers of the Prophet which illus-trate the light possessed by believers. More so than any of the other commentatorsstudied here, al-Maybudiuses and develops the literary quality of this material.The first hadithhe cites is an appealing anecdote from the Prophet concerning thesuperior light of those believers who have suffered the most.It is related that AbuSa2id al-Khudri87said: I was among a group of pooremigrants, some of whom were veiling others from their nakedness. Wewere listening to the recitation of the Qur1an. The Prophet came up andstood over us. The reciter saw him and became silent. He greeted him,saying, “What are you doing?” We said, “O Messenger of God, the reciter isreciting to us and we are listening to his recitation.” The Messenger of Godsaid, “Praise be to God who has made those in my community towardswhom I have been commanded to make myself patient.” Then he sat downamidst us in order to occupy himself with us. . . The faces [of the poor emi-grants] became illuminated. . . The Prophet said, “Rejoice you who havenothing! You will enter the garden in perfect light before the wealthybelievers by half of a day whose reckoning will be five hundred years.”88COMMENTARY132"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The next hadithwhich al-Maybudicites is, “God created His creation indarkness, then cast some of His light upon them.”89Al-Maybudiexpands theimagery of the hadithand links the primordial event it describes to the possibilityof states in the believer in this world.The similitude of this light is such that Mustafahas said, “God createdthe creation in darkness then sprinkled upon them some of His light.”Mankind was a handful of dust remaining in their own darkness, a dark-ness whose quality had become bewilderment, remaining unaware in theveil of creation. Everything in the pre-eternal heavens received the rainof the lights of eternity. The dust became narcissus, the stone became thejewel, the color of the heavens and the earth followed in each other’sfootsteps. It is said that the quality of “dustness” is everything which isdarkness but a quality is everything which should be bright and pure.A subtle substance (latifa) became joined to that quality, and the expres-sion for that subtle substance is found in “He sprinkled upon them someof His light.” They asked, “O Messenger of God, what are the signs ofthis light?”90He said, When the light is made to enter the heart, thebreast expands.” When the standard of the just sultan enters the city, noseat remains for the crowd. When the breast becomes open with thedivine light, the aspiration (himma) becomes high, the sad becomes tran-quil, and the enemy the friend. Dispersion becomes union (jam2) in theheart, the carpet of subsistence (baqa1) is spread out while the mat ofannihilation (fana1) is rolled up, and the cloister of the anxiety is boltedwhile the garden of union (wisal) is opened.91Al-Maybudi1s last illustration is a long story which he says is taken from thetraditions concerning an unnamed scholar among the Followers of the Prophet.The scholar had been captured while participating in one of the military campaignsagainst the Roman army and remained among the Romans for some time. One dayhe was present with some 30,000 Romans who had gathered in the desert to heara bishop who came out of his monastery once every four years to give advice tothe people. The bishop ascended the pulpit but stood there without speaking.Finally he told his audience that he was unable to speak to them because of theMuslim amongst them. The people did not know who this was and the Muslim wasafraid to identify himself, but the bishop was able to find him by looking closelyinto the faces of the people. He asked him to come and speak with him.[The narrator of this tale said]: He said to me, “You are a Muslim?”I said, “Yes, I am a Muslim.”He said, “Are you among those who are knowledgeable or ignorant?”I said, “Regarding that which I know I am knowledgeable and that which I donot know I am a student.

I recognized the light of faith and unity in you which shone fromyour face.” Then in a loud voice he questioned me. “Your messenger has saidto you that Paradise is a tree of which every lofty chamber is a branch. Whatis the similitude of that in the world?”I said, “The similitude of that tree in the world is the sun, with an orb everyray of which is a branch.”The bishop said, “You have spoken truly.” He asked the second question:“Your messenger said that the people of Paradise consume food and drink butno defilement comes out of them. What is the similitude of that in theworld?”I said, “The embryo in the womb of its mother who eats but does not defecate.”The bishop said, “You have spoken truly.” He asked the third question. “Themessenger of God said that on the Day of Resurrection every morsel, atomand grain of alms will be like a great mountain on the Scales. What is thesimilitude of that in the world?”I said, “When the sun rises at daybreak or sets in the evening it causes theruins of a house which is in reality short to appear tall.”The bishop said, “You have spoken truly.”Then the Muslim asked him, “What is the number of the doors of theGardens?”He said, “Eight.”He said, “What are the numbers of the doors of Hell?”He said, “Seven.”He said, “What is it that is written on the door of the Garden?”The Muslim said that when he asked this of him, the bishop was unable togive an answer. The Romans called out to him to give an answer so that thisstranger would not say that the bishop did not know. The bishop said, “If thisanswer is forced, it will not bode well for the belt (zunnar)92and the cross.”He tore open his belt and threw down his cross and said in a loud voice, “Itis written on the door of the Garden that there is no God but God andMuhammad is the messenger of God!”93COMMENTARY134"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"When the Romans heard this they began to throw rocks and insults at thebishop. The bishop wept and called out to tell the people that 700 angels werecoming to carry 700 martyrs to their deaths, and it did come to pass that700 Romans joined the bishop that day in becoming Muslims and were killed bytheir fellow Romans. Al-Maybuditells us thatthe point of this tale is that the light of one believer who declared theunity of God shone amongst the handful of fighters and infidels so thatthe bishop saw and did what he did.94In this story the inner light of the believer is not merely a metaphor for faith, buta perceptible light which can be seen, at least by some.What unites the very different styles of the Suficommentaries cited here is theway in which they avoid using the word “light” in this Qur1anic verse as a simplemetaphor for “guidance” or something similar. The issue, as Izutsu explains in anarticle on metaphorical thinking in Iranian Sufism, has to do with the relationshipbetween language and one’s understanding of reality. Aristotle defines metaphorin his Poeticsas a linguistic sign functioning in a dual role by pointing simulta-neously to a literal or conventional meaning and to another figurative meaning ornon-conventional. Izutsu suggests that this is a problematic definition for Sufisbecause, for them, what would ordinarily be the figurative meaning is, in fact, themore literal or “real” meaning and correspondingly, the conventional meaning isthe more figurative. He is not saying that Sufis never use metaphors in theAristotelian sense of the term, but he distinguishes these from what he calls“archetypal metaphors” like light and darkness. Archetypal metaphors are notartificially or artistically created but rather are the result of mystic experience.When the mystic experiences spiritual light, he is not perceiving something sim-ilar to light, but rather sees a light far more powerful and “real” than physicallight. The mystic does not choose a metaphor to describe his visionary experi-ence; the metaphor or symbol does not point to something other than itself butrather is an indicator of its own self and the mystic has merely perceived this real-ity. Seen from the outside, the mystic’s description of this reality appears to be ametaphor, but this is only because the observer has not grasped the true nature ofthings.95The use of the word “light” in the manner described by Izutsu does seem tooccur in many of the Sufiinterpretations cited here. However, the interpretationsare best characterized as expressing more than one type of language use, by bothan acceptance and elaboration of the meaning of “light” as “guidance” and adescription of another, more literal, meaning similar to the Prophet’s statement, “Isee a light.” The acceptance of interpretations based on this literal understandingof “light” will depend on the reader’s acceptance or rejection of subjectivemystical experience.QUR1AN 24:35 (THE LIGHT VERSE)135"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONAlthough the styles of the Suficommentaries studied here are quite different,there is a shared hermeneutical base of assumptions concerning the nature of theQur1anic text, the way in which knowledge of its meanings is acquired, and thenature of the self who seeks understanding. The first of these assumptions is thatthe Qur1an is a multi-layered and ambiguous text open to endless interpretation, aconcept most frequently illustrated by the metaphor of the ocean and its treasures.However, this insistence upon the infinite possibilities of the text is not consid-ered license justifying the production of any and all interpretations. The fact thatthe ocean can be a dangerous place corresponds, in this metaphor, to the dangersthatSufis identify in attempting to understand God’s words. Al-Ghazali, as wehave seen, suggests that those who are not good swimmers should not even try.Al-Simnani’s use of the hadithprohibiting interpretation by mere personal opinion(ra1y) locates the possibility for error at each level of interpretation.The problem that open-ended interpretation presents is seen as both spiritualand political by Sufis in that it comprises both a fundamental danger to one’s eter-nal soul and a more immediate danger in this world from other Muslims who con-siderSufiinterpretations as a distortion of the true meanings of the Qur1anic text.Al-Ghazali’s defense of Sufiinterpretation in his Fa ysal al-tafriqais an attemptto protect Sufis from the serious legal reprisals connected to the charge of disbe-lief (takfir). The weaknesses of his arguments in this book result from the fact thathe attempts to rebut his opponents on their own terms rather than questioningtheir basic assumptions. His strongest argument, found in the Ihya1 2ulum al-din,is the simplest, namely that restricting the meaning of the Qur1an to what has beentransmitted from the Companions and Followers amounts to an unacceptablerestriction of the Qur1an’s potentiality. Although most obvious in al-Ghazali, thepolitical tension that Sufiinterpretations created is apparent in other writingsstudied here as well, in the use of the terms “common people” (2awamm) and“elite” (khawass), a somewhat defensive dichotomy reflecting judgment on if notoutright disdain for those who disagree with Suficoncepts and methodology. Thereferences to the Ibn Mas2udhadithand the traditions from 2Aliand Ja2far al-Sadiqserve to legitimize the Sufiapproach by showing its conformity with the viewsof the Companions and Followers.136"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The second shared assumption of Sufiinterpretation concerns knowledgewhich is obtained by means other than the study of the transmitted interpretivetradition and rational thought. According to Ibn Taymiyya, the weakness of Sufiinterpretation is its reliance on subjective knowledge1and consequent vulnerabilityto error. Ibn Taymiyya’s insistence on the importance of referring all interpretationsto the Qur1an and the words of the Prophet and his Companions and Followers isnot so much a rejection of all knowledge by interior experience – although hedoes reject the validity of ecstatic states – but a rejection of the privileging of thatexperience over other, more public forms of knowledge. In contrast, the Sufisstudied here use the language and discourse of the more publicly debatable areasof philosophy, theology, and the transmitted tradition, but always with the under-lying assumption that knowledge of the deeper meanings of the Qur1an is anessentially private experience. Unlike the revelations sent to the prophets, theknowledge which comes to individuals directly from God (2ilm laduni) is notnecessarily beneficial to disclose, a fact illustrated in the story of Musaandal-Khadir: Al-Khadir refuses to explain himself to Musauntil they part. Thecommunication between the two, which in Sufiinterpretations is understood assuggestive of the master–disciple relationship, is oral and private rather than writ-ten and public. In his comments on the Qur1an 3:7, al-Qushayristates that thosewho receive knowledge of the deeper meanings of the Qur1an say what they havebeen commanded to say and, likewise, keep silent when commanded to do so.The third assumption upon which Sufiinterpretation rests concerns the natureof the self seeking understanding of the meanings of the Qur1an. Interpretationbased on interior experience is ever changing because the self is in constant fluxas it moves through different states and stations. In his interpretation of light uponlight, al-Qushayridescribes the heart as agitated by light; knowledge is receivedby means of a series of interactions between the guidance sent to the self andthe efforts it sends out. The subjectivity of the states and stations the selfmoves through make them unverifiable to anyone other than the individualexperiencing them, paving the way to criticisms such as that of Ibn al-Jawziwhodismisses these states altogether as “a delirium without any basis.”2The problemof outside verification of the knowledge obtained by means of states is acknowl-edged by the Sufis as well; while acknowledging the reality of these states gen-erally they also acknowledge the possibility of individual delusion and error.Qur1anic interpretations based on experience are problematic because they maybe misunderstood by those who have not experienced a similar state, as well as bythe interpreter himself if he misunderstands the nature of his own experience.In order to see things as they truly are, the attitude of the self and the efforts itmakes are as important as the states it experiences. Musa’s long and tiring jour-ney searching for the wise man al-Khadir and the frustration and confusion heexperiences being with him is repeatedly referred to in Suficommentaries as ajourney of discipline, of learning proper behavior (ta1dib). As al-Ghazaliexplainsin his Jawahir al-Qur1an, it is arrogance to think that knowledge of the Qur1an’sdeeper meanings can come without intense and persistent spiritual disciplines andCONCLUSION137"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"efforts. In addition to the toil of the journey, there is a further demand placed onMusa, himself a prophet, of unquestioning acceptance of al-Khadir’s bizarre andtroubling actions, a requirement he is unable to fulfill. Maryam’s story, on theother hand, represents the self who does possess the necessary attitude of com-plete and utter subservience towards God and His will, an attitude which in turnfrees her from concern for anything else. The most important and difficult kindof knowledge to obtain, then, for the Sufis is a kind of knowledge that comes notfrom the strivings of the intellect but, rather, as the result of God’s grace and adeeper kind of struggle within man. In his Kitab al-luma2AbuNasr al-Sarrajcharacterizes this struggle in a corporeal way as the sacrifice of one’s verylifeblood.While the hermeneutics of these works is similar, the language and methods ofdiscourse used are very different. Allegoresis is the most controversial type ofSufiinterpretation because it appears to abandon the obvious sense of Qur1anicverses. The strictures against abandoning the obvious sense are behind al-Ghazali’svarious attempts to justify and define acceptable interpretation, and to explain thetheory of correspondences between the spiritual and the material world, andbetween the macrocosm of the universe and the microcosm of man. The methodseems artificial when it consists of lists of these equivalences but substantivewhen the correspondences are more fully described and developed.This kind of allegoresis, or finding correspondences (tatbiq) as al-Kashanicallsit, is different from symbolic Sufiinterpretations which arise from and remain withthe tangible imagery and narratives of the Qur1an. Here, the sensorial and emotionalaspects of the text are emphasized and engaged with in kind: light illuminates, fireburns, and flood waters rage while people have doubts, desires, and longings.Symbolic interpretation uses both concrete and affective language, making use ofmetaphor, poetry, wordplay, narrative, and myth in a way that is unique amongQur1anic commentaries. This is not to say that this kind of language use does notappear in other commentaries; al-Tabariand others, for example, cite pre-Islamicand early Islamic poetry frequently in order to explain the meanings of obscure orambiguous words, but the purpose is etymological while the affective and aestheticelements of the poetry is ignored. Similarly, anecdotes, narratives, and homilies arevery much part of the style of the early traditions transmitted from the Companionsand Followers of the Prophet and continued to be cited in many commentaries.Al-Qurtubiis a good example of a commentator who very much appreciates theappealing and entertaining qualities of this material, ignoring his otherwise rigor-ous standards of authentication to include it. But new stories, such as those toldaboutSufishaykhs, and new homilies, such as al-Maybudi1s discussion of thejourneys of Musa, are rare in this genre, perhaps considered more appropriatelyconfined to the area of preaching. In Sufiinterpretation, poetry, metaphor, story-telling, and myth are accepted wholeheartedly, and if anything, take precedenceover more explanatory language. The connection between other genres of Sufiwriting and the Qur1an becomes clearer when one recognizes that these kinds oflanguage acts represent an integral part of the Sufiresponse to the Qur1anic text.CONCLUSION138"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"As important as allegoresis and symbolic interpretation are in Suficommentaries,Sufiinterpretations characterized by close attention paid to words and phrases areequally prominent. Sometimes this takes the form of “rigorous fidelity to thetext” as Chodkiewski defines it in the writings of Ibn 2Arabi. In the texts studiedhere, the fact that al-Khadir switches pronouns in speaking to Musa, from“I wanted” to “We wanted” to “Your Lord wanted” is considered highly significantand commented on accordingly. The approach can also be meditative and didactic,as in the attention paid to unusual words such as 2ilm laduniandmuharrar. Unlikethe allegorical approach, which raises concerns about reading alien concepts intothe Qur1anic text, this approach remains very much within the text. Many of theseinterpretations, like the symbolic interpretations, constitute a literary form ofcommentary that has not always been recognized as such.CONCLUSION139"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"APPENDIXCommentators on the Qur1anTo contextualize the work of Suficommentators, several commentaries have beenreferred to throughout this study. The following provides brief biographicalinformation and descriptions of the style and contents of these commentaries.Al-TabariAbuJa2far Muhammad b. Jarir al-Tabariwas born in Tabaristan in northern Iranbut spent most of his life in Baghdad, where he died in 923.1According to onestory, he first arrived in Baghdad hoping to study with Ahmad b. Hanbal butfound that he had recently died. Al-Tabarihimself attempted to establish a sepa-rate school of law based on his own principles, but apparently it was not distinctenough from Shaf2ism to survive his death. Instead, his fame rests upon two mon-umental works: his history of the world, Mukhtasar ta1rikh al-rusul wa’l-mulukwa’l-khulafa1, and his Qur1anic commentary, Jami1al-bayan2an ta1wilay Qur1an.The commentary marks the beginning of the classical period of Qur1anic com-mentaries, and is important for the vast amount of information it contains fromthe earliest sources of Islam.In the edition used for this study, the Jami2al-bayancomprises thirty partsprinted in twelve volumes.2Al-Tabariusually begins his exegesis by paraphras-ing a verse with the use of synonyms, prefaced by the phrase, “He (God) says”(yaqula) or “He (or it) means” (ya2ni). He then provides philological informationon the verse, including variant readings, definitions and etymologies of problem-atic words, and solutions to grammatical difficulties. The comments are based onnamed or unnamed reciters of the Qur1an (al-qurra1), Arabists (ahl al-2arabiyya),grammarians (nahwiyyun), and evidence from Arab speech patterns (taqulual-2arab) and poems. After establishing the basic meaning of the text, al-Tabariaddresses intratextual and extratextual problems of meaning, noting differencesof opinion. The sources that al-Tabariuses to solve these problems of meaningare the Qur1an itself, the ahadithof the Prophet, and the exegetical Traditionsattributed to his Companions and Followers. Al-Tabari’s commentary is oftenreferred to as the first and foremost example of “interpretation by the transmittedtradition” (tafsir bi1l-ma1thur) because of the enormous quantity of ahadithand140"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Traditions which he includes. When quoting ahadithhe often gives numerousversions with different chains of transmission (asanid). He also supplies the fullchain of transmission for Traditions related from the Companions and Followers,chains which end with al-Tabarihimself.3After quoting the ahadithandTraditions, al-Tabariusually expresses his preferred interpretation, sometimesproviding his reasoning, and sometimes not.Al-ZamakhshariAbu’l-Qasim Mahmud b. 2Umar al-Zamakhshariwas born in the province ofKhwarazm south of the Aral Sea and died there in 1144 after years of studyingand teaching which took him to such cities as Baghdad and Mecca.4He was a par-ticularly sought after teacher in the areas of Arabic grammar and philology. Hisbest known work is his tafsir,Al-Kashshaf2anhaqa1iq al-tanzil, a work whichwas greatly admired and quoted for its linguistic insights while censured for itsMu2taziliviews. 2Abd Allah b. 2Umar al-Baydawi(d. 1286 or 1293) produced acommentary entitled Anwar al-tanzil wa-asrar al-ta’wilwhich is mostly anabridged version of al-Zamakhshari’s work purged of its suspect theology. Fakhral-Din al-Raziappears to have used Al-Kashshaf2anhaqa1iq al-tanzilas a basisfor his own commentary,5as did al-Nisaburi.6Al-Zamakhshari’s commentary comprises four volumes.7He is far more selectivethan al-Tabariin the ahadithand Traditions he chooses to include; those he doescite are often quoted anonymously and without any chain of transmission (isnad),introducted merely by “it has been said” (qila) or “it has been related” (ruwiya).The result is little repetition and a far more condensed style, although he demon-strates an interest, like al-Tabari, in expanding Qur1anic narratives by providingdetails such as names of people and places, and story background. Johns hasnoted al-Zamakhshari1s fondness for this material, and the similarity between hisaccounts and those found in al-Tha2labi’sQisasal-anbiya1.8More so than al-Tabari,al-Zamakhsharimakes the occasional tentative step towards homiletics bysuggesting lessons to be learned from certain Qur1anic verses.Al-Zamakhshari’s commentary is punctuated by the questions that he asks ofthe text using classic kalamspeech: “For if you were to say...” (fa-in qulta),“I would say...” (qultu). The questions pertain to linguistic, narrative, or theologicalissues. His discussions of linguistic issues are more involved and subtle thanal-Tabari’s, and are often used to support theological concerns, namely, the rejectionof anthropomorphic interpretations and the affirmation of the miraculous nature(i2jaz) of the Qur1an.Fakhr al-Din al-RaziAbu2Abd Allah Muhammad b. 2Umar b. al-Husayn Fakhr al-Din al-Raziwas bornin the Persian town of Rayy five years after the death of al-Zamakhshari. The yearsafter finishing his studies were difficult ones, as his outspokenness provoked theAPPENDIX: COMMENTATORS ON THE QUR1AN141"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"antagonism of Mu2tazilis and Karramiyya9in the areas through which he traveled.He finally found patronage, wealth, and prestige in Heart where he spent most ofhis life before dying in 1210.10Although still a thorn in the side of some, al-Raziwas a popular preacher and sought after teacher. He seems to have possessed agenuine piety combined with both intellectual virtuosity and an abrasive person-ality. He is often labeled a philosopher–theologian because of his interest in bothareas of Islamic thought.Al-Razi’s connection to Sufism is unclear. We know that Ibn 2Arabi sent him aletter inviting him to consider the differences between mystical and rational knowl-edge.11According to several biographical sources, he is said to have met the Sufiteacher Najm al-Din Kubraand asked to become his disciple, but the outcome ofthis meeting is uncertain. Wherever al-Razi1s ultimate loyalties lie, his interest inphilosophy, theology, and Sufism are all apparent in his tafsir, which is known aseitherMafatihal-ghayborKitab al-tafsir al-kabir, and is considered his mostimportant work. Ibn Taymiyya scoffed at the work, saying that it contained every-thing except tafsir, whereas its admirers insisted that it contained everything else inaddition to tafsir. It is an encyclopedic work, similar in length to al-Tabari’stafsir.Al-Raziusually begins his discussion of a verse by examining its place withinthe larger context of the suraor the Qur1an as a whole, finding evidence of theinimitability (i2jaz) of the Qur1an in the ordering and sequencing of its verses.After addressing such contextual issues, al-Razisometimes points out the lessonsto be learned by a verse before proceeding to his summaries of the transmittedexegetical Traditions. Like al-Zamakhshari, he does not always identify the salafisources for this material, but he is more likely to present the full range of inter-pretations. Al-Raziis inclined to draw attention to the majority opinion particu-larly when he is about to disagree with it. He also demonstrates his independencefrom traditional exegetical discourse by including such authorities as Ibn SinaandAbuHamid al-Ghazali, although the traditional authorities he cites far outweighthe nontraditional.Al-Raziuses al-Zamakhshari’sAl-Kashshaf2anhaqa1iq al-tanzilas a basis forhis philological and grammatical comments, although in an abridged form and notuncritically.12Al-Raziaddresses the theological issues raised by the Qur1anic textfar more insistently and comprehensively than al-Zamakhshari, and he searches foranswers in a far more expanded intellectual universe, calling upon the ideas ofMu2tazilis, philosophers, and Sufis in addition to their more orthodox Sunnicoun-terparts. Structurally, he conducts these discussions by dividing his commentaryon individual verses into various “issues” (masa1il), “questions” (as1ila), “aspects”(wujuh), “topics” (mabahith), and “parts” (aqsam), an arrangement his biographeral-Safadisays he was the first one to use.13Al-QurtubiAbu2Abd Allah Muhammad b.

The best known of his works is his Qur1anic com-mentary entitled Al-Jami2li-ahkam al-Qur1an wa1l-mubayyin li-matadammanamin al-sunna wa-ayat al-furqan. It is approximately the same size as thecommentaries of al-Tabariand al-Razi, comprising twenty slim volumes.15Al-Qurtubi’s commentary is renowned for the large number of ahadithheincludes therein, many of which are not found in al-Tabari. Al-Tabarilimits hisahadithand Traditions to those which directly comment on Qur1anic verses,whereas al-Qurtubiincludes others as well which are thematically related. Whilehe is sometimes meticulous in addressing the authenticity of this material, hemakes surprisingly frequent use of the more controversial isra2iliyatmaterialfound in the works of AbuIshaq al-Tha2labi(d. 1036).16Al-Qurtubialso makes extensive use of the works of post-salafiexegetes,demonstrating the virtuosity of a keen mind well aware of the complex issueswhich divided these exegetes as well as the Muslim community at large, and heoften displays a jurist’s desire to define the boundaries of acceptable thought andpractice. Like al-Razi, he frequently divides his commentary according to theissues (masa1il) raised by one or more verses, although he does not resort to any-thing like al-Razi1s extensive subdivisions and his writing style is far morestraightforward and clear. Al-Qurtubiis markedly less interested in theologicalissues than al-Razi; of greater concern to him are the legal ramifications of theQur1anic text. His mastery of the many disciplines employed in tafsir, however, isundeniable, and Calder has suggested that is was al-Qurtubiwho most fully realizedthe possibilities of the genre.17Ibn TaymiyyaTa qial-Din Ahmad b. Taymiyya was a Hanbalitheologian and jurist who led aneventful life as an outspoken activist.18Born in Harran, Syria in 1263, he wasforced at the early age of five to flee with his family from the Mongols toDamascus where he lived most of his life. Coming from a family of renownedHanbalischolars, he took over his father’s directorship of the Sukkariyyamosqueandmadrasaat the age of twenty and later taught at the oldest Hanbalimadrasain Damascus, the Hanbaliyya.Ibn Taymiyya’s long career of controversial activism began at the age of thirtywhen he was briefly imprisoned for organizing a protest against the authorities’inaction with regards to a prominent Christian accused of insulting the Prophet.As was to be the case in the many incarcerations to follow, he spent his time inprison writing, producing his first great work. In the years that followed, IbnTaymiyya’s influence grew as he exhorted the people of Damscus to jihadagainstthe Mongols and their Shi2isupporters, and as he accompanied the fightingarmies. Apparently unconcerned with his own safety or well-being, Ibn Taymiyyawrote treatise after treatise attacking any doctrine or practice, however popular,APPENDIX: COMMENTATORS ON THE QUR1AN143"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"which he felt degraded the original, pure message of Islam. The objects of hispolemics included kalam, philosophy, popular saint worship, antinomian Sufis,the followers of Ibn 2Arabi, and Shi2is. He died in a prison in Damascus in 1328.Ibn Taymiyya’s relationship to Sufism is complicated. He appears to have beena member of the Qadariyyaorder19and wrote of his respect for several individ-ualSufis.20However, he was fiercely opposed to many aspects of Sufidoctrineand practice based on his assessment of their heretical nature. The extent of IbnTaymiyya’s criticism is such that, using his creedal criteria, few of the major writ-ings of Sufism would be considered sound. Nonetheless, he seems to have desiredto reform the tradition from within by carefully separating the sound from thefalse in both Sufidoctrine and practice. He writes approvingly of the moral andethical focus of Sufiwritings while rejecting what he perceives to be faulty con-clusions regarding the nature of the relationship between man and God. Thesefaulty conclusions, according to Ibn Taymiyya, are the result of turning awayfrom the teachings of the Prophet and the pious first generations (salaf), substi-tuting their wisdom with the inferior tools of kalamand philosophy, and conceptsbased on excessive emotional states.21Ibn Taymiyya managed to write profusely on many different subjects, producingcreeds, legal judgments, polemical and exegetical works. In the last category, hewrote the hermeneutical work Muqaddima fiusul al-tafsirand commentaries ona few Qur1anicsuras and ayat. These commentaries reflect the epistemologicalprinciple laid out in his Muqaddimathat knowledge is either the result of authen-tic transmission (naql musaddaq) or verifiable deduction (istidlal muhaqqaq).Although Ibn Taymiyya is most often associated with the term “transmitted inter-pretation” (tafsir bi1l-ma1thur), it is the use of deduction (istidlal) which is moststriking in his exegesis. Al-Tabari1s commentary on Surat al-Ikhlasconsists ofabout four pages of transmitted material from the first generations of Muslims(salaf). This material is expanded to almost 300 pages in Ibn Taymiyya’s com-mentary with his original arguments and reformulations, all firmly based onsalafiviews.22Ibn Taymiyya’s exegetical works read more like treatises than lineby line commentary.The style is quite different than the famous commentary of Ibn Taymiyya’s stu-dent, Ibn Kathir (d. 1373), Tafsir al-Qur1an al-2azim. While Ibn Kathir explicitlyadopts the methodology of Ibn Taymiyya, even copying a portion of hisMuqaddimainto his introduction,23he is much more sparing in his use of deduc-tion in his commentary, confining himself almost exclusively to the process ofsifting through the transmitted material and selecting what he deems most authen-tic. When he ventures beyond this, it is usually to serve as a spokesperson for themore independent thought of his teacher.APPENDIX: COMMENTATORS ON THE QUR1AN144"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"GLOSSARY OF TERMSTerms related to human faculties2aqlIntellect, reason.isti2dadThe preparedness or aptitude of individual human souls.lata1if(s.latif)(1) Subtle interpretations of the Qur1an or (2) subtle faculties inhumans.nafsSoul.al-nafs al-ammaraThe demanding soul.al-nafs al-lawwamaThe blaming or reproachful soul.al-nafs al-mutma1innaThe soul at peace.qalbHeart.ruhSpirit.sirrSecret or innermost heart.Terms related to knowledge or ways of seeking knowledgeadab(pl.adab)Disciplined and refined ways of acting and speaking.dhawqTasting.hal(pl.ahwal)State.ijtihadThe process of seeking understanding of the Qur1an based on anindividual’s independent investigation and judgment.ilhamInspiration.2ilm al-ahwalKnowledge that comes from spiritual states.2ilm badihiIntuitive knowledge of self-evident truths.2ilmdaruriNecessary knowledge (as opposed to acquired knowledge); knowledgethat comes without the need for reflection or examination of proofs; sensoryknowledge.2ilm kasbi(oriktisabi)Knowledge that is acquired through study.2ilm laduniKnowledge that comes to individuals directly from God.kashfThe process of obtaining knowledge by “unveiling.”riyadaSpiritual discipline.wahyA kind of revelation that is not restricted to prophets.145"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Terms related to the interpretation and interpreters of the Qur1anbatinThe inner or esoteric meaning of Qur1anic verses.batiniyyaA derogatory name used to describe those who reject the exotericsense of Qur1anic verses.darb al-mithalThe creating of similitudes or parables; making analogies.hadith(pl.ahadith)The sayings of the Prophet Muhammad.isharaAllusion; a silent signal or gesture.lata1if(1) Subtle interpretations of the Qur1an or (2) subtle faculties in humans.majazFigurative expression or metaphor.muhkamatClear and unambiguous verses in the Qur1an.mutashabihatAmbiguous verses in the Qur1an that can be interpreted indifferent ways.muttala2A high place from which one can view things clearly, meaning either(1) the vantage point from which one views the Resurrection or (2) one offour aspects of the Qur1an described in a hadith.al-rasikhun fi1l-2ilmThose firmly rooted in knowledgewho are qualified tointerpret the Qur1an.al-salaf al-salihThe pious first generations after the Prophet Muhammad whosecomments on the meaning of the Qur1an form the basis of the exegeticaltradition.tafsirCommentary on the Qur1an.tafsir bi1l-ma1thurCommentary on the Qur1an based on the ahadithand theinterpretations of the pious first generations (al-salaf al-salih).tafsir bi1l-ra1yA term usually used to refer to blameworthy commentary on theQur1an based on mere opinion, but also sometimes used to refer positively toexegesis based on reasoning.tatbiqTo make or find correspondences between two things.ta1wilA term originally synonymous with tafsirbut which came to mean(1) interpretation of anthropomorphic or other Qur1anic verses that areambiguous in meaning or (2) esoteric interpretation of the Qur1an.2ulama1Religious scholars.zahir(1) The obvious or apparent sense of Qur1anic verses or (2) the exotericmeaning of the Qur1an.GLOSSARY OF TERMS146"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"147NOTESINTRODUCTION1 I.

The English translation here is that of Elias based onhis reading of manuscript editions of al-Simnani’sTafsirin Istanbul and Damascus.22 Ibid., 108. Elias is paraphrasing al-Simnanihere.23 The cosmological terms which al-Simnaniuses in his interpretation have a long historyinSufism and can be traced to several sources (see L. Gardet’s “2Alam al-Djabarut,2Alamal-malakut,2Alam al-mithal” and R. Arnaldez’s “Lahut and Nasut,” in The Encyclopaediaof Islam, new ed, Leiden: Brill, 1960–2002). Elias suggests that al-Simnanimay havebeen the first to use these terms consistently in a hierarchial fashion (Elias, The ThroneCarrier of God, pp. 154–7). The word “Kingdom” (malakut) is Qur1anic (6:75, 7:185,23:88, and 36:83), and the word “Omnipotence” (jabarut) occurs in the ahadith, but withmeanings not clearly related to levels of existence. The terms “humanity” (nasut) and“divinity” (lahut) are not used in either the Qur1an or the ahadith. The Sufial-Hallaj(d. 922) used these terms, perhaps adopting them from Arab Christians or Imamitheolo-gians (Arnaldez, vol. 5, p. 613). AbuTalib al-Makkiused all four of these terms alongwith a fifth realm of Ipseity (hahut) (C. Glassé,The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam, SanFrancisco, CA: Harper and Row, 1989, pp. 128–32). The five realms were also discussedby the followers and systematizers of Ibn 2Arabi’s thought in what was called the FiveDivine Presences (al-hadarat al-ilahiyyat al-khams) (W.

They follow no one’s authority (taqlid), since in themselves theyhave ‘verified’ (tahqiq) and ‘realized’ (tahaqquq) – through unveiling and finding – thetruth (haqq) and reality (haqiqa) of all things, i.e. the Real Himself (al-haqq).”(W.

Lory’s more extensive analysis of al-Kashani’s commentary, Goldziher hadsuggested that ta1wilwas al-Kashani’s word for the interpretation of passages whose lit-eral meaning was obscure, and that tatbiqwas his word for the symbolic interpretationof passages whose unambiguous literal meaning remains intact. Lory, on the basis ofhis more complete reading of al-Kashani, states that al-Kashaniusedta1wilas thebroader term for all forms of esoteric interpretation, and tatbiqfor the specific type ofesoteric interpretation which uncovers the correspondences between Qur’anic symbolsand man’s spiritual psychology and development (I. Goldziher, Die Richtungen derislamischen Koranauslegung, Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1952, p. 243; P. Lory, Les Commentairesésotériques du Coran d’après2Abd ar-Razzaq al-Qashani, Paris: Les Deux Oceans,1980, pp. 29–33).32 By using the verb “to behold” (ittala2a), al-Kashaniis making a reference to the IbnMas2udhadithregarding levels of meaning in the Qur1an. The noun “lookout point”(muttali2) used in this hadithcomes from the same root as the verb ittala2a.33 Al-Kashani,Ta1wilat, published as Tafsir al-Qur1an al-karimand attributed incorrectlyto Ibn 2Arabi, Beirut: Dar al-Yaqzat al-2Arabiyya, 1968, vol. 1: 5.34 AbuNasr al-Sarraj,Kitab al-luma2, pp. 107–8.35 AbuMuhammad b. abiNasr Ruzbihan al-Baqli,2Ara1is al-bayan fihaqa1iq al-Qur1an,Lucknow, 1989, vol. 1, p. 3.36 This hadith, which is not mentioned in any of the canonical books of hadith, appearsto be a variation on the seven harfsof the Qur1an mentioned in the hadithattributed toIbn Mas2ud and recorded by al-Tabari.372Alaal-Daula Al-Simnani, “Muqaddima tafsir al-Qur1an li-2Ala1al-dawla al-Simnani,”ed.

We have already mentioned that Ibn Taymiyya insists thatthe literal sense of the Qur1anic text must never be abandoned because reason properlyapplied will never contradict the Qur1an or authentic ahadith(B. Abrahamov, “IbnTaymiyya on the Agreement of Reason with Tradition,”Muslim World, 82, 1992,256–72). Ibn 2Arabialso insists that the literal sense must never be abandoned, but fora different reason: perfect knowledge combines both the faculties of the intellect andimagination, both of which are needed to understand God’s revelation (W. Chittick, TheSufi Path of Knowledge: Ibn al-2Arabi’s Metaphysics of Imagination, Albany, NY:SUNY Press, 1998, pp. 199–202).39 Al-Ghazali,Fa ysal al-tafriqa, pp. 9–15.40 Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855) was the founder of the HanbaliSchool of Law. Al-Ghazalistates that there were three ahadithwhich Ibn Hanbal interpreted metaphorically, butcites only two of these interpretations. One example will suffice here. The Prophet said,“The believer’s heart is between the two fingers of the Merciful.” Ibn Hanbal inter-preted these fingers as the touch of the angel and the devil, by means of which Godupsets the hearts of men.41 Traditions based on multiple transmission (bi-tawatur).

However, based on referenceswithin the writings of al-Ghazalito his other works, it is unclear whether it was writtenbefore or after Fa ysal al-tafriqa. In any event, Ihya12ulum al-dinis considered theearliest book of the books discussed here.60 Elsewhere, al-Ghazalidefines the hashawiyyaas those “believing themselves bound toa blind and routine submission to the criterion of human authority and to the literalmeaning of the revealed books” (Iqtisad fi’l i2tiqad, quoted in A.S. Halkin, “TheHashawiyya,”Journal of the American Oriental Society, 54, 1934, 12). According toHalkin, the term was a derogatory term originally directed towards traditionalists(ashab al-hadith) and Hanbalis themselves (Halkin, pp. 1–28).61 Al-Ghazaliis saying that this tradition is either from the Prophet or from 2Ali.62 The root of this verb is the same as that for the noun “similitude” (mithal). Literally, itcould be translated as, “he made himself similar to.”63 Al-Ghazali,Mishkat al-anwar, pp. 32–3. “Taking heed” (i2tibar) and “crossing over”(2ubur) come from the same root as dream or vision interpretation (ta2bir).64 ‘Ala’ al-Dawla Al-Simnani, “Muqaddima tafsir al-Qur’an li-’Alaal-dawla al-Simnani,”Al-Abhath, 1973–71, vol. 26, p. 151.65 Ibid., pp.155–6.

How muchJa2far al-Sadiq1s approach to interpretation influenced both Sufis and Shi2is is difficultto determine. Sufiexegesis came to be characterized by symbolic and literary inter-pretation based on mystical experiences, but the hallmark of Shi2iexegesis was alle-gorical interpretation which found hidden Qur1anic references to 2Ali, Fatima, and theirdescendents. Only one of the manuscripts of Sulami1sHaqa1iqcontains anything likethe latter, and this in only one passage which identifies five beings which received fiveof God’s names: Muhammad, 2Ali, Fatima,Hasan, and Husayn (Sells, Early IslamicMysticism, 77–8).

Wensinck, in his article “al-Khadir” in The Encyclopedia of Islam, new ed.,identifies the common elements as follows. In the Gilgamesh epic, Gilgamesh travelslooking for his ancestor who lives at the mouth of the rivers and has been given eter-nal life. In the Alexander romance, Alexander is accompanied by his cook Andreas inhis search for the spring of life. At one point in their difficult journey, Andreas washesa salted fish in a spring that causes it to come alive and swim away. Andreas jumps inafter it and attains immortality. In the Jewish legend, the prophet Elijah travels withRabbi Joshua ben Levi, with the condition that he accepts his actions unconditionally.Elijah performs a series of seemingly outrageous acts that are ultimately explained tothe perplexed Joshua (vol. 4; pp. 902b–3a).2 A.J.

It is possible that he is using the adjective nazariin its broadest sense to refer to consideration (nazar) by the five physical senses andthe intellect before it engages in the processes of inference or deduction. But then heuses the noun “consideration” (nazar) in the opposite category, to describe an acquiredform of knowledge. It is this second usage that is the more common, and the term spec-ulative knowledge (2ilm nazari) is often used as a synonym for acquired (muktasaborkasbi) knowledge.

According to Watt, in Al-Risalat al-laduniyya, al-Ghazaligives precedenceto reason (2aql) over revelation, and he makes a distinction between revelation (wahy)and inspiration (ilham). The first idea is contrary to the precedence given to revelationin al-Ghazali’sAl-Munqidh min al-dalaland the second idea is not discussed there or intheMishkat al-anwar, an omission Watt finds puzzling if this distinction was part of al-Ghazali’s belief (“The Authenticity of the Works Attributed to al-Ghazali,”Journal ofthe Royal Asiatic Society, 1952, pp. 33–4). In response to Asin’s textual evidence, themention of a treatise by al-Ghazalion2ilm ladunniin al-Razi’stafsirdemonstrates thata book on this topic attributed to al-Ghazaliexisted before 1209, the year of al-Razi’sdeath, at which time Ibn 2Arabiwas in his early forties. It seems unlikely then, that Ibn2Arabi’sAl-Risala fi1l-nafs wa1l-ruhcould have been the source of the treatise mentionedhere. The additional arguments made by Watt on the basis of the content of the Risalaal-laduniyyaare not, in my opinion, sufficient to disprove the authenticity of the work.Al-Ghazaliis not elevating the human faculty of the intellect over revelation in Al-Risala al-laduniyya, but rather the Universal Intellect. The distinction between reve-lation and inspiration is found in early Sufism, so its adoption by al-Ghazaliisunsurprising and is not inconsistent with the ideas found in his Ihya1 2ulum al-din.31 Al-Ghazali,Al-Risalat al-laduniyya, Cairo, n.d., pp. 19–26. A English translation ofthis treatise was done by M. Smith, “Al-Risalat Al-Laduniyya,”Journal of the RoyalAsiatic Society, 1938, 177–200, 353–74.32 The notion of the Universal Soul (al-nafs al-kulli) and the Universal Intellect (al-2aqlal-kulli) are found in the Neoplatonic teachings of Plotinus, as Smith points out in theintroduction to her translation of this treatise, pp. 181–6. Al-Ghazaliunderstands thesemetaphysical concepts as the equivalent of the Qur1anic terms “Tablet” (lawh)(Al-Ghazali,Al-Risalat al-laduniyya, p. 25) and “Pen” (qalam) (Smith’s introductionp. 196, n. 6).33 Cf. Ibn Sinain his Fiithbat al-nubuwwat(Beirut: Dar al-Nahar li1l-Nashr, 1968),where he writes, “Revelation is the emanation and the angel is the received emanatingpower that descends on the prophets as if it were an emanation continuous with theuniversal intellect” (p. 45; English translation taken from M. Marmura, “On the Proofof Prophecies and the Interpretation of the Prophets’ Symbols and Metaphors,” inMedieval Political Philosophy:A Sourcebook, eds. R. Lerner and M. Mahdi, Ithaca,NY: Cornell University Press, 1963, p. 115); for an analysis of Ibn Sina1s ideas on thenature of prophecy and the Intellect as a cause of human thought, see H.A. Davidson’sAlfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect: Their Cosmologies, Theories of theActive Intellect, and Theories of Human Intellect, Oxford: Oxford University Press,"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"1992, pp. 83–94, 116–23). Davidson demonstrates the influence of Ibn Sinaonal-Ghazali1sMishkat al-anwar(pp. 129–44), an influence that is also apparent inAl-Risalat al-laduniyya. Curiously, a copy of Al-Risalat al-laduniyyaexists in amanuscript attributed to Ibn Sinain a library in Istanbul. It is listed as Al-2Ilm al-laduniin G.C. Anawati’s comprehensive bibliography of works attributed to Ibn Sina(Mu1allafat Ibn Sina, Cairo: Dar al-Ma2arif, 1950, p. 231) and has been publishedas such in H.2Asi’sAl-tafsir al-Qur1aniwa1l lughat al-sufiyya fifalsafa Ibn Sina, Beirut:Al-Mu1assasat al-Jami2iyya li’l-Dirasat wa1l-Nashr wa’l-Tazi2, 1983. Neither Anawatinor2Asimention that it is the same work as the work attributed to al-Ghazali.34 We have already seen that al-Ghazalirecommends in his Fa ysal al-tafriqathat the Sufiwho claims to be released from the obligations of religious law should be killed(Dar al-Nashr al-Maghrabiyya, 1983), p. 28.35 Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jami2li-ahkam al-Qur1an, vol. 11, pp. 40–1.36 Ibid., vol. 11, pp. 28–32.37 Material which al-Maybudiuses as well in his discussion of the same topic in his Kashfal-asrar wa 2uddat al-abrar, Tehran: Amir Kabir, 1982–3, vol. 20, p. 232, as part of hiscommentary on the miraculous and instantaneous transporting of the throne of theQueen of Saba1to the court of Sulayman (Qur1an 27:38).38 Faris b. 2Isaal-Dinawarial-Baghdadi(d. 951).39 Al-Sulami,Haqa1iq al-tafsir, vol. 1, p. 415 and Ruzbihan,2Ara1is al-bayanvol. 1, p. 593.40 Abu’l-Husayn al-Husri(d. 981).41 Al-Sulami,Haqa1iq al-tafsir, vol. 1, p. 415 and Ruzbihan,2Ara1is al-bayan, vol. 1, p. 593.42 Al-Qushayri,Lata1if al-isharat, vol. 4, p. 78.43 Ibid., vol. 4, p. 83.44 Al-Tha2labi,Qisasal-anbiya1: Musammabi1l-2Ara1is al-majalis, Egypt: Maktabatal-Jumhuriyya al-2Arabiyya, 195?, p. 123.45 Al-Tha2labi’s2Ara1is al-majalisis considered to be the first independent collection ofstories of the prophets (T. Nagel, “Kisasal-Anbiya1” in The Encyclopedia of Islam, newed. and W.M. Thackston, Introduction to The Tales of the Prophets of al-Kisa1i, Boston,MA: Twayne Publishers, 1978, p. xvi). This material from Jews and Christians wasconsidered problematic fairly early on in the Muslim community. G. Newby has sug-gested that the isra1iliyyatnarratives included in al-Tabari1stafsiralready represent“the remains of a moribund tradition” that found a more congenial home in the genreofqisasal-anbiya1because of its less exacting standards (“Tafsir Isra1iliyat,”Journalof the American Academy of Religion, 47, 1979, 685–97). Al-Tha2labi’stafsir, Al-Kashfwa2l-bayan2an tafsir al-Qur1an, was criticized for its use of the same kind of material.Ibn Taymiyya praised the exegete al-Baghawi(d. sometime between 1117 and 1122)for writing an abridged version of al-Tha2labi’stafsirpurged of the “inferior traditionsand heretical opinions,” thereby producing a tafsirthat Ibn Taymiyya judged superiorto those of al-Zamakhshariand al-Qurtubi, two exegetes who quoted al-Tha2labifrequently (quoted in P.G. Riddell, “The Transmission of Narrative-Based Exegesis inIslam” in Islam: Essays on Scripture, Thought and Society, eds P.G. Riddell andT. Street, Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1997, p. 67).46 R. Arnaldez states that al-Qurtubimade very little use of this material (“Al-Üurtubi” inThe Encyclopedia of Islam, new ed., vol. 5, p. 531b), but the index to al-Qurtubi’stafsir, Faharis al-Jami2li-ahkam al-Qur1an(Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-2Ilmiyya, 1988)cites something like 250 citations from al-Tha2labialone, and as mentioned in theprevious note, Ibn Taymiyya criticized al-Qurtubifor using this material. One exampleof al-Qurtubi’s use of al-Tha2labi’s material will demonstrate what is at issue here. It isa comment on Musa’s reaction to al-Khadir’s killing of the boy.When Musasaid, “Have you killed an innocent soul...?,” al-Khadirbecome angry. He ripped off the left shoulder of the boy and then peeledNOTES164"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"NOTES165the skin off of it. There, on the bone of the shoulder, was written, ‘Aninfidel who will never believe in God” (Al-Qurtubi,Al-Jami2li-ahkamal-Qur1an, vol.11:21, Al-Tha2labi, Qisasal-anbiya1, p. 127).This tradition would seem to warrant questioning because it contradicts the chronologyof the Qur1anic narrative in which al-Khadir refuses to explain his actions until theypart. Al-Qurtubidemonstrates his critical method with regard to traditions elsewhere inhistafsir, but here he is silent, and one wonders whether his choice to include thismaterial is based on his appreciation of the entertaining manner in which it is written.The genre of the stories of the prophets (qisasal-anbiya1) was closely connected to thepreaching profession where the importance of keeping the attention of one’s audiencewith a story well told was understood.47 In his Risalaal-Qushayricalls the station of desire (irada) the first station of those whoseek God (Principles of Sufism, trans. B. von Schlegell, Berkeley, CA: Mizan Press,1992, p. 175).48 Al-Maybudi,Kashf al-asrar, vol. 16, pp. 726–8.49 Ibid., pp. 728–9.50 Ibid., p. 729.51 A reference to Qur1an 89:27–8:O soul at peace return to your Lord, well pleased andwell-pleasing. The Sufis believed in a potential progression of the soul from that whichcommands evil (al-nafs al-ammara) as in Qur1an 12:53, truly the soul commands evilunless my Lord has mercy, to the soul which blames (al-nafs al-lawwama) as in Qur1an75:2,Nay, I call to witness the blaming soul, to the soul at peace (al-nafsal-mutma1inna) (A. Schimmel, Mystical Dimensions of Islam, Chapel Hill, NC:University of North Carolina Press, 1975, p. 112). For al-Kashani’s definition of thesethree stages see note 61.52 Al-Maybudi,Kashf al-asrar, vol. 16, pp. 729–30.53 The expression “the one who was carried (mahmul)” is also used in al-Qushayri.54 Ruzbihan,2Ara1is al-bayan, vol. 1, p. 590.55 A reference to the Qur1an 25:53, It is He who has let forth the two seas. This one issweet and thirst-quenching, and the other is salty and bitter, and 35:12, The two seasare not alike. This one is sweet, thirst-quenching and pleasant to drink and the other issalty and bitter.56 Al-Kashani,Ta1wilat, published as Tafsir al-Qur1an al-karimand attributed incorrectlyto Ibn 2Arabi, Beirut: Dar al-Yaqzat al-2Arabiyya, 1968, vol. 1, p. 766.57 Al-Kashani, as has been mentioned, was a follower of the ideas of Ibn 2Arabi, but in thispassage his allegiance to Ibn Sinais far more apparent. Ibn 2Arabiadopted some of IbnSina’s terminology and concepts, but adapted them to his own thought far more exten-sively than al-Kashanidoes here; al-Kashani’s interpretation of the Musaand al-Khadirstory follows Ibn Sina’s theories of the soul and knowledge closely. Summaries of thesetheories can be found in S.M. Afnan’sAvicenna: His Life and Works(London: GeorgeAllen and Unwin, 1958), pp. 136–67 and P. Heath’sAllegory and Philosophy inAvicenna(Ibn Sina): With a Translation of the Book of the Prophet Muhammad’s Ascentto Heaven, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1992, pp. 53–106.58 Elsewhere al-Kashaniuses the term Holy Spirit (ruhal-qudus) to describe al-Khadir(Istilahat al-sufiyya, London: Octagon Press, 1991, p. 160). In Ibn Sina’s terminology,the “holy intellect (al-2aql al-qudsi)” refers to a soul which is blessed with the highestlevel of intellectual aptitude, an aptitude reserved for prophets (Heath, Allegory andPhilosophy in Avicenna, pp. 89–90).59 Al-Kashani,Ta1wilat, vol. 1, p. 768–9. Ibn Sinaalso made spiritual discipline a pre-requisite for obtaining higher knowledge in his Al-Isharat wa1l-tanbihat(Tehran,1958), although he does not mention emulation of another nor does he use the term“heart (qalb).”"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"60 Ibn Sinaunderstood the human soul as comprised of three parts: the vegetative (nabati) ornatural (tabi2i) soul which governs the natural processes of the body; the animal(hayawani) soul which governs instinctive and voluntary movement, the latter being basedon desire or anger, and perception through five external and five internal senses; and therational (natiqa) soul, unique to man, which is made up of the practical (2amali) andtheoretical (nazari) intellects which enable men to seek moral and intellectual perfection(Afnan,Avicenna, pp. 136–9; Heath, Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna, pp. 60–5).61 Al-Kashani,Ta1wilat, vol. 1, pp. 769, 772. We have already mentioned the different stagesof the soul in al-Maybudi’s allegorical interpretation. Al-Kashanidefines these threestages as follows. “The commanding soul (al-nafs al-ammara) is that which leanstowards the bodily nature (al-tabi2a al-badaniyya) and commands one to sensual pleas-ures and lusts and pulls the heart (qalb) in a downward direction. It is the resting place ofevil and the source of blameworthy morals and bad actions. God said, truly the soulcommands evil(12:53). The blaming soul (al-nafs al-lawwama) is that which has beenilluminated by the light of the heart to the extent that it awakens from the habit of for-getfulness. It becomes watchful and begins to improve its state, wavering between the twodirections of lordliness and creaturelinesss. Whenever something bad emanates from itsunjust temperament, the light of divine awakening overtakes it and it begins to blameitself and to turn from it, asking for forgiveness and returning to the door of the Forgivingand the Compassionate. Because of this, God mentions it in oaths: Nay, I call to witnessthe blaming soul(75:2). The soul at peace (al-nafs al-mutma1inna) is that whose illumi-nation has been perfected by the light of the heart so that it has lost its blameworthy qual-ities and become shaped by praiseworthy morals. It has turned towards the direction ofthe heart altogether, following it in rising up to the abode of the world of holiness (2alamal-qudus), freed from the abode of uncleanliness, diligent in acts of obedience, dwellingin the presence of the highest of degrees until its Lord addresses it, ‘O soul at peace,return to your Lord, well pleased and well-pleasing. Enter among my servants and entermy Garden(85:27–30)’ of the absolute (tajarrud)” (Istilahat al-sufiyya, pp. 77–8).62 Al-Kashani,Ta1wilat, vol. 1, pp. 770, 772.63 Ibid., p. 770.64 According to Ibn Sina, the rational soul is made up of the practical and theoreticalfaculties or intellects. The practical intellect mediates between the vegetal and animalsouls and the theoretical intellect, using the rationality of the latter to control theappetites and passions of the former by fostering ethical behavior. The practicalintellect deals with the particulars of the external material world while the theoreticalintellect has the potential to understand universal concepts received from the ActiveIntelligence (al-2aql al-fa22al), either through a slow process of applied logic or imme-diate intuition (hads), a potential which may or may not be actualized. Al-Kashaniadopted Ibn Sina’s conception of the practical and theoretical intellects (P. Lory, LesCommentaires ésotériques du Coran d1après2Abd ar-Razzaq al-Qashani, Paris: LesDeux Oceans, 1980, p. 76) and viewed the Active Intelligence as the equivalent of theangel Gabriel or the Holy Spirit (ruhal-qudus) (p. 55).65 Al-Kashani,Ta1wilat, vol. 1, p. 773. Elsewhere, al-Kashanistates that the heart (qalb)is what the philosopher (al-hakim) calls the rational soul (al-nafs al-natiqa) (Istilahatal-sufiyya, p. 141).66 Al-Nisaburi,Ghara1ib al-Qur1an wa ragha1ib al-furqan, Cairo: Mustafaal-Babial-Halabi, 1962–70, vol. 16, p. 17.67 Ibid., p. 18.68 Al-Sulami,Haqa1iq al-tafsir, vol. 1, p. 417; Ruzbihan,2Ara1is al-bayan, vol. 1, p. 595;Al-Maybudi,Kashf al-asrar, vol. 16, p. 730.69 Ibid.70 Cf.

Safwan (d. 746)who, like the Mu2tazila, denied the distinct existence of God’s attributes and thereforeresorted to their interpretation (ta2wil).20 Ibn Taymiyya, Al-Tafsir al-kabir, vol. 5, p. 421. Cf. al-Razi, in his Sharhal-asma1:Know that light is the name of that mode of being (kayfiyya) which has darkness as itsopposite, and it is impossible that God (al-haqq) could be that for several reasons. Thefirst is that this mode of being comes and goes but it is inconceivable that God(al-haqq) could be like that. The second reason is that bodies (ajsam) are alike in cor-poreality but different with regards to light and darkness, so that light is a mode ofbeing in need of a body in which to exist, but the Necessary Existent (wajib al-wujud)could never be like that. The third reason is that light is the contrary to darkness, andfar be it from God to have an opposite or an antagonist. The fourth reason is that"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"God said, the similitude of His light, so He attributed light to Himself.

According toJ.

Böwering writes, “Ibn al-2Arabi1s theory transformed the early Sufis1psychological experience of mystical union into an ontological speculation on the unityof being, propelling the idea of tawhidto a dynamic conclusion” (“Ibn al-2Arabi1sConcept of Time,” in God is Beautiful and He Loves Beauty, Bern: Peter Lang, 1994),p. 75. In his “Bewildered Tongue: The Semantics of Mystical Union in Islam,” Sellsremarks that “The move from the dialogicallanguage of union found in Hallaj andBistami to the mystical dialecticof Ibn 2Arabineed not be seen, as it often has beenseen, as a decadent movement from genuine experience to intellectual abstraction...Mystical union transforms philosophical and other objective or scientific discourse,even as the philosophical language offers a new dimension of critical self-awarenessand logical precision to the mystical” (in Mystical Union in Judaism, Christianity, andIslam, eds M. Idel and B. McGinn, New York: Continuum, 1996), p. 116. One of Ibn2Arabi1s critics, Sa2d al-Din Taftazani(d. 1389 or 1390), acknowledged an outward sim-ilarity between the metaphysical views of al-Ghazaliand Ibn 2Arabiand his followers,but insisted that a closer examination of their works demonstrated the orthodoxy ofthe former and errors of the latter. He criticized Ibn 2Arabiand his followers for dis-torting the Suficoncepts of annihilation (fana1) and subsistence (baqa1), mistakenlyNOTES170"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"NOTES171understanding subjective mystical experience as indicative of the objective reality ofthings (Knysh, Ibn2Arabi in the Later Islamic Tradition, pp. 150–3). The differencesbetween the metaphysical theories of al-Ghazaliand Ibn2Arabiis an area which war-rants further investigation, but the fact remains that al-Ghazalipreceded Ibn 2Arabiinmaking ontological statements based on mystical experience and adopting philosophi-cal and theological language and terminology to systematize the view of reality alludedto in earlier Sufistatements and writings.36 Ibn Sina,Fiithbat al-nubuwwat li-Ibn Sina, Beirut: Dar al-Nahar li1l-Nashr, 1968,p. 49.

Cf. al-Razi: The portion of the servantin [God’s name “light”]: Know that the light of the heart is an expression for knowl-edge of God who said, Anyone for whom God does not appoint a light has no light(24:40). The shaykhs have said that light is that which illuminates the hearts of thesincere by its declaration of God’s unity and illuminates the innermost hearts of thelovers by its confirmation. It is said that it is that which beautifies human beings bygiving form (taswir) and the innermost hearts (asrar) by illumination. It is said thatit is that which enlivens the hearts of the Gnostics by the light of its knowledgeand enlivens the souls of the worshippers by the light of its worship (Sharhal-asma1p. 348).44 Ibn Taymiyya is referring to Abu2Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami1sHaqa1iq al-tafsir.45 Ibn Taymiyya1s choice of words here shows that he is following the teachings of Ahmadb. Hanbal with regards to using material that is judged weak in transmission. ElsewhereIbn Taymiyya quotes Ibn Hanbal as saying, “ ‘If a tradition deals with halalandharam(legal matters), we are strict regarding chains of transmission; and if it dealswithtarghibandtarhibwe are lenient.’ Ibn Taymiyya points out that this is one of thereasons why the 2ulamauseal-hadith al-dai2f(weak tradition) for fada1il al-2amal(virtuous deeds). By so doing, they do not intend, however, to make them the basisof legally suggested deeds (istihbab), for istihbabis an Islamic legal matter thatshould be based on an Islamic legal argument (dalil shar2i),” (D.

Böwering,The Mystical Vision of Existence in Classical islam: The Qur1anic Hermeneutics of theSufiSahl at-Tustari, Berlin: Walter De Gruyter, 1980, pp. 153–4.54 On the basis of his reading of al-Tustari1s entire Qur1anic commentary, Böweringsummarizes al-Tustari1s vision of the relationship between God, Muhammad, and manas follows: “God is light that issues forth in its radiance and articulates itself in the pri-mordial light of Muhammad the primal man and archetypal mystic. This divine lightpervades the whole universe of this-worldly and other-worldly realities and representsthe hidden marrow of their existence...The primordial Muhammad represents thecrystal which draws the divine light upon itself, absorbs it in its core (the heart ofMuhammad), projects it unto mankind in the Qur1anic scripture, and enlightens thesoul of mystic man...Man issues as an infinitely small particle of divine light inpre-existential eternity and achieves his final fulfillment as he is engulfed by the divinelight in post-existential eternity” (Mystical Vision, pp. 264–5). The concept of theMuhammadan light (nur Muhammadi) was a controversial one, with some scholars suchas al-Ghazaliand Ibn Taymiyya rejecting the notion of Muhammad1s pre-existence,interpreting instead the primordial creation of Muhammad as referring only to his pre-destination. A less controversial term which later Sufis adopted to describe Muhammad1sprimordial nature was the Muhammadan reality (haqiqa Muhammadiyya), a term oftendiscussed with reference to the Light Verse (U. Rubin, “Nur MuhammadiinTheEncyclopedia of Islam, new ed.).55 Al-Hallaj,Diwan al-Hallaj, Kohn: Al-Kamel Verlag, 1997, pp. 119–22.56 Quoted in al-Sulami,Ziyadathaqa1iq al-tafsir(The Minor Commentary), Beirut: Daral-Mashriq, 1986, p. 105.57 Ibid., p. 106.58 Al-Hallaj quoted in al-Sulami,Haqa1iq al-tafsir, vol. 2, p. 49; L.

The term “spirit” is one which Ibn Sinauses more gen-erally to refer to either the vegetable, animal, or human souls within man, as opposedto the “intellect” (2aql) which is reserved for humans alone.75 Al-Kashani,Ta1wilat, published as Tafsir al-Qur1an al-karimand attributed incorrectlyto Ibn 2Arabi, Beirut: Dar al-Yaqzat al-2Arabiyya, 1968, vol. 2, p. 140.

And if heasks Me [for something], I give it to him. If indeed he seeks My help, I helphim.

My soul regained itshealth and equilibrium and once again I accepted the self-evident data of rea-son and relied on them with safety and certainty. But that was not achievedby constructing a proof or putting together an argument. On the contrary, itwas the effect of a light which God Most High cast into my breast.
