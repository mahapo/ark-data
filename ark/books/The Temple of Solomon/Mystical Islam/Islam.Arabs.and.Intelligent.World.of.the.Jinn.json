After years of painstaking investigation, thisthorough work is based on an extensive and intricate research in Arabic andseveral European languages. I have attempted to present an all-embracingexamination of the jinn’s concept in classical Islam including most types ofsupposed interactions of the jinn with humans, angels, and animals.I was often confronted with, on one hand, Western sources simply dismissing thewhole concept of the jinn as superstitions, primitivism, animism, and the like;and on the other hand, contemporary Arab and Muslim sources, which, in general,expand on the predecessors’ work, but rarely innovate.1 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en1] Iwould read thousands of pages to finally fall upon some original ideas on thetopic. Western scholars in general concentrate on the political and socialmanifestations of Islam, totally neglecting this concept, while Arab and Muslimcontemporary scholars find it enough to reiterate what the Qur’an and prophetictradition Hadith mention, or try to apply a Western methodology that would leadthem to maintain that these “spiritual beings” simply pertain to the domain offantasy.This book deals with the concept of the jinn in classical Islam only,corresponding to Islam’s golden age, which witnessed an extraordinaryflourishing of intellectual and spiritual debates. No other era has known such athriving of the mind, the heart, and the spirit. It is during this timetheologians, Sufis, Qur’an commentators, poets, literary critics, historians,and geographers mused and deliberated on the concept of the jinn among otherthings.But why write a book on the jinn? People in the West currently are moreinterested to learn about jihad, the veil, the status of women in Islam, and thevarious fundamentalist movements. For them Islam is solely all of the above.They assume the jinn is a topic better left to Disney and popular culture, or atbest to anthropologists. Broadly speaking, many would argue this subject matteris very marginal, and would not add anything to the understanding of a religionsuch as Islam, while others assert its significance, but acknowledge at the sametime it is a particularly thorny topic to address. For how would one classifythe jinn mentioned in the Qur’an? Are they psychic powers? Are they spiritualpowers? Are they the product of the imagination? Do they really exist? And ifso, how to prove their existence to the skeptics, how to be in contact withthem, and how to describe them?For all of the above reasons, scholars on both sides prefer not to embark onthis venture. It was clear there was an urgent need for a serious academic workthat goes beyond the Western bias, the Arab/Muslim redundancy, and the folkloricsimplification of the jinn in Disney, while attempting as much as possible todescribe the phenomenon from within the culture.I argue, on the contrary, examining such a concept is essential to understandingIslam inasmuch as it is a concept at the heart of the religion. It is, first, animportant constituent of the hierarchical view of the world Islam espousesbecause jinn are thought to be “intermediary” or “imaginal” beings, above ourterrestrial realm but below the celestial realm, as shall be seen in the firstchapter. In other terms, one has to deeply grasp the concept of the jinn tounderstand Islamic cosmology.Second, although belief in the jinn is not one of the five pillars of Islam, onecan’t be Muslim if he/she doesn’t have faith in their existence because they arementioned in the Qur’an and the prophetic tradition. Indeed, the Qur’anicmessage itself is addressed to both humans and jinn, considered the only twointelligent species on Earth. The prophetic tradition mentions them in severalinstances. Therefore, exploring the concept of the jinn in classical Islam wouldshed light on the complexity of a religion that has long been overshadowed inthe West and misinterpreted. It would unravel the originality of a religioussystem that systematically takes into consideration the impact of theintermediary realm on humans.Third, although there exists a prolific literature on angels in Islam, there isstill very little serious academic work devoted solely to the investigation ofthe jinn’s concept in Islam. Analyzing angels is always easier and thought to bemore rewarding in the sense that these spiritual entities are good, beautiful,universal, and eternally obedient to God. There is no paradox, no contradictionin their nature. Simply put, these “divine messengers” and beings of light arebringers of peace and quietude. Intermediary beings such as the jinn, on theother hand, are more complex, multifarious, intricate, and hesitant betweenobscurity and glow. They are go-between beings. Like humans, they could atanytime shift toward goodness or toward evil.Finally, the West persists in interpreting Islam as a rigorous monotheism thatleaves no room for imagination and creativity. My research shows this is asweeping prejudice because Islam, on the contrary, developed an ingenious andsophisticated concept of the imagination and the imaginal. It also contends theoriginality of Islam lies precisely in being a monotheism that highlights theexistence of intelligent spiritual entities without necessarily demonizing them.As a matter of fact, jinn in Islam are not demons opposed to angels. They are athird category of beings different from both angels and demons. Moreover, theanalysis of these diverse spiritual beings will reveal to us the belief in themnever deterred Muslims from the worship of God’s oneness. Generally speaking, itis difficult for westerners to understand how one can be monotheist and stillbelieve in spiritual beings such as the jinn. Some westerners summarize thisissue as follows: either you are polytheist and you believe in spirits, or youare monotheist and you believe only in God, angels, and the devil. That is whyin the eyes of some orientalists such as Samuel Zwemer (d. 1952) all religionsother than Judaism and Christianity are dismissed as “animist,” includingIslam.2 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en2]THE UNIVERSAL BELIEF IN SPIRITUAL ENTITIESSince time immemorial, humans have maintained across traditions that theinvisible realm occupies in the universe a much larger part than the manifest orvisible domain. Belief in spiritual entities is universal. Humans seem to haveat all times thought there is more than what meets the eye. No civilizationknown to anthropology, regardless of its cultural patterns or historicaldevelopment, is without a corpus of narratives that tell of the human belief andinteraction with spiritual entities. Humans have attempted to tune in to them,knowing spirits actually operate in the same real world in which they live,accepting as true the existence of a world of powers beyond, or alongside, thevisibly perceived world of everyday life.It is to this plethora of the invisible world that William James, Americanphilosopher and psychologist (d. 1910), characterized the life of religion inthe broadest and most general terms possible: “One might say that it consists ofthe belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies inharmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto.”3 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en3] Further,James added this all-encompassing remark: “The whole universe of concreteobjects, as we know them, swims in a wider and higher universe of abstractideas, that lend it its significance.”4 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en4]Humans have constantly maintained that different spirits inhabit differentelements. Thus, it is claimed gnomes, elves, and brownies prefer to dwell in theelement earth, while salamanders and jinn inhabit the element fire. As for theelement air, it is alleged it contains the sylphs and the jinn as well. And,finally, the element of water holds all kinds of undines, such as mermaids,nymphs, and naiads.What follows is not a comprehensive survey of all the traditions believing inthe spirits’ existence. That is not the purpose of this book. Besideshighlighting that most traditions incorporate belief in spiritual entities andthe intermediary realm in their dogmas, the purpose is to emphasize thespecificity of the Islamic spiritual tradition when compared to the othertraditions.Native Americans are among the nations who are the most tuned to the world ofspirits. For them, all creatures have a self, and interact somehow with humans.One of their most persistent beliefs is the soul as a cosmic breath that endowseverything with its energy. A Hopi Indian of high cult rank once pointed out,“The universe is endowed with the same breath; rocks, trees, grass, earth, allanimals, and men.”5 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en5]For Native Americans, all beings are interconnected and interdependent. Withinthis spiritual perspective, one owes respect to all forms of life; one needs tobe in constant dialogue with them as well as with all kinds of spirits, that ofthe wind, the earth, the animals, and act in harmony and cooperation with them.This belief, however, in all kinds of spirits has never put off Native Americansfrom the belief in one God, contrary to what some Western interpretations haveclaimed. Indeed, Native Americans call him the Great Spirit and are aware of hismanifestations in nature around them. “Things are not mysterious themselves, butmanifestations of mysteries, and the Great Spirit, or the Great Mystery,synthesizes them in its transcendent unity.”6 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en6]In accordance with the Japanese Shinto religion, it is claimed that a hugenumber of spirits dwell everywhere in nature. “Central to these experiences isthe concept—and felt presence—of kami: the ‘spirits’ that invest every tree,rock, flower, mountain, river, and other natural objects.”7[Notes.xhtml#rch01en7] Spirits are believed to be of two kinds: one gentle,nigi-mi-tama, and the other violent, ara-mi-tama. “Nine out of ten Japaneseclaim some affiliation with Shinto, but in the West the religion remains theleast studied of the major Asian spiritual traditions.”8 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en8]In general, the Shinto religion emphasizes the bond that ties humans to natureand stresses the sacred character of the latter. Finally, the Shinto revolvesaround the notion of ki, which is thought to be a force that dwells within theindividual as well as in nature.Broadly speaking, Buddhism describes two kinds of spirits—good and evil. Goodspirits are those that work to protect the people and the Buddha’s teachings,while evil spirits are malevolent and try to harm people and the Buddha’steachings. The latter are often referred to as “demons.” In addition to thesespirits, Boddhisatvas are considered souls who could have passed to Nirvana, butout of compassion for other humans, they remain in the world to help them.In Mahayana Buddhism, the dominant form of religion in Tibet, China, Korea,Japan, and Vietnam, the presence of spiritual entities in everyday life remainsstrong. Most village monks offer to help their followers with a wide range ofspecific intercessions such as reciting sutras thought to impart protection fromevil. The most significant words of these sutras are printed on the fans monkshold.In Theravada Buddhism, which is mostly spread in Thailand, Laos, Nepal, and someparts of Sri Lanka, people believe they are surrounded by spirits called Phi whoexist almost everywhere—in trees, hills, water, animals, the earth, and so on.Some are evil, others favorable to humans.In Indian religion, there is an abundance of spirits of all kinds, such asdemons, ogres, evil spirits called Rakshas or Asuras, goblins, and the like.9[Notes.xhtml#rch01en9] The Gandharvas are spirits of the air, mountains, andforests. Some of these spirits are called Yaksas. They bear a resemblance tofairies and are friendly to humans, especially men. In the epic story of theMahabharata, they often enter into contact with humans, either to help them orpunish them when they go beyond the bounds of their natural realms. Kubera,their king, is the guardian of treasures and precious gems. He and his peoplewatch diligently over their domain for fear of any human transgression.10[Notes.xhtml#rch01en10]In Irish and Celtic folklore, Fairies are thought of as spiritual entitiesconcerned with human affairs, and that long to interfere in their lives. Theywere not thought to live in a separate realm, but rather close to humans andintermingling with them. They are like humans, male and female, and have theirown families.11 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en11]Ancient Egypt was one of the richest civilizations of the Near East, if not therichest with regard to the concept of spirits. Ancient Egyptian religion had ahost of all kinds of evil spirits the Egyptians searched to placate, but it alsohad many spiritual powers within the human, among them the ka or life force,which is a double of the person, a kind of guide that accompanies the human,similar to what Socrates says of his own daimon. There is also the ba or vitalenergy that subsists after death. Neither ka nor ba were visible during life orafter death. Egyptians used to represent “the ka as a human with a pair ofupraised arms on his head, while the ba was a human headed bird that could movefreely in and out of the tomb.”12 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en12]Spiritual power in Ancient Egypt seems to be within the human, but it could alsomaterialize and go out of him, in the physical world, similar to the jinnperceived as spirits, powers, or energies within us and outside of us as well,as shall be seen in this book.In the mythologies of Assyria, Sumer, and Babylonia, spirits existed everywhere.They were structured in armies and hierarchies; each spirit had a particularresponsibility. Some were good while others were bad. It is not simple toclearly distinguish the function assigned to each spirit, nor is here the placeto mention the numerous spirits existing in these mythologies. What is ofinterest is the distinction in this mythology of two kinds of genii, like theMuslim jinn. There were the good genii called Shedu or Lamasu and the bad geniicalled Utuku.In Greek mythology and religion, the term daemon was ubiquitous, referring tosupernatural agents or intelligences, lower in rank than a god and holding amiddle place between gods and humans, such as the Corybantes, Curetes, Dactyls,Satyrs, and Sileni. Spirits of forests, rivers, mountains, and cities presidedover public and family life, and were also referred to as daemons that could beeither good or evil. Even good ones were believed to be capable of evil acts ifangered by humans.Ancient Greeks considered daimons as guardian spirits of a sort, giving headshipand protection to the ones they watched over, while bad daimons led peopleastray. In Greek philosophy, Socrates (470–399) means specifically by daimon acompanion to the human. In his Apology, he speaks of his daimon: “My familiarprophetic voice of the spirit in all times past has always come to mefrequently, opposing me even in every small thing, if I was about to dosomething not right.”13 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en13] Socrates often referred to thefact that each person has his/her own guide that is his or her own daimon. Asfor Plato (d. 347 BCE), “The intermediary world must have been of the utmostsignificance. It is the idea or view of the daemonic as an ‘intermediate’ realmbetween the human level and the divine, a realm that because of its intermediateposition unites the cosmos to itself.”14 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en14]In ancient Rome, the term genii means a group of spirits in the classical Romanand Etruscan mythologies. Genii were considered guardian spirits of theindividual beings and of some nature phenomena. There is, for example, a geniusfor crops, trees, water, and mountains as well as for each kind of animal andfor each human male to whom it was assigned at birth. Interesting enough, womenhad a different kind of guardian spirit called Juno. It should be mentioned herethat in pre-Islam and in Islam as well, jinni is a masculine spiritual entitythat has its feminine counterpart called jinniyah.In Persian mythology, there existed two classes of spiritual entities: theDaevas who were demons and fighters against the supreme god, Ahura Mazda, whilethe Peris were good spirits, some say fallen angels who guided the soul to theworld of the deceased. Peris were similar to fairies in Irish and Celticmythologies and to jinn as well, and, like them, could be either compassionateor malign toward humans.In the Arab Muslim tradition, as shall be seen in the following chapters, thejinn are not the souls of the dead, kind of ghosts roaming the earth; they arenot forces of evil battling forces of good. Jinn are intelligent and subtlebeings. Their free will initiates their activities, so each jinni is responsiblebefore God for his or her own deed.Muslims recognize the intervention of the jinn in their lives, and acknowledgethese spirits are not indifferent to humans and that they have a desire toinfluence their destinies. The Qur’an refers to these relations between jinn andhumans, and specifically to the fact some humans have sought the help of thejinn. In Qur’an 6:128–130, the close proximity of the communities of jinn andhumans is mentioned: On the day when He shall muster them all together; “Company of jinn, you have made much of mankind.” Then their friends among mankind will say, “Our Lord, we have profited each of the other, and we have reached the term determined by Thee for us”Like the traditions depicted above, Islam stresses that the invisible realm withits beings is vaster than the manifest realm. One saying of the Prophet mentionsthat “God divided the jinn and the humans into ten parts. One part makes up thehuman race, and the other nine parts is made up of the jinn.”15[Notes.xhtml#rch01en15]The Arabic language itself bears witness to how the invisible realm invadesmajor aspects of life. In Arabic, each time the two letters jim and nun occurtogether, like in jinn, they convey the meaning of invisible, unseen, or hidden.Thus, paradise is jannah because it is hidden from the human sight. Janin is thefetus in the womb because we do not see it. The expression ajannahu al-laylmeans the night covered him or hid him, etc.SPIRITUAL ENTITIES AND THE WESTBroadly speaking, almost all traditions seem to have believed, and still believeone way or another, in the existence of an invisible realm that constantlyinteracts with our own physical or manifest domain. However, a majority ofwesterners reject today these beliefs, and qualify them as “animistic.” AsPatrick Harpur, contemporary writer on the history of imagination in the West,eloquently comments, “The very people who have emptied Nature of soul andreduced it to dead matter obeying mechanical laws, pejoratively call thetraditional world view animism—a term which effectively writes off what itclaims to describe. To ‘animistic’ cultures there is no such thing as animism.There is only Nature presenting itself in all its immediacy as daimon-ridden.”16[Notes.xhtml#rch01en16] Western Judeo-Christianity in general is thought to haveintroduced a vision of the world where “Man is against God, Nature is againstGod, and Man and Nature are against each other. God’s own likeness (Man), God’sown creation (Nature) and God himself,—all three are at war.”17[Notes.xhtml#rch01en17]This perception of the world was initiated in Europe with Descartes, surnamedthe father of modern philosophy, (d. 1650). Descartes divided the world intoreligious and material.18 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en18] Since that time, Westerners ingeneral have the tendency to see things through opposite pairs: logos versusmythos, sensation versus intellect, metaphorical versus literal, inner versusouter, object versus subject, spiritual versus supernatural, nature versusculture, and humans versus the Divine. Nothing seems to mediate between thesepairs. Newton (d. 1727) later depicted the material universe as a mechanism thatfunctions under the laws of nature. He viewed the world through the eyes of“casual determinism,” which stipulates any movement can be calculated exactlygiven the laws of motion. Classical physics asserted that consciousness isseparated from nature and psyche from physics. Locke (d. 1704), the philosopherof the Newtonian system, pictured humans as passive in front of a robotic naturethat should be manipulated as dead matter rather than being respected as alive,sacred, and conscious.Subsequently, French sociologist Auguste Comte (d. 1857) maintained Europeanscience alone was behind the intellectual evolution of humanity. Comte describedthis progress as being from mythology to metaphysics and finally to science.Comte and his contemporaries considered myth as substantiation of a prelogicalmentality, and as representative of the childhood of humanity. They arguednon-European civilizations lived and continue to live in a world of fantasywhile European society alone became enlightened through reason and science.This “scientific” perception of the world was in total opposition to religion,which was consigned to the inner sphere, while science evolved in the rationaland manifest realm. Irrevocably separated from each other, they remained on goodterms as long as they didn’t intervene in each other’s affairs. In contrast tothis dualistic view of the world, science and religion in the Muslim classicalworld worked hand in hand. Most of the scientists at that point in time werethemselves great Sufis. Suffice it to mention here that physician Avicenna (d.1037) made important discoveries in medicine, and wrote beautiful mysticaltreatises as well.One would think today’s relations between science and religion would be changedafter the revolutionary discoveries in quantum physics, which reinterpreted therelations of man to matter. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. “After thebombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Karl Barth, Europe’s most famous Protestanttheologian, was asked to speak with physicians concerning the moral implicationsof atomic weapons. He refused, as did all of his students. When asked why, Barthsaid that scientists had one world, he had another, and they had no commonground to speak about. He believed it was a logical impossibility that they, thescientists, could have anything to say about the morality or the immorality ofthe bomb, even though they had built this device.”19 [Notes.xhtml#rch01en19]Despite this general Western doubt about the existence of an unseen world, oneshould acknowledge there were in the past several exceptions to the rule; inparticular the Romantic Movement, which genuinely opened up to the invisiblerealm. Poets like William Blake (d. 1827), John Keats (d. 1821), SamuelColeridge (d. 1834), and later W. B. Yeats (d. 1919) have described theirwanderings beyond the seen physical world. They maintained they were able toaccess it through the power of imagination, which they cherished and almostvenerated.Hermetic philosophers and alchemists like Paracelsus (d. 1541), Giordano Bruno(d. 1600), Sir Francis Bacon (d. 1626), and the Count of St. Germain (d. 1784)underscored the unity between microcosm and macrocosm, and highlighted in theirwritings the power of the invisible world over human lives.CHAPTER STRUCTUREChapter 1 sets the theoretical grounding for the whole concept of the jinn asintermediary beings, constantly moving from the visible domain to the invisible,and vice-versa. One can say, without exaggeration, that the whole of Islam isbased upon these two facets of visible and invisible: ‘alam al-ghayb waal-shahadah.Moreover, the concept of the jinn is tightly linked to the notion of theintermediary realm or imaginal. There is no understanding of this conceptwithout first unraveling the seminal role of imagination and the imaginal worldin classical Islamic thought.The next chapter analyzes the ways classical Islam establishes correspondencesbetween jinn and humans in the major aspects of life, and then turns to theanalysis of human superiority over jinn.This is followed by the theme of jinn preceding humans on Earth and theelaborate relationships between the two spiritual entities: jinn and angels.Chapter 3 makes obvious how Islam expounds always on the angels’ superiority.In chapter 4, a quick survey of divination in the ancient Near East precedes thenarration of the encounters of the Prophet of Islam with the jinn, as found inIslamic sources. The very important issue that was raised in medieval times—didthe Prophet Muhammad see the jinn or only hear them?—is also raised.Chapter 5 discusses the correlations between magic, medicine, and faith from theperspective of traditional Islam. It delves into the different means invented toward off evil jinn, such as the recitation or the writing of specific Qur’anicverses, the use of the Most Beautiful Names of God (asma’ allah al-husna) andthe Arabic letters. It also addresses the phenomenon of possession and madness,as well as their remedies.The next chapter elaborates on the nature of jinn as tricksters and especiallystresses the jinn’s embodiment of animal forms and their many maneuvers whenluring humans. This is followed by chapter 7 revealing how the jinn take theshapes of humans when they fall in love with a man or a woman from the humanworld and analyzing the love stories found in the original sources.Chapter 8 treats the intriguing question of poetical inspiration and itsrelation and difference from revelation. It analyzes the Qur’an’s attitudetoward poets and includes the many stories told about poets’ encounters withtheir inspirers, the jinn. As in the preceding chapters, it attempts to answerthe question: Are the jinn physical entities, or rather imaginal beings comingfrom within the self?Finally, an appendix presents the many kinds of the jinn. In the realm ofimaginable beings, variety remains of essence.METHODOLOGYThere are five aspects to my methodology for this book.The first aspect examines the concept of the jinn in classical Islam from withina combination of the three major layers of Islam: orthodox or official Islam,folk or popular Islam, and Sufism.(a) Official or orthodox Islam is essentially based on the Qur’an and the Hadith(the prophetic tradition), considered the backbone of its teachings. From themthe shari‘ah, or Islamic Law, is derived. Official Islam tends to be literalist,and generally doesn’t encourage interpretations of the Qur’an, which often putsit in contradiction with the two other layers, popular or folk Islam and Sufism.With regard to the Qur’an, I have essentially adopted the translation of ArthurJohn Arberry (d. 1969). However, as a native speaker of Arabic, and as a scholarof Islam and Arabic, I have made modifications each time I felt Arberry’stranslation did not mirror the Arabic meaning and indicated it with an asterisk.As for the Hadith, I have used different sources (refer to Arabic bibliography).Because the purpose of this research is to interpret the jinn’s phenomenon as itmanifested itself at that point in time, I have used these pertinent sources asthey appeared and widely spread among Muslims, generation after generation.These sources are a phenomenon in itself. Their data are of sensible intuition.That is, they very likely involve mental projections. A historical andtheological critique of this wide variety of sources would need a volume of itsown. Moreover, it would gravely disrupt the reader’s focus on the main topic. Inbrief, I generally relied on the two most well-known works of Hadith, namelySahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari. Occasionally, I turned to the Hadith compiled byMuhammad ibn Yazid ibn Majah (d. 887) entitled Sunan ibn Majah. I also used thecollection of forty Hadiths by one of the most notable compilers, Muhyiddin abuZakariyya Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi (d. 1277).(b) The second layer of Islam is popular or folk Islam. I define it as thecorpus dealing with legends, myths, popular stories, and heroic tales. Iespecially worked, however, with the text of The Arabian Nights that contains animpressive number of stories on the jinn. I have adopted the translation ofHusain Haddawy in its two volumes (see bibliography). However, because Haddawylimits himself to earlier manuscripts of The Nights, and leaves out a number ofstories, I have also used Richard Burton’s translation, which is more complete.Unfortunately, the English is somehow Victorian and archaic. In this samecategory, I have also used the popular tale entitled “Sirat Sayf bin Zi Yazan”translated by Lena Jayyusi. (see bibliography).(c) Regarding the third layer, or Sufism, I define it as mystical Islam. It is apath toward purification and attaining unity with the Divine. Sufism uses ahighly symbolical language that sometimes puts it in conflict with officialIslam.I have incorporated several Sufi texts from different periods to present thereader with a great variety of texts. For example, I have used the work of Nural-din ‘Abd al-Rahman Jami (d. 1492), and ‘Abdul Qader al-Gilani (d. 1166.)However, I have especially focused on the work of Andalusian Sufi, Muhyi-al-dinibn ‘Arabi (d. 1240), and some figures belonging to his school of thought. Thisis because his work, more than any other Sufi’s work, deals extensively with thetopic of the jinn. He remains the most original writer on this issue. Histreatment of this complex topic is unequaled.It should be mentioned these three layers of Islam are far from being entrenchedcategories. They sometimes flow in each other. For example, in which layer ofIslam should one place the Qur’an’s commentaries, tafasir? One finds literalistQur’an commentaries as well as Sufi ones. Henceforth, the tafasir do not reallybelong to orthodox Islam only; it would also be wrong to put them under Sufism.In fact, I have used both kinds of tafasir to offer an all-inclusive view on theconcept of the jinn. In the Sufi tradition, I have referred to Tafsir al-safi ofal-Fayd al-Kashani (d. 1680), Tafsir al-hasan al-basri (b. 642), Tafsiral-qur’an al-karim by ibn ‘Arabi (d. 1240), and the tafsir entitled Lata’ifal-isharat by the Sufi Abd al-Kabir al-Qushairi (d. 1074).Regarding the Orthodox tafasirs, I have essentially used the Qur’aniccommentaries written by Isma‘il ibn Kathir (d. 1373); ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah,renowned scholar of Islamic tradition (d. 1350); Fakhr al-din al-Razi (d. 1209),al-Tafsir al-kabir li al-qur’an, called also Mafatih al-ghayb; Abdullah ibn‘Umar al-Baydawi (d. 1286), Anwar al-tanzil wa asrar al-ta’wil; and Muhammad ibnJarir al-Tabari (d. 923), Tafsir al-qur’an.Another example of the overlap of these three layers is found in the works ofmedieval Muslim historians and geographers I have used amply in this book. Ihave looked at them as texts that are halfway between official Islam and folkIslam. Many Muslim historians were well grounded in the Qur’an and the Hadith.In fact, some historians were Qur’an commentators, like historian Isma‘il ibnKathir who composed his own commentary of the Qur’an. He also wrote his ownversion of the “Stories of the Prophets,” a corpus closer to folk Islam than itis to official Islam. As for classical Muslim geographers, they were very muchtuned to the eerie world of marvels to the point they were considered theprincipal inventors of this literary genre. Their depictions of jinn in far awaycountries are filled with intriguing details. They are constantly looking forthe uncanny and all that lies beyond the conventional. In this sense, their workcould be looked upon as closer to folk Islam than to orthodox Islam.In simultaneously analyzing these three layers of Islam, my intent is: (a) todemonstrate that, despite the differences existing between the three majorlayers, the Islamic belief in the jinn is always represented as embedded in theQur’an and the prophetic tradition; and (b) to illustrate the jinn’s concept inthe three layers is depicted sometimes as an external energy, and sometimes asan internal energy within the self.I believe it is almost impossible to comprehend the phenomenon of the jinn inclassical Islam without concomitantly taking into consideration these threelayers. Otherwise, it would be difficult to obtain a more complete pictureregarding the jinn. I maintain part of the incomprehension characterizing thefield of Islamic studies is the stress on one side of Islam, especially thedogmatic, legal, literal, and official at the expense of the two others, which,obviously, distorts Islam, and presents it as an abrasive monotheism.The second aspect is thematic. In addition to the works mentioned above, eachchapter has its own additional references because each chapter deals with aspecific theme or aspect of the jinn. For example, chapter 6 deals with thetrickster aspect of jinn and their frequent manifestation in animal forms; andtherefore, works consulted and cited in this chapter refer essentially to thisluring aspect of the jinn.The third aspect of my approach is a close reading of the original texts.Throughout this book I have opted to give the original sources the chance tospeak, to show their uniqueness, and open up to their readers. I argue that tofigure out the complexity and subtleness of the jinn’s concept, it is imperativeto carefully listen to the original texts and to meditate while reading them. Iam an advocate of intimate attentiveness to the original texts, which eventuallyallow concealed meanings to surface, and masked connotations to appear in thedaylight. I consider that close reading is a journey one undertakes from thevisible, manifest, and literal reading of the texts to their hidden andinvisible message.The fourth aspect espouses a decoding of the symbols contained in the originaltexts. This is a continuation and a culmination of the close reading techniquementioned above, which takes it up to a higher level. I contend that behindeverything and every word hides a symbol, especially in the domain of religion.The fifth aspect of my approach relates universal patterns to particular ones. Ihave endeavored to seek the universal across traditions while stressing at thesame time the specificity and originality of Islam. This is why I have examinedthe beliefs of the major traditions pertaining to each chapter’s theme. In fact,this book contains a large amount of narratives related to spiritual entitiesfrom all over the world. In this sense, it is truly encyclopedic; all throughthis research, I have intentionally chosen to enrich the study with an abundanceof stories, gathered from multilingual sources and tens of thousands of pages tocreate a rare Golden Bough of the jinn.My analysis is certainly more phenomenological than historical. I have decidedto look at the concept of the jinn with an open mind and with empathy, lettingthe sources unfold their meanings.This book contains many stories and anecdotes translated for the first time fromArabic into English.Finally, I believe the dramatic growth of Islamic and Arab studies in the Westin general, and in the United States in particular, necessitates new approachesto the study of Islam. I hope to have presented a rather unorthodox topic in aunique manner."},{"pageContent":"[../images/halftitle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"1The Poetics of the InvisibleMuslim Imagination and the Jinn Imagination is like the image that a human sees in the mirror. —IBN ‘ARABI (d. 1240)As spiritual entities, the jinn are considered dual dimensional, with theability to live and operate in both manifest and invisible domains. The trafficbetween them is the focus of discussion in Islam, because believing in al-ghayb,the unseen and the unknown, is central and fundamental in Islamic faith. Godhimself is referred to in the Qur’an as the Outward and the Inward.1[Notes.xhtml#rch1en1] This means God unveils himself through infinite externalmanifestations and veils himself in absolute secrecy in his Oneness. “From thatunitary point of view, the Principle of the Source is seen as not the Inward butalso the Outward, not only the One but also the essential reality of the manywhich is but the reflections of the One.”2 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en2]THE NOTION OF MULTIPLE WORLDS IN ISLAMIt is difficult to grasp this constant and complex interchange between themanifest and the invisible without unraveling from the outset the concept ofmultiple worlds that is at the heart of the Muslim vision of existence. Itprofoundly implies there is always more than meets the eye.Muslims begin their prayers each time with the fatiha (the opening chapter ofthe Qur’an), which begins with these words: “Praise belongs to God, the Lord ofthe worlds,” rabb al-‘alamin.3 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en3] Muslims repeat theexpression rabb al-‘alamin (the Lord of the worlds) in the fatiha several timesduring their prayers, which deeply ensconces the idea of numerous realms intheir hearts and minds. Despite the preeminence of our Earth because the humanis God’s vice-regent on it,4 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en4] Islam emphasizes theexistence of yet other domains in general, and of other earths in particular.5[Notes.xhtml#rch1en5] It is this belief in the infinite possibilities of otherdimensions that triggered the great development of sciences during medievaltimes. Nothing in the new religion hinders the exploration of these worldsmentioned in the Holy Book. Muslims believe God created many worlds andsubjected them to humans and jinn to explore them, benefit from them, and cometo a deeper discernment of the Divine and a genuine glorification of hiswonders.6 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en6]Muslim compilers speak of not one earth but of seven earths as being one on topof the other, exactly like the seven heavens. The analogy between seven earthsand seven heavens is worthy of note inasmuch as the number seven is considered“the number of the universe, the macrocosm.”7 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en7] It is also“the first number which contains both the spiritual and temporal”8[Notes.xhtml#rch1en8] and that joins heaven and Earth. However, in Arabic theterm “seven” could also be used emphatically to refer to more than seven, tonumerous things or beings.9 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en9] In the context of earths andheavens, it could therefore allude to a great number of earths and heavens, andnot just to seven.Although details on the seven earths are so scarce in the Qur’an that itmentions it only once,10 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en10] the prophetic tradition providesadditional details. The imam Muhammad al-Bukhari (b. 810), author of one of themost authentic collections of prophetic traditions, statesThe Prophet asked once his Companions, “Do you know what is below the earth?” Wereplied, “God and his Prophet know better.” He said, “There is an earth. Do youknow what is underneath it?” We replied, “God and his Prophet know better.” Hesaid, “Another earth. Do you know what distance separates both of them?” Wereplied, “God and his Prophet know better.” He said, “Seven hundred yearsapart,” and he continued so forth until he counted seven earths. Then he said,“By God, if any of you go downwards, he will reach the seventh earth.” Then herecited from the Qur’an: “He is the First and the Last and the Outward and theInward, and He has knowledge of everything.”11 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en11]The Prophet not only asserts the existence of multiple earths, but he alsounderscores the need to respect and nurture our Earth because it is alive,sacred, and ranked above other earths: “He who takes anything from the earththat doesn’t belong to him or that is not his right will be thrown on the Day ofJudgment downwards to the seventh earth.”12 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en12]Muslim theosophists depicted the marvels of these earths, claiming, “Betweeneach earth and the next there is a distance similar to that between each heavenand the next. On each earth, there are beings created by the Almighty.”13[Notes.xhtml#rch1en13] Each earth is more picturesque than the other. One ofthem, for example, is totally white, embodying transcendence and purity, a gemamong the other earths: “God has a white Earth where the sun’s rotation is of 30days, so that the days there are thirty times longer than the day on our Earth.This white Earth is filled with people who don’t know that God’s orders arebeing disobeyed and they don’t know either that God created Adam and the devil,Iblis.”14 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en14]Another earth is stupendous. It is called “the earth which was created from whatremained of the clay of Adam” as ibn ‘Arabi (d. 1240) illustrates: “This Earthwas created from ‘a remainder that was the equivalent of sesame seed.’”15[Notes.xhtml#rch1en15] Then he adds, “A multitude of things exist there whichare rationally impossible, that is, a multitude of things about which reason hasestablished decisive proof that they are incompatible with real being. And yet!All these things do indeed exist in that Earth.”16 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en16]Therefore, from a remainder the equivalent of a sesame seed, God created thismarvelous Earth. From the extremely small came the infinitely vast, because thisremarkable Earth is itself an illustration of the multiple worlds. “In the wholeof all the universes that make up that Earth, God has especially created oneuniverse in our image (a universe corresponding to each one of us).”17[Notes.xhtml#rch1en17]Interestingly enough, this Earth contains in its vastness many universes insteadof they containing it! One of these universes hosts beings similar to thoseliving in our own Earth. If we visit them, we will encounter our own homologues.However, not everything is truly identical to our Earth because beings there areeternal and in our Earth, every living creature is subject to eventual decay.That is why this white earth “does not allow access to any of our physicalbodies made of perishable human clay; its nature is such that it allows accessonly to bodies of the same quality as that of its own universe or the world ofSpirits.”18 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en18] It is possible for the spiritually gifted tovisit it in spirit, as did ibn ‘Arabi whose depiction surpasses the moststunning stories in Western science fiction, except for ibn ‘Arabi it is notfantasy. It really exists because it pertains to the imaginal realm, which is,for him, as real as our own physical world, albeit in a different manner, asshall be seen. Everything found on that earth, absolutely everything, “is aliveand speaks, has a life analogous to that of every living being endowed withthought and speech.”19 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en19] Ibn ‘Arabi uncovers that thevisitor could speak with these beings if he wishes despite the fact they “speakdifferent languages, but this Earth has the gift, peculiar to it, of conferringon whomsoever enters the ability to understand all the tongues that are spokenthere.”20 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en20]Everything on this astounding earth moves with an extraordinary speed, fasterthan the twinkling of the eye. Moreover, time there is different from ours: “Thetimes of that Earth are qualitatively of different kinds. Every event, everyperson, has his own time there.”21 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en21] More astonishing,“Light which reigns there is not that of the physical sun but nevertheless nightand day alternate, just as with us. However, the darkness of the nights in thisplace is never a veil; it never prevents an object from being seen.”22[Notes.xhtml#rch1en22] The ocean there is similar to ours, but instead of water,it has earth. However, it has the same appearance and behaves like our oceans.In all the earths described above with their numerous universes, our laws ofphysics seem to be shattered and replaced by different laws particular to theimaginal realm.23 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en23]Medieval texts speak in general of an infinite number of beings of all kinds.“On each of these levels, species exist analogous to those in our world, butthey are infinite. Some are peopled by Angels and the human Elect. Others arepeopled by Angels and genii, others by demons.”24 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en24]Within the perspective of multiple realms, Islam expands on the notion of God’spermanent creation of universes in which different beings are brought intoexistence. “He creates what you know not” (Qur’an 8:16*). Through an unremittingprocess of creating and destroying, God discloses himself differently each time.The creation is thus renewed at each instant. The Qur’an mentions that “Each dayHe is upon some task” (Qur’an 55:29). Every moment witnesses the unfolding of anovel universe. In fact, “the universe experiences rebirth eternally, so thefinal world never ends.”25 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en25] Persian poet and Sufi, Nural-din ‘Abd al-Rahman Jami (b. 1414), who was one of the commentators of thework of ibn ‘Arabi and a follower of his school of thought, praised God’scontinuous Creation of worlds in his verse: At every moment brings a world tonaught/And fashions such another in its place.26 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en26]Ibn ‘Arabi in turn commented on the endless creation of the universes, “As thereis no end to the Ipseity of God or to His qualifications, consequently theUniverses have no end or number, because the Universes are the places ofmanifestation for the Names and Qualities. As that which manifests is endless,so the places of manifestation must be endless.”27 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en27]Islam is far from being the only religion that stipulates the never-endingcreation and destruction of universes. Hinduism, like Islam, emphasizes in itsphilosophy of Vedanta the idea of multiple worlds constantly being born, thenannihilated. This goes on forever, cycle after cycle. The many universes abideby the same rhythm, creation and dissolution. “Beyond the farthest vision,crowding outer space, the universes come and go, an innumerable host. Likedelicate boats they float on the fathomless, pure waters that form the body ofVishnu.”28 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en28] These universes could be pictured as existingin a state of manifestation, then in an invisible state; expanding outwardly,then withdrawing inwardly.Buddhism adopts the Hindu vision of multiple universes appearing anddisappearing in the flux of cyclic time. Buddhism, however, conceives them ascorresponding to different mental states, and compares cyclic time to a wheel oftwelve spokes. In ancient Greek philosophy, the notion of multiple worlds wasalso prevalent. Democritus (b. about 460 BCE) held the view “there are infiniteworlds both like and unlike this world of ours. For the atoms being infinite innumber, as was already proved, are borne on far out into space.”29[Notes.xhtml#rch1en29] And Greek Anaximander (b. 610 BCE) “proposed a model ofthe cosmos cycling over time, with the old universe destroyed and a new universeproduced at the end of each cycle and the start of the next.”30[Notes.xhtml#rch1en30]THE IMAGINAL AND THE IMAGINATIONTo distinctly understand the jinn in the Islamic imagination, we should firstexplore what is commonly called “the hierarchical view of the cosmos,” to whichIslamic imagination strongly adheres, as well as the imagination of alltraditional societies. This perspective is seminal inasmuch as it unveils to usthat visible matter alone does not define the cosmos.The term hierarchy here has no pejorative meaning. If we go back to itsetymology, we will find it does not necessarily entail an authoritarian andoppressive structured world where the patriarchal god is ruling over hiscreatures inasmuch as it indicates everything has its origin arche in the sacredhier. On the other hand, we discover the cosmos is not layered in static levels,but rather one can speak of dynamic “realms” or “domains.”31[Notes.xhtml#rch1en31]In this view of the world, we encounter three basic realms: the terrestrial ormaterial, the imaginal or the intermediate, and the celestial realm. Theycorrespond respectively to the world of clay out of which the human body iscreated and where we live, the world of fire where jinn are located, and theworld of light where angels dwell. Above the celestial reigns the Infinite orthe Divine. These realms are never considered in isolation from each other butrather as a whole. Moreover, the higher realm always impinges upon the onedirectly below it.The imaginal realm is essential for our understanding of the jinn’s conceptbecause it is believed this is their habitat. It is also a seminal realm in anycosmology. “Without this [imaginal] world which stands between the purelyintelligible and the physical world and which possesses its own nonmaterialforms, there is no possibility of a total and complete cosmology nor of theexplanations of certain traditional teachings concerning eschatology.”32[Notes.xhtml#rch1en32]Henry Corbin, French philosopher (d. 1978), used the term “imaginal”33[Notes.xhtml#rch1en33] after rejecting the term “imaginary” because it meansunreal, fantastic, or utopian in the West, yet for Islam, it is a world thatreally exists, “a world as ontologically real as the world of the senses and theworld of the intellect, a world that requires a faculty of perception belongingto it, a faculty that is a cognitive function, a noetic value, as fully real asthe faculties of sensory perception or intellectual intuition. This faculty isthe imaginative power, the one we must avoid confusing with the imagination thatmodern man identifies with ‘fantasy’.”34 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en34]Hence, the “imaginative” faculty of the mind in its highest aspect, the power offraming new and striking intellectual conceptions, is essentially needed topenetrate the realm of the imaginal: the habitat of the jinn. We could speak ofspace and time there, but it is a different time and space. Forms move in theimaginal realm and interact, albeit in a dissimilar manner because they belongto what could be called “an immaterial materiality.”35 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en35] Wecan’t also apply to it the laws of our physical terrestrial domain. It is, asCorbin mentions, “a supra-sensory world, insofar as it is not perceptible exceptby the imaginative perception, and insofar as the events that occur in it cannotbe experienced except by the imaginative or imaginant consciousness.”36[Notes.xhtml#rch1en36]The celestial domain above it affects the imaginal or the “intermediary” realmand, in turn, it affects the material realm below it where we live, to the pointone can say we swim in an imaginal liquid; but few of us are aware of it. Thisdomain is also called the “animic” or the “psychic,” the habitat of Jungarchetypes. We witness the presence of this psychic domain in our dreams whenthe subtle in us is removed from the coarse. We see forms we assume are physicalbut are not. We talk to them, and they talk back to us. Dreams might be one ofthe best means to comprehend imagination, because in dreams, we live a realitythat sounds similar to our waking reality but it is not of the same order ofcorporeality. That is why what we experience in the dreams cannot be interpretedliterally. It is a world filled with symbols that need to be decoded.37[Notes.xhtml#rch1en37]However, the imaginal realm for Muslims is not limited to the Jungianarchetypes. It is much vaster than the conception of Jung in the sense that itis not only a psychic domain, but also a spiritual one rooted in the tawhid(Transcendental Unity of God), and ingrained in its hierarchical perspective ofthe cosmos. Consequently, we necessarily need to view the phenomenon of the jinnand other subtle beings in the context of the Islamic structure of the cosmos,which means they are subtle with regard to corporeal bodies on our Earth, but onthe other hand they are opaque with regard to the beings in the celestial realmabove them, such as angels.How could one visit this imaginal realm and meet subtle beings such as the jinn?Corbin refers to Muslim illuminationist philosopher Shihab al-din al-Suhrawardi(d. 1191) who provides us with powerful keys. “As is suggested at the end ofSuhrawardi’s tale, by the symbol of the drop of balm exposed in the hollow ofthe hand to the sun, it is a matter of entering, passing into the interior and,in passing into the interior, of finding oneself, paradoxically, outside, or, inthe language of our authors, ‘on the convex surface’ of the ninth sphere—inother words ‘beyond the mountain of Qaf.’ The relationship involved isessentially that of the external, the visible, the exoteric (in Arabical-zahir), and the internal, the invisible, the esoteric (in Arabic batin), orthe natural world and the spiritual world.”38 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en38]Going through the interior to find oneself outside is a way of alluding to thereality of the imaginal, and subsequently the reality of the places described byal-Suhrawardi and others. These places, such as the habitat of the jinn, are notplaces in the physical sense of the term. They are places in the imaginal realm.The mountain Qaf is of the highest psychic and spiritual height. Oneaccomplishes a long journey to reach it, as al-Suhrawardi tells us. However, onereturns always to the point of departure, “like the point of compass returningto the same place.”39 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en39] Within this journey, the spirit ofthe traveler is transformed by what he experienced. One of the most astoundingthings the traveler discovers is spiritual bodies are not located in a placelike material bodies are on our Earth. “It is their world that is in them.”40[Notes.xhtml#rch1en40] The words “inside” and “in” should not fool us intobelieving the imaginal realm where the traveler stayed for a while is only“inside” us. As I have pointed out before, the imaginal realm is part of thehierarchical view of the cosmos for Muslims. It is not inside us only; it isoutside us as well, as shall be seen.Ibn ‘Arabi compares the imaginal realm, the dwelling place of the jinn and thelocus of the mountain Qaf, of the emerald cities, of Jabalqa and Jabarsa to abarzakh (isthmus). “Know that barzakh (isthmus), is something that separates twothings. It is never an extreme separation; it is like the line that separatesbetween the sun and its shadow, and like God’s Saying: He let forth the two seasthat meet together, between them a barzakh they do not overpass” (Qur’an55:19).41 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en41]Sensory perception might fail to separate them, and reason stipulates there is abarzakh that let them apart.42 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en42] Then he adds, “Imaginationis neither existent nor abolished, neither known nor unknown, neither negatednor affirmed. It is like the image that a human sees in the mirror. He knows forsure that he perceives his image in some way, and he knows for sure that hedoesn’t perceive his image in some way, as he sees it so precise. If the mirroris small he knows that his image is bigger than that in the mirror; and if themirror is big, he sees his image bigger than it is and he knows for sure thathis image is smaller than that in the mirror. In both cases he can’t deny thathe didn’t see his image. He also knows that it is different from what the mirrorshows.”43 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en43]Not everyone is capable of undertaking this journey, and not everyone candistinguish between a sensory being and an imaginal one, as ibn ‘Arabi warns us,especially that we see both with the same organ of sight, and most people feelthe “reality” of things only through their senses. He claims, though, hepersonally has come to differentiate between an imaginal being and a sensorybeing. He provides us with some hints on how to recognize an imaginal being froma corporeal one. He explains, for example, if we see beings as static only, weare seeing with the eye of sight, which usually identifies beings from theexterior and doesn’t look to what is below them or behind them, like their aura,or their essence. If, on the contrary, we “see” these beings behind theirappearance, and if we can capture some of their other aspects, we are witnessingthings and beings with the eye of the imagination.We will find out in the following chapters jinn are essentiallyshape-shifters.44 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en44] Ibn ‘Arabi invites us to be cautiouswith them and not believe we have seen them because they play tricks on us, andthey have many strategies to escape us although we think we are still seeingthem.45 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en45] Finally, he cites a very intriguing Qur’anicexample of what imagination really means. “And abounding fruit, not picked norforbidden” (Qur’an 56:32*). He elaborates on this verse, “You look at the fruitand see it not picked and you look at your hand and you see that it is in yourhand and you are eating it; and you realize without any doubt that the fruit youare eating is on the tree and hasn’t been picked up.”46 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en46]From all of the above, imagination is viewed as a synthesis, a realization of anambiguous power or a faculty of the mind, a medium that reverses the situationwe have on Earth because it “brings about the embodiment of immaterial things,even though they do not gain all the attributes of corporeality, remainingboth/and.”47 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en47]In the imaginal world, bodies become subtle shapes, and spirits like jinn donbodies and transform into visible beings. Imagination is like alchemy, a forceof change; it is not fantasy. It is mistakenly confused with illusion, definedas a misleading image presented to the mind. Attributing the definition offantasy or the illusion to imagination or the imaginal is therefore manifestlyspurious. We need to stress repeatedly this feature of imagination to grasp thejinn as intelligent beings to whom the Qur’anic message is addressed along withhumans. Because of all the qualities mentioned above, imagination is seen by ibn‘Arabi as the most perfect of all human faculties. “There is no intermediary ormeasure between imagination and meaning, just as there is no intermediary ormeasure between it and the corporeal object. Hence, imagination is thecenterpiece of the collar; meanings go down to it, and the corporeal object israised up to it, for it comes across the two planes through its quintessence.”48[Notes.xhtml#rch1en48]THE JINN AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MACROCOSM AND MICROCOSMTo grasp how the jinn could impinge upon our physical plane, as classical Islamclaims, it is essential to go back to the Islamic cosmological view at thatpoint in time. The texts of Muslim medieval scholars evoke a constantinteraction and an incessant communication between the macrocosm (cosmos) andthe microcosm (the human being). They maintain there are eternal laws ofcorrespondences and analogies that govern these relations. By correspondencesand analogies, they mean the same hierarchical structure is valid for both thecosmos and the human. Indeed, both possess a similar tripartite division thatrejects the Cartesian dualistic perspective of soul versus body.49[Notes.xhtml#rch1en49] “The distinction made between spirit, soul, and body hasbeen applied to the macrocosm as well as to the microcosm. This is hardlysurprising if we consider that the constitution of the one is by definitionanalogous to the constitution of the other, meaning that we are bound to comeacross elements in either macrocosm or microcosm which correspond exactly to theelements in the other.”50 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en50]Moreover, to each of the three realms in the cosmos, there is an equivalentorgan of knowledge in the human. Thus, sense corresponds to the terrestrial,imagination to the imaginal realm, as we have seen, and intellect to thecelestial realm.What is the relevance of these correspondences to the jinn’s concept? Theyindicate the jinn, who are believed in Islam to be part of the Creation, anddwellers of the imaginal, interrelate with us. Like everything in the macrocosm,they infiltrate our world. On the other hand, we too are not isolated beings; weinteract with all elements of the cosmos, including the jinn. Together, wenurture the round of energy that is life, and are nurtured by it in return.The new physics established that the human and the cosmos are significantlyinterconnected in such a way that the consciousness of the human seems to affectthe thing he/she is observing in the cosmos. In such a perspective, obviously,the cosmos is not seen as dead matter that the human controls, as Cartesianswilled it. It is rather perceived as a living being that is aware and has itsown consciousness. The new physics unraveled a web of interconnections andinterdependencies in which humans and everything in the three planes of thecosmos exchange powers. “Their argument ([Albert] Einstein and [Niels] Bohr) hadto do with the nature of observation. It seems a quantum mechanical system suchas an atom or a subatomic system undergoes a rapid and unpredictable changewhenever it is observed. This rapid change cannot be encompassed within theequations that describe quantum systems. It lies embarrassingly outside of thedomain of mathematical representation. Somehow the very act of observingsomething causes an irreversible and uncontrollable change in the system, andthis change effects and, for that matter, affects the relationship that existsbetween the observer and the observed.”51 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en51]The new physics disclosed a new vision of the universe where matter is theexception and the major component is energy, which obviously changes theconventional perception of microcosm (reason) controlling matter (macrocosm).The result is an open field of energy overflowing with infinite potentialitiesin which we and all the beings of the three realms participate, whether we areaware of it or not.CONCLUSIONTwo points merit consideration toward the end of this chapter:1. The numerous correlations I have elucidated between the microcosm and themacrocosm entail that the cosmos and the human are inseparable, and that theoutside world is also the inside world. With regard to the subject matter ofthis book, this stipulation implies the jinn belong to the conscience of thenatural world as well as to the human conscience. Sufi literature, more thanorthodox Islam or popular Islam, eloquently exemplifies this inseparabilitybetween the human conscience and the conscience of the hierarchical cosmos withall it contains: “Know that the soul, the devil, the angel are not realitiesoutside of you: you are they.”52 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en52]2. Some western scholars attempt today to reach the spiritual phenomena beyondthe paradigm of dualism. James Hillman, for example, a contemporary post-Jungianthinker, considers that the imaginal and the multiple could thrive in apolytheistic perspective of the world. Hillman, who is known for his originaland creative contribution to post-Jungian psychology, maintains in this context,“For the ‘return to Greece’ offers a way of coping when our centers cannot holdand things fall apart. The polytheistic alternative does not set up conflictingopposites between beast and Bethlehem, between chaos and unity; it permits thecoexistence of all the psychic fragments and gives them patterns in theimagination of Greek mythology.”53 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en53]In embracing the belief in the intermediate world and its inhabitants, Islamseems to maintain there is no need to return to polytheism or Greek mythology ifwe wanted the imaginal to thrive. Islam advocates a path called “knowledge bypresence” in which knowledge coincides with life itself. One is invited toutterly live one’s knowledge. This notion, however, requires that one liftshim/herself to a different mode of apprehension, which involves passing beyondthe discursive pattern of thinking.The expression al-‘ilm al-huduri (knowledge by presence or presentialknowledge), was coined by al-Suhrawardi, who founded the school of Ishraq(Illumination), which states intuitive knowledge apprehends reality better thandiscursive philosophy. The expression “presential knowledge” is in contrast toal-‘ilm al-husuli (conceptual knowledge). As contemporary Muslim scholar SeyyedHossein Nasr expounds, “Man can know through intuition and revelation notbecause he is a thinking being who imposes the categories of his thought uponwhat he perceives but because knowledge is being. The nature of reality is noneother than consciousness which, needless to say, cannot be limited to only itsindividual human mode.”54 [Notes.xhtml#rch1en54]Presential knowledge involves unity between knowledge, subject, and object, thethree referring to the same reality. Knower relates to known as the createdrelates to the creator. This resembles the relation established between subjectand object in the Quantum physics’ perspective, with the exception that the“sacred” dimension or/and the transcendental is not always present in the textsof quantum theorists.It is possible to understand the multiple worlds and access them if one’s lifeis in agreement and harmony with the existence of these worlds. According toCorbin, “What distinguishes the traditional cosmology of the theosophers inIslam, for example, is that its structure—where the worlds and interworldsbeyond the mountain of Qaf, that is, beyond the physical universes, are arrangedin levels—is intelligible only for an existence in which the act of being is inaccordance with its presence in those worlds, for reciprocally, it is inaccordance with this act of being that these worlds are present in it.”55[Notes.xhtml#rch1en55]Through presential knowledge, one could undertake the journey to the imaginalrealm of the jinn without recourse to a polytheist view of things as Hillmansuggests. It should be noted here that when Muslim theosophists say knowledgecoincides with life, they don’t mean one is invited to a literal interpretationof this hierarchical universe with its beings. On the contrary, when onesucceeds to live the inseparability of natural conscience and human conscience,one experiences the most stunning openness of mind, heart, and spirit, whichallows him/her to comprehend these most complex and intriguing correspondencesbetween humans and jinn as classical Islam expounded them, and which I shallexplore in the following chapter."},{"pageContent":"2Correspondences Between Jinn and Humans We turned to thee [Muhammad] a company of jinn giving ear to the Qur’an; and when they were in its presence they said, “Be silent!” Then, when it was finished, they turned back to their people, warning. They said, “Our people, we have heard a Book that was sent after Moses, confirming what was before it, guiding to the Truth and to a StraightPath.” —QUR’AN 46:29–31The hierarchical Islamic view of the cosmos entails the imaginal realm justabove our terrestrial domain impinges unswervingly on us and interferes in ourlives in a subtle and hidden manner. Because of the staunch belief in thisdirect influence on humans, Muslim scholars, poets, and writers found themselvescompelled to thoroughly research the link between humans and jinn who originatefrom the imaginal domain. They mostly relied on the fascinating and intriguingcorpus formed by the Qur’an and the Hadith, where both intelligent species aresometimes coupled in this life and in the hereafter, and sometimes opposed.Chapter 55 of the Qur’an, entitled al-Rahman (the All Merciful), embodies atbest the correspondence between humans and jinn. Throughout this chapter,written in the dual form to address its message to both jinn and humans, thefollowing sentence is repeated ad infinitum, like a forewarning to jinn andhumans: “O which of your Lord’s bounties will you [humans] and you [jinn] deny?”Jinn are addressed in the Qur’an as nations endowed with rational faculties.1[Notes.xhtml#rch2en1] Jinn and humans have mental faculties that allow them toaccess knowledge, perceive the truth, and distinguish them from all other livingbeings in the universe. These two intelligent species are described asdiscerning the Word of God through reasoning, while the rest of Creation graspsit instinctively.SHARED FEATURES BETWEEN JINN AND HUMANSBoth Are ResponsibleJinn share with humans an essential taklif (religious responsibility). Thisrefers to their knowledge of the Revealed Law. It is believed both species willbe accounted for their deeds on the Day of Judgment because they both havereceived the Revealed Law, and it is implicit they know it. It is maintained Godwill set up the scales to weigh their good and evil actions. Islam deems bothfully capable of making choices that will determine their abode in the afterlifein paradise or hell. If the jinn misuse their rational faculties as humans may,God will equally condemn them on the Day of Judgment. Both are responsiblebeings in the sense they shahadah (bear witness).2 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en2] TheProphet’s companion, Abu Sa‘id al-Khidri, once advised a shepherd to raise hisvoice when he performs the call to prayer in the desert, for “whoever of thejinn and men as well as other living things, hears it, even from afar, shallbear witness to it on the Day of Judgment.”3 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en3]Prophets and Messengers of God Sent to Humans and JinnThe Qur’an and the Hadith argue if the jinn are considered responsible for theirdeeds, it is because many prophets and messengers were sent to deliver theDivine message to them. The Qur’an, in many instances, reminds both humans andjinn of this prophetic history: “Company of jinn and mankind, did not Messengerscome to you from among you, relating to you My signs and warning you of theencounter of this your day? They shall say, ‘We bear witness against ourselves’”(Qur’an 6:130).But were some of these messengers from the side of the jinn, or were all themessengers from the human side alone? What does the Qur’anic expression “fromamong you” mean? Muslim theologians debated at length whether these versesindicate the messengers of God must have come from among jinn as well as fromhumans. The majority of Muslim theologians, however, concurred God did not sendjinn messengers to the jinn; otherwise, they would have been mentioned in theHoly Book. Prophets were solely sent from humans.Another question surfaced: If the messengers of God were indeed from the humanside alone, how did the jinn gain knowledge of these messages? Muslimtheologians argued the jinn seem to have their own communication channels thatallow them to receive the Word of God. In one instance, they listened to arecitation of the Qur’an, then went to inform their fellow jinn about themessage of God: “We turned to thee a company of jinn giving ear to the Qur’an;and when they were in its presence they said, ‘Be silent!’ Then, when it wasfinished, they turned back to their people, warning. They said, ‘Our people, wehave heard a Book that was sent after Moses, confirming what was before it,guiding to the Truth and to a Straight Path’” (Qur’an 46:29–31).There are two possible answers to this question. Medievalist compiler andgeographer Kamal al-din al-Damiri (d. 1405) claimed the jinn of Nusaybin [now inTurkey] who listened to the Prophet were considered to be messengers becausethey returned to their people to proclaim to them the coming of the Prophet(Muhammad).4 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en4] Another answer was proposed by Qur’anicscholar Fakhr al-din al-Razi (d. 1210), author of one of the most authoritativecommentaries on the Qur’an in the history of Islam, who suggested the encounterof the Prophet Muhammad with the jinn illustrated he was sent to the jinn aswell as to humankind. Therefore, this encounter with spiritual entitieschallenged the pagans of Mecca by notifying them that even the jinn acceptedIslam and believed in Muhammad when they heard the Qur’an. Al-Razi added thatjinn, like all rational beings, are free to believe or disbelieve in the Word ofGod because they are responsible mukallafun as humans are, and they call theirfellows to faith. Finally, he concluded the jinn are among us; they listen towhat we say and understand it.5 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en5]The Qur’an speaks of jinn as having free will like humans. Both species are atliberty to group, to trust or to distrust the Word of God, and to religiouslydiffer. The Islamic notion of responsibility is inseparably related to thenotion of free will as in Qur’an 17:84*: “Every one [of jinn and mankind] worksaccording to his manner,” and in Qur’an 74:38*: “Every soul will be (held) inpledge for its deeds.”Jinn and Humans Are Formed of NationsThe Qur’an addresses the jinn as umam (nations). This Arabic word refers tolarge groups of people, or communities, which can be made up of either humans orjinn: “Such men are they against whom has been realized the Word concerningnations that passed away before them, men and jinn alike; they were losers”(Qur’an 46:18).The nations of jinn are formed of tribes, similar to Arab society in pre-Islam.Many of the tribes of jinn are mentioned in the pre-Islamic and Islamicnarratives, such as the tribes of Dahrash, Banu Ghazwan and the tribe of ‘Asr.6[Notes.xhtml#rch2en6] Like humans, the jinn are thought to be two groups:sedentary people and those who move around called “the nomads of the jinn.”Among those are some who roam by day, and some who roam by night.7[Notes.xhtml#rch2en7] Although Muslim scholars describe in detail the socialorganization of the jinn, there is no agreement among them regarding the numberof their tribes. Historian al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali al-Mas‘udi (d. 956), for example,mentions the jinn are distributed among twenty-one tribes.8[Notes.xhtml#rch2en8] Ibn ‘Arabi (d. 1240) claims the jinn are spread amongtwelve tribes9 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en9] that have their own monarchs and chiefs.Many other scholars acknowledge the number of these tribes is unknown.10[Notes.xhtml#rch2en10]Popular Islam in The Nights echoes in turn the semblance of the two societies ofjinn and humans in many stories. In the story of “Qamar al-Zaman,” for example,we are told the jinniyah Maymunah is the daughter of king Dimirat, a renownedmonarch of the jinn. “She has giant jinn at her service, like the marid (giantjinni) Qashqash.” In the story of “Hasan of Basorah,” the sister of Hasandiscloses to him that the jinniyah he loves is the daughter of a sovereign ofthe jinn, of one of the most powerful of their kings.11 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en11]In yet another story of The Nights entitled “Sayf al-Muluk and Badi‘atal-Jamal,” it is said Badi‘at al-Jamal is also the daughter of a king of thejinn named “Shayhal ibn Sharukh, a king of the Kings of the true-believingjinn.”12 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en12] However, the jinn are not the only spiritualbeings whose organization is similar to that of humans, and who have a governingsystem. Fairies in Celtic and Irish mythology are portrayed as having a king anda queen, and a strong social order as well. It is believed “the small TroopingFairies and the Little People of Cornwall have a king and a queen and regulargovernment, but are generally rather homelier in their habits.”13[Notes.xhtml#rch2en13]Islam, however, not only highlights the similarity of the societies of humansand jinn, but also maintains all living beings follow a more or less similarpattern of gathering into neighborhoods, kingships, and the like. The Qur’anoften comes to this idea as in Qur’an 6:38: “No creature is there crawling onthe earth, no bird flying with its wings, but they are nations like untoyourselves.”Both Have Different Creeds and BeliefsWe are even told in orthodox Islam about the jinn’s religious beliefs and thatthey, like the humans, belong to different sects and different cults. In theQur’anic chapter entitled “al-Jinn,” the jinn themselves admit they followdifferent paths: “And some of us are the righteous, and some of us areotherwise; we are sects differing” (Qur’an 72:11).14 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en14] “Andsome of us have surrendered, and some of us have deviated” (Qur’an 72:14).Other verses shed light on the creeds of the jinn. In the Qur’anic chapterentitled “al-Ahqaf” (the dunes), Muslim jinn explain to their (apparentlyJewish) companions how they converted and what Islam is: “They said, ‘Ourpeople, we have heard a Book that was sent after Moses, confirming what wasbefore it, guiding to the Truth and to a Straight Path’” (Qur’an 46:29).Fourteenth-century jurist Badr al-din al-Shibli (b. 1312) understood theseverses refer to the incident when the jinn came to see the Prophet Muhammad, andindicated these jinn were specifically Jews, because they mention Moses.15[Notes.xhtml#rch2en15] Although the great imam of Basrah, al-Hasan al-Basri (b.642) concluded some of the jinn who listened to the Prophet are Qadariyyah(those who believe they are controllers of their actions and responsible forthem), some are Murji’ah (those who believe the intention comes first, and allmoral assessment is delayed until the Day of Judgment), others are Rafidah(broadly, Shi‘ite Muslims who reject the caliphate of Muhammad’s two successorsAbu Bakr and ‘Umar), and, finally, those who believe the religious and secularauthority over Muslims should remain within the house of the Prophet Muhammad.16[Notes.xhtml#rch2en16]In Islamic tradition, one even finds narratives relating the jinn regularly cameto meet with the Prophet. Henceforth, the Prophet ordered his cousin ‘Ali toteach them. “For among them are believers, heretics, Sabians, Jews, Christians,and Magians.”17 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en17]Jinn and Humans Worship GodThere is a strong belief among Muslims all inanimate things and all animatecreatures in the universe worship God innately, and unremittingly glorify him,as in Qur’an 17:45*: “The seven heavens and the earth and everyone in themglorify Him. There is nothing which does not glorify Him in praise, but you donot understand their glorification.” And as in Qur’an 13:15: “To God bow all whoare in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadowsalso in the mornings and the evenings.” Muslims maintain each heavenly body,mountain, tree, animal, and living being exalts the Divine relentlessly, each inits own language and in its own mode. When the Creation adores intrinsically theDivine, it is believed it is simultaneously engaging in an act of knowledge ofhim. This is how the dialogue between God and his creation flows.18[Notes.xhtml#rch2en18]Because humans and jinn are intelligent species, they could have knowledge ofGod through reason and intuition as well as through worship. Through theiradoration, each has access in a specific and unique manner to his hiddenqualities that become manifest to the faithful among them. As stated in theQur’an, “I only created jinn and men to worship Me” (Qur’an 51:56*).Shared Limitations Before the CreatorIn many chapters, the Qur’an reminds humankind and jinn of their shared physicaland mental limitations with regard to the realm of al ghayb (the unseen) as inQur’an 55:33*: “O people of jinn and men, if you are able to pass through theconfines of heaven and earth, pass through them! You shall not pass throughexcept with an authority.” Or in verse 17:90*, where God sets a challenge toboth intelligent species: “If men and jinn banded together to produce the likeof this Qur’an, they would never produce its like, not though they backed oneanother.”Fakhr al-din al-Razi questioned these shared physical and creative inabilities.He holds that each species has been challenged to accomplish that whichcorresponds best to its nature.19 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en19] He asks “why God inQur’an 55:33 puts [the word] ‘jinn’ before [the word] ‘humans,’ while in Qur’an17:90, He puts ‘humans’ before ‘jinn’?” In response, he purports that passingbeyond the regions of heavens is more appropriate for jinn who could performbetter physical wonders because their bodies are made of fire and air, whichallow them to move about through space more easily than humans. In Qur’an 17:90,producing something similar to the Qur’an is more apt for humans, who are closerto the Word of God, than jinn, as the scriptures depict them.Jinn, Humans, and EvilHumans and jinn resemble each other with regard to evil as well. This isespecially highlighted in the final chapter of the Qur’an (Qur’an 114*): “Say:‘I take refuge with the Lord of Mankind, the King of Mankind, the God ofMankind, from the evil of the slinking whisperer who whispers into the hearts ofmankind—[from] among jinn and [from] among Men.’”It should be noted that Islam distinguishes the following three kinds ofspiritual beings: angels, jinn, and demons. This closing verse has inspiredvarious conjectures as to its meaning. Some speculate it is Satan, the evilwhisperer and tempter, who entices both humans and jinn. Others maintain thereare two demons, one from humans who whispers to them, and one from jinn whowhispers to them. It is never pointed out, however, how one could distinguishbetween the two demons. In any case, these verses explain that evil forces couldrise from either or both of the two rational species. It is possible to comparethe above interpretation with Qur’an 6:112*, where we read, “so We haveappointed to every Prophet an enemy—Satans of men and jinn, revealing cheapspeech to each other.” This elucidation of evil as originating from both jinnand humans seems plausible within the context of orthodox Islamic tradition,which maintains the two communities of jinn and humans are capable of eithergood or evil.Jinn, Humans, and the AfterlifeJinn and humans are closely associated in matters dealing with the afterlife aswell. God will either recompense them or punish them in accordance with theirdeeds. Both will be judged simultaneously. “On that day none shall be questionedabout his sin, neither man nor jinn” (Qur’an 55:39). The same forewarningappears again in Qur’an 7:38: “He will say, ‘Enter among nations that passedaway before you, jinn and mankind, into the Fire.’”There is a prolific imagery of the manner in which God will separate good jinnfrom evil jinn, and good humans from evil humans on the Day of Judgment. Toparaphrase Qur’anic commentator Fayd al-Kashani (d. 1680) in his exegesis, Godwill gather the creatures on one level by calling out to the lowest heaven:“‘Descend with the people who dwell in you,’ and the people of the lowest heavenwill descend with jinn, humans and angels, similar to those who live on earth;then the dwellers of the second heaven will descend in numbers twice as great,and so on, until the dwellers of the seven heavens will go down, and jinn andhumans will be in seven pavilions surrounded by seven rings of angels.”20[Notes.xhtml#rch2en20]The prophetic tradition in turn refers to this association of jinn and humans inthe afterlife. According to Abu Hurairah, one of the Prophet’s companions, anangel will carry Muhammad on the Day of Judgment and God will ask him:“What do you want, O Muhammad?” The Prophet will say: “You promised meintercession—let me intercede for Your creation, and then You will judge amongthem.” At that time, the Prophet will return, and stand with the people. Whilethey are standing, they will hear a strong clamor coming from the heavens, andthe people of the lower heaven will come down, and the earth will be filled withjinn and humans, and the earth will be illuminated with their light as theyapproach it. Then God will place His Throne wherever He chooses on the earth,and He will say: “By My Glory and by My Majesty, no one who commits an injusticewill go unpunished. O communities of jinn and humans, I have heard what you havesaid. I have been listening to you from the time I created you until today,watching your actions and hearing your words. Listen! These are your registereddeeds inscribed upon you. Those who find good in them, let them thank GodAlmighty, and those who find other than that, let them blame only themselves.”21[Notes.xhtml#rch2en21]The Qur’an explicitly states hell will be composed of both humans and jinn.22[Notes.xhtml#rch2en22] The prophetic tradition expands on this issue, clearlydifferentiating between the three kinds of intelligent beings according to theirdwelling in hell or in paradise: “One kind of beings will dwell in Paradise, andthey are the angels; one kind will dwell in Hell, and they are the demons; andanother kind will dwell some in Paradise and some in Hell, and those are thejinn and the humans.”23 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en23]The majority of Muslim scholars believe Muslim jinn would enter paradisetogether with Muslim humans.24 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en24] In his exegesis of theQur’an, ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah, renowned scholar of Islamic tradition (d.1350), claims believers among the jinn will dwell together in paradise withMuslim humans, and heretics among the jinn will be in hell with the humanheretics.25 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en25]Other Muslim scholars, such as blind Arab poet Abu al-‘Ala’ al-Ma‘arri (d.1057), simply preferred to find a different location for the Muslim jinn, notfar from the paradise where Muslim humans dwell. He argued God has palisadeslocated between hell and paradise where the believers among the jinn will dwell.He imagined a visit from a certain narrator to paradise and hell who carries thenews between the two. “The narrator rides on one of the mounts of Paradise, andreaches cities which are similar to the cities of Paradise, from which noshining light is cast; these cities contain narrow straits and dark valleys. Sohe asks one of the angels: ‘What are these, O servant of God?’ And the angelreplies, ‘These are the Paradises of the ‘afarit [a kind of jinn] who believedin Muhammad, the Prophet.’”26 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en26]Finally, al-Ma‘arri’s narrator notices the jinni who is accompanying him in theafterlife is not young as are his fellow human inhabitants of paradise. “Heswiftly enquires about his old face and gray hair while humans in Paradise areenjoying splendid and eternal youth. The jinni replies that, ‘Human beings havebeen honored by this, and we have been deprived of it, because we have beengiven the possibility of transforming ourselves in the first abode [referring totheir lives on Earth], so that one of us, if he wills, could be a multicoloredsnake, and if he wills he could also become a bird such as a pigeon, which iswhy we have been forbidden from changing our shapes in the last abode [the nextworld], and so we have been left in our shapes, fixed and unchanged, while thechildren of Adam have been compensated by being allowed to remain in the best offorms.’”27 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en27]Thus, in the eternal abode, humans transcend their physical and time boundcondition and become more prescient and visionary, while jinn turn into a stateof decrepitude and ugliness. Moreover, humans become free from any dread of eviljinn, now that they have transcended the terrestrial realm.Beyond the different dwellings in paradise, many other traits distinguish thetwo species. For example, Muslim medieval scholarship insisted God would notallow the jinn to see him or come close to him in the afterlife—not even thevery pious among them.28 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en28] Furthermore, numeroustransformations would occur to both jinn and humans. For example, humans will beable to see jinn in paradise, while jinn will not be able to see them. It is asif the two species exchange qualities now that they dwell in the afterlife. Inthe same context, Muslim scholarship claimed heretic humans will undergo ademeaning process and will be transformed into jinn in the afterlife as achastisement for their evil deeds.29 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en29]Jinn, Humans, and the AntichristBecause both humans and jinn partake of evil, the Antichrist, prophesied inIslam to come at the end of time, can be either a jinni or a human, and peoplewill not be able to recognize to which intelligent species he belongs. Historianand Qur’an commentator ibn Kathir (d. 1373), for example, tries to answer thesequestions. However, his interpretation remains ambiguous and indecisive becausehe once mentions the Antichrist will be a jinni: “Muslims will flee to mountal-Dukhan (smoke) in Syria, and the Antichrist al-dajjal will come and besiegethem. The siege will intensify, and they will suffer great hardships. ThenJesus, son of Mary,30 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en30] will descend, and call at dawn: ‘Opeople, what prevented you from coming out to fight this evil liar?’ They willanswer, ‘He is a jinni.’”31 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en31] And another time, hecontradicts himself and claims, “The Antichrist will be a man, created by God tobe a test for people at the end of time.”32 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en32] This lastassertion, though, adds even more mystery to this particular issue, because theterm rijal (men) in the Qur’an, could pertain to both jinn and humans, asexpounded by many lexicographers of Arabic.A MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HIDDEN JINN AND THE MANIFEST HUMANSIn spite of all the correspondences mentioned above between jinn and humans, aforemost distinction between both remains. Although the subtle jinn can seehumans and intervene in their lives, the latter cannot perceive them in themanifest realm, except in rare instances as mentioned in the Qur’an: “Surely, hesees you, he and his tribe, from where you see them not” (Qur’an 7:27).There is a general agreement among Muslim exegetes that this verse refers to thejinn in general, and Satan in particular. Although Islam differentiates betweendemons and jinn as two distinct categories of beings, it puts them together whenit comes to the issue of invisibility. Muslim thinkers from various backgroundsdebated greatly this issue of invisibility. The Asha‘ira school of early Muslimphilosophy and jurisprudence founded by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash‘ari (d. 935), forexample, asserted God’s acts cannot be discerned and are beyond humanunderstanding, and exalted God’s will to the extreme they considered itabsolute. The adepts of this school have said jinn can see humans because Godcreated the right preceptors for them to catch sight of them. Humans, on theother hand, cannot see the jinn because God did not create the same preceptorsfor them.33 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en33] They even added, “Anybody who says that hecan see the jinn, we will reject his claim unless he is a prophet.”34[Notes.xhtml#rch2en34] Although the Mu‘tazilah school of Islamic theology35[Notes.xhtml#rch2en35] founded in Basra, Iraq, by Wasil ibn ‘Ata’ (d. 748)established a doctrine of free will, and introduced rational argumentation inIslamic theology, its position with regard to this issue is not very differentfrom the precedent school. Its adepts stressed, “If human beings do not see thejinn, it is because they have very thin and fine bodies which cannot be seen. IfGod had increased the power of our sight, we would have seen them as evidentlyas we see each other, and if God had made their bodies thicker, we would also beable to see them, even with our actual eyes.”36 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en36]As for the Hanafite school of jurisprudence founded by jurist Abu Hanifah (d.767), it stressed the use of analogy and opinion when dealing with religious orsocial matters. This school is considered the most liberal among the Islamicschools of jurisprudence. One of its thinkers, jurist Badr al-din al-Shibli (d.1312), gives the following analogy regarding the invisible and manifest realms:“We don’t see the wind as long as it is thin and light but when it gets mixedwith dust, we can see it moving.”37 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en37]The Sufi interpretation is exemplary represented by ibn ‘Arabi (d. 1240) whowrote extensively on the “channeling” that could take place between the twointelligent species. Ibn ‘Arabi’s originality is in asserting that one can seewith the heart and the faith, and that seeing is not limited to the eye. Hewrites, “We ‘see’ them (the jinn) with the eye of the heart rather than with thephysical senses, and take it on faith that they are with us.”38[Notes.xhtml#rch2en38]Al-Suhrawardi (d. 1191), claims jinn themselves have tried to inform humans howto see them. In one of his Mystical Treatises, a king of the jinn advises humansto “put a bit of incense on the fire and throw away everything in the house thatis made of iron, is comprised of the seven bodies or makes a noise.”39[Notes.xhtml#rch2en39] Because the jinni is an inhabitant of the invisibleworld, he invites the human to release the environment from all kinds of“weightiness” or substances symbolized by the metal iron, and create instead aspace of emptiness for the purpose of “channeling” with him. And finally, tocelebrate his “visibility” in front of a human, he asks that incense be thrownon the fire.Finally, the folkloric medieval interpretation is epitomized in many stories ofThe Nights. In the story of “The Fisherman and the Jinni,” for example, thejinni makes himself visible to humans by going into a “smoky” phase: “For a longtime, the smoke kept rising from the jar; then it gathered and took shape, andsuddenly it shook and there stood a jinni, with his feet on the ground and hishead in the clouds.”40 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en40] To return back to the jar where hewas before, “the jinni shook himself and turned into smoke, which rose, littleby little, and began to enter the jar.”41 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en41]The appearance of jinn in the world of humans causes changes to occur, andsometimes disturbs the natural order, as in the story of “The Porter and theThree Ladies” in The Nights: “As soon as I kicked the step, there was thunderand lightning, and the earth began to tremble and everything turned dark. Ibecame sober at once and cried out to her, ‘What is happening?’ She replied,‘The jinni is coming. O my Lord, get up and run for your life!’”42[Notes.xhtml#rch2en42]The fact humans are unable to see the jinn sometimes creates problems that couldreach dramatic dimensions and even lead to death as in The Night’s storyentitled “The Merchant and the Jinni.” It tells the story of a merchant who,after eating his food composed of bread and dates, performed his prayers and wasready to continue his journey when the jinni appears to him:The jinni approached until he stood before him and screamed, saying, “Get up, sothat I may kill you with this sword, just as you have killed my son.” When themerchant saw and heard the jinni, he was terrified and awestricken. He asked,“Master, for what crime do you wish to kill me?” The jinni replied, “I wish tokill you because you have killed my son.” The merchant asked, “Who has killedyour son?” The jinni replied, “You have killed my son!” The merchant said, “ByGod, I did not kill your son. When and how could that have been?” The jinnisaid, “Didn’t you sit down, take out some dates from your saddlebag, and eat,throwing the pits right and left?” The merchant replied, “Yes, I did.” The jinnisaid, “You killed my son, for as you were throwing the stones right and left, myson happened to be walking by and was struck and killed by one of them, and Imust kill you.”43 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en43]HUMAN SUPERIORITY OVER THE JINNThe numerous instances of the correspondences between jinn and humans do notimply in any sense that both species could ever be equal. In all Muslim sources,humans are depicted as superior to jinn.ImaginationAlthough it is true humans are physically unable to access the hidden realm ofthe jinn, they nevertheless could make their way into it through theirimagination, which is a faculty that belongs to humans alone. In many passagesof his opus magnum, al-Futuhat al-makkiyyah, ibn ‘Arabi maintains imaginationallows humans to be superior to jinn. He argues the jinn knew of the advent ofIslam because they could move easily and quickly. Their swiftness permitted themto investigate the sources of change taking place with the advent of theRevelation:Note that when they were forbidden from listening [to heaven], and the heavensbecame inaccessible to them because of the shooting stars,44[Notes.xhtml#rch2en44] they said, “This is only occurring because something istaking place.” So Zawba‘ah [one of their known chiefs] gave the order to hisfriends to roam the earth, its East and its West, to find out what this eventwas that impeded them from reaching the heavens. When the friends of Zawba‘aharrived at Tihamah, they passed by Nakhlah, where the Prophet was reciting theQur’an. They listened to it, and said, “This is what prevented us from reachingthe news from heaven.” If they had not recognized the rank of the Qur’an and itsinestimable value, they would not have been able to understand this, and theywould not have hurried back to their own people to warn them.45[Notes.xhtml#rch2en45]Ibn ‘Arabi stresses the jinn were unable to envision the approach of Revelationwithout freedom from time and space. He claims, “Jinn’s use of the imaginationis very limited; they employ it to come to the physical world, and they takeforms, such as manifesting themselves in animal shapes. But this is all thattheir imagination can do for them.”46 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en46]Humans, on the other hand, don’t need to wander throughout the earth to foreseean event, or a great change. Ibn ‘Arabi stresses they are the most developedbeings regarding imagination, which allows them access to both ‘alam al shahadah(the physical world or the manifest world) and ‘alam al ghayb (the hiddenworld). But despite their imagination,47 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en47] a few among themseem capable of perceiving the jinn because these spirits have many ruses,wiles, and subterfuges they use to hide from human sight. Ibn ‘Arabi sketchesout some advice to avoid falling prey to their maneuvers: “Whenever the spirit[the jinni] embodies a material form, he can be imprisoned by human sight, andcannot leave this form in which he appeared, nor is there a place where he canhide as long as a human is persistently focusing on him. However, the spirit isable to escape from human sight by creating a shape in front of him, which hecan use as a shield, and he will move it to a different place from where he isstanding. If the human who is looking at him follows the form created by thespirit, the latter can make his escape.”48 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en48]It is thought some holy and saintly spiritual humans have the ability not onlyto foresee things through their imagination but also to be in two places at thesame time through their extraordinary imagination and their power ofconcentration. They are called the ’abdal or “spirit guardians.” Ibn ‘Arabiclaims, “They are able to leave an image (or actual form) of their bodies in oneplace while they simultaneously travel to another place, thus giving people theimpression that they have never left the original location. These people haveoften been ‘sighted’ in two places at once.”49 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en49]In Sufism, there is a belief that these “spirit guardians” have always lookedafter humans to keep them allied with the flow of energy and wisdom, whichoriginates from within.50 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en50]The stories of Sufis seeing jinn are abundant in Sufi literature and popularmedieval culture as well. Al-Damiri (d. 1405 CE) tells this story on the Sufi,‘Abdul Qader al-Gilani (d. 1166), known for his power over the jinn:A man from Baghdad came one day to the sheikh ‘Abdul Qader al-Gilani andinformed him the jinn abducted his daughter, and asked for his help. So, thesheikh told him to do the following: “Go this night to the ruin of al-Karkh. Sitat the fifth hill and draw a circle on the floor and say while drawing it: ‘Inthe name of God and according to ‘Abdul Qader’s intention.’ When the nightbecomes pitch black, you will see tribes of jinn passing by you in differentshapes. Don’t be afraid! None among them can enter the circle where you sit.When their king comes, he will approach you and enquire about your presenceamong them. You ought to tell him your story.” The man followed exactly theorders of ‘Abdul Qader al-Gilani. As the Sufi sheikh told him, none of the jinnwas able to enter the circle where he was sitting until came the king of thejinn who questioned him, and then brought his daughter back to him. She wasabducted by one jinni from China! He fell in love with her and carried heraway.51 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en51]Humans Alone Are the Inheritors and the Carriers of the Trust, ‘AmanahSince the creation of the first man and prophet, Adam, humans are considered,according to the Qur’an, God’s vice-regents on Earth, hence the closest beingsto him. It is mentioned in a Hadith qudsi, “The earth and the heavens do notcontain Me, but the heart of my believing servant contains Me.” Humans arecreated as a sign of God; they are considered noble and fine because their humanqualities manifest the Divine Names of God. At the start of creation, the angelsunderstood this unfathomable relationship between humanity and Divinity. This isthe reason for the prostration of the angels before Adam, “Since God wasmanifest in him [Adam], their prostration was not, in reality, to Adam, in thesame way today our prostration is not to Mecca or to the Ka‘bah, but rather tothe Lord of the House.”52 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en52]The Jinn as Subservient to HumansIt is generally believed those who are enslaved by humans are the heretic jinnwho refused to submit to the new religion. In Qur’an 27:39 and 34:12, it ismentioned the evil jinn were at the prophet Solomon’s service and performeddifficult deeds for him. In some texts of medieval folk literature, especiallyin The Nights, jinn capture humans and force them to work for them. But even inthese rare instances, humans manage to escape the servitude of the jinn byvirtue of their greater intelligence and cunning.Elements from Which Humans Are Composed Give Them Greater Distinction over theJinnAlthough the jinn generally boast about their superiority because they are madeof smokeless fire, Muslim scholars believe the element of water, which giveslife to everything, and from which humans themselves are created, gives humansactual superiority over the jinn. In this context, ibn ‘Arabi mentions a Hadithin which the angels ask: “O God, did you create something stronger than fire?’And God replied, ‘Yes, water.’ So He made water stronger than fire.”53[Notes.xhtml#rch2en53]Divinity seems to be associated in Islam and in many other traditions withwater. Indeed, the Divine often has been linked to water in many traditions. Inthe Genesis account of creation, “In the beginning . . . the spirit of God washovering over the surface of the waters.” In the Hindu account of creation, thegod Vishnu sleeps on the ocean, like God in the Qur’an who puts his “throne uponthe waters.” The fountain, in Christianity, represents Christ as a source ofimmortality, as the Water of Life. According to classical traditions, water andfire are two elements in conflict. They represent all the opposites in theelemental world. Together, they give heat and humidity necessary to the creationof life. In a sense, the burning water becomes the unity of opposites.Humans as Providers of KnowledgeIn pre-Islam, Arabs worshiped jinn. They believed these spirits had easy accessto a higher form of knowledge. For example, people believed the jinn possessedthe art of working metals. It was a common belief among the pre-Islamic Arabsthat jinn craft powerful swords. In a number of pre-Islamic texts, we finddetailed comparisons between ordinary swords made by humans and legendary swordsmade by jinn. Ordinary swords break easily, whereas the swords of the jinn couldperform astounding feats. It is alleged that ma’thur and ifranji are two swordsmade by these spiritual entities. One of the characteristics of the ifranji isthat it is a male sword, and it strikes with greater power, as they havedescribed.54 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en54]The Arabs were not the only people to hold such viewpoints. Historian EdwynBevan (d. 1943), who mostly dealt with the history of the Hellenistic Empire,argues there is “one kind of instruction which the Apocalyptists believed tohave been given by supernatural beings in the remote past, and this is just thesame kind of knowledge about which the Greeks had a similar belief—the arts ofcivilized life.”55 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en55] The same belief is told about fairies,said to be great musicians and healers.56 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en56]Another conviction widely spread about the jinn is they were capable oftransforming arid lands into fertile ones. Arabs in pre-Islam believed oasesfull of orchards and palm trees are the work of jinn who jealously defend them;if a human broke into their territories, the jinn would either kill or bringmadness upon him. It was also thought the jinn excelled in the science ofmedicine, and were able to teach humans the secrets of healing diseases. Islamshattered these beliefs, and made humans superior in knowledge to spiritualentities. From providers of knowledge, jinn became seekers of knowledge. Fromsuperior to humans in exploring the hidden realm, they became inferior to them.Jinn are pictured as being particularly interested in Islamic tradition and inthe Qur’an, which became their highest source of wisdom and knowledge. Islamicsources reiterate the need for humans to educate these spirits in matters ofreligion. Well-known jurist and historian Jalal al-din al-Suyuti (d. 1505)recounts on one occasion, he attended the circle of grand jurist ibn al-Jawzi(d. 1200) in Naysabur. Suddenly, ibn al-Jawzi contracted an eye infection anddecided to return to his family right away. He had a dream that night, havingmade the intention to leave, in which a man entered the room and said to him, “Osheikh you cannot go back so soon, for a group of believing jinn attend yourcircle, and listen to your lectures, and they have just begun to benefit fromyour teaching. As long as the lessons are not complete, you cannot leave, forGod may open their hearts by means of what you say.”57 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en57]Thus, ibn al-Jawzi remained and continued teaching the jinn.Medieval texts dwell at length on the jinn’s enthusiasm for studying the Qur’an.A certain Abu al-Fadl al-Jawhari narrated,I used to come often visit [‘Ali] al-khala‘i, the judge, surnamed the jurist ofmen and jinn. I woke up one night while the moon was at its brightest to theextent that I thought it was already morning, I found at the door of his mosquea beautiful mare, so I went to it and I found near it a handsome young man whowas reciting the Qur’an, so I sat beside him, and listened to him until he hadread a large part of it. Then he left. I went after him. I saw him ride his marewhich flied with him up in the air. I fainted and woke up to the judge’syelling: “Come up, Abu al-Fadl, come up.” So I went to him, and he explained tome, “This man is one of the jinn believers who come to me once a week. Herecites parts of the Qur’an, and then leaves.”58 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en58]In yet another account, al-Suyuti maintained the jinn would come every Fridaynight to the mosque to listen to the Sufi al-Hasan al-Basri (b. 642) reading thefinal section of the Qur’an, and then they would leave.59 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en59]He also claims the jinn were constantly mingling with Muslim humans without thelatter noticing it. One quiet night, in the mosque of al-Khayf, a bird landedclose to Wahab ibn Munabbih (b. 654), compiler of Islamic tradition, then cameand sat in the circle of the attendees: “Wahab greeted the bird, for he knewthat he was from the jinn, and said, ‘Where is this man from?’ The bird answered‘A man from the jinn, from the Muslim jinn.’ Wahab said, ‘And what do you want?’The jinni replied, ‘Do you forbid us from learning from you? Many of us attendyour circle, and we always return back to our people reciting what we haveheard. We attend your prayers, your jihad, we visit your sick, we walk with themourners in your funerals, and are among you at ‘umrah and at the hajj, and welisten to the Qur’an when you recite it.’”60 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en60]These spirits, in Muslim imagination, seem to be interested not only intheology, but in Arabic language, Arabic grammar, and Arabic poetry as wellbecause they themselves compose poetry. Whatever they study, they seem to excel.The same al-Suyuti mentions the story of a certain Abu al-Hasan ibn al-Kisan,“One night I stayed awake studying grammar, then fell asleep. In my dream I sawa group of jinn studying Islamic law, the Hadith, grammar, and poetry. I askedthem, ‘Are there any scholars among you?’ They answered, ‘Yes!’ I then asked,‘Whom do they prefer among the grammarians?’ They answered, ‘Sibawayh.’ [d.around 793]”61 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en61]The imagined pious jinn appear in the prophetic tradition as well, where it isreported the Prophet Muhammad read once surat al-Rahman (chapter of The MostCompassionate, Qur’an 55) to his companions, then said to them, “I read it toyour brothers the jinn, and they were better listeners than you. Each time Iwould say, ‘So which of your Lord’s blessings do you both deny?’ They wouldrespond, ‘None of Your blessings, O our Lord do we deny.’”62[Notes.xhtml#rch2en62]One can certainly see in all these narratives how Islam “invaded” the world ofjinn and converted them, and how they became its most ardent disciples anddefenders. The first two stories occur in dream, when the unconscious is veryactive, and the descent into the unknown self is bottomless. The third storytakes place at dawn, where obscurity and light, sleep and wakefulness are notyet completely separated. It might well be a blurry vision when the borders oftime are still unmarked. In any case, all three stories are definitely locatedin that sacred hierarchical geography of Islam where jinn and humans interact.Although official Islam emphasizes the jinn’s learning from humans, especiallythe Qur’an and the Hadith and their submission to the new religion, popularimagination, on the contrary, highlights the notion of the jinn coming to rescuehumans. The Nights epitomizes these entrenched popular beliefs. It must benoted, however, these folkloric narratives emphasize the jinn’s help originatesnot in the jinn themselves but in God who bestows his support to whomever hechooses from jinn or humans. The jinn themselves acknowledge this Divine sourcetime and again, and contend they are only tools in the hands of the Divine. Theyintervene in humans’ lives to fulfill their destinies. Popular imagination ofIslam incessantly makes clear there is no magic whatsoever and no contradictionwith the teachings of pure monotheistic Islam.In the story of “‘Ali the Cairene and the haunted house,” for example, the jinniliterally rains gold on ‘Ali who is absorbed in his recitation of the Qur’an.‘Ali is extremely poor and is in dire need of help. As a good Muslim, though, hetotally puts his trust in God. While immersed in the Holy Book, the jinni speaksto him. It is as if the prayer addressed to the Divine is finally answered.A cursory reading of the story would suggest a naive belief in some kind ofpower that comes to rescue ‘Ali from his deadlocked situation, and hints atpolytheistic beliefs that are thought to run deeply in some classes of theIslamic medieval society. However, a profound appraisal of this narrative wouldunravel the complex connections and interdependencies between beliefs, destiny,and the role of the intermediary jinn. ‘Ali knows deep inside that this gift isfor him and, consequently, is not afraid of the jinni’s voice, like the otherswho preceded him. The jinni in turn understands that, finally, ‘Ali is the onehe was looking for, and therefore, rains the gold on him.In two other stories of The Nights, the jinn also interfere in humans’ lives byintroducing two young people and inspiring them to fall in love.63[Notes.xhtml#rch2en63] Despite the fact each of them lives in a far awaycountry, they are brought together by the jinn while they are asleep. In “Qamaral-Zaman,” the young girl, Sitt al-Husun, is a princess whom the jinn carry offfrom China while asleep and put in the arms of a young man named Qamar al-Zamanwho had been refusing to marry any woman. He awakens in the night to findhimself sleeping beside a very beautiful woman. He instantly falls deeply inlove with her. The same jinni brings Sitt al-Husun back to her palace in Chinabefore dawn.64 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en64]The same pattern is reiterated in the story of “Nur al-din ‘Ali and his BrotherShams al-din Muhammad,” where one of the characters, Badr al-din Hasan, isbrought from Cairo to Basrah by a jinni while sleeping and put in the bed of hiscousin.65 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en65] Like the previous story, Badr al-din falls inlove with his beautiful cousin.66 [Notes.xhtml#rch2en66] After meddling in thecharacters’ lives, the jinn vanish without leaving any trace, which illustratestheir presence was simply tactic and not psychological.CONCLUSIONOne wonders why all these detailed descriptions and explanations? I argue Muslimscholars in classical Islam strived to reconcile two seminal aspects of thesecorrespondences. The first one is the human as the vice-regent of God on Earth,while the second is the strong belief in multiple worlds.Muslim scholars aimed at preserving the preeminence of humans over all otherbeings, especially jinn, while keeping open the doors to the wealthy populationof the multiple worlds, especially from the imaginal realm. For them this wasnot an impossible task. On the contrary, they seemed to have believed theoriginality of Islam lies precisely in this difficult reconciliation, which putsupside down the simplistic definitions of monotheism and polytheism."},{"pageContent":"3Beings of Light and of Fire Angels are souls blown into lights, jinn are souls blown into winds, and human beings are souls blown into shapes —IBN ‘ARABI (d. 1240)Islamic teaching, as seen previously, highlights the interaction between humansand jinn, and attempts to interpret every facet that deals with thisrelationship. It expands much less, however, on the situation of angels and jinndespite the intermediary position of the latter, who are supposed to trade bothwith humans in the lower level and with angels in the higher level. The reasonfor this paucity of details seems to lie in the Qur’an, which forbade the jinnfrom ever approaching the heavens. Islam thus closed the higher realm to jinnwho, before its advent, constantly visited angels and engaged in dialogue withthem. With the advent of the new religion jinn do not interact with angels anylonger. This is why Islam talks about the interaction between jinn and angels inthe past; it depicts their historical interaction in the heavens and on Earthand confines itself to comparing their respective compositions and powers.THE JINN’S COMPOSITIONIn many instances, the Qur’an mentions the elements from which the jinn arecomposed: “Surely, We created mankind of a clay of mud molded, and the jinncreated We before of scorching winds” (Qur’an 15:26–27). In addition to thewind, the Qur’an cites the “smokeless fire” mentioned in Qur’an 55:14–15. It ischaracterized by a brilliant flame of very high intensity mixed with smolderingwind and has a special Arabic name, marij, which means “mixed with.”1[Notes.xhtml#rch3en1] It is almost as if the jinn were composed of hell itselfor are a living hell, as many Muslim scholars pictured them. They found themfascinating beings but repugnant at the same time because they evoke hell.2[Notes.xhtml#rch3en2] Muslim medieval scholars asserted the jinn could literallykill because of their dangerous composition. They emphasized heat is anattribute of fire and a vehicle for passions.3 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en3] Theyascribed to the jinn strong feelings and immense emotional powers as well asrationality, as we have seen before.Muslim researchers endeavored to know which of the two elements overcomes theother in their composition. Some believed “fire prevails more than air in theirbodies,”4 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en4] while others thought the jinn could not possiblybe composed of these two elements alone. Ibn ‘Arabi (d. 1240), for example,argued the composition of these spirits includes some moisture as well, because“creatures of fire by themselves could not breathe . . . God Almighty is capableof creating humidity in fire to make life possible in it.”5[Notes.xhtml#rch3en5] The majority concurred, however, that the pure flame inthe jinn is lighter than wind itself, which enables them to cross all barriers,walk on water, and twirl in all environments. Wind and fire are, in any case,looked upon as violent forces.In general, the elements of fire and air of which the jinn are composed appearto be greatly compatible, as Paracelsus the Great (b. 1493), German mystic andalchemist, maintains. “The element of fire is placed in the element of air. Foras the water and the earth are comprised in one globe, so the fire and the airare mingled in one, neither injuring the body of the other. They move freely inthe air, not leaning or propped up on any foundation.”6 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en6]Despite their apparent compatibility, as Paracelsus has asserted, the twoelements that compose the jinn are paradoxically in opposition as well. Althoughair tends toward heaven, fire pulls down toward Earth, thus creating theintermediary state that distinguishes these spirits half way between the upperrealms and the sublunary world.The jinn are subtle and secret beings whose extremely refined elements veil themfrom us, fire being a pure energy, and wind being the vital breath of theuniverse, the vehicle of light par excellence and of the invisible; it is thatwhich we feel around us without being able to touch, almost an intelligent powerthat appears to direct things. In approximately all traditions across the world,wind represents the ineffable; a force we cannot apprehend by the senses alone,but still has an undeniable existence. It is a spiritual power that dwells inthe human and outside of him as well. Fire often has been pictured as a fiercebeast. The Egyptians, for example, said it is a voracious, ravenous animal thatgulps down everything in its way.7 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en7]Across traditions fire is linked to the dragon known to be a fire-breathingbeast. It also was thought every hundred years the phoenix smeared its wingswith myrrh and burst into flames, only to rejuvenate itself from the ashes ofthe fire to live anew. Hence, fire is an ambiguous symbol of birth anddestruction, a manifest element to the eye, while wind remains ineffable,unseen, and subtle. In Hinduism, fire is the power of annihilation exerted bythe Indian god, Shiva. In Pythagorean thought, it is the first element increation. In Zoroastrianism, fire symbolizes the energy of the Creator, which isglowing, unpolluted, and life supporting; Zoroastrians usually pray in front ofsome form of fire or light. As a religion of synthesis, Islam integrated in itsconcept of the jinn the many ancient symbols of air and fire that existed in thetraditions before it.ANGELS, GODS, AND JINN IN THE PRE-ISLAMIC PERIODThe term jinn in Arabic refers to all invisible spiritual entities. As alreadymentioned, each time the two Arabic letters jim and nun occur together, theycarry the meaning of invisible, hidden, and mysterious. Hence, the term jinn inArabic encompasses jinn, demons, and angels, because all three are invisible.This use of the term jinn was prevalent in pre-Islam, and remained in use duringIslam, at least in the beginning.8 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en8]The blurring of definitions between angels and jinn persuaded some historians ofpre-Islam that Arabs were ignorant of the existence of angels; they claimed theyonly had notions of the jinn. Thus, Toufic Fahd, contemporary Frenchanthropologist and historian of religions, makes the point that pre-IslamicArabs were entirely ignorant of the concept of angels. He insists, “Angelologypenetrated Arabia only with the birth of Islam,”9 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en9] whileFrench ethnographer Joseph Chelhod (d. 1994), whose work focuses on thereligions and customs of South Arabia, disagrees with this point of view. Hemaintains that the concept of angels as distinct from jinn already existed inpre-Islamic Arabia: “Although the term ‘angels’ mala‘ikah has probably a foreignorigin (it might be Ethiopian or Aramaic), it must have penetrated into theHijaz [in West Arabia] very early, to the point that at the eve of the Hijrah[the Prophet’s migration to Madinah], it was already part of their religiousvocabulary.”10 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en10]Fahd’s assumption is erroneous because it ignores four things. First, the twoletters jim and nun refer to all kinds of spirits, including jinn and angels. Ifthe Arabs at that point in time used the term “jinn” to refer to both angels andjinn, that simply means they knew of the existence of angels. Second,pre-Islamic Arabia was composed not only of pagan Arabs, but also of Arab Jews,Arab Christians, and Zoroastrians who spoke of the existence of angels in theirbooks. As the study of Arabs before Islam shows, there was a constant and livelyexchange between these religious communities.11 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en11] Arabsknew of the existence of angels from them. Third, the Qur’an, in turn, assertsthat the pre-Islamic Arabs were familiar with the concept of angels, and thatthey knew angels were sent to certain chosen individuals, such as prophets. Someof the pagan chieftains of Mecca mockingly asked the Prophet Muhammad to showthem his “angel” to prove his prophethood to them, whereupon the followingQur’anic verses were revealed: “Perchance thou art leaving part of what isrevealed to thee, and thy breast is straitened by it, because they say, ‘Why hasa treasure not been sent down upon him, or an angel not come with him?’” (Qur’an11:15).Fourth, pagan Arabs spoke about fallen angels, which again testifies to theirknowledge of this concept. They thought, for example, that fallen angels wereamong them, that they interacted with humans, and even had sexual relations withthem. They believed God sends a fallen angel to Earth in the image of a man.12[Notes.xhtml#rch3en12] One of the most well-known examples is that of the Arabtribe of Jurhum. The Arabs of pre-Islam claimed Jurhum, founder of the tribe byhis name, was the result of a union between a fallen angel and a human woman.This legend took on excessive importance for the Arabs at that point in time,because this tribe controlled the ancient sanctuary of Mecca for a considerableperiod of time.13 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en13] Arab historians and commentatorsexalted this story, and claimed that Ismael, the son of Abraham and the fatherof Arabs, married a women from Jurhum.14 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en14]In addition to their knowledge of angels and jinn, the pre-Islamic Arabs reveredmany gods and goddesses, especially the goddess al-Lat. It is said that “Hertemple in Ta’if was as venerated as the Ka‘bah is today.”15[Notes.xhtml#rch3en15] Another goddess, al-‘Uzza, was worshiped at Nakhlah nearMecca and Madinah, especially by the tribe of Quraysh. As for the goddess Manat,she had a shrine between Mecca and Madinah and was primarily worshiped by theArabs of Madinah. The pagan Arabs flocked in pilgrimage to the shrines of thesethree goddesses and performed religious ceremonies there.16[Notes.xhtml#rch3en16]In fact, each tribe in the Arabian Peninsula had its own god or goddess. Quraysh(the tribe of the Prophet) acquired the property of the god Hubal, who was thechief deity of the Ka‘bah. It was painted red and had the shape of a human. Itis claimed Hubal was brought from Syria, and “his hand was broken, so Qurayshprovided him a hand of gold instead.”17 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en17] The tribe ofHudhayl obtained the god Suwa‘, the tribe of Rabi‘ah worshiped the god Nasr, andthe tribe of Himyar had the goddesses al-Lat and al-‘Uzza.The two gods Suwa‘ and Nasr began as simple, naively carved idols; then theywere gradually transformed into gods bearing a relationship to heaven,particularly in the religion of Southern Arabia, which orbited around a worshipof the celestial triad of the sun, the moon, and the planet Venus.18[Notes.xhtml#rch3en18] The three goddesses, al-Lat, al-‘Uzza, and Manat, wereworshipped as angels, which once again testifies to the spread of the concept ofangels among pagan Arabs.19 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en19] They were occasionallyreferred to as daughters of Allah. “Those who do not believe in the world tocome name the angels with the names of females. They have not any knowledgethereof; they follow only surmise, and surmise avails naught against truth”(Qur’an 53:27–28).Arabs at that point in time even held the belief God kept angels for himselfbecause they were female. The Qur’an strongly condemns this belief: “What, hasyour Lord favored you with sons and taken to Himself from the angels females?Surely it is a monstrous thing you are saying!” (Qur’an 17:41).20[Notes.xhtml#rch3en20] Moreover, they believed these goddesses were veiledbecause of their close similarity to women. The sun, for example, which wasworshiped, is a feminine word in Arabic because its brilliant flame makes itdifficult to see.In fact, a belief in gods possessing the characteristics of angels was notlimited to pagan Arabs, but was rather common to many peoples of the Near East,specifically in the Canaanite and Mesopotamian religions, which had many wingedgods. Thus, the god El in the Canaanite religion is himself explicitly picturedwith four wings upon his shoulders, two for flying and two folded. His alliesare similarly pictured: “But to the rest of the gods two wings for each on theshoulders in order that they might fly with Kronos.”21 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en21]The banquet text from Ugarit (RS 24, 252; Ug. V.2), for example, reveals thegoddess Anat herself could fly: “And verily Anat flies swiftly, she soars likean eagle.”22 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en22]The idea of worshiping angels as goddesses and female sub-deities is one of themost perplexing ideas in the religion of polytheistic Arabia. It is known that afew Arab tribes of pre-Islamic Arabia had great contempt for female offspring.One of their most barbaric customs, which the Qur’an forcefully denounces inmany places,23 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en23] was the live burial of infant girls.Arabs in pre-Islam believed as well these female sub-deities interceded on theirbehalf before God. Furthermore, and now more astonishing to us, they maintainedangels were the children of unions between God and the daughters of the jinn. Inthe Qur’an, we find numerous allusions to the fact that the pre-Islamic Arabs,especially of the Hijaz region, believed Allah and the jinn were relatives. Someof them went so far as to worship the jinn because of their relationship to God.“Yet they ascribe to God, as associates, the jinn, though He created them; andthey impute to Him sons and daughters without any knowledge. Glory be to Him!”(Qur’an 6:100). The proper name of ‘Abdul-jinn (servant of the jinn) was spreadbefore the advent of Islam, which indicates that the adoration of the jinn wascommon.24 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en24] The Qur’an repeatedly refers to this worship:“Upon the day when He shall muster them all together, then He shall say to theangels, ‘Was it you these people were [worshiping?]’ They shall say, ‘Glory beto Thee! Thou art our Protector, apart from them, nay rather, No, they wereworshiping the jinn; most of them believed in them’” (Qur’an 34:40).The worship of the jinn is also attested to in Arab Safaitic inscriptions fromNorthern Arabia. The Arabs, to cite historian of Near Eastern religions JeanStarcky (b. 1910), brought these deities with them when the Syrian steppe wasarabized as a result of Arab invasions during the second half of the firstmillennium.25 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en25]The jinn-deities were especially conspicuous in the ancient Syrian city ofPalmyra. A similarity in beliefs between different areas of the ancient NearEast is only natural when we remember that since time immemorial, the Near Eastwas never an inaccessible area, and the Arabs were never as isolated as has beencommonly asserted. Trade and consecutive migration, as well as invasions andwars, connected them to other people in the area. Palmyra, for example, was amajor crossroad of peoples and cultures. Many peoples settled in it: first, theAmorites, then the Aramaeans, the Arabs, and finally the Romans.Some archeologists and historians of religion speak of the worship of jinn asgods in Palmyra, asserting these jinn-deities used to be called “gene” by theAramaeans (which also means invisible in Aramaic) at that time. These namesappear on inscriptions from the third century CE at Dura in the Jabal al-Sha‘r,northwest of Palmyra.26 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en26] W. F. Albright, a biblicalarchaeologist and Middle Eastern scholar noted especially for his excavations ofbiblical sites (d. 1971), relates that these deities were exactly the same asthe jinn who were worshiped by the pre-Islamic Arabs. He also believes thesesame deities were worshiped in Babylonia and other areas of the Near East underdifferent names.27 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en27]In 1933 and 1935, French archeologist and historian Daniel Schlumberger (d.1972) unearthed the area northwest of Palmyra and uncovered a great number ofinscriptions that were, for the most part, votive. They often mention the ginayaas the tutelary deities of villages, settlements, encampments, orchards, tribes,and so forth.Under Tiberius Augustus (14–38), Palmyra became a city tributary to the RomanEmpire, and was named Palmyra (in Arabic Tadmur). Under Antonius (96–193) andthe house of Severan (193–222), it was transformed into one of the chief citiesof the East that thrived until the middle of the third century CE. Gradually,the civilization of Palmyra became a mixture. There was great tendency tosyncretism. It is thought that “The Arab goddess al-Lat, for example, wasworshiped with the features of Athena.”28 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en28] Some evensurmise that the jinn-gods of Arab Palmyra gave birth to the Latin term“genie.”29 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en29]Contemporary archeologist and historian of the Middle East Javier Teixidor (b.1930) maintained, for example, there are many similarities between the twoconcepts of genie and jinn. Teixidor refers at length to the classical scholarswho acknowledged the existence of tutelary deities for persons as well asplaces, exactly like the pre-Islamic Arabs. He writes: “These innate (the jinn)were comparable to the Roman ‘genii’: they were deities who were tutelary ofpersons and places believed to take care of human lives and enterprises. Theyprotected flocks and caravans and also those who had settled or were in processof sedentarization. Shrines erected for such gods occurred especially in thesemi-nomadic surroundings of Palmyra in places that were centers of settled lifeand halts for passing caravans.”30 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en30]THE JINN INHABITED THE EARTH LONG BEFORE HUMANSThe idea that spiritual beings or gods were created before humans and inhabitedthe Earth long before them is found in many ancient religions. In general, worldmythologies speak of proximity and relationships between humans and gods orsupernatural beings. Primordially, Earth was closer to heaven. Humans and godsof all kinds mingled. Humans could climb to heaven through the axis mundi. Worldmythologies speak even of a marriage between heaven and Earth. An example ofthis is found in the Sumerian Epic tradition between the god Dumuzi and Inanna.Hesiod, Greek philosopher and poet who lived around 700 BCE, painted in his workTheogony the Greek myth of creation and the marriage between Ouranos (heaven)and Gaia (Earth). Ouranos embodies the Mountain of Heaven, which literally fallsupon Gaia. The result of this union is the birth of the mountains and the sea,etc. It is also thought the fairies of the Irish and Celtic mythologies are thechildren of the goddess Dana or Danann. They were later called the Fairy Folk orthe Sidhe. It is believed, “Wise men do not know the origin of the Tuatha DeDanann, but that it seems likely to them that they came from heaven, on accountof their intelligence and for the excellence of their knowledge.”31[Notes.xhtml#rch3en31]It is believed the jinn, before Islam, used to climb up to the heavens tooverhear the angels. However, the advent of Islam smothered their Prometheannature. If they attempt to approach the heavens, the fire of meteorites willburn them instantly. Beings of fire are vulnerable to fire, and because jinnkill by fire, they are killed by it. Only angels are allowed to dwell in heaven.In Islam, the relationship between jinn and angels started at the beginning oftime, when the jinn were sent to Earth by the Creator to build and prosper. Thestory of their creation before humans is mentioned in the Qur’an, “whereas thejinn We have created, long before that, out of the fire of scorching winds”(Qur’an 15:27*).When ‘Ali ibn abi Taleb, the Prophet’s son-in-law and the fourth caliph (d.661), was once asked whether there were people dwelling on Earth before Adam, hereplied: “Yes. God created the earth and created in it nations of jinn whopraised Him and glorified Him without interruption. They often used to fly toheavens, and meet with the angels and salute them, and learn from them goodthings as well as the events that were occurring there. Then they were expelledfrom the earth because they rebelled and shed blood and ignored God.”32[Notes.xhtml#rch3en32] In fact, in medieval Muslim narratives, the jinn arenamed “the Pre-Adamites.” The same pattern is repeated in all these sources timeand again: the jinn rebelled, spread corruption on Earth, and rejected the lawsof the prophets who came to them. Then God sent his army of angels to expel themfrom Earth and fierce and violent struggles occurred between jinn and angels. Alegion of angels equipped with swords or spears, with an angel named al-Harith33[Notes.xhtml#rch3en33] at their head, came down to Earth to fight the jinn. Theyattacked them with fire billowing out of their mouths and the jinn resistedvigorously. Finally, after intense fighting, the angels won, and the jinn weredefeated. God Almighty hurled on them a fire that burned them, and a wind thatblew them away, banishing them to the seas.34 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en34]But who were these spiritual entities that came to Earth to combat the bad jinn?Were they themselves angels or jinn?35 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en35] The confusionbetween the two entities resurfaces in these battles and many different versionsexist. The first one maintains the angels were helped by a lower category ofjinn, called hinn36 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en36]; while a second version representedby the Ikhwan al-Safa’, or the Brethren of Purity (who lived in Basra, Iraq,during the 10th century), as noted in one of their Epistles, contends God sentangels to chase away the evil among the jinn to the far extremities of theEarth. The angels, according to Ikhwan al-Safa’, took some of the jinn to heavenas prisoners, and among them was Iblis (Satan). He was then still a young jinni,and he was raised with the angels. When God created Adam, He said to the angels:“I am creating a vice-regent on earth, [other than you, and I will raise you toheavens].” The angels who were living on Earth abhorred the idea of leavingtheir familiar homeland, and answered God, “Are you going to put in it [theearth] people who will shed blood and do corruption, [as did the jinn], while weglorify You and praise You?”37 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en37]In a third variation on these dramatic events, it is mentioned the battlesoccurred between two categories of jinn: angels and jann, suggesting angels werealso named jinn since the term “jinn” refers to both spiritual entities.According to this account, God sent them an army of angels who were dwelling inthe lower heavens. “This army was called the jinn. Among those angels was Iblis.He came down with four thousands. He chased the jann away from the earth withhis army, and expelled them into the islands of the sea. Then Iblis and his armyinhabited the earth.”38 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en38] It looks like Iblis was the chiefof the angels in the lower heavens before God commanded him to come down toEarth and combat the bad jinn.39 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en39]Ibn ‘Arabi also confirms the dwelling of a pious Iblis on Earth before thecreation of Adam. He thinks that “God (exalted be He) had appointed him as avice-regent therein, along with a body of angels, and he had been there forquite a long time faithfully worshiping God.”40 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en40]The jinn in all of these accounts disobey the Divine command. What is themeaning of their disobedience, if not that they are the first to create apattern humans will imitate? Indeed, humans will rebel and reject heavenlymessengers. They will shed blood, spread corruption, and exploit theenvironment, as if the earth were to become the locus par excellence of defianceto the Divine and waywardness.Muslim writers raised these intriguing questions: Were all the jinn killed inthese battles? If some of them did survive the fierce battles with the angels,where did they hide? How long? There exists a popular belief that many of thosewho ran away have continued to roam the earth, even building giant constructionsand famous monuments. One finds frequent allusions to this belief in Arab poetryas well. In an ode by pre-Islamic poet al-Nabighah (d. 604), we read: “Exploitthe jinn, for I have permitted them/to build Tadmur [Palmyra] with iron andcolumns.”41 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en41]Folk Islam claims these “Pre-Adamites” jinn are still on Earth; they prefer todwell far from humankind, and choose the wild, deserted, and desolate placeswhere wasteland swarms with unknown perils. The expression “someone was hostedby a jinni” means he or she stayed in a wild place, where no friendly persondwells, except the jinn.42 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en42]Some sources suggest that Iblis remained on Earth only until the time of Adam,43[Notes.xhtml#rch3en43] while others maintain many jinn were still present whenAdam was created.44 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en44] Ibn Kathir (d. 1373) concurred withthe common acceptation of the idea the jinn remained on Earth in the company ofhumans, and still do.45 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en45]ANGELS IN ISLAMBecause jinn were forbidden to bear news from heaven to Earth, according to theQur’an, angels became the only transmitters of the Revelation. The angel Jibril(Gabriel), in particular, called al-ruh al-qudus (the Holy Spirit), as well asal-ruh al-amin (the Faithful Spirit) (Qur’an 26:192) and the “Entrusted PowerfulOne” (Qur’an 53:3–6) is the Revelatory angel to prophets. In the prophetictradition, Muhammad describes how Gabriel first brought the Revelation “downupon his heart.” “He came to him and said, ‘Read!’ He said, ‘I cannot read.’Then the Prophet said, ‘He seized me and squeezed me until all the strength wentout of me, and then released me and said, ‘Read!’ I said, ‘I cannot read.’ Thenhe said: ‘[Read]: In the name of thy Lord who created, created Man of ablood-clot. [Read]: And thy Lord is the Most Generous, who taught by the pen,taught Man that he knew not’” (Qur’an 96).46 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en46]Islamic philosophy debated at length the role of angels as messengers from thedivine to humans. The Ishraqi (illuminationist) School of philosophy inparticular distinguished itself by its original discussion of angels in Islam.Founded by al-Suhrawardi, the key argument was that humans could obtainknowledge by intuition, through the heart more than through reason. The angelGabriel is represented in this mystical philosophy as the source of intellectand the messenger of knowledge, not only to the Prophet Muhammad, but also tothe prophets Abraham, Zachariah, and the Virgin Mary as well. The Qur’anrecounts how the angel Gabriel came to Mary in the form of a handsome man toannounce she will bear Jesus. Gabriel, in the view of al-Suhrawardi and allIshraqi philosophers, is “the angel of knowledge.”47 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en47]Revelation in Islam is not limited to the Qur’an. The Hadith Qudsi (the HolyTradition) is one example because it is believed God directly spoke to theProphet without the intermediacy of the angel Gabriel.48 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en48]Moreover, in one singular instance, the Prophet is reported to have penetratedthe domain of the unseen in the night of the Ascension when a removal of theveils occurred, and no intermediary was present, as stated in the Qur’an: “Herevealed to His servant what He revealed. His heart didn’t lie about what he saw. . . He saw Him again another time” (Qur’an 53:10–13*).Many other angels are described in the Qur’an, as well as in other works, thoughnot all of these are messengers. There are, for example, the Guardian Angels whoare entrusted with the protection of each person, as mentioned in Qur’an13:10–11 and 6:61. There are al-hafazah (the Keeper Angels) (Qur’an 82:10 and85:4), who keep records for each person as mentioned in the Qur’an and thetraditions of the Prophet. There are messengers of good and protectors of humansfrom the assaults of the Devil as mentioned in Qur’an 13:11. There are theangels Munkar and Nakir who question humans in the grave while others arecustodians of paradise and hell. There is the angel Israfil who will sound thetrumpet to call the dead from their graves, as in Qur’an 61:73; 18:99; 20:99;and 34:51. He is described in the Wonders of the Creatures by geographeral-Qazwini (d. 1283) as being colossal in size, his feet reaching below theseventh earth, and his head reaching to the pillars of the Throne of God. Someangels bear the Throne of God on the Last Day, as described in Qur’an 59:17. Forthe most part, the Qur’an distinguishes angels from humans and jinn by theirinherent goodness. In Qur’an 66:6 God praises them because they unquestioninglyabide by what he commands. They are also praised in Qur’an 21:20 because theynever fail to worship him by night and by day. For Muslim medieval scholarship,being unconditionally obedient to God doesn’t imply angels are ignorant. Infact, one of the seminal questions discussed by Muslim scholars revolved aroundthe following: Are angels more knowledgeable than humans, or less? These debatestook as their main point of departure the Qur’anic passage Qur’an 2:28, wherethe angels seem to know that humans will bring havoc to the earth. Angelicsuperiority, however, is superseded by that of human consciousness in the personof the first prophet, Adam. God taught him all the names and, by that supremeknowledge, enabled his mind to penetrate every possible detail of the universe:“And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then he presented them unto theangels and said, ‘Now tell Me the names of these, if you speak truly.’ Theysaid, ‘Glory be to Thee! We know not save what Thou hast taught us’” (Qur’an2:29–31).The question of how the angels were able to know Adam’s descendants wouldcorrupt the earth has been argued frequently in Muslim theology. Historian andexegete ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d. 923), in his exegesis of the Qur’an, suggeststhey might have seen it in heaven’s al-lawh al mahfuz (Secured Records) where itis believed all knowledge from all time has been recorded. However, in Qur’an2:31, it appears Adam has greater knowledge than the angels, and it is Adamalone who is shown to possess the ability to think conceptually. It is Adam whois taught the supreme knowledge (the secret of all names) by God, and not theangels who acknowledge their ignorance and submit themselves to his will.Islamic philosophy constantly emphasizes the idea humans should strive to returnto their original “angelic” state. The treatises of Ikhwan al-Safa’ state thisis the goal of philosophy. They believe it is through philosophy that humansrealize the virtual characteristics of their humanness. They affirm, “Manattains the form of humanity, and progresses in the hierarchy of beings until incrossing the straight way (bridge) and the correct path he becomes an angel.”49[Notes.xhtml#rch3en49] In the same context, one should mention alsoal-Suhrawardi, who maintains in his visionary narratives that humans who purifythemselves could reach again their angelic state where they belong.Al-Suhrawardi particularly expands this commentary in The Rustling of Gabriel’sWings, which is a tale of exodus and a meeting with the angel Gabriel.50[Notes.xhtml#rch3en50] Finally, angels are always depicted as totally submittedto God and existing only to fulfill his commands. ‘Abdul-Qader al-Gilani (d.1166), founder of the Qaderi Order in Baghdad, believed, “Angels have no will,while prophets have no passion, and the rest of humans and jinn have both willand passion, except for certain saints who are free of passion.”51[Notes.xhtml#rch3en51]THE CASE OF IBLIS (SATAN)One of the crucial issues related to the mythical battles waged between theangels and the jinn on Earth at the beginning of time concerned the nature ofIblis: was he a jinni made out of fire or an angel made out of light? Muslimscholars differ as to whether Iblis was the chief of the angels who led thebattles against the jinn on Earth, or whether he was a repentant jinni whodisagreed with the evil jinn and who decided at a certain time to join theangels. The Qur’an is not very clear about it. In what follows, I will attemptto explain the two positions.Iblis as AngelIn Qur’an 17:61, we are shown that Iblis is among the angels. When God asked theangels to bow to Adam, they all bowed, except Iblis who is described in someMuslim sources as a four-winged angel.52 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en52] It is believedIblis, of all the angels, was the most afraid of Adam. Whenever he passed by himin paradise he would strike him, and Adam’s body would make an echoing soundlike clay.53 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en53] Some Muslim scholars stated Iblis was one ofthe guardians of paradise.54 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en54] They claimed, “Iblis was thechief of the angels of heaven and their ruler, as well as ruler over the earth.He was one of the most studious angels and the most knowledgeable. He ruledbetween heaven and earth. He took great pride and honor in it. But he becamearrogant and haughty. He rebelled and was ungrateful to God who transformed himinto a cursed devil, shaytan.”55 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en55]Al-Mu‘tazilah school of theology and Islamic thought (eighth–tenth century),which introduced the categories and methods of Hellenistic philosophy, tended toview Iblis as depicted in Qur’an 18:50 as an angel rather than a jinni.56[Notes.xhtml#rch3en56] Many Sufis were inclined to consider him a faithfulworshiper, if not the most faithful. In their eyes, Iblis rebelled because herefused to bow to anyone other than God. From this standpoint, he was an exampleof the sincere monotheist. Iblis did not envy humanity in the least, but wasinstead an enthusiastic lover of God’s unity. However, Persian Sufi Najm al-dinal-Razi (d. 1256) makes an exception among Sufis. He claims Iblis rebelledbecause he had insight into the future of Adam before the other angels. Najmal-din al-Razi tells how Iblis stole the news Adam would be appointed thevice-regent of God on Earth: “Iblis, that arrogant, black-fortuned one, who inhis inquisitiveness had once made stealthy and illicit entry into Adam’s frame,gazed with the eye of contempt upon the domain of his vice-regency, and desiredin vain to make a breach in the treasure house of his heart, was thereforeseized on the charge of robbery and bound with the rope of wretchedness. When itwas time for all the angels to prostrate themselves, Iblis was unable to do so,for he had in reality been bound with the rope of wretchedness on the day heentered the workshop of the unseen without permission.”57 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en57]In Najm al-din al-Razi’s opinion then, Iblis was punished not because he refusedto bow to Adam, but because he stole the news from the Divine Records withoutGod’s permission. This is rather unconvincing because several Muslim sourcesmaintained the angels might have read the future of Adam in the Secure Recordsas well, which didn’t prompt them in the least to rebel against God as didIblis. In any case, if Iblis were an angel, one cannot find in this Islamicexplanation of his “fall” any traces of the Christian consensus that the Devilhad fallen because of his envy of God or his desire to usurp God’s place ofpower. In the eyes of strictly monotheistic Islamic exegesis, it was unthinkableIblis could envy God.In Christianity, the duel between Satan and God is very conspicuous. The conceptof the Devil is central to The New Testament, where he appears as a counterprinciple to Christ. From the Christian point of view, there is a continuousconflict between good and evil and the mission of Christ is precisely to fightthe Devil and to save humans from his evil. Such a battle parallels otherbattles found in Zoroaster’s teachings: the battle of Ahura Mazda, the Wise Lordand the ultimate God against the arch-demon Angra Mainyu, who lives in darknessin the north, the home of all demons. In Islam, the concept of the Devil isdifferent. Muslims do not believe in the original sin. The utmost of God’sblessings to humans are the free will and the intellectual and moral abilitiesthat allow him/her to know and distinguish between good and evil. The human isaccountable for his/her use of all these blessings of God, and he/she ought tokeep in mind this accountability and take part in the fight against Devil. Thus,when Iblis asked, “My Lord, grant me a reprieve until the day they [the humans]are raised again,” God answered, “You are among the reprieved until the daywhose time is known” (Qur’an 15:36–37*).58 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en58]Iblis as JinniWe find in Qur’an 7:12–13 Iblis is created of fire, and therefore is a jinni.God, in these verses, asked Iblis what prevented him from bowing to Adam, andwhat permitted him to disobey the Divine command, and Iblis answered arrogantly:“I am better than he; You created me of fire, and him You created of clay.” Thejinn nature of Iblis becomes unquestionably certain in Qur’an 17:50. This verseunmistakably states Iblis was one of the jinn, and committed ungodliness againsthis Lord’s command.Those who reject Iblis’ angelic nature argue if he were an angel, he couldn’thave disobeyed God’s command when he refused to prostrate before Adam. Angelsact in accordance with God’s will as stated in Qur’an 2:33–34. Ibn Arabi expandson the reasons that made Iblis the jinni so haughty before Adam. He mentions theoriginal and everlasting enmity between jinn and humans. This hostility wasshown even before the creation of Adam, when the Angel of Death took a handfulfrom all parts of the Earth for God’s creation of Adam. When the clay for Adamwas kneaded to dough, and his form was shaped in that clay, it came about that“[Adam’s] soul was formed from that dust on which Iblis had trampled with hisfoot, whereas his heart was created from dust on which Iblis had not trampledwith his foot. Thus the soul acquired the evil and blamable qualities itpossesses from the touch of Iblis’ trampling. This is why the psyche al-nafs hasbeen appointed to be the abode of lusts, and Satan’s living in it and hisauthority over it is because his footprints are in it. This is also why Iblisthought himself superior to Adam, because he found him to be from the dust thathad been under his feet. Looking into the essence of his own constituentelement, which was fire, he then laid claim to the potter, and inclined tooverweening pride.”59 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en59]To resolve the incoherence between the two interpretations on the nature ofIblis, Muslim scholarship came up with some ingenious ideas. Al-Tabari, forexample, argued it is possible God created one part of his angels from light andanother part from fire; Iblis possibly could belong to that group of angels whowere created from the scorching winds. Al-Baydawi (d. 1286), meanwhile, had amore plausible explanation. He argued Iblis, a jinni made out of fire, wascarried off as a captive by the angels during one of the combats between jinnand angels that took place on Earth. Because Iblis was still a child, he grew upamong angels. When God ordered the angels to bow before Adam, Iblis refused, andthus revealed his true jinni nature.60 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en60]THE ISLAMIC CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN JINN AND ANGELS: SIMILARITIESBoth Are InvisibleIn his analysis of the common characteristics between jinn and angels, ibn Arabimaintains God meant them to be invisible. “When God created the luminous spiritsand the fiery ones, I mean angels and jinn, He gave them a common feature whichwas to be veiled from human eyes.”61 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en61]Although jinn and angels are beings of the invisible realm, they don’t belong tothe same degree or quality of invisibility in the sense that light is strongerthan fire. It has a deeper spiritual meaning. Light, out of which angels aremade, reaches farther in space. Indeed, angels belong to the celestial realm,which occupies a higher place in the Muslim hierarchical cosmology. It issituated above the imaginal or intermediary realm from where jinn come to visitour Earth.Both Are Disembodied SpiritsBoth jinn and angels are disembodied spirits. It is not possible to attribute toany creature the word “spirit” except to souls that don’t have bodies, such asjinn, angels, demons, and whatever resembles them. Spirits are in this senseincorporeal and eerie, and can’t be seen. They have a power, a life force, or anenergy that could be called “spiritual agency” believed to affect the course ofevents on Earth. In contrast, humans are corporeal, solid, and visible, and theyhave souls. Despite this sharp distinction, ibn ‘Arabi seems to seecommonalities between spirits and humans rather than differences. He writes thisintriguing and complex assertion, “Angels are souls blown into lights, jinn aresouls blown into winds, and human beings are souls blown into shapes ’ashbah.”62[Notes.xhtml#rch3en62] In this statement, ibn Arabi appears to be underscoringtwo things: one is the “artistic” act of creation referred to as “blown into”;and second is the term “soul” that these three beings share. Ibn ‘Arabi uses theterm ’arwah in Arabic. Humans are thus seen only through what is the mostsublime in them—the soul; they emerge as being essentially incorporeal. They areblown into “shapes!” He doesn’t use the term “bodies,” as if to make themlighter, less attached to Earth. By the same token, he causes the three kinds ofbeings to come closer to each other.Both Are Luminous BeingsBoth jinn and angels are luminous beings; fire and light are akin. All kinds ofspiritual entities, whether they are called peris, daevas, fairies, daemons,jinn, or angels, shine and are described in most traditions across the world asshining apparitions. It is believed light emanates even from Lucifer, the fallenangel, and the prince of darkness.Both Are Shape ShiftersIt is believed angels and jinn can take different shapes. Although jinn canembody any possible shape, including animals, angels can appear only inbeautiful forms. For example, it is told Gabriel came once to the ProphetMuhammad in the appearance of a very beautiful man wearing a robe of white clothand having very dark hair. He also manifested himself to the Virgin Mary as avery handsome man, as in Qur’an 19:16–21*: “Then We sent Our Spirit to her andit took on for her the form of a handsome, well-built man.”63[Notes.xhtml#rch3en63]Both Are Noncompounded BeingsBoth angel and jinn are not composed of the four elements. Angels are purelight, as we just mentioned. As for jinn, it is difficult to consider the fireand air of which they are composed are akin to the fire and air we know in ourmanifest world. The jinn’s fire is a pure, smokeless fire of a very soaringintensity. The jinn’s wind is scorching and of the highest possible strength.Both Came to EarthI have already expounded on the belief jinn inhabited the earth before humans.Medieval Muslim sources mention also angels came to Earth several times to fightthe evil jinn who spread corruption. They came later to humans, and deliveredheavenly messages to prophets. In one version of the mythical battles thatoccurred between the two spiritual entities, it is said angels stayed on Earthfor a while after chasing the evil jinn. More interesting, Sufis speak of angelscircumambulating the Ka‘bah thousands of years before Adam.Some accounts maintained that not only jinn are among us but angels as well. Inan intriguing text narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbas (d. 688), one of thecompanions of the Prophet Muhammad and one of the compilers who told manystories on him, we read: “God has angels on earth called al-hafazah [thekeepers]. They write down every leaf that falls from the trees. If any among youneeded help, when in a desert, or when in necessity, let him say, ‘O worshipersof God [meaning the angels], may God have mercy upon you, help me!’ Then, youwill be helped!”64 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en64]THE ISLAMIC CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN JINN AND ANGELS: DIFFERENCESDifferent GeographiesDespite the fact angels visited Earth several times and many of them might stillbe on our planet as claimed by some medieval compilers, the majority dwell inal-malakut, the celestial realm, while jinn live in the sublunary realm. Thedifferences between them do not become manifest by their acts and functionsalone, but also by the place they occupy in Islamic cosmology.65[Notes.xhtml#rch3en65] In his philosophical narrative entitled Hayy ibn Yaqzan,Muslim philosopher ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980–1037) envisages the “terrestrial”angels who visit Earth in the following terms: “He who succeeds in leaving thisclime enters the climes of the Angels, among which is one that marches with theearth, a clime in which the terrestrial angels dwell. These angels form twogroups. One occupies the right side: they are the angels who know and order.Opposite them is a group that occupies the left side: they are the angels whoobey and act. Sometimes the two groups of angels descend to the climes of menand jinn, and sometimes they mount to heaven.”66 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en66]Most important, because jinn belong to the intermediary realm, they remainessentially threshold beings, hesitant beings, so to speak, while angels arebound to be of only one nature because their domain is the starry heavens.WingsIt is known angels have wings. However, jinn are represented only in folk talesas flying, especially in the stories of The Nights. Interesting enough, we findmany demons in the old Sumerian and Babylonian mythologies are also picturedwith wings, such as Lamashtu. The Hebrew demons that borrowed their featuresfrom these mythologies have wings as well. Lilith, for example, is in the Bibleas a winged female demon who strangles children.In the prophetic tradition, angels are described as “spreading their wings forthe seeker of knowledge out of pleasure for what he is doing. Everyone in heavenand everyone on earth asks forgiveness for a man of knowledge, even the fish inthe water.”67 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en67]Muslim tradition maintained wings denote transcendence, freedom, and speed intime and space. Angels have a mission, which is to inform humans of God’scommands. Their wings denote their pure spiritual undertaking and hierarchy.Different PowersAngels and jinn possess different powers in various ways, which can be accesseddifferently by humans. Because they are thought to dwell in the sublunary world,it could be easier for humans to contact jinn than it is for them to contactangels in heavens. The power derived from getting in touch with each isdifferent, jinn being incapable of giving humans the power that angels arethought able to provide.68 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en68] Ibn Arabi argues, “Only thismuch is different—the spirits of the jinn are lower spirits, while the spiritsof angels are heavenly spirits.”69 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en69]Immortality Versus MortalityAngels are immortal; their food and drink consist of praising God, while fieryjinn eat, drink, sleep, procreate, and die, after having lived extremely longlives that can extend for thousands of years.70 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en70] In thiscontext, it is significant to draw some parallels with the concept of daemons inGreek philosophy that are represented as growing old and, finally, dying, likethe jinn. Greek epic poet Hesiod (who lived around 700 BCE) thinks, “The sumtotal of a daemon’s life span is nine-thousand seven-hundred and twentyyears!”71 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en71]To illustrate the jinn’s extended life span, The Tales of the Prophets includemany stories in which some of the jinn encountered a number of the prophets longbefore Muhammad. In these tales, it is claimed jinn met with many prophets sincetime immemorial, like Noah, Moses, Jesus and, finally, Muhammad who taught themthe Qur’an.72 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en72] Muslim writers even discussed the food thejinn eat, while angels have no need for it.73 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en73] When theangels, the guests of Ibrahim (Abraham), came to announce his wife would bearhim a son (Qur’an 15:51 and 11:72–74), Ibrahim, with the usual Arabianhospitality, invites them to eat. When he sees their hands do not reach out forthe food, he becomes afraid and understands they are heavenly messengers.Again, we can find a parallel here between the jinn and the daemons of Greekphilosophy, because unlike the angels, but like the jinn, the daemons also eatfood. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this fact is both daemons and jinndo not manifest themselves physically while eating. Greek philosopher of thethird century Philostratus, in The Life of Apollonius, tells the story of theghost of an Ethiopian satyr who was very enamored and pursued the women of avillage. Appollonius set up a trap, a container full of wine, and though theghost remained invisible, the wine was seen to disappear from the container.74[Notes.xhtml#rch3en74] Similarly, when a jinni married a girl from the tribe ofthe great Kufic jurist al-A‘mash (d. 765), he asked the jinni: “What is yourfavorite food?” “Rice,” answered the jinni. So he brought him some rice andwatched the rice disappearing, but no hands were taking it.75[Notes.xhtml#rch3en75] Muslim sources, however, indicate jinn prefer bones toany other food. As for the jinni who preferred rice, he seemed to have had infact an exotic taste. The Prophet once said, “Bones are the food of yourbrothers the jinn. They sniff them in the manner of animals.”76[Notes.xhtml#rch3en76]The jinn mate and procreate as well. However, when we talk about theirbiological functions, we have to bear in mind these are not similar to humans.Jinn mating, as ibn Arabi puts it, “is a curvature, the way you see smoke comingout of a furnace or from a clay oven, smoke mixing with smoke, and each of thetwo entities gaining pleasure from this meshing. As for the seed they eject, itis similar to the pollen of a palm tree.”77 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en77]When renowned compiler of prophetic tradition Wahb ibn Munabbih (d. 654) wasasked whether the jinn eat, drink, or mate, he replied: “Genuine jinn are likewinds; they do not eat, drink, sleep, or procreate in this world. Other speciesamong them eat, however, drink and mate, such as the si‘lats, the ghouls and thequtrubs, as well as those who resemble them.”78 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en78]Different AbilitiesAlthough angels know God innately and praise him incessantly, jinn, like humans,know God through their reflection and reason as well as through their intuition.Finally, if it is possible to describe an angel, it is almost impossible to givea full depiction of a jinni. Jinn being intermediary beings, the way they havebeen described has always been elusive. It is as if the imagination canendlessly play with their representation, while it remains confined to the realmof purity and certainty when it depicts the world of angels. And, althoughangels epitomize the heavenly realm, jinn suggest the multifarious sublunaryplane of transience and transgression, of antipodes and fragmentation. Jinn aretricksters par excellence, ambiguous, and indefinite. Angels belong to “theimmutable spiritual verities and the heavenly entities like the Pen, thePreserved Tablet, the Balance, and the Throne.”79 [Notes.xhtml#rch3en79]CONCLUSIONBy prohibiting the jinn from climbing to heavens, Islam consecrated theseverance of beings of light from beings of fire, highlighted the hierarchicalstructure of the cosmos, and stressed that jinn are not allowed to trespass thecelestial domain of the angels above them. Islam, thus, emphasized the sublunaryposition of the jinn and stressed the immortal and pure light of the angels. Bydegrading the jinn, Islam didn’t, however, demonize them or oppose them toangels because it clarified jinn could be good or bad like humans.The most significant consequence of this new repartition of spiritual beings wasMuslims should mainly understand the jinn through the lens of cosmology, whichopened wide the doors to a deep interpretation of things beyond the simplecontrast of evil versus good."},{"pageContent":"4Divination, Revelation, and the Jinn When he invited Satan to his Call, His own Satan turned Muslim on his account. He made the call likewise, with the consent of the Creator, Clear to the jinn on the Night of the jinn. —FARID AL-DIN AL-‘ATTAR (d. 1230)With the advent of Islam, jinn were transformed from kings of the unseen toservants of the new religion. Islam retained their power, but made itsubservient to the One God. They could still change the course of human eventsif God willed them to do so. Those who didn’t join Islam, the evil ones, weretold in the Qur’an they would be accountable for their bad deeds on the Day ofJudgment.To comprehend the complex and difficult relationship of the jinn to the Islamicrevelation, we need to place it in the overall Islamic standpoint, whichstipulates all beings, everything in the universe, whether animate or inanimate,receive the Word of God and worship him. The Qur’an repeatedly maintains thisassertion. The jinn who accepted the Qur’an are part of this general Islamicpicture.“The seven heavens and the earth, and whosoever in them is, extol Him; nothingis, that does not proclaim His praise, but you do not understand theirextolling” (Qur’an 17:44).DIVINATION IN ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN TRADITIONS AND IN PRE-ISLAMIC ARABIANear Eastern TraditionsDivination is a worldwide cultural phenomenon anthropologists ascertain stillexists in most traditions across our planet. It is believed diviners search toobtain information from supernatural and invisible powers with whom they enterinto contact. They then attempt to decode the signs they received from theseauthorities. Diviners claim the future they predict could be prevented throughrepentance, prayer, and proper apotropic rituals.In the ancient Near East, diviners from different countries influenced eachother through conquests, wars, religions, trades, and travels. Divination wascentral to the peoples of the ancient Near East, regardless of its origin inpre-Islamic Arabia, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, or Persia where divinationreached its peak at the time of emperor Khosro I Anoshirvan (531–578 BCE).Divination through the stars was especially important to Sassanian Imperialideology. The stars ruled the destiny of humans, and the kings anticipatedreceiving special protection from their diviners. It is said the Magiinterpreted the eclipse of the sun as the declining of the Greeks, against whomthe Persians were fighting. References about divination in Persia can be foundespecially in the famous epic, Shah-namah (Book of Kings) of al-Firdawsi, abual-Qasim (d. 1020). This work is bursting with stories where the destiny of theheroes is determined in the astronomical charts read at the time of their birth.In the story of Alexander, for example, the sages discerned the downfall of theking from the birth of a monstrous child.In Babylon, divination was a basic feature of life. Senior practitioners hadinfluence and were held in high esteem. Both individuals and officers of stateconsulted them on important occasions. Around 2000 BCE, a variety of omens werewritten down and collected. They are considered the largest surviving type ofAkkadian literature. In the Assyro-Babylonian civilization, the seers, or baru(which literally means “an inspector of the divine,” or “one who sees thedivine”), were a special class of priests whose main job was to ascertain thewill of the gods through dreams and visions, which they were then supposed todecipher. The baru had a collective lexicon of symbolic and significant eventsthat formed the basis of his opinions.1 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en1]The object of divination was to determine the future and will of the deities bywatching the behavior of an animal’s sacrifice. Such reactions as a change incolor, appearance of the entrails, and activity of the smoke from a burntoffering would help the baru to forecast the future. It was believed reading thesigns in such a way, particularly from observing the shapes of a liver, was theinvention of the Assyrian god Shamash. This remained the main means ofconsulting the will of gods, even as divination from celestial bodies wasgaining importance, as late as in the reign of King Nabonidus (555–539 BCE).Divination in Pre-Islamic ArabiaDivination, kihanah, or the action of the seers, was extensively spread amongthe pre-Islamic Arabs. It is defined as “the art of predicting the future.”2[Notes.xhtml#rch4en2] It was believed seers often entered into contact with thejinn from whom they obtained their knowledge that they then communicated totheir kin. Arabs at that point in time imagined the jinn, because of their swiftmotion, were able to go up to the gods and quickly snatch the gods’ news andcommunicate it to the seer. In the pre-Islamic period, seers were consideredspiritual and intellectual guides, capable of attaining the highest degrees ofclairvoyance regarding the most important matters of life and death. Their workwas far from being limited to individual requests and religious matters. Theywere consulted on practical daily matters, such as wars and quarrels betweentribes, finding lost animals, transferring blessings or curses, removing cursescast by others, and settling disputes between individuals.Seers were highly respected in Arabia. Each tribe had its own seer, its ownpoet, and its own preacher. Sometimes the seer was altogether an orator and kindof poet, because his prose consisted of sophisticated rhymed prose3[Notes.xhtml#rch4en3], which was condemned by the Prophet Muhammad at the adventof Islam, mainly because of its connection to the seers of the pre-Islamicperiod, and particularly because “none knows the Unseen in the heavens and earthexcept God” (Qur’an 27:65). In one of his sayings, the Prophet is reported tohave said: “Beware the rhymed prose of the seers.”4 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en4]Sometimes, seers were also asked to guard the sanctuaries and offer sacrificesto the gods.5 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en5] Very few seers, however, bore theseresponsibilities simultaneously. A different person Arabs called sadin, meaning“custodian” of a sanctuary, fulfilled these obligations.6 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en6]Many sanctuaries had their guardians. In Mecca, for example, the Ka‘bah had itsown custodian. He was often called the servant ‘abd al Ka‘bah. The reverence forthe servant of the sanctuary was derived from the importance of the sanctuary heguarded. For example, the custodian of the Ka‘bah was more respected than thecustodian of the shrines of the goddesses. The rank of custodian of a sanctuarygenerally remained within the same family for generations.7[Notes.xhtml#rch4en7]Despite the reverence accorded to the seers in general, they were never lookedupon as a priestly caste. The seer of pre-Islamic Arabia was more a divinerrather than a priest of the hallowed altar. He was not an official serving acentralized state because many Arab tribes during that time were essentiallynomads. In fact, the question of the seer’s relation to a temple or specificritual was insignificant to the pre-Islamic Arabs who were mostly engrossed inthe seer’s relationship to the jinn. People thought the seer was under the swayof his personal jinni who was also called tabi‘ (follower) and sometimes ra’i(visionary). They also believed he received news from heavens through his ownjinni.8 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en8] One legend of pre-Islam tells how the seer ‘Amribn Luhayy (reputed to have lived in the third century CE) was ordered by hisown jinni to travel to Syria to bring back idols.9 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en9]In pre-Islam, it was imagined the jinni would convey the “stolen” data from thesky to the seer, as follows; “He would empty the secret heard from heaven intothe ear of the soothsayer the way you empty a bottle of its contents.”10[Notes.xhtml#rch4en10] The jinn, it was thought, had many different ways ofgetting the “heavenly” information. Sometimes “they would climb to the heavens,one on top of another, until the one on top could hear the deity. He would thentransmit what he heard to the one under him, and so on, until it reached thefirst jinni who would then cast it into the ear of the seer. The latter wouldtake it and embellish it.”11 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en11] Arabs at that point in timebelieved some seers themselves were the offspring of unions between humans andjinn, such as a seer named Shiqq. They envisioned “his mother was one of thejinn, and that she was from the town of Maryul where the jinn dwell.”12[Notes.xhtml#rch4en12] They described him as half a person with one hand, oneleg, and one eye. Another legendary seer of Banu Dhi’b by the name of Satih wasrepresented as made of such soft flesh that you would fold him up as you wouldfold a robe. He had no bones except for his skull. His face was in his chest. Itwas believed these seers lived for many centuries.13 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en13]But divination was not limited to men in the pre-Islamic period. Many narrativesof that time reveal the names of many women seers who had their own jinni, likeTarifah al-Khayr, Salma al-Hamadaniyyah, Fatimah bint al-Nu‘man, and Zarqa’al-Yamamah. Arab priestesses were considered very powerful. People believed thejinni working with a female seer takes possession of her body more easily thandoes the one working with a male seer. They thought something other than thepriestess herself, an intervening agent from outside, entered her body and spokethrough her lips.In one legend, the priestess Tarifah advised her tribe of al-Ghasasinah toconquer the tribe of ‘Akk. But a jinni by the name of Jaza‘ ibn Sinanintervened, and fought beside the people of ‘Akk. In spite of this, theal-Ghasasinah won the war.14 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en14] This is the same Tarifah whopredicted the collapse of the dam of Ma’rib.15 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en15] We arealso told Quraysh in pre-Islam wanted to control the well of Zamazam after Abdal-Muttaleb (the grandfather of Muhammad) found it. To solve this dispute,Quraysh suggested a priestess from Banu Sa‘d be the judge between them and Abdal-Muttaleb.16 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en16] Another Muslim historian tells the storyof a woman seer by the name of ‘Ufayra from Himyar, who succeeded ininterpreting the dream of the king Murtadd ibn ‘Abdul-Kilal when all the othermale seers failed. The king wanted to marry her, but she refused because herjinni/lover would have been jealous.17 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en17]It is alleged the jinni would always require from his seer a hulwan (sweetreward). The jinni sometimes refused even to transmit the knowledge to the seerif he was not rewarded. It is possible to read this act as a minor sacrifice theseer offers to his jinni. To obtain the jinni’s divine knowledge and prompt its“descent” on him, the seer was compelled to always obey the request of hisjinni.18 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en18]Divination in Greece and RomeThe same belief seems to have prevailed among the ancient Greeks. In Greektradition, the power of the seers was also derived from spiritual entitiescalled daemons, capable of foretelling the future. The Greeks considered daemonsmediators between humans and gods, interpreters of symbols, and the mouthpieceof destiny at the oracular shrines. Divination had its public representatives inthe priestesses of the oracles, particularly in the Pythia of Delphi. Historiansof Antiquity tell “the oracle of Delphi was written in an incomprehensiblemanner. The client would take the written piece to a professional interpreterwho would explain it to him. Around the temple of Delphi, many seers wereconsulted to ‘explain’ the etymological origins of the oracle’s words.”19[Notes.xhtml#rch4en19] Interesting enough, it seems there was a reward or a feeto be given, like the oracle of pre-Islamic Arabia. It is not, however,specified if this reward was offered to the seer or to the daemon. “Anybody whowanted to consult the oracle, whether in a private capacity or as delegate froma city, had first to pay a fee, known as the pelanos (sacred cake). InEuripides’ Ion, the young servant of the temple says to the Athenian women whohave come to Delphi with their queen, Creusa, ‘If you have offered the sacredcake in the temple and wish to consult Apollo, draw near these altars.’”20[Notes.xhtml#rch4en20]Many Greek philosophers spoke with pious respect of the Delphic oracle.Heraclitus, who lived in the late sixth century BCE and whose philosophy focusedon the unity of opposites in everything, believed in the power of the sibyls.Socrates (d. 399 BCE) wanted religious questions to be treated by revealeddecisions from the Pythia of Delphi. He often expressed his belief in a kind ofirrational intuition, in what he called the inner voice of the “daemon.” Plato(d. 347 BCE) himself is reputed to have said, “Every daemon is something inbetween a god and a mortal.”21 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en21] He emphasized theimportance of rationality, but asserted, however, that divine intentions mightbe unveiled through utterances that are not due to reason, but to a psychicstate of adulation. “Plato considers the daemons, whom we can call genii [jinn]and lares, to be ministers of the gods, guardians of humans, and interpretersfor humans should the latter wish anything from the gods.”22[Notes.xhtml#rch4en22]In doing so, Plato went beyond the limits of fifth century rationalism. In fact,Plato enriched the tradition of Greek rationality with some emotional elementsand some occult religious ideas as scholar E. R. Dodds (b. 1893) stresses: “Inthe Timaeus, where he is trying to reformulate his earlier vision of man’sdestiny in terms compatible with his later psychology and cosmology, we meetagain the unitary soul of the Phaedo; and it is significant that Plato appliesto it the old religious term that Empedocles had used for the self—he calls itthe daemon.”23 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en23]Greek philosopher Plutarch (d. 125)—who served as one of the two priests at thetemple of Apollo at Delphi, site of the renowned Delphic prophecy—went a stepfurther by arguing, “Daemons are spiritual beings that think so intensely thatthey produce vibrations in the air which enable other spiritual beings (i.e.,other daemons) as well as highly sensitive men and women, to ‘receive’ theirthoughts, as through antennae. Thus the phenomena of clairvoyance, prophecy, andthe like can be explained.”24 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en24]In Roman divination, daemons were not as important as they were in Greekdivination. The inspection of a slaughtered animal, especially the liver, wasamong the most important kinds of predicting the future. Romans believed theliver was a mirror image of the macrocosm, especially when pulled out hot. Themost important works of divination in ancient Rome were The Sibylline Books thatwere put down by the Sibyls of Cuma; the title Sibyl referred to the positionand not to an individual. The Sibyls were the prophetesses of Apollo, who wrotetheir answers to questions on palm leaves; they were kept for centuries andconsulted on special occasions only by order of the senate before battle or whenin danger of attack.There were many generations of Sibyls over the centuries.25[Notes.xhtml#rch4en25] The Roman scholar Varro listed ten of them in the firstcentury BCE. A famous Sibyl emerges in both epic and tragic poetry: it was thefigure of the young Trojan woman, Cassandra, daughter of Priam and beloved ofApollo.26 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en26]In all these civilizations of the ancient Middle East, it was believed spiritualentities, be it jinn or daemons, snatched away the news from heavens anddelivered it to seers. Ancient Greece, however, distinguished itself bystressing not only seers but also enlightened people like philosophers and poetscould themselves communicate with the invisible through daemons. Socrates’example illustrates perfectly this view. Greek thought during this timehighlighted the necessity of according significance to both reason andintuition. Islam, as shall be seen later in this book, stressed equally thesetwo aspects. However, as already stated, Islam prohibited the jinn from climbingup to the heavens. By doing so, it limited the access to the invisible toprophets who receive the Word of God through angels, thereby causing Revelationto supersede divination.THE DESCENT OF THE REVELATIONIt is in this ancient Near Eastern environment where divination was prevailingthat the Qur’anic revelation came down upon the Prophet Muhammad. Immediately,pagan Arabs initiated a brutal battle against it. They disbelieved in it andferociously rejected Islam’s condemnation of their way of life, especiallypre-Islamic divination and its association with the jinn. The Qur’an utterlyrebukes the assistance many pagan Arabs sought from seers and jinn. To stop theproliferation of “news” from above, Islam secluded the divine in “secured”heaven and forbade jinn from approaching it. The Qur’an states that the jinnsoon discovered this new reality, “and we stretched toward heaven, but we foundit filled with terrible guards and meteors. We would sit there on seats to hear;but any listening now finds a meteor in wait for him” (Qur’an 72:8–9).The Prophet himself is reported to have passed negative judgments on divinationin general, and on the use of the jinn in particular, such as, “He who practicesevil omens is not of us [Muslim community]. He who soothsays or listens todivination is not of us.”27 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en27] Or, “He who resorts to a seeror a fortune-teller is a heretic who does not believe in what has been sent downupon Muhammad.”28 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en28]Muslim scholars discredited the value of messages transmitted by seers. Theroles of prophets and seers became diametrically opposed because prophets weredevoted to God, while seers served spiritual entities, such as the jinn. Moreimportant, although a seer was viewed as simply someone who had psychic powers,and who employed the jinn to unveil the hidden world, the Prophet Muhammad waschosen by God to pass on his message to humans, as the Qur’an expresses it: “Hediscloses not His Unseen to anyone, save only to such a messenger as He iswell-pleased with” (Qur’an 72:25–26) or “God will not inform you of the Unseen;but God chooses out of His Messengers whom He will” (Qur’an 3:174).Islamic scholarship commented at length on the choice of the prophets by God. Itunderscored the election by God from among the purest and most moral of hishumans. It stated, “Prophecy is not a qualification by the Prophet himself, nora degree that can be attained and acquired. It is not an internal preparationthat enables a prophet to be in contact with the spiritual realm. It is a mercysent by God to whomever he elects among His servants.”29 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en29]Although the jinni delivered data from the unseen to the seer, the ProphetMuhammad is reported to have received revelation through the intermediacy ofGabriel. As ibn ‘Arabi (d. 1240) sums it up, “Revelation in the most specificsense is the descent of the angel upon the hearing and heart of the messenger orprophet, and it no longer occurs, since there is no prophet after Muhammad.”30[Notes.xhtml#rch4en30]Finally, although seers in pre-Islam were devoted to presage the future to kingsand chiefs of tribes, revelation according to Islam manifested itself asuniversal—a “mercy unto all beings” (Qur’an 21:107), and Muhammad as “the sealof all prophets” (Qur’an 33:40). However, some Sufis unfoundedly believedMuhammad was elected as “the seal of all prophets” since the beginning of time.They repeatedly quote this Hadith, “I was a prophet when Adam was still betweenwater and clay.”31 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en31]From the outset of Muhammad’s prophethood, Meccans deemed the revelation a formof divination. They projected the image of their seers upon Muhammad and decodedthe early chapters of the Qur’an in the light of their pre-Islamic beliefs. Forexample, the fact after the initial revelation in the Cave of Hira‘ Muhammadwent to his wife Khadijah and had her wrap him in a cloak (Qur’an 73): “O thouenwrapped in thy robes,” was understood by Meccans as a sign the Prophet was aseer, because seers in the pre-Islamic period wrapped themselves up in a similarway.32 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en32]In the prose rhymes of the Qur’an, many Meccans found resemblances to theutterances of pre-Islam’s seers who spoke in a similar form of rhymed discourse.They thought the Qur’an was communicated to Muhammad by one of the jinn whousually dictate their words to seers, or that he might be possessed by a jinni,like the pre-Islamic diviners. The Qur’an, however, responds to this in Qur’an52:29: “Therefore remind! By thy Lord’s blessings thou art not a soothsayerneither possessed.” The Meccans also claimed the Qur’an was the work of a poet.They are represented as saying: “What, shall we forsake our gods for a poetpossessed?” (Qur’an 37:36), or in Qur’an 36:69, “We have not taught him poetry;it is not seemly for him. It is only a remembrance and a Clear Qur’an.”33[Notes.xhtml#rch4en33]These verses generated lengthy discussions on ilham (poetical inspiration) andwahi (revelation) among Muslim scholars, in which they analyzed the relationshipof meaning to rhyme in the Holy Book as compared to that in Arabic poetry ingeneral. To distinguish between revelation and inspiration, Muslim scholarsreckoned inspiration as being inferior to revelation because it doesn’t refer toa dream vision or to the encounter with the angel. It is an act of theimagination, and not a transmission of the Divine to other men.34[Notes.xhtml#rch4en34] In general, Meccans were divided with regard to the truthof the revelation as al-Walid ibn al-Mughirah, one of the notable chiefs ofMecca, stated after listening to Muhammad: “The nearest thing to the truth isyour saying that he is a sorcerer who has brought a message, by which heseparates a man from his father, or from his brother, or from his wife, or fromhis family.”35 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en35]The Prophet is described as having an eloquent and powerful speech as well as abeautiful voice when reciting the Qur’an. The same aforementioned person heardhim reciting the Qur’an one day at the Ka‘bah. He returned to the people ofQuraysh and said to them, “By God, I heard from Muhammad a speech that does notbelong to human speech nor to the speech of the jinn.”36 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en36]News about the Prophet’s physiological and emotional condition during thedescent of the revelation bewildered Meccans even more. Muhammad himselfdescribed it in these terms: “Sometimes, it is revealed like the ringing of abell—this form of revelation is the hardest of all—and then this state passesaway after I have grasped what is revealed. Sometimes the Angel Gabriel comes inthe form of a man and talks to me, and I comprehend all what he says. [‘A’ishah,the Prophet’s wife, added], ‘Once I saw the Prophet receive the revelation on avery cold day, and observed sweat dropping from his forehead as the revelationwas fulfilled.’”37 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en37]The Qur’an sustained its discussion of revelation as coming from the Divine andunderscored the futility of Meccans’ arguments. To differentiate betweenrevelation and the seers’ possession by jinn, the Qur’an reminded pagan Arabsthat the Word of God has such power, energy, and absoluteness that it coulddestroy mountains as in Qur’an 59:21: “If We had sent this Qur’an down upon amountain, thou wouldst have seen it humbled, split asunder out of the fear ofGod.”38 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en38]However, the battle between those who joined the new religion and pagan Arabscontinued for a while. Toward the end of the Prophet’s life, and during thefirst Caliphate of Abu Bakr (d. 634), many soothsayers tried to impose againtheir seership on the Arabs. Some of them even proclaimed themselves prophets,and entered into war against the new religion. One of the most well-knownleaders of these battles was Musaylimah al-kadhdhab (d. 632) (Musyalimah theliar), who proclaimed himself the prophet of Yamamah in the Arabian Peninsula.Another “false” prophet arose in Yemen, just after the death of Muhammad in 632.He was surnamed Dhu al-Khimar (the man of the veil) and also al-Aswad (the blackone). He revolted against Islam (claiming revelations for himself), seizedcontrol of the Yemen, and made San‘a his capital until he was assassinated in632 CE. His death marked the end of the soothsayers’ rebellion in Arabia.39[Notes.xhtml#rch4en39]MUHAMMAD AND THE JINN IN THE QUR’ANIt is from the Qur’an we essentially learn of the encounters of the ProphetMuhammad with the jinn. The Qur’an, however, does not give the origin, thenumber, and the names of these jinn. According to it, there seem to be twoencounters.40 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en40] In Qur’an 46:29–32, the jinn listening tothe Prophet seem to be Jewish jinn because they mention they already believed inthe revelation of Moses, while in Qur’an 72:2–7, the jinn who heard the Qur’anand accepted the revelation seem to be pagans who formerly aided soothsayers.Therefore, the two chapters relate two separate events that took place duringtwo separate journeys.41 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en41]Scholars in Islamic tradition agree the event mentioned in Qur’an 46:29–32 tookplace during the Prophet’s return journey from Ta’if in the tenth year of hisprophethood around 619. It is said to have taken place in the small oasis ofNakhlah, on the way leading from Mecca to Ta’if, as al-Tabari (d. 923)maintains. In these verses, we read:And when We turned to thee a company of jinn giving ear to the Qur’an; and whenthey were in its presence they said, “Be silent!” Then, when it was finished,they turned back to their people, warning. They said, “Our people, we have hearda Book that was sent down after Moses, confirming what was before it, guiding tothe truth and to a straight path.”Ibn Ishaq (d. 768), one of the first biographers of the Prophet, asserted thesejinn came from the region of Nusaybin in Syria (now in Turkey). They listened toMuhammad and ran to their fellow jinn to warn them.42 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en42]Al-Kashani (d. 1680)argued the jinn who came to listen to the Prophet were nine,and only one was from Nusaybin, while the other eight were from the jinn tribeof Banu ‘Amru ibn ‘Amir.43 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en43]A careful reading of Qur’an 8–20 clearly shows the second encounter of the jinnwith the Prophet could only have happened during the early years of theprophethood. The jinn used to listen to the news of heaven. In these verses, itis stated that with the advent of Islam, every time they reached out towardheaven they found it filled with mighty guards and comets. Some of them beganroaming around looking for the cause, and on such a raid, a company of themheard the Qur’an being recited, and went to warn the rest of the jinn about it.Ibn Mas‘ud, one of the closest companions to the Prophet, maintains there was noone with the Prophet during his second encounter with the jinn. They saw himcoming from afar and asked him where he had been, and he replied, “the jinn’semissary came to me, and I went to recite the Qur’an to them.” Ibn Mas‘udcontinued, “He took us and showed us their traces and the traces of theirfire.”44 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en44] Another commentator of this specific Qur’anicchapter claims, “Seventy-one jinn came and pledged allegiance to the Prophet forfasting, performing the prayers, the zakat (alms), the jihad and giving adviceto Muslims. They apologized because they had said ‘outrageous things about God.’As for their pledge, it is asserted in their saying at the beginning of thechapter: ‘When we heard the guidance, we believed in it’ [Qur’an 72:14]. As tohow they perform all their obligations, we do not know.”45[Notes.xhtml#rch4en45]According to Zubayr ibn al-’Awwam, one of the ten companions who were personallypromised paradise by the Prophet, the Prophet on this particular night sat allthe time inside a circle reciting the Qur’an to the crowds of jinn who met him.He tells that the Prophet, after performing the prayer in the mosque ofal-Madinah, asked his companions:“Which of you will follow me to a delegation of the jinn tonight?” But thepeople kept silent and no one said a word. He asked it three times, then hewalked past me and took me by the hand, and I walked with him until all themountains of Madinah were distant from us and we had reached open country. Andthere we encountered men, tall as lances, completely wrapped in their mantlesfrom their feet up. When I saw them, a great quivering seized me, until my feetwould hardly support me from fear. When we came close to them, the Prophet drewa line for me on the ground with his big toe and said: “Sit in the middle ofthat.” When I sat down, all the fear I had felt before left me. The Prophetpassed between them and me, and recited the Qur’an in a loud voice until dawn.Then he walked past me and said: “Take hold of me.” So I walked with him, and wewent a little distance. Then he said to me: “Turn and look. Do you see anyonewhere these were?” I turned and said: “O Apostle of God, all I see isblackness!”46 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en46]This encounter of the Prophet with the jinn remains shrouded with mystery. Thebeings described as jinn are tall and “completely wrapped in black from theirfeet up,” which makes it impossible to distinguish any detail of thesedisembodied beings. They are represented as mere shapes, kind of “black ghosts”that move. They are not perceived as individuals, or separate entities, butrather as a compact mass, as “blackness.” This lack of precision raises doubtsabout the possibility of perceiving them. It was already mentioned in this bookthat jinn are imaginal beings, which means they manifest themselves within theparameters of an immaterial corporeality. Moreover, ibn al-’Awwam was in aterrible state of anxiety and dread, which held back any possible objectivity.There is a double inscrutability here: the darkness of the night and the factthe jinn were enveloped in the murkiness of their black mantles that disguisedthem. It is as if this double obscurity acknowledged their belonging to thehidden world. They seem to be out there for ibn al-’Awwam only because they movein the open country. Their shrouded march is a possible indication of theirreality. The Prophet alone appears to discern them. He read the Qur’an to themall night long in “a loud voice” and in all quietude. Al-’Awwam becomes serenein turn when he sat in the circle Muhammad drew for him with his big toe.Muhammad himself remained all night in another circle reciting the Qur’an. TheProphet seems to be knowledgeable of the protective and sacred power of thecircle, which hinders evil from entering it, and impinges tranquility on the onewho dwells inside it. The circle is known in many traditions across the world“as having no beginning or end, and spacelessness as having no above or below;as circular and spherical it is the abolition of time and space.”47[Notes.xhtml#rch4en47] As such, it is an eternal and a “shielding” space that isdelivered from contingencies.Finally, this story exemplifies the notion Muhammad was sent to both humans andjinn as the majority of Muslim theologians argued during this time.Although the Qur’an mentions only two encounters between the Prophet and thejinn, Muslim literature invented a number of additional encounters. In most ofthese narrations, it is claimed the jinn came several times to the Prophet toask for guidance and wisdom in settling their disputes.48 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en48]For popular Islam, it seemed only natural the Prophet interacted with thesespiritual entities more than twice, as the Qur’an reveals. Popular Islamemphasized the notion that a face-to-face encounter was necessary, inasmuch asthe jinn were beginning to learn about the new religion and constantly neededelucidations and advice.Some authors even indicated the exact locations of these encounters between thejinn and the Prophet. Needless to say, mentioning a real place where thesemeetings are thought to have occurred makes them all the more gripping andenthralling in the eyes of Muslims. Compiler Muhammad ibn ‘Abdallah al-Azraqi(d. 1582), for example, maintains, “In the upper areas of Mecca there is amosque called the Mosque of the Jinn. It is also called the Mosque of theAllegiance.”49 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en49] It is claimed the jinn proclaimed theirallegiance to the Prophet in this mosque. In yet another account, Malik ibnAnas, one of the Prophet’s companions, narrates the following intriguingencounter of the Prophet with a very old jinni. Anas alleges he was withMuhammad, leaving the mountains of Mecca, when an old sheikh came by.The Prophet said to the jinni: “This is the stride of a jinni, as well as thetone of his voice!” The jinni replied: “My name is Hamah ibn Laqqis ibn Iblis.”The Prophet said: “Only two generations separate you from him [Iblis].” Hereplied: “True.” The Prophet asked: “How long have you lived?” The jinnireplied: “Almost all of time. I was a small boy when Abel was killed. I believedin Noah and repented at his hands after I stubbornly refused to submit to hiscall, until he wept and wept. I am indeed a repentant—God keep me from beingamong the ignorant! I met the prophet Hud and believed in his call. I metAbraham, and I was with him when he was thrown in the fire. I was with Joseph,too, when his brothers hurled him into the well—I preceded him to its bottom. Imet the prophet Shu‘ayb, and Moses and Jesus the son of Mary, who told me: ‘Ifyou meet Muhammad, tell him Jesus salutes thee!’ Now I’ve delivered his messageto you, and I believe in you.” The Prophet said: “What is your desire, O Hamah?”He said: “Moses taught me the Torah, Jesus the Gospels, can you teach me theQur’an?” So the Prophet taught him the Qur’an.50 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en50]This dialogue attributed to a jinni and the Prophet seems a lesson in religionrather than a conversation between a spiritual entity that manifested itself andthe Prophet of Islam. It is meant to encapsulate beliefs regarding Islam ingeneral, and the jinn in particular. First, it reminds Muslim listeners and/orreaders spiritual entities could be as pious as humans, and even better, andthey seek to learn about the world of the Spirit in general, and about Islam inparticular. Second, jinn seem to know about all past revelations because theylive very long lives, which allow them, like this jinni, to have contact withpast prophets. Third, Islam is indeed a religion of synthesis that accepted allthe prophets who came before Muhammad.51 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en51] The jinnispecifically underscores a greeting from Jesus to the Prophet, which shows howthe figure of Christ is cherished in popular Islam. Finally, it highlights apopular belief that Muhammad did engage in dialogue with the jinn.One could, however, wonder about the truth of these accounts ascribed to theProphet, especially the last one. It is impossible not to discern a popularvoice that added material to satisfy popular demands. It goes without saying thefigure of the Prophet in the Qur’an is different from his figure in theseaccounts.CONCLUSIONWith respect to the relation of the jinn to the Prophet, there are still somedetails that continue to elude scholars, such as how many times the Prophetencountered the jinn during his prophethood. Moreover, Muslim scholars havenever agreed on the names of the jinn who came to him, or on the places wherethese encounters took place.52 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en52]But the most important controversy involves the question of whether the Prophetactually saw the jinn, or only heard them. In reality, this question is linkedto the concept of revelation. The majority of Muslim scholars seem to believethat the Prophet did not see the jinn, contrary to what the popular accountsmention. A tradition of the Prophet indicates he was not aware of their presencewhen he recited the Qur’an—as documented by Muslim (d. 875), ibn Hanbal (d.855), and al-Tirmidhi (d. 892)—but that it was God who apprised him of theirwords and acts.53 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en53]In the Qur’an, it is clear it is God who informed the Prophet of what happenedin the invisible realm beyond human perception—ghayb. The first verse of theQur’anic chapter al-jinn opens with “It has been revealed to me” (Qur’an 72:1).The expression “it has been revealed to me” indicates the Prophet did not seethe jinn, for if he had, we would not have this expression. What we know throughdirect seeing cannot belong to the revelation.Other Muslim scholars hold the opinion the Prophet was able to see jinn anddemons because of the nature of his prophethood. These scholars maintainedprophets and saints could see that which the rest of humans are incapable ofseeing. In their view, seeing jinn is a miracle that belongs to prophethoodalone. They emphasized prophets could see all kinds of spiritual entities in theshapes in which God created them.54 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en54]An important question was also raised regarding the jinn listening to theQur’an: How do the jinn comprehend the recitation of the Qur’an? How do theytranslate its message into their own language(s) when “they returned to theirpeople as warners?” (Qur’an 46:29).While visiting the paradise of ‘afarit, the narrator of Risalat al-Ghufran (TheEpistle of Forgiveness) written by al-Ma‘arri (d. 1057) asks the jinni AbuHadrash about communication between humans and jinn, what is the language of thejinn, are they Arabs who do not know Greek, or Greeks who do not understandArabs? The jinni answers: “We are folk of clairvoyance and cleverness. We knowall human beings’ languages and beyond, and we have a language that men do notknow.”55 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en55]It should be mentioned here that seeing or hearing spiritual entities is asubject matter debated by other traditions as well. For example, Greekphilosophers discussed at length whether or not one could see or hear thedaemons. Socrates’ personal daemon was central to this consideration. Plutarch,for example, asserted Socrates often heard his daemon speak, but not once did heassert he saw him. Plutarch in a chapter entitled “On Socrates’ personal deity”discusses at length with friends and disciples of Socrates the instances inwhich this “deity” appeared to Socrates and how the philosopher interacted withit.56 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en56]Neo-Platonism, however, claimed seeing daemons is not impossible for humans. Onthis seminal aspect of the communication between the invisible realm of spiritsand the visible realm of humans, contemporary scholar of Greek culture GeorgLuck maintains, “The belief in the existence of daemons seems to have been anessential part of Neo-Platonism, but the ability to actually see one’s ownguardian spirit was a privilege granted to only a few. Those who, like Plotinus,were granted the gift, apparently encouraged their disciples to study hard, workon themselves, and achieve the spiritual progress that would lead them to ahigher level of awareness.”57 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en57]Scholars of classical Islam also raised the question of seeing the angels andhearing them. Can a prophet see his angel or only hear him? Did the ProphetMuhammad see or only hear the angel Gabriel? During the second and thirdcenturies of Islam, this debate was called “the externality” of the revelation,that is, Revelation as coming to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel, as inQur’an 26:19 and 2:97.In Qur’an 75:16–19, God addresses the Prophet, “Move not thy tongue with it tohasten it; Ours it is to gather it, and to recite it. So, when We recite it,follow thou its recitation. Then Ours it is to explain it.” The same meaningoccurs again in Qur’an 20:114: “And hasten not with the Qur’an ere itsrevelation is accomplished unto thee; and say, ‘O my Lord, increase me inknowledge.’” This verse was interpreted by the scholars to mean the Prophetheard Gabriel physically and, in his anxiousness to retain what was said,hurried to repeat it. It is not mentioned, however, that he saw the angel.Avicenna (d. 1037) considered the means of transmission of revelation from theangel to the Prophet as follows:Angels have real and absolute being, but also a being relative to humans. Theirreal being is in the transcendental realm, and is contacted only by the holyhuman spirits. When the two meet, the human’s both senses—internal andexternal—are attracted upwards, and the angel is presented to them in accordancewith the power of the man who sees the angel not in the absolute but in therelative form. He hears the latter’s speech as a voice, even though it isintrinsically a spiritual communication, wahi. Spiritual communication is theindication of the mind of the angel to the human spirit in a direct manner, andthis is the real “speech.” For speech is only that which brings home the meaningof the addresser’s mind (to the addressee’s mind) so that the later becomes likethe former.58 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en58]The communication that took place between the Prophet and the angel is not anordinary one. We cannot apply to it the rules that govern any ordinaryconversation between two ordinary humans. It takes place at the intersection oftwo realms: the manifest one and the invisible one. Both the relative and theabsolute intermingle for a very short lapse of time during which a message fromthe unseen is sent. It is at the origin a kind of telepathy the Prophet grasps,and is then conveyed to him through a voice he hears, as Avicenna mentions.As we have seen in this chapter, divination was then brought to a standstill,and the jinn ceased to steal news from heavens. Along with humans, believersamong the jinn embraced Islam, and shared with their humans’ co-religionists theRevelation. The Prophet himself treasured the jinn’s recognition of theRevelation.It is in this context the Qur’anic chapter “al-jinn” occupies a special place inthe heart of Islam, inasmuch as it asserts the submission of spiritual entities,the jinn, to God. This Qur’anic chapter is the prime example of how the “Word ofGod” is spread in a multiplicity of realms and is understood among intelligencesbeyond our human sphere. The Prophet mentioned its importance in these terms,“He who reads surat al-Jinn (the Qur’anic chapter of the jinn), his reward fromGod will be as large as if he had freed a number of slaves equal to the numberof jinn who believed in me as well as to the number of the jinn who disbelievedin me.”59 [Notes.xhtml#rch4en59]"},{"pageContent":"5Magic, Possession, Diseases, and the Jinn They carried Jiran al-‘Awd and put him back in a high place where the jinn play music. —JIRAN AL-‘AWD (pre-Islamic poet)Medieval Islamic literature on the jinn maintains Muslims had littleapprehension of the jinn who converted to Islam. They dreaded, however, theheretic jinn who rejected Islam. Muslims claimed these malevolent spirits couldattack them at any time and in any place. They considered them harmful, and theyendeavored to fend off their evil. Scholars, theologians, magicians, and healersworked together to record a list of legal procedures for Muslims to use toprotect themselves from the evil of these spirits.MAGIC, DISEASES, POSSESSION, AND HEALING IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EASTMerriam Webster’s Dictionary explains the term “magic” is derived from the Greek“magus,” which describes a sorcerer. The Greeks seem to have taken this wordfrom Persia where it referred to a member of the priestly class, which indicatesmagic was officially part of the religion of the ancient Persian Empire. Thispinpoints the intricate relationship between magic and religion. Magical beliefsand practices were a primary and acknowledged part of the daily life of thepeoples of the Near East. It was neither inferior to religion nor superior toit. People always believed unseen spiritual entities, such as gods, daemons,demons, or jinn, went into the bodies of humans to injure them, bring madnessupon them, or even kill them. They envisaged all diseases major and minor, fromplague to fever and even headache, to be brought about by male and female demonsagainst whom the magician battled as a fighter. In the religious and magicaltexts of the ancient Near East, people pictured the human body as the locus offights between good and bad spirits.EgyptMagic has always been omnipresent in Egypt, called “the mother of magicians” byClement of Alexandria (d. about 215). It was there one could find a wealthyvariety of amulets written or painted on gigantic temple walls as well as onpapyrus scrolls intended to act against all kinds of bites and stings of noxiouscreatures. Some gods were considered more protectors than others, such as thebull-man and the god dwarf Bes or Bisu, also known as a kind of savior deity.Bes was often pictured with an ugly face to drive away the evil forces thatresided in the body and were bringing about sickness or madness. It is thoughtthat Bes “fulfilled the same function as the hideous and sometimes obscenegargoyles found on many Christian churches.”1 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en1]Magicians were respected in ancient Egypt and often worked hand in hand withpriests and official doctors whose medical procedures were accompanied byincantations and hymns. It is believed the god Thoth, who was altogether amagician and a healer, wrote the majority of the books on magic in ancientEgypt.2 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en2] Many of these books were found in temples. Theyinclude spells, incantations to drive away the evil spirits, hymns, and ritualsto perform to exorcize the spirit dwelling in a human. It is worthy to note themagical parts of the surviving Egyptian papyri mix rational cures and spells.This led some contemporary scholars of ancient Egypt, such as Geraldine Pinch,to assert, “It is even doubtful whether there ever was a time in Egyptianhistory when medicine and magic were not complementary parts of a doctor’sskills.”3 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en3]Babylon and AssyriaMesopotamia left incredible riches of occult sciences that influenced the wholeancient Near East, especially Greece and Persia.4 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en4] It isbelieved that Persian magicians who settled in Mesopotamia combined theirclandestine traditions with the rites and formulas codified by the Chaldeansorcerers.In Babylon’s ancient civilizations, magic and healing were prominentlyrepresented in the incantation literature found in cuneiform and baked claytablets. This intriguing literature describes the offensive work of unseenspiritual entities against the human body. The magician in Babylon usedinstruments often compared to weapons; for each human illness there was adifferent weapon and a corresponding spirit. The exorcist was responsible forchasing away the spirits. It was vital to identify the god or the demon thatsent the illness and to call him or her by name, and to search for a matchinghealing. The demon Utukku, for example, was extremely vicious and, with severalfever-demons, assailed the throat; there were other demons associated with fevertoo, such as the demon Asag/Asakku, whose name is connected to fever in thepoetical enumerations of diseases. The demon Alu assaulted the chest; the demonGallu-the hand; Rabisu-the skin. To guard themselves from the diseases broughtby these classes of demons and to drive them away, Babylonians used incantationbowls as well as the ringing of bells.5 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en5] Some gods wereknown to heal the sick, if the patient prayed to them and promised to offer thema gift, such as the gods Ea and Marduk who were portrayed as coming to therescue of the diseased after receiving their sacrifices.6 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en6]In one early Assyrian incantation, the priest enumerated all the kinds ofdiseases evil spirits had imposed on a person: Unto the side of the wanderer have drawn nigh, Casting a woeful fever upon his body. A ban (manit) of evil hath settled on his body, An evil disease on his body they have cast, An evil plague hath settled on his body, Evil venom on his body they have cast, An evil curse hath settled on his body, Evil (and) sin on his body they have cast, Venom (and) wickedness have settled upon him.7 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en7]GreeceThe idea of illness, possession, and madness as coming from gods or daemons waswidespread in ancient Greece as well. Homer, in The Odyssey, speaks of thepenetration of a hostile daemon that obsessed the body in a miserable andexcruciating manner. Ulysses is depicted as assaulted by a fuming power.8[Notes.xhtml#rch5en8] During his hunt with the sons of Autolycus, he is woundedin the leg by a wild boar. His friends circle him, and dexterously tie up hiswound, and use an epaoide—specific charm—to stanch the flow of dark blood. Theytry to pacify the power stirring up the hemorrhage by binding his wound in amagical way.9 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en9] Greeks thought that even the plague wascaused by the intervention of evil spirits: “The disease visited by Apollo uponthe Acheans thus consists of a defiling object, a material reality ‘divinely’super-induced upon the body of the sufferer, in short a physical stain. Therelationship between this conception of the disease state and the idea of themagical intrusion of a foreign and harmful object cannot be denied.”10[Notes.xhtml#rch5en10]The Greeks took many healing procedures from Mesopotamians, Chaldeans, andEgyptians. It is maintained that naturalist philosopher Democritus (d. 370 BCE),best known for his atomic theory, traveled to Mesopotamia where he was exposedto the corpus accumulated by the priests of Babylon. It is thought Democritusprocured some elements of this inconsistent material, especially regardingproperties of plants and minerals, and maybe some experiments of physics. Towardthe end of the Alexandrine period, many Babylonian books on magic were alreadytranslated into Greek.Philosopher Pythagoras of Samos (b. 569 BCE), surnamed the great healer, alsotraveled to Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and India where he learned magic; thenhe came back to Samos, founded his own school, and taught his disciples how toapply magic and incantations in their cures. It is believed Pythagoras was ableby his magical skills to beckon to animals and birds, and to foresee the future.The Greeks strongly believed gods or daemons were the cause of diseases,possession, and madness. “Most of the gods specified by professional purifiershad special associations with disease, especially skin disease, and madness.”11[Notes.xhtml#rch5en11]Pre-Islamic ArabiaThe Arabs before Islam had similar beliefs to their neighbors regarding magic,spirits, and healing. Like them, they were preoccupied with how to ward offdisease and ill fortune. They believed, for example, like the Greeks, the plagueis brought upon humans by spiritual entities. They described it as “the spearsof the jinn.”12 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en12] Fear of the plague led them to somestrange and intriguing behaviors. “They would imitate the braying of a donkeybefore entering a village, for fear that the jinn would attack them. Some ofthem would even hang on them the heel of a rabbit, to protect themselves.”13[Notes.xhtml#rch5en13]Pre-Islamic Arabs believed evil jinn bring madness upon people as well. In fact,the term majnun (possessed/mad/insane in Arabic) literally means “to bepossessed by a jinni.” The terms jinn and majnun both are derived from the samelinguistic root j-n-n.How do the jinn bring madness upon a person? In some narratives from pre-Islam,one can find a relationship between the sounds uttered by the jinn and the lossof reason. The jinn avenge their dead by inflicting upon humans strange sounds,resembling the sirens’ songs, which bewitch sailors. The sounds produced by thejinn could be similar to the pounding of a drum, the buzzing of certain flies, atwitter, or simply a loud voice coming from an invisible source the Arabs calledhatif (a call from the unseen).14 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en14] Sometimes, the jinnsimulate the sounds of the winds in the sands, or a thin murmur. This jinn’smusic is also called ‘azif.15 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en15]The music of the jinn by which they possess humans has been immortalized by thepoets of pre-Islam, as in this verse of Jiran al-‘Awd (his exact date of birthor death is unknown) where he described himself carried away by the jinn: “Theycarried Jiran al-‘Awd and put him back in a high place where the jinn playmusic.”16 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en16] Another anonymous poet of pre-Islam chanted thefollowing verse: “You hear in it the jinn saying zizi zima.”17[Notes.xhtml#rch5en17]The Arabs of pre-Islam invented a whole set of exorcism procedures to protectthemselves from the evil actions of the jinn on their bodies and minds, such asthe use of beads, incense, bones, salt, and charms written in Arabic, Hebrew,and Syriac, or the hanging around their necks of a dead animal’s teeth such as afox or a cat to frighten the jinn, and keep them away.18 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en18]Others would give their children names they thought could scare off the jinn,especially names of animals. Pre-Islamic Arabs bonded with animals to acquirestrength against evil jinn. They imagined the power of animals would terrifythese evil spirits. The idea of getting help from animals seems, however,paradoxical at first glance. As shall be seen in the following chapter of thisbook, pre-Islamic Arabs believed the jinn sometimes take the shape of animals tohide their identity from humans. One wonders then how is it possible toascertain an evil jinni is not dwelling in one of these animals. One could readthis behavior, though, as the pre-Islamic Arabs wanting to utilize the “animalpower” before the jinn did. In any case, it is interesting to see how bothhumans and jinn exploit the animal strength and mystery to gain power. Theanimal realm seems to mediate in a way between the human realm and theintermediary realm of the jinn.However, not all pre-Islamic Arabs were afraid of the jinn. Many of thembefriended them, as we have already seen, and even sought their aid. Theybelieved the jinn do not respond to the person calling them unless he/shebecomes wild and dwells in barren and ruined places, and unless this personquits the society of humans.19 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en19]DEFINING “ISLAMIC” MAGICThrough Arab conquests, Islam assimilated many magical procedures from thereligions of the conquered peoples. The Fihrist (catalogue) of the compilerMuhammad ibn Ishaq ibn al-Nadim (d. 849) mentions the old sources such as Greek,Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Chaldean, and Hindu, which inspired Muslim magic. Heindicates Arabs translated the Indian books on magic, as well as those inChinese and Turkish. He also acknowledges Arabs borrowed from Persians andJews.20 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en20] Islam was not in fact different from otherreligions that appropriated elements from the preceding religions. There is nototally autonomous religion, independent of what occurred before it, as Dutchhistorian of religion and Christian theologian Gerardus van der Leeuw (d. 1950)maintains: “Every religion, therefore, has its own previous history and is to acertain extent a ‘syncretism.’ Then comes the time when, from being a summation,it becomes a whole and obeys its own laws.”21 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en21]The conviction the jinn somehow could intervene in Muslims’ lives is still partof their general belief in the simultaneous existence of the invisible and thevisible realms. In medieval times, Muslims thought jinn could enter theirhouses, run in the streets, and even make their way into food and drink. Theyclaimed they have felt their presence; that is why some Muslims searched forways to neutralize them through magic. It is reported the Prophet Muhammadhimself once said, “Cover your utensils and tie your water skins, and close yourdoor and keep your children close to you at night, as the jinn come out at thattime and snatch things away.”22 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en22]At the time of the Prophet, there were some nushrahs (a kind of charm, some saya certain kind of incantation used to chase away the evil of heretic jinn) knownas non-Arabic, such as the nushra using the Hebrew language. People flocked tothe Jews who would put together magical spells for them. Muhammad forbade theuse of incantations containing Hebrew or even Syriac words as well as any spellnot in agreement with the teachings of Islam.23 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en23] What madeMuslims strongly reckon evil could intrude in their lives was the accounttelling Muhammad himself was once bewitched. The complete story is told in theprophetic tradition:‘A’isha [the Prophet’s wife] recounted magic was worked on the Prophet so hebegan to imagine he was doing an action which he was not actually doing. One dayhe appealed to God for a long period and then said: “I feel that God hasinspired me as to how to heal myself. Two persons came to me (in my dream) andsat, one by my head and the other by my feet. One of them asked the other: ‘Whatis the illness of this man?’ The other replied: ‘Magic was worked on him.’ Thefirst asked: ‘Who has bewitched him?’ The other replied: ‘Labid ibn al-‘awwam.’The first one asked: ‘What material has he used?’ The other replied: ‘A comb,the hair gathered on it, and the outer skin of the pollen of the maledate-palm.’ The first asked: ‘Where is that?’ The other replied: ‘It is in thewell of Dharwan.’” So the Prophet went to the well and then came back and saidto me: “Its date-palms [the date-palms near the well] resemble the heads of thedevils.” I asked: “Did you remove these things with which the magic was worked?”He said: “No, for I have been cured by God, and I am afraid that this action mayspread evil amongst the people.” Later on, the well was filled up with earth.24[Notes.xhtml#rch5en24]The Prophet in this story not only does not dwell on details when asked aboutthe well and refuses to bring up from it the material that bewitched him, but healso orders the well with its contents be “filled up with earth,” buriedforever, as if not to leave any trace or any witness of this act of bewitching.By doing so, he certainly doesn’t want to leave any magical material someonefrom the community might use. But beyond that, the Prophet is also implicitlyasking people to take for granted what he told them without any manifest proof.The prophetic tradition is not the only source that points to the act ofbewitching through knots. The Qur’an itself brings up this prominent act ofsorcery. Indeed, the act of tying or binding knots is stated in Qur’an 113:3*:“And I seek refuge from the chanters over the knots.”In the opinion of many Qur’an commentators, chapter 113 of the Qur’an refers tothe practice of witches and sorcerers who tied a string into a number of knotswhile blowing or puffing upon them, and muttering magical incantations. This actof tying and binding is not the invention of Islam, but rather is found in manytexts of the ancient Near East. As previously mentioned, Islam, like mostreligions, acknowledges borrowings from preceding religions.25[Notes.xhtml#rch5en25] The ancient Greeks, for example, believed undoing knotson board a ship could bring up the wind. And in the Roman Empire, the poetVirgil (b. 70 BCE), who was considered in medieval times a kind of magician andwhose Aeneid was used for divination, also sang of the impact of knots tobewitch someone: “Knot, Amaryllis, tie! Of colors three/Then say, ‘These bonds Iknit for Venus be.’”26 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en26]In the ancient Babylonian religion, prayers were offered to Shamash, the god ofthe sun, to liberate the ensnared ones. And in Enuma Elish, the Babylonian epicof Creation, the god Marduk fights the ferocious Tiamat who was plotting thegods’ destruction. He finally subdues her and her helpers with a net; “In thenet they were caught and in the snare they sat down. They received punishmentfrom him, they were held in bondage.”27 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en27]The sorcerer’s knots hold back or “bind” the person he would like to harm.Knotting fetters the other in its snares, and ties or fixes him in a specificstate. Evil comes from the sorcerer’s concentration on this person while he/sheis tying his/her threads as well as from the power of the ritual and theincantations that accompany it, be it chanting or puffing. Exorcism could be theliteral and spiritual act of extracting the victim from the shackles of thisdevilish bond by untying or loosening the sorcerer’s knots.The Vedic texts of Ancient India illustrate it is not sorcerers who devilishlytie humans, but rather gods, such as Varuna, Indra, Yama, and Vritra, etc.,which points to the multiple meanings of knotting in Hinduism. It is a mixtureof religion and magic. During this era, gods had in them some demonicattributes, as Mircea Eliade elucidates, “But on the one hand, here we oftenhave to do with religious beings who are ambivalent (Tvashtri, Maruts) in thesense that a demonic element coexists in them with the divine elements; and, onthe other hand, the attribute ‘magician’ is not specific, but is only attachedto the divine personalities as an additional honor.”28 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en28]Despite assimilations and appropriations from the ancient religious traditionsof the Near East, Islam distinguished itself by emphasizing the differencebetween magic and sorcery. Magic is considered a divine gift that can healsickness and possession in the name of God, while sorcery resorts to the evil ofheretic jinn and demons, and is condemned by Islam. Ibn al-Nadim elucidates thedifference between Islamic magic and sorcery as follows:The exorcists, who pretend to observe the sacred laws, claim that this “power”is because of obedience to God . . . Thus invocation is addressed to Him, andoaths by the spirits and devils are by His help, with the abandoning of lustsand by consequence of religious practices. Moreover, [they claim] the jinn andthe devils obey them, either because of obedience to God, may His name bemagnified, or on account of [their making] oaths by Him, or else for fear ofHim, uplifted and glorious is He. The sorcerers assert that they enslave thedevils by offerings and prohibitive acts. They maintain the devils are pleasedby the committing of acts which are forbidden and which God, may His name bemagnified, has prohibited.29 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en29]Ibn al-Nadim adds further in the same passage, “The sorcerers declare that theybind the devils by sacrifices and prohibitive acts. They assert that the devilsare satisfied by the committing of such acts that God has prohibited, may Hisname be sanctified.”30 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en30]HEALING TECHNIQUES IN CLASSICAL ISLAMThe Qur’an as Healing EnergyAlthough God as a healer is not one of the 99 Divine Names, He is mentioned sixtimes in the Qur’an as such. Moreover, the Holy text itself is represented ashaving a therapeutic value as in Qur’an 17:82, “And we cause to descend of theQur’an what is a healing and a mercy to the believers.” In Qur’an 26:80, God issaid to cure ailments: “and, whenever I am sick, He heals me.” One prophetictradition mentions, “The best medicines are: honey and the Qur’an.”31[Notes.xhtml#rch5en31]Since its advent, Islam made it clear nothing other than the Words of God, orhis names, or the Arabic letters with which the Qur’an was conveyed could bebrought into a spell, a charm, an incantation, or the like and Muslimsendeavored to comply with the rules. Theologians, Qur’an commentators, and Sufisstrived to use the Qur’anic text in ingenious ways, as to write down the sixverses that mention healing in the Qur’an on a piece of paper, erase them in acup full of water, and then drink the contents. They claimed this would heal thedrinker from his sickness.32 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en32]“Drinking” the Words of God seems to involve the whole body in the process ofchange. This is viewed as an almost alchemical process where the swallowing ofthis liquid transmutes the sick person into a new healed being.Similar beliefs were held by different traditions across the ancient Near East.It is reported that a certain pious Egyptian by the name of Naneferkaptah heardthat the god Thoth had written books of magic with his own hand. So he undertooka voyage to find it. Once in possession of the book, Naneferkaptah, “a goodscribe and very wise man, had a sheet of new papyrus brought to him. He wrote onit every word that was in the book before him. He soaked it in beer, then hedissolved it in water. When he knew it had dissolved, he drank it and knew whathad been in it.”33 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en33]In this last example, drinking the sacred text is not so much for purposes ofhealing but rather for knowledge. It assumes knowledge is not located in themind alone, but circulates throughout the whole body which digests it in its ownway. As Garth Fowden, contemporary scholar of Greek and Roman Antiquity,mentions, “This practice gave special point to the Gnostic topos of ‘drinkingdown knowledge.’”34 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en34]In the Old Testament, one also finds this procedure of “drinking” written sacredwords, but in a different context. If the ancient Israelites, for example,wanted to try a woman accused of adultery, they would make her drink water intowhich a written curse had been dissolved, then the woman swore an oath ofinnocence or “made a solemn declaration of innocence” (Numbers 5:16–31). If sheswore falsely, the curse in the water would convict her through a physicalmanifestation, making her infertile:The priest is to have the woman stand at my altar, where he will pour sacredwater into a clay jar and stir in some dust from the floor of the sacred tent.Next, he will remove her veil, then hand her the barley offering, and say, “Ifyou have been faithful to your husband, this water won’t harm you. But if youhave been unfaithful, it will bring down the Lord’s curse—you will never be ableto give birth to a child, and everyone will curse your name.”Then the woman will answer, “If I am guilty, let it happen just as you say.”The priest will write these curses on special paper and wash them off into thebitter water, so that when the woman drinks this water, the curses will enterher body. He will take the barley offering from her and lift it up in dedicationto me, the Lord. Then he will place it on my altar and burn part of it as asacrifice. After that, the woman must drink the bitter water. If the woman hasbeen unfaithful, the water will immediately make her unable to have children,and she will be a curse among her people. But if she is innocent, her body willnot be harmed, and she will still be able to have children.This is the ceremony that must take place at my altar when a husband suspectshis wife has been unfaithful. The priest must have the woman stand in mypresence and carefully follow these instructions. If the husband is wrong, hewill not be punished; but if his wife is guilty, she will be punished.35[Notes.xhtml#rch5en35]“Drinking the Qur’an” has never replaced reciting it for protection from evil.In medieval times, just as today, Muslims believe the recitation of Qur’an2:255, called “the Verse of the Throne,” could expel evil jinn. They recite itto protect themselves and entrust themselves to God’s care. In addition to “theverse of the Throne,” there are many other verses believed to protect from eviljinn. First are the verses of protection or safeguard, ayat al-hifz, usuallyused as talismans. Some of these verses are Qur’an 12:64, 13:11, 3:7, 33:3,33:48, 4:81, and 15:17. Second is the Qur’anic chapter entitled Yasin, surnamedthe heart of the Book, and considered to be of capital importance for all kindsof diseases. Third, the opening chapter of the Qur’an, al-fatihah, as well asthe basmalah: bism-il-lahi al-rahman al-rahim (In the Name of God, the Merciful,the Compassionate) Muslims recite in the event of any distress, sickness, or toprotect themselves from evil jinn. Finally, the two Qur’anic chapters 113 and114 of refuge, called al-mu‘awwidhatan, are of particular value for protectingthe believers from evil jinn and demons.Qur’anic verses were sometimes written on amulets, which were conserved in aleather case, and worn around the neck or on the body as another way to beprotected from evil jinn. Occasionally, it was not enough to carry the Qur’anicverses in amulets. Some authors of popular medicine advised even writing theverses directly on the body of the possessed or the diseased, especially on thepatient’s palms and his forehead. The changes claimed to have taken place, as weare told in these texts of Islamic magic, are a result of the fervent belief ofthe faithful in the strength of the divine word, which is thought to beinimitable.The power of the Holy text also comes from the belief the earthly Qur’an is, forMuslims, a copy of the Divine Qur’an that is preserved since eternity in heavenas in Qur’an 85:22. Henceforth, reciting it, writing it, wearing it, or drinkingit is an unswerving act of participation in the Divine source itself. One couldsay the believer at that time was literally “living” in the Qur’an to the pointhe became one with it. In fact, the Qur’anic verses themselves were consideredliving beings. Scholars of classical Islam maintained they would act aswitnesses on behalf of humans on the Day of Judgment.The Divine Names and the Protection from EvilBesides the Qur’an, it was common practice in medieval times to recite and writedown the Most Beautiful Names of God to be protected from wicked jinn. It alsowas thought the repetition of the Mystical Divine Name, ism allah al-’a‘zam (theGreatest Name of God), which is above all the others, could heal the personpossessed by jinn. Among all his names, Allah is the most perfect. It iscomposed of four Arabic letters, which is believed to correspond to the fourelements, the four cardinal points, the four seasons. We are reminded here ofthe supreme oath of the Pythagorean philosophical community: “By him who gavethe fourness to our soul.”In turn, folk Islam brings into play the greatest name of God to defeat sorcery.In the “Porter and the Three Ladies” from The Nights, the pious Muslim princessfights a sorcerer jinni who transformed a man into an ape. She succeeds after anatrocious struggle and the unremitting recitation of the greatest name of God tobring back the ape to his original human form. However, at the end of thebattle, both princess and jinni die, worn out by the ruthlessness of the attacksand the efforts wielded to achieve their respective goals: “The speaker was theprincess who had burnt the ifrit, and he was become a heap of ashes. Then shecame to us and said: ‘reach me a cup of water.’ They brought it to her, and shespoke over it words we understood not, and sprinkling me with it cried, ‘Byvirtue of the Truth, and by the most Great Name of God, I charge thee to returnto thy former shape.’ And behold, I shook, and became a man as before, save thatI had utterly lost an eye.”36 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en36]Some authors found it indispensable to indicate which names of God should berecited to dispel the wicked jinn, and in which sequence, as did al-Suyuti (d.1505). He advises the recitation of the following Divine Names in this order:“Oh God, the Vigilant, the Preserver, the Merciful. Oh God, the Living, theGentle, the Great, the Gracious, the Generous. Oh God, the Living, theEverlasting, the Steadfast by whom one gains freedom from his enemies.”37[Notes.xhtml#rch5en37]Others claimed it was not enough to recite or write down the names of God. Theycame up with resourceful procedures to drive away the malevolent spirits. Inthis context, Ahmad ibn ‘Ali al-Buni (d. 1225), a prominent mathematician, wroteon the esoteric denomination of Arabic letters in his magnum opus, shamsal-ma‘arif. Al-Buni maintained one could detain an evil jinni or even burn himby writing the Sufi invocation of God huwa (He) on a blue cloth and by incitingthe jinni to smell it.38 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en38]The author here assumes the jinni is embodying a visible shape in front of thehuman and he is close enough to sniff the cloth on which the Divine Name iswritten. Moreover, we are not told why the author suggests the use of a bluecloth, over a red or green one, nor why the act of smelling the cloth would burnthe evil jinni.39 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en39]The Magical Power of Arabic LettersMedieval Islamic magic also resorted to Arabic letters for chasing away the jinnbelieved to dwell in a human body. Arabic letters were written disconnected inmost talismans and amulets, which is thought to increase their potency becauseeach separate letter manifests its intrinsic force, and behaves as a unique andliving field of energy. Al-Buni maintained Arabic letters have their kingdoms,their traditions, and their secrets. Each letter has its own servants and itsown ruler. He deemed them “a nation among nations.”40 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en40] Healleged one should not use them in magic if he/she is not aware they are likeliving beings. Each letter of the Arabic script has its particular power derivedfrom being linked to one of the four elements, to a certain number, to heavens,or to the lower world, and to either light or darkness. The letters of light,for example, produce love and unity, while the letters of darkness generatehatred and war. Hence, each letter is used for a specific disease or a specificrelation with the jinn. Muslim alchemists and magicians indicated in medievaltimes the letter aleph, for example, is connected to the beginnings of creation.Its supremacy has no equal because its origin is in the Divine Name itself.41[Notes.xhtml#rch5en41]Ibn ‘Arabi attributed an even greater role to the Arabic letters because heconsidered them not only a nation among other nations, but also “the imams[leaders] of words,”42 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en42] which points to their role asguides to humans in the realm of knowledge and spiritual awakening. Hedistributed them on four levels. The first level is the Divine one, composed ofletters such as aleph and lam. The second level is the human one to which belongletters such as nun, sad, and dad. The third level is that of the jinn to whichbelong letters such as ayn, ghayn, sin, shin, and qaf. Finally, the fourth levelis that of angelic letters.43 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en43] Ibn ‘Arabi also claimedeach letter has two meanings because it could manifest itself either in thevisible or invisible realm.44 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en44]Moreover, a number of Arabic letters open some Qur’anic chapters, and are thusconsidered of particular sacredness. There is no consensus among scholars on theexact meaning of these separate letters. Some highlight the numeric values ofthese letters and stress their esoteric meaning, while others simply maintainthey are an intrinsic part of the Revelation that is mysterious, inimitable, andwondrous. Some Muslims believed these opening letters have more power thanothers, and have the ability to chase away evil jinn, in particular the qaf. Itis told that al-Shibli (d. 1368) visited once a man who was possessed by an eviljinni, so al-Shibli wrote a letter qaf on the possessed man’s palm, then drewseven circles around it. He then asked the possessed to lick it. Al-Shibliclaims the man was instantly healed.45 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en45]One can surmise the choice of the letter qaf over other letters appears tospring from its being the first letter in the following Divine Names: al-Qadir(the all-powerful), al Qahhar (the omnipotent), al-Qawiyy (the mighty),al-Qayyum (the everlasting), which express the omnipotence of God over hiscreation, including evil jinn.Like al-Shibli, al-Buni reiterates the power of the letter qaf regarding chasingaway evil jinn. He invites his disciples to do the following: “Write the letterqaf and place it in half a circle. Sit in this semi circle where no flying ordiving jinn can ever harm you.”46 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en46] It was often assertedthe letter qaf also refers to qalb (heart), to the Holy Book, al-Qur’an, or toqalam (the Pen). All of these words bear an undeniable symbolic meaning.47[Notes.xhtml#rch5en47]Both al-Shibli and al-Buni draw the letter qaf in a circle or semi-circle. In apreceding chapter, al-Gilani (d. 1166) also asked a person—who was looking forhis abducted daughter—to sit in a circle when the jinn pass by him to protecthim. Muhammad himself commanded one of his companions to stay within the limitsof a circle as well, while he went and recited the Qur’an to some jinn.48[Notes.xhtml#rch5en48]The notion of circles as sacred symbols of eternity is spread across traditions.The Divine itself has been compared to a circle in the words of HermesTrismegistus, “God is a circle whose center is everywhere and circumference isnowhere.”49 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en49] It is in this spirit circles were used inclassical Islam; they were considered a field of holy energy that could save theperson sitting within its boundaries from any harm.POSSESSION, EPILEPSY, AND HEALINGThe Qur’an mentions the word majnun eleven times in relation to madness andepilepsy. In seven instances, it refers to the Prophet directly. Muhammad’sopponents believed he was jinn-possessed, or epileptic, and a jinni wasdictating to him the words. In three instances, God replies to theseaccusations.50 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en50]The Prophet’s tradition includes stories regarding possession and epilepsy.Although the Prophet is not mentioned in the Qur’an as an exorcist, one finds adifferent portrait in the prophetic tradition, where he exercises fully hishealer’s powers. For example, there is a story of a woman who brought herepileptic son to him: he opened his mouth, and puffed three times into itreciting the following: “In the Name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful, goaway enemy of God for I am the Servant of God!” He told the woman to bring theboy after a while. She returned and told the Prophet he was completely healed.51[Notes.xhtml#rch5en51]The prophetic tradition mentions that often the Prophet would repeat the wordscited above, especially: “Depart, enemy of God, I am His Messenger.” It isalleged the evil spirit would leave the person instantly.52[Notes.xhtml#rch5en52]Here, Muhammad just commands the evil spirit to leave the body of thepossessed—no persuasion of any kind—simply the injunction of a prophet connectedto the “invisible” world. Other accounts portray sheikhs as entering intodialogue with the evil spirit. They argue with it, and they claim that theinvisible entity talks back as in this story told by al-Jawziyyah (d. 1350) inhis book, The Medicine of the Prophet, where he relates the following procedureof exorcism performed by a sheikh:The sheikh told me that he once recited this verse [verse of the Throne, Qur’an2:255] into the ear of an epileptic, and the spirit said: “Yes.” And its voicereached him. He said: “So I took a stick to hit, and I beat the patient with iton the veins of his neck until my hands grew tired from the beating. The peoplepresent had no doubt that he would die from the blows. During this beating thespirit said: ‘I love him.’ So I said to it: ‘He does not love you.’ Then itsaid: ‘I wish to accompany him.’ I replied: ‘He does not want your company.’ Itsaid then, ‘I will leave him out of respect for you.’ I replied: ‘No, rather inobedience to God and his Messenger.’ And it said: ‘I am departing from him.’Then, the epileptic sat up, looked around him, right and left, and asked: ‘Whatbrought me to the sheikh?’”53 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en53]It is possible to find parallel beliefs in possession by evil spirits in otherreligions, as in Taoism, for example. Huston Smith, contemporary historian ofreligion, evokes a similar case of possession to the one depicted by ibnal-Qayyim. It is an eyewitness account of a man possessed by an evil spirit anda Taoist priest trying to exorcise him. “The energumen, a rather emaciated manof about twenty-five, lay on an iron bedstead on a rush mat. He was very paleand his look was a wild, roving look in his fevered eyes. The Taoist priest,holding an elongated ivory tablet held ceremonially in both hands in front ofhis chest, approached the bed slowly. There was a visible transformation on theenergumen’s face. His eyes were filled with malice as he watched the priest’smeasured advance with a sly cunning and hatred. Suddenly he gave a bestial whoopand jumped up in his bed, the four attendants rushing to hold him.”54[Notes.xhtml#rch5en54]Like the sheikh in the story of ibn al-Qayyim, the Taoist priest cured thepossessed man who finally woke up to reality and recognized his family. He wasindeed present yet absent in a realm between the tangible and the intangible,which made everything around him look eerie, yet not totally unfamiliar. In bothaccounts, there seems to be a violent interaction between the two realms of theinvisible (the evil spirit thought to hide in the body) and the manifest (thepossessed human who seems to have lost his free will). The evil spirit playstricks until he exits the human body. Until the last minute, he attempts to hidein the man. The nature of evil is believed to endlessly play with humans as acat does with a mouse. Theologians warned Muslims to exercise caution, for eviljinn are capable of luring them time and again. It is in this context that ibnTaymiyah (d. 1328) alerted people to the fact jinn could make them believe theydeparted from the body they possessed, while in reality they lie. Ibn Taymiyahmaintained jinn often imitate human voices; for example if a human calls afriend to help him, the jinni would simulate the voice of this friend andmislead the human.55 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en55] Again, it was advised to recite “theverse of the Throne” (Qur’an 2:255) in the ear of the possessed if one wanted toswiftly deliver this person from evil jinn.Some people in classical Islam also believed one could become either sick orpossessed if he/she stays a long time at a threshold. They claimed thresholds ingeneral are somehow connected to jinn, and it would be better not to linger inthese particular locales. They alleged, if someone pours water over thethreshold of a house, or if a parent beats a child at this place, both couldbecome mad or sick.56 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en56]One wonders why people linked the jinn to the threshold. What is specific abouta threshold? “As a boundary symbol it is the line of meeting of the natural andsupernatural.”57 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en57] Therefore, one could surmise if onelingers there, one almost risks stumbling into the other side, into theinvisible realm where jinn lurk. We often see in popular Islam the jinn guardjealously their domains and don’t welcome humans who trespass their boundaries.The symbols embedded in a threshold seem to reflect the human anxiety of leavingthe granted for the conjectural. As for pouring water over a threshold, peoplethought it could be dangerous because they believed water might mix in its flowimaginal and physical realms, and hence, brings forth the jinn.Beating a child on a threshold was seen as an act of exorcism in manytraditions. Beating, flogging, or whipping were used as means to cast away theevil spirits. This act might trigger the manifestation of evil jinn and,consequently, bring forward the madness of both parent and child at the sight ofthese evil entities.58 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en58]Frontiers like thresholds where imaginal and terrestrial realms mightinterpenetrate are located not only in space but also in time. If thresholdswere viewed in classical Islam as locales where the intermediary realm mightsurface, sunrises were looked upon by fairies as stations in time when thesespirits pass by humans without the latter noticing them.In a story collected by Irish poet, W. B. Yeats (d. 1939), entitled “PaddyCorcoran’s Wife,” we are told a woman fell sick, until one day, after sevenyears of continuous sickness, a fairy visited her while she was lying in bed andinformed her the fairies caused her sickness because she threw her trash atsunrise each day, exactly when the fairies were passing by her door. Theyrequested she do it at different times and they would heal her; she obeyed, andwas healed.59 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en59]It is worthy to note the fairies impose their rule on the sick woman rather thanchanging their time of passage. It might be that, for these spirits, passing byhuman habitations at sunrise is a kind of ritual not up for discussion. Sunriseis seen in old Irish mythology as “the eye of the day.” The same word sul refersto eye and sun in Gaelic language.60 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en60]CONCLUSIONFinding ways to ward off evil jinn thought to cause madness, possession, orepilepsy was not considered superstitious by Muslims in medieval times. Itdidn’t mean in any sense to be less Muslim because these procedures wereinspired from Islam and sanctioned by Muslim theologians. All these kinds ofspiritual healing—sometimes called “Islamic magic”—were indeed inspired fromcertain verses of the Qur’an, the Most Beautiful Names of God, and the Arabicalphabet by which the Word of God was revealed to Muhammad.In classical Islam, both orthodox religion and spiritual healing considered thehuman being as the microcosm and the universe as the macrocosm. Both spoke ofthe constant interaction and resemblances between macrocosm and microcosm. Bothstressed everything bears the sign of the Creator, and should be dealt with assuch. Muslim theologians asserted the exorcist needed to respect certainreligious conditions for his “help” to act. From their writings, one concludesthe exorcist is almost a kind of saint who must lead a life of perfect piety insolitude and abstinence, and totally devoted to prayers and meditations.Classical Islam didn’t consider the exorcist a Promethean man working againstthe religion, but rather a pontifical man whose success was bestowed upon him byno one else but God.Furthermore, warding off evil jinn was not an act of rejection of medicine.Islamic magic has never hampered Muslims from probing scientific cures for sickand epileptic people. Because medicine was engrained in the religion itself, itcouldn’t get in the way of scientific progress. The prophetic tradition ordersMuslims, “Take medicine, o servants of God. For every illness He gavemedicine.”61 [Notes.xhtml#rch5en61] Classical Islam stressed that Muslims shouldstrive to find cures for diseases. Islamic physicians built up a huge andintricate medical corpus. This all-embracing literature was not confined tostrict medical knowledge in the sense that modern medical literature is. Rather,it was blended with philosophy, natural science, mathematics, astrology,alchemy, biology, spirit healers, charms, and religion. In this sense, it waswhat we call today “interdisciplinary.” In addition, there were abundant bookson al-tibb al-ruhi (spiritual medicine), like the books written by Zakariyaal-Razi (d. 923) and ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (d. 1350) in which they discussedissues dealing with moods and emotions affecting the body as well as theinfluence of the spiritual life on the physical one. Physicians were themselvesan embodiment of this synthesis. They were equally interested in issues ofmedical progress and in mysticism. Avicenna (d. 1037) was one of their mostinventive and prominent physicians who wrote medical treatises as well asmystical allegories. He was altogether a mathematician, a physician, a poet, anastronomer, and a mystic. He was especially interested in the effect of the mindon the body, and wrote a great deal on psychology as well.Engrossed by Islamic teachings, “Islamic magic” and medicine worked hand inhand. Illness was perceived as a discordance, a disharmony between man, nature,and the intermediary realm. Classical Islam strived to create concord betweennature and culture, being and thought, rather than seeing things through thelenses of a dualism based on the opposition of sacred versus profane.Still today, it is difficult for many westerners to comprehend how classicalIslam blended in religion, medicine, and spiritual healing. Most of the Weststill views the progress of humanity as evolving from magic to religion and,finally, to science in spite of the assertion of many contemporaryanthropologists who reject the ideas of their predecessors and maintain theydon’t see this linear progress in every culture they study.62[Notes.xhtml#rch5en62]"},{"pageContent":"6Jinn in Animal Shapes The jinn are of three kinds: one has wings and flies, serpents and dogs are another, and the third keeps roaming. —Prophetic tradition1 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en1]Humans seem always to have spiritualized animals, and keenly associated thespiritual realm with the animal one. This correlation might have its origin inthe enduring human belief animals are mysterious beings, somehow related to theinvisible domain. People believe animals could feel the approach of disasters;for example, they sense the approach of a storm, an earthquake, or a flood.Scientists nowadays, like contemporary American biologist Rupert Sheldrake,suppose both wild and domesticated animals have a kind of sixth sense regardingimpending natural catastrophes. Sheldrake maintains, “premonitions occur amongmany species of animals. They are natural, not supernatural.”2[Notes.xhtml#rch6en2] He seems to think those animals that have a sharper senseof premonition than others are better privileged by biological choice. In thissense, animals are conscious beings, and not mere automata, as Cartesians wouldhave it.In general, animals seem to strongly interact with humans, nature, and allthings in the universe. It is to this “animal energy” Eliade (d. 1986) alludeswhen he writes, “Animal language is only a variant of spiritual language.”3[Notes.xhtml#rch6en3] Eliade’s assertion opens the door to all kinds ofspeculations regarding the relationships between spirits and animals. It alsohints at the fact animals make us discover a different consciousness, and returnus to the rhythms of nature, not intellectually, but rather intuitively.SPIRITS IN ANIMALS FORMS ACROSS TRADITIONSThe great ancient civilizations presented a vision of the world in which naturaland supernatural were constantly combined. The delineations between gods,demons, spirits, and animals were not always very clear—wild animals were oftenthought of as demons, or vaguely as “spirits.” Gods were represented as takingtheir energy from specific animals, which made them sacred.In Egypt, for example, almost all Egyptian gods were associated with certainanimal aspects, and some gods were never represented except with the head oftheir appropriate animal, although their bodies were human. The scorpion-goddessSerqet, or Selqet, was associated with the powers of an evil spirit in some ofher aspects. Horus, the sky god, had the head of a hawk and the body of a man.Anubis, the god of mummies who guided the souls of the dead into the underworld,was often represented as a man with the head of a jackal.Some Egyptologists, such as E. A. Wallis Budge (d. 1934), firmly believed, “TheEgyptians developed the idea that individual animals were the abodes of thegods, and they believed that certain deities were incarnate in them.”4[Notes.xhtml#rch6en4]However, this opinion is exaggerated. It is true the ancient Egyptians worshipedat an early stage some animals, or at least considered them sacred, like the catat Bubastis, the wolf Ophois who was a god of war, and the Ibis Thoth who was agod of knowledge. However, Thoth was also identified with the baboon. When onecarefully surveys the Egyptian myths, one notices gods were not becominganimals, or at least dwelling in the bodies of animals. Throughout Egyptianhistory, we see gods always accompanied by animals, even when their heads werethose of animals.The Babylonian pantheon, parallel to the Egyptian one in time, was one of therichest in gods and demons having animal forms. Thus, the demon Gallu was oftenportrayed in the form of a bull, while Alu was represented in a composite form,half human and half animal. The demon Pazuzu was represented as a five-footedmonster, half bird, half lion and scorpion. The demon Mukil-Resh-Lemutti had thehead of a bird, but the feet and hands of a human. The demon Samanum had thehead of a lion, the claws of an eagle, and the tail of a crayfish. The demonLamastu had the head of a woman who holds a serpent in each hand, while a dogand a pig are suckling at her breasts.Besides demons in the Babylonian religion, there were the good genies—protectorsof humans—who also took on animal forms, especially that of huge bulls andlions.5 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en5] These good genies sat at the entrance of theunderworld to protect humans from attacks by demons that manifested themselvesin animal forms. Good genies and bad demons bellowed, roared, barked, andvociferated at each other. The ancient Babylonians firmly believed anyone whodid not have a genie protecting him or her was exposed to a demon’s attacks.6[Notes.xhtml#rch6en6] Generally speaking, the world for the Babylonians duringthis time was filled with good and bad spirits fighting each other in animalshapes.Gods and spiritual entities were not the only ones to be close to the animalrealm. The Enuma Elish informs us that humans and animals were created out ofearth mingled with the life-blood of a god. Thus, the source of life for gods,humans, and animals was perceived as one and divine by the Babylonians, whichled them to consider all forms of life as sacred.7 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en7]Beyond the Near East, one finds the same recurrence of gods or spirits appearingin animal forms. Thus, in Indian mythology, for example, the Naigamesa, themessenger of Indra and the chief of devas, has the head of a goat and rides on apeacock cart.8 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en8] There are also the Gandharvas, oftendescribed as men with birds’ legs and wings. The Rakshasas usually appear in theshape of a dog or a bird with a fat body. They are believed to distract yogis intheir meditation. In Hindu mythology, the first three avatars (incarnations) ofthe god Vishnu were Kurma the tortoise, Varaha the boar, and Nr-simha theman-lion.9 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en9]In the rich Celtic and Irish traditions, spiritual entities could also appear inanimal shapes. It is alleged when the fairies embody animal forms, they keepchanging their forms and sizes until they vanish from sight, as in the followingaccount: “There exists a kind of fairy called The Bugganes, who can appear inany shape they please—as ogresses with huge heads and great fiery eyes, orwithout any heads at all; as small dogs who grow larger and larger as you watchthem until they are larger than elephants, when perhaps they turn into the shapeof men or disappear into nothing; as horned monsters, or anything theychoose.”10 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en10]None other than poets can seize this constant metamorphosis of these entities,as this poem from Irish lore where some kind of spiritual entities describetheir constant metamorphosis: “Who now like knight and lady seem/And now likedwarf and ape.”11 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en11]Native American culture is crammed with animals’ spirits that preside overimportant aspects of life.12 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en12] These spirits often manifestthemselves as ravens who speak, or coyotes who control humans. In these oldtraditions, the shaman often captures his visions from an animal spirit whoguides him into the unseen world. The shaman is known to contact his animalspirit regularly and to talk to him. Native Americans call this kind ofcommunication “dancing the animal.” Within an altered state of consciousness, inwhich he performs his duties, the shaman recourses to his animal spirit, whichassists him in accomplishing his task. The latter is never hurtful to the shamanbut accompanies him through the underworld or guides him on his mystical climbto the sky.JINN/ANIMALS IN THE ARAB & MUSLIM TRADITIONAlong with other nations, Arabs in pre-Islam acknowledged animals could be thedwelling places for spiritual entities. They depicted jinn as taking animalshapes to hide from humans, or trick them, or deliver a message to them. Theyfirst thought the jinn chose to dwell in deer because of their beauty andfragility. The deer was looked at as a magical animal. People often alleged“deer are the cattle of the jinn.”13 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en13] Then, they describedostriches as mounts for the jinn. The alliance of evil jinn and ostriches seemsto be a mostly Semitic belief because we find it in profusion in Arabicliterature as well as in Hebrew literature, which describe them as voraciouscreatures. Scholar of Jewish and Christian demonology Edward Langton (b. 1886)claims, “By the Arabs, ostriches are definitely connected with demons, which aresaid to ride upon them or to assume their form.”14 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en14]However, one correction needs to be made here. It is important to clarify it isevil jinn that take the shape of ostriches and not demons, as Langton asserts.We know evil jinn are not equated with demons in Islam because we have discussedthree distinct categories: angels, jinn, and demons. Interesting enough, thesame ostrich becomes in Zoroastrianism and Ancient Egypt “a divine stormbird.”15 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en15] Symbols, despite their universality, keep at thesame time some patchy local elements.These beliefs continued in Islam. Muslims particularly stressed the malevolenceof black dogs. They thought they were an abode for evil jinn. They lavished onthem lunar and negative connotations. Muslim compilers like al-Jahiz (d. 868)pictured black dogs as “digging out graves and eating the dead.”16[Notes.xhtml#rch6en16] The prophetic tradition offers, however, an ambivalentpicture of jinn/dogs. Thus, in one saying, “Angels do not enter a house in whichthere is a dog or [worshiped] pictures,”17 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en17] while inanother, the Prophet invites Muslims to help all kinds of animals, includingdogs.In general, it seems it is mostly black dogs that were rejected and cursedbecause of their association with sorcery and witchcraft. The idea of black dogsas embodiment of malevolence might be borrowed from or shared with neighboringcivilizations where dogs were always connected with the underworld. In Greekmythology, for example, “The dogs of Hades represent the gloom of dawn and duskwhich contain hostile powers and are dangerous and demonic times.”18[Notes.xhtml#rch6en18]In some narratives, jinn embody strange dogs’ shapes to deliver a message tohumans, as in the intriguing story narrated by the theologian ‘Abd al-Wahab ibnAhmad al-Sha‘rani (d. 1563) in which he claims a group of Muslim jinn sent himsome questions regarding metaphysical issues. These queries were written on apiece of paper and delivered to him by a yellow dog who informed him he is ajinni taking a dog form to bring him this note in secret. Al-Sha‘rani’s guardianchased him away. But he came back, this time from the window, carrying in hismouth the letter of Muslim jinn philosophers to the author.19[Notes.xhtml#rch6en19]The choice of the dog’s color merits a quick note. We have seen that black dogswere considered impure and evil, while white dogs were not forbidden. The coloryellow here is rather unusual. It refers to the magical aspect of this dog.Whenever an animal appears in a bizarre color or shape or produces unusualsounds, it is believed throughout traditions it is not of this physicaldimension in which we live.Stories abound about the animal manifestation of jinn in classical Islam. It isrelated that a man was in charge of guarding a basket filled with dates. Henoticed the quantity of dates kept decreasing. He doubled his efforts to findthe thief. Finally, he found “a beast as small as a young boy. He caught it, andasked it: ‘Are you a jinni or a human?’ To which it replied: ‘I am a jinni.’ Theman shook hands with it, and, to his great surprise, discovered that it had thehands and the feet of a dog!”20 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en20] It is noteworthy thehuman is not frightened at all of this strange being. His question implied heexpected to encounter a non-human. This seems to be a common assumption duringthis time. It underscores the wide belief in jinn’s presence among people.In addition to dogs, deer, and ostriches, jinn are described as embodying theforms of many other animals such as foxes and porcupines21[Notes.xhtml#rch6en21] as well as “the raven, the dove, the hedgehog, and therabbit.”22 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en22] This is exemplified in the many stories thatclassical Islam weaved on the prophet Solomon. According to Qur’an 17:27, Godmade the jinn subservient to him. It is said a huge number of evil jinn inanimal appearances were brought in front of him by order of God. The strangestdescription is the one written by geographer Zakaria ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini (d.1283). It illustrates with rich and vivid details how Gabriel called the jinnand the demons by command of God to obey his prophet Solomon, and how the jinnand satans streamed out of the caverns, mountains, hills, valleys, and deserts,saying: “Here we are at your service!” They were guided by the angels as cattleare guided by a shepherd, until they arrived in front of Solomon, obedient andhumble. Solomon looked at their strange figures: some of them were white, othersblack, others yellow, and others blond. They had the forms of horses, mules, andlions with trunks, tails, claws, and horns.23 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en23]Al-Mas‘udi (d. 956) in turn added picturesque details to this sight. He offeredan entire scenery of eerie beings with two faces, one in front and one in therear, with their heads similar to birds’ heads. Some spoke like thunder; stillothers cried like birds, and had their mouths in their chests. There was anation among them that resembled insects, but had bulky bodies and horns ontheir heads. Others resembled flying snakes and yet had many feet and hands. Itwas believed these beings worked day and night at Solomon’s court.24[Notes.xhtml#rch6en24]In these two popular accounts, jinn appear as hideous, atrocious, and hybridbeings that lack symmetry. It is assumed the hard labor these entities performfor their master, Solomon, is a punishment they deserve for having rebelledagainst him. Evil jinn in general are characterized by their infinite shapeshifting, which has a goal of luring humans and enticing them. It is exemplifiedby the following story recited by a jinni called Abu-Hadraj:The children of Adam were evil to me, and I likewise treated them. Once Ientered their world wanting to sleep with one of their maids. I changed my shapeinto the form of a field rat, and the cats chased me. And when they got me, Ishape-shifted into a striped serpent and slinked into a tree stump there. Butthey uncovered me, and at that moment I feared death and made a dim hissing, andfollowed along the timber’s plank, and one broke open a place in the wood butdidn’t see me. And they said in their bewilderment, “There is no place herewhere it could hide,” and while they were wondering where I was, I went to thevirgin who was under a mosquito net, and when she saw me the fear of falling hither. Then her family gathered around her from all sides and brought exorcists,and called doctors, and they made every effort to revive her, and did not omitamulets to charm me away from her, but I did not respond. And the doctorscontinued to administer medicines to heal her, but I clutched to her tightly.When death hit her, I sought to replace her by another, then another, until Godaided me with repentance and great reward, so I incessantly praised Him: “Ipraise the One who took my burden away, and now my sins are forgiven.”25[Notes.xhtml#rch6en25]This story is worthy of note because it sums up many aspects of the interactionbetween jinn and humans, as people imagined it in classical Islam. The narrativepertains first to the ensnaring maneuvers of the jinni, and to his speed thatenabled him to quickly vanish without being caught.Second, Abu-Hadraj desired a human woman and didn’t hesitate to come to herwhile doctors and members of her family were still looking for him. As we shallsee in the next chapter, it is alleged jinn sometimes fall in love with humans.They could harm them or even bring their death if they don’t respond to theirlove. Third, this story depicts humans’ recourse to magic to drive out eviljinn. They attempted to dispel malevolence by using amulets and charms. But itwas in vain. Finally, and most important, this jinni converts to Islam, andhence, becomes a good jinni devoted to the worship of God. Be that as it may,this text illustrates the elusive nature of the jinn and their trickstercharacter. It also reiterates the Islamic belief evil jinn could be redeemed bythe Word of God anywhere and anytime.It is important to mention Abu al-‘Ala’ al-Ma‘arri (d. 1057), author of thisstory, was an agnostic. However, he brings in this narrative to underscore thebeliefs of people during that time. One could surmise, though, he is beingsarcastic as well because he is known for his rationality and his sharpcriticism of religion.SERPENTS AS THE EMBODIMENTS OF SPIRITS IN VARIOUS RELIGIOUS TRADITIONSOur first reading of Arab/Muslim narratives seems to convey jinn could embodyany animal shape. However, this is not a comprehensive picture of the jinn’scapabilities. The majority of accounts in classical Islam notify us jinn preferto dwell in serpents. Interesting enough, this appears to hold true for mostspirits across the world. The serpent, simply put, is a central figure in allmythologies. It is also perceived as an ambiguous being. On one hand, it islooked at as a lowly animal because it cannot leave the ground. But on the otherhand, it is considered a supernatural being because it lives very long, shedsits skin, and is thus reborn. One of the most recognizable serpent symbols isthe Ouroboros. It is found in alchemy and in ancient Egyptian, Greek, andGnostic religions. It is a serpent that is swallowing its own tail, and usuallymakes a circle that is itself a symbol of perfection, rebirth, and eternity.Across cultures, humans look at this slinking power under the moon as a psychicand telepathic creature. The repulsion a serpent causes through its size andstrength, and the mysterious action of its silent and slithering movements makeit an embodiment of mythical force. The serpent is thus a creature to be enviedas well as feared, a being of immeasurable slyness, intricacy, and perhaps evil.Before embarking in an analysis of the serpent’s relation to the jinn inclassical Islam, I would like to underscore the universal connection betweenserpents and spirits across traditions to highlight this universal belief.Serpents were closely associated with spirits throughout the ancient Near East.The idea of spiritual entities in serpent form was a familiar one from Egypt toPersia and from Babylon to Canaan. In Egypt, the serpent was a multifacetedsymbol of deity and evil altogether. On one hand, it was worshiped as a goddessof good and kept in large numbers in temples. It often appears as a personal orhouse protecting amulet throughout Egyptian history. Egyptians venerated manyvarieties of serpents. The pharaoh himself wore a serpent emblem on hisheaddress to show his divinity. But on the other hand, the serpent wasconsidered a dark power to be feared because “the great enemy of Horus, Ra,Osiris, and also of the deceased in the underworld, was the monster serpentApep, or Apophys, which directed the attacks on gods and men of numbers ofserpent broods, and which was held to be the personification of all evil.”26[Notes.xhtml#rch6en26]In Babylon, serpents were also perceived as malevolent beings, primarilyassociated with the netherworld. In the Sumerian Enuma Elish, the god Mardukfights the goddess Tiamat identified with the “evil serpent” or the “serpent ofdarkness.” It is also said the city of Babylon was built above the “Gate ofApsu,” the serpent present before Creation. The demonic aspect of the serpent isalso seen in the myths of Labbu, and in the serpent that stole the plant ofimmortality from king Gilgamesh (about 2700 BCE), thus depriving him of the soleopportunity to acquire immortality. However, like in Egypt, serpents wereworshiped as well because of their secret knowledge. The Babylonian goddessAstarte is often shown with serpents in her hands.In Palmyra’s religion, in Syria, the myth of the serpent as a demon of theunderworld is overwhelmingly present as well. Furthermore, there was the ideathat the river of the Orontes that flows nearby contained a jinni in serpentineform.27 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en27]As for Persian mythology, the serpent Dahaka is the incarnation of the evilspirit Angra Mainyu. And in Greek mythology, many battles took place betweengods and dragons, or monsters with a serpentine form, such as the battle of Zeuswith Typhon, a horrible creature with a hundred burning snake heads, who swamamong sea serpents, or the battle between the hero Perseus and the Medusa, whohad snakes for hair. There was a widespread belief in Greece that serpents anddragons lived in the world of the deep, maybe protecting humans from thepolluting darkness of earth. As for the Romans, they used to keep a large numberof tame snakes in their temples and houses for protection.28[Notes.xhtml#rch6en28]The Hebrew too had their own representations of serpents as ambivalentcreatures. One encounters the serpent as an evil being in several passages ofthe Old Testament that refer to demonic creatures of serpentine form. The mythof the chaos-dragon, for example, is found in the writings of the post-exilicprophets. In Isaiah 27:1 we read that “On that day, Leviathan, the sea monster,will squirm and try to escape, but the Lord will kill him with a cruel, sharpsword.”29 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en29]In this context, one should note historians, theologians, and archeologists havebeen working together in the last decades to offer a comprehensive picture ofthe duality and complexity of the serpent myth in the Old Testament. It is inthis context that S. H. Hooke, British specialist of Middle Eastern mythology(d. 1968), looked upon the archeological unearthing in the Middle East. Hookebelieved certain features of the discoveries at the Canaanite city Beth-Shan(Arabic: Beisan)—situated above the Jordan Valley in the vicinity of the Plainof Esdraelon (Arabic Marj ibn ‘Amer)—are crucial in the sense they help usunravel the ambivalence of the serpent in the Old Testament. “The name of theplace, as well as various objects found there, indicates that it was a center ofserpent worship, a cult which survived in Jerusalem as late as the time ofHezekiah.”30 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en30] Therefore, it seems the inhabitants ofBeth-Shan, like many other people of the ancient Middle East, were dividedbetween worshiping the serpent for its powers and abhorring it for itsembodiment of evil.Indian mythology in turn perceived the serpent as a twofold symbol. The Nagasare supernatural entities, kind of genies. They dwell in waters, and manifestthemselves in serpent or dragon forms with human faces. Nagas are a primordialrace of divine serpent-people that play an important part in religion. On onehand, they are looked upon as the guardians of rain and fertility, and on theother hand they are thought to bring disasters such as floods and drought. Theyare also the protectors of springs, wells, and rivers. The god Varuna, a kind ofIndian Poseidon, who assumes the role of the regent of water, rules over them;he is called Naga Raja. Interesting enough, Nagas seem to still be venerated inIndia today, and their cult is popular, especially in the region of Deccan.Every August 5th, after the new moon, there is a big celebration called thefeast of Naga-Panchami, when children and women sculpt images of cobras andvenerate them, and offer flowers, food, and water to them.31[Notes.xhtml#rch6en31]Indian myths speak also of a battle that occurred at a certain point in timebetween the god Indra and a gigantic serpent that entrapped the waters and keptthem from gushing. Indra defeated it, though, and made the waters stream again.By killing the serpent, the god mastered the powers of chaos that threatened todestroy the world, and reinstated order. The serpent was also believed to be acosmic force, like the kundalini, which is a feminine noun meaning serpent.Kundalini is essential spiritual energy pictured as a twisting serpentslumbering in each of us.SERPENTS AS THE EMBODIMENTS OF JINNClassical Islam in turn perceived jinn as assuming serpentine form. Already inpre-Islam, serpents were associated with jinn because, like them, they wanderedaround ruins, graves, and barren places, strangely manifesting themselves, thenvanishing. Both jinn and serpents were imagined in pre-Islam as living close tothe invisible realm, gliding into obscure and deserted caverns and hauntedclefts. It was alleged both move promptly, in a flowing and puzzling manner,without feet or wings. Both were considered psychic and telepathic beings.Furthermore, serpents were also considered the daughters of the jinn inpre-Islam.32 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en32]Classical Islam inherited from pre-Islamic times and from the ancientcivilizations of the Near East the complex belief in serpents representing goodand evil. This ambivalence is particularly found in the prophetic tradition. Onone hand, Muhammad stresses the necessity of eliminating these animals. Thus, heis reported to have said, “He who kills a serpent kills an unbeliever in God,and he who leaves alive a serpent out of fear, does not belong to us.”33[Notes.xhtml#rch6en33] But on the other hand, he maintained Muslim jinn usuallyembody white serpents, and should not be killed. They were called ‘ummar, andoften lived in houses. If one is in doubt about the true nature of the serpent,one should recite the call to prayer three times before killing it. If theserpent leaves, then it could mean a Muslim jinni is embodied in it; if itstays, however, it should be killed. The call to prayer seems to be the ultimatetest.34 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en34]In this context, Mecca occupies a place of first importance regarding therepresentation of jinn in serpent shapes, both before Islam and in classicalIslam as well. Thus, it was alleged in pre-Islam that shaytan was a serpentnothing resisted.35 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en35] It used to come to the Ka‘bah (theholy shrine in Mecca) before Islam, and hit the ground with its body. Anythingthat came close to it was doomed to perish.36 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en36] Inclassical Islam, battles raged between heretic jinn and Muslim jinn, bothembodying serpents. For example, we are told, “When a jinni, on the seventh dayof his marriage, wanted to circumambulate the Ka‘bah seven times and completehis pilgrimage, he left his family in the shape of a white serpent. While he wason his way back, passing by the encampment of the jinn tribe of Banu Sahm, ayouth from their tribe killed him. Consequently, a Trojan-style war broke outbetween the tribe of Banu Sahm and the tribe of the serpent/jinn who wasassassinated. A great dust-cloud entered Mecca, so thick the mountains could nolonger be seen.”37 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en37]IBLIS AND THE SERPENTAlthough the Qur’anic representation of evil is concise, and although there isno mention of the serpent whatsoever, Qur’anic commentaries as well as the Talesof the Prophets invented a mythology of the serpent that is simply nonexistentin the Holy Book. Those texts added supernatural elements borrowed from ancientNear-Eastern beliefs, and mostly from oral Jewish accounts circulating in theArabian Peninsula at that point in time. In the Qur’an, Iblis is described onlyas an evildoer, but not as a serpent. In Qur’an 20:120*, Iblis whispers to Adam:“Adam, shall I show you the way to the Tree of Everlasting Life and to a kingdomwhich will never fade away?”Popular commentators on these verses, however, suggested that Iblis couldn’tperform his evil act without the assistance of the serpent that hid him in itsmouth, and thus enabled him to slither into paradise. These works claimed Iblisspoke to Adam from inside the mouth of the serpent. They added he asked all theanimals to carry him into paradise, but they refused, except the serpent. Someof the commentators even alleged God spoke to the serpent and cursed it forcarrying Iblis into paradise. These narratives were reiterating the biblicalmalediction God imposed on it, compelling this being to seek its sustenance inthe earth, and making it the eternal enemy of man.38 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en38]Popular imagination added further fanciful details to the original andunfinished story. Some commentators went so far as to contend “Iblis married theserpent.”39 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en39] They even maintained Iblis transformedhimself into a wind to enter into the mouth of the serpent.40[Notes.xhtml#rch6en40] The exuberant imagination of ibn Kathir (d. 1373), forexample, concocted a whole new scenario for the serpent based on his ownfantastic reading of the Qur’an. He claimed the serpent was really mentioned inthe Qur’an when God expelled Adam and Eve from paradise, and God really cursednot only Iblis and the serpent, but also Adam and Eve.In the Qur’anic story of the creation, however, Adam and Eve are expelled fromparadise, but the curse falls only upon Iblis. God did not curse Adam or Eve.That is perhaps one of the reasons why the original sin does not exist in Islam,and why Man is considered gloriously free, created with original purity andinnocence (fitrah); he is responsible only for his own deeds. “No soul ladenbears the load of another” (Qur’an 6:164).CONCLUSIONDespite hiding in animal shapes to trick humans, people believed evil jinn couldforsake their wickedness at any time and become good Muslims, as in the story ofAbu-Hadraj. This freedom of choice means, from an Islamic perspective, there isno evil jinni steeped forever in his evil, although a demon will always be evil.Even ghouls (kinds of jinn) could turn into worshipers of God at any moment.41[Notes.xhtml#rch6en41] Islamic medieval literature reports many stories ofmalevolent ghouls that were subdued and pacified by the Word of God.42[Notes.xhtml#rch6en42]In fact, Satan and his descendants, the demons, are perhaps the only exceptionof chaos in the Islamic cosmos where every being, every thing is submitted tothe Divine and glorifies it manifestly or in an invisible way. In this context,Islam offers a specific conception of chaos brought about by demons and eviljinn versus order established by the Divine. Indeed, although Timothy K. Beal,contemporary writer on religion and professor of biblical literature at CaseWestern Reserve University could mention “by demonizing our monsters, we keepGod on our side,”43 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en43] Islam could say by convertingmonsters and evil beings, we bring them to our side. It should be noted,however, Islam did send away some eerie beings to places far away from theMuslim Empire, like the nasnas that was believed to thrive in China or unknownparts of the planet. But even from these distant places outside the Muslimarena, the nasnas could turn to Islam anytime, if he chooses to do so, and,therefore, join the realm of order and harmony.44 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en44]Beal does not mention the possibility of convincing the monstrous to forsakechaos and evil. The only solution is to just send it away from us. “Often wedemonize the monster as a threat not only to ‘our’ order but also to the orderof the gods or God. In this way the monstrous other who threatens ‘us’ and ‘ourworld’ is represented as an enemy of God and then is exorcized from the rightorder of things and sent to some sort of hell. ‘Our’ order is identified withthe sacred order against a diabolically monstrous chaos.”45[Notes.xhtml#rch6en45]By making jinn responsible and with free choice, Islam granted them a spiritualpower that not only affects their destinies, but also reminds humans of theirduties, when they err. It is in this Muslim perspective of responsibility towardtheir own communities on one hand, and toward the cosmos and its beings on theother hand, that a group of Muslim scholars, Ikhwan al-Safa’ wa khillan al-wafa’(The Brethren of Purity and Loyal Friends), formed a secret Arab organization ofneo-Platonic and Gnostic philosophers in al-Basrah, Iraq, around 970. Theorganization is best known for having produced a philosophical and religiousencyclopedia, Epistles of the Brethren of Purity and Loyal Friends, whosepurpose was to provide enlightenment that would purify the soul and providehappiness in the next life.One of these remarkable Epistles that concerns our study is entitled The Case ofthe Animals Versus Man before the King of the Jinn. It is a fable that narrateshow a group of humans one day landed on an island after their ship was wrecked.They immediately began to exploit the nature and the animals living in harmonywith the jinn, their rulers. One day, the animals bring their case before theking of the jinn, and ask for help to escape the tyranny of the humans. The workis formed of a series of speeches, where several animals explain how humansabuse them. The latter in turn expound their views, and bring about Qur’anicideas that stress how God gave the animals to Adam to serve him and obey him. Atthe end, an enlightening discussion between some jinn philosophers and someintelligent humans lead to the idea of compassion. Yes, humans could use theanimals, but they also have to respect them, and treat them kindly and justly.46[Notes.xhtml#rch6en46] The key word of this work is the three realms of humans,jinn, and animals are interconnected and form a whole.To survive, humans need to be aware of all forms of life in the cosmos, respectthem, protect them, and more important, think about their own human naturethrough them. After all, are not humans the vice-regents of God on Earth, asIslam stipulates? As such, they are supposed to be just and empathetic towardevery living being as well as toward nature that should not be exploited anddestroyed.The interconnectedness of all living beings is epitomized in the Arabic termal-hayawan, which refers to animals as well as to all forms of energy, allliving beings. Arabic lexicography defines it as “all the created species. It islife itself.”47 [Notes.xhtml#rch6en47]The Qur’an uses the term al-hayawan only once, “Surely the Last Abode is [thetrue] Life [al-hayawan], did they but know” (Qur’an 29:64). The Qur’anelucidates the true al-hayawan is not the human life on Earth, which is anillusion of life. The true life exists only in paradise. It loads this term withso much meaning that al-hayawan becomes the immortality that humans have alwaysdesired and searched for since the dawn of their history. In this sense, onecould surmise from the perspective of Islam, the life or energy humans and jinnexperience in this world becomes an everlasting vigor in the last abode."},{"pageContent":"7Love Between Humans and Jinn O doctor of the jinn, woe unto you, find me a cure, for the doctor of humans is helpless against my ill. —MAJNUN LAILA, seventh-century Arab poet1 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en1]Love between humans and jinn could be considered one of the most extravagant andintriguing aspects in the two species’ interaction. This particular themefascinated Muslims in medieval times. Aberrant love affairs between jinn andhumans circulated, creating fear, and flaring the curiosity of all classes ofthe society. Writers from the three layers of Islam—Orthodox, popular, andSufi—were equally drawn toward this topic. All of them extensively wrote on it.The corpus they generated is one of the most original and captivating materialswritten on human/spirit love affairs across cultures. It was, though, the mostdifficult thing to deal with. Religious leaders strove to put down laws tocontrol these alleged and dangerous relations. But the public remained immenselyentranced by these strange narratives.LOVE STORIES BETWEEN JINN AND HUMANS IN PRE-ISLAMIn pre-Islam, a jinni who loved a woman or a jinniyah who loved a man would takeon a human form, and sometimes an animal form. They were called tabi‘,“follower,” masculine, or tabi‘ah, feminine, from the Arabic root t.b‘, meaning“to follow.” It was alleged these spiritual entities would always follow thehuman they loved, whether the latter was aware of their presence or not. Peoplethought if the jinn were pleased with humans they, in return, would teach themthe arts of medicine and the art of war, especially how to make fine swords. Forexample, in one account, we are told “a certain jinni, called Manzur, loved awoman from the humans, called Habbah. He befriended her and taught her the artsof healing.”2 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en2]The notion jinn would offer humans their knowledge in return is noteworthy.Before Islam, people supposed knowledge came from gods or spirits; that humanshad to seek it outside of themselves. Two branches of knowledge specificallyinterested them: healing and the art of war. Rampant disease took an enormoustoll on people’s lives. Pre-Islamic Arabs thought supernatural beings such asthe jinn had power over death and sickness. The continual state of war wasdevastating. As one tribe commenced a truce with a neighboring kingdom, anothertribe declared war somewhere in the Arabian Peninsula.Love between humans and jinn was often linked to the belief jinn could dwell insome animals, as previously discussed. People maintained jinn dwell especiallyin deer. Pre-Islamic Arabs firmly believed deer were sacred animals. It wasclaimed goddess al-‘Uzza was worshiped surrounded by deer as her sacredanimals.3 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en3]The most notorious of pre-Islamic myths related to love and animals isundoubtedly that of the Arab Queen Balqis from Yemen. This myth recounts thatBalqis’s father, a king named al-Hadhad, went one day to hunt the deer. Heencountered a flock of deer but didn’t kill them. The king of the jinn appearedto him and thanked him for preserving the lives of his people, the jinn, whowere thought to dwell in these “sacred” animals. The myth claims he expressedhis gratitude to al-Hadhad and offered him the hand of his daughter, Ruwaha bintSakan. The king of the jinn requested, however, that he never question her ifher behavior appears sometimes odd to him. Ruwaha bint Sakan gave birth to twosons and a girl they named Balqis. At the birth of each child, a female dogwould come and snatch away the newborn. The father didn’t ask for anyexplanation at the request of the king of the jinn, except at the third time.Ruwaha then revealed to him this female dog was in fact a jinniyah that took thechildren to raise them in the jinn’s realm. She then departed from the conjugalhouse and never returned because her husband broke the covenant of silence andasked about the secret of the jinn.4 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en4]After her father’s death, Balqis became the queen. People accepted herauthority. They abided by her rules, and attributed to her immense powersbecause of her mythical origins.ISLAMIC THEOLOGY AND THE LOVE BETWEEN HUMANS AND JINNThe idea jinn embody a human form when they fall in love with a human, of eithersex, persisted in Islam. Anecdotes on love affairs and marriages between bothintelligent beings became very popular. In the bibliographical work of ibnal-Nadim (d. 1047), there is a whole section entitled “Names of humans who lovedthe jinn, and vice-versa.”5 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en5]Despite an authorized prohibition against marriages between jinn and humans, asmentioned in the writings of Muslim jurists, it was believed these claimedunions continued to take place in Islam. Stories of people possessed by jinnproliferated, and the names of renowned persons who fell in love with jinn werecommonplace. Ibn al-Nadim, however, cautions us that many of these stories werepurely fabricated by some compilers to satisfy the demands of people under theAbbaside Caliphate, and especially under the Caliph al-Muqtadir (d. 932).Because of these beliefs, Muslim theologians were bound to lay down a set ofconventions and a code of moral principles to prohibit marriages between the twointelligent species. The various religious schools concurred these marriageswere unlawful. They agreed to strictly forbid them on the grounds humans andjinn belong to different species.6 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en6] Al-Suyuti (d. 1505)alleged the Prophet mentioned the illegality of these marriages on severaloccasions. He attributed to him the following Hadith: “The end of time will notcome until the children of jinn multiply among you.”7 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en7] Manycommentators on this prophetic saying maintained the Prophet was referring tothe “illegitimate” progeny of jinn and humans. But despite this official ban,the majority of Muslims continued telling stories about marriages between thetwo species. Serious difficulties came up, especially when dealing with what wasbelieved to be the offspring of these unions.Religious experts had to provide a juridical and theological status to thisprogeny. They basically raised the question of identity: is a jinni or jinniyaha person? What does it mean to claim a human “contracted marriage” with a jinnior a jinniyah? Al-Shibli (d. 1368) recounted various anecdotes about humans andjinn intermarriages to make obvious marriages between humans and jinn occurredboth before as well as during his time. He cited one of his friends, a jurist,who had been married to a jinniyah for three days when he was traveling with hisfather. Al-Shibli went to see him and heard the story from him directly, andsubstantiated it really did occur.8 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en8] Al-Shibli alsoreported some stories in which Muslim authorities specifically had forbiddenunions with jinn, such as the following: “A man came to al-Hasan al-Basri [b.642] and said to him: ‘A jinni wants to be engaged to one of our girls.’Al-Hasan said to him: ‘Do not marry her to him and do not honor him!’ Then theman went to another sheikh, surnamed Qatadah, and asked him the same. The latterrepeated an identical injunction: ‘Do not marry her to him, and, if he comes toyou, say to him: We beg you—if you are a Muslim jinni—to leave us alone and nothurt us!’”9 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en9]The Qur’an alludes to this interrelation: “In these gardens [of Paradise] willbe maidens restraining their glances, untouched before them by humans or jinn”(Qur’an 55:56 and 74*). Muslim theologians have concluded from these two versesthe Qur’an implies humans had contracted unions with jinn. But a much moreimportant question was posed: Is the Qur’an implying therefore these marriagesare tolerable, irrespective of their apparent illegality?In Qur’an 30:20 we read: “And of His signs is that He created for you, ofyourselves, spouses, that you might find repose in them, and He has set betweenyou love and mercy.” Commentators of the Qur’an concurred that “of yourselves”in this context means “from your own kind,” and these verses, therefore, implyGod excludes beings other than humans as partners in marriage. They argued ifGod wanted humans to contract unions with jinn, he would have explicitly statedso. Al-Shibli, in interpreting this verse, mentioned the aversion and fear thathave always existed between humans and jinn, and concluded humans cannot findpeace and tenderness in unions with supernatural beings. He also quoted otherverses, such as Qur’an 72:6 and 33:50, where the Qur’an speaks of marriage ingeneral, and of the wives of the Prophet in particular, without mentioninghumans are permitted to marry jinn. Imam Malik ibn Anas (d. 796) expressed hismoral apprehension and ethical concern for the Muslim society: “It is notagainst the religion, but I hate to see a woman pregnant from marrying a jinni,and people would ask, ‘Who is the husband?’ and then corruption would spreadamong Muslims.”10 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en10]In general, people were anxious about the mixing of species and the hybridprogeny of jinn and humans. It is reported from the Prophet’s wife ‘A’ishah thata group of people came to visit the Prophet, who said to them: “There arestrangers among you.” They asked him, “Who are the strangers?” He answered,“Some who are half jinn.”11 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en11] Based on this idea ofotherness and foreignness, Islam forbade these unions.12 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en12]Many stories proliferated about these intermarriages. Thus, it is alleged thefourth Caliph ‘Ali has met those “unfamiliar” children. Once he noticed a childin his council who was acting oddly, and he asked, “Who knows this child?”Someone replied, “I know him. His name is ’Aws, and there is his mother.” ‘Aliasked the mother, “Who is the father?” She said, “I don’t know. One day I waspasturing the sheep for my parents—this was before Islam—when something in theform of a cloud mated with me. I became pregnant, and gave birth to thischild.”13 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en13]The “cloud” figure mentioned by the woman in this story is significant. Jinn arethought to be “subtle” beings, invisible, composed of air and fire, capable ofchanging forms ad infinitum. As for the clouds, they are evanescent and fineforms. They are also shape-shifters; it is enough to look for a few seconds atpassing clouds in the sky to see them changing appearances. The symbol of thecloud across traditions refers to confusion, vagueness, and imprecision; cloudsare threshold figures between the visible and the invisible. In religious texts,they refer to epiphanies and the spirit. Interesting enough, fairies have beenoften described as “subtle” and “aerial” too. Peter Rojcewicz, contemporaryspecialist of folklore, maintains, “fairies have something of the nature of amist or condensed cloud, having been called ‘astral,’ ‘crazed,’ or‘sidereal.’”14 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en14]In the same context, Rojcewicz maintains a scientist, Ogilvie Crombie, claimedhe contacted fairies and elemental entities at the Findhorn Community inScotland. According to Crombie, “Their [fairies] primary state is what may betermed a ‘light body.’ Not easy to describe in words, it is nebulous like a finemist, being a whirl or a vortex of energy in constant motion.”15[Notes.xhtml#rch7en15]The woman at the Caliph ‘Ali’s council seems to be hinting at a subtle being, toa source or “vortex” of energy she claimed hit her. It may well be one of thesespirits of the imaginal realm that manifested itself to her in the shape of acloud.As in pre-Islam, stories of men marrying (female) jinn that suddenly depart likeBalqis’s mother continued to spread in Islam. Occasionally, the “alien” wifeleaves just after giving birth to a child without any explanation. The husbandwill look for her in vain, for the absence of the supernatural bride is alwaysultimate. And if the husband delves into an over-curious questioning about hernature, this supernatural woman could harm him: “A jinniyah in the shape of awoman came once to al-Madinah and said to a man, ‘We have come to live in yourneighborhood, please marry me.’ So he married her. One day she said to him, ‘Imust leave now, so divorce me.’ While he was accompanying her for the last time,browsing together in the streets of al-Madinah, he saw her picking up grainsfrom the ground and eating them. He spoke up, and said, ‘Do you like thesegrains?’ She stared at him angrily, and raised her finger towards his eyes,which instantly melted.”16 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en16]Joseph Campbell (d. 1987), authority on myths across traditions, speaks of “theWild Women of the woods” who are well known by the Russian peasants. These“alien” creatures “enjoy human lovers, have frequently married country youths,and are known to make excellent wives. But like all supernatural brides, theminute the husband offends in the least their whimsical notions of maritalpropriety, they disappear without a trace.”17 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en17] Eliade (d.1986) in turn mentions, “The Maori people speak of a hero called Tawhaki, whomhis wife, a fairy, came down to earth from heaven, and abandoned him aftergiving birth to a child.”18 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en18]The purpose of these short marriages between humans and supernatural beings ismysterious because we are dealing with a dubious motive from the “alien” figurewho desires to mate with a human only to bring forth a “hybrid” child she thenleaves behind. One wonders why in all these stories across the world thesupernatural wife never takes her children with her. Her love for her childrenseems to be different from that of a human mother. One could conjecture thesupernatural mother is on a mission, which is only to bring these “hybrid”children to the world for reasons that remain unknown. Generally speaking,ambiguity, elusiveness, impulsivity, and swiftness seem to characterize thesespiritual entities from a different realm. Indeed, intermediary beings strikerapidly. They trick their victim, and promptly leave the scene. Between oneblink of an eye and the next, they appear and vanish, leaving behind themstunned humans who have difficulty coping with the event they just experienced.LOVE BETWEEN HUMANS AND JINN IN POPULAR ISLAM: THE ARABIAN NIGHTSThe Nights, this monumental literary material, undoubtedly overflows with themost outlandish and stunning stories on the theme of love between jinn andhumans. It is the most prolific and the most ingenious popular source. TheNights’ narratives are totally different from the anecdotes we have includedabove from orthodox Islam. Despite their prolific use of the Holy Book andIslamic tradition, the storyteller, and later the scribe, are not anxious aboutthe prohibitions and injunctions we find in orthodox Islam. Located farther fromthe source of Islamic law, this body of texts indulges in portraying lovestories between the two species. The narrative as an open realm grants freedomto the heroes in their quest for a non-human love. Here, one experiences anextraordinary mingling of fantastic, religious, and mystical dimensions. Theconnection with these beings of the imaginal is always imbued with reminiscencesfrom Persian, Chinese, and Indian literatures. The daily life of humans in lovewith supernatural beings constantly combines the unfamiliar with the historicaland the social. It is a realm where pure logic is of no avail for here andthere, past and present, human and alien persistently fuse to create aperplexing reality.In what follows, I will interpret three aspects in three different tales relatedto this theme in The Nights.Jinn’s Love and the Game of Shape ShiftingThe love between humans and jinn appears in The Nights as characterized by thegame of shape shifting. The invisible jinni or jinniyah manifestshimself/herself to the beloved in a human shape to hide his/her true identity tothe human beloved. In the tale of “The Merchant and the Jinni,” for example, thejinniyah appeared to a man in the form of a woman dressed in tatters. She beggedhim to marry her and promised to reward him for his compassion and charity,adding these mysterious words, “Don’t be misled by my poverty and my presentcondition.”19 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en19] So, he married her, and took her with himon a ship with his two brothers who were setting up his death. One day, the twobrothers threw him and his wife in the sea while they were asleep. It is only atthat moment that he discovers the true nature of his wife: “When we awoke, mywife turned into a [jinniyah] and carried me out of the sea to an island. Whenit was morning, she said, ‘Husband, I have rewarded you by saving you fromdrowning, for I am one of the jinn who believe in God. When I saw you by theseashore, I felt love for you and came to you in the guise in which you saw me,and when I expressed my love for you, you accepted me.’ Afterward, she took meand flew away with me until she brought me home and put me down on the roof ofmy house.”20 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en20]Obviously, the human is bewildered, and his mind has little time to process hiswife’s swift metamorphosis. Everything happens in a glance, beyond the laws ofnature, beyond time and place. It is not chaos that quakes the narrative, butrather a new set of laws, the laws of the fantastic that originate in theinvisible realm and suddenly manifest themselves in our physical world.21[Notes.xhtml#rch7en21]The idea of supernatural beings falling in love with humans is widespread inmyths and religious traditions across the world. These supernatural beings,sometimes gods, put on human appearances to hide their true nature, for theyhave at hand many lines of attack to lure humans. The god Zeus himself fell inlove with Europa, daughter of the king of Sidon. He saw her one morning whileshe was playing with her friends, and instantly desired her. So he transformedhimself into a bull and appeared to her. The legend goes that she rode on hisback, but he leapt into the sea and swam with her to Crete, then to his owndomain, Olympus. There he married her, and she soon gave birth to the god Minos.It was also acknowledged in Greek mythology the Greek heroes were the sons ofnymphs. These ocean beings who visited Prometheus on the crag in the Caucasusspoke only the most ordinary common sense when they said to him: “May you never,oh never behold me, sharing the couch of a god. May none of the dwellers inheaven draw near to me ever. Such love, as the high gods know, from whose eyesnone can hide, may that never be mine!”22 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en22]The Bible also tells about physical love between supernatural beings, the BeniElohim, and the daughters of humans. In Genesis 6:2, we read: “It was at thattime that the Elohim, these beings from the spirit world, looked upon thebeautiful earth women and took any they desired to be their wives.” In Celticand Irish lore we stumble on comparable stories of fairies falling in love withhumans. Briggs (d. 1980) claims, “The fairies are apparently near enough in kindto mate with humans—closer in fact than a horse is to an ass, for many humanfamilies claim a fairy ancestress.”23 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en23]Jinn Carry Off the Woman They Love the Night of Her WeddingThe Prologue of The Nights already opens with a story of a jinni who comes upfrom the sea in front of the two brothers, Shahzaman and Shahrayar. He appearswith a chest in his hands: “He took out four keys and, opening the locks of thechest, pulled out a full-grown woman. She had a beautiful figure, and a facelike the full moon, and a lovely smile. He took her out, laid her under thetree, and looked at her, saying, ‘Mistress of all noble women, you whom Icarried away on your wedding night, I would like to sleep a little.’”24[Notes.xhtml#rch7en24]And in the story of “The Porter and the Three Ladies,” the second Kalandar (aparticular type of Sufi) also tells his own story, in which we learn he livedfor a short time with a woman who was carried off by a jinni the night of herwedding.25 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en25]This pattern unveils a jinn’s desire to desecrate the human lovers’ bond at thewedding, to transgress a cherished ritual by irrupting into the joyfulgathering, and seizing away the bride.26 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en26]Although the first story of the jinniyah who saved her human husband fromdrowning sheds light on the jinn’s affection and good will toward humans, theabduction of human brides by jinn in the second set of stories unveils theintentions of evil jinn, and their wish to subdue human females. At the sametime, it underscores humans’ fears of the invisible realm and its inhabitants.Finally, it reminds us of the official injunctions of Islamic theology not toembark on close and intimate relations with the jinn. In any case, whether thejinn abuse humans or express their affection toward them, the latter wouldalways articulate their qualms and suspicions of these subtle entities. Theopposite is also true, inasmuch as the jinn are said to be doubtful andapprehensive of human intentions concerning them.27 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en27]Three Tales of InitiationThe third aspect of love relationships between jinn and humans is the initiationthe human hero undertakes to earn his beloved jinniyah. It is exemplified inthree stories of The Nights: “The Tale of Janshah,” “The Tale of Hasanal-Basri,” and “The Tale of the Prince Sayf al-Muluk and the Princess Badi‘atal-Jamal.”The Tale of JanshahThe tale of the prince Janshah begins, as in many fairy tales and folk talesacross traditions, with a hunt. Hunting is an act loaded with symbols. On afirst manifest level, hunting seems simply a game, or a sport, mostly royal, asin this story. But on a deeper level, it is a search of the unknown symbolizedby the animal hidden somewhere in the forest or in the fields. The hunter is notpursuing the animal inasmuch as he is following the road this particular animalis taking. The hero’s journey, or rather his destiny, is nothing other than thisspecific path unfolding in front of him.The prince Janshah, accompanied by his slaves and friends, chase a beautifuldeer that vanishes from their sight each time they come closer to it. Weimmediately recognize the game of hide and seek intermediary beings undertake todraw the human to their net. The more the group moves forward looking for theanimal, the more the animal recedes deep in the forest. As we have seen, animalshave always been representations of something higher than their physical forms.In this context, the deer are interesting because they are often imbued withmagic in fairy tales. They are “the supernatural animals of the fairy world andare fairy cattle and divine messengers.”28 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en28] By hunting thedeer, prince Janshah is unconsciously hunting for a supernatural message. Littleby little, the prince loses his companions and slaves, one after the other,until he becomes the only survivor of the group. He finds himself in a wild,isolated environment. It is as if the experience of the supernatural, the searchfor meaning entails solitude, the sole company of beasts and virgin nature, andthe freedom from all human bonds. Janshah doesn’t find the deer, but follows hertraces without capturing her, and keeps advancing forward. For the first time inhis life, Janshah is confronted with his own self in total solitude. This is thefirst degree of a long initiation unraveling to the hero, who is only fifteenyears old. This means he is neither a child nor an adult; he is at that junctionin his life where puberty manifests itself.Janshah’s journey is long; it takes him to unfamiliar places. He faces all kindsof perils, and encounters various weird creatures, and finally, he perceives afaraway castle. He walks day and night until he reaches it. He enters it andmeets sheikh Nasr, a very old jinni who rules over birds from the time of theprophet Solomon.29 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en29] The second stage of the prince’sinitiation will begin at the hands of his “mentor” and spiritual guide. SheikhNasr grants him refuge and allows him to browse throughout the entire castlewith the exception of one room. As in all fairy tales, Janshah, naturally,transgresses the orders of Sheikh Nasr, as his destiny needs to be fulfilled,and in this forbidden place, he finds his beloved, a jinniyah of ravishingbeauty. But no sooner does he set eyes on her than she becomes a bird and fliesaway. Janshah is enraptured and a feverish passion burns in his heart at thescene of this being. In his grief, he wastes away to skin and bones. One day, hetells his secret to Sheikh Nasr who informs him his beloved is a jinniyah calledShamsah.His third stage of initiation consists of his long wait for the beloved jinniyahbecause he must linger for a whole year, when all the birds come again to thecastle. During this time, Janshah pines and laments for his belovedbird/jinniyah. He experiences the torments and afflictions of the separationfrom the beloved. The following year, Shamsah and her friends return. Janshah,as his mentor sheikh Nasr advised him, steals her feathered dress; he promisesto return it if she marries him, which she does. She stays with him for sometime, but one day she unearths her dress Janshah had hidden from her, and fliesaway. The tale continues:For the lady Shamsah had said to her parents, “Janshah loveth me with passionatelove and for sure he will follow me; for when flying from his father’s roof Icried to him, ‘If thou love me, seek me at Takni, the Castle of Jewels!’”30[Notes.xhtml#rch7en30]Janshah must embark on a second journey to recover his beloved. This signals hisfourth and last stage of initiation. The hero once again comes across a seriesof strenuous ordeals that he overcomes to be reunited with his beloved jinniyah.The Tale of Hasan al-BasriThis gripping tale’s title carries the name of a Sufi of early Islam calledal-Hasan al-Basri, which signals a special mystical tone embedded in thenarrative. It is a story of a youth named Hasan who embarks on a trip with aMagian in search of gold. He discovers that the Magian is an evil sorcerer wholeaves him on top of a mountain after collecting the jewels. Like Janshah, Hasanis lost in the wilderness. He navigates through exotic and alien places, andencounters all kinds of treacherous beings before finding a castle. Here again,the inhabitants of the castle are jinniyat living at the margins of the humanworld and, as in the story of Janshah, Hasan is forbidden to enter a certainroom. He defies the directives and encounters a beautiful jinniyat with whom hefalls frantically in love. She too, like the jinniyat Shamsah, transformsherself into a bird and flies away. He yearns and languishes for a whole year.At moments, the reader has the feeling he/she is reading again the story ofJanshah with some discrepancies.31 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en31]Like Janshah, Hasan takes his beloved jinniyah to Baghdad, his native city, andmarries her. She bears him two sons, al-Nasir and al-Mansur. As in the previousstory, one day she too flies away, and Hasan undertakes a second “initiatoryjourney” before being reunited with his beloved.These two tales exhibit the same central pattern, which is known in folklorestudies as the swan-maiden tale found across the world. Stith Thompson, one ofthe world’s leading authorities on folklore (d. 1976), summarizes the pattern asfollows,The hero in his travels comes to a body of water and sees girls bathing. On theshore he finds their swan covering, which shows him that the girls are reallytransformed swans. He seizes one of the swan coats and will not return it to themaiden unless she agrees to marry him. She does so, and, as a swan, takes him toher father’s house where she again becomes human. From this point on the storymay go in either one of two directions. The hero may be set difficult tasks bythe girl’s father and may solve them with her help. In other tales of theswan-maiden the hero is careful to hide her swan coat, so as to keep her in herhuman form. Once when he is absent, she accidentally finds the wings andfeathers, puts them on, and disappears. The main part of tales containing thismotif is concerned with the disappearance and painful recovery of the wife.32[Notes.xhtml#rch7en32]The swan-maiden is here akin to the nymph, which is considered across traditionsan emanation of the feminine, and a guardian spirit. We also know from folktalesacross the world nymphs have contracted marriages with humans. Many heroes andgods in Greek mythology, for example, are believed to be the outcome of arelationship between a man and a nymph. Water is treacherous. The feminine inwater is ensnaring and enticing. In The Nights’ stories, the dive in the watercarries cosmological symbolism. It is that of the undifferentiated, thepre-formed, and the un-manifested. Water is transmuted into a magical liquidwhen the god or the supernatural being or spirits like the jinn dive in it.Water seems to invite the two partners, the human and the alien, to fulfilltheir passion.33 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en33]In Welsh stories, the supernatural brides are always fairies, very often lakemaidens as well.34 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en34] An example of love between fairies andhumans can be found in a Celtic tale entitled “Connla and the Fairy Maiden.” Itis the story of a fairy who falls in love with the son of a king, and who thencomes to the court to declare her love to Connla of the Fiery Hair, son of Connof the Hundred Fights. The fairy gives Connla an apple and vanishes. “For awhole month from that day, Connla would take nothing, whither to eat or todrink, save only from that apple. But as he ate it, it grew again and alwayskept whole. And all the while there grew within him a mighty yearning andlonging after the maiden he had seen.”35 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en35] Finally hedecides to join his fairy maiden and the folktale ends: “So Connla and the Fairymaiden went forth on the sea, and were no more seen, nor did any know whitherthey came.”36 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en36]In Indian mythology, it is also believed the spirits of water, known as Nagi(female) and Nagini (male), often seek the love of humans. One of the legendstells the story of a love affair between one Nagi and the famous king Arjuna,the interlocutor of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita. The story goes as follows:One day, Arjuna descended to the shore of the Ganges and entered into the waterto perform his ritual ablutions. When he finished it, he was preparing himselfto go out of the river in order to celebrate the prayer of the morning, when hewas seized, he the hero with strong arms, and he was carried along to the deepwater by Ulupi, the daughter of the king of Naga [plural of Nagi], who wastormented by love of him.And Arjuna the hero entered into a marvelous palace, the palace of Kauravya, theking of the genies Naga. Arjuna asked Ulupi: “Gentle lady, what an execrable actyou have committed here! To whom belongs this splendid place, and of whom areyou the daughter?”“Prince,” she replied, “I am the daughter of the famous Kauravya, king of thegenies Naga, and my name is Ulupi. O you Tiger among men, when you entered intothe waters to perform your ablutions, the god of love enraptured my spirit! Oyou irreproachable person, know that I am not married; how can I survive, I whoam tormented by desire for you! Grant me the grace to marry me, today!”Arjuna replied: “On order of the king Yudhisthira, I made a vow of chastity fortwelve years! I am unable, O beautiful one, to act as it pleases me. However, Ipromise to satisfy you, and I have never lied in my life! Hence, O Nagini, tellme how to please you without being guilty of lying and without breaking my vow.”The Nagini replied: “If you do not act as required, know, O hero Arjuna, that Iwill commit suicide! Win a great merit, O hero with strong arms, and save mylife. I take refuge beside you, O the best of all men! You who always hadprotected and will always protect the afflicted, those without defense; you oweme protection! See my tears and my pain!” When he heard the words of the Nagi,Arjuna satisfied all her desires, through virtue. That night he spent in thepalace of the Naga, and he left only when the sun rose, in the early morning.(Mahabharata 1.216)37 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en37]There is more than water and attraction in these tales, which I found repletewith symbols. The symbol of the swan combines the two elements of air and water.As for the jinniyat, they connect with opposite elements such as water and fire.They fly and swim in two different mediums: air and water. Jinn hate immobilityand constancy. And those who love them in these stories imitate their incessantroving. The element fire of which the jinn are composed stirs ardent passions inhumans that only the encounter with the jinni or jiniyyah quenches. In theirmetamorphosis into birds or swans, jinn become overcharged with spirituality.After all, birds are a symbol for the soul across traditions, from the AncientEgyptian Book of the Dead to Hinduism where the Supreme Swan refers to the Selfor Reality.There is another set of symbols worth decoding. It is related to the twojourneys both Janshah and Hasan undertake. In the two tales, love is revealed ina flash; it is like a vision the hero perceives, or maybe an illusion he triesto decipher. It is a swift contact with beings from the hidden realm, as one ofthe swan-maidens explains to Janshah when he enquires about their nature: “’Whoare ye, o illustrious Princesses, and whence come ye?’ Replied the youngestdamsel, ‘We are from the invisible world of Almighty Allah and we come hither todivert ourselves.’”38 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en38]The hero witnesses the irruption of the swan/jinniyah from behind the veil,hidden in his corner. Filled with passion, he literally dies to the world tolive only in the vision he witnessed until the second apparition of thejinniyah, when he resurrects to capture her. He must demonstrate to himself thatalthough the jinniyah is from the hidden realm, she is not an illusion but aspirit from the unseen manifesting herself in our physical world.The Tale of Sayf al-Muluk and the Jinniyah Badi‘at al-JamalThe third tale, “Prince Sayf al-Muluk and the Princess Badi‘at al-Jamal,” isalso a love story between a human and a jinniyah. Sayf al-Muluk discovers apicture of this jinniyah at home, wrapped in a bundle of cloth his father, theking, gave him on the day of his coronation. Immediately, he is infatuated withher: “He spread it out and saw on the lining of the back the portraiturewroughten in gold of a girl and marvelous was her loveliness; and no sooner hadhe set eyes on the figure than his reason fled his head and he became jinn-madfor love thereof, so that he fell down in a swoon and presently recovering,began to weep and lament, beating his face and breast and kissing her.”39[Notes.xhtml#rch7en39]Sayf al-Muluk decides to search for the jinniyah of the picture, whose name isBadi‘at al-Jamal. Like Janshah and Hasan, he endures many trials until hereaches India and China. When he finally encounters her, she refuses to marryhim, on the grounds all humans are unfaithful. He ultimately succeeds inconvincing her of the falsehood of this assertion, and they get married. It isnoteworthy that the refusal of the jinnyyah could be seen as Sheherazade’srevenge because most men in The Nights believe women are wily and unworthy oftheir trust. One can see in the three stories a return to the myth of thegoddess, with the three jinniyat representing patterns of feminine ascendancyhumans almost worship.All three tales display an inevitable and mesmeric attraction exerted byspiritual entities on humans. They also reveal the same motives of initiation:the youth who leaves for the first time his protective home; the adventure thatoccurs at a crucial age in his life when he needs to be initiated into theother, the feminine, the ying, the hidden part of his own self; the motif of thecastle where the beloved is found in the first place, lost for a time, and thenrecaptured. The castle in the three tales is not to be found on the map. It is,rather, timeless and placeless, where the hero enters to be trained in thesecrets of the invisible by a sheikh. The castle itself is the intersectingpoint of two levels of reality: the human one and the jinn one, the seen and theunseen. Finally, it is captivating that beings from the two realms of thevisible and the invisible worlds travel freely form one realm to the other. Thehero undertakes a trip to the jinn world to recapture his beloved jinniyah. Thelatter leaves behind her home and family and accompanies her human husband tohis world. The movement from one dimension to the other is constantly open bothways. From the perspective of these Muslim folktales, it is quite natural forhumans and jinn to constantly circulate between the two realms as the scripturesand the tradition certify, while many folktales and fairy tales in the Westdisplay rather preserved domains for each species. In medieval Frenchliterature, for example, two particular kinds of tales exist about the FairyMorgan and the Fairy Melusine. The tales woven around Fairy Melusine arecharacterized by the fact the fairy agrees to leave her fairyland in the forestand comes to live with her human lover among humans, while in the tales wovenaround Fairy Morgan the human agrees to leave his life among humans and followsthe fairy to her domain. But there is no possibility for travel from one realmto the other. It is once again the paradigm of either/or.40[Notes.xhtml#rch7en40]MAJNUN LAILA AND THE JINNGenerally speaking, the notion of excessive love, called ‘ishq, was perceived aspernicious in classical Islam. Popular books were written to elucidate itsdangers. Lovers were warned of the consequences of extreme passions, which couldlead to all kinds of mental disorders, particularly epileptic fits, to madness,and even to death. One of the interesting books on ‘ishq was written by Ja’faral-Sarraj (d. 1106), and entitled “masari‘ al-‘ushaq,” which literally means“The lovers’ [path to] death.” Al-Sarraj compiled various anecdotes related toexcessive love. There is also a whole chapter entitled “Lovers from the jinn” inwhich the author narrates alleged love affairs between jinn and humans.41[Notes.xhtml#rch7en41]In the same vein, one can classify the verse of the poet Qays ibn al-Mulawwah(d. 668), surnamed Majnun Laila.42 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en42] His love story becamefamous in Islam like the romance of Romeo and Juliet in the West, especiallyafter many Sufis took their inspiration from it to express their ecstaticstates. They found in the poet’s woes something analogous to their pain of beingseparated from the Divine.The story of Majnun Laila is that of a man estranged from his beloved, who wasforced to marry another man. When Majnun knew about this marriage, he ran awayfrom his tribe and Laila’s neighborhood. He roamed deserts and wilderness insearch for something that could quell his thirst for Laila. In his wanderings,Majnun reaches the edge where reality and imagination interpenetrate.Relentlessly and hopelessly, the poet endeavors to capture the image of theabsent beloved. Laila appears in his verse akin to those women/jinniyatmentioned in the stories above, whose presence is elusive, prevailing, andinexorable.Distance and excruciating pain compel Qays to rapidly drift toward the non-humanand the unseen realms. He wanders naked among animals and snakes, and lives incaves. As French writer Jean-Claude Vadet maintains, Majnun himself becomessimilar to one of the jinn.43 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en43] It is not true the jinninspire him, as As‘ad Khairallah, contemporary Lebanese critic, maintained.44[Notes.xhtml#rch7en44] Although it was known jinn inspire poets and, often, thedaemonic and the poetic thrive side by side, the case of Majnun is different.Majnun has forsaken the world of humans, and integrated himself with theirrational forces of nature. The legend tells that people were even afraid ofhim, and often wondered if he were a jinni.Away from his beloved, Majnun hallucinates, often identifying Laila with thedeer. Whenever he sees one, he sings his love for her. He talks to the deer andasks her if she is not Laila or at least Laila’s sister.45[Notes.xhtml#rch7en45] As we have seen, people claimed jinn dwell in deer. Whena hunter wanted to kill a deer he captured, Majnun would offer him all he had tofree the poor animal.The help of his family and friends were of no avail, for Majnun continued tolive in delusion seeking his missing love.46 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en46] Having leftbehind the world of humans, Majnun, in one verse, desperately calls upon aphysician from the jinn to cure him: “O doctor of the jinn, woe unto you, findme a cure, for the doctor of humans is helpless against my ill.”47[Notes.xhtml#rch7en47]The internal violence of passion is mingled with the harshness of the wildernesswhere the poet wanders. The dark cave where Majnun chose to live instigateschthonic forces. Majnun, at the end of the book, is found dead, far from hisfamily and friends, in the land of the non-human.Sufis in turn brought into play the legend of Majnun, especially in the book ofthe Sufi Ganjavi Nizami (d. 1209) precisely entitled Majnun Laila. In thisromantic epic, Majnun, the lover, is the Sufi himself, and his object of love isnone other than God. Majnun in this Sufi version is even closer to the animalkingdom and the elements. Like Majnun, the lover often stumbles into the kind ofabsence we call fainting. Between sleep and awareness, he grasps, as if in aglance, the borderline that separates the invisible realm from the manifest oneand illusion from reality. The correlations with the jinn shapes are numerous inNizami’s verse. Majnun seems to have borrowed from the jinn their secrecy,invisibility, and elusiveness. The emaciated body of the lover, his nakedness,his sojourn among the beasts, and his distance from humans almost correlate withthat of a jinni that lives in the ruins, and that has forsaken human company. Inone verse, Nizami describes how Majnun roamed deserts and mountains after heheard of Laila’s death, crying aloud her name: Climbs to the mountain’s brow, over hill and plain Urged quicker onwards by his burning brain, Across the desert’s arid boundary hies; Zayd, like his shadow, following where he flies; And when the tomb of Laili [Laila] meets his view; Prostrate he falls, the ground his tears bedew; Rolling distraught, he spreads his arms to clasp The sacred temple, writhing like an asp, Despair and horror swell in his ceaseless moan, And still he clasps the monumental stone.48 [Notes.xhtml#rch7en48]The allusions to the asp evoke the jinn who are thought to embody the shapes ofsnakes. Like them, the possessed lover creeps between the stones, wriggles, andwrithes like any slinking lizard.CONCLUSIONThese alleged love stories between jinn and humans, whether in The Nights or inother classical Muslim sources, have almost no sexuality. I argue this isbecause of the subtle and shape-shifting nature of the jinni or the jinniyahwhose love for a human remains elusive and intangible despite the jinn’sembodiment in physical forms. This claimed passion between a human and aspiritual entity resembles some kind of evanescence, almost a loss of consciencethat engulfs the human in its mysterious darkness. It is a kind of withdrawalfrom the world. Sexuality is of a totally different order, more substantial andmore concrete. It cannot thrive in an indefinable relationship such as this.This love is depicted as stronger than the love between two humans; it may bebecause of the strangeness of the spiritual partner and the curiosity othernesstriggers in the human.It is an uneven relation between a mortal and a spiritual entity in which thelatter has always more operational power than the human who seems in most of ourstories subjugated and infatuated at the same time."},{"pageContent":"8Jinn Inspiring Poets He was bizarre, a man made out of brass . . . He said to me, “Recite some poetry!” Then he recited poetry to me. I said: “Who are you?” He said, “I am your double from the jinn!” That is how I started reciting poetry. — Umayayd love poet, Kuthayyir ‘Azzah (d. 723)1[Notes.xhtml#rch8en1]Jinn meddle in the lives of humans as lovers, warriors, teachers, helpers, orhealers. They also manifest themselves in mystifying modes in the lives andverses of Arab and Muslim poets. Jinn’s incursion reveals itself sometimes as awhispering, sometimes as a powerful voice from another world which calls uponpoets, drowns them into its inebriated power, and commands them to write itswords. These stubborn spirits seem to display a staunch and mysterious powerpoets rarely can resist. Their insidious storming of the poets’ intimacy isenthralling and subjugating. Many in classical Islam described this “contact”with jinn as the source of their writing. Many mused in their verses on theorigin and nature of these spirits: are they coming from deep inside the humanwell or rather dashing from outside the forests of nature?POETICAL INSPIRATION BEFORE ISLAMIt is known that seminal mythological texts in the world were written andchanted in rhymed prose. In Sumerian mythology—which goes back four thousandyears before the Christian era—the tragedy of the goddess Inanna and her descentin the underworld, as well as the Sumerian epic of the hero Gilgamesh, are bothbrought to us through rhyme. Similarly, most of the old epics of humanity wereconveyed in verse-like language, from the Odyssey to the Nordic Edda. Themagnificence of the poetical text and the melody of its rhyme, whether in epics,myths, or religious texts, imbued poets with a particular aura. Poetry wasconsidered sacred, “the language of the gods,” and the first language ofhumanity that carried within it an unfathomable and hypnotic power.2[Notes.xhtml#rch8en2] Some poets, such as Orpheus and Empedocles, were evenconsidered divine, possessing supernatural talents. Their poetry was mysteriousand tinged with the shadows of the invisible.In the Greek tradition, for example, the poet is described as being themouthpiece of the Muses who were nine in number, the so-called daughters of Zeusand Mnemosyme (memory). Greek poets often began their poems by invoking themuse, as in the Odyssey, where Homer begs her to enthuse him: “Sing in me, Muse,and through me tell the story of that man skilled in all ways of contending.”3[Notes.xhtml#rch8en3] In this tradition, the god of poetry is Apollo, the sundeity who drives his fiery chariot across the skies. But it is primarily inPlato’s ion one discovers a thorough discussion of poetic inspiration. Platoconveys the idea poets are channels for a superior power that invests them withits knowledge. In this sense, poetry is not the result of the poets’ work; it isnot similar to reasoning, and doesn’t have its source in the determination ofthe will. Socrates mentions the case of Tynnichos of Chalcis who was a mediocrepoet until the god chose him to sing divinely beautiful songs: “that welisteners may know that it is not they who utter these precious revelationswhile their mind is not within them, but that it is the god himself who speaks,and through them becomes articulate to us.”4 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en4]People in the pre-Islamic Arabian Peninsula likewise believed poets receivedtheir inspiration from a hidden source, from the invisible world of the jinn.5[Notes.xhtml#rch8en5] The latter were thought to follow the poets and read outto them verses of majestic beauty. Arabs at that time honored their poetsbecause their words resembled those of seers.The likeness between soothsayers and poets comes also from the fact they bothused rhymed speech. It is interesting to note prophets too recourse to a similarlanguage. The words of all three are filled with alliterations, parallelisms,elliptic formulas, forewarnings, and imprecations.6 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en6]The belief in a spirit guiding the poet’s pen was not limited to old traditions.In fact, it was revived and embraced during the Romantic period. In a letter tohistorical painter and writer Benjamin R. Haydon (d. 1846), Keats (d. 1821)wrote: “I remember you saying that you had notions of a good Genius presidingover you—I have of late had the same thought.”7 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en7]Analogous to the inspiration brought by the Muse, or the Genius to the Greekpoet, and later to the Romantic poets is the stimulation brought by the Duendeto the Spanish poet. The Duende is also similar to the Muse or the jinni in thatthe poet, in both cases, has no control over its manifestations. The Spanishpoet too feels helpless and baffled in front of this divine and devastatingpower. He senses the force of inspiration climbs into him from the feet to thethroat. He fights with it in vain, and finally surrenders to its invasion.Federico Garcia Lorca (d. 1936) is one of the most eloquent exponents of theDuende: “Before reading his poems in front of the audience, the first thing onemust do is to invoke the Duende.”8 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en8]The source from which the poetical inspiration flows can even be the HolySpirit. It was believed Christian English poet John Milton (d. 1674) was carriedthrough Paradise Lost by the descent of the Holy Spirit.9 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en9]Throughout the Christian Middle Ages, and even afterwards, poets sought the helpof the Greek god Apollo in the composition of their verses. This god wasidentified with the monotheistic Spirit itself. Dante (d. 1321) promised tocrown himself with a wreath from the Apollonian tree, the laurel.10[Notes.xhtml#rch8en10]Even as modern a poet as American Jack Spicer (d. 1965) talked about “dictation”as the source of his poetry, and struggled with it in terms of its origin,whether from psychic movements within him or from outside him altogether.11[Notes.xhtml#rch8en11]THE QUR’ANIC CONCEPTION OF POETRYThe word in Arabic for poet is sha‘ir, which means literally “the one who feels,who perceives.” Poetry in the Arab/Muslim world has always been considered abona fide form of knowledge inexplicably received from the invisible. Thisnotion persisted in Islam as well as the tradition of the poet accompanied by ajinni. Arab and Muslim accounts speak of a flowing and unremitting dialoguebetween poets and their inspirers. Early Islam poet Hassan ibn Thabit (d. 674)spoke of his own jinni who always followed him and helped him write the verse,as shall be seen later in this chapter.However, some changes were introduced to this relationship between poets andjinn. To better understand the modifications that occurred, I will elucidatefirst the concept of poetry as it appears in the Qur’an. In many verses, theQur’an maintains Arabs in the beginning rejected the prophethood of Muhammadbecause they perceived him as a poet rather than a prophet. In Qur’an 21:5, weread: “Nay, but they say: [A muddled jumble of dreams!] Nay, he has forged it;nay, he is a poet! Now therefore let him bring us a sign, even as the ancientones were sent as messengers.”The Qur’an replies to the Prophet’s opponents, and differentiates betweenpoetical inspiration thought to come from the jinn and revelation bestowed uponMuhammad through the intermediacy of the angel Gabriel: “We have not taught himpoetry; It is not seemly for him. It is only a Remembrance and a clear Qur’an”(Qur’an 36:69).12 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en12] Moreover, the Qur’an disparages thepoets of pre-Islam who concoct things unrelated to reality, and pay heed only totheir egos: “And the poets—the perverse follow them; Hast thou not seen how theywander in every valley and how they say things they do not do? Save those thatbelieve, and do righteous deeds, and remember God [repeatedly], and helpthemselves after being wronged” (Qur’an 26:225–26).The Qur’an does not, however, condemn poetry as such. It is reported Muhammadalluded at several occasions to his own fascination with rhetoric. He once saidto Hassan ibn Thabit, after listening to one of his poems: “The Holy Spirit iswith you!”13 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en13] By that, Muhammad meant the poet receivesthe spiritual influence and sings it back to the world. It should be mentioned,however, the poetry of Hassan became completely devoted to Islam after hisconversion to the new religion to the point he was called “the Prophet’s poet.”Whether Muhammad was praising poetry in general, or just the poetry devoted tothe faith, remains unresolved.Be that as it may, the verse of Hassan ibn Thabit, as well as that of otherpoets, contributed to the creation of a new and different poetry after theadvent of Islam. It is noteworthy most of this new verse was not dedicated tothe praise of the new religion. In fact, erotic and wine poetry was moreprevalent than religious poetry. This prompted literary critic Ihsan ‘Abbas (b.1920) to maintain, “Islam did not prohibit the idea of jinn as inspirer topoets. It rather acknowledged that poets have their independent imaginary world,and this is the meaning of [Qur’anic verse] ‘they roam in every valley.’”14[Notes.xhtml#rch8en14]Islamic civilization soon developed a sophisticated culture of both Arabianmusic and dance. Cities such as Madinah, Mecca, and Ta’if played a major role inhelping poetry and singing to burgeon. Poems were sung by great singers, such asibn Surayj (d. 726). And people flocked to Mecca to listen to the love poetry of‘Umar ibn abi Rabi‘ah (d. 711) and others. Luxury, refinement, sophistication,and art proliferated in cities like Damascus, Mecca, and al-Hirah.POETS INTERACT WITH THE JINN IN ISLAMAn Imaginal Parallel WorldAndalusian poet Abu ‘Amir ibn Shuhayd (d. 1035) tackles most of the issuesrelated to jinn and poets in Islam in his book entitled The Treatise of FamiliarSpirits and Demons.15 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en15] This work remains one of the mostoriginal texts written in Arabic on this subject. In his introduction to theTreatise, ibn Shuhayd unveils the motives behind writing his book. After thedeath of his beloved, he desired to write an elegy to her memory, but he wasbeleaguered by grief. Suddenly, his inspiring jinni, by the name of Zuhayr ibnNumayr, appeared before him and assisted him in composing the poem. The jinnimentions to the poet he belongs to the banu Ashja‘, which is the poet’s tribe.As I mentioned in the second chapter of this book, it is alleged the jinn’ssociety is modeled after the human’s one. It is a kind of parallel world, so ifthere is a human tribe by the name of banu Ashja‘, then there should be a jinntribe by the same name.From that time onward, the jinni of ibn Shuhayd would appear to him whenever heneeded assistance. Soon, he becomes to him a helper and a kind of spiritualmaster who carries him to the country of the jinn to visit the inspirers offamous poets of both pre-Islam and Islam. In the “land of the jinn,” ibn Shuhaydmeets the jinn of many poets who lived before him, such as the jinni ofpre-Islamic poet Imru’ al-Qays (d. 540) who appeared as “a knight riding aglowing mare.”16 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en16] The jinni of al-Buhturi (d. 897) lookslike “a gracious adolescent carrying a lance in his hand, and who came toward uson a white-spotted horse.”17 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en17] As for the jinni of Tarafah(d. 569), the author of the longest of the Seven Odes in the celebratedcollection of pre-Islamic poetry, the mu‘allaqat, he described him as “abeautiful knight bearing a sword.”18 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en18]These jinn inspirers look more like human poets than spiritual beings comingfrom another world. The similarity with medieval Arab society is overwhelming.Like their poets, the jinn inspirers are knights, are armed, and have horses.Ibn Shuhayd, obviously, is intent on producing a copy of the humans’ society. Iargue this is because of his strong belief in the parallelism of the two worldsof jinn and humans, as depicted in the religious sources where both intelligentspecies are thought to correspond in many ways. Many poets in the pre-Islamictime, as well as in classical Islam, immortalized their bonds to their jinninspirers in their poetry. The affinity between both comes up as even morestrange than if these poets had created a fantastic world.19[Notes.xhtml#rch8en19]The notion of a world parallel to ours inhabited by spiritual beings that actlike us is indeed more “alien” to us than the “fantastic” we meet in ourreadings and visual arts. In a way, this kind of fantastic has been continuallyrepeated to the point it became almost ordinary.Two Different Jinn Inspirers for One PoetMany Arab poets told of their encounters with two jinn inspirers instead of one.It is related, for example, al-Qays had two different inspirers. There is noagreement between critics on the exact names of his jinn inspirers.20[Notes.xhtml#rch8en20]Compiler Abu Zaid al-Qurashi (d. 786), for example, explains as follows thereason for the existence of two jinn inspirers instead of one: “A man came tothe poet al-Farazdaq [d. 728] and recited a verse to him and asked him hisopinion. The poet answered by saying that, ‘Poetry has two jinn. One of them iscalled Hawbar and the other is called Hawjal. If Hawbar is your inspirer, thenyour poetry is good, but if your inspirer is Hawjal, then your poetry is bad.Both were your inspirers in this verse. Hawbar inspired the first part of it,and Hawjal inspired the second part of it, and he damaged it!’”21[Notes.xhtml#rch8en21]These two inspirers are almost homonyms, which could convey either a resemblanceor an opposition. Briefly, they look like pairs.The Command to ReciteIn al-Aghani, this compendium of literature of classical Islam, one finds manystories about jinn following Muslim poets. For example, Umayayd love poetKuthayyir ‘Azzah (d. 723) was once asked, “When did you start reciting poetry?”He replied, “I did not start reciting poetry until it was recited to me.” Thenhe was asked, “And how was that?” He replied, “One day, I was in a place calledGhamim, near Madinah. It was noon. A man on horseback came toward me until hewas next to me. I looked at him. He was bizarre, a man made out of brass; heseemed to be dragging himself along. He said to me, ‘Recite some poetry!’ Thenhe recited poetry to me. I said: ‘Who are you?’ He said, ‘I am your double fromthe jinn!’ That is how I started reciting poetry.”22 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en22]This story is interesting on many levels. The poet seems to play the role of arawi rather than that of a poet. The rawi (the reciter) was the person who wouldfollow the poet, and whose function was to memorize his poetry for it not to belost. In this story, Kuthayyer seems to be the one to memorize the verse whilethe jinni is the real poet.Although he didn’t compose the verse, Kuthayyir developed into a poet when herecited what was “dictated” to him. In other terms, he identified with thejinni’s voice. From where did this “double” come: from the murky waters of theself, or from the imaginal realm where the jinn are supposed to lurk, or morelikely from both?The Gender of the InspirerAs in pre-Islam, the gender of the spiritual entity inspiring the poet remainednoticeably masculine. Hassan ibn Thabit told of his encounter with his inspirerhe addressed as “my brother the jinni.”23 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en23]When the poet designates the jinni as “brother,” he is insinuating intimacy andfamiliarity with the spiritual entity. The poet might also be looking at thejinni as his alter ego, a double or a shadow with whom he converses, and fromwhom he draws his words. This dialogue between the visible poet and the“invisible source of inspiration” takes place in an introspective environmentwhere the poet is absorbed in his feelings, and engrossed in his thoughts andvision.Talking about one’s inspirer or even one’s double as of a close presence iscommon to many traditions. Yeats (d. 1939), in a poem written in 1915 entitled“Ego Dominus Tuus,” described also his haunting “other” as one who “shall lookmost like me, being indeed my double.”24 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en24]One wonders, however, when reading the poets of classical Islam, why spiritsthat inspired the poets are often masculine. Is this simply because of thecentrality of the male in the Arab/Muslim medieval society in his many roles ofwarrior, chief of the tribe or the clan, and poet? And why are the Muses in theWest mostly feminine? English writer Robert Graves (b. 1895), specialist inclassical literature, depicts this feminine aspect of inspiration as follows:“The reason why the hairs stand on end, the eyes water, the throat isconstricted, the skin crawls, and a shiver runs down the spine when one writesor reads a true poem, is that a true poem is necessarily an invocation of theWhite Goddess, or Muse, the Mother of All Living, the ancient power of frightand lust—the female spider or the queen-bee whose embrace is death.”25[Notes.xhtml#rch8en25]Although one could reject the insistence on the “masculine” inspirer in Islam,one couldn’t accept the image Graves gives of the feminine Muse. Not only is itnot very flattering, but also pejorative, because this feminine entity is anepitome of fear, death, and lust. Both Hassan ibn Thabit and Graves lack thevision of the mysterious and highly spiritual feminine.Rejecting the Jinn’s InspirationThe idea of a jinni inspiring the poet weakened in some significant way at thebeginning of the fourth century of Islam, especially in Baghdad where theMu‘tazilite School of philosophy gave priority to reason over inspiration, andaffected all fields of Islamic thought. Two poets especially rejected openly andcategorically the notion of inspiration by the jinn. The first one was Abu Nuwas(d. 810), whose odes immortalized the wine taverns of Baghdad. He made a jinnikneel down in submission in one of his poems. The second poet was Bashshar ibnBurd (d. 783), a blind and licentious poet who celebrated Eros magnificently. Hedeclined the inspiration of Shiniqanaq (one of the most famous chiefs of thejinn) in a well-known verse: “Shiniqanaq called me to ride behind him. I said,‘Leave me alone—I prefer solitude.’”26 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en26]At the same time, some poets went so far as to ridicule other poets who blindlyaccepted their jinni’s inspiration. The debate between the two camps isepitomized in the following dialogue: “One poet said to another, ‘I compose apoem every hour, and you compose a poem every month! How come?’ The latterreplied: ‘Because I don’t accept from my jinni what you accept from yours!’”27[Notes.xhtml#rch8en27]It must be noted this dismissal of the jinn’s inspiration existed already inpre-Islam. It was not, however, very widely known. ‘Amru ibn Kulthum (d. 584)nicknamed the poets who accepted the jinn’s inspiration “dogs of the jinn.”28[Notes.xhtml#rch8en28]One can clearly see two conceptions of poetry in these squabbles. Poets ofreason insinuated it is only the craft that brings about a good verse, whilepoets of inspiration asserted over and over poetry springs solely from aninvisible spiritual source. These disagreements between the two visions ofpoetry exist across traditions. Czeslaw Milosz, Lithuanian–Polish poet who wonthe 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature, criticized this belief in spiritual entitiesas inspirers as follows: “What reasonable man would like to be a city of demons,who behave as if they were at home, speak many tongues, and who, not satisfiedwith stealing his lips or hand, work at changing his destiny for theirconvenience?”29 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en29]Each poet has a particular attention to the source of inspiration, whoselocation is sometimes determined as inside of the self and sometimes outside ofit. Some poets are more turned to the realm within, while others are more alertto the world outside of them. But isn’t it the same power, voice, and entitythat is captured differently?The Risks of Having Jinn as InspirersWhether in pre-Islam or in Islam, a poet often acknowledges he might risk hislife if he accepts the assistance of the jinn. Jinn could abduct him, or hecould become mad.30 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en30] A poet born in pre-Islam andconverted to Islam by the name of ibn al-Sharqi was one night passing near theencampments of the jinn tribe of Banu ‘Amir when the jinn carried him away totheir land “in a span of time shorter than the flight of a bird.”31[Notes.xhtml#rch8en31] He remained with them for three years. Some poets becametotally insane after their “sojourn” in the land of the jinn. Early Islam poetJarir (d. 728) referred to this state of affairs when he said, “It is possibleto cure people from physical disease, but not from the insanity incurred afterstaying with jinn! Only jinn can cure those whom they enthralled.”32[Notes.xhtml#rch8en32]In Irish folklore too, the Muses were believed to persecute poets and bringlunacy upon them as Yeats maintains: “The Leanhaum Shee [fairy mistress] seeksthe love of mortals. She is the Gaelic Muse for she gives inspiration to thoseshe persecutes. The Gaelic poets die young for she is restless, and will not letthem remain long on earth—this malignant phantom.”33 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en33]THE ALLEGED JINN’S POETRYAs we have seen earlier in this chapter, a jinni commanded Hassan ibn Thabit torecite his jinni poetry. Jinn boasted not only that they put the words in themouths of poets, but also that their poetry is by far better than that ofhumans, when and if the latter ever write it.As for those poems attributed to the jinn and scattered in medieval Arabsources, we have no knowledge whatsoever of their real authors. One finds,however, a thorough discussion of the poetical jinn’s superiority in Risalatal-Ghufran, the Epistle For Forgiveness, a monumental book of divine comedywritten by al-Ma‘arri (d. 1057). The narrator encounters in his travel to thejinn’s paradise, Abu Hadrash, one of the jinn’s great ancestors. He asks himabout the poetry of the jinn and about their [lost] collection of poems entitledash‘ar al-jinn (odes of the jinn). Hadrash arrogantly replies: “What humans knowabout poetry except what cows know about cosmology and geodesy? Humans havefifteen kinds of meters poets rarely go beyond, while we have thousands ofmeters humans have never heard of.”34 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en34] Furthermore, thejinni adds that he himself composed poems eons before God created Adam.35[Notes.xhtml#rch8en35] The narrator then seems tempted to write down some of thejinni’s poetry. However, he remembers he memorized and put down the poetry ofothers in his earthly life. So he refrains from doing it this time inparadise.36 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en36]Once again, it seems we have no access to the poetical treasure of the jinn orto their authors. All we know is humans claim the jinn wrote poetry that isbetter than theirs. It is alleged, for example, jinn portray themselves asprotectors of animals, and particularly of serpents. We have previouslydiscussed that jinn are thought to embody serpents. They appear to humans andrecite poetry to them whenever the latter abuse an animal in general, or kill aserpent in particular. In their poetry, the jinn talk about their own lives andhabits, their relations to animals as in this verse: “I rode on all mounts butfound none/Nicer and more desirable than the mount of wolves.”37[Notes.xhtml#rch8en37]It is also maintained the jinn’s verse is not limited to discussing poeticalmatters, animals, or their relationships with humans. The latter seem to haveheavily involved them in all their political and religious discussions, inpre-Islam and in Islam as well. The jinn’s poetry was used or rather invented,particularly in early Islam, to defend the new religion and to criticize itsenemies. One finds, for example, verses of praise to the Prophet and hiscompanions were assigned to the jinn. It is also alleged the jinn recited poetryof lamentations at the death of the Prophet’s grandson, al-Hussein in the holyplace of Karbala’, where al-Hussein was assassinated, and where his tomb remainsone of the greatest Muslim shrines.38 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en38] It is also allegedthe jinn lamented the death of the second Caliph of lslam, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab.We are even told ‘A’ishah, the wife of the Prophet, heard jinn mourning hisdeath before it actually occurred. In the same vein, people claimed the jinnbewailed the Prophet’s mother.39 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en39]WHO IS THE AUTHOR?If one accepts that poetry is inspired by a spiritual entity outside of the poetand that it puts the words in the mouths of poets, then one wonders: Who is theauthor? Is it the jinni that inspires and dictates, or is it the poet whoreceives and memorizes? Captivatingly enough, sometimes a poet acknowledges heshares his poetical terrain with his inspirer, as in this verse of Hassan ibnThabit (d. 674): “My follower [jinni] is from banu Shaysaban. Sometimes, it ishe who recites poetry. Sometimes it is I.”40 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en40]Sharing the “poetical terrain” means the poet is constantly shifting fromabsence when it is the “other” (the jinni) who recites poetry, to awareness,when it is the poet himself who declaims the verse. The poet here mentions adifferent entity than himself is partaking of the verse. Poetry thus becomes theplace par excellence where diverse psychological states manifest themselves withall transparency. It is the home where the self becomes aware of itself for amoment, then recedes, leaving a blank space to be swiftly filled by anotherpower, be it jinni, Muse, or Duende.Many stories were told in pre-Islam and in Islam of this participation betweenpoet and jinni/inspirer. The following intriguing story is narrated about thepoet al-‘A’shah (d. 625), whose jinni was called Mish‘al. It is told al-‘A’shahwas once on a journey to Hadramout, in Yemen, when all of a sudden he lost hisway. He came upon a tent, and went inside. The host welcomed him, and asked himabout his identity. The poet responded, “I am al-‘A’shah.” At this, his hoststarted declaiming poetry to him. The poet was bewildered, for his host wasreciting his own poetry back to him, in which he describes a girl namedSumayyah. Utterly baffled, the poet asked him, “Do you know who is Sumayyah?”The host called for Sumayyah, who came out before them. Al-‘A’shah began toshiver and shudder. Finally, his host told him he was Mish‘al, his jinniinspirer.41 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en41]Many points merit discussion here. First, al-‘A’shah doesn’t recognize hisjinni. The familiarity between poet and jinni varies from one poet to another.Although Hassan seems to live with his follower jinni, al-‘A’shah doesn’t evenrecognize his when he meets him in the tent, although he too mentions him in hisverse. Al-‘A’shah’s case looks more like a vision in the desert that lasts for ashort while. The poet lost his way and found himself in a tent. Moreover, thebeloved he describes in his poetry is standing in front of him, alive and true,or so it seems. The world he imagined in his poetry is now made existent outsideof him. His tremor comes from grasping in a second the imaginary realm of thepoem that was within is now actual and exterior to the self. More shocking forhim is he is no longer the inventor of this imaginary realm; someone else seemsto own it. The poet is shattered because he is confronted with his own identity,so to speak.More complex and gripping is the fact that sometimes the poet’s jinni doesn’tacknowledge his task is to inspire. He completely negates the authorship of thepoet whom he assisted, as we read in al-Aghani, as in this following story:A traveler asked a jinni, “Who is the best poet among the Arabs?” The jinnireplied, “Lafiz ibn Lahiz, Hiyab, Habid, and Hadhir ibn Mahir.” The travelersaid, “These names are new to me!” The jinni answered, “Oh well! Lafiz is thejinni of the poet Imru’ al-Qays (d. 540), Habid is the jinni of the poet ‘Abidibn al-Abras [d. before 540], and Hathir is the jinni of the poet [al-Nabighah],Ziyad al-Dhubyani [d. 604].”42 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en42]Here, there is sameness between poets and jinn, to the point it becomessuperfluous to distinguish between giver and taker. This identicalness isclearly evoked in the Treatise of Familiar Spirits and Demons of ibn Shuhayd.Thus, the jinni of the Abasside poet Abu Nuwas (d. 812) is always drunk, andsurrounded by wine jars just like the poet he inspires. The jinni of the poetal-Mutanabbi (d. 965), on the other hand, is always boasting, like the poethimself, well known for his bloated pride. Significantly, ibn Shuhayd gives thefloor to the jinn rather than to the poets. By doing this, he is implyinginspiration is the foundation of poetry, while craft is only secondary.CONCLUSIONI have tried to elucidate the view that depicts the poet as being visited bysome kind of spiritual entity, such as the Muses, the jinn, or—harking back toLorca’s definition—the Duende. However, a second view, considerably more down toearth, depicts a poet as an intensive laborer, achieving his or her abilitiesand perfecting his or her skills by dint of constant practice. The first viewsees a poet as a person who is gifted, graced in an almost supernatural way withthat which is defined as poetry. In the second view, a poet becomes so from theground up, as it were, by means of a purely rational route.The concept of inspiration as coming from the jinn should not imply totalpassivity on the part of the poet who simply submits to the jinn’s reciting theverses that he then composes as his own. It was a well-known fact in Arabicpoetry some poets would work endlessly their poems, continuously polishing themto the point they were called the slaves of poetry, and their poems were calledal-hawliyyat (the chronicles), meaning a poet would spend a great length of timeproducing the poem. It was also known a poet would act as the rawi of an elderpoet, which means he would receive training under him by assiduously studyingthe elder’s work to be able to recite it properly. In this regard, the poetal-Hutay’ah (d. 674) was the reciter of the poet Zuhayr ibn abi Sulma (d. 609),and the poet Kuthayr ‘Azzah (d. 723) was the reciter of the poet Jamil Buthainah(d. 701).43 [Notes.xhtml#rch8en43]In the context of the present study, it is important to point out not alltraditions across the world have stressed a similar concept of inspiration ascoming from the Muses, jinn, or Duende. The Far Eastern tradition, for instance,seems to be devoid of such a concept. There is not in Chinese poetics, forexample, a possession by a spiritual entity, or the idea of a poet receiving hisor her poem from a Muse. In these traditions, greatly inspired by Buddhism andparticularly by Zen, poetry springs from silence and contemplation, which arethe two meditative conditions that encourage inspiration.44[Notes.xhtml#rch8en44] As James J. Y. Liu (d. 1986) writes in The Art of ChinesePoetry, “The poet, like the follower of Zen, should seek to attain to a calmcontemplative state of mind. When one has achieved this, one can then hope tocapture the spirit (shen) of life, of Nature, in one’s poetry.”45[Notes.xhtml#rch8en45]This last assertion simply means what we call jinn, Duende, Daemons, or Musecould come from inside the poet, if he/she listens in silence to the self. As Ihave tried to demonstrate throughout this book, and in this chapter inparticular, the jinn could be hidden powers within the poet’s self and outsideof him as well. The poet’s mind and imagination could create these spiritsoutside the self, making possible all kinds of interaction with them; he/shealso could get them from where they lie dormant in the psyche, and slowly bringthem to light."},{"pageContent":"ConclusionThe Sentience of Inside Out/Outside InThe exploration of the jinn’s concept underscores that we and the universe aremade from the same fabric. Each resembles the other. Most significantly, bothare incessantly in contact. Like the human, the universe has a soul and is aliving body. This is what our ancestors called “Anima Mundi,” or “the Soul ofthe world.” Both are endowed with intelligence. Plato (d. 347 BCE) evoked in theTimaeus the universe as a living being, a vital force that embraces all otherliving entities, which by their nature are all linked.Quantum physics and traditional societies teach us the world of mental meaningand that of physical reality are not separate. They flow into each other. Thisis what Hinduism refers to as the Vedanta, which is a state of non-duality, ofawareness, achievement, and cosmic consciousness. In such a condition ofalertness, the human knows and lives the absence of borders between the externalpowers of the universe and the internal powers of the psyche. He/she understandsthere is only one sentience common to both the Self (Atman) and the Source ofAll Things (Brahman). As Huston Smith puts it, “Consciousness proper—pureconsciousness, consciousness with no images imposed upon it—is the commonproperty of us all.”1 [Notes.xhtml#rch9en1]The jinn, being part of the Creation, partake in this general sentience inherentin all beings. The jinn are also subtle and elusive spirits. They are psychicpowers that could appear as if they were real. They eternally travel between theseen and the unseen realms, between inside out/outside in, like waves thatadvance into the ocean of existence, then recede into the ghayb, the invisible.In a blink of the eye, they retreat into our collective darkness, to emergeagain out there when we least expect them. They enlighten us that physicalreality is not the only reality.It is impossible to locate them on our physical map. We have to seek them out onthe atlas of the imaginal where they invent their transformations beforeemerging into our material plane, dressed in their impermanent bodies to ensnareus. Each time they reveal to us they are “differently” real. Their multifariousmanifestations provide evidence not only of the energy of the imaginal, but alsoof the infinite power of the universe to renew itself, or rather to be renewedby the Creator, the Highest Sentience of all."},{"pageContent":"Appendix [Appendix.xhtml]Notes [Notes.xhtml]Glossary of Arabic Words and Names [Glossary.xhtml]References [References.xhtml]Index [Index.xhtml]"},{"pageContent":"AppendixThe Different Classes of the JinnThe Qur’an mentions only three terms related to the species of jinn: the generic“jinn,” marid, and ‘ifrit. However, Arabic and Islamic literature providespreposterous descriptions of many others it claims belong to the jinn’s species.Allegedly, the jinn’s realm is filled with numerous eerie and alarming beings.THE GHOULIts remarkable shape shifting characterizes this second category of jinn. Infact, the Arabic word ghoul is defined as “every supernatural creature that iscapable of taking on infinite forms.”1 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en1] It is used inpoetic language as “a general synonym for anything perpetually changing.”2[Notes.xhtml#rch10en2]The pagan Arabs of pre-Islamic period thought the act of shape shifting is anindication that ghouls want to kill. It is mostly in the darkness of the nightand in the desert, far from civilization, in the bottomless human fear, thatghouls manifest themselves, luring and seducing their victims by constantmetamorphosis until they bring madness or death upon them. This has given riseto the idea of the ghoul being associated with inevitable destruction.3[Notes.xhtml#rch10en3] The term ghoul comes in fact from an Arabic root (gh-w-l)that means “to annihilate” or “to assault.” The phrase, “A ghoul carried himoff” is sometimes used in Arabic metaphorically to refer to death.Arab poets before Islam gave free reign to their imaginations in theirdescriptions of ghouls. The pre-Islamic poet of the sixth century ‘Ubayd ibnAyyub, for example, wrote of his various encounters with ghouls.4[Notes.xhtml#rch10en4] He narrated a story about a ghoulah (a female ghoul) whowas drawn to the fire he had kindled, and assaulted him one night in the desert.He managed, however, to behead her. Similar stories can be found in odes ofpre-Islamic poets such as Ka‘b ibn Zuhayr and Imru’ al-Qays (d. 540), who pennedimages such as “arrows sharp as the canine teeth of a ghoul.” The poet ‘Antarahibn Shaddad al-‘Absi (d. 615), portrayed the suddenly appearing and disappearingnature of the ghoul in the following verse: “Like the flickering flame of atorch, the ghoul / sometimes appears and sometimes disappears in my hands.”5[Notes.xhtml#rch10en5]The best known poems about ghouls, however, are undoubtedly those of Thabit ibn‘Amir al-Fahmi, known as Ta’abbata Sharran (d. 540), which literally means “hecarried evil under his arm.” This refers to a ghoulah he contended to haveencountered in the night and killed, carrying her body with him under his arm toshow his people the following morning.6 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en6] Ta’abbata Sharranwrote that he met the ghoulah one night while he was traveling in the desert,hunted her down, and finally killed her without even getting a good look at her.Then he recited the following lines: I spent the night bearing down on top of her, Waiting for morning to see what I had caught. Then I found two eyes in an ugly head, Similar to the head of a cat, but with a forked tongue.7[Notes.xhtml#rch10en7]Poets were not the only ones who would seem to have encountered ghouls.Well-known pre-Islamic figures also appear to have found themselves face to facewith ghouls. Some of the companions of the Prophet maintain ‘Umar [the secondcaliph of Islam] encountered before Islam a ghoul one day on his way toDamascus, and killed it with his sword.8 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en8]Many extravagant legends circulated in Medieval Islam about this kind of jinn,especially regarding its long life span and its supernatural resistance todeath. It was believed the ghoul dies with one blow, but can come back to lifeif it is struck a second time. After that it remains alive forever, even if itis wielded a deathblow a thousand times over.9 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en9]The most intriguing stories are those that speak of ghouls’ conversion to Islam.As with other classes of jinn, ghouls were invited to convert to Islam, seem tohave obeyed the call, and joined the new religion. The story of “The King’s Sonand the Ogress” from The Nights tells about a young prince who encountered aghoulah in the forest, and how she attempted to seduce him. The young princeprayed to God for help. At first, the ghoulah mocked him for worshiping God andsarcastically asked him: “Aid thyself against him with thy father’s monies andtreasures. He whom I fear will not be satisfied with wealth. Ye hold that yehave in Heaven a God who seeth and is not seen, and is Omnipotent andOmniscient.” “Yes, we have none but Him.” “Then pray thou to Him; happily Hewill deliver thee from me, thine enemy!” So the king’s son raised his eyes toheaven and began to pray with his whole heart, saying, “O my God, I implore Thysuccour against that which troubleth me.” Then he pointed to her with his hand,and she fell to the ground, burnt black as charcoal.10 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en10]A popular belief states ghouls can become good if they hear someone reciting theThrone Verse of the Qur’an (Qur’an 2:255), known for its effectiveness indispelling the power of evil, and convincing ghouls to follow the straight pathof Islam.11 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en11] Islamic medieval literature speaks ofcooperation between human Muslims and jinn Muslims after the latter’sconversion. All of a sudden, these eerie creatures become close to humans,forsake their wilderness, and even join human Muslims in the effort of spreadingthe Word of God. The story of “‘Ajib and Gharib” from The Nights illustrates theconsequences of this conversion’s act. A ghoul named Sa‘dan and his childrenconvert after a long discussion with the human hero, Gharib: “[Said] Gharib, ‘Itis my will that you enter my faith, the faith al-Islam, and acknowledge theUnity of the All-knowing King whose All-might created Light and Night and everything—there is no God but He, the Requiting King!—And confess the mission andprophethood of Abraham the friend [of God] (on whom be peace!).’ So the Ghouland his sons made the required profession after the goodliest fashion, andGharib bade loose their bonds.”12 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en12]The ghoul Sa‘dan and his children, afterward, aided Muslims in their ambitiousobjectives.13 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en13] An interesting point must be made here: Itis usually human Muslims who cross the borders separating them from ghouls. Itis the hero, Gharib, who, empowered by his religion, enters the land of theghoul to convince him to join Islam. It is as if submission to God breaks allbarriers, reuniting species, and healing old antinomies. One could also read itas a reciprocal awareness. Through submission to God, the human Muslim tames theghoul’s monstrosity on one hand, but also becomes sensitive to the existence ofdomesticated wilderness.Similar stories of conversion can be found in Hinduism and Buddhism as well. InHinduism, the Hindu sages tried to convert the Rakshasas, the evil spirits offorests to Hinduism. It is told in The Ramayana, the old Indian epic, that theprince Rama waged a ferocious battle against them, chased them in the deep oftheir dominion, and defeated them, thus establishing peace and order to thewoods. As in the case of Sa‘dan above, it is again the human who crosses theboundaries that separate the two species and comes to tame these spiritualentities hidden in the heart of the wilderness.It is rather difficult to find Western folktale stories of conversion toChristianity similar to the ones mentioned in The Nights and in the texts ofHinduism and Buddhism. One story comes to mind; “Le Petit Poucet” in the Frenchfairy tales collected by Charles Perrault (d. 1703). In this story, the ghoulintends to eat the seven boys, but the youngest of them tricks him and stealshis boots and all his wealth. At no moment of the story is there mention of thepossible redemption of the ghoul by his conversion to Christianity, and hence,of his eventual metamorphosis into a pacifist being.THE HINNThe hinn are an offspring of a tribe of weak jinn and seem to be close toanimals. In this context, they often appear in the shape of dogs, as mentionedin the prophetic tradition: “Dogs belong to the category of hinn, and hinn areweak jinn. If they approach you, throw some food at them and chase them away,for they have evil souls.”14 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en14]Some pre-Islamic poets immortalized the hinn in their verses. They chanted theirplayful evil as follows: “Jinn and hinn frolic around me!”15[Notes.xhtml#rch10en15] Another poet describes his predicament among them: “Icontinued falling among ringing devils, jinn and hinn, with wildly differentfaces.”16 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en16]THE ‘IFRITThe term ‘ifrit is mentioned only once in the Qur’an, when the prophet kingSolomon asked for the throne of the Queen of Sheba to be brought to him. One‘ifrit from among the jinn consented to fulfill his request: “An ‘ifrit of thejinn said, ‘I will bring it to thee, before thou risest from thy place; I havestrength for it and I am trusty” (Qur’an 27:39).The term ‘ifrit often presents a problem for the scholars trying to classify thejinn. Many commentators on the verse cited above maintain the word ‘ifrit is anadjective referring to a specific powerful jinni rather than a separate anddistinct type among the jinn. Later the word came to describe any powerful andcunning man; in which case, it could refer to dark powers within the humanpsyche.17 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en17]THE MARIDIn the Qur’an, the marid is an unruly force always striving to predict thefuture by means of astrological hearsay. The term marid is mentioned only oncein the Qur’an in the following verse “We have adorned the lower heaven with theadornment of the stars and to preserve against every [rebel satan (shaytanmarid)]; they listen not to the High Council, for they are pelted from everyside” (Qur’an 37:7–8). This kind of jinn is mostly found in popular medievalliterature, in particular in the stories of The Nights dealing with Solomon.Finally, as with the term ‘ifrit, the term marid could also be applied tohumans. Used as an adjective, it denotes a rebellious man.18[Notes.xhtml#rch10en18]THE NASNASLike the shiqq and the ghoul, the nasnas moves in locales far away from urbancenters. Some maintained he is “in China and other distant kingdoms.”19[Notes.xhtml#rch10en19] Others asserted he lives beyond the dam of Ma’rib (inYemen), beyond what the eye can see, in the realm of the unknown and theunpredictable.20 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en20] In all cases, he seems to dwell furtheraway from the Arab/Muslim center, in other people’s habitats, which makes himless of a threat, and less subject to be tamed and incorporated into the systemof beliefs.These uncanny beings appear to have, like humans, a physical environment, on andthrough which they act. The supernatural places carry a special power andenergy. The Arabs approached them with awe and even paid reverence to thesupernatural beings dwelling in them. It is there, across sand storms, mirages,and solitude, supernatural beings manifest themselves.The nasnas seems a sad copy of the shiqq, a lower form of jinn, a hybrid betweenanimal and man, a kind of weak, archaic, and abnormal creature. Muslimhistorians and geographers describe men hunting him rather than the reverse.Humans seem to terrify him; when he sees them, he tries to escape by leaping asswiftly as a mare.21 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en21]The etymology of nasnas means “twice people,” since nas in Arabic means“people.” This designation, instead of making him closer to humans, transformedhim, on the contrary, into an enigmatic entity, an oddity.22[Notes.xhtml#rch10en22]Some sources add “nasnases belong to the very ancient Arab tribe of ‘Ad, thatrebelled against their prophet, so God transformed them into nasnases. They hoplike birds and graze like beasts.”23 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en23]One description of this lower form of jinn seems, however, to offer a moreempowering image of the nasnas and at the same time a more fictitious one. Heappears a kind of alien capable of frightening humans and carrying them off.Najm al-din al-Razi (d. 1256) writes “nasnas: a mythical being combining bothhuman and demonic features. It is an animal found in the deserts of Turkestan.It is tall, with an upright stature and broad fingernails. It is extremely fondof humans, and whenever it sees a human, it throws sand in his path andenthralls him with its gaze. If it meets a solitary traveler, it is said it willcarry him off and take seed from him.”24 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en24]In Najm al-din al-Razi’s description, the nasnas seems the opposite of whatother sources described him. Instead of being frightened of humans, he appearshere as fond of them. This inconsistency in the Muslim sources makes this kindof jinn even more mysterious and might illustrate at the same time that it is aproduct of people’s fantasy.25 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en25]THE SHIQQThe term shiqq means in Arabic “half of.” The uncanny being called shiqqmanifests itself in the shape of half a man with one foot, one eye, one hand,etc. In a way, it could be surnamed “the incomplete being,” because only half ofit is created, and thus lacks the usual symmetry that exists in all beings. Likeother eerie beings, it appears to humans far from the traffic of civilization,in the wilderness where there is no other witness to its oddity, and whereimagination can wander. It traps the traveler alone, when in a journey, andinvites him to a fight.26 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en26]The belligerent relationship between humans and shiqq is prominent in the manynarratives depicting their encounters. Al-Jahiz (d. 868) recounts a story inwhich a certain Arab by the name of ‘Alqamah ibn Safwan met with a shiqq at aplace called Hazman’s grove. They fought, and then they recited poetry to eachother before they fell to beating one another to death.27[Notes.xhtml#rch10en27] This act of reciting poetry to a foe or someone from adifferent species comes up often in the narratives of medieval Islam, remindingus that poetry played the vital role of catalyst in the lives of people duringthat time.Shiqq is also the proper name of a historical figure, a soothsayer in pre-Islamwho was transformed into a supernatural being with the advent of the newreligion.28 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en28] Because this change took place in Islam, itis possible to argue it was part of a waged war against seers, diviners, andsoothsayers. The figure of the shiqq was then demonized, or at least disfigured,to incite Muslims to reject the diviners of the past, and seek help from theQur’an alone.The figure of this intriguing being seems to be found across cultures as well,illustrating the constant migration of stories from one culture to another, andepitomizing at the same time the archetypes that inhabit each of us. The halfman could indeed refer to the split self. If the fight is positive and thevictim alive, the two parts of the self will be reconciled and integration willoccur. However, if the victim dies in the narrative, then there is a suggestionthe crack between the two parts will remain opened. Joseph Campbell relates thefollowing: “A dangerous one-legged, one-armed, one sided figure, the half-maninvisible if viewed from the off-side, is encountered in many parts of theearth. In Central Africa, it is declared such a half-man says to the person whohas encountered him: ‘Since you have met with me, let us fight together.’ Ifthrown, he will plead: ‘Do not kill me. I will show you lots of medicines;’ andthen the lucky person becomes a proficient doctor. But if the half-man (calledChiruwi, ‘a mysterious thing’) wins, his victim dies.”29 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en29]Needless to say, this fantastic Central African being is similar to the Arabshiqq. Strangely enough, it behaves in the same manner and utters the samewords.THE SI‘LATThe si‘lat resembles the ghoul in many aspects. She, too, is a temptress, afirst-class trickster. She likes dancing relentlessly with men and playing withthem as a cat plays with a mouse.30 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en30] People in medievalIslam told stories the si‘lat would attract a man to her by imitating a woman’svoice and screaming a wolf is eating her!31 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en31]The pre-Islamic Arabs maintained one of their forefathers, ‘Amr ibn Yarbu‘, fellin love with a si‘lat. He married her, and she gave birth to human children.There was even a belief an entire Arabian tribe sprang from this marriage.Whether this fictional ancestry was originally regarded as an honor or adishonor, however, is not recorded. The tribe was called Banu Si‘lat (childrenof si‘lat). It is alleged this eerie si‘lat “one day saw lightning in the skyand interpreted it as a sign that her clan was calling her back. So she leftchildren and husband, and returned to her clan.”32 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en32]The difference between a si‘lat and a ghoul remains indistinct. Some textsmention that si‘lat acts in the broad daylight, while the ghoul manifests itselfonly in the night.33 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en33] Others relate “the fire that aghoul kindles in the night is different from a fire kindled by a si‘lat.”34[Notes.xhtml#rch10en34] But we don’t know how. As for the relationships betweena si‘lat and a ghoul, some sources further refine the differences between theseclasses of jinn by claiming the ghoul’s wife is a si‘lat!35[Notes.xhtml#rch10en35]CONCLUSIONIslamic theology has tried to establish a hierarchical ranking for the classesof jinn mentioned above based on their abilities to perform marvels, theirdifferent spiritual powers, their specific interaction with humans, theircloseness or distance from angels and animals, the extent to which they canshape-shift themselves, and the time and place they choose to manifestthemselves.36 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en36]Some medievalist Muslim scholars gave full reign to their imagination, likeal-Mas‘udi (d. 956) for example, who found the classes of jinn mentioned abovecould not exhaust the list of these spiritual entities. He claimed there arethirty-one types of jinn. They are all children of al-jann, the father of alljinn, and his unnamed wife.37 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en37]Even with the best efforts of Muslim lexicographers, geographers, andhistorians, the distinctions between the diverse classes of jinn remain unclear.For example, some Muslim medieval sources maintain that the ghoul is exclusivelyfemale, while others claim it is exclusively male. The popular belief during thepre-Islamic period was that there existed a masculine ghoul along with itsfemale counterpart or mate, a ghoulah.38 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en38]Androgyny and WomanhoodThis indecision with regard to the gender of both si‘lat and ghoul might suggestthe possibility of androgyny. Some supernatural beings, such as the phoenix andthe dragon, are considered androgynous across cultures. It is thischaracteristic that partly gave them mythical attributes. Indeed, androgynousbeings are looked at as perfect beings that existed before time, before thepartition of life into masculine and feminine.One could also find that sometimes si‘lat and ghoul are associated withwomanhood rather than androgyny. Alone in the desert, a si‘lat keeps changingshape until she manages to draw a man to her. Iraqi historian Mahmud Shukrial-Alusi (d. 1924) recounts the Arabs call any attractive, witty, slim, andpowerful woman a si‘lat.39 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en39] These kinds of associationsindicate a negative approach to women perceived as inconstant, unfaithful, andbringers of death. It is possible to compare it to the Hindu Maya as thedestructive and seductive powers of the senses and the realm of illusion.The Blurring of SpeciesAlthough some of these diverse classes of jinn could be androgynous, others aredepicted as hybrid. For example, si‘lat and ghouls are fashioned out of two oreven more species. Thus, a ghoul is sometime depicted as half man and halfdonkey, or has the features of one animal that can be mixed with the features ofanother.40 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en40] It is recounted a ghoul has the head of a catand the tongue of a dog, and it could change everything in its appearance exceptits feet, which remain donkey’s hooves, no matter what shape it takes.41[Notes.xhtml#rch10en41] One wonders if this peculiarity is not meant torecognize the ghoul despite all the luring and disguise it recourses to. It isworthy of note this oddity is in the lower part of the body as if to encapsulatethe bestiality of this being.In general, all kinds of jinn have a body peculiarity that distinguishes themfrom each other. Thus, a shiqq has only half a body, a shaytan has one eye, anasnas is half demonic half human and hops like a bird, a ghoul has a donkey’shooves, etc.The Arab/Muslim lore is not alone in picturing ghouls as having a foot oddity.Such beings seem to have existed since early times, as R. Campbell Thompson (d.1941), specialist in ancient Near-Eastern incantations and author of many workson the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Hittite literatures seems to allude: “Herodotusdescribes some people who were supposed to live beyond the region inhabited bythe Scythians as having goats’ feet.”42 [Notes.xhtml#rch10en42]A Fleeting ConceptWhen dealing with the various classes of the jinn, it seems impossible tocatalogue them the way a modern zoologist would do with his thousands of real,measurable, and identifiable animals. All of them show a remarkable resistanceto systemization. In the domain of the jinn, forms shift ceaselessly becausejinn are essentially tricksters. Even their habitat is constantly beingdisplaced, and apparently wanders around just as they do. The following sayingof the Prophet Muhammad is often quoted to epitomize the transitory and elusivenature of these spiritual entities, “The jinn are of three kinds: one has wingsand flies, serpents and dogs are another, and the third keeps roaming.”43[Notes.xhtml#rch10en43]As we have seen, the Qur’an mentions jinn only, and refers to ‘ifrit and maridin rare instances. The Qur’an addresses its message to humans and jinn, bothconsidered intelligent and responsible. How then one should understand theinclusion of all these supernatural beings in the inventory of jinn? It isobvious Muslim geographers, historians, and lexicographers were under the swayof a widely spread popular and oral literature that dealt with the most unheardof among creatures.In fact, there are two ways of reading this list of the jinn’s classes. Thefirst reading would suppose the inclusion of these supernatural beings degradedthe “pure” and intelligent concept of jinn as unfolded in the Qur’an intosupernatural and uncanny beings. It assumes there was a constant conflictbetween an orthodox Islam and a popular Islam. The second reading, however,stresses there is no conflict, and claims jinn are essentially shape shifterswho could appear in animal shapes. Within this second reading, one is remindedthat throughout human history, spirits, gods, and animals have often livedtogether and often completed each other. It even happened that one of them tookon the appearance and the life force of the other."},{"pageContent":"NotesINTRODUCTION1 [Introduction.xhtml#ch01en1].

You shall not passthrough except with an authority.” Thus, humans and jinn could explore allthings in the heavens and on Earth with an authority from God.7 [Chapter01.xhtml#ch1en7]. J. C.

See Yves Marquet, La philosophie desalchimistes et l’alchimie des philosophes: Jabir ibn Hayyan et les frères de laPureté (Paris: Editions Maisonneuve et Larose, 1988), 73. Marquet maintains“Jabir ibn Hayyan, as well as Ikhwan al-Safa’ proclaim that the angels areendowed with reason, but not the jinn.” Some folkloric texts depict the jinn asbeing stupid. See especially Husain Haddawy, trans. The Arabian Nights (NewYork: W. W. Norton, 1990), 30. In the story of “The Fisherman and the Jinni,” acunning fisherman manipulates a jinni and compels him to return to the jar. Thestory underscores the human intelligence and the jinn’s dumbness. See alsoSou‘ad al-Hakim, “Knowledge of God in ibn Arabi,” in Ibn Arabi: A CommemorativeVolume, ed. Stephen Hirtenstein and Michael Tiernan (Rockport, MA: Element,1993), 264–90. Al-Hakim mentions “for ibn ‘Arabi, only jinn and humans areendowed with mental faculties, which allows them to acquire knowledge.” Jinn andhumans are referred to in the Qur’an and in the Hadith as al-thaqalan, whichcould be translated as “the two weighty communities.” Islamic scholars gave manyinterpretations of this term. Ibn Manzur, 1:88, states: “God Almighty calledjinn and humans thaqalan in order to prefer them to all other beings on earth.”See also geographer Kamal al-din al-Damiri, Hayat al-hayawan al-kubra (Beirut:al-Maktabah al-islamiyyah, n.d.), 1:180. He gives the additional meaning of“honor” to the term: “They have been called thaqalan because they carry weighton earth, and because they are extremely honorable. Every honorable person issaid to be ‘weighty.’ They are also called thaqalan because they are sin-ladenbeings.” Another term applied to both humans and jinn is the term nas, whichliterally means “people.” See Qur’anic commentator, ‘Abdul Karim al-Qushayri,Lata’if al-’isharat: Tafsir sufi kamil li al-qur’an al-karim (Cairo: al-Hay’ahal-misriyyah al-‘ammah li al-kitab, 1981), 3:356. Al-Qushayri states “nas is aword which refers to both jinn and humans.”2 [Chapter02.xhtml#ch2en2]. The shahadah, is the Muslim declaration of belief inthe oneness of God and in Muhammad as his messenger. Recitation of the shahadahis one of the Five Pillars of Islam.3 [Chapter02.xhtml#ch2en3].

Moreover, the jinnseem to like intellectual discussions, as illustrated by the jurisprudental-imam al-Bayhaqi (d. 1100), whose work imagines a debate between a group ofscholars from the jinn and a group of human scholars on issues involving freedomof choice and submission to one’s fate.62 [Chapter02.xhtml#ch2en62]. Ibn ‘Arabi, al-Futuhat al-makkiyyah, 3:3. This isnot a clear indication, contrary to what some theologians have written, that theProphet Muhammad personally entered into discussions with the jinn, and wasaware of their presence other than in the revelation of the Qur’an, as we shallsee further in the fourth chapter of this book.63 [Chapter02.xhtml#ch2en63]. The jinni who transports Badr al-din Hasan tellshim, for example, “know that I have brought thee hither, meaning to do thee agood turn for the love of Allah.” Burton, 1:214.64 [Chapter02.xhtml#ch2en64].

This help from spiritual entitiessuch as the jinn is not restricted to Islam, but rather is present in mostfolkloric traditions across the world. However, although Muslim jinn in TheNights always acknowledge they are mere performers of Divine orders, spiritualbeings in other folkloric traditions are not necessarily centered on religion,and they do not see themselves as instruments in the hands of God. In some worldfolklore stories, one finds a pattern of reward and punishment created by thespiritual beings. The latter would punish the humans who don’t respond to theircalls and would reward those who run to their rescue. See Idries Shah, WorldTales: The Extraordinary Coincidence of Stories Told in all Times, in all Places(New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1979), 164. In the story of “The Water ofLife,” for example, a dwarf rewards a young prince who has helped him. Theprince’s two elder brothers humiliate him, heaping contempt upon him, and refuseto assist him. So the dwarf punishes them by transforming them into statues. Inthis context, see also Charles Perrault, Contes (Paris: Collection del’imprimerie nationale, 1987), 225–29. Perrault (d. 1703), a famous Frenchfabulist, tells the stories of two sisters, one ugly and the other beautiful.Their mother used to prefer the ugly one because she resembled her, and hate thebeautiful one simply because she was beautiful. One day, the mother sent thebeautiful one to the forest with the intention of getting rid of her. Once inthe forest, however, the girl saw a fairy who asked her to bring her some water.The girl gave her the water as she requested. To reward her, the fairy told her“each time you speak, jewels will fall from your mouth.” She returned home toher mother, and when she started to speak, jewels fell from her mouth as thefairy had promised. The greedy mother, to increase her fortune even more, nowsent the ugly daughter into the forest. However, when the ugly daughter met thefairy, she refused to obey her request. So, to punish her, the fairy made a wishthat each time she spoke, frogs would come out of her mouth. When she returnedto her mother, she started speaking and frogs spewed out, so her mother chasedher away from the house and kept the beautiful daughter instead. See also W. B.Yeats.

In astory entitled “Master and Man,” Yeats tells how a dwarfish spirit punished ahuman and made him his slave because the spirit helped him, but the human didnot acknowledge it, and even refused to help him in return. The dwarf forces thehuman to work for him: “’Billy Mac Daniel,’ said the little man, getting veryangry, ‘you shall be my servant for seven years and a day, and that is the way Iwill be paid; so make ready to follow me.’ When Bill heard this, he began to bevery sorry for having used such bold words toward the little man; and he felthimself, yet could not tell how, obliged to follow the little man the live-longnight about the country, up and down, and over hedge and ditch, and through bogand brake, without any rest.” See finally W. Y. Evans Wentz, The Fairy-Faith inCeltic Countries (New Jersey: New Page Books, 2004), 116, where a woman refusesthe hospitality of a fairy who offers her food. Consequently, the fairyimprisoned her and made her work for her in the hillock.3. BEINGS OF LIGHT AND OF FIRE1 [Chapter03.xhtml#ch3en1]. Ibn Manzur, 13:92 and 2:366.2 [Chapter03.xhtml#ch3en2].

Fahd attempted to find a solid definition for the term kahin, seer, andwrote: “To begin with, the etymological origin of the term kahin itself isobscure; possible roots are the Semitic root k.w.n ‘to be,’ ‘to stand up,’ andthe Akkadian root k’n, which implies the idea of prostration.”3 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en3]. Seers across traditions have been known to be poets,storytellers, and preservers of oral culture. On this issue, see particularlyMircea Eliade, Myths, Dreams and Mysteries (London: Harvill Press, 1960), 78.Eliade maintains “they [the soothsayers] are the principal custodians of therich oral literature. The poetic vocabulary of a Yaqyt shaman comprises some12,000 words, whilst his ordinary speech—all that is known to the rest of thecommunity—consists of only 4,000. Among the Kasakh-Kirghizes the baqça, singer,poet, musician, seer, priest, and doctor, seems to be the guardian of thepopular religious traditions, the custodians of legends several centuries old.”4 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en4].

In theSufi perspective of revelation and prophethood, see Chittick, The Sufi Path ofLove, 120.31 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en31]. See Chittick, The Self-Disclosure of God, 154. Didthe Prophet receive revelation as a young child? Regarding Qur’an 94:1: “Have wenot expanded your chest?” it is sometimes considered as an indication that thechild Muhammad was thrown to the ground by two individuals, who split him openand then washed his heart. See Muhammad Husayn Haykal, The Life of Muhammad,trans. Isma‘il Raji al-Faruqi (Indianapolis, IN: American Trust Publications,1976), 50. Haykal mentions the story of the opening of the chest, but seems notto give it any credit: “Orientalists and many Muslim scholars do not trust thestory, and find the evidence therefore spurious. The biographers agree that thetwo men dressed in white were seen by children hardly beyond their second yearof age—which constitutes no witness at all, and that Muhammad lived with thetribe of Banu Sa‘d in the desert until he was five.” It is worth mentioning,though, that both ibn Ishaq and ibn Hisham, the two most trusted biographers ofthe Prophet, did not deny this incident.32 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en32]. On the issue of how early Muslims conceivedrevelation as a continuation to divination, see also Toufic Fahd, La divinationarabe, 68. Fahd asserts “certaines idées et certaines procédés divinatoires ontconservé une partie de leur prestige dans la jeune communauté islamique.”33 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en33]. Many other verses in the Qur’an deal with thisview of the Meccans, that the Qur’an is but poetry invented by the Prophet, suchas Qur’an 37:36, Qur’an 3:30, Qur’an 69:41, and Qur’an 26:22.34 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en34].

Ye men of Quraysh, look to your affairs, for by God, a serious thinghas befallen you” (Haykal, 136).37 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en37].

On the subordination of the human receptacle tothe power of revelation, see Frithjof Schuon, The Transcendental Unity ofReligions (New York: Harper and Row, 1975), 21. Schuon wrote the following onthis issue: “What man stands in absolute need of is not such and such aRevealer, but rather revelation itself, in terms that is, of its essential andunalterable content.” Further, he adds: “This is to fail to realize that the egowhich, in the revelations, speaks and gives law, can only be a manifestation ofthe divine subject and not this subject itself; one must distinguish inGod—always from the point of view of revelation—firstly the one and essentialWord, and then the manifestations of this Word in view of particularreceptacles” (59).39 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en39]. Haykal, 75.40 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en40]. See Toufic Fahd, “Anges, génies et démons enIslam,” 157.41 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en41]. The idea of converting both humans and spiritualentities to one’s religion is not confined to Islam. We also encounter it inBuddhism, where we find the Buddha preaching his message to humans as well as tothe Nagas and the Yaqsas. In Buddhist texts that narrate the spread of Buddhisminto new territories, the conversion of spirits is a common element. Seeespecially Sutherland, The Disguises of the Demon, 41. The author describes howthe Buddha preached Buddhism to the spiritual entities called Nagas: “In theMahavamsa and the Dipavamsa, the Buddha descends among Nagas spirits toestablish the Buddhist belief: Hovering there in mid-air above the battlefield,the Master, who drives away [spiritual] darkness, called forth dread darknessover the Nagas. Then comforting those who were distressed by terror, he onceagain spread light abroad. When they saw the Blessed One, they joyfully didreverence to the Master’s feet. Then preached the Vanquisher to them thedoctrine that begets concord, and both [Naga] gladly gave up the throne to theSage. When the Master, having alighted on the Earth, had taken his place on aseat there, and had been refreshed with celestial food and drink by theNaga-kings, he, the Lord, established in the three refuges and in the moralprecepts eighty kotis of snake spirits, dwellers in the ocean and on themainland.”42 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en42]. Al-Shibli, 53.43 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en43]. Al-Kashani, 5:17.44 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en44]. See Mahmud Shukri al-Alusi, 13:188. Al-Alusiconfirms the fact the Prophet had two significant encounters with the jinn. Hecites several authorities on this issue, such as al-Tabarani, and says that someIslamic authors think that the jinn came to speak to the Prophet six times afterthat.45 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en45]. Muhammad Husein al-Tabatiba’i, al-Makhluqatal-khafiyyah fi al-qur’an (Beirut: Dar safwan, 1995), 39–40.46 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en46]. Al-Shibli, 64.47 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en47]. Cooper, 7648 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en48]. It is reported, for example, someone came toMuhammad and asked him, “O Prophet of God, I heard people quarreling and Ididn’t understand their language.” He replied, “Muslim jinn and heretic jinnbrought a quarrel of theirs to me. They asked me to decide between dwellings forthem. So I put the heretic jinn in the lowlands and the Muslim jinn in thevillages between the mountains and the sea.” Al-Damiri, 1:205. From thisaccount, it is obvious popular literature highlighted the dualism between badjinn and good jinn and added an appealing fantasy not present in the Qur’an. Itemphasized acceptance of the Muslim good jinn and rejection of the heretic ones,those who refused to join the new religion. One could also find traces of thiskind of popular literature in some of the prophetic tradition itself where weare told that an ‘ifrit, a kind of rebellious jinn, attempted to divert theProphet from his prayer. God having given the Prophet power over him, he tiedhim to a pillar of the mosque, to show him to his Companions. Then he releasedhim, remembering the prayer of Solomon: “Lord forgive me, and grant me a kingdomwhich will not be proper to any after me” (Qur’an 38:35).

Al-Isbahani even attempts topinpoint the name of the first jinni who called the prayer the night the jinncame to listen to the Prophet. He says “‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud [one of theProphet’s companions] said his name was Samrah.”54 [Chapter04.xhtml#ch4en54]. This opinion is expressed by al-Damiri, 1:204.

He also enteredinto a pact with the jinn, asking them to participate in his spitting during theoperation, intending to make the spell forceful. This (human) figure and theevil names have a harmful spirit. It issues from the sorcerer with his breathand attaches to the spittle he spits out. It produces (more) evil spirits.

In contrast to this Islamic perspective, seeMircea Eliade, The Sacred and the Profane, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York:Harcourt Brace, 1959), 20. Eliade maintains “the former is the world (moreprecisely, our world), the cosmos; every thing outside it is no longer a cosmosbut a sort of ‘other world,’ a foreign, chaotic space, peopled by ghosts,demons, ‘foreigners.’ It is not difficult to see why the religious moment (i.e.,the manifestation of the sacred) implies the cosmogonic moment.”46 [Chapter06.xhtml#ch6en46]. Ikhwan, 1978.47 [Chapter06.xhtml#ch6en47]. Al-Damiri, 1:285. See also al-Qazwini, 170, whomaintains “human beings are a kind of animals, the jinn are animals of fire,transparent, and capable of taking different forms.” In this same context, seealso Annemarie Schimmel, Islam and the Wonders of Creation: The Animal Kingdom(London: al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation, 2003). Schimmel highlights thecentrality of animals in Islamic literature. Equally seminal from the Islamicperspective is the fact all these forms of life, al-hayawan, are aware of theDivine and worship him, each in its own manner. It is in this context that ibn‘Arabi maintained there are some saints among these species, and he wishes oneday to become as pious as they are, for their worship of God is exemplary.

This podaloddity is shared by many demons and spirits across traditions like, for example,the fauns, the satyrs, and some kind of Nereids who are pictured as havinggoats’ feet. This characteristic indicates otherness and alerts the human to adeformity that might be dangerous. In any case, it creates distance and fear inthe human, who is intrigued and cautious, even when in love with thesesupernatural beings.5 [Chapter07.xhtml#ch7en5]. Ibn al-Nadim, 367.

See Yeats, Irish Fairy and Folk Tales, 93.Allegedly, the same motif occurs with the fairies. It is believed maidens aretaken into Fairyland unwillingly, on the eve of a human wedding. In the fairystory entitled “Master and Man,” one of the “little people” goes to a placewhere a wedding is being celebrated to attempt an abduction of the bride: “Andto that purpose,” said the little man, “have I come all the way toCarrigogunniel; for in this house, this very night, is young Darby Riley goingto be married to Bridget Rooney; and as she is a tall and comely girl, and hascome of decent people, I think of marrying her myself, and taking her off withme.” In the same work, Yeats mentions “On Midsummer Eve, when the bonfires arelighted on every hill on honor of St. John, the Fairies are at their gayest, andsometimes steal away beautiful mortals to be their brides” (2).27 [Chapter07.xhtml#ch7en27]. See also Ikhwan, 84. One of the sage jinnepitomizes the jinn’s apprehension in these terms: “O company of jinn let us notbecome exposed to them (humans) and ruin our relations with them. Let us notincite their weakling hatred that would ignite that deeply rooted prejudicetoward us which is so entrenched in their human nature.”28 [Chapter07.xhtml#ch7en28].

Press, 1996), 172. Avery similar story to the preceding two narratives exists as well in thispopular Arab saga. The same pattern with similar details is carried out. Sayffinds the jinniyah of his heart in a castle. One look at her and he almost loseshis mind: “Now as King Sayf gazed on her, he was seized with imaginings,becoming ever more possessed, transported from one state to another. As forQueen Munyat an Nufus, she went down into the fountain with the maidens andbegan to disport herself with them, and they with her, all making merrytogether, with none to keep watch over them. They began to embrace as a loverembraces his beloved, their perfumes wafting out from them, so that the gardenwas filled with musk and scent. At that King Sayf sensed fire and flame kindlingin his loins, and was seized with torment; unable to endure, he was ready almostto lose his mind, afflicted by love’s ailment over which no physician haspower.”34 [Chapter07.xhtml#ch7en34].

Burton, 5:346.39 [Chapter07.xhtml#ch7en39]. Ibid., 7:330. A very similar tale to Sayfal-Muluk’s exists in Indian folklore. It is entitled “The Prince and the PaintedFairy.” Like Sayf al-Muluk, the Indian prince Manohara falls instantly in lovewith the painting. Both princes pine and languish after these figures. In thecase of the Indian tale, the fairy in the painting speaks to the prince andentrances him. Then she disappears: “The fairy vanished, and so did Manohara’sreason. Bakula and the other friends were desperate when they saw his condition.But they had heard what the fairy had said, and, when the prince regainedconsciousness, they said: ‘Enough!
