I have remained a non-convert, however, which explains a distant perspective, seeking to chart long-term social and cultural change. Readers caring for the unbridled Sufi perspective are advised to consult Persian sources in the bibliography, or the ever-expanding Western forest of esoterica. Sufis or sympathisers as well as enemies and opponents often conceive of Sufism as a unitary social phenomenon. Thus, the êaf->alsh¿h and SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h-Ne>matoll¿h orders reckon one four-teenth-century founder. But nineteenth-century Sufis caused their di-vision and social autonomy. For this reason, there is no mention in my study of Sufi ›branchesø, but of different Ne>matoll¿h ›ordersø. The present book is a revision of my dissertation, defended at the University of Amsterdam in September 2000. Although my thesis was based on fieldwork in preceding years, I did not update the book to include the latest developments. Its main purpose remains explor-ing long-term social and cultural change, and a study of current Ira-nian Sufism would be better served with a separate publication. Re-vising the thesis has mainly consisted of correcting errors that became evident to me upon rereading the manuscript and that va-rious readers kindly brought to my notice. But it is necessary to state that any shortcomings in this work remain my responsibility alone. I have transcribed Persian seeking to respect both sound and script and largely relied on Mo>nøs Dictionary for pronunciation. The short vowels were rendered as 9aK, 9eK, and 9oK, the long vowels as 9¿K, 9K, and 9 ́K. 9EyK and 9owK have been used for the diphthongs. The consonants have been transliterated as follows: ö-<; Q-¢; U-j; Y-ch; c-ú; g-kh; m-`; s-zh; y-sh; £-§; §-ß; «-Ã; °-ˆ; ́->; ¹-gh; Þ-v. Names of persons, places and concepts that have their own cur-rency in Western literature and that do not distort their object beyond recognition are the major exception. Thus, I refer to 9KhomeyniK instead of 9KhomeynK, 9TehranK instead of 9Tehr¿nK and 9SufiK instead of 9§ ́fK. Publications by Iranians in European languages that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"viii PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS employ alternative transliterations (9ghK is often used for Á) have been rendered in their versions, thus: 9HazeghiK instead of 9î¿`eqK. Three persons have been invaluable to me in course of writing the present book. For many years, my supervisors Bernd Radtke and Peter van der Veer have guided my work - each from a different scientific tradition, Islamic/Sufi Studies and Anthropology - and helped me keep it on the straight path. Yann Richard has done an admiringly profound close reading of my thesis, which has led me to rewrite it in a substantial way. I am indebted to all three of them.

They both claim to represent, exclusively, the Ne>matoll¿h order. The tensions contained within this competi-tion for spiritual authority have been paralleled by challenges to in-ternal cohesion in each order, and augmented by the need to relate to worldly regimes. Worldly regimes have often been hostile and some-times lenient, but in always-different ways. Sufi performance upon these tensions has given shape to the ordersø social development. I will briefly discuss theoretical notions in my exploration of the modern êaf>alsh¿h and SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h Ne>matoll¿h orders, which for reasons explained below I conceptualise as ›mystic regimesø. Until fairly recently, the anthropology of religion was bifurcated into idealistic, culturalist approaches in religious anthropology on the one hand and a materialistic, power-centred political anthropology on the other. Either culture or politics remained residual categories in these studies (cf. BAX, 1987). Many great monographs in the anthro-pology of Islam exemplify the meaning-power bifurcation too. In the study of Sufism, for example, GELLNERøs Saints of the Atlas (1969) did not deal with esoterism, but ›rural Moroccan political structureø (GEERTZ, 1971: 763). His study was fia transposition of Evans-Pritchardøs analysis of the role of the Sanusi brotherhood in Libya‹ (BALDICK, 1989: 156), which dealt with the order fionly in so far as deemed necessary to an understanding of the political devel-opment‹ (EVANS-PRITCHARD, 1949: preface). GEERTZøs Islam Ob-served (1968), in contrast, ignored power and politics and explored the relations between worldview, ethos and religious perspectives (cf. ASAD, 1983: 252). Concerns with meaning in individual fieldwork encounters, largely in isolation from politics, economics or class and fiat the expense of [...] exhaustive recordings of detailed social activ-ity‹ (BEAL, 1995: 289), have also marked several reflexive approaches that developed from Geertzøs symbolical anthropology (that is: RABINOW, 1977, CRAPANZANO, 1980, and DWYER, 1982). Without problematising the power-meaning divide, some studies nevertheless went beyond it in description. GILSENANøs Saint and Sufi"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"2 INTRODUCTION in Modern Egypt (1973) represented fian effort to articulate [...] eco-nomic, political and historical contexts with patterns of religious faith and experience‹ (EICKELMAN, 1984: 5), while the interrelations between class and religious patterns have since remained important in his work (cf. GILSENAN, 1982 (introduction), 1985, 1996). In a study of relations between Sufism and politics in Pakistan, EWING (1983: 253) showed that politicians allied themselves with Sufism not only because Sufi masters were politically and economically power-ful, but also because they provided legitimisation as embodiments of spiritual authority. That is, relations had their rationale in an ›idea-tionalø element intrinsic to Sufism. HAMMOUDI (1997), treating poli-tics and Sufism in similar ways, identified ›the cultural foundations of Moroccan authoritarianismø in the Sufi master-disciple relation-ship - both as a cultural template and as an organisational structure. 1. The concept of ›religious regimeø as conceived and developed by BAX (1987, 1988, 1990) and deployed by, for instance, SPIER (1991) and WOLF (1991) was devised to tackle the power-meaning divide in anthropology theoretically. One of the few theoretical antecedents in the field of religion was provided by Abner Cohen, who fiviewed power and symbolism as distinct variables in dialectical relationship with each other‹ (PARKIN, 1996: xv). BAX, more specifically, held religious phenomena incomprehensible outside human networks of interdependencies (1987: 1), and simultaneously stated that religious processes are relatively autonomous (1987: 2). By implication, reduc-tionist determinisms are ruled out: neither can symbolic structures be conceived of as self-generating entities, nor can they be reduced to ideology in struggles for power and wealth. In the study of Sufism, one of the advantages of studying Sufi cults as [...] viable and genera-tive symbolic and ethical movements is that this enables us to explore the connections between Sufi cosmologies, ethical ideas, bodily ritual practices and organisational forms, which have been lost in earlier his-torical and anthropological studies (WERBNER and BASU, 1998: 4). Religious regimes connote a ficonstellation of dependencies that is characterised by religious imagery and acts‹ (SPIER, 1991: 10; BAX, 1988: 10). The social dynamics of religious regimes are accounted for by relations with worldly (state) regimes, confrontations with other"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"3 INTRODUCTION religious regimes, and by internal tensions (BAX, 1987: 3). The sec-ond conceptual advantage in ›religious regimesø, besides bridging the meaning-power divide, lies in this specification of levels. In his dis-cussions of domination and resistance, SCOTT (1985, 1990) dichoto-mously opposed the dominant and the subordinate (cf. GAL, 1995: 417). However, there are two arguments why a specification of levels is preferable here to a dichotomous model in dealing with domina-tion. Even when confronted with violent state oppression, Sufi orders also engaged in relations to lateral regimes and internal struggles for spiritual authority. That is to say, religious regimes always fihave their own politics‹ (ORTNER, 1995: 177) as well. Moreover, the dyna-mics of ›subordinate politicsø itself affects the nature of domination. Depending on the political context, the Ne>matoll¿h orders have managed to contain domination in different coalitions, with either the state or jurist regimes. Sufi leaders were able to negotiate their orders effectively, moreover, to the extent that they were able to establish internal control. Finally, there has often been deliberate differentia-tion of internal and external realms in Sufi orders. This explains a recurrent ›ambiguity of resistanceø (cf. ORTNER, 1995: 175) in the mystic regimes when faced with domination. While some disciples in the Islamic Republic conceived of their Sufi religiosity as a protest against state Islam, many of their leaders have simultaneously been eager (not to resist but) to accommodate Sufism to the jurist state. That is, the apparent ›resistanceø of a few took place within a larger configuration, which had ›accommodationø as keyword. 2. The concept of religious regimes was legitimately conceived of as a heuristic instrument (SPIER, 1991: 9, cf. BAX, 1987: 2). But its large scope is potentially problematic for ethnography, as the relation of an historical dependency constellation to the human acts that build and keep it in place - to ›actingø - may become obscure. BAX (1990) and SPIER (1991), for instance, conceived of the Ro-man Catholic church (as a whole) as a religious regime. It is not very easy, however, to realise the ›constellation of dependenciesø metaphor in the case of the Church. It includes both such phenomena as Opus Dei - with its own substructure, largely independent from and in competition to the Curia - and liberation theology - autonomously"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"4 INTRODUCTION entering into ecumenical coalitions with Protestants and Jews against establishment/orthodoxy in general. These structures rather leave the Roman Catholic church as a nominal collection of difference; unified mainly by the prevalence of Christian competition. The relations to the Vatican of both Opus Dei and liberation theo-logians are like the external relations of hierarchically situated com-petitor regimes, whose courses only sporadically collide with the spiritual centre. Being significantly self-contained, the contexts for the growth of Opus Dei and liberation theology were exterior to the Vatican, i.e. post-war Spain and Marxist revolutionary ideology in the 1960s in Latin America, respectively. Monsignor Escriv resisted and acted upon leftist secularisation in Spain and Archbishop Ro-mero fought poverty and government violence in El Salvador. As real dependencies do exist within these competitor groups, they are the more legitimate objects for the concept of religious regimes. More important as an argument for studying real dependencies, how-ever, they bring into focus the human acts that build, manipulate, overthrow or keep dependencies in place. WEBER wrote that fithe most irrational form of religious behav-iour, the mystic experience, is in its innermost being not only alien but hostile to all form‹ (1977: 342). Judging and inferring from its outward representations, however, Sufi experience bears the marks of, and leaves its marks on, time. Private and public relations, and liturgical practice in speech and writing, have shaped Sufi experience in particular, historical balances of religious need and constraint (cf. SPIER, 1991: 10-12, 1994: 20). In the Islamic Republic and the Pahlavi period, Sufi experience differed because (different) religious urge was subject to different constraint. State-led modernisation under Reza Shah, for instance, was contemporaneous with Sufi instruction that related spiritual progress to education and national development. Masters, disciples, poets and war volunteers alike equated Sufi ex-perience with mystical martyrdom, while the Islamic Republic ap-pealed to the Islamic, Iranian nation to sacrifice itself. Addressing internal and external audiences, these instances of Sufi speech and writing allow for a conceptualisation as ›performanceø: that which in a particular period gives ›form to experienceø (cf. FA-BIAN, 1990: 13; BARBER, 1992: 284). I find myself in agreement with FABIAN that one ought to abandon the view that sees performance (primarily) as ›enactmentø (of texts), and treat it instead as ›eventø and"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"5 INTRODUCTION ›actionø (pp. 9, 12, 13). However, while FABIAN epistemologically favoured ›creatingø in action (p. 13), this study strongly emphasises performanceøs multiple regime dependencies. In a related sense, PARKIN (1996: xix) saw in cultural performance a fimethodological metaphor for exploring issues of conflict [...] in wider society.‹ A second, more conventional series of connotations surrounding performance, concerns the embodiment of emotion (WERBNER and BASU, 1998: 7-8) and fi›symbolicø or ›aestheticø activities [...] enacted as intentional expressive productions in established [...] genres‹ (SCHIEFFELIN, 1998: 194). Performance touches upon ›agencyø here to the extent that fiagency is not an entity that exists apart from cultural construction‹ (ORTNER, 1995: 186, cf. TORAB, 1996: 237). Emotion is central to the ritual life of Iranian, Shi>ite Sufism, both as a desired religious effect and because of the religious significance of Imamic martyrdom. In conceiving of genres such as Sufi ›instruc-tionø, one has to account not only for a flow of emotion or symbolic information between knowledgeable and ignorant persons, however, but also for the establishment, in performance, of their respective roles as masters and disciples. As performance is about ›embodyingø, ›expressingø, and ›establish-ingø, there may also be fifailures in engaging a group into an ›audi-enceø role‹ (FINNIGAN, 1992: 110, cf. SCHIEFFELIN, 1998: 198), which in the present analysis means that acting could be out of tune with the hierarchical setting. One sheikh whom I met in the process of estab-lishing himself as an independent religious specialist nearly depleted his spiritual authority through insecure generic searching in the face of his flock. Commencing and interrupting meditative sessions on an established religious occasion several times, he did not convincingly establish master-disciple roles. Exceptional narrative skills and com-mand over poetry and the Qur<¿n among SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h leaders, inversely, have been crucial in organisational hierarchy and SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h ›orderø. Internal Sufi order, then, bears a particular relation to the mastersø virtuosity; their mastery of styles, genres and settings in performance. Thirdly, in an overarching sense performance relates to reproduc-tion and survival. Each performance effects cultural reproduction, but as performers, genres, settings and occasions are never similar through time, each reproduction always engenders cultural innova-tion as well (cf. SAHLINS, 1981). Particularly fitransformations in the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"6 INTRODUCTION larger political arena in which the performance takes place result in changes in what that performance means‹ (VAN DER VEER, 1994: 82). It has been during such transformations that Sufi identity was most vulnerable, because it was made liminal. GOFFMAN (1956, 1974) thoroughly analysed the maintenance of the self through performance in his studies of the ›presentation of self in everyday lifeø and, more relevant to Sufism, of ›stigma manage-mentø. One important reason for the ongoing conversation upheld by Sufis towards their opponents, is that fias long as [...] individuals are in communication with each other - as long as they are joined in an encounter - whatever they are doing is not occult, however esoteric and opaque it may appear to be‹ (GOFFMAN, 1963: 178). ›Occultø here carries GOFFMANøs sociological meaning, i.e. a disturbing mental absence from rule-led interactions in which legitimacy lies (cf. 1963: 76), but it also bears a literal relation to Shi>ismøs religious universe: legitimate performance contains accusations of magic and heresy. Not only accusations, reputations or spoiled identities were at stake in the authoritarian political contexts of this study, however. Everyday life Sufi performance had to survive the threat of suppres-sion and violence that came, for instance, with the nationalist regime of Reza Shah and with the Islamic revolution. ›State dramaø is part of Victor Turnerøs dramaturgical performance theory (PALMER and JANKOWIAK, 1996: 237). He stressed performanceøs reproductive functions, in the realm of the state and social reality at large, by treat-ing it as (a four phased) ›social drama with conflict and conflict reso-lutionø (p. 231), thus assigning to it an intrinsic developmental logic. In spite of intrinsic relations between Sufi performance and religious regime dependencies, however, fiperformance may be relative proc-ess rather than absolute unit and may emerge not from some prior plan but also in and through the event itself‹ (FINNIGAN, 1992: 110). These three levels and functions of performance - giving shape to experience; embodying emotion and symbolic or aesthetic action in established genres; and socio-political and cultural reproduction and survival - define the crucial features of acting in religious regimes. 3. Performance upon internal tensions, relations with other regimes and relations with the state account for social dynamics in religious re-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"7 INTRODUCTION gimes. BAX conceived of the relation between religious and state regimes as an essentially ›antagonistic interdependencyø (1987: 3). The pattern surely holds in many cases, but not always. There has been antagonism but no material interdependence, for instance, be-tween Sufism and the state in the Islamic Republic. More interest-ingly, there has in other eras been a pattern of confluence, as much as antagonism, between state and Sufi regimes. In his study of the Egyptian Hamidiya Shadhiliya Sufi orderøs so-cial development GILSENAN (1973) attributed its growth in particular to detailed, internal regulations which gave it the power of modern bureaucratic organisations. DE JONG (1974) contested Gilsenanøs view and claimed that growth had primarily been due to government assis-tance (cf. discussion in BALDICK, 1989: 158). It strikes an outsider to the debate as obvious that both explanations are not only valid but also interconnected, as part of the same historical, socio-cultural and political reality. Insidersø and outsidersø concerns similarly coincided in early twentieth-century Iran, when the Shah requested of the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h masters a rulebook for legitimate behaviour, while they themselves attempted to keep beggars and addicts at a distance. An important reason for counter-examples to the proposed pattern of antagonistic interdependency lies in the nature of the parties and the relations involved. For Shi>ite or Sunni Sufis in the Islamic world, the two major parties to relate to have been religious jurists and rulers. To the extent that rulers and jurists engaged in mutual antagonism, coalitions between rulers and Sufis were facilitated. Either in coalition with or antagonism to rulers, jurists have often constituted competitor regimes for Sufism, where Sufism was seen as an obstacle to spiritual authority monopolisation. Lateral and vertical relations have also left their marks on internal structures in Sufi orders. To the extent that rulers were sympathetic, the orders could safely ignore their laterals, while in a patronage limbo they were pressed to accommodate jurist orthodoxy. The Ne>matoll¿h ordersø internal tensions, then, have often reflected (variable) answers to the question of how to relate to power-holders. Many Sufi affiliates in the Islamic Republic have, for instance, been less than happy with the restraints that their masters imposed for reasons of self-preservation. Performance upon these tensions has, in turn, significantly determined social developments in the Sufi orders. While the êaf>alsh¿h order disintegrated and remained an arena for"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"8 INTRODUCTION competition in the Islamic Republic, centralised control in the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order allowed for prominent jurists to visit their reli-gious sessions. Thus, the three (internal, lateral and vertical) regime dynamics are not isolated, but inextricably interrelated. Furthermore, changing triangular relations between Sufis, jurists and rulers - which in different personnel varieties are perhaps descriptive of all religious regimes - rule out dichotomous generalisations of relations between states, lateral and mystic regimes. I address these changing interrelations diachronically, juxtaposing the Pahlavi era and the Islamic Republic, and favouring performance in the Sufi orders as a vista to account for their social development. There is thus a double comparison - of orders and eras - which makes for the description of four mystic regimes. I refer to my study as an ›explorationø because contemporary Iranian, Shi>ite Sufism is largely an unknown research field. Furthermore, ›explorationø stresses open-ness of the history under consideration. This study considers patterns and constraints - the notion of ›developmentø refers to patterned change in a certain direction (ELIAS, in GOUDSBLOM and MENNELL, 1998: 102) - but it is not claimed that Sufi performance could not potentially have been otherwise, nor that actual performance has been reducible to internal or external constraints. In this limited sense, in the stress on empirical and interpretative openness, my study resembles what MARCUS and CUSHMAN (1982: 25, 45) described as experimental ethnographies, as opposed to ethnographic realism. Fieldwork has given a definite direction to and thus also imposed limitations on the material that this study is constructed from. The most important changes since my initial research design concern its scope. I prepared to study all Shi>ite orders in Iran since 1979, with special reference to the Ne>matoll¿hs. I ended up with two Ne>ma-toll¿h orders and their comparative development over this century. There were practical but also substantial reasons for this. It soon turned out that the idea of studying a range of orders simultaneously was excessively ambitious, because of the time, patience and energy involved in establishing productive relations. Once I became in-volved with the Ne>matoll¿h orders on a regular basis, I soon de-cided to ignore the Kh¿ks¿r, the least accessible, least organised and least visible of the Shi>ite orders (only some references to their ses-sions remain in this study). As concerns the ~ahabya and the ~o<r-Rey¿sateyn-Ne>matoll¿h order, I found the only option for in-depth"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"9 INTRODUCTION relations was trying to become a convert and devoting all of my time to them. An additional reason for ignoring the ~o<r-Rey¿sateyn is the development of their spiritual path in a unique, non-Iranian direction after the Islamic revolution. The narrowing of my research scope had an overall positive effect, however. Studying two orders that trace their descent to a common fourteenth-century founder but derive much of their contemporary identities from nineteenth and twentieth-century conflicts over succession, enabled a unique perspective on the microcosm of mystic regimes that facilitated their comparison. The widening of historical scope occurred during fieldwork, when I realised that the Islamic revolution had only been one of the great caesuras that gave identity to the mystic regimes. An understanding of post-revolution Sufism in Iran cannot do without reckoning the particular identities that Sufi orders assumed in the Pahlavi era. It was mainly in the Pahlavi dynasty that the Iranian nation became an important frame of reference, that one Ne>matoll¿h order integrated deeply into the elite circles of state power and another consolidated its bonds with the clerical elite. The key, synchronical concept that I set out with - survival - gave way to a diachronical search for histori-cal regime relations - cultural performance and social development. My conception of fieldwork aimed at a detailed study of religious practice. As thematic interest shifted towards comparative social development, however, this focus of fieldwork changed as well. The scrutiny of religious practices gave way to ethnographic explorations of interaction at the thresholds of internal and external relations. Apart from personal limitations, it is due in large measure to the authoritarian (political) contexts of twentieth-century Iran, inducing meticulously regulated economies of information in speech and writ-ing in persons as much as in institutions, that much of the material in this study is open to replenishment. I tried to diminish the effects of such economies, however, by comparing both oral and written sources, in addition to personal observations and just ›being thereø. Oral sources have been indispensable for this study, mainly because of the historical memory that Sufis shared with me and that is not duplicated in written sources. Written sources have been particularly useful for detecting public discourse about Sufism, by partisans and enemies of Sufism alike, and for the major historical reconstructions. In most cases, oral information was produced within informal set-tings. This is reflected in my text by their reference as ›conversation.ø"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"10 INTRODUCTION ›Interviewø reflects formal settings (of the semi-structured kind). Generally speaking, conversations were conducted with grass-roots informants, while interviews concerned Sufi masters. Irrespective of the particular source, interviews would often render ideal types, offi-cial views or historical justifications, while conversations would bring up the material that anthropologists are traditionally more inte-rested in: failures, contradictions, covert meanings or allegedly ir-relevant details. These sets of representations are socially interrelated (see chapter 7.3). This fact, in addition to the historical memory they contain, has been an elementary reason for their usage in this study. In addition to Richard GRAMLICHøs three-volume Die schiitischen Derwischorden Persiens (1965, 1976, 1981), on which any research on Iranian, Shi>ite Sufism must of necessity be based (being the best and most detailed account available), and Henry CORBINøs four-volume En Islam iranien (1971/2) (that contains unrivalled analyses of Iranian Shi>ismøs ›spiritual universeø), I have relied heavily upon the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h orderøs corpus of primary and secondary sources. Owing to the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hsø unique interest in historical docu-mentation (partly as a means of proselytising), the corpus provides one with an exceptional opportunity to scratch the surface of gener-ally a-historical Sufi images of the self and to identify cultural, social and political developments. For the Pahlavi period, MAîBçB>AL-SH ̇Høs Khvorshd-e T¿bande (1373/1994-5) has been particularly helpful, especially given the fact that useful sources on Sufism in the Pahlavi era remain rather scarce. PARSH ̇NZ ̇DEøs Gosh¿yesh-e r¿z (1377/1998) and N ̇SER>ALøs Res¿la-ye jav¿bya (1362/1983) are clear and fierce defences of the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order that reflect sev-eral ongoing conflicts as well as its survival in the Islamic Republic. êaf>alsh¿h written sources are more problematic: one finds rele-vant worldly information only in the margins of the masterøs literary heritage (for instance: 1361/1973). Two exceptionally fruitful primary sources consists of his pupil î ̇JJ D ̇D ̇SHøs Majalle-ye okhovvat (1307/1928) - reflecting ideological developments in the Reza Shah era - and a pamphlet written by sheikh TAV ̇NGAR (1345/1966) - re-flecting ideological and organisational strife during the late Pahlavi era. Secondary sources such as ZANGANE-PçR (1343/1964) and BARQ (1352/1973) mainly focus upon the personality of êaf>alsh¿h or, as in AFSH ̇R (1367/1988) and îOSEYN (1377/1988), upon the Society of Brotherhood within the order. The latter category of writings, in ad-"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"11 INTRODUCTION dition to (often repetitive) overview descriptions such as VAîDNIY ̇ (1352/1973) and HOM ̇YçN (1371/1992) - does provide outlines of socio-historical development. However, even these writings would have been insufficient in the absence of oral sources. Lastly, there is an important category of negative secondary sour-ces. N ́reddn Modarres CHAH ̇RDAHøs writings on Sufism (particu-larly his magnum opus, Seyr dar ta§avvof) provides a useful and in-dispensable counterbalance to Sufi hagiography. Chah¿rdah depar-ted from the world of traditional Iranian Sufism, but despite (or per-haps because) of this, has sought consistently to reconstruct historical facts. Outrageously hostile secondary sources from the Islamic Re-public such as ê ̇LEî>ALSH ̇H (1375/1996) are unreliable historical accounts but do explore silence in hagiographies and therefore shed light on the terms of battle between Sufis and their enemies. There is a definite urban bias in this study, to the neglect of rural and/or tribal Sufism. The importance of such distinctions is indicated by the fact that the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order became involved in semi-feudal class conflict in Eastern Iran in the early Pahlavi era, while in Tehran (its second centre), it has rather been networks, crosscutting class divisions, which were important in external relations. Neverthe-less, the numerical and historical importance of the Ne>matoll¿h orders and the fact that jurist and state views and policies have often been constructed on the basis of generalised ideas on Sufism in Iran (whether or not rural and/or urban), justify extrapolations from my urban Ne>matoll¿h cases to Iranian, Shi>ite Sufism at large. Three issues, finally, define in more detail the ways in which I conceive of the religious regimes of Iranian, Shi>ite Sufism as ›mystic regimesø. What particularises Sufi orders in this study has to do with meaning-power relations, the (religious) status of strategies, and, most generally, the conceptualisation of religion and mysticism. Meaning and power The concept of religious regime was put forward to tackle reduction-ism in the anthropology of religion and to explore ›the mutual condi-tioning of power and meaningø (BAX, 1987: 1). However, explicit and convincing treatments of (the uses of) symbols, ideas, or beliefs in shaping religious power (exceptions such as SCHNEIDERMAN, 1992 aside) remain rare. Nevertheless, meaning-power relations touch"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"12 INTRODUCTION upon a paradox that lies to the heart of mystic regimes: how are or-der, development and survival possible among large groups of people who explicitly and publicly loathe worldliness? In a reflection on fieldwork with the Ahl-e îaqq, MIR-HOSSEINI felt puzzled by the force with which informants appeared to reject the relevance of any ˆ¿hir (political) interpretation of [their] stories. On reflection, these [...] were not so much rejected as taken for granted. But they in-sisted on the overriding importance of the b¿Ãin [esoterical], and the stories seemed to show less the connections between the two worlds than their separation. I suggest that such a conceptual segregation [...] is necessary to sustain another central dogma of the sect, a dogma shared by all sectarians, that they alone are the ›followers of îaqqatø (Ultimate Truth) (1994, (1): 281). Taking this observation as a lead generates the hypothesis that such segregation - and the obfuscation of worldly existence - is a premise for the worldly, social and political prevalence of religious regimes. In his study of reification in the thought of Alfred Schutz, THOMA-SON (1982: 7) observed of ›successful communitiesø that they fiseemed almost always to involve patterns of daily life which members per-ceived as somehow independent of their own will and authority. The more firmly such patterns were backed by ›god givenø [...] beliefs, the more stable and persistent they were.‹ Mystic regimes transform tacit reification, fithe way people deny, forget or ignore the constructedness of their social worlds,‹ (THOMA-SON, 1982) into explicit religious ideology and practice. Spiritual progress means getting away from the fiI‹ and the fihere and now‹, and analogically, monotheistic mystics (according to ARMSTRONG, 1993: 243) have essentially fimade their God transcend the personal category.‹ The ›overriding importance of the esotericalø that MIR-HOSSEINI referred to invests Sufi leaders with authority and power. The Sufi path which leads towards unity and Truth and away from the shattered world of seductions, has been paved with spiritual au-thority, embodied in the masters who are uniquely equipped to guide the travellers. In the end, Sufis hold spiritual authority to derive itself from the transhistorical realm that produces initiatory dreams, illu-minating visions, miracles and missionary orders. The success or failure of such ideas largely depends on exterior forces - the pragmat-ics of interaction, the quality of performance - but acting is neverthe-less oriented towards such ›meaningø, which - through the mediation"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"13 INTRODUCTION of acting - conditions ›powerø. Internal relations are only one level, however, on which meaning conditions power in the constitution of order. At the crossroads of their external relations, mystic and competitor regimes forward le-gitimations and delegitimations that are oriented towards a transhis-torical Ursprung. Without exception, Iranian orders trace their (ulti-mate) descent to Imam >Al, whose existence many mystics hold to have preceded creation. A recurrent strategy of enemies, in turn (whether internal or external) has consisted of contesting these conti-nuities. Legitimacy lies in the past, which figures transhistorically in mystic regimes, but it becomes abruptly grounded and materialised in the contestation-and-defense genre. A related genre of legitimisation and delegitimisation in which transhistorical claims become groun-ded, concerns ›heresiologyø. In heresiology, fipolemics sets itself the task of determining the intangible point of dogma, the fundamental and necessary principle that the adversary has neglected, ignored or transgressed‹ and it fidenounces this negligence as a moral failing; at the root of the error, it finds passion, desire, interest, a whole series of weaknesses and inadmissible attachments that establish it as cul-pable‹ (a formulation I borrow from FOUCAULT, in RABINOW, 1991: 382, see chapter three). It is only to the background of these meaning-power complexes that one could make sense of a ›historical commissionø in one order - positivistically concerned with facts in a way that few contemporary Western historians would now favour - that denies history a material existence of its own. The uses of transhistorical idealism and its clo-sure thus enter the equation in meaningfully shaping lateral regime relations. Similar processes operate in the external relations between Sufi orders and the state. SPIER (1991: 27) mentioned general Pinochetøs choosing the com-pany of evangelists who claimed non-involvement in politics. In the previous monarchy, Iranian Sufis similarly denied worldliness. >Al >Anq¿ nevertheless occupied a parliament seat, while his father stated that rebellion was the greatest danger to cosmic harmony. In the Qa-jar era, inversely, a Sufi who was [only] fitalking to men of spiritual discernment‹ (POURJAVADI and WILSON, 1978: 117) (i.e. similarly distancing himself from worldly claims) warned the king that neglect of his spiritual authority would ruin his reign. This scenario of mystic power - it is claimed by Sufis - subsequently unfolded."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"14 INTRODUCTION Irrespective of the order, many Sufis hold Sufism to be a sophia perennis without temporal and spatial co-ordinates. But transhistori-cal and non-political definitions of mysticism made Sufism temporar-ily and politically attractive to the Shah, when faced with militant Islamic opposition (see chapter one). Religious obfuscations and political uses such as these indicate that fithe position of religious regimes in political arenas is [...] effected by the type of ideology and by the nature of the collective fantasy espoused‹ (THODEN VAN VEL-ZEN, 1992: 203). It has been royal receptivity towards Sufism that in turn came to figure in Sufi representations of the self (see chapter four).

These cases -in which prevailing political interest converges with otherworldly religious doctrine - provide instances where Sufi ›meaningø condi-tions ›powerø in both state and mystic regimes. Strategies While all regimes are concerned with questions of external confron-tation and internal cohesion (BAX, 1987: 3), they are also defined through strategy-led performance. But in SCOTTøs analyses, such performance has been related to a unilateral power dualism of domi-nant and subordinate, and opposed to ›authenticityø (GAL, 1995: 411). GAL (1995: 419) pointed out that strategies are ill-conceived as straightforward responses to unambiguous domination. Political function is mediated through language, which is embedded within what she calls ›linguistic ideologyø or culture. From this conception, it becomes plausible to conceive of strategic acts as cultural perform-ance: ›strategicø Sufi acting departs from and is embedded within ›authenticø genres, doctrine and discourse. Strategic and authentic acting applies, first of all, to the signs that distinguish Sufis from others: stigmata, and to their management (GOFFMAN, 1974). Sufi stigmata - in both the Greek sense of bodily markers of moral inferi-ority and the Christian sense of fibodily signs of holy grace‹ (1974: 11) - have divided into the loose signs of stigma that are easily man-aged, such as clothing and bodily movements, and institutionalised ones that stick, such as the Sufi lodge. The two aspects which have proved manageable in Sufi lodges, concern naming and adornment. Many lodges have changed their"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"15 INTRODUCTION names from kh¿naq¿h into úoseynya in the Islamic Republic, and they often included portraits of Khomeyni and Khamene<i. This ›strategicallyø facilitated accommodation in the Islamic Republic, but also ›authenticallyø defused conceptualisations of Sufi centres in op-position to the mosque. In the Qajar era, the king named the Sol-Ã¿n>alsh¿h leader Sa>¿dat>alsh¿h ›peacock of the gnosticsø, in reflec-tion of his expensive taste in clothing. In the Pahlavi era, customary civilian clothes became mandatory in many orders. Surely, these had Pahlavi modernisation projects as their context, but they also fitted an established shred of Sufi doctrine, which held social adaptation to be a religious duty. One has to do in these cases with multiple levels in one act - like in any other social drama but falling within the range of explicit religious doctrine in mystic, religious regimes - in which performance inextricably interweaves authenticity and strategy. Apart from scientific reporters, many believers oppose strategy to authenticity as well. DIGARD (1978: 512) justly remarked, however, that fiContrairement  ce que beaucoup de musulmans (et døautres croyants) pensent, il nøy a rien døinsultant pour eux ou de blasph¡-matoire  se demander si la conception quøils ont ou la pratique quøils font de leur religion r¡pond  une 9strat¡gieK.‹ While in response to an outsiderøs questioning the sheer suggestion may be indignantly brushed aside, religious (including mystic, Sufi) regimes have often been very explicit about the strategic nature of (religious) perform-ance in unprovoked representations of the self. In his historical sociology of Opus Dei ESTRUCH (1995) elaborated upon the sectøs modern concept of a saint, which included a this-worldly asceticism that prescribed ›schemingø, for which affiliates were prepared in open educational institutions. While many Sufis would deny anything like scheming, ›dissimulationø has doctrinal status in the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order (Pand-e ê¿leú, 1372/1993: 35), as among Shi>ites generally. An impeccably dressed affiliate once un-dressed in the lodge in one êaf>alsh¿h branch. Underneath his civil-ian clothes appeared a long white robe (kafan). He saw me watch him and explained: fiI couldnøt do this in the street.‹ Yet, there was no notion of insincerity in strategy here, let alone of fooling the ju-rists. It had to do with survival but also religiously prescribed pru-dence, and authentic distinctions between inner and outer realms. Strategic acts do not exhaust the range of religious performance, but one may turn the allegedly inimical relationship between strategy and"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"16 INTRODUCTION authenticity on its head as authenticity is often accomplished through strategy. Moreover, strategies vis--vis internal tensions and lateral and state regimes have taken on distinctive features in the Sufi regimes. To argue this point it is necessary to make another conceptual dis-tinction. TOUWEN-BOUWSMA (1992: 126) criticised the definition of religious regimes for its formality bias. She described a regime that was weakly institutionalised and made up of informal relations. A second, underdeveloped variable for Sufi regimes is proximity. To account for strategies in mystic regimes is to conceive of Sufi per-formance, ideal-typically and with these variations in mind, as a dif-ferentiation of acting into levels of formality and proximity. These variables distribute internal-formal, internal-informal, external-formal, and external-informal elements (cf. GILSENAN, 1973). Sufi orders are voluntary associations into which one is not born or integrated from an early age. Internally, therefore, and informally (i.e. not on temporally marked occasions or in specific ritual expres-sions) masters have had to rely heavily on qualitative guidance to keep their ›clientsø faithful. Their positions are at stake with perform-ance, and they often strive to minimize the orientation alternatives to zero (cf. BAX 1988: 20). It is simultaneously because of their depend-ence on public recognition, however, that one could hardly conceive of the dependencies between religious specialists and ›laymenø as patron and client relations, whereby specialists monopolise an imma-terial scarce good (as BAX, 1988: 10, summerises their interaction). The particularity of the internal/informal realm comes to the fore most strongly in its special relation to the esoteric (and Qur<¿nic) core (concept) of ›friendship with Godø (val¿yat) - also connoting ›guidanceø. Stigmatic proofs of friendship with God/guidance are not carried outside the lodge for public display. Having fibeen conveyed from heart to heart [while it] has not been written in books and its principles cannot be expressed in words‹ (Pand-e ê¿leú, 1372/1993: 35), val¿yat belongs to the innermost, divine realm of experience that ultimately breaches any form(ality). Formally, spiritual authority bears a relation to the quality of men-tal counselling, financial charity towards the flock and Sufi medita-tion (`ekr). When performed impeccably, meditations have integrated affiliates, reproduced hierarchy and respectability, and contained dissent. When these performances fail in containing dissent, compet-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"17 INTRODUCTION ing claims for spiritual authority are always incongruous - given the sacred nature of Sufi leadership - and exclusive. Internal authority challenges have often been settled through either the challengerøs formal separation or his formal expulsion. Differentiation between formal and informal, internal realms en-ables Sufi institutions such as initiation, presupposing grades of knowledge and their shielding. Where external constraints are heavy, the inner life becomes more important (religiously). Only in extreme circumstances would the mystic regimesø external relations be void of strategies, and unilaterally dictated by domina-tion. An inversely exceptional situation prevailed in the period 1836-1848, when one Ne>matoll¿h Sufi (î¿jj Mrz¿ ̇q¿s) wielded tre-mendous power in Iran through his influence on Moúammad Sh¿h Q¿j¿r - participating himself in state domination. In all other cases, that this study is mainly concerned with, there have been rather more delicate and moderate balances of power and performance. Twenti-eth-century patterns in relations to state and societal competitor re-gimes have included strategies to accommodate to and integrate into the prevailing worldly regimes. These strategies were matched by policies of patronage, co-optation, rejection and (ideological) sup-pression, vis--vis Sufism. Despite the fact that Sufis have generally defined their mystical Path on a par with the holy law - being a prerequisite for higher knowledge - external relations to Iranian jurist regimes have gener-ally been tense. Besides doctrinal reasons, this tension resulted mainly from competition for spiritual authority. From the eighteenth century to the present, one can nevertheless discern a gradual lessen-ing of Sufi hostility towards jurists, which coincided with the juristsø slow ascent to power. In the late Pahlavi period, most importantly, the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h leaders strategically balanced jurist and royalist loyalties, which proved useful to them after the revolution. As regards state relations, Sufi orders accommodated to and were to some extent co-opted by the nationalist, modernising state during the regime of Reza Shah (1921-1941). During the regime of Moham-med Reza Shah (1941-1979) the ordersø integration into elite circles was aided by the stateøs ideological and material royal patronage. In the Islamic Republic state ties were largely cut, but Sufis neverthe-less managed to attract important clerics with state ties to their ses-sions, and accommodate Sufi spirituality to regime religiosity. The"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"18 INTRODUCTION component of reproduction in mystic regimes which was external and informal (i.e. not circumscribed in Sufi rules) has consisted, therefore, of public or private relations to people in high places. Formal and external strategy and ›authenticø religiosity in the Is-lamic Republic has involved charitable donations during the Iran-Iraq war, announcements of public gatherings, ›open housesø on Shi>ite occasions, and cheap medical services. The mystic regimesø persis-tent denial of any relevance in informal relations to people in high places has in turn credited the voluntary and disinterested nature of formal-external acts. In these strategies, Sufi performance managed to establish religious authenticity as much as the Ahl-e îaqq did through conceptual segregation (MIR-HOSSEINI, 1994, (1): 281). The most important conceptual segregation, and its practical im-plementation, has concerned the internal and external Sufi realms. It has particularly been on the ›outsideø that conformity was required in Sufi relations towards the orders that be, while the ›insideø was re-served for Sufi spirituality (see chapter seven). In different political regimes and across the orders, there has been patterned variation in these ›authentic strategiesø, vis--vis internal tensions, and external relations to lateral and state regimes. In other words, these historical patterns were given shape to by the cultural performances that have distinguished one mystic regime from the other. Religion and mysticism Only separate elements in GEERTZøs universalist definition of relig-ion (1973 [1966]) have retained their descriptive value since the ori-ginal publication. Paraphrasing, these elements include 1) a system of symbols [which establish] 2) long-lasting moods and motivations [by formulating] 3) conceptions of a general order of existence [and clothing these] 4) conceptions with [such] an aura of factuality [that] 5) moods and motivations [result] which seem uniquely realistic. Ignoring the text between brackets, it can be easily demonstrated that in a superficial sense these elements are descriptive of Shi>ism in Iran: 1) the colour black, the sword, the rosary and saintly shrines are among many symbols that refer to central themes and conceptions in Shi>ism; 2) collective emotion involved in mourning ceremonies testifies to long-lasting moods - the ›memoryø of Karbala - and moti-vations - a sense of injustice and militancy; 3) the Imamate -"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"19 INTRODUCTION Shi>ismøs theological core - is a cosmology; 4) During > ̇sh ́r¿, Imam îoseynøs transhistorical battle between good/ truth and evil/falsehood is narrated and depicted in a manner as concrete and historically detailed as possible, and 5) the smooth effectiveness with which the above cosmological event was transferred to contemporary circumstances in the Islamic revolution illustrates the uniquely realis-tic semblance of these moods and motivations. However, ASAD (1993) convincingly contested the central tenet of the universalist definition that connects these elements in Geertzøs theory - that fireligious symbols are sui generis, marking out an inde-pendent religious domain‹ (op. cit., p. 52, cf. BAX, 1987). ASADøs cri-tiques centre around the argument that (religious) symbols do not by themselves produce and define moods, motivations or cosmology, but only through the power of the institutions, disciplines, discourses and practices with which they are intrinsically connected (cf. op. cit., pp. 33, 35, 37). Moreover, the power and the authority of particular symbols, and that which makes these symbols possible in the first place and simultaneously rules out others, are definitely fito be ex-plained as products of historically distinctive [...] forces‹ (op. cit., p. 54, my emphasis). Religious symbols, then, are not central to this study, while the Sufi orders that produce these, in historically distinctive relations to other regimes, are. The cognitive centrality of ›beliefø in Geertzøs definition - a distinctly modern and Christian one (ASAD, 1993: 47) -is a similar point of divergence. Sufi orders embody a heterogeneity of beliefs, but some are more powerful than others. Spiritual progress has been dependent upon guidance, and it is the authority structures that define assemblies of Sufis as orders, which provide powerful symbols, beliefs with a heavy fundament. As concerns the study of Islam, TAPPER usefully proposed its an-thropology to chart fihow Muslims (individuals, groups [...]) pre-sent/construct themselves [and others] as Muslims [and non-Muslims]‹ [my insertions] (1995: 192). However, to avoid this nomi-nalism from turning into an Empty Vessel Theory of Islam that ig-nores persistent social and ideational patterns, the anthropology of Islam ought to chart, in addition, how presentations and constructions are shaped by and result in figurations: structured and changing pat-terns of interdependent people (ELIAS, 1970). In other words: one would study regimes by relating constructions and dependencies in a"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"20 INTRODUCTION way similar to ASADøs usage of ›social disciplinesø (1993: 53). Secondly, fiAmong the conclusions [of] the anthropological study of religion [is] that certain religious ideas are universal and seem as old as human society‹ (STEVENS, 1996: 1088). Mysticism has been one persistent social and ideational pattern that defies a plain nominalism. Mysticism in monotheistic religions has often been in juxtaposi-tion to orthodoxy - now as a complement, then as a hostile adversary (cf. ARMSTRONGøs comparisons, 1993), or to intellectualist varieties of religious experience (AUDEN, 1965). Mystic and orthodox regimes not only constitute different ways of life, however, but also compet-ing parties for scarce spiritual authority. WEBERøs sociology of relig-ion (1977 [1922]) offers surprisingly little on these this-worldly con-flicts beyond psychological, Jamesian (1963) ›varieties of religious experienceø. In Christianity, contestations of the nature of resurrec-tion and monotheism have from an early day defined spiritual author-ity - dyadic in hierarchy, church-like, or dual, master-disciple like -among communities of believers. Religious debate bore social and political implications from the outset: fiWhen gnostic and orthodox Christians were debating the nature of God, they were at the same time debating [...] spiritual authority‹ (PAGELS, 1985: 59). The challenge to spiritual authority was never far off in mystic imagery. Despite the fact that early Jewish mystics fiwere anxious not to antagonise‹ the rabbis, their ›throne mysticismø fiimagined God as a mighty king who could only be approached in a perilous journey through the seven heavens‹ (ARMSTRONG, 1993: 245). The thirteenth-century Persian, Islamic equivalent is >AÃÃarøs ›Discourse of the Birdsø (ManÃeq oÃ-Ãeyr), in which thirty birds undertake a similarly perilous journey, many dying along the way, to be (re)united with a mystical king who turns out to be ›thirty birdsø (Smorgh). Such images of power might be symbolical, of inner states, but could also have their bearing on outer states, and embody claims to worldly power. Of Islamic spiritual authority it was observed that fiMuslims high-light continuous genealogies as guarantors of authority [in, for in-stance,] chains of Sufi teaching [...] that link practitioners to the founder of a Sufi order‹ (BOWEN, 1993: 186). The living Sufi centre of authority is the sheikh, pr or qoÃb. As disciples invest spiritual authority in his person to the extent that cosmic balances are thought dependent upon his being, filøhistoire des saints nøest que løhistoire de leur autorit¡‹ (KERROU, 1998: 32)."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"21 INTRODUCTION Here mystic regimes stand out as particular religious regimes. Charismatic leadership is characteristic of all religious organisation, which often establishes spiritual authority as a mediation of sacred texts and personalities. Mystic regimes, however, more strikingly so than religious regimes in general, are characterised by personalised charismatic leadership, in the sense that Sufi masters embody author-ity. Sufi authority has thus resembled royal authority - kingshipøs ›divine splendourø in Iran, more than God-ordained, mainly derived from this-worldly values of force and might. Jurist authority, to the contrary, built largely on ethical or spiritual brokerage - representa-tion - of the Prophetic and Imamic messages (see chapter seven). Although few Sufis would publicly juxtapose themselves to jurists, there are three potential challenges in mysticism to orthodoxy: com-peting mystic readings of scripture and holy men (Prophet and Imams), particular competence claims for such readings, and the autonomous source of spiritual authority in the figure of the sheikh. It is when these challenges materialise in conflict, that continuous gene-alogies are often contested. In both Ne>matoll¿h regimes, stories abound of affluent leaders in other orders, and wealth was in some cases visible in the ordersø real estate property. Despite this, my fieldwork has not produced incon-testable facts concerning property relations, financial administration, stipends, etc. An important reason is that Sufi spiritual authority has often depended upon a masterøs ability to dissociate himself from concerns with worldly gain. Thus, the economic conditions which enable Sufi organisation belong to the realm of secret knowledge as much as spiritual instruction during initiation. In competition for spiritual authority, however, financial morality enters the equation. fiTo accept money is to destroy the morality of the act,‹ a Sufi related of the behaviour of a competitor, who in his turn had accused the former of embezzlements. Economic resources thus figure in my research not primarily as economic infrastructure, but as narrative devices in competitions for spiritual authority. Military power has been ruled out for Sufis since the Iranian state monopolised the legitimate use of force - which fits an evolutionary pattern in the relations between states and religious regimes (cf. BAX, 1987: 3). Beyond military and economic concerns, however, spiritual authority is a scarce good and an end in itself. Whether or not spoils are its produce, spiritual authority has remained a desirable asset"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"22 INTRODUCTION because of its intrinsic religious value. Although Sufi spiritual authority has seen attempts at monopolisa-tion of the means of orientation in internal and external strife, this has not effectively outdone alternatives. The orders have had no means at their disposal - this reflects Shi>ite organisation in general -to prevent affiliates from changing spiritual masters. In this respect, EICKELMANøs observation that fithere is an ›essential loosenessø [...] about Islamic religious organisation‹ (1981: 293) is particularly to the point for modern Iranian Sufism. But most important as an impedi-ment to violent conflict, few Sufis have ever presented the Sufi Path (Ãarqat) as an alternative to the holy Islamic Law (shar>at). This study thus discusses indigenously Islamic, mystic regimes. * * * Part One addresses academic regimes - research paradigms - in the study of Sufism, and it explores the long-term developmental history of the Ne>matoll¿h Sufi order. Chapter one depicts a wondrous episode in which a range of transnational interests colluded in transhistorical and mystical explo-rations of Iranian Shi>ism. After 1945, Henry Corbin and several Ira-nian colleagues set out to reconstruct Shi>ism, to arrive at ›the origin of any perspectiveø. They reached their destination through a quietist definition of Shi>ism in the midst of political turmoil, and by then paradoxically becoming, after Corbinøs death and after the Islamic revolution, a token of respectability for political Islam. This episode is illustrative of a crucial mechanism in mystic regimes: non-political and transhistorical definitions of religiosity serve exterior and tempo-ral political purposes. But it also bears testimony of excessive ideal-ism in Corbinøs ›hermeneutical phenomenologyø of Shi>ism, which was epistemologically bound to miss the real social dynamics. Cor-bin was himself part of this dynamics, which resulted in the esoteri-cally inconceivable Islamic revolution. Chapter two seeks to ground the exploration of Ne>matoll¿h his-tory in a different analysis. It begins by addressing Corbinøs unitary conceptualisation of Shi>ism, underlying which were neglected histo-ries of conflict about spiritual authority that have been constitutive of Sufism. In Weberian ideal-types, these conflicts were conceptualised in a dichotomy of law and ›experienceø in Islam. The dichotomyøs use"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"23 INTRODUCTION as a tool of analysis is limited, however, because of a pattern of over-lap between Sufis and jurists, antinomian traditions that dissolve Sufism as a unitary object, and the centrality of the state in shaping Sufi-jurist relations. The centrality of the state remains similarly unaccounted for in several exemplary studies in the historical anthro-pology of Islam, which complemented the law-and-experience di-chotomy with an equally Weberian duality of modernity and tradi-tion. Beyond the grid of these too rigid notions, it is argued, the so-cial development of Shi>ite Sufism in Iran has taken shape through contingent factors such as state centralisation and royal patronage. The eighteenth-century reestablishment of the Ne>matoll¿h regi-me in Iran developed through two figurations. Initially, the relations of Sufis derived mainly from local rulersø competition for power in the absence of a central state. The internal dynamics which enhanced Sufi power, consisted of a massive growth in the number of converts, which could not be checked by either rulers or jurists. Rulers often feared jurists in the second figuration, which had the reunified state at its centre. Rulersø Sufi patronage strengthened Sufi challenges of jurist authority. Nineteenth-century Iran did not witness the disap-pearance of ›traditionalø Sufis through the ascent of jurist-led, ›mod-ernø religiosity, but, instead, Sufismøs socio-political renaissance. Part Two deals with the Ne>matoll¿h regimes in the Pahlavi Dy-nasty (1921-1979). In 1976, a French Ahl-e îaqq convert observed that file champ du soufisme iranien est encore  explorer‹ (DURING, 1976: 124). GRAMLICHøS studies of Iranian Shi>ite Sufi orders (1965, 1976, 1981) provided unique material and hitherto unparalleled analy-ses of Sufi religiosity and ritual life in the Pahlavi period. However, these detailed analyses lacked a generalising treatment of Sufismøs socio-political development, while it may be generalised for oriental studies that fiacademic treatments of Sufism [...] rarely enter the modern period‹ (MCGREGOR, 1997: 255). Chapter three describes Sufismøs transformation in the context of the nation-state. The Ne>matoll¿h orders lost much of their exterior power through the Constitutional Revolution (1905-1911) and in the period 1921-1941, under Reza Khan/Reza Shah, because their inti-mate state ties were cut. Sufism transformed with the new regimes, as the nation(-state) became a prime marker of legitimate identity. Internally, nationalistic modernisation and the dismantling of tradi-tional power bases that occurred in their name, were paralleled by"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"24 INTRODUCTION Sufi struggles for spiritual authority. Master-disciple relations changed shape as Ne>matoll¿h Sufis took issue with self-explanatory rule, and implicitly asked for relevance to the nation-state in Sufi spiritual authority. Nationalistic modernisation similarly provided external contexts for lateral and state relations. In their external rep-resentations, too, the Ne>matoll¿h Sufi regimes redirected their focus to the particular audience of the Iranian nation. Chapter four examines contrary Sufi regimes in the face of politi-cal polarisation. The nation-state remained an important frame of reference for the late twentieth-century Ne>matoll¿h orders. Its rep-resentation by the late Pahlavi regime, however, became a ground for political contestation. Iranian Sufism in the period 1941-1979 had royal patronage as an important context, in the face of growing oppo-sition. Different degrees of royal patronage - from personal sponsor-ing to ideological incorporation - relate to both the êaf>alsh¿h or-derøs social prominence and to the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h orderøs sudden religious opposition. Internally, the êaf>alsh¿h order remained a theatre of conflict, which now involved religious and political contes-tation of the aristocratic Freemasonry leadership. The SolÃ¿n->alsh¿hs, in contrast, established conspicuous unitary order. Exter-nally, the êaf>alsh¿h elite integrated deeply into the stately regime, while the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs developed relations to the clerical regime that came to represent the Iranian nation more successfully. Their relative independence provided crucial room for manoeuvre when the balance of religious power shifted and the political tide swept away the Shahøs regime. Part Three explores the Ne>matoll¿h regimesø comparative social development and cultural performance in the Islamic Republic. Until 1996, the history of the Republic divided into three periods, in which the state ideology successively emphasised the supremacy of Islam alone (›Islam-Islamø), then blended it with patriotism (›Islam-Iranø), and finally, from 1989, with full blown nationalism (›Iran-Iranø). Chapter five treats the Sufi regimes in the ›decade of war and re-volutionø (MENASHRI, 1990). Initially, the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs were con-fronted with oppression, but switching sides before the revolution paid off for them. They sought legitimacy in mourning sessions for deceased notables and acted as a national patron of caritas. The êaf->alsh¿hs, to the contrary, were haunted by their Freemasonry reputa-tion. Their lodge was occupied, and once it was recovered, they in-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"25 INTRODUCTION volved themselves in slander concerning financial morality. While the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs enhanced their reputation through religious na-tionalism (externally), the êaf>alsh¿hsø public, Shi>ite mourning ce-remonies were deliberately kept apart from the lodgeøs Sufi activities. They did not, therefore, improve on êaf>alsh¿h legitimacy. While the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs retained unquestioned and hereditary leadership (internally), the êaf>alsh¿hs dissolved into small rival groups, over which the central leadership retained only marginal leverage. In spite of multi-faceted adversity, however, êaf>alsh¿h (hi)stories tell one not of jurist-led state persecution, but of accommodation. Chapter six probes an ideological rapprochement between Sufism and the state from 1989, through Sufismøs continuous ethical r¡veil and the emergence of ›state mysticismø. To some extent the state it-self engaged in a revolutionary variety of mysticism, and it was ob-served that many lodges embarked on a ›second lifeø (îAêçR, 1375/1997: 8). The êaf>alsh¿h leadership saw itself devoid of spiri-tual authority and focused, neutrally, on the image of êaf>alsh¿h. External, public performances pointed to the politicised context of mystical martyrdom, under the surface of traditional Sufi/Shi>ite laments. Among the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs, internal order remained uncon-tested. The leadership of Maúb ́b>alsh¿h had been authorised by divine sanction and by his fatherøs meticulous preparation for it. His death presented itself in an historical continuity of saintly Islamic martyrdom, which in turn credited Maúb ́b>alsh¿høs visionary letters of appointment (and vice versa). Maj` ́b>alsh¿høs subsequent new proclamation of allegedly old rules - for external as much as internal consumption - outlined a meticulously detailed socio-political mod-esty, but - as if in exchange for it - it also circumscribed an exclusive realm of Sufi spiritual authority. The formality of these assertive SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h rules revealed strength and confidence. The order argued the legitimacy of its spiritual realm by referring to relations with Khomeyni. Its success, and the effects of state mysticism, be-came apparent in 1997 when several mollahs and prominent clerics paid their respect. Part Four and chapter seven bring the explorations of comparative social development and cultural performance on a broader theoretical plane, by confronting them with discussions concerning civil society. Observers spotted an emergent civil society in Iran after Khomeyniøs demise, in a revival of associational life and civil thought. However,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"26 INTRODUCTION civil thought has remained confined, while many associations are to be conceived of as ideological state institutions at best. Regarding the classical definition of civil society - civility and associational life beyond primordial attachments, significantly independent from the state - the Sufi regimes have not been a clear referent either. Modern Iranian Sufism as represented by the Ne>matoll¿h orders has been characterised by internal and external relations that consti-tute a mirror image of the classical civil society. Internally, relations have been primordial - in the sense of exclusive and hidden face-to-face interaction, not meaningfully extending beyond the proximity of direct communication. Externally, relations have been characterised by either ideological or material state affiliations. Two arguments which apply in particular to the Islamic Republic, add to the qualifi-cation. Sufismøs relations to socio-political aims have now been largely severed, while the ordersø and the stateøs authority structures, both of which stress exclusive spiritual authority, are analogous. Once one takes the historical emergence of Western civil societies as a comparison, however, various parallels become evident. There are two instances in which Sufism meaningfully relates to the civil society - though in paradoxical ways. Western civil societies origi-nated from literary and artistic circles and debating clubs, not from politically assertive mutual interest groups (HABERMAS, 1990). An important new strain in Iranian intellectual discourse in which Suf-ism figures passively as a recurrent reference, provides a parallel. Secondly, Western public space, in advance of any full-fledged civil public sphere, was first established within societies which were not only mute and inward looking, but also closed and secretive, con-fined to selective memberships. The Ne>matoll¿h regimes have been the bearers of a shielded religiosity of their own - which by implica-tion means non-state religiosity, no matter to what extent they ac-commodated to the public transcript. Thus they confronted, if largely willy-nilly, the stateøs ›colonisation of the lifeworldø. * * * My fieldwork in Iran in 1996, 1997 and 1998 has nearly covered one year. It has been the sort of cursory project - no initiation - that Sufis would certainly consider a worldly vanity and dangerous enterprise.

One Sufi, filled with laughter, mentioned ›one university professorø who was ›his own pupilø (ye ost¿d-e d¿neshg¿h mord-e khvod b ́d), while others added that if I wanted to learn anything, I had no choice but to ›go (all) the wayø (b¿yad r¿h raft). There are no claims in this study of knowledge ›from the insideø in the Sufi sense of the term, but the esteemed company of the Sufis (and the literature I collected during my stay) nevertheless produced some essential ingredients for a broad outline of historical development. These ingredients included glimpses of an emerging pattern. During my last visit in September 1998, I was led into an informal gathering by Sufis whom I had previously known, which - to my great surprise - turned out to be a ›class of mysticismø (kel¿s-e >er-f¿n). In the gatherings I had previously visited, which were ranging from very formal, lodge-based congregations to almost spontaneous meetings, hierarchical master-disciple relations had always been among the defining features. Here, the relations of master and disci-ples had been transformed into teacher (ost¿d) - pupil (sh¿gerd) rela-tions. While average Sufi gatherings had been decisively monologi-cal, the class of mysticism featured dialogue, which began by the teacher asking what passages in Rumiøs Ma¢nav his audience would like to read. It ended with him - as far as I could judge, sincerely -inquiring whether or not his evocations and explanations of mystic matters had been to the satisfaction of his audience. The authoritative words spoken in average Sufi gatherings were not usually subject to verbal exchanges, but here, the pupils subjected their teacherøs discourse to questions, and, where his answers were not deemed sufficient, friendly but deliberate discussion. The new class of mysticism included a widely varied audience, which simi-larly contrasted with Sufi gatherings I had previously witnessed. There were some fifteen people, young children among them, women with and without the úej¿b, a teacher of yoga who held a low opinion of Islam, and Sufis dedicated to traditional Islamic exegesis. In re-sponse to one particular ›pointeø (nokte) in the teacherøs Ma¢nav-exegesis, and as if generally reflecting the structure of the gathering, one pupil raised an issue which reminded of the fundamental debates that currently rage within the world of Iranian Shi>ism: Religion is similar to taste.

The teacher of the flock, finally, was brought at one point to the statement that fiAnyone who grows takes his environment into consideration; only people with a closed mind want to dominate anything and everything. If one takes everything, one engages in the relations of hell.

Driving back home after a Sufi congregation, Moúammad spoke in a secretive voice: fiNow I will tell you some-thing. Pay attention.‹ He sadly proclaimed: fiThe Arabs came by the sword, subjecting neighbouring peoples and violating their ways of life.‹ Only the Iranians (it is often heard) had retained their language and culture. fiBut we saw the virtue of the Message, and saved it from them.‹ An inverse account has Sufism as a stronghold of alien or repressive power in Iran, from the outset. Enemies associate Suf-ism with Zoroastrian despotism, Greek philosophical pollution of Islamic theology, or illegitimate Christian monasticism. For many who are involved in either its propagation or denuncia-tion, Sufism equals its origins. These origins may be alluded to in historical contexts such as the Arab invasion, but they are not often thought to occupy an historical locus, i.e. one restricted by temporal and spatial dimensions. They are rather seen as the manifestation of an essence. ›Iranø, ›Shi>ismø and ›Sufismø are conceived as preor-dained qualities rather than decipherable units in this perspective, manifest to the surface of their appearance. Explaining history, a Ne>matoll¿h Sufi told me that his order had ›always just been thereø. Sufis resist historical objectivation more sharply when it comes to what Sufism actually does. They either describe spiritual experience as a transcendence of time, as reaching the place where time is no longer, or as the point in consciousness where one drowns in the state of the ›nowø that shatters past and future by absorbing all. A quest for the referent in time (x) of a particular event (y) remains pointlessly grounded where a sheikh is honoured for his spiritual ascent or si-multaneous presence in different places.

Sufismøs enemies are rather understood as a geographically and historically indistinct, universal type of ›spiritu-ally lesser endowed creaturesø. Transhistorical essentialism, then, which enemies and participants alike employ in Sufismøs discussion, is a defining feature of the discursive universe of Iranian Sufism. If not abhorred, ›the socialø is often deemed irrelevant: there was no response from the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order when the nationalist histo-rian Ahmad Kasravi publicly castigated Sufism as a whole for all of Iranøs social ills in the 1940s. But its relevance shows in the wars of words that have been waged between Ne>matoll¿h Sufis and orders with competitive, mutually exclusive claims for spiritual leadership. Since 1945, an authoritative account of Iranian, Shi>ite spirituality by Henry Corbin mirrored the essentialist Sufi vision of the self 2 and its negation of social historicity. Corbin and a group of Iranian friends and colleagues defined Shi>ism as an essentially ›immanentø and transhistorical esoteric tradition, far removed from any worldly, material and political concerns. A major context for this late twen-tieth century configuration was a state interest in Sufism, which was in some ways beneficial to the definition of a national identity and as a counterweight to political Islam. The Shah and the Empress Farah had Sufis in their entourage, as religious teachers and advisors. ›Cor-binismø also marked an esoterical shift in the definition of Sufism,3 which had previously become worldlier in the context of the nation-state. Corbinøs views were in turn overrun by the Iranian revolution, an ›exteriorø and historical sociological event that bore witness to a different Islamism. His esoterism and the construction of a quietist Shi>ism thus came full circle with his death in 1978.

His teacher Louis Massignon had presented Corbin with one of Sohra-wardøs texts in 1928, which had marked the beginning of his interest in Islamic mystisicm.6 The plan was for Corbin to stay three months, but his stay lasted until 1945 because of the war. In August 1944, the Biblioth£que Nationale issued another ›ordre de missionø, for Persia this time, and on 14 September 1945, Corbin arrived in Tehran.7 In Tehran, Corbin set out to study Iranian Shi>ism, which he felt 4 NARAGHI, 1976: 96.

From the 1960s, a circle of Shi>ite scholars and friends assembled around Corbin in Tehran, among whom were professor of Islam and court-intimate Seyyed Hossein Nasr, diplomat 9H ́shang Besh¿rat, and philosopher-theologian >All¿me $ab¿Ãab¿<. Many literate Sufis in Tehran are familiar with Corbin, whose work had significantly helped define their spirituality. In so far as a Sufi sentiment against historical sociology (or more specifically his-toricism and historical materialism) is formulated in an explicit the-ory of transcendental history, it often directly derives from him. One Tehrani sheikh I spoke with even referred to ›la gnoseø rather than to >erf¿n or ta§avvof in an explanation of Sufi mysticism. More than Michel Foucaultøs short excursion into Iranian spirituality in 1978, which remained firmly rooted in French post-structuralist concerns (and ended in a public apology),10 Corbinøs exploration of Shi>ism became a laudatory definition of it, blurring boundaries between sympathetic scholarship and exegetic participation. Corbinøs exegetic participation involved hermeneutical phenome-nology. Hermeneutics meant ›reconduire une chose  sa sourceø, where ›sourceø has the meaning of an essence, of ›the origin of any perspectiveø. To establish that which must be relocated required phe-nomenology, which meant ›sauver les ph¡nom£nesø, or reconstructing phenomena as they are conceived by the subject.11 To write history 8 CORBIN repeatedly referred to Shi>ism as fila tradition ininterrompue de la gnose (silsilat al-<irfn)‹ (En Islam iranien, 1971, (1): 110). 9 SHAYEGAN, 1990: 25, 27; CORBIN, 1971, (1): 6; 1972, (1): 220-1, 3. NASR es-timated the influence of Corbin in Iran to have been quite large (1977: 25). 10 The relations between Corbin and Foucault, intellectual and other, have re-mained largely unexplored. It seems obvious though, inferring from the similarity of their theme (Iranian spirituality) and from Corbinøs fame in France at the time, that Foucault was partly inspired by the former. Perhaps the fact that FOUCAULT had already spoken out strongly against transcendental history (1972) and afterwards never gave up this position, is the reason for his exploration not to have developed into the kind of willed blending of ›Westernø and ›Easternø perspectives that is so striking in Corbinøs project (cf. STAUTH, 1991). Corbinøs pupil Daryush Shayegan, fiwho like [...] Foucault, had come to express his admiration for the spiritual dimen-sion of the Iranian revolution,‹ again like Foucault engaged fiin a theoretical autocri-tique‹ after the Islamic revolution (in 1982) (BOROUJERDI, 1996: 153-4). 11 CORBIN, 1971, (1): XIX, XX; 143; xix.

But En Islam iranien, intended to be a timeless understanding of Iranian Shi>ism, would develop a life of its own, and attain temporally distinct political meanings that were exterior to the intentions of its author. Exteriority ›Exteriorityø is a term coined by Michel Foucault, which marked a position contrary to hermeneutics and phenomenology.13 It refers to the quality of autonomy in historical phenomena - beyond the scope of an actorøs intentionality or subjectivity - and thus it stands opposed to Corbinøs initiatory comprehension.

Secondly, I explore exteriority in the forward direction through the notion of its ›unintended consequencesø: after Corbinøs demise, En Islam iranien was used for contemporary political purposes. 1. There was an historical dissatisfaction with the Western here and now in Corbinøs work. Western universities and Western society, he felt, and wrote, were conquered by positivism and Marxism. Corbin conceived of transhistorical spirituality as universal religiosity, but the predominance in Western academia and society of historicism15 had eroded the possibility of relating meaningfully to it. En Islam iranien was an attempt to restore lost spirituality, and explicitly a critique of modernity16 that in some ways resembled the views and writings of his friend and source of inspiration Martin Heidegger. Corbinøs contact with Heidegger dated back to 1931, when the two met in Freiburg. The context for the encounter was a series of Ger-man travels (1930-1936), in which Corbin discovered various Chris-tian thinkers and mystics (such as Karl Barth). Heidegger entrusted the French translation of Was ist Metaphysik? (1929) to Corbin, which was published - with fragments of Sein und Zeit (1927) - in 1938.17 One observes Heideggerøs intellectual influence on Corbin in three interrelated themes: the fate of the West (that nowadays also mutilated the East), in the face of the alienating hegemony of a technological mode of life, which destroyed the authentic life. After the war, Corbin brought Heideggerøs hermeneutics to Iran with him, and the Western criticism of self in turn made a lasting impact on Iranian Shi>ites. More directly, Corbinøs and Heideggerøs Western views affected spiritual perspectives in Corbinøs Iranian circle. 15 Historicism for Corbin did not connote Popperøs critique of History as Predic-tion, but referred to the explication of mental phenomena in terms of their temporal and social contexts. Cf. 1971, (1): 22-38, for Corbinøs critique of Marxism and of positivism. 16 fiCorbin pose des questions sous lesquelles on sent percer une certaine in-qui¡tude.

Since the revolution, fieldwork-based Western studies of Iranian Shi>ism from a hermeneutic perspective have been rare. Exception-ally, LOEFFLER (1988) wrote an empirically valuable account of ›re-ligious beliefs in a Persian villageø. It shared in some of the views of symbolic anthropology - which, through Geertz, reached back to the German hermeneutic tradition.31 Like Corbin, symbolic anthropology has generally approached religion as a self-contained system of meaning.32 In Islam Observed (1968) GEERTZ accounted for a ›re-ligious perspectiveø by triangular relations with ›worldviewø and ›ethosø. Explaining challenges to ›religious hypothesesø (pp. 276-9), Loeffler employed a similarly idealist scheme. There were challenges from within the religious system - new experiences, mystical insights, meanings discovered in texts - and external ones - disconfirming evi-dence from thought systems outside religion - but none of these incor-porated the socio-political factors that determine religious regimes. Loeffler convincingly charted a series of religious types, but they seemed devoid of mutual relations and always to have been ›just thereø. From his text it is not difficult to reconstruct his religious ty-pology, however, in more exterior, temporal terms. The ›fundamen-talistø lamented the ›decline of morality in modern education and lifestylesø. Loeffler summarised: fiHis version turns out to be in many respects just about the opposite of what the modernist Craftsman considers to be the pure Islam‹ (p. 286).

This context also applied to the Mysticøs praise of fiWesteners, who take great pains in developing industry so that people can live in ease, [and who] will discover the [Way] sooner than most of us‹ (p. 131). Within the same temporal frame, the ›representative of the peopleø lamented American ›oppressors in Vietnamø and ›injusticeø in the United States (p. 96).

SPOONER justly concluded that Islam in Prac-tice undervalued social dynamics and historical trends (1996: 403; 406) - a practice that Corbin had made into a research methodology. After the revolution, Corbinøs studies have not sunk into oblivion in Iran, nor have they fallen into disrepute. Given Corbinøs quietist representations of Shi>ism, receptivity towards them in the Islamic Republic strikes one as an ironical fate; an unintended consequence. French copies and Persian translations of his work (and that of $ab¿Ãab¿<, as well as that of Nasr, who explicitly favoured the Shah) are found in many bookstores in Tehran. And paradoxically, the mys-tical prose, devoid of any politics, is considered politically correct.33 Islamists and Sufis alike - beyond historical conflicts on the social plane - often argue their relevance in the modern world in reference to ›the spiritual crisis of the Westø, of which Corbin had provided them with an ›authenticø account.34 Corbin has remained a figure of authority not only for mystical representations of self, but also for the political legitimacy of statist, republican Islam.

Corbinøs post-revolutionary reception was parallelled in the Pahlavi period: fieven in the midst of a rampant antiorientalist campaign in Iran in the 1960s and 1970s warm testimonies to certain types of orientalists never fell out of fashion with the higher echelons of the Iranian academic establishment. For example, in 1963 and 1977 Tehran University published two books in honor of French orientalists Henri Mass¡ [...] and Henry Corbin‹ (BOROUJERDI, 1996: 143). 34 Corbin had developed close ties to - among many influential Iranians - various Sufi masters (NASR, 1977: 25).

After all, En Islam iranien was more than anything else a beautiful work of art, and an initiation - for believers - into Islam Corbanien.41 This was a standing joke among some of the French academic community in Tehran. Others have preceded my evaluation, in a similar mixture of respect and epistemological unease. This is what HODGSON (1974, 3: 45), for instance, had to say about some of Corbinøs work: fiHenry Corbin has beautifully set forth the devo-tional meaning of the >¿lam al-mith¿l in several works, and especially in Terre c¡leste et corps de r¡surrection: de løIran mazd¡en  løIran shî'ite (Paris, 1960), in which he attempts incidentally to show such continuities as can be surmised be-tween the old Mazdean angelology and that of Islam (flavouring his description with a romantic Iranian nationalism not really borne out by his data). Corbinøs ›The Visionary Dream in Islamic Societyø, in The Dream and Human Societies, ed. G. E. von Grunebaum and Roger Caillois (University of California Press, 1960), pp. 381-408, deals with the >¿lam al-mith¿l [....] Corbinøs magnificent perceptiveness has made us aware of the importance of both Mull¿ êadr¿ and Mr D¿m¿d [....] Unfortu-nately, in pursuit of his romanticism Corbin can be historically inexact. Thus he sometimes translates as if the text contrasted an Oriental ›theosophyø to a Peripatetic (and implicitly Western) ›philosophyø, where the text refers simply to Ishr¿qis and Peripatetics, as names of schools, without either geographical or disciplinary speci-fication. This is an instance of his frequent overdetermination in translating techni-cal terms: for instance, he renders >¿lam al-mith¿l as world of archetypes, rather than something simpler like images, making his textsø inclusion of mirror images seem absurd.‹ As concerns ›romantic Iranian nationalismø, Corbin wrote within a well-established French tradition: fiLe Chiisme offrit une expression  cette nation-alit¡ qui søobstinait  survivre [...] løid¡e persane se r¡incarna sous une forme re-ligieuse [....] Le Chiisme pr¡serva les Persans‹ (AUBIN, 1908: 458). In pre-revolution Iran itself there were critical voices too.

In Corbinøs experience, the Shi>ite universe incorporated ten-sion: fià løUniversité théologique traditionelle de Qomm [...] løemploi des mots tasawwof et soufi fait passer une ombre sur les visages.‹1 As a solution, he adopted authoritative Iranian distinctions between ›trueø and ›falseø Sufis, which restored Shi>ismøs transhistorical unity. Righteous ones were unambiguously involved with gnostic mysticism (>erf¿n), while tricksters, impostors and clowns were counteracting the shar>a.2 The underlying reality was an enduring collision of epistemic orders that constitutes a point of departure for the interpretation of conflict. Confrontations between Shi>ite Sufis and other Muslims have been, more than anything else, about spiritual authority (discourse about which Corbin, too, considered as among Shi>ismøs unifying themes).3 Contestations of spiritual authority, in the realm of the state, the semi-nary or within the confines of the lodge, point to political economy. With spiritual authority have come power and wealth, and the enemies of Sufism still reproach the fourteenth century Sh¿h Ne>matoll¿h Val for both. Moreover, spiritual authority has often been a scarcity in itself, as much as power and wealth, because of its largely exclusive defini-tions, and because the competing parties have striven after monopoly.

Shi>ite Imamate doctrine holds that the prophecy was fol-lowed by an Imamic ›cycle of guidanceø (d¿<erat ol-val¿yat). After the (›largerø) occultation of the twelfth Imam (in 941), Imamic authority came to be represented by Jurists. From the sixteenth century onward, their powers increased through high positions in the Safavid state and in the eighteenth century, when their state ties were cut, they attained vir-tual independence. Since then, Khomeyniøs vel¿yat-e faqh doctrine has identified the Jurists with the Qur<¿nic category of ›those who ruleø (ulu<l-amr), Juristic authority attaining an activist political meaning. For Shi>ite Sufis, vel¿yat similarly refers to Imamic authority, but also to their spiritual leaders, to mystical states, or ›sainthoodø. Sufismøs enemies often stress the incompatibility of the two definitions, in refer-ence to harsh criticism of Sufis by the sixth, eighth and other Imams.4 Nevertheless, Shi>ite Sufis have often considered their historical leaders as representatives of the Imam on earth, or the Supreme (Sufi) Pole (qoÃb ol-aqt¿b) and the Hidden Imam to be one and the same person. An esoterical reading of the Imamate in which Shi>ite Sufis share, considers the ›cycle of guidanceø in terms of a spiritual ›intitiationø (bey>at) and as ›friendship with Godø (val¿yat). This doctrine holds Imam >Al to be the ›Friend of Godø (val-All¿h), who has been chosen by God as his friend and, through this divine friendship, to be the patron of the community of believers. The eleven Imams who came after >Al were considered Friends of God as well, but Sunni as well as Shi>ite Sufis have also used this designation to refer, instead or in addition, to themselves. Some daring, Shi>ite Sufis have considered themselves to be depositories of the Real/Truth (úaqqat) - that is contained in val¿yat -and thus to represent, during the occultation, the Imamic authority.5 4 There is a collection of forty Imamic akhb¿r in rejection of Sufis and Sufism, Al-arba> ́n úad¢¿n f radd a§-§ ́fya, kept in the library of ¿yatoll¿h ol->oˆm¿ Mar>ash Najaf (title reference no. 4578) (9ê ̇LEî>ALê ̇HK/Az k ́-ye § ́fiy¿n t¿ úoß ́r-e >¿ref¿n, 1375/1996: 82). 5 For an authoritative discussion of val¿yat, fithe most important article of Sh> faith‹ (FARSAKH, 1969: 132) see CORBIN (1971/1972).

Ne>matoll¿hs and îeydars were assigned to separate wards in Iranian cities. In Tabriz, the inner-Sufism strife led to annual fights and killings. In Shiraz, these conflicts continued until the middle of the nineteenth century (cf. LAMBTON, 1954: 16; MIRJAFARI, 1979; and PERRY, 1999). 12 When Sufis ran into conflict, their antagonists were most often either Rulers (úokmr¿n¿n, sal¿Ãn), or Jurists (a rubric I freely employ to designate ›religious schol-arsø (>olam¿) in general, and more specifically ›those whose field is jurisprudenceø (foqah¿<), and theologians (mutakallim ́n). These socio-political categories are repro-duced in other Islamic dichotomies such as ›the turbanø and ›the crownø (ARJOMAND, 1988), or dn va dowlat (religion and state). The importance of conflicts with Jurists party derived from the fact that fias a class‹ they were, from the beginning of and throughout Islamic history, fiintimately bound up with the state‹ (RAHMAN, 1966: 151). MEIER played down the importance of Rulers (fiDie anstösse zum vorgehen gegen einzelne kamen aber nur in seltenen fällen vom fürsten selbst. Den anlass bildeten meist auseinandersetzungen auf einer niedrigeren ebene, zwischen § ́fiyya und § ́fiyya, zwischen theologen oder juristen oder juristen und § ́fiyya‹), but then listed various cases in which state functionaries (admittedly not ›fürstenø in the strict sense) were responsible for Sufi repression (1976, (2): 319-20). Jurists often provided Rulers with arguments for fighting Sufis, and as a basis for more specific charges, three legal cate-gories were generally available for framing these arguments: heresy/polytheism (sherk), infidelity/blasphemy (kofr), and illegitimate innovation (bed>at). From the life-histories of Sufi martyrs, it appears that such doctrine was often subject to political usage. Com-mentaries indicate that beyond doctrinal concerns, accusations levelled against îall¿j (d.922) were related to groups that fought the Abbasid caliphate. The main charge, zandaqah, has been described as a ficatch-all term for heresy deemed dangerous by the state‹ (ERNST, 1985: 99, cf. MASSIGNON, 1975: 425). Charges against >Ayn al-Quß¿t (d.1131), claims to prophethood and kingship, point to similar motives for persecution. 13 If one would incorporate the above three critiques of Weber into a refined typolo-gy of conflict, then actual options amount to 13. As typology generally seeks lowest common denominators, it would depict only forms of conflict, to the neglect of causes. It would generate a three-tiered universe of Sufis, Rulers, and Jurists that divides into Sufi and non-Sufi sub-types and dissolves Sufism into antinomians and non-antinomi-ans. These parties obtain for conflict: 1) Sufi Ruler, 2) non-Sufi Ruler, 3) Sufi Jurist, 4) non-Sufi Jurist, 5) Sufi Ruler-Jurist, and 6) non-Sufi Ruler-Jurist. If the conflicts of antinomians (6) are distinguished from those of non-antinomians (6), and if conflict between Sufis and their antinomians (1) is included, then actual options amount to 13."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"49 TRILATERAL FIGURATIONS of pupils. As their mystic teachings spread over the Islamic world, schools, lodges and orders came into being. However, as early as the ninth century, Sufism was involved in political-military activity.14 Throughout Islamic history, alongside expanding military frontiers, Sufis have assisted in missionary conversion. From the tenth century, Sufi lodges had come into existence all over the Islamic world, and in the eleventh century, the Seljuqs used Sufi institutions to protect the state against their enemies.15 Beyond the mere faithful assistence to rulers, Sufi attempts at state foundation have been recorded from the twelfth century.16 In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Sufi orders emerged rapidly, which coincided with the usage of Sufis by the caliph during the restoration of the Abbasid caliphate. The socio-political im-portance of Sufism was reflected in the deification of Sufi sheikhs from the thirteenth century, as from then fithey, in place of the scholar-jurists, became the most respected leaders of the population,‹ while engaging in intimate relations with Islamic state regimes.17 From the fourteenth century, (Sufi) mystics were labeled ›kingø (sh¿h).18 In the late four-teenth and fifteenth centuries, most importantly, Turkish and Iranian Sufis fibacked the rise of the Ottoman and Safavid dynasties.‹19 Since the end of the Middle Ages, Iranian Sufism has developed in a separate direction because of the specific character of the Shi>ite state in Iran.20 14 MEIER, 1976, (1): 125; (2): 300, cf.

The subsequent repression and the virtual disappearance of Sufism in seventeenth century Iran was caused by an historical inversion: a political and religious coalition of Rulers and Jurists. After the Safavidsø final defeat by the Afghan Afshar tribe in the eighteenth century (1722), many Jurists retreated to Iraqi centres where they would be virtually autonomous. In the nineteenth century, the new Qajar state extended royal patronage to Sufism, partially in an attempt to curb the Juristsø growing powers.

The High Atlas region had ›traditional institutionsø that until the 1950s had fisurvived untouched [...] in a kind of sociological ice-box‹ (cited in EICKELMAN, 1981: 137). Gellner made explicit his many suggestions of inherent relations between Sufism and tradition in Muslim Society (1981): fiSufism is a kind of Reformation-in-reverse. It creates a quasi-church [....] So much for traditional society‹ (op. cit., p. 104, cf. 132-3). 33 GEERTZ, in an otherwise very subtle comparison of Morocco and Indonesia (1968), constructed a dichotomy of religious development in both countries, the com-ponent parts of which were ›classicalø and ›scripturalistø religious styles (op. cit., pp. 19-22). The historical process that linked the two was modernisation (variably described as ›modernismø, op. cit., p. 20; ›the industrial revolutionø or ›Western intrusion and domina-tionø, op. cit., pp. 56-7, etc.). It would be fair then, despite Geertzøs dislike of these concepts, to conclude that the dichotomy mirrored traditional and modern society. The classical style in both (traditional) countries was ›mysticalø (op. cit., p. 24). Geertzøs typological depiction cannot be reduced to the particularities of two peripheral regions of the Islamic world, as the types were made to stand for the whole: fiSufism, as an his-torical reality, consists of a series of different and even contradictory experiments, most of them occurring between the ninth and nineteenth centuries‹ (op. cit., p. 48).

EVANS-PRITCHARDøs historical study of the Libyan San ́sya (1949) described the expansion of the order throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and its successful rally for support of tribal populations of Cyrenaica in the liberation struggle against Italian occupation. 36 GELLNER (1981: 159-60), for instance, conceived of relations between the ›asso-ciationist idealø (including mediation, propitiation, ritual and devotional excess) and ›scripturalistø (puritanical, unitarian, individualist) Islam as a pendulum that got ›un-hingedø through reformism (with mystic religiosity as the victim). I distinguish between ›jurist-ledø and ›juristicø because it was often lay Muslims who carried the reform. 37 In contrasting the previous period with eighteenth century reformism, HODGSON claimed that fisince Ibn Taymiyyah (d.1328), there had been few figures, even among the Hanbals, to stand out with great intensity against the casting of all religious life into the mould of S ́f tarqahs.

He promoted the cleansing of Islam of what he saw to be its alien, impure and otherwise undesirable elements, includ-ing Shi>ism and Sufism. Sufism, which for him represented a prime example of poly-theism, especially stood out as an object of his hatred. 38 The above descriptions do not apply to a new generation of anthropological Sufi studies (such as EWING, 1990; GROSS, 1990; and MIR-HOSSEINI, 1994), in which questions of modernity and traditionality have made way for contemporary theoretical concerns such as the relations between (collective) representation, power, and history, and in which Sufism is not usually dealt with in long-term, diachronical perspectives."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"54 CHAPTER TWO the modern era,39 while nineteenth century Ne>matoll¿h Sufis were among the carriers of modernity in Iran.40 Systematic Sufi persecutions, in the seventeenth century, had preceded their ascent.

The relations between Sufis, rulers and jurists thus derived not from jurist modernity or Sufi traditionality but from the absence of centralised rule.

The Sufisø power, it may be hypothesised, was an important motive for the Qajars to seek proximity to them,69 and for the hatred of the Zands. When in Kerman in 1792, the Qajar ally Mosht¿q>alsh¿h entered a mosque to pray. The prayer leader, who was on the side of the Zands, called upon the crowd to stone him.70 He was declared an heretic and subsequently stoned outside the mosque.

Be-fore nowr ́z, dervishes from all over the country flocked into the cities, presented themselves at the houses of the wealthy, and expected to be taken in and to be taken care of financially. Few dared ignore them.84 More precisely, these contrasts reflect figurational changes in the tri-lateral relations of Sufis, jurists and rulers that occurred along the paths that the Sufis travelled. Their persecution and patronage in Shiraz, Isfa-han and Tehran (as well as in many other places) marked Sufismøs re-emergence as a socio-political force in Iran. It proved to be both an attraction, to local rulers who competed for state power, and a danger. Where rulers deemed Sufis dangerous, jurists, whose ambitions for power had greatly increased, enabled their persecution. The height of the juristsø persecutions in Kermanshah, and of Sufi power in Kerman, reflected the absence of a central state, and even of strong, independent rulers in these localities. The context for renewed ruler-jurist co-operation in anti-Sufi purges, finally, was Fatú>alsh¿høs territorial re-unification, which had no use for a politically assertive Sufism. 2.

The potency of Sufi imagery - extroverted and aggressive - had been a reflection of the open field, the absence of terms of enga-gement, in the relations of Sufis, rulers and jurists.88 Through territorial reintegration and rulers who conceived of jurists as obstacles to their reign, Sufis now attained positions in court society. Mass adherence had turned Sufism into a popular religiosity, but court society made it salon-fähig. New Sufi religiosity was reflected in a moderated imagery, and in the fact that each of the orderøs qoÃbs would now also be a mollah.89 Under Fatú>alsh¿høs grandson Moúammad Sh¿h (1834-1848), Ne>-matoll¿h Sufis were still found in the court, firecruiting members from among prominent government officials and royalty.‹90 Moúammad Sh¿h had been initiated into the Ne>matoll¿h order in his youth,91 and remained anti-clerical ever since.92 fiSufis were given posts at court and entrusted with government missions: Mrz¿ Mihd Kh ́<, a murshid (spiritual guide) of the Ni>matoll¿h order, was chief scribe to the Shah‹, and the last leader of the semi-unified Ne>matoll¿h order, before present-day divisions -9Raúmat>alsh¿hK (d.1861) - was appointed vice-pany of Sufis and vagabonds, as well as the qoÃb Maj` ́b>alsh¿h, were punished by the Shah, in 1821 (BUSSE/F¿rs-n¿me-ye N¿§er, 1972: 161-63). 87 Moreover, the Ne>matoll¿h pole 9Kow¢ar>alsh¿hK had taken refuge with >Abb¿s Mrz¿ fifrom the persecutions of the ulama‹ (ALGAR, 1969: 105). 88 In his sociology of game-types, ELIAS (1970: 75-109) outlined a simple model in which two parties compete for a scarce good in the absence of norms for engagement. More complex models concerned relations between unequal players, more than two (groups of) players, and players at different levels. None of the present cases suffi-ciently resembles the models for technical analysis, but enough to illustrate main mechanisms. In the first, simple figuration, there was unregulated competition for spiritual authority, with explicit Sufi power claims. State centralisation in the second, complex figuration (Eliasø model 3a), made for a moderated Sufism in the royal court. 89 POURJAVADY and WILSON (1978: 139, 142).

The internal dynamism among Sufis that enabled their ascent consisted of a massive growth in the number of their converts, which could not be checked by either rulers or jurists. The Sufisø relations vis-à-vis state and societal (juristsø) regimes - the two other relational dimensions of mystic re-gimes - have been grasped in the notion of ›trilateral figurationsø. I began arguing the relevance of trilateral figurations by addressing Corbinøs quaternary view of Shi>ism - underlying which were neglected histories of conflict about spiritual authority that are constitutive of Sufism. In Weberian ideal-types, Islamic histories were conceptualised in a dichotomy of law and experience. Their use as a tool of social analysis is limited, however, because of a pattern of overlap between Sufis and jurists, antinomian traditions that dissolve Sufism as a unitary object, and the centrality of the state in shaping Sufi-jurist relations. The centrality of the state remains similarly unaccounted for in the his-torical anthropology of Islam, which complemented the law-and-experience dichotomy with an equally Weberian duality of modernity and tradition. Beyond the grid of these notions, Iranian Sufismøs social development has taken shape through the contingent factors of state centralisation and royal patronage. In the first, eighteenth century figuration, the relations of Sufis de-rived mainly from local rulersø competition for power in the absence of a central state. Both Sufis and jurists at times achieved autonomous local influence. Their power of popular mobilisation brought rulers to seek proximity to Sufis, and to persecute them where they were seen to threaten the state. Rulers often feared jurists in the second figuration, which had the reunified state at its centre. Their Sufi patronage, in turn, enhanced continuous Sufi challenges of jurist authority. Nineteenth century Iran did not, therefore, see the disappearance of ›traditionalø Sufis through the ascent of jurist-led, ›modernø religiosity, but, instead, Sufismøs socio-political renaissance. It was through another period of socio-political disorder and restora-tion in the early twentieth century, that new mystic regimes would again emerge. Royalty lost its autonomy as a worldly and spiritual centre in Iran. From then, Ne>matoll¿h Sufis came to identify more strongly with the imagined community of the Iranian nation."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"PART TWOIn the Pahlavi Dynasty "},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE NEW MYSTIC REGIMES, 1900-1941 The early twentieth century marks the redefinition of Sufism as a social institution in Iran. The context for this transformation was the genesis of the Iranian nation-state. Two political processes were involved: the Iranian nation first emerged as a powerful concept in the Constitutional Revolution (1905-1911), and Reza Khan/Shah Pah-lavi subsequently moulded it to fit his statist ambitions (1921-1941).1 The early Pahlavi state regained control over the national territory and in the process expanded further into society than the Qajar rulers had been able to. Legitimate social power in the early Pahlavi era came to be defined once more, but this time more effectively, in terms of oneøs state-affiliation. Militant policies of nationalistic mod-ernisation,2 which were initiated by the Shah, produced the nation-state as a new, virtually uncontested, cultural frame of reference. Nationalistic modernisation has come to be associated with the repression of Sufism, as a component of anti-religious policy: fiUn-der Reza Shah there was a concerted drive against religion by the government [and] dervishes were driven from the city streets.‹3 He had sought to repress begging - the pacific antithesis of militant modernity - and this explained, according to a contemporary Sufi, the persecution of the Kh¿ks¿r order.4 An intimate from the royal 1 Useful Persian sources regarding Sufism in the Pahlavi era, at least those readily available in public archives, are unfortunately rather scarce (cf. FARMAYAN (1974) for general observations on modern Iranian sources). The tendency nowadays of archives to open up collections to researchers, more so than under the Shah (cf., for example, EILERSø account (1977: 322) of the Pahlavi Library), suggests that more relevant material will become available in the near future. 2 fiThe shahøs power was [among other bases] founded on the increasing wealth of the royal house, much of it accumulated [...] through force [....] As a result [...] the strengthening of the state could be tied to nationalism, as had been impossible under the Qajars‹ (MCDANIEL, 1991: 27). 3 FRYE, 1957: 188, cf.

A political scientist in the Islamic Republic observed that the finew regime [of Reza Shah] tried to im-plement an ideology of royal chauvinism [...] with the help of people like Ardashr Rp ́rtar and [...] his son Sh¿p ́r, the Freemasons.‹6 A similarly ›deviatingø school of thought was fiSufi mysticism, which was revived and propagated through several westernised and Free-mason intellectuals, and it even made its way into schoolbooks.‹7 Reza Shah is reported to have been closely associated with the Sufi member of parliament Sheikh ol-Molk Owrang.8 Owrang is the courtier source for the Shahøs above-mentioned criticism of Sufism as well, but it must be noted that this critique explicitly concerned certain dervishes, certain dervish practices and the anti-modernism that they represented - not Sufi mysticism as a whole. The Shahøs measures and goals of cultural reform were specifically aimed at: [...] forbidding jugglery and deceitfulness [:] Qalandars with dervish names but far removed from the meaning of Dervishhood exhibited their jugglery on squares and crossroads, and with singing poetry they would gather people around them.

This argument would make perfect sense for most of Qajar Iran as well, as widespread notions of kingship in this era were very much akin to conceptions of Sufi authority and its embodiment in Sufi masters.13 However, the sainthood model of master and disciple did not pro-vide for equivalents when autocratic power relations were challenged in the name of the nation, during the Constitutional Revolution. Un-der Reza Shah, the legitimacy of monarchy was not constructed 9 êAF ̇, 1356/1977-8: 112. 10 fiOne of the Sufis from India named 9Shast Mehr B¿b¿K related the coming to power of Reza Shah in Iran to himself and said it was because of his drive and will-power that he had become Shah‹ (R ̇N, 1371/1992-3: 18), cf.

This policy, in turn, established the context for new (Sufi) mas-ter-disciple relations in which legitimacy attained an abstract and external measure in the Iranian nation. Sufi ideology would increas-ingly argue its relevance vis-à-vis the Iranian nation, and it did not vest all authority in the person of the Sufi master anymore. Mystic religiosity, that is, transformed in the context of the nation-state.15 EXPERIMENTS AND REFUTATIONS The Ne>matoll¿h path had disintegrated in the late Qajar era, and the experience of constitutionalism was therefore varied in the different branches. Various Ne>matoll¿h masters had been politically active and influential in the Qajar period - often through royal patronage -but this exterior power was largely lost under Reza Shahøs regime, as intimate Sufi ties to the state were cut. Although explicit Sufi con-tributions to the nation-state were few, many were the changes in the Ne>matoll¿h paths that had the new political regimes as a context. The êaf>alsh¿h order experimented with and further developed its Freemasonry profile. Its main branch bureaucratised to the extent that the formerly unitary, exclusive and charismatic spiritual author-ity evolved into the leadership of a ›first among equalsø who was selected through a restricted election. Analogies for these develop-ments lay in the creation of an effective state bureaucracy,16 and the Shi>ite clerical reforms of ayatollah Sangelaj (see below). The 14 AHMADI and AHMADI (1998: 159-60) downplayed this development, but their formulations suggest it was crucial: fiThe idea of the divinity of the king [...] had lost much of its influence [...] The political and military shortcomings of the kings, who had brought bankruptcy and poverty upon the country and hindered its socio-economic development, can be considered as contributory factors in the weakening of the idea of the divinity of the king.‹ 15 I have left out discussions of Enlightenment and neo-Sufism here. Neo-Sufism was probably coined by Fazlur Rahman in 1966 (SIRRIYEH, 1998: 11), technically referring to eighteenth- (and nineteenth-) century reform movements (mainly in North Africa) that propagated a lessening of ecstatic practices and more conformity to holy law. The two concepts have been hotly debated by RADTKE (1992, 1994, 1996) and SCHULTZE (1990, 1996), cf. PETERS (1990). The debate mainly involves doctrinal changes until the twentieth century, while I focus on modern, mainly twentieth-century social (master-disciple and Sufi-nation) relations. 16 fiReza Shah was able to accomplish what had proved impossible for the Qajars, the creation of a relatively powerful state [with] an effective bureaucracy‹ (MCDAN-IEL, 1991: 27)."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"77 NEW MYSTIC REGIMES breach of tradition was refuted by a seceding sheikh who himself, nevertheless, headed a modernist magazine that specifically targeted the Iranian nation, rather than fellow Sufis or the community of be-lievers, as an audience.

From the beginning, Freemasonry embodied the political and mystical ideals in the Society of Brotherhood.122 There were histori-cal and structural reasons for this. Reform-minded individuals in the Qajar court who found intellectual inspiration in its Western and elite ideals and sufficient protection in its secrecy carried Freemasonry in Iran.123 As the Iranian nation in the Constitutional Revolution and the nation-state under Reza Shah became markers of legitimate identity, the Society of Brotherhood could open up, in the sense of becoming more public. It did not ever, however, come close to being a democ-ratic organisation. In sudden awareness, one êaf>alsh¿h sheikh expressed amazement to me of his having been in the order for nearly forty years without knowing very precisely who had been the board members in the Society of Brotherhood. The Society of Broth-erhood remained public and nation-oriented externally, but secretive and hierarchical like Freemasonry, internally. Iranian Freemasonry had come about from exile contacts with European representatives of the mother branches in Europe: the 118 AFSH ̇R, 1367/1988: 36. 119 CHAH ̇RDAH, 1361/1982-3: 164; 1360/1981-2: 61. 120 ‘êAF ̇<, 1344/1965-6: 10. 121 ‘êAF ̇<, 1344/1965-6: 39. 122 See CHAH ̇RDAH, 1360/1981-2: 58, cf.

It is conveniently stressed, in and outside Iran, that Freemasonry spread with the British Empire. However, the first Iranian Freemasons were expatriates, in Europe (cf. KATR ̇<, 1355/1976-7), who brought back Freemasonry with them as an état importé (cf. BADIE, 1992).

In adherence to both üahr od-Dowle and êaf>alsh¿h, the contributions to them explored current, worldly affairs and in many cases related them to patriotic or nationalist themes. Retaining his claim to tradi-tional spiritual authority in terms of Sufi organisation, î¿jj D¿d¿sh represented a modernist Sufism ideologically. The Magazine of Brotherhood was modern because it was deci-sively this-worldly. It discussed ›progressiveø themes, such as the meaning of the Wahhabi reform in Islam (1307/1928, 10-1: 29-32), in its section on The Islamic World of Today. There was no mention of the Wahhabitesø hatred of both Sufism and Shi>ism, and the author (ê. Vaúdat, the name written according to the Western convention) instead estimated that they marked the beginning of ›the grand awak-ening of Muslimsø (p. 32). The Magazine contained sections not only on the world of Islam and Iranian society, but also - uniquely, inter-spersing traditional poetry, treatises on Love and Truth and moral exhortations - a contribution on economy (1307/1928, 8: 6). One example of straight-out patriotism had ›What is more effec-tive for the arousal of feelings: poetry or music?ø (1307/1928-9, 10-1: 9-13) as a title. The author pondered the mobilising effect of the French Marseillaise but concluded that poetry would be more effec-tive in Iran, on condition that it would be unified with music (p. 13). Patriotism blended with progressive themes, especially in discus-sions on and by women. ›Patriotism is the first duty for womenø, one article held (1307/1928, 3: 20), rather than, for instance, the more In Tehran, the Society of Brotherhood had a magazine named Majm ́>e-ye akhlaq, in Kermanshah it had (besides Majalle-ye okhovvat) a newspaper named K ́bak-e gharb (which, according to CHAH ̇RDAH, 1360/1981-2: 54, was pub-lished by î¿jj D¿d¿sh as well) and in Shiraz it had a newspaper named Okhovvat (îOSEYN, 1377/1998: 31-3).

Eight years before Reza Shah ordered the unveiling of women, Badr ol-Mol ́k Mostowfz¿de expressed her opinion on ›the veil and chastityø (1307/1928, 4: 15-8). Through formal reasoning, she estab-lished there were no moral barriers for women to lay off the veil. Then she asked: When and Where?, to which she responded: not, certainly, now in Iran. For moral corruption prevailed, and in order for the veil to be removed, first men and women needed to be edu-cated. Women needed to understand betrayal of their husbands as of the gravest sins to holy law. Men should become aware that mal-treatment of their compatriot sisters was a sin legally and socially. For women, freedom from the veil would now be traded against the freedom which was provided for them in honour and chastity. fiIt is strange‹, Mostowfz¿de concluded, fithat most of our intellectuals ask why women in civilised countries do not have veils.

Their being chosen through restricted elec-tion by the Consultancy Council (that was not accountable or respon-sive to the Sufis it led) was sufficient. The Society of Brotherhood that throughout its existence maintained it headed a Sufi organisa-tion, had as its leaders people who did not fipretend to ›disclosure and visionø (kashf-o-shoh ́d), and neither, like the other sheikhs of the path, to supernatural things [...].‹147 * * * The êaf>alsh¿h order travelled two distinct, modern paths. On the one hand, the Society of Brotherhood modernised organisationally, through Freemasonry. Its nationally powerful elite did not confront the Shahøs autocracy, and its modernism evolved from self-proclaimed democratic reform-mindedness to political silence. As Freemasonry internationally, its elite leadership structure did not prevent appeals going out to ›the high and the lowø - the Iranian nation at large. The Society heralded progress through the elective principle, while causing an unbridgeable gap: for Sufis, the Consul-tancy Council leaders had become unapproachable men in high places. Their doing away with the traditional authority structure matched the reformist ideologies of Sangelaj in Shi>ism and Qazvn in Sufism, both of which - similarly - had the particular modernity of Reza Shahøs Iran as a context. By effectively abolishing gene-names they could not, however, come up with. These sheikhs would have ex-changed blows with the ›authenticø Sufis (there was even mention of ›warø). What these êaf>alsh¿hs most probably referred to, is an episode in which >Abb¿s ̇f, at first a pupil of 9Vaf¿>alsh¿hK, went over to the Society in conflict (fithey bribed him‹), and was there appointed Master of Ceremonies. CHAH ̇RDAH (1361/1982-3: 154, 162) mentioned Prince Khosrov¿n as an ›elected sheikhø of the Society, but he did not provide historical details.

His Maga-zine of Brotherhood is not easily interpreted as an ›ideological state institutionø - a label which in certain respects fit the Society of Brotherhood. While the kingøs blend of nationalistic modernisation involved the violent imposition of a unitary identity, the Magazine rather offered discussions of it. Contrary to the vertical chain of command in the Society, finally, Majalle-ye okhovvat hosted a wide range of authors, male and female, with widely differing views. Beyond individual differences, however, Ne>matoll¿h Sufism in Tehran and Kermanshah bore witness to a common social transfor-mation. The new mystic regimes of î¿jj D¿d¿sh and Bnesh>alsh¿h did not classify as Messianic ›Religions of the Oppressedø (LANTER-NARI, 1965), which do not emerge automatically where West-inspired modernisation confronts indigenous religiosity.

Sufism transformed with the new re-gimes, as the nation(-state) became a prime marker of legitimate identity. But rather than silent victims of state oppression, the Ne>matoll¿hs seized opportunities and developed ›authenticø modern voices. While nationalistic modernisation involved the imposition of a unitary identity for the nation, î¿jj D¿d¿shøs magazine rather of-fered pluralistic discussion of it. A second aspect of the transforma-tion, was the emergence of new master-disciple relations. The Ne>matoll¿hs faced new cohesion problems in contestations of tradi-tional spiritual authority, which mirrored Sangelajøs modernist struggle in Shi>ism. The transformation of Iranian Sufism occurred on all three relational levels of mystic regimes. Internally, nationalism, nationalistic modernisation and the dis-mantling of traditional power bases that occurred in their name, were paralleled by Sufi struggles for spiritual authority. Sufi masters and disciples took issue with self-explanatory, charismatic rule. What motivated them was never democracy, but rational - that is: reasoned - rule. What they asked for, if often implicitly, was relevance to the nation-state. Qazvn dismissed traditional Sufi authority as nation-ally dysfunctional. It was Bnesh>alsh¿høs elective assembly, how-ever, - one bridge too far to match the taste of Qazvn - that acted and uncompromisingly abolished traditional spiritual authority. Externally, nationalism and nationalistic modernisation provided contexts for both lateral relations to other religious regimes and ver-tical relations to the state. The Society of Brotherhood publicly propagated a national religiosity and its elite members, such as Bnesh>alsh¿h and Enteˆ¿m, were personally involved in the nationøs construction by the state. They did so, respectively, through working for the nation-stateøs establishment at home and by representing it abroad. In the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order, N ́r>alsh¿h appealed to the na-tion in a bit for support of his leadership claim. The genesis of ê¿leúøs Advice lay in the perception of state concerns for Sufi order-liness.

Even physical proximity to royalty counted, in the autocratic late Pahlavi environment, as one of its signs. Both types of patronage were enabled primarily through the royaltyøs recruitment of a network from among elite networks.3 Its se-cond defining characteristic was the extension of relations to the lowest nodes in the status hierarchy - from the ›shadow of God on earthø to proverbial vagabonds,4 and lastly, royal patronage extended to Sufism. A closer look at Sufismøs ideological incorporation could modify a dominant and rather flat image of the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah -as one of inherently militant religiosity, trampled by a despotically secular monarch.5 The process through which Shi>ism in the end be-came predominantly militant, involved nearly four decades of cultural battle for political and religious authority, between societal and state actors, with certain versions of Sufism as royal weapons. Sufism in the period 1941-1979 would thus remain as enigmatic, without the political context of royal patronage, as Opus Dei without its flawless embedding in Francoøs ›nationally catholic Spainø.6 1 Taút-e tavajjoh¿t-e >¿liya-ye >oly¿ úaßrat-e sh¿hb¿n ́ Faraú Pahlav. 2 Cf. studies on the ›circleø (dowre or úalqe) such as BILL (1973) and ZONIS (1971). 3 Cf.

BRADBURD stressed that the extensive networks of royal patronage as-sumed a pyramidal shape (1983: 30). 5 The vision is partly seen in ALGAR (1972), who claimed Shi>ism was essentially rebellious.

Secondly, the êaf>alsh¿h orderøs social prominence is related to royal patronage. Lastly, the emergence of re-ligious opposition in the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order is discussed in relation to its effective balancing act between royal and clerical loyalties. * * * The mutual attractions and interrelations of royalty and mysticism con-stitute a recurrent motif in Iranian monarchical and Ne>matoll¿h his-tory.7 Sh¿h Ne>matoll¿h proposed worldly rulers to function as military transmitters of Sufi Truth; N ́r>alsh¿h warned rulers that the neglect of Sufismøs superiority would be to their own peril; Karm Kh¿n Zand died six month after he expelled the Ne>matoll¿h Sufis from Shiraz, Moúammad Sh¿h was initiated by and surrounded himself with Ne>ma-toll¿hs; and Reza Shahøs ascent to power had several Sufi claimants. The theory of religious regimes postulates an immanent developmen-tal logic, in which the growth of religious regimes increases organisa-tional complexity, making them more like, and possibly transforming them into, states. States rather than religious regimes, however, have in the long run monopolised the means of taxation and violence. It has been argued in chapter two that Ne>matoll¿h development proceeded through trilateral figurations, in which the exterior measure of state cen-tralisation was crucial. Where state power was weak, as in the transition to Qajar rule, the Ne>matoll¿h regime assumed state-like properties in its conceptions of self as a parallel power. The Pahlavi restoration could not tolerate such parallel power, whether it existed in tribes, autonomy-aspiring regions, or in Sufism. Reza Shah relied on repression and co-optation, respectively, towards Kh¿ks¿r and SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h Sufis. When Mohammad Reza Shah inherited his fatherøs state in 1941, most centrifugal threats had been subdued. The positive relations that would from 1941 onwards develop between monarchy and mysticism, therefore, compare in some ways to Sufismøs nineteenth century absorp-tion into Qajar court society. Dynastic rule firmly established, Sufism had lost its potential state-like properties, providing useful counter-weight to religiously and politically assertive jurists.

However, there were also concerns more intrinsically religious than the desire to divide-and-rule, for the royal usage of Sufism. Beyond the promise of personal salvation, Sufism offered a doctrine of empowerment. Herein probably lies an important reason why it was Sufis rather than, for instance, monarchy-minded jurists, to whom ro-yals were particularly drawn. There was no provision in Shi>ism for a caliph, let alone a king, but the idea of divine power vested in the physi-cal person of a leader was what defined Shi>ite Sufism - as it did the for-mer state religion of Zoroastrism, the main pillar of royal legitimisation. It was a universal longing that must have played in the royal attrac-tion to Sufism: the need for blessing by those who possess ›higher knowledgeø, for a mystical sanction of ambiguous, worldly power. Power had to be relocated from the profanity of human interventions - the throne had come through the British - to be reunified with the (su-per)natural order of things. The kind of longing, that is, which brought together Katharina and Rasputin, and made credible the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h sheikh who predicted the unlikely reign of Reza Shah in the eyes of the king. In Frazerian analysis, these mystical sanctions make the king into fia being apart [...] who articulates the natural and cultural orders [and] this ritual function is the foundation of the political function of roy-alty.‹8 Sufism, then, represented potential for royaltyøs empowerment. The recognition of power was mutual, in Sufismøs late twentieth cen-tury royal relations. Asked about the nature of Sufi ties to the Pahlavi dynasty, a Sufi riddled that fithe king remains [always] as the sea.‹9 In addition to being a source of material rewards, that is, the sovereign represented sacrosanct - holy and dangerous - power in person. An es-say addressing Sufi influences in Iranian culture stated that: [One] manifestation of the other self (man-e dgar) (in the station of con-trolling the lower self) consists of the relation between the ruler and the ruled. Politics and the legal machinery are areas in which the particulars of this kind of relations become clearer.

It was founded in 195831 and soon began to play a major role in Iranøs economic, social and cultural life. The Prime Minister, Minister of the Court, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of Parliament were on its board.32 Moreover, most of the major institutions in Iran were in some way linked to it. A cultural office not directly linked to the Foundation, but nevertheless operating under a state sanction, was the Bony¿d-e Mowlav, founded with royal permis-sion in 1974.33 fiIt was headed by Professor Zabihollah Safa, historian of Persian literature [and] devoted to research and propagation of the works of [...] Rumi [and] the books influenced by his School of Der-vishes.‹34 The Bony¿d-e Mowlav may in addition be described as an ›ideological state institutionø35 because fi[Rumiøs] Sufism became the guiding philosophy of Iran, permeating many aspects of its culture [and to] judge by his own writings, especially Mission for My Country, [the] Shah could be considered one of its followers.‹36 31 Cf. PAHLAVI, 1979: 152. EILERS (1977: 323) mentioned 1961 as the founding year, but this was the year in which the Foundation, fiperhaps the most distinctive court institution‹ (MCDANIEL, 1991: 67), was given an administrative structure. The Founda-tion was founded in 1958. 32 EILERS, 1977: 322. The Foundationøs pervasiveness is suggested in the following citation: fiThat patrimonialism in government breeds corruption was particularly evi-dent in Iran [....] Pensions were synonymous with handouts or rewards for favours or fringe benefits to those faithful to the regime. The Pahlavi Foundationøs interests in [...] banks [...] and other industrial and commercial enterprises evidenced the extent to which the Shah and his immediate family were involved in the economic affairs of the country‹ (BEHNAM, 1986: 169). 33 Royal permission was the prerequisite for any major social organisation in Iran. 34 EILERS, 1977: 323, cf. the Shahøs Mission for my Country, 1960: 20 and Réponse à l'Histoire, 1979: 20, 127.

Among the Ahl-e îaqq, a subsect of urban and educated af-filiates came into being from the 1960s (MIR-HO SSEI NI, 1994, (2): 212). From 1974, when he succeeded his father, Bahram El¿h attempted to give the order ›a more univer-sal appealø and attracted new converts who included foreigners (op. cit., p. 215). How-ever, it is not suggested here that Sufism in the late Pahlavi era was but an elite phe-nomenon. Underlying elite affiliation was ›general mystical religiosityø, which is seen through a remark by DURING: fiCøest que de løavis de tous les soufis [...] Nûr >Alî Shâh était un très grand Maître [....] De nos jours il représente encore, dans la mythologie populaire, le prototype du saint extatique mort en martyr‹ [my italics] (1976: 123). 39 JAM ̇LZ ̇DE, 1352/1973: 13. 40 SLUGLETT, 1989: 116, in a review of FISCHER (1980). 41 fiIn the 60s [...] ties between clergy and monarchy were broken‹ (VIEILLE, 1981: 3).

As they have conceived of Sufism as an integrally Islamic movement, ›Islamic sanctionø constructs an opposition that is not justified by indigenous views.44 Besides institutional absorption, the state incorporation of mysticism materialised in a more personal aspect as well. A claimant to the posi-tion of Shams ol->Oraf¿< ›axisø, î¿jj Mr Sayyed >Al Qom Borqe>, was a reputed jurist.

SAVAKøs demolition of Khomeyniøs reputation in 1963, however, portrayed him as a person who, except for being a homo-sexual, a spy and a foreigner, fihad written erotic Sufi poetry‹ (CHEHABI, 1990: 235). Besides the obvious damage that ›erotic poetryø would do to oneøs ascetic reputation in Iran, the charge hardly makes any sense, except when one interprets it as a state attempt to divide the jurists through associating one of them with Sufism, i.e. by playing on the opposition between Sufis and jurists. Iran Almanac 1975 contains a reprint of a news-paper report on the (mainly Q¿der and Naqshband) dervishes of Sanandaj, Kurdistan. 44 Iran Almanac 1969: 516. In its summary of Iranian history, the same report omits mentioning the crucial fact, which is not normally lost on anyone, that Sh¿h Isma>l, who declared Shi>ism the state religion in 1501, had been the leader of a Sufi order (op. cit., p. 48). There is a striking similarity between this definition of Sufism from the Pahlavi era and (post-)revolutionary redefinitions. A contemporary anti-Sufi manifesto (9ê¿leú>alsh¿hK, 1375/1996) reads: fiThey gave Sufism an Islamic freshness‹ (be ta§avvof ¿b va rang-e esl¿m d¿dand) (op. cit., p. 46). 45 fi>Al Borqe> was an em¿m-e jam¿>at and he published several books, one of which was forbidden by the Sources of Emulation (mar¿je>-e taqld).

KHVAJA OD-DN, 1360/1981: 19). A comparable and common technique of legitimisation is seen in the four pictures of the Shah, with full honorary reference, on a visit to Na<in that are included in BAL ̇GH, 1369Q/1949 (op. cit., pp. 15, 17), who was a Shams ol->Oraf¿<-Ne>matoll¿h leader. 48 H ̇FEü OL-KOTOB, 1338/1959: 82. 15 Bahman corresponds to the 4th of February 1949, when the first attempt at the life of the Shah was made by a member of the Islamist movement Fed¿<iy¿n-e Esl¿m (active between at least 1945 and 1953) The Fed¿<iy¿n-e Esl¿m were even more opposed to secular politicians such as Mo§addeq.

The conflict over the lodgeøs ownership was concluded after 17 years, in the 1950s, with the help of the Freemason and ›impartial sheikhø Na§roll¿h Taqav. The settlement provided for the separation of the congregational part from the living quarters (the latter of which were allocated to the heirs of êaf>alsh¿h). Afterwards, êaføs heirs withdrew from the lodge: they retreated into their living quarters or went abroad. The lodge was now de jure in the hands of the Society of Brotherhood and remained so until 1979. With the coming to power of the Pahlavi polity in 1921, royal patron-age came to a temporary halt.

Upon superficial reading, one might take it as a laudation of the Society of Brotherhood. Although many of the Societyøs leaders came from a political background, Tav¿n-gar held, they had not used the Society for political purposes. In state service they had, motivated by Sufism, rendered valuable services to the country.73 Enteˆ¿m as-SalÃane had been morally outstanding like êaf¿ himself. Selfless Marzb¿n had dedicated his whole life to others. ̇qevl had fiseveral sensitive jobs, among which [...] the directorate of the Se-pah Bank, being a high-standing member of the Board of Directors of the Lion and the Red Sun, [being involved in] harbour development and other activities.‹ In all of these he had fino objective but service to the Shah and the fatherland,‹ and had fithe honour of reporting to the first person of the country.‹ In these days, one did not often come across a man who was so full of (both) fiShah worship and Sufi features.‹74 Abruptly changing subjects, Tav¿ngar then wrote: fiOur topic is pres-ently the real path of êaf¿/the rightful path of purity.‹ His purpose was not criticism, as it was an error (khaÃ¿) to have discussions on dervish-hood.

There was a tradi-tional, initial modesty to anything Enteˆ¿m was going to say on mysti-cism through his sheikh, and he stressed that complacency was to be avoided: fiOur understanding of the divine sphere/self (l¿h ́t) is limited to the perception of its traces, not its essence [....] We must know that even the thought of [it] is beyond us.

Rumours held it among the self-proclaimed tasks of the Society of Brotherhood to prepare from its midst a person for the premiership. In this context, one cannot help noticing - the extent to which this is telling will remain for historians to judge - the formal resemblance between the Consultancy Council and a national cabinet. When massive protest shook the foundations of power and the Shah complained of former friends who were hastily leaving the sinking ship in December 1978, the Shah turned to Enteˆ¿m for a solution. Despite a cloudy episode, the Shah had known Enteˆ¿m as a friend since 1936.92 A correspondence on the eve of the revolution has been retrieved that documents a plea on the part of the Grand Lodge of Iran. It pledges compliance with Khomeyni and the revolution, in reward for protection afterwards. It was the (Sufi) Freemasonsø royal patronage and deep ab-sorption into the institutions of Pahlavi power, however, as ›courtiers, personal adjutants, military generals, and economic and political confi-dantsø, which made for the offer to be immediately rejected.93 The SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order Contrary to the êaf>alsh¿hs, who evolved from the cradle of the Qajar monarchy and retained its protection, the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs had to do without significant patronage on the eve of their ascent.

Thirdly, no royal patronage is officially known to have been extended to the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order during the era of Mohammad Reza Shah, but as the order expanded enormously, many of its members held influential positions in Iranian society, members of the government visited its lodges, and there were several contacts between the royals and the Sufis.

The Perspective was published fiin the hope that [...] especially the learned Ulema [...] in whose field this work falls, will pardon and correct any errors they may discover, so that my readers may not be misled.‹135 The protests and the larger shift in the balance of religious power, then, in which Reß¿>alsh¿h could and did now officially share, are what most probably accounted for his change in tone, from neutral to traditional, and beyond that, militant.

Its representation by the late Pahlavi regime, however, became a ground for political contestation. Iranian Sufism in the period 1941-1979 had royal patronage as an impor-tant political context. It was impossible for large organisations (except the religious hierocracy) to operate independently. For them to survive, royal, state patronage was a necessity. Different degrees of royal, state patronage - from personal sponsoring to general ideological incorpora-tion - relate to both the êaf>alsh¿hsø social prominence and the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hsø sudden religious critique. Internally, the êaf>alsh¿h order remained a theatre of conflict, which involved contestations of Freemasonry conceptions of spiritual authority. What made these conflicts characteristic of the period 1941-1979, was the political twist given to them. The Society of Brotherhood was no exception to the Sufi Mystery of Power that established author-ity through the denial of worldly attachments. Nevertheless, internal enemies were well aware of these attachments, and political implica-tions, and rejected them. Among the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs, to the contrary, unitary order was visibly established. There had been resistance to N ́r>alsh¿høs appointment, but ê¿leú>alsh¿h and Reß¿>alsh¿h came uncontested. Both leaders cherished contacts with state and societal - particularly religious - authorities, and the earlier phase of bloody per-secutions had been left behind. The pupils of former modernist critics did not pick up their mastersø fights, and unitary spiritual authority even survived Reß¿>alsh¿høs late politico-religious shift of sides. Externally, while the êaf>alsh¿h elite integrated into the stately re-gime, the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs developed close ties to the lateral, clerical regime that came to represent the Iranian nation more successfully. Re-ß¿>alsh¿høs condemnation of the Shah and his meeting with Khomeyni were conditioned upon the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hsø relative independence, crea-ted through civil, religious and political integration, which provided crucial room for manoeuvre when the balance of religious power shif-ted. Despite relations with prominent representatives of the Pahlavi re-gime, the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hsø royal patronage did not extend beyond some measure of ideological incorporation. Institutional overlap between the Society of Brotherhood and the National Lodge, to the contrary, defined an exclusive position, which ruled out any manoeuvre for the êa-f>alsh¿h order when the political tide swept away the Shahøs regime."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"PART THREEIn the Islamic Republic "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"This page intentionally left blank"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE PURGATORY REVOLUTION, 1979-1989 Shortly after the victory of the Islamic revolution, one of its foreign academic supporters stated that fithe word ›mysticismø is a little prob-lematical‹ and that fiSufism as an organized body has only a peripheral existence in [the] Shi<i school.

These developments facilitated their accommodation in the Islamic Republic. The depth of Sufi suffering that can be attributed to the revolution is still lacking in any precise measurement to this day.

The extent to which the êaf>alsh¿hs and SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs succeeded in maintaining them-selves in the Islamic Republic, was conditioned not only on contingent forces but also variant reputations on the eve of the revolution, and dif-ferent sets of performance in the face of the new circumstances. The disadvantage of ties to the ancien régime made itself felt in the êaf->alsh¿h order. The stains of an otherwise spoiled SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h repu-tation were blurred, inversely, by a pre-revolution meeting with Khomeyni made public in the Islamic Republic. Through the shadows of the past and the revolutionary fervour, new mystic regimes appeared. Until 1996, the history of the Islamic Republic roughly divided into three periods in which the state ideology successively emphasised the supremacy of Islam alone (›Islam-Islamø), then blended it with patriot-ism (›Islam-Iranø), and finally, with full-blown nationalism (›Iran-Iranø).5 The third period - after the ›decade of war and revolutionø6 and Khomeyniøs death in 1989 - brought a series of reforms. These included ideological moderation and the emergence of ›state mysticismø, enabling Shi>ite Sufism to accommodate to regime religiosity (see chapter 6). In the first period, however, the Shi>ite hierocracy reoriented itself towards state affiliation, and Khomeyniøs doctrine of the absolute Rule of the Jurist.

Social configurations in which rulers co-operated closely with jurists (as in the late Safavid era) had been par-ticularly detrimental. Now, with the Shi>ite vanguardøs assumption of state power - i.e. rulers and jurists uniting in terms of personnel - revo-lutionary purges had to be lying in wait.9 Certain clerical attitudes moreover seemed to make these plausible.

When I asked for evidence, he decided not to stress the point. A student who was sympathetic to the revolution explained to me that Sufism was referred to in schools as an example of what Islam would be if devoid of its social mission. He cited political statements of Shi>ite revolution-aries but he could not produce one that framed Sufism as infidelity (kofr), polytheism (sherk) or illegitimate innovation (bed>at). Officials in Tehranøs Parliament Library looked at me sternly when I introduced myself, but they nevertheless allowed me to consult their collection, which included generally accessible Sufi handwritings.

The (hi)story of the ~o<r-Rey¿sateyn Ne>matoll¿h order provides the particular context for its articulation. The ~o<r-Rey¿sateyn order as it is presently known, was shaped and moulded by Javad Nurbakhsh, who became its qoÃb in 1953. In 1955, Nurbakhsh bought the lodge of his deceased spiritual master in the South of Tehran and reportedly had it registered as a religious endow-ment (vaqf). It was, according to a Tehrani affiliate, enlarged through on August 9 on charges that included [...] being a Freemason and a member of the International Lions organization‹ (U.S. Department of State, Iran Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1997, pp. 6; 2).

The ~o<r-Rey¿sateyn mords had their private places in the lodge, but they did not live inside. The masterøs modern views held that social life was to be accomplished outside the lodge, while the inside was reserved for spirituality. From 1962 to 1977, Nurbakhsh combined the leadership of the order, among many other activities, with a position as psychiatry professor in Tehran.12 In 1974, Nurbakhsh visited the United States and in 1975, the first American convent was founded in New York City. More American lodges followed, and a building was purchased in London as well. The ›templesø attracted Iranian students who had gone abroad for education. fiThey lacked spirituality in the West,‹ a Tehrani affiliate told me, fiso they came to look for it with Dr. Nurbakhsh.‹ He was the appropriate man for them, because as a secular professor - who was lecturing aca-demic audiences on Freudian psychoanalysis - he represented the West-ernised and educated elite, while his Sufi spirituality represented in some ways a compromise between religion and modern life.13 In the Western wave of ›spiritual reorientationø in the 1960s and 1970s, it was possibly this very attraction that brought foreigners to Nurbakhshøs or-der as well.14 About a dozen of them travelled to Iran to see the spiritual homeland of their newly found, mystic faith, to go around the country to visit lodges, and see the main lodge in Tehran.

In his writings, the stress on Islam became less pronounced. While the earliest publication strikes one as fairly traditional, later references to Islam have an ambivalent, which is to say ecumenical sound to them.16 When the revolution came, the ~o<r-Rey¿sateyn had not only physically (geo-graphically) but also spiritually become an international order.17 15 NURBAKHSH, 1991: 157; LEWISOHN, 1998: 459. Contacts were reported between Nurbakhsh and Seyyed Hossein Nasr (who was held to still regularly visit the London lodge whenever he came around), and Henry Corbin is also reported to have regularly visited the order in the 1970s. 16 Golz¿r-e M ́nes from the late 1940s is a traditional composition (highly valued by non-~o<r-Rey¿sateyn Ne>matoll¿hs as well), in honour of Nurbakhshøs master. Three decades later, a statement by Nurbakhsh still looked traditional: fisince a sufi must be a Moslem, whoever claims to be a sufi without being a Moslem, makes a false claim‹ (1978: 107). However, GRAMLICH cited a sheikh (before the revolution) who stated there were no preconditions whatsoever for an adultøs entrance, which contrasted sharply with even the êaf>alsh¿h Consultancy Counciløs demand for monotheism (1981: 74). In a 1991 summary of the Ne>matoll¿h order - that says curiously little about Nurbakhshøs immediate forebears, while earlier qoÃbs are expounded upon (9ê ̇LEî>ALSH ̇HK , 1375/1996: 433, mentioned a rupture) - Nurbakhsh only once referred to the meaning of Islam for him, which puts in doubt the extent to which he still conceived of Sufism as intrinsically Islamic. Ecumenicalism stood out: fiAny propagation of Sufism should aim at the reality of Islam so that an attitude of love may be generated capable of unifying followers of divergent faiths‹ [my emphasis] (1991: 158). My first impression of ~o<r-Rey¿sateyn ecumenicalism derived from visiting the London kh¿naq¿h in 1996 and reading the magazine Sufi, both of which addressed international audiences interested in spiritual progress in a broad sense. This corre-sponded to a reproach against Nurbakhsh by an enemy of Sufism: fiY¿ >Al madad [Oh >Al Saviour, a general Shi>ite formula] was changed into Y¿ úaqq [Oh Ultimate Real-ity/God, a specific Sufi formula the ambiguity of which leaves for many interpretations] [...] in order for him to be accepted by non-Islamic masses as well‹ [my insertions] (9ê ̇LEî>ALSH ̇HK, 1375 /1996: 398-9).

Idries SHAHøs international Sufi Movement featured a similar ecumenicalism - in his case particularly concerning Suf-ism and Freemasonry, which, he said, were basically the same (1964: 206-7). 17 LEWISOHNøs (1998: 439) interpretation of ~o<r-Rey¿sateyn history stated that fiPersian Sufis - the [~o<r-Rey¿sateyn] branch of the Ni>matull¿hiyya in particular - have often [...] aligned themselves with advocates of secular liberalism and moder-nization.‹ As regards the late twentieth century, however, evidence for such a statement is lacking.

This reading is supported by the orderøs external activities in the Islamic Republic, which it tried to convert into a home.46 The double mission of social and religious integration, which was successfully accomplished in the Pahlavi period but now under renewed strain, was to be re-established.

In March 1988, near the end, Tehran was exposed to the Iraqisø shelling of the civilian population. Iranianness was now at stake, 49 Texts in HOM ̇YçN, 1371/1992: 221-2 (from EÃÃel¿>¿t).

Reß¿>alsh¿h did not resort to aliases in order to conceil mystic affiliations, but when he spoke in public, he spoke as a Shi>ite Muslim, addressing Shi>ite audiences. These facts are indicative of a rather com-plex economy of meaning, in which religious nationalism is only one element and in which Sufi identity is maintained through its dissimula-tion.

This, in turn, defined a major premise of lasting control over it.57 In March 1989, three years before his passing away, Reß¿>alsh¿h made the contrary circumstances of wartime agony the topic of his speech in a gathering in the neutral îoseynya, on the occasion of the national, Iranian, Persian New Year (nowr ́z): Last year was among the worst this country has seen. The people were exposed to missiles and the friends and the foqar¿, from close by and far off, invited me: from Khorasan, from the North, Dubai, and Zahedan. But I said I will not move from among the friends and the foqar¿. In joy I was with them, in difficulty I will also remain, until God removes this blight. We have no remedy but to turn to God. Even if we do not get an answer, we have no other place to go. We must knock on that very door, knock that door to such an extent that in the end a head will appear from that door [....] Last year was the most calamitous year for this country [....] Ensh¿<ll¿h may God, from his mercy, absolve our land.58 invites believers to conceive of it as a signpost in holy war (although on September 17, 1996 (EÃÃel¿>¿t, ̇`ar 27), Rafsanjani surprisingly referred to mosques as an ›esoterical decoration for the seekers of truthø). Shi>ite Sufism reserves a special reverence for the first Imam, and it is often heard from them that the kh¿naq¿h is the Place of Worship for Imam >Al. It is not predominantly the political history of the Imamøs defeat by Mo>¿viya, but his gnostic wisdom that constitutes the Imam as an object of Sufi wor-ship. But whether or not Shi>ite Sufis manage to convince others of their reading of kh¿naq¿h, it does not have a clearly circumscribed Islamic meaning. There were con-stant worries in Iran with respect to declining attendance to Iranøs estimated 70.000 mosques (According to Iran News, 06/04/97, there were about 2.000 mosques in Tehran in 1997). One of the reasons was the existence of ›unlawful mosquesø, fiattendance to which equals heresy‹, and the hypocritical leaders of which fiscared off the >oraf¿ and the faithful (mo<men) youth‹ (>ARAB-NEZH ̇D, 1375/1996). These allusions most probably refer to kh¿naq¿hs. 56 Usually, mosques are considered Godøs House (EÃÃel¿>¿t, ̇b¿n 15, 1375/Novem-ber 5, 1996). 57 Cf.

A typical title for such an article would be ›Dismantling of four Freemasonry lodges in Shirazø (EÃÃel¿>¿t, Farvardn 20, 1358/April 9, 1979). Although if anything these articles prove that very little was found, they reverberate in Persian secondary literature as ›evidenceø (cf.

He became Minister of Labour under Bazargan, but distanced himself from the National Front when it increasingly criticised clerical rule (RAHNEMA and NOMANI, 1990: 200). After leaving Iran, he nevertheless spoke for the opposition Party of the People of Iran in Paris (Echo of Iran, 50, March 1992). On November 22, 1998 For ́har and his wife were stabbed to death in their home in Tehran, which provoked an international outcry. 65 A clash between differently affiliated airforce officers took place on February 10, 1979 at an airforce-training base in Tehran, which was the beginning of the armyøs final disintegration (RAHNEMA and NOMANI, 1990: 16).

Not, however, public appeal. Contrary to the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order, which enhanced its Sufi reputation from a purged religious centre, the êaf>alsh¿h orderøs traditional, Shi>ite mourning ceremonies were deliberately kept apart - literally, in their spatial allocation (in the Salon) - from the lodgeøs Sufi activities. Sufi activities included Monday and Thursday night `ekr sessions, in the room containing the grave of êaf>alsh¿h, adjacent to the Salon. The gatherings would take about two hours and were preceded by some sixty minutes of generally Shi>ite sermons in the Salon. These were encapsulated in the larger Sufi event as the entrance of affiliates into the lodge, beforehand, went along with ritual, Sufi greeting (mo§¿faú¿), and before the revolution, too, they had accompanied Sufi gatherings. The leaders of the Board of Trustees would mostly be there, informally marking their authority through being seated together, occupying a cen-tral place (see figure 14) and by taking the lead and initiative in oratory and chanting. In addition, there would be regular Sufis affiliated to the order before the revolution as well, novices who never failed to be pre-sent, new visitors with an undefined Sufi affiliation and curious passers-by.

Depending on mournersø commitment, there are annual repe-titions of the mar¿sem-e khatm, the fortieth one of which (that makes for the chelle) carries special significance.

Although the actual Kh¿naq¿h building in Tehran remains in much the same state, the building is used primarily as a mosque, and the dervishes who still adhere to this branch of the Ni>matull¿hiyya seem to have given in to government pressure to participate in formalities unrelated to Sufism.‹ First, ›Maktab-i >Al b. Ab $¿lib,ø referring to Shi>ism in general, is an unlikely description for any particular Shi>ite (including Sufi Shi>ite) grouping. Sufis who claimed they represented the Society of Brotherhood did not refer to their assembly as ›Maktab-i >Al b. Ab $¿libø to me.

These did noth-ing, therefore, to improve on êaf>alsh¿h Sufi legitimacy. More strikingly so than the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs, the post-revolution êaf>alsh¿hs in Tehran were a new order. Many affiliates claimed - and this corresponded to the predominance of juveniles in the kh¿naq¿h -that they had come to the lodge of êaf>alsh¿h since about fifteen years, which is to say: they did not know the order, other than under the new command of the Board of Trustees.69 A general observation of Sufism in the Islamic Republic, applied in particular to the êaf>alsh¿h order: [...] Words are now carried in Iran by people who have recently em-barked on the path, because the old prs and morsheds and their represen-tatives have for various reasons - such as their maintaining of relations with members of the previous royal family, or relations with international societies - either been eradicated, or they have moved to settle in other places in the world.70 The Board of Trustees had nothing to fear from what remained of the Society of Brotherhood, and the centre of gravity in the êaf>alsh¿h or-der definitely shifted back to the lodge of êaf>alsh¿h.

The struggle against Borh¿n on the part of the Board of Trustees involved a tested repertoire of character assassination for heretics. From the point of personal com-petence, it stressed, Borh¿n was unsuitable to lead any group, and from the point of morality, more effectively, he was a failure. The informal leader of the Board of Trustees once related to novices of the visit by a woman, full of complaints, who had asked Borh¿n for help. The pre-tender-sheikh had then accepted a conspicuously decorated ring from her, an act anathema to any Sufi ethos. fiTo ask for money is to destroy [the morality of] oneøs deeds‹, the leader interpreted, and implied that Borh¿n was but a miserable thief.72 fiHe accepted money, and they have thrown him out,‹ another Sufi summarised.73 Borh¿n resided in a êaf>alsh¿h lodge in Gilan and naturally cher-ished the inverse conception. His ej¿ze - the most important classical argument in claims to spiritual authority, whatever its particular worth - favoured the rebel sheikh over the Board of Trustees, not any of whose leaders possessed such a document of authorisation. Seen through this historical mandate, they were to be considered illegitimate usurpers. In amazement of the contrast with the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs, I asked an old êaf>alsh¿h master: fiWhat do all these conflicts stem from, why are they here?‹ He responded, in what seemed doctrinal imposition - a le-gitimisation of contingent disintegration: fiThey are necessary, because through them it appears who is the jewel (gowhar).‹74 For the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs, however, this contest was eliminated in advance. Two mechanisms in particular, accounted for this: i) initiation (tasharrof) was (among other things) conditioned upon recognition of the leader as 72 fiWe have [...] pointed to the marriage of Sh¿h Ne>matoll¿høs offspring with princes [....] from the rule of the Sufis who have [...], in raising the standard of their material wealth, filled their stomachs [...], we have a complete sufficiency of informa-tion.

Although the ej¿ze had been a fiercely con-tested asset in the order, it currently lacked a clear definition: fiWith us, it does not have the strict meaning that it has among the SolÃ¿n>al-sh¿hs. It only generally denotes the authorisation to grant advice and instruction,‹ an affiliate reflected.76 The lack of an exclusive and unified structure in êaf>alsh¿h spiritual authority, in doctrine as much as in practice, made for its permanent contestation. Several Sufis in the main êaf>alsh¿h lodge in Tehran shared Borh¿nøs claim and felt that the sheikh was the lodgeøs legitimate heir. Others felt that whether or not he should be the lodgeøs one and only spiritual leader, he did have the right, as any qualified and charismatic Sufi had, to lead the religious sessions. Borh¿n reportedly derived pleasure from unannounced visits every once in a while, and from a provocative presence during the `ekr. The sheikh from Gilan was an untamed challenge for the Board of Trustees.77 An ousted sheikh named Val Dorost resided at the foot of the Damavand mountain in northern Tehran, at a comfortable distance from the main lodge. Nowadays, Dorost was conducting Sufism ›from his ownø, which is to say: he did not follow another sheikh, and he repre-sented the starting point of a new spiritual genealogy, much like the Oveys sheikhs who stressed the individual master-pupil relationship. The Board of Trustees dealt with Dorost as it had dealt with Borh¿n. In response, Dorost - who at my instigation confirmed he possessed an ej¿ze by sheikh Maúm ́d Sangesar, but contrary to Borh¿n made no legitimising point of it - mentioned another classical argument that 75 Interview 9Maj` ́b>alsh¿hK, 05/07/ 97.

State power weakened and gave way to a plethora of power centres, which benefited the resurgence of Iranian society. An-other, related effect of these regime changes, consisted of an indirect and double rapprochement between Sufism and the state. On the one hand, the state broadened its definition of legitimate reli-giosity, which brought Sufism closer to officially sanctioned, Islamic respectability. Even where Sufis remained passive, the regime changes were significant for Sufi practice: fitransformations in the larger politi-cal arena in which [...] performance takes place result in changes in what [...] performance means‹ (VAN DER VEER, 1994: 82). The changes involved the stateøs appropriation of mystical notions, in definitions which had been laid down in Khomeyniøs >erf¿n. Through ›state mysti-cismø, Sufi performance approximated what SCOTT (1990) called the ›public transcriptø, of state Islam.1 As discrepancy between hidden and public transcripts accounts for the level of domination (1990: 4), one may conclude that state mysticism lessened the domination of Sufism. On the other hand, fithe position of religious regimes in political are-nas is [...] effected by the type of ideology [...] espoused‹ (THODEN VAN VELZEN, 1992: 203). The themes of social service, sacrifice and mystical martyrdom - state concerns as well - marked Sufi discourse in both Ne>matoll¿h orders. But beyond this, the êaf>alsh¿hs and Sol-Ã¿n>alsh¿hs tapped different repertoires in relating to state mysticism, and they accommodated differently. For the êaf>alsh¿hs, bonds of allegiance to the clerical state elite - whether they existed before or not, being either imagined or real - did not restore the unified leadership. Sufis in the various branches reproached each other for either being related to the state, or for deviating from state Islam. There was a ›dou-ble emulationø in one of the êaf>alsh¿h branches: in its allegiance to (mystical) state Islam, it did not claim to embody, itself, any authority. 1 ›Hidden transcriptø means fidiscourse [...] ›offstageø, beyond direct observation by powerholders,‹ the ›publicø one fiopen interaction between subordinates and those who dominate‹ (1990: 4, 2)."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"172 CHAPTER SIX But in an affiliatesø ›hidden transcriptø, it was the masterøs sovereign spiritual authority that mediated the state allegiance.

In contrast to the covert nature of spiritual authority in the above êaf>alsh¿h branch, the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hsø explicit authority division proved acceptable to some of the clerical elite, as they visited the lodge. For the SolÃ¿n->alsh¿hs, who could trace their allegiance to Khomeyni and his >erf¿n legacy back to the Pahlavi period, state ties strengthened spiritual au-thority, and benefited the orderøs religious reintegration. In neither of these cases, however, would the meaning of Sufi per-formance be fully grasped as a fismuggling of portions of the hidden transcript, suitably veiled, onto the public stage‹ (SCOTT, 1990: 157). The public stage, in spite of its dangers, was much more than an arena for dissimulation. It was also the place where Sufis could, through va-rious strategies, attain ›authenticallyø wished for, Islamic respectability. STATE MYSTICISM State interference into affairs deemed private was regarded a ›nuisanceø (moz¿úem) by many Sufis.2 Individuals were targeted in their private realms, but state interference was most visible in publications and au-dio-visual releases that entered into the public realm.

There may have been such cases, but it is unlikely that they were part of a co-ordinated policy. The public functions of several SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h notables provide counterevidence for that. My observation of several Basj in lodges (simply there to enjoy the congregation) and the reported popularity among the Basj of the Kh¿ks¿r, moderate his statement that fithe Islamic Republicøs distrust of, and hostility to the dervish orders is reflected in the fact that members of the armed services in Iran are not allowed to belong to any Sufi Ãarqa nor, indeed, to frequent kh¿naq¿hs, since the intelligence service of the govern-ment considers the hand of America [...] to be directly behind the present popularity of Sufism in Iran and the West‹."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"173 REFORM(UL)ATIONS store-owner in a Tehrani suburb mentioned that in his area alone at least eighty copies of the popular tape had been sold, which to him implied a multitude of that number had been bought in the centre of town.

More striking as an instance of state interference, however, was the slow and unannounced appropriation of mysticism by the state itself.

In winter 1989, Khomeyniøs mystical letter to his daughter-in-law was published, written three years earlier, which again contained Sufi references: fiOh Sufi, you have to polish the Armour of Love / and be faithful to the Promise you made / as long as you remain yourself, you will not reach Union with the Beloved / you have to annihilate your self, in the Way of the Friend.‹8 Beyond intellectual debt, Khomeyniøs relation to mysti-cism was ingrained in the collective Sufi memory of the Imam lashing out against the îojjatye Society - the staunchest ideological enemy of 6 Keyh¿n, Res¿lat, Bahman 11, 1375/January 3, 1997.

Mostly, as in KNYSHøs eye-opener review (1992), an intellectual debt was stressed. The documented relations between mysticism and the Imam may be historically summarised as follows: From 1922, Khomeyni studied >erf¿n in Qom. From 1929, he wrote mystical treatises (P¿sd¿r-e esl¿m, 1375/1997, 182: 29, mentioned Sharú-e do>¿-ye saúar, Mi§b¿h al-hid¿ya il¿ al-khil¿fa wa<l-wil¿ya, and commentaries on the Fu§ ́s al-úikam and Mi§b¿ú al-uns), in some of which historical Sufis were positively referred to. Thereafter he taught >erf¿n, but in the early 1960s, he cancelled his lessons, probably because political activities occupied all of his attention. But in his political lectures abroad, as in 1972, the Imam kept on referring to >erf¿n. After the revolution, there were televised ›lessonsø from Khomeyniøs Tafsr-e s ́ra-ye úamd (P¿sd¿r-e esl¿m, 1375/1997, 182: 30, erroneously claimed this was mentioned by Knysh). In 1983, a student in Hamadan found several of his mystical manuscripts (belonging to his collection raided by SAVAK in 1968), that the Imam allowed for publi-cation the same year. In 1986, he wrote a mystical letter to his daughter-in-law. In 1989, he wrote a letter to Gorbatsjov that contained new references to mysticism, and until his death, he wrote mystical poetry. Cf. VAJDANI, 1982; FAHIMI, 1989; P ̇K-D ̇MAN, 1989; RAFSANJANI, 1989, TER HAAR, 1995. Of KHOMEYNIøs political writ-ings, Jeh¿d-e akbar y¿ mob¿raze b¿ nafs (The Greater Jihad or the Struggle with the Soul) particularly stands out as mystical.

There were more physical connections as well. One observer felt it was not fiout of context to mention [that] Khomeyniøs former residence and the place where he gave audience to his people in the north of Tehran [was] itself a Sufi mosque and sanctu-ary.‹10Sufis moreover claimed Khomeyniøs personal initiation, which he reportedly spoke about on television shortly after the revolution.11 Khomeyniøs carefully construed hagiography as Master of the foqah¿ - already in wide circulation during his lifetime - was thus revised in an unexpected, mystical rapprochement to the >oraf¿. It is probably accu-rate to interpret these changes as events allowed to come into the open by some, which were nevertheless not foreseen by the regime. Rafsan-jani, in any case, was quick to capitalise on them politically: In November 1989, Rafsanjani presented a long eulogy in which he played down Khomeyniøs role as the charismatic leader of the down-trodden masses. Rafsanjani depicted him instead as a first-rank theolo-gian and philosopher, especially on mysticism, as a major scholar who had given ›a new lease on lifeø to the Qom seminaries, and as a world-famous figure who had restored Iranøs national sovereignty [italics mine].12 However, the emergence of state mysticism knew more preconceived regime expressions as well.

There is one mention of a wartime poster carrying the text sangar-e >eshq (›trench of loveø) (op. cit., p. 82), the evocative significance of which doubtlessly derived, in part, from sang (blood, as part of sangar-e >eshq).

Both the êaf>alsh¿h centre and its peripheries, however, absorbed mystical regime religiosity (though in contrary ways). The informal leader of the Board of Trustees had no pretensions whatsoever of being a sheikh. He dressed soberly, as is ideally required of Muslims, and he abhorred the Sufi regalia that some of his more tra-ditional subjects carried. Rebel sheikhs pointed at this not only to con-demn the Board of Trusteesø illegitimate innovation of Sufism, but they also interpreted it as a sign of secret state affiliations. One of the board members, they pointed out, had been a Revolutionary Guard during the revolution, and later on become an employee in the Ministry of Educa-tion. A member of the Endowments Organisation was on the Board, and there were financial transactions between the two. When I pointed at a damaged painting in the erstwhile library, the informal leader told me a state institution (the S¿zem¿n-e ersh¿d) was called upon to repair it, and many suggested the lodgeøs property was now owned by the state. Given these relations, there would be no room for alternative spiritu-al authority, independent of the state. The absence of any sheikh on the Board corresponded to its claim of being void of spiritual authority itself. However, the presence of a sovereign spiritual guide had traditio-nally been seen as a necessity, both cosmologically and for individuals. Blessing could come from the master only, as without him, the world would lose its balance and novices ran the risk of great spiritual harm.

There were other safety-valves as well. There was a little wooden frame, stuck to the lodgeøs entrance, which contained a sheet of rules specifying - in addition to the sheikhøs spiri-tual authority - that no-one was allowed in who did not observe the social order. At first, nobody wished to discuss the rules, trying - de-spite their eye-catching display - to convince me they meant nothing. Later on, the official reply held that: fiif people come from the outside, ignorant as to what goes on inside, they have to be informed as to what constitutes proper behaviour.‹ In the end, however, and in private, a Sufi told that basically the rules were for protection. ›Protectionø was for outsiders - for them not to project into Sufism anything like anti-regime religiosity - as for insiders, fithe real ¿d¿b are a matter of the heart.‹45 Contrary to the lodge of êaf>alsh¿h, which was proverbially open all day and night, the gate of üahr od-Dowleøs kh¿naq¿h usually re-mained closed until the commonersø preparations for the majles started: cleaning the yard, sweeping the congregation room, checking the stereo equipment, and preparing tea and sweets.46 In the lodge of üahr od-Dowle, in other words, there were presumably many things to guard.

He had changed cus-tomary dress by ordering the stigmatising Sufi kafans for the wardrobe. Now I understood the impeccably dressed man, who, on another occa-sion, had started to undress in the lodge. He had first taken of his shirt, then his trousers, and underneath, to my surprise, had appeared a folded, long, white robe. He saw me watching him and explained: fiI couldnøt do this in the street.‹ Just to make sure, I asked: fiYouøre wearing a kafan?‹ fiNo‹, he said, fijust the dervish clothing (p ́shesh-e darvsh).‹50 A glimpse of the things that were being avoided once became visible in advance of the religious sessions - which were invariably preceded by generally Shi>ite prayer (nam¿z) - when a politically charged debate ensued in the yard. A novice apparently unaware of any danger, said: fiWe donøt agree with the way things are now, this [the Islamic Repub-lic] is not real Islam.‹51 Then someone from the lodge - only recently purged with respect to clothing - probably worried about my observa-tions and quickly corrected, by arguing with sweet reason: fiNo, no, please: things are not that simple.

The masterøs innocuous discourse - prescribing general, mystical Shi>ite religiosity, in neglect of the Freemasonry signs, the contestations of illegitimate innovations in the Pahlavi era, or the Society of Brother-hoodøs proximity to the Monarchy - had left its mark on the world out-side the lodge. In response to the question what brought him on the track of Sufism, one faithful affiliate - always present in the lodge - decided to entrust his life-history to me, which did not contain any ref-erence to these stigmatising backgrounds: My ending up here has a story to it. I was in a theatre-school, where I met with a woman I grew very fond of. It was not being in love, just being very fond of her. Then I began reading î¿feˆ and Mowl¿n¿, who touched me very deeply as well. But then I got into trouble and I ended up in prison. I was desperate, until úaßrat-e î¿feˆ appeared before me. This gave me an enormous strength. When I was released from prison, I made the pilgrimage to Mashhad. Once again, î¿feˆ appeared before me and he told me there was an organisation in Tehran named Anjoman-e okhov-vat, opposite Mell Bank. Having reached it, they told me I should get it all out of my head, but I held tight and finally they said: ›All right, go to the North of Tehranø. I went to take a look, I went from house to house and every time I asked, people told me it was not there. But I did not give in and after a long time I again asked someone: › ̇q¿, where do the der-vishes meet over here?ø He pointed at a spot right in front of him, and that was the kh¿naq¿h of üahr od-Dowle. That was eleven years ago. The most important contrast between the two êaf>alsh¿h branches, however, involved spiritual authority. Contrary to the Board of Trus-tees, the striving after respectability in üahr od-Dowleøs lodge did not include an abstention from alternative spiritual authority. Only, it was microphone and speakers. In advance of the sessions, however, men and women rather freely mingled (as in other lodges). 53 Conversations, 07/10/97; 07/17/97.

Conveniently adding to the depth of senti-ments, it also included a political subtext, for some, who took the proto-typical figure of Islamic martyrdom literally. 74 LEWISOHN (1998: 453) cited London-based Nmr ́z (Bahman 5, 1375/January 24, 1997): fiApproximately two weeks prior to his heart-attack, in order to curb the growing popularity of the order, police [...] concocted the excuse that, inter alia, the dervishes were engaging in immoral activities (lahw wa la>b).

The new leaderøs first public act, the day after his nephewøs death, was proclaiming a decree with five rules of conduct. It was based on his grandfatherøs Pand-e ê¿leú, allegedly in a perfect, essential unity with it. Two elements strike one in contrast to the rules of Maúb ́b>alsh¿h.

Maj` ́b>alsh¿h thus took care of accommodation by closing interpretive space between gen-eral SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h rules and specific socio-political reality. Secondly, the rules also contained a worked-out division of spiritual authority:84 1) \t[...] the observation of the Islamic úej¿b [...] is a necessary condi-tion for individual and societal chastity, and, likewise, pay abun-dant attention to the honouring of piety for men. 2) \t[...] for the first time for over one hundred years ago, SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h forbade the use of illicit drugs, and even opium ad-dicts [...], and he did not favour cigarettes [...].85 3) \tThe fixed obligations (vaˆ¿<f-e moqarrare) in the holy Islamic re-ligion have, by the high-placed >oraf¿, been implicitly divided ac-cording to kind. Rulings (aúk¿m) of the holy law [...] one must emulate from the [...] mojtahed [....] Rulings of the Ãarqat [...] are received from the Great One of the Age, and >erf¿n instruction has also been deposited in the books of the Great >oraf¿. 4) \t[...] involvement [...] in social issues is not within the jurisdiction of the Ãarqat and the foqar¿ must not expect the Great Ones to di-rect them in this sense [....], non-involvement in social issues will be observed as it was before. 5) \tThe observation of social order and respect and watchfulness with respect to the law, we must historically learn from Socrates [....] The observation of the communal law is respect for oneself and others.

But as the social order changed its shapes, the rulesø content changed as well, as much as the meaning of perform-ance changes through transformations in the political sphere. ›The ob-servation of the Islamic úej¿b,ø for instance, was a new prescription (though old practice) that one encountered in about any restaurant or post-office as well.

While the >oraf¿ constituted the legitimate succession to the twelfth Imam in spiritual terms, the foqah¿ were to be followed in worldly affairs (rules 3 and 4). Respect for the social order - which hap-pened to be determined by foqah¿ - was a religious obligation (rules 1 and 5). Despite the fact that all of this sounded perfectly obedient and respectful, the rules simultaneously marked a daring innovation. They publicly carved out, for the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order, for the first time in the Islamic Republic, a spiritual realm in which it alone could legitimately claim sovereignty (rule 3). In comparison, such open assertion sharply contrasted to ›double emulationø in the lodge of üahr od-Dowle, and with the Board of Trusteesø ›circle for the devotion of êaf>alsh¿hø.

A few days before he died, these rumours said, he had threatened to speak out publicly, naming names, on corruption and other excesses of government. Therefore, a Sufi con-firmed, he had been poisoned, in March 1995, dying a martyrøs death. In a recent defence of the order, ayatollah Khomeyniøs legitimisation of (SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h) mysticism was once again emphatically referred to: [...] They base themselves on the treatise of [...] ¿yatoll¿h ol->oˆm¿ Mr Khomeyni, claiming he criticised the cognomina Maj` ́b>alsh¿h or Maúb ́b>alsh¿h.

During the new leaderøs second public act - presiding over his nephewøs burial - one event clearly illuminated Maúb ́b>alsh¿høs consolidation of SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h legitimacy.

This sheds light on the contemporary relevance in the historical discussion (in both treatises) of 9Maúb ́b>alsh¿hK and 9Maj` ́b>alsh¿hK. 93 Personal observation, 02/21/97. Khomeyniøs elder brother Ayatollah îoseyn Mo§Ãaf¿v, or Sayyed Morteß¿, Pasandde died in November 1996 (Jomh ́r-ye esl¿m, ̇b¿n 28, 1375/November 18, 1996, Sal¿m, ̇b¿n 24, 1375/November 14, 1996).

On the one hand, this was caused by the emergence of state mysticism, and by Sufismøs continuous ethical réveil on the other. The êaf>alsh¿h Board of Trustees considered itself devoid of any spiritual authority and focused, neutrally, on the image of êaf>alsh¿h. The central orderøs public, external performances pointed to the politi-cised context of mystical martyrdom in Iran, under the surface of tradi-tional Sufi/Shi>ite laments. In üahr od-Dowleøs lodge, outward behav-iour was prescribed by rules that demanded respect for the socio-political order. But in informal gatherings, Sufis upheld continuity in remembrance of the discredited Society of Brotherhood, and a sover-eign sheikhal authority. Spiritual authority in the lodge of üahr od-Dowle, therefore, was marked by an ambiguous, ›double emulationø. Among the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs, internal order remained uncontested. The leadership of Maúb ́b>alsh¿h had been authorised by divine sanc-tion and his fatherøs meticulous preparation for it. His death presented itself in a similar historical continuity, of saintly, Islamic martyrdom. This religious frame of reference enhanced the spiritual significance of Maúb ́b>alsh¿høs visionary letters of appointment, and vice versa. Maj-` ́b>alsh¿høs new proclamation of allegedly old rules - for external as much as internal consumption - outlined meticulously detailed socio-political modesty, but - as if in exchange for it - also circumscribed an exclusive realm of Sufi spiritual authority. A barometer of strength and confidence, the formality of these assertive SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h rules telling-ly contrasted with the silent ambiguity of ›double emulationø in üahr od-Dowleøs lodge. The SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs effectively argued the legitima-cy of their spiritual realm in references to Khomeyni.

Regarding the classical definition of civil society - civility and asso-ciational life beyond primordial attachments, significantly independent from the state - the mystic regimes have not been a clear referent.1 They do function in ways, however, that resemble the history of emergence of Western civil societies. On this comparative basis, one may identify mystic regime contributions to the emerging civil society in Iran, which mainly consist of Sufi competition for spiritual authority with the state. CIVIL SOCIETY IN THE SECOND AND THIRD REPUBLICS The Islamic Republic has often represented itself as a total power, but it has hosted many conflicting bases of domination that have diminished effective centralisation. Factionalism, a keyword in many analyses of the Islamic Republic under Khomeyni,2 was a strategic asset enhancing divide and rule, but more important, pervasive in the state machinery, it testified to the limits of centralisation. Factionalism remained endemic after the Islamic Republic Partyøs dissolution in 1987 and Khomeyniøs demise in 1989. Thereafter charismatic state authority waned and Ira-nian society saw signs of civil assertion that prompted analysts to speak of a ›second republicø in which fidialogue is the key word.‹3 State mysti-cism was another aspect of regime change. Rafsanjani furthermore in-troduced a ›business cabinetø and there was a broadening of freedom, which has exponentially expanded in the ›third republicø under Khatami. 1 I am referring to the long tradition of thought whose origins lay in antiquity and whose modern representatives included thinkers such as Montesquieu, Smith, Hegel and Weber (cf.

Tehranøs mayor Karbasch, who founded Tehranøs daily newspaper Hamshahr (›citizenø) and worked to rationalise and to some extent secularise city government, enthusiastically declared: fiWe want to teach people what it means to be in possession of citizenship.‹15 Mohammad Khatami, Karbaschøs old friend and an exceptionally liberal Minister of Culture up to his removal in 1992, made civil society a central issue in his presidential campaign, up to May 1997. His 20 million votes derived in large part from youth and women, two of the major groups to benefit from the civil society. In his first speech in of-fice the new president pledged, later on often echoed by the Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Moh¿jer¿n, that he would keep his promise and see to the development of a civil society.

The formal legitimacy of the reported civil society was, even in the Third Republic, fiercely contested, and its associational life to a signifi-cant extent, either materially or ideologically, dependent upon the state. Sufismøs relations to the Iranian state and civil society are explored to the background of these regime dependencies. * * * Sufismøs position vis-à-vis the state in the Islamic Republic has radi-cally altered in comparison to the Pahlavi era. No Sufi leaders are known to be intimate with state leaders. Rather, the two parties are on a hostile footing or relate in attempted co-optation or accommodation (but not patronage). The mystic regimes are ideologically marginal: whether or not they forward themselves as an Anjoman-e esl¿m (as most do), most Iranians do not primarily recognise them as such.

It spoke of ›historical imprisonmentø, the substi-tution of the past for the present and the future: It works merely in members of traditional organisations with historical roots (religious sects and circles, Sufi groups and their likes) [...] These organisations are independent and membership in them is voluntary. But internal relations are based on affection and they do not have a straight and transparent social outcome as concerns the interests of the individual.

The renaissance of (Ne>matoll¿h) Sufism in Iran during the Qajar era occurred through the Qajar dynasty, in the wake of local Iranian rulersø competition for the crown, and state centralisation, which enhanced Sufismøs royal patronage. Although the public preponderance of Sufism diminished in the late Qajar days and during the early Pahlavi period - when the Ne>matoll¿h path once more split in three and the êaf>alsh¿h and SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h orders came into existence - regime connections remained, both materially and ideologi-cally.

Internally, relations have been primordial - in the sense of exclusive and hidden face-to-face interaction that does not meaningfully extend beyond the proximity of direct communication. Externally, Sufi relations have been characterised by either ideological or material state affiliations. The following further explores these internal and external relations, and their bearings on the question of civil society. First, Sufismøs rela-tions to socio-political aims have now been severed, despite ideological state affiliations. Secondly, there have been similarities in the spiritual authority structures of Sufi orders and the state. In this respect, the mys-tic regimes compare to the Iranian state rather than to civil associations. 1. Although an ethical reinterpretation of Islamic mysticism characterised both regime religiosity and Sufism in the late Islamic Republic, the ordersø long-kept mystical depositories also represented a different tra-dition that juxtaposed >erf¿n and >orfan, ›according to civil lawø. A simi-larly traditional concept distinguished social from mystical, inner free-dom. A non-Ne>matoll¿h master proclaimed: fiSufism does not go with the universality, it is the inner way‹ (ta§avvof b¿ j¿me>iyat nst, r¿h-e b¿Ãen ast).30 While Sufisø claims to mystical otherworldliness were contradicted by their (proximity to) social and political power in the Qajar and Pahlavi periods, the rules of Maj` ́b>alsh¿h - especially rule 3, that left social affairs to the jurists - testified to its reality in the Is-lamic Republic. All rules, in all Sufi assemblies, in various definitions pointed to a social space outside their jurisdiction. Many of the dichotomous terms that positioned mysticism vis--vis other disciplines, notions and groups, described complementary rela-tions. However, these were often cast in a hierarchical, triangular scheme, in which the third term synthesised and overarched the others. The Ne>matoll¿h orders respected >orfan and accommodated >erf¿n to regime religiosity. But the overarching spiritual way (r¿h-e ma>nav) belonged to the inside - in persons as in Sufi orders - in which things were hierarchically valued to the extent that they were secret.

The (outside) world, inversely, was a sphere of injustice, hardship and compromise, in which souls were cast, alienated and lost. A critical review of Iranian civil society testified to the wide distribution of these dichotomies in Iranian culture (and the trilateral concepts by implication), to their embedding in traditional Islamic mys-ticism, and to their negation of civil society: In our culture, the oppositions of inside and outside [...], the self and the stranger, have always had a heavy presence.

In their Sufi political economies of meaning, for-mal and external aspects of communicative interaction - such as rules -became a play of either silence, dissimulation, or ›authenticø displays of Islamic repectability. But what was being shielded in any of these cases, was the higher, informal and internal, spiritual life.40 While in the Qajar era they did not shy away from explicit claims to worldly power, and in the Pahlavi dynasty they shared in it through royal patronage, Sufis now had a sui generis existence that was hardly stretched to the accomplishment of socio-political aims. Although SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs engaged in charity during the war with Iraq and so en-hanced social integration, and êaf>alsh¿hs aspired for political ac-commodation through regime religiosity, these activities did not extend social or political aims beyond self-preservation. They brokered Sufism in the Islamic Republic, but they did not mediate it towards the state as a component of the Iranian civil society. In the Pahlavi era, antagonism in relations between Sufi affiliates, masters or orders was largely the result of ›horizontalø competition for spiritual authority.

Claims to powerful and exclusive spiritual authority have charac-terised both Sufi orders and the state, and this analogous ideational structure has been mirrored in social organisation.46 Conceptions of spiritual authority in Iran have historically divided it into religious and royal components.47 The religious component built largely on the ethical or spiritual brokerage of the Prophetic and Imamic messages, while kingshipøs ›divine splendourø, more than God-ordained, mainly derived from thisworldly values of force and might. As ideal types, religious authority derived from representation, while royal au-thority equalled the self-contained value of power. Idealtypically, the revolution has brought religious charisma to the place formerly occu-pied by royal authority, to the fusion of both.48 While for the clergy this 46 Literary representations of the state and of Sufi orders in, respectively, the Islamic Republicøs Constitution and in Sufi rulebooks, are misleading with respect to spiritual authority structures. Constitution Article 1.6.c. that stipulates finegation of all forms of oppression‹ (ARJOMAND, 1988: 375) is superseded by the institutional primacy (and charisma) of faqh power; the (horizontal) divisions between the world of the lodge and the outside world, the realm of the jurists and the realm of the mystics, Ãarqat and shar>at, etc., are mostly subordinated to (vertical) hierarchies which assign primacy to val¿yat or sheikhal authority. Thus, except for similar authority structures, there is a comparison between Sufi orders and the state in their representation, too. 47 Cf., for instance, ARJOMAND, 1988: 6-7 (on Safavid caesaropapism and Qajar du-alism); BEHNAM, 1986: 17-36, 117-54 (on monarchical and clerical authority); MCDANIEL, 1991: 14-47 (on the historical legacy of authoritarian rule in Iran); FRYE, 1957: 186-7, 1964: 36-54 (on the mystique of Iranian Kingship). The significance of royal authority was contested by ABRAHAMIAN, 1978: 29, who saw in it a Western projection in the Oriental Despotism tradition. For a useful summary of discussions on Shi>ite clerical authority, see BAKHASH (1991). fi[I]n Shiite orders such as the Ni>matull¿hiyya and Dhahabiyya, the head of the Ãarqa is always considered the su-preme quÃb, the sole and unique Pole of the Muslim saintly hierarchy, so that his cos-mological role is physically and politically temporalized. One socio-political conse-quence of this doctrine has been that the Persian Sufi murshid is considered not only an absolute monarch over his disciples - quite in accordance with ordinary pr-murd tenets and teachings found in other areas of the Islamic Sufi world - but also the only genuine ruler in the invisible and visible worlds of being‹ (LEWISOHN, 1999: 51). This is not to say the Islamic Republicøs leadership embellishes some form of Monarchy. But one does notice an inspiration - in formulations of leadership, and in the way people address it - which stems from farr-e zad, the ancient royal attribute.

There has been no provision in the ›emulationø (taqld) by the ›imitating believerø (moqalled) of his mojta-hed for a complementary or alternative, independent spiritual realm. Such a sovereign realm has been institutionally sealed in the ›oath of allegiance/initiationø (bey>at) of Sufi to sheikh. Sufismøs royal spiritual authority has been evident in the absolute obedience requested of affiliates, as an ideal and to some extent as a practice, which transcended representational values. One SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h affiliateøs humble task consisted of watching the gate and welcoming visitors. I asked him, after Maúb ́b>alsh¿h died, if he had personally known the master. He turned to me in amazement of such ignorance and said: fiMe? No!

In a general observation of Islamic, ›saintlyø authority, it was remarked that fiin folklore the pir maintains respect much as a sultan might: through the use of brute force.‹54 In the examples from this study, the last part of the observation may be taken metaphorically: as unmediated power. In the Islamic Republic, the clerical component has remained unim-paired in definitions of spiritual authority: both clerics and Sufis claimed representation of Imamic authority, or the leading of their flocks in its name. The refined SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h doctrine that designated a worldly realm in which obedience to the foqah¿< was a religious duty, and signs of its clerical acceptance, were important for the containment of incongruous competition. In êaf>alsh¿h congregations, the con-tainment of tension was managed by masters who downplayed the sig-nificance of authority claims to the outside, but on the inside upkept allegiance to the spiritual genealogy - which generally found its legiti-misation in the twelve Imams, most notably >Al. The royal component in spiritual authority claims has lessened for Sufi orders - from outward and manifest it has become inward and la-tent - and increased (inversely) for the clerics. This has respectively meant increased and decreased political assertion on the part of the cler-ics and the Sufis. However, the Sufi orders and the state now both em-bodied royal and clerical elements, which brought them face to face, in direct competition for by and large exclusive, spiritual authority. Com-petition resulted not from differences - civil associations demanding a social space of their own from an overbearing, monolithical state - but 52 A citation from chapter 2.: fiThe power of the QuÃb is obviously greater than that of any ruler [....] Salvation in this world and the next depends on obedience to the QuÃb of the time, ›who, in our era, is Sayyid Ma>§ ́m >Al Sh¿hø.

[my insertions].55 The analogous structures of clerical and Sufi spiritual authority have been expressed not only in ideational similarities. One also observes various fundamental resemblances in terms of their organisation. From its invocations of Iranian society, one can deduce that the cleri-cal state has largely conceived of it as an amorphous mass of adepts in need of charismatic, religious leadership. Khomeyni said: fiThe guardi-anship of the Islamic jurist [...] is the same as the appointment of a tutor for minors. The tutelage of the nation regarding responsibility and au-thority does not differ at all from the tutelage of the under-aged.‹56 Some sectors of it were subject to special care: there was subsidised schooling and pilgrimages for martyrsø families, and there were educational and literacy campaigns for tribal areas. However, the revo-lutionary care for the ›disinheritedø was gradually transformed into per-manent and general appeals to the Iranian nationøs Islamic solidarity. Beyond the privilege of any group, the clerical stateøs charismatic elite set out to achieve a permanent mass-mobilisation, for which it made use of popular symbols - the infallible Imams, their gnostic wisdom, mar-tyrdomøs exemplary values, the expectation of the Mahdi - ingrained in Shi>ite-Iranian culture. Whenever there were state-organised political rallies in Tehran, one would read in the newspapers the next day that ›people from all walks of lifeø had participated. Thus, the Islamic Re-public has been aptly analysed in terms of its ›populismø (whether or not 55 CHAH ̇RDAH, 1360/1981-2: 5.

The salvation of these affiliates invariably depended on their following of the masters.59 The êaf>alsh¿h order had many sheikhs, but not any of them under the command of the Board of Trustees. Rather, each sheikh recreated his microcosm of what had once been the ordersø central authority. There were levels of closeness to Monavvar>al-sh¿h, but none of the participants in his gatherings could claim superior religious status. Monavvar>alsh¿h too, although critical of innovations under the Board of Trustees, was moderate in his claims to spiritual au-thority. In the end, all divine spiritual legitimacy was mediated, passed through by êaf>alsh¿h - and through him, referred back to the Imams and the Prophet - to whom Monavvar>alsh¿h and the participants in his gath-ering, in turn, theoretically constituted an amorphous following as well. In order to retain an amorphous following and contain dissent, Ne>matoll¿h leaders had to testify to their (›royalø) might from time to 57 HALLIDAY pointed out the weakness in juxtaposing populism and fundamentalism in Iran (1995: 256-7). ABRAHAMIAN (1993: 17) cites as populismøs features: fiA movement of the propertied middle-class that mobilizes the lower classes, especially the urban poor, with radical rhetoric directed against imperialism, foreign capitalism and the political establishment. In mobilizing the ›common peopleø, populist move-ments use charismatic figures and symbols, imagery, and language that have potent value in the mass culture. Populist movements promise to drastically raise the standard of living and make the country fully independent of outside powers. Even more impor-tant, in attacking the status quo with radical rhetoric, they intentionally stop short of threatening the petty bourgeoisie and the whole principle of private property. Populist movements, thus, inevitably emphasize the importance, not of economic-social revolu-tion, but of cultural, national, and political reconstruction.‹ I have been deliberately selective in my citation as the middle-class element is not relevant to the present dis-cussion, and class in Iran in general and particularly in the 1970s has, in my opinion, been less relevant than fithe specific religious project [...] in the Iranian revolution‹ (that Abrahamian rather neglects, cf.

But they also had to appeal to the affiliates by invoking a popular, Sufi construction of Shi>ite history through which they testified to representational (›cleri-calø) legitimacy. Superseding the power of any contemporary master, the charisma of Sh¿h Ne>matoll¿h Val, the founder of the order, radi-ated through to the present in all Ne>matoll¿h gatherings (maj¿les), and the spiritual chain that traced back his legitimacy to the first Imam, also pointed forwards to the contemporary masters. The size of the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿h order, the variety in its real estate property, the number of its affiliates, and their wide geographical spread, corresponded to hierarchies more complex than the êaf>alsh¿h ones. The qoÃb disposed of three varieties of sheikhs: one ›sheikh of sheikhsø (sheykh ol-mash¿yekh) who shared in many of the masterøs attributes and had the right to install lesser sheikhs; the ›restrictedø (maúd ́d) variety, who were installed at specific places at specific times; and the ›independentø (moÃlaq) ones, who could be detached to any place, at any time.60 These layers of sheikhs in between the master and his affiliates did not, however, attain authority in themselves. The sheikhs had a representative identity, bestowing the masterøs grace on the affiliates, and reproducing their dualism. Sufis in both Ne>matoll¿h orders repeatedly stressed - in a formulation which was politically con-venient but simultaneously ›authenticø to the Sufi ordersø collective con-ceptions of the self - that the affiliates had no particular identity and included ›people from all walks of life.ø In a pre-revolutionary definition of Islamic prayer, >All¿me $ab¿Ãab¿< divided it into the ›canonicalø type (§al¿t), ›supplicationø (do>¿<), ›litanyø (verd) and ›invocationø (`ekr).61 He did not, then, define these in any hierarchy, and he could not have foreseen canonical prayer as a state institution in the Islamic Republic. On banners and wall-paintings in the streets one read: fiprayer is the sun of hearts‹ (nam¿z khvorshd-e delh¿ ast), and fienjoining the good is obligatory like prayer is‹ (amr be ma>r ́f me¢l-e nam¿z v¿jeb ast). In the lodge of êaf>alsh¿h, one obstinate Sufi who thought prayer was unnecessary and felt that all one needed to do was ›thinking of >Alø, was sharply corrected: fiWhen was >Al succesful?‹, he was asked, and then given the answer: fiIt was 60 Interview 9Maj` ́b>alsh¿hK, 05/07/97. 61 In $AB ̇$AB ̇<, 1982: 91.

Nam¿z preceded the Sufi meditations in both of the Ne>matoll¿h orders, circumscribing their encompassing realm of legitimate religiosity. If there was any fundamental unity in these varieties of Islamic prayer, beyond being complementary, it was to be found in their communicative structures. Sufi ceremonies compared to the Friday sessions in that they, too, were hermeneutic exercises in which the right of interpretation was monologically sealed. They featured similar, esoteric interpretations of reality, in a collective endeavour to uncover meaning hidden deeply under the surface of manifest phenomena.63 They read the world for signatures that related it to the holy book, and attributed common pur-pose to instances - such as imperialism and spiritual crisis - at first sight isolated. Collective interpretive efforts had spiritual progress and be-coming better Muslims among their primary aims;64 religious purposes that many Shi>ite Iranians would consider largely interchangeable. More important for the present discussion, amorphous audiences were constructed and rallied through the congregationsø hierarchical features. Both the Friday sermon and the Sufi ceremonies were hierar-chically authoritarian in that they created two largely undifferentiated strata - the faithful and the affiliates versus the prayer leader and the master - the one defined in its attribute of ›followingø to the other. In Tehrani Friday sermons, hierarchy is physically stressed in the speakerøs speaking from a pulpit and his audience being seated on the ground. The Ne>matoll¿h ordersø physical arrangement has both parties seated on the floor, but all affiliates facing their master in the centre. The SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hs visibly marked the masterøs place, while the Board of Trustees was only informally in the centre of attention (see figure 14). One might question the social significance of these spatial orders - they do not necessarily rule out more egalitarian settings - but here, they manifested one aspect of a larger communicative structure. Spatial hier-archies were paralleled in the generic dominance of monologue, which defined the first party through passivity and repetition / listening and silence, and the other by its activity and initiation / speaking and voice. 62 Conversation, 12/01/96. 63 I am here using a definition by FOUCAULT (1994: 29): fiLet us call the totality of the learning and skills that enable one to make the signs speak and to discover their meaning, hermeneutics.‹ 64 Cf.

In a process-oriented, diachronical search, however, one would be able to explore civil societyøs history of emergence and subsequent development. Conceiving of the Iranian civil society as a process, one could make comparative sense of its (re-) ›emergentø character, which has been often observed but also left theoretically unexplored. The following explores two instances in which Shi>ite Sufism meaningfully, though in paradoxical, implicit, passive and informal ways, relates to the Iranian civil society. First, Western public spheres originated from literary and artistic circles and debating clubs, not - immediately - from politically assertive mutual interest groups. An important new strain in Iranian, religious intellectual discourse provides a parallel. Sufism figures passively in it, as a recurrent reference, representing a beacon of legitimate religiosity. Secondly, Western public space, in advance of any full-fledged civil public sphere, was first established in societies which were not only mute and inward looking, but also secretive and closed, and confined to selective memberships. The Ne>matoll¿h Sufi orders have similarly maintained a secluded and shielded religiosity of their own. By implication, this means non-state religiosity, no matter to what extent the orders outwardly accommodated to the public tran-script of state Islam. Through non-state religiosity they confronted, if largely willy-nilly, the stateøs ›colonisation of the lifeworldø. 70 70 Paraphrasing, ›colonisation of the lifeworldø refers to the extension of ›syste-micø economic and bureaucratic criteria to private realms (Lebenswelt refers to fider transzendentale Ort, an dem sich Sprecher und H»rer begegnen; wo sie reziprok den Anspruch erheben k»nnen, da ihre fuerungen mit der Welt (der objektiven, der sozialen oder der subjektiven Welt) zusammenpassen; und wo sie diese Geltungsan-sprÕche kritisieren und besttigen, ihren Dissens austragen und Einverstndnis er-zielen k»nnen‹ (HABERMAS, 1988, (2)), undermining freedom and consensus-based, communicative rationality (op. cit., p. 293, in an argument that begins at p. 273), enforcing systemic assimilation (op. cit., p. 522). The analogy consists in the Islamic Republic having extended its reach over Iranian society and individuals, physically as well as ideologically, further than previous twentieth-century regimes, and in it having conceived of and imposed its regulations exclusively. It is not im-plied, by this historical comparison, that the Iranian, Islamic world as a whole would now be in the developmental stage that Europe was in in the eighteenth century."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"232 CHAPTER SEVEN 1. In his historical study of Western public space, H ABERMAS (1990 [1962]) identified its embryonic forms in advance of any institution-alised, state guaranteed public freedom. Confined, public space was first established in salons, clubs and coffee-houses, partly co-opted by the court, from which developed the associations of citizens that gave shape to the classical, Western civil society. It was public de-bate, beyond the reach of court society, which marked the transition from a ›representativeø public space - the public representation of rule and rulers - into a ›civilø public space - the civiliansø proper realm that won over the public stage. The process is described in the trans-formation of predominantly inward, literary (eighteenth century), into outward, political (nineteenth century) public space. Intellectu-alsø discourse in which Sufism figures as a recurrent reference, repre-sents a similarly inward public space in the process of expansion. The philosopher >Abdolkarm Sor ́sh is one of Iranøs most promi-nent contemporary intellectuals.71 He was educated in Iran and abroad and initially he was a fervent supporter of the revolution and the Islamic Republic. Gradually, however, he came to realise a con-tradiction between his Islamic values and the state that purported to execute these. The Iranian philosophical discourse that Sor ́sh em-bodied, has been pervaded by European categories of thought -through the translation into Persian of Kant and Hegel as much as Heidegger and Foucault - the most important of which for Sor ́sh has been the concept of relativism. He argued that the revelation was sacred, as its meaning remained unchanged in time. But readers were not, hence the need for interpretation.72 Interpretation was a secular matter, for the legitimisation of which no meta-secular arguments were valid (an idea which Sufis too, in various formulations, stressed 71 Another intellectual writing within the jurist community and similarly influ-enced by mysticism, was Mojtahed-Shabestar. fiShabestari differentiates between faith and the religious law, associating faith and the essence of religiosity with religious experience rather than with the religious law (fiqh). In this, he relies on the mystics who have said; ›the human problem is the problem of correct interpretation of religious experience and not the experience itselfø‹ (ALINEJ AD, 1998: 37). 72 Cf. ROULEAU, June 1995. It could be argued that interpretation of the sacred sources is what most of the Shi>ite clerics do anyway. The radically new aspect of the philosopherøs approach - although seemingly much in line with the eighteenth century theological position of the Akhb¿rs - is, however, his extension of the right of interpretation to the religious lay population at large."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"SUFISM, CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE STATE 233 over and again). Sor ́sh concluded there was no justification for any group to monopolise interpretation, and, consequently, state power. Thus, the philosopher attacked exclusivity in the idea of vel¿yat-e faqh: fiSoroush regards religion and mysticism along with science and philosophy as four legitimate modes of attaining knowledge [....] He charged that just as the fatv¿ [...] of a rural jurist differs from that of an urbanite, [...] so the Islam of a philosopher contrasts that of a mystic‹.73 Because of his unabatedly religious perspective, Sor ́sh became a feared critic of the Islamic Republic,74 and in this respect compared to Kant. Just as the latterøs Enlightenment-declaration (›dare to think!ø) found its expression in an ambivalent allegiance to Frederick the Second, so the former subverted through criticism, but is not known to have ever explicitly declared unambiguously ille-gitimate, until Khatamiøs ascent, Khomeyniøs doctrine of jurist rule.75 Sor ́sh developed these ideas in his position as a university lec-turer, and spread his ›thinly disguised call for pluralismø through articles in Kiy¿n magazine.76 These activities attracted the interna-tional mediaøs attention, and he embarked on a series of international lectures. Directly and indirectly, the government took various mea-sures to put a stop to his message. Lectures were cancelled and he was beaten up by îezboll¿hs. Despite being nearly untouchable through his increasingly global renown, he was largely silenced.77 73 BOROUJERDI, 1996: 259, 251, cf. ROULEAU, 06/17/95. 74 Cf. KAZEMI, 1996: 151-2. 75 FOUCAULT (1984: 37) concluded of Was ist Aufklrung: fiAnd Kant, in con-clusion, proposes to Frederick II, in scarcely veiled terms, a sort of contract - what might be called the contract of rational despotism with free reason: the public and free use of autonomous reason will be the best guarantee of obedience, on condition, however, that the political principle that must be obeyed itself be in conformity with universal reason.‹ Cf.

Mystical philosophy was rather associated with Sor ́shøs intel-lectual and political enemies, particularly Reß¿ D¿var, who had carried Corbinøs Heideggerian mysticism to its absolutist extremes.79 As Sufism accommodated itself to regime religiosity through blend-ing its mysticism with a Khomeynist variety of >erf¿n, however, Sor ́sh delved into Islamic mysticism - in as far as its legitimacy was beyond doubt - to argue authentic, decisively non-statist religiosity.80 In a recent interview that has been published on the internet, Sor ́sh explained that fiMy first attempts at interpretation concerned the Koran and an important Sufi text, Mathnavi [....] My continuing contemplation of Rumi made me gradually better acquainted with ences and speeches abroad and that have become termed ›Islamic Lutheranismø, assume a very particular meaning‹ (Khord¿d 8, 1376/May 29, 1997). It was reported that fiIn a July letter published in a newspaper, publisher and writer Abdolkarim Soroush confirmed that he had been banned from leaving the country and that his passport had been confiscated. In November Ansar-e Hezbollah thugs attempted to break up at least one of Soroushøs lectures‹ (U.S. Department of State, Iran Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1997, p. 8). 78 See, for instance, COLEøs (1996) discussion of intellectualsø nationalist dis-course in the Qajar period. He addressed E>tem¿d os-SalÃ¿naøs ›Dreambookø that used dervish imagery to argue against the reformists of his time and in favour of absolute monarchy (op. cit., pp. 51, 53). (Inversely - Sufis arguing reform - fiVol-taire, [...] whose works had not been translated into Persian [in the nineteenth cen-tury], was held in high esteem by some Sufis, who had heard of his anti-clericalism‹ (BAYAT, 1982: 62)). ALINEJ AD (1998: 3) emphasised the fimeaningful function of the new interpretations of Iranian-Islamic philosophical and mystical traditions in building new political imaginaries.‹ In these traditions, he felt (as did Sor ́sh), lay the roots of current trends towards democracy and pluralism (op. cit., p. 5).

BOROUJERDIøs eye-opener review of post-revolution intellectual debate (1994: 247). 80 Mysticism had been an important theme from his earliest book, ›The Restless Structure of the Universeø (Nah¿d-e n¿-¿r¿m-e jah¿n), in which fithe author aligns himself with the mystical Shi>i school of illumination (eshr¿q), and particularly with its great seventeenth-century exponent [...] Molla Sadra [....] Sorushøs strong mysti-cal tendency can be shown in the conceptual structure of his various arguments, as well as by the simple fact that the most frequently and approvingly cited reference in his writings and lectures is the great mystic poet Jalal al-Din Rumi‹ (MATIN-ASGARI, 1997: 100-1, 102, cf. various references in this chapter)."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"SUFISM, CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE STATE 235 Sufism.‹ In another passage, he mentioned fia memorable trip [to] the desert town of Gonabad.

The inter-view was held on May 3, 1999. I found fiIntellectual Autobiography: An Interview‹ on http://www.seraj.org/ (10/31/99), a website dedicated to Sor ́sh. The interviewer was fiSadri‹, but other details are unknown. 82 Taúll-e mafh ́m-e úok ́mat-e dn, 1375/1996: 7. Although Sor ́sh was am-bivalent or sometimes negative towards Sufism, overall his tone was positive (espe-cially in êer¿th¿-ye mostaqm: sokhan dar pl ́r¿lsm; mo¢bat va manf, 1376/1997). In his treatment of Moúammad al-Ghazzal, R ́m and î¿feˆ he stressed their en-mity towards Sufism (Qe§§e-ye arb¿b-e ma>refat, 1375/1996: 6, 7, 26, 59-61, 257). However, in the same publication he told, in an inverse appreciation, that fithe im-portant lesson of Sufism is abstention from power and wealth, to refrain from sin‹ (1375/1996: 268). In ›Confused Consciousness, Confused Identityø (~ehnyat-e moshavvash, hovyat-e moshavvash, in Kiy¿n, 1996, 6, (30): 4-9), he ficonceded that by its very nature [...] ta§avvof leads to fatalistic thinking [...] and perplexity [...], traits that breed irrationality and confusion in Iranian culture‹ (MATIN-ASGARI, 1997: 103). In Akhl¿q, zb¿-shen¿s va >erf¿n (1375/1997: 17), however, Sor ́sh associated beauty with proximity to God, and proximity to God with Sufis. 83 Taúll-e mafh ́m-e úok ́mat-e dn, 1375/1996: 2. SHAYEGAN writes (1997), in what must be a reference to Sor ́sh, of distortions in the Westernised Islamic epis-teme, that it fiis quite capable of mixing eschatology with, for example, positivism. The product of such combinations is always a hybrid which can only be made to fit together by grafting‹ (op. cit., p. 73). Ironically, similar grafting was employed by fiall kinds of converts: German fundamentalists, British Sufis, meticulously consci-entious Swiss Muslims, French dabblers in ›a nice class of Islam, rich in cultural appealø‹ (op. cit., p. 74). Although one may agree with Shayegan that fito match two notions which belong to different constellations of ideas, kept apart by the great historical caesuras on which modernity is founded, is to attempt a chain of identifi-cation and misread the genealogy of the concepts‹ (op. cit., p. 27), the attempts live a life of their own, and thus constitute an object for social science. 84 There were fewer inhibitions in lesser figures.

As the Islamic Republic politicised mysticism, Sor ́sh gave Mowl¿n¿ an inverse political reading: fiOur [...] mystics [...] have [...] taught us that one can attain freedom in the shadow of religion‹, he stated, and fiMowlav comprehends the aim of ›prophecyø precisely in this founding of freedom for believers and supporters of religion.‹85 The teachings of Sufi mystics, Sor ́sh felt, had been a reaction not only to monarchist ethics but also, more gen-erally, to despotic ethics, predominant in Iranian, Islamic history.86 Under Sor ́shøs hermeneutic reasoning that strove to define the basis for textual authority and religiosity, lay a fundamental, onto-logical discussion that dealt with the essence of man: fiOur mystics have spoken about nothing but man. Sufism and >erf¿n are, funda-mentally, anthropology. The mystics have said that man is the em-bodiment of the overarching name of God.‹87 From this inclusive conception of mankind, it followed that fimystics such as Mowlav [...] knew the ›fight between the believer, the unbeliever and the Jewø to occur [only] as a consequence of conflicting perspectives‹, and that they had fiin an insightful and wise manner laid the firm founda-tion for an honest and just pluralism.‹88 One of the ways in which in Persian about >Erf¿n and Sufismø [my emphasis].

ROULEAUøs citation of Sor ́sh (06/17/95): fithe Islamic state can only be justified if it is democratic and humanistic‹ must not be mistaken for secularism, but be seen as a strictly religious view. The year in which Sor ́sh published Dn va ¿z¿d (1996), there was also a round table on ›religion and freedomø at Tehran University (ADELKHAH, 1997: 17). 88 Dn va ¿z¿d, 1375/1996: 47. In winter 1997, N¿me-ye farhang (24) published a ›forum on pluralism and cultureø that was presided over by Reß¿ D¿var. îojjat ol-Esl¿m Rash¿d recognised mysticism, just as Sor ́sh did, as an Islamic basis for pluralism (op. cit., p. 5, English introduction). D¿varøs evaluation, contrary to that of Sor ́sh, was decisively negative: fibecause of the confusion of the language and ambiguity of the concepts and interpretations, some of the pious believers have defended pluralism [....] Pluralism is not a religious or theological issue, and in theological and >erf¿n introductions to its explication, it is in reality a kind of politi-cal exploitation‹ (op. cit., p. 3, English; p. 13, Persian text). The views of D¿var are in line with those of the Western relativists in the civil society debate, who posi-tively reckon that fiSome societies may reject modern western notions of what is intrinsically good, as when a Brahmin rejects equality and upholds the hierarchy of"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"SUFISM, CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE STATE 237 pluralism became manifest, was in the diversity of religious explica-tion and experience, which Sor ́sh considered ›our Sufisø to represent in words and action.89 Mysticism, then, embodied Islamic pluralism. As many Iranian critics of the Islamic Republic did, Sor ́sh main-tained that he took no political positions at all, and stated emphati-cally that fimystical theories must not be established as the basis for political thought, because this unusual practice is dangerous.‹90 Habermas observed of Western equivalents: fiDer kritische Proze, den die »ffentlich rsonierenden Privatleute gegen die absolutistische Herrschaft anstrengen, versteht sich selbst als unpolitisch.‹91 So-r ́shøs mystical demand for a ›society of lawø (j¿me>e-ye úoq ́q), an allegedly unpolitical plea, was an important political event as it tran-scended Henry Corbinøs traditionally narrow conception of >erf¿n beyond and isolated from any ›Code Civilø.92 In this way, through its denial and claims to the opposite, Sufism discursively transformed into Sor ́shøs oppositional defence of (religious) civility. 2. Until the end of the eighteenth century, Western proto-civilians faced a ›representative public spaceø, which was filled with the emblems, gestures and rhetoric of rule and rulers. As long as this rhetoric and these emblems and gestures remained the sole occupant of the public space, there could be no full-fledged civil society. caste, or a Mollah defends the sacred truths of Islam against secular pluralism‹ (HANN, 1996: 18). However, interestingly, it is the enemies who cite from the Western tradition as well. Transcending the East-West divide, êobú cited Weber and D¿var found solace in Heidegger. 89 êeraÃh¿-ye mostaqm: sokhan dar pl ́r¿lsm; mo¢bat va manf, 1376/1997: 4. In a London lecture, Sor ́sh stated that: fiSufis empty themselves so that Truths may radiate in them‹ (Kiy¿n, 1997, 34, (6): 58). In a 1992 critique of post-modernism, Sor ́sh paradoxically defended mysticism as a solution for ›manøs uncertainty and self-consciousnessø (MATIN-ASGARI, 1997: 103). 90 Dn va ¿z¿d, 1375/1996: 51. One finds ambivalence not only in the incongru-ity of Sor ́shøs discourse and practice, but also in the fact that he reproaches Sufism for zohd while it is with the voice of this very, traditionalist and quietist >erf¿n that Sor ́sh speaks in the above citation. In the above lecture Sor ́sh played a dangerous game by associating vel¿yat as a mystical concept with Sufism, suggesting an alter-native conception for the feqh and dony¿v varieties of vel¿yat-e faqh. 91 HABERMAS, 1990: 178. 92 ALINEJAD (1998: 13) rightly remarked that thinkers such as Sor ́sh engaged in ficonstant flirtations with politics.‹"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"238 CHAPTER SEVEN Nevertheless, civil public space was established within the con-fines of closed societies. Habermas mentioned Freemasonry and illuminationist societies - secretive as much as Iranian, Islamic Suf-ism - as examples.93 He illustrated their dialectical relation to the representative public space as follows: fiDie Beschrnkung der }ffentlichkeit, meint Kant mit dem Blick auf die damals heiumstrittenen Freimaurerlogen, sei KKdie veranlassende Ursache 94aller geheimen Gesellschaften99‹. Thus, the common European phenomenon of Freemasonry was fias old as civil society itself, if civil society as a whole was not just an outgrowth of Freemasonry.‹95 This points to a paradox in civility, which describes open, non-primordial interaction, resembling what Habermas in a different context outlined as the ›ideal speech situationø - free of distorting sys-tem constraints - but which has nevertheless, in Western European countries, been constituted through one of its opposites: secrecy. In Habermasøs argument, the question of public space was closely related to a widening scope for rationality. It was rational communi-cation that needed the protection of secrecy, as rational commu-nication threatened self-explanatory sovereignty. Thus, fiSolange die Publizitt ihren Sitz in der fÕrstlichen Geheimkanzlei hat, kann sich Vernunft nicht unvermittelt offenbaren. Ihre }ffentlichkeit ist noch auf Geheimhaltung angewiesen, ihr Publikum bleibt [...] intern.‹96 However, one suspects the more crucial element in civil society to have been not rational communication, but the threat that its inde-pendence posed.97 The crucial element in eighteenth-century contes-93 HABERMAS, 1990: 96, 58-67, 14: fifreimaurerischen Geheimbünde und Illumi-natenorden waren Assozationen, die sich durch die freien, d.h. privaten Entscheidungen ihrer Gründungsmitglieder konstituierten, aus freiwilligen Mit-gliedern rekrutierten und im Innern egalitäre Verkehrsformen, Diskussionsfreiheit, Majoritätsentscheidungen usw. praktizierten. In diesen gewiß noch bürgerlich ex-klusiv zusammengesetzten Sozietäten konnten die politischen Gleichheitsnormen einer künftigen Gesellschaft eingeübt werden.‹ The one conceptual doubt in these examples concerns the equality of communication. Freemasonry and illuminationist societies were, in Europe as in Iran, characterised by organisational hierarchy and (at least in Iran) charismatic leadership. Equality was an attribute of inter-stratum communication, as among the undifferentiated mords. 94 HABERMAS, 1990: 184. 95 HABERMAS, 1990: 96. 96 HABERMAS, 1990: 96. 97 If rationality is conceived of as more than economic or organisational effi-ciency, i.e. as behaviour and thought which is guided by reason, to the exclusion of"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"SUFISM, CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE STATE 239 tations of public space, was the ›bÕrgerliche Dialektik von Innerlich-keit und }ffentlichkeit.ø Facing a representative public space, it had to emerge and be constituted as a secret public space.98 This paradox of civility has also operated in the mystic regimes, in their relations to the Islamic Republicøs waning, representative public space. The Ne>matoll¿h orders were not all fora for rational, civilian dialogue. One Sufi said: fiWhen a thief enters a house, the first thing he does is turn out the light. Love (>eshq) is such as thief, with re-spect to reason (>aql). What we do here is wage a ›war of loveø (jang-e >eshq) to annihilate that which cools down >eshq, which is to say >aql‹.99 While many other Sufis would disagree and assign a central place to >aql, as demands Shi>ite doctrine, no Sufi felt that it was ›mystic reasonø that faced an over-bearing state. It has been as inde-pendent bearers of a religiosity of their own, that Iranian Sufis have countered, if largely willy-nilly, their lifeworldøs colonisation. Countering colonisation: rules and their performance Reflecting on current circumstances in Iran, one Sufi stated: fiWe are now where all started, with individuals and small groups, without formal organisation.‹ An ›actual Sufismø had now rejoined the ›essential Sufismø. It reminded of Corbinøs invocation of the sixth imam: fiLøIslam a commenc¡ expatri¡ et redeviendra expatri¡. Bien-heureux les expatri¡s!‹100 Sufismøs basic social dilemma had always reflected tension between the actual and the essential states: fiSufism is about religious experience, not about social organisation. But without social organisation, religious experience is obstructed by enemies. All organisation corrupts, but without it Sufism would be destroyed as well.‹101 Others felt contempt for the last part of the equation, and cited the histories of Sufi martyrs fiwho were way be-yond caring about their bodily survival.‹102 Both the realist and the any other source of knowledge, then it is doubtful if rite-ridden Freemasonry ever fitted the criterion of rationality. 98HABERMAS, 1990: 17, 99. 99 Interview, 02/21/97. 100 CORBIN, 1971, (1): 33. The saying actually stems from the Prophet (MEIER, 1992, (4): 105). 101 Another observer similarly reflected: fiSufi groups have split in tens and tens. They donøt bureaucratise.

Now it was reaching a return to its original, essential self, in contrary circumstances, in the preordained shape of a full circle.103 fiThere are no preconditions to love in the kh¿naq¿h‹, Sor ́sh wrote, moulding Sufism into a pluralist political agenda.104 But lodge life has been as regulated in the Islamic Republic as it was in the Pah-lavi dynasty, bearing temporally distinct relations to state and jurist regimes. Historical charters of Sufi ›orderø have been laid down in rules, and Sufismøs fisanctity of rule [...] means in practice the pres-ervation and perpetuation of the adab (decorum or discipline).‹105 Persistent political concerns provide a context for the universality of Sufi rules. Sufismøs repression was often followed by internal reforms in Sufi assemblies, which increased the number, severity and reach of rules. The killing of îall¿j was among the reasons for the development of Sufi manuals that contained guidelines for the right teachings - the outstanding historical exemplar.106 103 The circle has been a beloved metaphor for idealists of all times and places. In the above statement, there is a resemblance to Platoøs Pure Ideas, which become polluted through earthly matter. The British poet Kathleen RAINE in Nasrøs Sophia Perennis referred to Plotinusø aesthetics: fiA circle is a circle whether it be drawn in ink or chalk or inscribed on the stone of new Grange or the turf of Stonehenge; and [it] is neither ›the ink on the pageø nor the ›construction in spaceø‹ (1977: 57). 104 êeraÃh¿-ye mostaqm: sokhan dar pl ́r¿lsm; mo¢bat va manf, 1376/1997: 7. 105 MCGREGOR, 1997: 261; cf.

EICKELMAN stated: fithere is an ›essential loosenessø [...] about Islamic religious organization, which means that it is much more responsive to local social contexts then has often been the case in Christianity‹ (1981: 293). ›Essential loosenessø is contradicted by the rule-led nature of Ne>matoll¿h Sufism. The rules have, however, made Ne>matoll¿hs flexible with regard to (lateral) jurist and (vertical) state political contexts. 106 Abu<n-Najb as-Sohravardøs (d. 1168) ̇d¿b al-murdn and Ab ́ îaf§ as-Soh-ravardøs (d. 1234) >Aw¿rif al-ma>¿rif are among the most important ¿d¿b-treatises (Cf.

Thus, both figuratively and literally, ›ruleø and ›orderø have been intimately related, and this relation had a rationale in concerns for survival. The twentieth-century î¿midya Sh¿Äilya order in Egypt survived through rules. Facing jurists, rulers and a modernising society, its leader charted an intricate system of ›lawsø that in turn modernised the order. This made it hard on anyone to denounce it as traditional or heretic, its organisation sharing in the modernity of governmental institutions, its teachings being directed towards the Islamic law.107 On top of the occasional jurist attack, twentieth-century Kh¿ks¿r Sufis were perse-cuted by Reza Shah, and the order responded, similarly, by organisa-tional reforms which enhanced the Kh¿ks¿r Sufisø lasting survival. In the Ne>matoll¿h regimes, tacit and written rules have enhanced both secrecy and the reproduction of order (which were, in turn, related). Rules have regulated interaction in and outside the lodge into levels of formality and proximity, i.e. distributing discourse and practice along a scale of external-formal, internal-formal, external-informal and internal-informal components. These historically articulated distributions, which corresponded to differentiated Sufi ›levels of teachingø,108 aided integration into the Pahlavi dynasty and accommodation vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic. The rules of Reß¿>alsh¿h were beneficial to the SolÃ¿n>alsh¿hsø civil and reli-gious integration under the Shah, while in the Islamic Republic, rules enhanced accommodation to regime religiosity in the lodge of üahr od-Dowle. In either case, the rules protected the internal and infor-mal spheres, the esoteric core of which has consisted of friendship 107 GILSENAN, 1973 (Saint and Sufi in Modern Egypt). 108 Cf. KEDDIE, 1963: 34. Formality/informality differentiation in discourse has been theorised by IRVINE (1979), and, in relation to ¿d¿b, by GILSENAN (1973, 1982). GRAMLICH testified to the rule-led nature of Ne>matoll¿h ceremony in the Pahlavi era. There were fiRegeln über Essen und Trinken, Fasten und Fastenbrechen, Gesundsein und Kranksein, Reisen und Daheimsein, Eintreffen und Abschiedneh-men, Alleinsein und Beisammensein, Reden und Schweigen, Umgang mit Höherg-estellten [...] und Untergebenen, dazu Normen für anständiges Sitzen, Blicken, Niesen, Husten, Naseputzen, wie man die Schuhe anzieht und auszieht, wie man sein Bündel packt und auspackt, anschnallt und abschnallt, wann der Kopf bedeckt sein soll and wann nicht, wann man Grüßen soll und wann nicht und dergleichen mehr‹ (1981, Vorwort)."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"SUFISM, CIVIL SOCIETY AND THE STATE 243 with God/guidance (val¿yat).109 The claims and proofs of friendship with God were not carried outside the lodge for public display, and val¿yat - belonging to the innermost realm of experience where God took over - ultimately breached any formality. ̇d¿b circumscribe three interrelated realms of cultivated inner states, moderated outer behaviour and a disciplined learning of the features of the Sufi path.110 Regarding their proper, political function-ality, ¿d¿b do not easily compare to civilit¡, in definitions laid down in the manual books of the European Middle Ages and Renais-sance.111 In European court-settings, the rationale of etiquette con-sisted primarily of safeguarding internal cohesion and the integration of nobles.

The component of reproduction which was external (i.e. not primarily having to do with the affiliates, their initiation, with liturgy or the lodge) and informal (i.e. not being circumscribed in or de-rivative from any Sufi rule, despite being very common and offering legitimisation) consisted of public relations to people in high places. 109 Protection of an esoteric core characterises most orders. ›Listeningø (sam¿>) among the Kh¿ks¿r was a carefully kept secret (serr) only entrusted to those on higher stages of initiation into the orderøs hierarchy (GRAMLICH, 1981: 63).

But exceptions aside, the value of universalism - which is a religious and a psychologi-cal concept in Sufism - is hardly ever laboured unto a practical theory of pluralism, on the social plane, and with respect to concrete others who share a common social space.

For these reasons and others -such as primordial structures in internal relations and unabated state affiliation externally - the orders have not been a part of the associa-tional life of civil society as it has been classically understood. How-ever, secrecy and inward, internal audiences also characterised Western civil societies, when these were faced with an overbearing, representative public space. Because of its proper institutional life, providing spiritual masters, liturgy and lodges, Sufism testified to a religiosity of its own, no matter how much it accommodated to re-gime religiosity. In its master-disciple relations, it resembled spiri-tual authority as embodied in the state. Public space was claimed in a monopolistic fashion by the state, and the mystic regimes needed shielding against it, for them to retain a religiosity of their own.
