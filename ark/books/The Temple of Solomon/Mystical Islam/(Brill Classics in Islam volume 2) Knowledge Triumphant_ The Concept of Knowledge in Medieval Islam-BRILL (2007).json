A first report was presented to the Twenty-Fifth International Congress of Orientalists in Moscow in August 1960 in the form of a brief paper. Its substance was published in the Proceedings of the Congress, II, 62 f. (Moscow 1962–63; Index, Moscow 1964). A preliminary treatment of the definitions of knowledge (Chapter IV) was contributed to a symposium, held at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, in the spring of 1965, on “The Conflict of Traditionalism and Modernism in the Muslim Middle East.” It was published in a volume of this title edited by C. Leiden, which appeared in 1969 (1966), 117–33.My great indebtedness to the many libraries which put their manuscript treasures at my disposal will become clear from the citations in the footnotes. A fellowship grant from the American Research Institute in Turkey (ARIT) enabled me to spend six weeks in Turkey in the spring of 1967, which were used for research in the libraries of Istanbul, Manisa, Edirne, and Bursa. This helped to round out previous research undertaken abroad, made possible mainly by the generous policy of Yale University with respect to Sabbatical leaves.Attention may be called here to the Index and the way it has been utilized for simplified reference. Full bibliographical data are indicated in the body of the book at first occurrences only. Thereafter, abridged forms of reference are usually employed, most of which will be clear by themselves.

Franz Rosenthal’s Knowledge Triumphant easily falls into this category, even when one considers the author’s remarkable career and prodigious scholarly output.Born and educated in Berlin, Franz Rosenthal (1914-2003) studied classics and oriental languages at the university in his home town at a time when German scholarship in the humanities had reached its apogee. His precocity matched the exacting standards of his renowned professors and he received his doctorate in 1935 with a dissertation on Palmyrenian inscriptions, which was soon (1938) followed by his classic history of Aramaic studies, for which he received the Lidzbarski Medal. He left Germany at the end of 1938 and came to the United States in 1940, where he taught first at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati and then at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1956 he moved to Yale University where he taught, as Sterling Professor of Arabic and Semitic Studies, until his retirement in 1985.Franz Rosenthal’s scholarly work is extensive and covers most aspects of Arabic and Islamic studies and Semitic studies.1 He was a consummate philologist in a number of languages, and especially in Arabic and Aramaic,2 though much as he prized philology, he viewed it as the handmaiden of historical and cultural studies. Trained in an age when oriental studies had not developed narrow specialization in the various disciplines, he used the philological method to study and write about all aspects of Islamic history—intellectual, social, and political. He produced pioneering andclassic works on such varied subjects as 1 A bibliography of Rosenthal’s writings was published in the third Variorum collection of his articles, Science and Medicine in Islam (Aldershot 1990), ix–xxvii, and, in a more complete form, in Oriens36 (2001) xiii–xxxiv. For more information on some of the details in this Introduction see my biographical memoir in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 149 (2005) 442 –446.2 On which he wrote the two classic textbooks in use to this very day, A Grammar of Biblical Aramaic (1961) andAn Aramaic Handbook (1967).rosenthal_x-xiv.inddxi10/17/20062:10:09PM"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"xiiintroductionGraeco-Arabic studies,3 Islamic history and historiography,4 the history of Arabic philology,5 literature and art history,6 and most importantly, Islamic social history, in a series of publications on a project close to his heart which he called “Man versus society in Islam.”7 In all this his approach was neither dogmatic nor moralizing but, as he himself put it, “to let the sources speak for themselves and to avoid subjective interpretation.”8This orientalist approach, though perhaps justifiably impugned for its misapplications, in its proper and most productive form, as consummately practiced by Rosenthal, is particularly apt for the study of medieval Islamic civilization. The scholars and thinkers who left us their writings upon which we base our knowledge of that civilization were themselves not narrow specialists but polymaths, experts in various intellectual fields; to grasp the full range of their reach one has to command an equally vast body of knowledges. It is therefore no accident that one of Rosenthal’s masterpieces is his annotated translation of Ibn aldÖn’s Introduction (Muqaddima),ƬƵʦvƣȀƳƣȜƧɛ and unlikely to be surpassed;9 fully to understand thatmasterpiece one has to acquire the knowledge of all aspects of Islamic civilization that Ibn aldÖn had.All these characteristics of Rosenthal’s work come together in the present work, on a subject that is as multifaceted as it is original. 3 See his valuable anthology The Classical Heritage in Islam (original German version 1965, English translation 1975), and the collection of articles in the second Variorum volume, Greek Philosophy in the Arab World (Aldershot 1990).4 Equally as significant as his History of Muslim Historiography (1952, second edition 1968) are his translations of the first and last volume of abarÒ’s History, together with the study of abari’s life and work in the introduction of the first volume.5 Unparalleled to this day remains his Technique and Approach of Muslim Scholarship(1947), which itself ought to be reprinted.6 See the articles collected in Four Essays on Art and Literature in Islam (1971).7 Rosenthal announced the project, with this title, in the first volume in the series, The Muslim Concept of Freedom (1960), p. viii. Other studies include The Herb (1971) andGambling in Islam (1975), and some of the articles collected in the first Variorum collection,Muslim Intellectual and Social History (Aldershot 1990).8 Characteristic, though, of both his scholarly integrity and his deep understanding of the contextuality of the author and the complex relationship between him and his subject, is his immediate qualification of this statement, “This, admittedly, is possible only to a limited degree;” foreword to the first Variorum collection mentioned in the preceding note, p. ix.9 The latest translator of the Muqaddima into French (2002), the Moroccan thinker and historian Abdesselam Cheddadi, pays homage to Rosenthal’s “vaste érudition” in hisActualité d’Ibn KhaldÖn (Témara, Morocco, 2006, p. 234). The Greek is Thucydides’ description of the purpose for which he wrote his own History: as “a possession [to be had] forever.”rosenthal_x-xiv.inddxii10/17/20062:10:09PM"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"inttroduction  xiii“Civilizations tend to revolve around meaningful concepts of an abstract nature which more than anything else give them their distinctive nature,” Rosenthal begins his study, introducing his subject; this concept is, for Islamic civilization, knowledge, {\u0003ilm. The audacity of the undertaking is stunning; because, in essence, I regard Knowledge Triumphant as Rosenthal’s response to Ibn aldÖn’s Muqaddima: the latter aimed at describing and analyzing the motor of world history, or actually, Islamic history; Rosenthal responded by claiming to have identified knowledge as the quickening concept in Islamic civilization and proceeded to study it in great detail, without for a moment lapsing, just like his great predecessor, in meaningless generalizations. It is therefore instructive to observe how he structured the book by taking each relevant subject in succession: Êhiliyya studies with comparative Semitics, Qur’Ênic studies, kalÊmand other religious sciences, ÂÖfism, philosophy and Graeco-Arabic studies, culminating in his favorite subject, social history. Each one of these chapters could have been by itself subject for a monograph; such a monograph, though, would have been incomplete because it would reflect but a segment of the organic whole of medieval Islamic civilization with reference to the unifying theme of knowledge. As it is, each segment gains meaning not independently but from juxtaposition with the next, and leads to the cumulative effect of substantiating the author’s initial thesis. Readers with sundry interests will find in the several chapters insightful discussions of their field of specialization documented with a large mass of source material awaiting further analysis and study—as will graduate students subjects for untold dissertations. Merely as examples of some of the many gems in the book I would like to direct attention to the extreme reserve and circumspection with which comparative Semitic material is used to describe the pre-Islamic situation in Arabia (ch. I), the inimitable little chapter on the plural of knowledge (ch. III, in conscious reference to which I used the word “knowledges” in the plural above), the translation of the introductory sections from the AbkÊr al-afkÊr by al-¹midÒ, a very significant author the study of whose non-legal thought has been unduly neglected in Western Islamic studies (ch. VII,3), and the uncommonly pithy last chapter on knowledge and society, which, with its sections on the personal failings of scholars and on knowledge in its relation to money and power (ch. VIII,4) constitutes part and parcel of Rosenthal’s larger project on “Man versus society in Islam.” Classical orientalism, of whose heroic—and final—stage Rosenthal was the most brilliant representative, was a discipline that in its best rosenthal_x-xiv.inddxiii10/17/20062:10:09PM"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"xivintroductionmoments encouraged asking such fundamental and seemingly essentializ-ing questions about civilizations, but it also provided the requisite method, control, and tools to answer them.

Such concepts are to be found at the very beginning of a rising civilization. Or they may signalize, when they \u0002rst make their appear-ance, an entirely new departure toward the eventual transformation of the environment hospitable to them. In the course of time, they may undergo changes of tone and of volume. Such changes may be minor and merely serve to strengthen the hold exercised by the concepts before. But they also may provide the old concepts with new meanings. This signi\u0002es a fundamental change or a major break in the structure of the civilization in which it happens. The concepts as such may continue to be used, thereby obscuring the meaning and depth of the change or even totally hiding the very fact of its existence. If, on the other hand, they cease to be used in any meaningful manner, it is a clear indication that the civi-lization which lived by them is no longer fully alive.Being an integral and intimate part of their particular civilization which was molded as it were to their speci\u0002cations, such concepts pres-ent members of other civilizations with great dif\u0002culties in the way of achieving a correct understanding and appreciation of them. Anything lying outside one’s own experience cannot be comprehended in its true dimensions. Verbalization runs up against a powerful barrier. It is impossible to \u0002nd words in other languages that come close to the fullness of meaning conveyed by the original term. “The tremendous symbolic signi\u0002cance of linguistic phenomena”1 is no doubt a reality. Yet, it should not be altogether impossible to interpret important linguistic phenomena sensibly and without too great a distortion of their conceptual power. Fortunately, there is comparatively little danger of distorting the signi\u0002-cance of the concept of \u0002ilm in Islam.Arabic \u0002ilm is fairly well rendered by our “knowledge”. However, “knowledge” falls short of expressing all the factual and emotional 1 In connection with the alleged lack of a word for “space” (Raum) in Greek, this was said by O. Spengler, Der Untergang des Abendlandes, I, 120 (Munich 1920).rosenthal_f2_1-4.indd Sec1:110/17/2006 2:13:23 PM"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2 introductioncontents of \u0002ilm. For \u0002ilm is one of those concepts that have dominated Islam and given Muslim civilization its distinctive shape and com-plexion. In fact, there is no other concept that has been operative as a determinant of Muslim civilization in all its aspects to the same extent as \u0002ilm. This holds good even for the most powerful among the terms of Muslim religious life such as, for instance, taw\u0003îd “recognition of the oneness of God,” ad-dîn “the true religion”, and many others that are used constantly and emphatically. None of them equals \u0002ilm in depth of meaning and wide incidence of use. There is no branch of Muslim intellectual life, of Muslim religious and political life, and of the daily life of the average Muslim that remained untouched by the all-pervasive attitude toward “knowledge” as something of supreme value for Muslim being. \u0002Ilm is Islam, even if the theologians have been hesitant to accept the technical correctness of this equation. The very fact of their pas-sionate discussion of the concept attests to its fundamental importance for Islam.How this came about, how it continued to develop and grow, and what it meant historically—all this constitutes the proper subject of the following pages. Obviously, it is an extremely vast subject, dealing as it does with something talked and written about by uncounted people distributed over a large part of the globe in the course of many centuries. The relevant information had to be collected from many places. The material is plentiful, yet dif\u0002-cult to grasp and to penetrate. There are many areas where we have more material than would seem necessary. There are others for which we would wish to have more. There also is a constant temp-tation and, indeed, a seeming need to expand the immediate con\u0002nes of our theme and to include the entire realm of intellectual percep-tion and speculation, or, at least, a large part of it. It might easily be said that the subject of \u0002ilm in its totality is too vast for any comprehensive treatment and that it would have been better to restrict the investigation to the one or other facet of it. Nobody, certainly not this writer, would consider this an unjust suggestion. Happily, some, if very few, monographs on particular segments of the subject do exist. Many more will have to be written in the future. However, it certainly seems to serve a useful purpose to call attention, in one volume, to the multitude of important problems that call for their solutions. It can do no harm to highlight the very real importance of the concept as a rosenthal_f2_1-4.indd Sec1:210/17/2006 2:13:23 PM"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":" inttroduction 3whole by studying, however brie\u0003y and rapidly, many of its major implica-tions. The reader must not expect to \u0002nd a full discussion of details or a review of all the available literature. Specimens must suf\u0002ce to provide a substantial frame-work. Further bits and chunks of material can always be \u0002tted into it as the need arises.I have spent what I feel to be reasonable efforts to gain access to the primary literature. Many gaps remain which ought to be \u0002lled before a clear historical picture will emerge. Much of the oldest stage is lost, probably for ever. Only a small percentage of the later sources exists in print. The work of an important author may be preserved, or be accessible, only in part, while it ought to be known and studied to its full extent, in order to gain a correct appreciation of his position. In some cases, manuscripts had to be used, although printed texts do exist. Often, it was necessary to do without potentially important material known to exist but inaccessible. Everybody working in any \u0002eld of Islamic studies is familiar with these and similar technical dif\u0002culties.In connection with the present work, I had to contend with a more formidable handicap. Any historical problem must be viewed from a modern vantage point, resulting from the author’s understanding of the state of the problem in his own time and cultural environment. A vast amount of thought has gone into the problem of knowledge in the modern West. The great discussion of the earlier years, par-ticularly the seventeenth century, may be pro\u0002tably compared and contrasted with what we \u0002nd in the Muslim world. This has been con-sidered outside the scope of the present work. However, I am also not prepared to claim that my reading has provided me with suf\u0002cient clar-ity as to what might constitute an acceptable modern position, a sort of rough and, perhaps, super\u0002cial but widely agreed upon understanding of the fundamental implications, with regard to the basic character and the multiple aspects of “knowledge.” I can only hope that the result-ing feeling of discomfort and uncertainty which has been bothering me all those years I have been working on the subject has not affected the inner core of my argumentation.The eternal problem of translation shows itself here at its most intractable. Every term translated is a term distorted, no matter how much care has been spent on \u0002nding the most suitable English equivalent. For one, the English terms themselves are by no means unequivocal. They may suggest different conceptions to different rosenthal_f2_1-4.indd Sec1:310/17/2006 2:13:23 PM"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"4 introductionpeople. But then, the Arabic terms, too, are never unequivocal. The distinctions among them—all, as a rule, very subtle in nature—were not always observed with suf\u0002cient precision, even by writers aware of the technical intricacies of the choice of terms. It was possible for the same author to adhere strictly to technical terminology in one place, and make loose use of the same term in another. The terms \u0002ilm and ma\u0002rifah, for instance, could be used as plain synonyms. They were also differen-tiated enough to be used for de\u0002ning each other. They could be treated as contrary and almost mutually exclusive concepts of mental activity. Or they could designate quite different and clearly de\u0002ned subject matters. Various English terms can be used to translate them, but wher-ever this is done, the coherence created by terminology, which is strongly felt in Arabic, is severed. An additional problem in the particular case of \u0002ilm and ma\u0002rifah is peculiar to English which does not share with French or German the distinction between savoir-connaître or wissen-ken-nen which often approximates the one that exists between the two Arabic roots. Except using the untranslated Arabic terms or adding them in strategic positions wherever deemed necessary or making some arti\u0002cial and potentially misleading distinction in translation between “knowl-edge” and “cognition,” “knowledge” and “gnosis,” “knowledge of ” and “knowledge about” or the like, as has been inconsistently attempted in the following pages, not much can be done about this situation. The realm of abstract speculation, which is the foundation of all higher civilization, is a realm of terms, without which the human mind cannot operate. Transference from one language to another always dis-turbs unique thought patterns. It can lead at best to approximations. The realization of these facts is, perhaps, the master key to the under-standing of our subject.rosenthal_f2_1-4.indd Sec1:410/17/2006 2:13:24 PM"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONETHE KNOWLEDGE BEFORE KNOWLEDGEOur information on pre-Islamic Arabia, especially with regard to the intellectual level achieved in the central portion of the peninsula, remains very limited. Newly found material and a deepened and con-centrated study of the available evidence have not changed, unfortu-nately, the general validity of this statement. As a rule, we have to be satis\u0002ed with inferences drawn from meager and often dubious data. We cannot be quite sure concerning the character and extent of the vocabulary employed for intellectual perception, much less so about the exact use to which this vocabulary was put.1 The poetry believed to be pre-Islamic is our only serviceable source. We may, however, assume that the vocabulary of the Qur\u0002ân re\u0003ects an earlier situation with a considerable degree of accuracy, except where it can be shown that old words were \u0002lled with subtly changed meanings or that new words were borrowed or coined. It also seems a rather safe assumption that, if there are basic roots not attested in either pre-Islamic poetry or the Qur\u0002ân, they did exist in pre-Islamic usage. Altogether, we can be assured of the existence in pre-Islamic Arabia of an extensive and re\u0002ned vocabulary for the expression of a variety of mental activities.A Semitist looking at this vocabulary will be struck immediately by the fact that Arabic roots expressing mental activity have no clear-cut cor-respondences in other Semitic languages or appear to enjoy only a very restricted existence in the one or other of them. It is true that measured against the immense variety of spoken usage, the little that came to be enshrined in the preserved written documents of ancient Semitic lan-guages is, indeed, insigni\u0002cant. The gaps in our information are too wide and numerous to allow us to draw unambiguous and safe conclusions under most conditions. Many Semitic speech forms have gone entirely unrecorded. Some, lost until very recently, have been recovered to a degree. Others are not likely ever to become known again. On the other hand, it may be assumed that whatever concepts entered the mainstream 1 Cf. T. Nöldeke, in WZKM, III (1889), 101 f.rosenthal_f3_5-18.indd 510/17/2006 5:17:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"6 the knowledge before knowledgeof intellectual life could not have failed to be recorded somewhere in literature and those that were not were, in fact, outside the pale of effective conceptual life. For instance, the common Arabic root sh- \u0002-r “to know” is, it seems, attested only once in ancient Hebrew, that is, in Deuteronomy 32:17 where we read: “whom their fathers had not known (\u0004\u0005e\u0002\u0006rûm).” The correspondence of the Hebrew root \u0004-\u0002-r in this passage with Arabic sh- \u0002-r was recognized by modern scholars and is referred to in some dictionaries.2 It is still overlooked or goes unacknowledged by many modern students of the Bible. Since, however, \u0004-\u0002-r occurs here in parallelism with y-d- \u0002 “to know,” its meaning and, consequently, its connection with the Arabic root is as certain as anything in the \u0002eld of ancient Semitic lexicography. Now, what does this occurrence in Hebrew mean in its uniqueness? Does it indicate that the rarity of the attestation of the root is the result of mere chance? This would seem unlikely. Or is \u0004- \u0002-r an obsolete or, possibly, dialectal root? This could very well be the case, considering that its only occurrence is in a poem. These are ques-tions that cannot be answered at the present stage of our knowledge. It remains a fact that roots common and widely used in Arabic for various facets of mental activity are unusual or, apparently, unknown elsewhere in the close-knit circle of Semitic languages.1. The Root \u0002-l-mWhile the lack of correspondence for Arabic roots denoting mental activity in other Semitic languages is remarkable, it is no less remarkable that in turn, y-d- \u0002, the common Semitic root for “to know,” is not used in the Arabic with which we are familiar. Y-d-\u0002 is found in practically all other Semitic languages. This includes Ethiopic which, in addition to ayd\u0007\u0002a from the root y-d-\u0002, uses (amara) a \b\u0005mara belonging to the root \b-m-r, in its meaning of “to see” best represented in Akkadian, a situation for which one may compare Greek oida and Latin video.2 A connection between Arabic sh- \u0002-r and Aramaic s- \u0002-r has been suggested at times. It is not impossible, but it is neither clearly established nor necessarily supported by the meanings of s- \u0002-r (to visit, visitate, investigate, do, etc.) in the Aramaic dialects in which the root occurs.Later Muslim epistemological speculation tried to attribute some speci\u0002c kind of perception to sh-\u0002-r, cf., for instance, az-Zamakhsharî, Kashshâf, I, 134 (Bûlâq 1318–19), on sûrah 2:9/8; G. Vajda, Recherches sur la philosophie et la Kabbale, 388 (Paris and The Hague 1962).rosenthal_f3_5-18.indd 610/17/2006 5:17:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" the root \u0002\u0005-l-m 7It would seem probable that the terms employed for the expression of mental activity of any kind evolved slowly in human consciousness. In all likelihood, they were formed very gradually in the course of time in analogy to more primitive notions express ing, originally, physical perceptions and activities or, perhaps, magical ideas.3 We also \u0002nd, for instance, that individual Indo-European languages have quite different words for “knowledge.” More precisely, certain roots were specialized in this sense in some Indo-European languages, while other roots pre-vailed elsewhere. Terms to express mental activity were gained not only through the process of specialization of primary roots, but, in addi-tion, basic concepts were also often expressed by secondary modi\u0002ca-tions of primary roots. An example among many is Greek epistamai, epistêmê, which is widely considered to be a dialectal form of ephistêmi, from the root meaning “to stand” with the preposition epi, English “to understand.” Greek epistamai has a rather striking parallel, although no Greek in\u0003uence of any sort seems to be involved, in Arabic w-q-f \u0002alâ “to become acquainted with,” literally, “to stand (or stop) at.”The common possession by the Semitic languages of a root “to know” ( y-d-\u0002\u0005) is therefore no doubt another indication of the close relationship of all the Semitic languages4 and the comparatively recent date of their dispersion. All the more so does the non-existence of the root y-d- \u0002 in Arabic and its replacement by other roots suggest some special develop-ment peculiar to the Arabian environment, which led to the rejection of y-d-\u0002 and the preference shown for other roots.3 An instructive attempt to derive “knowing” from “doing” in the Greek mind and to trace this development on the basis of expressions for “knowledge” in Greek thought before Plato was undertaken by B. Snell, Die Ausdrücke für den Begriff des Wissens in der vorplatonischen Philosophie (Berlin 1924. Philologische Untersuchungen, 29). The study still bears reading, although the use of Greek as a language of high civilization is now known to date back into much more remote times and the possibility to recover the original concrete notions of abstract terms is correspondingly more remote.No primitive concrete notion can be associated with Semitic y-d-\u0002, whose antiquity is fully born out by its use in Akkadian, cf. The Assyrian Dictionary, VII, 20 ff. (Chicago 1960). The etymological speculations reported by G. J. Botterweck, “Gott erkennen” im Sprachgebrauch des Alten Testaments, 11 (Bonn 1951, Bonner Biblische Beiträge 2), seem incon-clusive, regardless of how much it would support the theory of a concrete origin for y-d- \u0002, if the root were to be connected with yad “hand.”4 That is, in the narrow sense, disregarding the relationship of Semitic with Egyptian and Hamitic.rosenthal_f3_5-18.indd 710/17/2006 5:17:48 PM"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"8 the knowledge before knowledgeOur general rule that Arabic roots expressing mental activity lack correspondences in other Semitic languages holds good for the most important one among them, Arabic \u0002-l-m “to know.” The occurrence of a derivation of \u0002-l-m in the meaning of “to know” has been suggested for Ugaritic by J. Aistleitner.5 However, for the two passages listed, the context of one is quite uncertain, and the other is more commonly, and with much greater probability, interpreted as containing the word \u0002âlam “eternity.” The root \u0002alama listed in the Ethiopic dictionary as of rare occurrence in the language and as meaning “signare, consignare lit-teris” could possibly be disregarded as being a loan from Arabic. This, however, would not be correct, for the root \u0002-l-m does occur in South Arabian inscriptions, and Ethiopic \u0002alama must be related to the South Arabian evidence.6 The latter requires closer study. We are greatly ham-pered in this respect by the uncertainties still surrounding the inter-pretation of much of the South Arabian material. In this particular instance, however, we are on comparatively safe ground. Most recent interpreters of the inscriptions containing the root \u0002-l-m seem to agree on its semantic relationship to Arabic \u0002alam “sign, mark.” In addition to a proper name \u0002lmn,7 South Arabian inscriptions have a verb \u0002-l-m in the basic conjugation and in the conjugation with pre\u0002xed t-, and both are generally translated “to sign.” The meaning of “document” is assigned to the noun \u0002lm used in connection with the verb, apparently on the basis of the assumption that a document is something “marked” or “signed” and, therefore, legally binding.8 There exists, however, a passage 5 Wörterbuch der ugaritischen Sprache, 232 (Berlin 1963, Berichte der Sächsischen Akad. d. Wiss., philol.-hist. Kl.).6 For the situation in another Ethiopian language, Tigrê, cf. E. Littmann and M. Höfner, Wörterbuch der Tigrê-Sprache, 451 f. (Wiesbaden 1962). As shown by the authors of the dictionary, the derivations from the root \u0002-l-m found in Tigrê, too, hark back mainly to the meaning of mark or sign. Those signifying teaching or learning seem to be less well represented and can be assumed to be loans from Arabic.7 Cf. Répertoire d’épigraphie sémitique, no. 2774, see A. Jamme, in J. B.

It is therefore not unjusti\u0002ed to suggest that the meaning of “to know” is an extension, peculiar to Arabic, of an original concrete term, namely, “way sign.”13 A similar development has been suggested for the Coptic verb sooun meaning “to know”; its supposed root w-s-n has been claimed to stand in the same relationship to Semitic South Arabian w-th-n “stone marking a borderline” as does German merken to Mark or Markstein.14 Be this as it may, the connection between “way sign” and “knowledge” is particularly close and takes on especial signi\u0002cance in the Arabian environment. For the Bedouin, the knowledge of way signs, the characteristic marks in the desert which guided him on his travels and in the execution of his daily tasks, was the most important and immediate knowledge to be acquired. In fact, it was the kind of knowl-edge on which his life and well-being principally depended. Thus, it is easy to see how in a largely nomadic environment, the general concept of knowledge was able to develop from the concrete process of being acquainted with “way signs.” Corroborative evidence for such an origin of Arabic \u0002-l-m “to know” may be found in one of the roots express-ing the opposite idea, namely, j-h-l “to be ignorant.” For the concept of 12 For a discussion of the ending -ôn in Biblical place names such as Shôm\u0007rôn Samaria, cf. for instance, G.

W. Leslau, Lexique Soqo\u000fri, 58, 198, 311, 325 f.

J-h-l, which in the Arabic known to us is the ordinary opposite of “to know,” has, it seems, no Semitic cognates. There is a good deal of plausibility to explaining j-h-l as a secondary formation from the well-known root j-w-l, meaning “to go around.” “Going around” could be wandering around in circles, roaming about aimlessly and not knowing where one is going. This, then, would be the exact counterpart of a “knowing” conceived as guidance provided by way signs in an environ-ment in which life depended upon such knowledge, and suffering and death were the likely results of being ignorant of it.Semantic speculations of this nature are, of course, impossible of exact veri\u0002cation. They gain in likelihood through parallels from more recent and better known periods. One such parallel has been shown to exist in modern \u0003Irâqî Arabic.15 There, indall “to be guided” tends to assume the general meaning of knowing or knowing one’s way or the whereabouts of things. If one believes in the possibility of recovering biconsonantal prototypes of existing triconsonantal roots, a connection of \u0002-l-m with the preposition \u0002al suggests itself, in the sense of having come “upon” something and thus being acquainted with it (cf. also Arabic w-q-f \u0002alâ, mentioned before) or, perhaps, in the sense of seizing the “high” points and orient-ing oneself with their help.16 Such a rather fanciful derivation could again be interpreted as leading to a knowledge based originally upon outstanding signs or markings in one’s environment, and we might \u0002nd here the starting point for the noun formation \u0002alam “way sign” as the intermediary between the biconsonantal stage and the meaning of the verbal root “to know.” Needless to say, the further we go into this sort of speculation, the less certain does the ground become under our feet.17 Even the comparatively conservative theory that “knowledge” in general was originally the particular knowledge of way signs may not be acceptable to everybody and be open to—no less uncertain—15 Cf. G. Krotkoff, in JAOS, LXXXIV (1964), 170 f.16 Cf. A.-S. Marmardji, La Lexicographie arabe à la lumière du bilittéralisme, 129 ff.

The proposed combination of “way signs” and “knowledge” remains, however, a suggestive hypothesis for explaining the concept of knowledge prevalent in early central Arabia. Knowledge there was a rather primitive groping after elementary mate-rial data under quite restricted social conditions. These data were not necessarily connected by some kind of material or logical nexus. Most of them were considered valuable by themselves, and knowledge of any one of them could be aspired to and appreciated as a useful accom-plishment. We may go a step farther and say that a similar conception of the meaning and value of knowledge can be discovered in much of the scholarly production of Muslim civilization at a much later date. It is tempting to see in the remarkable predilection shown for the presen-tation of information in a more or less random, unconnected fashion a survival of the very ancient Arabian approach to knowledge in an environment very different from that in which those particular modes of thought had their early origin. However, great caution is again indi-cated. Any such original meaning of the root \u0002-l-m can have been truly alive only in an extremely remote period antedating by far the ages for which we might claim to possess some sort of concrete historical understanding. When we encounter \u0002\u0005ilm in actual use, it had long been a generalized abstract term unconnected with crude material data.2. The Evidence of PoetryPoetry is practically the only intellectual pursuit which we can be positive was highly developed and much practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia. It seems certain that the Arabic word for poet, shâ\u0002ir, meant originally “one who knows,” and the word for poetry, shi\u0002r, “know-ledge.”18 What kind of knowledge was implied here is a moot 18 Cf., especially, I. Goldziher, Abhandlungen zur arabischen Philologie, I, 17 ff. (Leiden 1896–99). Arab lexicographers de\u0002ne shi\u0002r “poetry” as being knowledge, cf. Lisân al-\u0002Arab, VI, 76 f.: “Shi\u0002r is metrical speech. The term became specialized in this meaning because of the noble character of (such speech) gained through meter and rhyme, even if any knowledge may be (called) shi\u0002r, in the same manner in which the term \u0002qh (mean-ing knowledge and understanding) was specialized in the meaning of science of the religious law.” According to a remark attributed to the caliph \u0003Umar and others, poetry was the only “knowledge” worthy of the name possessed by the Arabs, before the divine revelation brought them a better knowledge, cf. Abû \u0004âtim ar-Râzî, Kitâb az-Zînah, ed. \u0004. F. al-Hamdânî, I, 96 f.

It could have been magical knowledge. On the whole, it would seem to be the more likely assumption that the poet was the person who was able to handle data beyond those of the most immediate practical experience, the person who was considered knowledge-able, alone of his fellow men gifted with insight and the ability to express his insight. If this was the case, it would mean that at the time the term came into usage, knowledge was a rare and restricted commodity and that it was a knowledge far removed from any scienti\u0002c and scholarly pursuits. However, this hypothetical original signi\u0002cance of the term may have been felt only in the earliest, pre-historic times. The Greeks and the Romans did not ordinarily think of the “poet” as a “doer,” nor does anyone today unless he wants to show off his learned understanding of word origins. Likewise, the Arabs in the centuries preceding the coming of Islam presumably did not see simply “knowers” in their poets, even if “knower” was the original meaning.Turning now to the more concrete evidence we have from pre-Islamic poetry—that is, from poems that have come down to us connected with the names of poets assumed to have lived before the coming of Islam—, we are forced to admit that the ground we are entering upon is not much safer than the one of semantic and etymological spe-culation we have just left. Our task is not one of gaining some sort of overall picture of pre-Islamic life and conditions or of concepts and beliefs that antedated Islam. We want to obtain information on spe-ci\u0002c attitudes that may, or may not, have existed in pre-Islamic Arabia. Therefore, the problem of genuineness is of more than usual impor-tance in each individual instance. Sporadic statements and re\u0003ections on particular attitudes toward mental activity and intellectual percep-tion can often be suspected of being later insertions or inventions. They were also susceptible to much subsequent modi\u0002cation which, though minor in appearance, may profoundly affect their signi\u0002cance for our particular quest. Individual words are easily replaced in Arabic poetry by others, which may not change very greatly the general drift of meaning but play havoc with subtler distinctions. At the present state of our knowledge, the only feasible procedure is therefore to consider as genuine almost everything that is transmitted as pre-Islamic, while at the same time keeping in mind that some legitimate doubt attaches to every detail. the evidence of poetry  13rosenthal_f3_5-18.indd 1310/17/2006 5:17:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"14 the knowledge before knowledgeEven so, the material that is of use for our investigation is quite limited. Obviously, it would serve no purpose here to try to stress the amount of factual knowledge possessed by pre-Islamic Arabs as evi-denced by their poetry. What we want to \u0002nd out is the amount and kind of re\u0003ection that might have existed concerning the abstract con-cept of knowledge and its meaning as well as its signi\u0002cance. Poetry as such is certainly not the appropriate vehicle for conveying such infor-mation. The particular individual situation of the poet determined the amount of factual knowledge which he himself might have possessed and which was, in theory, available to him. Variations in this respect must have been very great, depending on the poet’s relative location vis-à-vis the Mediterranean civilization of the time. Whatever his edu-cation, however, and regardless of the original meaning of the Arabic word for “poet,” poets did not feel called upon to apply themselves to the purveyance of scienti\u0002c information. Even less so would they have considered it their task to use their poetical talent for speculation about the nature and de\u0002nition of knowledge. Their primary concern was the realm of the senses and its sublimation not into intellectual abstractions but into purer forms of sensual enjoyment. The root \u0002-l-m and its oppo-site j-h-l, as well as other roots of related meanings, occur frequently in pre-Islamic poetry, but references to abstract knowledge are rare, and almost non-existent. Among the observations that may be made in this connection, it would seem that three points mainly deserve attention in our context. In the \u0002rst place, we \u0002nd occasional indications of an awareness, which was certainly shared by every intelligent contemporary, that knowledge is something gradated, which has to be acquired, which pos-sesses intrinsic value, and which has its circumscribed limits. Knowledge is something that sets the individual apart from his fellow men. A half-verse ascribed to an-Nâbighah adh-Dhubyânî runs:He who is ignorant of something is not like the one who knows.19Bishr b. Abî Khâzim exclaims dramatically:Is the experienced person like the one who does not know?!20 Ignorance can be overcome only slowly by gathering a growing 19 Cf. W.

Nöldeke, Zuhayr’s poem is to be dated around 600 A. D. Nöldeke expressed well founded doubts about the genuineness of the verse; it may be genuine, he says, and may not have undergone Muslim in\u0003uence, but the verse that follows upon it in the poem could, in his opinion, hardly be given even the bene\u0002t of the doubt. Thus, our dilemma is obvious. It is quite possible that the idea of an omni-scient deity was widely known all over Arabia in pre-Islamic times and had appealed to the pagan poet. Yet, the possibility of Islamic in\u0003uence cannot be ruled out. There are no criteria on which to base a valid scholarly judgment.In the second place, the differentiation of various degrees of certainty in intellectual perception, expressed by a variety of terms, was clearly recognized. This would, in any case, be our conclusion on the basis of the employment of the relevant terminology in the Qur\u0002ân.26 Also, a lack of this kind of insight into mental processes would presuppose an in\u0002nitely more primitive society than pre-Islamic Arabia is likely to have harbored. However, we can also cite at least one express statement from a verse ascribed to \u0003An\u0006arah:I do know in a way that is different from guesswork (\u0002ilman laysa bi-\u0012- \u0012anni ) thatWhen a man’s master is lowly, he himself is, too.27Thirdly, and most signi\u0002cantly, numerous verses make it quite clear that knowledge was considered a heightened form of reality and truth. Instead of saying that something is so, the poet would say, as in the verse just cited, that he knows that it is so. The poet may describe him-self as the depository of such knowledge. Much more frequently, another party is invoked to testify, through their knowledge, to the correctness of the statement the poet wishes to make. This other party may be the poet’s tribe, his home, his enemies, even horses or feet. This peculiar use of the concept of knowledge constitutes the most common occasion by far for the use of \u0002-l-m in ancient Arabic poetry. Nobody reading even a small amount of Arabic verse can fail to be struck by the force and frequency of this particular device. As rare as are verses dealing with other aspects of knowledge, those in which the poet emphasizes a point by referring to someone’s knowledge of it are exceed-ingly frequent.

It is a higher stage of experience. It serves as an appeal to man’s truer self. The conclusion that we have here a native Arabian forerunner of the important role knowledge was to play in Islamic civilization seems inescapable.* * *For the pre-Islamic attitude toward knowledge, it would be of consider-able signi\u0002cance, if the Qur\u0002ânic term jâhilîyah, which came to be used for the dark period before the advent of Islam, were certain to be an Arabic term current before the time of the Prophet. This, however, does not seem to be the case, as will be discussed in the next chapter. Thus, no illumination as to the pre-Islamic attitude toward knowledge can be derived from it.Altogether, there is little that can be said about “knowledge” in pre-Islamic Arabia. There existed, it seems, an original elementary concept of knowledge as the piecemeal acquisition of material data. It was, in the course of time, replaced by, or rather, amalgamated with a concept of knowledge as something possessing different degrees of realization. Eventually, there came the additional insight that knowledge constituted a higher and truer form of reality. Such was “knowledge” in Arabia when Mu\bammad came and forged the concept into the basic tool and objective of divine revelation, thus setting the stage for that rever-ence for knowledge which was to become the main theme of Islamic civilization.40 The Dîwân of al-A\u0002shâ, ed.

Here we have indeed “the full light of history,” at least as far as the concept of knowledge is con-cerned. However, even history’s fullest light falls concentrated only upon a few small spots and usually leaves most areas dimly lit by some weak and widely diffused light. As always, many problems of origin, analysis, and interpretation remain. Their \u0002nal solution must be considered as something beyond our reach. But the overall import of all the questions raised and answers suggested leaves no room for doubt. Mu\bammad’s concept of “knowledge” set intellectual life in Islam on its basically unchangeable course. There was comparatively little that later in\u0003u-ences and developments were able to accomplish by way of injecting new ideas into the fundamental structure of the Prophet’s thought or by way of enriching it materially. Such in\u0003uences and developments were, moreover, altogether unable to change its main thrust and effect.1. A Word Count and its MeaningIn all its derivations, the root \u0002-l-m—excluding, of course, the un-related \u0002âlam “world”1—occurs in the Qur\u0002ân with unusual 1 As may be expected, Muslim scholars sometimes connected \u0002âlam with \u0002ilm or \u0002alam. Cf. \u0003Abd-al-Qâhir al-Baghdâdî, U\u0015ûl ad-dîn. 34 (Istanbul 1346/1928, reprinted, n. y., n. p.): “\u0002Âlam is everything that has knowledge and sense perception,” but a com-bination with \u0002alam/\u0002alâmah is preferable. \u0002Âlam is “a designation for the angels, the jinn, and the human beings who possess knowledge.” It is “the totality of bodies (substances) and accidents of which the Creator has knowledge” (cf. az-Zamakhsharî, Kashshâf, I, 43). In this case, \u0002ilm, and not \u0002alam, is clearly meant. However, it is \u0002alam/\u0002alâmah which is adduced by the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn al-Juwaynî in explain-ing that \u0002alam is called \u0002alam because it is an indication set up to indicate the existence of the owner of the \u0002alam. Likewise, the world with its substances, accidents, parts, and particles is a sign indicating the existence of the Lord, the owner of the world, cf. his Luma\u0002 al-adillah, ed. Fawqîyah \u0004usayn Ma\bmûd, 76 (Cairo 1385/1965). The view expounded by ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî is not quite clear. With great if misplaced ingenuity, probably borrowed from some older source, he combines \u0002âlam with words of a similar rosenthal_f4_19-40.indd 1910/17/2006 5:19:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"20 the revelation of knowledgefrequency. There are about 750 occurrences all told. Since the Qur\u0002ân contains roughly something short of 78,000 words, it can be said that the derivations of the root \u0002-l-m make up about one percent of its vocabulary. The auxiliary verb k-w-n “to be” occurs over 1,300 times, and the unavoidable q-w-l “to say” is found almost 1,700 times (which reveals something fundamental if obvious about later Muslim civiliza-tion, namely that its predilection for the spoken word in all its aspects has its roots in ancient Arabian tradition). Besides k-w-n and q-w-l, only the words Allâh “God,” with over 2,800 occurrences, and rabb “master, Lord,” with over 950 occurrences, surpass the root \u0002-l-m by a large mar-gin. The root \b-m-n is found a few times more than \u0002-l-m. This, however, takes into account not only the meaning of “to believe” but requires inclusion of the occurrences of the root in the basic conjugation, where the meaning is very different. Historically, and, presumably, also in the linguistic consciousness of the speaker, these various forms do not belong as closely together as do the various derivations of \u0002-l-m. Thereafter, fre-quency \u0002gures fall off rather rapidly. From within the 450–550 range, we may mention \b-t-y “to come,” k-f-r, which serves as the opposite of âmana “to believe,” r-s-l “(to send as) messenger,” and ar\u000e “earth.”It may be doubted whether such unre\u0002ned statistical evidence has any signi\u0002cance at all. However, such doubts would seem to be unjusti\u0002ed in this particular case. Mu\bammad’s message was no abstract intellectual exercise. The Prophet was also not con-cerned with variety in the ideas he preached. On the contrary, he noun formation such as khâtam and \u000fâba\u0002, both meaning “seal,” and interprets it as the “instrument” by which the world with all the substances and accidents it contains “is known” (or does he mean, “is marked,” from \u0002alam?). Thus, the world is instrumental in proving the existence of its Creator, cf. his Mufradât, III, 141, s. rad. \u0002-l-m (Cairo 1322, in the margin of Ibn al-Athîr, Nihâyah). At-Tahânawî is even more ambiguous. He also brings \u0002âlam together with khâtam and \u000fâba\u0002 and derives it from \u0002alam/\u0002alâmah as the desig-nation for something through which something is known. He presumably did not think at all of “is marked,” since he goes on to say that the word came to be used primarily for that “through which the Creator is known” (this would seem to be the only possible translation in this case). “It designates all the existentia with the exception of God, that is, the created things whether they are substances or accidents,” which indicate the existence of a Necessary Originator, cf. his Kashshâf i\u0015tilâ\u0003ât al-funûn, 1053 (Calcutta 1854–62). Notwithstanding all these speculations, however, by and large little was made of the suggestive, if completely wrong, etymology which brings \u0002âlam together with the Arabic root \u0002-l-m.rosenthal_f4_19-40.indd 2010/17/2006 5:19:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":" a word count and its meaning  21felt called upon to make his contemporaries conscious of a very few basic truths. The way to achieve this end was to repeat these truths constantly and singlemindedly, regardless of how much repetition this entailed. Using the same word or root over and over again was—and still is—the surest way to have the message it contains register in the minds of the listeners. It is evident that the terms which were truly important to the Prophet do indeed occur in the Qur\u0002ân with greater frequency than all others. Vice versa, terms that expressed ideas which he did not consider vital elements f his preaching tend to appear low down on the scale in the tabula-tion of words. The correctness of this observation is in a way con\u0002rmed by the low frequency of certain terms which were to play important roles in Islam later on. They do occur in the Qur\u0002ân and, in fact, were often propelled into their important roles on the basis of their occurrence in Qur\u0002ânic passages. But they were of no special concern to Mu\bammad during his lifetime. Therefore, they enjoy no prominence in the Qur\u0002ân. For instance, “justice” (\u0002-d-l ) belongs to a root sparsely mentioned in it. This obviously does not mean that the Prophet might have thought little of justice as a political, ethical, or religious force. It does suggest that in the historical and ideational con-text of his preaching, there was no fundamental need to make much of the concept and all it stood for. Avoidance of the discussion of issues that are of no immediate concern is as necessary for political success as is \u0002rm and constant insistence upon those that are. We may be disap-pointed to \u0002nd, for instance, that the word “freedom” (\u0003urrîyah) is not mentioned expressly in the Qur\u0002ân. However, if it were, it would be merely incidental and of little signi\u0002cance; no matter how great a role the concept played at some later date, it could not have been a vital issue for Mu\bammad requiring to be stressed and repeated constantly in his preaching. Considerations of this sort support the assumption that the frequency with which the root \u0002-l-m occurs in the Qur\u0002ân is not a matter of chance. It is mentioned with such persistence that nobody could fail to notice it. It was a concept that the Prophet wanted to be noticed. It was one of the basic ideas he had made it his business to convey to his followers.Another objection might be raised against the evaluation of the statistical evidence suggested here. At \u0002rst glance, this objection may appear to possess some validity. However, in reality, it is rosenthal_f4_19-40.indd 2110/17/2006 5:19:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"22 the revelation of knowledgeequally baseless. It could be said that Allâh “God” and âmana “to believe” (or its opposite, k-f-r) are strictly religious terms wherever they occur. \u0002-l-m, on the other hand, although it is used with a religious connotation, is also a common verb with an ordinary meaning. Thus, it may be argued, \u0002-l-m would inevitably occur quite frequently in any lengthy work regard-less of its subject matter. In this respect, then, the use of \u0002-l-m should be compared with, say, \b-t-y “to come” which occurs very often without, of course, any special religious signi\u0002cance. This reasoning founders on three considerations. In the \u0002rst place, the passages where \u0002-l-m occurs \u0002lled with a special meaning in the Qur\u0002ânic context are much more numerous than are those where an incidental, secular usage may be assumed. Secondly, a concept expressing mental activity such as “know-ing” (and the derived one of “teaching” is in fact something much less obtrusive than terms expressing physical activities such as “coming” or “saying.” Occurrences of its use therefore are much less likely to be incidental. And thirdly, everything tends to show that Mu\bammad did indeed attribute great signi\u0002cance to “knowledge” in the system of his religious thought. Even if the frequency of the occurrence of the root were to be reduced to a much smaller \u0002gure statistically, which need not be done, it would still be prominent enough to command attention. As it is, even the few supposedly incidental occurrences of \u0002-l-m do not really seem to be incidental and cannot be dismissed as such. Every single occurrence of the root forms part of a plan to condition receptive minds to “knowing” as a basic force in the new religion. No doubt, this was fully intended to be so. Moreover, the very fact that we have here a concept in which religious and secular terminology came together is a matter of profound signi\u0002cance which will require some further elabo-ration later on.2. The Motivating Force behind the Qur\u0002ânic Use of \u0002-l-mInsistence upon the importance of “knowledge” in a religious view of life may perhaps seem rather natural to us and something that requires no further comment. However, not much re\u0003ection is needed to show that the stress upon “knowledge” in a religious system is something rather unexpected and remarkable, and its presence begs for an explanation, if one can be provided. In the case of the Qur\u0002ân, in particular, native Arabian stimuli by them-selves could hardly have provoked a development such as we \u0002nd rosenthal_f4_19-40.indd 2210/17/2006 5:19:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"in the Qur\u0002ân with respect to knowledge. It is true, as shown in the preceding chapter, that knowledge had come to represent a higher level of reality for pre-Islamic Arabs. But no matter how much we might strain our imagination to \u0002nd a possible substitute for the missing evi-dence, we would hardly be justi\u0002ed in assuming that in pagan Arabia at least, knowledge was a concept that possessed religious urgency and was ready to play a prominent role in a new religious movement. Unless there existed some conception of knowledge in pre-Islamic Arabia beyond our purview, it is impossible to understand why Mu\bammad should have given knowledge such a crucial position in his teaching. Thus, we are compelled to look for possible outside in\u0003uences. To some, this might seem to bring up again the much discussed question of the Prophet’s “originality.” The contention that any search for extraneous models and inspiration diminishes the originality of his accomplish-ment and is, anyhow, unnecessary is as wrong as it is trite. In fact, if the Qur\u0002ânic use of \u0002-l-m cannot be placed in a historical context—and pagan pre-Islamic Arabia by itself does not furnish such a context—, it cannot but appear arbitrary and meaningless, and thus not truly origi-nal. True creative originality is found only where there is meaningful continuity. The “originality” of the Prophet’s concern with knowledge will therefore be understood only if a likely source can be discovered.In this connection, a highly suggestive passage is Qur\u0002ân 102: 5–7/5–7: “Indeed, if you were to know \u0002ilma l-yaqîni, you would see Hell. Then, you would indeed see it \u0002ayna l-yaqîni.” \u0002Ilma l-yaqîni may merely stand for an English adverbial construction, “certainly, with certainty.”2 However, taken by itself, the words may rather suggest the meaning of “the knowl-edge of certainty.” This translation calls to mind an extremely in\u0003u-ential concept of Christian theological speculation, hê gnôsis tês alêtheias “the knowledge of truth.”3 In Syriac translation, the Greek expression 2 The adverbial construction in the form \u0002alima \u0002ilman yaqînan appears, for instance, in the poetry of Dhû r-Rummah as quoted by ash-Sharîshî, Shar\u0003 al-Maqâmât al-\tarîrîyah, I, 23 (Cairo 1306), cf. also C. H. H. Macartney’s edition of Dhû r-Rummah’s Dîwân, 667 (Cambridge 1919), where further references are given. It came to be used very widely, cf., for instance, \u0004unayn, in his translation of Galen, Über die medizinischen Namen, ed., trans. M. Meyerhof and J. Schacht, 16, l. 19 f. (Berlin 1931, Abhandlungen der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Phil.-hist. Kl.).3 Cf., for instance, W.

There can be no objection to the use of \u0002ilm here to translate Greek gnôsis. The differentiation in Arabic usage involv-ing a distinct preference for employing the root \u0002-r-f for translating gig-nôskô and its derivatives4 is traceable only in much later times. It cannot be expected to have made its appearance already in the Qur\u0002ânic period. Moreover, the Syriac phrase uses the root y-d-\u0002, which would undoubt-edly be rendered by Arabic \u0002-l-m. This makes unconvincing any attempt to rule out \u0002ilm as a possible translation of gnôsis.The use of yaqîn in the sense of “truth” could also by no means be considered objectionable. Yaqîn always serves to refer to know-ledge at its most certain.5 In the Qur\u0002ân, yaqîn occurs twice paired with \u0003aqq “truth” in a genitive construction (\u0003aqqu l-yaqîni, 56:95/95 and 69:51/51). The exact interpretation of these pas-sages has caused some dif\u0002culty to grammarians and Qur\u0002ân inter-preters. They vacillate mainly between two interpretations. \taqq al-yaqîn either “truth (resulting) from certain (information)” or “truth (which is) certainty.” The latter interpretation assumes identity of meaning for \u0003aqq and yaqîn.6 Be this as it may, yaqîn could very or H.A. Wolfson, The Philosophy of the Church Fathers, I, 14, and passim (on the understand-ing of gnôsis in early Christian theology) (Cambridge, Mass., 1956), The expression da\u0002a\u000b \beme\u000b of the Dead Sea Sectarians may also belong here, cf. W. D. Davies, ‘Knowledge’ in the Dead Sea Scrolls, in Harvard Theological Review, XLVI (1953), 119. The later ûfî interpretation of \u0002ilm al-yaqîn comes again very close to the Gnostic understanding of hê gnôsis tês alêtheias. A late Ismâ\u0003îlî author de\u0002nes “faith” (îmân) as “the knowledge of the truth” (\u0002ilm al-\u0003aqîqah), cf. Shihâb-ad-dîn al-Maynaqî, Kitâb al-Î\u000eâ\u0003, ed. \u0003Ârif Tâmir, 8 f. (Beirut 1965).4 Thus, it is of no signi\u0002cance that in Graeco-Arabic translation literature, we \u0002nd the Qur\u0002ânic \u0002ilm al-yaqîn used to render Greek epistêmê, while gnôsis tês alêtheias occur-ring right next to it appears in Arabic as ma\u0002rifat \u0003aqîqat . . ., cf. Nicomachus of Gerasa, Arithmêtikê Eisagôgê, 2, l. 2 Hoche, Arabic trans. by Thâbit b. Qurrah, ed. W. Kutsch, 11 (Beirut 1959). Cf. also 4, l. 10 Hoche = 13 Kutsch and below, p. 199. Ma\u0002rifat al-\u0003aqq occurs also in the commentary of \blynws on the Isagoge, as quoted by Abû l-\u0004asan b. Abî Dharr, Kitâb as-Sa\u0002âdah wa-l-is\u0002âd, ed. M. Minovi, 340 (Wiesbaden 1957–58).5 At a very early date, the meaning of “death” was attributed by many authorities to yaqîn in Qur\u0002ân 15:99/99 and 74:47/48. Although there is hardly anything unusual in \u0002nding “certainty” used as a euphemism for “death,” it seems more likely that this meaning is due to exegetes who felt that in the former passage, the ordinary meaning of yaqîn did not yield an acceptable sense. However, this is not really necessary. Another passage whose context also presents dif\u0002culties of interpretation contains an obviously parallel phrase in which yaqîn is replaced by \u0002ilm (10:93/93).6 Cf. a\u0006-\u0005abarî, Tafsîr, XXVII, 110 f.

There is no need to insist that only \u0003aqq could have served this purpose.In favor of understanding \u0002ilma l-yaqîni not as a rendering of “the knowledge of truth” but as an adverbial expression, it may be claimed that we have a parallelism between it and the following \u0002ayna l-yaqîni, which can mean only “(seeing) with the eye of certainty,” represent-ing an adverbial construction. However, it is easily possible that the expression of “the knowledge of truth,” having once been adopted by Mu\bammad as a phrase of religious import, suggested to him when he used it the seemingly parallel expression \u0002ayna l-yaqîni in the following sentence.We cannot be absolutely certain that hê gnôsis tês alêtheias found its way into the Qur\u0002ân through direct translation from, presumably, some Aramaic dialect. There is, however, one undeniable fact in support of such an assumption. The phrase was much used and discussed in Christian circles in the time of the Prophet and in a geographical location as close to central Arabia as we might hope to \u0002nd for any literary evidence of this sort. Signi\u0002cantly, the evi-dence does not come from a strictly traditional Christian work but from a work of Christian gnosticism, the Centuries of the fourth-century Evagrius Ponticus. The Centuries are known to us through their Syriac translation(s) and through the commentary of Bâbây of Mount Îzlâ who was a contemporary of Mu\bammad.7 Î\ra\u0002\u000bâ \rashrârâ occurs in the work numerous times, and the importance of the expression for the thought of both the author and the commentator is fully evident.

Guillaumont, Les ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’ d’Évagre le Pontique (Paris 1962). Guillaumont has shown that the work has come down to us in two Syriac translations, the one published by W. Frankenberg, Euagrius Ponticus (Göttingen 1912, Abh. der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, philol.-hist. Kl., N.

John the Hermit ( John of Apameia) uses î\ra\u0002\u000bâ as a fundamental term. His work is pos-sibly to be dated in the \u0002rst half of the sixth century, although this date and his authorship of some of the material published under his name are highly uncertain. In the words of its editor, î\ra\u0002\u000bâ “is used to indi-cate an ability lodged in human nature. It is also used with reference to an ability that can be acquired by a life of resignation and, espe-cially, quietude. And \u0002nally, it is used for the highest form of divine experience.”8 Shem\u0003ôn d\u0005aybû\u000beh, who lived in Islamic times, in the late seventh century, but before the existence of Islamic in\u0003uence upon a man of his kind could be reasonably expected, also makes much of “knowledge” and of “the knowledge of the truth,” which is the light of the soul and is nourished by a sovereign free will and constant pious meditation. However, it must be admitted that for him, “knowledge” does not have as characteristic a function as it does for the other authors mentioned.9 It may further be added here that there is an interesting text of an older date which, however, might have been well known to the Christians along the borders of Arabia in the time of the Prophet, the Odes of Solomon, which, as has been pointed out,10 the root y-d-\u0002 and its derivations are of much more frequent occurrence than the concept of faith (h-y-m-n).The stress placed on knowledge in these works, and even the manner in which the concept is handled, forcibly recall the Qur\u0002ânic treatment of \u0002ilm. It is a possible and by no means daring assumption that some-what unorthodox Christian discussions in some form or other trickled down to Mu\bammad and, sparking his interest in “knowledge,” set in motion the great movement toward \u0002ilm in Islam. This is a hypothesis, and it must remain one until further evidence is forthcoming, if this should ever be the case. However, it de\u0002nitely helps us to understand the seeming discrepancy between the limited scope of pre-Islamic Arabian “knowledge” and the tremendous impact the concept undeniably made upon Mu\bammad. For the present, Christian gnostics, if they may thus be labeled, 8 Cf. L. G. Rignell, Drei Traktate von Johannes dem Einsiedler, 18 (Lund 1960, Lunds Universitets \u0016rsskrift, N. F.

Normative Judaism takes little notice of “knowledge” in its preserved writings.

Little can be made of the verses of a Jewish poet alleged to have been composed concerning an event of the year 624, the murder of Ka\u0003b b. al-Ashraf, and presumed to have been spoken not much later than the following year:I notice that he (Mu\bammad) is disapproved by the rabbis all,Each of whom possesses knowledge and is well-informed,Who have been studying every (kind of ) knowledgeSpoken of by the Torah and the Psalter.Far from being “unquestionably authentic,”12 these verses must be con-sidered of doubtful genuineness, even if they are quite old. Assuming that they were indeed composed at the date indicated, one would have to \u0002nd in them an echo of Qur\u0002ânic terminology rather than the source of it. On the other hand, attention may be called to the fact that scholars feel that the term “knowledge” (da\u0002a\u000b) plays a signi\u0002cant role in the writ-ings of the Dead Sea Sectarians. In fact, the Palestinian Psalmist whose composition has been recovered in Qumrân anticipated an important Islamic development when he sang, “Grant me a spirit of faith and knowledge” (rûa\u0003 \b\u0005emûnâh w \u0007-\ra\ba\u000b \u0003onn\u0017nî ).13 Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of the existence of a similar in\u0003uence of gnostic ideas on Arabian Judaism as is found among certain Christians, and hence, the possibility of the in\u0003uence of such hypothetical Jewish gnosticism on Mu\bammad. the motivating force behind the qur\u0002â\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\b\u0005\t \u0002-l-m 2711 Cf. also M.

Pagan Gnosticism, in some form or other, might have furnished the inspiration for Mu\bammad’s religious conception of “knowledge.” Mandaeism at once comes to mind, although valid objections may be raised to refer-ring to it as “pagan” gnosticism. The Mandaean religious writings speak constantly of kush\u000fâ “truth.” Mandaeism derives its very name from “knowledge” in the guise of Manda \rHayye “The Knowledge of Life.” It has also been pointed out that “truth” and “life” were brought into inti-mate contact in the Gospel of St. John 14:6.14 There would be nothing strange in encountering gnostic Mandaean in\u0003uences in central Arabia. The possibility of such in\u0003uences has indeed been hinted at tentatively in connection with a particular passage of the Qur\u0002ân.15 However, it is hardly possible as yet, although future discoveries may very well alter the situation, to make out a documented and convincing case for a sub-stantial in\u0003uence upon the Qur\u0002ân from this direction. Thus, the gnostic Christian hypothesis would so far seem to point to the most likely source of inspiration for the Prophet’s concept of knowledge.3. Human Knowledge and Divine KnowledgeThe constant repetition in the Qur\u0002ân of the statement that God “knows” made a profound impact upon later Muslim theology. How Mu\bammad conceived of such divine knowledge has been carefully studied by mod-ern scholars.16 How God’s “knowledge,” His omniscience, was to be understood in the larger context of theology, whether or not the process of knowing was of the same kind in God as in human beings, what a knowing God meant for human affairs—all this was discussed over and over by Muslim scholars. They also noted that certain other roots besides \u0002-l-m that expressed intellectual perception, in particular, \u0002-r-f, were inapplicable to God and were therefore not used in the Qur\u0002ân in connection with Him.17 It can hardly be assumed that Mu\bammad 14 Cf.

According to the Qur\u0002ân, God’s knowledge is undeniably superior in quantity to that of human beings. “God knows, and you do not know,” the Qur\u0002ân says frequently. But it is also somehow different in quality. God knows about secret matters, the knowledge of which escapes human beings, cf., for instance, Qur\u0002ân 6:59/59 and also 11:31/33.All human knowledge speci\u0002cally comes from God. Thus, it is evident that human beings cannot know more than God (2:140/134). Even the angels know only what God has taught them (2:32/30). Nothing of the divine knowledge can be known except if God wills it (2:255/256). Much more important, however, is the obvious assumption throughout the Qur\u0002ân that human knowledge, that is, true human knowledge, is to be equated with religious insight. In this connection, it is worthy of notice that \u0002ilm is supposed to have been possessed preferably by Biblical \u0002gures who succeeded in achieving knowledge of the true religion.18 Indeed, the prophets are in the possession of a knowledge coming to them from God such as ordinary human beings do not possess (7:62/60). But there are also numerous passages which show clearly that in Mu\bammad’s view, “knowledge” was to be equated with the divine revelation he him-self, and his less successful predecessors among the Biblical prophets, had received. In a passage whose precise interpretation is not altogether certain, the Holy Book itself is described as “a book which We have set out according to knowledge” (7:52/50). Elsewhere, it is argued that faith follows upon knowledge, and the question is asked, how could anyone knowingly not believe? (3:71 ff./64 ff.). The equation of religious faith with knowledge \u0002nds its clearest indication in certain passages where the intended meaning is thrown into bold relief by the time-honored use of parallelism. \u0002Ilm and îmân appear once paired in a set phrase, which usually employs only \u0002ilm (30:56/56). “Believing” and “being attempts rather interestingly to show that syntactic considerations in Qur\u0002ân 2:197/193 and 3:29/29 suggest the meaning of “to learn, to take cognizance of ” for \u0002-l-m where God is the subject. This goes against later theological ideas. It might have already been repugnant to Mu\bammad’s concept of the omniscience of God. Cf., however, below, pp. 113 ff.18 Cf. H. Speyer, Die biblischen Erzählungen im Qoran, 130, n. 1 (reprint Hildesheim 1961). human knowledge and divine knowledge 29rosenthal_f4_19-40.indd 2910/17/2006 5:19:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"30 the revelation of knowledgegiven knowledge” appear as parallel expressions in Qur\u0002ân 58:11/12: “God will lift up by degrees those among you who have come to believe and those who have been given knowledge.” Another Qur\u0002ânic passage also implies in the same manner that knowledge is the necessary consequence of faith: “And those who have come to believe know . . ., whereas those who do not believe say . . .” (2:26/24). In the rhymed prose style of the Qur\u0002ân, “those who believe” are paired with “those who have certain knowledge ( yûqinûn)” of the other world (2:4/3). The most telling indications for the basic identity of knowledge and faith are to be found in pas-sages where roots expressing various forms of intellectual perception are juxtaposed with the verb “to believe.” Thus, Qur\u0002ân 6:97–99/97–99 describes everything in the world as having been created for the guidance of mankind, in these terms: “And we have set out signs for people who know ( ya\u0002lamûn) . . ., for people who under-stand ( yafqahûn) . . ., for people who have come to believe ( yu\bminûn).” Less dramatically, the same idea is driven home in Qur\u0002ân 45:3–6/2–5: “Signs for believers (li-l-mu \b\u0005minîn) . . ., signs for people who have certain knowledge yûqinûn) . . ., people who have understand-ing ( ya\u0002qilûn) . . ., and in what story after God and His signs will they believe ( yu \b\u0005minûn)?”The accumulated evidence is striking and persuasive. Right from the start, the student of the Qur\u0002ân \u0002nds himself confronted with the thought presented forcefully and inescapably that all human knowledge that has any real value and truly deserves to be called “knowledge” is religious knowledge. Moreover, it is not just vaguely some general reli-gious information, but it is speci\u0002cally identical with the contents of the divine message transmitted by the Prophet.The Qur\u0002ân does, of course, often refer to mundane knowledge possessed by human beings. Such knowledge, it seems, is consid-ered acquired by means of three organs of the body, the eye, the ear, and the heart. This at least is the obvious interpretation of passages in which hearing, seeing, and “hearts” are mentioned together (32:9/8 and 67:23/23), and, in particular, of the Qur\u0002ânic passage 17:36/38 which holds these three functions responsible for the absence of knowledge: “Do not go after that of which you have no knowledge, for hearing, sight, and heart, all these are held responsible.”Furthermore, the vocabulary of the Qur\u0002ân also reveals awareness rosenthal_f4_19-40.indd 3010/17/2006 5:19:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"of the manifold shades of human intellectual perception by its use of practically all the relevant Arabic roots, such as \u0002-l-m, d-r-y, \u0002-r-f, sh-\u0002-r, \u0002-q-l, y-q-n, f-q-h, f-k-r, f-h-m (which occurs only once), \u0012-n-n, z-\u0002-m, dh-k-r, b-y-n, d-r-s, ba\u0015îr bi-, khabîr bi-, and mu\u0003î\u000f bi-. The famous passage concerning the cruci\u0002xion of Jesus (4:157/156) catalogues in detail various degrees of cognition such as doubt (shakk), guessing (\u0012ann), knowledge (\u0002ilm), and certainty ( yaqîn). In another passage, the Qur\u0002ân speaks of knowledge, guessing, and conjecturing (takhru\u0015ûn, 6:148/149). But not only do we \u0002nd the existence of such gradations of knowledge attested in the Qur\u0002ân. We are also told in a number of passages about the dialectical processes through which knowledge is acquired and sifted by human beings. The vocabulary used in this connection (shâqqa, jâdala “to dispute,” \u0003ujjah, burhân “argument, proof ”) shows considerable re\u0002nement and precision, if not in the later philo-sophical sense.In the Prophet’s view of the world, “knowledge” which in its totality is a matter of the deepest concern for him consists of two principal parts. There is human knowledge, that is, a secular human knowledge of an elementary or more advanced character and a religious human knowledge; the latter constitutes the highest development of knowledge attainable to man, and it is the kind of human knowledge usually meant in the Qur\u0002ân where it preaches the importance of human knowledge. But in addition to human knowledge both secular and religious, there also exists a divine knowledge. It is basically identical with human knowledge, still, it is somehow of a higher order both quantitatively and qualitatively. The most important feature of these aspects of knowledge is that they are felt and represented by the Prophet as interlocking and interdependent. There can be no human knowledge secular or religious without the knowledge possessed by the deity. On the other hand, the reason for the existence of divine knowledge as well as its \u0002nal destination are, in a manner of speaking, man and his need and desire for knowledge. Knowledge may be acquired by human action, but it would seem to be within the power of God to bestow it upon man in any degree and to any extent He chooses. The worth of knowledge and, indeed, the mere fact that something can be considered knowledge depend on the existence of a relationship between such knowledge and what is thought of as God’s knowledge or as being in harmony with it. It is obviously human knowledge and divine knowledge 31rosenthal_f4_19-40.indd 3110/17/2006 5:19:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"32 the revelation of knowledgequestionable whether anything else that human beings may wish to call knowledge is to be regarded as such. Whenever one speaks of human knowledge, he has to keep in mind the connection between such knowledge and the form of knowledge that is suitable only for the deity. Knowledge appears as something varied and immense, but it is in a sense \u0002nite and monolithic. Above all, however, know-ledge remains the goal of all worthwhile aspirations of mankind, the true synonym of religion.These were the ideas that determined the development of Muslim “knowledge” and with it, of all Muslim intellectual life and, in fact, all Muslim religious and political life. From the Qur\u0002ânic attitude toward knowledge, it would be possible almost to predict the course that Muslim theology, mysticism, jurisprudence and the like were to take, as well as the fate that had to befall the liberating in\u0003uences set in motion by the reception of the Classical heritage in the ninth century. The triumphs and defeats of Muslim civilization are foreshadowed in Mu\bammad’s understanding of “knowledge.”4. JâhilîyahThe term jâhilîyah occurs in the Qur\u0002ân four times.19 The way it is used is another indication that in the mind of the Prophet, unawareness of or opposition to his message was equivalent to “ignorance” as being the opposite of knowledge and religion. Goldziher’s much discussed suggestion that the root j-h-l was, with reference to jâhilîyah, to be understood as the opposite of \u0003ilm “kindness” (or the like) and that it denoted “barbarity” rather than ignorance20 is of doubtful validity as such. It certainly 19 (3:154/148) “A group of you . . . thinking (\u0012ann) about God what is not true in the way of al-jâhilîyah.”(5:50/55) “Is it the judgment (\u0003ukm) of al-jâhilîyah they desire? But who is better than God in judgment. . . .”(33:33/33) “(O wives of the Prophet) . . . do not swagger about in the manner of al-jâhilîyah al-ûlâ.”(48:26/26) “Since those who did not believe put into their hearts \u0002erceness, the \u0002erce-ness of al-jâhilîyah, God thereupon sent down His sakînah upon His Prophet and the believers. . . .”20 Cf. I. Goldziher, Muhammedanische Studien, I, 219–28 (Halle 1889), English trans. by C. R. Barber and S. M. Stern, 201–8 (London 1967). The religious connotation of the use of the root j-h-l has been well brought out by Toshiko Izutsu, The Structure of the rosenthal_f4_19-40.indd 3210/17/2006 5:19:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"does not apply to the meaning the Prophet himself found in jâhilîyah. But what is the original, precise signi\u0002cance of the word?The main problem lies in the strange type of word formation represented by jâhilîyah. Genuine abstract noun formations ending in -îyah are rare in the Qur\u0002ân, nor would one expect to \u0002nd them there. Another clear example, rahbânîyah “monasticism,” obviously originated under foreign in\u0003uence.21 An abstract noun forma-tion ending in -îyah on the basis of an Arabic participle, suppos-edly coined by Mu\bammad himself, seems particularly strange, so strange indeed as to invite disbelief in its possibility. As a matter of fact, although there is at least one clear instance in the old \u0003adîth where jâhilîyah denotes an abstract quality (“you are a man in which there is jâhilîyah”),22 the passages of the Qur\u0002ân seen as they are and not through the eyes of traditional interpretation do not require an abstract meaning for the term. Jâhilîyah here might be considered a collective plural of jâhil “ignorant (person).” A corresponding for-mation would, for instance, be \u0003urrîyah explained, in a verse by Dhû r-Rummah, as “nobles,”23 A similar formation may be posited for dhurrîyah “progeny,” although it must be admitted that the etymology of this word is quite uncertain (and the Arabic root dh-r-r “to sprinkle” parallels the root dh-r-y). In support of the interpretation of jâhilîyah as a collective plural, it should be noted that in all its occurrences in the Qur\u0002ân, jâhi-lîyah is used next to pluralic forms referring to people. There is nothing to indicate in the Qur\u0002ânic passages that jâhilîyah signi\u0002es some such con-cept as a de\u0002nite “period of ignorance” or a well-de\u0002ned “paganism.”24 All they say is that there is or was al-jâhilîyah, meaning, perhaps, “igno-rant persons” who spoke and acted contrary to what Mu\bammad considered the right way of thinking and behavior.

Izutsu’s interpretation of jâhilîyah depends, however, too much on accepted traditional ideas concerning the term. For the unusual character of the -îyah formation, cf. also T. Nöldeke, F. Schwally, and others, Geschichte des Qorâns, I, 242 (Leipzig 1909–38).21 But cf. J. Horovitz, Koranische Untersuchungen, 64 (Berlin and Leipzig 1926).22 Cf. A. J.

It would seem to signify here generic determination. jâhilîyah  33rosenthal_f4_19-40.indd 3310/17/2006 5:19:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"34 the revelation of knowledgenumeral, al-ûlâ might suggest the existence of a sharply de\u0002ned \u0002rst group (or period) of jâhilîyah which was followed by a second (and, possi-bly, a third, etc.) one. The Qur\u0002ân interpreters have, in fact, understood al-ûlâ in this manner and have tried to \u0002x the actual dates of the \u0002rst and second jâhilîyahs in terms of the history of the Jewish-Christian prophets. However, al-ûlâ may as well be understood as “\u0002rst” in the general sense of “from early times,” as is often the case in the Qur\u0002ân. This seems to be the more likely interpretation. It would de\u0002ne al jâhilîyah al-ûlâ rather noncommittally as “previous jâhilîyah” (where jâhilîyah could be “igno-rant persons”). It suggests, however, the placing of al-jâhilîyah into a more remote past than is required by the context of the other three passages.The preceding discussion makes it extremely unlikely that the term jâhilîyah owes its origin to an attempted loan translation of a concept such as the agnoia of Acts 17:30.25 Some notion akin to agnoia was no doubt in the mind of Mu\bammad when he used the word, and the later understanding of jâhilîyah is in agreement with the sentiment expressed in the passage of the New Testament. But agnoia would hardly have appeared in Arabic in such a peculiar type of noun formation. Jahl or the like would have been used.Jâhilîyah, it seems, was readily acceptable and understandable to the Prophet’s contemporaries as a collective plural. Even so, it appears to have been used by the Prophet with peculiar forceful-ness. This would suggest that some more speci\u0002c and meaningful connotation was concealed behind the term. Such special signi-\u0002cance might have accrued to the term through its connection with the famous Jewish concept of gâlû\u000b, gâlû\u000bâ “exile, diaspora.”26 Jâhilîyah may represent the Jewish word assimilated by the Prophet to the common Arabic root j-h-l. This need not have occurred very early in his career, nor must it have taken place at any de\u0002nable juncture of his life, since employment of the widely known Jewish 25 Cf. Horovitz, Koranische Untersuchungen, 61 f.26 Later Jewish scholars, among them Maimonides, did not forego the temptation of connecting jâhilîyah with gâlû\u000b. This in no way con\u0002rms the theory suggested here, nor does it justify increased scepticism with regard to it as may \u0003ow from the realization that medieval scholars, even the greatest among them, were fancifully perverse in nearly all their etymological speculations.For the term gâlû\u000b as a possible in\u0003uence on the Qur\u0002ânic transformation of Goliath into Jâlût, cf.

The af\u0002nity between gâlû\u000b as conceived by the Jews and jâhilîyah as it was possibly understood by Mu\bammad is readily observable. In the Mishnâh, Âbô\u000b V, 9, it is stated that “exile” comes into the world as a result of idolatry, unchastity (incest), and bloodshed. It is a punishment for these sins. On the other hand, these sins are not wiped out and nulli\u0002ed by “exile.” “Exile” remains a situ-ation in which they continue to \u0003ourish and from which, it seems, the land itself may have to suffer because of the sins of its inhabitants.27 Thus, gâlû\u000b stands for the very qualities of savagery, immorality, and ignorance of the true God that Mu\bammad \u0002nds objectionable in the jâhilîyah. Some speci\u0002c detail to be found in Qur\u0002ân 48:26/26 further suggests a connection between gâlû\u000b and jâhilîyah. This is the occurrence in this passage of the loan word sakînah. The sakînah is said to have been sent down by God to Mu\bammad and the believers to put an end to the “\u0002erceness of al-jâhilîyah.” It so happens that in Jewish literature, the sh\u0007\u0018înâh is also mentioned in connection with the sins of the “exile.” As long as Israel practices those sins, the sh\u0007\u0018înâh is said to keep away from the Jews.28 This agreement in detail seems striking, but in view of the frequency with which the term sh\u0007\u0018înâh is employed in Judaism, its use in connection with both gâlû\u000b and jâhilîyah may be due to coincidence, and not too much should be made of it. However, all the dif\u0002culties surrounding the Qur\u0002ânic usage of jâhilîyah would disappear, and a new dimension be added to the word, if it can be considered as having been formed by Mu\bammad through a process of mentally and verbally adapting the Jewish concept of “exile” with its sinful, godless behavior to the “ignorance” of those ignorant men who did not acknowledge and believe in his message.5. Wisdom and KnowledgeThe outstanding position accorded to \u0002ilm in the Qur\u0002ân led to the practical elimination of \u0003ikmah “wisdom” as something superior to knowledge and, indeed, as a serious rival of it. In the Judaeo-Christian Oriental tradition, a distinction between “wisdom” 27 Cf. Si\u0019\u0005\u001arâ 86c, on Leviticus 18:28. I owe this reference to Judah Goldin.28 Cf.

Syrian Christian philosophers de\u0002ned “knowledge as the exact understanding of things through cognitive discernment,” whereas “wisdom was the good administration of knowledge.” Consequently, they said, “every wisdom is at the same time know-ledge, but not every knowledge is at the same time wisdom.”29 In the West, the distinction between “wisdom” and “knowledge” is in part a Semitic heritage, but it also gained much from the linguistic situation in Greek and Latin, both of which possessed two distinct words rivaling for greater recognition (sophia-epistêmê and sapientia-scientia). Christian theology gave further impetus to putting “wisdom” on a pedestal high above “knowledge” where it has remained to our days, celebrated in innumerable disquisitions poetry and prose. It was Augustine who took Cicero’s de\u0002nition of “wisdom” as “the knowledge of things human and divine (and their causes)”30 and proposed the thesis that “wisdom is properly called the knowledge of things divine, whereas the term ‘knowledge’ is properly applied to the knowledge of things human.”31 In God, however, there exists no distinction between “wisdom” and 29 Cf. G. Furlani, “Il Libro delle De\u0002nizioni e Divisioni” di Michele l’Interprete, 70, 121, and, for parallel texts, 178 (Rome 1926, Atti della R. Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Memorie, Cl. sc. mor., stor. e \u0002lol. 6, 2).30 Cf. Cicero, Tusculanae disputationes, IV, 26, 57, and De of\u0002ciis, l, 2, 5. A Greek version attributed to Basilius reads, Sophia esti epistêmê theiôn kai anthrôpinôn pragmatôn kai tôn toutois aitiôn, cf. Antonius Melissa, 797 f. See also al-Fârâbî, Aphorisms of the Statesman, ed., trans. D. M. Dunlop, 34 (Cambridge 1961). “Wisdom is the knowledge of remote causes. . . .”Sophia “wisdom” was replaced by falsafah “philosophy” in the beginning of the Arabic translation of Pseudo-Plutarch’s Placita. Muslims thus knew “the knowledge of things divine and human” as the Stoic de\u0002nition of philosophy, cf. H. Daiberg, Die arabische Übersetzung der Placita Philosophorum, 123 f., 508 ff. (Saarbrücken 1968, doctoral disserta-tion). Cf. also Miskawayh, Tahdhîb al-akhlâq, ed. Q. Zurayq, 18 (Beirut 1966).From the point of view of later Muslim developments, it is, however, not without interest to observe that Neo-Pythagoreanism in the person of Archytas considered “knowledge” (epistâmâ) the comprehensive term which included the “wisdom” (sophia) of matters divine and the “understanding” ( phronâsis) of human and material things. The virtues depending upon reason and proof must be called “sciences” (epistâmâ in the plural). Cf. Stobaeus, Florilegium, ed. C. Wachsmuth and O. Hense, III, 63 (1884–1912, reprint Berlin 1958).31 Cf. St. Augustine, De trinitate, in Migne, Patrologia Latina, 42, 1037 (Book 14, ch. 1, 3), as discussed by E. F.

This happened in the case of a passage of the New Testament possessing great theological signi\u0002cance. The designation of Christ as “the power of God and the wisdom of God” in 1 Cor. 1:24 resulted in an Arabic translation speaking of qudrah and \u0002ilm. This suggested to Muslim theologians the problem of the essential attributes of God as they had become accustomed to consider them.33 \tikmah was in a way a neutral and colorless term, and its use here would have been almost meaningless for them.Another factor was operative in assigning “wisdom” a backseat to “knowledge.” The root \u0003-k-m, which in other Semitic languages had long ago come to convey the idea of “wisdom,” expresses juridical and administrative/political activity in Arabic. It has been correctly suggested that \u0003ikmah “wisdom,” \u0003akîm “wise,” and any derivation from the root that seems to imply “wisdom” owe their existence to foreign in\u0003uence.34 One-half of the passages in which \u0003ikmah occurs in the Qur\u0002ân mention the word in connection with “the book.” Thus, they obviously attribute to \u0003ikmah some speci\u0002c, if not clearly de\u0002ned, religious meaning within the frame-work of the divine revelation. There is some logic, although it is of the fanciful variety, in the approach of ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î who on the 32 Cf. St. Augustine, De diversis quaestionibus ad Simplicianum, in Migne, Patrologia Latina, 40, 140 (Book 2, chs. 2, 3), quoted by D. Kaufmann, Geschichte der Attributenlehre, 27, n. 55 (Gotha 1877).For \u0003Îsâ b. Zur\u0003ah, “knowledge” is subsumed under “wisdom.” Therefore, among the three attributes of God ( jawâd, \u0003akîm, and qâdir), \u0003akîm also takes care of \u0002âlim, cf. P. Sbath, Vingt traités, 12 (Cairo 1929).33 Cf. Ibn \u0004azm, Fi\u0015al, I, 51 (Cairo 1317–21). I have no way of knowing how the various Christian Arabic translations handled the passage.

Yet, the \u0003ukm which according the Qur\u0002ân was given to the prophets might have been conceived rather as worldly author-ity, regardless of the fact that it also occurs paired with \u0002ilm (12:22/22, etc.). The “wisdom” of man—and of God to whom the attribute \u0003akim is often applied—was certainly something highly signi\u0002cant in the reli-gious view of the world held by the Prophet. However, since the original Arabic root meaning of \u0003-k-m suggested a different range of notions and since \u0003ikmah/\u0003ukm in certain combinations appears to have been restricted to some speci\u0002c meanings, \u0003ikmah/\u0003ukm never attained a posi-tion where it might have had to compete seriously with the much more \u0002rmly entrenched \u0002ilm for a leading role in the Qur\u0002ân and in later Islam. Actually, \u0003ikmah and \u0002ilm became mere synonyms for most Muslims.36 If a distinction was made, \u0003ikmah usually came after \u0002ilm. This is well exem-pli\u0002ed by a passage from the Kitâb al-\tuqûq of al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî who declares that “God brought forth knowledge (\u0002ilm) in the begin-ning. From knowledge He brought forth wisdom (\u0003ikmah). From wisdom He brought forth justice (\u0002adl ) and truth (\u0003aqq), etc.”37 It would seem that it was in this sense that the ûfî, al-Fu\rayl b. \u0003Iyâ\r (d. 187/803), expressed the view that scholars were numerous, but of sages there were few, and he considered it more appropriate to call the sages, rather than the scholars, the heirs of the prophets.38Naturally, the meaning of \u0003ikmah and its relationship to \u0002ilm were often discussed. Ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî expressed a very 35 Cf. ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î, Risâlah, 32 (Cairo 1358/1940), trans. M. Khadduri, 75 (Baltimore 1961); J.

The subordinate posi-tion of \u0003ikmah after \u0002ilm and \u0002aql is further indicated by the author’s def-inition of \u0003ikmah as “hitting upon the truth by means of knowledge and intelligence.” According to him, \u0003ikmah on the part of God is God’s knowledge about (ma\u0002rifah)39 matters and their most effective creation. On the part of human beings, it is knowledge about exist-ing things and doing what is good. Or, as he states in another pas-sage, \u0003ikmah on the part of God is the manifestation of all bounties in the realm of the intelligibilia as well as the realm of the sensibilia (i\u0012hâr al-fa\u000eâ\b\u0005il al-ma\u0002qûlah wa-l-ma\u0003sûsah). On the part of man, it is his recognition (ma\u0002rifah) of that as much as is humanly possible.40 Whatever it is, the position of \u0003ikmah is noticeably inferior here to that generally attributed to \u0002ilm. However, it should not be forgotten that the true ethical behavior in Islam was represented by the combination of knowledge and action.41 In this context, wisdom was, it seems, occasion-ally valued more highly than knowledge. For the ûfî Yûsuf ar-Râzî (d. 304/916–17), “education (adab) makes possible the understanding of knowledge, knowledge provides for correct action, action secures wis-dom,” and from there on, the individual can steadily progress through asceticism to the grace of God.42 For the tenth-century Ismâ\u0003îlî, Abû \u0004âtim ar-Râzî, the wise man is the one who combines knowledge and action.43 In the preceding century, the philosopher al-Kindî had de\u0002ned wisdom as “the excellence of the (rational) power, the knowledge of the universals in their realities, and the employment (in action) of the realities that must be employed.”44 All these attempts to give “wisdom” 39 The root \u0002-r-f is stricto sensu not applicable to God, as ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî himself states elsewhere, cf. below, p. 114, n. 2, but also p. 113.40 Cf. ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî, Mufradât, I, 276, s. rad. \u0003-k-m, and the same author’s Tafsîr, as quoted on fol. 1a of the Istanbul Ms. Carullah 2080, which was written in Konya in 791/1389.41 Cf.

In the same breath, however, he also proclaims that “Knowledge is the gift of the Creator, and wisdom His present,” making no distinction between knowledge and wisdom.45 In the verses of Ibn Sînâ:The soul is like a glass lamp, and knowledgeIs light (-giving \u0002re), and the wisdom of God is the oil.If it is lit, you are alive,And if it is darkened, you are dead,46the position of “the wisdom of God” is in no way superior to “knowl-edge.” Presumably, it must be interpreted as divine inspiration being the equivalent of acquired knowledge. In any case, no matter how meaning-ful the term \u0003ikmah “philosophy” was for Muslim philosophers, its use in this special sense implied another restriction in meaning as compared to \u0002ilm which by that time was anyhow \u0002rmly entrenched as the dominant concept. The use of \u0003ikmah to designate philosophy made the fate of the term also greatly dependent on that of philosophy in Islam. It even became a term of opprobrium in the eyes of those who were strongly opposed to what they considered philosophy. On the other hand, the philosophers in turn were not able or willing to retaliate by putting any strictures on their part on the use of \u0002ilm. Thus, \u0002ilm was never placed in a position where it had to defend against \u0003ikmah the preeminence bestowed upon it by the Qur\u0002ân.45 Cf. al-Mubashshir, Mukhtâr al-\u0003ikam, ed. \u0003Abd-ar-Ra\bmân Badawî, 199 (Madrid 1958).46 Quoted in G.

No passage in pre-Islamic poetry where the plural \u0002ulûm occurs can be cited. This is negative evidence. It does not suf\u0002ce to prove that \u0002ulûm was not in use originally and that it constitutes a neologism of early Islamic, but otherwise uncertain, date. However, the possibility exists that this was actually the case. Until further evidence is forthcoming, such an assumption would seem to be rather probable. Modern English “knowledge” does not normally admit of a plural formation. However, the word was used in the plural in times past.1 Correspondingly, \u0002ulûm might have once existed but then lain dormant until it gained wide currency in Islamic times. Thus, if any early instances of the use of \u0002ulûm should ever show up, the situation as it exists in English may serve as a kind of analogy t hat could help to make it clear that the mere occurrence of the formation does not invalidate the conclusions presented in this chapter.Greek and Latin simply formed a plural for the respective abstract notions in these languages indicating “knowledge,” in order to obtain a general designation for the diverse concrete forms knowledge might take. In modern English, “knowledge” was retained to express the over-all abstract concept, whereas other terms came to be employed for the general designation of “sciences” and “disciplines.” This was the result of the peculiar history of the English language. It is more in the nature of a special case, rare if not unique in its kind.Arabic possesses a comprehensive abstract notion of “knowl-edge” (\u0002ilm), as we have seen. At \u0002rst, it was used without any thought of classi\u0002able variety in the sense of later specialized scholarship. 1 Cf. The Oxford English Dictionary, V, 148b (Oxford 1933, 1961). “Those ingenuous knowledges” appears in 1627 in E. Bolton’s The Cabanet Royal, cf. T. H. Blackburn, in Studies in the Renaissance, XIV (1967), 168. For the general problem, cf. also B. Halpern, “Myth” and “Ideology” in Modern Usage, in History and Theory, I (1961), 130, n. 3: “In con-trast [to opinion and theory], ‘knowledge’ is not used at all in the plural. Thus, it refers essentially to an isolated (abstract) relationship of a subject and an object, and is never used for plural or alternative relationships of subjects and objects.”rosenthal_f5_41-45.indd Sec1:4110/17/2006 2:16:29 PM"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"42 the plural of knowledgeAmong the Prophetic traditions, we \u0002nd some instances of \u0002ilm being used without the de\u0002nite article in contexts suggesting that some indi-vidual knowledge, and not the totality of knowledge, is meant. Thus, we have, for instance, traditions such as these: “He who is asked about a knowledge but keeps it concealed . . .,” or: “He who follows a path seeking there a knowledge . . .”2 A chapter heading at the beginning of al-Bukhârî’s \u001ba\u0003î\u0003 reading, “He who is asked for a knowledge . . .,” clearly refers to inquiries about individual points concerning religious matters. However, there is always a great discrepancy between the con-stant appearance of \u0002ilm in al-Bukhârî’s chapter headings and the almost complete absence of it in the words put into the mouth of the Prophet.3 Whatever signi\u0002cance may be ascribed here to the use of \u0002ilm as special-ized knowledge, we are not justi\u0002ed in assuming that we are dealing with a usage dating from the time of the Prophet.The use of \u0002ilm as a specialized discipline appears to be attested in a verse of Kuthayyir \u0003Azzah (d. 105/723):I went to the Banû Lihb seeking al-\u0002ilm with them,Since the \u0002ilm of those who practice augury has been entrusted to them.4Here it looks as if augury is designated as a separate discipline within the general domain of knowledge. Unfortunately, however, there exists another version of the verse which does not contain the crucial second \u0002ilm but replaces it with a reference to “the augury of those who know.” This shows once more how little trust can be placed in the evidence Arabic poems furnish for the 2 Cf. Abû Dâwûd, Sunan, III, 234–41 (Cairo 1310, in the margin of az-Zurqânî, Shar\u0003 al-Muwa\u000f\u000fa\b\u0005), and at-Tirmidhî (with the Commentary of Ibn al-\u0003Arabî), \u001ba\u0003î\u0003, X, 118, 115 (Cairo 1353/1934).3 Cf. below, p. 83.4 Cf.

We can only speculate that this must have been quite early. It would, indeed, seem likely that at the beginning, there was the idea of “an \u0002ilm” constituting a distinctive part of the vast realm of religion conceived as knowledge and concerning individual points of religious law or theology and that this meant the starting point for the use of \u0002ilm as the designation for science or scholarly discipline. As always when we are dealing with the formative stages of Muslim civilization after the Qur\u0002ân, neat chronological sequences cannot be established. Elements of all the later strains, such as theological theory, mystical speculation, Greek philosophical thought, and educational method, were ready to in\u0002ltrate Islam as soon as contact with areas more deeply steeped in contemporary civilization was made, if they had not been present already in the central Arabian home of Islam. A certain general acquaintance with the basic forms of intellectual life prevalent in the conquered territories could not have failed to make its presence felt almost immediately after the Muslim Conquest. There must have been an awareness of the fact that “knowledge” existed in a number of separate disciplines, that there was not only one \u0002ilm but a number of \u0002ulûm.\u0002Ilm thus assumed another dimension in addition to the two that were indicated by the prehistory of the term and by the role it played in the thinking of the Prophet. \u0002Ilm can be some individual item of information, or a totality made up of a number of items of infor-mation. The plural \u0002ulûm did, in fact, serve later on occasionally to express also the plurality of a number of things known (ma\u0002lûm, ma\u0002lûmât) in the language of philosophy and speculative theology. It is also in this sense that, for instance, Ibn \u0003Arabî, in his Futû\u0003ât, speaks of an in\u0002nite, number of \u0002ulûm. \u0002Ilm can be the absolute totality of all that can be known and can be done and is worth being known and being done. And, as we see, now, \u0002ilm can be one of the numerous sections of total knowledge that admit of systematic organization in the form of scien-ti\u0002c disciplines.All three dimensions of knowledge continued to live on independ-ently and in a kind of interplay which determined the essence and rosenthal_f5_41-45.indd Sec1:4310/17/2006 2:16:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"44 the plural of knowledgeforms of Muslim civilization. The notion of knowledge as the sum of individual items loosely strung together re-appeared later on in Islam and showed itself in the preference accorded to a disjunctive juxta-position of individual data as against a continuous and integrated exposition.5 It can also be assumed to have contributed to the grow-ing tendency of constantly adding to the number of what was consid-ered to constitute independent scienti\u0002c disciplines, until they reached the number of 150, or even 316, according to the classi\u0002cation of the sixteenth-century \u0005âshköprüzâdeh.6 On the other hand, the notion of one indivisible knowledge raised the question whether the indi-vidual disciplines could in fact claim individual lives of their own or whether they were in no way essentially different from “knowledge” as a whole. The second alternative ultimately won out, favored as it was by philosophical considerations no less than by the Qur\u0002ânic equation of knowledge with faith and religion. Essentially, all the sciences and all the crafts do not differ greatly from each other; their apparent differences concern only details and \u0002ne points.7 The attitude underlying this view may be turned into a plea for an inten-sive, non-discriminatory cultivation of all recognized branches of learning. All \u0002ulûm must be considered interdependent. Therefore, it would be foolish to cultivate one and neglect the others, for the pur-pose of all of them alike is man’s salvation.8 On the other hand, as a result of the general trend toward considering “knowledge” as one with Islam, all \u0002ulûm tended to become one particular \u0002ilm representing both the totality of knowledge and its systematization. The preferred \u0002ilm to serve this purpose was the \u0002ilm “that was inherited from the Prophet.” Everything else is either useless or not an \u0002ilm at all, even if it is called by that name.9 Other disciplines might claim to be the \u0002ilm, but the iden-ti\u0002cation of the totality and speci\u0002city of “knowledge” with religious knowledge was predominant.5 Cf. above, p. 12.6 Cf. \u0005âshköprüzâdeh, Miftâ\u0003\u0005\u001d\u001e\u001a\u001e\u001d\u0002âdah, I, 68 f.

Remarkably enough, however, there is a passage in al-Jâ\bi\u000e that comes quite close to making this point. It was suggested to al-Jâ\bi\u000e that the willingness of the Manichaeans to spend a great amount of money on the luxurious production of their books indicated a venera-tion for knowledge. Al-Jâ\bi\u000e denied this. Since the Manichaean books deal with their religion, spending money on them is comparable to the Christians spending money on their churches and on crosses of gold, to the Zoroastrians spending money on their \u0002re temples, and to the Indians spending money on the guardians of their Buddha statues. It would be different, if the Manichaeans were concerned with knowledge and philosophy and were spending their efforts on works of philosophy and logic10 or on works dealing with the crafts, commerce, technology, or educational literature. Then one could speak of a veneration for “knowledge.”11 Al-Jâ\bi\u000e would have vehemently repudiated any sugges-tion that his strictures applied with equal force to Muslim religious writ-ings. He had no doubt to admit that they constituted true knowledge. Yet, it looks as if in his innermost heart, he did indeed feel that religious knowledge was basically different from secular knowledge and that only the latter was deserving of the name. Such an attitude was destined not to survive by much the time of al-Jâ\bi\u000e.In given passages of Muslim literature, it is often dif\u0002cult to be certain whether the use of the term \u0002ilm is meant to refer to knowledge both secular and religious, or only to the latter kind. It is also often dif\u0002cult to decide whether \u0002ilm is meant to denote abstract “knowledge” or the singular of \u0002ulûm, the individual discipline. In the Muslim mind, these distinctions rarely if ever loomed as important as they do in our own way of thinking. This by itself is a characteristic aspect of the Muslim concept of \u0002ilm in general and of the Muslim approach to its plural in which abstract knowledge \u0002nds its concrete expression.10 The following three words are not quite clear, perhaps, “laws and rhetoric”(?).11 Cf. al-Jâ\bi\u000e, \tayawân, I, 28 f. (Cairo 1323–25) = I, 55 f. (Cairo 1356/1958).

Philosophy and philology demanded them. û\u0002sm, with its willful assignment of meanings to terms and terms to meanings, was par-ticularly fond of them. Such de\u0002nitions always present an instructive cross section of the various views held in connection with a given topic. For a proper understanding, they require explanation and elaboration, but often they strip away the layers of obfuscation created by lengthy expositions. A perusal of a large number of de\u0002nitions of “knowledge” is a helpful introduction to the discussion contained in the following chapters. In a brief compass, it anticipates a good deal of what can be expected to be found there.Collections of de\u0002nitions were not infrequently made by medi-eval scholars in various \u0002elds of scholarly activity. The mystic philo-sopher, Ibn Sab\u0003în (d. 669/1270), brought together an extensive and rather mixed batch of de\u0002nitions of “knowledge” in his Budd al-\u0002ârif.1 However, it was speculative theology that passionately sought after a satisfying brief de\u0002nition of \u0002ilm. Philosophers knew that no brief de\u0002nition would do for them. Philologians had no need to consider the problems behind the seemingly plain meaning of the term, and they were naturally followed in this respect by the educators. Mystics were rather slow in working \u0002ilm into their particular vocabulary as a special term. But theology had a fundamental stake in the explanation of what “knowledge” really meant and of \u0002nding an acceptable de\u0002nition for it that1 I used the Istanbul manuscript Bagdath Vehbi Ef. 833, fols. 66a–67b, 74a, and 85a. The de\u0002nitions have been numbered by me, and the number in brackets following the title of the work refers to this numbering. A few de\u0002nitions of knowledge are also mentioned in Ibn Sab\u0003în’s \u0002Ahd which he addressed to his pupils, ed. \u0003Abd-ar-Ra\bmân Badawî, in Revista del Instituto Egipcio de Estudios Islámicos, V (1957), 41. In the \u0002Ahd, Ibn Sab\u0003în refers to his large collection of de\u0002nitions from the Budd. M. Schreiner, in ZDMG, LII (1898), 504, n. 1, indicates that he was aware of the Budd. N. Rescher, The Development of Arabic Logic, 201 (Pittsburgh 1964), mentions a doctoral dissertation by S. Lator, Die Logik des Ibn Sab\u0002\u0005în (Munich and Rome 1942), which I have not seen.rosenthal_f6_46-69.indd Sec1:4610/17/2006 2:17:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"would apply to God and man, to faith and to reason. It thus was the home and focal point for Muslim de\u0002nitions of “knowledge.” The basic guidelines for the phrasing of these de\u0002nitions can be assumed to have been operative at the very beginnings of kalâm and to have produced a small set of de\u0002nitions which remained fundamentally unchanged but in minor rewordings provided an outlet for intellectual creativity. As it happened, some powerful personalities such as al-Ash\u0003arî (around 900) or al-Bâqillânî (d. 403/1013) incorporated one or the other de\u0002nition in their teaching or their writings, and their names thereafter became attached to it, providing one of those useful classifying labels that are always much valued by philosophical and theological system-makers. The names of the original coiners of the Arabic form of a given def-inition of \u0002ilm and their dates in history can, it seems, no longer be recovered except through uncritical reliance on later tradition. Even the authorship of such important distinctions as the insistence upon sukûn an-nafs generally credited to the Mu\u0003tazilah (see below, F-3) can hardly be pinned down with any amount of certainty. The early ninth century appears to be a good general date for the completion of the \u0002rst stage in the history of these de\u0002nitions.No handbook on speculative theology large or small could avoid going into a discussion of the de\u0002nitions of \u0002ilm. In the course of time, the material to be discussed grew, and the form which this discussion had to take hardened. By the turn of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the high point of this development had been reached. The authoritative collection of de\u0002nitions of \u0002ilm to serve the purposes of speculative theology was made by al-Âmidî (d. 631/1233). In the opening pages of his great Abkâr al-afkâr, al-Âmidî reported and discussed these de\u0002nitions thoroughly.2 Predecessors of al-Âmidî on a smaller scale were such important scholars as the 2 Among other manuscripts, I used the Istanbul manuscript Aya Sofya 2165 (the second volume of the work bears the number 2166). Both volumes exhibit the signature of \u0003Abd-al-Wahhâb as-Subkî with the date of 763/1361–62 at the bottom right of their respective title-pages. The title-page of the second volume, at the top left, has preserved the signature of a former owner, Khalîl b. Kaykaldî al-\u0003Alâ\u0002î, who had died two years before as-Subkî put his name to the volumes. Another manuscript of the work, Aya Sofya 2167, is dated in 771/March 16, 1370. Its second volume, Aya Sofya 2168, is dated in 772/September 1370. The Abkâr was completed in 612/April 1216. Some de\u0002nitions of knowledge which al-Âmidî considered acceptable were also discussed by him at some length in his I\u0003kâm fî u\u0015ûl al-a\u0003kâm, I, 6 f.

The Abkâr served as the prin-cipal source for the discussion of the subject to be found a century later in the Mawâqif of al-Îjî (d. 756/1355).6 Al-Îjî, in turn, furnished practi-cally all the essential raw material that went into the exhaustive article on \u0002ilm from at-Tahânawî’s Kashshâf, 1055–66, of the mid-eighteenth century. It can fairly be said that at-Tahânawî there summarized all the ideas ever expressed by Muslim thinkers on “knowledge.”An understandable reaction against the presumptuousness of man who claimed to be able to reduce to capsule form something that spanned the world of man and God makes itself felt in the repeated suggestion that no de\u0002nition of “knowledge” was, in fact, possible. This suggestion was discussed, for instance, by al-Ghazzâlî7 as well as al-Âmidî (in both the Abkâr and the I\u0003kâm). Knowledge cannot be verbally de\u0002ned because it is too dif\u0002cult and complicated for simple de\u0002nition; it can be de\u0002ned only through disjunction (qis-mah) and example (mithâl ) (Imâm al-\u0004aramayn and al-Ghazzâlî).8 Or, as stated by Fakhr-ad-dîn ar-Râzî (d. 606/1209), the knowledge of knowledge must be intuitive (badîhî) or necessary (\u000earûrî ); if it were nei-ther, circular reasoning would result, since de\u0002nition is possible only through knowledge.9 Al-Âmidî’s attitude in this respect will be reported 3 Cf.

He denied the impossibility of a de\u0002nition proposed on these two grounds: “1. Anything outside knowledge is revealed only through knowledge; thus, it is impossible for anything other than knowledge to reveal knowledge. And 2. I know necessarily that I am knowing through my existence, which is a special knowledge preceded by the perception of knowledge absolute. Now, some thorough scholars have objected to the \u0002rst argument that the information desired from a de\u0002nition of knowl-edge is the knowledge of knowledge. It is not absurd to assume that it (i.e., knowledge) reveals something else, and something else reveals the knowledge of it (i.e., knowledge). I say: When we say, for instance, that knowledge is an attribute requiring one’s own satisfaction (sukûn an-nafs), such a statement de\u0002nes knowledge, but this is recognized only through knowledge. Thus, we might have an occurrence of circular reasoning. Here, the correct view, as you should know, is that knowledge is either a relative (i\u000eâfîyah) attribute subsisting in the knower (see below, A-14), or a form corresponding to the object known (see below, E-1), accord-ing to the two different views and twin assumptions (that is, general accepted alternatives). The object known is known only when that form is present or that attribute comes to the knower. Knowledge of that attribute or that form, through de\u0002nition or indication (rasm),11 belongs to what is not known. But the object known rests upon knowledge in the \u0002rst instance in a way different from the way in which knowledge of that form rests upon de\u0002nition or indication. Thus, there is no circular reasoning. The second argument is weak. We have shown its weakness in the Kitâb Ma\u0002ârij al-fahm ‘The Degrees of Understanding’ (which is preserved but as other works of the \u0003Allâmah al-\u0004illî important for our subject is unfortunately not accessible).”1210 See below, p. 225.11 Rasm is a de\u0002nition consisting of a brief designation of a distinctive char-acteristic of the object de\u0002ned, whereas \u0003add, the technical term for de\u0002nition, is a de\u0002nition describing the nature of the object de\u0002ned, cf.

Knowledge can dispense with a de\u0002nition, for whatever recognizes a thing is able to recognize its being cognizant of that thing without logical proof and speculation. Knowledge that one knows a thing stands for knowledge of one’s essence having the attribute (itti\u0015âf ) of knowledge. Now, knowledge of the attribution of a complete process (itti\u0015âf amr tâmm) calls for the knowledge of each of the two things, that is, the object (maw\u0015ûf ) and the attribute (\u0015ifah). If the knowledge of the reality of knowledge were acquired, it would be absurd to assume that our knowing a thing could be known with-out speculation and deductive reasoning. As this is not so, it is estab-lished that the knowledge of the reality of knowledge dispenses with acquisition.”13Mystics also may at times feel repelled by the thought of de\u0002ning knowledge. Thus, al-Qônawî (d. 672/1273) brands someone who attempts to de\u0002ne “knowledge” as either ignorant of the true meaning (sirr) of knowledge or being a gnostic desirous to indicate his position with regard to some of the attributes of knowledge while not intend-ing to give a complete de\u0002nition.14 He had in mind the true knowledge of the mystic, which is the only knowledge he recognizes as such and which he in fact de\u0002nes in another of his works in terms of a general de\u0002nition of knowledge (see below, L-5).Where all theological endeavors that smacked of philosophical speculation were in ill repute, as they were with later traditionalist scholars, we also hear it said that the efforts to de\u0002ne “knowledge” were nothing but nefarious attempts made by anti-religious indi-viduals for the purpose of confusing an issue that was clear and obvious. Ibn al-\u0003Arabî (d. 543/1148) expressed this idea in his commentary on the \u001ba\u0003î\u0003 of at-Tirmidhî in these words: “Knowl-edge is too clear a concept to require an explanation, but here-tical innovators have wished to complicate the understanding of the 13 Cf. the Bursa Ms. Ulu Cami 2211, fol. 115b.

However, these are baseless claims and sophistries.”15Nevertheless, there were many de\u0002nitions, and the process of pol-ishing and discussing them never stopped. The classi\u0002cation of these de\u0002nitions in the list that follows is neither historical nor in accordance with categories that might have been used by Muslim scholars them-selves. It attempts to arrange the de\u0002nitions according to what seems to be their most essential elements, even at the risk of separating what should rather remain together, or of restricting to one class what may at the same time also belong into another. It also does not take into account the likelihood that some variations may be due to the will-ful or unintentional inaccuracy of the reporter, as in the case of Ibn \u0004azm’s discussion of Ash\u0003arite de\u0002nitions. (A classi\u0002cation accord-ing to essential elements was, however, considered appropriate also by Muslim theologians, as shown by Judge \u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr’s discussion in the twelfth part of his Mughnî dealing with epistemology. \u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr has many trenchant observations on the de\u0002nitions listed below under B, C, D, F, and H. The Cairo edition of this volume of the Mughnî by Ibrâhîm Madkour is not dated and became available to me only in the beginning of 1969.)Summarily, it may be said that most of the de\u0002nitions are based on the assumption that the explanation of a subjective mental (psychologi-cal) process in its relationship to the objective, the mastery of concrete data, somehow suf\u0002ces to grasp the nature of knowledge. It seems to have been considered an established fact that the object known (ma\u0002lûm) is prior to knowledge; this, as Muslim thinkers were well aware, was a problem discussed by Aristotle in his logic. Quite a few of the de\u0002ni-tions suggested rely on some kind of tautology and do not in effect shed any true light on the problem, as was already pointed out by Muslim critics. Further clari\u0002cation will be found in a later chapter where the commentary of al-Âmidî is translated (below, pp. 220 ff.).15 Cf.

It is, however, clear that al-Bâqillânî was not the \u0002rst to use it.The last word of the de\u0002nition (bih) is exceptionally replaced by \u0002alayh.34 This appears to be a mere oversight. In the Budd, this de\u0002nition occurs also at the very beginning of the list of de\u0002nitions, but without either bih or \u0002alayh. It is dif\u0002cult to say whether this omission is another mistake just as Ibn Sab\u0003în’s subsequent use of \u0002alayh for bih, or whether it was intended to be another meaningful variant.In connection with this de\u0002nition, certain Greek de\u0002nitions of “phi-losophy” are relevant. Nicomachus of Gerasa, in his Arithmêtikê Eisagôgê as translated into Arabic by Thâbit b. Qurrah, ed. Kutsch, 13, ll. 8 f., says that “wisdom (\u0003ikmah, translating “philosophy”) is the certain knowledge of the reality (\u0003aqîqah) of the existing things as they are.” John of Damascus gives a de\u0002nition of philosophy which appears to be the exact Greek equivalent of this particular de\u0002nition of knowledge and is likely to have been its prototype. He speaks of philosophy as “cognition of the existing things qua existing things” ( gnôsis tôn ontôn hêi onta estin).35It may be added that a late author, al-\u0003Aynî, in his \u0002Umdat al-qârî, I, 247, de\u0002nes “wisdom” as “the cognition of things as they are,” but for al-\u0003Aynî, I, 440, “wisdom” is a synonym of “knowledge.”3. “Knowledge is the cognition of a thing (ash-shay\b\u0005) as it is.”36 As compared to the preceding de\u0002nition, “object known” is 34 Cf. Ibn Sab\u0003în, Budd (17) (Ms. Bagdath Vehbi Ef. 833, fol. 74a), describing this de\u0002nition as the one preferred by Ash\u0003arites.It may be noted that \u0002alâ ma hvwa \u0002alayh was used to translate Greek hyparchein, cf. the Arabic translation of the Aristotelian Physics 197a29, ed. \u0003Abd-ar-Ra\bmân Badawî, 125 (Cairo 1384-85/1964-65).35 Cf. John of Damascus, Pêgê gnôseôs, in Migne, Patrologia Graeca, 94, 521, Engl. trans. F. H. Chase, 11 (New York 1958).According to the Jâbir corpus, “philosophical knowledge is the knowledge of the realities of the caused existing things,” cf. P. Kraus, Jâbir ibn \tayyân, Textes choisis, 104 (Paris and Cairo 1935).36 Al-Bâqillânî, Tamhîd, 6, and al-Bazdawî discuss and reject this de\u0002nition; al-Ghazzâlî, I\u0003yâ\b, I, 26. English trans.

Use of the term “thing,” it is argued, excludes knowledge of the non-existent. The non-existent is one of the possible objects of knowl-edge. Therefore, it ought to be covered by a de\u0002nition that ful\u0002lls the required condition of comprehensiveness. It is, as soon as “object known” is used instead of “thing.” Cf. also below, C-2 and D-2.4. “Knowledge is certain cognition (tayaqqun) of a thing as it is.”375. “Knowledge is the cognition of things and their realities (\u0003aqâ\biq) without mistake or error.”38 Cf. below, C-12.6. “Knowledge is the cognition of the object known to one’s own sat-isfaction (ma\u0002a sukûn an-nafs).”39 For sukûn an-nafs as a Mu\u0003tazilah modi\u0002-cation, cf. below, F-3.7. “Knowledge is the cognition of the cause of the object known as being a cause of that particular object known.”40 This de\u0002nition is stated to go back to Alexander of Aphrodisias.8. “Knowledge of a thing is the knowledge of the causes of its existence.”419. “. . . Knowledge is likewise cognition and perception, but in addi-tion, it is granting him who hears and understands room for agreement and disagreement concerning the statement made . . .”4210. “Knowledge is that which one knows for certain and understands clearly.”4311. “Knowledge is excellent cognition and the constant appli-cation to the excellent art.”44 This de\u0002nition occurs in the beginning of the Arabic translation of the Pseudo-Plutarchan Placita where the Stoics speak of philosophy as the practice of a proper art 37 Cf.

The equation of sophia or phi-losophia with virtue may have seemed to the translator an incomplete de\u0002nition of “knowledge,” and he therefore added the reference to cog-nition. This would also indicate the existence of the de\u0002nition of \u0002ilm by ma\u0002rifah in the ninth century.C. Knowledge is a process of “obtaining” (d-r-k, \u0003-\u0015-l ) or “\u0002nding” through mental perception. This re\u0003ects a Stoic de\u0002nition of knowl-edge attributed to Zeno, speaking of knowledge as katalêpsis asphalês, cf. Diogenes Laertius, VII, 47. The use of idrâk for translating Greek katalêpsis is attested in Nicomachus of Gerasa, Arithmêtikê Eisagôgê, 2, ll. 9 f. Hoche, Ar. trans., ed. Kutsch, 11, l. 10.45 Similarly, knowledge is a process of “comprehending.”1. “Knowledge is the perception (idrâk) of the object known as it is (\u0002alâ mâ huwa bih).”46 This de\u0002nition is primarily credited to al-Ash\u0003arî.2. “Knowledge is the perception of a thing as it is,”47 or, “of a thing in its reality (bi-\u0003aqîqatih).”48 For the replacement of “object known” by “thing,” cf. above, B-3.When we read in the work of a littérateur that “the intellect (\u0002aql ) is the perception of things in their realities,”49 we are forced to conclude that this statement is based upon an unthinking substitution of “intel-lect” for “knowledge.”3. “Knowledge is attaining (darak) the object perceived (mudrak) as it is (\u0002alâ mâ huwa \u0002alayh) itself, provided that attaining it is not impossible.”504. “Knowledge is the perception of the realities of things through traditional and intellectual channels (masmû\u0002an wa-ma\u0002qûlan).”5145 For other Greek equivalents of idrâk, cf. S. M. Afnan, Philosophical Terminology in Arabic and Persian, 105 f. (Leiden 1964). M. van den Bergh’s equation of katalêptos with mafhûm or ma\u0002lûm is not based upon actual occurrences in the translation literature, which remain to be found, cf. his translation of Averroes’ Tahafut al-Tahafut, II, 45, 55, 112 (Oxford and London 1954, E.

However, this would seem unlikely. “Finding,” as shown in C-7, belongs to the philosophical vocabulary in connection with “knowl-edge.” However, like the idea of comprehending, it was a term suitable to the intuitive, mystical approach toward “knowledge,” especially in combination with “heart,” “soul,” or “breast.”9. “Knowledge is the \u0002nding by the soul of its objective when suspi-cions (doubts, riyab) occur to a person concerning it ( fî amrih).”5610. “Knowledge is \u0002nding in the heart and \u0002rm conviction (thubût) without change.”5711. “Knowledge is that which comprises \u0002rm conviction without allowing for any change.”5812. “Knowledge is the comprehension (i\u0003â\u000fah) of the thing as it is (\u0002alâ mâ huwa \u0002alayh) without mistake or error.”59 Cf. above, B-5.13. “Knowledge can be described as the comprehension (i\u0003â\u000fah) 52 Cf.

Knowledge is a form (\u0015ûrah), a concept or meaning (ma\u0002nâ), a pro-cess of mental formation and imagination (ta\u0015awwur “perception”) and/or mental veri\u0002cation (ta\u0015dîq “apperception”). For knowledge as ta\u0015dîq “faith,” cf. below, p. 101, n. 3.1. “Knowledge is the form of the object known in the soul of the knower.”74 A variant has “the arrival (\u0003u\u0015ûl ) of the form,” cf. also below, E-9.2. “Knowledge is the delineation (irtisâm) of the form of the object known in the knower.”753. “The soul is originally knowing (\u0002allâmah), and knowledge is its form.”764. “Knowledge conforms fully (mu\u000fâbiq, musâwî ) to the object known, because it is the spiritual form of the object known. The difference between the two is that the object known is a form whose substratum is matter, whereas knowledge is a form whose substratum is the soul.”775. “Knowledge stands for the fact that the form of the object known has impressed itself upon the soul.”7872 Cf.

Knowledge is belief. This conception of knowledge, philosophical in origin, was basically Mu\u0003tazilah doctrine, to be refuted by the argu-ment that God could not be thought of as believing.96 A\t-âbûnî states \u0003atly that it is an assault upon the concept of God’s knowledge, since it requires Him to believe.97 The implications and pitfalls of “belief ” and sukûn an-nafs (lit., “rest of the soul”) are reviewed in great detail from the Mu\u0003tazilah point of view in the twelfth part of \u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr’s Mughnî.1. “Knowledge is the trust (thiqah) that the object known is as it is (\u0002alâ mâ huwa bih).”982. “Knowledge is believing (i\u0002tiqâd ) the thing (to be) as it is.” Both \u0002alâ mâ huwa bih99 and \u0002alâ mâ huwa \u0002alayh 100 are used.3. “Knowledge is believing a thing (to be) as it is to one’s own satis-faction (ma\u0002a sukûn an-nafs ilayh),” or, “while becoming oneself used to the object believed (ma\u0002a taw\u000fîn an-nafs ilâ l-mu\u0002taqad ).”101 95 Cf.

Abû Hilâl al-\u0003Askarî, al-Furûq al-lughawîyah, 63 (Cairo 1353), has “\u0002rmly believing” (i\u0002tiqâd . . . \u0002alâ sabîl ath-thiqah). 99 Cf. al-Ghazzâlî, Musta\u0015fâ, I, 17; al-Îjî, Mawâqif, at-Tahânawî. All these authors describe and discuss this de\u0002nition as that of the Mu\u0003tazilah. \u0003Abd-al-Qâhir, U\u0015ûl, 5, singles out al-Ka\u0003bî. Cf., further, a\t-âbûnî, Kifâyah, and Ibn Sab\u0003în, Budd (14).100 Cf. al-Âmidî, Abkâr, fol. 2 a, referring to it as the Mu\u0003tazilah de\u0002nition.101 Cf. \u0003Abd-al-Qâhir, U\u0015ûl, 5; Imâm al-\u0004aramayn, Irshâd; al-Bazdawî; al-Âmidî, Abkâr. They all mention that this is the Mu\u0003tazilah de\u0002nition. Ta w\u000fîn appears in the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn. Cf. \u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr, below, p. 211.According to al-\u0003Askarî, Furûq, 63, the presence of sukûn an-nafs and thalaj a\u0015-\u0015adr “calmness, assuredness” turns “knowledge” into “certainty.” “Certainty” appears paired with thalaj already in Prophetical traditions. For al-Kindî, “certainty” requires sukûn al-fahm, cf. Rasâ\bil al-Kindî, I, 171; Altmann-Stern, Isaac Israeli, 58. On sukûn an-nafs, see also G. Vajda, in RÉJ, CXXVI (1967), 388 f. Cf. also below, p. 169.The description of “knowledge” as “warranted belief ” (cf. W. H. Werkmeister, The Basis and Structure of Knowledge, 3, New York and London, 1948), sounds similar to this Mu\u0003tazilah de\u0002nition, which, however, thinks of subjectively warranted, and not as the modern statement, of objectively warranted.rosenthal_f6_46-69.indd Sec1:6310/17/2006 2:17:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"64 definitions of knowledge4. “Knowledge is believing a thing (to be) as it is, when it happens on the basis of necessity or proof.”1025. “Knowledge, as well as cognition (ma\u0002rifah), is believing a thing (to be) as it is, and certainty (tayaqqun) as well as the removal of any doubt concerning it.”1036. “Knowledge is believing that a thing is so, coupled with the belief that it cannot possibly be not so.”1047. “Knowledge is a de\u0002nite ( jâzim) belief that conforms to something that is necessary (al-mu\u000fâbiq li-mûjab).”1058. “Knowledge is de\u0002nitive and \u0002rm (thâbit) belief that conforms to actuality (al-mu\u000fâbiq li-l-wâqi\u0002\u0005).”106G.

There is no need to suggest correcting tadhkîr to tadhakkur. Ibn Bâjjah, Fî n-nafs, refers to Socrates as having assumed that knowledge is remembrance ( ya\u000ea\u0002u l-\u0002ilma tadhakkuran), cf. the Berlin Ms. Wetzstein, I, 87 (Catalogue Ahlwardt 5060), fol. 165a. The Berlin manuscript is presumed lost, but I do not think that when I copied this passage before World War II, I made a mistake and read “knowledge” when it should have been “learning” (at-ta\u0002allum). The edition of Ibn Bâjjah’s work on the soul by M. . \u0004. al-Ma\u0003\tûmî, 144 (Damascus 1379/1960), which is based upon the manu-script in the Bodleian Library, has at-ta\u0002allum in this connection. However, in spite of some similarity, the published text is entirely different from the one in the Berlin manu-script. The determination of learning (ta\u0002allum = mathêsis) as remembrance (tadhakkur = anamnêsis) was, of course, widely known through the Analytica Priora 67a21 (Ar.

Knowledge is a motion.1. “(Proclus, on the authority of Aristotle) called knowledge ‘motion’ (\u0003arakah).”116 However, in the Sirr al-khalîqah of Balînûs,117 it is said that “knowledge does not come about through a motion that is given a mate-rial form” (bi-\u0003arakah mujassadah, or read, mutajassidah “that takes place in a body, in a corporeal form”?). The view that motion is not involved corresponds, it seems, more closely to the Aristotelian conception, cf. Aristotle, Physics 247b.1182. “Knowledge is a motion of the heart.”119I. Knowledge is a relative term. This Aristotelian idea (cf. Categories 6b35, Arabic trans., ed. \u0003Abd-ar-Ra\bmân Badawî, Man\u000fiq Aris\u000fû, I, 23 [Cairo 1948–52]) underlies many of the de\u0002nitions quoted previously in which knowledge is brought into relation with the object known and the knower, cf., in particular, A-14.1. “Knowledge belongs to the category of relation (mu\u000eâf ), because it is used in comparison (bi-l-qiyâs) with the object known.” Also, “knowl-edge, which is the genus of the object known,120 is said to belong to the category of relation, because it is a knowledge of the object known.”1212. “Knowledge is the interdependence itself (nafs at-ta\u0002alluq).”1223. “Knowledge is a truth-related (\u0003aqîqîyah) attribute that is character-ized by interdependence (dhât ta\u0002alluq).”123J.

The fact that Ibn Sab\u0003în lists evident knowl-edge next to acquired knowledge in this fashion would seem to indicate that for him, the philosophical-theological assumption of the existence of such knowledge corresponded with the mystic’s desire for divinely inspired knowledge.130 Cf. al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî, Mas\balah fî l-farq bayn al-\u0002ilm wa-l-\u0002qh, as quoted by \u0003U.

Books and Chapters “On Knowledge”The root \u0002-l-m occurs frequently in the literature concerned with the traditions of the Prophet. This fact is not surprising. It is con\u0002rmed by the many pages of references listed in Concordance, IV, 313a25–339b39. It is, perhaps, not surprising either, but not quite as expected, that some monographs on traditions on knowledge were soon written and that the collections of \u0003adîth, which laid the foundations for the religio-legal complex of later Islam, came to include special chapters, or “books,” devoted to the topic of “knowledge.”The great legal compilation of the Imam Mâlik (b. ca. 91/710, d. 179/795) takes us back into the eighth century. The Muwa\u000f\u000fa\b contains a chapter on “the search after knowledge,” which occurs within the context of other moral prescriptions. It consists of only one tradition, or rather, wisdom saying, going back to Mâlik himself, which quotes the pre-Islamic sage from the Qur\u0002ân, Luqmân, as exhorting his son in these words: “Son, sit at the feet of the scholars and close to them, for God gives life to the hearts through the light of wisdom, like as He gives life to the dead soil through rain from heaven.”1 This saying is quoted by later authors in a number of slightly different recensions.2 Unfortunately, 1 Cf. Mâlik. Muwa\u000f\u000fa\b, 1002 (Cairo 1370/1951): IV, 429 f.

It might very well have been derived from an old collection of wisdom sayings of non-Arab or Arab origin. It might even have been invented by Mâlik himself, although this would seem to be very unlikely. The absence from the Muwa\u000f\u000fa\b of other and, from the Islamic point of view, more authoritative quotations is signi\u0002cant. It indicates that Mâlik was not aware of other relevant material that he might have considered worthy of inclusion in his work in this particular connection. There is no reason in the world why he should not have included it, had he known about it and thought it genuine and important. There was every reason to mention it. None of the material included in the chapters on \u0002ilm in later \u0003adîth collections is referred to in Mâlik’s chapter on \u0002ilm, a clear indication that the situation which led to the inclusion of that material had not yet reached the stage which suggested, if it did not demand, its inclusion. In Mâlik’s generation, \u0002ilm apparently had not yet achieved the stage of a problem in traditionist religious thought and scholarly methodology.Of the large \u0003adîth collections only those which arrange their mate-rial topically, as against works arranged according to transmitters, are of interest to us here. The largest part of the earlier literature of this type preceding the six so-called “canonical” collections, has not yet been recovered or is known so far only in fragmentary fashion. The Jâmi\u0002 of the Egyptian jurist, \u0003Abdallâh b. Wahb (b. 125/742–43, d. Sha\u0003bân 25, 197/May 1, 813), whose principal teacher had been the Imam Mâlik and who was supposedly nicknamed “Dîwân al-\u0003ilm” because of his vast knowledge,3 included a “Book on Knowledge.” This we learn from quotations in Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr’s Jâmi\u0002. Ibn Wahb’s Kitâb id-\u0002Ilm cited statements by Mâlik to the effect that “know-ledge does not rest in the large amount of transmitted material, but it is a light that God has placed in the hearts of men,” and that “knowledge and wisdom are a light by which God guides whomever He wishes; abrâr, Istanbul Ms. Fatih 3894 (written in 857/1453), fol. 25b; Ibn \u0003Arabî, Futû\u0003ât, IV, 513; al-Ibshîhî. Musta\u000fraf, I, 25. Al-Ba\u0006alyawsî, al-In\u0015âf fî i-tanbîh \u0002alâ l-asbâb, 78 (Cairo 1319), cites Luqmân’s remark as an example for the metaphoric use of life and death for knowledge and ignorance (which, according to al-Ba\u0006alyawsî, is one of thirteen such metaphoric uses of life and death).3 Cf. Ibn \u0004ajar, Tahdhîb, VI, 73 (Hyderabad 1325–27).rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 7110/17/2006 5:48:04 PM"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"72 knowledge is islamthey are not the large number of problems.” Ibn Wahb also stated on Mâlik’s authority that “it is part of a man’s happiness to be blessed with being right and good, as it is part of his unhappiness not to cease making mistakes.” His Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm also featured the tradition warning against supposititious traditions: “He who ascribes to me something I did not say, let him take his deserved place in the Fire; he who gives misleading advice to his friend who asks him for advice cheats him; and the fault for (mistakes resulting from) a fatwâ given to someone without suf\u0002cient grounding in the subject rests with the one who gives it to him.”4 The few complete books of Ibn Wahb’s Jâmi\u0002 that have been preserved and published5 do not comprise the Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm. Thus, nothing de\u0002nite can be said about the position it occupied within the work or about its contents.Almost two generations after Mâlik, the great Shâ\u0002\u0003î (150–204/767–820) wrote a special treatise on “The Sum Total of Know-ledge” ( Jimâ\u0002 al-\u0002ilm).6 To ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î, “knowledge” meant the establish-4 Cf. Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Jâmi\u0002, II, 25, 72, 115 f., and, without express reference to Ibn Wahb’s Jâmi\u0002, I, 17 f. The \u0002rst of the statements quoted above is quoted in Abû Nu\u0003aym, \tilyah, VI, 319, with other relevant statements. It is credited to \u0003Abdallâh b. Mas\u0003ûd in al-Ghazzâli, I\u0003yâ\b, I, 44, trans. N.A. Faris, 128, cf. also below, pp. 161 and 165; al-\u0003Almawî, Mu\u0002îd, 30. The statement of Ibn Wahb on the authority of Mâlik: “Wisdom, I think, is insight ( \u0002qh) into the religion of God.” is presumably derived from his Jâmi\u0002. Many other quotations from Ibn Wahb in Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr ( Jâmi\u0002, I, 135, 162, 190, II, 7, 11, 25, 32, 45, 52, 54, 58, 60, 80, 98, 123, 133–138, 141, 143, 140, 159, 165 f., 173 f.) may possibly go back to the Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm of Ibn Wahb’s Jâmi\u0002. However, this remains uncertain. In one instance (Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Jâmi\u0002. II, 53 f.), the source is indicated to be Ibn Wahb’s Kitâb al-Majâlis (see below, p. 310, n. 5).Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, Qût, 1, 200, 11. 5 ff., quotes Ibn Wahb as follows: “The search for knowledge (\u000falab al-\u0002ilm) was mentioned in Mâlik’s presence, and he said, ‘Searching for knowledge is good, and spreading knowledge is good, if it is done with the right intention, but look and \u0002nd out what behooves you, from morn to night, and from night to morn, and do not give preference over that to anything.’ ”For knowledge conceived as light, cf. below, ch. VI. Mâlik also speaks about “the light of knowledge” in a statement attributed to him to the effect that quarrelsomeness and disputation cause the light of knowledge to disappear, cf. Ibn Rajab.

It is embodied in the four fundamental sources of law upon which the legal system of Muslim jurists came to be based and which ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î discusses here. The highly sophisticated charac-ter of the brief treatise leaves little doubt that the more elementary occupation of \u0003adîth scholars with “knowledge” as they understood it preceded that of ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î (and his predecessors in this respect in the legal \u0002eld if there, were any), but the Jimâ\u0002 al-\u0002ilm is the earliest genuine example so far known of a methodological discussion of “knowledge” in monograph form.7The slightly younger Abû Khaythamah (b. 160/776–77. d. 234/849) wrote a Musnad, which is not preserved,8 but he also wrote a monograph entitled Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm which is preserved and is of great importance; for the history of the treatment of knowledge by \u0003adîth scholars.9 Abû Khaythamah’s Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm contains 163 traditions, a few of which are duplicates. One tradition is ascribed to Moses and was apparently included because the three questions Moses addresses to God include one about the best judge (a\u0003kam) among men. Another tradition is ascribed to Jesus and is an almost literal quotation of the second half of Matthew 5:19. Quite a few of the traditions concern conditions or persons after the time of the Prophet. Most of them are ascribed to the \u0002rst generation of Muslims. Less than a dozen go back to the Prophet himself. One of these is ascribed in one place to the Prophet, and in another to Ibn \u0003Abbâs (nos. 25 and 17). While it is impossible to ascertain whether or not the material attributed to the Prophet goes in fact back to him, it is clear that the Prophetic author-ship assumed for a large number of traditions dealing with “knowl-edge” in later times is the result of the process, worked out by J. Schacht for jurisprudence, of the attribution of traditions slowly working its way back in time.There is no discernible order in Abû Khaythamah’s arrangement 7 The legal principles of the \u0004anbalite school were treated in a Book on Knowledge by al-Khallâl (d. 311/923, cf. GAL, Suppl., I, 311), according to Ibn Taymîyah, al-Îmân, 333 (Damascus 1381/1961), a passage quoted in Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd ed., I, 274b. However, there seems to be some uncertainty as to the exact title of al-Khallâl’s work.8 Cf. Ibn an-Nadim, Fihrist, ed. G. Flügel, 230, 1, 9 (Leipzig 1871–72) = 321, 1, 12 (Cairo 1348).

Occasionally, traditions going back to the same author-ity are grouped together, as in the case of Mak\bûl (nos. 41–44) or Masrûq (nos. 46–50). The purpose, however, of all the material brought together by Abû Khaythamah is evident. It is meant to show the superi-ority of “knowledge”, that is, of traditional information, over indepen-dent judgment (ra\by, ijtihâd, kalâm, qiyâs) and to set forth the educational and methodological problems involved in the transmission of “knowl-edge.” The religious merit of knowledge and study is exalted. Scholars are praised highly. The real religious meaning of “knowledge” is indi-cated. The necessity of instruction, the process of instruction, the role of memorization versus written transmission, the reluctance required in expressing legal opinions the relationship of knowledge and action—all these matters, and many others, are dealt with in one or more tradi-tions. It is clear at this point that the discussion of “knowledge” in tradi-tionist thought served primarily educational ends. In fact, while at \u0002rst slanted toward the needs of traditionist and legal education, the same principles were transferred later to Muslim education in general and are re\u0003ected in Muslim educational literature.10 It also seems a likely assumption that the accumulation of material for the traditionist and legal discussion of “knowledge” in the educational and methodological sense had reached the stage where it warranted coherent presentation during the \u0002rst half of the eighth century.The same situation is, in a somewhat different way, also indicated in the important Mu\u0015annaf of the Kûfan transmitter, Abû Bakr Ibn Abî Shaybah (b. 159/775–76, d. 235/849). Like Abû Khaythamah’s small monograph, the many volumes of the Mu\u0015annaf do not deal exclusively with Prophetic traditions. The work includes throughout statements and opinions of early Muslims on a great variety of topics, and it pays considerable attention to such subjects as historical data, something we do not \u0002nd in later \u0003adîth collections. Ibn Abî Shaybah’s Mu\u0015annaf may, in fact, be viewed as a literary form all its own which was discontinued when, on the one hand, \u0003adîth works concentrated on the Prophet and religiously relevant information and, on the other, a vast accumulation of secular entertaining, morally edifying, and educational material made the composition of separate, quasi-secular adab works 10 Cf. below, pp. 280 ff.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 7410/17/2006 5:48:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":" books and chapter “on knowledge” 75possible and desirable. Or, the Mu\u0015annaf might have constituted an attempt to draw the ancient tradition of adab writing into the realm of religious scholarship. Characteristically, Ibn Abî Shaybah’s concern with “knowledge” expresses itself within the framework of a “Book on Adab.”11 Well tucked away somewhere in the middle of the voluminous compilation, the chapter on adab is preceded by sections on medicine and dress. Ibn Abî Shaybah’s treatment of “knowledge” re\u0003ects the greatly varied interests of adab authors and shows scant af\u0002nity to the approach of the collectors of \u0003adîth. The “Book on Adab” begins with remarks on kindness and gentleness (mâ dhukira fî r-rifq wa-t-tû\badah) and continues with traditions concerning a great many other good or bad qualities of character and modes of behavior, such as the proper forms of greeting and so on. Considerable space is devoted to the attitude of the Prophet and the, early Muslims toward piety as an important component of adab. The part of the chap-ter dealing with \u0002ilm occupies only about, one-\u0002fth of it and is, moreover, interspersed with paragraphs on such subjects as backgammon, chess, the game of “fourteen” (arba\u0002ata \u0002ashara or, with its Persian name in an Arabicized form, shahârdah), and children’s games. Among the subjects discussed we \u0002nd studying (\u000falab al-\u0002ilm) and teaching, studying for the sake of gaining worldly esteem, and traveling in quest of knowledge. The “Book on Adab” is immediately followed by a brief “book” on tra-ditional information set down in writing (al-\u0003adîth fî l-karâris).12 It deals with opinions about the permissibility of or the dislike for the written \u0002xation of “knowledge,” but it also has a section on what a man must learn himself or teach his children.

No order is readily discernible in Ibn Abî Shaybah’s arrangement of topics concern-ing knowledge, most certainly because there was none. The view that a coherent discussion of “knowledge” could serve as a suit-able and, indeed, necessary foundation and introduction for a work on religious traditions was apparently still too new, and the adab out-look of the Mu\u0015annaf militated against imitating the \u0003adîth scholars’ preoccupation with methods for the defense and preservation of their “knowledge.”The situation is already different in the \u0003adîth work of ad-Dârimî (181–235/797–865) who represents the next generation. Ad-Dârimî’s compilation does not contain what could be called a special “book” on \u0002ilm. However, a large, part of its introduction s given over to indi-vidual chapters (bâb) that discuss various aspects of \u0002ilm as illustrated by statements of the Prophet and, mostly, other early Muslim authorities.14 Beginning with a discussion of the excellence of the Prophet, ad-Dârimî soon leads over to his proper subject, the Prophetical traditions and their transmission. It is in this connection that he speaks, among other matters, about such subjects as the recommendable imitation of schol-ars, the threatening danger of a disappearance of “knowledge,” or the need of acting in accordance with one’s knowledge and its approved use. He speaks of the tradition that “knowledge is fear and piety,” of the importance of the right intent and the blame-worthiness of seek-ing knowledge not for the sake of God, of the equal treatment due to all students of traditional knowledge, and of the honor that belongs to scholars. Then, he goes into the problems of the trans-mis-sion of traditional knowledge and whether or not its \u0002xation in writing is permissible. He includes a chapter on traveling in quest of knowledge and on the appropriate behavior that preserves the dignity of knowledge, on the interpretation and the discussion and study of traditions and their use for rendering legal decisions, and the like. He concludes his discussion of \u0002ilm with a chapter illustrating the reverence due to knowledge. More in the adab tradition than in that of austere \u0003adîth scholarship, this chapter consists of three rather lengthy sermons expounding the wisdom of true religious scholars who teach the right ethical approach toward life, including an epistle by the eighth-century 14 I used the Istanbul Ms. Reiselküttap 257, fols. 18b–43a.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 7610/17/2006 5:48:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" books and chapter “on knowledge” 77Abû \u0003Utbah \u0003Abbâd b. \u0003Abbâd al-Khawwâ\t15 that begins with a praise of intelligence (\u0002aql ). This constitutes the end of ad-Dârimî’s general introduction. Ad-Dârimî clearly anticipates the development that led to the introductory “book on knowledge.” While he still appears to be undecided as to the overall and systematic importance of the concept, he is, to our knowledge, the \u0002rst author of one of the large \u0003adîth collec-tions to use the discussion of “knowledge” as a general introduction.A quotation from a Kitâb al-Ma\u0002rifah by al-\u0004asan b. \u0003Alî al-\u0004alwânî (d. 242/857) suggests that, in spite of the use of the word ma\u0002rifah,16 al-\u0004alwânî’s treatise was in fact also a traditionist study of knowledge, but another quotation seems to indicate a wider range of topics.17 A Kitâb Jâmi\u0002 al-\u0002ilm by an early Shî\u0003ah author, al-\u0004u\tayn b. Mukhâriq as-Salûlî, who lived in the ninth century, may also have dealt with knowledge after the manner and in the spirit of \u0003adîth scholars.18 A title credited to the founder of the \u0011âhirî school, Dâwûd b. \u0003Alî (b. ca. 815, d. 270/884): “Traditions that make knowledge necessary” (Kitâb al-Khabar al-mûjib li-l-\u0002ilm), should presumably be corrected to . . . li-l-\u0002amal and translated “. . . that require acting (in accordance with them).”19 It is also by no means certain that \u0002ilm in the title of a work by Ibn Abî Sar\b, who wrote in 274/887: “Book on Knowledge and what has been mentioned about it,” is the correct reading. If it is, the work may have dealt with the merits of knowledge in a secular sense and thus have stood close to the beginnings of a long chain of literary effusions in praise of knowledge.2015 Cf. Sezgin, I, 519, where, however. \u0003Abhâd b. \u0003Abbâd is wrongly identi\u0002ed with the person mentioned by Ibn \u0004ajar, Tahdhîb, V. 95. Like ad-Dârimî’s \u0003Abbâd b. \u0003Abbâd, the one mentioned by Sezgin is listed by Ibn \u0004ajar, Tahdhîb, V, 97.16 For the frequent occurrence of ma\u0002rifah in the titles of early Shi\u0003ah and Mu\u0003tazilah works, cf. below, pp. 146 ff.17 Cf.

The Kilâb al-Ma\u0002rifah wa-l-yaqîn by the famous Mâlikite Ibn Abi Zayd, which is listed in Ibn Far\bûn, Dîbâj. 137 (Cairo 1351), would seem to have been a work on theology, dealing with the acquisition of certainty in the knowledge about God.18 Cf. Fihrist, 192, 1, 21 = 272, 1, 21; a\u0006-\u0005ûsî, Fihrist. 82 f. (Najaf 1380/1961). Ibn Mukhâriq’s lifetime is approximately \u0002xed by the isnâd mentioned in a\u0006-\u0005ûsî.19 Cf.

The other four do have “books” on knowledge of some length. They show some variety not so much in their contents as in the emphasis they place on the material they report. The oldest of the six, and the most in\u0003uential, al-Bukhârî (194–256/810–870), made another change which proved to be very effective. He transposed the ‘book on knowledge” from its relatively obscure position in the middle of the work to near the beginning. Al-Bukhârî starts out by dealing with a historical subject that can claim pride of place both as to time and as to importance, that is, the begin-nings of the Prophet’s divine mission. As al-Bukhârî’s commentators were quick to point out, this serves as a sort of perfunctory introduc-tion and cannot be considered a regular “book” of the work. Next, al-Bukhârî devotes a “book” to the subject of “faith” (îmân). It is true faith which justi\u0002es and, indeed, demands the composition of works on the traditions of the Prophet with all that goes with them. After the discussion of faith, and before he goes into the detailed exposition of all Muslim religious duties, al-Bukhârî presents his Kitâb al-\u0002ilm. Its position indicates that in the author’s view, the subject of “knowledge” is as basic as, or more so than, the beginnings of Muhammad’s mission and true faith. A look at the contents of his “book on knowledge” clearly shows why he considered this to be so. On the surface, the material of the “book” seems to be chosen rather arbitrarily, and its arrangement to be quite unsystematic. However, this is in a way deceptive, as the following analysis of the contents shows:211. A chapter heading only, referring to Qur\u0002ân 58:11/12 (cf. 2: 234/234, etc.) as well as 20:114/113, in praise of knowledge and its importance.2. The method to be followed in communicating religious information: A story of the Prophet to the effect that he did not interrupt the discussion he was engaged in when he was asked some other question.—A story about speaking loudly while exhort-ing people to ful\u0002ll their religious duties or risk damnation.—21 I used the text of al-Bukhâri’s \u001ba\u0003î\u0003 with the commentaries of Ibn \u0004ajar, Fat\u0003 al-bârî, I, 149–241; al-\u0003Aynî, \u0002Umdat al-qârî, I, 379–641; and al-Qas\u0006allânî, Irshâd as-sârî, I, 178–261. The numbering of topics in al-Bukhârî and the other \u0003adîth collections, as it appears here, has been supplied by me.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 7810/17/2006 5:48:06 PM"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":" books and chapter “on knowledge” 79On the choice of the most appropriate expressions (such as “he told us,” etc.) to introduce a tradition.—A parable comparing Muslims to a tree that does not shed its leaves; the same parable is used to make the point that it is good pedagogical practice not to explain the solution of a problem right away but to ask the listeners \u0002rst whether they are able to \u0002nd the solution by themselves, in order to test their knowledge.3. A chapter heading only, referring again to Qur\u0002ân 20:114/113.4. On the various possible methods of studying: Reading to a teacher; listening to him (this includes the famous story of people listening while a Bedouin questions the Prophet about the essentials of Islam); and, on the basis of \u0003Uthmân’s sending out of written copies of the Qur\u0002ân and of the Prophet’s writing of letters on various occasions, writing down traditions and transmitting them when knowledge of them was acquired through written material (the chapter heading uses the techni-cal term munâwalah used for this procedure in the science of \u0003adîth).—A story illustrating the proper selection of his seat by a student who comes to class when it is already in session.—Those attending a session are required to inform those who did not about what went on in class, even if the latter know the material better in the \u0002rst place.5. A chapter heading only, referring to Qur\u0002ân 47:19/21 (the shahâdah) and 35:28/25 (the scholars’ particular reverence for God), etc.—Traditions indicating the precedence of knowing over speaking; scholars being the heirs of the prophets; the search for knowledge opening up the road to Paradise; God giving insight ( faqqaha) into religious matters to those whom He likes; knowledge being attained only through study; Ibn \u0003Abbâs interpreting the word rabbâniyûn as those who educate ( yurabbî ) people \u0002rst in less import-ant matters, and then in the more important ones. The last state-ment is expanded by references to the need for a skilful spacing of exhortations; they should not be given too frequently, nor should they be too frightening. Similarly, the tradition that God gives insight into religious matters to those whom He likes is to be understood in the sense that individuals are given such insight in different degrees, for the spiritual well-being of the community. Some individuals are quicker than others in understanding. This is illustrated again by the parable referred to under 2.6. Statements in praise of knowledge by the caliph \u0003Umar, recommending that a person gain knowledge ( f-q-h) before he is rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 7910/17/2006 5:48:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"80 knowledge is islamto assume leadership, and by Mu\bammad to the effect that two per-sons are to be envied, the person who is given property by God and is enabled to spend it wisely, and the person who is given wisdom by God and renders judgment by it ( yaq\u000ei bihâ)22 and teaches it to others.7. Statements on the necessity of studying are found in Qur\u0002ân 18:66/65 with the story of Mûsâ and al-Khi\rr, which also illustrates the need for traveling long distances in quest of knowledge, and in the tradi-tion: “God, teach him the Book,” which proves the necessity of teaching the Qur\u0002ân. It is necessary to start out studying at a very young age. The Prophet does not mind when \u0003Abdallâh b. al-\u0003Abbâs joins the prayer at an age just approaching puberty. The Prophet spits a little water upon a \u0002ve-year old.—The need for knowing and teaching is illustrated by the Prophet’s comparison of the right guidance and knowledge given him by God for his Prophetic mission with plentiful rain falling upon good soil and creating fertility, and falling upon depressed ground and being of no use.8. One of the signs of the Hour is the disappearance of knowledge.9. The Prophet dreams of drinking milk (laban) and passing the vessel from which he is drinking on to \u0003Umar. This refers to knowledge and its transmission.10. Instances of situations in which religious information can be communicated, and of the ways and means of communicating religious information: Stories illustrating the necessity of commu-nicating religious knowledge and of traveling in order to obtain it; the possibility of sharing information with a fellow-student; the need for the teacher to exercise restraint when he gets angry under ques-tioning; and the recommendable procedure of frequent repetition in teaching. The Prophet repeated every salâm or remark (cf. above, under 2) three times.11. The permissibility of giving instruction to women: The Prophet speaks of the three kinds of persons who can expect to receive a twofold reward. Among them is the person who gives a good education to his maidservant, then manumits and marries her.—The Prophet himself exhorted women.12. Muslims ought to prove themselves eager to study traditions. 22 This is the translation suggested by the commentators, but since al-Bukhârî makes little of the relevance of \u0003adîth to jurisprudence in this chapter, he may have conceived here of the phrase in a more general way. rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 8010/17/2006 5:48:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":" books and chapter “on knowledge” 81This is illustrated by the Prophet’s praise for Abû Hurayrah’s eagerness in inquiring about the person most deserving of the Prophet’s interces-sion on the Day of Resurrection.13. Knowledge will not be taken away from mankind, but scholars will disappear. When no scholar remains, stupid men will be put in command. They will go astray themselves as well as lead others astray.14. The need for regular and constant instruction: The Prophet set aside one particular day for the exhortation of women.— \u0003Â\u0002ishah’s example shows that it is necessary to consult an authority repeatedly about a matter, until one understands it fully.—The students who were in attendance must inform those who were not (cf. above, under 4).15. Famous statements warning against the falsi\u0002cation of traditions: “Do not ascribe falsehoods to me,” and “He who ascribes falsehoods to me intentionally, let him take his deserved place in the Fire.” There are several, slightly different recensions.16. Stories that have nothing to do with \u0002ilm, except that they men-tion the writing down of religious information and thus have relevance to the process of instruction.17. It is recommendable to study even at unusual hours: The Prophet woke up in the night and had his household awakened in order to exhort them.—The Prophet prayed and exhorted people after nightfall.18. The great number of existing traditions calls for good memories. Abû Hurayrah was cured of forgetfulness by the Prophet personally, so that he was able thereafter to boast of his tremendous knowledge of traditions.19. The required behavior of teachers and students in class: The Prophet gives orders that people be kept quiet and be forced to listen.—Nobody should claim that he knows best. This ought to be left to God, as illustrated again by the story of Mûsâ and al-Khi\rr. —The Prophet was addressed by a man who was standing while he himself was sitting, and had to look up to the questioner. —Religious information may be imparted even while throwing pebbles at Minâ.—Even obnoxious questioners may be tolerated, as illustrated in the questioning of the Prophet by the Jews and his forbearance (Qur\u0002ân 17:85/87).20. Not all religious information is to be communicated to everybody, because it may be misunderstood and cause harm. rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 8110/17/2006 5:48:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"82 knowledge is islamThe Prophet entrusted some of his secret ideas to \u0003Â\u0002ishah.

His purpose was to prevent people from relying upon it and using it as a pretext for omitting to do good deeds.21. Bashfulness (\u0003ayâ\b\u0005) belongs to knowledge. Mujâhid, however, said that neither a bashful nor a haughty person was able to acquire knowl-edge. On the other hand, \u0003Â\u0002ishah stated that their natural bashfulness did not prevent women from getting insight (tafaqqaha) into religious matters (cf. above, under 5). Again, the parable of the tree (cf. above, under 2) is quoted to show that it was young Ibn al-\u0003Abbâs’ bashfulness that prevented him from coming out with the right answer on a certain occasion.—If a man is bashful, as was ‘Ali with regard to a sexual prob-lem he had, someone else may be asked to go and elicit the information required.22. Religious information, such as the question as to where to put on the i\u0003râm upon approaching the holy territory, may be inquired about in a mosque.23. In reply to a question as to how the mu\u0003rim must dress, the Prophet went at length into what he must not wear, etc. This proves the teacher’s freedom to handle problems put to him as he sees \u0002t.A rather clear picture emerges from the preceding analysis of the con-tents of al-Bukhârî’s chapter on knowledge. It could hardly be expected that the arrangement adopted by the author would be a strictly sys-tematic one. However, one easily notices the de\u0002nite purpose behind the choice and arrangement of the material which gives the chapter a considerable degree of unity. Al-Bukhârî discusses the procedures to be followed by the teacher of “knowledge,” that is, traditional religious information, and those to be followed by the student. At the end of the entire “book,” he refers gain to the behavior of both teacher and stu-dent during instruction, to the quality of bashfulness in students, and to the liberty of teachers to teach whatever they consider necessary and appropriate in a given situation. In between, the author, interspersing rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 8210/17/2006 5:48:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":" books and chapter “on knowledge” 83his discussion with the customary praise of knowledge, dwells on the need for knowledge and instruction. He stresses the urgency of that need by citing the Prophet to the effect that the disappearance of knowledge and of scholars will herald the end of the world, and by referring to the existence of that need even under the most unusual circumstances, even for women, even at odd hours. A correlate of the urgent need for knowledge and the instruction in it is the necessity to avoid wrong teachings and the instruction in matters for which the stu-dent may be unprepared. Al-Bukhârî is concerned with justifying his meticulous and detailed approach to the study of \u0003adîth. An exposi-tion of scholarly methodology seemed to him the proper way of doing it. His “Book on Knowledge” comes after the discussion of the theo-logical problem of “faith,” but it was not meant to deal with “knowl-edge” in any theological sense. As a matter of fact, the term \u0002ilm occurs rather infrequently in the text itself of the traditions reported. It occurs frequently elsewhere in the chapter and, in particular, in the chapter headings, which are very helpful in explaining why a particular story or tradition has been mentioned in the context. Without them, we would often be at a loss as to the relevance of the material cited to the subject of “knowledge.” A late commentator on al-Bûkhârî’s work, al-\u0003Aynî, states correctly that “the Book on Knowledge deals with the explana-tion of what is connected with knowledge, and not with the explanation of the essence of knowledge, because the study of the essences and real meanings (\u0003aqâ\biq) of things forms no part of the work.”23 It is under-stood throughout that “knowledge” is exclusively religious knowledge. More particularly, it is the discipline to which the work is devoted, that is, the scholarly investigation of Prophetic traditions. The philosophical or theological concern with the meaning of knowledge does not enter al-Bukhârî’s “Book on Knowledge.” It is, as we have seen, an exposition of the most suitable method of higher education.Turning now to Abû Dâwûd (202–275/817–889)—it is dif\u0002cult and, perhaps, not very important to decide upon the exact chro-nological sequence, but Abû Dâwûd may have been slightly older than the following Muslim although he survived him by more than a decade—, we encounter a considerable difference in emphasis. 23 Al-\u0003Aynî, \u0002Umdat al-qârî, I, 379. Cf. also Ibn \u0004ajar, Fat\u0003 al-bârî, I, 149, who includes a reference to Abû Bakr Ibn al-\u0003Arabî and his general attitude toward \u0002ilm as cited above, pp. 50 f.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 8310/17/2006 5:48:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"84 knowledge is islamAbû Dâwûd’s “Book on Knowledge” still occupies an inconspicuous position within the body of the work. The subject of “knowledge” is thus characterized as just one of the various procedures requiring guidance from precedents set by the Prophet. However, it follows directly upon the book dealing with the judiciary, which is the most important part of the Islamic religious structure. Abû Dâwûd’s “Book on Knowledge” can be brie\u0003y analyzed as follows:241. Statements in praise of knowledge: The search for knowledge opens up a road to Paradise; scholars are more excellent than pious worshipers to the same degree in which the full moon is more excellent than all the other stars; scholars are the heirs of the prophets, leaving behind them not money but knowledge, etc.2. Information given by non-Muslims is to be accepted but without comment as to its truth or falseness.3. The written \u0002xation of religious information: The Prophet per-mitted his speech during the last pilgrimage to be written down, and he also said. “Write it down, for truly, only what is true comes forth from my mouth.” But he is also said to have forbidden expressly that any such information be set down in writing.4. Against falsifying traditions: “He who ascribes falsehoods to me intentionally, let him take his deserved place in the Fire.”—The use of “opinion” (that is, the use of other than traditional information) with regard to the Qur\u0002ân is always a mistake.5. The necessity, method, and extent of instruction: The Prophet repeated each of his statements three times, thereby indicating the need for repetition as an educational device. He did so slowly and deliberately, without any undue haste.—No tricky questions are allowed,25 and it would be wrong to put someone in a position where religious knowledge is required and to ask him questions, if it is known that he does not possess the necessary knowledge to answer them. On the other hand, the knowledge one possesses must be passed on (“He who is asked about a religious problem [\u0002ilm] and conceals the answer will be bridled with a bridle of \u0002re on the Day of Resurrection”). The transmission of religious knowledge is a necessary and continuous process to be undertaken even by those 24 The editions of the Sunan, III, 234–41, also III, 432–41 (Cairo 1369/1950), and the commentary by al-Kha\u0006\u0006âbî, Ma\u0002âlim as-sunnah, IV, 182–88 (Cairo 1352/1934), have been consulted.25 Cf. below, p. 255.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 8410/17/2006 5:48:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":" books and chapter “on knowledge” 85who are no religious scholars in their own right and who may happen to transmit their information to men who are actually better informed than they themselves. “That one man obtains right guidance through you, is better for you than red camels.”—The transmission of religious information on the authority of Israelites is not objectionable. In fact, the Prophet did this on one occasion throughout the night.6. The study of religious information for any kind of worldly advance-ment is detrimental to the student. He who does so, “will not be able to smell the perfume of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection.”—Only a man in a position of command, or someone ordered to do so, or a con-ceited individual26 would undertake to be a qâ\u0015\u0015 to speak about religious matters in public. However, the Prophet himself once joined a group of ragged strangers and listened together with them to a Qur\u0002ân reader. Although he was the recipient of the divine revelation, he liked to have someone else read the Qur\u0002ân to him.As in al-Bukhârî, we \u0002nd here the same preoccupation with the ways and means of the transmission of traditions. The presentation, how-ever, is much less systematic. There are fewer details, and much greater value is attached to the idea of religious merit. In a way, \u0002ilm is the sci-ence of traditions for Abû Dâwûd, too, as is to be expected. Yet, Abû Dâwûd did not feel compelled to consider the methodological aspects of the acquisition and transmission of knowledge for their own sake. He seems to be much more concerned with the moral values to be found in it.The situation is totally different in the \u001ba\u0003î\u0003 of Muslim (b. ca. 202/817 or 206/821, d. 261/875). A few Prophetic traditions considered as somehow belonging together have been labeled in the \u001ba\u0003î\u0003 as its “Book on Knowledge.” It is a brief chapter. It follows upon the discussion of a theological subject, the problem of predestination (qadar). However, Muslim does not view \u0002ilm as a theological term, nor does he deal with it as a peg on which to hang the methodology of scholarship. The infor-mation he gives shapes up as follows:271.

(All this clearly refers to the Qur\u0002ân as such and is not meant to apply to religious information in general).2. On the occupation with Prophetic traditions: The laws and cus-toms (sunan) of the forefathers must be followed inch by inch even to the extent of, say, following them into a lizard’s hole, were they to enter one, and even if those forefathers were Jews or Christians or what not. The Prophet said that quibblers would come to a bad end. He repeated the words three times. (The “quibblers” here are not to be identi\u0002ed with those students who put tricky to their teachers, as mentioned by Abû Dâwûd. Further more, Muslim did not have in mind the necessity of repetition in the teaching process when he let the Prophet condemn the “quibblers” three times. The threefold repetition is mentioned here merely for emphasis.)3. Various recensions of the traditions that the disappearance of knowledge is one of the signs of the approach of the Hour; that knowl-edge will be taken away when the Time draws near; and that it is not knowledge as such that will be taken away, but the scholars will disap-pear and be replaced by stupid men.4. The establishment of good precedents, as, for instance, with regard to generosity in giving charity to the poor, or the promotion of ways of right guidance assure a divine reward for the originator of such precedents, when the good precedent he established is followed by others. Divine punishment, conversely, will hit the originators of bad precedents.It is clear that in his chapter on knowledge, Muslim did not intend to do more than stress the role of “knowledge” in the proper interpreta-tion of the Qur\u0002ân and in the proper evaluation of the high esteem to be accorded to the sunnah of the Prophet. Knowledge is also praised perfunctorily as a religious term. In view of the fact that Muslim wrote at a time when a discussion of the methodology of “knowledge” was recognized as an intrinsic part of the science of \u0003adîth, it is astonishing that so very little was made by him of the subject.The approach of at-Tirmidhî (d. 279/892), again, is rather different. In the context of his “Book on Knowledge,” at-Tirmidhî rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 8610/17/2006 5:48:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":" books and chapter “on knowledge” 87understood “knowledge” as referring exclusively to the science of traditions. He discussed all the material that offered hints as to the methods to be followed in this discipline, but his main purpose was to underline and exalt its importance. The position of his chapter on knowledge within his work characterizes “knowledge” as but one of the many religious duties and functions, even though, as in al-Bukhârî, it is preceded by the chapter on faith. Since at-Tirmidhî placed “knowl-edge” next to “faith,” he considered probably both concepts as belong-ing somehow together and as rating about equally on his scale of religious values. However, the “faith” he was speaking about was not a theological problem of the \u0002rst rank. Rather, in his view, “faith” was to be considered a minor accessory to the performance of religious duties, and “knowledge,” consequently, was for him a similarly restricted sub-ject. At-Tirmidhî’s “Book on Knowledge” has grown to rather large proportions:281. “God gives insight into religious matters to those whom He likes.”2. On the search for knowledge: “It opens up a road to Paradise;” “The person in quest of knowledge is on the path of God until he returns;” “It is an expiation for past deeds.”3. On the necessity to pass on religious information to others: He who does not do so will be bridled with a bridle of \u0002re on the Day of Resurrection; visiting students should be received with kindness.4. The knowledge will not be taken away, but scholars will disappear and be replaced by stupid men. A continuation of the mere outward performance of religious duties, such as reciting the Qur\u0002ân, does not mean that knowledge may not be on its way toward disappearance. A \u0002rst sign of the disappearance of knowledge is the disappearance of humility.5. Those who seek knowledge for any kind of worldly advancement will go to Hell.6. A person must transmit to others religious information he has received, even if the person to whom he communicates it possesses greater knowledge than he does. The Prophet blessed someone who heard him make a statement, learned it by heart, and passed it on to others.28 Cf. at-Tirmidhî, \u001ba\u0003î\u0003, 435–42 (Delhi 1266), with the commentary by Ibn al-\u0003Arabî, \u0002Âri\u000eat al-a\u0003wadhî, X, 113–59.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 8710/17/2006 5:48:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"88 knowledge is islam7. “He who ascribes falsehoods to me intentionally, let him take his deserved place in the Fire,” with variations which make it plain that this tradition refers to lying transmitters of \u0003adîth.8. Disapproval was expressed of someone who refused to listen to traditions because he felt that the Qur\u0002ân contained all the necessary information.9. Writing down traditions: The Prophet refused permission to do so when he was asked for it, but someone who complained of being unable to remember all the traditions he had heard from the Prophet was told, “Use your right hand.” The Prophet also gave orders for (his speech in Mecca) to be written down. Abû Hurayrah admitted that \u0003Abdallâh b. \u0003Amr (b. al-Â\t)29 knew more traditions than he, because he wrote them down, whereas he did not do so.10. There is no harm in transmitting information on the authority of the Israelites. This is coupled with a repetition of the statement that those who ascribe falsehoods to the Prophet intentionally will take their deserved place in the Fire.11. Great value and religious merit are to be found in establishing good precedents in general, and in \u0002nding out about the sunnah of the Prophet in particular. Conversely, the establishment of bad precedents is blameworthy. “He who points to what is good is like the one who does good.” A number of stories illustrating this proposition. It is recom-mendable to hold on to the precedents (sunnah) set by the Prophet and by the \u0002rst four caliphs, as well as to avoid innovations. The Prophet warned against taking a critical attitude toward traditions: “Leave me as I left you. If I tell you a \u0003adîth, accept it on my authority. Those before you perished because of too much questioning and too much disagree-ment with their prophets.”12.

Whenever he \u0002nds it, he is fully entitled to keep it.”31Ibn Mâjah (209–273/824–887) does not have a “Book on Knowledge” expressly so designated in his Sunan.32 In its place, he has a rather lengthy introduction at the beginning of the work which is intended to bring out the importance of the sunnah of the Prophet as well as the importance of its transmission and its observation, in about the manner of at-Tirmidhi. Ibn Mâjah also discusses some of the men concerned with the transmission of traditions. Moreover, he includes chapters on predestination and faith. He adds traditions on the merit of studying and teaching the Qur\u0002ân and on traveling in quest of knowledge. Of the six “authoritative” collections, only Ibn Mâjah’s Sunan mentions the famous tradition that “seeking knowledge is a religious duty ( farî\u000eah) for every Muslim. He who puts knowledge before those unprepared for it is like one who puts a necklace of precious stones and pearls and gold on swine.”33 Ibn Mâjah concludes his remarks with a statement on the 30 This, again, is a quotation of Matthew 5:19, cf. Abû Khaythamah, above, p. 73, and below, p. 246.31 For a different version on “knowledge being the stray beast of the Muslim”. cf. also Abû Khaythamah, no. 157. Ibn al-\u0003Arabî’s commentary goes on here with remarks on the traditions about story-telling (qa\u0015a\u0015), found at the end of Abû Dâwûd (above, p. 85).32 Ed. M. Fu\u0002âd \u0003Abd-al-Bâqî, 3–98 (Cairo 1372/1052).33 By consulting the Concordance, it can be easily veri\u0002ed today that Ibn Mâjah is the only one of the six to quote this \u0003adîth with its scriptural overtones. In medieval times, this required a fatwâ, cf. Taqî-ad-dîn as-Subkî, Fatâwî, II, 545 (Cairo 1355–56). The \u0002rst part of the tradition is at times coupled with another tradition as famous as it is spuri-ous: “Seek knowledge, even if it be (as far away) as China.” Cf., for instance, Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, Qût, I, 191–94 (below, p. 182); al-Ghazzâlî, I\u0003yâ\b, I, 13 ff., trans.

Thus, like at-Tirmidhî, he sees “knowledge” as the epitome of the greatness and importance of the science of traditions. But on the other hand, he shares with al-Bukhârî the insight that “knowledge,” together with other important religious concepts, is to be treated as a propaedeutic subject and that the discussion of it must precede the detailed exposition of the religious injunctions of Islam.Although he is the most recent of the authors of the six collec-tions, an-Nasâ\u0002î (215–303/830–915) has no “book” or chapter on \u0002ilm in his Sunan, which is also called al-Mujtabâ and which, it seems, is an abridgement of his larger Sunan work, which appears not to be preserved.34 It should be noted, however, that al-\u0003Aynî, in his Commentary on al-Bukhârî’s \u001ba\u0003i\u0003, repeatedly quotes traditions from “an-Nasâ\u0002î fî l-\u0002ilm.”35 One of these traditions is also said by al-\u0003Aynî to occur at the same time in “an-Nasâ\u0002î fî \u000f-\u000fibb.” Only exceptionally can one of these traditions be traced to an-Nasâ\u0002î’s Sunan work in its available form.36 In general, the traditions cited do not occur in it at all.37 It is possible but not certain that they may have been derived from the original larger compilation. So far, however, the references from al-\u0003Aynî remain rather enigmatic.Still from the ninth century, we have information about a “Book on Knowledge” by Abû Bakr A\bmad b. \u0003Alî al-Marwazî, who died around the year 292/904–5.38 His work certainly belonged into the context of traditionist treatments of knowledge. The same applies to another Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm, cited as a work by Ibn Abî \u0003Â\tim. We are tempted to equate this author with the well-known \u0003adîth scholar, Abû Bakr A\bmad b. \u0003Amr b. Abî \u0003A\tim an-Nabîl. This may be the correct identi\u0002cation, although Abû Bakr b. Abî \u0003Âsim died in 287/900, and the direct authority of the author of the Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm in his chain of transmitters died as late as 301/34 Cf.

Little material is so far accessible, although there exists a large body of works of potential interest. No certain date can be assigned to its origin. Its ascription to the Imâms cannot be maintained, since this would mean that much of what is known elsewhere in Islam clearly as the result of later developments was anticipated by them. Moreover, the available manuscripts, unless they are forgeries, are as a rule too recent to give positive support to a very ancient origin of the works transmitted in them. It is less clear, however, when the oldest nucleus of this litera-ture \u0002rst found written expression and how far back individual writings have to be dated. A collection of \u0003adîths attributed to Ja\u0003far a\t-âdiq (d. 148/765) is entitled Mi\u0015bâ\u0003 ash-sharî\u0002ah wa-miftâ\u0003 al-\u0003aqîqah.41 The title already suggests a date far more recent than the ninth century, and the work’s haphazard use of mystical-ethical terminology would tend to bring it further down, at least beyond the time of the eleventh-century al-Qushayrî. The Mi\u0015bâ\u0003 has chapters on “knowledge” (\u0002ilm, ch. 62), “certain knowledge” ( yaqîn, ch. 88), “wisdom” (\u0003ikmah, ch. 99), and “ignorance” ( jahl, ch. 77). The chapters are spread over the whole, work seemingly without any clear motivation justifying their insertion in the particular places in which they are found. “Ja\u0003far” starts, of course, with the praise of knowledge as he does with the blame of ignorance whose progress is darkness42 and whose recession is light. 39 Cf. al-\u0003Aynî, \u0002Umdat al-qârî, I, 427, 463.

The theme of the necessity of acting with sincere devotion is then elaborated by means of statements castigating useless knowledge and stressing the fact that just a small amount of knowledge supports a large amount of life-long work. An inscription found and deciphered by Jesus and a revelation received by David likewise indicate the need for action. “Knowledge” is the only way leading to God. The true “knower” is identi\u0002ed by his prayers, his piety, and his actions, and not by his appearance, his pre-tensions, and his words. True knowledge has always been sought in the past by those possessing intelligence, devotion (nusk), modesty (bashful-ness, \u0003ayâ\b\u0005), and the fear of God (khashyah); today it is sought by men not possessing any of these qualities. Statements concerning the qualities required of teachers and students conclude “Ja\u0003far\u0002s” chapter on knowl-edge. Knowledge, for “Ja\u0003far,” is the result of introspection, a response within the individual to the divine. But it is also the result of a process of teaching and studying, and it must \u0002nd expression in relevant human activity. The whole would seem to be a mixture of moderate Shî\u0003ah views of revealed and inspired knowledge and the “orthodox” concern with the methodology of the transmission of traditions and their practi-cal legal signi\u0002cance.The traditionist discussion of knowledge can be said to serve basically two purposes. First and foremost, it is intended to clarify the proper method and educational procedure to be followed in the study of traditions. Secondarily, it wishes to stress the essential relationship of knowledge with the faith of the true religion, as it considers knowledge a fundamental part of it. For the \u0003adîth scholars, knowledge thus is the key to both the theory and the 43 Cf. above, p. 89, n. 4.44 Cf. below, p. 137.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 9210/17/2006 5:48:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" books and chapter “on knowledge” 93practice of Islam. The second purpose is in line with the role assigned to knowledge already in the Qur\u0002ân. The attempt to formulate an edu-cational and scienti\u0002c methodology grew out of a natural tendency toward the intelligent preservation of the accomplishments of former generations of scholars. The rapid spread of Islam threatened to bury the authority of the early Muslims under a wealth of new impres-sions and different views of the world. The methodical preservation of their genuine or assumed views, primarily in the ancient Oriental form of wisdom sayings or brief stories and parables, was the answer. The beginnings of this process no doubt date as early as the middle of the seventh century, or even earlier. Consolidation, it appears set in during the \u0002rst half of the eighth century.45 It stimulated and, in turn, was helped along by the growing acquaintance with “the plural of knowledge,” with the development of individual disciplines which necessitated a certain amount of implicit and expressed re\u0003ections on the method and procedures of scholarly activity.The most visible result of the traditionist discussion of knowledge was the permanent establishment of “knowledge” as an introductory subject for all kinds of scholarly works. The example of al-Bukhârî who moved his “Book on Knowledge” to the beginning of his authori-tative \u001ba\u0003i\u0003 was decisive. Monographs were written on knowledge. Introductory chapters or prefaces dealing with “knowledge,” and even more frequently, remarks on the excellence and merits ( fa\u000el, fa\u000eîlah) of knowledge, became a well established custom. This development was not exclusively the result of the labors of \u0003adîth compilers, but they pro-vided the earliest stimulus. They also provided the religious justi\u0002cation as well as a large body of always appropriate quotations.An example of the routine character of introductory discussions of knowledge is the addition of a \u0002rst chapter “on the excellence of knowledge and of scholars” to a work based on Su\bnûn’s Mu-dawwanah which has as its author a certain Abû Sa\u0003îd Khalaf b. Sa\u0003îd al-Barâdhi\u0003î and which was written in the late tenth century.46 The Imâm Mâlik, as we have seen, had dealt with “knowl-45 Cf. above, p. 74. For the Syriac collection of theological sayings by Joseph \u0004azzâyâ, cf. below, p. 210. n. 2. However, it was not in any way a real parallel to the traditionist treatment of knowledge. No convincing outside model seems to exist for it.46 As mentioned by J. Schacht, in Études d’orientalisme dédiées à la mémoire de Lévi-Provençal, 275 (Paris 1962). Cf.

Su\bnûn (d. 240/854), writing a large legal compilation based upon Mâlik’s work, had no particular reason to devote any space to knowledge as such. Yet, as shown by al-Barâdhi\u0003î, a century later it had become inevitable for “knowledge” to take its place in the discussion of Mâlikî jurisprudence. Further equally striking evidence for the general spread of the chapter on knowledge is furnished by Shî\u0003ah legal literature, although here the historical antecedents are much harder to unravel. The Shî\u0003ah jurist al-Kulînî (d. 328/939) begins his large Kâfî \u0002 \u0002ilm ad-dîn with a chapter on the intellect and intelligence (\u0002aql ) and ignorance ( jahl ), and then con-tinues with a long collection of edifying remarks on the excellence of knowledge ( fa\u000eîlat al-\u0002ilm).47 Later in the tenth century, another Shî\u0003ah jurist, the famous Qâ\rî an-Nu\u0003mân (d. 363/974), conformed even more closely to the traditionist custom. The \u0002rst book of his Da\u0002â\bim al-Islâm begins with the discussion of “faith,” then treats of the imâmate, and concludes with a chapter containing statements in praise of knowledge and its great importance, as found in the Qur\u0002ân and in the traditions of Mu\bammad and, principally, of \u0003Alî and other \u0003Alids. This is followed by a discussion of the men who are acceptable sources of religious knowledge, and those who are not.48 In al-Kulînî’s case, the strong adab in\u0003uence is unmistakable, and in that of the Qâ\rî an-Nu\u0003mân, certain cross-currents from speculative theology may be discerned.The custom of an initial discussion of “knowledge,” which, it seems, had its most conspicuous beginning in the \u001ba\u0003î\u0003 of al-Bukharî, reached its high point with al-Ghazzâlî (d. 505/1111) and the “Book on Knowledge” introducing his I\u0003yâ\b. Meanwhile, logic and, above all, speculative theology had established once and for all that epistemology was the basis of scholarly activity and had to be discussed \u0002rst, thereby bolstering the procedure with regard to knowledge evolved by the tra-ditionists. For al-Ghazzâlî, the problem of knowledge is no longer sim-ply one of knowledge as a correlative of faith and as the focus for the methodology of scholarship and educational theory and practice. These were naturally subjects of great concern to al-Ghazzâlî, but logic, 47 Ed n. p., 1892, 15–36. The Shî\u0003ah monographs on the excellence of knowledge, listed in an-Najâshî, Rijâl, 51, 96, 185, 266, 279) (Bombay 1317), may have been of a similar character.48 Ed. A. A. A.

His principal and almost exclusive concern is with the adju-dication of religious and moral values. He goes at great length into the determination of which knowledge, in his view, is valuable and which has to be considered harmful. The abstract concept of knowledge is no longer distinguishable here from “knowledge” as the individual, sharply de\u0002ned discipline of learning. Al-Ghazzâlî is deeply involved in the eternal problem of the necessary moral quali\u0002cations of scholars and the right and wrong of the methods they use. He is strongly in\u0003u-enced by earlier ûfî attitudes toward worldly and religious knowledge. His sympathies lie all with the latter, although he retains his practical attitude toward secular learning. He is concerned about the relation-ship between knowledge and action as the principal theme of Muslim theological ethics. He concludes his book on knowledge with remarks on the intellect, since as a result mainly of the philosophical debate, the concept of “intellect” had been pushed into the foreground of all epistemology as the presumed instrument of rational human knowl-edge. Al-Ghazzâlî’s presentation of a wealth of problems and ideas connected with “knowledge” within a comparatively small space does not have its match elsewhere in Muslim literature as far as complete-ness and human attractiveness are concerned. Most importantly, how-ever, it must not be forgotten that his book on knowledge in the I\u0003yâ\b was intended to serve as an introduction to Muslim religious practice and dogma. It is followed by a brief treatment of the basic dogmas of Islam, of the nature of God and of faith.49 Thereafter, the main religious duties are subjected to the author’s scrutiny in great detail. The arrangement of topics is thus practically the same as the one that became established by the ninth-century traditionists. Al-Ghazzâlî con-tinued their tradition, even if in so doing, he drew upon a much vaster reservoir of knowledge and ideas.If any proof of the pervasive power of cultural and literary custom with regard to the chapter on knowledge is needed, it can be found in the great Law Code (Mishne Tôrâh) of Moses Maimonides. The Law Code starts out with a \u0002rst book entitled S\u0017per ham-madd\u0006\u0002 “Book on Knowledge,” containing, as explained by the author 49 English translation by N. A.

They discuss, respectively, theology (the nature of God, of the Universe, and of prophecy); the proper behavior in eating, drinking, hygiene, dealing with other people, etc.; the rules and regulations governing the study of the law and the relationship between teachers and pupils; the reprehen-sible aspects of idol worship and the attitude Jews are required to take toward idol worship and everything that has to do with it; and sin and repentance. This last subject makes it possible for Maimonides to con-clude his “Book on Knowledge” with a few remarks on the necessity of loving God, something that can be achieved only through knowledge. Without the existence of a Bukhârî or a Ghazzâlî, and without the cul-tural tradition out of which their works grew, all these subjects could hardly have been united by a Jewish scholar under the title of “Book on Knowledge.” The different Jewish situation is most clearly re\u0003ected in the section on idol worship. For Jews living in a non-Jewish environ-ment, in this case, the Muslim environment, everything touching on Jewish relations with a real or theoretical non-Jewish world was abso-lutely indispensable knowledge for them. The remainder of the con-tents of Maimonides’ “Book on Knowledge” can be read as a summary in miniature of al-Ghazzalî’s I\u0003yâ\b. In particular, those matters of con-cern to the Muslim author for which the following detailed discussion of Jewish law offered little, if any, room, have found their place in it and, coming at the very beginning of the entire work, have been given con-siderable prominence and weight. Maimonides’ “Book on Knowledge” has been ingeniously adapted to Jewish concepts and tailored to Jewish needs with respect to “knowledge.” Like al-Ghazzâlî, Maimonides pos-sessed an original and extremely fertile mind. He did not have to have recourse to the conscious imitation of any model. However, it is obvious that his “Book on Knowledge,” occurring as it does at the beginning of the Law Code, owes its title, its being, and its place to the attitude of Muslim civilization toward “knowledge” and the trends and develop-ments described in this chapter.50 Ed.

The Knowledge and FaithThe attempts to distinguish islâm and îmân (which for the sake of convenience has been translated here as “faith”) do not concern us in this investigation. It is an ancient problem in Islam. The two terms were originally conceived by and large as synonyms. How-ever, islâm and îmân came to be seen eventually as involving pri-marily the relationship between formal religious practice and religious belief. It is in these terms that we \u0002nd the decisive discussion of the problem in al-Ghazzâlî’s I\u0003yâ\b.51 The word islâm was also occasion-ally identi\u0002ed with \u0002ilm. An interesting example—unfortunately of quite uncertain date—is the replacement of islâm by \u0002ilm in the famous, often quoted \u0003adîth of Islam appearing, or starting out, as a stranger ( gharîb) and at the end becoming a stranger again. This version, however, is rare.52As we have seen, “knowledge” (\u0002ilm) and “faith” (îmân) are equated in the Qur\u0002ân. However, this identi\u0002cation was not left undisturbed and undiscussed by subsequent generations of Muslim religious thinkers. It had to be investgated whether knowledge and faith were really identical, and how the relationship between them could best be de\u0002ned. As in the case of islâm and îmân, this involved the relationship between religious practice and religious belief, if to a minor degree. Here, it was primarily a contest between rational/material and irrational/supernatural modes of knowing and understanding. As the problem of the divine attribute of knowledge to be discussed in the following section, the problem of knowledge and faith, too, was the particular concern of Muslimspeculative theology and as such part of the history of the in\u0003uence of Greek logic and Christian theology upon Islam. It is to be seen 51 According to J. van Ess, Die Gedankenwelt des \târi\u000b al-Mu\u0003âsibî, 161 (Bonn 1961), who bases himself upon ideas expressed by L. Gardet (cf. also his Dieu et la destinée de l’homme, 369–72, Paris 1967), al-Mu\bâsibî kept îmân and islâm separate, as did the Ash\u0003arites later on, whereas the Mu\u0003tazilah considered both terms identical. This is as it should be, since for purely theological speculation, it was quite super\u0003uous to bother with making a distinction that was crucial only for those concerned with the practical side of the Muslim religion as well.

One of the early Muslims, \u0003Ubâdah b. a\t-âmit (d. ca. 34/654–55), exhorted his son al-Walîd on his deathbed in these words, as reported by a\u0006-\u0005abarî: “You will not be God-fearing, and you will not achieve knowledge until you believe in God and in predestination good or bad.”54 Knowledge is clearly conceived here as coming after faith, which appears to be the more primitive and simpler achievement. On the other hand, knowledge enjoyed precedence over the recogni-tion of the oneness of God (taw\u0003îd ). For a writer on mysticism, Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, this is proven by verses of the Qur\u0002ân such as 11:14/17 and 47:19/21. There, the formula “there is no God but God (Him)” is preceded by references to knowing.55 Thus, knowledge comes \u0002rst, and thereafter the taw\u0003îd. For Ibn \u0003Arabî, “sound knowledge” (al-\u0002ilm a\u0015-\u0015a\u0003î\u0003) is admittedly a higher stage than faith. It includes and pre-serves, yet transcends, faith.56 The high Muslim esteem of knowledge as compared to faith is re\u0003ected in the mind of a Christian scholar, Abû l-Faraj b. at-\u0005ayyib (d. 1043). On the basis of a similar reasoning as the one exhibited by Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, he argues that 1 Corinthians 12:28 shows that knowledge is superior to miracles, since Paul adopts the sequence of apostles, prophets, teachers (\u0002ulamâ\b\u0005), miracles (alladhîn yaf \u0002alûn al-mu\u0002jiz, i.e., “miracle workers”), etc.57 Ibn at-\u0005ayyib’s addi-tional argument is the restrictedness of miracles as an expression of faith both in time and in place, whereas knowledge can be found always and everywhere. This proves its superiority. In Oriental Christian tra-dition, this attitude expectedly antedates Islam. It was held at least in 53 For al-Ghazzâlî, cf. F. Jabre, La Notion de certitude selon Ghazali, 141 (Paris 1958). The identity of wisdom (\u0003ikmah) and the belief in God (al-îmân bi-illâh) is proclaimed in a saying attributed to Hermes, cf. al-Mubashshir, 15, ll, 6 ff.54 Cf. a\u0006-\u0005abarî, Annales, I, 30.55 Cf.

Paul the Persian, writing an exposition of Aristotelian logic for Khosraw Anôsharwân, says in his introductory remarks that “knowl-edge is concerned with what is near, manifest, and knowable, while faith is concerned with all the things that are remote, invisible, and not knowable with accuracy. The one (i.e., faith) is affected by doubt, and the other (i.e., knowledge) is without doubt. Now, any doubt produces schism, whereas the absence of doubt produces harmony. Consequently, knowledge is (better) than faith, and the one (i.e., knowledge) must be preferred to the other (i.e., faith). Believers, too, when questioned about (their) faith, rely upon knowledge as an excuse, saying that what we now believe in, we shall know later on.”58 Thus, only where there is the likelihood of knowledge con\u0002rming faith does faith possess value for human insight.However, some previous knowledge is necessary for the achieve-ment of faith. Beginning with the earliest stages of Muslim theo-logical speculation, “faith” was viewed and de\u0002ned as something that somehow depended on knowledge. The term used for this knowl-edge that is a condition of faith is usually not \u0002ilm but ma\u0002rifah, that is, “knowing about” the existence of certain presumed facts funda-mental to faith, without necessarily “knowing” them, that is, posses-sing or needing a deeper insight into them. Such ma\u0002rifah may be the knowledge about God, and nothing more. Or a knowledge about additional articles of faith may be considered necessary, in order to assure the presence and validity of faith. The main problem then was whether such ma\u0002rifah was suf\u0002cient by itself, or whether it had to be accompanied by some express indication of the individual’s awareness of possessing it. If we can trust the attributions of later her-esiographers—and we have little choice in the matter, since there are no direct, authentic sources for the opinions held by scholars from the early formative period of Muslim speculative theology—, Ghaylân, who lived around 700, conceived of knowledge about (ma\u0002rifah) God as a pri-mary insight coming to man through an act of God. Therefore, it is not part of faith. Faith, according to Ghaylân, is a secondary knowledge 58 Cf. J. P. N. Land, Anecdota Syriaca, IV, 2 f. (text), 3 (trans.) (Leiden 1875); P.

Sallâm, who lived \u0002ve centuries earlier, did not use the term. He showed himself righteously outraged by what he stated was the Jahmîyah’s de\u0002nition of faith, namely, “the knowledge about (ma\u0002rifah) God in the heart” pure and simple, with-out works and ritual observance, without an accompanying confession, without the acknowledgement of prophecy, and so on.65 Among later Khârijites, the Ibâ\rîyah were also said to have held the opinion that the knowledge about God alone constituted the line of separation between polytheism (shirk) and faith.66 Again, the early Abû \u0003Ubayd has nothing of the sort.67Another element was injected into the discussion, and it was one that became \u0002rmly entrenched in the majority (Ash\u0003arite) thought of Muslim theology, by the introduction of the term 59 Cf. al-Ash\u0003arî, Maqâlât, 136, also, 133; W.

When this replacement of ma\u0002rifah by ta\u0015dîq began \u0002rst to take place, the sources do not make suf\u0002ciently clear. Ta\u0015dîq occurs repeatedly as a synonym of îmân in the traditions of the Prophet.68 As used in the de\u0002nition of îmân, ta\u0015dîq literally means “declaring, or judging, to be true.” The root \u0015-d-q is found employed for translating vari-ous forms of Greek pistos. Ta\u0015dîq itself is used for rendering Greek pistis “faith.”69 In its role as a synonym of faith and, at the same time, as a constituent part of knowledge, ta\u0015dîq forcefully calls to mind the de\u0002nition, ascribed to Aristotle though not found in his preserved works, of pistis as the judgment (krima) that something is true, that follows upon knowledge (epistêmêi ).70 The similarity between this de\u0002nition and Arabic statements on faith employing the term ta\u0015dîq is such that some relationship is strongly indicated. It may have been of an indirect nature. When Greek philosophy was studied seriously in the late eighth and early ninth centuries, its approval as Aristotelian of a de\u0002nition of “faith” operating principally with the term ta\u0015dîq may have recommended that de\u0002nition to Muslim scholars and paved the way for the later triumph of ta\u0015dîq in connec-tion with faith.For the chronological problem, it would seem to be of consider-able importance that monographs on “faith” written no later than the early ninth century do not yet speak about any equation of faith with knowledge, nor do they employ the word ta\u0015dîq in any signi\u0002cant manner. This applies to the Kitâb al-Îmân by Ibn Abî Shaybah, which is a straight collection of Prophetic traditions, and to the work of the same title by Abû \u0003Ubayd, who discusses the theory of faith from the orthodox point of view.71 Outside “ortho-dox” circles, the use of ta\u0015dîq in connection with îmân is attested from 68 Cf. Concordance, III, 276 f.69 As may be seen, for instance, in the translation of Aristotle’s Physics and in the use of \u0015-d-q for translating pistis, (a)pistein in the Monostichoi of Pseudo-Menander, nos. 87 and 114 of the edition by M. Ullmann, Die arabische Überlieferung der sogenannten Menandersentenzen (Wiesbaden 1961, AKM 34, 1). In another sense, pistis in the Monostichoi, nos. 110 and 250, was translated very correctly not by a derivation from the root \u0015-d-q but by amânah. Cf. below, p. 199.70 Cf.

Al-Ghazzâlî, true to his role as the great conciliator, used it. For him, “. . . knowledge (\u0002ilm) . . . is the root and designated by the term ‘faith’ (îmân) in basic lin-guistic usage, since faith is ta\u0015dîq in the heart; if it is strong, it is desig-nated by the term ‘certainty’ ( yaqîn) . . .”79Another suggestion toward the most plausible way of correlating faith with knowledge was made by al-Mâturîdî (d. 333/944). In the creed attributed to him, al-Mâturîdî stated that islam, îmân, ma\u0002rifah, and taw\u0003îd were various aspects of man’s knowledge of God.80 And Ibn Fûrak (d. 406/1015) claimed the authority of al-Ash\u0003arî for his attempt to establish a partial equation of faith and knowledge. “Îmân,” accord-ing to Ibn Fûrak, “is believing (i\u0002tiqâd ) the truthfulness of the informant with regard to his information in a kind of believing that is knowledge; part of it is not knowledge.”81The practical theological problem was whether such belief and knowledge in the heart were suf\u0002cient to constitute acceptable faith (or islâm), or whether “acknowledgement” (in Arabic, usually, iqrâr) by express statement (bi-l-lisân, qawl ) was an additional requirement, or whether, furthermore, actions had to accompany 77 Cf. al-Bâqillânî, Tamhîd, 346, quoted also, for instance, by Ibn Taymîyah, al-Îmân, 101.The Imâm al-\u0004aramayn, Irshâd, 397, requires knowledge for îmân but apparently does not equate the two. For him, “îmân is ta\u0015dîq in God. Ta\u0015dîq is in reality the speech of the soul, and it is established only together with knowledge.”78 Cf., for instance, al-Ghazzâlî, I\u0003yâ\b, I, 103, or Abû \u0004âtim ar-Râzî, Zînah, II, 70.

All the other jurists, \u0003adîth scholars, Mu\u0003tazilah, Shî\u0003ah, and all the Khâ-rijites hold the opinion that faith is the knowledge about religion in the heart, its acknowledgement by the tongue, and action by means of the limbs of the body . . .” Ibn \u0004azm then refers to the replacement of ma\u0002rifah by ta\u0015dîq and to Abû \u0004anîfah’s de\u0002nition of faith as “belief expressed (ta\u0015dîq) by the tongue and the heart together,” as well as to the de\u0002nition which replaces ma\u0002rifah/ta\u0015dîq with still another term, \u0002aqd.83 For al-Jurjânî (740–816/1340–1413), the Ash\u0003arites were satis\u0002ed with ta\u0015dîq, the iqrâr being the beginning of the execution of the legal-reli-gious duties (a\u0003kâm). The \u0004ana\u0002tes combined ta\u0015dîq and iqrâr, to which the Mu\u0003tazilah added action.84The relationship of knowledge and faith in the mystics’ view was necessarily a close one. In their estimation, knowledge may well transcend any concept of faith, as it seemingly did for Ibn \u0003Arabî. Ordinarily, it was suf\u0002cient for ûfîs to stress the identity of know-ing God with believing in Him. Abû Sulaymân ad-Dârânî (d. 215/830) is credited with a \u0002ne statement to this effect: “The knowledge of God and the faith in Him are inseparable companions. The knowledge of God is the scale in which the faith in Him is weighed to determine increment from de\u0002ciency. For knowledge is the outward form of faith, uncovering and revealing it, while faith is the internal form of knowledge, stirring and kindling85 it. Thus, 82 Cf., for instance, the so-called Testament and the Fiqh al-akbar ascribed to Abû \u0004anîfah, in Wensinck, Muslim Creed, 125, 194, with Wensinck’s comments, 132 ff., or the creed of the \u0004ana\u0002te an-Nasafî, with the commentary by at-Taftâzânî, 432–53, trans.

Ad-Dârânî’s statement resumes, or, if its attribution is genuine, somehow anticipates, in ûfî terms, the general orthodox de\u0002nition of faith, which in ûfî usage may also be transferred to the de\u0002nition of ma\u0002rifah.88In view of the almost universal trend in Islam toward an iden-ti\u0002cation of faith with knowledge, it may come somewhat as a surprise to \u0002nd the Ikhwân a\t-\tafâ\u0002 maintaining the distinctiveness of the terms. The same Qur\u0002ânic passages which indicate to us the dentity of knowledge and faith in the mind of the Prophet are taken by the “Sincere Friends” to be a convincing indication of divine differentiation between the two. Looking at their exposition more carefully, it will be possible for us to see what caused them to take the position they did. “Because many scholars,” the Ikhwân say,89 “are not acquainted with the difference between \u0002ilm and îmân, we must explain \u0002rst what the difference consists in. Many speculative theolo-gians (mutakallimûn) call faith ‘knowledge.’ They say that faith is knowl-edge by way of traditional learning (sam\u0002 ), while what is known through ana-logical reasoning (qiyâs) is knowledge by way of the intellect. There-fore, we want to explain right now what knowledge is in reality. The philosophers (\u0003ukamâ\b ) have said that knowledge is the perception (ta\u0015aw-wur) by the soul of the distinctive characteristics of the objects known in its essence.90 If this is knowledge, the soul does not perceive it in 86 Cf. Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, Qût, I, 200. For the acceptance of the Qur\u0002ânic identi\u0002ca-tion of \u0002ilm and îmâm, cf. Qût, II, 4.87 With reference to Qur\u0002ân 30:56/56, Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, Qût, II, 38, makes it clear that separate use of \u0002ilm and îmâm in this verse means that “faith and certainty” bring with them the gift of “knowledge”, but only “useful knowledge” brings the gift of faith. This statement re\u0003ects the continuing polemics of religious scholars against “secular” knowledge.88 Cf. al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî, Kitâb al-\u0002Aql wa-l-hawâ, ed. A. S.

Consequently, such information is not knowledge, but faith (îmân), acknowledgement (iqrâr), and belief (ta\u0015dîq). It is for this reason that the prophets \u0002rst asked their particular nations to acknowl-edge (iqrâr). Then they challenged them to believe (ta\u0015diq), after clar-ity had been achieved (bayân), and then they urged them to study the true matters of knowledge (al-ma\u0002ârif al-\u0003aqîqîyah). Proof of the correct-ness of our statement is these passages from the Qur\u0002ân: ‘Those who believe in the supernatural (2:3/2),’ Here, God does not say, ‘. . . know the supernatural.’ God urged the people to seek knowledge, saying: ‘Consider, men of understanding,’ or ‘men of insight (59:2/2).’91 Then, God uttered praise, saying: ‘God will lift up by degrees those of you who have come to believe and those who have been given knowledge (58:11/12).’ And He said: ‘Those who have been given knowledge and faith (30:56/56).’ This is suf\u0002cient (proof of the existence of ) a differ-ence between knowledge and faith.”In connection with the study of the true matters of knowledge (ma\u0002ârif ), according to the Ikhwân, every human being can be classi\u0002ed according to one of four categories. There are those who have been provided with knowledge but not with faith; those who have been pro-vided with faith but not with knowledge; those who have been blessed with both; and those who are deprived of both. The Ikhwân them-selves, they say, have been given an abundant share of both faith and knowledge. They are meant by the verse of the Qur\u0002ân 58:11/12 just quoted. There are different degrees of believers, as there are differ-ent degrees of scholars. Their conclusion is rather lengthily summed up by the Ikhwân in this manner: “Since the excellence of both knower and believer as well as the meaning of knowledge and faith are now clear, we want to mention the quiddity of each and explain their quantity and quality. Now then, knowledge is the form of the object known in the soul of the knower,92 and faith is believing (ta\u0015dîq) one who knows better than you about the information he gives93 you about what you do not know . . . Faith is believing an informant with regard to what he says and gives information about . . . Faith leaves behind as its inheritance knowledge, because faith is prior in existence to 91 The latter is the exact expression used in the Qur\u0002ân.92 Cf. above, de\u0002nition of knowledge E-1, p. 60.93 Text: does not give (?).rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 10610/17/2006 5:48:14 PM"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"knowledge. Therefore, the prophets asked the nations to acknowledge (iqrâr) \u0002rst what they had given them information about, and to believe (ta\u0015diq) matters supernatural that their senses were not able to perceive (idrâk) or their imagination to picture (ta\u0015awwur). When they expressed acknowledgement with their tongues, the prophets called them ‘believ-ers’ (mu\bminûn). Then, they challenged them to believe (ta\u0015dîq) in their hearts, as mentioned by God in the Qur\u0002ân 64:11/11: ‘The heart of him who believes in God, He guides aright.’ When belief (ta\u0015dîq) entered their hearts, the prophets called them \u0015iddîqûn ‘true believers,’ as stated in the Qur\u0002ân: ‘He who comes with the truth and believes (\u0015ad-daqa) in it, they are the ones who fear God (39:33/34).’ “The beginning of faith was the belief of the prophets in the information given them by the angels, and the angels themselves need faith and possess it in vari-ous degrees. “You, too, should know that you need faith and belief in the words of your informant who is superior to you in knowledge and above you in information (ma\u0002ârif ), because, if you do not believe in the information he gives you, you will be deprived of the noblest knowledge (\u0002ulûm) and the most important information (ma\u0002ârif ). You will realize that at the beginning, the only possible way for believing your informant is having con\u0002dence (\u0003usn a\u0012-\u0012ann) in his truthfulness (\u0015idq). Then, in the course of time, the truth of that will become clear to you. Thus, do not seek proof from him at the beginning. Rather, try to picture (ta\u0015awwara) in your mind what you hear with your ears. Thereafter, seek a method and proof. Do not be satis\u0002ed with blind acceptance, when you have gotten halfway toward knowledge, and do not seek proof when you are at the beginning.

The relegation of faith to the limbo of traditional knowledge, as against the certainties of intellectual knowledge, would more likely be the the knowledge and faith  107rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 10710/17/2006 5:48:14 PM"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"108 knowledge is islamwork of philosophers and skeptics than of Mutakallimûn. But then, the Ikhwân do not really appear to be intent upon a separation of knowl-edge from faith. They stress the primacy of faith as far as the process of initiation into knowledge is concerned, but the real purpose of faith is the eventual achievement of knowledge, of true esoteric knowledge as advocated by the Sincere Friends, through a process which forcibly recalls Ismâ\u0003îlî views and practices. For the Ikhwân, as for most other Muslims, faith is inextricably connected with knowledge. But faith here is something quite different from the faith of the theologians. It is not “islâm” or a set of beliefs. It is merely a tool, to be discarded after use, of the seeker of knowledge—who can be presumed to have very little interest in any formal sort of religious faith and belief.94This helps to explain why there is so much evidence for the equation of faith and knowledge in Muslim religious writings, and so little for the opposite point of view that the two have nothing to do with each other. Those who felt that faith was to be kept separate from knowledge were the ones who were inclined to favor rationalist or esoteric knowl-edge and to play down the importance of formal faith. Since “faith,” however, was a sacred term of religion, it was only prudent for such thinkers to avoid public discussion of the term outside their own groups whenever possible, and not to use it when belief was under discussion merely as an element of epistemology. Thus, we rarely \u0002nd clear-cut statements of views on the distinctiveness of knowledge and faith. On the other hand, the vast majority of Muslims were conditioned by the Qur\u0002ân and the history of the term \u0002ilm to see “faith” as a function of “knowledge,” or vice versa, and they were not disposed toward swerving from their engrained habits of thought. They felt that both belonged together in the Islamic context and added mutually to their respective prestige as culture terms.3. God’s KnowledgeThe divine attribute (\u0015ifah) of \u0002ilm “knowledge” and the “name” of \u0002alîm or \u0002âlim “knower” used for God cannot be separated from all the other attributes and names considered as belonging to the Deity. In theological discussion, they were at times seen as different 94 These observations do not apply to less intellectual levels of Ismâ\u0003îlism where îmân, it may be recalled (above, p. 23, n. 2), could be de\u0002ned as “the knowledge of the truth (reality).”rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 10810/17/2006 5:48:15 PM"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"categories, making a distinction between the names, the attributes, and, within the attributes, between a restricted number of “essential” attri-butes. More rarely, distinctions were attempted within the major cat-egories. The most convincing explanation of all the problems raised in this connection would have been one that offered a uni\u0002ed theory opening up the whole complex \u0002eld of the divine attributes as with one master key and admitting of easy application to all its aspects. In any such theory, “knowledge” could not have been treated differently from the other attributes. However, no master key was ever found. In the many attempts to explain the problems of the divine attributes, the very nature of the concept of knowledge gave it a special and con-spicious position. “Knowledge’ is found winding its way throughout the entire discussion of the attributes, in particular, the essential attributes of which it was considered one. It was, indeed, “the mother of the divine attributes.”95From the earliest times, probably from its very beginning, Muslim theology was preoccupied with the divine attributes.96 It maintained its passionate interest in them and considered them a central problem after other important subjects of discussion, such as the character of the leadership of the Muslim community (imâmah “caliphate”), had faded into the background. Islam, it seems, never knew any theological speculation that did without them. The concept of God’s knowledge, His omniscience, was an ever present 95 Cf. al-Kalanbawî (d. 1205/1790–91), in his Gloss to ad-Dawwânî’s Commentary on al-Îjî’s \u0002Aqâ\bid al-\u0002A\u000eudîyah, II, 2 (Constantinople 1316).According to Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1178b7 f., 21, perfect happiness is a theôrêtikê energeia, and the energeia of God is such a theôrêtikê energeia. In Graeco-Muslim philosophy, this is transformed to read, “The only virtue that may be ascribed to God is knowledge,” cf. Kitâb as-Sa\u0002âdah, 7. The transformation may be due to some intermediary such as a Greek commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics or on the lambda of the Metaphysics.96 As indicated above, the historical sequence of the early discussion cannot now be determined with any certainty and is of no real consequence for this study. The \u0002rst requirement for any attempt at sorting out the various opinions historically would be detailed collections of all the fragments ascribed to each major \u0002gure. Whether this will lead to the desired result, is doubtful, but it has not been seriously attempted. A premature and incomplete attempt to collect all the material according to individual theologians chronologically arranged in translation was made by M. Horten, Die philoso-phischen Systeme der spekulativen Theologen im Islam (Bonn 1912), a work quite admirable for its time. However, Horten attempted too much interpretation, giving the impression of sure knowledge where there were, and still are, at best, hints and clues. god’s knowledge  109rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 10910/17/2006 5:48:15 PM"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"110 knowledge is islamreality to scholars in whatever \u0002eld of intellectual endeavor they hap-pened to be engaged.A very de\u0002nite purpose was behind the discussion of the divine names and attributes. It explains why that discussion was so heated and why it never stopped. This purpose is as easy for us to perceive as it was near impossible for Muslims to admit and express. It was to provide rational reassurance for the existence of God. Of\u0002cially, it was maintained that the existence of God was a fact vouchsafed by necessary knowledge and independent of all the discussion about His attributes.97 However, if it was possible to show exactly in which way God differed from human beings in those human terms which belonged to Him according to the divine revelation of the Qur\u0002ân, then the existence of the Deity, stated so boldly and uncompromisingly by the Law, became comprehensible to the human mind. Custom and tradition may have contributed to keeping alive the discussion of the long exhausted topic, but its amazing vitality was the result of its essential purpose which was to show that God could be “described” and, therefore, could not be denied exis-tence. The argument was of necessity circular. If God exists, it must be possible to describe Him. And if it is possible to describe Him, then there can be no doubt of His existence. Thus, an unmistakable aura of unreality envelops the entire endless discussion of the attributes in gen-eral, and of God’s knowledge in particular. It is always obvious that the argument depends upon assumed and completely arbitrary premises. As a result, we \u0002nd that for every point of detail, opposite views could be, and were, argued with equal vigor and conviction, if, of course, not with equal historical success.It is in a way surprising that the Muslims took to the debate about the manner in which traditional anthropomorphic descrip-tions of the Deity were to be understood and explained with such zeal and at such an early date in Muslim history. The Qur\u0002ân is quite explicit on such matters as God’s knowledge, and the later popular understanding of what God’s knowledge was never went beyond elaborating the concept in terms such as those put together al-Ghazzâlî: “God knows (\u0002âlim) all objects of knowledge and comprehends whatever takes place (in the world) from the bound-aries of the earth to the highest point of heaven. He is knowing 97 Cf., for instance, the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn, Irshâd, 28–31, 191.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 11010/17/2006 5:48:15 PM"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"(\u0002âlim) in a way which makes it certain that the weight of a particle of dust on earth and in heaven does not escape His knowledge. Indeed, He knows the scurrying of a black ant upon a hard rock in a dark night. He perceives the motion of the mote in the air. He knows what is secret and hidden. He observes the innermost thoughts that occur, the ideas that stir, and the secrets that are concealed in the heart.”98 With these words, al-Ghazzâlî does not mean to cater to popular feeling and intellectual limitation, even if they express well how ordinary people pictured God’s knowledge. Each one of them echoes the theological discussion of preceding centuries. This becomes much clearer from his concluding words: “(God knows) by means of a primeval (uncreated, qadîm)99 and eternal knowledge that has never ceased to be an attribute of His in all eternity, and not by means of a knowledge that is constantly new and arrives in His essence through in-dwelling and transference.” Long exposure had accustomed a large number of medieval Muslims to accept such dif\u0002cult terminology. On the other hand, most of the spec-ulation behind it remained accessible only to the very few. “The under-standing of the masses does not suf\u0002ce to understand such subtleties.”100 This was the way Ibn Rushd put it in the twelfth century, but it must have been clear from the outset that the speculation about the divine attributes was far above the heads of the followers of the new religion, and that it spelled trouble. While probably no theologian meant to doubt openly that God had “life,”101 or was willing to admit bluntly that God did not have “knowledge,”102 the mere asking of questions about the concept of God raised the spectre of an embarrassing inability 98 Cf. al-Ghazzâlî, I\u0003yâ\b, I, 80, ll, 3 ff., and 96.99 “Primeval” seems an appropriate translation for qadîm. It is a way to avoid using “uncreated” or “eternal”, for which other words exist in Arabic. “Primeval” somehow re\u0003ects the root meaning of the word which, it is true, may no longer have been felt. Qadîm has therefore been translated here consistently by “primeval,” with an occasional reminder in brackets that “uncreated” is what is meant.100 Cf. Ibn Rushd, Tahâfut at-Tahâfut, trans. S. van den Bergh, I, 215.101 Cf. al-Ash\u0003arî, Maqâlât, 503.102 Cf., for instance, the Kitâb al-\taydah, ed. Jamîl alîbâ, 51 f. (Damascus 1384/1964), ascribed to \u0003Abd-al-\u0003Azîz al-Kinânî, who lived in the \u0002rst half of the ninth century (cf. Sezgin, I, 617): “Do you acknowledge, Bishr (al-Marîsî), that God has knowledge, as we have been informed (by the divine revelation), or do you contradict the revelation? Bishr dodged the answer, not wanting to express unbelief openly by saying, ‘God does not have knowledge.’. . .” For the discussion and its meaning, cf. below, p. 120. god’s knowledge  111rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 11110/17/2006 5:48:15 PM"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"112 knowledge is islamto answer them and of coming up with answers that might have appeared convincing to some but were in apparent contradiction to the words of the divine revelation. The conviction that it was better not to ponder the “how?” of the divine attributes rapidly gained ground. Why, then, was the discussion started in the \u0002rst place? It could be hardly doubted that we must see in it a continuation of the similar dis-cussion that had long occupied Christian theology and the Hellenistic world in which Christianity had gained maturity. However, why did the Muslims take up so readily something that was strange and foreign to them and, moreover, did not constitute any clear-cut practical gain for pious and fervent believers? Again, we are confronted with the mystery of intellectual creativity. Among the early Muslim theologians, there must have been many with Christian antecedents who merely trans-ferred their accustomed patterns of thought to the new religion. Also, Muslim scholars were forced to some degree to combat Christian theo-logical criticism of Islam on the home ground of the attackers with the techniques employed by them. The principal motivation, however, seems to have come from a creative force unleashed by a move-ment which felt driven to remodel the higher civilization of the time of which it itself was an underprivileged offshoot. Since it was a religious movement, its \u0002rst major effort was directed toward meta-physical questions; the other branches of philosophy and science were taken up and assimilated at a somewhat later stage. The initial impulse was naturally to seize eagerly and appropriate whatever there was there. But then, the new creative force went to work turning it into something much larger and more powerful than it had been before. Christian theology provided the \u0002rst opportunity for Muslims to become acquainted with the question of the divine attributes. Almost immediately, however, Islam went far beyond its original source of inspi-ration. According to John of Damascus, God knows (epistatai ) all things, and He has an all-encompassing foreknowledge (synhektikê pronoia) and knows (eidenai ) all things before their creation ( genesis).103 Yet, other lists 103 Cf. John of Damascus, Pêgê gnôseôs, 808 f., 919, trans. Chase, 177, 207. According to Watt, Free Will, 58, n. 27, the entire formulation of the problem of predestination (qadar) in Islam is different from the ideas expressed by John of Damascus. For the rela-tionship of John of Damascus with Muslim speculative theology in general, cf. also, for instance, Wensinck, Muslim Creed, 77 ff. and passim; M. S. Seale, Muslim Theology, 30 ff. and passim (London 1964).rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 11210/17/2006 5:48:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"of divine attributes in the Damascene’s work do not include “know-ing.” Already, it seems, at the same time and possibly even earlier, but certainly not very long thereafter, Muslim theologians bandied about a whole plethora of the most subtle questions concerning the concept of divine knowledge. It is fairly certain that the elaboration was their own and constitutes the creative response to the presence of ideas which they would have done better to keep away from. But such is the power of ideas that once they exist, their spread is dif\u0002cult and often impos-sible to halt.The Muslim discussion of God’s knowledge concentrates on the term \u0002ilm, as against any other term of cognition, including the root \u0002-r-f. Yet, it should be noted that the Testament attributed to Abû \u0004anîfah ascribes ma\u0002rifah to God and sharply distinguishes the function of this ma\u0002rifah in God from that of the \u0002ilm possessed by Him. God’s ma\u0002rifah appears to be a momentary awareness of happenings, serving as a supplement and, if such a term may be used in connection with God, corrective of His eternal and consistent knowledge.104 But the root \u0002-r-f is not employed in the Qur\u0002ân in connection with God. And, whether \u0002-r-f was consid-ered a synonym of \u0002-l-m or differentiated from it in the conventional manner in which terms of intellectual perception may be differentiated from each other, \u0002-r-f never really entered the discussion of the divine attribute of knowledge. According to the Mu\u0003tazilah al-Jubbâ\u0002î (b. 235/849–50, d. 303/916), God could indeed be given the name of \u0002âlim, if (human) reason indicates that He is knowing, even if He Himself had not applied to Himself the name of “knower.” However, the Baghdâdî school of Mu\u0003tazilah did not admit this possibility. They thought that “ \u0002âlim has the same meaning as \u0002ârif, but we designate God as ‘ \u0002âlim,’ because He has thus designated Himself, and we do not designate Him as ‘ \u0002ârif,’ ” and this applies to other synonyms of \u0002âlim, such as fahim.105A philological explanation of the inapplicability of \u0002-r-f to God was given by Abû Hilâl al-\u0003Askarî (d. 395/1005). He proceeded from the argument of az-Zuhrî106 which went as follows: “I do not describe God as \u0002ârif, though I do not blame anyone who describes Him thus, because ma\u0002rifah is derived from the \u0002irfân of the man-104 Cf. Wensinck, Muslim Creed, 126 f.; Seale, Muslim Theology, 18.105 Cf. al-Ash\u0003arî, Maqâlât, 525.106 I am not sure about the identity of this Zuhrî, if this is indeed the correct form of the name. god’s knowledge  113rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 11310/17/2006 5:48:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"114 knowledge is islamsion, that is, the traces (âthâr) which serve to make the mansion in ques-tion recognizable (\u0003-r-ƒ ). It is not permissible to assume that God’s knowledge of things comes from effect (‘trace’) and indication (dalîl ). Ma\u0002rifah is the act of distinguishing (tamyîz) between the objects of knowledge.” For al-\u0003Askari, \u0002-l-m is a transitive root that may take two objects (“to know someone/something as something”), whereas \u0002-r-f is restricted to one object (“to know, to recognize, to be acquainted with someone/something”). The grammatical difference is indicative of the difference in meaning that exists between the two roots. \u0002-r-f indicates the distinction of one object of knowledge from another (“to know Zayd,” as distinguished from somebody else). \u0002-l-m does this only by virtue of some other kind of particularity connected with the object of knowledge referred to (“to know Zayd as standing”). Ma\u0002rifah is more restricted than \u0002ilm, because it is the knowledge of only some aspect of something. \u0002Ilm, on the other hand, is both comprehensive and detailed knowledge. “Every ma\u0002rifah is an \u0002ilm, but not every \u0002ilm is (necessarily) ma\u0002rifah.” The objects of knowledge may be assumed to be distinct in God, and ma\u0002rifah shows their distinctiveness, but God’s knowledge is not the act of making a distinction between objects.107 Consequently, it is something more than ma\u0002rifah and cannot properly be called ma\u0002rifah.Basically the same line of argument was followed by later scholars, as it presumably had been by scholars prior to the time if Abû Hilâl al-\u0003Askarî. Ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî (11th century) connects \u0002-r-f with the meaning of “smell” or of “border, rim.” He views ma\u0002rifah (opposite inkâr) as more restricted in meaning than \u0002ilm (opposite jahl ), inasmuch as it is “the perception of something by re\u0003ecting about and ponder-ing over its effect (athar ‘trace’),”108 obviously an inferior way of per-ception inadmissible in God. Certain scholars contended that there was no difference between the two roots and their applicability or inap-plicability to God. The basis for their contention was the Qur\u0002ânic pas-sages 8:60/62 and 9:101/102 which mention God’s knowing (\u0002-l-m), that is, being acquainted with, someone and the simultaneous not 107 Cf. al-\u0003Askarî, Furûq, 14, 62 f.108 Cf. ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî, Mufradât, III, 103, s.v. \u0002-r-f. Cf. also below, p. 134. According to ad-Dawwânî, as quoted by al-\u0003Âmilî, Kashkûl, I, 397 (Cairo 1380/1961), “others” held the same opinion, probably before and after ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 11410/17/2006 5:48:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"knowing of human beings. However, Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzîyah (691–751/1292–1350), who reports this view,109 prefers the more common view that \u0002-r-f is inapplicable to God’s knowledge. \u0002-r-f, he contends, means simple knowledge (such as knowing about Zayd and about stand-ing), whereas \u0002-l-m means composite knowledge (such as knowing that Zayd is standing). Therefore, “some Mutakallimûn have maintained that since in contrast to created beings, God knows simple and com-posite things without distinction, the root \u0002-r-f is inapplicable to Him.” For Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzîyah, this is based upon the theory, which he is not willing to accept, that God knows everything in the same way (His knowing the truth of the Prophet being identical with His knowing the untruth of the pseudo-prophet Musaylimah). He himself believes in the differentness of the various objects of knowledge and of the knowl-edge by which each is known. Therefore, it must be the root meaning of \u0002-r-f which precludes its use for God. \u0002-r-f indicates cognition, mental or physical, of someone or something, after having forgotten or lost touch with him/it and the unscrambling of a confused notion—which, of course, is a state of affairs never present with the Deity.110 Still another explanation along these lines was offered by ash-Sharîf al-Jurjânî. In contrast to \u0002ilm, ma\u0002rifah to him implies either of two notions. One of them is “perception following upon ignorance,” and the other, “the last of two perceptions of one and the same thing which are separated by non-being (non-understanding, \u0002adam).”111 Neither is a \u0002tting descrip-tion of God’s way of knowing.The discussion of the “grammarians,” as he characterizes them, was taken up by Ibn \u0003Arabi and transformed by him with that 109 Cf. Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzîyah, Badâ\bi\u0002, II, 62 f. The author refers to one of his other works, entitled at-Tu\u0003fah al-Makkîyah, where the subject was treated in greater detail.110 According to a saying ascribed to Plato, “the difference between knowing about (ma\u0002rifah) a thing and knowing (\u0002ilm) it is that ma\u0002rifah is remembering what one has forgot-ten, whereas \u0002ilm of a thing means that aspects of it not perceived before become \u0002rmly established in one’s soul.” Cf. Ibn Hindû, al-Kalim ar-rû\u0003ânîyah, 27 f. (Cairo 1318/1900). This part of the edition does not seem to belong to Ibn Hindû’s text but was added by the editor, Mu\t\u0006afâ al-Qabbânî, from some unidenti\u0002ed collection of Platonic sayings.111 Cf. al-\u0003Âmilî, Kashkûl, I, 397, citing the Gloss of ash-Sharîf ar-Ra\ri to the Shar\u0003 Ma\u000fâli\u0002 al-anwâr.

The occasion seized by Ibn \u0003Arabî for discussing the matter came in connec-tion with the place name \u0003Arafah. The locality near Mecca was named \u0003Arafah, Ibn \u0003Arabî suggests, because of the noble character of “ma\u0002rifah which is identical with \u0002ilm.” Since in Arabic, \u0002-r-f takes only one object, oneness (a\u0003adîyah) belongs to ma\u0002rifah, and ma\u0002rifah is an especially noble term for knowledge. “Ma\u0002rifah, in a way, is knowledge (\u0002ilm) of the divine oneness, whereas \u0002ilm, in contrast to ma\u0002rifah, applies to oneness as well as to other matters.” The grammarians, referring to the Qur\u0002ânic verse 8:60/62, which is customarily cited in this discussion: “You do not know (\u0002-l-m) them, God knows them,” conclude that \u0002-l-m here takes the place of \u0002-r-f, and thus takes one object and has relation to oneness. But, Ibn \u0003Arabî says, they neglected to pay attention to something known to him and to his fellow mystics, namely, that \u0002ilm also strives after oneness, and therefore may rightly be called ma\u0002rifah. In practice, ma\u0002rifah is not used as an attribute of God, although it falls under the same de\u0002nition as \u0002ilm, yet, ma\u0002rifah is one of the synonyms (“names”) of \u0002ilm, and the term \u0002ârif is used by the mystics as a designation of the knower of one-ness. The oneness in the root \u0002-l-m lies in the fact that “knowing Zayd as standing” does not aim at a knowledge (\u0002-r-f ) of Zayd and of his stand-ing but at the relationship that is implied in the statement, which is one object, while the grammarians wrongly assumed that the knowledge of the relationship between Zayd and his standing was identical with the knowledge of Zayd and of standing. However, both Zayd and the standing must have been known before a relationship between them can be known.112A philosophical distinction between the meanings of the two roots, as may be found in the Mu\u0002tabar of Abû l-Barakât,113 starts from the concept of simple and compound data and leads to the result that \u0002ilm is more restricted in meaning than ma\u0002rifah but for this reason represents a more complex stage of intellectual activity. Ma\u0002rifah is more general than \u0002ilm and prior to it. Since everything composite contains the simple elements from which it is compounded, every \u0002ilm contains some ma\u0002rifah which is the 112 Cf. Ibn \u0003Arabî, Futû\u0003ât, I, 636.

However, since not all simple matters appear in composition, the opposite is not correct, and not every ma\u0002rifah is connected with an \u0002ilm. Abû l-Barakât states elsewhere114 that \u0002ilm goes beyond ma\u0002rifah also in that it requires for its realization an additional element of judgment. In these passages, Abû l-Barakât is not at all concerned with the idea of divine knowledge. The distinction would, however, have been applicable if God’s knowl-edge had been under discussion.During the late stages of medieval Islam, all these re\u0003ections on the relationship between \u0002-l-m and \u0002-r-f were at times thrown together under the general impression that no plausible and valid distinction could be made between the two roots. Thus, in the introduction of his essay on ma\u0002rifah, Mu\bammad b. Qu\u0006b-ad-dîn al-Iznîqî (d. 885/1480)115 cites the distinction between the ûfî \u0002ârif and the \u0002âlim made by Kamâl-ad-dîn al-Kâshâni to the effect that “the gnostic (\u0002ârif ) is the one whom God allows to witness His essence, attributes, names, and actions, with gnosis (ma\u0002rifah) being a state originating from witnessing the truth by means of the truth together with the remain-der of the true form (rasm) which is illuminated116 by the light of the Essence and the ray of the one (?) face, whereas the knower (\u0002âlim) is the one to whom God gives knowledge not through witnessing but through certainty.”117 However, al-Iznîqî’s further remarks on the subject of mystic ma\u0002rifah pay no attention to “knowledge,” and he seems to pre-fer the view that both terms are linguistically identical. He draws upon 114 Cf. Abû l-Barakât, Mu\u0002tabar, II, 395, III, 2, see above, p. 53, de\u0002nition A-14.Two centuries earlier, the superiority of \u0002ilm over ma\u0002rifah was defended by the author of the Kitâb al-Bad\b wa-t-ta\brîkh, believed to have been a certain al-Mu\u0006ahhar b. \u0005âhir al-Maqdisî. He adopted the view that \u0002ilm is the comprehension of the essence and the de\u0002nition of the thing as such, whereas ma\u0002rifah is the perception (idrâk) of the essence and persistence (thabât) of the thing, even without a perception of its essence and real-ity. \u0002Ilm is thus more general and far-reaching than ma\u0002rifah. Everything known (ma\u0002lûm) is at the same time known about (ma\u0002rûf ), while not everything known about is also known. The intellectual means for attaining cognition (ma\u0002rifah) are the instruments for the achievement of knowledge. Cf. the edition and translation by C. Huart, Le Livre de la création, I, 21 f.

He draws upon phi-lology by mentioning the related argument of the two objects of \u0002-l-m as against the one object of \u0002-r-f, and from theology, he derives the argument of the inapplicability of \u0002-l-m to man’s knowledge of God, since \u0002-l-m implies total comprehension of universals, whereas \u0002-r-f is employed with regard to particulars (and implies partial knowledge). Further, since ma\u0002rifah implies understanding (idrâk) after ignorance or a secondary understanding interrupted by a period of non-understand-ing (\u0002adam), neither of which is the case in connection with \u0002ilm, God can be called \u0002âlim, but He cannot be called \u0002ârif.118Much additional ingenuity was no doubt spent by other Muslim schol-ars upon the explanation of the inapplicability of the root \u0002-r-f to divine knowledge. Regardless of the possible degree of truth or probability these speculations contained—and it must be rated very low indeed—, the fact remains that God’s knowledge was properly designated only by the term \u0002ilm. The ûfî Abû Sa\u0003îd al-Kharrâz expressed the situa-tion with admirable succinctness by stating that “God knew (\u0002-l-m) you, before you knew about (\u0002-r-f ) Him.”119 Going beyond the immediate mystic concern of its author, this statement shows the great difference in value which Muslim consciousness attached to the two roots.The basic point of contention with regard to God’s knowledge and knowing was the question of eternality. Complete denial of the possibility of employing any descriptive attribute in connection with God was in \u0003agrant contradiction to the Qur\u0002ân, but “philo-sophers” went occasionally so far as to describe God merely as “eternal.”120 With regard to the eternality of His knowledge and His knowing, the formula, “He has not ceased knowing” (lam yazal \u0002âliman), \u0002nally won the day. Certain radical Shî\u0003ah theologians are said to have denied it,121 whereas the Mu\u0003tazilah accepted the 118 For al-Iznîqî’s work, I used the Topkapusaray manuscript Ahmet III 3163 (Catalogue Karatay 7446), which contains it on fols.

Either alternative was defended.149 The com-promise solution that God’s knowledge was neither identical with Him nor other than Him, hard as it is to understand, was the natural escape from the dilemma.150 From the statement that God’s knowledge was identical with Him or with His essence,151 it was nly a short but dangerous step to the statement that “the knowl-edge of God is God,” which the Jahmites are supposed—it seems, wrongly—to have taken.152 We are told by both Muslim and Jewish authors that among Christians, Jesus the Son is considered as identical with the divine knowledge.153 The tenth-century Qaraite 144 Cf. al-Ash\u0003arî, Maqâlât, 187 f.145 Cf. al-Ash\u0003arî, Maqâlât, 188, 497.146 Cf. al-Ash\u0003arî, Maqâlât, 164.147 Cf. al-Ash\u0003arî, Maqâlât, 165, 188, 508.

Thus, God’s \u0002ilm and life are two hypos-tases, and the essence ( jawhar) is the third. Since knowledge is generated by the knower like as the son is generated by the father, knowledge is the son of God. All this, it is contended, goes back to the Greek word logos in that “knowledge” for the Christians is identical with “speech” (nu\u000fq).154 The Imâm al-\u0004aramayn prefers to use “the word” (al-kalimah) in this connection.155 While there were quite a few Christian Arab authors who equated the Son or the Holy Ghost with wisdom or knowledge, the equation of the persons of the Trinity with divine attributes cannot be traced in the works of the Christian Church Fathers. Neo-Platonic in\u0003uence has been suggested for its origin, as well as for the origin of the “essential” attributes which are in the center of Muslim theological speculation.156Another line of thought concerning the nature of God’s knowledge among early Muslim theologians led to the assumption that it was a “thing” (shay\b\u0005), as maintained by the Zaydî Sulaymân b. Jarîr.157 Others, that is, the Mujassimah ( Jahmîyah?), countered that it was not a “thing,” but an “idea” or “concept” (ma\u0002nâ).158 An eccentric concept of God’s knowledge was developed in much later years by of Alexandria, Stromata, IV, 317, ll, 21 f., and similar passages. See, for instance, E. F. Osborn, The Philosophy of Clement of Alexandria, 38 (Cambridge 1957): “God is undemon-strable and cannot be the object of knowledge; but the Son is wisdom . . .”154 Cf. al-Qirqisânî, Kitâb al-Anwâr wa-l-maarâqib, ed.

God’s knowledge of Himself, according to as-Suhrawardî, is His being a light unto Himself, and His knowledge of things is their being apparent to Him by themselves or by their re\u0003ection in the cos-mic scheme. God’s knowledge is identical with His luminous quality (nûrîyah), as are indeed the other attributes of “the Light of lights.”159 As as-Suhrawardî was well aware, all this does not differ radically from other attempts of explaining God’s knowledge of Himself and of the world; it was merely a consistent application of his Neo-Platonic ideas of light.The interminable discussion, sketched so brie\u0003y on the preceding pages, was not just an exercise in metaphysical speculation divorced from human affairs. On the human level, the understanding of the concept of God’s knowledge was pivotal for deciding whether there could be some degree of freedom for human action or whether rigid predestination had to prevail. If God were to know what human beings were going to do, they could not be held responsible for their actions.160 If God’s knowledge was true omniscience, that is, the knowledge of everything particular and universal; if it was eternal and immutable, man’s fate was of necessity determined in all its details. God’s knowl-edge meant more for the problem of human freedom than God’s power or God’s will. His power and His will could, in theory, be so construed as to leave some choice for human beings. But God’s knowledge had to know, if there was a choice, what the outcome was to be, or it was imperfect knowledge, unworthy of God. Thus, there could be no real choice whatever, if God was truly omniscient. A conditional knowl-edge, in the sense that “God will punish the unbeliever, if he does not repent, and lot punish him, if he does,” was advocated by some Mu\u0003tazilah.161 The idea does not seem to have met with much favor and acceptance, and deservedly so. The primeval pen has written down all of God’s knowledge to the end of days on the well-guarded tablet.162 ‘The pen has dried upon the knowledge of God,” a well-known 159 Cf. as-Suhrawardî, \tikmat al-ishrâq, ed.

Alexander of Aphrodisias had already taken notice of its existence in the second century in his treatise “On Providence,” which was translated into Arabic by Abû Bishr Mattâ (d. 940) and has been preserved only in this Arabic translation. Muslim theologians of the eighth and ninth centuries were fully aware of the relationship between knowledge and power and will as well as of the necessity of somehow restricting God’s knowledge in order to assure at least a modicum of human self-determination. Yet, the contention that God does not know what is not, and that He does not know what is before it is,164 had to give way to the determinist point of view that He knows what is not, and that He knows what is before it is.165 The radical attempt ascribed to the ahl at-tashbîh (meaning the Jahmîyah??) to make room in God’s all-encompassing foreknowledge for human freedom of action by making an exception for human actions “which He knows only at the stage of their coming-into-being, because if He knew who would be obedient to God and who would be disobedient and a sinner, He would intervene between sinner and sin,”166 seems to have found as little of an echo as the more modest formula in favor of a conditional knowledge in God cited above. The dif\u0002cult problem whether God had the power to go against His previous knowledge and change it, and, spe-ci\u0002cally, whether as an act of grace (la\u000fîfah), He had the power to turn a man who He knew would not believe into a believer,167 appears not to have been capable of a satisfactory solution in the positive sense.168 163 Cf.

However, this is a possibility in God and is within His power, and remains such; what He knows will not happen, thus de\u0002nitely will not happen.169 Whether God’s knowl-edge was identical with His power, was another debated point. Abû l-Hudhayl al-\u0003Allâf is said to have suggested that it is wrong to say that God’s knowledge is identical with His power, and that it is wrong to say that it is not identical with His power.170Life is in a way prior to knowledge. On the human level at least, it is obvious that nobody can acquire knowledge without being alive.171 However, proof for the First Principle being alive may, on the other hand, be deduced from Its knowing Its own essence.172 The existence of knowledge is not compatible with death.173 While probably post-erior to, or coextensive with, life, knowledge is certainly prior to power and will, because only knowledge provides a sensible basis for the exercise of power and will. This would seem to be an anthro-pomorphic presupposition which may be entirely inapplicable to the Deity, but Muslims mostly took its correctness for granted without much apparent re\u0003ection, at least during the earlier stages of the discussion. A late summary of the problems of divine knowledge by al-Îjî mentions, however, as the muttakallim proof for its existence God’s well ordered actions and His being powerful (qâdir) as necessitating His knowl-edge.

He wills the acts of obedience and disobedience that He knows (will be) . . .”177 A restrictive connection of knowledge and will, on the other hand, is supposed to have been formulated by adherents of the extremist Shî\u0003ah theologian, Shay\u0006ân a\u0006-\u0005âq, as follows: “God knows the things only when He has determined (qaddara) and willed them. Before that, it is impossible for Him to know them, not because He is not knowing, but because a thing is not a thing until He determines and establishes it through determination equated with will.”178 The argument that knowl-edge must precede will was also turned around in the sense that “God does not know a thing until He creates the will. If He creates the will that it be, He is knowing that it will be. If He creates the will that it be not, He is knowing that it will not be. And if He does not create a will that it be, or a will that it be not, He is neither knowing that it will be, nor knowing that it will not be.”179God’s supposed knowledge has played a large and fateful role in the history of Muslim society and Muslim individuals as the most immovable and least manageable source of determinism. Another important connection of the concept of divine knowledge with human affairs consisted in the fact that the speculation about God’s knowledge in\u0003uenced the speculation about the character of human knowledge. God’s knowledge was generally thought of 174 Cf. al-Îjî, Mawâqif, 285–90.175 Cf. \u0004amîd-ad-dîn al-Kirmânî, Râ\u0003at al-\u0002aql, ed. M. Kâmil \u0004usayn and M.

In fact, while these men make a distinction between the primeval and uncreated (qadîm) knowledge of God and the created knowledge of man, which they consider to be of a different order, they state that “the three kinds of knowledge, i.e., the primeval knowledge of God and the two subdivisions of created knowledge, do not differ, inasfar as a thing constitutes knowledge, in being ‘the cognition of an object known as it is.’ ”181 Such a statement would seem to be a suf\u0002cient justi-\u0002cation for Ibn \u0004azm’s contention, although the identity of divine and human knowledge is only in reference to the object known. In another work, Ibn \u0004azm put his relevant objections to the Ash\u0003arites in these words: “They say that there ought to be no difference in de\u0002nitions whether they apply to the primeval (qadîm) or the created (mu\u0003dath). This is a statement that has unbelief as its necessary consequence, for they thereby make the Creator fall under the category of creat-edness (\u0003udûth), because everything de\u0002ned (ma\u0003dûd ) is \u0002nite and com-posite, and everything composite must be created (makhlûq), because it is composed from its genus and its differentia, which makes it to be distinguished from what belongs together under its genus. Thus, they make their Lord out to be created (mu\u0003dath)!”182 However, the general view universally entertained among Muslims certainly was that God’s knowledge was something different, and, we may add, something rather oppressive from the human point of view. The idea of the existence of such overpowering divine knowledge could hardly have been a source of inspiration for feeble human efforts at acquiring knowledge. Yet, the debate of God’s knowledge also included certain elements of human epistemology, such as the question of the identity of self-knowledge 180 Cf. for instance, Wensinck, Muslim Creed, 189; Maimonides, Guide, I, ch. 35, III, ch. 20. trans.

It also kept alive the discussion of “knowledge” long after nearly all hope had been lost that a secular discussion of the meaning of knowledge would be permitted to continue except in very small, restricted circles. It made knowledge the most discussed item of learned theological speculation, which was so prominent and important that the common people also could not ignore it. By its mere stress on “knowledge,” it helped to sus-tain the value level of the concept and, in fact, endow it with all the awe surrounding the numinous.4. Man’s Knowledge of GodThe phrase “knowledge of God” is ambiguous in English, since it may have God as either the subject or the object of knowing. Employing “God’s knowledge” for the one, and “man’s knowledge of God” for the other, is the somewhat clumsy expedient adopted here in order to avoid ambiguity. In Arabic, an easy syntactic distinction is possible by means of the use of \u0002ilm Allâh for the former, and al-\u0002ilm bi-llâh for the latter. However, \u0002ilm Allâh was also employed, if rarely, for man’s knowledge of God, let alone such specialized usages as “theology” or the knowledge God bestows upon mankind of Himself or the like.183 Fortunately, the context leaves hardly ever much room for confusion. While linguistically close, the two notions moved on greatly different levels. The knowledge possessed by God was treated, as we have seen, as a problem of divine ontology and epistemology. Man’s knowledge of God, on the other hand, was by and large considered as something divorced from any rational or pseudo-rational speculation and as constituting an unfathomable mys-tery of man’s emotional being. This applied to man’s \u0002ilm of God as well as to his ma\u0002rifah “gnosis” of God where the emotional element was preponderant from the outset. It must be stressed again here, as it will be once more soon, that the two terms tended to blend, unless a conscious effort was made to keep them apart. The discussion of whether and of how man can know God has been an unending one in Islam. “Much 183 This particular usage attaches to \u0002ilm Allâh in the phrase al-qanâ\u0002ah bi-\u0002ilm Allâh, frequent in al-Mu\bâsibî.Ma\u0002-rifah may be followed by a depending genitive as a genitivus objectivus or by the preposition bi- without any apparent distinction, but it is always al-\u0002ârif bi-llâh. man’s knowledge of god  129rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 12910/17/2006 5:48:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"130 knowledge is islamtalk (and many different opinions) about God are a sign of man falling short of the knowledge (ma\u0002rifah) of Him.” This remark, attributed to Pythagoras in the Graeco-Arabic gnomic literature, obviously failed to make an impression upon Muslim scholars. Pythagoras is also stated to have expressed himself convinced of “man’s potential for a knowl-edge of God through few words, by not directing his attention to know-ing his fellow men but, it seems, through a contemplative withdrawal into himself. This sentiment in a way fell on more fertile soil in Muslim minds.184It has been noted that man’s knowledge of God is not mentioned in the Qur\u0002ân.185 Man knows, or ought to know, all the particulars about God. He knows, or ought to know, that God knows every-thing (5:97/98), that He sees everything (96:14/14), that He hears and knows (2:244/245), that He has power over everything (2:259/261, 65:12/12). But there is no express statement to the effect that man knows God, using either the root \u0002-l-m or the root \u0002-r-f. There is one passage in the Qur\u0002ân, the interpretation of which is, however, con-tested, that might conceivably contain a clue as to the possible reason for the failure of the Qur\u0002ân to speak of man’s knowledge of God. This is sûrah 20:110/109 which reads: “He (God) knows what is before them and what is behind them, while they do not comprehend it/Him in knowledge (wa-lâ yu\u0003î\u000fûna bihî \u0002ilman).”186 Some modern transla-tors of the Qur\u0002ân into European languages have taken the view that the pronoun in bihî refers to God. Among them were E. H. Palmer (1880), M. Henning (1901), and the most recent English and French trans-lators, R. Bell (1937–39), A. J. Afberry (1955), and R. Blachère (1949–51).

The brief and undocu-mented article appears to be mainly concerned with man’s knowledge of God.186 “Comprehend in knowledge” is an attempt at a literal rendering of the Arabic idiom. In fact, it means nothing more than “to know.” A\u0003â\u000fa “to comprise, to compre-hend” indicates intellectual comprehension with or without the qualifying accusative \u0002ilman or khubran. In addition to the passage under discussion, only Qur\u0002ân 18:68/67, 91/90, 27:84/86, and 65:12/12 feature such qualifying accusative.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 13010/17/2006 5:48:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"behind them”) is much longer. It includes such translators as A. du Rye r187 and L. Marracci in the seventeenth century, G. Sale and M. Savary in the eighteenth century, L. Ullmann and J. M. Rodwell in the nineteenth century, and, among the most recent scholars, the Russian I. Krachkovsky (1963, published posthumously) and the German R. Paret (1963 [1966]).188 The reader who consults any of the translations mentioned is not being told that the translators in either case made a rather important choice from the theological point of view. They did so, it seems, rather lightheartedly, without being greatly concerned about the consequences. Muslim commentators were much less sure of the correct understanding of the passage and expressed themselves with considerable hesitation. A\u0006-\u0005abarî thus left it open whether the passage should be interpreted to mean: “His creatures do not comprehend Him in knowledge, in the sense that He comprehends His servants in knowl-edge, while they do not comprehend Him in knowledge,” or whether, as some scholars had thought, the meaning was that “God knows what is before His angels and what is behind them, and His angels do not com-prehend in knowledge what is before themselves and what is behind themselves.”189 A\u0006-\u0005abarî’s preference seems to go to the \u0002rst interpre-tation. The second interpretation becomes necessary only it the subject is assumed to be the angels of whom it must not be said that they do not comprehend God, on the basis of a very uncertain interpretation of the preceding verse (“On that day, intercession will be of no use except [by ?] one to whom the Merciful One permits and whom He likes to speak up”) implying that the reference to intercession there rules out human beings as the subject.Later commentators were de\u0002nitely in\u0003uenced by theological considerations concerning God’s knowledge. Their preference would seem to go to the interpretation of the pronoun as having as its antecedent the preceding relative clauses. The \u0011âhirite Ibn \u0004azm, it is true, appears \u0002rmly convinced that bihî refers to the knowledge 187 The French original uses an ambiguous le (with a small l ), but the English transla-tion (London 1649, p. 105) has “it”.The medieval Latin translation of 1143, published by T. Bibliander (Basel 1543, l, 103, ll. 23 f.). omits the sentence.188 Cf. also above, p. 121. The translations mentioned here represent a random selec-tion. No attempt has been made to \u0002nd out whether the explanation of the pronominal suf\u0002x as referring to God appears in European translations before that by Palmer.189 Cf. a\u0006-\u0005abarî, Tafsîr, XVI, 142. man’s knowledge of god  131rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 13110/17/2006 5:48:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"132 knowledge is islamof God which human beings are unable to possess in its entirety. For anything that can be comprehended by knowledge in its entirety would have to be limited and \u0002nite, and God, of course, is neither limited nor \u0002nite. Ibn \u0004azm is also inclined to interpret the phrase “some of His knowledge” in Qur\u0002ân 2:255/256 as indicating a limited knowledge of God that man may have, if it is given to him by God.190 For az-Zamakhsharî, who is well known for his Mu\u0003tazilah tendencies, there is also no doubt that bihî of 20:110/109 must be combined with \u0002ilmihî of 2:255/256. However, in both instances, \u0002ilm is to be understood in the sense of ma\u0002lûm “object known.”191 No essential knowledge of God is therefore involved in either passage.Other commentators were often less willing to take a \u0002rm stand. A Shî\u0003ah contemporary of az-Zamakhsharî, a\u0006-\u0005abarsî, who died in the \u0002fties of the twelfth century, paraphrased the Qur\u0002ânic passage as follows: “They do not comprehend God in knowledge, meaning His objects of power and knowledge, or, according to another inter-pretation, the substance of His majesty (kunh \u0002a\u0012amatih) in His essence and His actions. Another interpretation explains ‘it’ in ‘they do not comprehend it in knowledge’ as what is before them and what is behind them, except those whom God enables to know (a\u000fla\u0002a) that. That interpretation goes back to al-Jubbâ\u0002î. Another interpreta-tion has it that the passage means: ‘They do not perceive it by means of some of the senses, so that their knowledge would comprehend it.’ ”192 A specimen of Shî\u0003ah interpretation from much later times may be found in a commentary by the eighteenth-century Yemenite \u0005ayyibî-Ismâ\u0003îlî writer, Diyâ\u0002-ad-dîn Ismâ\u0003îl b. Hibatallâh (d. 1173/1760). He interprets the pronominal suf\u0002x in bihî as referring to His (that is, \u0003Alî\u0002s) knowledge and position (maqâm).193 However, for another late Syrian Ismâ\u0003îlî author, Shihâb-ad-dîn al-Maynaqî, there is no question but that the pronoun refers to God and that the passage offers incon-190 Cf.

Their knowledge does not comprehend His store of knowledge. 2. Their knowledge does not comprehend His essence (in this case, bihî “Him” is interpreted to mean “His knowledge” as an essential attribute). And 3. the pronoun refers to one of the two preceding relative clauses, or to both of them (a distinction possibly prompted by the unjusti\u0002ed assumption that if it referred to the two-pronged relative clause, it ought to be in the dual), “since they know neither the totality of it nor part of what they know in detail.”197If we dispense with all exegetically or theologically determined subtleties of interpretation, it is perfectly obvious that the pronom-inal suf\u0002x must be understood as “it,” according to the common Arabic usage of having a pronoun refer back to a preceding sentenceor thought expressed. “It” thus means “their entire fate as known to God.” If it were possible to understand the pronominal suf\u0002x as referring to God, we might have here the authentic explanation of the reason for the lack of any mention of man’s knowledge of God in the Qur\u0002ân. As some of the Muslim interpreters did in fact assume, the reason which made the Prophet hesitant to speak about knowing God would be that man was felt by him to be unable to have a comprehensive knowledge of God.

If the Qur\u0002ân also never speaks of know-ing about (\u0002-r-ƒ) God, this might have had its reason in the Prophet’s \u0002rm conviction of God’s manifest existence which did not require man’s acknowledgement or needed to be made one of the subjects of the Prophetical preaching. Yet, all this is quite uncertain. For all we know, the assumption of mere chance may be the preferable explanation for the absence of any mention in the Qur\u0002ân of man knowing God.In his philological discussion of the Qur\u0002ânic vocabulary, ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî stated that it could well be said that “someone knows about (\u0002-r-ƒ) God,” but it would not be possible to say that “someone knows (\u0002-l-m) God,” because the human knowledge about (ma\u0002rifah) God derives from re\u0003ection about the observable signs of His works but is not, as the term \u0002ilm would imply of necessity, a perception of His essence.198 This kind of reasoning is hardly applicable to the language and intellectual climate of the Qur\u0002ân. Nor is it a distinction that could be said to \u0002t the later history of the idea of man’s knowledge of God in Islam in any consistent manner. \u0002Ilm and ma\u0002rifah came to be employed with little tangible distinction in this respect, although ma\u0002rifah may appear to have been the term more commonly used. The real distinction derived from the various purposes connected with the notion of knowing God in the minds of those who spoke about it. The subject as such was taken up and discussed in Islam at a very early date, even if it did not constitute a topic of discussion in the Qur\u0002ân. This is hardly surprising, seeing that it had engaged the mind of man since pre-historic times and was particularly alive in Christian circles,199 whence some stimulus for its discussion might have come to Muslim scholars.198 Cf. ar-Râghib al-I\tfahâni, Mufradât, III, 103, cf. above, pp. 114 f. Similarly also ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî, Tafsîr, as quoted on fol. 1a of the Istanbul Ms. Carullah 2080 (above, p. 39, n. 2).For the Judaeo-Christian view that God is known by His works and His creation, cf., for instance, the early ninth-century Job of Edessa, who argued that, therefore, our knowledge of the causes of created beings was the knowledge of them as well as of God (Book of Treasures, ed., trans. A. Mingana, 298a, trans., 2 f. [Cambridge 1935]).199 Cf., for instance, E. Norden, Agnostos Theos, 3 (Leipzig-Berlin 1913).

It is permissible for God to transfer the eye to the heart and give it the power of knowledge (\u0002ilm), so that the heart may know through it; this knowledge then is seeing God in a beati\u0002c vision, and that is knowing Him.206 According to al-Jubbâ\u0002î, God’s description as “existing” (mawjûd ) meant that He was an object of knowledge or know-able (ma\u0002lûm),207 a reversal of the theory that every object of knowl-edge was existent. In later centuries, little remained to be said about the subject from the majority point of view. As explained by ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî, God was recognizable by His works. An intimate, essential knowledge of Him was not possible. Corresponding to the Qur\u0002ânic contention that man can know only what God wants him to know, a Hermetic saying reported by al-Mubashshir made the point that human beings would not be constituted to achieve knowledge (ma\u0002rifah) of the majesty of God, were it not for the fact that He has made Himself 200 Cf. above, pp. 99 f.201 Cf. al-Ash\u0003arî, Maqâlât, 100, 132.202 Cf.

Among mystics, the knowledge of God was a crucial concept. For them, it included as a rule the entire process of mystic “gnosis” and constituted the \u0002nal culmination of it. Much of the debate had its roots in the ancient conception of the cogni-tion of like through like. In Antiquity, this theory was widely (if, it seems, wrongly) believed to have originated with Pythagoras and his followers. However this may have been, it played a considerable role in Greek epistemological speculation and is encountered under many disguises.210 It obviously entailed the exclusion of any knowledge of God by man, unless it was assumed that man possessed in himself some part of the divine, enabling him to “assimilate to the divine” (homoiôsis theôi ) and to obtain at least some imperfect knowledge of God. Such was, indeed, the accepted doctrine of Neo-Platonists, mystics, and Christians in late Antiquity. From there, it passed on directly to the Muslims. û\u0002sm, deeply committed as it was to the basic inowability of God, at times succumbed to the harsh realization that a knowledge, of God was pos-sible only for God Himself.211 Usually, it avoided this realization, which was incompatible with its very being, by stating expressly that it was the true knowledge if God, the knowledge of the divine reality (\u0003aqîqah), that was unattainable to human beings. A few words of al-Ghazzâlî develop the ancient theory of homoion-homoiôi in its application to the knowledge of God in a manner eminently comprehensible to the208 Cf. al-Mubashshir, 11.209 Thus, for instance, Abû l-Barakât, Mu\u0002tabar, III, 130, entitled a chapter: “On the scienti\u0002c (\u0002ilmiyah) methods by which man by means of his knowledge (\u0002ilm) comes to the knowledge (ma\u0002rifah) of God.”210 Cf.

When he has attained his professor’s rank, he knows him almost in the way the pro-fessor knows himself . . . I would even say that it cannot be conceived that an impotent man could truly know about the condition attained by a person during cohabitation . . .” Al-Ghazzâlî goes on to say that even for low animal life such as ants and gnats, it must be assumed that any true knowledge of their being is possible only for ants and gnats, that man has no true knowledge of himself and as a rule knows about himself only through the actions and characteristics of his self (soul), while ignoring its quiddity, “and once man knows that he is of necessity unable to perceive212 the essence of God’s majesty, he has attained what is the end of his perfection, as this is the goal of human perfection.”213The need for the divine spark in man in connection with his know-ing of God through the medium of knowing himself is at the core of the famous pseudo-\u0003adîth, at times endowed with great holiness, “He who knows about (\u0002-r-ƒ) himself, knows about His Lord.” It was eagerly embraced by Muslim mysticism. In pre-Islamic times, we \u0002nd its closest model in the Paedagogus of Clement of Alexandria (heauton gar tis ean gnôi, theon eisetai ), where the variation between gignôskein, the traditional verb for self-knowledge, and eidenai, for the knowing of God, may be noted.214 The idea of gnôthi seauton as a means for understanding the mysteries beyond the human self did not require speci\u0002c mystical implications in any technical sense.

Nallino, Raccolta, II, 469.217 There is the not uncommon use of \u0002ilm al-ma\u0002rifah “the science of gnosis,” employed, for instance, by Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî in his Qût (for \u0002ilm al-ma\u0002rifah and ma\u0002rifat al-ma\u0002rifah, cf. also below, p. 167). Understandably, the reverse, ma\u0002rifat al-\u0002ilm, was less current, but cf. al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî (above, p. 38, n. 3), fol. 61a, speaking of the occupation with “the cognition of the knowledge of God” (ma\u0002rifat al-\u0002ilm bi-llâh). In \u0003Alî’s exhortation of Kumayl (below, p. 256, n. 5), the phrase ma\u0002rifat al-\u0002ilm apparently refers to the cognition of knowledge as a recommendable rule (dîn yudân bih), although a somewhat different interpretation (the knowledge about the excellence, or the honor, or the necessity, of knowledge being a religious duty) was given by Ibn Abî l-\u0004adîd, V, 436. For a further and more detailed discussion of the various meanings of ma\u0002rifah and \u0002ilm for û\u0002sm, see below, chapter VI.A seemingly strange juxtaposition of \u0002ilm and ma\u0002rifah occurs in the beginning of the rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 13810/17/2006 5:48:24 PM"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"distinction was often, but by no means always, small or non-existent. The ninth-century mystic Abû Sa\u0003îd al-Kharrâz employed the two terms next to each other as apparent synonyms.218 People who fol-low the stations set up by al-Kharrâz reach “the high station, and the knowledge (\u0002ilm) of God, and the noble station, and, as a result, they will get to joy and ease, and to being favored with the knowledge (ma\u0002rifah) of God . . .”219 Both the \u0002ilm and the ma\u0002rifah of God may be possessed to a greater or smaller degree by human beings, and thereby they are distinguished in virtue and excellence.220 Al-Junayd used both ma\u0002rifah and \u0002ilm for the knowledge of God.221 The desire to \u0002nd an early Islamic precedent shows in the attribution to Umm ad-Dardâ\u0002, a woman tradi-tionist of the \u0002rst century of the hijrah, of the following remark: “The most excellent knowledge (or science, \u0002ilm) is the gnosis (ma\u0002rifah).” This remark supposedly prompted an unidenti\u0002ed poet to rhyme:Best of us is the one most excellent in knowledge (ma\u0002rifah)And whenever a human being knows about (\u0002-r-f ) God.222At the peak of human gnosis, man’s knowledge of God may appear associated with the love of God. An early ûfî is said to have re-marked that he loved God, because God had bestowed upon him, among other favors, his knowledge of Him.223 And a writer on mystic love mentions a group holding the opinion that “love is ma\u0002rifah” and that ma\u0002rifah “occurs after the full realization of love.”224 The combination of the knowledge of God with His love was, of course, as little restricted to û\u0002sm225 as that of the knowledge chapter on knowledge in az-Zamakhsharî’s Rabî\u0002 (Ms. Yale L-5, fol. 183a; al-Ibshîhî, Musta\u000fraf, I, 23), where it is said in praise of knowledge that “through knowledge (\u0002ilm) God is known (\u0002-r-f ) and His oneness acknowledged.” \u0002Ilm is here again the theological information through which it is possible to know about God.218 Cf. al-Kharrâz, \u001bidq, 41, 70, 73, but cf.

This is the way he expressed this idea: “Your reaching your Lord means your reaching the knowledge of Him (al-\u0002ilm bih). Except for that, God’s majesty excludes that anything might unite with Him, or that He might unite with anything.”228In fact, the possibility or impossibility of man’s knowledge of rod depended in ûfî thinking upon the various views concerning the general relationship of man to the divine. Where union was considered attainable, or where monistic doctrines entered the \u0002eld, some human knowledge of God was automatically admitted. But at the same time, it could also be said bluntly that “only God knows God.”229 Abû Yazîd al-Bis\u0006âmî felt that the claim to “gnosis with regard to the essence, of the Truth (= God) was ignorance,” and the claim to “knowledge with regard to the reality of gnosis was a crime.”230 The mystic Abû \u0003Alî Ibn al-Kâtib, who lived in the 226 Cf.

The ûfîs declared God to be remote for knowledge, and they proved right.”231 The intellect itself was unable to state who God was, until God anointed its eyes with the light of divine uniqueness, for, as al-Kalâbâdhî developed this theme, the only guide to God and the knowledge of God is God Himself.232 A\bmad b. \u0003A\u0006â\u0002 dis-tinguished between two ma\u0002rifahs, of God, the ma\u0002rifah of truth (\u0003aqq) and the ma\u0002rifah of reality (\u0003aqîqah). The former, being the cognition of God’s oneness through His names and attributes, is possible for human beings, whereas the latter is unattainable to them.233 For Ibn \u0003Arabî, knowledge of the reality of the divine essence is precluded. “Knowledge of God” means the knowledge of His existence, which is nothing other than His essence. Yet, His essence is unknowable, and only the attributes of ideas and perfection ascribed to Him can be known.234Another maxim most tellingly expresses the dilemma caused by the gap between the mystic’s emotional and intellectual claim to nearness to God and the unknowability of God. This is the famous maxim which proclaims that “the inability to perceive is perception.”235 An Ismâ\u0003îlî paraphrase of it put into the mouth of Ja\u0003far a\t-âdiq the statement that God has turned the Muslims’ acknowledgement of their inability to know (ma\u0002rifah) Him into faith on their part in Him.236 The maxim was also ascribed anachronistically to the caliph Abû Bakr who said in a sermon: “Praised be God who prepared the way for man’s knowledge of Him (ma\u0002rifatih) just through his inability of attaining a knowledge of Him.”237 For Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, one of those who quoted Abû Bakr’sreplaced by “confusion.” See also H.

It is to be understood as the most essential part of the mystic endeavor and of the mystic concept of knowledge in general. With its emphasis on the desirability and, basically, possibility of know-ing God through some sort of essential knowledge or gnosis, mysticism attempted to \u0002ll a vacuum left by the theologians and provided for the discussion of an aspect of knowledge which was all but read out of exis-tence by the various concepts of God’s being and knowledge evolved in the theological debate about the divine attributes. The majority con-sensus, however, reached eventually was again expressed clearly and forcefully by al-Ghazzâlî: “The knowledge about (ma\u0002rifah) God is the end of every cognition (ma\u0002rifah) and the fruit of every knowledge (or science, \u0002ilm) according to all schools of thought.”239 There is no true knowledge of God for man, but human knowledge an achieve some realization of His being.5. Shî\u0003ah Notions of KnowledgeAt the present limited stage of our knowledge of authentic Shî\u0003ah lit-erature, it does not seem possible to make many meaningful distinctions between the various Shî\u0003ah groups in dealing with Shî\u0003ah notions of “knowledge.” In spite of the great differences in outlook and attitude that prevailed among the Shî\u0003ah, much of what will be said here would seem applicable to most of them. Naturally, more attention has been paid to what would appear to be views of a more radical character, as it is there that we encounter the more different and, therefore, more note-worthy ideas. As we have seen, Shî\u0003ah groups and individuals partici-pated in the discussion of God’s knowledge.240 They also participated in 238 Cf. Ibn \u0003Arabî, Futû\u0003ât, II, 160, 170.

While the \u0012âhir, the outward appearance, of everything is what is observed by the senses, the bâ\u000fin, the inner reality, depends for its establishment on knowledge.242 For a man like Nâ\tir-i-Khosraw in the eleventh century, faith and knowledge were almost identical concepts.243 More or less peculiar to Shî\u0003ism were such matters as 1. the special knowledge possessed by ‘\u0003Alî and the imâms among his descendants; 2. the use of ma\u0002rifah for the knowledge of the essentials of Shî\u0003ah beliefs (which in a way parallels the early use of ma\u0002rifah in the de\u0002nition of “faith”); 3. the esoteric symbolism of knowledge, which seems to have been restricted by and large to Ismâ\u0003îlism; and 4. the particular manner in which secular knowledge was related to religious concerns.1. Religious knowledge was, of course, stressed in Islam generally as a quali\u0002cation for the leadership of the Muslim community, but the extraordinary role played by the Shî\u0003ah imâms led to some-times extravagant claims for them as depositories of all knowledge natural as well as supernatural. In keeping with its early origins antedating the development of Shî\u0003ah extremism, Zaydî theory exhibits moderate views also in this respect. The extent of the Zaydî imâms’ knowledge and independent judgment (ijtihâd ) is in principle, limited to the ability of following and evaluating the scholarly discussion.244 Thus, the knowledge required of them is not really much different from what is required of the caliphsZaidietische Imamaat in Yemen, 250, 263 (Leiden 1919), French trans., 287 (Leiden 1960). Cf. also the treatment of the divine attributes by al-Maynaqî, Î\u000eâ\u0003, 83 ff., 106–11 (above, pp. 132 f.): God is unknowable, and consequently, He can be said to be knowing only metaphorically, and not in reality. He can also not be said to be knowing in the sense of the de\u0002nition of knowing as possessing knowledge. God knows through His essence, and not through a knowledge. If the divine knowledge were identical with God, it would be possible to invoke God by saying, “O knowledge, provide for us . . .!” (and this is something that is obviously not done). For the last item, cf. the remarks ascribed to Abû l-Hudhayl al-\u0003Allâf in al-Ash\u0003arî, Ibânah (above, p. 122, n. 9).241 Cf. above, pp. 91 f., 94.242 Cf. the Qâ\rî an-Nu\u0003man, Asâs at-ta\bwîl, ed. \u0003Ârif Tâmir, 28 (Beirut, n.y.

Abu Nu\u0003aym, \tilyah, I, 61, speaks of \u0003Alî as “the gate of the city of knowledge and the sciences” (al-\u0002ilm wa-l-\u0002ulûm). Cf. Ibn Taymîyah. Fatâwî, I, 465–474 (Cairo [1966?]), etc.Madînat al-\u0002ilm occurs as a book title and may have been inspired by the \u0003adîth in the case of the famous tenth-century Shî\u0003ah author, Mu\bammad b. \u0003Alî b. Bâbawayh al-Qummî, among whose works it is listed, cf. a\u0006-\u0005ûsî, Fihrist, 185. This is not abso-lutely certain, since the expression is also used as an ordinary metaphor even by Shî\u0003ah authors, as, for instance, by adr-ash-Sharî\u0003ah ath-thâni \u0003Ubaydallâh b. Mas\u0003ûd (d. 747/1346) who began his work with the words: “Praised be God who gave the city of knowledge an elevated (entrance) gate, a location dif\u0002cult of access, and a construc-tion resting upon a strong foundation, as well as sturdily built gates, (forti\u0002ed) castles overlooking the whole, and walls protected against any dislocation” (cf. the Istanbul Ms. Carullah 1350 mükerrer). In the introduction of his Miftâ\u0003 as-sa\u0002âdah, \u0005âshköprüzâdeh described “the city of knowledge” in terms reading, in the somewhat shortened form of a re-worked version: “The city of knowledge is located far away and is made dif\u0002cult of access by (strong) walls.

It may be added here that the Istanbul Ms. Köprülü, I, 1387, does not have madînat al-\u0002ilm in its title, as indicated in GAL, II, 453, but madînat al-\u0002ulûm “city of the sciences.” It is apparently identical with the abridgment of the Miftâh as-sa\u0002âdah listed in GAL, II, 426, Suppl., II, 633.

And it was believed by some that all this detailed knowledge was known to all the successive imâms exactly as it was to \u0003Alî.248 The imâm is knowing. He knows everything, as he is with regard to all his affairs on one level with the Prophet.249 But \u0003Alî and the imâms after him possessed not only the Prophet’s knowledge of this world and the next world. They also were in the possession of additional knowledge such as the Prophet had not possessed. This knowledge, which was greater than the knowledge of the Prophet, was passed on by the imâms in the direct line of their suc-cession. It was a knowledge with which they were born and which they had no need of being taught.250 Some Shî\u0003ah sect is said to have con-demned as unbelievers and polytheists all those who dared to deny the equivalence of the imâms’ knowledge with that of the Prophet. In their view, too, the knowledge of the imâms, the descendants of the Prophet, who are “the life (\u0002aysh) of knowledge and the death of ignorance,”251 comes to them not through study, but they are taught their knowl-edge as an act of grace (lu\u000ff ). It grows in them, “just as the rain makes the seed grow.”252 Thus, it is only natural to assume that even the youngest among the chosen \u0003Alids possess suf\u0002cient knowledge to qualify for the imâmate.253 While the Zaydîyah believed that the religious knowledge of true belief was shared by all the people,254 the exclusive status of the imâm as the sole possessor and source of all knowledge was more generally recognized. It was, for instance, the pervasive theme in a work ascribed to an early Shî\u0003ite follower of the Imâm Ja\u0003far a\t-âdiq, al-Mufa\r\ral b. \u0003Umar al-Ju\u0003fî. “My Lord,” 247 Cf. an-Nawbakhtî, Firaq, ed.

This does not necessarily imply that the Shî\u0003ah concept of the knowledge of their imâms involved any kind of dei\u0002cation. The knowledge of the imâms is both natural and supernatural. They may transmit to other human beings as much religious knowledge as they deem necessary and advisable. There is no way for ordinary mortals to acquire valid religious knowledge except through the imâms. However, the element of eternality so crucial for the concept of divine knowledge is absent in the individual manifestations of the imâms’ knowledge. The knowledge of the imâms passes through them and does not stay with them as individuals, at least, in their mortal state. Admittedly, the distinction is a rather subtle one, and its existence might not always have been acknowledged, and it might have even been expressly rejected in extremist circles. At any rate, with the incarnation in the imâms of “knowledge,” of a knowledge so absolute and superhuman, their supernatural standing is tremendously enhanced and approaches divine status as closely as possible. In the Shî\u0003ah view, knowledge of the highest kind exists continuously on earth with the existence of imâms. Knowledge, and the spreading of knowledge among deserving humans, is the ultimate reason of their being and, consequently, it can be said, of all existence. This surely constitutes an apotheosis of the concept of knowledge hardly matched elsewhere in the Muslim environment.2. An unusually large number of early Shî\u0003ah works bears the title of Kitâb al-Ma\u0002rifah. The lifetime of the authors of these works covered the period from the second half of the eighth cen-tury through the early tenth century. Among them we \u0002nd Shay\u0006ân a\u0006-\u0005âq (or, as he was called in Shî\u0003ah circles, Mu\u0002min a\u0006-\u0005âq);256 A\bmad b. \u0003Alî al-\u0003Aqîqî, a sixth-generation descendant of al-\u0004usayn b. \u0003Alî;257 Ismâ\u0003îl b.

Drawing conclusions from the title of a work as to its contents is always an uncertain enterprise. Thus, a reputed Shî\u0003ah author, \u0003Abbâd b. Ya\u0003qûb ar-Rawâjinî (d. 250/864), is credited with a Kitâb al-Ma\u0002rifah, but its subtitle, fî ma\u0002rifat a\u0015-\u0015a\u0003âbah mentioned at the same time, tells us that we are dealing here presumably with a work containing biographical information on early Muslims.266 However, most of the Kitâb al-Ma\u0002rifah appear listed in con-junction with other titles clearly referring to works on topics from the religious law and theology. There can be little doubt that in some if not all of them, ma\u0002rifah is to be understood to refer to the knowledge about matters of Shî\u0003ah religious faith and dogma, possibly often with particular reference to the question of the imâmate and the problem of how the incumbent can be recognized as such by the faithful.267 From a period subsequent to that of the authors mentioned, we hear about a Kitâb \tudûd al-ma\u0002rifah by the famous Ismâ\u0003îlî-Fâ\u0006imid Qâ\rî an-Nu\u0003mân. In another one of his works, the Qâ\rî an-Nu\u0003man describes it as deal-ing with the Ismâ\u0003îlî explanation of the Qur\u0002ân (ta\bwîl ) and the exposi-tion of the bâ\u000fin in a polemical vein directed against those who do not258 This was the opinion of a\u0006-\u0005ûsî, Fihrist, 35, l. 9, 38, l. 9.

Extremist Shî\u0003ah sets de\u0002ned “faith” as the ma\u0002rifah of the Imâm. “He who does not know bout (\u0002-r-ƒ) him does not know about God,” cf. an-Nawbakhtî, Firaq, 42, 46.

The discussion in the Mughnî suggests that separate chapters on ma\u0002rifah were no doubt to be found in all relevant Mu\u0003tazilah writings,280 in addition to the monographs on the subject.3. Allusions to knowledge in many disguises were found by Ismâ\u0003îlî thinkers in the Qur\u0002ân and elsewhere in the authoritative religious literature. Thus, the “property” (mâl ) mentioned in the story of Nû\b/Noah in the Qur\u0002ân 71:21/20 is to be interpreted eso-terically as knowledge.281 The “water” upon which Noah’s ark was \u0003oating is likewise to be understood as knowledge. Like as a ship saves its passengers from drowning, thus true believers are saved by the life of the spiritual, light-\u0002lled (rû\u0003ânî, nûrânî) knowledge from the death of unbelief. Like as the ship, in the exoteric meaning of the word, takes its course upon the waters and carries its passengers, thus the true call (da\u0002wat al-\u0003aqq) takes its course upon knowledge and carries upon it those who enter into it and accept it. In Arabic linguistic usage, we are told, the interpretation of “water” as knowledge is con\u0002rmed by the common \u0002gure of speech that calls a man of vast knowledge an “ocean.” Moreover, the comparison of water and knowledge suggests that just as those who would sail the sea without a ship would drown in it, those who look for knowledge among those who do not have it will perish.282 Again in connection with the story of Noah, we hear 278 Cf.

The comparison of mâl with \u0002ilm, like that of mâ\b “water” with \u0002ilm, is a recurring topic in the work.It may be mentioned here that the divine throne (kursî ) of Qur\u0002ân 2:255/256 was widely interpreted to mean God’s knowledge, cf. a\u0006-\u0005abari, Tafsîr, III, 6f.; az-Zamakbsharî, Kashshâf, I. 278 f., etc. Abû \u0004âtim ar-Râzî, Zînah, II, 151, stressed the Mu\u0003tazilah origin of this interpretation, following Ibn Qutaybah. Cf. Ibn Qutaybah, al-Ikhtilâf fî l-laf\u0012, ed. M. Zâhid al-Kawtharî, 38 f. (Cairo 1349) (where, however, it is not expressly stated that it was “knowledge” that was meant by kursî ).282 Cf. an-Nu\u0003mân, Asâs at-ta\bwil, 78 f. shî\u0003ah notions of knowledge 149rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 14910/17/2006 5:48:28 PM"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"150 knowledge is islamit said at a late stage of Ismâ\u0003îlî scholarship that the devil (iblîs) of Noah was \u0004âm who saw and showed to his brothers the private parts of his father Noah (the Qur\u0002ân does not refer to this Biblical episode). This means that \u0004âm revealed to others the knowledge that had come to him from his father and which must not be revealed except to those \u0002t to receive it.283 In connection with the Qur\u0002ânic story of the Thamûd and their prophet âli\b (26:155/155), it is stated that laban “milk” sym-bolizes esoteric knowledge.284 And once more the word mâl, in the apoc-ryphal \u0003adîth: “A sick man owns one-third of his property,’ ” is explained to refer to knowledge. It is the spiritually sick man who is acquainted only with the knowledge of the ear (al-\u0002ilm as-sam\u0002î ) but not with the two other \u0002ilms, the knowledge of the eye (al-\u0002ilm al-ba\u0015arî ) and the heart’s knowledge of the realities (\u0002ilm al-\u0003aqâ\biq al-qalbî ). The ownership of all these three parts of knowledge constitutes full knowledge, the full “property” of man.285 Thus, as these examples show, if everything is properly understood and interpreted according to its real, inner mean-ing, knowledge is of an even more frequent occurrence than it anyhow is in the Qur\u0002ân and the \u0003adîth. In the Shî\u0003ah view, it is the true essence of life, human and superhuman.4. Finally, it is signi\u0002cant for the Shî\u0003ah outlook on knowledge that it brought about a peculiar synthesis between its religious concerns and the by and large secular interest in the sciences. Again, this is a process which would seem largely con\u0002ned to Ismâ\u0003îlism. With its strong ties to Hellenistic philosophy dating back to its early begin-nings. Ismâ\u0003îlism appears to have been always eager to explain to its followers the supposed scienti\u0002c basis upon which its religious beliefs rested. The prime example is the Rasâ\bil Ikhwân a\u0015-\u0015afâ\b and the recep-tion the Rasâ\bil received in Ismâ\u0003îlî circles. A peculiar religious epistemology of considerable originality was developed in Fâ\u0006imid-Ismâ\u0003îlî circles, of which the exposition by \u0004amîd-ad-dîn al-Kirmânî, in his Râ\u0003at al-\u0002aql, furnishes us with an interesting example dating from the early eleventh century. To what extremes this trend could lead is well illustrated by the efforts made among the Druzes to tie the system developed for the classi\u0002cation of the sciences to their particu-lar theology. Our evidence is a brief treatise included in the standard 283 Cf. al-Maynaqî, Î\u000eâ\u0003, 5, also, 74, for mâ\b = \u0002ilm.284 Cf. an-Nu\u0003mân, Asâs at-ta\bwil, 103.

Mu\bammad b. \u0004âmid at-Tamîmî is correct, it dates from the \u0002rst half of the \u0002fth/ eleventh century.286 At-Tamîmî claims to have drawn all his knowledge from the founder of the Druze religion, \u0004amzah b. \u0003Alî, who ordered him to compose the treatise and inspired him to accomplish a task, for which his own weak powers he felt would not have suf\u0002ced.According to the Druze writer, the sacred number of \u0002ve serves as the basic principle for the organization of all \u0002ilm. It is divided into \u0002ve sub-divisions. Two of them are concerned with religious matters (dîn), and two with physical data (\u000fabî\u0002ah). One, the \u0002fth and most important of all, is the true (\u0003aqîqî ) knowledge. This true knowledge is the knowledge that is wanted (murâd ) and that is in keeping with the command of Our Lord al-\u0004âkim. While the \u0002rst four subdivisions are again subdivided into numerous specialties, which are too numerous to mention and there is no point in mentioning them, the \u0002fth knowledge is a unique thing, unalterable, undiminishable, indivisible, and imperishable. The \u0002rst four subdivisions are called “knowledge” only metaphorically. Reality (\u0003aqîqah) of knowledge applies to the \u0002fth subdivision. The two subdivi-sions concerned with religious matters are the exoteric (outward, \u0012âhir) knowledge and the esoteric (inner, bâ\u000fin) knowledge. The representatives of the exoteric knowledge are the \u0002ve “speakers” (nâ\u000fiq), that is, Nûh, Ibrâhîm, Mûsâ, \u0003Îsâ, and Mu\bammad (Adam is not included), each of whom brought forth a “foundation.” The resulting \u0002ve “foundations” are Sâm, Ismâ\u0003îl, Yûsha\u0003 b. Nûn (after the death of Hârûn), Sham\u0003ûn the Rock (St. Peter), and \u0003Alî. Each “speaker” and the “foundation” brought forth by him form a pair, the earlier pair in each case point-ing to the one succeeding it. The esoteric knowledge includes the divine mercy (ra\u0003mah), whereas the exoteric knowledge includes the divine punishment, in keeping with Qur\u0002ân 57:13/13. The “speaker” is the master of the exoteric aspect, while the “foundation” is the 286 Cf. Silvestre de Sacy, Exposé, I, p. CCCCLXXIX.

Neither by himself is what is wanted. Together they do indicate what is wanted, namely, the \u0002fth knowledge, which also forms a third subdivision of the two subdivisions dealing with religious matters, and this is the esoteric (al-bâ\u000fin).287A long excursus follows here. It is triggered by a question raised by the author, to wit, why “being an idea” (ma\u0002nawîyah) is claimed only for \u0003Alî, and not for any of the other “foundations.” There were \u0002ve ages (peoples) before Adam, a\u0006-\u0005imm, ar-Rimm, al-\u0004inn, al-Jinn, and al-Binn. Adam and his children by Eve were the true believers in the oneness of God. Adam did not stray from the knowledge (ma\u0002rifah) of the Lord, but he was unable to accomplish the establishment of an exoteric religious law (sharî\u0002ah \u0012âhirah). Subsequently, there was much trouble on earth caused by Iblîs and his hosts, until the \u0002rst “speaker” made his appearance and established a religious law. He was Nû\b, and he was called the Second Adam.288 The following pairs of “speakers” and “foundations” all possessed worldly, that is, secular, knowledge and knew, for instance, medicine, philosophy, astronomy (and astrology) as well as speculative theology (kalâm), but they all believed in the recog-nition of the oneness of non-being (taw\u0003îd al-\u0002adam) and did not know (\u0002-r-f ) the Lord. Their strength (understanding, intelligence) was com-parable to the various stages of the embryo, reaching the stage of bone with \u0003Îsâ-Sham\u0003ûn, and with Mu\bammad-\u0003Alî and successive \u0003Alid imâms the stage of bone covered with \u0003esh in the erect form of man, but without spirit (rû\u0003). The spirit is the gnosis of the divine oneness (ma\u0002rifat at-taw\u0003îd ). Not having the spirit, even the last of the \u0002ve pairs of “speaker” and “foundation” cannot be said to have known (\u0002-r-f ) the Lord. All the while, the Universal Intellect and His “proof ” (\u0003ujjah) gave them strength. At the end of the time of the sixth “speaker” and the rising of the seventh “speaker,” the form of the recognition of the divine oneness (taw\u0003îd ) reaches perfection. “Uniqueness” (wa\u0003dânîyah)287 The author evidently found it dif\u0002cult to make the concept of bâ\u000fin do for two kinds of knowledge.

It was an angel or an appearance of the Lord, created to look like \u0003Alî, because the angels felt a deep longing for \u0003Alî.After a description of the way in which the seven heavens are assigned to various saints from Fâ\u0006imid pre-history, the author returns to his sub-ject, the classi\u0002cation of the sciences. He recapitulates what he had said before about the metaphorical usage of the word “knowledge” for the religious knowledge of \u0012âhir and bâ\u000fin and about the wanted knowledge being a combination of the two, the recognition of the divine oneness of the Lord (taw\u0003îd al-Mawlâ), which was not attained by any “speaker” and “foundation.” In our time, he says, “speaker” and “foundation” are two servants serving Our Lord al-\u0004âkim, known to those who know them, and unknown to those who need no knowledge (\u0002ulûm).The two subdivisions that are concerned with matters physical are physical medicine (\u0002ilm \u000fibb a\u000f-\u000fabî\u0002ah), which is not explained any fur-ther in detail, and the medicine of rational and irrational living beings (\u0002ilm \u000fibb al-\u0003ayawân), that is, human beings and dumb animals. The one is practiced by physicians (muta\u000fabbib), and the other by veterinarians (bay\u000fâr). Both are experimenters (empiricists, mutajarrib)289 rather than healers (mu\u0002âlij ), because they treat (\u0002âlaja) what they have no knowledge of (\u0002-r-f ). They have obtained their knowledge (\u0002ulûm) through blindly following (taqlîd ) the ancient philosophers, in the same manner in which those concerned with exoteric religious knowledge have obtained all their knowledge from the “speakers.” The most physicians are able to accomplish is splitting the belly of man and observing what is inside it, which is not to be compared with the activity of live persons.290 Therefore, their judgment concerning living, rational human beings cannot be correct. Many physicians have killed people through their289 On the many meanings of tajribah in medicine, cf. F. Rosenthal, in Bulletin of the History of Medicine, XL (1966), 233, n. 30.

It is the third part of the latter two, or the subdivision of all knowledge, that is the only true knowledge. It is the recognition of the oneness of Our Lord. The fact that it must be the \u0002fth subdivision which constitutes the greatest knowledge of all is con\u0002rmed by the superiority that attaches to everything that comes \u0002fth, witness the four natures where the \u0002fth nature is the greatest, the four “proofs” with the imâm himself as the \u0002fth, and the combination of units up to four, which requires another odd ( fard ) number to constitute \u0002ve, the taw\u0003îd, with the \u0002rst four odd numbers constituting the two even pairs of \u0012âhir and bâ\u000fin and with the \u0002fth subdivision outside of them, the knowledge of the recognition of the oneness of the Lord.In this Druze treatise, “knowledge” is equated with the highest faith. The destiny of mankind is represented as a struggle for knowledge by means of the various scholarly disciplines. The treatise is a fanciful mix-ture of theosophy and scienti\u0002c Wissenschaftslehre. Needless to say, from the point of view of science and meaningful knowledge, it is a step backward toward frightening primitivism. While pretending to be “eso-teric”, it re\u0003ects in reality an attempt to popularize religious doctrine. But it exempli\u0002es very well the forceful penetration of the concept of “knowledge” into every recess of Muslim thought and emotion.rosenthal_f7_70-154.indd 15410/17/2006 5:48:30 PM"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXKNOWLEDGE IS LIGHT (û\u0002sm)“Light” has always been a favorite concept of spiritual terminology.1 In particular, it has served as a metaphor for knowledge as distinct from the darkness of ignorance. When it is dark, we cannot observe or recognize anything. We are kept in ignorance. But when there is light and day, we can \u0002nd our way around—we know. This simple experience of man was transferred to matters of the mind and spirit at an early date of the most remote history of mankind. For better or worse (for there is always some potential danger in even the most natural and innocent verbalization of the human imagination), the memory of it has stayed alive in man’s consciousness to the present day.Light was a common symbol in Biblical thought, and throughout later Judaism and Christianity. Light shows the way and provides guidance, as do wisdom and the religious law. “The light of knowledge” ( phôs gnôseôs) is the mistaken Greek translation, based upon a reading nêr da\u0002a\u000b, of an Old Testament passage, Hosea 10:12.2 The Hellenistic spirit, in its search for lucidity of expression, made much use of the imagery of light. From Heraclitus’ idea of the inescapability of the intellectual light3—though the Heraclitean context of these words, reported on his authority many centuries after his time, is doubtful—to the more complicated metaphor embodied in Plato’s myth of the cave, from the Aristotelian quotation of a statement by an unknown author describing the 1 See, for instance, F.-N. Klein, Die Lichtterminologie bei Philon von Alexandrien und in den hermetischen Schriften (Leiden 1962), or the discussion on light and darkness in ancient Egypt (E. Hornung), archaic Greek poetry (M. Treu), early Greek philosophy (C. J. Classen), and ancient Iran and ancient Judaism (C. Colpe), in Studium Generale, XVIII (1965), 73–133.2 Cf. S. Aalen, Die Begriffe “Licht” und “Finsternis” im Alten Testament, im Spätjudentum und im Rabbinismus, 69, 93, 188 (Oslo 1951, Skrijter utgitt av Det Norske Videnskaps-Akademi, Hist.-\u0002los. Kl., 1951, no. 1).3 Cf. H. Diels, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, 3rd ed. (Berlin 1912), Heraclitus B 16.

Dualistic religions centered around the opposition of darkness and light, contrasting man’s low, material world of darkness with the glorious world of light on high. “Light,” for them, was the element of salvation. The gnostic concept of the “Pistis Sophia,” to give one speci\u0002c example, was identi\u0002ed with light, its primal abode. In one sweeping statement that seems to encompass much of later Muslim mystical thought, we \u0002nd Pistis (“faith”) emanating a picture called Sophia (“wisdom,” it would perhaps not be inappropriate in this context to think of “knowledge”) which develops “work” that is similar to or identical with the \u0002rst existing light.5Speaking about “light” was thus entirely natural for the Prophet Mu\bammad at the beginning of Islam. Later Islam always faced, and at times succumbed to, the temptation of employing an extensive light symbolism, even in perfectly orthodox circles. The primeval “pen,” for instance, is light, and the writing on the well-guarded tablet is a light of God,6 as the Qur\u0002ân itself was frequently referred to as a light, on good scriptural authority. The light of 4 Cf. Aristotle, Rhet. 1411b12. Cf. also A. Altmann, in H. A. Wolfson Jubilee Volume, I, 60 f. (Jerusalem 1965).It may be brie\u0003y added here that in Islam, the intellect (\u0002aql) is also frequently brought into connection with light. Al-Mu\bâsibî, to give an example from mysticism, is said to have de\u0002ned it as a light. It is a light that in human beings is subject to variation in intensity. Cf. also below, p. 172, n. 1. In reporting this view in his Dhamm al-hawâ, 5 (Cairo 1381/1962) (cf. also p. 273, n. 3), Ibn al-Jawzî expresses his own preference for a de\u0002nition of \u0002aql which within a small compass reveals the truly marvelous capacity for syncretism characteristic of Muslim civilization: “The intellect is a natural ability (gharîzah) comparable to a light thrown into the heart (cf. above, p. 71). It (the heart as the repository of the intellect, or the intellect by virtue of its being a luminous human endowment) is thus prepared for the perception of things. It thereby knows that the things permitted are permitted and that the things forbidden are forbidden, and it looks at the consequences of affairs.” Light mysticism, philosophical epistemology, theological “knowledge,” and practical ethics—a hint of each one of these has been brought here together skillfully to make the intellect a fully naturalized citizen of Islam.5 Cf.

Knowledge, guidance, and a book giving light are the things that together provide for true religious insight (31:20/19). And a light accompanies the faithful, representing their perfect faith (66:8/8). Faith thus is a light in the heart, and a later mystic writer could very well describe the gnosis of God as a \u0002re, and faith as a light.8 In a famous verse of the Qur\u0002ân (24:35/35), it is said that “God guides to His/his light (nûrihî ) whomever He wishes.” The explanation of the pronominal suf\u0002x in nûrihî, as referring either to God or to the believer, has caused much ink to \u0003ow on the part of Qur\u0002ân commentators, and it also called forth explanatory glosses supposedly belonging to the Qur\u0002ânic text itself.9 There were authoritative commentators who paraphrased the crucial word to mean, “. . . the light of the believer in whose heart are faith and the Qur\u0002ân.”10Moreover, the same verse speaks expressly of God as the light of the heavens and the earth. The alleged heretical imitation of the Qur\u0002ân by Ibn al-Muqaffa\u0003 in the eighth century is supposed to have begun with the words, “In the name of the Light, the Merciful, the Compassionate,” and to have continued with remarks in praise of light, presumably, under Manichaean, or, perhaps, also Zoroastrian, in\u0003uence.11 Shi\u0003ah extremism as represented, we are told, by Hishâmi b. al-\u0004akam and Hishâm b. Sâlim al-Jawâlîqî would quite literally describe God as “a bright light of sparkling whiteness.”12 God’s knowledge of what is underneath the earth is produced, it is said, by a continuous ray of light penetrating into the depth of the earth. Without such contact by means of radiation, God would not know what was there.13 According to al-Mala\u0006î’s report, the Qarmatians held the belief that “God was a Light 7 Cf.

From the Light Diffused, there was born a Light Darkly (\u0012alâmî ), which is the light one sees in the sun, the moon, the stars, the \u0002re, and the substances intermingled with darkness.”14 For the early Shî\u0003ah sect of the Jârûdîyah, God was a light, and the spirits of the imâms and the prophets were born from it.15 The divine light, manifesting itself in successive incarnations or emanations, “the light of the imâmate,”16 is central to Shî\u0003ah doctrine. According to Druze theology, the light of the Creator, the Light Diffused, brings forth the Universal Intellect, which is foremost in knowledge and in the recognition (ma\u0002rifah) of our Lord. “Light” was a sort of leitmotif in the description of the entire cosmological system.17 “The light of the heavens and the earth” of the Qur\u0002ânic verse was understood by some Ismâ\u0003îlîs to be the Universal Intellect.18Needless to say, all this was quite unacceptable to the Muslim majority. Since light is nothing but the mode of seeing, it is inapplicable to God.19 With regard to the interpretation of the “light verse” of the Qur\u0002ân, there was general agreement that “light” there had to be interpreted metaphorically according to one of a number of possibilities. Thus, it meant guide, administrator, giver 14 Cf. al-Mala\u0006î, Tanbîh, 15.

Rû\u0003 “spirit” was described by ûfîs also as a light derived from the divine light and even taken to be the essential light of divinity, cf. as-Sarrâj, Luma\u0002, 554. The Qur\u0002ânic rû\u0003 was, however, also explained as \u0002ilm “knowledge,” cf. al-Ghazzâlî, Mîzân al-\u0002amal, 333; Ibn \u0003Arabî, Futû\u0003ât, III, 356, chapter 368.16 Thus, for instance, \u0003Alî b.

Al-\u0004allâj further declared that “in the head, there is the light of revelation; in the forehead (between the eyes), the light of discourse with the divine (munâjâh); in the ear, the light of certainty ( yaqîn); in the tongue, the light of clarity; in the breast, the light of faith, etc.,” all of them lights which may, or may not, in\u0003uence each other.22 It is, however, somewhat strange to \u0002nd al-Ghazzâlî strongly in favor of a literal understanding in the famous treatise entitled Mishkât al-anwâr which is devoted to commenting on the Qur\u0002ânic verse. God alone is “light” in reality. There is no other true light. All other uses of the term “light” must be understood as metaphors. For the de\u0002cient sight of the human eye, the sun and the other heavenly bodies constitute the light of external vision, while the Qur\u0002ân and other divine books serve as instruments for internal vision and thus come closest to the proper meaning of light.

According to the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn, Irshâd, 155, 158, nûr is to be understood as “guide.” Az-Zamakhsharî, Kashshâf, II, 312, considers nûr to mean “the owner of light,” and he interprets the light of the heavens and the earth as a metaphor for “the truth.” Even the Shî\u0003ah commentator of the Qur\u0002an, a\u0006-\u0005abarsî, Majma\u0002 al-bayân, VII, 142, admits only of the metaphorical interpretation of “light” as either hâdî “guide,” or munawwir “enlightener,” or muzayyin “adorner.” \u0012iyâ\u0002-ad-dîn Ismâ\u0003îl b. Hibatallâh (cf. Strothmann, Ismailitischer Kommentar, 268 f.) likewise explains “light” metaphorically as the rû\u0003 of the mustaqarrs and mustawda\u0002s, which may, however, be not much more than a tautology, since rû\u0003 and nûr were occasionally considered to be identical.21 Cf. as-Sarrâj, Luma\u0002, 548.22 From as-Sulamî, \taqâ\biq at-tafsîr, to Qur\u0002ân 24:35/35, cf.

He went into great detail not only in his refutation of the literal interpretation which the anthropomorphists (mujassimah) gave to the word “light,” but he also demolished the attempts to equate “light” with the Deity according to the Manichaean doctrine that considered God as the “greatest light.”24 Probably, Fakhr-ad-dîn was less concerned with the Manichaeans than with the great authority of a Ghazzâlî and, perhaps, with the religious views of various Shî\u0003ah groups. It must also not be forgotten that it was a contemporary of Fakhr-ad-dîn, who was but a few years younger, as-Suhrawardî al-maqtûl, who built up the concept of “light” into the guiding principle of the universe, for whom everything alive was pure light,25 for whom God was “the Light of lights” and, following Plotinus, the pure light in the world of the intellect, the ultimate perfection,26 and who constructed a coherent cosmology on the basis of the light manifestations of the \u0002rst creative light (an-nûr al-ibdâ\u0002î al-awwal).27 As-Suhrawardî himself found it opportune to distinguish between an alleged light-and-darkness doctrine of the ancient Persians, on which he pretended to have modeled his own, and the unbelief of the “Magians” and the Manichaean heresy.2823 Cf. al-Ghazzâlî, Mishkât al-anwâr, trans.

The opposite, which is ignorance, is darkness. Just as the absence of light is darkness, so is the absence of knowledge a darkness of reason.”30 The Damascene’s words were soon echoed by Job of Edessa in his Syriac encyclopaedia: “If a wise man is likened to light, and an ignorant man to darkness, . . . it follows that knowledge of the created beings is light, and ignorance (of them) is darkness.”31û\u0002sm made use of the material provided by religious scholars that described knowledge as light.32 Going far beyond it, ûfî thinking was pervaded by the symbolism of light in its manifold manifestations.

In mystic ecstasy, an Abû Yazîd al-Bis\u0006âmî might address God as his knowledge in his ignorance and claim to be God’s light on earth.35 He might go even farther and declare the light of God to be good only for knowing (\u0002-r-f ) what is beneath God, whereas he on his part knew (\u0002-r-f ) God Himself through God.36 As-Sarrâj polemicized against this attitude, not because he considered the concept of the light of mysticism as erroneous, but because he felt that there was a tendency to consider this light as divine and uncreated. “Some ûfîs think that they see lights, and they describe their hearts as containing light, in the assumption that it is one of the lights which God has mentioned Himself among His attributes. Moreover, they describe this light as comparable to the light of the sun and the moon, and they believe that it belongs to the lights of gnosis (ma\u0002rifah), the recognition of oneness (taw\u0003îd), and majesty, believing further that these lights are uncreated.” For as-Sarrâj, the true meaning of “lights of the hearts” was the cognition (ma\u0002rifah) of the furqân and clear insight (bayân) from God, as the word furqân in Qur\u0002ân 8:29/29 was explained by the commentators as “a light placed in the heart, so as to decide between truth and untruth.”37 Already al-Mu\bâsibî had proclaimed that “the light of knowledge” could enlighten only the pious (ahl at-tuqâ), just as the light of day was useful only for those able to see, and not for the blind.38 And behavior unbecoming for a ûfî like spending his time in the bazaar could be castigated as “gouging the eye of excellence and obliterating the light of knowledge.”39Whatever its speci\u0002c interpretation in a given case, “light” remained a current, constantly used, and somewhat trite term in 156; as-Sulamî, \u0010abaqât, 156, l. 9; al-Qushayrî, Risâlah, 105, l. 30, 106, l. 14, 110, l. 6; M.

To quote once more remarks ascribed to Abû Yazîd al-Bis\u0006âmî, it is the light of the divine essence (nûr adh-dhât) that is needed to bring forth the knowledge of eternity (\u0002ilm al-azal ). And it is said that each one of the numerous “stations” on the mystic path has a light of its own, and the mystic’s banner (liwâ\b) itself consists of light.40 ûf îs were only too willing to describe every desirable phenomenon as “light.” We thus \u0002nd references to the light of obedience to God (\u000fâ\u0002ah), the light of wisdom, which is a commonly employed phrase, the light of understanding ( fahm), of taw\u0003îd, of the realities of faith, of sincere devotion (ikhlâ\u0015) and truthfulness (\u0015idq), of God’s holiness and mercy, and so on.41 For al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî, every word directed toward the Deity has a light. The lights of intellect, nearness to God, majesty or God’s face are, understandably, different in intensity. There is a light of taw\u0003îd, a light of îmân, and so forth.42 By “the light” of insight, knowledge is meant.43 “The lights of knowledge shine for the gnostic (\u0002ârif ), so that he is enabled to see the miracles of the supernatural.”44 Playfully, an unnamed scholar used to tell the inner circle of his followers when he was alone with them and wanted to discuss “the science of the duties of the heart,” to bring in “the inner light” (an-nûr al-bâ\u000fin).45 Later, in the knowledge-centered mysticism of the school of Ibn \u0003Arabî, it was only natural to speak, as did adr-ad-dîn al-Qônawî, of knowledge (that is, the true knowledge of the mystic and of God) as “light,” as “the essence (\u0002ayn) of light,” as “pure light,” as “the light of divine being,” as “the uncovering light.” Outward knowledge constituted “the form of light,” while inner knowledge constituted “the idea of light.”46The “light” (or “lights”) of knowledge was, however, a phrase employed in û\u0002sm to a lesser degree than “the light of certainty” (“certain knowledge,” yaqîn). It is certainty that is described as 40 Cf. as-Sahlajî, Nûr, 81, 63, 111.41 Cf. as-Sulamî, \u0010abaqât, 81, ll. 4 f., 149, l. 4, 311, ll. 4 f., 324, l. 2, 415, l. 6, 344, ll. 2 f., but all these were widely used expressions.42 Cf. al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî, \u001balâh, 13, 44, 65, 67, and his Khatm al-awliyâ\b, 121, n. 18.43 Cf. al-Mu\bâsibî, Ri\u0002âyah, 38, l. 11.

Dhû n-Nûn al-Mi\trî is said to have remarked that “the gnostic must not let the light of his gnosis extinguish the light of his asceticism, nor must he believe in any esoteric knowledge that destroys the exoteric law.”48 In this case, the parallelism employed equates the light of gnosis with esoteric knowledge, even if the latter is not spoken of expressly as a light. This, however, was done by al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî in his treatise on the meaning of knowledge (Kitâb Bayân al-\u0002ilm), in which he polemicized against those who accused the ûfîs of working toward the abolition of “knowledge” in the sense of legal, traditionist knowledge. Certain people discuss religious matters only in order to gain prestige among their associates. They are certain to lose the spiritual bene\u0002ts that must otherwise come to them as the result of their quest. The ûfîs are opposed to those people. Everything the ûfîs undertake to learn is approached in the understanding that it will provide them with insight and certainty. “For knowledge is a light. The more a person acquires of the fear of God, the greater is the amount of light he obtains. The more the heart is cleansed of any harmful matter, the more luminous (anwar) and the more abundant is the knowledge going to be.”49 Light, knowledge, purity of heart, and the fear of God are all mixed together here, without any tangible rational distinction. It is certainly true that from its early beginnings through its entire existence, ûfî speculation has always thrived on the arbitrary mingling or contracting of meaningful concepts. Light and knowledge, in particular, belonged together as a kind of conceptual foundation for mysticism, with the one being expressive of its essential emotional, inspirational, “illuminative” aspect, and the other, of its systematic, theoretical-scienti\u0002c side that became an inseparable part of mysticism in Islam.As we have just seen, with respect to its view of “knowledge,” early û\u0002sm was bothered by the speci\u0002c connotation which \u0002ilm had acquired, referring to religious knowledge in the legal-traditionalist 47 Cf.

In the totality of the history of mysticism in Islam, the ûfîs who deprecated traditionist \u0002ilm and who were ready to do away with it constituted a small minority, which, by this very fact, found considerable and well deserved attention for expressing unusual and non-conformist minority opinions. However, û\u0002sm attempted to add something of its own, some new twist as it were, to the generally accepted concept of \u0002ilm. It was therefore unable and unwilling to identify itself with it without reservation. It is not by chance that ûfî authors stressed the traditions in which knowledge was de\u0002ned in terms of light, or piety, or god-fearing activity, preceded by the statement that knowledge did not consist merely of a large amount of transmitted traditional material.50 Yet, the very rivalry that existed between mysticism and traditionist \u0002ilm caused the theoreticians of û\u0002sm to insist on labeling their own endeavors as \u0002ilm. With the growing prestige that rapidly accrued to the concept of knowledge in Islam, the ûfîs showed themselves all the more anxious to make room for \u0002ilm in their own thinking. It is true, however, that the preemption by others of \u0002ilm as a technical term prevented the ûfîs permanently from selecting \u0002ilm for employment as one of the numerous technical terms of their own mystic vocabulary and from using it to designate by it one of their speci\u0002c states or stations. Since ma\u0002rifah and yaqîn lent themselves without much dif\u0002culty to doubling for \u0002ilm, they were indeed widely substituted for it.Ma\u0002rifah, as a technical term referring to knowledge about God, was in all likelihood shared originally by ûfîs with other early Muslim religious thinkers who found the essential basis of faith in the knowledge about God in the \u0002rst place and, thereafter, in 50 Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, Qût, I, 197 (above, p. 161, n. 4), quotes two such remarks, one of them equating knowledge with the fear of God (khashyah), and the other equating it with light. For the equation with khashyah, see above, p. 140, n. 1, and below, p. 174; cf. also Ibn Rajab, Fa\u000el \u0002ilm as-salaf, 36 ff.

Al-Kha\u0006îb al-Baghdâdî, Kitâb Iqti\u000eâ\bal-\u0002ilm al-\u0002amal, in al-Albânî, Min kunûz as-sunnah, 169, quotes this statement from al-Qushayrî as indicative of the need for action.51 Cf. above, pp. 99 ff.ROSENTHAL-f8_155-193.indd 16510/17/2006 2:12:33 PM"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"166 knowledge is lightthe knowledge about a varying number of religious beliefs.51 As-Sarrâj thus states that the basic principles of religion include, in this order, the recognition of God’s oneness, knowledge (ma\u0002rifah), faith, certainty ( yaqîn), and so on. Ma\u0002rifah is used here in a way which would not have raised an orthodox, non-mystic eyebrow.52 A better argument in favor of the assumption that the ma\u0002rifah of the early theologians and the original understanding of the term by the ûfîs were not far apart is obviously the time element. Both theology and mysticism came into being at the same time and, presumably, among the same kind of men, since, as far as we know, the dividing line between theologians and mystics was all but non-existent in the early Muslim community. It has already been shown that there was no real difference between ma\u0002rifah and \u0002ilm at the earliest stages of Muslim metaphysical thought,53 and the same would seem to be valid for mysticism. Much later, such an in\u0003uential \u0002gure in the history of ûfî theory as al-Qushayrî returned to the beginnings by stating plainly that in scholarly usage, every \u0002ilm was a ma\u0002rifah, and every ma\u0002rifah an \u0002ilm, that every knower of God was a gnostic (\u0002ârif ), and every gnostic, a knower or scholar (\u0002âlim), and that the special use of ma\u0002rifah as referring to certain metaphysical and ethical insights and practices was due to ûfî theorizing.54 Still later, the school of Ibn \u0003Arabî produced mystic thinkers such as adr-ad-dîn al-Qônawî who, in a work of his entitled an-Nafa\u0003ât al-ilâhîyah, put the problems of \u0002ilm squarely in the center of things. In his work, ma\u0002rifah is almost entirely replaced by \u0002ilm and plays only a very minor role. For al-Qônawî, it is \u0002ilm, and not ma\u0002rifah, that is the true goal of the mystic. It is not generally agreed upon by mystics what true knowledge is, but in his ecstasy, al-Qônawî sees himself as “the mirror of the true essence of knowledge”: “I saw my guesswork to be knowledge; my knowledge, existence; my existence, non-existence; and my non-existence, I saw to be in control of all existence.”55In keeping with the general semantic development of the two roots, \u0002ilm remained the wider term also in û\u0002sm, covering in a 52 Cf. as-Sarrâj, Luma\u0002, 433.

Ma\u0002rifah was often no more than a particular state or station. However, at its best, it also was a term expressive of the distinctive essence of mysticism. It was therefore possible for mystics to place the higher value either upon \u0002ilm or upon ma\u0002rifah, depending upon the individual author’s particular outlook, even if, it would seem, ma\u0002rifah had a slight edge in many places. Abû Yazîd al-Bis\u0006âmî supposedly placed \u0002ilm above ma\u0002rifah,56 whereas al-\u0004allâj took the opposite stand,57 with such later authors as as-Suhrawardî al-maqtûl 58 and Ibn \u0003Arabî59 vacillating and occasionally coming out in favor of ma\u0002rifah but mostly, it seems, leaning toward \u0002ilm. Abû Sa\u0003îd al-Kharrâz, who was convinced that in the state of closeness to True Reality, the ûfî did not feel any physical or intellectual emotion, including that of knowledge, also claimed that the knowledge (\u0002ilm) of God was something wider and deeper than the gnosis (or knowledge about, ma\u0002rifah) of God, although both were in\u0002nite. The knowledge of God leads to the cognition of gnosis (ma\u0002rifat al-ma\u0002rifah) at the time of the passing of the (mere) knowledge of gnosis (\u0002ilm al-ma\u0002rifah) and interpretation and the passing of comment and being cut off from union.60 Poverty ( faqr)—by the time of Ibn Sab\u0003în (d. 669/1271), who relates these statements, a synonym of û\u0002sm—may be achieved by putting the religious law (shar\u0002\u0005) to the right, the intellect to the left, and knowledge (\u0002ilm) in the middle, but it may also be de\u0002ned as the \u0002rst perfection together with knowledge (\u0002ilm) and the second perfection together with gnosis (ma\u0002rifah), being, in fact, the sum of both, together with pure humanity.61 Both knowledge and gnosis are viewed here as indispensable for the mystic, although gnosis represents a posterior, higher stage. Thus, ma\u0002rifah and the \u0002ârif were the speci\u0002c goal of mystic endeavor and soared above the thoughts and opinions to which \u0002ilm and 57 Cf. L.

While knowledge is the \u0002rm belief that a thing is as it is, certainty is one’s satisfaction with and assuredness of what one knows. This, incidentally, means that in contrast to knowledge, yaqîn cannot be an attribute of God,71 a fact that perhaps contributed to the suitability of yaqîn, in preference to knowledge, as a term designating a mystic state. Certainty is the knowledge whose owner is not beset by any doubt (rayb) whatever.72 It is a knowledge which does not fall prey (?, taftarisuh) to doubts.73 According to Abû \u0003Abdallâh (Abû \u0003Alî) al-An\u0006âkî, “certainty is a light God places into the heart of man,” so that he may be able to learn about the other world.74 The least bit of certainty, upon entering the heart, \u0002lls it with light and drives out the slightest doubt (rayb).75 This admits of being reversed: “A little certainty removes all the doubt from the heart, and a little doubt removes all the certainty from the heart,”76 Knowledge apart from the quality of certainty is doubtful knowledge. Conjoined to certainty, it is knowledge without any doubt whatever.77 The distinction between plain knowledge on the one hand, and certainty as knowledge without doubt, on the other, is interpreted to be one between acquired knowledge and intuitive knowledge. Certainty is knowledge deposited in the hearts, meaning that it is a knowledge that is not acquired.78 Or it may said that knowledge exchanges 70 Cf., for instance, Lisân al-\u0002Arab, XVII, 349; al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî, al-\u0002Aql wa-l-hawâ, 122.

There may be knowledge where before, there was doubt, and there may be doubt where before, there was knowledge. But there is no doubt whatever in certainty. Consequently, knowledge is something acquired, and so is the knowledge of ûfîs at the beginning of their mystic journey, while certainty is intuitive and comes to the ûfîs at the end of their quest.79 Whether there could be different degrees of certainty as there were of knowledge, was a problem posed by Ibn \u0003Arabî on the basis of a tradition common among ûfîs which said that Jesus, if he were to gain an increase in certainty, could walk in the air, instead of merely upon water.80 Ibn \u0003Arabî also argued for the non-identity of \u0002ilm and yaqîn. He explains the three stages of yaqîn presupposed in the Qur\u0002ân (\u0002ilm/\u0002ayn/\u0003aqq al-yaqîn) by a variation of the well-known geographical example for degrees of knowledge: The three stages are the undoubted knowledge, based upon hearsay, of the existence of the Ka\u0003bah, the visit to the Ka\u0003bah combined with the actual observation of it, and learning about the Ka\u0003bah’s real meaning.81The relationship between yaqîn “certainty” and îmân “faith” seems to have appeared to ûfî theoreticians in a somewhat ambiguous light. While patience (\u0015abr) and gratefulness (shukr) constitute only one-half of faith, certainty is said to constitute the totality of faith.82 “The science (\u0002ilm) of certainty” is the end and entelechy of “the science of faith.”83 But faith is also considered as better than certainty.84 From a listing of the mystic’s “stations” in an ascending order, the impression might be gained that certainty is considered higher than the very \u0002rst station, which is ma\u0002rifah, and again lower than ta\u0015dîq (which is known to function as a synonym of faith), but then, it is stated that faith in reality com-79 Cf. al-Qushayrî, Risâlah, 83, ll. 16 f.80 Cf.

This is another indication that “certainty” serves as a replacement for plain “knowledge” in Muslim mysticism. The superiority of certainty over knowledge in the ûfî scheme of things found its clear expression in some such remarks as this one, credited to Abû Sa\u0003îd al-Kharrâz: “Knowledge is what starts you upon action, and certainty is what carries you along.”88 Or, as Abû Sa\u0003îd’s younger contemporary, al-Junayd, put it: “Certainty is the \u0002rm establishment in the heart of a knowledge which does not undergo revision or transformation or change,”89 while somewhat later, Abû Bakr al-Warrâq exclaimed that it was through certainty that God was known (\u0002-r-f ).90 A certain ûfî, about whose identity the sources do not agree,91 spent sixteen days sitting at the side of a pool in the country without eating or drinking. When asked what he was doing there, he replied: “I am between knowledge and certainty, waiting which of them will come out on top, so that I can be with it.” Al-Qushayrî’s explanation for the cryptic remark is that when knowledge wins out, he would drink, and if certainty wins out, he would go along (marartu), meaning, it seems, he would go on with his fast. Whether this explanation hits the mark or not, the ûfî no doubt hoped for the victory of certainty. Certainty would lift him above the uncertainties of mere knowledge, even though it was the knowledge needed by him on the mystic path.85 Cf. al-Qushayrî, Risâlah, 83, l. 18. Al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî, al-\u0002Aql wa-l hawâ, also places yaqîn a step above ma\u0002rifah.86 According to al-An\u0006âkî, cited by Massignon, Lexique technique, 227.87 Cf. the chapter headings in Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, Qût, l, 195, III, 56.88 Cf. al-Qushayrî, Risâlah, 84, ll. 26 f.89 Cf. al-Qushayrî, Risâlah, 83, l. 32.90 Cf. al-Qushayrî, Risâlah, 84, l. 14.91 Both as-Sarrâj, Luma\u0002 407, and following him, al-Qushayrî, Risâlah, 83, ll. 9 ff., report the story in the name of Abû Ja\u0003far al-\u0004addâd, who belonged to the circle of al-Junayd and Ruwaym and thus lived around 900. However, the name of the interrogator is later on given as Abû Turâb an-Nakhshabî, who had died already in 245/859.

The basic tenet of all Muslim ethics, the necessary combination of knowledge with action based on it,92 was adopted as a matter of course by most ûfîs and extolled in a great variety of statements and discussions. Keeping company with men of learning was accepted as a fundamental condition for sound mystic training, and its desirability was constantly stressed. Biographical notices of ûfîs usually describe their subjects as “scholars” (\u0002âlim). At times, the particular \u0002eld of learning in which a certain ûfî excelled is mentioned. This may be theology or other non-mystic subjects, or it may be the science of the realities (\u0002ilm al-\u0003aqâ\biq). In the latter case, the \u0002eld of the ûfî’s particular scholarly competence was understood to be mystic theory. A mystic described as \u0002âlim, with no further quali\u0002cation, might thereby be intended to qualify as an \u0002ârif, a gnostic. Usually, however, it would seem that \u0002âlim in these cases was employed in the common meaning of being a learned, knowledgeable man. Like other Muslim intellectuals, the ûfîs, too, complained about abuses committed by the learned, such as their drive for prestige and money on the strength of the scholarly recognition that was accorded to them,93 and they also succumbed to the illusion of assuming that those evil tendencies were the product of modern times and had been unknown in the good old days. Already Dhû 92 See below, pp. 246 ff. \u0002ilm could be superseded by \u0002aql in this respect by describing the essence of intelligence as “a light in the heart that guides the soul toward the principles of action,” cf. al-Kharrâz, Rasâ\bil, 47.93 The term used is al-mubâhâh bi-l-\u0002ilm. The censure of this kind of attitude is by no means restricted to û\u0002sm, cf., for instance, Concordance, IV, 328b54 f.; Ibn Qutaybah, \u0002Uyûn al-akhbâr, II, 119 (reprint Cairo 1963–64); Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 228; al-Kha\u0006îb al-Baghdâdî, Iqti\u000eâ\b, 193 ff. It was put into the mouth of Luqmân as the representative of pre-Islamic educational wisdom, cf. Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Jâmi\u0002, I, 107, and the anonymous version in al-Mubashshir, 333; also Abû Nu\u0003aym, \tilyah, VI, 62 f.

Today, a man’s knowledge instills in him an increased love for this world, and he becomes more ready to go after (material prosperity). There was a time when a man spent his property on the acquisition of knowledge. Today, he acquires property through his knowledge. There was a time when a man of knowledge (\u0015â\u0003ib al-\u0002ilm) could be observed to grow, both inwardly and outwardly. Today, many men of knowledge can be observed to grow in corruption in both respects.”94 This reproach is certainly directed not only to the traditionists but also to many of the ûfîs of Dhû n-Nûn’s time.The concept of knowledge constituted a kind of background music to all ûfî thinking. A dissonant note was introduced by occasional re\u0003ections on the inferiority of “knowledge” not only, as we have seen, to the concept of ma\u0002rifah but also, generally, to emotion and feeling. Abû Yazîd al-Bi\t\u0006âmî went through a long period of study under great scholars, in order to become both an \u0002âlim and an \u0002ârif (the \u0002ârif being here the higher stage). Then, he sought the company of devout men who punctiliously observed all the religious duties. But when God \u0002nally answered his question about true reality, the answer came not by means of the knowledge or the formal piety previously acquired but in a burst of emotion and inspiration.95 “The novice must subject himself to the regimen of knowledge (siyâsat al-\u0002ilm), but the observance of the truth is something higher.” These were the words by which al-Junayd proclaimed the primacy of feeling and intuition over learning.96 Or, as he expressed the same idea on another occasion: “The right and true novice does not need the knowledge of scholars.”97Knowledge was also subordinated at times to certain other qualities. In the view of Abû l-\u0004usayn an-Nûrî, û\u0002sm is not de\u0002nitions (rusûm) and kinds of knowledge (\u0002ulûm) but ethical qualities (akhlâq).98 Others said that “a little right behavior 94 Cf. as-Sulamî, \u0010abaqât, 25. 95 Cf. as-Sahlajî, Nûr, 126 f.96 Cf. al-Qushayrî, Risâlah, 94, ll. 11 f.

Adham was asked about knowledge, he came up with adab.”100 And knowledge may be said to be just one of four qualities needed by the mystic, in addition to right behavior (adab), integrity (amânah), and modesty (\u0002iffah).101 For the ûfîs who were concerned with action more than with contemplation, ethics and morality were as important as thought.However, it was knowledge that the angels themselves would feel called upon to discuss with the chosen mystic.102 It was knowledge that was as rare as it was valuable in the world: “All of the world is ignorance, except that which is knowledge.”103 It was knowledge that \u0002rst awakened the ûfî to his task of searching after God, even if it then left him confused and bewildered.104 Knowledge also lent itself to evaluative comparisons with various technical concepts of the mystic vocabulary. The “mystic state” (\u0003âl) “is inseparable from knowledge, as it is irreconcilable with talk,” according to Abû \u0004af\t an-Nîsâbûrî.105 “Fear” (khawf, makhâfah) is the product of knowledge, just as tranquillity is the result of asceticism, and repentance that of ma\u0002rifah, says al-Mu\bâsibî.106 In the view of \u0003Amr b. \u0003Uthmân al-Makkî (d. 291/903–4, or later in the same decade), knowledge and fear must combine as guide and driver in order to govern as well as frighten the unruly horse that is the human soul.107 According to Abû \u0003Abdallâh at-Turûghbadhî (\u0002rst half of the tenth century), depending on the prevailing circumstances, knowledge might produce fear (khawf ), apprehension 99 Cf. al-Qushayrî, Risâlah, 129, ll. 9 f., citing \u0003Abdallâh b. al-Mubârak (d. 181/797). Although Ibn al-Mubârak cannot be considered a ûfî, he was devoted to and interested in asceticism, on which he wrote several treatises. Cf. below, p. 316.100 Cf. Abû Nu\u0003aym, \tilyah, VIII, 27.101 Cf. as-Sulamî, \u0010abaqât, 51, citing as-Sarî as-Saqa\u0006î (d. 251/865–66, or 253).102 Abû Yazîd al-Bis\u0006âmi, in as-Sahlajî, Nûr, 112.103 This was the phrasing of the idea by Sahl at-Tustarî (ninth century), cf. as-Sarrâj, Luma\u0002, 188; H.

Shaybân al-Qarmîsînî, knowledge serves exoteric education (âdâb a\u0012-\u0012âhir), while wara\u0002 serves the higher goal of esoteric education.110 Like Sufyân, Ya\byâ b. Mu\u0003âdh (d. 258/871–72) considered asceticism as the source of the direct awareness, without symbolism, of the signi\u0002cance (de\u0002nition, \u0003add) of knowledge.111 In this respect, as Ibn Nu\tayr (d. 348/959) reminds us, it is not unlike piety (taqwâ). When piety takes up residence in the heart, it causes the blessings of knowledge to descend upon it.112The higher mysteries of the ûfî path also called for comparisons with knowledge. In the state of sobriety, which is the counterpart of the state of drunkenness, the mystic faces the presence of knowledge under his own control by his own activity.113 For some ûfîs, ecstatic experience (wajd ) may be something apart from knowledge. Yet, for others, it may come through knowledge, and again for others, it is knowledge.114 Even “true reality” (\u0003aqîqah), the \u0002nal goal of the mystic search for insight, may be equated with knowledge. Thus, Ruwaym (d. 303/915–16) called the most perfect of realities that which is connected with knowledge. Another mystic, Abû Ja\u0003far a\t-aydalânî, distinguished between three kinds of realities in the approved ûfî style: A true reality together with knowledge, a true reality accompanied by knowledge, and a true reality that turns away from knowledge. And still another ûfî, al-Abharî (d. ca. 330/941–42), contended that “all true reality is knowledge, and all knowledge is true reality.”115 However, for 108 Cf. as-Sulamî, \u0010abaqât, 496, ll. 8 ff.

It was the establishment of û\u0002sm in all its various manifestations as an \u0002ilm, and here the word is best translated as “science.” Indeed, û\u0002sm developed into a “science” all its own, so much so that al-Ghazzâlî was eventually able to maintain that the views of the various kinds of Muslim religious thinkers showed no real difference as far as practical methods and procedures (\u000farîq al-\u0002amal ) were concerned, but there was a real and important difference between the theoretical methods (\u000furuq al-\u0002ilm) of û\u0002sm as distinguished from those of the speculative theologians and the philosophers.118 In other words, û\u0002sm had become a “science” in its own right.Beginning with the early ninth century, if not earlier, ûfîs showed a desperate desire to establish what they were attempting to do as an \u0002ilm. They wanted to prove that they were in no essential way opposed to the \u0002ilm of the traditionists, but in order to justify their attempts at providing an alternative to traditionist and rationalist theology, they felt that they had to prove that this alternative was no less of an \u0002ilm than what was done by the other side. For this was the age of science, the age in which systematic knowledge in a wide variety of clearly de\u0002ned \u0002elds became the dominant form of expression for Muslim intellectual aspirations 116 Cf. as-Sahlajî, Nûr, 84.117 Cf. as-Sulamî, \u0010abaqât, 363, ll. 14 f.118 Cf. al-Ghazzâlî, Mîzân al-\u0002amal, 221.ROSENTHAL-f8_155-193.indd 17610/17/2006 2:12:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":" knowledge is light  177and everything, from the Qur\u0002ân to poetry, was provided with all the apparatus of specialized scholarly disciplines. The \u0002ilm of the ûfîs tried very strenuously to appear as a “science” as well as keep in step with the various scienti\u0002c views of the meaning of knowledge. Many terms in the mystic vocabulary came in the course of time to be described as \u0002ulûm “scienti\u0002c disciplines” in their own right. Helped by the atomistic element that was inherent in the original concept of \u0002ilm,119 the ûfîs found no dif\u0002culty in speaking of every mystic term as a particular “knowledge” to be acquired by the mystic, and in establishing a hierarchy of such “knowledge,” whose usual apex was the knowledge of the realities of the mystic gnosis—unless preference was accorded to the opposite insight that all such various kinds of knowledge, however titled, meant in fact only one and the same thing, only one “knowledge.”120 Already al-Mu\bâsibî (d. 243/857) gave literary expression to this concern with setting up û\u0002sm as a “science,” with establishing its legitimacy in the Muslim scheme of things, and with delimiting it from other sciences. He did so in his brief essay entitled Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm “Book on Knowledge.”121 In the Ri\u0002âyah, his main work, al-Mu\bâsibî showed himself more interested in the practice of the ethical virtues necessary for leading a life that would please God. 119 Cf. above, p. 12.120 Cf. as-Sarrâj, Luma\u0002, 457.121 Despite repeated efforts, I was unable to gain access to the manuscript of the work preserved in the Ambrosiana in Milan, Ms. Caprotti 204, fols. 18a–21a (= Catalogue Grif\u0002ni, 460, VI, in RSO, VIII [1919–20], 328 f.).

Smith, An Early Mystic, 53, the author analyses ma\u0002rifah in its various types, again applying what in his time was considered scienti\u0002c procedure. For another manuscript of the work, cf. F. Rosenthal, Die arabische Autobiographie, in Analecta Orientalia, XIV, 11 f., n. 3 (Rome 1937). An excerpt from the work is contained in the Istanbul manuscript Köprülü, I, 1601, fols. 97b–99b. The anecdote reported by M. Smith, An Early Mystic, 11 f., that al-Mu\bäsibî had once written a book on ma\u0002rifah but destroyed it when his unpreparedness for a true understanding of the subject was driven home to him under questioning by a young ûfî has, it seems, the purpose of exalting the dif\u0002culty of gnosis which even a Mu\bâsibî was unable to cope with. This imaginary work has certainly nothing to do with the preserved and, indeed, very imperfect treatise.ROSENTHAL-f8_155-193.indd 17710/17/2006 2:12:37 PM"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"178 knowledge is light\u0002Ilm is often paired with \u0002amal in the generally accepted manner. It is employed largely in the common meaning of religious knowledge based upon the Qur\u0002ân and the sunnah of the Prophet. It is the knowledge which permits the individual to recognize the religious duties and ethical practices considered by al-Mu\bâsibî as incumbent upon his kind of seeker after God. It is one of the things that must be kept pure and free from such dangers as overweening pride and self-delusion. In the Ri\u0002âyah, \u0002ilm also appears as a practical synonym of ma\u0002rifah and occurs many a time in combination with it, without exhibiting anything more than the usual distinction between the two terms. While ma\u0002rifah often expresses acquaintance, awareness, a \u0002rst realization of or know-ledge about something, \u0002ilm expresses the fullness of knowledge of any given subject. There is no special discussion of \u0002ilm in the Ri\u0002âyah, even though the word itself is constantly present and its importance makes itself felt.According to the discussion offered by al-Mu\bâsibî in the Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm, knowledge falls into three parts. There is a legal knowledge which deals with what is lawful and unlawful in this world and constitutes therefore a kind of “outward” (exoteric) material knowledge. Then, there is a knowledge of the other world, which is “inner” (esoteric) intuitional knowledge. And there is a knowledge of God and of the divine rules as they affect this world and the other world, that is, the true inner meaning of the cosmos, the real goal of the gnostic.122 The seekers after knowledge should, of course, not seek worldly knowledge123 and worldly gain but devote themselves to the denunciation of the world, to the knowledge that is light and intuition, that falls like the rain from heaven124 and induces man to exhibit a greater fear of God. What we have 122 Mu\bammad b. al-Fa\rl al-Balkhî (d. 319/931) expressed the idea of the three kinds of knowledge in the epigrammatic manner so beloved by ûfîs: “There are three kinds of knowledge, a knowledge of God (bi-llâh), a knowledge from God (min Allâh), and a knowledge with God (ma\u0002a Allâh). The \u0002rst knowledge is the knowledge about (ma\u0002rifah) God’s attributes. The second knowledge is the knowledge (\u0002ilm) of the exoteric and the esoteric, of what is allowed and what is forbidden, of what is commanded and what is prohibited by the law. And the third knowledge is the knowledge (\u0002ilm) of fear and hope, of love and desire.” Cf. as-Sulamî, \u0010abaqât, 215.123 For an eloquent passage on worldly knowledge, cf. the chapter dealing with al-Mu\bâsibî’s understanding of \u0002ilm in van Ess, Die Gedankenwelt des \târi\u000b al-Mu\u0003âsibî, 78–81.124 Cf.

By placing û\u0002sm as such, or, at least, as represented by its most obvious purpose, into one of them, al-Mu\bâsibî attempted successfully to press mysticism’s claim to being a scienti\u0002c discipline, just at the right moment and in the right intellectual climate.It is presently not clear whether or not others preceded al-Mu\bâsibî in using the same approach. Possibly, there were others. There can, however, be no doubt that his lead was followed. In the same spirit and, it seems, strongly in\u0003uenced by al-Mu\bâsibî, al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî made his plea for the acceptance of mysticism among the “sciences” near the end of the ninth century, according to the most likely date. His treatise was entitled Kitâb Bayân al-\u0002ilm “The Explanation of Knowledge.”125 As the author explains it, he had been accused by some people of wishing to abolish \u0002ilm. Those people had been under the misconception that \u0002ilm was identical with jurisprudence ( \u0002qh). In their opinion, jurisprudence was the only knowledge by which God is served and the religion of Islam maintained. Anything else was not knowledge but a waste of time and effort. This, al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî replies, just is not so. \u0002Ilm is rather a comprehensive term, for the Prophet has said: “Knowledge consists of three things, a clear verse (of the Qur\u0002ân), a well-established sunnah, and a fair religious duty ( farî\u000eah).”126 Also, Jesus has said: “There are three (kinds of ) knowers (\u0002âlim), a knower of God, a knower of the command of God, and a knower of the command of God who is at the same time a knower of God.”127 Consequently, there are three kinds of knowledge, namely, the knowledge of what is lawful and what is unlawful, which is the legal knowledge of the rules governing this world and which is exoteric material knowledge; the knowledge of the rules governing the other world, which is esoteric intuitive knowledge; and the knowledge of the divine rules as they affect God’s creation in both this world and the other world. Each of these three kinds of knowledge has its own subdivisions (according to 125 Cf. the Ankara Ms. Ismail Saib, I, 1571, fols. 12a–24a.

The \u0002rst knowledge, characterized by the expression “knowers of the command of God,” falls into the two subdivisions of 1. lawful knowledge and 2. unlawful knowledge. The second knowledge comprises all the good and bad ethical qualities, such as asceticism, piety, patience, fear, etc., with its most important basic ingredient being nîyah “intention.” Those who possess this knowledge are apparently meant by Jesus when he speaks of “knowers of God,” meaning the sages (\u0003ukamâ\b\u0005). (Here, we are already well within the science of mysticism.) The third knowledge is the knowledge of God and of the way in which He governs His creation. This inexhaustible subject, when properly approached, secures the greatest possible spiritual bene\u0002ts.128 All these kinds of knowledge—elsewhere, al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî labels them knowledge of what is allowed and what is forbidden, \u0003ikmah meaning “wisdom” or “philosophy,” and ma\u0002rifah meaning “gnosis”129—were known to the companions of the Prophet. They preserved them in their memory and did not write them down. Later scholars forgot them in spite of the existence of books in their time, because they were concerned only with their worldly advancement and therefore not receptive to the light of wisdom. The third kind of knowledge is indicated in Jesus’ phrase of “the knowers of God and the knowers of the command of God.” Of them, it can be said that “they are the ones who combine all these kinds of knowledge. They thus know the lawful and the unlawful . . . They study the supernatural (\u0002ilm [read: \u0002âlam? ] al-malakût), and they are aware in their hearts of the majesty of God. Therefore, they serve Him with the knowledge of certainty, as God has said: ‘Indeed, were you to know the knowledge of certainty, you would see Hell’—that is, with their heart—then you would see with the eye of certainty’—tomorrow, in the other world (Qur\u0002ân 102:5–7/5–7).130 The knowledge of certainty lets one see things by way of 128 Cf. above, p. 164.

Another tradition speaking of \u0002qh is discussed. In the view of the author, \u0002qh, too, must be understood as referring to a particular scienti\u0002c discipline, namely, the knowledge of God. In this connection, the reader \u0002nds himself referred to the Prophetical tradition that the beginning of knowledge (ra\bs al-\u0002ilm) is the knowledge of death and the knowledge of the Lord.131 The remainder of the treatise is mainly taken up with attacks against those who use \u0002ilm for worldly purposes.In this way, al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî, expanding upon al-Mu\bâsibî, succeeded in substantiating further the endeavors of mystics to claim possession of a scienti\u0002c discipline of their own. Moreover, he contended that the ûfîs were the only ones whose scholarly efforts gave knowledge its due as something requiring completely unsel\u0002sh devotion. û\u0002sm is not only a “science.” It is the only science deserving the name.132The desire to see û\u0002sm accepted as a “science” is still transparent in the opening pages of the Luma\u0002 of as-Sarrâj. As-Sarrâj speaks with notable emphasis of “the discipline of û\u0002sm” (\u0002ilm at-ta\u0015awwuf ). He describes û\u0002sm as “the mine of all sciences.”133 Finally, he claims for û\u0002sm to be “the science of the esoteric” (\u0002ilm al-bâ\u000fin). By the tenth century, all this was generally current terminology. \u0002Ilm served as the label for a û\u0002sm considered to be no more and no less than a system of knowing, a “science.”As-Sarrâj’s contemporary, Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî, devoted a quite lengthy 131 Al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî also remarks that “the beginning of divine worship is knowledge. If you know, you have gnosis (\u0002-r-f ), and if you have gnosis, you worship.” This is the incipit of one of his masâ\bil, preserved in a manuscript in Leipzig and cited in the edition of al-\u0004akîm at-Tirmidhî, Khatm al-awliyâ\b, 58. The author then goes on to explain that all knowledge rests in the letters (sounds) of the alphabet. Cf. Abû \u0004âtim ar-Râzî, Zînah, I, 66, II, 8.132 For various ûfî references to mysticism as “the knowledge,” cf. also below, p. 244.133 Cf. as-Sarrâj, Luma\u0002, 40.ROSENTHAL-f8_155-193.indd 18110/17/2006 2:12:38 PM"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"182 knowledge is lightchapter of his Qût to the discussion of knowledge.134 In it, he attempted to produce a synthesis between the “knowledge” of û\u0002sm and the legal-traditionalist knowledge of the religious scholars, a synthesis brought to a successful completion by al-Ghazzâlî who used a good deal of his predecessor’s material. Al-Ghazzâlî’s lasting in\u0003uence and popularity which were denied to Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî no doubt were the result of the state of evolution Islamic culture had reached by his time. The most decisive factor in his success was, however, his much clearer and more interesting presentation. This made his ideas more acceptable, just as the better, more systematic arrangement of al-Qushayrî’s Risâlah made it the authoritative handbook that as-Sarrâj’s Luma\u0002 could never be. The summary chapter heading in the Qût for its thirty-\u0002rst chapter “on knowledge” reveals much of its contents: “Knowledge and details (taf\u0015îl, rather than taf\u000eîl ‘preference’) about it.

What the Prophet had in mind when he used the word “knowledge” was “useful knowledge” (nâ\u0002\u0002 “useful” being much liked by ûfî authors as indicative of their endeavors), the “esoteric knowledge,” the “knowledge of the hearts,” in short, the science of û\u0002sm.Thereafter, and throughout his chapter on knowledge, Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî tries to give additional support to the widely held theory that in early Islam, all knowledge was otherworldly knowledge and that the attribution of any other meaning to “knowledge” took place only at a later stage. Thousands of the men around Mu\bammad were “knowers of God,” seekers after faith and certainty, while only a handful among them were interested in legal matters. When they spoke of knowledge, they, as well as the men of the next generation, understood it to mean “the knowledge of certainty and the fear of God” (\u0002ilm al-yaqîn wa-t-taqwâ) and “the knowledge of gnosis and right guidance” (\u0002ilm al- ma\u0002rifah wa-l-hudâ) and even their ordinary formulas of greeting had some pious signi\u0002cance.136 Their concept of knowledge was eloquently expressed, for instance, by Mu\u0003âdh b. Jabal (d. 18/639, one of the trusted lieutenants of the Prophet, and certainly no forerunner of û\u0002sm137): “Study knowledge, for studying knowledge is the fear of God. Searching for knowledge is the worship of Him. Learning knowledge is the glori\u0002cation of Him. Doing research in knowledge is a holy war in His behalf. Teaching knowledge to those who do not know is charity.138 And lavishing knowledge upon those who deserve it is nearness to God. Knowledge is a friend in loneliness. It is company for him who is all by himself. It is a guide under any circumstances whatever, an ornament among friends, a relative among strangers, and a lighthouse on the road to Paradise. Through knowledge, God lifts up people and makes them guides toward the good (life) who serve as examples to be followed and whose actions are studied and imitated and whose opinions are accepted.

Qût, II, 15 and 42.137 In the introductory remarks of his \u001bifat a\u0015-\u0015afwah, I, 4 (Hyderabad 1355–56), Ibn al-Jawzî rightly protested against the efforts to claim the early Muslims for û\u0002sm simply on the ground of their asceticism, as û\u0002sm implied much more than mere asceticism.138 Cf. Ibn \u0003Arabî, Futû\u0003ât, I, 558, l. 6.

Knowledge is the life of the heart after blindness (?), the light of the eyes after darkness, and the strength of the body after weakness. Through knowledge, man reaches the stations of the pious and the highest ranks. Re\u0003ecting upon knowledge and learning it are considered equivalent to the performance of fasting. It is an act of obedience to God, of worship of Him, and of declaring His oneness. It constitutes ascetic behavior. It accomplishes the strengthening of family ties. Knowledge is the leader, and action is its follower.139 It is an inspiration given to the blessed. It is something that is denied to the unfortunate.”140 Such general praise of knowledge is heard constantly throughout Muslim history, in almost the same words and phrases. Here, however, it is used as an argument, obviously \u0002ctitious and unhistorical, to prove the exclusive concern of the ancient Muslims with knowledge, in the ûfî sense. Abû \u0005âlib al-Makkî in addition makes clever use of association, in order to bring any mention of knowledge into connection with mystic knowledge. Thus, he cites some well-known verses, which he ascribes to one of the sages but which (as in al-Ghazzâlî’s I\u0003yâ\b\u0005) are often ascribed to \u0003Alî:I have noticed knowledge to be of two kinds,Acquired through study (masmû\u0002) and given by nature (ma\u000fbû\u0002\u0005).The kind acquired through study is of no use,If there is no knowledge given by nature,Like as the sun is of no useWhere the light of the eye is denied,and then interprets them as referring to the knowledge that is uppermost in his mind, by citing verses of the mystic, al-Junayd:The science of û\u0002sm is a knowledge which can be known onlyBy the possessor of natural intelligence in truth known (to possess it).He who does not witness it does not know it.How could the blind man witness the light of the sun!141139 Cf. below, p. 249. See further as-Sulamî, \u0010abaqât, 139, citing Abû \u0003Alî (Abû \u0003Abd allâh) al-An\u0006âkî, who replaces the second half by describing “foresight” (\u0002inâyah = pronoia) as the leader of every kind of knowledge.140 Cf.

He attacks the “evil scholars” who “devour this world with the help of their knowledge.” He uses the division of all sciences into objectionable and non-objectionable disciplines, in order to show that the non-objectionable disciplines were those cultivated by the early Muslims, who also had no need of writing down their knowledge and becoming authors of books,142 while the objectionable disciplines, such as grammar, prosody, mathematics, and even systematic jurisprudence, were later inventions not known to the ancients.143 In sum, his chapter on knowledge serves the purpose of making it clear once more that û\u0002sm is a scholarly discipline and, in fact, the one and only original scholarly discipline in Islam. Consequently, it is the only true scholarly discipline that deserves cultivation by Muslims, with all the powers of the mind and of the heart at their command. Mysticism is light, and mysticism is a science.A daring combination of scienti\u0002c Peripatetic philosophy with mystic speculations on knowledge and, indeed, an adaptation of philosophical thought to basic mystic premises144 was accomplished by as-Suhrawardî al-maqtûl. His efforts led to a startlingly different system of thought. For the “science” of û\u0002sm, they remained rather inconclusive and super\u0002cial, inasmuch as as-Suhrawardî had no patience with historical antecedents and made short shrift of the fundamental û\u0002sm of earlier times. The most complete and successful attempt to incorporate the Muslim conception of knowledge, such as it had been developed since the ninth century, into the fabric of mystic thought was undertaken, as so many other things, by the fertile genius of as-Suhrawardî’s contemporary, Ibn \u0003Arabî. While as-Suhrawardî came from the East of the Muslim world, Ibn \u0003Arabî came, from the West, but the lives of both men came to an end in Syria, if under very different circumstances and half a century apart. For Ibn \u0003Arabî, “gnostic-and-gnosis (\u0002-r-f ) characterizes the one to whom the Lord has permitted to witness himself while gnosis is his state with (all the mystic) states having control over him,” whereas “knower-and-knowledge (\u0002-l-m) characterizes the one to whom God has permitted to witness His divinity 142 Cf. Qût, II, 37 = al-Ghazzâlî, I\u0003yâ\b, I, 70, trans. Faris, 211.143 Cf.

Both rank high on the scale of mystic values in his philosophy, but he seems to show a predilection for the wider implications of “knowledge.”146 Every one of the divine manifestations in the world comes from the “treasure of knowledge.” “Knowledge is the Truth, and the Truth is knowledge,” and “(God’s) Book is His Knowledge.”147 The recognition of the divine oneness is a knowledge; then, it is state; and then again, it is a knowledge.148In all his works, Ibn \u0003Arabî often dealt with knowledge. He may even have written a monograph on the subject which remained unpublished.149 However, we can safely assume that all he had to say has been spread over the many passages concerned with \u0002ilm of his massive Futû\u0003ât, a work, its author claims in his autobibliography, such as had never been written before and would never be written again. Like all his books, it was not written like ordinary writings and composed in the manner in which ordinary authors compose their works. It had come down to him directly through divine inspiration. The Futû\u0003ât starts out with an epistemological discussion. Ibn \u0003Arabî explains the different kinds of knowledge that he assumes exist, such as the knowledge of the intellect (i.e., 145 Cf. Ibn \u0003Arabî, I\u0015\u000filâ\u0003 a\u0015-\u001bûfîyah, 15, and Futû\u0003ât, II, 129. In the Futû\u0003ât, “himself ” in the de\u0002nition of gnosis and gnostic is replaced by “no other divine name.” The word “himself ” (nafsah) does not refer to God but to the gnostic. This re\u0003ects the maxim on self-knowledge being the knowledge about the Lord (above, p. 137), and Massignon, Lexique technique, 127, for the spurious ûfî claim of having originated it.For a collection of de\u0002nitions considered acceptable by Ibn \u0003Arabî, cf. his Kitâb al-I\u0002lâm bi-ishârât ahl al-ilhâm, 5 (Hyderabad 1367, in Vol. I of Rasâ\bil Ibn \u0002Arabî).

They arranged all knowledge according to the elementary features of which existence is composed, according to concepts claimed to go back to Greek philosophy.151 Ibn \u0003Arabî speaks of the relationship between knowledge and the object known152 and of the various kinds of objects known,153 of the various ways of attaining knowledge,154 of the distinction between acquired and “given” knowledge,155 and of the oneness of all knowledge,156 taking for all of it his cue from the discussion of the speculative theologians. He also mentions the idea of an assured transmission by many authorities (tawâtur) which plays such an important role as a criterion of truth and as a means for the achievement of knowledge in the epistemological efforts of Muslim historians and the science, of \u0003adîth.157 For Ibn \u0003Arabî, knowledge is a psychological human need greater than the physiological need for food.158 The legal-religious knowledge can be compared to the food used by the body. Like food, it ought to be consumed only in moderate portions, because too much of it would be of no use and may cause harm. On the other hand, the knowledge that is concerned with the supernatural knows no limitations, and can and ought to be taken in unlimited amounts, if at all possible.159The four large areas of knowledge are logic, mathematics, physics, and metaphysics. Metaphysics is the highest knowledge of them all. All the other kinds of knowledge are subordinated to 150 Cf. Futû\u0003ât, I, 31, also, II, 598, 644 ff.151 Cf. Futû\u0003ât, I, 38 ff.

Life, among the four essential divine attributes, is a necessary condition for the existence of knowledge, which, in turn, outranks the other two.161 All other knowledge, Ibn \u0003Arabî says following Abû Yazîd al-Bis\u0006âmî, is dead knowledge, but ûfî knowledge comes from the Living One who does not die. Thus, it is the only living, the only valuable knowledge.162Much more could be said about the scattered references from Ibn \u0003Arabî dealing with problems of knowledge in his Futû\u0003ât. Their sum and substance is given in the second section of the third chapter that has as its subject “knowledge, the object known, and the knower.”163 It may be offered here in translation, as it is a very learned and at the same time popular exposition of the mystic creed inasmuch as it was affected by the fundamental mysteries of knowledge. As was the custom of Ibn \u0003Arabî, a few verses, usually of his own composition, sound the keynote on which the discussion is to proceed:“Knowledge, the object known, and the knowerAre three to be considered one.If you wish, they may as they are be consideredIn the eye of the witness as three.But the Lord of the supernatural is seen as One.There is nothing additional to Him in the heights.Let it be known to you—may God give you strength!—that knowledge is the attainment by the heart of some matter corresponding to what it is itself, whether this matter is non-existent or existent.164 Knowledge is the attribute that makes the attainment necessary for the heart. The knower is the heart. And the object known is the matter attained.The perception (ta\u0015awwur) of the reality of knowledge is a very dif\u0002cult matter.

If at some time it must be admitted that it has become rusty—in accordance with the \u0003adîth of the Prophet, ‘Hearts may become rusty as does iron, etc.,’165 which then goes on to say that they can be cleansed by means of the remembrance of God and the reading of the Qur\u0002ân, inasmuch, however, as this belongs to “wise remembrance” (Qur\u0002ân 3:58/51)—, such rust is not meant to be a \u0002lm extending over the surface of the heart. When the heart closely concerns itself with the knowledge of the causes (of the material world) and is thereby diverted from the knowledge of God, such concern with something other than God constitutes rust upon its surface. It prevents the revelation of the Truth to the heart covered with it, because the divine presence continuously reveals itself as it cannot properly be imagined to be ever veiled to us. Now, when such a heart does not accept (the divine presence) by way of the praiseworthy address of the religious law, because it has accepted something else instead, one speaks of the acceptance of that other thing as “rust, cover, padlock, blindness, encrustation” (Qur\u0002ân 83:14/14), and so on. However, you may truthfully assume that (such a heart) possesses knowledge. This, however, would be a knowledge of something else but God, whereas, in fact, knowledge for those who know God is the knowledge of God. Our interpretation is con\u0002rmed by the word of God: ‘They said: Our hearts are under cover from (and therefore not responsive to) what you call us to’ (Qur\u0002ân 41:5/4). In particular, they were under cover from (and therefore not responsive to) that to which the Messenger of God was calling them. Not that they were really under a cover, but they were concerned with something other than that to which they were called. Therefore, they became blind to the perception of what they were called to, and did not see anything. By nature, hearts are always clean, polished, and clear. Every heart in which the divine presence reveals itself inasmuch as it is a Red Ruby which is essential revelation, is the heart of the beholder, the perfecter (or: the one perfected?), the knower, above which there is nobody in any self-revelation. Below it, there is the self-revelation of the attributes, and below these two, the self-revelation of the actions inasmuch as they stem 165 Cf. F.

The heart of the one to whom they do not reveal themselves inasmuch as they stem from the divine presence is the heart that is neglectful of God, that is driven away from nearness to God.Therefore, look—may God give you success!—at the heart in the light of what we have mentioned, and see whether you can assume that (the heart) is knowledge. This will be found not to be so. And if you say, its essential polish (is knowledge), this is not possible. Rather, (the essential polish) is the cause, just as the appearance of the object known to the heart is the cause. And if you say, the cause that causes the object known to be attained by the heart, this is not possible either. And if you say, the image (or: idea, mithâl) of the object known that is impressed upon the soul, that is to say, the perception of the object known, this, again, is not possible. Thus, if you are asked what knowledge is, say, ‘Knowledge is attaining the object perceived as it is itself, provided that attaining it is not impossible.’166 The knowledge of what is impossible of attainment is precisely its non-attainment, as the Truthful Person (Abû Bakr a\t-iddîq) has said, ‘the inability to attain perception is perception.’167 He thus considered the knowledge of God the non-attainment of it. This should be realized. However, this means non-attainment of (the knowledge of God) as far as acquisition by the intellect is concerned, as something else may be known,168 but attainment of (the knowledge of God) through His generosity, nobility, and spiritual gifts, as the gnostics, men of vision (shuhûd ), may know (\u0002-r-f ) Him, and not through the power of the intellect by way of its rational speculation. Complementary remark: Since it has been established that knowledge (\u0002ilm) of something can be achieved only through a knowledge (ma\u0002rifah) that is preceded by the knowledge about (ma\u0002rifah) something else which provides the absolutely necessary relationship between two objects known (ma\u0002rûfayn), and since it has been established that between God and His creation, there does not exist any such relationship of genus, species, or individual as does exist between things, we have no previous 166 Cf. de\u0002nition C-3, above, p. 56.167 Cf. above, p. 141.168 It seems necessary to read yu\u0002lam, instead of ya\u0002lamuh.ROSENTHAL-f8_155-193.indd 19010/17/2006 2:12:40 PM"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" knowledge is light  191knowledge of something whereby, through the relationship between the two, we could perceive the essence of the Truth. Take, for instance, our knowledge of the nature of the spheres as being a \u0002fth nature. We could not have known it at all, if we did not have a previous knowledge of the four elements (lit., mothers). When we saw that the spheres did not form part of these (four) natures and had to be considered as different from these (four) elements, we realized that there was a \u0002fth nature, this on the basis of the motion high up in the ether and the air, of the motion down below in the water and the earth, and of the relationship between the spheres and the elements as substances (al-jawharîyah), which constitutes a genus embracing the universe, as species (an-naw\u0002îyah), as they (the spheres) are a species just as they (the elements) are a species for a single genus, and also as individuals (ash-shakh\u0015îyah). Without this relationship, on the basis of the natures (elements), we would not know anything about the nature of the sphere. There is no relationship between the Creator and the world in these respects. He can thus never be known through a previous knowledge of something else, as some assume by inference from the visible (shâhid) to the supernatural (ghâ\bib) on the basis of knowledge, will, speech, and other (attributes), transferring all that upon the divine (lit., sanctifying it) in analogy to observations made on themselves.Our opinion concerning our knowledge of God is con\u0002rmed by the fact that knowledge is graded according to the objects known and is distinguished in its essence by the distinctions existing within the objects known. The thing by which an object known becomes distinct can be either an essence on the basis of its substantiality, as, for instance, the intellect and the soul, or an essence on the basis of its nature, as, for instance, the heat and the burning of \u0002re. As the intellect is distinguished from the soul on the basis of its substantiality, thus the \u0002re is distinguished from other things, as we have mentioned. Or it can be distinguished by its essence but on the basis of what serves it as a substratum, either as situation (\u0003âl)—for instance, the sitting of someone who sits, or the writing of someone who writes—, or as formation (hay\bah)—for instance, the blackness of what is black, or the whiteness of what is white. This is as far as the perceptions of the intellect go in the opinion of intelligent persons. There is nothing that can be de\u0002nitely known through it outside what we have described, only through our knowing by what it is distinguished from other things on the basis of its substance, nature, situation, or formation. Whatever does not include these things cannot be known through the intellect, and they do not exist in God. Therefore, the intellect cannot know God inasmuch as it speculates and investigates.

And how could an intelligent person claim that he has come to know His Lord on the basis of logical proof, and that the Creator is known to him! If he were to look at all the technical, natural, and variously created (takwînîyah, inbi\u0002âthîyah, ibdâ\u0002îyah) products and notice how each one of them is ignorant of its producer, he would know that God can never be known through logical proof. It can be known that God exists and that the world needs Him essentially and inescapably. God says: ‘O people, you are the ones who need God, while God is unneeding and praiseworthy’ (Qur\u0002ân 35:15/16).”Thus far Ibn \u0003Arabî on what knowledge is and how it can be attained, and, above all, why God cannot therefore be rationally known, while it is understood that He can be reached through gnosis. Ibn \u0003Arabî is also aware, as we would expect, of the educational-societal view of knowledge, which he feels free to interpret according to his own theories. He praises the excellence of knowledge.170 He cites Ibn as-Sîd al-Ba\u0006alyawsî (d. 521/1127) to the effect that the higher the station is which a person reaches in the world, the less is his knowledge (\u0002ulûm), and whenever he gives up his high station in life, his knowledge widens.171 But the real teacher is God,172 and the number of \u0002ulûm in the world is almost in\u0002nite. The gnosis has its number of \u0002ulûm, and each one of the stations (manzil) on the mystic path can claim to be an \u0002ilm.173The power of the concept of “knowledge” is as easily perceptible in the work of Ibn \u0003Arabî as it is throughout û\u0002sm. Opposed to the dominance of legalistic theological thinking and its view of knowledge and disinclined to any rationalistic determination of knowledge, û\u0002sm has always felt compelled throughout its great history to pay its respects, as it were, to both and, in addition, to 169 Apparently, yastanid ilâ is to be read, instead of the yustanid ilayh of the printed text.170 Cf.

Mu\bammad often says that knowledge “comes” to human beings, that it is “given” or “taught” to them by God, that, in fact, the only knowledge there is the knowledge God has taught mankind beginning with Adam, the \u0002rst human being. For early Muslims, knowledge was the result of a process of learning, as expressed in the tradition that “knowledge is attained only through study” (innamâ l-\u0002ilm bi-t-ta\u0002allum).1 This tradition is, for instance, worked into a verse ascribed to the early gnomic poet, Sâbiq al-Barbarî,2 or used in a discussion with the caliph, Mu\u0003âwiyah,3 or cited by the ûfî, Abû Sa\u0003îd al-Kharrâz,4 or paraphrased by the wise young prince, in the story cycle of Shimâs and Jalî\u0003âd preserved in the Arabian Nights.5 It was prized as an indication of the down-to-earth sim-plicity with which early Muslims had approached problems that had become extremely complicated, or, it was often thought, had been made so unnecessarily. However, already in the Qur\u0002ân there are enough hints to show that in the environment of the Prophet, the problems of what knowledge was and how it could be acquired were familiar ones, even if they might not always have been consciously realized.6Such realization came rapidly enough when Islam spread and learned not only about Christian theology based upon Hellenistic 1 Among the “canonical” collection, this \u0003adîth is to be found only in al-Bukhârî, cf. above, p. 79.

Aristotelian logic was probably among the earliest Greek materials made available in Arabic translation,7 and it might very well have exercised its in\u0003uence at the very beginnings of the Muslim con-cern with knowledge. However this might have been, Greek logic be-came the foundation of all Muslim epistemology as the result of the translation activity of the ninth century. It stayed on to form the only systematic scienti\u0002c framework available to Muslim scholars for intellec-tual expression from that time on. Religious opposition developed to it almost instantly and never stopped growing and gaining vocal support-ers. But embattled as it was, logic always found its steadfast champions who defended its usefulness and, indeed, indispensability as a neces-sary instrument for all scholarly activity. Logic was considered and re-ferred to as a “craft” or “technique” (\u0015inâ\u0002ah) but also, and perhaps with greater frequency, as an \u0002ilm, a scholarly discipline.8 It was the science that produced certain knowledge (al-\u0002ilm al-yaqîn).9 Logic provided the justi\u0002cation and the system of classi\u0002cation for scholarly and scienti\u0002c disciplines.10 It in\u0003uenced the discussions of \u0003adîth scholars and histori-ans as to the possible ways of attaining to the “truth.”11The discussion of epistemology thus did not remain restricted to con-cerned philosophers and professional logicians. It spread to form the foundations of systematic theology and jurisprudence, and in this way penetrated right to the core of Muslim thinking. The philosophical view of the concept of knowledge was expressed primarily in the works of scholars directly concerned with the study of logic, but then again, it found expression in the works dealing with the u\u0015ûl al-\u0002ilm, the “principles,” or, more literally, the “roots” of knowledge, that is, systematic speculative theology (kalâm), and it also gained a strong foothold in the works on the 7 Cf. the discussion about the translation ascribed to Ibn al-Muqaffa\u0003, possibly a son of the famous littérateur, which was started by P. Kraus, in RSO, XIV (1934), 1–14. 8 Al-Fârâbî, for instance, made indiscriminating use of both \u0002ilm al-man\u000fiq and \u0015inâ\u0002at al-man\u000fiq, and this was the usual state of affairs. 9 Cf.

The attitudes of the repre-sentatives of these disciplines toward the concept of knowledge are the main concern of the present chapter. Since, however, the starting point of it all was works written in Greek, it may be well \u0002rst to compare brie\u0003y the Arabic terminology employed in translating Greek words for mental activity into a language very different from Greek in structure and conceptualization.1. Graeco-Arabic Translation TerminologyIn the realm of abstract terminology, the consistent translation of a term from one language by another term in the second language is an obvious impossibility, as we have already often seen in the preceding pages. Not even those translators into Arabic from Greek or Syriac who preferred the word-by-word “transposition” method of translation would seem to have attempted it. \u0004unayn b. Is\bâq and his school of translators, who dominated Arabic translation activity, were opposed to the transposition method. They preferred a method of translation according to the sense, and in it, there was certainly no room for pedantic consistency in repro-ducing the vocabulary used for mental processes. Yet, it was not only the overall method of translation which determined the attitude toward con-sistency in the choice of words. The subject matter of the works trans-lated, too, quite naturally exercised a certain in\u0003uence in this respect. Thus, the translations of the Aristotelian corpus show considerable con-sistency in translating crucial abstract terms, much more so than is evi-dent in the more casual translations of works in other \u0002elds, especially if these were works of a more popular character. The particular problem that abstract epistemological terms posed for the understanding in their transition from one language to another did not remain unnoticed by Muslim scholars. Interestingly enough, it has found expression precisely in the case of “knowledge.” In eleventh-century Spain, Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr made the statement that “it has been said ( \u0002-mâ dhakarû) that (the word equivalent to) al-\u0002ilm among people who do not use the Arabic language may be translated in Arabic by \u0002ilm,12 or it may be translated by ma\u0002rifah, or it may be translated by fahm.”13 It is natural to assume that Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr’s authorities in this case were his own contemporaries 12 “By \u0002ilm” (\u0002ilmun) is omitted in the printed text.13 Cf.

It must also not be forgotten that authors who wrote in Greek so widely apart in time and on such widely different intellectual levels differed markedly in their linguistic usage. The lists above are incomplete in that they do not convey the right im-pression as to the possible variety of equivalents, especially in the cases of more common words. The equivalents tabulated are only a selected few out of all the numerous possibilities. Furthermore, an important element to be considered carefully would be frequency \u0002gures. They have not been included here, because no useful frequency \u0002gures could be obtained without an exhaustive lexicographical study of all the mate-rial. As indicated, there are, for instance, many possible translations for dokein, but \u0012-n-n is the one employed by far most frequently and most consistently, at least in the works of Aristotle.\u0002Ilm most commonly renders epistêmê. Ma\u0002rifah does not have any such clear-cut equivalent. Although \u0002-r-f would seem to be the preferred translation for gignôskein and related words, both \u0002-r-f and \u0002-l-m are used to render eidenai. In the material sifted, epistêmê is never rendered simply ma\u0002rifah, but some combinations with ma\u0002rifah do occur in connection with the translation of the Greek word. However, it should be noted that in some translations from the Greek, ma\u0002rifah may indeed take the place of epistêmê. Thus, the author of the Kitâb as-Sa\u0002âdah cites Socrates to the effect that “all virtues come into being only through ma\u0002rifah; they just are ma\u0002rifah.”29 This renders the statement found in both the Magna Moralia and the Eudemian Ethics (1182a16 and 1216b3 ff.) that Socrates had declared all virtues to be epistêmai. Aristotle considered this state-ment not true, but it was accepted Stoicism.30\u0002Ilm is used in Arabic more often than is epistêmê in the corre-sponding Greek texts. The Arabic word is needed for referring to the individual scholarly and scienti\u0002c disciplines, for which Greek 29 Cf. Kitâb as-Sa\u0002âdah, 412.30 Cf. Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta, ed. H. von Arnim, II, 30, l. 36 (reprint Leipzig 1923–24). For Plato’s equation of virtue with knowledge, cf., for instance, N. Gulley, Plato’s Theory of Knowledge (London and New York, n.y. [1961 ?, 1962 ?]). Western Hermeticism believed that “the wickedness of a Soul is Ignorance . . . the vertue of the Soul is Knowledge; for he that knows, is both good and religious, & already Divine,” cf. C. L. Marks, Thomas Traherne and Hermes Trismegistus, in Renaissance News, XIX (1966), 126.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 20210/17/2006 4:40:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"uses the feminine singular of the adjectival formation. The great fa-vor the word \u0002ilm enjoyed in Arabic also shows itself in other ways. On p. 94 of the translation of the Physics 194a18, we \u0002nd \u0002ilm four times as against the single occurrence of gnôrizein in the Greek passage. On p. 97, ya\u0002rifu is taken up by ya\u0002lamu, although only one verb is to be found in the Greek text. The root \u0002-l-m was also employed by the translator of the Tabula Cebetis in places where it did not have any counterpart in Greek.The most impressive aspect of the tabulation is, however, something that is hardly unexpected. This is the tremendous variety of ways in which the vast realm of mental activity of some sort or other can be expressed in both Greek and Arabic. This means that no general rule for the identi\u0002cation of terms is applicable in any given instance. Only where a \u0002rm school tradition took root, as in the case of the translations of Aristotle and by \u0004unayn, is there a noteworthy amount of consis-tency. Even there, exceptions to the use of what seems to be the pre-ferred equivalent are quite frequent. When the era of translation came to an end and contact with the original languages was completely lost, the process became stabilized inasmuch as the terminology employed in the existing translations by then was the only one available and no new variations were able to arise, except through the creative forces within the Arabic language. Individual authors were at liberty to make use of the terminological variety produced by the efforts of the translators and to interpret it according to their liking and insight. \u0002Ilm, of course, had acquired a life quite independent from whatever might have been the Greek term it served to translate.2. Logic, “The Science of Knowledge”Man\u000fiq (nu\u000fq) in Arabic means “speech.” It was chosen to serve as a literal and arti\u0002cial translation of the technical meaning of Greek logos. “The science of speech” (\u0002ilm al-man\u000fiq) thus became the Muslim term for logic. Scholars had occasionally to remind themselves as well as their readers that man\u000fiq had in fact two vastly different meanings and that it was im-portant to know which of these was intended in a given discussion. Thus, Ibn \u0004azm says that “the nu\u000fq mentioned in this discipline is not speech (kalâm). It is the discernment among things and the thinking about the logic, “the science of knowledge” 203ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 20310/17/2006 4:40:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"204 knowledge is thoughtsciences and crafts, business enterprises and the management of fairs.”31Logic was for the Muslims the “organ” or “instrument” (âlah), the instrument for logical speculation (âlat an-na\u0012ar),32 the instrument for each discipline (\u0002ilm) and the means enabling the student to get at its real meaning.33 It explained, and stood for, every one of the disciplines of knowledge (?).34 It was the canon (qânûn),35 providing the rules and norms that were applicable to all human knowledge and on which all human knowledge rested. It was the science of the scales (\u0002ilm al-mîzân),36 weighing the correctness of every statement. It was com-pared to “an equilibrating standard (\u0002iyâr mu\u0002addil) by which the objects of knowledge are weighed.”37 It was “the leader of the sciences” or “chief science” (ra\bis al-\u0002ulûm), the study of which had to come \u0002rst and was considered by some scholars as a religious duty obligatory upon every individual (and not only upon the community of Muslims), be-cause it furnished the necessary evidence for man’s knowledge of his Creator.38 It was, in a word, “the science of knowledge” (\u0002ilm al-\u0002ilm) or “the science of the sciences” (\u0002ilm al-\u0002ulûm).39 Its purpose was to dis-tinguish right from wrong, truth from falsehood.

When Ibn \u0003Arabî, Futû\u0003ât, II, 282, speaks of \u0002ilm al-\u0002ilm, he has in mind the discipline dealing with mystic theory, as against the \u0002ilm al-\u0002amal, the discipline dealing with mystic practice. This ap-pears to be meant also with Kitâb \u0002Ilm al-\u0002ilm, to which adr-ad-dîn al-Qônawî makes frequent reference in his Nafa\u0003ât. The vocalization \u0002ilm al-\u0002ilm is clearly intended by these mystics, but apparently it is \u0002alam al-\u0002ilm in the description of bayân “good style” as “the banner of knowledge”, cited by ath-Tha\u0003âlibî, Yatîmah, IV, 208 (Damascus 1304), as an epigram of Abû l-Fat\b al-Bustî.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 20410/17/2006 4:40:05 PM"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"all the rules (qawânîn) that have the task of setting the intellect straight and of directing man toward what is right and toward the truth regard-ing any of the intelligibilia with respect to which man may possibly err, all the rules that can preserve him from errors and mistakes with respect to the intelligibilia, and all the rules for checking on the intelligibilia with respect to which one cannot be certain that someone did not err in the past.” As the individual disciplines teach the particular rules applicable to their particular problems, thus logic supplies the general theoretical basis. If, for instance, grammar teaches the rules governing one par-ticular language, logic teaches the rules applicable to all languages in general.40 There is no end to the words of praise for the usefulness of logic which extends to every discipline.41 All of them have the same tenor: Logic is the very foundation upon which all human knowledge rests. And knowledge is the necessary stepping stone to eternal bliss.42The constant restatement of the fundamental importance of logic was in large part apologetic. Many other Muslims, who were not logi-cians themselves, among them the majority of the representatives of a simplistic religiosity and piety who grew steadily more numerous over the centuries, held a very different view of the position of logic in hu-man civilization. Not infrequently, the occupation with it had thus to be a clandestine affair. Its intricacies were ridiculed by those unable and unwilling to master them. They were condemned as a mere jug-gling of words and meaningless gibberish. More ominous, they were “embodying unbelief and aiding heresy.”43 Logic was un-Islamic and therefore no doubt forbidden by the religious law.44 Its af\u0002nity to her-esy—“he who does logic courts heresy” (man taman\u000faqa tazandaqa)45—is the favorite theme of Ibn Taymîyah’s attacks on logic.

He asserts emphatically that far from being an individual duty, the cultivation of logic could not even be considered a community duty to be discharged by some members of the community at all times.47 No scholar in any scholarly discipline or science whatever has accomplished much through logic.48 In short, logic, like all the other Greek sciences, had come into the world through the machinations of Satan, and it was one of the means by which the true faith of pious believers could be undermined and Islam, perhaps, eventually be destroyed. These attacks upon logic were at times effective in discouraging the study of and the writing on logic but only to a certain degree. They started out early in Muslim history, certainly as early as the ninth century, but by then, logic had already deeply penetrated into the inner recesses of Muslim civilization. Hostility did not succeed in dislodging it from its entrenched position, and the criticism directed against it even by champions of the sharp word and the bitter invective such as Ibn Taymîyah had to acknowl-edge, grudgingly to be sure, its inescapable virtues. If the study of logic seems often to have stagnated and to have moved along well-trodden paths, this was due more to the scholastic character of the discipline than to attacks from outside. On the contrary, those attacks stiffened the attitude of the proponents of logic whose claims for it as the necessary helpmaid of theology grew consistently bolder. The enemies of logic believed that there were other means to achieve true knowledge, and they denied the claim of logic that it alone held the key to it. Yet, their entire thinking was dominated by logical categories and operated within the forms developed by them. Above all, they, no less than the logi-cians whom they attacked, were concerned with the problem of human knowledge. For them, too, it was the central problem not only of human but also of divine existence. As far as “knowledge” was concerned, there was little difference between friend and foe.46 \u0017\u0018\u0019\u0015\u001a\u001b\u001c\u0015\u001d\u001e\u001f !\u001b \"#\u0015\u0002Uyûn, II, 141; Ibn Taymîyah, Naq\u000e al-man\u000fiq, 54.47 Cf.

The Aristotelian “Organon” does not bother with a formal de\u0002nition of “knowledge.” The result was that numerous as such de\u0002nitions be-came in Muslim literature, they were not at home in works of logic as such, even if some of these works occasionally considered de\u0002nitions of knowledge. The quest of what knowledge was assumed major sig-ni\u0002cance in the religious realm, because much of the methodological approach to Muslim theology and law came to depend upon the answer to it. These \u0002elds therefore provided the home for de\u0002nitions of knowl-edge carefully elaborated and placed in conspicuous positions.50 Even there, however, such de\u0002nitions were thought dispensable when a brief summary was intended. Thus, a\t-âbûnî devoted some space to de\u0002ni-tions of knowledge in his fair-sized Kifâyah on speculative theology, but these de\u0002nitions were omitted by him, it seems as a matter of course, in his short basic treatise on the subject, the Bidâyah (on which the Kifâyah is a commentary).51 By and large, Muslim works on logic convey the impression that their subject is the nature of knowledge more directly and forcefully than the logical works of the Stagirite themselves. In the Greek text of the “Organon” and much of the later Greek logical litera-ture, a comparatively subdued use was made of the word “knowledge.” It was taken for granted that the student knew what was involved in the dif\u0002cult technical discussion of epistemology. In Muslim logical writing, on the other hand, it would seem to be the rare treatise long or short that does not start out with a reference to the various kinds of knowledge into which it was assumed knowledge could and had to be divided, with a declaration that knowledge consists of two parts and is either perception or apperception (ta\u0015awwur/ta\u0015dîq), accompanied by a constantly modi\u0002ed evaluation of the possible meaning of these two crucial terms; with a discussion of the difference between the changeable knowledge of par-ticulars and the permanent unchangeable knowledge of universals; or with a survey of the various ways and means by which human beings are 49 Remnants of Stoic logic, no longer recognized as such by Muslim scholars, have been isolated by modern scholars, cf.

It is in a way his best justi\u0002cation, since the word “knowledge” called for at least an initial attitude of respect wherever it was uttered.The history of logical studies in Islam remains to be written. The preserved works are numerous. The production of logical treatises ap-pears actually to increase in later centuries and, in particular, in the great expanse of Muslim territory located to the east of the Arab coun-tries. These works increased in subtlety and technical re\u0002nement, the more speculative theology reacted upon them and the more inevitable it became to think of divine knowledge simultaneously with broaching any aspect whatever of human logic.52 How intricate matters did in fact become can easily be gauged by the summary of the various ideas ad-vanced by religious logicians on the manner in which logic came to grips with the problem of knowledge, prepared in eighteenth-century India by at-Tahânawî in connection with the article on \u0002ilm in his great dic-tionary of technical terms. Unfortunately, most of the literature on logic remains unpublished and unstudied.53 The historical outlines can be dimly perceived, but they remain so broad as to be virtually meaningless. Major as well as minor details, which alone can give validity and value to a history of logic in Islam, have not yet been collected and classi\u0002ed in any meaningful way. It is clear, however, that regardless of changes in approach and method, Muslim logicians never lost sight of the fact that the primary function of their labors was to \u0002nd out about “knowl-edge” and to contribute to a comprehensive epistemology for all aspects of Muslim intellectual endeavor, including theology and jurisprudence.3.

Wensinck are unexceptionable (at least if one disregards Ismâ\u0003îlî-Shî\u0003ah theory which strikes out more in-dependently and gathers up a greater variety of philosophical and reli-gious elements). They may be expanded. They need not be changed or be improved. In the few pages devoted by Wensinck to \u0003esh them out, the principal evidence has been assembled. Little can be added to it, although the number of authors and works, most of them unpublished, is very large and presently not fully amenable to scholarly control. The task that remains to be done here is a description of some of the stages of this development—mentioning not all of the works known and re-ferred to elsewhere in this book but restricting ourselves to the more conspicuous ones—, from the point of view of the importance placed upon the concept of knowledge as the starting point of theological in-sight. It could well be said with the Mu\u0003tazilah Abû l-Qâsim al-Ka\u0003bî al-Balkhî (d. 319/931), speaking of al-Junayd, that in Islam the specula-tive theologians were wedded to “knowledge” as were the government secretaries to the mastery of proper linguistic, usage and the philoso-phers to the discussion of subtle ideas.55 About \u0002ve and a half centuries later, the relationship between logic and theology was simply formulated by al-Kâ\u0002yajî (d. 879/1474) in commenting as follows on the opening words of at-Taftâzâni’s Tahdhîb \u0002 l-man\u000fiq wa-l-kalâm: “Scholars custom-arily treat \u0002rst of matters connected with logic and then of matters con-nected with speculative theology, because the former is an instrument for mastering the latter.”56The origins are clearly recognizable. Epistemology was acknowledged by eighth-century Oriental Christianity within the Muslim Empire to be the necessary foundation of theology. The best evidence available to us is again the famous Pêgê gnôseôs “Fount of Knowledge” of John of Damascus. The work consists of three books, of which the \u0002rst provides the philosoph-ical underpinning, while the second and third deal with, respectively, sects and the orthodox faith. The title properly belongs only to the \u0002rst book, 54 Cf. Wensinck, Muslim Creed, 248. For a detailed bibliography of \u0002aqîdahs, cf. the introduction of H.

Nor did he intend to introduce “knowledge” as a synonym of religion, although in his view, the teaching of religion was the teaching of true knowledge and the elimination of false knowledge. The problem with which he was concerned was epistemological. He recognized that an understanding of the meaning of knowledge was essential to any attempt to clarify the true character of religion and faith, and this was what he set out to do.58 The identical spirit manifested itself in Muslim speculative theology, and it would be far-fetched indeed to deny that the older cultural tradition here in\u0003uenced the developing new religion through channels not quite tangible to us but none the less real.It can be assumed that the more solid acquaintance with Greek logic which came through the translations gave Muslim theologians the op-portunity to essay literary formulations of the idea of epistemology as the basis of theology. In all likelihood, they were not slow in adopt-ing the procedure of providing their writings with epistemological in-troductions. This may have happened already in the later years of the eighth century or in the early ninth century. Since the early treatises are lost or not yet known, it is not possible for us to say who might have been the \u0002rst Muslim authors to start the process that was completed during the tenth century. It has been stated, and seemingly with good reason as far as our present knowledge goes, that the Kitâb at-Taw\u0003îd by al-Mâturîdî (d. 333/994–45) is the oldest treatise, on Mu\bammadan 57 Cf. B. Kotter, Die Überlieferung der Pege Gnoseos, 1 (Ettal 1959, Studia Patristica et Byzantina 5).58 Cf. also the Syriac Christian work by Joseph \u0004azzâyâ, entitled Rêshê \rî\ra\u0002\u000bâ, which has been erroneously placed into the seventh century but which apparently dates from the eighth century. It appears to have been a minor compilation dealing with edifying sayings and certain theological questions and to have been written somehow in the tradition of and in connection with the work of Evagrius Ponticus. It may have been in a way a forerunner of both the traditionist and the speculative theological occupa-tion with knowledge among Muslims, although its concern with knowledge may have been restricted to its title.

According to \u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr, the \u0002rst duty of the responsible Muslim, and a necessary duty at that,60 is rational speculation, which leads to the knowledge of God.61 As becomes clear from repeated references, the existence of the \u0002ve basic principles of Mu\u0003tazilah dogmatics forms the subject, in each case, of a particular knowledge (‚ilm). There are various kinds of rational speculation which require explanation.62 Only then is “knowledge” (ma\u0002rifah) de\u0002ned. \u0002Ilm, as well as dirâyah, are equivalents (na\u0012â\bir) of ma\u0002rifah, meaning “that which brings with it satisfaction and restful assuredness” (mâ yaqta\u000eî sukûn an-nafs wa-thalaj a\u0015-\u0015adr wa-\u000fum\banînat al-qalb), or rather, according to \u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr’s de\u0002nition from his Kitâb al-\u0002Umad, \u0002ilm is “the belief that satis\u0002es the soul that its object (mu\u0002taqad) is as one believes it to be.”63 “Knowledge” (\u0002ilm) is identical with “belief ” (i\u0002tiqâd), although this was denied by Abû l-Hudhayl al-\u0003Allâf who as-sumed that knowledge was a genus ( jins) by itself. However, it does not include belief based upon a blind adherence to tradition or haphazard guessing. It is a belief that satis\u0002es (sukûn an-nafs) the believer.64 The ne-cessity of rational speculation is indicated by the belief that God is not known either of necessity or through observation by the senses,65 nor is continuous information based on the reports of numerous reliable authorities a source of the knowledge of God.66 The way to know some-thing, unless it is known of necessity, is through argument and proof (dalîl, dalâlah). This includes the Qur’ân, the sunnah, and the general consensus (ijmâ\u0002\u0005). But for attaining the knowledge of God, reasoning is 59 Cf. J. Schacht, in Studia Islamica, I (1953), 41.

His work represents a late stage of Mu\u0003tazilism. However, its treatment of knowledge as an introduction to the dogmatic exposition gives the de\u0002nite expression of re\u0003ecting a stage prior to the work of al-Mâturîdî and the Ash\u0003arites. Thus, the need for rational speculation is stressed before the de\u0002nition of knowledge is presented (as was done later still in the work of the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn). “Knowledge” is not yet emancipated from its spe-ci\u0002c meaning of man’s knowledge of God, and ma\u0002rifah as against \u0002ilm is the preferred term, which appears to be the older way of referring to dogmatic theology. All this would seem to con\u0002rm the assumption that \u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr has preserved the original approach to the subject as practiced by the ninth-century Mu\u0003tazilah and, presumably, expounded by them in their writings.68\u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr’s Mughnî, in its twelfth part devoted to speculation and knowledge, tells the same story in even greater detail. Throughout the Mughnî, “knowledge” plays a conspicuous and often fundamental role in the argumentation of whatever problem is under discussion. Whether the Mughnî’s concern with the signi\u0002cance of traditional information (akhbâr) as a source of knowledge (cr., especially, Mughnî, XV, 342 ff.) was shared by the earlier Mu\u0003tazilah literature seems, however, somewhat uncertain in the absence of direct evidence.Another indication of an early date for the combination of epis-temology and theology among Muslim writers is to be found in the noteworthy fact that in Jewish circles, Qaraite as well as orthodox, this combination appears in theological writings as early as the time of al-Mâturîdî. Sa\u0003adyâh (882–942) completed his famous “Book of Beliefs and Opinions” (Kitâb al-Amânât wa-l-i\u0002tiqâdât) in the year 933. The work contains a detailed discussion of Jewish theology on an intellectual level equal to that of contemporary Islam. As a scholar and theologian, Sa\u0003adyâh shows himself fully aware of the importance of secular learn-ing as well as very conscious of the necessary character of the basic 67 Cf. \u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr, 88.68 For Mu\u0003tazilah monographs on ma\u0002rifah, cf. above, pp. 148 f.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 21210/17/2006 4:40:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"material and spiritual/religious human urges.69 The introductory re-marks of his work lay the foundation for what is to follow by discuss-ing the problem of doubt and the means for attaining knowledge. For Sa\u0003adyâh, the scienti\u0002c study of theology is commanded by Scripture and shunned by unbelievers and heretics. The existence of doubt is not due to a fault in divine planning. It is inherent in the fact of created-ness. Perfect knowledge without any uncertainties would make man identical with God. The fact of their createdness makes it obligatory for human beings to perform all their actions step by step and within a given time span. This includes the activity of knowing. It requires a gradual progression from obscurity and confusion to greater clarity and a more assured insight. There are three sources of certain knowledge ( yaqîn, \u0003aqq), namely, sense perception and observation (\u0002ilm ash-shâhid ), the intuition of reason (\u0002ilm al-\u0002aql ), and knowledge derived from logical necessity (\u0002ilm mâ dafa\u0002at a\u000e-\u000earûrah ilayh). Sense perception is the funda-mental source upon which the other two must draw. We Jews, Sa\u0003adyâh says, admit of a fourth source of knowledge, that is, sound traditional information (al-khabar a\u0015-\u0015âdiq) based upon knowledge derived from both sense perception and reason. This, of course, is something not unknown also to Muslim theologians, even if the rationalists among them whom Sa\u0003adyâh has in mind played it down, but in this respect, the Jewish theologian must naturally differ from his Muslim colleagues as to where authoritative tradition has to be sought. Sa\u0003adyâh admits that various groups have rejected one or more of the three philosophi-cal sources of knowledge. This has been a mistake on their part. There are factors that may vitiate each one of the three, but once the nature of such factors is known, they can be avoided. Since the necessary knowl-edge, the third of the three mentioned sources of certainty, is specially important with regard to matters metaphysical, the \u0002ve factors that may vitiate its correctness require particular attention. Knowledge system-atized in particular disciplines is often needed in order to place data 69 Cf. Sa\u0003adyâh’s chapter on philosophy (\u0003ikmah), 309 ff. of S.

Al-Qirqisânî has an introductory chapter dealing in a summary fashion with the sects known to him, but then he enters into a discussion of the possible ways of gaining knowledge. Regrettably, the text of the relevant chapters happens to be lost, and we know about their existence only through the table of contents indicating the chapter headings.70 However, it is certain that Jewish theology at the beginning of the tenth century at the latest was fully conscious of the fundamental importance of epistemology, and this would argue for an earlier date among Muslims.Among Muslim authors, the Kitâb al-Yâqût by Abû Is\bâq an-Nawbakhtî may be considered further evidence for the pre-Mâturîdian combination in scholarly literature of epistemology and dogmatics. Ibn Nawbakht’s lifetime is not known for certain, but he may have \u0003our-ished not later than the \u0002rst half of the tenth century. The original work is not preserved. It seems, however, that it can be reconstructed with reasonable certainty from the much later commentary written by the \u0003Allâmah al-\u0004illî, entitled Anwâr al-malakût fî shar\u0003 al-Yâqût.71 Here again, the meaning and necessary character of rational speculation are discussed, as are its role in securing \u0002ilm and the role of traditional evi-dence (ad-dalîl as-sam\u0002î ) in connection with the achievement of certain knowledge ( yaqîn). “Then, the author gives his de\u0002nition of \u0002ilm,72 and the various aspects of \u0002ilm and its relationship to rational speculation are mentioned. All this precedes the treatment of the basic physical facts and the discussion of theological and dogmatic data, which includes a clari\u0002cation of the concept of God’s knowledge as well as the character of human knowledge. There remains some doubt as to whether the ar-rangement of the topics in the original work, which was evidently quite brief, was the same as the one we \u0002nd in the \u0003Allâmah’s commentary. However, unless evidence to the contrary should be forthcoming, we may assume that this was indeed the case. Thus, in the Kitâb al-Yâqût, we \u0002nd 70 Cf. al-Qirqisânî, Anwâr, 64 ff.71 Cf. above, p. 49, n. 3; GAL, Suppl., I, 320.72 Cf. de\u0002nition B-2, above, p. 53.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 21410/17/2006 4:40:07 PM"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"a Twelver-Shî\u0003ah view of the situation that in its signi\u0002cant outlines is not different from the “orthodox” view as it developed and entered theological literature in the course of the ninth century.The Kitâb al-Bad\b wa-t-ta\brîkh, which was written in 355/966, also con-tains an epistemological introduction discussing rational speculation and \u0002ilm and the various ways of attaining knowledge before discussing basic data of Muslim theology.73 The remarkable thing is that this ap-pears here, rather uniquely, within the framework of a historical study and is presented as a necessary preliminary for the understanding of the history of the world. Very likely, this combination of history and philo-sophical theology was the author’s own original idea. It is, perhaps, pos-sible that the philosophical theology presented by him was something very modern and new when he hit upon utilizing it for gaining a deeper insight than existed before into the historical process. However, it would seem much more likely that the Kitâb al-Bad\b followed the well-estab-lished scheme of considerably earlier theological works and can be ad-duced as evidence for the existence of the epistemological introduction to dogmatics at a date much before its time and that of al-Mâturîdî.The brief creed attributed to al-Mâturîdî also starts with a simple re-mark on the three sources of knowledge, sound (sense) perception, right intelligence, and traditional information derived from trusted authori-ties. It also refers to the false assumptions of the “Sophists” who point to the alleged shortcomings of these sources of knowledge and maintain that knowledge is not possible.74The lasting formulation of the theory of knowledge as an intro-duction to theology was developed in Ash\u0003arite circles. Al-Ash\u0003arî himself, it was claimed by A. J. Wensinck,75 does not appear to have suggested, let alone worked out, an epistemological founda-tion for his theological creed. His Ibânah, where we would be in-clined to look for one, does not have an introduction dealing with the theory of knowledge.76 However, al-Ash\u0003arî wrote many works where such an introduction would have been appropriate and 73 Cf. above, p. 117, n. 1.

In fact, we are told by Ibn \u0003Asâkir that his “Fu\u0015ûl on the Refutation of Heretics, etc.,” contained an introductory chapter de-voted to the subject of rational speculation (na\u0012ar) which might very well have included al-Ash\u0003arî’s views on epistemology.77 Of\u0002cial Ash\u0003arite epistemology makes its full-blown appearance for us in the Kitâb at-Tamhîd by al-Bâqillânî (d. 403/1013).78 How much of al-Bâqillânî’s exposition is his own and how much he owed to his colleagues and pre-decessors, remains an open question at this stage of our knowledge. The author starts out with the de\u0002nition of knowledge as “the cognition of the object known as it is,” explaining that the term “object known” is required instead of the term “thing,” because object known includes also the non-existent and may thus be either a thing or not a thing.79 He recognizes the non-existent next to the existent as one of the two divi-sions of the objects of knowledge. There are two kinds of knowledge, just as there are two kinds of objects known. There is the primeval (un-created, qadîm) knowledge of God, and the created (mu\u0003dath) knowledge of all living beings, humans, angels, jinn, and others. The latter knowl-edge is again subdivided twofold, into necessary (\u000earûrî ) knowledge and speculative, deductive (na\u0012ar, istidlâl) knowledge.80 Necessary knowl-edge, which is also needed knowledge, is a knowledge which adheres 77 Cf. Ibn \u0003Asâkir, Tabyîn kadhib al-muftarî, 128 f. (Damascus 1347). The passage was cited already, before the publication of the text, by W. Spitta, Zur Geschichte, Abu’l-\tasan al-A\u0004\u0002arîs, 68 (Leipzig 1876), and it was cited again by R. J. McCarthy. The Theology of al-Ash\u0002arî, 211 f. (Beirut 1953). The contents of al-Ash\u0003arî’s Kitâb al-Ma\u0002ârif cannot be easily surmised. The suggestion of McCarthy, 222, that it deals with epistemology remains uncertain.78 Cf. al-Bâqillânî.

It may be primeval (uncreated, qadîm) or created. The latter is to be divided into composite bodies, isolated substances, and accidents. The non-existent admits of \u0002ve categories. It may be 1. impossible or absurd, 2. possible but never actualized, 3. possible and existent in the future, 4. having existed in the past, and 5. possible in the sense that it may or may not be, while it is not known whether it will be or will not be.79 Cf. de\u0002nitions B-2 and B-3, above, pp. 53 f.80 For the relationship of God’s knowledge, which is not gone into further in this place by al-Bâqillânî as he discusses it later (Tamhîd, 197 ff.), and the two kinds of created knowledge, cf. above, p. 128.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 21610/17/2006 4:40:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"so \u0002rmly to the soul of created beings that they cannot escape or doubt it in any way. Speculative knowledge is a knowledge that follows upon de-duction and re\u0003ection. It is “acquired” (kasbî ), that is, it is existing in the knower through a created potency. It rests upon necessary knowledge and sense perception. The necessary knowledge of the object known is attained by the perception of the \u0002ve senses which provide necessary knowledge free from doubt, and it may be created originally (ibtidâ\b\u0005an) in the soul. This includes psychological data and the like. It also includes knowledge derived from continuous reports of numerous informants (tawâtur), such as geographical information about remote countries, in-formation about the prophets of old, and other historical knowledge. It may, or may not, be con\u0002rmed by sense perception. Knowledge based on these factors may be extended in numerous ways by logical deduc-tion (istidlâl ), which may also be applied to traditional (sam\u0002i) sources of information. It requires an understanding of the meaning of what constitutes logical proof (dalîl ).81An extensive summary of the corresponding views expressed by \u0003Abd-al-Qâhir b. \u0005âhir al-Baghdâdî (d. 429/1037–38) can be found in Wensinck’s work.82 A brief exposition of the epistemological founda-tion was given by the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn as a preface to his Irshâd. The Imâm al-\u0004aramayn also expressed himself at greater length on the problems of rational speculation in his Shâmil fî u\u0015ûl ad-dîn.83 His basic contention in the Irshâd is that rational speculation is the prime source of knowledge. Some of the ancients, he says, held the opinion that all knowledge is derived from sense perception, and they denied that ra-tional speculation could lead to knowledge. He refutes this view. He maintains that na\u0012ar contrasts with the knowledge of the object specu-lated about as well as with the ignorance of it or doubt concerning it, but it leads to knowledge either sound or unsound, depending on whether it itself is sound or unsound. It guarantees or implies (\u000e-m-n V) the attainment of knowledge but does not, as was the Mu\u0003tazilah 81 For a concise formulation of this theory of knowledge, “the causes (asbâb) of knowl-edge,” one may compare the translation of the introduction of the Creed of an-Nasa\u0002 (d. 537/1142), which became highly in\u0003uential, and its commentary by at-Taftâzânî, written in 768/1366–67, by E.

The attainment of knowledge not known before by means of sound speculation is by way of compelling evidence (adil-lah), with the argument being based either upon reason or upon tradi-tion. For the Mu\u0003tazilah, rational speculation is necessitated by reason, whereas for the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn, it is necessitated by the religious law (shar\u0002\u0005). After having explained how knowledge is attained, the author proceeds to de\u0002ne knowledge, expressing himself in favor of the same de\u0002nition as al-Bâqillânî but adding, as became henceforth the custom of speculative theologians, a discussion of a number of de\u0002ni-tions by both Ash\u0003arites and Mu\u0003tazilah, which he feels compelled to reject. Again, knowledge is divided into the primeval knowledge of God and the newly arising (\u0003âdith, as against al-Bâqillânî’s mu\u0003dath “created in time”) knowledge of man. The latter is to be subdivided into necessary (\u000earûrî ), intuitive (badîhî ), and acquired (kasbî ) knowledge. The former two may be used interchangeably. All knowledge may be called specu-lative-acquired (kasbî na\u0012arî). Knowledge possesses its opposites in con-cepts such as ignorance ( jahl ), doubt (shakk), or guesswork (\u0012ann). Reason (\u0002aql ) involves all the necessary knowledge there is.In the next, eleventh century, we meet again with the most articu-late spokesman for the need of combining another kind of theology, that of mysticism, with logic, the excessively intellectual, tragic \u0002gure of as-Suhrawardî al-maqtûl. The ordinary philosophical vision of all knowledge into logic, physics, and metaphysics was put by him into the service of his particular brand of theology. Half of his \tikmat al-ishrâq84 is devoted to the discussion of certain points of Aristotelian logic and physics. This discussion is brief but highly useful, as-Suhrawardî claims. It is not presented as an end in itself, nor is it destined for those who are concerned merely with objective scienti\u0002c research. It is meant for those who are already on their way toward metaphysical illumination. Epistemology is pressed here into the service of mysti-cism, not for any compelling need to do so, but by then, the tradition of using epistemology as an introduction to systematic theology had become so strong that no system-builder, in particular one who was also indebted to philosophy for his theological system, could ignore it. Following the trend that secured for \u0002ilm a position in mysticism equaling 84 Cf. above, pp. 160 and 185.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 21810/17/2006 4:40:08 PM"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"or surpassing that of ma\u0002rifah, adr-ad-dîn al-Qônawî attempted to underpin the mystic interpretation of the Qur\u0002ân with logical terms and concepts, as shown by his lengthy commentary on the \u0002rst sûrah. “Knowledge,” which for al-Qônawî is never very far from ûfî gnosis, is “an abstract universal reality,” or “a single universal reality.” In contrast to rational knowledge, no perception-and-apperception (ta\u0015awwur/ta\u0015dîq) is involved in the visionary knowledge of the mystic, as believed by the great mass, but only perception. The Qur\u0002ân is “the form of the knowl-edge that comprises the variety of possible conditions affecting existing things,” or it is the form of the divine attribute of knowledge.85 Another aspect of Muslim theology was thus invaded by logic in a rather intui-tive, unsystematic manner which, however, further shows the desire to divert the powerful current of thought centering around “knowledge” into special channels.With Sayf-ad-dîn al-Âmidî (551–631/1156–1233), a brilliant Syrian scholar greatly admired by those who knew the incisiveness of his mind and his impressive personality, the development reached what might be called its saturation stage. The material at al-Âmidî’s disposal which he had to consider in the name of scholarship and which required preser-vation and evaluation had become massive enough to \u0002ll many pages of long and involved discussion, even if, as was the intention of al-Âmidî, an author tried to make his work neither too long nor too short. The problems had been looked at from all possible angles. However, the inge-nuity of a scholar of al-Âmidî’s caliber would hardly have been satis\u0002ed with merely repeating what had been said before. He would insist upon his own, and to some degree novel, conclusions. The basic assumptions were no longer questioned, and the circle within which even the most acute mind was forced to move had become narrow and was completely circumscribed by the need to prove the unprovable. For al-Âmidî, the end and goal of human existence was perfection. Perfection was identi-cal for him with a comprehensive knowledge of the intelligibilia and of objects unknown. By his time, Muslim civilization had become fully con-scious of the tremendous burden of knowledge with which it had been saddled and which could be dropped only at the risk of its very existence; therefore, this accumulated knowledge required constant study and 85 Cf. al-Qônawî, I\u0002jâz al-bayân, 48, 54, 57, 219.

Time and human life are too brief to master all the sciences and things worth knowing (al-\u0002ulûm wa-l-ma\u0002ârif ). As these matters differ in importance, preference must be accorded to the most important and useful knowledge, that is, “speculative theology (\u0002ilm al-kalâm) which investigates the essence, attributes, and connected circum-stances of the Necessarily Existent One.” Al-Âmidî’s principal work on the subject, entitled Abkâr al-afkâr, shows the systematic arrangement and the predilection for classi\u0002cation which is so greatly characteristic of the ultimate stage of Aristotelian in\u0003uence. A mere reading of the table of contents is now often suf\u0002cient to tell the reader what to expect.Of the eight chapters (qâ\u0002idah) of the Abkâr, the \u0002rst four which con-stitute almost three-fourths of the entire work are devoted to questions considered to be related to epistemology. They deal with 1. knowledge and its subdivisions, 2. rational speculation and its subdivisions, 3. the methods which lead to the objects sought through rational speculation, and 4. the division of the objects of knowledge into existent, non-exis-tent, and neither existent nor non-existent. The fourth chapter, which takes up over nine times the space of the preceding three chapters, is to a large extent devoted to a discussion of God’s being, actions, and attributes. Epistemological problems are also dealt with later on in the Abkâr as, for instance, in the \u0002fth chapter dealing with the problems of prophecy.The discussion of knowledge and its subdivisions is, in turn, ar-ranged in four sections. The \u0002rst section discusses the meaning of knowledge and the de\u0002nitions that have been proposed for determin-ing this meaning. In this context, the opinion of the “Sophists” that there is no way of attaining any knowledge is mentioned as usual, but it is not discussed in detail. The schools, as al-Âmidî saw them, were those of the Mu\u0003tazilah, the Ash\u0003arites (al-Ash\u0003arî, Ibn Fûrak, and, in particular, al-Bâqillânî), the philosophers, and his own “colleagues” (a\u0015\u0003âb). Over \u0002fteen de\u0002nitions of knowledge are discussed by him, in-cluding the opinions of those who denied the possibility of de\u0002nition. Al-Âmidî’s objections centered principally around tautology, if a de\u0002-nition included, for instance, a reference to cognition or to the object known, and the like. Or they stress lack of comprehensiveness or fail-ure to take due account of the peculiar character of the knowledge of God.

It discards sense perception as a source of true knowledge and operates with the psychological category of discernment developing into a permanent habit able to decide that something must be so and cannot be different. The following attempt at translating al-Âmidî’s discussion of the true nature and de\u0002nitions of knowledge may stand here for the entire dogged effort of Muslim theology to derive the data of faith from epistemological premises:86“Scholars differ with regard to the notions that are indicative of the true meaning of knowledge.1. Some87 Mu\u0003tazilah say that ‘knowledge is believing the thing (to be) as it is.’88 This is not correct in view of the object of belief in connec-tion with the traditional belief (taqlîd) in the existence of God. For it89 is something believed (to be) as it is, and belief in it is not knowledge. This cannot be refuted, even if one adds to the de\u0002nition, ‘to one’s own satisfaction.’90 Furthermore, the de\u0002nition excludes a knowledge of the non-existent that is impossible of existence. For it is a knowledge (that is, something that can be known), but what belongs to it is not a thing, as is generally agreed.Some add to the de\u0002nition, ‘when it happens on the basis of necessity or proof.’91 While this addition removes the \u0002rst dif\u0002culty, it does not re-move the second dif\u0002culty. Those who think that knowledge does not go with the non-existent that is impossible of existence derive this idea by way of apperceptive knowledge (\u0002ilm ta\u0015dîqi ). Yet, apperceptive knowledge calls upon two kinds of perceptive knowledge (\u0002ilm ta\u0015awwurî ), and one of the two perceptions is the non-existent that is impossible of existence. Thus, they contradict their own assumption, in addition to slighting92 86 The three manuscripts of al-Âmidî, Abkâr, used here (Aya Sofya 2165, fols. 2a–4a; Aya Sofya 2167, fols. 2b–4b; Ahmet III 1774, Vol. 1, fols. 2a–3b), show quite a few discrepancies in their text. Aya Sofya 2167 and Ahmet III 1774, appear usually to go together as against Aya Sofya 2165. For the Aya Sofya manuscripts, see above, p. 47, n. 1. (The date of al-Âmidî’s birth as given above may be too early).87 In the translation, I have tried to distinguish between the plural “some” and the singular “someone.” However, it is not always absolutely certain what al-Âmidî had in mind in each given case. The use of singular forms in the continuation is not decisive. The plural may still be meant.88 Cf. de\u0002nition F-2, above, p. 63.89 That is, “the existence,” not “God” Himself.90 Cf. de\u0002nition F-3, above, p. 63.91 Cf. de\u0002nition F-4, above, p. 64.92 Mukâbiran: Aya Sofya 2157 munkiran “denying.” epistemology  221ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 22110/17/2006 4:40:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"222 knowledge is thoughtintuitiveness (badîhah) and the knowledge, found by every intelligent per-son himself, of the impossibility of negation and af\u0002rmation occurring together, which is not a matter of perception (ghayr muta\u0015awwar), with negation, moreover, being not knowable (ghayr ma\u0002lûm).2. Judge Abû Bakr (al-Bâqillânî) says that ‘knowledge is the cognition of the object known as it is.’93 This is not correct on two counts. First, God possesses knowledge, and there exists a general consensus to the effect that God’s knowledge cannot be called cognition (ma\u0002rifah). Thus, the de\u0002nition is not all inclusive. Secondly, al-Bâqillânî de\u0002nes knowl-edge (\u0002ilm) through the object known (ma\u0002lûm). Now, ma\u0002lûm is derived from \u0002ilm, and something derived from something is less obvious than the thing from which it is derived. It is impossible to de\u0002ne the more obvious through the less obvious. Also, the de\u0002nition contains a super-\u0003uous addition, namely, ‘as it is.’ The cognition of the object known must always be ‘as it is.’3. The Shaykh, al-Ash\u0003arî,94 uses several notions for the de\u0002nition knowledge. The \u0002rst is: ‘Knowledge is that which necessitates that he in whom it subsists is knowing.’95 The second is: ‘That which necessitates for him in whom it subsists the name of knower.’96 And the third is: ‘Knowledge is the perception (idrâk) of the object known as it is.’97 The \u0002rst two notions are adversely affected by the use of \u0002âlim (‘knowing, knower’), which is less obvious than \u0002ilm, in connection with the de\u0002ni-tion of \u0002ilm. The third notion also adversely affected by the use of the less obvious ma\u0002lûm for the de\u0002nition of \u0002ilm as well as by the use of idrâk in this connection. Idrâk is basically a species (naw\u0002\u0005) of knowledge, and it is impossible to de\u0002ne the genus by its species. Moreover, there is no need to add, ‘as it is,’ as stated before.4. Professor Abû Bakr b. Fûrak says that ‘knowledge is that through whose existence he in whom it subsists is enabled to act in an orderly fashion and to act well.’98 This is not correct. If Ibn Fûrak means by it ‘that through which acting well and in an orderly 93 Cf. de\u0002nition B-2, above, p. 53.94 The name is omitted in the manuscripts Aya Sofya 2167 and Ahmet III 1774.95 Cf. de\u0002nition A-7, above, p. 52.96 Cf. de\u0002nition A-6, above, p. 52.97 Cf. de\u0002nition C-1, above, p. 56.98 Cf. de\u0002nition J-1, above, p. 67.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 22210/17/2006 4:40:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"fashion is possible by means of deductive reasoning,’ this would be ab-surd, for acting in an orderly fashion not only depends on knowledge but on power (qudrah) as well. And if he means that acting in an orderly fashion depends on it but not exclusively so, as power is also required for it, (power) would be in the same position, and it is not knowledge. Also, one of us may have a knowledge which has no in\u0003uence upon the or-derly execution of any action either subsisting in him or outside of him, since in our basic view he is not the one to bring (actions) into existence. Furthermore, in order to show the incorrectness of the de\u0002nition, it has been said that there may be a knowledge of that through which acting in an orderly fashion is not possible, as, for instance, one’s knowledge of himself, of God, or of the impossible. What belongs to that is neither an action nor something through which acting in an orderly fashion is pos-sible. This argument, meant to prove the incorrectness of Ibn Fûrak’s de\u0002nition, requires the conclusion that (the de\u0002nition would, in fact, be acceptable), if one were to say: ‘Knowledge is that which makes the orderly execution of everything belonging to it possible.’ However, if what is meant is that which makes acting in an orderly fashion possible in general, it is not (acceptable).5. The Shaykh, Abû l-Qâsim al-Isfarâ\u0002inî, says that ‘knowledge is that through which one knows.’99 This, again, means de\u0002ning knowledge by something less obvious.6. One of the colleagues says: ‘Knowledge is the asseveration of the object known as it is.’100 This is wrong in three respects. The \u0002rst is that it de\u0002nes \u0002ilm through ma\u0002lûm. As stated above, this is wrong. The second is that if knowledge is the asseveration of the object known, the knower of the object known would be the one who asseverates the object known. This then requires the conclusion that our knowledge of the existence of the Lord is identical with asseverating it. This is absurd. The third is that ithbât (translated here ‘asseveration’) may be used in the mean-ing of ‘bringing something into existence’ or in the meaning of ‘caus-ing something to rest after motion,’ or it may be used metaphorically for knowledge. Obviously, ithbât is meant to be understood here in the \u0002rst sense. The second usage is impossible in our context. And the third usage would involve the de\u0002ning of knowledge through knowledge, which is impossible. 99 Cf. de\u0002nition A-1, above, p. 52.100 Cf. de\u0002nition D-3, above, p. 58. epistemology  223ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 22310/17/2006 4:40:09 PM"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"224 knowledge is thought7. Another colleague says that ‘knowledge is the clear understanding (tabayyun) of the object known as it is.’101 The (super\u0003uous) addition this de\u0002nition includes is obvious, as is the fact that it de\u0002nes \u0002ilm through something less obvious. Its particular (de\u0002ciency) is that tabayyun indi-cates appearance after concealment, clarity after obscurity. This makes it necessary to exclude the Lord’s knowledge from the de\u0002nition.8. Someone else says that ‘knowledge is the trust (thiqah) that the ob-ject known is as it is.’102 The (super\u0003uous) addition this de\u0002nition in-cludes is obvious, as is the fact that it de\u0002nes \u0002ilm through something less obvious. Moreover, knowledge as the trust with regard to the object known requires the conclusion that he in whom knowledge subsists be trusting. This would make it necessary for the Creator to be trusting with regard to what He is knowing. The employment of such a term for God is impossible according to the religious law.9. The philosophers say that ‘knowledge stands for the fact that the form of the object known has impressed itself upon the soul.’103 The consequence would be that the form of heat and of cold is impressed upon the soul of a person who knows heat and cold. This requires the conclusion that he who knows them be hot or cold ( just by knowing them). This is absurd. It may be contended that what impresses itself (upon the soul) is but the idea (mithâl) of the heat and the cold, and not the heat and the cold themselves. Against this contention, it may be argued that if the idea is equivalent (musâwî) in reality to what is repre-sented by it,104 the dif\u0002culty remains applicable. If not, it is not some-thing like (mithl ) it, and knowledge cannot belong to it.10. Because it is so dif\u0002cult to de\u0002ne knowledge, later schol-ars differ.105 Some say that there is no way to de\u0002ne knowledge by means of (verbal) de\u0002nition (\u0003add ). It can be de\u0002ned only through disjunction and example. Others say that the knowledge of knowl-edge is something intuitive (badîhî ), since anything other than knowledge can be de\u0002ned only through knowledge. Thus, if some-thing else were to de\u0002ne knowledge, it would be a case of circular 101 Cf. de\u0002nition D-1, above, p. 58.102 Cf. de\u0002nition F-1, above, p. 63.103 Cf. de\u0002nition E-5, above, p. 60.104 Aya Sofya 4167 has al-mumaththal, against al-mithl of the other manuscripts.105 Cf. above, p. 48.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 22410/17/2006 4:40:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"reasoning (dawr). Also, man knows of necessity his own existence. Knowledge is one of the two perceptions (ta\u0015awwur) of this intuitive ap-perception. Whatever the intuitive depends upon is itself intuitive. Ergo, the perception of knowledge is intuitive.Both views are not correct. The \u0002rst statement is not correct, because, if the mentioned method of de\u0002ning knowledge serves to attain the cognition (ma\u0002rifah) of knowledge and its distinction from other (mat-ters), (it is a legitimate method, since verbal) de\u0002nition (\u0003add ) means just that, and nothing else. If it does not serve to distinguish knowledge from other (matters), it does not de\u0002ne knowledge.The second statement is not cogent. Circular reasoning requires (for its presence) that the process of de\u0002ning (ta\u0003dîd ) is not taking place through some matter outside knowledge. This does not make the pro-cess of de\u0002ning absolutely impossible, since de\u0002nition is more general than de\u0002nition through some matter outside the thing de\u0002ned, as is ob-vious—unless knowledge is something simple, which it is not, since it is a species of the category of quality, according to one view, or of the category of relation, according to another. Thus, it is something com-pound. Moreover, it is not circular reasoning, since circular reasoning takes place only, if there is dependence upon one and the same aspect (ma\u0002a itti\u0003âd jihat at-tawaqquf ). Now, the other-than-knowledge depends upon knowledge not inasmuch as knowledge is an attribute distinguish-ing it, but inasmuch as it perceives (mudrik) it. And knowledge depends upon the other-than-knowledge through the contrary. Consequently, there is no circular reasoning at all.Even if man’s knowledge of his own existence (lit.: the existence of his soul) is intuitive, it does not follow that the various kinds of percep-tive knowledge (al-\u0002ulûm at-ta\u0015awwurîyah) are intuitive because of the exis-tence of the intuitive relation between the two. The only meaning there is to the intuitive proposition (al-qa\u000eîyah al-badîhîyah) is that, if knowledge of its details is attained, the intellect proceeds to (establish) the rela-tion necessary for them without depending upon rational speculation or deductive reasoning, and no matter whether the details in question are known through intuition or through rational speculation. Thus, the soul is one of the perceptions in the example mentioned (concerning man’s knowledge of his own existence, the existence of his soul), and the knowledge of the meaning of the soul is not intuitive. epistemology  225ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 22510/17/2006 4:40:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"226 knowledge is thought11. The most likely way of de\u0002ning knowledge is the statement: ‘Knowledge stands for an attribute through which the soul of him who possesses this attribute attains the discernment of some reality not per-ceivable by the senses in the soul, thus guarding himself against the sensi-bilia, at which he arrives in a way that does not leave open the possibility that it could be different from the manner in which it has arrived.’106 This includes the knowledge of asseveration and negation and of sim-ple (mufrad ) and compound. It excludes beliefs and guesses, inasmuch as the possibility that objects of belief or guesswork are present in the soul in a manner different from the manner in which they have arrived in the soul is not excluded with regard to the soul.It is positive (wujûdî ), and not negative (salbî ). If it were negative, its negation would be an asseveration, because a double negation is an as-severation, and if this were the case, it would not be possible to negate the knowledge of the non-existent which is impossible of existence, be-cause this would entail describing pure non-existence in an asseverative manner. This would be absurd.It may be said that even if this proves that knowledge is assevera-tive, it con\u0003icts with that which proves that it may be negative. Simple ignorance is contradictory to knowledge, and simple negation is not a negative matter. Otherwise, its negation would be an asseveration, as you have mentioned.107 If it were an asseveration, it would not be possible to negate ignorance of the non-existent which is impossible of existence, because it would entail establishing a description in an as-severative manner of the pure non-existent. This would be absurd. And if simple ignorance is asseverative, the knowledge contradictory to it is negative. We reply: It requires the assumption that simple ignorance is contradictory to knowledge. This is not so. It is contrary (muqâbil ) to it. Contraries are more general than contradictory (matters). From the fact that one of two contraries is asseverative, it does not necessarily follow that the other is negative. Thus, they may be found together in what is false (kadhib) through (bi-n-nisbah ilâ) what does not accept knowledge. If they were contradictory, they could not be found together in what is false.106 Cf. de\u0002nition D-5, above, p. 58.107 “You” in the plural, the usual form in kalâm discussions where the author wishes to indicate that he is dealing with various schools or with an opponent and the latter’s followers.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 22610/17/2006 4:40:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"12. It has been said that ‘knowledge is an attribute expressing the relationship between the knower and the object known.’108 This is de-batable. If it is assumed that relationship is non-existence (\u0002adam), the negation of relationship must be an asseveration. This requires the con-clusion that a negation of a relationship between pure non-existences requires the description of pure non-existence in an asseverative man-ner. This is absurd. If, on the other hand, it is assumed that relationship is existence (wujûd), it follows that relationship between the prior and the posterior can in both cases be described in an asseverative manner, although the one is non-existent. It would also require that relationship through contrariness (taqâbul) between negation and af\u0002rmation (îjâb) can in both cases be described in an asseverative manner, whereas nega-tion is pure non-existence. Now, if both assumptions are absurd, knowl-edge cannot be an attribute expressing a relationship.If the concept (ma\u0002nâ) of knowledge can be de\u0002ned, (knowledge) is truly real (\u00033\u0015%, muta\u0003aqqiq), as intelligent men generally agree. Only the Sophists differ in this respect. They will be discussed later on.”Al-Âmidî goes on to speak about the different kinds of knowledge. For him, they are three in number, as they were for his predecessors. The primeval knowledge of God does not come under consideration at this juncture, since this subject, the author states, will come up again in connection with the divine attributes, which is the normal proce-dure. The newly arising (\u0003âdith) knowledge consists of two kinds, nec-essary (\u000earûrî) knowledge and acquired (kasbî, muktasab) knowledge. In connection with the necessary knowledge, the most important problem is whether or not it can be gained also by means of rational specula-tion. For the Jahmîyah, he claims, all knowledge is speculative, and no necessity is involved. Such extreme views are naturally not acceptable to al-Âmidî. However, he cannot avoid drawing quite close to them by agreeing to the statement that necessary knowledge does exist but is attained through rational speculation.The acquired knowledge is closely allied to speculative knowledge. One of the problems here is whether or not there is such knowl-edge that can be present without rational speculation and deductive reasoning. Of the \u0002ve de\u0002nitions of acquired knowledge, the one 108 Cf. de\u0002nition A-14, above, p. 53. epistemology  227ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 22710/17/2006 4:40:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"228 knowledge is thoughtacceptable to al-Âmidî is the de\u0002nition he ascribes to al-Bâqillânî, which is also that of the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn, de\u0002ning this knowledge as the knowledge that is guaranteed by sound speculation. While agreeing to it, he \u0002nds it a bit obscure and proceeds to suggest some modi\u0002cation for greater precision.The nine subsections of the fourth section of the discussion of knowl-edge deal with the a\u0003kâm al-\u0002ilm, that is, the classi\u0002cation of the various aspects of epistemology. Al-Âmidî discusses here once more the atti-tude to be taken toward the problem of the relationship of necessary knowledge to rational speculation as well as the problem of whether it is permissible to relate a kind of necessary knowledge to another kind of speculative or necessary knowledge. Then, \u0002ve much debated points as to the relationship of knowledge and object known are elucidated. The eight subsection refers to the philosophical division of all knowledge into universals and particulars and to the suggested location in the hu-man body of the powers of perception. For the universals, it is the soul. For the particulars, the outward organs are the \u0002ve senses. The inner powers are also \u0002ve, all of them located in various parts of the brain. According to al-Âmidî, the more recent philosophers considered the soul the only percipient of both the universals and the particulars, with both the outward and the inner powers of the body being mere instru-ments for the soul’s activity. The ninth subsection, \u0002nally, considers the opposites of human knowledge. They are ignorance simple and com-pound, doubt, conjecture, neglect and forgetfulness, sleep, speculation (na\u0012ar, as it implies the absence of knowledge with respect to the object speculated about), and death.109 Traditional knowledge is not mentioned by al-Âmidî as a source of knowledge. It is clear that he feels strongly that wherever possible, the articles of the Muslim faith can and must be explained rationally without any reference to tradition.Al-Âmidî’s approach won the day, particularly in the east-ern part of the Muslim world, in Iran and India, where phi-losophy in the tradition of Ibn Sînâ and as-Suhrawardî al-maqtûl continued to retain its strong appeal. Hardly more than a century after al-Âmidî, the famous Persian theologian, \u0003A\rud-ad-dîn al-Îjî (d. 756/1355), compiled a handbook of speculative theology in the 109 Cf. the list of the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn, above, p. 218.

Everything here is neatly stated, paragraphed, and numbered in what had become the accepted “philosophical” school tra-dition. The author’s introduction (khu\u000fbah) comes right out with the cus-tomary presuppositions that were no longer questioned. Man is gifted with innate reason (\u0002aql gharîzî), necessary knowledge (\u0002ilm \u000earûrî), and the capability for speculation and deductive reasoning (na\u0012ar, istidlâl). His chief task is to re\u0003ect upon God’s creations, so as to attain knowledge of the existence of an eternal Maker. And again we hear that seeing that scholarly disciplines differ in value, the discipline possessing the greatest value for man deserves most to be studied. This discipline, of course, is speculative theology (\u0002ilm al-kalâm).The \u0002rst “station” (mawqif ) lays the groundwork by discussing the sources of knowledge. Philosophical tradition required al-Îjî to start out by describing the discipline under discussion according to the catego-ries that apply to it as well as any other scholarly discipline. They are de\u0002nition, object, use, rank, problems, and designation. Then, the opin-ions on “knowledge as such” are passed in review. Knowledge has been considered necessary, or not necessary and hard to de\u0002ne. Knowledge is attainable through rational speculation. The various de\u0002nitions at-tempted in this connection are enumerated and subjected to a searching critique. Then, the divisions of knowledge come under the scrutiny of the author. There are ta\u0015awwur and ta\u0015dîq, distinguished by the absence or the presence, respectively, of judgment (\u0003ukm). Newly arising (\u0003âdith) knowledge is divided into necessary and acquired (muktasab) knowledge. Both ta\u0015awwur and ta\u0015dîq are in part, necessary through instinct (wijdân). The school opinions that every knowledge is necessary, that ta\u0015awwur is not acquired, that the belief requiring asseveration of the existence and attributes of the Creator is necessary knowledge, and that every knowl-edge is derived from rational speculation are discussed.The goal of speculative theology is the establishment of necessary 110 The publication of van Ess, Erkenntnislehre, makes the following few remarks on al-Îjî’s work largely super\u0003uous, but I have decided to retain them in view of the impor-tance of the Mawâqif as a signi\u0002cant station in the history of theological “knowledge.” epistemology  229ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 22910/17/2006 4:40:10 PM"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"230 knowledge is thoughtknowledge (pl. \u0002ulûm \u000earûrîyah). All kinds of necessary knowledge may be divided into knowledge acquired instinctively (wijdâniyât), which is of little extent and consequence, and knowledge through sense perception (\u0003issîyât) and through intuition (badîhîyât). With regard to sense percep-tion and intuition as sources of knowledge, there are four different views. The majority recognizes both as sources of knowledge. Then there are those who disparage the role of sense perception, as was done by Plato, Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Galen. There are others who disparage the role of intuition. Some, \u0002nally, such as the Sophists and I-do-not-knowers (lâ-adrîyah), deny that either, or anything else for that matter, can provide knowledge.Expectedly, the discussion continues with the discussion of ra-tional speculation as the means to attain the desired goal. Rational speculation is de\u0002ned and described as either sound or wrong. The former provides knowledge. However, there are dissenters. Thus, the Sumanîyah, of Indian provenience, deny categorically that specula-tion can lead to knowledge. The “geometricians” (muhandisûn) are of the opinion that rational speculation can lead only to scienti\u0002c math-ematical knowledge (handasîyât), but not to metaphysical knowledge.111 In this respect, the most it can achieve is the formulation of guesses and opinions that are relatively speaking more likely. And the “heretics” (malâ\u0003idah, referring to the Ismâ\u0003îlî Shî\u0003ah) deny that speculation with-out a teacher or guide (mu\u0002allim, imâm) can lead to the knowledge of God. This is followed by a discussion of the methods by which knowl-edge can be attained through rational speculation, and of the condi-tions necessary for the exercise of such speculation. There is general agreement that rational speculation as a means to attain knowledge 111 The Sumanîyah and the muhandisûn are also cited by the \u0003Allâmah al-\u0004illî, Anwâr al-malakût, 5, who refers to the latter as “a group of the ancients.” They assume alleg-edly that only observation by the senses can produce knowledge. Cf. also, for instance, al-Ghazzâlî, Musta\u0015fâ, I, 85; a\t-âbûnî, Bidâyah, in the Bursa Ms. Haraççi 1296, fol. 3b; Fakhr-ad-dîn ar-Râzi, Mu\u0003a\u0015\u0015al, who apparently does not mention the Sumanîyah by name, but cf.

It is a duty either on the basis of reason, as maintained by the Mu\u0003tazilah, or on the basis of tradition (sam\u0002\u0005), as argued by al-Îjî himself. In fact, it is the \u0002rst duty of every responsible Muslim. After the discussion of three more problems concerning the application of rational speculation, analogical reasoning is brie\u0003y mentioned as the successful method of rational speculation. Only very brie\u0003y is the role of traditional evidence in achieving knowl-edge touched upon. It is considered very restricted, and highly disputed as to its effectiveness in intellectual matters.In the following three “stations,” al-Îjî continues his epistemological re\u0003ections with the customary survey of the situation as regards the objects of knowledge. The remaining two “stations”—followed by a brief concluding section, principally on the various Muslim sects—deal with metaphysics, God and His attributes, and with traditional religion, prophecy, resurrection, faith and unbelief, and the imâmate. They cover only two-\u0002fths of the entire work. This is not without signi\u0002cance. The theological purpose of kalâm is always present, and it constitutes, of course, the raison d’être for the labors of the author. But it has here been pushed into the background by the intense interest of al-Îjî and his environment in the problem of knowledge. On the other hand, the premises posited in connection with the theological purpose have gained a position of undisputed acceptance. This fact \u0002nds its principal expression in the role attributed to “necessary knowledge” which, as we have seen, has taken the place of “knowledge” as such in the khu\u000fbah of the Mawâqif. Theology, it turns out, is forever based upon “knowledge,” but knowledge has been tailored to \u0002t the needs of theology.* * *Following the theologians, the writers on “the principles of jurisprudence” also came to adopt an epistemological introduction in their works. In their case, this was a slower process than the corresponding development in theology, and for good reasons. Theology was inspired, as we have seen, by precedents outside Islam. Moreover, unlike jurisprudence, it was not primarily directed toward action and the practical needs of society. Its fundamental concern was with metaphysical data, and it aimed at achieving insight and inner certainty (which is not to deny, of course, the epistemology  231ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 23110/17/2006 4:40:11 PM"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"232 knowledge is thoughtpractical consequences inherent in the work of the theologians). Concerned as it was with practical affairs, jurisprudence might have managed to stay away from any theoretical speculation about knowl-edge to a large extent, if not entirely. However, this was not the course it was to take. Muslim jurisprudence started out as “knowledge” (\u0002ilm). The fact that the word employed for jurisprudence ( \u0002qh) was indeed one of the general terms in Arabic indicating mental activity and assumed its restricted technical meaning only in Islam continued to give some linguistic support to the identi\u0002cation of jurisprudence with knowledge. Just as the traditionists considered \u0002ilm pure and simple to mean the kind of knowledge that formed the subject of their particular discipline, the jurists claimed \u0002ilm by preference to be legal knowledge, although they happened to be somewhat less successful than the traditionists in this endeavor.112Already ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î’s Risâlah shows a deep concern not only with what constitutes legal knowledge and demarcates its extent but also with the more demanding and searching subject of how legal knowledge can be obtained and its correctness and propriety explained and justi\u0002ed.113 It may, however, be noted that his brief discussion of the sources of knowl-edge still remains buried within the context of the work. It is not given the prominent position in the beginning which would have proclaimed it to be the basis for the entire subsequent discussion. Moreover, it is fully obvious that ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î rejected the possibility of, and certainly did not feel compelled to adduce, logical reasoning in order to establish the general character of knowledge and to show how this might affect the sources of legal knowledge. For the jurist, the close observation of linguistic usage is another indispensable tool for \u0002nding legal knowledge and plays a much larger role than it does for the theologian. Thus, it is not surprising that ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î already includes repeated references to the importance of an accurate knowledge of the Arabic language for those who wish to understand the processes leading to the formation of the law.The state of affairs reached by ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î and observable in his famous Risâlah underwent a marked change soon after his time. However, the results of this change become tangible for us 112 Cf. also below, pp. 243 ff.113 Cf. ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î, Risâlah, trans. Khadduri, 81, 289 f.

The course taken by the jurists con-cerned with the principles of jurisprudence can be surmised with rea-sonable certainty. Ra\by “opinion,” ijtihâd “independent judgment,” and qiyâs “analogical reasoning”—all three terms, and, in particular, ijtihâd and qiyâs, originally being synonyms114—were, as J. Schacht has shown, the basic source of legal knowledge for early Islam. The task of de\u0002n-ing their role in jurisprudence and of restricting this role to a greater or lesser extent was undertaken by the legal schools which achieved pre-dominance with the ninth century. Mu\u0003tazilah theologians who were concerned with the law naturally stressed the paramount and nearly exclusive importance of analogical reasoning and the methodology, out of which it grew, which was na\u0012ar “rational speculation.”115 Their at-titude was fought by their dogmatic opponents in their concern with the law with all the means at their disposal. However, modi\u0002ed and deprived of its uncompromising insistence upon reason, it was taken up by subsequent “Ash\u0003arite” theologians, and it thus managed to get into the mainstream of Muslim legal thought. As al-Âmidî saw quite cor-rectly in retrospect, one of the disciplines that nourished the science of the principles of jurisprudence was the \u0002ilm al-kalâm.116 The quarrel with the Mu\u0003tazilah/Mutakallimûn resulted in the urgent necessity for jurists to give attention to the problems of knowledge, and, ultimately, it led to the unshakable habit of stating their attitude toward the sources of knowledge in the philosophical sense and doing so at the very outset of their discussion. The fact that qiyâs also served as a central term in for-mal logic as the Arabic term rendering Greek syllogismos apparently had no direct bearing on the connection of legal theory with epistemology. However, another avenue leading jurists to the discussion of the prob-lems of the attainment of certainty in knowledge was opened up to them by the science of \u0003adîth. For \u0003adîth scholars, the requirements governing the transmission of traditions so as to give suf\u0002cient assurance of their truthfulness were a matter of constant concern.117 The writers on the principles of jurisprudence took over this discussion as far as was needed for their purposes, but it stayed within the treatment of the Prophet’s114 Cf. ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î, Risâlah, trans.

It did not push itself forward to the head of the exposition as did the kalâm-derived epistemology.The development outlined makes it unlikely, and indeed impos-sible, that works on the principles of jurisprudence could have had in-troductions dealing with “knowledge” before such introductions had made their appearance in works on speculative theology. The relevant legal material that has been preserved is large and has not yet been adequately studied. When it becomes available, much of what has been stated here as based upon inference may be con\u0002rmed—or refuted. Presently, however, it would seem probable that legal authors did not get around to writing such introductions before well into the tenth cen-tury. Even thereafter, these introductions were not as standardized in form and contents is were their counterparts in works on speculative theology, and they seem always brief in proportion to the usually mas-sive size of the work of which they form part. They differ considerably in size, and their size would seem to be a measure of the weight they were intended to carry. Al-Ghazzâlî went so far as to state expressly that his introductory remarks on intellectual perception according to the ele-ments of logic at the beginning of the Musta\u0015fâ could be safely omitted by copyists who wished to do so, because they applied to all scholarly disciplines in general and were not restricted in their application to the principles of jurisprudence.118Ibn \u0004azm’s119 principal motive as an author of works on ju-risprudence and theology was the refutation, often undertaken in very bitter terms, of the Ash\u0003arites and, in their forefront, al-Bâqillâni. As is well known, Ibn \u0004azm was opposed in principle to the use of qiyâs as a source of law. But he was also convinced of the validity of evidence resulting from the intellect and deductive reasoning, and he believed in innate, necessary knowledge: “We 118 Cf. al-Ghazzâlî, Musta\u0015fâ, I, 7. 119 Judge \u0003Abd-al-Jabbâr’s \u0002Umad on the principles of jurisprudence (cf.

This power brings into being the knowledge (ma\u0002rifah) of truth as distinguished from untruth.”123 Ibn \u0004azm subjects to his critique the four views concern-ing the sources of knowledge, that is, that all knowledge is derived 1. from inspiration (ilhâm), or 2. from the teachings of a religious leader (imâm), or 3. from transmitted information (khabar), or 4. through a blind trust in tradition (taqlid). These do not admit the possibility of evidence gained through reasoning, which Ibn \u0004azm upholds.124 On the origin of language, he does not want to commit himself, but he tends toward the view that the single original language of mankind, from which all other languages were derived, owes its development not to convention but to divine teaching (tawqîf ). Very sensibly, he argues against those who feel that there are qualitative differences between the various languages, and who claim that theirs is the best (af\u000eal ) language.125 The subject 120 Cf.

He discusses terms such as i\u0002tiqâd “belief,” burhân “proof,” dalîl “evidence,” \u0015idq and kadhib “truth/falsehood,” \u0003aqq and bâ\u000fil “true/untrue,” jahl “ignorance” (that is, “the absence of the reality of knowl-edge from the soul”), \u0002aql “intellect,” as well as ma\u0002lûm “known, object of knowledge.” Ma\u0002lûm includes as necessarily certain knowledge what is known through well attested tradition from the Prophet, or what is agreed upon by all Muslim scholars as going back to the Prophet, or what is transmitted by one reliable authority on the authority of other reliable scholars going back to the Prophet.128 The explanation of tech-nical terms is followed by an elaboration of the precise meanings of the particles of speech, as this is of supreme importance in many cases for \u0002nding the law.129Al-Ghazzâlî expectedly takes a rather different approach in the preliminaries of his standard work on the principles of jurispru-dence, the Musta\u0015fâ. His preface (khu\u000fbah) sets the tone with a long paean on knowledge. The intellect comes \u0002rst, and knowledge fol-lows it. However, knowledge clearly enjoys here much greater esteem and deserves particularly to be stressed in connection with juris-prudence: “Praised be God,” al-Ghazzâlî starts out, “who made the intellect the most desirable of treasures, and knowledge the most prof-itable of merchandise, the noblest of high glories, the most honored 126 As in Ibn \u0004azm, Taqrîb, 19.127 Cf. also Ibn \u0004azm, I\u0003kâm, I, 65.128 Cf.

Rosenthal, III, 25 ff.The Kitâb al-Burhân fî u\u0015ûl al-\u0002qh by the Imâm al-\u0004aramayn is another of the works on the principles of jurisprudence which might help to round out the picture presented here, if it were preserved, but it seems that it has not yet been recovered.ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 23610/17/2006 4:40:12 PM"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"of effective and praiseworthy accomplishments, and the most lauded result of everything, so that through its asseveration pens and inkwells have been ennobled, through its study prayer niches and pulpits have been adorned, through the tracing of it pages and fascicles have been embellished, through its nobility lesser men have gained precedence over bigger men, through its splendor secrets and hidden things have been illumined, through its lights hearts and eyes have been \u0002lled with light, in its brilliance the sun’s shining brilliance has assumed insigni\u0002cance for the revolving sphere, and in its inner light the outward light of eyes and glances has become puny, so that as a result through its brilliance the armies of the hearts and minds have been enabled to delve into the deepest abysses of obscurities, even though the eyes were too weak for them and they were thickly covered by veils and curtains.” Obedience to God consists of knowledge and intelligence. In this respect, knowledge is again to be rated higher than the intellect. There are three kinds of scholarly disciplines (\u0002ulûm), namely, 1. those that are purely intellectual, 2. those that are purely traditional, and 3. those of the highest type, that is, those consisting of a combination of intellect and tradition, opinion and religious law. It is to the last mentioned category that the science of the principles of jurisprudence belongs. The introduction of the Musta\u0015fâ deals with epistemology, the attainment of speculative knowl-edge through de\u0002nition and proof. It features a theoretical discussion of de\u0002nition and its application to such terms as de\u0002nition itself and knowl-edge, followed by a discussion of the theory of logical proof. There are no extended lists of de\u0002ned terms nor any detailed speculation about language in the manner of Ibn \u0004azm. Al-Ghazzâlî later on investigates the problem of the derivation of knowledge from well attested tradition. Such knowledge, he says, was denied by the Sumanîyah, while among the Mu\u0003tazilah, Abû l-Qâsim al-Ka\u0003bî al-Balkhî considered it as derived in fact from rational speculation.130Fakhr-ad-dîn ar-Râzî’s in\u0003uential Ma\u0003\u0015ûl on the principles of jurisprudence131 \u0002rst de\u0002nes in some detail the meaning of \u0002qh.

There are various kinds of knowledge. We have knowledge derived from the \u0002ve senses and knowledge derived from feelings such as pleasure and pain (wijdânîyât), which are related kinds of knowledge. We have knowledge through intuition and knowl-edge through rational speculation. They fall into another category. Then there is knowledge derived from a combination of sense perception and reason. This knowledge is also of two kinds. There is knowledge derived from a tradition based on information transmitted by many authori-ties (mutawâtirât) which relies upon a combination of hearing (sam\u0002, oral transmission) and reason, and there is knowledge based upon experi-ence and conjecture (mujarrabât and \u0003adsîyât) which relies upon a com-bination of reason and the other four senses. After knowledge, there come blind belief (i\u0002tiqâd al-muqallid), ignorance, doubt, guesswork, and estimation (wahm). As usual, more space is required for the subsequent explanation of rational speculation and evidence (dalîl/amârah). The obligatory chapter on language, which again is not very detailed, in-cludes a remarkably clear exposition of the theory of the social origin of language as a means of communicating individual needs by members of a group.Al-Âmidî, who was born only a few years after Fakhr-ad-dîn ar-Râzî, wrote not only the important work on theology discussed before but also an impressive manual of the principles of jurisprudence, entitled al-I\u0003kâm, or I\u0003kâm al-\u0003ukkâm, fî usûl al-a\u0003kâm. Like ar-Râzî, he does not follow al-Ghazzâlî’s example with respect to the inclusion of a \u0003owery khu\u000fbah with its popularizing praise of knowledge. For his starting point, he chooses the Aristotelian dissection of the subject matter of any given scholarly discipline. The items to be clari\u0002ed are the meaning (ma\u0002nâ) of the subject by means of de\u0002nition (\u0003add and rasm), its object, its end, its problems and conditions that bear investigation, and its foundations and basic principles on which to build (istimdâd ). The verbal de\u0002nition of \u0002qh as simply meaning “knowledge” does not appear to be quite acceptable to the author. It seems that he on his part prefers that of “understanding” ( fahm) (Fakhr-ad-dîn ar-Râzî had more fancifully expressed himself to the effect that the lexical meaning of \u0002qh was to be de\u0002ned as “a notion expressing the purpose of the speaker by his speech”).

A separate chapter is devoted by al-Âmidî to each of them. The briefest chapter is the one discussing the foundation de-rived from theology. De\u0002nitions only of evidence, rational speculation, knowledge, and guesswork are said to be needed, and they are therefore presented. The discussion of language, and its origin is here somewhat more extensive but remains comparatively concise. Consideration of the questions whether a well attested tradition can provide knowledge and whether it could generate, knowledge comes as usual later in con-nection with the discussion of traditional information.132Innumerable lawyers, the political leaders of the Muslim community everywhere, were trained for their profession by the study of works of the kind described. They were thus thoroughly imbued with the idea that in their legal work, they were engaged in the application of “knowl-edge”. Theirs was a particular knowledge evolved from certain sources according to certain rules. However, it was by no means fundamentally different from what was implied in the basic understanding of the con-cept of knowledge. It was their particular task to evaluate human ac-tions, and this they were trained to do according to the conformity or lack of conformity shown by those actions to a “knowledge” previously acquired in some sort of rational manner.As medieval Muslims themselves might have put it, theology and law were the twin pillars of Islam responsible for the welfare of the Muslim community in the other world as well as in this. As we might say, they were the determinants of a social structure distinguishing Muslim soci-ety from other societies. What deserves to be stressed is that both were seen basically as “knowledge”, and they were labeled “knowledge” by preference. The “knowers” (\u0002ulamâ\b\u0005), \u0002rst in the view of the representa-tives of theology and law but later on for the generality of Muslims, were, speci\u0002cally, the members of the learned classes that controlled all religious life and the civilian aspects of political life. But it was not merely factual knowledge. It was also knowledge resting, or so it was believed, on a scienti\u0002cally demonstrable epistemological basis.132 Cf. al-Âmidî, I\u0003kâm, I, 151, 156. epistemology  239ROSENTHAL-f9_194-239.indd 23910/17/2006 4:40:13 PM"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTKNOWLEDGE IS SOCIETY(Education)1. \u0002Ilm-\u0002Amal-Adab: Knowledge, Action, General EducationInformation is the cement that holds together any human society, and a continuous process of education is necessary to assure its preservation and extension. The goal is always identical, but the stages may be marked by a different terminology, and thereby the value system sustaining a given society on its course is altered in appearance and reality. The speci\u0002c problem confronting us here is the degree to which a generalizing abstraction such as “knowledge” has dominated the verbalization of the human striving for improvement through learning and education in Islam. As we have seen, the term “knowledge” itself represents different notions and values. Modern discussions of what type of knowledge and what kind of education are preferable clearly show that the knowledge desired by some may mean ignorance and stagnation for others. However, the complexion of a society cannot fail to impress its historian as different, if all its intellectual efforts and, indeed, all its educational efforts constantly stress the importance of the term “knowledge” and the terms “teaching” and “learning” which, among the languages of Muslim peoples, the linguistic structure of Arabic at least makes almost one and the same thing as knowledge, and if there is nothing, neither morality, nor piety, nor action, nor any other possible societal value that enjoys the same degree of exposure as is reserved to “knowledge.” For medieval Muslim civilization, we have to rely upon the evidence of the preserved literature. Its abundance and variety make it virtually certain that the glori\u0002cation of knowledge expressed by it extended to all phases of life and educational activity and to all classes of the population. It is hard to conceive of any place, no matter how remote, where there might have existed anyone, no matter how humble and uneducated, who was not \u0002lled with awe when he heard the word “knowledge.” And it was generally recognized that any genuine betterment of an individual’s standing in society depended on his share of knowledge, in preference to the uncertain avenues ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 24010/17/2006 5:16:13 PM"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"of birth, power, and wealth, or as yet unverbalized values such as individual identity, usefulness to society, and the like.There is pleasure (ladhdhah) in knowledge for the person who possesses knowledge.1 According to Aristotle, the characteristic pleasure of man, the one he does not share with all other animals, is the pleasure of knowledge (ladhdhat al-ma\u0002rifah).2 A littérateur and philologian such as Abû Hilâl al-\u0003Askarî tells us how deeply he felt this pleasure of knowledge, which comes after the long process of learning, and he puts his feeling into verse: “Since we have come to know about the pleasure of knowledge, neither the sweet nor the tasty pleases us any more.”3 Since knowledge secures access to happiness in both this world and the next, it is the greatest of pleasures, just as ignorance is the greatest of pains.4 In fact, one who has tasted the pleasure of knowledge would never think of \u0002nding pleasure in anything else.5 A veritable physical love (\u0002ishq) can be felt for knowledge. This is stated in a work on love by Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzîyah in the \u0002rst half of the fourteenth century.6 The lovers of knowledge feel a stronger attraction and infatuation than do lovers for their beloved, and even the most beautiful human form may not be capable to divert many a lover of knowledge from his one true love. Scholars cannot be tempted into giving up their dedicated search for knowledge, even if strenuous study affects their health. Half a century before Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzîyah, al-An\târî expressed what was also in the mind of the later scholar, namely, that the love of knowledge—al-An\târî uses the less sensual term ma\u0003abbah—is part of man’s innate love of any kind of inner perfection. In the Qur\u0002ân, it is said that every group is pleased with 1 Cf. al-Ghazzâlî, Mîzân al-\u0002amal, 191.2 Cf.

On the Greek side, cf., for instance, Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1174b21; Metaphysics 1072b24. The Mahâbhârata also speaks of knowledge as the only pleasure, or rather, as something that makes pleasure super\u0003uous, cf. L.

In a more restricted sense, knowledge is one of the pleasures of this world. It becomes useful for the other world, only if it is acted upon, cf. al-Kha\u0006îb al-Baghdâdî, Iqti\u000eâ\b, 169.

However, the nobler a given object of knowledge is, the greater is the pleasure caused by his knowledge in the person who attains it. Nobody is entirely devoid of some pleasure caused by some knowledge. A child feels pleasure through his acquaintance with different games and is happy, if he is called ef\u0002cient in those games and described as excelling his friends by his skill in them. The soul of a person who knows a craft rejoices at the realization that he alone knows it. Even a chess player is happy with his knowledge of chess.

Only a few special aspects may be chosen here for discussion. It was only natural for an author to stress, however brie\u0003y, his conviction that he was making a contribution to knowledge, and this he did at the beginning of his work. More important, there was a rather general desire to present one’s own particular discipline as the knowledge. This re\u0003ects in part the fact that the word \u0002ilm also designated the individual scholarly discipline. Thus, while speaking of his own discipline, a scholar could very well refer to it by the abbreviated designation of “the discipline” (al-\u0002ilm). However, scholars were also inclined to consider the subject they cultivated the only true knowledge. The religious history of \u0002ilm in Islam constituted an especially strong challenge in this direction. As we have seen, the religious disciplines were in the forefront of those attempting to restrict the term “knowledge” to their own concerns. The device employed frequently was a bipartition of knowledge, with one part favoring a particular branch of learning, and the other being branded as useless, on the model of the Prophetical tradition stating that “Knowledge is of two kinds (lit., two knowledges), a knowledge in the heart and a knowledge on the tongue; the knowledge of the heart is the useful knowledge, while the knowledge of the tongue is God’s argument against His servants.”11 Great fame and in\u0003uence attached to a remark by ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î that “knowledge is of two kinds, the knowledge of religion and the knowledge of this world.” This was explained, apparently not by ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î himself, as referring to jurisprudence as the knowledge that goes with religion, and to medicine as the knowledge that goes with this world. “Every-10 Cf. al-An\târî, Mashâriq anwâr al-qulûb, ed.

Abû \u0003Uthmân al-Maghribî (d. 373/983–84) felt no hesitation to praise ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î for what must have been very far from the latter’s mind, namely, that “the knowledge of religions” was the knowledge of the true realities and of gnostic insight (al-\u0003aqâ\u0002iq wa-l-ma\u0002ârif ), while “the knowledge of the bodies” was the knowledge of the various ways of political (?) guidance, ascetic training, and mystic exercise (as-siyâsât wa-r-riyâ\u000eât wa-l-mujâhadât).13 Other, earlier ûfîs had similarly appropriated al-\u0002ilm for mysticism by stating, as al-Junayd is supposed to have done, that “knowledge is of two kinds, the knowledge of extension (bas\u000f) from the oneness of the One to the very end of multiplicity, and the knowledge of contraction (qab\u000e) from multiplicity to (that) oneness.” For Ruwaym (d. 303/915–16), the two kinds of knowledge were “rational and traditional, the rational knowledge being eternal, and the traditional knowledge being time-bound; the rational knowledge being the root, and the traditional knowledge being the branch.” For Abû l-\u0003Abbâs Ibn \u0003A\u0006â\u0002 (d. 309/921–22, or 311), they were, in turn, “clari\u0002cation and obfuscation, the former belonging to the hearts, and the latter belonging to the tongues.” Abû Sa\u0003îd al-Kharrâz had already progressed from two to three kinds of knowledge, “the knowledge of technical skills (\u0015inâ\u0002ât) applicable to the various species of compound objects, the knowledge of words (laf\u0012) applicable to the composition of expressions, and the knowledge of management (tadbîr) applicable to the various kinds of political guidance (siyâsât).”14In his work on the literary \u0002xation of knowledge (Taqyîd al-\u0002ilm), the Kha\u0006îb al-Baghdâdî leaves no doubt that although the “knowledge” of the work’s title is supposed to include all worthwhile religious knowledge, his intention was to equate it with the science of the Prophetical traditions. The commonly accepted idea that the various branches of knowledge differed in importance and value As an example of the rather typical narrow-minded approach to the subject of useful versus useless knowledge, one may compare Ibn Rajab’s Fa\u000el \u0002ilm as-salaf.12 Cf.

In this context, siyâsât would seem to refer to individual “management,” training and self-control. However, in al-Kharrâz’ statement cited below, it appears to refer to group control.14 The preceding four statements are to be found in Abû \u0004ayyân at-Taw\bîdî, Ba\u0015â\bir, ed.

When Abû l-Layth as-Samarqandî in the tenth century spoke of the excellence of knowledge, he came out right away with the statement that the knowledge he had in mind was jurisprudence. “Knowledge is good, and the best and most important knowledge after the knowledge about God and God’s oneness is jurisprudence.”15 Some room had to be made for the knowledge of the Prophetical traditions, therefore, “knowledge is where there is the expression, ‘he transmitted to us’; everything else is the whispering of devils.” And “all the sciences except the Qur\u0002ân and the traditions are heresy.”16Scholars in the \u0002eld of non-religious sciences were obviously not in a position to be as outspoken in their attempts to monopolize “knowledge” for their particular endeavors. When a representative of adab used the device of the two kinds of knowledge, he could praise the \u0002ilm al-adab as serving the important purpose of “cleansing and polishing the hearts,” yet, he had to acknowledge that preference was due to the other knowledge, the knowledge that prepared a person for his salvation in the other world.17 Esoteric disciplines such as alchemy claimed to be “the craft” (a\u0015-\u0015an\u0002ah), and also “the science” (al-\u0002ilm), as in the title of a work in the Jâbir corpus, “On Con\u0002dence in the Soundness of the Science.”18 We also \u0002nd, for instance, Fakhr-ad-dîn ar-Râzî in the beginning of his commentary on Ibn Sînâ’s Ishârât burst into the customary praise of knowledge: “All hearts agree, and all minds concur that knowledge is the most excellent happiness and the most perfect perfection and degree, and that the men of knowledge are the most distinguished and most outstanding of men.” Then, with the help of the expression “especially,” he inferred that this applied in particular to the true philosophical sciences, which therefore alone constituted real, worthwhile knowledge.19 However, the non-15 A verse ascribed to ash-Shâ\u0002\u0003î admits as \u0002ilm only the Qur\u0002ân, the \u0003adîth, and jurisprudence, while all the rest is Satanic twaddle, cf. as-Subkî, \u0010abaqât ash-Shâ\u0002\u0002îyah, I, 157.

A \u0003adîth of the Prophet that “it is charity (\u0015adaqah) to learn (\u0002-l-m), to act accordingly, and to teach,” provoked the comment that here knowledge was mentioned before action.21 An exact quotation of Matthew 5:19 (poiêsêi kai didaxêi) as a \u0003adîth in at-Tirmidhî speaks of “acting and teaching” in this sequence,22 but elsewhere, it appears in the form of “studies and knows and acts.”23 \u0002Ilm and \u0002amal became a standard combination whose effectiveness was greatly enhanced by the similarity of the two words in sound and in their written forms. It is impossible to escape its impact in any work that touches even remotely upon individual or societal ethics in Islam.The relationship of action and thought had long been a subject of intense speculation. Euripides, for instance, considered it the greatest evil to know the good but make no use of it, and Muslim scholars were familiar with the translation of his verse.24 In the Greek tradition, the relationship was also discussed under the 20 For the position of \u0003ikmah “wisdom” in connection with action, see above, pp. 38 f.21 Cf.

In this sense, Muslim thinkers such as Abû \u0004ayyân at-Taw\bîdî made statements to the effect that “Action (\u0002\u0002l ) is the source of knowledge.”26 His contemporary, al-\u0003Âmirî, maintained that knowledge stood in the same relationship to action as cause to the thing caused, or beginning to end,27 and he also put it this way: “Knowledge is the beginning ( fâti\u0003ah) of action, and action is the end (tamâm, here = energeia, rather than entelecheia) of knowledge; a beginning without an end is futile, and an end without a beginning is absurd.”28 In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, it was faith versus good deeds. A Church Father, however, spoke of deeds following upon knowledge (gnôsis), as the body is followed by its shadow.29 Gnosticism saw man’s nature revealed in his praxis and his gnôsis.30In Islam, as we have seen, “faith” was originally equated with “knowledge,” and the most prominent and decisive element in the \u0002ilm-\u0002amal confrontation remained the Prophet’s view of the 25 Cf. Snell, Die Ausdrücke für den Begriff des Wissens, 19, n. 3. For the Stoics, phronêsis meant information about correct action, according to M. Pohlenz, Die Stoa, I, 202 (Göttingen 1948–49).26 As quoted by Ibn al-Ma\u0006rân, Bustân al-a\u000fibbâ\b, near the end (Ms. Army Medical Library).27 Cf. al-\u0003Âmirî, I\u0002lâm, 125.28 As quoted in the Bodleian Ms. or Marsh 539, fol. 124a. The \u0002rst half of the statement occurs also in al-\u0003Âmirî, I\u0002lâm, 78, with the substitution of mabda\b for fâti\u0003ah, and the continuation: “Excellent knowledge (\u0002ulûm) is desired only for the sake of good actions.” For wisdom as the combination of \u0002ilm and \u0002amal, cf. above, pp. 38 f., and, for instance, al-Mubashshir, 33 (Homer): “Wisdom means that the form of knowledge is attained through action.”29 Clement, as cited by Antonius Melissa, 933 f.30 Cf. Böhlig and Labib.

(The simile of the two wings is applied in Arabic to hearing and seeing, cf. al-\u0004u\trî, Zahr al-âdâb, III, 115 [Cairo 1316, in the margin of Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002lqd]). In our time, a utilitarian, action-directed view of knowledge is held by some, such as V. G. Childe, Society and Knowledge, 4 (New York 1956): “To deserve the name, I contend, knowledge must be communicable and in that sense public and also useful, I mean, capable of being translated into successful action.” This sounds like a greatly impoverished version of attitudes encountered frequently here as Islamic.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 24710/17/2006 5:16:14 PM"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"248 knowledge is societynecessary relationship of religious knowledge with good deeds and proper action. As the process of classifying the entire gamut of human actions in terms of religious obligations went under way, it was only natural for “actions” to be equated with religious duties such as prayer, charity, and so on. When religious scholars later on contrasted \u0002ilm and \u0002amal, they often seem to have had in mind the actions covered by the Muslim religious commitment. The Kha\u0006îb al-Baghdâdî is particularly emphatic in his insistence upon the necessity of action in connection with knowledge in his instructive collection of statements entitled “Knowledge Requires Action.”31 He sees the greatest drawback of the disciplines he esteems most, that is, Qur\u0002ân reading, \u0003adîth, and grammar/philology, in the temptation to turn their back on action to which scholars learned in these disciplines are unavoidably exposed. The Kha\u0006îb seems to favor action as the only possible way “to lay in provisions for the Last Day” and to achieve salvation. Many of his strongest statements in favor of action go back to famous ûfîs, for whom action was important, as they naturally esteemed it primarily as referring to the non-contemplative aspects of the mystic discipline. In the view of the philosophers in the Hellenistic tradition, on the other hand, action was often understood as the effort that had to be made in order to achieve receptivity for pure knowledge by cleansing oneself from all the impurities of man’s lower desires. The \u0002nal synthesis of the philosophical and the Judeo-Christian-Gnostic traditions found expression in two statements contained in al-Ghazzâlî’s Mîzân al-\u0002amal: \u0002Ilm and \u0002amal are the preparation for the other world, and the only way to happiness, the real goal of philosophy, is through the combination of \u0002ilm with \u0002amal.32It can be asserted with considerable assurance that in the Muslim view, knowledge by and large ranks higher than action.33 The entire history of knowledge in Islam indicates this to be the case. The higher estimation of knowledge is, for instance, expressed in the constantly cited Prophetical tradition showing preference for the man who knows (\u0002âlim) as against the pious worshiper who ful\u0002lls all the religious duties (\u0002âbid). It may not be without interest 31 Cf. al-Kha\u0006\u0007b al al-Baghdâdî, Iqti\u000eâ\b, which covers about seventy-\u0002ve pages.32 Cf. al-Ghazzâlî, Mîzân al-\u0002amal, 180, 193 f., 328. The ûfî, Bishr al-\u0004âfî even went so far as to claim identity for \u0002ilm and \u0002amal (wa-l-\u0002ilm huwa al-\u0002amal), cf. Abû Nu\u0003aym, \tilyah, VIII, 340 f.33 Cf. also G.

In connection with it, \u0002ve reasons are given for the superiority of knowledge: 1. Knowledge without action is an action,35 whereas action without knowledge is not an action; 2. knowledge without action may be useful, whereas action without knowledge is not useful; 3. knowledge is necessary, and action follows it like a lamp (which is as necessary as is knowledge, if there is to be light, or, like as a shadow follows the light of a lamp?); 4. scholars hold the same rank as the prophets; and 5. knowledge comes from God, whereas action comes from human beings.36The basic position of \u0002ilm as compared to \u0002amal is reiterated on every possible occasion. A particularly appropriate and effective vehicle for accomplishing this purpose was the wisdom literature of Hellenistic inspiration. It attributes, for instance, these sayings to Hippocrates: “Knowledge is the spirit, and action is the body. Knowledge is the root, and action is the branch. Knowledge is the father, and action is the child. Action came about because there was knowledge. Knowledge did not come about because there was action.” And again: “Action is the servant of knowledge, and knowledge is an end. Knowledge goes out (itself to do its own) foraging. Action is sent.”37 An unnamed philosopher said: “The intellect is the tree whose root is knowledge, whose branch is action, and whose fruit is the law (sunnah).”38 For al-Ghazzâlî, knowledge was indeed “the root of roots,” for “action can take on form ( yuta\u0015awwar) only through knowledge of the manner in which the action is to be undertaken,” and there is also some knowledge, 34 Cf. above, p. 184.35 Not to be corrected to “knowledge.”36 From the adab work of a certain Ma\bmûd b.

Plato is supposed to have advised those who “miss the path of knowledge” that they “should not miss the path of proper action or the avoidance of evil deeds, as they would thereby stand in the shadow of the master of the world.”40 Nothing more is meant here than the obvious fact that not everybody possesses scholarly ability. There are numerous human beings who act without knowledge, but they are no better than animals. Their actions are habitual and instinctive. There can be no useful, human action without knowledge.Conversely, the general assumption was that there could be no useful knowledge without the existence of action resulting from it. Purely intellectual and inspirational knowledge not immediately connected with action might still be useful, because, it makes necessary the action which assures bliss in the other world, the ful\u0002llment of the obligations of the religious law. We hear a good deal about extremist groups among the Shî\u0003ah and among ûfîs who allegedly thought it possible to dispense with action, because they were in the possession of knowledge or of gnosis. Occasionally, reference is made in the literature to obscure, and possibly non-existent, minor sects such as the one called Fikrîyah “Re\u0003ectionists.” They are supposed to have championed the view that persons who study in order to acquire knowledge, and devote themselves to re\u0003ecting upon the knowledge acquired are thereby freed of action and of fear. Everybody else is obliged to comply with all their wishes and desires. They have a partner’s share in the property of all the people of the world who commit a crime if they refuse them anything.41 In all such cases the “action” envisaged concerns 39 Cf. al-Ghazzâlî, Mîzan al-\u0002amal, 328.40 Cf. al-Mubashshir, 167.41 Cf. \u0003Uthmân b. \u0003Abdallâh al-\u0003Irâqî, al-Firaq al-muftariqah, ed.

In \u0004amîd-ad-dîn al-Kirmânî’s treatment of Fâ\u0006imid-Ismâ\u0003ilî religious philosophy, “faith” is a combination of “worship through knowledge” (al-\u0002ibâdah bi-l-\u0002ilm or al-\u0002ibâdah al-\u0002ilmîyah) and “worship through action” (al-\u0002ibâdah bi-l-\u0002amal or al-\u0002ibâdah al-\u0002amalîyah). This is the leitmotif of his Râ\u0003at al-\u0002aql, cf., for instance, 30, 64, 68, 122, 248, 319 ff. On p. 154, he characterizes the “people of faith” as those who worship through knowledge as well as action, the “people of the \u0012âhir” as those who worship only through action, and the “people of the bâ\u000fin” as those who worship only through knowledge.

A strictly contemplative life or a life devoted to pure science might have been desired by some individuals and considered by them the ideal way of life. However, they can always have been but few in number. Their ideal was never the ideal preached to, and accepted by, the vast majority of Muslims. Knowledge without corresponding action was undesirable and even unthinkable. “If there were no action, one would not search for knowledge, and if there were no knowledge, one would not search for action.”42 Society required that both knowledge and action were cultivated, and education saw to it that individuals strove to ful\u0002ll their duty with respect to both. The preference expressed frequently for knowledge seems to have stamped Islam as a social organism somewhat averse to action and more inclined toward intellectual pursuits. The state of a perfect balance between action and knowledge seems to be something of a utopia which cannot be achieved in human society, and it was not achieved in Islam. It is hard to say whether the Muslim weighting of the scales in favor of knowledge was the wiser course. However, all historical factors were clearly working toward that end and made it all but inevitable.The relationship between knowledge and action and the expression it \u0002nds in the life of individuals constitute the true measure of the worth of any given society. There is another, more restricted and formal relationship shaping human civilization. That is the relationship between knowledge and education. In Islam, it is characterized by the combination of \u0002ilm with adab on the one hand, and with ta\u0002lîm “instruction” and ta\u0002allum “study” on the other. Knowledge was conceived as the result of study and instruction in all its practical aspects. Thus, it is to be expected that the term “knowledge” and the root \u0002-l-m are somehow at the core of all the technical educational writings in Islam. The role of knowledge in the large category seems to have no justi\u0002cation for independent existence (except, perhaps, in the case of the imâms?). For just as the \u0012âhir by itself is naturally unsatisfactory, “the omission to teach the right \u0012âhir worship means the perdition of the religious group with (all) its people, since its forms (rusûm) are thereby broken and wiped out,” cf. Râ\u0003at al-\u0002aql, 349. It must be concluded that knowledge alone is also unsatisfactory.42 Cf. Ibn Qutaybah, \u0002Uyûn, II, 125 (an anonymous sage): Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 222; al-Kha\u0006ib al-Baghdâdî, Iqti\u000eâ\b, 158; al-Mubashshir, 51 (Hippocrates).ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 25110/17/2006 5:16:15 PM"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"252 knowledge is societyand diversi\u0002ed adab literature is much less clear-cut, due primarily to the wide range of the term adab itself. The adîb was the “educated” man. To what extent this also meant the learned, knowledgeable man is the question that interests us here. Like \u0002ilm and \u0002amal, \u0002ilm and adab were also often paired with each other. In this case, however, no preference is apparent for giving precedence in speech to one of the two terms. The combination “adab and \u0002ilm\u0002 seems to be at least as frequently used as the combination “\u0002ilm and adab.” Adab here is clearly the wider term, as it includes matters of ethics, morals, behavior, and custom, in addition to those of learning. It also would seem to be the more ancient term, as far as cultural signi\u0002cance is concerned, having enjoyed this role already in pre-Islamic Arabia.43 However, \u0002ilm was backed up by the vast power it acquired through Muslim religious developments, and somehow, adab had to join forces with it. It developed into a commonplace that both belonged inseparably together. “Knowledge without adab is like, \u0002re without \u0002rewood. Adab without knowledge is like a spirit without a body.”442. \u0002Ilm in Adab AnthologiesAdab works45 are hard to classify. It was left to the individual authors which particular aspects of general education and culture they wished to deal with. Concentration at some length on some particular subject led to monograph essays. It would seem that such monographs constituted the earliest stage of adab literature 43 Cf. F. Gabrieli, in Encyclopaedia of Islam, 2nd ed., s. v. adab.44 Cf. as-Sam\u0003ânî, Adab al-imlâ\b, ed. M. Weisweiler, Die Methodik des Diktatkollegs, 2 (Leiden 1952).45 “Adab works” is used here in a restricted sense, referring to prose essays and the anthologies generally designated as such. Technical essays on, for instance, calligraphy, secretaryship, or literary criticism have not been considered and have only incidentally been mentioned. As a rule, their attitude toward \u0002ilm does not differ greatly from that of other scholarly disciplines. The entire realm of poetry, which is a province of adab, even if its vast extent makes it possible to put it into a category all its own, has also been excluded. The attitudes of the major Muslim poets toward “knowledge” would make an interesting subject of study. However, broadly speaking (and being fully conscious of my ignorance of most of the immense body of poetry produced in Islam), it would seem that poetry kept its inherited distance from “knowledge” (above, pp. 12 ff.). As a term of praise for rulers and statesmen and, of course, scholars, knowledge is often mentioned in poetry. The customary praise of the virtues of knowledge was also occasionally put into verse, as was, more rarely, the embittered criticism of the problems knowledge might cause for individuals.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 25210/17/2006 5:16:15 PM"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" \u0003ilm in adab anthologies  253in Islam. Very soon, almost simultaneously perhaps, large collections combining, as it were, a number of monographs, which in the view of their authors usually represented the entire spectrum of adab, were composed. This development found its completion already in the golden age of the \u0003Abbâsids. The adab literature never changed its basic forms of monograph and anthology, nor did the great popularity especially of the anthologies ever diminish. The anthologies remained a favorite arsenal from which all those longing for a general education, for the prestige going with being considered an educated person, could draw their ammunition. It can safely be assumed that the in\u0003uence of what they had to offer was coextensive with the ability to read books. The choice and arrangement of topics in the adab anthologies varied. The expected increase of religious in\u0003uence upon an essentially secular literature is perceptible but on the whole rather insigni\u0002cant; it does not affect the degree of attention paid to the term “knowledge.” The noteworthy marriage of religious and adab scholarship in the early ninth century as represented by the Mu\u0015annaf of Ibn Abî Shaybah has previously been commented upon.46 It appears to have remained without any genuine offspring. The manner in which the Mu\u0015annaf brings together \u0002ilm with adab shows substantial similarity with what we \u0002nd in later adab works, but its spirit and intent were on the whole rather different. Greek philosophy may have been responsible for promoting the use of the concept of intelligence (\u0002aql ) in adab literature. The possession of intelligence as the \u0002rst step toward the attainment of knowledge was rather naturally stressed in an adab context in the \u0003adîth work of ad-Dârimî as early as the \u0002rst half of the ninth century,47 and no doubt even earlier than that. However, when the \u0002aql of Greek philosophy seeped more deeply into general Muslim consciousness, it found its way into adab literature almost as naturally as \u0002ilm did from the religious vantage point. This led to a kind of rivalry between \u0002aql and \u0002ilm and their opposites (mainly, \u0003amâqah and jahl in the \u0002rst case, and jahl in the second). The distinction between \u0002ilm and \u0002aql often tended to be obscured. On the level of adab in particular, whatever distinction was made between the two seems as a rule quite arti\u0002cial.4846 Cf. above, pp. 74 f.47 Cf. above, p. 76.48 Cf. below, p. 273, n. 3 and p. 276, n. 2.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 25310/17/2006 5:16:16 PM"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"254 knowledge is societyAccording to all we know, the term \u0002ilm played no great role in adab works during the eighth century. Still indicative of this early stage of the history of adab literature is the much later anthology of al-Bayhaqî, entitled al-Ma\u0003âsin wa-l-masâwî, which dates from around 900.49 The theme of the work, the confrontation of the good aspects and the bad aspects of a number of human qualities of character and behavior, would not have prevented the inclusion of a separate chapter on knowledge. However, there is none. The introduction shows that the author thought of \u0002ilm and adab as belonging together but much less closely so than became the customary assumption of later times. Typically, most of the introduction is devoted to a discussion of books and writing. If the related Kitâb al-Ma\u0003âsin wa-l-a\u0002\u000eâd is, as claimed, a work by al-Jâ\bi\u000e,50 a similar situation would be attested for the \u0002rst half of the ninth century. The work begins likewise with a chapter on writing and the production of books and has no separate discussion of knowledge. In fact, more than the abstract idea of knowledge, it was the technical aspects of bookmaking which were of concern to the littérateurs who occupied themselves with the transmission of educational wisdom. Similarly the famous catalogue of book titles by Ibn an-Nadîm, though arranged according to the various disciplines of science and scholarship, does not care to discuss knowledge as such. Here again, the introduction is concerned with various aspects of bookmaking and writing. In it, the author’s attention is directed mainly toward the mechanics of literary and scholarly book production and publication. Encyclopaedias, too, devote hardly ever any space to the theoretical problems of knowledge or consider it necessary to enter into any extended discussion of the praiseworthy qualities of knowledge. And where knowledge is equated with \u0003adîth as in the Taqyîd al-\u0002ilm of the Kha\u0006îb al-Baghdâdî, one does hardly expect to \u0002nd much speculation on knowledge in general. There is a long section in praise of writing and of books.However, a chapter on knowledge appears already in the second half of the ninth century in the great anthology of Ibn Qutaybah, the \u0002Uyûn al-akhbâr.

The latter also states that the blemishes of knowledge are forgetting, making 51 Cf. Fihrist, 77, l. 23 = 115; G. Lecomte, Ibn Qutayba, 156 f., 165 f. (Damascus 1965). See Ibn Qutaybah, \u0002Uyûn, II, 117–259.52 The passage analyzed on the following pages covers \u0002Uyûn, II, 117–30. It may be said here that cross-referencing in the footnotes has been kept to a minimum throughout this book, but particularly, in the treatment of the adab material. It should be kept in mind that a rather limited number of ideas has found expression in a large number of statements which, while often formulated differently, say pretty much the same.53 Adab and \u0003adîth constantly call attention to the fundamental role of asking questions in the educational process. For a philosopher such Ibn Bâjjah, Fi n-nafs, 146, giving information and asking question are synonymous with, respectively, teaching and studying. Knowledge was described as rooted in the question after cause and evidence in the remark attributed to al-A\u0003mash: al-\u0002ilm fî li-ma “knowledge rests in why?,” cf.

He is credited with the constantly repeated statement that “Knowledge is better than property. For knowledge protects you, while you must protect property. Property is diminished by spending, while knowledge thrives on spending.”58 \u0003Alî’s celebrated remark: “A man’s value consists in what he knows or does well.”5954 This expression of the idea that learning is a continuous process (cf. also below, p. 281) also appears in the section of anonymous sayings in al-Mubashshir, 333.55 Cf. p. 87 [at-Tirmidhî (5)], and p. 172, n. 2.56 Mujîban “answering” would seem an appropriate correction of mu\u0003ibban “loving,” but cf.

(Note that adab is contrasted here with ignorance, as if adab were a synonym of \u0002ilm.)A person who does not appreciate history and poetry and falls asleep while listening to poetry or historical anecdotes is like a donkey in human form. The idea that lack of knowledge makes a man a non-person is illustrated by an anecdote about the caliph al-Walîd b. Yazîd who does not bother with concealing the fact that he has been playing chess from an ignoramus who comes in unexpectedly.60A book of the Indians (that is, Kalîlah wa-Dimnah) teaches that a scholar’s knowledge accompanies him and provides for him wherever he goes, and thus is comparable to the strength of a lion which always stays with him.61“Knowledge is the highest nobility, just as love is the strongest of ties.” Four verses in praise of the usefulness of the stereotyped combination of \u0003ilm “kindness, gentility” and \u0002ilm.Knowledge means true leadership.

Qur\u0002ân 28:14/13). A sage among the men around the Prophet represents wisdom as saying that it is with those who act in accordance with their best knowledge and avoid all that is very bad in their knowledge.“A scholar (\u0002âlim) has no contempt for those who know less than he, and no envy of those who know more, and he does not use his knowledge to make money.”Teachers must not be too severe, and students must not be bashful. According to Luqmân, a digni\u0002ed quiet on the part of scholars makes people willing to learn. Loquaciousness repels them.

Buzurjmihr acquired his great knowledge by rising early like a raven, being greedy like a pig, and being steadfast and patient like a donkey. Knowledge ought to be acquired at a young age. As the standard simile (cited also elsewhere with some variations) puts it: That is like chiseling in stone, while studying in one’s old age is like beating upon water.“Practicing \u0002qh without knowledge (that is, without an acquaintance with the Prophetical traditions) is like being a donkey working at a mill, going around without ever stopping.”Scholars who have to spend their time among ignoramuses, or, even worse, are under their control, are to be pitied.65Knowledge, being more precious than pearls, must not be wasted upon the pigs who do not want it.

Others have wealth.” “You are looking for something rare (lit., little) among the few. Thus, you will not \u0002nd it. You are looking for wealth, which is rare among men, among the scholars, who are few among men.”A verse by al-Khuzaymî apparently to the effect that pride in a long line of ancestors is a sure guarantee of a lack of brains and a lack of adab. Two verses by somebody else, apparently indicating that their author believes that his professional skill and his adab could not possibly be greater. A verse by Abû Tammâm stating that “the mother of stupidity is fertile and has many children, while the mother of knowledge is barren, deprived of posterity.”Seeking leadership through knowledge quickly means a great loss of knowledge, according to Sufyân ath-Thawrî.On the relationship of knowledge and action: Knowledge, calling out for action, departs, if its call is not answered. An ignorant man is forgiven seventy sins, before one sin is forgiven to the person who possesses knowledge. Evil actions should not deter anyone from accepting good advice from the individual who commits them. This has been said by Bilâl b. Abî Burdah and is expressed in a famous verse, here ascribed to al-Khalîl:Act in accordance with my knowledge, and do not look at my actions.In this way, what I say will prove useful to you, and my shortcomings willdo you no harm.65 Cf. below, p. 332.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 25910/17/2006 5:16:17 PM"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"260 knowledge is societyThe light of knowledge must not be extinguished by dark sins. Knowledge is sought on account of action, and not vice versa.66 Leaving the truth alone because of one’s ignorance is better than doing so through inaction. According to Mâlik b. Dînâr, the exhortations of a man whose actions do not follow his knowledge roll off the heart like drops of water from smooth rocks.67 This remark bears comparison with a statement attributed to Ziyâd that talk that comes from the heart goes to the heart, while talk that comes from the tongue does not go beyond the ear (a statement which has little to do with the subject under discussion). The knowledge scholars possess causes them to act. Eventually, they will be sought after by the people, but as true scholars, they will \u0003ee from all the worldly demands made on them. High praise is due to the man who speaks and knows, who listens and retains, who retains and acts. According to Ibn Mas\u0003ûd, an error committed by a scholar (in his activities) may cause him to forget all he knows.Ibn \u0003Abbâs considers it deadly for a scholar not to say continually, “I do not know.” See below, pp. 310 f.Verses to the effect that a poet never says more than he knows.

Shun them!”68Buzurjmihr, reproachfully reminded by Kisrâ that his knowledge has brought him into prison and even endangered his life, denies that this has been the result of his knowledge, which he enjoyed in times of good fortune. He also remarks that as long as life is good, it is good to study and to learn. This prompts the insertion of a statement made by somebody else that since ignorance is shameful, learning and knowledge are good.“Friendship (tawaddud ) is the ornament of knowledge.”\u0003Umar puts his awareness of the restlessness for more and more knowledge that possesses true scholars, in these words: “Scholars are more prone to sleeplessness and slower to have enough to eat than any guests.”Mâlik b.

A grouping according to authorities is absent, except for the single case of some remarks ascribed to \u0003Alî. Clusters of sayings on the same topic are found more frequently, but the same topic may again be taken up in later passages.

Perhaps, the reference to the lack of regard for prophets and pious men in their 73 The remark is ascribed to Jesus in Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 227.74 Cf.

Mention of the Prophet’s expressed aversion to “dif\u0002cult problems,” as the term ughlû\u000fât is explained,75 appears all the more to be out of place here as subsequent sections of the chapter dealing with grammar and lexicography depend heavily on tricky and recondite material. It would seem that the Prophet’s warning is to be understood here as being directed against problems that may cause doubt. Thus, the \u0003adîth would recommend the necessity of cultivating certain and assured knowledge, which would be the same as simply “knowledge.” Ibn Qutaybah could have found a more pertinent and straightforward Prophetical tradition to introduce his discussion of knowledge. He might have felt that the cryptic quotation was \u0003attering to the intelligence of his readers and would in a way arouse their interest in what he was going to say.In its connection with language, grammar, and rhetoric, “knowledge” is here conceived as the comprehensive term for the principal subject to be studied by the educated individual, the ways and means of proper and effective linguistic expression. Their mastery is the \u0002rst as well as the last step in the curriculum of the adîb. “Knowledge” thus conceived is therefore \u0002ttingly claimed to be the adîb’s true and basic knowledge. In Ibn Qutaybah’s presentation, the religious development which turned \u0002ilm into a synonym of \u0003adîth and religious scholarship in general makes its in\u0003uence already felt, and the term is often to be understood in this specialized sense. The repeated references to the Gospels is another indication of religious in\u0003uence. Quotations from the Jewish and Christian Scriptures are frequent in Ibn Qutaybah’s work and re\u0003ect the broad-minded concern of the educated layman no less than the theologian with religious and intellectual matters outside the boundaries of Islam. Ibn Qutaybah’s guiding principle, however, is the consideration that in the realm of adab, “knowledge” refers to adab’s most important intellectual aspect, the ability to handle the magni\u0002cent and complicated tool of the Arabic language.This is further con\u0002rmed by the position which the chapter on knowledge and eloquent expression occupies in the \u0002Uyûn as a whole. It is part of a trilogy that itself has its place between the 75 Cf. Ibn ‚Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 225.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 26410/17/2006 5:16:18 PM"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":" \u0003ilm in adab anthologies  265discussion of the political and military leadership to be exercised over large or small groups of human beings and the discussion of the behavior required of individuals in material matters. Within this trilogy, it is preceded by a treatment of the behavior of men and animals resulting from their physical makeup and their character qualities (including stupidity). And it is followed by a chapter on the recommendable aspects of religious piety in daily life. Consequently, it can be said that in Ibn Qutaybah’s view, “knowledge” stands for the only approach to everything to some degree abstract and intellectual that is permissible in adab education which in general has the cachet of materialism and practicality. This would seem to be a somewhat restricted role, but it is clearly one of special signi\u0002cance in an environment that had so much reverence for abstract thought. In a way, its connection with \u0002ilm pulled adab into the orbit of a speci\u0002cally Muslim culture.About half a century after Ibn Qutaybah, the Spaniard, Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, compiled the famous \u0002Iqd, his great adab anthology. The \u0002Iqd has a long chapter entitled “The Ruby on \u0002Ilm and Adab.”76 Much of Ibn Qutaybah’s material is duplicated here. However, it often appears in a somewhat fuller form which all but excludes the possibility of a direct dependence for at least part of the material common to both authors. The general position of the chapter on \u0002ilm and adab is after the discussion of political leadership, and is thus the same as that of the corresponding chapter in the \u0002Uyûn. The \u0002Iqd’s treatment of \u0002ilm itself is considerably more systematic than that of the \u0002Uyûn. In other respects, the coherence of Ibn Qutaybah’s general arrangement is not preserved. The title of the chapter indicates that \u0002ilm and adab are to be considered as forming an inseparable pair. As suggested also by the philosophical scheme of the classi\u0002cation of the sciences, the preceding treatment of political science might be taken to constitute a subject in itself, rather than a part of adab. For all the remaining aspects of adab, \u0002ilm functions as a necessary foundation. Both together, as Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih explains in his introductory remarks, are “the two poles around which the religion and the world revolve 76 Cf. Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 206 to III, 62 (the reprint of volume III used here is dated Cairo 1372/1952).

The intellect exists through knowledge (pl. \u0002ulûm),77 just as the senses exist through the sense perception they attain. “Knowledge is of two kinds, a knowledge that is carried (stored), and a knowledge that is employed (put actively to work). Knowledge carried is harmful. Knowledge employed is useful.”78 It would seem, although it is not expressly stated, that adab belongs to the action side of knowledge. After the discussion of knowledge and scholars, Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbin speaks about the intellect as well as wisdom, adding aphorisms, many of which have also something to say about knowledge. It sounds like an echo from the \u0002Uyûn when he goes on to de\u0002ne and analyze eloquence.79 Thereafter, however, he treats a profusion of adab topics dealing with human emotions and behavior of a kind Ibn Qutaybah would have preferred to include in the earlier chapter on physical features and character qualities. Like Ibn Qutaybah, Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih has sections on eloquent speech and silence, on heretics and sectarians, and on grammatical problems and anecdotes. All this, however, is subordinate to the overall view of adab as comprising all aspects of human behavior. The various kinds of material related to language are treated by Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, in contrast to Ibn Qutaybah, at much greater length outside the chapter on \u0002ilm and adab. It is clear that Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih considers \u0002ilm to be something that must primarily be identi\u0002ed with the sciences concerned with language. \u0002Ilm appears in his work as the basis for all adab, as it is, we have seen, in the ethical religious view the basis of all action and in the view of the speculative theologians the basis of all theology.It would certainly be instructive to see what elaboration this theme had found, presumably another half a century later, in the hands of the great philologist and littérateur, al-Marzubânî (d. 77 Cf. below, p. 273, n. 3.78 Cf. Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 206.79 Cf. ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî, Mu\u0003â\u000earât, I, 33.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 26610/17/2006 5:16:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":" \u0003ilm in adab anthologies  267384/994). His Kitâb Talqî\u0003 al-\u0002uqûl “The Fertilization of the Intellects” appears to have been an adab work, starting out with a discussion of the intellect. This is followed by chapters on adab and on \u0002ilm, in this order. In view of the stress the Talqî\u0003 apparently placed on matters intellectual, it is rather strange to \u0002nd adab preceding \u0002ilm, but since the work is not preserved and its contents not known, it would be idle to speculate on possible reasons.80From the end of the tenth century, we have a different type of adab anthology containing a special section on \u0002ilm. This is the collection of Maqâmât by Badî\u0003-az-zamân al-Hamadhânî (d. 398/1008). It goes without saying that the Maqâmât literature cannot be simply equated with the usual adab anthologies. In a sense, it is more like prose versions of collections of poems, but in contrast to poetical dîwâns, it has a coherent theme. Like adab anthologies, it serves to illuminate all the varieties and foibles of human behavior, usually under one particular heading at a time for each. The Badî\u0003’s Maqâmah al-\u0002ilmîyah is very brief. Yet, it does surprisingly well in covering all the accepted notions of the dif\u0002culties and rewards of the search for knowledge:“Being abroad, I once heard a man asking someone else how he had obtained knowledge, and this was the reply he received: I looked for it and found it far away, not within the reach of hunting arrows, not to be obtained through divination, not to be seen in one’s sleep, not to be retained with a bridle, not to be inherited from paternal uncles, and not to be borrowed from generous men. I got it by tramping through muddy soil and leaning upon rocks, by rejecting annoyance and taking risks, by the assiduous spending of sleepless nights and liking to travel, by much speculation and the application of thought. I found it to be something good only for planting, and only for being planted in the soul, an animal to be hunted that is caught but rarely and trapped only in the bosom, a bird that is deceived only by the snare of words and enmeshed only in the net of memory. I set it upon the spirit and bound it upon the eye. I spent (my) livelihood (on it) and hoarded (it) in the heart. I checked (on its accuracy) through research, and I went from speculation to the assurance of thorough understanding, and from thorough understanding to writing and authorship, relying 80 The available information on the work derives from Fihrist, 133, ll. 6 ff. = 191.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 26710/17/2006 5:16:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"268 knowledge is societyupon the support of (divine) success. Thus, I heard words that impressed the ear, went to the heart, and seeped into the breast. I said: Young man, whence does the sun rise, and he started to say:“Alexandria is my home, even though I do not remain there for long,But in Syria I spend the night, and in the \u0003Irâq, my day.”81The plethora of allusions contained in the Arabic text is perforce absent from the translation. Even so, the ceaseless hunt for knowledge, its elusive character, its con\u0003ict with material values are superbly expressed in a few words. It may be noted that the most famous of all the Maqâmât, those written a century after the Badî\u0003 by al-\u0004arîrî, do not include a maqâmah devoted expressly to knowledge.82 However, the Maqâmât of az-Zamakhsharî, which are intended mainly to illustrate the right religious behavior, have a “Maqâmah on Action” which, in fact, deals with the problem of the relationship between knowledge and action. It has its place between the discussion of sincere devotion (ikhlâ\u0015) and the recognition of the oneness of God (taw\u0003îd ). A man learned in grammar and all the other branches of philology may boast of his knowledge and education—\u0002ilm and adab are used here indiscriminately—, but the true scholar is one who uses his knowledge to gain religious merit. Strong knowledge is useless where action is slack. “Knowledge without action is like a bow without a string.” A relationship as close as blood relationship must be established between knowledge and action. Knowledge is acquired, because it is a ladder leading up to action, which is true action only if it leads to God.83 The synthesis of religious knowledge and adab knowledge, which had been achieved by that time, is clearly observable here. It does indeed make this maqâmah one on action rather than on knowledge. The stress on action accentuates the dominant role of practical piety and religious observance in the society of az-Zamakhsharî’s time.81 Cf. Badî\u0003-az-zamân al-Hamadhânî, Maqâmât, ed. M.

As the plural âdâb indicates, the various ways in which intellectual, religious, practical/material, and spiritual/ethical behavior is to be practised are illustrated by preferably brief and aphoristic statements in prose and, quite often, in verse. As is to be expected, the chapter on knowledge shows no systematic arrangement. It starts out with strong expressions of praise for knowledge and the appropriate Qur\u0002ânic citations and statements by the Prophet and early Muslim authorities. Evidence is presented for the superiority of knowledge over ignorance. The impossibility of attaining complete knowledge is explained, and the need to acquire knowledge of all kinds wherever possible is stressed. The relationship between knowledge and material possessions is explored in the usual manner. It is recommended that the process of studying begin at an early age. Knowledge is dif\u0002cult to acquire. Again, the prevalence of ignorance is discussed. The objectionable character of using knowledge for ulterior purposes comes in for customary mention. There are sayings explaining the best methods of study and instruction, the qualities students ought to possess, the need for long and strenuous study, and the drawbacks of forgetfulness. Then, we read remarks about handwriting, about the usually bad handwriting of scholars, and about their constantly being engaged in writing. Remarks on the quali\u0002cations of students, the \u0003adîth that “good questions are one half of knowledge,” and sayings about the character qualities of scholars complete the part of the work devoted to knowledge. Its predominantly secular outlook is indicated by the fact that knowledge here continues to precede the discussion of religion and ethics. The basic role conceded to 84 Cf. al-Mâwardî, Adab (Cairo 1315). A defective but rather old manuscript of the work is preserved in Manisa 1117. It was brie\u0003y mentioned but not identi\u0002ed in Une Liste des manuscrits choisis parmi les bibliothèques de Manisa, Akhisar, 9 (Istanbul 1951). Its scribe was a certain Mu\bammad b. adaqah (al-\u0004ar?)rânî, who completed his task at the end of Sha\u0003bân 534/April 19, 1140.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 26910/17/2006 5:16:19 PM"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"270 knowledge is societythe intellect with respect to both intellectual/educational and religious/ethical activity is formally acknowledged by placing the chapter on it at the beginning, as was also the case in the work of al-Marzubânî.A similar attitude is to be found in the large adab anthology by ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî. His Mu\u0003â\u000earât may be dated in the opening years of the twelfth century. The general tendency is toward identifying \u0002ilm not only with adab but also with \u0002aql. In his dedication, ar-Râghib speaks of the contents of the work as “polish for the understanding and substance matter for knowledge,” and this, he says, be\u0002ts his sponsor’s “concern with intelligence and the protection of excellence.”85 As in al-Mâwardî, the discussion of intelligence and studipity is linked with the blameworthiness of following one’s instinctive desires and prejudices. Indicative of the possession of intelligence are such qualities as prudence, energy, cleverness, and self-reliance, as well as the skilful utilization of the intelligence possessed by others by seeking their advice. Knowledge comes next. It is likewise viewed principally as a result of intelligence and experience, a way of living a successful life. The usual topics are treated always brie\u0003y and usually according to both their good and their bad aspects. \u0002Ilm, or rather, as it turns out, adab, is the equivalent of rank and nobility (\u0003asab) and of wealth. This appears to favor the usefulness of knowledge for worldly advantage. But, as is customary, the use of knowledge merely for gaining material success is scored. The connection of knowledge and action is mentioned. A strange assortment of scholarly disciplines is brie\u0003y considered. In conformity with the religious claim to an exclusive title on “knowledge,” it starts out with \u0003adîth. Then, the philological disciplines such as grammar and prosody as well as entertaining anecdotes are considered. This is followed by speculative theology and jurisprudence, and then, there come counting, riddles, and genealogy. We have here the ordinary range of disciplines with which an educated man ought to be acquainted.Memory and forgetfulness and the writing of books are discussed, followed by paragraphs on the good and bad qualities of scholars as well as the tribulations they have to endure at the hand of 85 Cf. ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî, Mu\u0003â\u000earât, I, 2. The \u0002rst chapter on “The Intellect, Knowledge, Stupidity, and Related Subjects” covers pp. 5–96, of which pp. 5–16 are devoted to intelligence and related qualities, pp. 16–24 are devoted to knowledge, and pp. 24–32, to study and teaching.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 27010/17/2006 5:16:20 PM"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":" \u0003ilm in adab anthologies  271ignorant persons, who by nature are hostile to the learned.86 A section of equal length deals with learning and teaching in the manner of the technical educational literature. Topics discussed that take care of the student’s side are the need for spreading knowledge while at the same time being selective in the choice of quali\u0002ed students, the best age for studying, the merits of memorized knowledge versus written knowledge, the usefulness of asking questions and of admitting one’s ignorance, the dif\u0002culties encountered in acquiring knowledge, and its great diversity. The teaching side is illustrated by remarks on the value of education (ta\bdîb), by examples of admirable instructions given by important men to teachers of the past, by anecdotes about the success or lack of success of teachers with intelligent or stupid pupils, and by statements on the bad qualities of teachers and the drawbacks of the teaching profession. Thereafter, ar-Râghib turns his attention to eloquence, speaking and keeping silent, disputation, poetry, and writing—all these, we have seen, being part of the philological side of the \u0002ilm of adab. In fact, this also applies in a way to the concluding sections dealing with truth and untruth, keeping secrets, giving honest advice, being receptive to the exhortations of preachers, sermons and the recitation of the Qur\u0002ân, and making use of the “Arab” disciplines of drawing conclusions from facial expression, skilful hints, various ways of divination, and popular superstitions.All this material constitutes the \u0002rst chapter of ar-Râghib’s long work. He adopts the view of the precedence of \u0002aql in the \u0002ilm/adab scheme. More remarkable is the fact that in contrast to the older stage represented by Ibn Qutaybah and Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, the Mu\u0003â\u000earât moves the discussion of these subjects to the very beginning.87 The discussion of political science no longer forms the starting point. It follows upon the chapter on the intellect and knowledge, and is in turn followed by a very extended discussion of human behavior and a comparatively brief discussion of religious topics, including the views on dying and the customs connected with it. At the end, space is given to a loosely attached section on the physical world of nature and on angels, devils, and jinn as well as animals, in order to satisfy the claim generally made for adab 86 Cf. below, p. 322, n. 2.87 Cf. also in this connection the adab work in the Ambrosiana in Milan described by E. Grif\u0002ni, in RSO, IV (1911–12), 1032.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 27110/17/2006 5:16:20 PM"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"272 knowledge is societythat it constitutes the blue print for a complete education in all worthwhile subjects.The natural world makes the beginning in another, very successful and immensely popular adab anthology from the \u0002rst half of the twelfth century, az-Zamakhsharî’s Rabî\u0002 al-abrâr. This strikes us as making better sense than having the discussion of nature tacked on at the end. Otherwise, however, the Rabî\u0002 is to all appearances much less logical in its construction than ar-Râghib’s Mu\u0003â\u000earât. Its sixtieth chapter deals with “knowledge, wisdom, adab, writing (books), pens, and related topics.”88 The precedence accorded earlier to political science appears to be re\u0003ected in the fact that this chapter is preceded by a chapter dealing with nobility, rank, leadership, and fame. However, there seems to be no precedent in the literary tradition for the immediately following discussion of raids, killings, martyrdom, the arts and implements of warfare, courage, and cowardice. There is also no discernible internal order within the chapter on knowledge itself. The topic of the relationship of \u0002ilm and \u0002amal crops up repeatedly. The material presented is expectedly more or less identical with what is found elsewhere. However, az-Zamakhsharî shows an inclination to enliven his subject with anecdotes of famous jokesters such as Muzabbid and Ash\u0003ab. In addition to Prophetical traditions, some space is allotted to jurisprudence, in particular, that of Abû \u0004anîfah. Verses are cited rather profusely. The adab part of the chapter consists of remarks on grammar, writing, and books. The Rabî\u0002\u0005’s lack of interest in \u0002ilm is understandable, but it is to some degree indicative of the comparatively minor signi\u0002cance of \u0002ilm as a theoretical concept in many adab works. They were satis\u0002ed with the silent assumption that \u0002ilm was their domain and that they were in their entirety devoted to knowledge.The large Tadhkirah of a near contemporary, Ibn \u0004amdûn (495–562/1102–66), has no special section on \u0002ilm, as far as is known. Interestingly enough, the Tadhkirah pays tribute to the concern that had \u0002nally captured all Muslim intellectual endeavor by putting a chapter on religious exhortations and religious âdâb at 88 Cf. az-Zamakhsharî, Rabî\u0002, in Ms. Yale L-5, Vol. II, fols. 182b–204a, and in Ms. Fatih 3894, fols. 22a–34a. Questions concerning the original text of the work and which of the many preserved manuscripts contain it, as well as the relationship of the various abridgments to the original text and similar matters, remain to be answered.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 27210/17/2006 5:16:20 PM"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":" \u0003ilm in adab anthologies  273the beginning. “Worldly” âdâb and political science are removed to second place; in this connection, we \u0002nd a passage quoting al-Ma\u0002mûn and an unidenti\u0002ed philosopher on the topics of the inexhaustibility of knowledge and the degrees of importance of the various scholarly disciplines as well as the need for gradual progression in studying.89 Chapter thirteen of the Tadhkirah deals with intelligence and stupidity. This chapter, however, is unlikely to have said much if anything on “knowledge.”This is quite clear from a later adab work, the Nihâyat al-arab of an-Nuwayrî (d. 732/1332). It, too, has no special section on \u0002ilm, but it includes brief sections on intelligence and its opposites, stupidity (\u0003umq) and ignorance ( jahl). These sections make only incidental mention of \u0002ilm and its derivatives. An-Nuwayrî cites, for instance, the remark about the refractory soul’s need of knowledge and intelligence,90 or the statement ascribed to Wahb b. Munabbih that a fool is not helped by his own knowledge nor can anybody else’s knowledge help him, or the de\u0002nition of the speculative theologians of \u0002aql as “a designation for kinds of knowledge (\u0002ulûm) whose attainment by man assures the soundness of his commitment.”91 But these sections concentrate on \u0002aql and always use the term, even though it could conveniently be replaced in most cases by \u0002ilm without any great change in meaning. An-Nuwayrî uses a different and quite scienti\u0002c scheme for the arrangement of his encyclopaedic information. He starts out with the 89 Cf. Ibn \u0004amdûn, Tadhkirah, in the Istanbul Ms. Topkapusaray, Ahmet III 2948, Vol. I, fol. 150b, cf. Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 207. I have not seen the thirteenth chapter. It is, I believe, not to be found in the extant volumes of the Tadhkirah in the set of the Topkapusaray.90 Cf. above, p. 262, n. 1.91 Cf. an-Nuwayrî, Nihâyah, III, 230–37, 353–59, in particular, 232 f., 356 (Cairo 1342–1374, reprint, n.y. [1965?]).Ibn al-Jawzî, Dhamm, 5, in addition to the de\u0002nition of \u0002aql cited above, p. 156, n. 1, refers to three de\u0002nitions of \u0002aql insisting on its connection with \u0002ilm: 1. “It is a kind of the necessary kinds of knowledge (al-\u0002ulûm a\u000e-\u000earûrîyah).” 2. “It is a natural ability which makes it possible to attain the sciences (al-\u0002ulûm).” And 3. “It is a potency through which distinctions in preference can be made between the realities of the objects known.”Ardashîr is credited with the remark that “the growth of intelligence is through knowledge,” cf. Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Bahjat al-majâlis, ed. M. Mursî al-Khôlî and \u0003Abd-al-Qâdir al-Qu\u0006\u0006, I, 534 (Cairo, n.y.

The discussion of the intellect and intelligence belongs to the world of man. There is no need to discuss “knowledge” as a natural or acquired endowment. Everything discussed belongs to the realm of natural or social science, meaning that it is ipso facto “knowledge.”At the end of the development, if we can indeed speak of a development, there are works such as the Musta\u000fraf fî kull fann musta\u0012raf by al-Ibshîhî who lived in the \u0002rst half of the \u0002fteenth century. Among the numerous earlier works al-Ibshîhî says he used, he mentions in particular the \u0002Iqd and the Rabî\u0002. His use of the latter work is quite apparent also in his chapter on knowledge. The religious identi\u0002cation of all secular learning manifests itself in an introductory chapter on the \u0002ve basic pillars of Islam. Only after the necessary respect has thus been paid to the ruling force in Muslim civilization does the author consider the subject of intelligence and stupidity, making it clear that for him, the intellect ranks in importance below the duties of the religious law. There follows a chapter on the Qur\u0002ân, and this is before the author presents his chapter on knowledge. This does not mean that he considers “knowledge” exclusively the equivalent of \u0003adîth which would ordinarily be discussed right after the Qur\u0002ân. Al-Ibshîhî intends to make it clear by this arrangement that as the intellect and reason come after the religious law, thus all other scholarly concerns of man should come only after the study of the Qur\u0002ân. The full title of the fourth chapter dealing with knowledge is “On Knowledge, Adab, and the Excellence of Scholar/Teacher and Student.” It is in turn followed by a few pages of aphorisms and proverbs. The subsequent discussion of eloquence leads over to the main contents of the Musta\u000fraf, which is the detailed treatment of the usual great variety of philological, literary, ethical, and political topics. The \u0002rst four chapters occupy only a minute portion, less than \u0002ve percent, of the entire work.92 The six and a half large pages on knowledge and adab reveal a pronounced slant toward the religious meritoriousness of knowledge. This shows in the manner in which the subject of the potential faults of scholars is played down. The value of memorized knowledge is stressed, and the authorities cited in this connection are mainly religious scholars. 92 Cf. al-Ibshîhî, Musta\u000fraf, I, 6–29. The chapter on knowledge occupies pp. 23–29, trans. G. Rat, 52–68 (Paris and Toulon 1899).ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 27410/17/2006 5:16:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" \u0003ilm in adab anthologies  275A good deal of space is taken up with proving the unlimited extent of God’s knowledge with the help of a parable of al-Khi\rr, Moses, and the sparrow, and a number of other statements. Sayings attributed in az-Zamakhsharî’s Rabî\u0002 to ancient Greek authorities such as Plato, Galen, and Aristotle, are omitted, or no ascriptions are mentioned. This is also the case with regard to an anecdote on divorce which the Rabî\u0002 cites in the name of Muzabbid; the omission of the famous jokester’s name completely masks the humorous character of the anecdote. A more secular outlook is preserved in the brief section dealing with adab. The transition from \u0002ilm to adab is made by remarks on correct speech, a subject, skirting both \u0002ilm and adab. The material usefulness and worldly advantages offered by adab are the main thesis of al-Ibshîhî’s quotations, and in this connection, it does not appear inappropriate to him to insert statements bearing the names of Greek authorities such as Hippocrates and Galen. In his discussion of knowledge, the author adds another element not found in the earlier literature discussed here. Close to the beginning of the chapter, he has a de\u0002nition of knowledge.93 This shows his awareness of the role played by knowledge in speculative theology. Still, \u0002ilm remains a rather minor concept for him. His concern with impressing upon his readers the religious and morals virtues of knowledge is understandable and inevitable in the intellectual climate of his time.The preceding discussion of some adab anthologies, limited as it is, will have provided a general idea of the position the concept of \u0002ilm has over the centuries occupied in the large realm of adab. It is correct to maintain, as did al-Ibshîhî, that “each (of the many earlier works he used in the compilation of the Musta\u000fraf ) stood alone with valuable items of information not contained in the other works.”94 However, there is an extensive overlapping of information, and apart from it, the choice and import of ideas are largely the same all over, even if the words differ. Only the general organization and arrangement can give some indication with regard to the spe-ci\u0002c attitude toward knowledge taken by the various authors. On this basis, it is clear that “knowledge” made occasional attempts to work its way to the top, that is, to a conspicuous position at the beginning of a given work. However, it did so neither consistently nor very convincingly. Moreover, \u0002ilm was at times almost 93 Cf. al-Ibshîhî, Musta\u000fraf, I, 23, see de\u0002nition C-4, above, p. 56.94 Cf. al-Ibshîhî, Musta\u000fraf, I, 2.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 27510/17/2006 5:16:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"276 knowledge is societytotally disregarded. In all, it must be admitted that “knowledge” had little life of its own in the adab literature. On the other hand, knowledge was silently acknowledged all around as basic in connection with adab, and it was treated as almost synonymous with adab, in spite of repeated attempts to nail down the difference between the two concepts.95 In the adab view, knowledge is also closely allied with, and hardly distinguishable from, intelligence which, understood as a sort of Lebensklugheit or practical wisdom, became the password that opened the world of adab. Different shades of opinions existed here, too. For the men concerned with adab, the intellect certainly enjoyed precedence over knowledge,96 but it was not possible, nor was the attempt made, to shake the conviction that knowledge provided the theoretical basis for all practical intelligence. Learning from life, experience, was generally thought to be the preserve of the intellect, and not that of knowledge.97 In pre-Islamic times, it was often knowledge that was conceived as the sum total of numerous bits of experience.98 In 95 Cf. Ibn Qutaybah’s statement, above, p. 263. This statement was also quoted by a\t-afadî, Ghaylh, I, 3 (Cairo 1305/1888), cf. F. Rosenthal, in Orientalia, N.S., XI (1942), 263.96 This was also the view of the philosophers, but it was against the innermost convictions of the religious scholars. For a religious-mystical assessment of the superiority of knowledge over the intellect, cf. the \u0002ve folios contained in the Ankara Ms. Ismail Saib, I, 4120, entitled Fî taf\u000eîl al-\u0002ilm \u0002alâ l-\u0002aql. The manuscript was written in 704–706/1304–6. I do not know its author (as-Sulami?). It is followed by an essay on the nobility of the intellect (by the same author?). A late essay comparing \u0002ilm and \u0002aql was al-Kâ\u0002yajî’s Kâfî, Ms. Atif Eff, 2828, fols. 169b–173b.The \u0003aql clearly was valued more highly in the widespread view that knowledge without intelligence might be harmful. “If a man’s knowledge is greater than his intelligence, he is liable to suffer harm from his knowledge,” cf. Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Bahjah, I, 533. In particular, men of suspect religious views were often accused of possessing more knowledge than intelligence. It may be noted that in the Greek orbit, we \u0002nd, for instance. Chrysostomus (?) pondering the fact that “there is knowledge (gnôsis) without reason (logos) as well as knowledge together with reason, and there are many who have knowledge but do not have reason,” cf. Antonius Melissa, 927 f.97 Cf., for instance, Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 240 ff.; al-Ibshîhî, Musta\u000fraf, I, 17 f. A statement attributed to Plato in the Kitâb as-Sa\u0002âdah, 167, explains that “experience” goes with the intellect, as does action with knowledge. Similarly, in the Greek view, “experience” belonged together with wisdom, as indicated, for instance, in a saying attributed to the musician, Lasus, calling experience (peira) the wisest thing (sophôtaton) there is, cf. Antonius Melissa, 935 f., as it was also considered “the best” (Theognis).98 Cf. above, pp. 14 f.; Ibn Qutaybah, \u0002Uyûn, II, 191. The verse of \u0005arafah cited above, p. 15, is explained as referring to “wisdom,” which is hardly ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 27610/17/2006 5:16:21 PM"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":" monographs in praise of knowledge 277poetry, this idea seems to have lived on more directly than in prose. Thus, al-Mutanabbî sang:I have tasted the bitter and the sweet of affairsAnd walked over the rough and the smooth paths of days.I have come to know all about time. It cannot produceAny extraordinary word or any new action.Elsewhere, he said:I knew the nights before they affected me,And when they af\u0003icted me, it gave me no additional knowledge.99At least for the many who listened to the voice of poets,100 knowledge continued to signify also something gained not through study or inspiration but through practical experience and the hard school of life. But like logic which is all about knowledge and therefore can dispense with much discussion of the concept as such, adab also deals with knowledge in its totality and therefore does not have to make many words about it, while being fully conscious of its dependence on it.3. Monographs in Praise of Knowledge and the Educational LiteratureThe ambiguity surrounding the position of the concept of \u0002ilm in adab literature would make us suspect that monographs on knowledge from the adab point of view might not have existed at an early stage, in contrast to what was the situation with other adab topics. Therefore, it deserves notice that a brief essay on the excellence of knowledge (Risâlah fî fa\u000el al-\u0002ilm) addressed to A\bmad b. Abî Du\u0002âd (d. 240/854) is preserved in an eleventh-century manuscript.101 The name of its author is not indicated. From the correct, cf. Is\bâq b. Ibrâhîm al-Kâtib, al-Burhân fî wujûh al-bayân (formerly known as Ibn Qudâmah, Naqd an-nathr), ed. A.

Dispensing with it (adab) is harmful to the intellect,” cf. Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Bahjah, I, 110.101 Cf. Mu\bsin al-Amîn al-\u0004usaynî, in Revue de l’Académie arabe de Damas, XIX (1944), 74. The manuscript containing the essay is dated in 420/1029. It was used by a certain Abû n-Najib \u0003Abd-ar-Ra\bmân b. Mu\bammad b. \u0003Abd-al-Karîm al-Karkhî in 528/1133–34. On the basis of a copy of the same manuscript, the present whereabouts of which are not known to me, Ibn \u0003Abbâd’s \u0002Unwân al-ma\u0002ârif was published by M. \u0004.

Knowledge, the most precious and sought after merchandise in the world, is preserved in books whose authors themselves perish, while their written works remain. What we have in this essay, therefore, is not really the praise of knowledge but an expression of admiration for the great wonder of the technique of its literary preservation which excited the littérateurs of early \u0003Abbâsid times. In their forefront was al-Jâ\bi\u000e, who was on intimate terms with Ibn Abî Du\u0002âd and who himself is credited with a (related?) book of the same title.102 The praise of books had a certain polemical sting to it. It concealed an attack against the aversion for an exclusively written \u0002xation of their particular knowledge professed by “orthodox” religious scholars. The anonymous essay thus deals with one of the technical educational aspects of the transmission of knowledge. That the subject was soon accepted generally into the educational literature even where the stress was on memorized knowledge, is hardly surprising in view of the fact that paper made Islam a civilization of the written word to a degree not possible before.Bibliographical indications concerning early monographs on knowledge are neither numerous nor unambiguous. Some can be assumed with some assurance to have dealt with knowledge from the religious traditionist point of view.103 If a title ascribed to Wâ\til b. \u0003A\u0006â\u0002, the Mu\u0003tazilah speculative theologian, reads, “The Classes of the People of Knowledge and Ignorance,”104 the subject dealt with in such a work was most probably a confrontation of Wâ\til’s dogmatic views with those of his adversaries. No early eighth-century monograph especially devoted to adab and \u0002ilm can be suspected here. An early Mâlikite, \u0003Abd-al-Malik b. \u0004abîb (d. 238/853, or 239), wrote a Kitâb al-Wara\u0002 fî l-\u0002ilm “On Austerity in Knowledge.” Since he is also credited with a companion treatise on “Austerity in Wealth”, it would seem that he was dealing 102 Cf. the Persian translation of the Fihrist, 308, and the biography of al-Jâ\bi\u000e in Yâqût’s Irshâd.103 Cf. above, p. 77, and, for the Shî\u0003ah and Mu\u0003tazilah Kitâb al-Ma\u0002rifah, cf. above, pp. 146 ff. Cf. also above, p. 94, n. 1.104 Cf. the Houtsma fragment of the Fihrist, in WZKM, IV (1890), 217–35. Another fragment of the Fihrist mentions a Kitâb I\u000eâfat al-\u0002ulûm by a certain speculative theologian, \u0004umayd b. Sa\u0003îd b. Bakhtiyâr, cf. J. Fück, in ZDMG, XC (1936), 309. If the title is transmitted correctly, the work may have dealt with the interdependence of the various sciences, with a view to proving that their apex is constituted by speculative theology.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 27810/17/2006 5:16:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":" monographs in praise of knowledge 279with educational aspects of knowledge meant to inculcate the proper attitude toward study and scholarship in the student.105 The Kitâb Fa\u000eâ\bil al-\u0002ilm “On the Merits of Knowledge” by another Mâlikite, the judge of Toledo, Ya\byâ b. Zakarîyâ\u0002 b. Muzayn (d. 259/873, or 260), was probably concerned mostly with religious knowledge, since Ibn Muzayn is also credited with a work on the merits of the Qur\u0002ân.106 And the Targhîb fî l-\u0002ilm “Encouragement toward Knowledge” by the Shâ\u0002\u0003ite, al-Muzanî (d. 264/878), almost certainly dealt with Shâ\u0002\u0003ite jurisprudence, the “knowledge” of the title.107A further element of confusion comes in through the similarity in Arabic writing of \u0002ilm and qalam “pen.” The \u0002fty folios by a certain A\bmad b. Mu\bammad b. Abî 1-A\tbagh, who possibly \u0003ourished in the second half of the ninth century, could no doubt have dealt with “Knowledge and the Nobility of Writing and Secretaryship,” as the published text of the Fihrist says,108 for we have seen that a discussion of knowledge might be added to that of writing; however, originally, it might rather have been “pen” instead of “knowledge.” The same applies to the title of a work by Ibn Abî Sar\b.109 In the case of “The Book on Knowledge” by a certain \u0003Alî b. Mu\bammad ash-Shimshâ\u0006î (not as-Sumaysâ\u0006î), who lived under the \u0004amdânids, the reading “knowledge” found in the edition of the Fihrist does indeed not appear in the edition of Yâqût’s Irshâd where we \u0002nd “pen.”110 Either reading could be correct. The only thing we can say is that in view of the other titles accredited to the author, it must in any case have been an adab work. On the other hand, “The Festivals of the Souls on Knowledge” by the philologian \u0003Abdallâh b. Mu\bammad al-Khazzâz, who wrote under the wazîr \u0003Alî b. \u0003Îsâ and may therefore be dated approximately in the early tenth century, would seem to have been a monograph 105 Cf. Ibn Far\bûn, Dîbâj, 155. His Kitâb al-Wara\u0002, now preserved in the Escorial, 5146, 6 (cf. GAL, Suppl., I, 231; Sezgin, I, 362), deals with “austerity” in practical and ethical behavior. It may well be the Kitâb al-Wara\u0002 fî l-\u0002ilm, \u0002ilm meaning traditional information, in which case it has nothing to do with the subject under discussion here.106 Cf.

His aim is to show that while the acquisition of knowledge calls for hard work, industriousness, and great sacri\u0002ce, the rewards both material and spiritual are worth the effort required. The two basic ideas are rather skilfully interwoven, with the principal stress on the necessity of relentless labor. Knowledge means perfection or, as the author puts it, “perfect among men is he who realizes the excellence of knowledge and then is able to study, in order to obtain knowledge,” and, as a result, to taste the sweetness of the incomparable pleasure it provides.115 As far as the praise of knowledge is concerned, al-\u0003Askarî otherwise restricts himself to some of the more ordinary statements, such as the \u0003adîth af\u0002rming the Prophet’s 111 Cf. Fihrist, 82 = 122.112 Cf. Fihrist, 133 = 199. The other titles listed in connection with this author seem to indicate that he was principally interested in natural science, presumably from the point of view of the philologian. He has nothing to do with the Zaydî theologian, cf. Sezgin, I, 626; S. M. Stern, in JRAS, 1961, 18.113 Cf. the editor’s introduction to Ibn Qayyim al-Jawzîyah, Raw\u000eat al-mu\u0003ibbîn, p. sh, no. 50.114 Cf. al-\u0003Askarî, \tathth.

It looks as if the text of the work in Ms. Hamidiye extends to fol. 68b. However, fols. 66a–68b contain fragments of one or two hitherto unidenti\u0002ed treatises.115 Cf. above, p. 241.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 28010/17/2006 5:16:22 PM"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":" monographs in praise of knowledge 281permission to use \u0003attery and show envy in connection with knowledge, or \u0003Alî’s famous remark that a man’s value consists in what he knows or does well.116 Comparatively little space is given to the speci\u0002c religious connotation of knowledge, although it is not entirely disregarded. At one point, it rather strangely intrudes upon the author’s strong concern with literature and philology, when he quotes a statement to the effect that a student “should postpone the study of history (akhbâr) and poetry to the time he is tired (malal).”117 The importance and in\u0003uence of knowledge are greater than that of political power (sul\u000fân). Therefore, the best among rulers try hardest to acquire knowledge.Al-\u0003Askarî gives examples of the high esteem shown to scholars and the important position in society they occupy, often in spite of their lowly origins which ordinarily would not have allowed them to advance far beyond their fathers’ menial situations. Much more numerous, and more interesting, are the anecdotes and remarks on the dif\u0002culties that must be overcome on the road to knowledge. He cites the statement concerning the six qualities needed: a penetrating mind, much time, ability, hard work, a skilful teacher, and desire (or, in the parlance of our own time, “motivation,” shahwah). On his own, he adds the very elementary need for “nature,” that is, an inherited physical endowment, such as Muslim philologians of al-\u0003Askarî’s type always claimed as essential for their intellectual pursuits. The search for knowledge must be unsel\u0002sh. As the author repeats over and over again, it is a never ending process. Persistent study sharpens the natural faculties. The hunger for knowledge is never stilled, as proclaimed by traditions ascribed to the Prophet. Stationariness means ultimate failure, according to the widely quoted saying that “man does not cease knowing as long as he studies, but once he gives up studying, he is the most ignorant of men.”118 Constant travel in search of knowledge and regular attendance at the teacher’s lectures are mandatory. The prospect of learning something not known before should make a man forget his home and his family and endure all possible hardships, as illustrated by an anecdote about al-A\tma\u0003î. Scholars refrain at times from certain foods as too luxurious or as harmful to the powers of memory. They study all night long. 116 See above, p. 256, and below, p. 323.117 For the sentiment expressed, cf. also, for instance, Rosenthal, A History of Muslim Historiography, 324.118 See above, p. 256, n. 1.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 28110/17/2006 5:16:23 PM"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"282 knowledge is societyAsh-Shâ\u0002\u0003î paid no attention to a slave girl given to him by friends who wants to sleep with him. Abû \u0004anîfah, asked about the manner in which memorized knowledge can be acquired, exclaimed, “Lamp oil, lamp oil” (al-bizr al-bizr), and a poor student later to become a famous scholar, Abû \u0004âtim (as-Sijistânî?), being unable to buy lamp oil, used the watchman’s lantern to study at night in the streets. Scholars continue their studies even in the bath. They are so absorbed in their work that they do not notice what is going on around them, that they do not care to waste time on eating, that they do not bother when a hemorrhage occurs during their all-night study. In the last case, a warning note is sounded for the bene\u0002t of the reader: Studying is done for the good of one’s soul (life). If the soul is destroyed, the knowledge acquired is of no use. “Overstepping the right mean in studying may lead to the loss of knowledge.”Again as a philologian, al-\u0003Askarî uses a good deal of the latter half of his treatise to argue in favor of the superiority of memorized knowledge. In his eyes, memorized knowledge is the most dif\u0002cult and, at the same time, the most useful and rewarding kind of knowledge, the kind of knowledge that swims with you when your ship sinks.119 Among the many good anecdotes he reports in this connection, there is one of Abû \u0003Ubaydah and al-A\tma\u0003î and the caliph Hârûn ar-Rashîd. The caliph asked the two scholars to instruct him in the names of the various parts of the body of horses. Abû \u0003Ubaydah referred him to his book on the subject. Al-A\tma\u0003î, on the other hand, impressed the caliph favorably by asking for a horse and a pointer and pointing out the various parts.For al-\u0003Askarî, \u0002ilm is the equivalent of adab. He uses the two terms interchangeably, as, for instance, when he says in versifying the Prophetical tradition about the envy of knowledge: “I do not envy a man’s money, but I envy his adab.” It is philological knowledge that interests him most. That it is not knowledge in general, is also indicated by the very few lines devoted to ignorance and the low status of ignoramuses. Works of this type tend, in fact, to concentrate on some particular discipline rather than knowledge as a whole. Already al-Kindî wrote a work of an almost identical title where “philosophy” is substituted for al-\u0003Askarî’s 119 In Greek tradition, this saying was ascribed to Antisthenes or to Aristippus, cf. F. Rosenthal, in Orientalia, N.

In this sense, a treatise such as that by al-\u0003Askarî is part of the technical educational literature, even if it deals with a \u0002eld as general and broad as adab education.* * *The technical educational literature is again something that is devoted in its entirety to questions of knowledge. Like logic and general adab, it does not always have to use the term \u0002ilm, in order to indicate its concern with knowledge. It deals with the practical aspects of how to acquire and spread knowledge. It does not require any theoretical discussion of what knowledge is. All knowledge, all the individual scholarly and scienti\u0002c disciplines, are subsumed under it. In addition, the ethical and psychological conditions necessary for the learning and teaching process come within its purview. All this means that there is an immense ground to be covered, with the result that individual works are able to deal only with speci\u0002c aspects and view the educational process on different levels. On the highest scholarly level, we thus have the encyclopaedias which attempt to bring order into the totality of the accumulated positive knowledge of their times and to provide the student with a capsule description of the essential features of all or the main disciplines. On the highest social level, there are the educational works known as fürstenspiegel which attempt to distill the knowledge needed for the top layer of society. The existence and rather wide spread and popularity of both types of literature constitute another testimony to the importance of the role of knowledge in society, even if they make short shrift of any abstract theoretical concerns. For this reason, however, they require no special attention here.121120 Cf. Fihrist, 256 = 358.121 On encyclopaedias, informative surveys are M.

A substantial number of works were written on learning and teaching in the service of the Muslim religious educational system, and there were philosophical re\u0003ections on the educational ideal and how it could be reached or at least approached. The \u0002rst type is more originally Islamic. It is also earlier with respect to literary \u0002xation, and although it continued to move along rather narrowly de\u0002ned lines, it remained more productive throughout Muslim history.The philosophical view of education entered Islam in connection with the Graeco-Arabic translation activity during the ninth century and, perhaps, the early years of the tenth century. It perpetuated its views by merging into general ethics of which it later on constituted a small part. Its brief history can be quickly summarized, as far as it interests us here.Some inkling of a secular curriculum came to the attention of Muslims through \u0004unayn’s Nawâdir al-falâsifah. In sporadic later attempts to substitute pedagogically more suitable courses of study for the all pervasive custom of making the beginning with the Qur\u0002ân and also often making it the end of all instruction, it is possible to recognize an echo of Hellenistic in\u0003uence.122Understandably, the philosophical view of education centers in its terminology around the terms adab and ta\bdib, as these words render Greek paideia.123 Here, adîb signi\u0002es the person who possesses paideia. He is the paideutos, and the absence of adab marks him as apaideutos. No monographs devoted to philosophical education appear to have been preserved. However, there can be little doubt that a short treatise such as Plato’s “Exhortation on the Education of Young Men,” preserved by Miskawayh,124 and the commented are still lacking. A continuation of Richter’s work, extending to later periods, would be especially desirable.The Kitâb Zâdânfarrûkh (sic leg.) fî ta\bdîb waladih “Zâdânfarrûkh on the Education of his Son,” mentioned in Fihrist, 315 = 438, appears to be a fürstenspiegel like the \u0002ahd literature mentioned in the same chapter of the Fihrist.122 Cf. \u0004unayn, as translated by Rosenthal, Fortleben, 105, and Ibn Khaldûn, Muqaddimah, trans.

Together with the section on the education of children from the Oikonomikos of the Neo-Pythagorean Bryson, whose in\u0003uence on later Muslim ethical discussions of education has been elucidated by M. Plessner,126 these works contain the essence, of all the philosophical thought on the technical side of education known in Islam. The famous philosophical Bildungsroman of later times which attempts to show how mankind can acquire all the essential knowledge about the worlds of nature, mind, and metaphysics through its own intellectual powers is in no way a direct continuation of such Greek educational theory. Its origin in the problem of reason and revelation is rooted in what had become thoroughly Muslim soil. It serves to reinforce the conviction of the primacy of knowledge, but even where it deigns to admit the inevitability of societal organization, its premises require it to be totally unconcerned with educational realities actual or potential.127The “Exhortation on the Education of Young Men” is stated by Miskawayh to have been translated by Is\bâq b. \u0004unayn. However, it is very probable that it also represents the work of the same title mentioned in the Fihrist as having been translated by a certain Abû \u0003Amr Yû\bannâ b. Yûsuf al-Kâtib.128 There is no good reason to disregard the statement that the entire treatise is a translation, even if it is possible that in the form in which it appears in Miskawayh, it has undergone some alterations. At any rate, these would appear to have been minor. The treatise falls into two parts. One deals with the ethical behavior to be expected in teachers.

The setting in which the educational process can reach fruition is indicated to be a strictly organized, authoritarian, and regimented, yet egalitarian group of teachers and students. All of them must be devoted to a life of high virtue and must faithfully believe in the wisdom of the master philosopher. He shows the way, having reached his insight through constant self-examination and a never ending search for wisdom. The students who desire to enter the realm of knowledge must possess unblemished purity, for the almost holy community of learners requires them to have the highest standards of intellectual honesty and to show sincerity, humility, and modesty in all their behavior and activities. In connection with the subjects of instruction, only the training in the arts of war and in music is mentioned. This blends well with the strictly aristocratic outlook of the community of scholars. It is possible that the original text contained more information on the course of study and the subjects to be studied, but this is not very likely to have been the case. It might have been understood that except for some basic aristocratic skills, no specialized knowledge was necessary or desirable. Philosophical contemplation and a code of behavior and action suitable for dedicated intellectuals were the true goal of education.The Kitâb as-Sa\u0002âdah discusses politics and ethics and the contribution they must make to the achievement of the ultimate end of philosophy, which is the attainment of happiness. It agrees with the “Exhortation” as to the desirable goal of education. However, its concern is not only with the advanced age group considered by the “Exhortation” but also with children at the earlier stages of their education and development. Education must begin with the earliest years of childhood. The foundations must be laid early. These foundations are the \u0002rm belief that happiness and the good are achieved through obeying the laws (sunan) and one’s elders (akâbir), so that in encountering a law or a command (amr), children welcome it as warmly as if they had found something good. All education is a continuing process. It is the way to the philosophical life or, what is the same, to happiness.The material ascribed to Plato and the comments thereon are interspersed with other quotations, mainly in the name of Greek sages.

A \u0002rst-person statement, possibly-expressing the opinion of the author of the Kitâb as-Sa\u0002âdah, or rather, that of the unnamed commentator (?), de\u0002nes adab as the human wisdom which, in turn, is the observed and considered knowledge about (ma\u0002rifah) the way of life leading to happiness. The purpose of adab, and here Plato is cited again, is to produce the good man who is able to refrain from physical and material pleasures and to show emotional stability in the face of joys and sorrows and all other happenings as well as remain undisturbed and inactive, except where reason and thought indicate the desirability or necessity of action. The person undergoing education and at an advanced stage of the educational process is identical with the man of reason (nâ\u000fiq); consequently, the absence of education is identical with the absence of reason (nu\u000fq). An uneducated person is like a dreamer awake—enhypnia egrêgorota—, here cited as a dictum of Plato, whereas Greek tradition ascribes it to Antisthenes.130 The education of children must be attuned to their capacity. At \u0002rst, they must be playfully coaxed into acquiring knowledge and understanding. Serious thought must be presented to them in the form of play. This can be done, for instance, by instructing them in myths which are untrue and \u0002ctitious on the surface but of serious educational content.131 It may take the form of poetry that praises virtue and modesty (i.e., sôphrosynê), as against poetry that advocates license and pleasure. As in the “Exhortation,” the serious stage of education requires purity at its very beginning, even for very young children. There ought to be an aversion to everything ugly and dirty. The “leader” (sâ\bis), a term which plays a large role also in the “Exhortation,” must banish all ugliness from the country and expel all those who do not refrain from doing evil. Love of what is good and useful, and hatred of what is ugly or evil and harmful are the conditions for success. Bashfulness (\u0003ayâ\b, corresponding to Greek aidôs) and the avoidance of bad company 129 Muta\baddib is, however, understood not only as the person potentially ready for education, but he may also be identical with the adîb who may be either a muta\baddib advanced in his education or a person quali\u0002ed to teach and educate others.130 Cf.

It is important that it begins with the right principles. Constant training (ta\u0002wid) must be employed to produce the proper moral and ethical habits of hard work and endurance, obedience to authority, abstinence from intoxicating beverages, disbelief in bugbears, fearlessness in the face of death, and so on. This training should follow gentle methods, and only where gentleness does not work, should severity be employed. After a brief interlude discussing the relationship between rulers and their subjects, higher education, that is, the study of philosophy, is described. Here the terms mu\u0002allim and muta\u0002allim replace the derivations from the root \b-d-b. The age of twenty is suggested as the one in which youths have attained the proper physical and mental development for higher studies. However, they still have to show the same respect for their teachers as do younger children. If they are unwilling, they should not be forced to study, as this would not produce desirable educational results. The training of teachers should extend over the \u0002rst \u0002fty years of their lives. After reaching adulthood at the age of twenty, they are to study the various special disciplines for a period of ten years, acquire competence in the art of disputation ( jadl ) during another \u0002ve years, and then, during another \u0002fteen years, perfect the substantive knowledge acquired before. Only then are they ready to teach, and that only if they possess the right ethical attitude. The six disciplines enumerated in the name of Plato and to be studied, apparently, in sequence are arithmetic, geometry, the geometry of solids, astronomy, music, and logic.The following discussion of the education of women leans heavily on quotations from a “female philosopher” of apparent (Neo-) Pythagorean connections. Although the name of Plato is in general invoked by the “Exhortation” and the Kitâb as-Sa\u0002âdah, it is clearly Neo-Pythagoreanism with its penchant for education and for esoteric educational societies where we have to look for the Greek originals of the Arabic material. The Neo-Pythagorean origin of Bryson’s “Economics” is even less in doubt. For Bryson, too, happiness is the \u0002nal goal. Since his work is concerned with what takes place within the home and the family, his section on education deals exclusively with small children and omits entirely the discussion of higher education, which as a rule took place ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 28810/17/2006 5:16:24 PM"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":" the educational literature  289outside the family environment. In addition to good physical stock and native endowment, constant training with a view to implanting proper habits is the crucial task of education also for Bryson. Good manners in eating and appropriate habits of sleep are considered important. The avoidance of sexual activity is recommended. A habit of respect for one’s elders, hardiness, simple tastes, and the occasional diversion of play are among the things belonging to educational training.All the foregoing material entered the general current of Muslim thought through the devoted activities of the philosophical rear-guard of the Graeco-Arabic translation movement \u0003ourishing in tenth-century Iran. In another of his works, the Tahdhîb al-akhlâq “On Ethics,” Miskawayh based his chapter on the education of children, as he states himself, upon Bryson. Miskawayh’s exposition, in turn, served as the basis for later highly in\u0003uential treatments of the subject. They were included in al-Ghazzâlî’s I\u0003yâ\b\u0005132 and the Persian “Nasirean Ethics” by Na\tîr-ad-dîn a\u0006-\u0005ûsî,133 which became standard for all subsequent work. The form in which Bryson’s Neo-Pythagorean ideas are restated shows rather noteworthy changes, but there is little change in the general conception. Miskawayh sees in Bryson’s exposition the trustworthy guide toward all human ethical and intellectual ways and habits leading to true humanity and happiness. Na\tîr-ad-dîn a\u0006-\u0005ûsî has in mind more advanced studies and the choice of a craft or profession on the basis of elementary education. Neither view is alien to Bryson, but the difference in emphasis we \u0002nd in the works of Miskawayh and Na\tîr-ad-dîn a\u0006-\u0005ûsî re\u0003ects the direction Muslim civilization had taken in the intervening years. Nevertheless, even for Na\tîr-ad-dîn a\u0006-\u0005ûsî, the philosophical view of education remains decisive. Adab-paideia is principally a function of individual and collective ethics and of societal structure. Its knowledge contents are an integral but in a way less relevant part of it.In this last respect, the situation is quite different in the literature inspired by and dealing with religion-related education. Here, “knowledge” and the praise of it reverberate in full force from beginning to end.

In their own minds at least, their ideas had general validity for all knowledge. The identi\u0002cation by their titles of works that are not preserved once more presents insuperable dif\u0002culties. The Kitâb al-\u0002Alim wa-l-muta\u0002allim by \u0004af\t b. Salm al-Fazârî (Abû Muqâtil as-Samarqandî), who died in 208/823–24 rather than in 258/871–72,134 was certainly a catechism, as was the famous work of the same title by Abû \u0004anîfah, if it was not indeed identical with it, al-Fazârî being merely its transmitter. When the same title appears again among the works of the prominent early tenth-century Shî\u0003ah jurist, Mu\bammad b. Mas\u0003ûd al-\u0003Ayyâshî, in a list which seems to refer to monographs on certain points of the religious law, it may indicate a work on the laws governing teaching, uncertain as this is.135 It seems impossible to venture a sensible guess as to the contents of the Kitâb al-\u0002Ilm wa-t-ta\u0002lîm mentioned by the author of the Kitâb al-Bad\b wa-t-ta\brîkh as another one of his works.136 It is not likely to have dealt with the technical aspects of education.Fortunately, the relatively early date of educational monographs is attested in the realm of Mâlikite jurisprudence.137 The Âdâb al-mu\u0002allimîn “The Behavior of Teachers” by Su\bnûn’s son, Mu\bammad (202–256/817–870), based on his father’s materials, is preserved.138 It in\u0003uenced the production of similar treatises among Mâlikites and may itself have continued what already in its time 134 The title is mentioned in Ibn \u0004ajar, Lisân, II, 323 (Hyderabad 1329–31). On the author, cf., for instance, Ibn Abî \u0004âtim ar-Râzî, Kitâb al-Jar\u0003 wa-t-ta\u0002dîl, I, 2, 174, 187 (Hyderabad 1941–53); Ibn \u0004ajar, Tahdhîb, II, 397–99, and, for his role as the transmitter of the work of Abû \u0004anîfah, cf.

Rustam, who is placed in the \u0002rst half of the ninth century, seems open to doubt. It would be by far the earliest treatment of the subject of education according to the law, and, moreover, in the form of verse. Cf. J.

It is, however, quite brief, and this would tend to indicate that it was, in fact, the \u0002rst effort, or at least a very early effort, to put out a monograph on the subject of elementary teaching. Such teaching is primarily the study of the Qur\u0002ân. Therefore, traditions in praise of the merit of teaching the Qur\u0002ân make the beginning. The technical details of Qur\u0002ân teaching wind through the entire treatise. They concern such matters as how to wipe clean the slates of children studying the Qur\u0002ân or how deeply to go with them into the subject. The possibility of the teacher teaching other subjects such as counting, poetry, grammar, and philology is mentioned only in passing. The teacher’s duties vis-à-vis his young charges are discussed, among them the requirement of treating all of them equally, using corporal punishment within limits only, instructing them in the religious duties of Muslims, giving the children some holidays off, and employing the right ways of supervising them. The most prominent treatment, it would seem, is reserved for matters touching on the \u0002nancial status of teachers. They have various obligations such as providing for the needed schoolroom and for equipment. Questions of compensation, gifts on special occasions, and ways of earning additional income are treated at some length. It is not unfair to maintain that more than anything else, Ibn Su\bnûn’s work is concerned with the economic position of teachers. From the legal point of view, this would, in fact, be the most important practical problem to be considered and to be provided with legal guidelines.The later treatise “On the Laws Governing Teachers and Students” by the great Mâlikite authority, Ibn Abî Zayd (316–386/928–996), is known so far only from a quotation in Ibn Khaldûn.139 No de\u0002nite statement can be made about its contents. However, a younger contemporary of Ibn Abî Zayd and fellow Mâlikite, \u0003Alî b. Mu\bammad al-Qâbisî (324–403/936–1012), also wrote a “Treatise Detailing the Conditions of Students and the Laws Governing Teachers and Students,”140 which is preserved. It is a much longer work than Ibn Su\bnûn’s compilation. It starts out 139 Cf. Ibn Khaldûn, Muqaddinah, trans. Rosenthal, I, 261, III, 306. The title is not mentioned in Ibn Far\bûn, Dibâj, 137. Ibn Far\bûn lists a Kitâb \u0010alab al-\u0002ilm. This could be the same work, although this is by no means certain. The assumption that Ibn Khaldûn meant al-Qâbisî (cf. Sezgin, I, 481, n. 1b) is possible but cannot be proved.140 Cf. al-Qâbisî, 1st ed., 241–318, 2nd ed., 267–347. Al-Qâbisî also wrote a Kitâb Rutab al-\u0002ilm, cf.

The prevailing impression gained from a study of al-Qâbisî’s work con\u0002rms the assumption that the economic concerns of the teacher were uppermost in the minds of these early Mâlikite jurists when they wrote their works.Monographs in the same spirit composed by jurists belonging to other legal schools are not preserved from these early centuries, although some no doubt existed. However, such practical problems may not have been of equal appeal for scholars of the other schools in those days, and it may not merely be the fault of sources or insuf\u0002cient knowledge which leaves us without any information on relevant titles. The contents of the Kitâb Riyâ\u000eat al-muta\u0002allim “The Training of the Student” by az-Zubayr b. A\bmad az-Zubayrî from the early tenth century cannot be determined from its title. It is not likely to have been a work on education.141 In general, evidence for further legal works on education becomes available only for a much later period, the \u0002fteenth and sixteenth centuries. We have rather short treatises of very limited interest, such as Zakarîyâ\u0002 al-An\târî’s (d. ca. 1511–1521) al-Lu\blu\b an-na\u0012îm, which is nothing more than a list of sciences, each of them brie\u0003y de\u0002ned and its usefulness indicated.142 Or the Ta\u0003rir al-maqâl by Ibn \u0004ajar al-Haytamî, who died in 974/1567, which deals with elementary education and is in reality a long and interesting fatwâ on educational and administrative problems of orphanages. As a kind of background information, the author provides an introduction considering problems of Qur\u0002ân teaching, traditions on the merits of it, the question of renumeration for it, the use of the Qur\u0002ân for magic spells, the danger for teachers of looking at beardless boys, and the like.143 These works contribute little or nothing to illustrating the position of knowledge in Islam, nor does the educational literature of ûfîs as represented by the ninth-century Adab al-\u0002âlim wa-l-muta\u0002allim of Abû Bakr al-Warrâq.144 It brie\u0003y eluci-141 Cf. as-Subkî, \u0010abaqât ash-Shâ\u0002\u0002îyah, II, 224; GAL, Suppl., I, 306; Sezgin, I, 495.142 Cf.

The need of adab in preference to \u0002ilm in the educational process was felt deeply by parents who saw their children leave home to devote themselves to religious studies of various kinds. Rather touchingly, we hear, for instance, about the mother of Mâlik dressing him in scholarly garments, putting the long hat with the turban wound around it upon his head, and sending him off with the advice to learn from the adab of his prospective teacher, Rabî\u0003ah, before learning from his \u0002ilm.145\tadîth scholars such as the Kha\u0006îb al-Baghdâdî operated on a more advanced level in their educational efforts, and they were more concerned with the contents of their discipline than the elementary teaching of it. Still, the relationship between professor and student was an integral part of the process of the transmission of traditions, and since oral transmission as the basic procedure was hardly more than a \u0002ction at that time, much emphasis was put on matters such as writing techniques and the production and handling of books. A good handbook on the organization of higher education in the science of traditions from the twelfth century is as-Sam\u0003ânî’s Adab al-imlâ\b wa-l-istimlâ\b “The Method of Dictating and Taking Down Dictation.”146 Needless to say, the pervasive theme of the work was \u0002ilm, and this fact is repeatedly stressed. Later in the same century, the Spanish-Moroccan Jewish author, Ibn \u0003Aqnîn, wrote interestingly on education, if not in monograph form. He inserted a long chapter on the subject in his \u0010ibb an-nufûs “Spiritual Medicine.”147 As is to be expected from a non-Muslim author writing in Arabic, we encounter here a somewhat different outlook. It is not merely the fact that Ibn \u0003Aqnîn always establishes a relation between his views on education and Jewish religious literature, which makes his treatment different; if this were so, not much attention need be paid to it. His treatment is distinguished by a more systematic method, a greater stress on essentials, and a more comprehensive view of education as a uni\u0002ed process from the most elementary to the highest stages.

In this respect, he may have been inspired by ideas current in the intellectual climate of Western Islam. His prime model, however, was obviously the discussion of the duties of students and teachers from the book on knowledge in al-Ghazzâlî’s I\u0003yâ\b.148 Ibn \u0003Aqnîn speaks about the teacher, the subjects to be taught, and the student, in this order. The seven conditions for the teacher are 1. complete mastery of his subject; 2. a life of action in accordance with knowledge; 3. the acceptance of no remuneration for his teaching; 4. the treatment of his students as if they were his children; 5. a deep conviction of the excellence of knowledge and of action informed by knowledge as well as the desire to inculcate this conviction in his students and thereby guide them toward happiness; 6. kindness and patience with his students; and 7. the use of a gradated curriculum tailored to the mental capacity and the stages of development of the students. The nine conditions for the student are 1. purity of character; 2. a readiness to ask questions and a critical spirit that does not accept blindly all that he is taught, but nevertheless acknowledges the greater experience of the teacher; 3. unconcern with \u0002nancial and family matters; 4. mastery at \u0002rst of the principles of a given discipline and then only of its details, so as to be able to face doubts and differences of opinion, even if, at the beginning, it is better for the student to shy away from them and to trust the teacher; 5. some degree of familiarity with all the various differences of opinion, since they clarify each other (as taught in Aristotelian philosophy); 6. constant re\u0003ection on the relationship of knowledge, virtuous action, and livelihood; 7. a sel\u0003ess devotion to knowledge with no ulterior motives, from which no lack of progress in his studies should discourage him; 8. a willingness to seek out a good teacher (corresponding to the Muslim travel in quest of knowledge); and 9. a great respect for the teacher, bordering on reverence. The curriculum, \u0002nally, runs the full gamut from the Jewish religious sciences to all the disciplines in the Graeco-Muslim canon of the sciences.At about the same time, around the end of the twelfth century, 148 Cf. above, pp. 94 f.

Convinced that knowledge and action are the means through which the Creator has given mankind distinction and superiority over everything else in the world, and realizing that many eager students are frustrated in their desire for knowledge, because they do not know how to go about its acquisition, az-Zarnûjî has written a brief handbook for students on the basis of what he himself had learned on the subject from his teachers. Knowledge is a distinctive characteristic of man. It places Adam above the angels. There are various sciences. Some of them are useful, others are harmful. Understandably, az-Zarnûjî shows throughout a predilection for jurisprudence as the discipline most useful for the community and most highly regarded by him. The intention with which a student approaches the process of learning is as important and decisive here as in any other activity. Studying should be done for the sake of God. It is pernicious to do any studying for worldly purposes. It is imperative for the student to choose the right teacher, and he must always be intent upon keeping the right company. He must be aware of the value of asking for advice. Certain qualities are needed by the student as well as by the teacher. Students must have the deepest respect for knowledge, for their teachers, and for books. Studying is a never ending enterprise, and great and constant efforts must be spent on studying “from the cradle to the grave” (min al-mahd ilâ l-la\u0003d).151 149 I have used the edition of the Arabic text by C.

Az-Zarnûjî was born around 550/1155, since he mentions as his authorities, among others, Imâmzâdeh Mu\bammad b. Abî Bakr (491–573/1098–1177 or 1178, cf. \u0003Abd-al-Qâdir al-Qurashî, Jawâhir, II, 36 [Hyderabad 1332/1913–14]) and \u0004ammâd b. Ibrâhîm a\t-affâr (493–576/1100–1180 or 1181, cf. Jawâhir, I, 224). He ought to have been at least in his later teens when he studied with the Imâmzâdeh. In the case of a\t-affâr, it is not absolutely necessary to assume that az-Zarnûjî was born long before his death.150 Cf. \u0003Abd-al-Qâdir al-Qurashî, Jawâhir, I, 224.151 Another similar phrase is applicable only to the accomplished scholar: ma\u0002a l-ma\u0003barah ilâ l-maqbarah “with the inkstand to the grave,” cf. Ibn al-Jawzî, Manâqib al-Imâm A\u0003mad b. \tanbal, 31 (Cairo 1349).ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 29510/17/2006 5:16:26 PM"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"296 knowledge is societyStudying also requires great sacri\u0002ces, a rigorous training of the memory, a great measure of austerity, and a complete unconcern for worldly affairs and material well-being. Az-Zarnûjî, however, is desperately aware of the \u0002nancial problems of students and the inevitable necessity of making a living. He even goes so far as to state expressly how advantageous it is for the student who wishes to be able to devote himself to his studies to have suf\u0002cient \u0002nancial resources. “A rich father,” he reports, was the reply of a scholar who was asked what had enabled him to attain his scholarly eminence. In general, the ideas expressed by men such as al-\u0003Askarî and those of the scholarly representatives of religious knowledge have come together and merged in the work of az-Zarnûjî. It is slight in size and also in intellectual outlook, but it summarizes well the position of knowledge in Muslim societal thought and practice.Of the subsequent educational literature, only one work may be brie\u0003y considered here, the Tadhkirat as-sâmi\u0002 wa-l-mutakallim fî adab al-\u0002âlim wa-l-muta\u0002allim by the Shâ\u0002\u0003ite Ibn Jamâ\u0003ah (d. 733/1333).152 It is a systematic recapitulation of the views on higher education in the religious sciences (meaning, principally, the science of traditions), undertaken in the spirit of the Kha\u0006îb al-Baghdâdî and al-Ghazzâlî and using, it seems, largely their material. The Tadhkirah does not deal at all with elementary education, except, perhaps, in some isolated instances such as the incidental admonition for students to sit before their professors as children do before the teacher of the Qur\u0002ân.153 By the time of Ibn Jamâ\u0003ah, higher education had long been fully institutionalized and was centered entirely in the madrasah. This necessitated a chapter on the choice of the right college as well as college administration and college life.154 The dependence on the written word at all levels of instruction demanded another chapter on the production and handling of books.155 Ibn Jamâ\u0003ah feels that \u0003usn al-adab, which for him is education in the widest sense including good manners and behavior and proper methods of teaching and studying, is particularly 152 Cf. the edition published in Hyderabad 1353.

They include the customary warning against all studying undertaken for worldly gain and not for the love of God. Ibn Jamâ\u0003ah carefully details one by one the personal qualities required in professors and in students and the attitudes and behavior of professors toward their students and of students toward their professors. The twin fundamental qualities a professor must possess are dignity and piety. He must observe great decorum in the way he dresses and the like and, indeed, in everything he does. But he must also be properly modest. Above all, he must always remain willing to learn even from those younger and of a lower status than himself, as con\u0002rmed by the fact that “a number of the ancient Muslims used to acquire knowledge they themselves did not have from their students.”157 It is the professor’s duty to write and to publish.158 In his teaching, he must follow a suitable gradated method of instruction. He must try to overcome the bashfulness of students, test their progress from time to time,159 and, in general, show concern and consideration for them and for their welfare. Students must basically possess the same qualities of earnestness and piety as professors. In all their ways, they must guard the proper decorum, particularly in class or whenever they are in the company of their professors. They must choose the right company. While all frivolity must be avoided, they ought to allow themselves some occasional recreation.160 More than anything else, they must have, and show, the greatest respect for their teachers in all conceivable situations. They may harbor doubts as to the correctness of the one or other statement made by their professors, but they always ought to try to resolve such doubts in the most tactful manner. Matters of the greatest importance for students are the acquisition of proper study habits and procedures, the selection of the proper course of study, and the punctilious observance of all the minutiae of a decorous class room behavior.161The great interest of the Tadhkirah lies in all these details and in all the wise and pungent remarks on particular aspects of the 156 Cf.

Only a complete translation could bring out its richness.162 For the history of knowledge, it is interesting, though hardly surprising, to \u0002nd Ibn Jama\u0003ah fully convinced that his work holds the key to the one knowledge deserving of the name and to the only thing that is of importance to the individual as well as to society. He is fully convinced of the supreme validity of the tradition stating that “the rank of knowledge is the rank of the heritage of the prophets” and that “the scholars are the heirs of the prophets.”163 The ways and aims of elementary education are established and no longer need much literary discussion. The ways and aims of higher education are also no longer in doubt, although they remain of interest to scholars who like to restate them from time to time. All education, having as it does “knowledge” for its beginning and its end, serves to assure the continuity of a truly Muslim civilization and a truly Muslim society.4. Materials for an Appraisal of Knowledge as a Societal ForceMuslim authors showed a decided preference for stressing the positive role of knowledge in society. Negative factors were played down and ultimately rejected, but they were not entirely disregarded. The indispensability of knowledge for any human societal organization is obvious. We would, however, hesitate to assert without quali\u0002cation that it can be usefully de\u0002ned and believed in as the truly supreme force in society. An aura of utopianism clings to the powerful Platonic concept of the philosopher-king, and there is indeed reason to question whether under given human conditions, the triumph of “knowledge” could lead to the most viable of social orders. The re\u0003ections made by Muslim scholars do not resolve the quandary. A presentation of what appears to be some of the crucial features of the discussion may, however, help us in establishing the degree of insight reached by them with regard to the real or ideal position of knowledge in the material and intellectual struggle of man to organize his life.162 In the absence of such a translation, al-Ghazzâlî’s book on knowledge from the I\u0003yâ\b may be consulted. As always, al-Ghazzâlî’s treatment of the subject was pivotal for all subsequent discussion, but since it has been mentioned before and is easily accessible, it has been thought unnecessary to devote more space to it here.163 Cf. Ibn Jamâ\u0003ah, Tadhkirah, 27, 48.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 29810/17/2006 5:16:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":" materials for an appraisal of knowledge 299The Attitude Toward DoubtIt has been said that the Greek religious view of the world was dominated by the antithesis of knowledge of the Gods and the lack of such knowledge, whereas the Christian antithesis was that of faith and doubt.164 In Islam, both views contend with each other. However, even more than ignorance, doubt suffered from the stigma of religious connotations from which it was never able to free itself.There are several words for doubt in Arabic, but shakk became the accepted technical term. Shubhah is also much used, and it is the favorite legal term for suspicion and indecision as to the legality of a given view or activity. Shubhah presents no real dif\u0002culty for its derivation from the Arabic root sh-b-h in its common meaning of being alike or similar; it is the similarity of two sides, of two possible answers, that leads to two-sidedness or ambiguity and the resulting attitude of doubt.165 Another word, rayb, is easily etymologized through its occurrences in other Semitic languages such as Hebrew rîb “strife”; the transition from strife, quarrel, being disturbed, and the like, to doubt is easily explainable (there is no quarrel concerning something = there can be no doubt concerning it). However, in the case of shakk, we are at a loss for a plausible etymology which could give us some insight into the psychological dimensions of the Muslim attitude toward doubt. The Arabic root has been connected with Hebrew s-k-k (= [ ?] \u0004-k-k) “to cover, to weave together (for screening purposes),” hence, to be complicated, to be stuck on something.166 The root combination of sibilant followed by a doubled k or g in Semitic languages 164 Cf. H. Dörrie, Emanation, in K. Flasch (ed.), Parusia . . . Festgabe für Johannes Hirschberger, 130 (Frankfurt a. M. 1965).165 \u0003Alî is credited with the curious statement that shubhah is so called because it resembles (tushbih) the truth, cf. Nahj al-balâghah, 97; Ibn Abî l-\u0004adîd, I, 481. For the alleged difference between shakk and irtiyâb, cf. al-\u0003Askarî, Furûq, 80.166 Cf. S. Fraenkel, Die aramäischen Fremdwörter im Arabischen, 90, n. 2 (Leiden 1886). Fraenkel’s suggestion was noted with hesitant approval in the sixteenth edition, prepared by F. Buhl, of Gesenius’ Handwörterbuch über das Alle Testament, 543a (Leipzig 1915). It was implicitly rejected by L. Koehler, Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti libros, 657a (Leiden 1951). It may be the same root, with the somewhat altered meaning of “to penetrate, to intermingle,” that was used by Muslim philologians to derive the meaning of “doubt,” cf. al-\u0003Askarî, Furûq, 79: “Shakk ‘doubt’ comes from shakakta something if you combine it with something you insert into it. Doubt is the combination of two things in the mind.”ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 29910/17/2006 5:16:27 PM"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"300 knowledge is societyexpresses other concrete meanings that may be connected with “doubt.” The closest correspondence in meaning appears in Hebrew she6\u00066\u0006h “error,” but the phonetic correspondence is somewhat remote. A combination with the root w-sh-k is not entirely excluded. Since the connotation of w-sh-k seems to focus on the idea of quickness, “doubt” may be something like rashness, instability, going astray. This would tally with the suggested derivation of \u0002ilm.167 However, there is also the more appealing possibility that sh-k-k is a secondary root to be combined with Hebrew \u0004-k-h “to look (at something, either expectantly or apprehensively),” Syrian sakkî “to hope,” Arabic shakâ “to complain.” This would provide a perfect parallel to Greek skeptikos.168 But maybe, it is just too perfect to recommend itself to the skeptical linguist.Doubt in whichever way indicated became the true pariah and outcast of Muslim civilization. It stands for all that is to be shunned like the plague. No worse fate can befall man than being tossed into the sea of doubts and left there to \u0003ounder and possibly to drown. Doubt in itself is a suf\u0002cient manifestation of ignorance.169 It was unthinkable for the Prophet to harbor even the slightest of doubts. Therefore, when he said, “I am more liable to doubt than Ibrâhîm,” it could mean only that since the Prophet had no doubts, Abraham is even less likely to have had any doubts.170 The \u0003adîth occurs in connection with Abraham’s implied doubting of God’s ability to revive the dead (Qur\u0002ân 2:260/262). The Qur\u0002ânic passage naturally worried the commentators a good deal. According to az-Zamakhsharî, “necessary knowledge” admits of no expression of doubt, as against “knowledge arrived at through deduction,” which does.171 Ibn \u0004ajar explains that doubt as understood in logic is incompatible with prophethood, but there is another kind of doubt which may be described as “uncon\u0002rmed ideas” (al-khawâ\u000fir allatî lâ tathbut); such doubt could occur to prophets such as Abraham.172The principal weapon of heretics and unbelievers in their perpetual 167 Cf. above, pp. 10 ff.168 Arabic n-\u0012-r, na\u0012ar is also used to indicate that something is a matter of debate.169 Kafâ bi-sh-shakk jahlan, cf. az-Zamaksharî, Mustaq\u0015â, II, 167 (Hyderabad 1381/1962).

Ibn al-Muqaffa\u0003 added “Burzôê’s Introduction” to Kalîlah wa-Dimnah, in order to cause Muslims of weak faith to doubt Islam and to make them an easy prey to Manichaean propaganda.173 âli\b b. \u0003Abd-al-Quddûs, one of those suspected of being a Manichaean (zindîq), is said to have grieved about his dead son, because the latter’s death had made it impossible for him to read âli\b’s “Book of Doubts” which made the reader doubt everything.174 In the early tenth century, ar-Râzî possibly thought that he was stressing the positive character of his research if he used the title of “Doubts” concerning Proclus or Galen.175 But much later, it was a witty way of striking a devastating critical blow to call the Tâ\bîyah of the controversial mystic, Ibn al-Fâri\r, which had the title of Na\u0012m as-shulûk “The Mystic Path Versi\u0002ed,” by the slightly-changed title of Na\u0012m ash-shukûk “Doubts Versi\u0002ed.”176 Whether engendered through human mischief or innate Satanic weakness, doubt was man’s mortal enemy, depriving him of the certainty that his religion was intended and equipped to give him. If a troubled individual looked for a savior from error, as al-Ghazzâlî did in his spiritual autobiography, it was a search for deliverance from all nagging doubts and uncertainties.Greek logic and philosophy taught its Muslim followers to think about doubt and to take it in stride as an ineluctable, if regrettable, stage of the dialectic process. Some information on the existence of an ancient philosophical school professing skepticism \u0002ltered down to the Muslim Middle Ages. Known as al-Mâni\u0002ah, a translation, via Syriac kâlôyê, of Ephektikoi, one of the Greek designations for the Skeptics, it was de\u0002ned as “a group which hindered and prevented people from (acquiring) knowledge.” Its attitude toward knowledge was rather lengthily and, in a way, dispassionately 173 Cf. al-Bîrûnî, India, ed.

The discussion of Skepticism, however, did not make use of the term “doubt” and therefore contributed only indirectly to the frequent warnings against the futility and perniciousness of doubt.177 The speculative theologians178 attached the label of “Sophists” to the representatives of epistemological skepticism. The problem of doubt as such was little involved here,179 but the horri\u0002ed condemnation of the Sophists’ stand applied just as well to the mortal danger caused by doubt. The views ascribed to the Sophists were thought so outrageous and impossible that it was seriously suggested, apparently by some traditionist religious scholars, that the Sophists were an invention of the speculative theologians in their efforts to undermine the simple true faith of Islam.180The speculative theologians did ponder the problems of doubt as one of the opposites of knowledge. They did so with a view to the particular doubt in the existence of God.

Kraemer stresses the religious foundation and orientation of Muslim skepticism, as contrasted to the secular skepticism of the West.178 With regard to the Sophists, the philosophers in Islam may have followed the lead of the speculative theologians, rather than vice versa.

However, the view of Abû Hâshim (al-Jubbâ\u0002î) and, supposedly, Abû Bakr (al-Bâqillânî) that doubt concerning God is obligatory, because logical speculation which customarily has doubt as its starting point is necessary (wâjib), is considered subject at least to the quali\u0002cation that it is not something about which man could have initially the power of decision. On the other hand, it is not impossible that he is under the obligation to continue doubting, because he has the power to decide to remove doubt through logical speculation, and it is, indeed, obligatory, because man is required to gain knowledge of God (which presupposes that at some stage, he does not have such knowledge, and doubting is the \u0002rst step toward it).181 But apart from all such subtle reasoning, the common belief was that necessarily and simply, doubt in God was unbelief.182For a brief while, and with some lingering aftereffects, a more positive appreciation of the possible bene\u0002ts of a skeptical approach marked by doubt found hesitant expression. The doubting attitude attributed to eighth-century \u0002gures such as Ibn al-Muqaffa\u0003 and âli\b b. \u0003Abd-al-Quddûs resulted from sincere attempts to bolster or, at worst, to replace traditional Muslim beliefs through rational, critical methods. To the glory of the Mu\u0003tazilah, it can be said that within their ranks, there existed convinced champions of doubt, as evidenced by a noteworthy passage from the Kitâb al-\tayawân by al-Jâ\bi\u000e.183 In connection with the need of scientists to be skeptical of all transmitted information and to check it always with all the means at their disposal, al-Jâ\bi\u000e speaks of the more general applicability of the critical scientist’s attitude to the problem of cognition as such, citing the opinions of contemporaries of his, among them the great an-Na\u000e\u000eâm:“Recognize the occasions and situations necessitating doubt, so 181 Cf. al-Âmidî, Abkâr, in Ms. Aya Sofya 2165, fol. 13b (cf. above, p. 228).

They are not agreed on (the existence of ) degrees of strength and weakness in certainty.When Abû l-Jahm said to al-Makkî,184 ‘I hardly have doubts,’ al-Makkî replied, ‘I hardly have certainty.’ Al-Makkî wanted to show that he felt superior to (Abû l-Jahm), because he had doubts when doubts were called for, whereas Ibn al-Jahm wanted to show that he felt superior to (al-Makkî), because he had certainty when certainty was called for.Abû Is\bâq (an-Na\u000e\u000eâm) said: I have had disputations with both doubters and deniers among heretics,185 and I have found that the doubters have a better insight into the essence of theological speculation (kalâm) than the deniers. Abû Is\bâq also said: The doubter is closer to you than the denier. Never has there been any certainty, unless there was doubt before. Nor did anyone ever switch from one belief to another without an intervening situation of doubt.Ibn al-Jahm said: I truly long for the conversion (that falls to the lot) of those beset by uncertainty (muta\u0003ayyir).

Another reading: “with doubters and heretics,” would remove the doubters from the category of heretics.186 The variant reading “certainty” seems more to the point, but the more dif\u0002cult “clarity” deserves preference. The difference between the two words in Arabic writing is very small.187 The two statements that follow here have no apparent connection with the subject of skepticism.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 30410/17/2006 5:16:29 PM"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":" materials for an appraisal of knowledge 305possibility, that of doubt, which comprises the various degrees of doubt, according to the presence or absence of suspicion with regard to reasons for (taking or not taking a doubting attitude) and according to the various measure of likelihood.A man with some experience in speculative thought heard scholars approve of some doubt.

The aforementioned discussion of later speculative theologians on the applicability of doubt in connection with the existence of God contains echoes of this Mu\u0003tazilah attitude. These men belonged among those who like Robert Browning’s Rabbi Ben Ezra exclaimed, “Rather I prize the doubt,” considering it an instrument of intellectual vitality and growth. It would be unfair to deny them recognition and admiration for having seized upon the most effective approach to intellectual progress. Unfortunately, they chose, if they had a choice in this matter, the metaphysical realm for the testing ground of their ideas. The very fact of their faith in doubt as a means toward true religious faith all but obliterated their memory.A longer lasting witness to a hesitant recognition of the effec-tiveness of doubt is a saying ascribed to a Greek scholar known as \bllynws: “Asked why he was always professing doubt, he replied: In defense of certainty (dhabban \u0002an al-yaqîn).”189 The remark occurs within a small group of sayings of which one can be securely related 188 “Blame” would be easier, but al-Jâ\bi\u000e seems to mean that he wants to forego here praising something that others might \u0002nd deserving of blame.189 Cf.

This assumption is hardly refuted by the fact that the same remark, with only the replacement of dhabban by the synonymous mu\u0003âmâtan but in the same question-and-answer form, appears in the \u0002Uyûn of Ibn Qutaybah where it is ascribed to an ancient Muslim transmitter of traditions, Raqabah b. Ma\tqalah (or Masqalah), whose death is placed in 129/746–47.191 Both the authority to which it is ascribed, and the setting in which it occurs, make it likely that the remark was understood to mean nothing more than that a wary skepticism is indicated with respect to the acceptance of material transmitted as Prophetical traditions. General wariness as part of the prudent behavior of intelligent persons is also considered by ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî as the meaning of the remark.192 His Mu\u0003â\u000earât include a brief chapter entitled “Praise, and Blame, of Doubt and a Suspicious Attitude (sû\b a\u0012-\u0012ann).” It contains a versi\u0002cation of the remark by a certain Abû Mu\bammad al-Khâzin:193My doubting, even if I do much of it, is merelyProtection for things that are certain.Ar-Râghib further quotes the statement of an unnamed authority to the effect that “the comfort of certainty is obtained through the discomfort of doubt.” For the rest, he dwells on the need for skepticism before engaging in an undertaking or putting one’s trust into another individual. The interpretation given to the remark on doubt leading to certainty by a succession of Muslim scholars plays down its signi\u0002cance. Still, in its origin, it would seem to have been a strong endorsement of the value of skepticism in the search for knowledge, and its force may occasionally have been felt.As shakk “doubt” was contrasted with yaqîn “certainty” and \u0002ilm “knowledge,” so was \u0012ann “guessing, guesswork.” The little esteem expressed for \u0012ann in the Qur\u0002ân 53:28/29 was not universally shared later on, nor was the absolute unacceptability of \u0012ann 190 Cf.

Some guessing was even hailed as being equal to certain knowledge.195 Ptolemy is credited with the remark that “guessing is the key to certainty.”196 Plato is represented as having said that “guesses are the keys to certainty, and visualizing things in the imagination provides the introduction to clarity.”197 Another remark ascribed to Plato is added: “If you have doubts about something, leave it alone and act in accordance with what you do not have doubts about.198 Doubting (irtiyâb) certainty is suf\u0002cient information for you, and guessing gives you enough clarity.” The aphorism of “guessing being the key to certainty” was transformed into a verse by a poet who in one source remains anonymous and in another, is called Sa\u0003îd b. \u0004umayd.199 The poet’s direct model is claimed to have been: “Sound guessing is the beginning of certainty.” In the form, “guesses are the keys to certainty,” the idea is presented as a common saying in the \u0002Uyûn,200 but it was even attributed to Ardash\u0007r.201 The \u0002Iqd cites the caliph \u0003Umar to the effect that “he who does not bene\u0002t from his guesses does not bene\u0002t from his certainty,”202 and also reports the saying that “an intelligent man’s guesswork is divination.”203 Although Muslim authors tend to bracket shakk with \u0012ann, the terms hold approximately the same difference in meaning as do its English equivalents.

The expression “no doubt” which was much used in medieval Arabic was quite frequently an emphatic and meaningful assertion that everything was all right, rather than the hesitant equivocation it almost always implies in our modern usage. One scholar could compliment another by saying that “I like your doubt better than my certainty,”206 in order to indicate the sure grasp of his knowledge which made doubts insigni\u0002cant by comparison. Sectarians (ahl al-hawâ) were beset by doubt, something that brought them into being in the \u0002rst place, and they were always disunited and lacked the monolithic strength that held the Muslim community together.207 Doubt was not prized, except by the few who by and large remained silent, or were silenced. In contrast to the belief of Xenophanes at the very beginnings of Greek philosophy,208 certainty (al-yaqîn = to saphes) with regard to matters divine and everything else did exist for Muslims and was apparent to man. Knowledge not affected by doubt was passionately believed to be within the easy reach of every believer. What this meant for the history of knowledge in Muslim society need not be spelled out for the modern Western observer.Limitations on Individual KnowledgeDoubt in the existence of knowledge and in man’s ability to acquire it and make it useful for his purposes was not generally tolerated. However, the extent to which man as an individual was able to master the vast amount of knowledge in the world was another matter. In this respect, the prevailing mood was a moderate degree of realistic pessimism. Scholars learned in a given discipline 205 Cf. al-Îjî, in Rosenthal, A History of Muslim Historiography, 201 ff.206 Cf. Ibn Qutaybah, \u0002Uyûn, II, 139; Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 217.

Considering the limited state of development reached by many disciplines in the Middle Ages, this may often have been not all too far from the truth. However, the production of knowledge was viewed as a continuing process where the former generations always left much to do for the later ones,209 and it was pointed out already by al-Jâ\bi\u000e,210 as it was later on by Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr,211 that the prevalence of the opposite view that the early scholars had left nothing to be done for later scholars was harmful to scholars and scholarship. The totality of knowledge was known only to the totality of men,212 even if Muslims were customarily inclined to make an exception for the Prophet (and, perhaps, the Shî\u0003ah imâms) and \u0003attery was often expressed in a verse saying that God cannot be reproached for having concentrated the whole world in one person. The limitations of individual knowledge in certain well developed disciplines and vis-à-vis the totality of the constantly growing accumulation of knowledge were obvious, and the social signi\u0002cance of this fact was realized. While intelligence is a human characteristic and potentially active in every human being. Ibn \u0004azm’s view that most people were stupid and that the number of intelligent men was very small213 was probably shared by the majority.

Both the vastness of knowledge and the natural dynamics of the process of learning required that it never stopped. If a ûfî pointed out that it made as little sense for a warrior to spend all his life equipping himself as it did for a scholar to gather knowledge, he referred to the need for action.214 He did not wish to imply that the search for more military equipment or for better knowledge should ever stop, but he felt that it was not possible for any single human being to wait for its completion, before he put his accomplishments to use. The saddest moment in the life of a philosopher such as Abû l-\u0003Abbâs al-Lawkarî came when he realized that old age and physical debility made it impossible for him to go on learning and add to his knowledge.215We often hear scholars castigate the “compound ignorance” de\u0002ned as a person’s not knowing that he does not know. Human failure with regard to the possession of comprehensive knowledge was most commonly and universally acknowledged by the constant repetition of the command to admit one’s ignorance, if such was the case. “Saying, \u0003I do not know,’ constitutes one half of knowledge” is both a Prophetical tradition and a saying found in Graeco-Arabic wisdom literature.216 The phrase most widely recommended for use was lâ adrî “I do not know.” Aristotle was described as saying that he was so fond of using it that he used it also in cases where he possessed the required knowledge.217 No educational device is omitted to hallow its constant employment.218 A somewhat 214 Cf.

He expressed anger at people who in discussing a passage of the Qur\u0002ân made use of them, when in his opinion, they should have said either “we know” or “we don’t know.”220 The use of Allâh a\u0002lam might have been appropriate in the case of ordinary people and ordinary subjects, but scholarship and the importance of the subject matter made an unequivocal statement preferable in this case.The unwillingness to admit one’s ignorance and the perpetual scholarly exhortation to overcome this harmful attitude were, of course, not exclusively Islamic. The closest predecessor to Muslim civilization, the Syriac Church, knew about it, and the great Aphrem stated the case in these words: “But this which I have mentioned is found in the case of great sages, namely, that one confesses, ‘I do not know.’ For this is their great knowledge that if they do not know a thing, they confess that they do not know it.”221 In Islam where knowledge acquired tremendous signi\u0002cance for an individual’s social standing, the temptation to claim knowledge where there was none was a great danger for the entire fabric of society. It was constantly warned against in the educational literature and in the re\u0003ections of scholars about the alleged or real decay of their specialties. In its most succinct form, this warning \u0002nds its endlessly repeated expression in the numerous variations on the theme of the use of lâ adrî.Philosophy in the name of Plato and Aristotle popularized the notion of the general insuf\u0002ciency of human knowledge. It impressed itself deeply upon Muslim consciousness, as indicated by of its material, this rather exhaustive treatment of the subject refers to \u0003Abdallâh b. Wahb and his Kitâb al-Majâlis. It is clear that the basic canon of all these traditions was move or less \u0002xed by the early eighth century.

The Democritean version appears in Arabic also in the form of the sage’s attribution of his great knowledge to “my recognition (ma\u0002rifah) that my knowledge is small.”227 A rather close rendition of the Socratic version, but with some fancy trimmings, comes to us from Ibn Hindû: “Socrates said: I often used to dream that I was the most learned of my contemporaries. I could not \u0002nd myself deserving of this description except by 222 In addition to Plato, this saying is also ascribed to Hippocrates (in another passage of al-Mubashshir, 50), when it is not anonymous as, for instance, in Ibn Qutaybah, \u0002Uyûn, II, 126; al-Mâwardî, Adab, 44; ar-Râghib al-I\tfahânî, Mu\u0003â\u000earât, I, 23. Al-Mubashshir, 177, quotes the Platonic saying that Plato knew only that he did not know, during his entire stay in this world, cf. Rosenthal, Technique and Approach, 63a, n. 3.223 The only noticeable variation in the wording of this saying occurs in connection with this particular word. It is tathbît an in a version going under the name of Plato, cf. al-Mubashshir, 167, and al-Mukhtâr min kalâm al-\u0003ukamâ\b al-arba\u0002ah, in Ms. Aya Sofya 2460, fol. 33a–b. A minor variant, or rather, a mistake, is tathabbut an in \u0004unayn, Nawâdir, fol. 56b. Ibn Qutaybah, \u0002Uyûn, II, 126, has sababan, which must be corrected to tathbît an. However, in the case of the saying’s attribution to Socrates, the word used is ikhbâr an, cf. al-Mubashshir, 125; Ibn Abî U\taybi\u0003ah, \u0002Uyûn al-anbâ\b, ed. A. Müller, I, 49 (Cairo and Königsberg 1882–84). Where the saying is connected with Archigenes, dalîlan is used (cf. al-Mubashshir, 302; Rosenthal, Fortleben, 179, no. 50). Thus, all three versions occur in al-Mubashshir in different places. It would seem a plausible assumption that they represent three different translations of the same saying as attributed to different authorities.224 Cf.

I was surprised, because I was aware that I did not deserve this description, but revelation never lies. Thus, I deserve this description, because I know that I do not know, whereas other people do not know and do not know that they do not know.”228 Ibn Hindû goes on quoting an Arabic verse to the effect that “the poor fellow does not know that he does not know.” The verse rather castigates “compound ignorance” and does not aim at praising the philosopher’s despair of achieving true knowledge. This is also the case in the verse cited by Usâmah b. Munqidh:You are ignorant, and you do not know that you are ignorant.I wish I could see to it that you know that you do not know.Ibn Munqidh, however, also mentions a versi\u0002cation of the Socratic saying:Is it not remarkable that I am a manMighty in disputation, subtle in the choice of words,Who dies with his soul possessing as its only knowledgeThe knowledge that he has no knowledge?229It is understandable that this great Greek idea re-occurs in a passage allegedly of Persian origin that says that “it is part of knowledge to know that you do not know.”230 On the other hand, it would have been most inappropriate to put this remark into the mouth of the Prophet, and this seems not to have been done. In fact, some resistance to its implications appears to have been current. It is missing in a good many adab works where it might be expected to have made its appearance. The reason for disregarding it could have been the triteness that must have accrued to it over the years, as well as the fact that it was so closely allied to Hellenism. However, an aversion to the moderate skepticism implied in it is more likely to have made it objectionable to many Muslims. Mere chance, or stylistic considerations, may likewise not have been the reason why the second half of the Mu\u0003tazilah saying cited at the outset of the present book was omitted by some of the authors who reported it in later centuries.231 While the dif\u0002-228 Cf.

In a society which had come to accept the supremacy of the concept of knowledge, it was, perhaps, possible to harbor some misgivings as to the possibility of the realization in practice of full and certain knowledge, but many were naturally reluctant to admit the possession of such misgivings either to themselves or to others.Personal Failings of ScholarsThe educational literature never ceases repeating that scholars should be modest and humble. Haughtiness and conceit were generally considered the primordial danger and curse of scholarship. Iblîs, while he was still answering to the name of \u0003Azâzîl and was not yet the devil, was the strongest among the angels in independent judgment and possessed the greatest amount of knowledge. This was what made him haughty.232 The angels in a body claimed to be, if not better than the newly created Adam, then at least more knowledgeable than he, because they had existed before him. While they were thus admiring their own knowledge, they suffered a grim setback. It was Adam who was taught by God all the names. Thus, he came into the possession of a knowledge vastly greater than theirs.233 Again, knowledge proved a temptation, this time for the new human race. Cain killed Abel, because he was envious of the knowledge that Adam had speci\u0002cally entrusted to him. Therefore, Adam later on entrusted the book containing his last will and testament—and with it, apparently, the sum and substance of his vast knowledge—to Seth and ordered him to keep it concealed from Cain and his progeny.234 And so it went through all of history. The Qârûn (Korah) of the Qur\u0002ân became overbearing because of his knowledge (Qur\u0002ân 28:78/78). His behavior was all the more sinful and destructive, because he claimed to possess a kind of real knowledge which, in fact, he did not possess. When Jesus was hailed with the words, “Blessed be the womb that bore you,” he retorted, “Blessed be the one whom God taught His Book and 232 Cf. a\u0006-\u0005abarî, Annales, I, 83.233 Cf. a\u0006-\u0005abarî, Annales, I, 99 f.234 Cf. a\u0006-\u0005abarî, Annales, I, 159 f.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 31410/17/2006 5:16:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":" materials for an appraisal of knowledge 315who did not be(come) a tyrant.”235 There is the famous tradition of the Prophet in which he censures those who seek knowledge in order to be able to contend and vie with scholars. It was extended to include, among scholarly failings, an attitude of hostility toward stupid people and the desire to draw attention to oneself.236 The tradition was part of the campaign directed against the tendency of scholars to “study for this world” which was blamed constantly. In adh-Dhahabî’s list of major sins, it was ranked as one, between hypocrisy and deceit.237 Knowledge should be studied for its own sake, but, alas, it seems there never was a period when this precept was widely practiced.I have seen the people of our timeSeek knowledge not for the sake of knowledge,But for vying with their colleaguesAnd for being equipped for tyrannizing and wronging others.238Studying for the world deprives scholars of their heavenly reward in the other world. In a more secular vein, it robs knowledge of its sweetness and splendor.239 In adh-Dhahabî’s list of major sins, it is combined with the equally grave sin of “concealing knowledge” which means the death of the social usefulness of knowledge. While knowledge must not be imparted to those who do not deserve it or are not capable of understanding it, it must also not be withheld from the deserving240 by some so-called scholar for sel\u0002sh reasons, in order to promote his own standing in the world. The transmission and spread of knowledge bring it to fruition. Besides, it is also pointed out frequently that the communication235 Cf. Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Bahjah, I, 438. The quotation is from Luke 11:27 f. Jesus’ reply there is, “. . . who hear the word of God and keep (it).” This, of course, is rather different from the Arabic text, which may have added some echo of Psalms 1:1. The use of gibbôr in Psalms 112:2 should be noted, but contrary to the jabbâr of the Arabic text, it is a positive term there.236 Cf. above, p. 172, n. 2.237 Cf. adh-Dhahabî, Kitâb al-Kabâ\bir, 140–43 (Cairo 1385/1965).238 Cf. az-Zamakhsharî, Rabî\u0002, in Ms. Yale L-5, fol. 184b; Ibn al-Jawzî, Manâqib al-Imâm A\u0003mad b. \tanbal, 148; al-Ibshîhî, Musta\u000fraf, I, 24.

Instead of “tyrannizing” (al-ghashm), which appears to be the best reading, Ibn al-Jawzî has something like “winning disputes” (al-kha\u0015m), and al-Ibshîhî has “cheating” (al-ghashsh).239 Cf. al-Mubashshir, 323, who speaks of knowledge and wisdom.240 On this topic, cf., for instance, Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Jâmi\u0002, I, 110 f.ROSENTHAL-f10_240-333.indd 31510/17/2006 5:16:32 PM"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"316 knowledge is societyof knowledge to others results in an increase of knowledge. “The charity tax (zakâh) to be levied on knowledge is teaching those who have not enough knowledge . . . Such a tax is even more necessary in the case of knowledge, as knowledge is increased by spending. Knowledge, it has been said, is like hair. Whenever some hair is shaved off, it grows back more strongly. If it is not shaved off, it retains its \u0002xed size to which it grows back when it is clipped. Left alone, it does not go beyond it.”241Failures of this sort and faulty character traits make up the “evil scholar” (\u0002âlim as-sû\b\u0005). We hear much about the harm he causes to himself and, above all, to society. His harmfulness was stressed by the representatives of secular learning, too, but, basically, the \u0002gure of the evil scholar was one inspired by religion. Shades of the New Testament are unmistakable in the preference shown for statements ascribed to Jesus concerning evil scholars.242 Scholars were expected to have the proper qualities as established in the generally accepted canon of ethics. Apparently in this sense, \u0003Abdallâh b. al-Mubârak claimed that there was greater need among men of religion for a little adab than for much knowledge.243The learned also have to observe society’s rules concerning morality. The “wicked scholar” (al-\u0002âlim al-fâsiq) was the frequent target of concerned educators. He is the worst of men, according to a remark ascribed to Jesus.244 Wâ\til b. \u0003A\u0006â\u0002, however, also warned against men who were pious but at the same time stupid. Together with wicked scholars, they belonged to the most harmful type of human beings. In the case of wicked scholars, knowledge suffered harm, because their knowledge was sure to be rejected on account of their wickedness. In the case of those who were pious and stupid, the harm was done through the spread of ignorance, since their piety was sure to make people accept their ignorance. Moderation in both directions was, according to Wâ\til, what promised the best hope for future salvation.245 Here, as so often, the thrust is against piety and in favor of knowledge. However, \u0002sq “wickedness,” that is, moral misbehavior in the widest sense, was considered a 241 Cf. Ibn Bu\u0006lân, Da\u0002wat al-a\u000fibbâ\b, 20 (n.p., n.y.).242 Cf., for instance, al-Kha\u0006îb al-Baghdâdî, Iqti\u000eâ\b, 195 f.243 Cf. above, p. 174, and Usâmah b.

A pious man could not be “wicked,” if he was to be deserving of being called pious in the \u0002rst place. The socially unacceptable actions of a scholar nullify his usefulness for society.246Constantly repeated warnings of this sort indicate clearly that the conditions warned against were thought to be quite prevalent, and probably were. The emphatic condemnations of “studying for this world” suf\u0002ce by themselves to show that many scholars did just that. They also seem to clash strangely with the strongly held and frequently enounced thesis that knowledge brings worldly material success. As usual, a verse tells the whole story:The search for knowledge (\u0003ulûm) means much humiliation.The neglect of it means grievous af\u0003iction.Thus, bear with the search for knowledge, forAfter humiliation, it means high rank and position.247The optimistic note was triumphantly sounded by \u0003adîth scholars who already in the ninth century were con\u0002dent of ultimately taking over political power, as did, in fact, happen, and they ascribed the defeatist negativism to their Mu\u0003tazilah adversaries. This situation was graphically illustrated by âli\b Jazarah (d. 293/906, or 294) by means of an exchange of verses between a Mu\u0003tazilah who said:Reading, writing, jurisprudence, and all scholarly occupationAre the origin of discomfort, poverty, worries, humiliation,and a \u0003adîth scholar who responded:Writing, study, the occupation with the notebooks of traditionAre the origin of great piety and political ambition.248The seeming contradiction can be easily resolved. The worldly success accompanying knowledge is a natural consequence, something that is inherent in the nature of knowledge as an intellectual 246 Cf. al-Mubashshir, 168, in the name of Plato: “The most unfortunate of scholars is the one whose teachings are invalidated when disapproved (traits) of his become obvious.”247 Cf. al-Bayhaqî, Ta\brîkh-i-Bayhaq, 104. Another poetic recital of the almost automatic rewards of strenuous study and a good education may, for instance, be found in Ni\u000eâmî’s Heft Peiker, ed. H. Ritter and J.

It can do this by either disregarding material things or by pressing them into its service. But in order to harness this force, a person must rise above material considerations and show contempt for the ordinary goods and pleasures of this world. Naturally enough, the incidental result was often taken to be the intended goal, and the material rewards going with knowledge were misunderstood as its true and desirable consequences. As such a misunderstanding of the true nature of knowledge was harmful to knowledge as the stuff that keeps society going, it required clari\u0002cation. This is why personal failings of scholars were the constant concern not only of professional educators in Islam but also of every thoughtful Muslim. And this is why it was necessary and unavoidable to have those interminable complaints that scholars of a given time no longer followed the straight and narrow path of an unsel\u0002sh devotion to scholarship.Knowledge as Life and as Food for the SoulAttention was paid to the blemishes that might affect knowledge and scholars. Much more, however, was said in favor of a positive evaluation of knowledge as a force in society. Knowledge is useful. At least, all acceptable knowledge ought to be useful. Much depends on the way in which “usefulness” is conceived.249 Often, as we have seen, the label of usefulness was reserved exclusively for the metaphysical bene\u0002ts which only certain types of religious knowledge and religious activity could guarantee. In contrast, there was the frequent observation that all knowledge was useful and should be cultivated. A certain bias against theoretical knowledge of no immediate practical usefulness was kept alive. Socrates “was asked why seawater had become salty. He replied: If you can indicate to me the use that will come to you from knowing the answer to this question, I shall give you the reason.”250 And Diogenes, “seeing a youth with a lamp, said to him: Do you know where this \u0002re comes from? The youth replied: If you can tell me where it goes to, I shall tell you where it comes from, thus effectively silencing Diogenes, something nobody else had been able to do.”251 These 249 Cf.

But they illustrate a common human reluctance to accept the greatness of knowledge in its full dimension. This attitude continued in Islam and did its share of harm. However, on the whole, it was counteracted by the \u0002rm conviction that it was known what the usefulness of knowledge really was.The all-sustaining power of knowledge is captured in the simile of knowledge being food for the soul. Various versions of it are met with in the Graeco-Arabic tradition, “Like as the body grows through food and becomes \u0002rm through exercise, thus the soul grows through studying and becomes strong through patiently enduring (the hardships of ) studying.”252 Diogenes, it seems, was supposed to have made this statement. Someone else, apparently Theognis, is said to have already played a variation on the theme: “Knowledge is not on the level of food which suf\u0002ces to feed two or three but cannot feed many persons. Rather, it is like light which enables many eyes to see all at the same time.”253 Diogenes, or, according to another version, the Church Father, Basilius, admonishes us to take the appropriate measures against harmful knowledge in the same way in which we are used to protect ourselves against harmful foods, because knowledge is the food of the soul.254 According to Plato, the pleasure which the soul shares with the body is that of food and drink, whereas its incorporeal pleasure is that of knowledge and wisdom.255 For Pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana (Balînûs), proof of the incorporeality of the soul lies in the fact that it does not partake of material nourishment. “According to the Stoics,” he reports, “Socrates said that the soul eats; however, its food is something that is not corporeal, since the food of the soul is knowledge.”256 Knowledge is also described by Ibn Bu\u0006lân as the thing that nourishes the intellect. It is for the intellect 252 Cf. Kitâb as-Sa\u0002âdah, 170. At its \u0002rst occurrence, “studying” should, perhaps, be corrected to “knowledge”.253 Cf.

Ibn Taymîyah states that “the arrival of knowledge in the heart is like the arrival of food in the body. The body is aware of food and drink. In the same manner, the hearts are aware of the sciences (\u0002ulûm) that establish themselves in them and which are their food and drink.”258 In the popular conception, knowledge and books have always been identi\u0002ed as spiritual food, down to the present day.An even higher estimate of the value of knowledge is implied in the equation of knowledge with life itself. Theology had its own reasons for speculating on the relationship of life and knowledge.259 In popular lore, it was an idea often expressed. Long before Islam, ancient Oriental thinkers had conceived the idea of wisdom that gives life, and the Greeks spoke of those lacking education as the waking dead.260 The ancient tradition remained alive in Islam. Aristotle is credited with the saying that “knowledge is life, and ignorance is death.”261 In Islamic terms, the life-negating character of ignorance is depicted in verses such as these:In ignorance there is death for the ignorant, before they die.Their bodies are tombs, before they are buried.A man who is not given life by knowledge is dead.He enjoys no resurrection till the Resurrection.262Knowledge, according to the poet, restores people and quenches their thirst, like as rain falling upon wood gives it new life.263 Among 257 Cf. Ibn Ba\u0006lân, Da\u0002wat al-a\u000fibbâ\b, 7.

Munqidh cites an unnamed philosopher who called adab rather than knowledge “the life of the hearts.”266 The Jewish mystic, Ba\byâ b. Pâqûdâ, speaks of the “knowledge which is the life of their hearts.”267 Wisdom and knowledge are truly the food of the heart which through them maintains its life, and if they are kept away from it for three days, it dies.268 However, from a more technical, philosophical point of view, Ibn \u0004azm argues against the idea, expressed, he says, by “the representatives of religious scholarship (ahl ash-sharî\u0002ah), that knowledge is the opposite of death. This is wrong, for the soul, after leaving the body, is more \u0002rmly grounded in knowledge than ever before, while the compound body does not know anything.”269More peculiar is the remark ascribed to the sages that “a man’s knowledge is his everlasting child.”270 Eternal duration was more commonly associated with books, which were also equated with physical progeny. The thought that knowledge assured eternal life was indicated also in other sayings such as, for instance: “He who gives life to some kind of knowledge never dies,” and, “the guardians of wealth are dead, while they are alive. The guardians of knowledge live, while they are dead.”271 This last saying appears in a version ascribed to \u0003Alî as: “The guardians of wealth are dead, while they are alive.

According to the Prophetical tradition, the only hazard to eternal life knowledge must overcome is the mortality of scholars; their disappearance is believed to foreshadow the Last Day and the end of the Muslim community. However this may be, knowledge as “food” or as “life” was considered a fundamental condition for the continued existence of the individual as well as society.Knowledge in its Relation to Money and PowerRe\u0003ections on the material rewards of successful efforts to acquire knowledge and to achieve the rank and status of a scholar generally made these points: 1. The efforts are dif\u0002cult and involve many hardships, humiliations, and deprivations. 2. They must be made regardless of any hope for material rewards. 3. They lead, however, to material rewards in the form of prestige which brings with it a position of high regard in society and a certain measure of af\u0003uence. But 4. knowledge by itself is a much more valuable possession than any material gain that may come to the scholar.Nobility of birth was held in the lowest esteem of all the material advantages. It was certainly deemed by far less valuable than intellectual merit as proved by the possession of knowledge:The learned, intelligent person who is his own manHas no need of (noble) family origins by virtue of the quality of his knowledge.Be whose son you want to be, and be perfect!The outstanding keenness of his mind makes a man, nothing else.How great is the difference between a man honored for his originAnd a man honored for his own sake!274The verses echo the famous remark of \u0003Alî that “a man’s value 273 Cf. al-\u0003Almawî, Mu\u0002\u0005îd, 7; F.

It would not do to suggest that there was a large residue of admiration for noble birth in Muslim society, once it had moved out of the Arabian peninsula, and that the intellectuals con-stantly and strenuously raised their voice against it, merely in order to combat a tendency dangerous in their eyes and detrimental to their particular interests. Noble birth had its advantages, but it could not compete with money, and certainly not with knowledge. The Muslims themselves were able to contrast the Muslim attitude toward social strati\u0002cation determined by birth with what they believed had been the dominant characteristic of the Persian civilization preceding Islam, namely, its insistence upon social immobility as the prerequisite for a well-ordered society and upon birth as the decisive factor for the individual’s position in and value to society.277 On our part, we may point out that in275 Cf. above, pp. 256 and 281.

It began gathering strength only in the \u0002fteenth century,278 inaugurating the “modern” era with its unprecedented \u0003owering of human achievement.A much larger remnant of doubt and vacillation affected the Muslim attitude toward money and property. Next to knowledge, commerce was the mainspring of the mobility of Muslim society. The power of money was fully understood by scholars. Their own relative poverty as contrasted to the wealth of the commercial and landholding segments of society remained for them an article of faith \u0002rmly to be believed in and constantly to be proclaimed.279 Not very many among them might have shown appreciation for the sentiment that the principal merit of knowledge was to help a poor man to be satis\u0002ed with his lot.280 As so many other vital concerns, the bitterness of the poorly rewarded intellectual was most vividly put into words by Abû \u0004ayyân at-Taw\bîdî in the tenth century.281 From later times, we can document what no doubt had always been the actual situation, namely, that a certain middle-class prosperity based on commercial activity was the background from which scholars most commonly came (unless, perhaps, they happened to be born into a scholarly family of established standing, but even these usually possessed commercial connections).282 Those who overcame grinding poverty to become prominent in scholarship were but a small minority, albeit a remarkable one. It would be dif\u0002cult to venture any kind of general favor of knowledge and scholarship again casts doubt upon the Persian attribution (cf. above, p. 284, n. 3).The Greek attitude toward nobility of birth (eugeneia) was rather ambivalent.

Whatever it was, they quite naturally rejected wealth in favor of spiritual values, at least in theory.A certain respect for wealth was not considered incompatible with learning. Certain sayings expressing this view remained popular. “Why do wisdom and wealth not go together?, Plato was asked, and he replied: Because perfection is rare.”283 Meant primarily to extol wisdom, the saying takes note of the fact that wealth, too, is an indispensable part of human perfection. An anecdote based on Plato’s remark about “the wise going to the doors of the rich” (Republic 489B) is cited frequently: “Diogenes was asked why the rich did not go to the doors of the learned, whereas the learned went to the doors of the rich. He replied: Because the learned know the value of money, while the rich do not know the excellence of knowledge.”284 The Persian sage, Buzurjmihr, was also credited with this saying, and it was expressly stated that it provided decisive proof for the superiority of knowledge over wealth.285 Its prototype is well known from Greek works. It does not appear there in precisely the same form as in Arabic, and it is not uninstructive to compare the differences. In one of the Greek versions, the reply Aristippus is said to have given to Dionysius reads: “Because the wise know what they need, while the rich do not.”286 In another version, Eubulus tells Socrates that the fact that the wise sit or even sleep at the doors of the rich clearly proves the superiority of wealth over wisdom. Greek tradition in a way rejected this probably more original form of the witticism. In Muslim tradition, \u0002nally, it was completely superseded by the moralizing conclusion in favor of knowledge. Still, the anecdote retained some of its old \u0003avor and suggested a 283 Cf. at-Taw\bîdî, Ba\u0015â\bir, in Ms. phot.

Khumârtâsh (d. 619/1222).287 However, it was clear to the majority and impressed upon them by the books they were reading and the intellectual climate surrounding them that “wealth disappears, whereas knowledge remains.”288 Your knowledge cannot be taken away from you, but your wealth can, and often is.289 Knowledge is an inexhaustible treasure,290 while all other treasures are not inexhaustible. It is a possession which can be spent without thereby suffering any diminution. On the contrary, it rather increases with being spent, something which is certainly not true of material possessions.291 It is like the \u0002re of a lamp which is not extinguished by kindling another \u0002re from it.292 It gives protection, whereas property requires protection, and “it exercises control, whereas property is something over which control is exercised.”293For Abû \u0004ayyân at-Taw\bîdî, the superiority of knowledge over wealth was a foregone conclusion, and he knew why the two never went together.

They rarely go together and are reconciled to each other. Also, a man’s portion of wealth results from the concupiscent and bestial soul, whereas his portion of knowledge results from the rational soul. These two portions oppose, and contradict each other. Further, a discerning and discriminating person must realize that a man who possesses knowledge is nobler in every conceivable respect than a man of wealth. If he is given knowledge, he need not despair of money, of which a little suf\u0002ces, or greatly worry about the loss of it. Knowledge exercises control. Wealth is something over which control is exercised. Knowledge belongs to the soul. Wealth is corporeal. Knowledge belongs to a man in a more personal manner than wealth. The perils of the wealthy are many and sudden. You do not see a man who possesses knowledge robbed of his knowledge and left deprived of it. But you have seen quite a few people whose money was stolen, taken away, or con\u0002scated, and the former owners remained helpless and destitute. Knowledge thrives on being spent. It accompanies its possessor into destitution. It makes it possible to be satis\u0002ed with little. It lowers a curtain over need. Wealth does not do that.”295However, knowledge meant wealth as was indicated, for instance, in a remark ascribed to Mu\t\u0003ab b. az-Zubayr who was advising his son to acquire knowledge, for, he said, “if you have wealth, knowledge will be an ornament ( jamâl ) for you. If you do not have wealth, it will mean wealth for you.”296 It brought with it worldly advancement in the way described by the caliph \u0003Abd-al-Malik to his sons: “Acquire knowledge, for if you are lords, you will thereby advance in power and rank. If you belong to the middle class, you will become lords. And if you are common people, it will enable you to make a living.”297 It was, of course, also realized that money constituted power and together with knowledge was the magic formula that insured leadership in human society. Again, this was an idea derived from Hellenistic wisdom. It found expression in a saying that reads: “In this life, seek knowledge 295 Cf. at-Taw\bîdî, Imtâ\u0002, II, 49. See also Yâqût, Irshâd, VI, 150 = XVI, 231, where at-Taw\bîdî and Ibn Sâsân agree that luck ( jadd ) and knowledge rarely go together and that effort and trouble (kadd) go with knowledge, while luck goes with ignorance.296 Cf. al-Mâwardî, Adab, 16; al-Ghazzâlî, I\u0003yâ\b, I, 8, trans.

The elite will acknowledge your superiority because of your good knowledge and your ability to act correctly, and the common people will acknowledge your superiority because of your large property.”298On the other hand, scholars were fascinated by the thought that knowledge by itself guaranteed political power and, what is more, the sound exercise of it.299 At the very least, it was considered one of the ways through which political power could be achieved. Platonism, as it became known to the Muslims in early \u0003Abbâsid times, provided the foundation for this idea, although it had no doubt been around and in the air long before the formal acceptance of the Greek philosophical heritage. An apparently old and often cited dictum extolling the superiority of scholars over statesmen was attributed to the legendary grammarian of the seventh century, Abû l-Aswad ad-Du\u0002alî, and couched in this form: “There is nothing more powerful (a\u0002azz) than knowledge. This is shown by the fact that kings exercise control (\u0003ukkâm) over people, and scholars exercise control over kings.”300 If the scholars themselves cannot be in positions of political power, then at least, the rulers should have knowledge. “Knowledge,” Aristotle says, “is an ornament of kings.”301 Again, Greek statecraft is transferred to Iran in the form of a statement ascribed to Anûsharwân: “When God means well for a nation, He places knowledge in its kings, and kingship in 298 Cf. \u0004unayn, Nawâdir, fol. 140a (\bynsws = Aesop ?); Ibn Hindû, 24 (Plato); al-Mubashshir, 139 (Plato), 277 (Luqmân); at-Taw\bîdî, Imtâ\u0002, II, 48 f. (Diogenes).299 The idea was also turned around. Just as humanity would die out without man’s sexual instincts, “knowledge would be lost, were there no love of leadership,” cf. Ma\bmûd b. Mu\bammad (above, p. 249, n. 3), in the name of al-Ma\u0002mûn.300 Cf., for instance, Ibn Qutaybah, \u0002Uyûn, II, 121 (above, p. 258); Ibn \u0003Abd-Rabbih, \u0002Iqd, II, 215; al-Marzubânî, Nûr al-qabas, 12; Abû A\bmad al-\u0003Askarî, Ma\u0015ûn, ed. \u0002Abd-as-Salâm M.

An author of scholarly biographies (\u000fabaqât) could begin his work with praising God who had raised the level (\u000fabaqât) of scholars over the heads and crowns of kings, cf. as-Subkî, \u0010abaqât ash-Shâ\u0002\u0002îyah, I, 13.301 Cf. al-Mubashshir, 193.

With the political insight into human nature of the political realist, the wazîr doubted its validity. Philosophy, he argued, concerned as it is with the other world, implies an abdication from worldly affairs, “and how can a king abdicate from worldly affairs and have a dislike for them? He must lead and control the people of this world. This requires providing for material bene\u0002ts (for them) and avoiding material harm (coming to them). He has friends whom he must guide, for whom he must set up houses and provide wealth, with whom he must eat and drink together and whom he must take care of, and whose private and public affairs he must oversee. A king is busier than a physician who must undertake many treatments with various drugs and diverse diets, and yet must \u0002rst consider his own soul and his own body and avoid diseases and accidents (disease symptoms), inwardly and outwardly. How can a man of so many needs and concerns, and even more (than have just been described as falling to the lot of a king) be a king and also a sage (at the same time)? Considering this a possibility, someone could argue that a king may be gathering wisdom as (a champion of religious) propaganda, while directly and immediately taking care of his government duties. However, this would mean an intensely complicated state of confusion both for the kingdom and for philo-sophy, rather than putting the matter on a solid footing in principle and in detail. The wazîr added: Therefore, we are unable to \u0002nd in Islam more than a small number of statesmen who governed abstemiously, piously, and with a view to piety and righteousness.” Referring to the Zoroastrians (Majûs), the author then switches from philosophy to religion 302 Cf. the introduction of the great medical encyclopaedia of \u0003Alî b. al-\u0003Abbâs al-Majûsî, Kâmil, I, 3 (Bûlâq 1294); al-Mâwardî, Adab, 20, who cites “an ancient scholar” as his authority. Scholars naturally were aware that it served their own interest to recommend to rulers that they seek the company of scholars, cf., for instance, Miskawayh, Jâwîdhân Khiradh, 47 (Buzurjmihr), and all the other fürstenspiegel.303 Cf. at-Taw\bîdî, Imtâ\u0002, II, 48 f.

Ibn Khaldûn was later on to continue the debate about suitability or lack of suitability of scholars for political leadership on entirely secular grounds.304The religious implications of the term “scholar” were also underlying the opposite view of the mutual role of knowledge and political power which far from proclaiming the dominance of scholars over kings considered any contact of scholars with the government as something pernicious and improper, at any rate for the scholars and for their scholarly status. The adab formulation of this view attributed to the Syrian jurist, al-Awzâ\u0003î (d. 157/774), tended to be particularly emphatic, in order to achieve the greatest possible effect: “God hates nothing more than a scholar who visits an amîr.”305 There also is a saying credited to Sufyân (ath-Thawrî) that “there is a special valley in Hell inhabited only by Qur\u0002ân readers who (while alive) were frequent visitors of kings.”306 Other pertinent statements run: “The worst amîrs are those most remote from the scholars, and the worst scholars are those closest to the amîrs.”307 And, “if you see a scholar who is constantly around the government, you should realize that he is a thief,”308 for the warning against contacts of scholars with the government was frequently coupled with imprecations against the evils of a scholar’s desire for wealth.309 The pious and the mystics considered all government as tainted by money, and any contact with political power as de\u0002ling.

Most scholars, while suspicious of the purely material aspects of government and wary of the all too obvious dangers always threatening men in positions of leadership,310 were convinced that knowledge—their kind of knowledge, to be sure—was the key to an equitable and satisfactory management of society.This conviction was matched by the hardly less meaningful conviction that the search for knowledge and the spread of knowledge constituted the most valid and effective incentives for formal social groupings on a more intimate individual or community level. “Knowledge” was the group activity par excellence leading to the formation of a nucleus with a great and desirable potential for growing and, hopefully, for dominating society. We do \u0002nd expressions of the opposite view that knowledge is “a companion in loneliness” (mu\bnis fî l-wa\u0003dah, and the like),311 that it serves as an escape mechanism and provides a refuge for the individual from the iniquities of this world to which he could repair at will, withdrawing into its shell. “A sage said to his son: You must concern yourself with knowledge, for the least bene\u0002t it confers upon the person possessing it is that he does not remain alone,”312 because knowledge is always there to keep him company.I am happy with loneliness,Having taken knowledge for company,Having withdrawn from the people,And approving of forgetting and of being forgotten.313This sentiment was, however, more commonly voiced in connection with books, those best companions and friends a man could have.314310 Cf. the statements on “seeking leadership” collected by Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Jâmi\u0002, I, 143 f.311 Cf. al-\u0003Askarî, \tathth, in Ms. Hamidiye 1464, fol. 54a.

It has also been said that the \u0002âqil, the man of intelligence, is nowhere a stranger, cf., for instance, Ibn Abî d-dunyâ, \u0002Aql, 23.319 The Greek original attributed to Xenophanes reads: “When Empedocles mentioned to him that a wise man cannot be found, he replied, \u0003Rightly so, for the person who wants to recognize a wise man must be wise himself ’ ” (cf. Diogenes Laertius, IX, 20, and Gnomologium Vaticanum, no. 283, where the authority is Empedocles himself, also further references). The common Arabic version reads: “The man of knowledge (\u0002âlim) recognizes the ignorant person, because he (himself ) was ignorant (once). The ignorant man, however, does not recognize the man of knowledge, because he never was one.” Cf., for instance, \u0004unayn, Nawâdir, fol. 66a (Aristotle); Ibn al-Mu\u0003tazz, Âdâb, ed. Krachkovsky, VI, 60, cited by al-Mâwardî, Adab, 17; at-Taw\bîdî, Imtâ\u0002, II, 44, where the situation governing the relationship between physician and patient is adduced for comparison; al-Mubashshir, 190 (Aristotle).A further generalization, which poses an unsolved logical problem unless knowledge is assumed to be natural or inspirational, states that knowledge can be recognized only through knowledge, and this makes it impossible for those without knowledge to recognize the worth of knowledge, cf. al-Mâwardî, Adab, 17.320 Cf., for instance, \u0004unayn, Nawâdir, fol. 156b (Dymqr\b\u000f Democrates), fol. 157a–b (anonymous [Socrates]); al-\u0003Âmirî, I\u0002lâm, 179, who speaks of men of intelligence; Ibn \u0003Abd-al-Barr, Bahjah, I, 135; al-Mubashshir, 102 (Socrates). Versi\u0002cation of the idea attests further to its wide appeal:Nothing is more of a lost job than a man of knowledgeWhom the world forces to mingle with ignoramuses.Cf. Ibn al-Fuwa\u0006î, Talkhî\u0015, IV, 1, 383. For an illustrative anecdote involving Thumâmah, cf.

Nothing is more sterile than uncommunicated knowledge.322 Nothing is more signi\u0002cant for society at large than the small groupings of teachers and students.

The pre-ceding pages have proved, I believe, its domination over all aspects of Muslim intellectual, spiritual, and social life. “Knowledge” certainly tri-umphed among the educated classes, and they set the tone for all the others. It has been contended that the great masses of the people can-not have been immune to the inescapable impact of the veneration for knowledge displayed by their leaders. The question remains whether there is some direct means to measure their response. The willingness of ordinary people to let themselves be guided by slogans becomes obvious at certain periods in history and is easily accounted for. However, the endurance and effectiveness of slogans over long stretches of time or the entire lifetime of civilizations are dif\u0002cult, if not impossible, to calculate and to explain. This applies with particular force to civilizations of the past where any documentation, however plentiful it may seem, is frag-mentary in the extreme.The so-called popular literature with its proven mass appeal may be of some help on this respect. Its outlook on the world is, in fact, not determined by its mass audience but represents a \u0002ltered and simpli-\u0002ed version of the thought of the comparatively few who constituted the intellectual elite at one time or another. However, it is a reason-able gauge of popular feeling. Unfortunately, it so happens that only a very small part of the medieval literature of Muslim peoples can be considered to be of a distinctly popular type. The “conquest nov-els,” for instance, would seem to fall into this category. By way of \u0002cti-tious historical examples, they depict the proper attitude of the \u0002ghter for the cause of Islam. He is represented as willing to die for his faith (îmân) and for the true religion of Islam (ad-dîn). He could hardly be expected to give his life for “knowledge.” The holy war was to be fought with slogans more elementary than “knowledge” could ever hope, or fear, to be. On the other hand, the edifying treatises holding up \u0002ctitious early conversions to Islam as models for later generations made every effort to show that the superior knowledge and insight of the representative of the Muslim side of the debate were essential rosenthal_f11_334-341.indd Sec1:33410/17/2006 5:51:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"for its inevitable success. The famous “Questions” of \u0003Abdallâh b. Salâm illustrate this point very clearly. Sermons were certainly preached for the masses, although it may be seriously doubted that the sermons which were set down in writing and constituted a productive branch of litera-ture continued to serve as popular reading. If “knowledge” seems to play an insigni\u0002cant role in the homiletic literature, it was the natural result of the general outlook of all Muslim preaching. It was orientated toward the other world and, to an even greater degree, away from the total evil of this world. Its recommendations were therefore all negative as far as this world was concerned. There was no good reason to recom-mend something like “knowledge” that had so many positive worldly aspects in addition to its religious value. In contrast, the fairy tale lit-erature looked to this world. It re\u0003ects ordinary life with astonishing faithfulness, including the wishful thoughts and aspirations and hopes of ordinary people. Thus, in the peaceful bourgois world of the Arabian Nights, knowledge together with adab has its secure place as part of the good life of man and is felt to be something that cannot be properly divorced from material and spiritual prosperity.Altogether, the evidence from popular literature is inconclusive. We have to fall back upon the contention that the constant concern and occupation with “knowledge” in all \u0002elds of intellectual endeavor can-not have remained without eliciting a strong and positive response from the masses. It may be added that those unable to respond to the clear voice of their intellectual spokesmen hardly count as contributors to the determination of cultural values and attitudes. “Knowledge” was moreover the most stringent of conditions for admission to legitimate political leadership (“legitimate” as against the often illegitimate role assumed by the military in the political arena). Respect for it, as well as, on occasion, hatred and derision, can be assumed to have been shared by all members of the community, even those at the bottom of the social ladder. Admittedly, we have no statistics or positive evidence and are forced to rely on inference. Its weight, however, seems strong enough to support the view that what has been established as the intellectual atti-tude of Muslim civilization can be taken as representative of all Islam.Another question remains to be answered. No special position can be claimed for “knowledge” in Muslim civilization, unless we concluding remark 335rosenthal_f11_334-341.indd Sec1:33510/17/2006 5:51:49 PM"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"have at least some assurance that comparable societies elsewhere in the world did not accord to it an equally distinguished or even more power-ful position. It need hardly be said that the comparison of different civili-zations is always a very hazardous and questionable undertaking. Many unprovable presuppositions are required under any circumstances. Where general human values such as knowledge are involved, the vari-ables become so many and so convergent that their comparison and distinction would seem to be an unmanageable task. Knowledge is at the root of every advance in human society. Our contention has been no more and no less than that in Islam, this fact has found its trium-phant verbalization centering around the very word “knowledge.” Consequently, we must rule out as irrelevant attempts to determine the signi\u0002cance of “knowledge” for other civilizations on the basis merely of the strength of the intellectual factors operative in them. Awareness of the fundamental character of knowledge has meant, and continues to mean, enormously much for the growth of modern Western civiliza-tion. Ours is a civilization wedded to knowledge. It also is a civilization of a variety and extent never seen before. Future generations will be left with the task to discover whether the concept of knowledge as such in\u0003uenced the development of the modern world with greater force and effect than did other abstract ideas. In any case, it does not seem proper or instructive to compare a past as yet undisturbed by the miraculous advance of technology and communications with a present that is with-out its peer in human history.Graeco-Roman philosophy had the deepest respect for thinking ( phro-nein) as the greatest of virtues, as stated by Heraclitus,1 for pure knowl-edge (theôria) as the sweetest and best of human endeavors, as it was in the view of Aristotle2 no less than in that of his teacher, or for knowl-edge (epistêmê) as the one and only virtue, as the Stoics proclaimed.3 Yet, nobody would wish to argue that the attitude toward knowledge in the Ancient World as a whole or in any particular region or epoch of it was inspired and sustained by the same single-minded devotion that existed in medieval Islam. In the merger of ethics with knowledge, eth-ics always retained the greater attraction for the minds and emotions 1 Cf. Diels, Vorsokratiker, I, 99, Heraclitus B 112.2 Cf. Aristotle, Metaphysics 1072b24, see above, p. 241.3 Cf.

Nor was the sphere of religion ever fused with that of knowledge as inseparably as happened later on in Islam.When Christianity took over from the Greek and Roman world and created the Western “Middle Ages,” the concept of knowledge relin-quished whatever privileged position it occupied in the Ancient World. Knowledge was cultivated, and wisdom cherished, but the medieval mind was not moved by any magic spell emanating from the word “knowledge” or a belief in its unsurpassed religious and worldly merit. A philosopher of the recent past, looking at knowledge in its Western habitat, divided the whole of it into Bildungswissen, Erlösungswissen, and Herrschaftswissen (or Leistungswissen). The last kind of knowledge, the effort of science to control nature and society, is assumed to have been undeveloped in Antiquity and in the Middle Ages. Strong as both Bildungswissen and Erlösungswissen were in the past, Bildungswissen, the effort to improve the individual personality, is believed to be little cultivated now, and Erlösungswissen, the desire to learn about the divine order of the world and to achieve salvation, is, we are told, no longer of any real signi\u0002cance.4 If we look at Islam in this way, we \u0002nd that metaphysical, ethical, and scienti\u0002c knowledge, and, in addition knowl-edge as the power tool of society, were not all present in equal strength, but they were present and active. They were conceived as part of one human-divine attribute called “knowledge,” which held sway over all human and divine affairs. “Knowledge” did not convey any such feeling to the people of Christian Europe during their Middle Ages, regardless of what particular aim they sought most to accomplish through their intellectual efforts.Islam may be compared or contrasted with the civilizations of Classical Antiquity and the Christian West. At the same time, however, these three are branches of the very same tree. In particular, they share the same roots of “knowledge.” It could be argued that any noticeable differences merely re\u0003ect stronger or weaker shades of the same color. The true test for the thesis that the concept of knowledge achieved its unique triumph in Islam must involve a comparison of Islam with the civilizations of India and China. Such a comparison requires the possession of a linguistic4 Cf. M.

In fact, I feel that if at all, it can be undertaken successfully only after stud-ies of the attitudes toward “knowledge” in India and China have been undertaken along lines similar to those followed in the present work. As far as I know, this has not yet been done. However, the problem can-not be avoided in our context, and the brief glance of an uninformed observer—and moreover, one who is needs prejudiced in favor of his own thesis—may be of some interest, if only because of the absence of something better.Chinese philosophy5 has attempted to give formal and abstract de\u0002-nitions of knowledge, although this appears to have been done only on quite rare occasions. We thus hear a Chinese thinker speak of knowl-edge as that through which one knows and knows something for cer-tain as through illumination.6 Knowledge is something innate, but it also depends on the testimony of the senses. Confucius further noted that knowledge is the innate ability to distinguish one’s possession of knowledge from one’s non-possession of knowledge. He also made a point which was considered similarly as important by Muslim authori-ties, namely, that a combination of reason and knowledge is a neces-sary requirement and that the absence of the one or the other results in creating situations that are either useless or dangerous.7 However, Chinese and, in particular, Neo-Confucian thought was thoroughly dominated by the idea of the inseparability of knowledge from action. In the Chinese view, action, and not knowledge, is the chief con-cern of the individual and of society. Action was regarded “as more important, more trustworthy, more easily grasped, or more dif\u0002cult, and hence of greater concern.” The opposite view was occasionally expressed. The author of an essay on “Knowledge and Action,” who lived in the third century A.D., argued that “a life of learning and the attainment of perfect understanding (was) more valuable than a5 I wish to thank my colleagues, Hans Frankel and Arthur F. Wright, for some greatly appreciated advice.6 Cf. A. Forke, Geschichte der alten chinesischen Philosophie, 2nd ed., 410 f. (Hamburg 1964). Cf., further, his Geschichte der mittelalterlichen chinesischen Philosophie, 92, and Geschichte der neueren chinesischen Philosophie, 453. For “innate knowledge,” cf. also Wing-tsit Chan, Instructions for Practical Knowledge and Other Neo-Confucian Writings by Wang Yang-ming, 107 ff., 132 ff., 198, 218 f., etc. (New York and London 1963).7 Cf. Forke, Geschichte der alten chinesischen Philosophie, 129.

Knowledge was at best one among a number of important components constitut-ing man and his world. It is true that “learning” was the beginning and end of all Chinese societal endeavor, but like knowledge, all study was directed toward action. Since the days of al-Jâ\bi\u000e, Arabic literature has always maintained that skilled craftsmanship was the national charac-teristics of the Chinese: “In contrast to the Greeks, the Chinese engage only in practical work. They are men of the active life and, there-fore, do not inquire into the motive powers behind their activities.”9 Simplifying and thus misleading as this statement obviously is, it is in a way con\u0002rmed by the stress placed in Chinese thought on action as man’s overriding concern. “Knowledge” inevitably had to be a subject of discussion in Chinese civilization. However, it did not achieve there the status of a basic concept and even less so, that of an inspiring slogan of wide appeal and great ef\u0002cacy, notwithstanding the fact that Chinese society put a premium on learning and education.The situation in India appears to have been totally differ-ent. Action fades into the background. Epistemology at its most abstract comes to the fore as an abiding preoccupation of Indian thinkers. Second-hand reading, which being based upon transla-tion may be misleading, reveals occasional contacts with ideas also found expressed in Islam. Thus, for instance, the relationship of knower, knowledge, and object known was variously discussed.10 8 Both quotations are from D. S. Nivison, The Problem of “Knowledge” and “Action” in Chinese Thought since Wang Yang-ming, in A. F. Wright (ed.), Studies in Chinese Thought, 114 (Chicago 1953). Mencius had no theory of knowledge, and all his thinking was about action, cf. I. A. Richards, Mencius on the Mind, 61 (New York 1932). For the identity of knowledge and action or the superiority of action over knowledge in Confucian tradi-tion, cf. Wing-tsit Chan, Instructions, XXXV ff.Nivison, 135, cites a nineteenth-century thinker as assigning to knowledge a higher value than to action and as saying that “religion is the means of pursuing knowledge.” This, however, is decidedly modern, and it cannot be compared with Islamic data. 9 Cf. Rosenthal, Technique and Approach, 71 f.10 Cf. Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy, I, 382 f. (Cambridge 1932): “All knowledge involves the knower, the known object, and the knowl-edge at the same identical moment.” Also, III, 146 (reprint Cambridge concluding remark 339rosenthal_f11_334-341.indd Sec1:33910/17/2006 5:51:50 PM"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"We also \u0002nd distinctions made between what is useful and what, like wealth, is useless,11 or between false knowledge and true knowledge and the role of doubt in this connection.12 Indian speculation, however, went deeper into the abstract problem of knowledge than Muslim scholars ever did, even in later centuries and in the eastern part of the Muslim world where Indian in\u0003uence was always a possibility, and often a fact. In the nature of Sanskrit, this speculation involved a great variety of terms which were \u0002lled with speci\u0002c meanings. There was no single dominating term. For us, this is the principal consideration. It effec-tively eliminates any Indian competition for Arabic \u0002ilm as a unique cul-ture term. No matter how greatly imbued Indian civilization was with “knowledge,”13 it did not grant one term the free run of its entire intel-lectual and societal landscape.In conclusion, the question may be asked: What does it mean for a civilization, and beyond it, for the history of mankind, if “knowl-edge” is made its central concern? It would seem doubtful whether an answer in terms of good or bad would have any validity whatever. For a given society, “good” is what it itself acknowledges as such, and “bad” is whatever it rejects. If two different civilizations were to hold the same value judgments on matters of central concern to them, they probably would not be really different. And if their value judgments dif-fer, whatever their respective members think about each other is based upon different premises and must therefore appear highly subjective. Its insistence upon “knowledge” has no doubt made medieval Muslim civi-lization one of great scholarly and scienti\u0002c productivity, and through it, Muslim civilization made its most lasting contribution to mankind. 1952): “All persons experience that knowledge is felt to be as distinct from the ‘I’, the knower, as the object known.”11 Cf.
