As theydiscussed various academic points, one among them, Abexl-musaynal-Nerc, remained silent. Suddenly he stood up and began to recitefour verses of love poetry. His recitation had such an overpoweringeffect that all those present went into a frenzy of delight and ecstasy.Nerc was not a scholar at heart, but an ecstatic Sufi mystic. It isthus not surprising that he chose to upset a scholarly assembly andturn their dry proceedings into an occasion of samAW.The emergence of a mystical and spiritual path in Islam in thesecond and third centuries after the Prophet Muhammad presents uswith a striking phenomenon. On the one hand it is clear that therewas an organic development of piety and asceticism, of meditationon the Qurxan, and an experience of the overpowering majesty ofGod coupled with the feeling of incapacity on the part of human-kind as His servants. This development was deeply impressed bythe centrality of the Qurxan as the foundation of all Muslim life andfaith. In both its doctrinal teaching and the ritual of its recitation,the Holy Book inspired the piety and introspection of those whosought God. The notion of a covenant between God and human-kind (Qur. 7.172) became central to much Sufi doctrine and practice,allied with the idea of the ‘friends’ of God and His love for them.Yet on the other hand it is also clear that this spiritual movementin Islam mirrored to some extent the ascetic and mystical traditionsof Christianity in Syria and Egypt, where the two religions over-lapped. The very word {EfC, if derived from the Arabic word forwool ({Ef), reflects the wearing of ascetic woollen garments char-acteristic of eastern Christian monks. The Christian anticipation ofSufism may also be reflected in doctrinal and practical areas: theemphasis on God’s love, the adaptation of Greek neo-Platonist"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION2philosophy, the progress of the mystic through a hierarchically stagedpath, the espousal of poverty, and so on.1However this may be, an ascetic and spiritual movement emergedduring the early years of the Abbasid empire (from the middlesecond/eighth century), partly as a reaction to perceived hypocrisyand shallowness in mainstream religion and its wealthy supporters.This development crystallised around a number of charismatic andrevered individuals who came to be honoured as friends of God, asshaykhs or spiritual masters. These individuals attracted to them-selves younger or less experienced seekers of God. As yet, no formalorders or ‘brotherhoods’ existed; the relations between master andseeker were of a personal and informal basis. These early Sufi group-ings sought to define and articulate their experience of asceticismand their understanding of Qurxanic spirituality.Though these individuals remained deeply pious and integratedinto the practice of the Sharia or revealed law of Islam, their asceticleanings and their stress on extra devotional activities led to inevit-able differences and at times conflict with mainstream expressionsof the faith. The personal and charismatic quality of the early Sufisalso meant that individual doctrines and teachings emerged withmuch diversity. One archetypal example of these tendencies is in thefigure of Abe Yazcd al-Bisuamc (d.261/874), an ascetic from Khurasanin north-east Iran. He describes his mystical experiences in the formof symbolic journeys or flights of the spirit, based largely on thefamous ‘ascent’ journey of the Prophet alluded to in the Qurxan andembellished by later writers. In Iraq meanwhile, the movement cameto centre around the most famous figure of early Sufism, Junayd(d.297/910). An outwardly conservative adherent of the Sharia, hewas yet a profound teacher and writer about mystical unitary experi-ence, which he expressed in allusive and obscure language.These two personalities and their teachings represent two diver-gent tendencies which came to be characterised as the ‘sober’ andthe ‘intoxicated’ paths of the Sufi way. Junayd, an influential andinspiring teacher, was also the supreme example of a ‘sober’ mystic.Although he had a charismatic personality and attracted many dis-ciples, he tried to steer a course for his Sufi contemporaries awayfrom public confrontation with critics and hostile authorities. Hesought only private disclosures of those teachings, experiences orbehaviours which were likely to upset non-mystics. This cautiousapproach of Junayd’s attempted to maintain the mystical dimen-sion as part of mainstream belief and practice, from which the Sufimovement was in danger of breaking away. Two centuries later the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION3great scholar and mystic Abemamid al-Ghazalc (d.505/1111) con-solidated this ‘sober’ approach by his integration of Sufi thoughtwith mainstream Ashwarite theology.In contrast to this ‘sober’ path was the path of the ‘intoxicated’,those who chose irreverent or antinomian attitudes and practicesunacceptable to mainstream Islam. One of these tendencies was themalAmatCway, those who sought to bring blame on themselves bytheir apparently irreligious behaviour. By concealing their true devo-tion and showing outward disrespect for piety, they brought uponthemselves condemnation from ordinary believers and authoritiesalike. As well as Bisuamc, other ‘intoxicated’ Sufis include the infam-ous Manzer al-mallaj, who was executed amid political intrigue andcharges of blasphemy in 309/922. Unlike Junayd, with whom heonce studied, mallaj was not afraid to speak openly and in confron-tation with authorities about his inner unitary experience. A con-temporary of mallaj was Abe Bakr al-Shiblc (d.334/946), whoseoutrageous behaviour led to detention in a mental asylum, and whodeclared that his ‘madness’ saved him from mallaj’s fate.A feature of the ‘intoxicated’ Sufis was their public demonstrationof altered state experience, an outward show of their ‘intoxicated’state, brought about by intense ascetic deprivation, meditations andrituals. During such occasions they would speak openly about theirexperience and their beliefs, though often these ecstatic utteranceswould be incomprehensible or seem blasphemous to others.These unusual states were sought after because they were seen assignposts or way stations on the path of the mystic’s goal of divineunitary experience. Due to their sometimes ecstatic and blissfulnature, these states were also interpreted as manifestations of divinelove and mercy.By the third and fourth centuries of the Islamic era (ninth andtenth centuries ) techniques and rituals had developed for thegeneration of altered state experiences both individually and in asocial setting. Such techniques were not restricted to the ‘intoxicated’Sufis but seem to have been fairly widespread. For mainstreamIslam, however, and particularly for those who disapproved of theSufis, such practices were frowned upon and regarded as unaccept-able ‘innovations’ from the path laid down by the Prophet.One of the techniques used to induce altered states was that ofaural stimulation: chanting, listening to music, poetry, or the recita-tion of the Qur’an. In a ritual or social setting, at first among aprivate group of seekers, later in larger and more public settings, thispractice became known as samAw(‘listening’ or ‘spiritual concert’)."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION4The practice of samAwis clearly an extension of the more basic prac-tice of dhikr(‘remembrance [of God]’ or ritual chant and praise).The Qurxan itself prescribes the constant remembrance and praiseof God, and all these ritual activities have as their source the recita-tion of the Qurxan.2Such practices could lead to the heightening of spiritual aware-ness culminating in various types of ecstasy, alterations of the psyche,and spontaneous physical reactions. The physical and psycholo-gical impact of chanting and recitation, especially with the accompani-ment of music, was powerfully effective, far beyond the semanticforce of the words being heard. J. Spencer Trimingham reminds usthat music, chant and recitation ‘not only has mystical power to drawout the deepest emotions, but also, when co-ordinated with symbolicwords and rhythmical movements, has power over man’s will’.3As well as these more or less ritualised practices, early Sufi writ-ings also remark on the effects of informal or casual aural stimuli.A chance hearing of words, song or poetry in a crowded place, thecry of a street vendor, or a ‘misheard’ sound or utterance could alsoact as a powerful trigger for altered state experiences.The focus of this book is on these two types of samAW– the formalritual activity, and the informal, casual or chance occasions men-tioned in early Sufi writings. Attention is directed to the heightenedawareness and spiritual states associated with ‘listening’. The firsttask of the book is the description of these altered states as found invarious texts from the formative period of Sufi literature. Secondly,an attempt is made to interpret these unusual states and behavioursin the light of contemporary psychological research.The concept of samAWhas a wide range of meanings, as will bediscovered in the Sufi texts discussed below. Jean During, whoseMusique et extaseis one of the few recent works devoted to thistopic, introduces the subject in the following way:Samaw, which literally means ‘audition’, denotes, in the Sufitradition, spiritual listening, and more particularly listeningto music with the aim of reaching a state of grace or ecstasy,or more simply with the aim of meditating, of plunging intooneself, or as the Sufis say, to ‘nourish the soul’. It thus oper-ates in a mystical concert, of spiritual listening to music andsongs, in a more or less ritualised form.4During’s study is largely concerned with the later developmentsofsamAW, particularly those of the Mevlevi order associated with"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION5Jalal al-Dcn Remc (d.672/1273), and writers influenced by the famousAndalusian Sufi, Ibn al-wArabc (d.638/1240). The period before theseventh/thirteenth century, however, saw a much more diffuse, lessformalised practice of samAW. Trimingham, in his work on the Sufiorders, maintained that it is difficult to give details about thesepractices during this early period, ‘apart from the singing of myst-ical poems to induce ecstasy’.5 This view needs some modification:a close examination of the texts from this period shows that a vari-ety of practices were operating; some developed into more formalrituals, while others may have been abandoned. It is true that cer-tain details are lacking, but it will be shown in later chapters thatwe can provide a clearer picture of the personalities and practicesinvolved. Moreover, the picture from these centuries can be seenquite adequately without the need for an interpretative overlay pro-vided by the Ibn al-wArabc school.During’s definition of samAW, while emphasising the musical andritual aspects of the practice, is too narrow for the purposes of thisbook. A broader concept of samAWis needed because it includes awider field of auditory events described in the source texts. Many ofthe instances of ‘listening’ in the Sufi writings studied here are notfound in formal, ritual situations; nor is music or poetry alwaysinvolved. As mentioned above, many of the auditory phenomenawhich give rise to altered states are chance occurrences, such as streetcries, songs or overheard speech. Even these everyday events canproduce a profound psychological effect in the receptive listener.It is this effect, this special awareness or ecstasy associated with‘listening’, which is the focus of the present work. The term ‘alteredstates’ best summarises the range of psychological changes andphysical behaviours being considered. The source texts indicate thatit is not simply a matter of becoming entranced or enraptured byhearing music or poetry, a common enough occurrence in manycultures. It is a more intense and overwhelming experience whichaffects the whole mind/body; it is longer lasting, and may involveprofound physical and mental changes.In cross-cultural and psychological studies, this experience ofaltered states is known to occur in a variety of situations. It hassimilarities and parallels with trances of various kinds, epileptic-likebehaviours, Tourette’s syndrome, glossolalia (‘speaking in tongues’seen in some charismatic Christian circles), and other ‘hyperaroused’states.6 The psychology and cross-cultural perspective on thesealtered states is an emerging discipline, with much progress beingmade in recent years. In Sufi studies little attention has been paid to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION6these phenomena, and the task of the present work is to help redressthis situation.The chosen sources for this study stem from the formative period ofSufi writings, the fourth/tenth to the sixth/twelfth centuries. Thisperiod was one of the most creative and productive in the historyof Sufism.7 Some of the texts from these centuries contain import-ant materials dealing with samAWand altered states. Chapter 2 ofthe book provides an overview of these sources, a summary of theirrelevant contents, and discussion of their arguments, as appropri-ate. Many of the source texts are poorly represented in Englishtranslation, and they are not readily accessible. The second chapterthus provides the necessary framework for the topic as a whole.Chapter 3 considers the issue of language and semantics. The firstquestion addressed is the use of the widely ranging term samAWinthe source texts. The semantics of other important words are con-sidered, particularly in their use as mystical terminology, and inexpressing highly diffuse concepts. The purpose of this chapter is tothrow light on the particular language and idiom used by our chosenauthors. Understanding Sufi psychology involves breaking throughthis language barrier as far as possible.The following three chapters, 4, 5 and 6, form the core subjectmatter of the book. These chapters deal with the psychologicalaspects of samAW, analysing numerous accounts of unusual behavi-ours and altered states evoked by listening. The behaviours arecollated according to their characteristics and discussed in the lightof modern psychological and cross-cultural understandings of alteredstates. An attempt is made to discover whether there is a commonpattern in these states, whether there is a typical psychological con-dition associated with samAW.In Chapter 6 the Sufi writers are examined for their view of thenature and explanation of the states they describe. This is doneto avoid over-reliance on modern, Western psychological researchto explain the phenomena, research which often has a cultural andreligious, or rather, anti-religious, bias. The Sufi writers speak forthemselves as to how they regard these altered states, and how theyare integrated into their religious and cultural framework.Chapter 7 considers the utterances attributed to various Sufi per-sonalities as they speak ecstatically about their experience of alteredstates. The work by Carl Ernst on ecstatic sayings is exemplary inapproaching these statements, though Ernst’s book deals with aslightly different phenomenon.8"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION7After the psychological aspects of samAW have been considered,Chapter 8 looks at the ritual and sociological issues arising fromthis practice. The texts provide some incidental information aboutthe group behaviours and ritual contexts associated with formalsamAWconcerts. This enables us to construct a picture of the groupdynamics and organisation of Sufi communities from these earlycenturies, at least as far as their participation in samAWis concerned.The picture thus formed is not complete in all its details, as most ofthe information is incidentally recorded along with other matterswhich were considered more important. However, there are fewother witnesses to these sociological details from the early years ofSufi life. The chapter also compares the behaviours and rituals ofthe source texts with those witnessed in more contemporary situ-ations, mainly relying on the excellent musicological fieldwork ofRegula Qureshi.9Chapter 9 presents a case study of two of the most important andfrequently mentioned Sufis in the source texts. These two ecstaticpersonalities, Nerc and Shiblc, both lived in the third/ninth andfourth/tenth centuries, and were associated with the famous schoolof Junayd in Baghdad, a group which had a profound impact onthe course of Sunni mysticism. Both Nerc and Shiblc were known aspractising ascetics and mystics of very great renown. This studylooks at their lives as a whole, and the importance of samAwandaltered states in their mystical experience.There are several methodological challenges associated with aninvestigation of the type attempted here. The most outstanding isthe distance in culture and time between the age when the Sufi textswere written, and the present. The language difficulty has been men-tioned above, reflected, for instance, in the use of specialised idiomknown only to initiates of the Sufi path.What is more problematical is the extent to which the modernreader can understand the state of mind of individuals through apurely textual approach. This is perhaps more of a difficulty thanthe usual historiographical problem of reliance on written sources.The problem in this work is that we are dealing with the mostinaccessible of experiences, of a highly personal and often ineffablenature. Some would argue that one cannot approach the minds ofpeople from written texts only, as does Eric Sharpe in relation toreligious studies: ‘States of mind, and their verbal expressions, aretenuous things, and in reality hardly accessible to later investig-ators’.10 In defence of the approach of this book, however, it must"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION8be said that thought processes or states of mind are not the objectof inquiry here. It is not possible to venture this far; rather, theobject of our search is the outward manifestation of states of mind,resulting behaviours, actions, physical signs and ecstatic sayings,which are a legitimate source of information. These outward mani-festations are worthy of consideration as they often provide suffi-cient detail to make their study informative, and to give some notionof deeper processes involved. It is often not possible to inquire anyfurther than this, however, and speculation about mental states iskept to a minimum in our analysis. What is provided by these out-ward manifestations is a pattern of behaviours which may indicatea particular condition not considered before in this cultural con-text. Moreover, this condition may be comparable to those alreadyunder scrutiny in contemporary Western psychology or cross-cultural studies.This leads to an important consideration, namely that the presentwork takes an experiential approach to the subject under study. Itis the experience and reaction of individuals in their encounter withaltered states that is the primary evidence considered in this book.Though there is mediation through written texts, the accounts re-corded are the nearest we can approach these unusual phenomena.The evidence being studied is not that of a belief system, or mysticalsymbolism. Important though these may be, these latter inevitablyinvolve further layers of mediation and a greater distancing fromthe data of personal encounters with altered states.This broadly phenomenological method also means that the sub-ject under discussion is taken seriously and considered a worthyarea of inquiry. It would be a simple exercise to rationalise or explainaway the present subject, particularly from the point of view ofbehaviourist or materialist psychology. Many religious phenomenamay be explained away by an approach which is hostile to the basicassumptions and understandings of religious experience. Yet thisserves only to confirm the researcher’s inadequate frame of reference.By seriously considering the phenomena under study, the investigatorcan enter more fully into the subject, and gain a more thoroughappreciation of its importance.The methodology adopted here may also appear to take a literaland naïve interpretation of the texts and the narratives they con-tain. This can hardly be avoided, since the facts behind every storyor biographical anecdote cannot be ascertained. On the other hand,many of the accounts of the deeds and sayings of these early Sufisare stories which had to happen. Paradigmatic of their experience"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION9and actions, these are powerful narratives, and the factual issue isnot an overriding concern.Finally, as this study is the first to deal in detail with this aspectof the early Sufis, there are some inevitable shortcomings. This is soparticularly since the study of altered states is an evolving area inWestern psychology. If there is some uncertainty in the presentwork, it is shown in my taking a largely descriptive approach, firstsurveying the field and gathering the initial evidence. As the psy-chology of altered states develops, further research will yield morecomprehensive outcomes.Notes1 Julian Baldick, Mystical Islam: An Introduction to Sufism, London: I.B.Tauris, 1989, p.15.2 Ian Richard Netton, Sufi Ritual: The Parallel Universe, Richmond:Curzon Press, 2000, pp.12–13.3 J.

Often highly creative, these writ-ings reflected the spiritual development of the Sufi path at the fore-front of Islamic piety and asceticism within politically and sociallyturbulent times.Our choice of texts was made on the basis of relative import-ance and value among foundational Sufi writings. The texts studiedhere are acknowledged as being highly influential, and in some casesdefinitive, within the prose literature of early Sufism. The chosensources also represent some of the different genres of literature whichhave survived from this period. There are examples of referenceliterature, namely the KitAb al-LumaW (Book of Splendours) of AbeNazr al-Sarraj (d.378/988), the oldest work of its kind; and thefamousRisAla (Treatise) of Abexl-Qasim al-Qushayrc (d.465/1072).Also chosen for study is wAbd al-Rasman al-Sulamc’s (d.412/1021)biographicalOabaqAt al-ZEfCya (Generations of the Sufis), again theoldest and most exemplary work of its kind.These early Arabic works of reference and biography foundworthy successors in the Persian context, with wAlc b. wUthman al-Hujwcrc (d. circa 465/1072), whose Kashf al-MaSjEb (Revealing theVeiled) was an ‘original’ development from Arabic predecessors. Acentury later, Farcd al-DcnwAuuar (d. circa 617/1220) wrote his famedTadhkirat al-AwliyAX (Memorial of the Saints), transforming the ear-lier Arabic biographies into colourful hagiographies.At the centre of all these varied works, however, lay the mostillustrious and monumental of mainstream Sufi writings, Abemamidal-Ghazalc’s (d.505/1111) ISyAX WUlEm al-DCn (Revival of the Religious"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE11Sciences). The chapter on samAW from this famous book providesthe touchstone for much of the discussion in the present study.With the possible exception of Ghazalc’sISyAX, many of theseArabic and Persian works are largely inaccessible to the Englishreader. There are German translations of Qushayrc’sRisAla andSarraj’sLumaW, both by Richard Gramlich. A small portion ofwAuuar’sTadhkirat has been translated into English by A.J. Arberry,2and R.A. Nicholson translated most of Hujwcrc’sKashf,3 though anumber of significant portions are omitted.The aim of the present chapter is to present a summary of thosesections of the chosen texts relevant to our topic. This does notinvolve lengthy translation, but rather a synopsis and some ana-lysis where needed. The chapter also outlines the life and writingsof each author. This overview provides the basis for discussionsand analysis concerning ‘listening’ and altered states among theearly Sufis.The Kitab al-Lumaw of Abe Nazr al-SarrajThe earliest and most fundamental source for the study of manytopics in early Islamic mysticism is the definitive reference work, theKitAb al-LumaWfiXl-Ta{awwuf(Book of Splendours concerning theSufi Way).4This comprehensive and wide-ranging text was writtenin the late fourth/tenth century by the Sunni ascetic and scholar,Abe NazrwAbdallah b. wAlc b. Musammad b. Yasya al-Sarraj al-oesc (d.378/988). Richard Gramlich, in the introduction to hisGerman translation of the LumaW, states that it is the oldest extantguide to Sufism. As such, it is an indispensable source of earlyIslamic piety, and a mine of information which would otherwisehave been lost.5 It has a clear apologetic purpose ‘to set forth thetrue principles of Sufism and to show by argument that they agreewith, and are confirmed by, the doctrines of the Koran and theApostolic Traditions’, as argued by Nicholson in the introductionto his edition of the Arabic text.6As for the author’s biography, the details are rather sparse. Sarrajoriginated in oes in Khurasan, but little is known of his early edu-cation or his teachers. It appears from his writings that he soughtout many Sufi masters and visited their schools on his extensivetravels throughout the Abbasid empire. His concern was to collecttheir teachings and to document their way of life. One example ofthis is his mention of travelling to Bisuam to ascertain the true factsconcerning the teaching and reputation of Abe Yazcd al-Bisuamc"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE12(d. circa 261/874), the celebrated mystic to whom he devotes severalchapters of his work.7The Persian biographers surnamed Sarraj ‘the Peacock of thePoor’ (UA XEs al-fuqarAX), and both Hujwcrc in his Kashf al-MaSjEbandwAuuar in his Tadhkhirat al-AwliyAX tell of the extent of hisasceticism in the following anecdote.

Dur-ing the nightly prayers he would recite the Qurxan five times. Eachnight a servant brought a loaf of bread to his chamber, but on thefeast day at the end of the month Sarraj departed and the servantfound all thirty loaves untouched. wAuuar also relates the story of hisface being unharmed by a fire when he was thrown onto it in a stateof ecstasy.8 Sarraj died in oes in 378/988. The date of compositionof the KitAb al-LumaW is not known, but it is certainly the result ofmany years’ preparation and collecting of materials, and representsthe work of a mature mind.TheLumaW is less a treatise than a thematic collection of Sufiremembrances, teachings, traditions and etiquette. Nicholson arguesthat Sarraj’s reserve in not promulgating his own interpretationsand viewpoints is to be welcomed. It allows for a more historicallyvaluable document, and gives a unique insight into the crucial for-mative years of Sufi practice.9As noted above, the apologetic character of the work is foremostin the author’s mind. Since the Sufi path is bound to the spirit ofthe Prophet and the Sunna, and since the Sufis have a strong positionamong Islamic teachers, all religious knowledge thus derives fromthree sources: the Qurxan, the Prophetic Traditions, and the myst-ical gnosis of the ‘saints’ or friends of God. Part of this apologeticcharacter also shows itself in Sarraj’s endeavour to rebuff critics ofthe Sufis, of whom there were many, and to correct erroneous viewsabout Islamic mysticism.The historical need to defend Sufism is explained by A.J. Arberryas arising in the fourth/tenth century, following the scandal ofthe trial and execution of the outspoken radical, Manzer al-mallaj(d.309/922). Sufi groups felt themselves more under fire than everfrom more conservative mainstream Muslims. Many prominentthinkers were accused of being a zindCq, ‘freethinker’, a general termof abuse covering many allegedly impious beliefs or actions. The needto regroup and defend the legitimacy of Sufi practice was keenlyfelt, and it is Sarraj whom we have to thank for a masterly work ofapology.10"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE13His writing is not wholly uniform or consistent, but this is expectedin a collectanea derived from varying sources. Sarraj’s usual methodis to intersperse collections of sayings or traditions with authorit-ative citations as required, yet with a minimum of editorial inter-pretation. Gramlich observes that Sarraj is not like Ghazalc whoputs forward his own masterly thoughts to which other quotes aresubordinate. Rather, he is a guide who speaks through the collectedthoughts of others.11 On the other hand, Sarraj is not simply a con-duit, or a collector of fragments, writing in the style described byLouis Massignon as the ‘anecdotal atomism’ of early Muslim histo-riographers.12 There is an overall pattern to his writing, based onhis acknowledged apologetic purpose. He is down to earth, factual,and methodical as a relater of traditions, but also a good story-teller who writes in a lively fashion.The apologetic and polemical style of the whole work is evidentin the particular chapters on samAW, entitled KitAb al-SamAW (Bookof Audition). Sarraj endeavours to defend the practice of ritual con-cert among the Sufis, and he argues for its legitimacy against thosewho would outlaw it in Muslim society. Moreover, he attempts toshow that it was approved by the Prophet and his companions, andthat it is thus conformable to mainstream Islam. This is the mainpurpose of the KitAb al-SamAW.In addition, though, Sarraj wishes to give some indication of theactual practice of samAW among the Sufis. He describes the various‘stages’ through which the receptive listener moves, what is appropri-ate for some but not for others, and the varying responses in terms ofphysical or emotional reactions and altered states of consciousness.Nicholson has provided an English abstract of the contents ofSarraj’s work as a whole, including the KitAb al-SamAW, and there isno need to duplicate it here.13 However, some aspects of Sarraj’swork deserve consideration not given elsewhere, in order that hiscontribution to the discussion of samAW is better understood. Thefollowing analysis will address his polemical and apologetic style, aswell as surveying his arguments. Some attempt will also be made toconsider Sarraj’s purposes, and to understand the arguments hetries to counter.An analysis of Sarraj’sKitAb al-SamAWAt the outset the author proceeds straight into the defence of samAWas a ritual or formal practice of Qurxan recitation, the chantingof sacred formulae and poetry. Without any prologue he begins a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE14spirited argument against the conservative and legalistic opponentsof these activities.The beauty of the human voiceThe first chapter of the KitAb al-SamAW deals with the view that thehuman voice is a thing of beauty and a divine gift; it is thus pleasingto God when it is heard (LumaW 267.13ff.) It is clear from the chap-ter that this latter point is contentious, though Sarraj does not sayso explicitly. He argues against those who declared the use of thehuman voice in recitation to be unlawful. Such anti-samAW polemicwas known in Sarraj’s day, and indeed this contention has a longhistory in Islamic writings. It is contained, for example, in the third/ninth century work, Dhamm al-MalAhC (The Censure of Pastimes),by Ibn Abc al-Dunya (d.281/894), which rails against singing andrecitation. Ibn Abc al-Dunya regards these as the ‘amulet of fornica-tion’, which ‘decreases shame, increases desire, and destroys manli-ness, and verily it takes the place of wine and does what drunkennessdoes’.14 Such arguments were known to Sarraj, else his strong polemicin defence of samAW would have little purpose.The author opens his case with citations from the Qurxan andvariousSadCths, as is the usual practice in such presentations, butwhat is noteworthy is that three of the SadCths have doubtful authent-icity.15 It seems that Sarraj attempts to marshal as much evidence ashe can to support his case, even if there is some doubt about thereliability of the evidence.The well-established SadCth that the Prophet said: ‘Beautify (therecitation of) the Qurxan with your voices!’16 gives an occasion forSarraj to provide his first extended explanation in an otherwise longseries of citations (LumaW 268.10 –18). The necessity for an explana-tion of this sacred Tradition is evident in its implication that theuncreated Book can be beautified and enhanced by created humanvoices. Sarraj offers two solutions, first suggesting that it means toembellish one’s own recitation of the Qurxan by raising the voice,improving one’s intonation, and the like. A second, rather curiousinterpretation is to suggest that the statement is an example ofsyntactic transposition, the intended meaning being: ‘Beautify yourvoices with (recitation of ) the Qurxan.’ This obviates the problemmentioned above, but despite the author citing another example ofsuch transposition in the Qurxan, it remains a somewhat forcedexplanation. By running counter to the usual syntactic order for noother reason, it appears as a post hoc solution to a difficulty. This is"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE15evidently a well-known interpretation of this SadCth, since it is inthis form that Hujwcrc cites it in his Kashf al-MaSjEb (Nich. p.399).It is noteworthy that a hierarchy of evidence is brought to bear inSarraj’s process of argumentation. First Qurxanic citations, thenreferences drawn from sacred Tradition, and the third rung lower inthis series is the sayings of scholars (al-SukamAX). This hierarchyconcurs with Sarraj’s description of the three sciences of religion, asoutlined in the first chapter of the KitAb al-LumaW, and also illus-trates his consistent use of triadic constructions in descriptions andexplanations.17In the present case, however, it could be argued that the hier-archy continues downward. Sarraj next cites the therapeutic effectsof sounds, as used for example in the treating of melancholia by‘the ancients’ (al-awAXil). This refers to Greek physicians, notablyHippocrates and the Pythagoreans, as argued by Amnon Shiloahwith regard to a similar reference in Ibn Hinde’s (d.410/1019) KitAbMiftAS at-Oibb (Book of the Key to Medicine).18 The medical writingsof the Greek ‘ancients’ were translated into Arabic two centuriesbefore Sarraj’s time. Moreover, the philosopher Al-Kindc (d.250/865)and the enigmatic fourth/tenth century group known as the IkhwAnal-ZafAX (Brethren of Purity) held firm beliefs in the therapeutic powerof music.19The lowest rung on this ladder of evidence deals with the animalworld, namely the beneficial effect of the cameleer’s voice in urgingand soothing tired camels. Sarraj recounts a charming narrativeabout a camel master being ruined by a slave cameleer’s enchantingvoice. The slave urged on the tired camels with their heavy loads ina state of enchantment until they died of exhaustion (LumaW 270.3 –271.3). The anecdote is recounted with charm and realism, telling ofthewajd or ‘ecstasy’ experienced by the beasts. This attractive storyillustrates the essential humanism of Sarraj, and anticipates the dra-matic effects of music and poetry on the human soul described inthe following chapters.The nature of samawThe second chapter of the KitAb al-SamAW consists of a series ofquotations from various Sufis about the nature and benefits of samAW.As a development from Chapter 1 where the beauty of the humanvoice is considered, the notion of samAW is extended in this nextchapter. There is no explicit attempt at defining the concept, butone may infer that it means more than simply ‘listening’ to a voice"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE16or music. For example, it involves communal gatherings in placessuch as mosques, and certain ritualised activities, though these arenever formally detailed.20 Equally important for the Sufis quoted inthis chapter, it is the listener’s response which constitutes an essentialaspect of samAW. The altered state of consciousness which ‘listening’can bring about and the ensuing spiritual benefits are vital elementsfor the Sufis’ engagement in this activity.It is in this way that the concept of samAW begins to merge withthat of wajd: ‘ecstatic response or experience’. One is the naturalconcomitant of the other. Clear differentiation between the two wasprobably not in the minds of the early Sufis, as is borne out by thestatements in this chapter. One example will suffice: on being askedaboutsamAW, Dhexl-Nen (d.246/861) replied: ‘It is the arrival ofTruth which arouses hearts toward the Truth; one who listens to ittruthfully is confirmed in that Truth, but one who listens to it sen-sually becomes an unbeliever’ (LumaW 271.8–10). Ghazalc’s com-ment on this in the ISyAX shows the overlap of samAW and wajd: ‘It isas if he (Dhexl-Nen) asserted that wajd is the arousal of heartstoward the Truth, and this is what one discovers of it on its arrival,i.e. the arrival of samAW, since he calls samAW the arrival of Truth’(ISyAX II.289.7–8).The legal status of samawThe third chapter in Sarraj’s work (LumaW 273.4 –277.15) addressesthe question of the legal permissibility of samAw. The narrower defini-tion of this practice is used here, that of listening to recitation ormusic, rather than the more inclusive mystical and spiritual dimen-sions covered in the previous chapter. Many of the argumentsadvanced here are similar to those used by other writers on thissubject, and Ghazalc repeats several of Sarraj’s arguments in hisISyAX.21The author uses a hierarchy of arguments in descending order ofauthority, similar to the structure seen in Chapter 1. Evidence iscited from the Qurxan as the highest source of authority, then fromSadCth and sunna, and finally from ‘scholars and legal authorities’.In the Qurxan there is scant direct reference to the topic in ques-tion, but several favourable allusions are confidently arrayed by ourauthor. The verses referring to His signs being ‘in your own selves’(Qur. 41.53 and 51.21) are interpreted to mean being present in thefive senses. The sense of hearing distinguishes between pleasant andunpleasant sounds just as sight distinguishes between beautiful and"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE17ugly. When this is juxtaposed with the verse: ‘the harshest of soundsis without doubt the braying of the ass!’ (Qur. 31.18), there is animplied commendation of beautiful sounds. The third line of argu-ment is the Qurxanic description of the sensual delights of paradise.These include the houris who sing constant praises to God. If therendering and hearing of praises is an activity sanctioned in para-dise, it must therefore be sanctioned in this world. The drinking ofwine, on the other hand, is permitted in paradise, but specificallyforbidden in this world. This is unlike the practice of samAW, againstwhich no specific condemnation is made.The next level of evidence comes from the SadCth and sunna of theProphet and his companions. Sarraj cites sacred Traditions whichtell of the Prophet allowing singing and playing of music in hispresence, and the companions reciting poetry. The Prophet’s state-ment that ‘Wisdom is sometimes found in poetry’22 is quoted asevidence for the sanctioning of poetry recitation. This being so, it isargued that recitation with embellishments, lengthening of vowelsand the addition of music is similarly sanctioned.The final series of evidence comes from ‘a large group of leadingscholars and legal thinkers’ who allow samAW.Sarraj concludes the chapter by stressing that samAW is permis-sible provided no corrupt intention is involved. He also adds theproviso that none of the ‘proscribed’ musical instruments should beused, i.e. those instruments used by ‘vain or superficial people’ (ahlal-bAUil), and prohibited in sacred Traditions.The effects of samawIn the next chapter (LumaW 277.16 –279.21) Sarraj analyses to someextent the effects of samAW on Sufi adepts. He concentrates on thetypes of ‘states’ aimed for and experiences sought after, as far asthese can be described. There is a sense of abstraction in some ofthese descriptions, and a theoretical tone in parts of this chapter. Asfar as these experiences can be explained, they are inevitably ideal-ised and systematised so that any immediacy and real-life charac-terisation is lost. Such systematisation appears evident in the firstsection of this chapter where several classifications by Sufi theoristsare presented in neat, triadic categories. One example suffices toillustrate the contents of this chapter. Abe Yawqeb al-Nahrajerc(d.330/941–2) is quoted as using a threefold classification of thoseaffected by samAW. One group are physically moved by the force ofthe ‘moment’ of samAW; one group are noted for their silence and"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE18stillness; and a third group, ‘the weakest’, are thrown to the groundby their experience. This characterisation by physical reactions mayshow that such motor effects are highly indicative, so that all listenersfall into one of these groups based on their behaviour.QurXAn recitationThe fifth chapter of the KitAb al-SamAW deals with those whosesamAW involves listening to Qurxan recitation (LumaW 280.1–283.6).Sarraj begins the discussion with a series of citations from the Qurxanand the Prophet about the value of reciting the Book.The author then outlines two aspects of Qurxan listening whichhe considers important. The first is the value of paying close atten-tion to what is heard, not only with the ears but also with the heart.Sarraj then alludes to the great power of hearing the Book, notingthat people have lost consciousness, or died, or lost the power oftheir limbs from listening to its recitation.Sarraj relates a number of stories involving prominent Sufis whichexemplify aspects of the Qurxan’s power. These episodes which con-tain examples of the physical effects of samAW will be discussed inthe chapters on psychology later in this book.Poetry and the QurXAnThe next chapter continues the theme of the previous one, foralthough it deals ostensibly with listening to secular poetry, it alsohas much to say about Qurxan recitation (LumaW 283.7–285.10).Sarraj claims that authority for listening to secular poetry is givenby the Prophet in his statement: ‘Wisdom is sometimes found inpoetry.’ He goes on to argue that those who listen to poetry recita-tion are showing respect for the Holy Book. By adhering to thedoctrine of the uncreatedness of the Qurxan, these people maintainits superiority by not embellishing it with human melodies. In linewith this argument, the author states that human passions oughtnot to be encouraged or satisfied by melodic recitation of the Qurxan.Rather, these passions are better served by poetry which in itsnature has an affinity to human sensitivities and is better able torouse human passions. The Qurxan, on the other hand, has an affinitywith ‘reality or the real nature of things’.There is some inconsistency in Sarraj’s basic argument in thischapter, that there is mutual exclusivity between the divine andhuman realms, between the uncreated Book and created melodies"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE19or poetry. The author claims that even a small portion of the Qurxanrevealed in its ‘real nature’ to human hearts can burst these heartsapart. Yet it is possible to recite the Qurxan often, and to find nosensitivity or emotion in one’s heart unless it is performed witha beautiful voice or melodies. The argument continues that somepeople consider the emotional response to arise from the Qurxan’sinnate power and beauty, but if this were the case, these effectswould be present at every reading of the Book.Sarraj’s answer to this difficulty is what was mentioned aboveconcerning emotions being in affinity with base human passions.These are readily aroused by sensuous melodies and poetry, while theQurxan, being on a higher plane, does not so easily cause this arousal.Both aspects of this argument, however, cannot be maintained.The alleged power of the Qurxan to ‘burst’ human hearts sits poorlywith the author’s acknowledgement that one can recite it manytimes without apparent emotional effect. The argument also comesclose to undermining the Qurxan’s superiority and separateness fromsecular poetry.In fairness to Sarraj, however, it is difficult to conceive of a morepersuasive argument here. Ghazalc encounters the same difficultywhile employing a similar argument in the ISyAX.23The author argues on a firmer basis in concluding that embellishingthe Qurxan with chants and melodies makes it more attractive toordinary believers, contrary to those scholars who disapprove of thispractice. The Holy Book’s message is thereby made more palatablefor people to hear and understand.Sufi novicesThe seventh chapter (LumaW 285.11–288.8) consists of two appar-ently unrelated sections. The first part is a series of stories fromvarious sources relating to the dramatic effect of listening to ‘recol-lection’ (dhikr) or verse. In each of these narratives a person isaffected by an altered state, such that sudden death ensues. Theseaccounts will be discussed more fully in the chapters on psychologylater in this book. In the second section of the present chapterSarraj describes a number of conditions and prerequisites fornovices who wish to practise samAW. He lays down these conditionsas a miniature ‘rule’ for novices under the direction of their shaykh.No reason is given for the juxtaposition of these two unrelatedtopics. However, in comparing Hujwcrc’sKashf al-MaSjEb (Nich.pp.407– 8), a similar series of stories is preceded by warnings to"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE20novices. We might suppose that Sarraj is prefacing his ‘rule’ fornovices with a clear warning of the dangers of unprepared listening.This is confirmed by the fact that the narratives mostly involveyoung disciples as those most profoundly affected by samAW, andthus those most in need of expert guidance by their shaykh.Sarraj presumes some advancement along the Sufi path as a con-dition for the practice of samAW. Certain types of understanding areassumed, as is the need for maturity in asceticism and renunciation,such as not being ‘stained’ with love for the world, and not havingthe desire for human company.When these conditions are met, some listening is allowed, namelythat which is suitable for penitence, humility and fearfulness, andwhich urges toward right conduct and striving. This would precludemost secular material, and would largely restrict the listener toappropriate religious texts. Sarraj states explicitly that listening forpleasure is forbidden, as this would distract the listener from hisservice of God. If such conditions are not met, the novice shouldwithdraw from samAW, except for recollection of God and chantingHis praises.Sufi adeptsThe eighth chapter (LumaW 288.9–292.9) contains a variety of sub-jects loosely connected with various Sufi adepts or masters. Someaspects of samAW are given further exposure, and the subject ofresulting rapture or ecstasy is mentioned in several narratives. Sincethese stories all have a strong psychological component, discussionof their content will be held over for later in this book.Sufi mastersThe two preceding chapters dealt with aspects of samAW relatingto an ascending order of participants: first novices, then adepts ofmiddle ranking. Now we deal with those who have reached thehighest levels, literally ‘the choice of the choice and the people ofperfection’, as Sarraj’s heading describes them.Four main arguments are advanced in this chapter (LumaW 292.10 –294.19), using a combination of biographical narratives with editorialcomments. The first argument is that those who have advanced tohigher phases of ‘consciousness’ (SAl, pl. aSwAl) rarely display out-ward signs of being affected by such states. The usual signs forbeginners are kinetic, such as involuntary movements of limbs,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE21trembling and agitation. The Sufi masters rarely display such signs,and their ‘state’ remains one of calm and stillness, this lack of move-ment being regarded as superior.This leads directly to the next argument, that the adept’s ‘state’and presence of heart remains the same before, during and after thesamAW session. This is the corollary to the superiority of the state ofstillness outlined above.The next argument follows logically, that adepts are not distractedby any physical or sensual interference in their quest for recollec-tion of mind. An illustrative anecdote is related of Mimshadh al-Dcnawarc (d.299/912), who claimed that all the musical instrumentsin the world would not distract his inner state. Sarraj goes on toargue that their passions have been so refined that adepts do notdelight in beautiful sounds. Their intent is single minded, their heartsand qualities purified, and their human natures offer no resistance(LumaW 294.2– 8).There are obvious dangers in this line of reasoning which couldundermine the author’s overall purpose in advocating the value ofsamAW. If the Sufi masters find that no sound is distracting, and ifthey find no delight in listening, then participation in these activitiescan be seen as a hindrance, or superfluous. At the more advancedstages of Sufi practice, the need for external stimuli to heightenconsciousness, such as that provided by samAW, is not required atall. It is legitimate only in the early stages where external aids mightbe seen as effective, though somewhat artificially so. Sarraj does notactually mention this difficulty, but other writers do. Hujwcrc, forexample, specifically states: ‘Audition is the viaticum of the indi-gent: one who has reached his journey’s end hath no need of it’(Nich. p.405).Given these implications in his reasoning, it is to Sarraj’s creditthat he advances the final argument which follows logically. samAWmay be unnecessary to the masters, yet the author lists a number ofreasons for their involvement in listening sessions: to give supportto their brothers, to teach and guide, and to support those fromother fraternities through their integrity and strength of purpose.samaw and wisdomThe topic of the tenth chapter (LumaW 295.1–296.11) is the rela-tionship between samAW and Sikma(‘wisdom, wise sayings’). Sarrajargues that wise sayings are able to stir strong feelings in the heart.Moreover, there are influences from the transcendent world, such"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE22as those encountered in words of wisdom, or other samAW, which actsubconsciously on one’s heart. The author claims that samAW is notmerely beautiful sound to be enjoyed, but is a type of Sikma whichcan have a powerful and beneficial influence on hearts.An anecdote mentioned by Sarraj is noteworthy partly for itsrepetition by later authors.24 A person asks Junayd at what stage oneshould regard God’s praise and blame as being the same. One ofJunayd’s companions, evidently misunderstanding the question andregarding it as foolish, answers: ‘When he is put in the asylum andshackled with fetters!’ Junayd gently rebukes this interjector by answer-ing that it is when he knows for certain that he is a created being.The force of this reply is shown by the questioner then sighing witha groan, probably as a physical indication of a dissociative reaction.The author then enters into his main argument, claiming thatwise sayings are able to stir up strong feeling (wajd) in the inner self,or a burning in the heart. This is a similar function claimed else-where for music and recitation.Sarraj continues by stating that ‘there are things encountered byhearts, when they are pure, that impinge upon them from the Unseenworld, whether audible or visible perceptions. If these (perceptions)correspond (to what is in the heart) their influence is strong, butif they are contrary and obstructive, they are weak . . . Sometimesrecollections are renewed for (those who receive them) in what theyhear, and visible perceptions are clarified for them time after time.This increase of clarity is renewed for them in listening to wise say-ings and attending to their subtleties’ (LumaW 295.16 –296.4). This isa difficult passage in Sarraj’s text, but it seems that he is alluding tosome sort of reawakening of hidden knowledge. This may refer tothe events of the ‘day of Alast’, the primordial covenant between Godand humankind (Qur.7.172). Abe Bakr al-Kalabadhc (d.385/995)writes in a similar vein in his KitAb al-TaWarruf (Book of Knowledge):wAbe Musammad Ruwaym said: ‘The people heard theirfirstdhikr [recollection of God] when God addressed them,saying, “Am I not your Lord?” This dhikr was secretedin their hearts . . . So when they heard the (Sefc)dhikr, thesecret things of their hearts appeared, and they wereravished . . .’25As well as the allusion to hidden knowledge, there may alsobe a reference here to notions very similar to the archetypes ofneo-Platonist philosophy. Titus Burckhardt argues that dhikr can"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE23mean ‘memory’ in the neo-Platonist sense of reflected knowledge ofarchetypes, and also the traditional ‘mention’. This double aspect isimportant in that it connects the sonorous practice of invocationwith the evocation of essential truths or knowledge of the divineWord.26ThatsamAW and dhikr are not meaningless incantation and sonor-ous melodies is reinforced by the author’s citing of Sikma as avehicle of samAW along with Qurxanic recitation, poetry and recollec-tion. This illustrates the juxtaposition of dhikr with the Divine Word.Sarraj concludes that what is important is the heart’s encounteringthe strong emotion or ecstasy of sacred recollection. It is reawaken-ing the secreted knowledge of the ‘day of Alast’, or the evoking ofessential truths which causes ecstasy and burning of the heart.Psychology of samawIn this next chapter (LumaW 296.12–298.10), various topics men-tioned earlier are given further elaboration. The main subject takenup later in this chapter concerns the transformation which listenersundergo on hearing poetry. In Chapter 9 Sarraj mentioned a typeof projection taking place from the Sufi’s ‘momentary state of mind’onto the particular sounds or words being heard. Here the authormentions that the original message may remain intact, but is sotransformed in interpretation that it takes on a completely newaspect, its secular meaning becoming one of religious significance.Sarraj begins, however, by presenting a short summary of thepsychological process which culminates in ecstatic utterance: ‘When(listeners) hear things which correspond to their momentary experi-ence (al-waqt), the hidden tendencies of their hearts are intensified;their hearts cannot contain this and they begin to give expression totheir strong emotion (wajd)’ (LumaW 296.15–17). As these ecstaticutterances are likely to occur during the practice of samAW, the authorcontinues: ‘It does not occur to their mind the intention of the poetin his poetry, or the purpose of the speaker in what he says’ (LumaW296.18). Sarraj concludes the chapter with several narratives illustrat-ing this last statement.Opponents of samawThis is the final chapter of the KitAb al-SamAW (LumaW 298.11–300.13),and it consists of simply listing the reasons why some people dis-approve of the practice of samAW. Given the author’s clear endorsement"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE24of the practice, it is surprising that he does not offer a spiriteddefence against its detractors. This shows the fair-mindedness ofSarraj in giving scope for his opponents to state their case openly.The first reason for disapproval is the claim that the early leadersof Islam opposed the practice. In fact many of the same argumentsfromSadCth cited by opponents of samAW are also used by support-ers in its defence. For example, Abe Bakr’s censure of the singinggirls in the Prophet’s presence is seen by opponents of samAW to beconclusive evidence of its disapproval.27 Ghazalc and others, how-ever, see this same SadCth as supportive of singing, since the Prophethimself allowed it to continue. A similar situation with other sacredTraditions leads Arthur Gribetz to comment that such disputation‘does not resolve the controversy conclusively due to the subjectivenature of the interpretations involved’.28The second, third and fourth reasons concern the alleged frivol-ity of the practice, for young people and novices, for those whoseek pleasure, and for the ordinary believers who may gain a falseimpression of the sincerity of the Sufis. The fifth reason for notpractisingsamAW is simply because one’s peers do not, and associ-ation with those of a different outlook is to be avoided. Sixth, thereis the SadCth that one should not concern oneself with things whichhave no value for salvation, or which are not expressed duties orobligations.The final reason offered is perhaps the most forceful of all, namelythatsamAW is not needed by those with advanced mystical con-sciousness. Such Sufis enjoy complete control over their minds andthus have no need for external stimulation by sound which mayinterfere with their constant inner ‘converse’ (LumaW 300.5–12).Aspects of this argument were mentioned in an earlier chapter, andthe implications not developed there are now fully articulated. Ifoutside influences have no effect on them, it follows that aids suchassamAW are not needed for reaching higher mystical states. Asmentioned earlier, this tends to devalue the practice of samAW, sinceit is really only of use to novices and the inexperienced.When viewed as a whole, the KitAb al-SamAW attempts a vigorousjustification for the practice of samAW among the Sufis. Sarraj setsforth his apology in a meticulous and painstaking way. His exposi-tion is carefully arranged and systematically presented in an attemptat a serious rebuttal of those opposed to samAW. The heat generatedby this controversy, as outlined by Gribetz, was considerable, and"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE25it is to our author’s credit that his defence is well reasoned andunaffected by emotive pleas. This is particularly commendablewhen compared with anti-samAW writings such as Ibn Abc al-Dunya’sDhamm al-MalAhC, where the lack of these reasoning qualities isconspicuous.It has been noted that Sarraj often uses hierarchies of evidenceand argument, in a quasi-legal fashion, stating his case from theQurxan, then from the Traditions, and finally from noted scholarsor Sufis. Such triadic argumentation is a constant feature of theauthor’s work, lending an air of balance and order to his exposi-tion. At times, however, an object under discussion or a certaingroup of people are divided into three classes or types. It seems thatthe author sometimes forces the subjects under scrutiny into triadiccategories which are almost certainly artificial.The Qurxan is an important source of support for Sarraj’s argu-ments, more perhaps due to theological exigencies than as a valuablesource of evidence. There are very few direct Qurxanic references tothe subject matter, but verses are cited with the least possible connec-tion in order to provide authoritative support for the author’s case.With the use of evidence from the Traditions, every possible refer-ence is again used to bolster the case that the Sufis are conformingto early Islamic piety.The use of evidence from scholars and prominent Sufis is by farthe most frequent, usually taking the form of illustrative anecdotesfrom the lives of the Sufi masters or scholars. Although these nar-ratives do not have the same authoritative status as SadCth, there isa large collection from which to draw, and thus the author is ableto select the most relevant for his purposes. Indeed there are manysections of the work which consist of a series of narratives withlittle bridging material or editorial comment. On the whole thisproves a very effective means of advancing the author’s case, especi-ally as these vignettes from the lives of the Sufi masters are oftenvigorous and full of colour, supplying much interest to the text.On occasion, however, some of the anecdotes prove more bafflingthan illuminating, and call for explanations which the author doesnot provide.TheKitAb al-SamAW is a well-constructed and well-argued pieceof writing. It is often lively and colourful, thanks to the qualityof the narratives. As for the effect of Sarraj’s writing, judging bylater authors on the subject, it is clear that it had a positive im-pact. His arguments are often reused or restated, by Ghazalc in his"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE26ISyAX, for example, where Sarraj is acknowledged (ISyAX II.297.20ff ),and in the earliest Persian prose text on Sufism, Hujwcrc’sKashfal-MaSjEb.An analysis of Sarraj’sKitAb al-WajdImmediately following the KitAb al-SamAW, there is a further sub-stantial section of Sarraj’s work entitled KitAb al-Wajd (The Bookof Ecstatic Experience) (LumaW 300.14 –314.18). This section discussesin detail certain aspects of the concept of wajd, ‘ecstatic experienceor trance’. This subject is intimately connected with samAW, and inGhazac’sISyAX the two topics are dealt with as one. The followinganalysis focuses on those parts of the KitAb al-Wajd which are rel-evant to the discussions of this book.The concept of wajdThe first chapter (LumaW 300.14 –302.10) deals with a number ofdifferent definitions and statements concerning the nature of wajd.Several Sufi masters are quoted with their varying notions aboutthe subject. None of these statements provides a strict lexical defini-tion applicable in different contexts. Rather, the chapter unfoldsmore like a large canvas upon which various artists add their owntouches of colour. In the end there is a collected impression, addedpiece by piece, giving a better understanding of the subject, thoughperhaps not describable as an integral whole.A lengthy comment attributed to Junayd comes nearest to a defini-tion or lexical equivalent. Junayd considers wajd to be ‘encounter-ing, finding’ (al-mu{Adafa), and he provides an almost philologicalargument for this by glossing several Qurxanic usages of the rootwajada with equivalents from {adafa, form III. Junayd adds that‘all which the heart encounters of grief or joy, that is wajd. God hasmade it known concerning hearts that they observe and under-stand, and that is wajd for them’ (LumaW 301.5 – 6).Junayd’s concept of wajd is simply ‘what the heart encounters’,whether in terms of emotional attributes (grief or joy), or of intel-ligible knowledge. This accords with the concept of qalb, ‘heart’,as the organ of gnosis and of emotion. This notion of ‘encountering’spiritual truths removes the need for more ebullient concepts suchas ‘ecstasy’, ‘emotive excess’, ‘passion’, and so on, and is consistentwith Junayd’s well-known ‘sober’ approach. This stands in contrastto the most frequent English equivalent of wajd as ‘ecstasy’.29"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE27Attempted ecstatic experienceThe second and third chapters (LumaW 302.11–306.3) discuss thetheme of tawAjud, ‘simulating or attempting ecstatic experience’.Sarraj uses theoretical discourse as well as relating several narra-tives about prominent Sufis. Without detailing these stories, theircommon argument is the similarity of such ‘simulated’ experiencewith the genuine type, especially since the famous Sufi mastersexperienced such ecstasy in their lives.Physical effects of wajdThe fourth chapter of the KitAb al-Wajd (LumaW 306.4 –308.2) dealswith some of the overpowering physical effects felt by Sufis in theirexperience of wajd. A narrative is related of Junayd and Sarc al-Saqauc (d.253/867) in which these two masters debate whether wajdcan produce such insensitivity to pain that a person can be struckby a sword and not feel its effect. There follows a discussion similarto one touched on earlier in the KitAb al-SamAW over the externalsigns of the trance state.The fifth chapter (LumaW 308.3 –309.18) continues this last topicof discussion in more detail. The whole of this chapter is a digest ofthe subject as argued by a certain Abe Sawcd b. al-wArabc (d.341/952)in his (now lost) KitAb al-Wajd. The discussion is of scant interest inthe present context, partly because it is treated in a purely dogmaticfashion, but also since it adds little light on the physical and psycho-logical effects at issue.wajd according to AbE SaWCd b. al-WArAbCThe final chapter (LumaW310.1–314.18) is a more general discussionofwajd summarised from the work of Abe Sawcd b. al-wArabc. Theauthor begins in a psychological vein, mentioning various feelingsor states of mind which can arouse ecstatic experience and whichmay accompany it. These include ‘disquieting recollection’, ‘fears’,‘regret’, ‘remorse’, and so on. This is instructive in the light of modernresearch which shows a correlation between anxiety and stress statesand the onset of altered state or dissociative behaviours.30Very soon the author reverts to a more theological tone in describ-ing the onset of wajd: ‘encounters of. . . the inner with the inner,and the Unseen with the Unseen, and the secret heart with thesecret heart . . .’ (LumaW 310.6 –7). Among these abstract discussions,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE28however, there are some valuable insights to be gained. For example,the author speaks of the sudden onset of the trance state: ‘This stateis not known before its arrival and there is no familiar habituationwith it because of its rapid passing when it occurs, so that it is likea totally instantaneous occurrence. The joyous state (thus produced)is not fulfilled when it occurs, so there remains regret at its passing’(LumaW 310.14 –16). The author goes on to speak of the physicaleffects, loss of control over the movement of one’s limbs, and so on,and the great power and force of the onset. Furthermore: ‘Everyoccurrence is an extraordinary experience (mustaghrab)’ (LumaW310.18). The force and power is so terrible that were it not for God’sgrace, the subject would not be able to bear it, and they would losereason and soul. For some subjects there remains partial memoryof the experience, and knowledge gained thereby can be used asproof of its validity.Abe Sawcd b. al-wArabc, through the medium of Sarraj, proceedsto ponder at length the ineffability of this topic: ‘How can onedescribe something which has no description other than itself, andto which no witness can testify other than itself ? . . . this is similarto the case of love (maSabba) and yearning (shawq) and nearness(qurb); all this is too subtle for description, and its essence is notapprehended except by one who experiences it’ (LumaW 313.7– 8; 12–13). The remainder of this chapter continues in this fashion, oftenexpressing in eloquent terms the indescribability of such mysticalexperience, and the futility of trying to understand this subject with-out direct and immediate knowledge.With such a limit placed on the value of the discussion, Sarraj com-pletes the subject of samAW and wajd. The earlier portion of Sarraj’swork has greater value intrinsically, and also for the purposes ofthe present book. Our discussion will thus draw much more fromthe earlier part of the work.The writings of AbewAbd al-Rasman al-SulamcA generation later than Sarraj comes the important Sufi hagio-grapher and theorist, AbewAbd al-Rasman al-Sulamc. His writingsare perhaps not as fundamental for our present topic as his illustri-ous predecessor’s, but Sulamc’s contibution is nevertheless import-ant. One of his major works, the OabaqAt al-ZEfCya (Generationsof the Sufis), is a ground-breaking biographical collection whichformed the basis for many later writings of a similar nature in both"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE29Arabic and Persian. As such, it contains many anecdotes of theSufi masters which contain valuable information on the subjectofsamAW.Again the details of Sulamc’s biography are rather sparse.31 Hewas born in Nishapur in 325/937 or 330/942, into a pious family,studying under his maternal grandfather, Ismawcl b.Nujayd al-Sulamc(d.366/976). Ibn Nujayd was a leading malAmatCyafigure, and arenownedSadCth scholar. Sulamc’s mother was also inclined towardthe Sufis, and thus the youth gained a thorough traditional educa-tion from an early age.He studied SadCth with some of the leading authorities of the time,and became a specialist in his own right. He travelled extensively insearch of Traditions, as far away as the Hijaz, Cairo, Iraq, as well asthe Persian-speaking areas of the empire. He also learned the prin-ciples of Ashwarc theology, and in law adhered to the Shafiwc school,which in fourth/tenth century Nishapur had many links with theSufi way.One of his many pupils was Abexl-Qasim al-Qushayrc (d.465/1072), who also wrote important works on Sufism, which we willconsider later. Sulamc built a small khAnaqAh or lodge in Nishapur,which became renowned during his lifetime, and he was buriedthere in 412/1021.Ner al-Dcn Sharcba, in the introduction to his edition of theOabaqAt, argues that Sulamc began his writing career around 350.32 His renowned commentary on the Qurxan, the MaqAXiq al-TafsCr(Realities of Interpretation), was probably written at the endof the 370s; the TArCkh al-ZEfCya (History of the Sufis) in the 380s,and the OabaqAt al-ZEfCyanear the end of the fourth/tenth century.TheOabaqAt is a collection of biographical traditions concerningthe Sufi masters, their lives and their sayings. It was not the first suchwork of this genre in Islamic literature, but its great importance liesin the fact that virtually all earlier works of Sufi biography havebeen lost to us. It is a treasury of the opinions and interpretationsof the Sufis, and of the stories concerning their lives and char-acters. His work also influenced later writers in this genre, many ofwhom rely heavily on Sulamc. Thus, Abe Nuwaym’sMilyat al-AwliyAX(Embellishment of the Saints) Qushayrc’sRisAla(Treatise), and Jamc’sNafaSAt al-Uns (Breaths of Intimacy) all show their debt to theOabaqAt.33Etan Kohlberg argues that Sulamc seems to have had two distinctaims. First, his task was to defend Sufism against its many critics,and second, to spread knowledge of Sufism among the general"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE30public as well as the Sufis themselves. In this, there is little differ-ence from the aims of Sarraj in writing the LumaW.34Sharcba argues that what distinguished the Nishapur schoolof Sufi writers from their Baghdad counterparts was their moreobjective style of authorship.35 This is characterised by theirrestraint from giving personal opinions and interpretations on thesubjects being discussed. This is certainly the case with Sulamc’sOabaqAtwhere he seldom expresses his own view. He is content tobe a faithful compiler, transmitting the materials he has collectedintact and without obvious personal interpretation. The serious‘Traditionist’ quality of Sulamc’s work also shows itself in the struc-ture of each Sufi biography, which consists of a series of stories orsayings arranged in the usual fashion of SadCth literature. Eachpericope carries a full isnAd or chain of transmission authorities,unless there are several with the same isnAd, in which case variousabbreviations are used. Each Sufi biography, or rather ‘tradition’, isalso preceded by a SadCth of the Prophet. This identification withthe Prophet’s words and deeds imprints the stamp of legitimacy towhat follows.samAw and wajdin the OabaqAt al-ZEfCyaTheOabaqAt al-ZEfCya is a collection of Sufi traditions and not asystematic treatise. As such, references to samAW and altered statesare scattered throughout the book, often in isolated incidents relat-ing to the lives of the masters. Because of the character of Sulamc’swriting, moreover, there is no unified line of argument or approachto the topic. Some of the references to the subject in question arepositive and supportive of the practice, while others are inimical,depending on the individual views of the Sufi being quoted.It should be noted also that most of the references to samAw in theOabaqAt are different from the many anecdotes, stories and sayingscontained in Sarraj’sKitAb al-LumaW. Al-Sulamc evidently used dif-ferent sources for his collection of traditions from that of Sarraj.The following survey is a compilation of the various references tosamAW and related topics, as they occur in order throughout theOabaqAt, with some comments as appropriate.1OabaqAt al-ZEfCya (T.S.) 60.7–12:marith al-Musasibc (d.243/857) was present at a samAW concert when a qawwAl(profes-sional reciter) chanted some verses about the sadness of leavingone’s homeland and one’s beloved. marith arose in ecstasy and"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE31cried out so that all those present were moved with compassionfor him.2T.S. 116.6 –117.2: Abemafz al-Naysaberc (d.265/879) wouldnot mention the name of God heedlessly or without due hon-our and respect. When he mentioned God, his state (SAl) wouldchange such that all those present would be aware of the change.Some sayings of his during such occasions are recorded.3T.S. 119.3 –5: Abemafz had a companion who frequented samAWsessions, where he would weep and tear his clothes. Abemafz isreported to have said that everything should be done to savethe man from this activity. (These last two pericopes suggestthat Abemafz was a Sufi of the ‘sober’ school, rejecting theexcesses of ecstatic activity, but himself deeply sensitive to theextraordinary states induced by samAw.)4T.S. 195.7–8: Samnen b. wAbd Allah (d. circa 300/913) is re-ported to have cried out (perhaps indicating an altered state)and said: ‘If only humankind would cry out due to the force ofHiswajd in love of Him, to fill what lies between East and Westwith crying out!’5T.S. 202.12–13:wAmre b. wUthman al-Makkc (d.291/904) isreported to have said that there can be no explanation of thenature of wajd as it is a mystery (sirr) of God with His truebelievers.6T.S. 204.11–205.6: An incident is related of al-Makkc in whichhe visits a sick young follower in Isfahan. A qawwAl accompan-ies al-Makkc and recites some verses. The sick youth recoversand al-Makkc explains that the signs of his recovery precededthe recitation, thus indicating its divine source. Had there beenno sign of recovery before the recitation, this would have indi-cated its evil source.7T.S. 239.8–11: Abexl-wAbbas b. Masreq al-oesc (d. circa 298/910) was asked about listening to poetical quatrains. He repliedthat our hearts do not learn obedience naturally but by applica-tion and appropriation. Listening to quatrains aids the harmo-nisation of outward and inward, strengthens one’s mental state(SAl) and helps to perfect knowledge.8T.S. 240.8–14: Abexl-wAbbas once walked with Junayd throughone of the alleys of Baghdad. A singer was reciting some frag-ments of verse. Junayd began to weep bitterly, and picking upon some of the words of the singer, he reflected in poetic fash-ion on his failures: ‘O Abexl-wAbbas, how good are the stagesof concord and familiarity, and how lonely are the states of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE32antipathy! I never cease to yearn for the origin of my desire,with a keen path, and terrors as my steed, desirous to attain mygoal! But look at me now during times of indolence; I yearn forpast times!’9T.S. 299.15–16: Abexl-musayn al-Warraq (d. before 320/932) isreported to have said that the way to God is difficult for onewho does not come upon it with overwhelming enthusiasm(wajd) and passionate desire (shawq).10T.S. 328.9–15: Abemamza al-Khurasanc (d.290/903) heard oneof his companions censuring another for being overcome bywajd and showing his inner state in a gathering where therewere opponents of samAW. Abemamza told him to stop hisscolding, for wajd obliterates distinctions, makes all places one,and all eyes one. One should not be censured for being over-come by wajd which is involuntary. He then recited a verse ofIbn al-Remc (d.283/896).11T.S. 329.7–9: AbewAbd Allah al-[ubaysc (d.?) is reported assaying that samAW (meaning the recitation of poetry) which speaksplainly is welcome; samAW which uses allusions is feigning, butthe subtlest samAW is that which is obscure except for the onehearing it (i.e. one hearing and being emotionally affected byit).12T.S. 330.10 –12: AbewAbd Allah also said that when wajd isgenuine it should be upheld and defended; no one should beallowed to speak disparagingly of an altered state (SAl).13T.S. 331.1–2: AbewAbd Allah also said that the most completeform of fear is that which takes on the characteristics of wajd,not from loss of something hoped for or desired. (Presumably,the characteristics of wajd alluded to here are physical changesof state, trembling, etc., which are also characteristic of a stateof fear.)14T.S. 356.13–15: AbewAlc al-Redhabarc (d.322/934) is askedabout listening to musical instruments. The questioner says thathe considers it lawful, for he has reached a stage where differ-ences in states of consciousness (aSwAl) do not affect him. AbewAlc replies that the questioner has reached somewhere, by God!,but that place is Hell!15T.S. 375.3–6: Abe Bakr al-Kattanc (d.322/934) comments onthe various types of samAW. For ordinary people, it is ‘followingnatural inclinations’; for initiates, it is desire and fear; for friendsof God (awliyAX), it is a vision of benefits and grace; for knowers"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE33(al-WArifCn), it is direct witnessing; for the ‘people of Truth’ (ahlal-SaqCqa), it is revelation and witnessing; and each one of thesehas their own place and ranking.16T.S. 375.9–13: Al-Kattanc is also reported as saying that thelistener to samAW ought to find more than just refreshment – itcauseswajd, or yearning, or being overwhelmed, which destroysevery settled and familiar notion.17T.S. 432.14 –16: AbewAmre al-Zujjajc (d.348/960) was askedaboutsamAW. He replied that the state (SAl) of someone whoneeds the stimulation of samAW is inferior. samAW is the weakestof states (presumably meaning it induces the weakest of states).If the SAl is strengthened, continues AbewAmre, there is surelyno need for samAW and the sounds of musical instruments.18T.S. 498.4 – 6: A rather enigmatic statement from AbewAbdAllah al-Redhabarc (d.369/980) to the effect that dhawq (taste,or direct experience) is the first thing felt by a person in ecstasy(al-muwAjCd). When slanderous people (ahl al-ghCba) drink ofthis experience, they go astray (or: lose their reason); whenpeople of the Presence drink, they live happily.19T.S. 500.10 –19: Redhabarc speaks at length about samAW. Thereare three aspects to its secret: the eloquence of its expression,the subtlety of its meaning, and the soundness of its method.(This evidently refers to samAW as poetry recitation.) Similarlywith melody, there are three aspects: fineness of nature, per-formance, and correct rhythm. One who is sincere in his samAWhas three aspects to his secret: knowledge of God, fulfillingone’s dues, and integrity of intentions. The place where onelistens requires three qualities: sweet air, good lighting, anddecorum; and the absence of three things: the contrary distrac-tions, people who are ashamed, and those who seek pleasure oramusement. One hears from three groups: the Sufis, the poor,and those who are friends of them. One hears in three ways: bylove, by wajd, and by fear. Movement comes about throughthree things: pleasure (Uarab), fear, and wajd. Pleasure has threesigns: dancing, clapping, and joy; fear has three signs: weeping,striking with the hand, and sighs; wajd has three signs: absence,bewilderment (i{UilAm), and crying out. (This is almost a mini-ature ‘rule’ concerning the practice of samAW, where there is asomewhat artificial use of threefold categories).20T.S. 512.12–14: Abe Qasim al-Razc (mid fourth/tenth century)is quoted as saying that there is a great danger in samAW unless"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE34one has sufficient knowledge, a genuine altered state of consci-ousness (SAl), and wajd which is overwhelming, and not indulgedin for pleasure.The issues arising from these references to samAWand wajd in theOabaqAt al-ZEfCya will be dealt with later in the present work.The minor writings of SulamcThere are a few references to our subject in some of the other minorwritings of Sulamc. In his JawAmiWFdAb al-ZEfCya (Collections ofSufi Manners), a short work dealing with etiquette, there is a pericopedevoted to a story about musayn al-Nerc (d.295/908) which alsoappears in Sarraj’sKitAb al-LumaW.36 The basis of the story is Nerc’sinability to enter into ecstasy at a samAw session, and his recital ofsome love poetry which causes all those present, himself excluded,from entering into an ecstatic state. Sulamc uses this story as anexample of the Sufi masters keeping things hidden, not disclosingthe real nature of their altered states, and their use of metaphorrather than plain language.The other minor work of Sulamc where there is a significantreference to our subject is the KitAb al-ArbaWCn fCXl-Ta{awwuf (Book ofForty Traditions concerning the Sufi path).37 This is a short pamphletcombining Sufi and SadCth elements, following the established customof including forty Traditions in the one work, preceded by completechains of transmission. Each SadCth is introduced by relating it to aSufi custom, identified with the words and deeds of the Prophet, andthus ensuring its legitimacy.The second last chapter of the KitAb al-ArbaWCn is titled ‘Concern-ing the permissibility of samAW’. In this chapter the SadCth referringtowfxisha is related, of the Prophet entering her home on a festivalday when there were two singing girls present. Abe Bakr enters andrebukes the music, but the Prophet allows the performance becauseof the festival. This Tradition is also cited by Sarraj and Ghazalc asevidence of Prophetic support of the practice of samAW, while AbeBakr’s rebuking is cited by opponents of the practice as evidence ofdisapproval.38These scattered references to samAW in the writings of Sulamc areincluded without any editorial additions from the compiler. Thereis a generally positive tone to these references, however, and the lastexample is included in a compilation of Sufi customs which claims"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE35Prophetic approval. This suggests that Sulamc was favourably in-clined toward the practice, as does his general tolerance displayed intheOabaqAttoward the spectrum of Sufi customs and behaviours.Sulamc’s writings are a valuable source of information about earlySufi tradition concerning our subject area, and they provide worth-while materials for discussion later in our study.Qushayrc and his RisAlaAlso originating from Khurasan, two generations later than Sulamccame a famous pupil of his, Abexl-Qasim al-Qushayrc.39 A scholarand mystical theorist, Qushayrc is best known for his apologeticsummary of Sufi teaching and terminology, the RisAla(Treatise).Born in 376/986 into a property owning family in Ustuwax, heonly began his religious education in earnest after visiting Nishapurfor business reasons. He met the Sufi shaykh, AbewAlc al-Daqqaq,and became a disciple, later marrying his daughter and succeedingthe master on his death in 405/1015. Meanwhile, Qushayrc hadlearned Shafiwc law in oes, and studied Ashwarc theology with scholarsin Nishapur. Performing the pilgrimage, he studied SadCth in Baghdadand the Hijaz, and began teaching this on his return to Nishapur in437/1046.During the next decade he was involved in theological strugglesin Nishapur between the manafc and Ashwarc-Shafiwc factions. Atone point an uprising led to his imprisonment for some weeks in446/1054. Two years later he was summoned by the Caliph al-Qawim(d.467/1075) to teach SadCth in Baghdad. On returning to Khurasanhe settled in oes to avoid his manafc opponents, now dominant inNishapur. When the vizier Nivam al-Mulk (d.485/1092) tempor-arily restored the balance between the factions, Qushayrc returned toNishapur, where he died in 465/1072. He was buried in the institutewhere he had taught, the Madrasa al-Qushayrcya.Of his writings, most are devoted to mystical topics, such as avoluminous Qurxan commentary, LaUA Xif al-IshArAt(The Subtletiesof Guidance), written before 410/1019. The very short ArbaW RasAXilfCXl-Ta{awwuf(Four Treatises on the Sufi Way) is a collection ofthree brief treatises on mystical topics, followed by a didactic poemof 39 verses. His most famous work, however, is the RisAla, writtenin 438/1046. In many ways it follows the pattern of Sarraj’sLumaW,being apologetic and defensive of the legitimacy of Sufi teachingand practice, and also providing explanations of characteristic ter-minology and concepts. Some of the material in the RisAla is also"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE36derived from the LumaW, though Qushayrc’s discussions are not asdetailed or extensive as those found in Sarraj’s work.The book begins with a short introductory section on the principlesof unitary experience (tawSCd), a fundamental doctrine of Sufism.This is followed by a substantial section devoted to technical terms,explaining Sufi concepts and vocabulary. The main section of thebook follows, building from the preceding chapters into a fullydeveloped exposition of Sufi theology along conceptual lines. Thissection on the ‘stages’ of the Sufi path begins with tawba(repent-ance),mujAhada(struggle), and so on through the characteristictheological topics, ending, it so happens, with samAW.A third section of the book recounts matters relating to visions,miracles and special states of the Sufi masters. The final section ofthe book provides a biographical survey of 83 Sufi masters, somenotices only a few lines in length, others amounting to several pages.In this section the style of his teacher Sulamc is evident, with thepattern of the OabaqAt al-ZEfCya being adopted. A short notice isgiven with the full name of the person, his/her associates or teachers,sometimes the date of death, but little else. This is followed by anumber of quotations or teachings ascribed to the master, some-times in the form of SadCth reports with transmission details.In his introduction to the RisAla, Qushayrc openly acknowledgesthe apologetic aim of his writing.40 The Sufi movement having falleninto disrepute, and being publicly slandered by opponents frommany sides, Qushayrc felt the need to rebuff false accusations andmistaken notions about the Sufi path. In addition to this task ofdefence and apology, Qushayrc also aimed to correct erroneous teach-ings which had misguided many aspirants of the path. By explain-ing its true doctrines, he helped to strengthen disciples on the path,and to rebut the false allegations of opponents. His solid defence ofthe Sufi way on Ashwarc principles prepared the ground for the laterand more brilliant work of Ghazalc.The chapter on samAW in the RisalaThe chapter on samAW in Qushayrc’s work is not extensive, somefourteen octavo-sized pages in the edition consulted.41 It appears asthe last chapter of the main section on ‘stages’, which is really anexposition of Sufi theology and practice, presented thematically.Stylistically, the author’s writing resembles that of Sarraj. Thereare generous quotations from traditional sources, the Qurxan,SadCth,and Sufi masters, interspersed with the author’s own opinions and"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE37arguments, and with generous quotes from Qushayrc’s own mas-ter, AbewAlc al-Daqqaq. The author’s personal comments do notdominate, however. He is content to allow the revered sources totake centre stage by presenting them with a minimum of editorialinterpretation.Qushayrc begins with quotations from the Qur’an which purport-edly refer to samAW, and are supportive of the practice. The vagueapplicability of these verses and their remote connection to samAW isapparent in all these quotations, as we have noted above with Sarraj.The main concern of the author, however, is to argue for a cautiousacceptance of the practice. He claims that listening to poetry withmelodies and music is generally ‘permissible’ (mubAS) by religiouslaw, provided nothing repulsive or unlawful is heard, and that freereign is not given to desires or idle amusement (Ris. 336.4 –10).That the Prophet and his first followers are known to have listenedto recitation provides a further reason for its acceptability. Listenersshould apprehend poetry for its morally uplifting qualities, increas-ing the desire for obedience and remembrance of God’s provisionfor His servants. The author argues that samAW is a ‘recommended’or ‘rewarded’ (mustaSabb) act for religious purposes, though ‘volunt-ary’ (mukhtAr) rather than obligatory as far as revealed law isconcerned.The author mentions certain SadCths concerning the Prophet’sacceptance of samAW and Qurxanic recitation. Those involving wfxishaand her acceptance of the singing servant girls are given promin-ence by Ghazalc in his treatment of the subject. Qushayrc on theother hand is more restrained and offers a plain summary account(Ris. 337–8).Many sayings and narrative anecdotes of the Sufi masters arepresented, some more or less verbatim from Sarraj’s account. Thereis no particular conceptual order to these quotations, which fill theremainder of the chapter. The sayings are almost always supportiveofsamAw, or they proclaim certain dogmatic points. The narrativeaccounts are also illustrative of some phenomenological aspects ofthe practice in its social setting, or in its effect on the lives of theSufi masters.There is no discernible underlying argument which links togetherthis diverse material. It is presented as a collection from varyingsources, with very little structure imposed by the author. This con-trasts with Sarraj’s basically conceptual arrangement, and moreparticularly with Ghazalc’s highly ordered and carefully argued pres-entation using similar source material."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE38While many of the sayings and narrative accounts are similarto those of Sarraj’sLumaW, perhaps being derived from this earliersource, there are some which show interesting differences. Onenotable example is the account of Dhexl-Nen’s arrival at Baghdadand his participation in a samAw session. In Sarraj’s version, Dhexl-Nen rises in ecstasy, and then falls down again, perhaps in a typeof faint. Another participant in the ceremony imitates the beha-viour of the visiting master, but Dhexl-Nen reprimands him for hispretence of ecstatic behaviour (LumaW 289.20–290.7). In Qushayrc’saccount there is no mention of the other participant at all, whileDhexl-Nen’s fall causes blood to trickle from his forehead, butwithout his actually touching the ground! (Ris. 344.4 –9.)The differences in these accounts could have been formed at anynumber of points, particularly in their pre-literary stages, as oraltransmission of these traditions preceded their written versions.Sarraj’s earlier account is not necessarily more trustworthy, but amodern reader would probably give priority to the earlier versionbecause of its precedence.Qushayrc’s reliance on the earlier work of Sarraj is not oftenmentioned, but at one or two points he specifically quotes Sarraj ashis source for some material (Ris. 345.11). It seems also that othersources, written or oral, were used by the author in his compila-tion, since some of the material preserved by Qushayrc is not foundelsewhere.Qushayrc’s chapter on samAW does not compare favourably withthat of his predecessor, Sarraj. The work tends to lack some direc-tion and purpose, and shows less than a keen interest in the topic.The fact of its relative brevity also leaves one with a sense of dis-satisfaction with Qushayrc’s work. It has limited value beyond rein-forcing the earlier writing of Sarraj, though it does provide a secondversion of similar source material. It required the genius of Ghazalcto produce a masterful rewriting and development of these sourcesin new and fruitful directions.Ghazalc and the ISyAX WUlEm al-DCnWith Ghazalc and his major work, the ISyAX WUlEm al-DCn (TheRevival of the Religious Sciences), we arrive at the zenith of Sufiwritings on samAW. Not only does Ghazalc encompass all that waswritten earlier on the subject, but he transforms his source materialinto a masterly work by the extraordinary genius of his mind."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE39Sulamc was recognised as a diligent collector of SufiSadCth andbiography; Sarraj and Qushayrc are valuable sources of early lore andtraditions, moulded partly by their editorial oversight. In Ghazalc,however, we read the distilled arguments and reflections of a masterphilosopher, rhetorician, theologian and teacher who guides, per-suades and impels us by the force of his reason to see the truth ofthe subject. His chapter on samAW and wajd in the ISyAX is not a merecollection of sayings gleaned from the Sufi masters; it is a powerfulargument for the legitimacy and the value of these practices, care-fully reasoned, and the result of long deliberation. What Ghazalchas to say on this subject is always enlightening, and his argumentsin favour of the value of samAW are comprehensive and attractive.His work is the culmination of Arabic writing on the subject at leastfor the formative period of Sufism.The details of Ghazalc’s life are well known, and easily accessible;they do not need repetition here.42 It suffices to say that it wasduring the period of his retirement from teaching at Baghdad, inthe years 488/1095 – 499/1106, that he composed his great work, theISyAX WUlEm al-DCn. During this period of his life, following a crit-ical breakdown, and his voluntary departure from his distinguishedteaching post, he resided in Damascus and oes, though also under-taking several other journeys, including a pilgrimage to Mecca. Havingregained the certainties of faith and knowledge which he lostduring his period of crisis, he spent many years as a recluse, livingin poverty, and spending most of his time in meditation and spiritualdisciplines.The writing of the ISyAX in approximately the last decade of hislife, therefore, represents the author at his most mature and reflect-ive stage. The ISyAX is encyclopaedic in its contents, being a ‘com-plete guide for the devout Muslim to every aspect of the religiouslife – worship and devotional practices, conduct in daily life, thepurification of the heart, and advance along the mystic way’.43The lengthy chapter on samAW and wajd, titled KitAbFdAb al-SamAWwaXl-Wajd(The Book of Manners concerning Listening and Ecstasy),covers some thirty-six and a half pages in the folio Cairo editionused for this study.44 The chapter is found in the second volume oftheISyAX which deals with WAdAt or social customs.What distinguishes this treatment of the subject from earlier writersis not so much the materials used – these are largely the same aswith Sarraj and Qushayrc– but the masterly way in which the authordeals with the issues. At every point the reader encounters the"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE40clear, logically based arguments of the mature philosopher who isin complete control of his subject. He writes in an engaging andvery readable style, his lack of formality perhaps being due to thefact that Arabic was his adopted, rather than first, language.45 He alsoshows himself as a great teacher and orator who is able to demon-strate and persuade by his arguments. In the chapter on samAW, thereader is brought into contact with a powerful intellect, not with amere compiler of traditions. One of the most attractive aspects oftheISyAX is to watch this intellect at work, and to witness the creat-ive way in which familiar materials are transformed by Ghazalc’srationality and spirituality into something profound and original.In the following analysis, the chapter on samAW from the ISyAX istreated thematically, rather than in the order presented by Ghazalc.There is also some reference to other writers on the subject, andtheir differences from Ghazalc’s approach.The legal focus of GhazalcIt is clear that the ISyAX builds on the work of Ghazalc’s predecessors,such as Sarraj, who is acknowledged at one point (ISyAX II.297.20).It is not surprising, however, that given his legal and dialecticaltraining and inclination, Ghazalc is more concerned with questionsof the legal status and permissibility of samAW, and the intricacies ofthe associated legal arguments. Whereas Sarraj devotes only twoshort sections to the question of permissibility, Ghazalc takes upmost of the first half of his whole discussion in dealing with thisquestion. Even in the second part of the work, the question is neverfar from his mind, with occasional references to the legal aspects ofsamAW appearing. Again, Sarraj devotes the final chapter of his KitAbal-SamAW to listing reasons why some people disapprove of the prac-tice. Ghazalc, on the other hand, engages these arguments head on,and attempts a vigorous rebuttal of these objections (ISyAXII.282.7-end 284). This illustrates the dialectical commitment of the author,and his readiness to defend his principles and show up the weak-nesses of his opponents at every opportunity.There is a relatively short section dealing with the actual legalityof samAW near the beginning of the discussion (ISyAX II.268.14 –273.1).The author begins with an outline of the methodological require-ments for determining such questions, namely the use of appropriatetextual evidence and the use of analogous arguments.The principal reasoning used for samAW is that of the acceptabilityof beautiful sounds, which has textual corroboration in the Qurxan"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE41andSadCth, both directly and indirectly by analogy. In this, Ghazalcfollows similar lines to those laid down by Sarraj. The acceptabilityof listening to beautiful sounds in nature, such as bird song, isextended to the sounds made by musical instruments. Such listening,furthermore, cannot be condemned simply because it gives pleas-ure, else all pleasurable activities would be prohibited. The authorthen digresses into a discussion of the prohibitions surroundingwine drinking, evidently to illustrate the reason for banning certainmusical instruments because of their association with drinkers anddrinking.Singing and recitation of poetry is considered next, the mainargument here being that since something spoken is acceptable ornot because of its content, this is not altered by its being sung ordeclaimed. Arguments from SadCth are presented on the acceptabil-ity of recitation and listening to poetry.As well as arguing strongly for the permissibility of samAW, Ghazalcis also forthright in cataloguing the situations where the practice isforbidden. It was noted above that Sarraj outlined the prerequisitesfor listening on the part of novices. Ghazalc, however, takes a moresystematic and proscriptive approach, setting out five specific situ-ations where samAW is prohibited (ISyAX II.279.7–281.19).The first situation is where the performer is a woman on whom itis unlawful to gaze, or a beardless youth. This is forbidden becauseof the fear of temptation occasioned by the performer’s presence,not because of what is recited or sung.The second occasion is where certain musical instruments areplayed, namely those associated with wine drinkers and mukhan-nathCn, usually referred to as ‘effeminate artists’.46The third situation involves the censorship of language used inrecitation or singing. Obscene or indecent language is prohibited, aswell as mocking or speaking falsely about God, the Prophet andhis companions. The erotic introduction to the poetic genre of theqa{Cda is not prohibited, but the male listener ought to avoid the sinof applying its descriptions to a woman forbidden to him by law.Ghazalc goes on to say that one who is in love applies all amorousutterances to himself and his beloved, whether the latter is humanor divine. By means of illustrative stories the argument is advancedthat verse which gives rise to unintended interpretations cannot bebanned. Rather, the onus is on the listener and the application orunderstanding of what is heard.The fourth situation concerns the young person in whom desireand lust are strong, and who may be easily aroused by the erotic"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE42descriptions contained in poetry. Such desires are part of the forcesof Satan, and hence samAW must not be allowed for these people.The fifth occasion where it is prohibited is with the ordinary personwho is not a Sufi but who listens simply for the sake of pleasure.Ghazalc remarks on the difficulty of generalising in legal dis-cussions about what is allowable and what is not. First, not everypermitted action is allowed in excess, such as eating, which in excessbecomes gluttony. Second, something permitted may on occasion dodamage, hence it must be then prohibited. The example offered isthe eating of honey, which in medieval medicine was not permittedif the person was feverish. Conversely, wine is normally forbidden,but is allowable if a person is choking and there is nothing elseavailable. The author states that all such generalisations in legalterms have exceptions, and hence samAW with its restrictions con-forms to this pattern.47The epistemological emphasisThere are several occasions in the chapter on samAW where Ghazalcdigresses to raise questions of epistemology and the nature of know-ledge. The discussion of these issues shows the underlying philo-sophical inclination and purpose of Ghazalc’s writing.Following a discussion of ecstatic states and the perception ofthose who encounter them, the author makes a brief digression onthe topic of perception in general (ISyAX II.277.25-end). He recog-nises the difficulty of the person who is ‘dull, who has a hard heart(and) is forbidden the pleasure of listening’; such a person is amazedat the pleasure of listening and the effect it can produce. Similarly,those who lack a particular faculty wonder at the pleasure thatfaculty can give. The reason for this is that pleasure is a type ofperception which requires intelligence and the power of perceiving.Thus if the latter is incomplete, the pleasure resulting from thisperception cannot be imagined. Ghazalc offers some examples fromthe five senses and the power of reasoning, and concludes: ‘Like-wise is the experience of listening in the heart. Following from thearrival of sound at the ear, it is perceived by an inner sense in theheart; one who does not possess this (inner sense) inevitably findsno pleasure in it.’In another section where the author discusses the mystical stateoffanAX or ‘passing away’ from ordinary experience, he presents abrief outline of the intimacy experienced by one who is ‘immersed’in mystical knowledge (ISyAX II.288.11–16). One who is infatuated"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE43with what one ‘sees’, such as the Sufi experiencing wajd, does not payheed to the means of seeing, the ‘eye’ or ‘heart’, because of this stateof immersion. Similarly, the drunkard has no knowledge of drunk-enness, or the epicure of pleasure, inasmuch as neither can dispas-sionately describe the drunkenness or pleasure in terms of causesand effects. Ghazalc seems to maintain that such intimate know-ledge is different to knowledge about something, i.e. of the dis-passionate, ‘scientific’ variety. One who learns something intimatelyis shown that knowledge by that thing alone. Moreover, it is oftena momentary state; knowledge comes like a flash of lightning whichdoes not last. If this flash did continue it would overwhelm humanfaculties, such as happened to Abexl-musayn al-Nerc who eventu-ally died as a result of being overwhelmed by wajd.What is interesting about this short discussion is the way in whichknowledge is related to revelation or to mystical insight rather thanto mundane ‘scientific’ or empirical learning. Ghazalc is certainly notdiscounting the latter, but he advocates a more passionate, intimateand thoroughgoing insight into nature which can only be gained bydirect experience, and is similar to the insight gained by revelation.The notion of the lightning flash of insight has a curiously modernaspect to it, as this is one of the current ways of describing thecreative process of scientists and mathematicians.48 It is also note-worthy that Ghazalc takes such a refreshingly modern view on theperennial question of the object–subject dichotomy in epistemology.Qurxanic recital and the arousal of emotionGhazalc raises a most important question concerning the fact thatoften the recital of the Qurxan fails to elicit an emotional responsein a listener, whereas the recital of secular poetry readily achievesthis. It was noted above that Sarraj dealt with this issue to someextent in the LumaW, but Ghazalc devotes considerably more spaceto an explanation of why this occurs (ISyAX II.293.15 –298.15).As a preliminary answer to this question, the author cites numer-ous instances where the Prophet and his companions did indeedexperiencewajd or ‘emotion’ at the recital of the Qurxan. A numberof anecdotes are also related concerning some of the prominentSufis who similarly experienced ecstasy. Most of these anecdotesare similar to those related by Sarraj in the LumaW and need not beof concern here. Ghazalc notes that the main point to these illustra-tions is that ‘one who has a spiritual sense is not devoid of emotionwhile listening to the Qurxan’ (ISyAX II.295.9)."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE44Approaching the question directly as to why listening to the Qurxansometimes has no effect, Ghazalc cites seven reasons.49First, the Qurxanic verse recited may not accord with the listener’sstate of mind, unlike secular poetry which is designed to arouseemotion. Allied to this is the fact that many parts of the Qurxanare legal or prescriptive texts which obviously do not provoke anemotive response. Surprisingly, however, the author argues that evenprosaic texts can arouse wajd if one considers legal passages, forinstance, in the light of God’s providence for His creatures, andso on.Second, the Qurxan is often a memorised text and as such has lesseffect than a verse of poetry heard for the first time.Third, poetry is metrical, which provokes more effect than thenon-metrical Qurxan.Allied to this are the fourth and fifth reasons, the recital of secularpoetry using melodies in certain keys, and their support by variousrhythmic means.Sixth, secular song may not accord with a listener’s state of mind,leading him to reject and disregard the song. This cannot be allowedwith the Qurxan which must appeal to all people. Ghazalc seems toimply that the addition of meter, rhythm and melody enhancespoetry’s appeal to those receptive to it. Conversely this means thatthose who are not receptive will reject or dislike the poetry. In thecase of the Qurxan this cannot be allowed, nor can individual inter-pretation or application of meaning be permitted on these grounds.The seventh reason, the essence of Ghazalc’s argument accordingto K. Nelson,50 is directly attributed to Sarraj. Ghazalc summarisesthe earlier writer’s statement that the Qurxan is uncreated, and revela-tion of the least part of it to created hearts produces bewilderment.Poetry and music, on the other hand, being created, have a rela-tionship with our human passions and qualities which they caneasily arouse.As was mentioned in the analysis of Sarraj’s use of this argu-ment, there are real problems in this division between created anduncreated texts. The alleged power of the Qurxan to have such over-whelming effects is problematical when the issue under discussion isits failure to elicit emotive responses. There is here a highlightingof the fact that secular poetry plays upon human emotions with-out the Qurxan being able to elicit responses appropriate to itsstatus as an inspired text. This seventh reason of Sarraj’s is a some-what forced argument with special pleading, however theologicallynecessary."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE45In concluding this discussion, Ghazalc relates a story of Abexl-musayn al-Darraj’s (d.320/932) meeting with Yesuf b. al-musaynal-Razc (d.304/916 –7). Yesuf weeps at the recital of a verse of secu-lar poetry after a whole morning’s recital of the Qurxan had failedto elicit any response from him. To explain this, and to summarisehis argument, Ghazalc states:When hearts are inflamed by the love of God, an unusualverse rouses in them what the recitation of the Qurxan doesnot. This is because of the metre of the verse, and its affinitywith human nature . . . As for the Qurxan, its constructiontranscends literary styles and modes, and is thereby weak-ened; nor does it share in the human faculties (ISyAX II.298.9 –12)Fadlou Shehadi in his analysis of this aspect of Ghazalc’s thoughtmakes the appealing argument that there was an antagonism on thepart of some more conservative writers toward singing and music.This may have been due to the competitive edge which these formsofsamAW had over recitals of the Qurxan. This seems to be reflectedeven in Ghazalc, who was not so conservative, by the lengthy sec-tion devoted to the question of why secular recitation has suchemotive effects.51The decorum of ‘listening’ sessionsGhazalc includes in his discussion of samAW a section on AdAb (‘man-ners, decorum’) of listening sessions (ISyAX II.298.18–302.12). Thisenables us to gain some insight into the practices at such sessions,and some knowledge of the participants’ behaviour and activities.Ghazalc’s brother Majd al-Dcn (d.520/1126) has left a valuableaccount of the conduct of a samAWceremonial in his short treat-ise,BawAriq al-IlmAW (Gleams of Guidance). The section on AdAb intheISyAX, however, though not attempting a detailed description,is just as significant for its incidental details. It throws light, forinstance, on the practice of dancing and tearing one’s clothes dur-ing trance. This allows us indirectly to gain a better picture of suchsessions.Ghazalc begins his discussion with an explanation of Junayd’ssaying that ‘Listening requires three things. . . the (appropriate)time, place, and companions.’ Ghazalc emphasises the need for aquiet place without other activities, and the need for like-minded"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE46companions who are not ostentatious; otherwise it is better to re-frain from the practice.A second rule concerns the readiness and suitability of novices oryoung people for samAW. There are several reasons which make somemembers of the Sufi community unsuitable. Some only perceive theoutward signs of the Sufi path, and have no inclination or ‘taste’forsamAW; with these people it is just a waste of time. Those whosepassions are still strong ought not to be allowed to participate sinceit is a mere gratification of desires for them. Those who are ignor-ant of spiritual and theological knowledge ought to be forbiddenbecause they may gain false and heretical understandings of thespiritual matters revealed during samAW. Moreover, anyone whoseheart is preoccupied by worldly concerns or who listens solely forpleasure ought to be prevented from participating.The third rule is a short list of etiquette for listeners. Among theelements noted are the need for attentiveness, stillness, silence, andsitting with bowed head. One should not look at others, clear thethroat, yawn, clap, dance or talk. If one is overcome by wajd result-ing in involuntary movements, one should return to a quiet stateas soon as this passes. Ghazalc makes a digression to discuss theseinvoluntary movements during ecstasy, claiming that the intensityof the overwhelming experience does not necessarily correspond tothe amount of observable physical activity. Rather, the most per-fect form of trance is that which produces complete stillness.The fourth rule continues this theme, arguing that restrainingoneself from ecstatic activity or from weeping is acceptable, but sois dancing and weeping, provided there is no deception or pretencein these activities. The tearing of garments, however, is not accept-able unless it is done involuntarily. One reason for this prohibitionis that the act of tearing garments is wasteful of precious cloth, yetif tearing yields pieces of cloth which can be used for mending othergarments, then it is acceptable!The final rule relates to obtaining the assembly’s approval andconsent for whatever activities are carried out, and also followingthe particular group’s customs. Ghazalc mentions, for example, thatsome groups remove all their turbans when a person goes into tranceand loses their turban; others remove outer garments when some-one tears their garment and it falls off. This is done for the sake ofcomradeship and politeness. Similarly, one should not dance if thisactivity is disapproved by the group, and so on.This section on the decorum of samAW adds much detail to ourknowledge of the practice of this activity. It is often the incidental"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE47details that provide us with valuable information which is otherwisepassed over by authors concerned with other issues.This short survey does not exhaust the variety of contents and argu-ments in this remarkable chapter of Ghazalc’sISyAX. An attempt hasbeen made, however, to illustrate the quality of argument and thetypes of issues dealt with by the author.Hujwcrc and the Kashf al-MaSjEbThe previous writings on samAW considered in this study were allwritten in Arabic; the two remaining works to be discussed, how-ever, are both in Persian. The first of these, the Kashf al-MaSjEb(Revealing the Veiled), is the oldest and most authoritative treatiseon the Sufi path in the Persian language.The author of the Kashf was wAlc b. wUthman al-Jullabc al-Hujwcrc,a fifth-century mystic who died in about 465/1072.52 Hujwcrc was anative of Ghazna, but spent the last years of his life in Lahore,where he wrote his only surviving book. The details of his life aremostly drawn from incidental references in the Kashf. He appearsto have travelled widely, like Sarraj and Sulamc before him, meetingmany Sufi masters and paying homage to the shrines of those whohad died. He was taken as a prisoner to Lahore, and lamented theloss of his library in Ghazna while he was composing the Kashf.The work itself is similar in structure to Sarraj’sLumaW; indeed,it appears that Hujwcrc modelled his book on the former. Writtenin the later years of the author’s life, it answers questions posed bya certain Abe Sawcd al-Hujwcrc (d.?). It is a systematic treatise, aim-ing to present a complete system of Sufi doctrines and practices.Hidayet Hosain explains that ‘Before giving his own opinion, theauthor usually examines the opinions of earlier writers on the sub-ject, refuting them if necessary; these discussions of the problems ofmysticism are illustrated by examples drawn from the writer’s ownexperience.’53Unlike Sarraj, there is less of the apologist in Hujwcrc; the workwas not composed in order to persuade sceptics, but to teach aspir-ing Sufis. There is nevertheless a great reliance on the earlier workof Sarraj, as well as on the writings of Sulamc and Qushayrc.The section on samAW is a lengthy chapter which comes at thevery end of the work. In substance, there is a great similarity withSarraj’sLumaW, as many of the illustrative stories and quotationsfrom authorities are identical. Hujwcrc’s editorial style is also like"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE48that of Sarraj, with the exception that there is more reliance onpersonal experience and a greater offering of personal opinions.A further difference is the author’s more circumspect view ofwajd and the more emotive or excessive activities associated withsamAW such as dancing, tearing of garments, etc. Though he acceptsthe practice in general, he is cautious about any excesses whichmight denigrate its value. His view of samAW as a whole may perhapsbe summed up in the statement, attributed to Hujwcrc’s own shaykh,that it is ‘the viaticum of the indigent: one who has reached hisjourney’s end hath no need of it’ (Nich. p.405).samAW in the Kashf al-MaSjEbThe chapter on samAW begins with a short section in which Hujwcrcargues for the superiority of the sense of hearing in the religiousdomain. One comes to know the necessity of belief through hearingboth the Qurxan and the Prophetic Traditions. Oral tradition andthe speech of the prophets is primary to faith, and superior to theimportance of sight, of witnessing, or of miracles.Hujwcrc then expounds on the value of hearing the Qurxan, as themost beneficial type of samAW. In this, he follows the lines laid downby Sarraj, drawing on arguments largely from SadCth.The next section deals with the permissibility of listening to secu-lar poetry, which Hujwcrc approves of, based on Prophetic example.Listening to erotic imagery, however, is regarded as forbidden, onthe analogy that hearing a description of something unlawful isitself unlawful. For Hujwcrc, this is a black and white situation,and there is no hint of the more subtle interpretation advanced byGhazalc in the ISyAX. For Ghazalc, erotic imagery is acceptable pro-vided it is applied to a lawful spouse, or used with reference tomystical love.Hujwcrc next deals with the acceptability of hearing beautifulvoices, and hence melodies and music. Again there is a similaritywith Sarraj’s earlier arguments, such as the effect of the cameleer’ssong on his beasts, and the therapeutic effect of pleasant sounds.The author also allows the use of musical instruments provided noevil or frivolous intention is present.In a chapter dealing with the principles of samAW (Nich. pp. 402ff ),Hujwcrc uses a binary distinction between those who listen to thespiritual meaning, and those who listen to the physical sound. Thisis based on the principle that when a person’s temperament is evil,what he hears will be evil, and vice versa. Numerous illustrations of"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE49this tenet are provided by the author, including the saying attributedto Dhexl-Nen that samAW is ‘a Divine influence (wArid al-Saqq)which stirs the heart to seek God: those who listen to it spiritually(ba-Saqq) attain unto God (taSaqqaqa), and those who listen to itsensually (ba-nafs) fall into heresy (tazandaqa)’ (Nich. p.404).Hujwcrc describes the various stages of the Sufi path, as begin-ners, those in the middle, and the advanced, each with correspond-ing stages of samAW activity. The beginner’s temperament is ‘nowisecapable of (enduring) the word of God, but is overpoweringlyimpressed by the descent of that spiritual reality, so that some losetheir senses in audition (samAW) and some die . . .’ (Nich. p.407).Some illustrative stories are offered, illustrating ‘crisis’ outcomesfor those inexperienced in dealing with the effects of samAW.Reflecting the structure of Sarraj’sKitab al-SamAW, Hujwcrc con-cludes his discussion with an outline of the reasons why some Sufisdisapprove of the practice of samAW. Thus Prophetic Tradition iscited, along with other arguments familiar to us from Sarraj. There isalso the argument not encountered before that samAW can be a demonicinstrument. Abexl-wAbbas al-Ashqanc (d. mid-fifth/eleventh century)is quoted as saying that he witnessed a samAW assembly where hesaw naked demons dancing among the others and breathing on themso that they ‘waxed hot’ (Nich. p.412).wajd and related topics in the KashfHujwcrc offers a rather abstract discussion on the nature of wajdandwujEd, claiming that the former is ‘grief ’ or loss of the objectof desire, while the latter is ‘finding’ or attainment to the object.This is an astute binary distinction, recalling Qushayrc’s dichotomyofbasU and qabQ,54 or the more common ‘hope’ (rajAX) and ‘fear’(khawf), such categories being useful for their theoretical neatness.Whether this provides an adequate description of the effects ofsamAW and accounts for the narratives related in the source materialsis another question. Many of the phenomena recorded in Sarrajand Sulamc cannot be categorised in this simple binary way.Hujwcrc briefly describes tawAjud as ‘taking pains to produce wajd’,and he goes on to approve of this behaviour. Dancing (raq{) and‘gazing at youths’ are proscribed by Hujwcrc as forbidden activities(Nich. p.416). The practice of tearing one’s garments is approvedby the author, first on the basis of its practical usefulness: the torncloth can be reused. In addition, it can be seen as a gift to the per-former, or used as a blessing, much like a holy relic."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE50Hujwcrc concludes the discussion as a whole by outlining a numberof rules on the conduct of samAW sessions. These include severalorganisational requirements, such as the need for a spiritual dir-ector to be present, that there be no uninitiated people present, thatthe performer be respectable, and so on. There are also a numberof ‘controlling’ conventions mentioned, aiming at keeping the per-formance and the participants ordered and restrained. For example,one must allow the impact of ecstatic states to proceed smoothly,without interference from others, and without disturbing otherparticipants. The author concludes by warning about the dangersofsamAW, and its possible corrupting influence, especially on youngpeople. With a short prayer for himself, the author swiftly ends thisdiscussion, and his book as a whole.The value of Hujwcrc’s contribution does not at first appear to begreat. It certainly has not the originality and profundity of Ghazalc’swriting, nor the breadth and detail of Sarraj. Nevertheless, there isvalue in some of the editorial contribution and original argumentsput forward by the author. The extent of this contribution will beseen later in the present study where issues raised by all the sourcewriters will be discussed. Moreover, though there is some repetitionof material found in Sarraj and Qushayrc, the small differences indetail are often noteworthy, as is the way in which Hujwcrc adds hisown explanation to incidents which are related without editorialadditions in the earlier sources.wAuuar and the Tadhkirat al-AwliyAXThe final source used in this study is the famous biographical workby the Persian poet, Farcd al-DcnwAuuar. The Tadhkirat al-AwliyAX(Memorial of the Saints) is justly known as one of the principalworks of early Sufi biography and hagiography; it is a storehouse offolklore, deeds, sayings, doctrines and miracles attributed to theearly masters.The details of wAuuar’s life are rather sketchy; there is no scholarlyconsensus on the dates of his birth and death, the latter being placedfrom 586/1190 to 627/1230.55 It is certain, however, that he livedmost of his life in Nishapur, and that he followed the profession ofpharmacist/doctor, having a shopfront in the city where he attendedto his patients. Few other reliable details can be gleaned from hisnumerous writings, as they are works of religious allegory and poetry,containing very few topical references."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE51Most of wAuuar’s works are religious poems using the structure ofrhyming couplets known as mathnawC form, and containing myst-ical subject matter. The best known of these is the ManUiq al-Oayr(Speech of the Birds), an allegorical poem dealing with the Sufi pathto God as the quest of thirty birds for the mythical royal bird, thesC-murgh (‘thirty birds’).TheTadhkirat al-AwliyAX is wAuuar’s only prose writing, being awork of hagiography, a memorial to the lives, deeds and words ofthe early Sufi masters. wAuuar lists his reasons for writing the work,most having to do with the benefits gained from remembering thewords and deeds of the Sufi ‘friends of God’. The pious motives ofhis writing probably explain the numerous miraculous and legend-ary accounts which he includes in the Tadhkirat. The factual accur-acy of his biographies was not a matter of concern for such a writeraswAuuar. The Tadhkirat cannot be judged by modern standards ofhistoriography; it is often much more liberal in dealing with thefantastical elements in the lives of the Sufis than its predecessors,such as Sulamc’sOabaqAt.This presents a problem for our intended use of the Tadhkirat asa source for phenomenological accounts of the experience of samAW.wAuuar can so freely recount fantastical and miraculous events aspart of the daily fare of the Sufis. How much less cautious will he beto include accounts of dissociation and altered states of conscious-ness caused by samAW. This is likely to present a problem for most ofthe sources looked at so far; but the fact of wAuuar’s excess in the useof the miraculous makes it much more acute in his case.There are various answers to this problem. First, it is inevitablethat some exaggeration or ‘gilding’ will occur in hagiographies wheremodern notions of historical accuracy are quite misplaced. What-ever distortion takes place, however, the fact that there are other,earlier sources mitigates this difficulty, at least in the case of wAuuar.Related to this is our ability to generalise from particular instances.The more examples of the phenomenon of altered states found inthe sources, the more evidence we have to distil the common andmore universal elements which are important for our discussions.Exaggerated or fantastical phenomena will tend to be eliminated inthis way, as the more common experiences will tend to be the moretrustworthy.Moreover, despite this liberality as regards the miraculous, it isof note that in dealing with the phenomena of samAW and alteredstates,wAuuar is remarkably cautious. In what could be seen as anavenue where the miraculous and supernatural could have full scope,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"SAMFW IN EARLY SUFI LITERATURE52he is notably circumspect. As will be shown later in specific instances,wAuuar does not let his imagination loose in this area. He is inclined towrite with restraint and subtlety, a fact which argues for the credib-ility and trustworthiness of his narratives.Some of the sources of wAuuar’s biographies can be traced; forexample many of the narratives are found in the earlier works con-sidered in the present study. There is a great deal of material in theTadhkirat, however, which cannot be traced further back. The authorappears to have had access to individual writings of the Sufis, dir-ectly or through quotations, and to other oral and written sourcematerials.In terms of the style of the work, it is noted for its entertainingand lively character, which suggests that it was meant for a wideaudience. Iranian scholars comment on the simplicity, directnessand ‘sweetness’ of the language used, in this regard quite unlike theflorid and verbose style often associated with later Persian writers.56The form of each biography maintains a standard pattern. Thereis first a short encomium of the Sufi, often in rhymed prose, followedby a generally chronological account of life events, usually by meansof narrative anecdotes, often dramatic and full of colour. This isusually followed by a series of sayings attributed to the person.Finally there is a narrative surrounding the events of their death,and dreams about the deceased related by others, explaining howthey fare in the next world. There are a few exceptions to this pat-tern, most notably in the case of Abe Yazcd al-Bisuamc, where thereis an extended account of his miWrAj or symbolic ascent journey,withwAuuar’s explanation.The parts of the Tadhkiratof value for our subject are oftenshort, isolated fragments of sayings about samAW or wajd, or longeranecdotes involving altered states and other such experiences. Thereis no sustained or thematic presentation of the subject, owing to thebiographical nature of the work. This being the case, there is littlevalue in listing here the scattered references to samAW. These will bepresented in the body of the present study, particularly in referenceto the psychological discussions.Notes1 For an overview of this literature see Caesar E.

In order to understand the intentionsof these writings, it is crucial that the reader has a clear knowledgeof the language and vocabulary used by the various authors.The unusual nature of the subject matter and its experientialcharacter means that discussion of these phenomena will be fraughtwith difficulties. Writers in this field readily acknowledge this prob-lem. William James, for example, in his classic Varieties of ReligiousExperience, cites ineffability as the first criterion of mysticism: ‘Thesubject of it immediately says that it defies expression, that noadequate report of its contents can be given in words.’1 Sarraj ac-knowledges a similar situation in regard to his own discussion: ‘Howcan one describe something which has no description other thanitself, and to which no witness can stand other than itself ?’ (LumaW313.7– 8). The subjective nature of these experiences also means thatdescription in terms of ordinary language can only be partial andinadequate.Given this situation, it is vital that the reader is equipped withsome understanding of the vocabulary of the authors being studied.The subtleties of the language employed must be carefully weighedin order to appreciate more fully the meanings being conveyed.There are several other reasons why a close study of the vocabu-lary and semantics of these writings is required. There are a numberof key terms, such as wajd,SAl,qalb, which are crucial in under-standing the nuances of Sufi writings. We cannot assume that thesewords mean what their usual signification would imply, particularlyas the writings we are considering come from a period in the historyof Sufism when a special vocabulary was still in the process of beingdeveloped."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE56The significance of this special terminology is noted by Qushayrcin his introduction to the section of his RisAla which deals with thissubject. Qushayrc writes that all groups have special vocabularywhich enables mutual understanding and unveils secrets for thatgroup. Conversely, this vocabulary hides understanding from out-siders so that their language is unintelligible to opponents or otherslikely to misunderstand, and prevents their secrets being divulged.He goes on to assert that the truths expressed in special languageare not assembled by artifice or devoted effort, nor from free usage,but are placed by God in people’s hearts (Ris. 53). The importanceof special terminology among the Sufis in the linguistic develop-ment of the early Islamic centuries has been documented in thewell-known works of Louis Massignon and Paul Nwyia.2 The scopeof these earlier studies does not, however, extend to many of thematerials being considered in this book.It must also be acknowledged that the standard dictionariesof Arabic, both native and Western, do not generally include a dis-cussion of usages peculiar to mystical writings. There is thus norecognised source or reference work which accurately gauges thevocabulary of the particular authors being considered here. Thisis why Nicholson, in his edition of the KitAb al-LumaW, included aglossary of unusual and special usages which is indispensable forreading the text. There also exist some specialised Sufi dictionar-ies, that of wAbd al-Razzaq al-Qashanc (d.730/1330) being the bestknown.3 Unfortunately, Qashanc’s work is of limited usefulness,owing to his particular view of the subject through the eyes of post-Ibn al-wArabc theosophy. Moreover, he usually takes no account ofthe historical and theological development of Sufi terminology.This issue of historical development and a diachronic approachto language is important for our present purposes. The writers beingconsidered all come from toward the end of the formative period ofSufi history. Thus their own particular terminology may differ quitemarkedly from that of quoted sources from an earlier period, whereless standardised language may have been in use. There are alsovarious doctrinal emphases reflecting various ‘schools’ where differ-ing terminologies were used.The special nature of the writings being considered here requirescareful attention to the semantics involved. Even if we have anadequate picture of the semantic range of a particular word, weshould not assume conformity to this range in all situations. It shouldalways be kept in mind that the author, or the mystic uttering anecstatic saying, may be extending the limits of his language in order"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE57to express an unusual experience or concept. In addition to this, weshould also be aware of the possibilities of multivalence in the lan-guage being used. The significance of linguistic expression cannot berestricted to a single level of meaning. Indeed, one of the methods ofinducing a dissociative reaction to samAW documented in the sourcesis through ‘misunderstanding’ a spoken phrase because of its multi-valent or homophonic characteristics.The less than adequate handling of mystical language in the stand-ard dictionaries, and the tendentious approach of Sufi lexicons suchas Qashanc’s means that a re-examination of linguistic sources isneeded. In this study, the primary sources are of course the texts ofthe authors themselves. Second, there are a selection of dictionaries,native and Western, which need to be considered. The most import-ant native dictionary used here is Ibn Manver’s (d.711/1311) LisAnal-WArab, which, in the words of John A. Haywood, ‘aimed at full-ness, not brevity, and which was the recognised exhaustive work evenuntil modern times’.4 The dictionaries of E.W. Lane and R. Dozyare the principal Western sources.5 Third, there are some studiesrelating to the vocabulary of the Sufis, such as those of Massignonand Nwyia referred to above, and some other shorter articles.Methodologically, the primary evidence of the source writings wasconsidered first, with a listing of key words in their contexts, and apreliminary surmise of the meaning. This material was then exam-ined in the light of the secondary sources, the dictionaries, glossaries,and other studies mentioned above. The resulting descriptions pre-sented here are thus individual word studies relating to the semanticrange of key concepts in the source writings.samAWThe most obvious word to begin with is samAW, a verbal noun fromroots-m-W, and with the basic meaning of ‘hearing’, and by exten-sion ‘that which is heard’. This may apply, therefore, to singing, orany musical performance or other pleasant sound in which the earstake delight.6 Thus poetry recitation, which is a type of singing, isincluded in this, as the LisAn7 has it: ‘all which the ear finds delight-ful of a beautiful sound (or voice) is samAW’ (vol.8, p.165). From thiswe find its application to the Sufi tradition of musical concert, in amore or less ritualised form. Jean During explains that samAW isconsidered to be ‘nourishment of the soul’, a devotional practicewhich can induce emotional transport, states of grace, ecstasy, andrevelations. During asserts that"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE58The very sense of the term samAW. . . suggests that it isactually listening which is spiritual, since music or poetrydo not necessarily have a sacred nature. ‘Hearing’, on theother hand, can be applied to any sound, natural, artificialor artistic . . . (samAW is thus) a synonym of ‘understanding’,in other words, comprehension, acceptance and applica-tion of the Revelation, and the practice of samAW, beyondecstacy or rapture, can be an unveiling of mysteries, a meansof attaining higher knowledge . . .’8This seems a highly diffuse definition of samAW which is specific toSufi understandings of the term, but there is at least the basis of thisunderstanding in the root sense of s-m-W. Thus in the LisAn (vol.8,pp.162– 4) the various configurations of the root often imply accept-ance and action on what is heard, particularly in regard to ‘hearing’God’s word. If something is not accepted and acted upon, it is asthough it were not heard. There is also the sense of ‘understand andretain’ in the usage of the imperative forms of the verb.SarrAjThe earliest author we are considering uses the term samAW ratherless frequently than expected. In the first chapter of the KitAb al-SamAW, for instance, the term is not used at all, whereas sawt (‘sound,voice’) and naghma (‘voice, melody’) appear almost as substitutes.Elsewhere, Sarraj uses samAW only seldom, seeming to avoid thisterm, in contrast to Ghazalc who employs it frequently.This may indicate that the author had in mind certain specificmeanings for the term outside of which its use was inappropriate.Thus the common sense of ‘hearing, listening’ as a general term isseldom employed.Sarraj’s usage of the term falls into two categories, the first refer-ring to listening to poetry, to sonorous or beautiful sounds, and thecommunal activity of samAW concert which involves such ‘listening’.The second category relates to the mystical aspects of the term,which may not necessarily involve communal activity or listening toaudible sounds. This type of samAW may involve quiet converse withGod, devotions leading to states of grace or to revelations, as wellas the emotional transports associated with receiving audible orspiritual stimuli.Examples of the first category, where the term is used in a mun-dane sense, include LumaW 271.11 where samAW means ‘listening to"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE59poetry’. Similarly at 277.1 the author refers to al-Shafiwc (d.204/820)as permitting samAW and the chanting of poetry (al-tarannum biXl-shiWr). The other sense of samAW in this category is that of communalconcert, referred to at 272.4 where Junayd is quoted as saying thatthose who listen to samAW require three things: the (appropriate) time,place and companions. Similarly, at 288.18, 290.18 and elsewhere,there is mention of samAW where people are gathered and someone isreciting verse, whether a qawwAl (professional reciter) is mentionedor not.The second category, where the term is used in a mystical sense,presents greater difficulty for semantic analysis. The precise conceptwhich the author had in mind is often elusive, in accordance withthe difficulties mentioned in the introduction to this chapter. Theexamples given below illustrate the nature of the problem.Sarraj first uses the term in the second chapter of the KitAbal-SamAW where several ‘definitions’ are offered. Thus Junayd’s state-ment that samAW is ‘the arrival of the Truth which arouses heartstoward the Truth’ (LumaW 271.9) refers to the revelatory aspect ofthe concept, and its divine origin. The author quotes Abe Yawqebal-Nahrajerc (d.330/941–2) who speaks of samAW as ‘a state whichindicates a return to the mysteries (of the heart) after its beinginflamed’ (LumaW 271.13 –14). This is a subtle and ambiguous expres-sion, but by no means unusual.Less obscure usages of the term occur later where samAW is re-ferred to by Abemusayn al-Nerc as an ascetic practice, like prayerand other devotion, which defines the Sufi as such, and is preferableto social converse (LumaW272.12 –13). This solitary practice cannothave anything to do with listening to poetry in a ritual setting, butrather is part of the ascetic’s devotional converse with God. This isreinforced by the observation of al-musrc (d.371/982) that there isno value in samAWwhich ceases when the person listening to it stopshearing; it must be continuous (Lumaw 272.18 –19). This is similar tosamAW associated with listening to Qurxanic recitation or dhikr as adevotional practice (LumaW 280.2ff; 283.1ff ).A different notion of samAW, containing a more theoretical orabstract element, occurs in discussions about the classification ofvarious stages attained by Sufis in this practice. Thus AbewUthmanSawcd b. wUthman al-Razc (d.298/910) is quoted as dividing samAWinto three categories: first, novices and beginners who claim toexperience more exalted states of consciousness than is really thecase; second, the sincere (al-{iddCqCn) who seek an increase in theirexperienced states; and third, the sincere from among the knowers"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE60(al-WarCfCn) who are completely open to any divine impression dur-ing their devotion (LumaW 277.17–278.3). There are several similarthreefold classifications mentioned by Sarraj; these categories dividethe practitioners of samAW into various groups, rather than beingindicative of differing shades of meaning in the concept itself.Occasionally, however, samAW is referred to in a different sense asthe highest of mystical attainments, similar to the concept of fanAXand the experience of tawSCd. After speaking of the sublimity of thisattainment, and its near ineffability, the author describes the high-estsamAW as being ‘in God, and to God, and is from God, and isdirected to God. Those who experience this are those who are atone with the true nature of things and have passed beyond thevarious states of feeling and have ceased acting and speaking . . .’(LumaW 279.8 – 9). In another passage the author describes in lessexalted language the notion of samAW as parallel with wajd, both ofwhich, in the ideal practitioner, are more or less permanent statesexperienced with equanimity (LumaW 293.15).This overview of Sarraj’s usage of the term shows the great varietyof senses which he allows for samAW. The use of the term falls intotwo main semantic areas: first, listening to poetry or recitation, andthe communal concert associated with this, and second, as mysticalconverse, devotion, or revelation, and as an expression of the highestmystical experience. Within these broad areas, however, there arenumerous distinctions, some of which are almost certainly lost tous now.SulamCIn considering the writings of Sulamc, a similar pattern of usageemerges; the term is not encountered frequently, but there is a largesemantic range for the word samAW. There appears also a similardistinction between secular or mundane references, listening to sing-ing or poetry, and communal concert, and the second categorymentioned above of mystical reference involving devotional prac-tices and influencing states of consciousness.In the first category there is the simple use of samAW as ‘hearing’ areciter’s declamation of poetry (T.S. 205.5 – 6; 500.11). The term isthen used by extension to refer to communal concert or listeningsessions, as mentioned in T.S. 119.4; 239.8 –10; and JawAmiWFdAbal-ZEfCya, sect.150. A further distinctive use of the term refers to thesemantic or language component of the poetry or other recitation"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE61being heard. AbewAbd Allah al-[ubaysc is quoted as saying thatsamAW which is ‘plain’ is welcome, that which is allusive is feigned,and the subtlest is that which is obscure or difficult except for theinspired listener (T.S. 329.7ff ).In the second category of mystical reference, there are again anumber of discrete semantic differences evident. Abe Bakr al-Kattancis quoted as listing various degrees of samAW corresponding withclasses of Sufis: beginners, those near to God, those who knowmysteries, and so on. Their samAW consists of fear or desire, visionsof grace, revelation and seeing, and so on (T.S. 375.3 – 6). Kattancis also quoted as saying that samAW is not simply ‘refreshment’(mustarwiS), rather it should provoke emotion (wajd) or yearning(shawq), or a state of being overwhelmed, and it should destroyevery fixed or learned notion (T.S.375.9–11).A rather enigmatic statement of AbewAmre al-Zujjajc accordstosamAW the quality of being one of the ‘weakest’ of states since itrequires stimuli (presumably of an aural nature) to provoke it; if itwere stronger, it would not require listening or musical instruments(T.S. 432.14 –16). This statement indicates a shift in meaning ofsamAW from ‘listening’ or ‘something heard’, to ‘the state induced bythat hearing’.QushayrCWith Qushayrc’sRisAla there appears little advance on the usagesoutlined in the earlier sources. Since a good portion of the RisAlachapter on samAW is adopted more or less verbatim from Sarraj,there are frequent overlaps and similarities, especially in relation tothe many narratives and direct quotes from the early Sufi masters.Those sections of the chapter which contain Qushayrc’s own state-ments show a basic distinction between ‘listening’ or ‘hearing’ in aneveryday sense, and the use of samAW as a special mystical term. Forexample, at the beginning of his discussion, Qushayrc states hisoverall position succinctly: that listening to poetry with beautifulmusic is permitted, given the usual conditions of its being in accord-ance with religious law (Ris. 336). This usage is the everyday senseof ordinary listening. The special sense of samAW is in evidence in astatement of Junayd’s that in the covenant of Alast, ‘the sweetnessof listening to spiritual words was poured forth’ (Ris. 340).Many usages of the term appear to be in the everyday senseof listening to poetry or music, often implying listening in special"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE62sessions or concerts. In accordance with Qushayrc’s adaptation ofmuch of his material from Sarraj, there is no perceptible semanticdevelopment associated with samAW.GhazAlCThe word samAW is used frequently in Ghazalc’s chapter on thistopic in the ISyAX. As well as a high frequency of usage, there is alsoa wide variety of meanings associated with the word. These fall intothree main categories, with some subsections in the two latter cat-egories, as summarised below:The semantic range of samAW in GhazalcAThe simple physical act of hearing or listening.B(i)The act of intentional listening to poetry or music, which mayhave legal consequences involving permissibility or prohibition,and often but not always associated with the following:(ii) SpecificsamAW concert sessions or gatherings.C(i)A mystical concept involving ‘hearing’ associated with SAl (atransient ‘state’); or as a Sufi conceptual term in a theoreticaldiscussion.(ii) A mystical concept including converse, revelation or knowledgefrom God.(iii) The highest stage of understanding and ecstasy with the mostintimate mystical knowledge.Examples of usage A, the simple physical act of hearing, occurfrequently in the first pages of Ghazalc’s discussion (ISyAXII.266.18,20,22,25, etc. Mcd. pp.199–200) and throughout the chapter wher-ever this sense is required.Usage B(i) occurs, naturally enough, in discussions of legalquestions, particularly concerning the permissibility of listening torecitation or music (Thus ISyAX II.266.27ff; Mcd. pp.201ff ).Examples of B(ii) are not very numerous; however, at ISyAWII.287.10 (Mcd. p.713) there is the story of a certain Sufi who ‘hadnot attended samAW for many years’, the evident meaning being‘communal concert or recitation session’.Category C presents more intricate problems of definition andappraisal; it must be noted that the distinctions listed in the tableabove are only provisional. The evidence of context is often notsufficient to pinpoint accurately the author’s intended sense. Given"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE63these caveats which apply particularly to this category C, there area number of clear instances where the sense is transparent. For C(i),the term being used as a general mystical concept, Ghazalc writes of‘the Sufis and those philosophers who have considered the relationofsamAW to the soul’ (ISyAX II.289.5; Mcd. p.719), or ‘the first stepinsamAW is understanding what is heard,. . . then this understand-ing has ecstasy as its fruit’ (ISyAX II.285.1; Mcd. p.705).Examples of C(ii) include references to mystical converse or re-velation, not simply listening to a voice or music, even in Sufi con-certs, but with a sense of the disclosure of knowledge, or a revelationof some sort from the divine source. Thus, Ghazalc relates a storyconcerning a young dervish who fainted and died upon hearinga verse recited, thinking that it was God speaking directly to him.In commenting on this, the author writes: ‘The purport is that thisman considered himself drowning at the time through his state (ofconsciousness) in relation to God Most High, and through the know-ledge that he was too weak to be constant in the beauty of intimacywith God, and through grief at the changing of his heart and itsturning from the laws of Truth’ (ISyAX II.286.4 –5; Mcd. p.709).Ghazalc goes on to argue that one whose samAW is from God requiresa previous understanding of the nature of God so that the disclosuresreceived do not lead to error or unbelief.An example of C(iii), samAW as the highest stage of mystical expe-rience, of understanding and ecstasy, occurs in Ghazalc’s explana-tion of Nerc’s last ecstasy. Nerc was present at a samAW sessionwhen he heard a verse which caused such an ecstatic reaction thathe wandered about in a trance, repeating the verse to himself, andoblivious to the pain caused by his stumbling onto a thicket of sharpreeds. The injuries he sustained eventually led to his death somedays later. Commenting on the incident, Ghazalc writes that ‘this isthe stage of those who are faithful in understanding (fahm) andecstasy (wajd), and is the highest of these stages, for samAW throughstates (aSwAl) is lower than the stages of perfection. . . which isthat the subject should pass away totally from himself and his states’(ISyAX II.288.21ff; Mcd. p.717). In this way, Ghazalc describes Nerc’ssamAW as an advanced stage of mystical experience and knowledge,a stage upon which he had elaborated earlier in the discussion.Ghazalc had described the samAW of ‘one who has passed beyondstates and stages’ as heedless like the women who saw the beauty ofJoseph (Qurxan, Sera 12), or like the drunkard who is completelyimmersed in his experience and oblivious to all description of it(ISyAX II.288.6ff; Mcd. pp.715ff )."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE64HujwCrCIn the earliest Persian author studied here, there is found a similarrange of meanings for the term samAW as in Ghazalc’s writings. Thisis not surprising, as similar sources were used by both authors, andHujwcrc lived only slightly earlier in time than Ghazalc.To use the same categorisation as that used above with Ghazalc,there are found examples of samAW indicating physical hearing ofsounds, as in the chapter devoted to ‘sounds and melodies’ (Kashf520.4ff; Nich. pp.399ff ). samAW as a concept subject to legal con-sequences is also found quite frequently, in particular relating tothe communal assemblies of the Sufis, and their organisation (Kashf524.4ff, 544.16ff; Nich. pp.401–2 and 418 –20).Where the term is used in a mystical sense, there is inevitablymore ambiguity in its reference. There is one slight difference withboth Persian writers, Hujwcrc and wAuuar, from their Arabic coun-terparts. This is the use of the term samAW, often in association withthe verb kardan (‘to do, make’), and the noun SAl (‘state’), to indi-cate ecstatic mystical experience. Thus Nicholson translates: ‘Fool-ish aspirants to Sufiism, seeing the adepts absorbed in ecstasy duringaudition (samAW), imagined that they were acting from a sensualimpulse . . .’ (Nich. p.398; Kashf 519.14ff ). The literal sense of thecrucial phrase here, mC kardand samAW bi-SAl, indicates a closer con-junction between samAW and ecstasy than this translation affords.Thus rather than ‘absorbed in ecstasy during audition’, the sense ismore ‘absorbed in ecstatic listening’. This may seem only a minorpoint, but other examples of this usage of the term in both Persianwriters indicate a distinct extension of meaning. In fact this sense ofsamAW is found without the addition of SAl, as in Kashf 521.2 (Nich.p.399): ‘The nightingale became silent and went into ecstasy (u-samAW mCkard).’There are other examples of the mystical sense of samAW, in linewith the categorisation used for Ghazalc, but these are mostly repeti-tions of the same sources used in that work.WAUUArThe term samAW is not used frequently in wAuuar’sTadhkhirat, butwhere it is, there is more evidence of the phenomenon noted abovewith Hujwcrc’s writings. Thus, the term seems to indicate the effectsofsamAW, ecstatic reactions and experiences, as much as the ‘listen-ing’ itself. There is thus a convergence of samAW with wajd, perhaps"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE65because of the close associations between the two in practice. Forexample, Junayd reports a dream in which he questions Iblcs aboutthe opportunities he has for tempting people. Iblcs replies that he‘sees’ people who ‘fall into samAW and wajd’(T.A. I.276.8). SimilarlyatT.A. II.32.7–10, Junayd explains physical reactions to samAW (i.e.the phenomenon of wajd) as caused by remembering the joy of thecovenant of Alast.wajdThe term wajd and other derivatives from the same root, particu-larlytawAjud, are of similar importance to the subject of this studyas the previous samAW.wajd is usually translated into English as‘emotion’, ‘ecstasy’ or ‘rapture’, and these rather vague equivalentsdemonstrate the difficulty of finding precise and useful meaningsfor the word. While ‘ecstasy’ or ‘rapture’ may conjure up for us aset of behaviours indicating an unusual state of mind, or a feelingof exhilaration, this is often not what is meant by the use of wajd inSufi writings. The behaviours indicated by wajd might include trem-bling, agitation, sweating, pallor, rigidity, spontaneous speech orcrying out, fainting, and so on, and there is often no mention of joyor exhilaration. Such behaviours could well indicate to us a suddenonset of illness or seizure rather than what is normally understoodby ‘ecstasy’.Instead of trying to find an English term which describes suchbehaviours adequately, it may be better to adopt a functional defi-nition. In this way, a working definition of wajd might be thosebehaviours or physical signs resulting from the aural stimuli of samAWin its various forms. This definition covers a wide range of beha-viours which are associated in Sufi writings with listening to verse,music, sounds, or direct communication with the divine.The Sufi writers themselves often preferred to ‘derive’ this wordfrom the root wajada in the meaning of ‘find, attain, discover, orknow by experience’.9 Ghazalc is representative in his definition ofthe term thus: ‘These states are called in the language of the Sufiswajd, derived from wujEd (‘finding, discovery’ and ‘encounter’); thatis, one encounters in one’s self states which were not encounteredbefore listening to music or verse’ (ISyAX II.277.19–20 Mcd. p.229).Hujwcrc, finding other root meanings for the cognates wajd andwujEd, defines the former as ‘grief ’ or ‘pain’, and the latter as ‘finding’(the object of desire), detailing at length a bipolar explanation ofmystical experience in these terms (Kashf 538.13ff; Nich. pp.413ff )."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE66Such ‘derivations’ and attempts at etymology are ingenious, butare ultimately inaccurate, post hoc ‘popular’ etymologies. They doreveal, however, the way such terms were understood, and theyshed some light on the areas of experience designated by these words.These two notions of ‘finding’ and ‘grief ’, for example, recur oftenin Sufi discussions about wajd, the latter notion often surfacing as‘passion’ or ‘emotion’ more generally. By this means, the physical orfunctional features outlined above are accounted for, while at thesame time both these senses can be traced back to the root meaningofwajada.Qushayrc offers a more grammatically informed approach totawAjud (usually meaning ‘pretence at, or imitation of ecstasy’). Heargues that the term involves ‘seeking’ or ‘summoning’wajd byvoluntary means; thus it is not a perfect form of wajd. For Qushayrc,tawAjud is not a perfect attainment because it involves much strivingand fabrication or pretence, and it remains far from being verifiable(Ris. 61).SarrAjA similar approach to that of Ghazalc and Hujwcrc mentioned aboveis demonstrated in the relevant chapters of Sarraj’s writings. Theonly attempt at definition, such as that recorded of Junayd, is alongthe lines of Ghazalc’s noted above: that of ‘encountering’ (mu{Adafa;LumaW 301.2). Yet in several places the ‘emotive’ aspect of wajd isbrought to the fore. In a discussion about recitation of the Qurxan,the author cites wajd in a series with riqqa,{afAX, and taladhdhudh,‘tenderness, serenity, and delight’ (LumaW 284.6 –7). Elsewhere, wajdis juxtaposed with riqqa and hayajAn, the latter meaning ‘excitement,agitation’, and the former in this case ‘sensitivity’ (LumaW 296.7).Even more indicative of the emotive sense of this term is its use inparallel with iStirAq, ‘burning’, describing the arousing effect ofsome types of samAW on the heart (LumaW 295.14).These examples show part of the wide semantic range of wajd;there is also evidence to show that Sarraj was aware of a morefunctional usage. In discussing his theory of what may be calledsympathetic resonance, i.e. that samAW produces a sympathetic emo-tive response in the listener, the author states that: ‘their heartscannot contain this, and they begin to utter words due to theiremotive response (wajd)’ (LumaW 296.16 –17). This shows the termbeing characterised by its effects, in this case uttering words orsounds (yanUiqEn) in an apparently involuntary fashion. Following"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE67a discussion of Junayd’s explanation of wajd as ‘encounter’, Sarrajoffers his own contribution as follows:Do you not see that with one of those (experiencing this)he is quiet at first, and then he becomes agitated and beginsto groan and sigh. There may be another who is strongerthan this, and he is at rest during his experience, and noth-ing is evident of these (external signs).(LumaW 301.9 –11)This goes part of the way toward a functional explanation of thephenomenon, in contrast with the theological explanations whichpreceded. Sarraj states, however, that external effects are not alwaysindicative of the experience, and thus a purely functional approachis not sufficient.GhazAlCAs with the other authors being considered, there are numerousexamples of the term being used by Ghazalc with little indication ofits meaning.Two examples where functional aspects are highlighted providesome indication of the semantic range. First, in a discussion of thenecessity of direct experience to enable true understanding, Ghazalcstates that ‘the foolish, the frozen, and the hard of heart, who aredenied the pleasure of music and poetry, marvel how the listenertakes pleasure, and at his ecstasy (wajd), disturbance of emotion,and change of colour . . .’ (ISyAX II.277.25 –26; Mcd. p.230). A sec-ond statement is more direct in explaining wajd purely as an effectofsamAW: ‘Definitive statements concerning samAWandwajd arenumerous, and there is no reason to cite many of them, so let usconcern ourselves with understanding the meaning for which wajdis the expression: we say that it is an expression for a state whichsamAW produces; and it is a truthful arrival (wAridSaqq), followingclosely from samAW, and which the listener encounters from his soul’(ISyAX II.290.3 –5; Mcd. p.722). This comes close to a functionaldefinition which is not dependent on behavioural symptoms or otherexternal criteria. It is also inclusive in accounting for the wholespectrum of behaviours and psychological states associated with theappearance of wajd.Two other examples of the term being used by Ghazalc illustratedifferent aspects of its meaning. First, the term is used in association"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE68with the verb wajada, which is cited in parallel with Uariba, ‘be movedby emotion, delight’, the sense of one verb following the other, orelse used as synonyms. Relating a story of a young boy who threwhimself off a mountain in an ecstatic state of marvel at the wonders ofGod, Ghazalc comments that ‘he was so moved by emotion (Uariba),that he fell into an ecstasy (wajada), and through the ecstasy casthimself down’ (ISyAX II.279.4; Mcd. p.234).A related example shows the similarity of the state of wajd to thatof drunkenness. The author states: ‘Of those who fall into ecstasy(wajd) there are some overcome by a state similar to drunkennesswhich confounds their reason’ (ISyAX II.286.21–22; Mcd. p.710).HujwCrCReference has been made above to Hujwcrc’s explanation of wajdandwujEd which is based on the author’s understanding of the rootsenses of the verb. The explanation centres around wajd being takenin the sense of Persian andEh (‘grief ’), and wujEd as Persian yAftan(‘to find’). This distinction leads to a bipolar analysis of the effect ofsamAW, as ‘grief ’ at the loss of the beloved, a painful affection of theheart arising from joy or sadness, and ‘finding’ or attaining theobject of desire, removal of grief from the heart, and so on (Kashf538.14ff; Nich. pp.413ff ). This scheme is similar to other such bipo-lar analyses familiar in Sufi literature. Whether the polarity advo-cated by Hujwcrc is of value remains doubtful in view of theartificiality of his analysis, and his desire to explain a whole rangeof emotions and states in terms of simple, contrasting elements. Theartificiality is also seen in the author’s use of the term wujEd whichis not found elsewhere in discussions of wajd, and only appears inlater Sufi writings in a different meaning, particularly in connectionwith Ibn al-wArabc’s philosophy.10WAUUArThe hagiographical and non-thematic nature of wAuuar’s writingmeans that the term wajd only arises in a documentary fashion inthe context of actual descriptions and recollections of events fromthe lives of the Sufi masters. Such a non-theoretical approach isvaluable, however, in showing the semantic range of the word.It is related of Sahl Tustarc (d.282/896) that when he heard samAW,wajd would become manifest in him, which included a kind of trance"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE69state lasting about three weeks. During this time he would not eat,and though it was winter, he would sweat profusely such that hisclothes would be drenched. As well, he declined to speak of hisexperience during this time, since his words ‘would have no benefit’ toa listener (T.A. I.255.16 –20). This is a detailed behavioural descrip-tion of one of the kinds of state indicated by wajd. It shows the pro-fundity of the phenomenon, both in physical terms, and in affectingthe thought and speech of the subject.It is related of Abe Bakr al-Shiblc (d.334/946) on three occasionsthat he was ‘overwhelmed by wajd’ (ghalabAt-i wajd), once with theadded description of ‘like one who was drunk’. In this state he wassummoned before the Caliph’s court, and his words in defendinghimself had such a powerful effect that the Caliph dismissed thecharges against Shiblc and sent him home. What is more, the Caliphexperienced a mild state of shock himself, confessing that he wasafraid of falling from his throne! (T.A. II.167.1ff.)wAuuar’s work also includes a number of short sayings by the Sufimasters on the nature of wajd. These are of less value for our pur-poses, because of their theoretical and theologically influenced char-acter, or else are repetitions of sayings found in the earlier sourcesalready mentioned.SAlModern scholars are largely in agreement about the nature ofSAl, usually denoting ‘state’. D.B. Macdonald is representative:‘In mysticism a SAl is a mental condition, given immediately andmomentarily by divine grace, not to be gained by application oreffort, consisting of joy, sorrow, depression, exaltation etc.’11 Manywriters also contrast SAl with maqAm (‘stage’) by stressing the greaterconstancy of the latter, and its achievement by human effort ratherthan as a divine gift.12 Similarly, Nicholson distinguishes ‘stages’as constituting the ascetic and ethical discipline of the Sufi from‘states’ which form a psychological chain.13 In a related way,Massignon definesSAl as a psychic state, a mystic state, or a state ofconsciousness.14Lane15 observes that SAl may denote ‘a fleeting, or quicklytransient, quality’, and this echoes Ibn Manver’s statement thatit denotes ‘the present moment you are in’ (LisAn vol.2, p.190).Neither of these sources relates this to mystical usage, but it isclear that Sufi texts often speak of SAl in this transitory way. This"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE70underscores the root verbal meaning of S-w-l as ‘to change, be trans-formed, shift’.SarrAjIn that part of the KitAb al-LumaW which explains Sufi terminology,Sarraj offers a definition of SAl attributed to Junayd, and one attri-buted to unnamed sources:SAl is what comes upon the servant (of God) at a certaintime (or: ‘momentarily’,fCXl-SCn), and it settles in the heartdue to the presence of contentment and trust and otherqualities. It purifies (the heart) during the occurrence ofthis state and its momentary presence, then it ceases; this isas Junayd has said. According to others, SAl is what settlesin the inmost heart (asrAr) due to the purity of one’s recol-lection of God; it does not cease, but if it does cease thenthis is not SAl.(LumaW 335.1– 4)These two ‘definitions’ are quite different, in fact almost contra-dictory. Junayd’s description mentions the transitory nature of SAl,but the second description stresses its lasting qualities, elsewhereassociated with the concept of maqAm. In line with the modernauthorities cited, the divine granting of SAl is implied in Junayd’sphrase, ‘what comes upon’. As well, the presence of certain qualitiesof the heart is mentioned in association with the ‘descent’ of SAl.Junayd’s description thus provides a succinct but comprehensivemeaning for this widely used term. It may be inferred that, as else-where, Sarraj accepted the view of Junayd, though his actual use ofthe term will not always coincide with this definition.As with other writers, Sarraj uses the term SAl in several non-mystical senses. First, in the plural meaning ‘circumstances’: ‘. . . thereis listening to music or verse for various reasons and in diversecircumstances (liXaSwAl shattAX)’ (LumaW294.15).Second, meaning ‘condition’, ‘spiritual constitution’ or ‘state ofbeing’, as at LumaW 293.4 –5: ‘That which you mentioned concern-ing the weakness of your spiritual constitution (SAluka), by whichyou mean your change in composure and your trembling; now whatis needed to have a strong state of being (qEwataXl-SAl)?’ It could beargued that the more usual ‘temporary state’ applies in both caseshere, but the sense of spiritual constitution or condition is more"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE71appropriate in the context, given the greater permanence of thestate being described.A third distinct sense is that of an everyday, waking state ofconsciousness, as at LumaW 282.2: ‘Then I return to my usual stateof consciousness (aSwAlC), and to the company of people, and noth-ing remains of this (warning from the Qurxan)’; or at LumaW292.15:‘When he returned to his normal state (SAl{aSwihi), I asked himabout what had happened . . .’The senses of SAl outlined here are used far less frequently inSarraj’s work than the usual mystical sense of the term. It is oftendifficult to give an adequate English translation which covers themystical sense of SAl, and the alternatives offered by Massignon,‘psychic state’, ‘mystic state’, or ‘state of mystic consciousness’ arepossible resorts. The term must cover the notions of extraordinaryand uncommon states of experience or awareness, including ela-tion, fear, sorrow, perplexity, among a whole range. In Sarraj’swritings, such detailed contextual considerations are not often pro-vided, and thus the qualities of the SAl being spoken of cannot bespecified.An important distinction here is that Sarraj uses the term in oneof two ways: either in a concrete, phenomenological, experientialsense, or else as an abstract, theoretical term.The first of these denotes the immediate, experienced psychic stateor unusual awareness, often referred to in the course of a narrativeabout a certain Sufi. Examples include LumaW 286.10: ‘Meanwhilethe young man was saying: “By God, You change me with theTruth when I am in a certain state of awareness (fCSAlC)”’; andLumaW 303.2: ‘Their momentary experience is disturbed, and theirstate of awareness (al-SAl) is altered.’The second, more abstract sense, sometimes using the plural formaSwAl, describes more didactic or scholarly concepts, such as attain-ments on the Sufi path portrayed in a schematic or categorical way.For example, at LumaW 272.9: ‘(The second mercy) accords withtheir knowledge, and they speak only when they have reached the‘states’ (aSwAl) of the sincere and the front ranks of the Sufis’; atLumaW 290.10: ‘This is why some of the Sufi masters superintendthe states of awareness (aSwAl) of those lower than their level ofattainment.’SAlhas a wide range of meanings in the writings of Sarraj, and itmay be assumed that there are further subtleties hidden in his text.Unfortunately the context does not always allow for close iden-tification of the sense intended."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE72SulamCTwo occurrences of SAl are noteworthy in Sulamc’sOabaqAt al-ZEfCya. The first relates to a tradition concerning Abemafz al-Naysaberc who would not mention the name of God without duereverence. When he mentioned God’s name, his SAl would changeso that it was obvious to all those present (T.S. 116.6ff ). This use ofSAl as ‘complexion, countenance, outward aspect’ occurs elsewherein Sufi writings to indicate an inner transformation which showsitself in outward change of appearance. The change usually consistsof a brightening or lightening of the countenance, or the appear-ance of light shining from the face.16The second occurrence of note is the use of SAl as an equi-valent of wajd. AbewAbd Allah al-[ubaysc is reported as saying thatwhen someone experiences wajd genuinely, he should be protectedagainst censure or disparaging talk about his SAl (T.S. 330.10 –12).It is evident from the text that SAl is here used interchangeablywith wajd.QushayrCQushayrc’s explanation of the term SAl is similar to that outlinedabove by Macdonald. The Sufi author understands it as an ‘idea’ or‘significance’ (maWnan) which comes upon the heart unintentionallyand without ‘acquisition’ or conscious striving, such as joy, or sor-row, desire, anxiety, and so on; in other words, a state of conscious-ness or mind (Ris. 57). A SAl is granted, whereas a maqAm is acquiredand striven for; the former comes from the divine source while thelatter results from expending effort; in the latter one is secure, whilewith a SAl one advances to the next stage. The transitory aspect,noted in the lexicons, is indicated in Qushayrc’s argument that it isjust like its name: as it descends (taSull) upon the heart, so it van-ishes.17Unfortunately, in the chapter relating to samAW in the RisAla,Qushayrc rarely uses the term SAl in an illustrative or exemplarysense which might allow for an evaluation of its semantic range.GhazAlCThe sense of SAl as equivalent to wajd occurs frequently in Ghazalc’swriting, the term often referring to phenomena which are the directeffect of samAW. For instance, at ISyAX II.266.29: ‘listening to music"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE73or verse yields a state (SAla) in the heart called wajd’. Similarly, at277.26, Ghazalc states that the person who does not value samAW‘marvels how the listener takes pleasure, and at his ecstasy (wajd),his disturbed state (iQUirAbSAlihi), and change of colour’.The momentary nature of SAl is emphasised in Ghazalc’s com-ment on the narrative of a young Sufi who fell into an ecstatic stateand died after hearing some verses of poetry which he understoodas God’s word spoken directly to him. Ghazalc states that ‘he wasimmersed in momentary ecstasy (al-waqt) in his state (bi-SAlihi) withGod’ (ISyAX II.286.4; Mcd. p.709).Later in this same passage, there occurs the notion of SAl as apre-existing state of mind, or spiritual constitution, as mentioned inthe writings of Sarraj above. Ghazalc asserts that the youth ‘heardwhat accorded with his SAl’, evidently meaning his already existingstate of mind, conscious or not (ISyAX II.286.5; Mcd. ibid). Similarly,the sense of returning to one’s usual SAl (ISyAX II.300.3; Mcd. p.6)has this more permanent sense, though it also carries the meaningof everyday, waking consciousness, as discussed above in relationto Sarraj.Finally, as previously indicated in Sarraj’s writings, the theoret-ical, more abstract sense of SAl used as a term of academic discussionis also found in Ghazalc’sISyAX. Rather than describing experientialevents in a narrative setting, such usage occurs in the more scholarlyand didactic sections of the work, as a general theoretical concept(soISyAX II.288.6; Mcd. p.715; and elsewhere).HujwCrCIt was noted above with the concept of samAW that there was anotable extension of meaning in Hujwcrc’s writing. This occurs alsowith the term SAl. Hujwcrc uses the term standing alone to indicatespecifically ‘ecstasy, ecstatic state’: ‘the novice, in being overwhelmedbysamAW, should have such a state of ecstasy (SAl) that his samAWdelivers the wicked from their wickedness’ (Kashf 533.14 –15; Nich.p.409; and elsewhere).WAUUArThere are several noteworthy additions to the semantic range ofSAl discernible in wAuuar’s writings. First, the meanings of ‘condi-tion, spiritual constitution, state of being’ noted above with Sarrajare given a further dimension. In a narrative concerning a disciple"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE74of Junayd who used to cry out aloud when the master spoke, wAuuarrelates that the disciple ‘kept watch over himself so that his SAlremained in place’ (T.A. II.20.16). The evident sense here is ‘com-posure, temperament’ or ‘state of mind’. A second variation on thissense occurs in wAuuar’s biography of Shiblc where the author re-counts that when Shiblc’sSAla was strong, he would go to the mosquein order to preach esoteric teachings (T.A. II.166.15). Either themeaning intended here is, as noted with Hujwcrc, ‘a state of ecstasy’,or else the sense of ‘frame of mind, composure’, which, on becom-ing strong, gave Shiblc the courage and zeal to preach publicly thesecrets of the Sufis.Finally,SAl is used in the sense of ‘experience’, more specifically‘spiritual experience’, or ‘experience of the transcendent’. Near thebeginning of the biography of Sufyan al-Thawrc (d.161/778), forexample,wAuuar relates an episode of Sufyan’s first mystical or tran-scendent experience, commencing as follows: ‘The beginning of hisSAl was that . . .’ (T.A. I.188.22). Several other examples of thisusage occur in wAttar’s work.waqtThis term is used quite frequently in many Sufi writings. On occa-sion it comes close to being a synonym of SAl. If waqt is defined asa very short period of time, distinct from zamAn,18 then it can beused to indicate a transitory or quickly passing state. It is thusdistinct from SAl only in its shorter duration.Massignon, in an article on the concept of time in Islamic thought,argues against this notion of ‘state’, claiming that atomistic, non-durational ‘instants’ of time are meant by such terms as An andwaqt.There are no ‘states’ or constants in the notion of time, neither ingrammar with its verbal aspects, nor in mysticism with its ‘instants’of fleeting experience. This outlook is based on the theological con-struct of God’s creative fiat which orders time not as a continuumbut as a constellation of instants.19 In writing of the term in mallaj’sexperience, Massignon describes waqtas ‘the dissonance which sur-prises, the prick that brings one back to consciousness . . . the instant,like the ecstasy, is a transitory thing, a means, not an end, of grace’.20Gerhard Böwering has written more recently that, for the PersianSufis at least, waqt is often interchangeable with SAl and An. The termis understood as ‘the present moment’ or the present experience,described imaginatively in Qushayrc’sRisAla as the sharp edge of asword, or as bolts of lightning.21"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE75Sarraj underscores the transitory aspect of waqt in his ‘definition’of the term as: ‘what is between the past and the future. Junayd saidthatwaqt is precious since what has passed is not attainable, refer-ring to your breath and your waqt which is between the breath justpast and the one to come; if it passes by while you are negligent inremembering God, then you cannot ever attain it again’ (LumaW342.7–10). Definingwaqt as ‘what is between the past and the future’is a round about way of saying it is ‘the present instant’. This isreinforced by Junayd’s longer explanation concerning the elusivenessof the present moment and its importance and value for remem-brance (dhikr).The Arabic lexicons are not very helpful in giving precision to thetermwaqt. If anything, they tend to extend the time indicated bythe term to a far lengthier period than the Sufis would claim. Lanespeaks of ‘A time; or space, or measure, of time, . . . appointed forany affair; a season . . .’22 There is no indication here of a shortperiod, moment, or instant, as required by the Sufis. There is sup-port, however, for Massignon’s philosophical argument about thenon-durational and divinely ordained nature of time in the verbalroot meaning of ‘determined, defined, limited’ (as to time). Both Laneand Ibn Manver are clear on this point, the latter definingwaqt as‘a determined measure of time’ (LisAn, vol.14, p.107.)SarrAjThe transitory aspect of waqt is indicated in Sarraj’s discussion ofthe onset of ecstatic experience where he writes: ‘How is it with Hischosen ones, those near to Him, with what comes upon them atevery moment (waqt) and occasion (zamAn) and in the blinking ofan eye, or even less . . . ?’ (LumaW 314.7– 8). The juxtaposition ofUarfaWayn(blinking of an eye) indicates the rapid passing of thesestates.Sarraj uses the term in its ordinary non-mystical sense of ‘time’,‘moment’, but it is more common to find the special mystical sensebeing employed. Here the meaning ‘momentary experience or state’is indicated. One example among several is: ‘They hear from thatsomething which corresponds to their mystical states and theirmomentary experiences (aSwAlahum wa-XawqAtahum)’ (LumaW 278.1).Similarly: ‘With regard to their momentary experiences (awqAtihim)and what overwhelms their hearts . . .’ (LumaW 296.15). The trans-lation ‘experience(s)’ seems appropriate on occasion: ‘(Others) dislikethese practices because their states are steadfast, their experience"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE76(wa-XawqAtahum) abounds, their recollection of God is pure . . .’(LumaW 300.5 – 6).SulamCThere are very few occurrences of the term waqt in Sulamc’sOabaqAtal-ZEfCya. One such is in a context which leaves some ambiguity asto whether it is used in a mystical or non-mystical sense. Sulamcrecords an ecstatic outburst by Junayd, occasioned by a walk throughBaghdad alleys in the company of Abexl-wAbbas b. Masreq, wherethey heard a singer reciting a verse. Junayd was overcome withweeping and began to speak longingly of past times: ‘. . . I nevercease to yearn for the origin of my desire, with a keen path, andterrors as my steed, desirous to attain my goal; but look at menow during days of indolence: I yearn for my past times (awqAtC)’(T.S. 240.12–14). This is the most obvious, perhaps literal, meaningof the key term here, translated as ‘times’, corresponding to ‘days’(ayyAm) mentioned in the previous phrase. It is likely, given thehighly charged and poetic nature of Junayd’s utterance, that he isalso alluding to these ‘times’ as ‘moments of ecstatic experience’glimpsed in the past. This is more probable when one compares hisutterance with the rich, allusive language of Junayd’s known writ-ings represented in his letters,23 as well as the many fragmentsof utterances recorded in the early Sufi authorities such as Sarrajand Qushayrc. It is in the style of Junayd’s sayings and writ-ings, and congruent with his desire to prevent the divulgence ofesoteric Sufi teachings, that such subtlety and allusiveness shouldbe present.24QushayrCQushayrc introduces the notion of divine ‘ordering’ or foreordain-ment, perhaps even ‘fate’, in his explanation of the semantic rangeofwaqt. He writes:(The Sufis) intend by the term waqt what happens to themfrom that which God disposes toward them, without theirchoosing it for themselves. They say: ‘So and so is underjudgement of waqt’, i.e. that he has submitted to whatappeared to him from the transcendent realm (al-ghayb)without his choosing.(Ris. 55)"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE77Again there is little use of this term in the RisAla apart from thisformal discussion of its meaning.GhazAlCGhazalc employs the term waqt only rarely in his chapter on samAWin the ISyAX. Two examples are found, the first being a non-mysticalusage of al-awqAt as ‘on occasions’ (ISyAX II.269.3; Mcd. p.209). Inany case, this is simply a quotation from a SadCth, and not Ghazalc’sown statement.In the other occurrence, there is some ambiguity as to whether itis used in a mystical or non-mystical sense. Following a narrativeaccount of a beggar who was overwhelmed and died after hearingsome verse recited, Ghazalc comments: ‘The purport is that thisman considered himself drowning at the time through his state(mustaghriq al-waqt bi-SAlihi) in relation to God . . .’ (ISyAX II.286.4;Mcd. p.709). This is Macdonald’s translation; it is possible, how-ever, that Ghazalc meant ‘immersed in momentary experience in hisstate . . .’, a rendering that is quite feasible given the frequent juxta-position of waqt and SAl in Sufi writings. This is more awkwardgrammatically than Macdonald’s translation, however, and thereare no other examples of waqt used in this mystical sense.It might be suggested that Ghazalc has avoided the mystical senseofwaqt for some reason. He had ample opportunity to employ theterm, as Sarraj did frequently, given the similarity of content andgenre of the two writers’ works.HujwCrCIn the two Persian writers being considered, there is a developmentin the use of waqt to mean virtually the equivalent of SAl or wajd,a development which could be said to continue from where Sarrajleft off.Three examples occur in Hujwcrc’s chapters on samAW. In the first,there is a clear equivalence with SAl meaning simply ‘state, condi-tion, position’ without any reference to mystical concepts. Hujwcrcwrites that some people refuse to practise samAW because they areneither spiritual adepts, nor superficial or sensual people who in-dulge in the practice for amusement. The abstainers claim that ‘it ispreferable for us to be occupied with something suitable to ourstate (waqt)’ (Kashf 538.2; Nich. p.412). This use of waqt appears tobe non-mystical, referring to the position of this group of people in"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE78relation to other believers. They acknowledge that they are not inthe spiritual vanguard, but nor are they intemperate and heedless;they are merely ordinary believers who do not regard the practiceofsamAW as suitable for themselves.In the second occurrence of the term, waqt is clearly equivalent towajd meaning ‘rapture, intense experience’. In describing the effectsofsamAW in causing involuntary movement and agitation, Hujwcrcwrites that ‘throbbing of the heart becomes manifest, and tremblingtakes control of the inner self, rapture (waqt) becomes intense, (and)a state of trembling becomes evident . . .’ (Kashf 542.6 –7; Nich.p.416). The sense of waqt here is either ‘rapture’, as translated, orperhaps ‘moment of intense experience’, which reveals the word’setymology.The third occurrence is somewhat ambiguous as to whether itrefers to a mystical ‘moment of experience’. Discussing the AdAb oretiquette of samAW, Hujwcri is concerned with the person who is notexperiencing any effect, unlike other participants. Such a personshould not regard ‘in sobriety’ those who are ‘intoxicated’, but theyshould be ‘in quest of their own moment of experience (waqt), andestablish that moment’s dominion, so that they may receive its bless-ings’ (Kashf 545.18; Nich. p.419). This appears to be the meaningintended by the author; Nicholson’s translation, however, reads:‘but he must keep quiet with his own “time” (waqt) and establish itsdominion . . .’ This is rather equivocal, though Nicholson’s trans-lation does highlight the allusiveness of the term.WAUUArThe usage of the term waqt in wAuuar’sTadhkirat shows clearly thatfor this Persian writer the meaning of ‘state’ (=SAl) in its varioussenses is dominant.Sahl Tustarc is reported to have been overcome by samAW onoccasion, whereupon he would go into a kind of trance for someweeks, would not eat, and so on. If he was asked questions duringthat period, he would reply that what he had to say ‘in this state(waqt) would be of benefit to no-one’ (T.A. I.255.19 –20). This clearlyrefers to the ‘state’ of dissociation or trance brought on by hislistening to samAW.Three other examples show the meaning of waqt to be synony-mous with ‘mood’. A disciple of Yesuf b. al-musayn (d.304/916 –7)recited some secular verse to his master, whereupon ‘his mood (waqt)became cheerful’ (T.A. I.319.2). Abemafz al-maddad (d.265/878 – 9)"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE79ventured into the desert with some companions and spoke to them;‘their mood (waqt) became cheerful’ (T.A. I.324.12). Similarly, ‘It isrelated that one day Shiblc’s mood (waqtash) was cheerful, and hewent to the bazaar . . .’ (T.A. II.166.12). These examples all show acommon idiom, not merely ‘momentary experience’, itself a develop-ment from the root idea of waqt as ‘moment’, but a longer lasting,more stable ‘state’ of experience. Perhaps the best English equivalentin these cases is ‘mood’, in the sense of disposition, temperament,or frame of mind.qalbThis word is one of the most difficult in the Sufi vocabulary, both interms of its meaning, and in finding an adequate translation. It is animportant and widely used concept within Sufi psychology.Traditional lexicography has difficulty in attempting to define thecore meaning of the term, since qalb is seen by lexicographers toinvolve ‘changeability’. Thus Ibn Manver cites Qur’an 24.37 wherethe ‘turning about’ or ‘commotion’ (tataqallabu) of hearts is men-tioned. In this verse, the heart’s knowing the promises of the Day ofResurrection is explained as the reason for its disquiet (LisAn, vol.10,pp.685 – 6). Such associations of changeability and commotion arean unlikely derivational basis for the usual description of the heartas the seat of knowledge.Despite the lexicographical complications, however, the hearthas traditionally been viewed as the apprehender of divine know-ledge. Nicholson explains: ‘Whereas the intellect cannot gain realknowledge of God, the qalb is capable of knowing the essences ofall things, and when illuminated by faith and knowledge reflects thewhole content of the divine mind.’25 From Qurxanic usage on, thisknowledge has been more than merely intellectual. It involves theconscience, one’s actions and obedience of the whole life, as L.Gardet’s explanation of the heart suggests: ‘(It is) the organ of con-science and seat of religious knowledge and of life in the presence ofGod’.26While ‘heart’ is the usual English equivalent for qalb, it is in-adequate as a meaning for the ‘organ’ which ‘sees by the light ofunification and love’,27 or apprehends divine knowledge, particularlywhen there is only a tenuous and mysterious connection with thephysical organ.28 One alternative might be ‘soul’, provided thisterm is understood as the apprehender of knowledge. qalb is prob-ably much closer to our ‘mind’ or ‘soul’, as suggested by Lane’s"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE80definition:29‘The mind, secret thoughts and the soul. . . the mind,meaning the intellect or intelligence.’SarrAjIt is perhaps curious to discover that in Sarraj’s writings the notionofqalb as the receiver of divine knowledge is found infrequently.There are some examples, however, such as where Dhexl-Nen isreported to have described samAW as wthe occurrence of Truth whicharouses hearts to the Truth’ (LumaW 271.9). Similarly, Sarraj quotesYasya b. Muwadh (d.258/872) as saying that ‘the word of wisdomthat arises from the heart has an effect upon the heart’ (LumaW295.11).What is more often found is the notion of qalb as being attent-ive to revelation, or the recital of the Qurxan or other means ofsamAW, and as a spiritual and emotional entity often overwhelmedby revelations. It may be described as ‘burning’, or as experiencingemotions such as grief or joy. There is one instance which may wellprovide the key to reconcile these apparently disparate senses ofqalb involving knowledge and emotion. Sarraj writes that ‘Godhas made it known concerning hearts that they observe and under-stand, and that is ecstasy (wajd) for them’ (LumaW 301.6). Thissuggests that the heart does lay claim to knowledge, gained byobservation and understanding, and that this knowledge involvesan emotional and ecstatic element rather than a purely intellectualcontent. This agrees with the widespread Sufi notion that know-ledge of God is much more than a rational exercise, and that itinvolves direct, intuitive and ecstatic apprehension. If this reason-ing holds true, it provides an explanation for the frequent use ofqalb in an emotional and experiential sense. It is the entity which isattentive to, and is sometimes overcome by, divine revelation, orwhich experiences the heightened emotion of wajd.In its attentiveness to revelation or to samAW, Sarraj writes: ‘Reli-able Traditions regarding listening to the Qurxan show that presenceof heart is required, as well as close consideration, contemplationand recollection. They also describe what the listener’s heart en-counters during recitation’ (LumaW 283.2–3). There is also mentionelsewhere of the necessity of superintending the heart during prayer,and of praying with ‘presence of heart’ (Lumaw 293.12–13; 302.9).On occasion qalb is used in a sense similar to the English ‘heart’meaning the seat of sensitivity and feeling. Sarraj writes that ‘onemay perhaps complete many recitations of the Qurxan without"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE81findingriqqa (sensitivity or feeling) in one’s heart from havingrecited’ (LumaW 284.2–3). Similarly, ‘when he (Israfcl, a teacher ofDhexl-Nen) saw me he said: “Would you not do well to recite someverse?” I said: “No”. He said: “You have no heart” ’ (LumaW 288.13).This appears much like the English sense of feeling or kindness.The sense of qalb experiencing heightened emotion or states occursquite frequently in Sarraj. An illustrative example shows it as thereceiver of wajd and SAl: ‘If the listener is not experiencing a specialstate, and there is no disclosure of emotion in the heart, there onlyreaches him what has been heard from the Qurxan...’ (LumaW 283.4).Finally, it must be noted that qalb often occurs in juxtapositionwith the word sirr, these two terms sometimes being indistinguish-able in meaning. For example: ‘One hears (divine) address withattentive ears, an observant heart and a pure soul (sirrin)’ (LumaW302.9); ‘. . . an exhortation or maxim which appealed to him andwhich stirred up strong emotion in his inner soul (sirrihi), or aburning in his heart’ (LumaW 295.13 –14).QushayrCIn the RisAla, Qushayrc also refers to the term qalb as a spiritualorgan sensitive to revelations or the recital of samAW. Qushayrc writesofqalb as the place which samAW affects ‘in a special state (SAl), inthe purity of its arrival’ (Ris. 336).Qushayrc mentions elsewhere the notion of the heart as a ‘living’entity, presumably referring to its spiritual life. He quotes his master,AbewAlc al-Daqqaq, as saying that samAW is a legally recommendedaction (mustaSabb) for ‘our companions’ (i.e. Sufis) because theirhearts are ‘alive’ (Ris. 340).GhazAlCAt one point in the ISyAX, Ghazalc comes close to a definition ofqalb. He writes: ‘I do not mean by the “heart” the flesh and blood,but a subtle secret entity which has a hidden relationship to thevisible organ behind which is the secret entity of the spirit derivingfrom the command of God.’30The emphasis on the non-material and transcendent nature of theheart in this statement is accompanied by a wide range of meaningsin Ghazalc’s use of the term in his writings.Theqalb is sensitive and open to the effects of samAW: ‘There is noaccess to hearts except by the anteroom of auditory stimuli; . . .samAW"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE82is the true touchstone for the heart’ (ISyAX II.266.18 –20; Mcd. p.199;and elsewhere). samAW rouses ‘what is in the heart’ by way of hiddenspiritual treasures and the remembrance of what God has placedthere (ISyAX ibid., and elsewhere).There is often reference made to the heart as either being ‘on fire’or as causing fire: ‘samAW. . . is what strengthens one’s passion andlove, and it inflames the kindling of one’s heart, bringing forth fromit states of revelations . . . ; these states are causes of other actionswhich burn up the heart with their fires and purify them . . .’ (ISyAXII.277.17–20; Mcd. p.229). Similarly poetry ‘acts the part of the firesteel which lights the kindling of one’s heart. Its flames blaze upand longing is aroused . . . causing states not usually encountered’(ISyAX II.285.16 –7; Mcd. p.706). There is reference also to heartsbeing ‘inflamed’ by love of God or by the fire of His love (ISyAXII.266.6; Mcd. p.198). The notion of ‘light’ shining in hearts is alsofound: ‘When they taste wajdand its light is spread in their hearts,all doubt and uncertainty falls away’ (ISyAXII.289.17– 8; Mcd. p.720).The effect of samAW in causing ‘fire’ and ‘light’ in hearts is topurify and to animate them to greater love and nearness to God.samAW follows the paths of the heart toward the spiritual world(ISyAX II.289.32; Mcd. p.721). Furthermore, ‘samAW produces purityof heart which causes revelation. . . and it is strengthened to wit-ness what it was unable to beforehand’ (ISyAX II.290.17– 8; Mcd.p.723). The revelation of new ‘states’ and of witnessing divine realit-ies results from the purifying action of samAw and its cleansing ‘fires’or ‘light’. This is where the heart’s real purpose is found: ‘The taskof the heart is seeking after revelation and beholding the secrets ofthe Kingdom’ (ISyAX II.290.19; Mcd. p.723). This defines the heartas the apprehender of divine knowledge, not intellectual understand-ing, but intimately witnessing and experiencing the secrets of thedivine realm.HujwCrCIn Persian, the word which closely corresponds to Arabic qalb is dil.This term is nearly always used where we would expect qalbif thewriting was in Arabic, and there is a similar range of meanings withthe Persian word.31Hujwcrc uses the term in a particular sense as the seat of emotionand joy. He recounts that a man accompanying Ibrahcm Khawwas(d.291/904) on a journey said: ‘A thrill of emotion came to myheart’ (Kashf 534.15; Nich. p.410). Similarly, in describing the effects"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE83ofsamAW, Hujwcrc writes that ‘a feeling of lightness comes upon theheart’ (Kashf 542.6; Nich. p.416). This relates back to the usage ofqalb in Sarraj as a spiritual or emotional entity, sometimes beingoverwhelmed by revelations or ecstasy.The heart as the centre of ascetic aspirations and spiritual life isseen in Hujwcrc’s use of the term in the context of renunciation andasceticism. He writes of those who are remote from evildoing bymeans of their ‘self mortification and austerities and spiritual renun-ciation of all created things’ (Kashf 537.18; Nich. p.412). ‘Spiritualrenunciation’ here is literally ‘detachment of the heart’ (inqiUAW-i dil).The heart is also used to refer to the centre of spiritual know-ledge, or the ‘mind’, as Nicholson translates: ‘TawAjud is “takingpains to produce wajd”, by representing to one’s mind (dil), forexample, the bounties and evidences of God . . .’ (Kashf 541.9 –10;Nich. p.415).WAUUArThe heart as a place where light shines, noted with Ghazalc’s use ofqalb, is also evident in wAuuar’s use of dil. An eminent Sufi relatedthat he passed by an assembly where Asmad b. marb (d.234/849)was engaged in discourse. While the Sufi remained there, his heartbecame light like the ‘sun of forty years’ (T.A. I.242.4 –7).wAuuaralso relates that Sarc al-Saqauc performed an act of kindness to anorphan child; immediately Sarc saw a light in his own heart, and hiscomplexion changed colour (T.A. I.270.14 –22).Among many other instances of dil in familiar senses, wAuuar usesthe term sukhta-dil, literally ‘burned of heart’ in describing a youthwho is anxious, troubled in mind, or depressed (T.A. II.166.21). Itis argued in the chapters on the psychology of samAW that this descrip-tion of the youth as ‘troubled in heart’ is not a mere rhetoricalflourish. It is an indication of a pre-existing anxiety state which helpsexplain the youth’s sudden collapse and death when he is spoken toby Shiblc.Notes1 William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience, Glasgow: Collins,1960 (1982), p.367.2 Louis Massignon, Essai sur les origines du lexique technique de la mys-tique musulmane, nouvelle éd., Paris: J.

In the following two chapters these descriptionsare brought together and compared to similar phenomena knownto modern psychology.A previous work which covers part of this area is Gilbert Rouget’sMusic and Trance, first published in the 1970s.1 Rouget’s workdeals with the theoretical issues, particularly his distinction between‘ecstasy’ and ‘trance’, and between ‘ritualised’ and ‘non-ritualised’trance resulting from samAW. His work is extremely valuable andgroundbreaking, but its brevity and lack of detail concerning thephenomena recorded in the early sources limit its worth. In theintervening years since publication of this work, much importantresearch has been carried out in this rapidly expanding area ofpsychology. In Islamic studies, however, there has been little sub-stantial progress made in the psychology of samAW. The exceptionto this is Jean During’s Musique et extase, which is admirable forits handling of the rites, the literature, and the theoretical issues ofsamAW.2 Discussion of the psychological aspects of the topic, and ofthe specific behavioural phenomena found in the early source writ-ings, is lacking in During’s work. The present study does not claimto be comprehensive, but it does attempt to deal with these issuesnot adequately covered by previous works.At the outset it is important to acknowledge several limitationson any analysis of the subject in question. The philosophical andmethodological issues which must be confronted are daunting. It is"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)86generally accepted that the available source writings describe experi-ences that go beyond the bounds of ordinary consciousness. AsMoshe Idel argues, however, there are important implications inthis acceptance for the study of these phenomena: ‘At its best, themystic’s testimony is a veil covering a psychic process that as suchmust remain beyond the scope of textual studies’.3 He goes on toclaim that ‘The chance of success in reconstructing the nature of amystical experience from written texts is close to nil.’4 Researchersfrom a psychological background may tend to explain in a reduc-tionist way, given the nature of their science. Even if this is not thecase, the varying and allusive components involved – the humanpsyche, external and internal conditions, and ‘supernatural’ aspectsof the experience – make the process of reconstruction a very hazard-ous undertaking.In the present case, there can be little escape from this scepticalposition argued by Idel. There is very little chance of understandingthe nature of a particular experience from the scant details con-tained in the early Sufi source writings. Most of the descriptions inthese sources are at best second-hand accounts, even if their trans-mission over the intervening millennium is trustworthy. Most pro-vide only the briefest of details, and many are simply descriptionsof external behaviours.It is clear that the modern researcher cannot hope to approachan account of the experiences of these early Sufi mystics. Given theavailable data, one cannot attempt a representation of their psycheor their states of consciousness. What can be reconstructed, how-ever, are patterns of unusual behaviours and physical signs whichallow for identification of the types of altered state behaviours,trance patterns and other dissociative states known more thoroughlyfrom modern psychology. It is not possible to know the precisenature of the altered state involved; the evidence is purely literary,briefly stated, distant by approximately a millennium, and reachesacross a vastly different cultural context. Yet the repetition of detail,and hence the emergence of patterns, as well as the evidence ofsimilar phenomena available in the present day, allows for an appro-ximation which is useful for the purposes of modern psychologyand Islamic studies.Methodologically, there are two important limitations on thetextual evidence available from the source writings. The first has beenmentioned above, namely the brevity of description, and paucityof detail afforded by the sources. This means that the ‘behavioural’or functional approach attempted here is limited by the scarcity of"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)87detail contained in the primary evidence. This is somewhat com-pensated for by the frequent number of incidents of altered statesattested in the sources. The similarity of details recorded also allowsfor some confidence in the patterning of behaviour which can bereconstructed.The second question which arises concerns that of the reliabilityand authenticity of the accounts contained in the source writings.Many of these are clearly ‘traditions’ handed down orally, and onlylater committed to writing. In the later authors, particularly wAuuar,there is some evidence of accretion to the narratives originally re-corded by earlier sources. One example concerns wAuuar’s accountof the death of the famed mystic, Nerc. In Sarraj’sLumaW, Nercsuffered cuts and wounds to his legs from sharp reeds while wan-dering around in a trance-like state after attending a samAW session(LumaW 290.11–17). In wAuuar’s version, there is the pious additionthat the blood which dropped from his leg wounds formed theword Allah on the ground (T.A. II.55.5–12).wAuuar also adds otherincidental details to the account of Nerc’s death, claiming Sarraj ashis authority, yet these details do not occur in Sarraj’s text at all.Clearly this process of pious accretion must be acknowledged,and this leads the modern reader to rely more heavily on the ear-lier texts. Fortunately for our present purposes, the earliest andmost authoritative source, Sarraj’sLumaW, contains the majority ofnarrative accounts dealing with altered state behaviours. Most ofthe later sources repeat these accounts more or less verbatim, butSarraj, who was nearer to the actual events, remains the dominantauthority. As for this author’s reliability, the fact that his work wasan apologetic treatise on Sufi practice means that he would nothave included bizarre or extreme behaviours in his accounts of themystics. Any such outlandishness would have brought the Sufisinto more disrepute, and would have undermined his purpose. Giventhe traditional, conservative training of Sarraj, and his well-known‘sobriety’ of outlook, the narratives which he has preserved would,if anything, err on the side of caution. He is more likely to haveunderstated any accounts of unusual behaviours, and to have ascer-tained the authenticity of his sources beforehand.Finally, there is the question of terminology for the unusual beha-viours and states about which we are speaking. Up to this point inthe study, they have been referred to by a variety of terms, suchas ‘altered states’, ‘dissociation states’, ‘states of consciousness’,‘ecstatic states’, ‘trance-like states’, and so on. The reason for this is"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)88that a general range of behaviours is being alluded to, rather than aspecific condition which could justify a scientifically accurate desig-nation. Moreover, it is clear that not just one condition is beingreferred to, but a number of associated behaviours, and to preferone term over another without evidential justification would bemisleading and would appear to pre-ordain a particular ‘correct’designation. What is more, even if there is certainty about the actualcondition being referred to by the early sources, there is still noconsensus in modern psychology regarding the appropriate termino-logy. It is thus preferable to refer to these states in a general, non-specific way, even if this results in some vagueness and lack ofprecision.Description of the evidenceIn this section, evidence is presented for the physical and beha-vioural effects of samAW upon which a psychological assessment isbased. This evidence consists mostly of reports from eyewitnesses ofunusual behaviours or accounts of altered state episodes recordedin the source writings.In these accounts, there is often mention of more than one physicaleffect or behaviour arising from samAW, and for the purposes of thisstudy these different effects are considered separately.For example, one account recorded by Ghazalc in the ISyAX men-tions an unnamed practitioner of samAW who heard a verse beingrecited; the melody and words excited him and he went into ‘ecstasy’(wajd). He began repeating the verse, substituting the letter nEn forthe letter tAX of the verbal prefixes, thereby changing the referentsof meaning, until he fainted with joy and pleasure (ISyAX II.285.22–26). This account shows evidence of several behavioural effects. Theman became excited; he began repeating the verse in what wouldseem to be an automatic, involuntarily fashion, due to the ecstasy;he eventually fainted; and it is also noted that he was overtaken byjoyous feelings. Each of these effects can be considered as separatebehavioural entities, although they are of course related. Such termsas ‘being overcome by ecstasy (wajd)’ is not considered as a separ-ate entity since this is an overall description of the state. It does notinclude specific information about the behaviour of the person, andin any case ‘being overcome by wajd’, or a similar description, isassumed as a preliminary in all these cases.The following tabular summary presents a brief but comprehen-sive overview of the range of behaviours and effects found in the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)89source writings. Each discrete effect or behaviour is recorded as asingle item, and the groupings range from the most positive andbeneficial, such as ‘healing effects’ and ‘joyful feelings’, through moreneutral effects, to negative, unpleasant and sometimes pathologicaleffects, ending in ‘attempt at suicide’ and ‘sudden death’.Physical–behavioural effects of samAW.A Healing effect:Known to soothe crying infants (LumaW)Treatment of melancholia in ancient times(LumaW)Junayd restores to consciousness personwho fainted (LumaW;Ris;ISyAX)Makkc’s ill follower restored by recitation(T.S.)B Joyful, pleasurableAn unnamed samAW hearer (ISyAX)feelings:Yesuf b.al-musayn at recitation of secularverse (LumaW;Ris; ISyAX;T.A.)C Unspecified arousal:An unnamed samAw hearer (ISyAX)Companion of Abemars during samAW(T.S.)D Rising in ecstasy:Companions of Abe Qasim b.Marwan(LumaW; ISyAX)Dhexl-Nen and his imitator (LumaW;ISyAX;Ris)Musasibc at a recitation (T.S.)wAbdallahmanvala at verse, and can’t sit(Kashf)Nerc in trance leading to death (LumaW;ISyAX)Nerc’s companions at recitation (LumaW)Yesuf b.al-musayn at secular verse (T.A.)E Ecstatic utterances:Nerc’s last trance; repeating verse (LumaW;ISyAX)Shiblc in mosque; repeating verse (LumaW;Ris; ISyAX)Samnen cried out and spoke ecstatically(T.S.)Junayd wept and spoke ecstatically (T.S.)Shiblc when his SAla was strong (T.A.)Sahl Tustarc in a trance (LumaW;T.A.)F Making face to glow:Sarc al-Saqauc; ‘like moon’ (LumaW )Shiblc in mosque; turned ‘red’ (ISyAX)G Loss of colour (in face): Shiblc in mosque (LumaW)(in hair): The Prophet at recitation of Qurxan (ISyAX;Kashf)H Suppression of appetite: Sahl Tustarc fasted 24 –25 days (LumaW;T.A.)"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)90IPerspiring:Sahl Tustarc (LumaW; Ris;T.A.)A disciple of Junayd (LumaW;Ris;ISyAX)JTremor, agitation:Shiblc in mosque (LumaW;Ris) (shoulderblade acc. to ISyAX)Sahl Tustarc‘to point of falling’ (LumaW;Ris)Unspecific references (LumaW;ISyAX;Kashf)Shiblc’s agitation at not being able tocommit suicide (T.A.)A youth just prior to his death, at beingspoken to by Shiblc (T.A.)Caliph who dismissed charges against Shiblcfor murder of youth in above story (T.A.)K Sighing, groaning,Companions of Prophet (LumaW; ISyAX)crying out:Shiblc in mosque (LumaW;Ris; ISyAX)Junayd’s disciple (LumaW; ISyAX; T.A.; Kashf)A beggar hearing verse (LumaW; Ris; ISyAX;Kashf)A man questioning Junayd (LumaW; ISyAX)wUtba al-Ghulam hearing verse (ISyAX)An unnamed Sufi hearing Qurxan verse(ISyAX)Samnen cried out and spoke (T.S.)Abemafz (T.A.)Sound of hissing or boiling in the Prophet’sheart when he prayed (ISyAX)L Weeping:The Prophet at Qurxan recital (ISyAX)Companions of the Prophet (ISyAX)Yesuf b.al-musayn (LumaW;Ris;ISyAX)‘variant’ account in T.A.Companion of Abemafz (T.S.)Junayd on hearing a verse (T.S.)M Loss of sensitivityNerc; cut by sharp canes (LumaW;ISyAX; T.A.)to pain:Junayd and Sarc argue over pain caused bybeing hit by a sword (LumaW)Abemafz touched hot iron from thefurnace (T.A.)N Fainting, loss ofSarc’s disciple restored by Junayd (LumaW;consciousness:Ris;ISyAX)Companions of the Prophet (LumaW;ISyAX)The Prophet at Qurxan verse (ISyAX)Abemulman hearing street crier (LumaW; Ris)Sarc speaking to Junayd (LumaW)An unnamed samAW hearer (ISyAX)Dhexl-Nen fell to ground (LumaW; Ris; ISyAX)wUtba al-Ghulam hearing verse (ISyAX)Ibrahcm Khawwaz (Kashf)O Restless wandering:Nerc in trance leading to death (Lumaw;ISyAX)Nerc with a brick (LumaW;ISyAX; T.A.)Al-Duqqc at night (LumaW) (Al-Raqqc in Ris)Shiblc’s restlessness (T.A.)"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)91P Loss of voluntaryGeneral catalogue of effects (LumaW)control of limbs:Q Throwing oneself (orA disciple of masan of Bazra at Qurxanbeing thrown) toverse (T.A.)the ground:R Attempt at suicide:‘Israelite’ youth on mountain (ISyAX)Shiblc tries by various means (T.A.)S Sudden death:Many who heard the prophet David (LumaW)Companions of the Prophet (LumaW; ISyAX)A disciple of Junayd (LumaW; ISyAX; T.A.)A beggar hearing verse (LumaW; Ris; ISyAX)Disciples of two shaykhs (LumaW)A man drowned in Euphrates (ISyAX)Junayd’s questioner ‘departed’ (LumaW)‘died’ (ISyAX)Audiences of Yasya Muwadh whilepreaching in Khurasan (T.A.)Audience of Junayd while preaching (T.A.)A youth spoken to by Shiblc (T.A.)Others mentioned briefly in Kashf.It was noted above that several of the narrative accounts used asthe basis for this table include more than one behavioural effect.This means that the listing of these effects makes for a longer tablethan might otherwise be justified. These discrete effects also tend tobe homogenised by such a tabular summary as that given above.Some of these behaviours may have been more significant thanothers at the time of their occurrence, but given the nature of theevidence, these shortcomings can hardly be avoided. In any case, itis the overall pattern of behaviours which emerges as the importantoutcome of this evidence, not individual peculiarities.The behaviours and the narrative accounts from which they derivewill shortly be examined in detail, but for the moment it is worthmaking some initial observations based on the above summary.First, it must be noted that there are some behavioural effectswhich occur frequently, and which could be said to be indicative forthe condition(s) caused by samAW. These include D, Rising in ec-stasy, E, Ecstatic utterances, J, Tremor and agitation, K, Groaningor crying out, L, Weeping, N, Fainting or loss of consciousness,and S, Sudden death. Not all of these effects can be consideredtogether, however, since not one of the narrative sources includes acase where all, or even the majority, of these effects coincide at theone time. There is one case where three of these effects coincide, thecase of Shiblc in the mosque, and one example where two effects are"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)92recorded, that of Nerc’s last ecstasy. Yet both of these cases alsocontain other elements which may suggest different conditions op-erating. This leads to an initial observation that more than oneparticular condition or ‘outcome state’ is in operation here. Indeed,this seems to be part of the argument of the source writers them-selves: that there are many facets to the outcome of samAW and thatit is not appropriate to reduce these to a single state.A second general observation to be made from this table is theinfrequency of any specific mention of joyful and pleasurable feel-ings arising from samAW. There are only two instances where suchfeelings are noted, though there are also two specific cases of healingeffects, and some other minor references. There are also two casesof unspecified arousal, which may include joyful feelings, thoughthis is not actually stated.The reason why this is significant is that Sufi writers, ancient andmodern, often refer to the beneficial, therapeutic and pleasurableeffects of the practice of samAW.5 Indeed, the pleasurable and sensualaspect of the practice was part of the reason for its disapproval byconservative scholars and authorities.6 In this catalogue of effects,however, it is clear that there are far more neutral as well as de-cidedly unpleasant and pathological outcomes. These latter couldhardly be characterised as joyful or beneficial unless one ascribes toa more sadistic philosophy which goes beyond the usual instrumentalview of the benefits of suffering.7 Nor is there any mention of samAWas a means of suffering in the early Sufi sources. Such ascetic prac-tices and austerities which engendered physical or mental anguishare regarded as distinct from the practice of samAW. The lack ofemphasis on pleasure in the source texts could be because it is lessobviously manifested relative to the other behaviours mentioned.It may also be a suspect outcome for theological or other culturalreasons.Other observations may be made, but these are best left to a moredetailed examination of the evidence which will be attempted in thenext section.Analysis of the evidence for physical / behavioural effectsA Healing effectUnder this category, the first two pieces of evidence presented bythe earliest source are general statements about the therapeutic effectof music and beautiful sounds. First, Sarraj in his KitAb al-LumaW"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)93writes that music or sweet sounds can soothe and put to sleep acrying infant (LumaW 269.13 –14), this general statement being demon-strated by universal experience. It is next stated that the ancients(al-awAXil) treated melancholia with music and sweet sounds (LumaW269.15 –16). This is a reference to ancient Greek physicians, forby Sarraj’s time there were translations of the Greek writings ofHippocrates and the Pythagoreans readily available to the scholarlycommunity.8It would appear that a variety of ‘music therapy’ was practised inthe Middle East at that time, as demonstrated by an interestingreference in Hujwcrc’sKashf al-MaSjEb. He writes that: ‘In a hos-pital in Turkey they have invented a wonderful thing called ingilyEn[Greek:evangelion] . . . it resembles a stringed musical instrument,and on two days of the week they bring the sick to listen to it for alength of time according to their illness’ (Kashf 531.7–12; Nich.p.407).9The two other examples listed under this category are narrativeaccounts dealing with actual cases of healing by aural means. First,there is an unusual case of a ‘homoeopathic’ cure being procuredby the very means which produced the condition in the first place.Sarraj, Qushayrc and Ghazalc10 relate that Junayd once visited Sarcal-Saqauc and found there a man who had fallen unconscious uponthe recital of a Qurxanic verse. Junayd suggested that the same versebe recited again, whereupon the man recovered. On being ques-tioned about this cure, Junayd related that he considered the caseof the patriarch Jacob’s blindness (Qurxan, Sera 12) which wascaused by a ‘created being’, i.e. Joseph, as was his restoration tosight. By analogy, the man’s sudden illness was caused by a humanvoice, albeit reciting the Qurxan, and not by divine fiat, hence thesame human means could be used to restore the man’s conscious-ness. This is a rather ingenious explanation on the part of Junaydwhich must have appeared necessary in order to counteract thesuspicion of magic or occult powers being used to procure the re-covery. It would seem more appropriate, however, that Junayd hadwitnessed or been party to such ‘homoeopathic’ cures previously,as these are a feature of folk medicine. It is implausible to suggestthat he derived this cure solely from the Qurxanic model, though itcertainly legitimised his action.Junayd’s explanation is not central to the case in question, how-ever, which involves lapsing into and recovering from fainting bymeans of Qurxanic recitation. There is no indication that the semantic"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)94aspect of the recited verse was the cause of the fainting. Semanticconsiderations are frequently involved elsewhere in the Sufi sourceswhere a dissociative reaction occurs upon hearing a particular re-citation.11 This would thus be the most likely cause in the presentcase, yet if so, it was not considered significant enough to include inthe narrative.The other causal factor would be the quality of voice or thepurely rhetorical element of the reciter’s delivery of the verse. It iswell known that the resonant and sonorous qualities of a voice canhave dramatic emotional effects on listeners, quite apart from anymeaning being conveyed. It is partly by such means that the ritualchanting of dhikr has such power spiritually and emotionally inIslamic culture.12It is not surprising that the sonorous quality of voice and/or thesemantic element of the verse could have brought about the faintingseizure. It also appears from the present case that repetition of thesame sequence of sounds brought about the reversal of the con-dition and allowed consciousness to be regained. One should notdiscount the possibility of spontaneous revival, as is mostly the casewith similar types of dissociative seizures.13 The narrative clearlystates, however, that the recovery was concomitant with the secondrecital of the verse, this latter being the crucial factor.There is some evidence from the analysis of similar dissociativestates to support the narrative’s conjunction of these two events.Studies of shamanic journeying show that the practitioner is ableto terminate his altered state at will, and at a particular point in theproceedings, without being dependent on spontaneous revival.14Moreover, studies of the phenomenon of glossolalia or ‘speaking intongues’ indicate that a common method of recovery is the mention ofa short phrase or some catchwords by the leader of the ceremony,much like the hypnotist’s command which ends a hypnotic trance.15Similar in some ways to the present case under discussion, onemeans of inducing the glossolalia state is by rhythmic driving usingaural stimuli, the repetition of words and phrases causing entry intothe state.16 Thus the means of induction and recovery in glossolaliacan be of a similar kind, though the former is usually a lengthierprocess. The notion of loss of consciousness being restored by therepetition of a verse is thus not unreasonable in the light of thesedocumented methods of recovery from similar dissociative states.The final narrative under this category of healing effects occursin Sulamc’sOabaqAt al-ZEfCya. It is related that wAmre b.wUthman"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)95al-Makkc came to Isphahan where he gained a young follower. Theyouth’s father prevented this association, whereupon the followerbecame ill. Makkc and a reciter came to visit him, and at the youth’sinvitation, the reciter delivered a verse about not being visited whenill. The youth stretched and sat up, imploring the reciter to con-tinue. He again recited a verse, this time about rejection being morevexatious than illness. The youth continued to recover until he aroseand departed with them. On being questioned about this event,Makkc explains that he sensed the recovery before the beginning ofthe recitation, which indicated to him that it was ‘from above’, i.e.divinely ordained. Had the recovery been due to the recitation,which Makkc calls samAW, it would have indicated that it was ‘frombelow’ i.e. of infernal origin. Since the signs were that it was ‘fromabove’, just a little samAW was needed to cause healing; if it had been‘from below’, just a little would have caused destruction (T.S. 204.11–205.6).This narrative has some similarity with the preceding case in thatthe recital of verse appears to have had a healing effect; however,this similarity is only a superficial one. The story of Makkc’s healingis more explicable on a transparent psychological level. It wouldappear from the sequence of events that the youth’s illness in thefirst place was precipitated by his father’s refusal to allow him toassociate with his adopted master. A psychosomatic response isindicated, caused by the youth’s grief and yearning to be with hismaster, though this is not specified by the text. The visit of Makkc,a highly respected, perhaps even charismatic figure,17 is the signi-ficant event which by itself could have been sufficient to alter theyouth’s condition for the better. There is evidence from studiesof religious groups associated with charismatic or forceful leadersthat signs of the leader’s favour and submission to his dominanceare sufficient to produce feelings of exhilaration and well-being infollowers.18Makkc explained after the event that he sensed the youth was onthe way to recovery before the application of his recitation therapy(samAW); this could indicate that he sensed a change due to his ownpresence. The next step was to apply samAW-therapy, which seems tohave operated on the semantic as well as the sonorous level. Thetherapeutic benefit of poetry eloquently recited cannot be denied;Makkc made sure he was accompanied by a qawwAl or ‘professionalreciter’. On the semantic level, the poetry spoke directly to the youth’ssituation, mentioning a complainant who is ill but is not visited byhis ‘patron’. This had such a beneficial effect that the youth stretched"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)96out and sat up, asking the reciter to continue. The next verse recitedmay perhaps be translated as:More grievous to me than my illness is your rejection;the rejection of your servant weighs heavily upon me.This verse also seemed to meet the youth’s need, having an immedi-ate therapeutic effect, and allowing him to depart with his master.The best explanation of the recovery is the therapeutic effect ofthe visit of a revered, even charismatic, authority figure, followingrejection or frustration at not being allowed to follow the master.That the illness was psychologically caused by imposed absence fromthe high-status master is shown by the immediacy of the recoveryonce the master showed compassion on his would-be follower. Makkcvirtually admits this in his explanation of the case by indicating thatthe recovery was already beginning before the therapeutic effect ofsamAW took place. The recital of the verses, both by their semanticand euphonic impact, assisted in confirming what was otherwise apsychotherapeutic outcome.B Joyful, pleasurable feelingsIn this second category there are only two examples recorded in thesource writings. As was noted above, this lack of mention of thejoyful aspects of samAW is perplexing, as these aspects were acclaimedby advocates as part of the beneficial value of ‘listening’, and de-nounced by opponents as sensual and abhorrent.Ghazalc in the ISyAX records the example of an unnamed samAWparticipant who heard an arousing verse and was overcome byecstasy. He began to repeat the verse, ‘The messenger said: “Tomor-row you will visit”, and I said: “Do you know what you said?” ’The man substituted the letter nEn for tAX as a verbal prefix, therebyaltering the meaning of the verse to refer to first person pluralinstead of second person singular: ‘Tomorrow we will visit’. Thishad the effect of making the verse’s meaning more personal, refer-ring directly to the listener. The man was thus overcome by thedirect communication he believed he was receiving, and he con-tinued repeating the verse until he fainted with joy and pleasure. Onbeing asked to explain what had occurred, the man replied that hetook the verse in the light of a SadCth which spoke of the inhabitantsof paradise visiting their Lord every Friday.19 This might implythat the man understood the verse as an indication of his imminent"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)97death and reception into paradise and the divine presence (ISyAXII.285.22–26; Mcd. p.707).The sensation of joy and pleasure felt by the man is explicable aspart of his overall dissociative experience. Practitioners of dissociat-ive behaviours often report feelings of peace, joy, inner harmonyand well-being, and if there is a religious dimension to their activity,these feelings are seen as an assurance of divine love and accept-ance.20 Recent neuropsychological research suggests that repetitiveauditory stimuli can drive neuronal rhythms in the brain and pro-duce intensely pleasurable and ineffable experiences. Such repetitivestimuli can bring about simultaneous intense discharge from boththe arousal and quiescent systems, only one of which predominatesin normal brain functioning, with excitation of one usually inhibit-ing the other. With prolonged rhythmic stimuli, however, simultane-ous strong discharge of both parts of the autonomic nervous systemcreates feelings of intense pleasure.21 The report of joy and pleasurein this narrative must also be seen as part of the overall experienceofwajd, which here included compulsive behaviour, the repetitionof the verse, and eventual loss of consciousness. These other behavi-ours will be dealt with under their respective categories.The second case which specifies observable feelings of joy andpleasure is recorded in wAuuar’sTadhkirat and has a more doubtfulstatus as to its reliability. The narrative recorded by wAuuar is avariant on similar accounts given by Sarraj, Qushayrc and Ghazalc.Inthe earlier accounts, which are nearly identical, Yesuf b. al-musaynof Rayy (d.304/916 –7) is visited by Abexl-musayn al-Darraj (d.320/932) after a long journey from Baghdad. Darraj has difficulty locat-ing him, as the people of Rayy all regarded Yesuf as a freethinkeror heretic and would not give directions as to Yesuf ’s whereabouts.He eventually finds him in a mosque, and after inquiries about thejourney, Yesuf asks his visitor to recite some verses of secular poetry.Darraj begins to recite, and after two verses, Yesuf is overcome andbegins to weep bitterly. He explains that the people are right to callhim a heretic because he has been reciting the Qurxan all morningbut felt no emotional effect. A mere two verses of poetry, on theother hand, was sufficient to make him weep bitterly.22InwAuuar’s version, it is Ibrahcm Khawwaz (d.291/904) who visitsYesuf after hearing a heavenly voice tell him to go and say toYesuf that he is one of the rejected. Ibrahcm is reluctant to do this,but eventually goes and finds him in the mosque. Yesuf asks hisvisitor to recite some verse, whereupon he becomes joyful (waqtkhwush shud), and begins to weep tears mingled with blood. He"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)98then proceeds to give the same explanation about reading the Qurxanall morning, and being rightly called a zindCq‘heretic, freethinker’because two verses of poetry have a greater effect on him (T.A.I.318.19–319.8).wAuuar also adds that Ibrahcm was perplexed andwent out into the desert. There he met Khiqr who explained thesituation to him, saying that in fact Yesuf had a very high status inGod’s eyes.There is some doubt about the authenticity of wAuuar’s account,not least because of the respective dates of Yesuf b. al-musayn andIbrahcm Khawwaz. The latter was of an earlier generation thanYesuf, though in wAuuar’s narrative he is portrayed as the discipleof the younger man. This might not be of great significance were itnot that the earlier authorities, Sarraj, Qushayrc and Ghazalc, areunanimous in naming Abexl-musayn al-Darraj as the disciple inquestion. Darraj being a younger contemporary of Yesuf makes fora more plausible scenario, besides having the weight of authority ofthe three earlier sources.This narrative of wAuuar’s records a quite explicable sequence ofjoyful behaviour resulting in bitter weeping, both of these acting as‘release’ mechanisms, the weeping described with a touch of poeticcolour as ‘tears mingled with blood’. There is nothing extraordinaryabout this account which should raise questions about the veracityof the events. It would appear, however, that there is a mistakenidentification concerning Darraj and Ibrahcm Khawwaz. The addi-tional details which do not appear in the earlier accounts of Sarraj,Qushayrc and Ghazalc cannot, on balance, be accepted as authenticand reliable.There is an absence of any other mention of joyful feelings orbehaviours in the sources, apart from these examples. This is a veryslim basis from which to argue that such feelings and behavioursformed an important part of the dissociative reactions resultingfromsamAW. What is significant in this, however, is that this is anunusual situation in the psychological study of dissociative/alteredstate reactions. A.M. Ludwig’s symptomatology of altered statesincludes two categories where positive affect is noted.23 The firstresults from a perceived change in meaning and the attachment ofincreased significance to subjective experience or external cues. Thiscan lead to thrilling feelings of insight and revelations of ‘truth’. Thesecond is a simple affect category which includes feelings of rejuvena-tion, renewed hope, rebirth, and so on. Researchers into glossolalia,shamanic journeying, and various types of Eastern meditation alsoreport resulting positive affect, sometimes to the point of ‘ineffable"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)99bliss’.24 This is one area in which the dissociation resulting fromsamAW differs from these comparable altered states.C Unspecified arousalThis category includes references in the narrative accounts to arousalof an unspecified type, without a particular behaviour or affect beingmentioned. Such unspecific arousal is a noted feature of alteredstates.25 Two examples of this are noteworthy in the Sufi sourcewritings.In what can be seen as a locus classicus on the mystical use ofpoetry in Islam, Ghazalc offers a discussion on the subjective natureof poetry, and the varying understanding which different listenersperceive from the same verse (ISyAX II.285.22– 6; Mcd. p.707). Theauthor illustrates his argument with the account of the unnamedsamAW practitioner who was mentioned in the previous section B.The man heard a verse whose melody and words excited him(istafazzahu). A typical dissociative reaction ensued and the manbegan repeating the verse, substituting letters of the verbal prefixesto give a first person reference. Finally, the man was overcome byjoy, and fainted.Though the arousal is not specified, it is stated to have been theeffect of the music (or melody) and the words, i.e. resulting fromboth the sonic and the semantic impact of the verse recital. Thearousal produced or accompanied the dissociative reaction whichincluded the compulsive repetition of the verse, and eventual faint-ing with joy.Such arousal is a noted outcome of listening to music. Physiolog-ical arousal, as measured by such laboratory tests as galvanic skinresponse, respiration and pulse rates, or muscular activity has beenshown to be produced by listening to music, though a simple stimulus–response situation does not seem to occur.26 There are obviouscultural elements which come into play, such as one’s exposure to,or previous learning of music. Certain types of ‘stimulative’ musicseem to have a greater effect, and this is borne out by field studieswhere it is clear that rhythmic music can have a significant impacton listeners.27 Neurologically, rapid external rhythms are likely todrive the autonomic arousal system to such intensity that the quies-cent system is activated. Breakthrough of the quiescent system maylead to a change in activation of the hippocampus which is corre-lated with trance or dreamlike states.28 With Sufi recitals, the responseof arousal to the performance of the qawwAlor professional reciter"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)100has been described by Qureshi as a ‘range of spontaneous expres-sions. . . directly reflecting the devotee’s state of mystical arousal’.29In this context of formal and ritual performance, as studied byQureshi, these expressions of arousal take various forms, such asrhythmic swaying, arm and head movements, exclamations, weeping,and so on. It is likely that the arousal mentioned in Ghazalc’s narrat-ive was of some observable type such as those witnessed in present-day performances.These considerations are aptly illustrated by the second exampleof unspecified arousal which comes from Sulamc’sOabaqAt. It isrelated that a companion of Abemafz al-Naysaberc made a habitof going around samAW performances. As he listened he would bearoused or agitated (hAja), and would weep, and tear his clothes. Thecontext implies that this is unacceptable behaviour, and Abemafzis asked to do something about this man’s conduct (T.S. 119.3 –5).D Rising in ecstasyThis category refers to a particular dissociative behaviour whichoccurs as a result of samAW. The action of rising or standing up fromone’s reclining or seated position is a characteristic element ofecstasy associated with ritual listening sessions. In fact its character-istic nature is illustrated by an account in Qushayrc’sRisAla thatShiblc once went into ecstasy while seated. That this was unusual isindicated by his being questioned as to what the matter was, andwhy he remained seated (Ris. 349). The behaviour is always indic-ated in Arabic by use of the simple first form of the verbal root qEm(‘stand, rise’). This verb takes a special idiomatic meaning of ‘to riseto one’s feet under the influence of ecstasy’.30In the psychological literature relating to altered states, there arevery few references to this behaviour of ‘rising’ indicated in otherforms of dissociation. In the literature on glossolalia, among thevarious forms of kinetic or motor behaviours associated with thispractice, the activity of jumping, while kneeling, from kneeling tostanding, and while standing, are the nearest which are documented.31Several types of dissociation, including non-epileptic seizures andglossolalia, record behaviours of slumping downwards, or falling tothe ground, which suggest a loss of conscious or voluntary musclecontrol.32 The activity of ‘rising’ appears more indicative of a trance-like state, with directed behaviour resulting from a substitution ofautomatic for voluntary control.33"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)101Qureshi’s description of this ‘rising’ behaviour in contemporarysamAW performance shows that this action precedes ecstatic dancingor other directed movements: ‘Occasionally the emotion [generatedby music] is not to be overcome and culminates in complete ecstaticabandonment – the third stage of arousal. This condition is norm-ally indicated by the devotee’s rising to his feet in order to be ableto move more freely. Once he moves on his feet, he is considered tobe in the state of ecstatic dancing (raq{).’34 Such is the ritual expres-sion of this dissociative state. Qureshi describes elsewhere a furtherritual elaboration on this ‘rising’: ‘In recognition of the divine giftof this ecstatic state, the leader of the assembly rises and with himall other listeners, until the state subsides’.35The accounts recorded in the Sufi source writings present a varietyof situations, formal and otherwise, where this behaviour occurred.There is no mention in these sources of any imperative developmentfrom ‘rising’ to movement and dance, except in one account wherea trance-like state ensued which compelled the subject to wander dis-tractedly all night. These early accounts may have failed to mentionthe ritual elaborations following the ‘rising’ behaviour for variousreasons, but it is more likely that these features are a later addition.This is so since the source accounts are historically at an early stageof ritual development, and show signs of formative processes atwork.There are many recorded examples of this ‘rising’ behaviour, whichindicates that it is characteristic of the dissociation resulting fromsamAW. The first example is narrated by both Sarraj and Ghazalc,with the later author slightly abbreviating the account. Abe Qasimb. Marwan (mid to late third/ninth century) was noted as one whodid not attend samAW for many years. Once, at the invitation ofcompanions, he attended and heard a verse recited which made allexcept him ‘rise’ in ecstasy. He asked his fellows about the meaningof the verse, but was not satisfied with the answers any of themgave. He then offered his own explanation of the verse.36It is not stated whether Abe Qasim’s explanation was consideredsuperior to the others, but this can be assumed by the way in whichit is recorded in the two accounts, and by Ghazalc’s additionalcomments on its meaning. There is a further implication in thisnarrative that Abe Qasim’s habit of not participating in samAW iscommendable and beneficial. His failure to ‘rise’ in ecstasy showshis independence, against the others with their collective behaviour.Unless this is simply an example of group conformism, this mass"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)102behaviour appears to be a ritual elaboration much like that wit-nessed by Qureshi.37 Abe Qasim’s independent stance and objectiv-ity also shows itself in his ability to ‘understand’ the intrinsic meaningof the verse which had such an overwhelming effect on his fellowlisteners. Despite this effect on them, their ‘explanations’ about theverse and its significance were evidently inferior to his.The second example of this behaviour also illustrates the hier-archies in these early Sufi communities and their tendency to con-formism and imitative behaviour. Sarraj, Qushayrc and Ghazalcreport an account concerning the highly respected and influentialDhexl-Nen al-Mizrc (d.245/860). On arriving in Baghdad he attendedasamAW session, and on hearing some particular verses ‘he rose upand then fell down on his face’. Immediately another man rose upalso, but Dhexl-Nen quoted to him a verse from the Qurxan: ‘Hewho sees you when you arise’, whereupon the man sat down again.38Sarraj and Ghazalc both offer a similar explanation of this episode,that the other man was attempting to imitate or perhaps rival themaster by his pretence to ‘rise’ in ecstasy. The quotation from theQurxan informs the man that it is none other than God who isthe adversary in his claim to ecstasy, the authors’ use of legal termi-nology emphasising the seriousness of the case. Both authors alsopoint out that if the man had been genuine, he would not have satdown again immediately he had been rebuked. This acknowledgesthe involuntary nature of the dissociative state which provides ameans of distinguishing genuine from feigned, and, in this case,imitative behaviour.The third example in this category is also recorded by Sarraj andGhazalc: Abexl-musayn al-Nerc’s last trance which led to his death.Again it appears that Ghazalc has followed Sarraj’s account closely.Nerc was at a samAW session when, on hearing a particular verse, hearose and went into ecstasy (wa-tawAjada). He began to wanderaround, trance-like, coming upon a thicket of newly shorn reedswhich cut his feet and legs, making them bleed. Oblivious to thepain, he continued in this fashion all night, repeating the verse overand over. His legs swelled and suppurated, leading to his deathsome days later.39Nerc’s ‘rising’ behaviour cannot really be considered as an isolatedevent in this account of a classic dissociative reaction. It is part ofa larger set of trance-like actions of which his ‘rising up’ may besimply a narrative device of continuity with the subsequent account.If the use of this term actually indicates part of the dissociative pro-cess, it points to the initial behavioural reaction which was followed"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)103by the automatisms of trance-like wandering, compulsive verbalisa-tion, and loss of sensitivity to pain.In the fourth example considered here, Nerc is also a chief player.In a chapter concerning the difference between genuine and imitat-ive, or affected, ecstasy, Sarraj recounts a narrative in which Nercwas present at a disputation on an academic question. Nerc beganto recite several verses of love poetry, whereupon the whole assembly‘arose’ and went into affected ecstasy (wa-tawAjada) (LumaW 304.18 –305.7).This narrative has some similarity with the first example men-tioned above, namely the mass display of dissociation which canpartly be explained by the ritual setting and by group conformistbehaviour. What is remarkable in the present case is that the sub-jects were not impressionable samAW participants who would readilygo into ecstasies, but sober, learned scholars gathered for the pur-pose of academic disputation. The only mitigating circumstancehere is the use of the term ‘affected ecstasy’ (or pretended, attemptedecstasy), which suggests that imitative and conformist behaviourwas indeed operating. That these scholars who were engaged intheoretical arguments abruptly responded in such an ecstatic waysuggests a ritualised reaction, at least partly resulting from the strictsocialisation inherent in religious life.A similar mass response, which is a feature of the ‘rising’ phe-nomenon, occurs in an account related in Sulamc’sOabaqAt. Thefamed and respected Sufi,marith al-Musasibc, was present at anassembly where some love poetry was recited; ‘He arose in nearecstasy, and wept, so that all those present were moved for him’(T.S. 60.7–12).The difference in this episode is that the mass reaction was one ofsympathy and emotional involvement, rather than actual dissocia-tion, whether genuine or feigned. The high status of Musasibc partlyaccounts for his being shown obeisance and respectful treatment bythe others present. It is likely, however, that the sincerity of hisactions, including his weeping, was truly felt by those present, andas such provided a genuine stimulus to their sympathetic response.Hujwcrc relates a number of short narratives dealing with thepsychological effects of samAW, one of which is important for thepresent category. On hearing the recital of a Qur’an verse mention-ing the torments of hell, wAbdallah b. manvala (d.?) began weepingto excess, and rose to his feet. He was told by his companions to sitdown, but he replied: ‘Fear of this verse prevents me from sittingdown!’ (Kashf 512.9–12; Nich. p.394)."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)104There is some evidence here for a dissociative reaction, includingexcessive weeping. His ‘rising up’ appears to be an automatic beha-viour, though he is conscious enough to be able to converse, and torealise that he has no voluntary control over his standing or sitting.Such a reaction is not as severe as the type experienced by Nerc(above); with Ibn manvala there is only partial dissociation.The final example in this category has largely been dealt withalready, in the narrative of Yesuf b. al-musayn mentioned in cat-egory B above. It is only in the account presented by ‘Auuar thatYesuf ‘rises up’ at the recital of the secular poetry, though all threeversions mention his weeping to excess.40 Given the problems inher-ent in wAuuar’s account, this small detail may not be noteworthy,and could be a simple narrative device of conjunction. If it is ofimportance, however, it is a further example of the concurrenceof secular poetry recitation and the ‘rising’ behaviour. All but oneof these cases were caused by the recitation of secular or love poetry,and the Qurxan verse which brought about the other case was char-acterised by its emotive content.In conclusion, there emerge several important features of thisclassic reaction to samAW. The involuntary nature of the behaviourand its automatism, which appears in all the examples recorded,means that it can be considered as a genuine dissociation or alteredstate.There are also important social dimensions coinciding with this‘rising’ behaviour. It is nearly always associated with large assemblies,such as samAW concerts. In only one instance was the behaviourwitnessed in a private setting, where there were two persons present.The corollary to this observation is that ‘rising’ is often a groupbehaviour. There may be several reasons for this, and in the examplesmentioned above ritual behaviour may account for some of theoccurrences. Another factor is the issue of conformist and imitativetendencies arising from the hierarchical structure and socialisationpractices of Sufi groupings. There is also the probability of a genuinesympathetic reaction displayed by a whole group toward a respectedelder, as in the case of Musasibc.A further observation here is that the particular behaviour isnearly always provoked by the recitation of sensual or emotiveverse. All but one of the cases above involved a reaction to secular,particularly love, poetry. The other example involved a reaction toan emotive, if not fear-inspiring, verse from the Qurxan. It is clearthat the emotionally charged content of the verses or poetry had animportant role in provoking dissociative reactions."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)105E Ecstatic utterancesThis category deals with speech and other utterances evoked asdissociative reactions to samaW. Strictly speaking, these phenomenashould not really be termed ‘ecstatic utterances’, nor described asshaUSiyAt in the technical sense of inspired mystical expressions.Carl Ernst makes clear in his study of shaUSiyAt that such inspiredexpressions have an important doctrinal and theological role toplay, as well as having legal implications in questions of heresy andinfidelity.41 This view is also the position of the early Sufi writersonshaUSiyAt, notably Sarraj and the Persian author and mysticRezbihan Baqlc Shcrazc (d.606/1209).42The phenomenon arising from samAW, however, appears notablydifferent from the classic forms of ecstatic sayings uttered by mysticssuch as Abe Yazcd al-Bisuamc and mallaj. In the early sources deal-ing with samAW, the ‘utterances’ linked to dissociative reactions aremuch more mundane and circumscribed. There are no profound,theologically challenging and audacious sayings or expressions ofunitary experience. There is no question of an esoteric doctrinebeing formulated, of secret teachings for the initiated, with the needfor detailed commentary and refutation of charges of blasphemy.Such were required for the classic ‘ecstatic’ sayings of Sufism. Forexample, Junayd wrote a commentary on the audacious sayingsof Abe Yazcd al-Bisuamc, parts of which are preserved in Sarraj’sLumaW (380.10ff ). Rezbihan Baqlc wrote an extensive comment-ary on the sayings of various early Sufis in his SharS-i ShaUSiyAt(Explanation of Ecstatic Sayings). Junayd also reprimanded hismore outspoken contemporaries for divulging the ‘secrets’ of Sufiteachings.43Some of the utterances resulting from samAW do indeed comeclose to being ‘ecstatic’ in the sense of emotionally expressed, sincereoutpourings of the mystic’s spirit. These are the exception, how-ever, for mostly they are closer to automatisms of dissociation, orto glossolalia utterances. It is worth considering that although theexternal forms are rather different, the source of both ecstatic utter-ances and those evoked by samAW may well be similar.Ernst did not include a discussion of psychological aetiology inhis work on ecstatic utterances. This is a lack which can only parti-ally be filled by the present study, since here we are dealing onlywith the specific question of samAW and its effects. There may besome overlap, however, as the more general area of shaUSiyAt isplaced in focus by examining the emotive responses to samAW."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)106It would seem that for an early Sufi author such as Sarraj, thesource of ‘ecstatic utterances’ is the same as for the dissociativephenomena resulting from samAW. Sarraj could as well be describingthe source of the latter in his definition of shaUS as ‘an ecstasy thatoverflows because of its power, and that creates commotion by thestrength of its ebullience and overpowering quality.’44 These notionsof ‘overflowing’ and ‘commotion’ are underscored by the author’setymological treatment of the word shaUS. He claims that the ideasof water overflowing and of agitation and movement are containedin the verbal root of the word. Such ideas well describe the dissoci-ative phenomena of ecstatic utterances where there is a sense of theoverflowing of a powerful experience often not wholly under volunt-ary control.The source writings describe two basic categories of ecstaticutterances. The first category is that of an apparent automatism,the compulsive repetition of a phrase or verse carried out in a seem-ingly involuntary fashion. There are several references in the sourcesto such behaviours which are clearly dissociative reactions.In the discussion above concerning the ‘rising’ behaviour, thenarrative about Nerc’s last trance was related. Part of his dissociat-ive reaction was the continuous repetition of the verse which hadevoked his trance. This is a model case for the psychological studyofsamAW as many of the typical reactions are exemplified in Nerc’sepisode. The involuntary nature of the repetition as an apparentautomatism is clear, with the narrators (both Sarraj and Ghazalc)stating that this behaviour continued all night.A similar classic episode concerning Shiblc is recounted by Sarraj,Qushayrc and Ghazalc.45 Shiblc was praying in a mosque during themonth of Ramadan. A verse recited by his Imam caused him to cryout, change colour (turn green according to Sarraj, red according toGhazalc), and begin to tremble. He then began repeating continu-ally the phrase: ‘With such words do lovers converse!’ Again theautomatism of this verbal behaviour is evident in association withthe other physical signs. It is of interest to note that this episodeoccurred during the fasting month of Ramadan when it was notunusual for extra austerities to be carried out by Sufis.46 It is acknow-ledged that physical deprivations, involving food, sleep, light, andso on, can have a conditioning effect on the activation of dissociativestates.47A similar case has also been referred to above in category Cdealing with unspecified arousal. An unnamed practitioner of samAWwas excited by a particular melody and verse. He went into ecstasies"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)107and began repeating the verse, substituting letters in certain wordsto give first person references, until he fainted with pleasure. Theremay be less evidence here of an automatism; it could be that theman consciously altered the letters of the verse, being in voluntarycontrol of his speech. However, there is a likely dissociative reac-tion alluded to by his other behaviours. This would suggest that thesubstitution of letters was an involuntary action occasioned by thesubject’s self-absorption in his altered state.The second main category of ecstatic utterance found in the sourcenarratives concerns short, emotional speeches which are reactionstosamAW. As mentioned above, these may appear similar to theclassicshaUSiyAt statements of Islamic mystics, but on closer scru-tiny there are some differences. Unlike shaUSiyAt utterances there isno doctrinal or theological import, and they are more spontaneousand transitory outbursts. There appears more of an emotive qualityto these utterances, responding to the needs and temperament ofthe moment. There is a lack of ‘studied’ expression, of mature reflec-tion and memorability noticeable in the classic shaUSiyAt of AbeYazcd or mallaj. However, it is difficult not to consider that boththese types of utterances spring from the same source. Their charac-teristics are similar in many ways, apart from their mystical importor their theological significance. Both types of utterance are highlycharged in emotion, and both erupt as outpourings of sensitivespirits.Sulamc records two similar instances of ecstatic speeches, the firstrelated of Samnen b. wAbd Allah. Samnen was called ‘the lover’because of his discourses and poems on the theme of mystical love;48hence it is not surprising that his ecstatic utterances were recorded.It is noted in Sulamc’s account that he ‘cried aloud’, indicating anemotional or dissociative reaction, and then was heard to say: ‘Wouldthat mankind cried out due to the force of His ecstasy in His love,to fill what is between the horizons with cries!’ (T.S. 195.6 – 8.)The second example recorded by Sulamc concerns Junayd whowas walking in Baghdad with Abexl-wAbbas b. Masreq. On hearinga singer recite a verse about past glories, Junayd began weepingbitterly, and then spoke ecstatically to his companion: wAbexl-wAbbas! How good are the stages of concord and familiarity, andhow lonely are the states of antipathy! I never cease to yearn forthe origin of my desire, with a keen path, and terrors as my steed,desirous to attain my goal! But look at me now during times ofindolence: I yearn for past times!’ (T.S. 240.8 –13). This utterance is"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)108a very personal and emotional outpouring, prompted not only bythe singer’s verse, but by Junayd’s temperament and inner con-cerns of the moment. This ecstatic speech is reminiscent of Junayd’sintense, lyrical sajW (rhymed prose) style in his KitAb al-FanAX (Bookof Annihilation).49A final example in this category comes from wAuuar’s accountof Shiblc. It is related that when Shiblc’s ‘state’ (SAla) was strong,he would go to the ‘assembly’ (probably the mosque) and divulgemysteries (sirr) to the common people. Junayd upbraided him fordoing so, accusing him of divulging in the streets what the Sufisheard in grottos or cellars. Shiblc replied ecstatically: ‘I speak whatI hear; in both worlds, what is there apart from me? Nay, for self isa word which goes from God to God, and Shiblc is not in themidst!’ Junayd then accepted what he had to say (T.A. II.166.14 –19). This last statement of Shiblc’s appears very like a classic shaUSutterance, with its profound, audacious and teasing quality, charac-teristic of this roguish, unconventional mystic. It is important tonote in this account, however, that Shiblc was under the influence ofan altered state (literally ‘his state was strong’) when he ventured tospeak such mysteries. Moreover, Shiblc claims to have spoken ‘whatI hear’; his ‘hearing’ made him speak aloud, and he was merely aconduit between the Source of his words and the world at large.One example of ecstatic utterance falls into neither of the twocategories described above. Both Sarraj and wAuuar present similaraccounts of the trance-like state witnessed of Sahl b.wAbdallahTustarc. As a result of samAW, Sahl would go into a trance lastingsome twenty-four or twenty-five days; he would not eat, and hewould sweat profusely even during the winter. If he was questionedin this state, he would reply: ‘Do not ask anything of me, for mywords would be of no benefit to you at this time’ (LumaW 307.4 – 8;T.A. I.255.16 –20). It would seem that Sahl’s utterances during thistrance-like condition were caused by his altered state, but there isno further indication as to their characteristics. It may be that theywere inarticulate ravings, or even fully articulate but likely to bemisunderstood as blasphemous or heretical. This was often the casewith the ecstatic utterances of mystics, that in a different contextthey would be misconstrued as heretical.50 It is possible that Sahlwas fearful of such an outcome in this situation.Qureshi has noted the occurrence of verbal manifestations of dis-sociation in contemporary samAW settings among Sufi groups. Often"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)109these take the form of exclamations or shouts, or short verbal ex-pressions, and these depend on the stage of arousal achieved.51 Theautomatism of repeating verses noted in the early Sufi sources is afurther form of such manifestations. It could be argued that thelonger, more ‘studied’ and conscious utterances known as shaUSiyAtare the other end of a continuum which begins with simple shoutsand exclamations. The evidence could also point to a basic dis-tinction, however, between automatisms on the one hand, and con-scious, voluntary utterances on the other. The source writings showthe non-creative, involuntary nature of the former type of utter-ance which is clearly an outcome of dissociation.52 The writings alsodemonstrate the phenomenon of fully conscious, articulate andcrafted expressions which are in strong contrast to these automat-isms. Yet these may also result from a dissociative state, albeit of amilder, perhaps qualitatively different form. These ecstatic utterancesare driven by a highly charged but creative mind, the emotionalstate of the speaker flowing over with articulate expression.If this distinction between the phenomena of automatism andconscious utterance holds, the aetiologies of these two behavioursmay also be separate. In the case of the former, the definitionoffered by Felicitas Goodman for glossolalia utterances is equallyvalid here. Goodman argues that glossolalia should be seen as ‘avocalization pattern, a speech automatism, that is produced onthe substratum of hyperarousal dissociation, reflecting directly . . .neurophysiologic processes present in this mental state’.53 If cort-ical control is switched off, a connection between the speech centreand some subcortical structure may be established, with the latterin control. Vocalisation then becomes an audible manifestation ofrhythmic discharges of the subcortical structure.54 This could accountfor inarticulate utterances which have no semantic content, and, byextension, the compulsive repetition of phrases as noted in the sourcewritings.With conscious, articulate utterances at the other end of the spec-trum, different causal factors may be operating. The explanationmay possibly be found in higher arousal levels and the stimulusthese provide for more urgent and emotive vocalisation. The evid-ence from the Sufi source writings is abundant that a type of ‘hyper-arousal’ dissociation is operating in these behavioural outcomes.There are obvious somatic agitations and arousals which are theopposite of those witnessed in the somatic calming or ‘hypoarousal’of classic meditation disciplines.55 These higher arousal levels canbe associated with heightened vocalisation behaviours, in terms of"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)110excitational level, and with urgency, speed and volubility of speech.This is readily demonstrated in everyday life when a person isobserved in an elated or excited mood. It is also demonstrated incertain types of psychopathologies, such as in the manic phase ofbi-polar mood disorder (manic-depressive illness).The positing of heightened arousal levels as part of the dissociativereaction to samAW may explain this second type of ecstatic utterancewhere conscious control and creativity are amply demonstrated.F Making face to glow, and G Loss of colourThese two categories should be considered together, since they areboth concerned with changes in facial aspect. When viewed closely,the evidence for this apparent physiological effect of samAW is rathersparse. Only one undisputed instance of a person’s face glowingis recorded in the narratives, and a further instance has conflictingtestimony (one source mentions glowing, another mentions pallor).This is not a sufficient base of evidence to support the view that theeffect is an important physiological reaction, and thus it can onlybe considered a marginal characteristic.In the first example, Sarraj records that Sarc al-Saqauc and Junaydwere discussing the theme of love. Sarc grabbed the skin of his ownforearm and let it go again, saying: ‘If I had said that this (hand)has withered the other (forearm) from love, it would have been so!’Sarc lost consciousness and his face began to glow red (tawarrada)until it became ‘like the halo of the moon, and we were not able tolook upon it because of its beauty, so that his face covered us (withlight)’ (LumaW 307.10 –14). This is a rather enigmatic story, and isonly connected with samAW because of the effects of Sarc’s near-ecstatic, cryptic statement. Nevertheless, the change of aspect isrecorded as a principal feature of the dissociation, along with theloss of consciousness. Some allowance for hyperbole must also bemade in the description of the face, though similar accounts of facesglowing with light are given in other sources.56The second instance comes from the narrative of Shiblc in themosque, where, on hearing a Qurxanic verse, he cries out and beginsto tremble.57 Sarraj’s account has him ‘turn green’ (ikhQarra), i.e. heloses colour in the face or turns pallid. Ghazalc’s account, on theother hand, has Shiblc‘turn red’ (iSmarra). The difference betweenthese two accounts may be due purely to faulty textual transmis-sion. The two verbs in question are distinguished only by the middleroot letter, and a change from mCm to QAd or vice versa is easily"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)111made. There is also a minor orthographic difference of two diacrit-ical points. Given the lack of any other examples of a person’s face‘turning pallid’, it may well be that Ghazalc’s text is the more original,and that Sarraj’s text has suffered in transmission.The only other example of a related phenomenon is the Traditionthat the Prophet’s hair turned white at the recitation of some Serasfrom the Qurxan.58The observation of these overt physical signs of reaction are com-mon in cases of altered state behaviours. Both pallor and flushingare noted among several other indicators of underlying physiologicalchanges, and are often associated with fear or anxiety symptoms, asmay be expected from fear-inspiring verses of the Qurxan.59H Suppression of appetiteThere is one instance recorded in the source writings of an evidentdissociative state causing loss of appetite in the subject. Sahl Tustarcexperienced apparent trance-like states, as recorded in two sourcesmentioned above (LumaW 307.4 – 8;T.A. I.255.16 –20). The mainsymptoms of this state were Sahl’s loss of appetite for over threeweeks at a time, and excessive perspiration, even in winter. Duringthis time, he would either become inarticulate, or what he had tosay ‘would be of no benefit’ to listeners.It is difficult to classify this dissociative state into a more specificcategory than to say that it has trance-like features. The sourcesindicate that this was not a once-only event; it happened on variousoccasions, though no specific frequency is given.There is general agreement that fasting prior to the onset of analtered state facilitates its induction, and is a widespread practice.60The reason for this is probably that the lowering of blood sugarlevels is an aid to the altering of consciousness. Normal brain func-tion requires a constant supply of enriched blood; a fast of overthree weeks could produce serious effects, and would almost cer-tainly result in altered consciousness. In Sahl’s case, there is nomention that he fasted before the onset of the state. It appears thathis fasting was either the result of the state, or else a voluntaryaction on his part to enhance the altered state.I PerspiringThe case of Sahl Tustarc mentioned in the last category includes thephenomenon of excessive perspiration as one of the symptoms of"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)112his reaction. The sources state that his perspiration was so greatthat his clothes would become drenched, and this occurred even inthe season of winter. This last statement serves to underscore thatthe perspiration was due to internal somatic factors rather thanenvironmental conditions such as hot or humid weather.Another curious instance of this phenomenon is contained in anarrative reported by Sarraj, Qushayrc and Ghazalc. A disciple ofJunayd would go into dissociation on hearing any recollection (dhikr)of God. The disciple would cry out so much that Junayd orderedhim to be quiet on pain of dismissal. The man tried so hard tocontrol himself from crying out that ‘every hair of his body wouldexude a drop of water’. Eventually this effort became too much forhim, and one day he lost control, cried out and ‘burst his soul’,meaning euphemistically that he died.61An interesting elaboration of this narrative is contained in wAuuar’sTadhkiratwhere no mention is made of the man perspiring underthe effort of self-control. Yet wAuuar adds the curious detail thatwhen he died, all that was left under his cloak was a heap of ashes.This allusion to the dubious phenomenon of spontaneous humancombustion possibly accounts for the omission of any mention ofperspiring!62Both of these examples point to an underlying anxiety conditionor internal crisis in each subject. In Sahl’s case, this condition in-volved a trance-like state which lasted over three weeks. His exces-sive perspiration was one of the symptoms of such a crisis situation,other aspects of which were discussed in the previous section. Forthe disciple of Junayd, his perspiring was the main symptom of anattempt at ‘self-control’. He endeavoured to prevent the outwarddisplay of an automatism, or what was a dissociative phenomenon,involuntary crying out or shouting. As with a sufferer of Tourette’ssyndrome, this attempt proved very difficult, and in this case wasultimately unsuccessful. The underlying anxiety of the attempt, par-ticularly since it was instigated by a revered Sufi master, wouldseem to be the cause of the excessive perspiration.J Tremor, agitationThis category is one of major importance in the psychology ofsamAW. The phenomena of tremor and agitation are characteristic ofthe dissociation being studied, as evidenced by numerous referencesin the source writings. Initial investigation again points to anxiety-like states as being contributory."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)113The episode of Shiblc in the mosque has been mentioned above.In this classic case of dissociation, Shiblc’s face changed colour, andhe began to tremble, according to Sarraj, though in Ghazalc’s accounthis shoulder muscles quivered. He then began repeating automat-ically the verse which had caused this reaction.Sarraj and Qushayrc relate that Sahl Tustarc’s servant of sixtyyears reported witnessing his master tremble to the point of fallingdown. This occurred only once in all that time, as mostly he wasunaffected by samAW. Another witness reported a similar instanceconcerning Sahl on another occasion, suggesting that this was notsuch an uncommon occurrence (LumaW 292.11–293.2:Ris. 347).It is noteworthy also that the two Qurxanic verses which inducedthe reaction were verses of threatened punishment on the day ofjudgement.63The Qurxan is also mentioned by Sarraj and other writers ascontributing to various cases of trembling and agitation. In particu-lar, a verse which speaks of ‘the skins of those who fear their Lordtremble; then their skins and their hearts soften at the remembranceof God . . .’ (Qur.38.23) is mentioned by Sarraj as causing a similarreaction (LumaW 302.12–3).Apart from some other brief references to this phenomenon inseveral of the source writings, two more substantial cases revolvearound the controversial figure of Shiblc.First,wAuuar’sTadhkirat contains a disturbing account of a periodof insanity in Shiblc’s life which ended in his being committed toan asylum. The main features of this insanity include his restlesswandering, caused by the hearing of a voice, his increasing agita-tion, and his desire and attempts to commit suicide. The cause ofthis episode was Shiblc’s hearing a sudden ‘voice’ or ‘prompting’which said: ‘How long will you go about seeking the “Name”; ifyou are a true seeker, set about finding the Namer!’ This had suchan effect on him, continues the text, that he lost his composure,‘love’s power took hold’, and he became distracted and overwhelmed.He tried various means of suicide, throwing himself into the Tigris,self-immolation, seeking out hungry lions, and throwing himself offa mountain. Each of these proved unsuccessful, and his agitation(bC-qarArC) increased a ‘thousand fold’, ending in his being shackledand confined in an asylum (T.A. II.162.18 –163.3).This is a description of a complex case, which in modern termswould be considered a psychotic episode. The main symptom out-lined in the source, apart from the suicidal behaviour, is his beingoverwhelmed by an unspecified anxiety and agitation. The terms"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)114used to describe this condition are quite general and non-specific inwAuuar’s text, and even the term bC-qarArC has a wide range, including‘instability, restlessness, disturbance’ and so on. The general pictureis clear, however, that Shiblc suffered a derangement in which hisprevious composure gave way to severe disturbance and agitationof mind and body. The complete and generalised way in which suchpsychosis overtakes its subject leaves little room for isolating par-ticular, noteworthy symptoms. This may account for the transmitterof the narrative conveying a generalised picture by his use of non-specific description.The cause of the episode is given as Shiblc hearing a ‘voice’ whichurged him to seek ‘the Namer’.64 There is no mention of the sourceof this voice, though in wAuuar’s work there is a frequent occurrenceof similar auditions specified as having a divine origin. The onlyreason to suspect that the present case was meant to be seen anydifferently is the decidedly negative outcome of this audition. WhilewAuuar leaves some ambiguity in the question of the voice’s origin,in modern medical terms there would be no doubt about the psy-chotic quality of the voice, particularly in view of the suicidal beha-viour which ensued.Whatever the origins of the voice, the text clearly describes theoverwhelming agitation as both a manifest symptom and part ofthe disease which caused Shiblc’s restlessness and suicidal beha-viour. His agitation was compounded ‘a thousandfold’, as the textoverstates, by his inability to carry out suicide. This inability cameabout by a divinely ordained ‘conspiracy’ of natural forces to thwarthis attempts: the river cast him back upon the shore, the fire did notburn him, the hungry lions ignored him, and so on. This benignconspiracy only enraged and frustrated Shiblc further, compound-ing the distress of his failure to relieve his torment by self-inflicteddeath.wAuuar records that at a later stage in Shiblc’s career, his wordswere able to produce in others the same agitation which the ‘voice’in this earlier episode had produced in him. He was once heardrepeating the word ‘Allah!’ over and over. A youth with a ‘burnedheart’, or laden with anxiety, questioned him as to why he did notrepeat the shahAda formula ‘There is no god but God.’ Shiblc sighedand replied that he feared uttering the negative ‘There is no god’,lest he was unable to reach the affirmative ‘but God’. These wordshad such an effect on the youth that he was struck by a seizure anddied. The youth’s companions hauled Shiblc before the Caliph’scourt and accused him of murder. Shiblc, however, was in a state of"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)115ecstasy, and spoke eloquently of the youth’s readiness for death, hisbeing overwhelmed with love, his purity of heart, his soul being likea bird ready for flight, having severed all earthly connections. TheCaliph accepted Shiblc’s plea of innocence, and was so ‘agitated’ byhis words that he feared toppling from his throne! (T.A. II.166.20 –167.9.) Shiblc’s ecstatic utterance about the shahAdaand his eloquentspeech about the youth’s inner state produced reactions of ecstaticagitation in his listeners, such was the power of his oratory.Anxiety-type states are again seen as contributory to most of thevarious episodes of tremor and agitation recorded in the sourcewritings. Shiblc’s ‘psychotic’ episode has clear signs of being anxiety-driven, with the initial agent a disturbing voice (whatever its origin),and subsequent reinforcing factors compounding the original anxietyto intolerable levels. In this case, the symptoms and their aetiologylargely coincide, the initial anxiety and the later compounded agita-tion being difficult to isolate.The earlier episodes of Shiblc and Sahl Tustarc experiencingagitation on hearing awe-inspiring verses from the Qurxan againappear anxiety-driven. These well-documented accounts are rein-forced by other references to similar reactions recorded of lesserknown or unknown people, to the point where their existence is a‘type’ or paradigm occurring in certain situations.The later episode concerning Shiblc with the youth has ananxiety component, but this and the account of his audience withthe Caliph are also notable as examples of the entrancing effect of(Shiblc’s) oratory, the penetration and power of both its semanticand euphonic qualities. Such effects were noted earlier in this ana-lysis, with the powerful influence of oratory causing fainting andother reactions.K Sighing, groaning, crying outThis category includes a variety of inarticulate sounds produced asa reaction to samAW. The assumption in much of the psychologicalliterature dealing with altered states is that such utterances are largelynon-voluntary.65 This assumption holds well with the evidence fromSufi writings as collated in this analysis, and from contemporarySufi practice as witnessed by Qureshi. The sounds covered by thiscategory can be seen as symptomatic of dissociative states in whichthere is a greater or lesser relinquishing of conscious control overutterances and audible respirations. This category has probably"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)116the largest number of instances cited in the sources, and can thus beregarded as characteristic of the dissociation resulting from samAW.A variety of terms is used in the sources to refer to these audiblerespirations or inarticulate utterances, most notably Arabic shahaqa(‘utter a cry’),{ASa (‘cry out loudly’),zaWaqa (‘call out’), and inPersian mostly naWra zadan (‘raise a cry’).66 It is uncertain whetherany variation in behaviour is indicated by the three distinct verbsused in the Arabic texts. No appreciable difference in semantic rangeis indicated by these verbs, and the alternative forms could simplyreflect literary concerns.The characteristic reaction of Shiblc in the mosque, as noted inthe earlier categories, included his ‘crying out’ as the first sign of analtered state. Indeed this sign was so spectacular that the witness,Abeoayyib al-wAkkc (d.?), relates that he thought that Shiblc haduttered a death cry (LumaW 282.20). Al-wAkkc then noticed the othersigns of Shiblc’s reaction.In category I there was reference made to the disciple of Junaydwho could not control himself from shouting out at the recollectionof God. His efforts to restrain himself from performing an obviouslynon-voluntary behaviour, and the accompanying anxiety, led to hisultimate collapse and death.A narrative which is given considerable space by Sarraj, Qushayrc,Ghazalc and Hujwcrc also has the subject cry out as a prelude tosudden death. A young servant man or beggar dressed in rags over-heard a slave girl singing to her wealthy master on the balcony of amansion beside the Tigris river. The youth was overcome with theverse, and called for the girl to repeat it. When she did, he spokecryptically of hearing a divine message through the verse, where-upon he cried out and died suddenly. The people of Basra came tobury the man, and the wealthy owner dismissed the girl, gave awayhis property and took flight, never to be seen again.67This is the most colourful of several examples of a ‘death cry’reaction to hearing verse or speech regarded by the listener asespecially significant. In one of these narratives, a Khurasanian ques-tioned Junayd on a point of Sufi teaching. When Junayd answered,the man ‘cried out’ and ‘departed’ (kharaja), according to Sarraj,but in Ghazalc’s text, he ‘died’ (mAta).68A meal among friends was left in disarray when a reciter intoneda verse upsetting wUtba al-Ghulam (second/eighth century), whocried out and fell down in a faint (ISyAX II.290.28–33; Mcd. pp.724 –5). This episode, like several others in this category, is comparableto an epileptic-like seizure."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)117In category E above, reference was made to Sulamc’s narrativeabout Samnen crying out and speaking ecstatically. This is clearly adifferent case from crying out as an indicator of seizure or suddendeath. In this example, Samnen’s cry indicates the sudden onset ofa dissociative state which features ecstatic utterance (T.S. 195.7–8).wAuuar relates the conversion of Abemafz al-Naysaberc. Workingas a blacksmith in his shop, he once heard a blind man reciting fromthe Qurxan. Distracted by this, Abemafz touched the iron in thefurnace, brought it out and began working on it until it was pure.When his apprentices shouted to him, Abemafz returned to hisnormal state, cried out and threw the iron away. He immediatelyabandoned his trade and became a Sufi.69 This is an example of adifferent type of inarticulate utterance. Abemafz’ dissociative statewas one in which he lost the faculty of pain sensitivity. His returnto normality meant that he suddenly felt the heat of the iron in hishand, whereupon he cried out in pain and flung the iron away.A final example is of a different type yet again, and perhaps standsalone as a case of inarticulate respiration. Ghazalc quotes a SadCthamong a list of references to the Prophet’s reactions to samAW attest-ing that when he prayed, there was a hissing or boiling sound (azCz)in his chest like that of a cooking pot (ISyAX II.294.6; Mcd. p.734).The exact nature of this phenomenon is unclear, but the text sug-gests that this unusual respiration was heard as a concomitant tohis praying, indicating the fervour and intensity of his action. Arelated phenomenon may be that witnessed of Sufis involved inintensedhikr chanting which produces ‘excitational trance’, as termedby Gilbert Rouget.70 Some types of dhikr involve vocal chord vibra-tions during inhalation and exhalation with very guttural sounds. Araucous panting recalling back-and-forth saw movements is pro-duced, such breathing being likely to cause hyperventilation andsubsequent physiological effects.71Apart from the last two examples above which have their ownparticular explanation, two broad types of inarticulate utteranceare indicated by the source writings. The first is the groan or crywhich heralds a dissociative reaction, and is occasionally the onlynoted behavioural change. More often, there are other signs of thealtered state, such as pallor or fainting, which follow the utterance.Shouting or crying out is a recognised dissociative response to samAWwitnessed in contemporary settings, as noted by Qureshi.72 In thepsychological literature, it is documented that patients sufferingfrom convulsive non-epileptic seizures often demonstrate vocalisation"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)118such as groaning, moaning, crying, gagging and gasping at the com-mencement of their episode.73The second type may be simply an extension of the first, but mayalso be seen as a distinct phenomenon, notably the utterance of a‘death cry’. This is dissociation of a radical kind, a seizure over-whelming the subject to such an extent that sudden death is theoutcome. It should be kept in mind, however, that this ‘cry’ maysimply be a conventional, narrative feature of the source accounts.Arabic has the stock expression ‘he cried out and died’,74 much asin English one says ‘the person collapsed and died’, whether or notactual falling down takes place.L WeepingWeeping can be seen as another feature of dissociative states, asrecognised in the psychological literature.75An episode given some detail and contained in four of the sourcewritings concerns the narrative of Yesuf b.al-musayn of Rayy andhis visitor, Abexl-musayn al-Darraj. After a long journey fromBaghdad, Darraj has difficulty tracing Yesuf in Rayy because thelocal people regard the latter as a freethinker or heretic (zindCq).Eventually Darraj finds Yesuf in a mosque where he has been read-ing the Qurxan all morning without any obvious effect. Al-Darraj’srecital of two verses of secular poetry sets Yesuf weeping bitterly.He immediately confesses his ‘guilt’ of heresy, as claimed by the localpeople, because of his insensitivity to the Qurxan, and the dramaticeffect of secular poetry.76 The texts are ambiguous as to the cause ofYesuf ’s weeping. In the context of a discussion about samAW and itseffects, it could be seen as an emotional reaction following fromthe recital. Given Yesuf ’s explanation and confession of ‘heresy’,on the other hand, his weeping could simply be caused by sorrowand feelings of guilt, though this presents something of a cause-and-effect conundrum. Without the weeping, or some other obvious emo-tional sign, Yesuf has no cause for expressing regret or confessinghis guilt. Is his weeping the result of his guilty feelings, or is it thecause, given that he feels such emotion on hearing secular verserecited, but not on hearing the Qurxan recited? Unfortunately, thereis no guidance offered by the source texts through this convolutedcause and effect situation.A classic case of weeping as an emotional reaction to samAWis recorded by Sulamc concerning a companion of Abemafz al-Naysaberc. The companion had a habit of attending samAWsessions,"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)119and would become aroused, and begin to weep and tear his clothes.Such behaviour was regarded as quite suspect by those whocomplained to Abemafz and asked for some reprimand for theman (T.S. 119.3 –5). The text’s mention of arousal (hAja) is mostadequately interpreted as a reaction of dissociation, the weepingand other behaviours being caused by emotional responses to thebeauty and rapture of the music or poetry.Sulamc also refers to an incident involving Junayd, who, on hear-ing a verse recited in a Baghdad street, began to weep bitterly andspeak ecstatically, embellishing the verse he had heard. This episodehas been referred to above in the category E dealing with ecstaticutterances. Junayd’s weeping appears to be a reaction to hearingthe verse, as the utterance he makes is a personal and emotionaloutpouring prompted by his inner preoccupations at the time.The behaviour of weeping as a typical reaction is documented inthe psychological literature dealing with altered states.77 Despitethis connection, however, most of the cases recorded in the Sufisources can be adequately explained as simple emotional reactionsto varying personal and psychological circumstances. The suddenincursion into the psyche of particular music or verse significant tothe listener can have a dramatic and overwhelming effect which maynot necessarily be due to a special altered state. Some of the categor-ies of reactions dealt with so far indicate the operation of alteredstates or of dissociation, but with the present instance ambiguityremains as to whether such factors need to be invoked. In the Sufisources, however, such behaviours as weeping in these circumstancesdo indicate special reactions which can be regarded as dissociative.M Loss of sensitivity to painThe loss of sensitivity to pain is one of the most interesting of thepsychological reactions to samAW, particularly in its similarity totrance states and other altered state phenomena.One of the defining characteristics of a trance state is that theperson is conscious but seemingly unaware or unresponsive to usualexternal or internal stimuli.78 Roger Walsh’s analysis of the criteriafor mapping various altered states includes reduction of aware-ness to the environment as the first among a list of characteristicdimensions.79This reduction of environmental awareness or reduced respon-siveness to external and internal stimuli may include an increase in"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)120the pain threshold. A complicating factor in the analysis of samAWreactions is that most of the responses encountered are due to anaroused or ergotropic state where sensitivities are heightened, ratherthan reduced. Hyperarousal conditions do not lead to an expectationof reduced sensitivity to pain; this would more usually be expectedof hypoarousal or desensitisation.80The Sufi sources offer two examples of the phenomenon of reducedsensitivity, and an account of a discussion about the possibility ofthis reduction.The classic trance-like state reported of Nerc in the final days ofhis life has been referred to above in category D. Responding torecited verse, Nerc rose up and began wandering around distractedly,stumbling upon newly cut reeds whose sharp canes injured his feetand legs. Though there was severe bleeding, Nerc did not seem tonotice, and in a few days the wounds suppurated and caused hisdeath, possibly due to septicaemia. Nerc’s loss of sensitivity to painappears clearly as a trance-like feature consistent with his otherbehaviours at this time. Being overwhelmed by what he perceivedand understood of the samAW, he became distracted and preoccupied,repeating the verse over and over, wandering around in a daze, andhence oblivious when sharp canes cut his feet.The narrative of Abemafz al-Naysaberc and his conversion, asrecorded by wAuuar, has been referred to above in category K. Beingdistracted by a blind man’s recital of the Qurxan, Abemafz un-knowingly placed his hand in the furnace, and drew out a pieceof hot iron which he beat until it was pure. Returning to his normalstate, Abemafz cried out and flung the iron away, though he wasapparently uninjured. Until he cried out, we may assume he feltno pain from the hot iron, his distraction with the recital causinghim to become oblivious to the heat which his hand must havesensed.One feature of this and similar accounts in wAuuar’sTadhkiratisthat no evident injury is ever received.81 In the narrative of Nerc’strance recorded by the older and more reliable works of Sarraj andGhazalc, mortal injury is inflicted, though the pain of the cut reedswas not felt at the time. With wAuuar’s account, more of a miraculouselement seems to be operating, where any evident injury is unaccount-ably avoided. wAuuar also relates his own version of Nerc’s trance,with additional, more fantastic elements, such as his bleeding legstrickling the word ‘Allah’ onto the ground (T.A. II.55.5 –10). Theseconsiderations make wAuuar’s account less trustworthy than the ear-lier sources."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)121In the KitAb al-LumaW, Sarraj records a discussion between Sarcal-Saqauc and Junayd concerning the possibility of loss of sensitivityto pain (LumaW 306.5 –12). Sarc maintained that a person experien-cingwajd could be hit on the face with a sword and not feel theimpact. Junayd is more sceptical about such an event occurringwithout the subject feeling any pain. Sarc maintains his position,but no anecdotal or theoretical arguments are advanced by eitherparty, and the reported discussion ends there.Situations where loss of sensitivity is reported as an outcome ofsamAW show all the features of being trance-like states. A similarprocess would appear to be operating with trance states recorded inother cultural settings.82 Consciousness is retained, but the subjectis unaware of vital external stimuli, distraction being one of severalrelated experiences congruous with such a state.N Fainting, loss of consciousnessThis behaviour is typical of the psychological reaction to samAW, beingone of the largest categories of responses recorded in the sources.Loss of control, either of consciousness, or of general postural andmuscle co-ordination, is one of the features of altered states inA.M. Ludwig’s system of classification.83In category A above, reference was made to the disciple of Sarcal-Saqauc whom Junayd restored to consciousness after he fell in afaint at the recital of a Qurxanic verse. It was suggested in relationto this case that the rhetorical and semantic elements of the verseand its recital might be suspected as contributing to the faintingseizure. The text clearly states that the recovery was associated witha repetition of the verse which caused the seizure in the first place.It was suggested that induction into and recovery from the alteredstate associated with glossolalia might be seen as a parallel pheno-menon. The use of verbal signals, a short phrase or sentence to bothinduce and recover from the state might have similarities with thecase of Sarc’s disciple. Whatever the mechanisms involved, the textis unambiguous about the behaviour being both a direct reaction tosamAW, and that the same means was used to allow the subject torecover.Sarraj records a narrative concerning Abemulman al-[efc (d.?)which represents a situation of ‘double entendre’, or rather, a classiccase of ‘mishearing’ which sends the subject into an ecstatic state.Encountering a street vendor who was crying out: yA saWtarA barrC"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)122(‘Wild thyme!’), Abemulman fell down in a faint. Explaining hisreaction later, he said that he thought the vendor had said: isWa tarAbirrC (‘Strive to see My righteousness!’, said by God). Sarraj com-ments that what a person hears depends on what is in their heart atthe time, subject to their immediate concerns and state of mind(LumaW 289.7–14).The text is clear that Abemulman’s reaction is that of beingoverwhelmed by his perception of being addressed by God throughthe medium of the street vendor. Sarraj also adds that the prepared-ness of the listener’s mind is a necessary prerequisite, indeed theauthor intimates that the preoccupations of the mind govern whatis perceived.There is the sense in this and certain other cases where a suddenoverwhelming occurs that the subject is on the borderline betweeneveryday consciousness and an altered state. It can be assumed thatbecause almost all the subjects mentioned are Sufis, they would oftenbe in a state of preparedness for altered consciousness, by means ofconstant fasting, meditations and other austerities. There is ampleevidence to show from modern psychological studies that such pre-paredness acts as a strong initiator into altered states.84 This evid-ence and the relative ease of occurrence of altered state behaviourssuggests that many of these subjects experience a ‘twilight’ con-sciousness, living daily in a borderline situation where only a slightstimulus is required to induce a change of state. Abemulman’ssituation illustrates this proposition: because of his mind’s preoccu-pation, a slight mishearing of a street vendor leads him to imaginethat God is speaking to him through this human agency. The importof the ‘message’ is such that, because of his ascetic preparedness, hereadily undergoes a change in consciousness, in this case leadinghim to fall in a temporary faint.In category F above, reference was made to the encounter betweenJunayd and Sarc al-Saqauc, where there was a discussion about love(LumaW 307.10 – 4). Sarc grabbed the skin of his own forearm andsaid: ‘If I had said that this (hand) has withered the other (forearm)from love, it would have been so!’ Sarc lost consciousness and hisface glowed red, covering those around him with light. These tworeactions are seen in the text as resulting from his enigmatic andpowerful statement, an almost ecstatic utterance attesting to thevast power of love. The force of what he had to say is partly demon-strated immediately by Sarc’s loss of consciousness and the redden-ing of his face. This is how the situation is portrayed by the text,and in psychological terms it is readily understood. In light of the"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)123‘borderline’ consciousness outlined with the previous case, Sarc’sown statement initiated a crossover into an altered state manifestedby his temporary loss of consciousness.A similar case has been outlined previously in category B,with the unnamed samAW practitioner referred to by Ghazalc (ISyAxII.285.22 – 6; Mcd. p.707). Hearing a verse which excited him, the manbegan repeating it, using first person referents to apply to himself,and he eventually fainted in pleasure.A different type of reaction is involved in Dhexl-Nen’sencounter with an imitator mentioned in category D above. WhenDhexl-Nen ‘arose in ecstasy’ at a samAW session, he immediately‘fell on his face’, i.e. fell to the floor, possibly in a gesture of adora-tion or prayer. Another man present also rose up, but Dhexl-Nenaddressed him with a verse from the Qurxan, warning of God’swatching over him, whereupon the man immediately sat down(LumaW 289.20 –290.9;ISyAX II.291.19–25; Mcd. p.727).Both Ghazalc and Sarraj who record this encounter focus theirinterpretative attention onto the imitative and posturing behaviourof the man. Dhexl-Nen’s falling to the ground, following so closelyupon his ‘rising’ in ecstasy, is probably a dissociative reaction fromthe ecstasy he experienced. According to the events related in the text,there was no loss of consciousness involved with this falling, as Dhexl-Nen was able to speak immediately to the man who attempted toimitate his behaviour. It is possible that the falling was a direct resultof his sudden ‘rising’ to his feet, being caused, for example, by asudden lowering of blood pressure which led Dhexl-Nen to faintmomentarily. It is also possible, as mentioned earlier, that he arosein an altered state but quickly fell to the ground in adoration or asimilar gesture appropriate to the elation and ecstasy he experienced.Reference was made earlier in categories K and L to Ghazalc’snarrative about the meal at which wUtba al-Ghulam was a guest.When a reciter intoned some verse, wUtba cried out and fell in afaint, while his companions left the meal untouched (ISyAX II.290.28 –33; Mcd. pp.724 –5).A final example will suffice from Hujwcrc’sKashf al-MaSjEb(534.14 –535.4; Nich. p.410). Ibrahcm Khawwaz (d.291/904) waswalking with a companion when the latter began to sing some lovepoetry. Ibrahcm was so enthralled that he danced a few steps andhis feet seemed to penetrate the rocks as if the latter were wax. Hethen fell down bC-hEsh, literally ‘out of his senses’, or unconscious.On recovering, he said: ‘I was in the garden of paradise and you didnot see (i.e. you were unaware).’ It is worth noting that the frequent"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)124expression found in the Persian texts, bC-hEsh, covers both the sensesof ‘unconscious’ and ‘in ecstasy’, illustrating the close relationshipin semantics as well as in reality between unconsciousness and alteredstates.An hypothesis was offered earlier in this discussion suggestingthat ‘borderline’ consciousness among the Sufis may be a factor inallowing an altered state to occur so readily. There is support forsuch an idea in psychological studies of altered states which exam-ine factors assisting changes of consciousness. It has been shownthat fasting, by reducing blood sugar levels, readily affects consci-ousness in dramatic ways.85 It was mentioned above that auster-ities and ascetic practices among the Sufis were common, and it isquite probable that these would have been a contributing factor insome of the cases of fainting dealt with here. Clearly there is noreference in the narratives to the condition of any of their subjects,but the likelihood of ascetic practices playing a part should be keptin mind. Such factors as hyperventilation and rhythmic sensorystimulation or ‘driving’, as carried out in samAW sessions, are alsoknown contributors to altered states.86 Given that several of theabove cases of fainting occurred in samAW sessions, it is likely thatthese physiological factors also played a role.The cumulative effect of these factors tends to mitigate the un-expectedness and the abnormality of altered state reactions such asfainting. When a physiological explanation is able to account forsome of these reactions in non-pathological terms, there is a greatersense that such events are quite expected and characteristic.In terms of the Sufi source writings themselves, all these reactionsare seen as ‘overwhelming’ crises resulting from perceived audi-tions. It is not what is actually heard that is the cause, but what isperceived by the subject, given his / her particular state of mind atthe time. The subject’s predisposition and preparedness for what isperceived is all-important, but unfortunately for the modern reader,few background details on the subjects are ever given. Indeed, forthe source writers, it sometimes appears not to matter much whetherfainting, crying out, weeping, or any other reaction occurs, as anyand all of these are expected outcomes. The psychology of the sourcewriters will be dealt with in more detail in Chapter 6 of this book.O Restless wanderingThis is one of the less frequently recorded behaviours associated withsamAW, some four examples occurring in the source writings. This"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)125behaviour is clearly part of an altered state reaction, and classicnotions of trance seem to be indicated. In wandering distractedly, thesubject often performs highly stereotyped and patterned behaviours,seemingly acting without personal volition or conscious control.87 Itis typical that the person experiencing this state has decreased sen-sitivity to environmental stimuli, and apparent increased preoccu-pation with inner events and promptings.These characteristics are amply illustrated by the episode of Nerc’sfinal trance, discussed in categories D, E and M above. When Nercheard the verses which so affected him, he arose and began wander-ing about distractedly, oblivious to his stumbling upon sharp reeds.The stereotyped behaviour displayed here was his continuous audiblerepetition of the verse, and his wandering about in a trance-likemanner, showing a lack of conscious control. His obliviousness topain caused by walking over the sharp reeds shows reduced sensit-ivity to external stimuli and increased preoccupation with internalevents.Nerc also figures in a narrative recounted only by wAuuar and, inan abbreviated form, by the Sufi author Abe Bakr al-Kalabadhc inhisKitAb al-TaWarruf (Book of Knowledge).88 In wAuuar’s version,Nerc is reported to have been seen wandering about for some dayswith a brick in his hand, not eating or drinking, but performing allthe rites of prayer at the proper times. Junayd is reported to be indisagreement with his companions over whether this is a true alteredstate. Junayd argues that it is, since God ‘preserves’ those in ecstasyto observe the rituals of worship. This episode of Nerc’s has manyclassic trance-like features, with a genuine diminution of awareness,and stereotyped behaviour in his wandering about distractedly. Itappears, however, that he retained a channel of consciousness opento the external world whereby he knew the times for ritual prayer.This notion of a channel is also apparent in that Junayd drew Nercout of his trance-like state by speaking words of good counsel tohim. Apparently his reasoning faculties were not completely closedoff to external stimuli, as Junayd’s words were able to have a heal-ing effect.A short narrative is related by Sarraj concerning Abe BakrMusammad al-Duqqc (d.366/977) who arose in the middle of thenight and wandered or stumbled around (yatakhabbaUa), falling over,and rising up again. The people around him wept, and his beha-viour was remembered in verse (LumaW 292.4 – 6). This appears muchlike a case of somnambulism, where some purposeful or preoccupiedstate is assumed, with clumsy behaviour ensuing.89 However, the"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)126text presupposes some auditory causation for this episode, thoughnone is actually stated. It must be assumed, then, that a trance-likereaction is indicated, an altered waking state rather than a situationwhere the subject is asleep. In this respect, there are some similar-ities with the first case of Nerc outlined above, namely the lack ofapparent conscious control, and heedlessness toward the externalenvironment as well as to pain stimuli.The fourth example which is related to this category is the ‘psy-chotic’ episode recorded of Shiblc, as mentioned above in section J(T.A. II.162.18–163.3). When Shiblc heard a divine voice, he becameagitated to the point of wanting to commit suicide, and travelledafar seeking various means of deliverance. His wandering distract-edly in this way could be classified under the present category,though it should probably be seen as part of his more general,overwhelming agitation and obsessive directedness of behaviour.Some of the qualities associated with a trance-like state of restlesswandering are applicable, namely his inner orientation and directed-ness, an apparent decrease in voluntary control, and lack of regardfor consequences.The four cases cited here have several features in common whichsuggest a similar typology. These features include a decrease inenvironmental awareness, trance-like or stereotyped qualities, suchas obsessively directed behaviour and preoccupation of mind, and adecrease in voluntary control. There are some obvious overlapshere with behaviours from other categories previously mentioned,but this particular reaction has its own features which warrant theirown discussion.P Loss of voluntary control of limbsThere is little mention of this aspect of the reaction to samAW, apartfrom some general, vaguely worded references which occur in ‘cata-logues’ of effects. At one point in Sarraj’sLumaW there is a lengthydiscussion about the preference of showing no external signs of reac-tion over showing signs such as agitation and involuntary motionof limbs (Lumaw 308.3ff ). This discussion of Sarraj’s is purely theoret-ical and didactic, with no additional information about the phenom-enology of the behaviour.Mention of this reaction, however vaguely given, is importantfor the description of the altered states associated with samAW. It isan expected addition to the portrayal of these states, given the exist-ence of the other behaviours referred to more frequently. Where"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)127trance-like states are encountered in various forms, with loss ofvoluntary control over certain behaviours, the loss of motor co-ordination can also be expected. Studies of non-epileptic seizuresshow that this loss of control or of co-ordination is a character-istic feature, whether the seizure is convulsive or otherwise.90 Manyseizures can closely resemble epileptic fits in their display of theseobvious symptoms, though such seizures appear to have a psycho-genic rather than neurological basis.Such epileptiform reactions come very near to some of the beha-viours following the practice of samAW. In modern Sufi settings,however, there is little mention of this reaction, though Qureshidoes refer to ecstatic activities where more ordered and controlledmotor responses are expressed.91Q Throwing oneself (or being thrown) to the groundA reaction such as being thrown to the ground is clearly anepileptiform behaviour, and it would appear that similar causativeprocesses as with the previous category are operating. A psycho-genic basis for this activity would seem appropriate, yet the result-ant form resembles behaviour stemming from abnormal neurologicalcauses.wAuuar relates a narrative concerning masan of Basra (d.110/728),one of the earliest Sufis, revered for his piety and outspokenness.masan had a disciple who would be thrown to the ground everytime he heard a verse from the Qurxan.masan spoke to the manabout his affliction, telling him that if this was a voluntary action,he was kindling the fire (of hell) for all his actions in life. If it wasnot voluntary, warned masan, it was an affliction from Satan whichmust be overcome (T.A. I.28.17–24). In either situation, as masansaw it, the man was on dangerous ground with this undesirable,perhaps demonic condition. It also shows clearly that for the piousof this early period in Islamic history, such activity was seen nodifferently from that of seven centuries earlier. In Palestine duringthe time of Jesus, or at least of the gospel writers, epileptiformbehaviour was viewed as stemming from demonic possession, theonly recourse being miraculous intervention.92masan does not goas far as suggesting actual possession, but unfortunately the text isunclear as to the precise nature of what action should be taken ifthere is a demonic cause.This narrative is suggestive of the account discussed earlier ofJunayd’s disciple who cried out upon hearing dhikr. In both these"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)128cases the sound of the reciting provoked a dissociative responsewith epileptiform characteristics. Both crying out and falling to theground can be viewed as stemming from similar causative factors,either neurological or, more likely, psychogenic.93R Attempt at suicideThis is one of the more extreme reactions to samAW, suggesting ahighly emotional response of psychotic proportions. It is possiblethat in a subject suffering extreme stress, there is temporary derange-ment of the mind, aided by the emotive stimulus of samAW, whichcould cause an attempt at suicide. This is the scenario in one of therecorded accounts, while in the other, there is a longer lasting psy-chotic derangement where suicide is attempted several times.This latter case is that of Shiblc’s insanity referred to on variousoccasions above (categories J and O). Driven to distraction by a‘voice’ which instructed him to seek ‘the Namer’ (or ‘the Named’),Shiblc became highly agitated and sought death on a number ofoccasions by various means, including drowning, jumping off amountain, and self-immolation. Being frustrated by his unsuccess-ful attempts, his anxiety increased so much that he needed restrain-ing and placing in an asylum (T.A. II.162.18 –163.3). The pathologicalnature of this episode is clear, as it has many of the signs of aparanoid psychosis. One of the unfortunate effects of psychoticillness is that the auditory hallucinations often become so intensethat the sufferer seeks relief through extreme and dangerous means.This was the case with Shiblc, who was driven to distraction bythe ‘voice’ he heard, and by the accompanying agitation. It is alsoshown by the narrative that this was no momentary derangement;his varied attempts at suicide indicate a lengthy process, as does hisconfinement in an asylum, where he remained for some time. Thenarrative continues from the account of his insanity to describe hisactivity while he stayed in the asylum, giving teaching to visitorsand followers, and his evident recovery.The other narrative in this category has a rather more tragicoutcome, with the subject succeeding in his attempt at suicide. Thedescription of Shiblc’s psychosis is disturbing enough, but the accountof the Israelite youth who threw himself from a mountain has adarker and more perplexing aspect. This strange account is recordedonly by Ghazalc, and is claimed as a Tradition reaching back to theProphet. The youth, who was unnamed, was reported to have askedhis mother some profound questions about the identity of the Creator"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)129of the heavens and the earth, the mountains and the clouds. Themother replied in traditional fashion ‘God Most High’ in answer toeach question. The youth then proclaimed ‘Indeed I hear somethingfrom God!’ whereupon he threw himself from the mountain andwas killed (ISyAx II.278.35 –279.3; Mcd. p.234).Ghazalc explains that it seemed that the youth ‘heard’ somethingwhich indicated God’s power and majesty and which sent him intoan ecstasy, causing his suicide. Several questions remain unanswered,however, by this account. First, there is real ambiguity over thesource of what the youth heard. It may have been contained in hismother’s answers, or he may have suddenly heard a ‘divine’ orhallucinatory voice speaking to him. If he heard an imagined voice,stemming from his own deranged mind, the suicide is rather moreexplicable. Yet there is no indication of what the ‘voice’ said to him.Various other possibilities present themselves. For example, theyouth’s claim to have heard ‘something’ from God may have pre-cipitated delusions of grandeur. Imagining he was being spoken toby God may have led him to believe he had special powers of self-protection. There are other scenarios which could be followed up;indeed this is fertile ground for a psychiatric investigation. Theyouth’s asking ‘ultimate’ questions indicates a clarity of mind anddepth of perception which sometimes precedes certain psychoticepisodes, and which may later develop into more bizarre feelings ofpersecution, hallucinations or severe mood swings.These various possibilities all point to a disturbed, if not psychotic,mind. The only explanation which does not lead to such a conclu-sion is if the lad actually heard a divine voice, and that the ecstasyhe experienced led to an accidental fall due to a state of physicaldisorientation. This is close to the explanation offered by Ghazalc,except for the mention of an accidental fall. Both Ghazalc’s explana-tion, and the Tradition he quotes, have the verb ramA, ‘he threw’,as active, with object ‘himself ’. This can only indicate voluntary,premeditated action, and so the idea of an accidental death must beruled out. Moreover, the text is replete with indications of mental,not physical, disorientation. Though this derangement may haveonly been temporary, the stimulus of the situation, and his appar-ent audition of a ‘divine’ voice, was sufficient to cause an ecstaticreaction which precipitated his fall. This is part of Ghazalc’s argu-ment, though in psychological terms the episode would more likelybe seen as psychotic in character.This leads to the observation that ancient Sufi analyses of suchreactions tend to normalise, assimilate and situate them in the context"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)130of both everyday life and the prevailing theology. Modern psycho-logical analyses, on the other hand, tend to view such behavioursas ‘pathological’ and disordered, emphasising their disruption andfailure to comply with social or personal contexts. This explan-atory difference is rather curious, given the far greater understand-ing of psychology in today’s science, but a reduced ability to allowaltered states to be seen as part of everyday consciousness andbehaviour.94S Sudden deathThis final category deals, of course, with the most serious outcomeof all and, for the early Sufi sources, it is one of the most frequentlymentioned reactions. Most of the cases referred to here describedeath as coming suddenly, with suggestions of a precipitate seizureor collapse of some type. In only one case is the dying process moreprolonged: Nerc died of probable septicaemia some days after beinginjured while in a trance state.An ingenious suggestion is to propose that the usual terms, suchas Arabic mAta (‘he died’) or Persian jAn bi-dAd (‘he gave up hissoul/life’), indicate not actual death but a type of cataleptic trance.Catalepsy can often mimic death to a very great extent, includinglack of pulse, lack of apparent breathing, rigidity and loss of bodywarmth.95 These symptoms have occasionally been mistaken fordeath, and it is not improbable that this occurred more frequentlyin ancient times. It is possible that samAW may have produced atrance-like state of catalepsy, but there is really no evidence for thisin the present texts. There is no indication that the usual terms fordeath mean anything other than their accepted signification.In discussing sudden death as a result of samAW, modern research inrelated fields suggests that a high proportion of people experiencingaltered state behaviours or seizures have pre-existing stress factorsin their lives. This may merely be restating some obvious findingssuch as stress being related to sudden cardiac arrest, yet it may wellbe significant for the present discussion.Research into glossolalia has found that more than 85 per cent of‘tongue-speakers’ had experienced a clearly defined anxiety crisisjust prior to their initiation into speaking.96 Studies of sudden deathin the general population suggest that stressful or critical precipit-ating conditions were usually present. These included the deathor illness of someone close, mourning, grief, personal danger or relieffrom danger, triumph, loss of status, and others. The precipitating"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)131event was impossible to ignore, it was abrupt or dramatic, andproduced excitation in a situation over which there was no con-trol.97 Such studies suggest that predisposing conditions of stress inthe individual may help explain the onset of an abrupt seizure. Inthe psychological literature, sudden death, perhaps due to cardiacarrhythmia, is reported as a possible outcome of what is termedDissociative Trance Disorder.98In our study of samAW and its effects, such predisposing conditionsare rarely known from the textual evidence. In one case, however,the author does mention the subject having a pre-existing anxiety:wAuuar refers to a youth as sukhta-dil, literally ‘burned of heart’, i.e.‘anxious, troubled’. It can be shown that this narrative hint is import-ant in explaining the sudden crisis experienced by the youth whichcaused his death. Unfortunately, such significant indicators are rarelygiven, and the reader is mostly left uninformed about similar back-ground factors which could assist explanation.The quite large number of sudden death cases mentioned in thesources may perhaps be reduced when it is considered that severalofwAuuar’s examples appear to be literary hyperbole. This is occa-sioned by the author’s desire to characterise some of the Sufi mastersas ‘saints’ by recording their deeds as imitative of the actions ofDavid, the Israelite prophet. A pious tradition has it that David’svoice was so beautiful that it entranced those who listened to hisrecitals of the Psalms, and on one occasion some four hundredlisteners were carried out dead from the assembled crowd! (LumaW268.3 – 6.)This tradition may well be the basis of wAuuar’s accounts of thepreaching sessions of the illustrious Junayd and Yasya b. Muwadh(d.258/871). The embellishment of the Sufi masters’ reputations withaccounts of their miracles and their marvellous acts is a well-knownfeature of wAuuar’s writings. The author is most likely relying onhyperbole in recording that Junayd once preached to 40 people, 18of whom died, with the remainder left unconscious by the power ofhis oratory (T.A. II.11.10 –12). Similarly, Yasya b. Muwadh began apreaching tour of Khurasan, and each day more and more people‘died’ from among those who listened to him (T.A. I.312.2– 4). Thesenarratives may be regarded as hyperbole occasioned by a hagio-graphic desire to sanctify the reputation of these Sufi masters.This limits to some extent the number of references to suddendeath in the source writings. Notwithstanding these mitigatingfactors, however, there still remain several accounts whose authen-ticity is less questionable."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)132The case of Junayd’s disciple, who tried to keep himself fromshouting out at the recollection of God’s name, has been referred toabove in sections I and K. This narrative is securely grounded, withits inclusion in four of the sources.99 The above-mentioned correla-tion between existing stress factors and sudden seizure is certainlyclear in this case. The man’s attempt to restrain himself under painof dismissal from the master’s presence showed in symptoms ofexcessive perspiration. He was obviously suffering extreme anxiety,and a crisis condition ensued during this period. It is plausible thathis attempt to control an automatism eventually failed, and that hesuddenly collapsed and died.Another narrative also recorded by three sources is that of theservant/beggar who overheard the slave girl singing to her master(category K). There is less evidence here of the cause and conditionsaccompanying the man’s sudden death. All that can be surmised isthat the man experienced a dissociative reaction, evidenced by hisalmost ecstatic exclamation on hearing the verse. He believed that adivine voice had spoken to him, and that ‘God was transforminghim by His Truth’. The man then uttered a death cry and died,seemingly as a result of this overwhelming experience.Sarraj records a rather strange account whose purpose seems tobe an illustration of the power of Qurxanic recital. A shaykh and hisdisciples visited a fellow shaykh, and when one of the first shaykh’sentourage began reciting from the Qurxan, one of the other’s com-panions cried out and died. The following morning, the same per-son began to read, but the second shaykh cried out and caused thereader to die! (LumaW 287.5 –10.) Though nothing else is knownabout the background of the two unnamed masters, it would appearfrom the narrative that a sort of feud or vendetta was being wagedbetween them. There is an almost farcical element in this narrative,and some retributive actions being played out. The text gives a hintof foul play such as a vendetta by stating that the two mastersafterwards said to each other that the first action was the moreunjust. This narrative is probably a bad illustration of the power ofQurxanic recital, if this was Sarraj’s purpose, for it merely illustratesthe base motives of rivalry and revenge.There are several other short references to sudden death resultingfromsamAW which have little value for this discussion due to the brief-ness of the accounts. One of these, however, is a short narrativeconcerning a man who was bathing in the Euphrates when a passer-by recited a Qurxanic verse of judgement. The man began to trembleor shiver with agitation, and soon sank and was drowned (ISyAX"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)133II.295.5 – 6, Mcd. p.737). This is a quite straightforward account ofdeath by drowning. There is, however, the secondary cause of hear-ing the recited verse, which provoked the man’s agitation and led tohis unsteadiness in the water.Mention was made in category K concerning the man who ques-tioned Junayd on a dogmatic point, and when Junayd answered, theman cried out and ‘died’, according to Ghazalc, but only ‘departed’,according to Sarraj. A likely explanation of this difference is thatGhazalc mistook Sarraj’s earlier text which read kharaja, ‘he de-parted’, as a euphemism for death, perhaps on the basis of theman’s dissociative reaction to Junayd’s speech. In any event, thisdifference illustrates the questionable reliability of some of theseaccounts, particularly where sudden death is referred to in a casual,matter-of-fact way. It may also show the reluctance of some authors,particularly the trustworthy Sarraj, to overplay the frequency ofsituations where sudden death was reported. Perhaps Sarraj’s use ofeuphemism, if this can be shown, was due to his natural cautionand tendency for understatement.Finally, there is the case of Shiblc and the youth referred to inwAuuar’sTadhkirat. Shiblc was repeating the name of God when ayouth ‘burned of heart’, meaning troubled or anxious, asked himwhy he did not recite the profession of faith. Shiblc replied that hefeared saying the negative ‘There is no god . . .’ lest he did not reachthe positive ‘. . . but God’! The youth trembled and died on thespot, and his companions accused Shiblc of murder (T.A. II.166.20 –167.9). Despite the suddenness of the youth’s seizure, an explanatoryhint is given in the text’s mention of his pre-existing anxiety statewhich evidently had some role to play in his death. This is signific-ant in light of the modern correlation found between pre-existingstress conditions and sudden death.Apart from some very brief references which have no value forphenomenological discussion, at the end of this survey there aresome four or five instances of sudden death which remain note-worthy. In two of these cases, the youth spoken to by Shiblc, andthe disciple of Junayd who could not help crying out, there is aclear condition of underlying anxiety or stress which provides con-vincing evidence of being a causal factor. Some doubt remains overthe narrative of the two shaykhs and the deaths of their followers.This account may be nothing more than an exaggerated record ofrivalry and feuding between the two parties, perhaps with some dis-play of ‘magic’ powers added to the situation. Its reliability remains"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 1)134suspect, and it cannot be regarded in a completely serious vein. Theman drowned in the Euphrates is a death by misadventure, prob-ably caused by anxiety at hearing the sacred text proclaiming God’sjudgement, which was taken literally and personally. The man whoquestioned Junayd certainly experienced dissociation, but there issome doubt in the texts as to whether or not he died. This leaves theone remaining instance of the beggar who died unexpectedly uponhearing poetry recited, which he understood as God speaking dir-ectly to him. Again, he clearly experienced dissociation, but there isno straightforward explanation for his sudden collapse and death.This is rather inadequate evidence for the direct effect of samAW incausing death. The question of textual reliability is raised in thispresent discussion more than in most previous categories. Whetherit is wAuuar’s zealousness to sanctify the memory of the Sufi mastersby an exaggerated account of the power of their oratory, or thedubious account of the two feuding shaykhs, or Sarraj and Ghazalc’sfailure to agree on whether a man ‘died’ or merely ‘departed’, thiscategory has attracted more than its share of narrative and textualdoubts. This is of particular concern in the case of such a dramaticoutcome for samAW as sudden death. One must concede that theevidence is inconclusive, and it would be hasty to claim that thisreaction is a characteristic feature of the altered states associatedwithsamAW. Equally, like the narratives of the man who drowned, andthe anxious youth addressed by Shiblc, there may be other mitigat-ing circumstances and contributory factors which are unknown inthose cases which appear to be directly caused by samAW.Notes1 Gilbert Rouget, Music and Trance: A Theory of the Relations betweenMusic and Possession, Chicago, IL and London: University of ChicagoPress, 1985.2 Jean During, Musique et extase: L’audition mystique dans la traditionsoufie, Paris: Albin Michel, 1988.3 Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives, New Haven, CT: Yale Uni-versity Press, 1988, p.35.4 Ibid., pp.35 – 6.5 For example, LumaW 271.7ff; and Regula B.

There seems to be no one specificcondition or state which can be seen as a particular result of samAW.Conversely, it appears that the effects of music, recitation and otheraural stimuli are multifarious, and dependent on a number of factors,physiological, psychological, cultural, and otherwise.This is perhaps only a modern way of restating what the earlySufi writers already knew, that samAW is a multifaceted and diversephenomenon. It may also point to the rudimentary nature of mod-ern knowledge about the states and behaviours witnessed in theseearly texts. One could argue, for instance, that closer analysis ofthese behaviours might well reveal a single underlying condition. Itmay also be possible to give a unified explanation, based on greaterunderstanding of the contributory factors. However, the presentstate of knowledge in the psychology of altered states means thatsuch an explanation is not possible at the moment.The contributory factorsIn the above discussions, it has always been assumed that samAWwas the primary or initial cause of the observed behaviours. Music,words and other sounds were seen as the principal contributoryfactors. The significant part played by aural stimuli in heighteningemotions, altering moods and changing physiological states cannotbe overemphasised. Many of the proposed contributory factors onthe right hand side of the above table are a manifestation of thisbasic assumption.There is adequate demonstration of this effect in the researchliterature on altered states, music psychology and from other sources.Gilbert Rouget, in his classic work on trance, argues that in samAWthe ‘culturally conditioned’ emotive impact of music has an entran-cing effect. The overwhelming, transcendent force of samAWproducesa crisis which may result in a total invasion and occupation ofconsciousness, an illumination, a collapse, and unusual behavioural"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 2)142manifestations. Moreover, argues Rouget, music has the power ofinducing trance only because it is a vehicle for words charged withmeaning.1 Rouget also asserts that trance can be stimulated byphysiological means, as with dhikr, by the repetition of words andphrases accompanied by body movements and rhythms. Certaintypes of breathing can produce hyperventilation, and the combinedeffect of rhythmic movement or dance is likely to change physio-logical equilibrium, and even produce convulsive effects.2The preceding analysis tends to question some of these assertionsof Rouget. It has been shown, for example, that music has the powerto transform without it being merely a vehicle for the semantic impactof words. The ‘music’ of secular, sensual verse is one case in pointwhere there is minimal semantic content likely to evoke an ecstaticreaction among religious mystics. The episode of the scholars’assembly where Nerc recited love poetry is an example of this. Norcan it be allowed that the sublimation, in Freudian terms, of suchverse with mystical or spiritual meaning legitimates this argument.It is the non-semantic aspect of poetry in Islamic culture which hasalways given it such evocative power.As for the physiological effects of dhikr, rhythmic chanting andmovement, it is notable that these effects frequently occur outsidethe formal and ritual settings assumed by Rouget’s argument. Thereis no denying that they may occur in formal settings, but many ofthe episodes recorded by the source writings are in everyday placeswhere there is no possibility of ritual or formal samAW. This seems tosuggest that these effects or reactions are accessible in a range ofsituations. It may also be the case that the change from everydayconsciousness to an altered state is not such a difficult or unusualprocess.With these modifications, however, the essence of Rouget’s argu-ment stands. The overwhelming nature of the force or crisis pro-duced by samAW is obvious in nearly all the situations describedin the sources. This basic fact is clearly present in the minds of thesource writers, however much the modern reader may wish to qualifythe force of samAW by pointing to contributory social or psycholo-gical factors.It is clear from contemporary research in music psychology thatphysiological responses to aural stimuli can be both significant anddetectable, even in sterile laboratory settings. There is some doubt,however, whether consistent reactions can be found over a rangeof people without variations due to individual differences, culturalhabituation to music, or other predisposing factors.3"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 2)143IfsamAW can be seen as the primary or initial cause of the reac-tions recorded in the source texts, the factors on the right hand sideof the above table may be seen as secondary or contributory.Types of secondary factorsDissociationThe analysis summarised in the above table does not always requirea recourse to dissociation or altered states as a means of descriptionor explanation. In other words, many of the behaviours resultingfromsamAW can be seen in terms familiar from everyday experience,though at an exaggerated or intensified level. The assumption ofabnormal states of behaviour or consciousness is not required formany of the observed phenomena.It needs to be questioned whether we should assume an under-lying dissociative state in cases where ‘everyday’ explanations canreadily be found. Methodologically, it is preferable to assume themore obvious and least complicated explanation than to resort atonce to abnormal or pathological aetiologies. This is another aspectof the point mentioned in category R of Chapter 4 about the readi-ness of modern psychology, at least until very recently, to emphasisethe pathological view. The early Sufi writers, in dealing with the samephenomena, saw the integration and relative normality of thesebehaviours within their particular cultural and religious context.4Yet if an assumption of dissociation is not often required, theexamples where it is operative clearly show similar, commonly occur-ring features. Most of these cases provide evidence of trance-likeor epileptiform characteristics, where there are directed behaviours,automatisms, involuntary actions, and the like. These appear symp-tomatic of a basic disturbance of mental and physiological state, theorigins of which cannot be adequately explained from the availabletextual evidence. It seems likely, in the absence of other significantexplanatory factors, that altered states are involved in these situ-ations, even if this provides merely a descriptive mechanism.Stress and anxiety factorsThis class of contributory factors was seen as significant in the abovediscussion and analysis. While these factors may be more vaguelydefined and perhaps less amenable to precise analysis, they are never-theless present in a number of the episodes recorded in the sources."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 2)144In fact, explanations relating to stress and anxiety are as commonas any relating to altered states.The frequency and wide representation of these contributoryfactors might suggest that psychogenic explanations underlie manyof the reactions to samAW. The ‘release’ mechanism of Yesuf b. al-musayn’s joy followed by weeping, or the several examples of anxi-ety induced by Qurxan recitation, or Sarc’s glowing face and Shiblc’spallor, examples of perspiring, tremor and agitation, weeping, andso on, attest to the variety and characteristic nature of this explana-tion. Such widely occurring behaviours are attributable to stressor anxiety factors, and many are typical of the reactions to samAW.This may indicate that psychological, rather than neurological orpurely physiological explanations underlie many of these typicalreactions.Physiological factorsThe physiological factors which can be seen as contributory fall intotwo broad categories. First, there are self-induced effects, the resultsof ascetic practices such as fasting, meditation, the practice of dhikrresulting in hyperventilation, and so on. The second category offactors are largely involuntary, and include changes in physiologicalfunctioning and psychological states caused by internal bodily andmental processes. The first category tends to affect the second, asceticpractices being mainly designed to induce different states of bodyor mind. Equally, there is a reciprocal relationship between changesin physiological functioning and the body–mind’s influence on asceticpractices and behaviours.In the discussion and analysis in Chapter 4 there were some clearexamples of the effects of ascetic practices. Shiblc’s seizure in themosque during the month of Ramadan is a good example wherethe practice of fasting is almost certainly contributory. The case ofSahl Tustarc’s trance where he would fast for over three weeks is anexample of one of the two types of effects just outlined. Either Sahl’sfasting was voluntary, which explains the altered state he experi-enced, or else his internal ‘state’ itself affected him to the extent thathe was unable to eat for a lengthy period.The scarcity of references in the sources to such physiologicaleffects cannot be due to a lack of knowledge of the direct relation-ship between ascetic practices and the body–mind’s functioning.There can be no question that a sophisticated understanding ofthese relationships was widespread during this period of Islamic"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 2)145society. Ascetic practices among Sufi groupings depended on thisbasic knowledge.5This leads to the consideration that such effects are a largelyunknown quantity when it comes to analysing the phenomena foundin the source writings. It may well be that these widespread prac-tices were simply assumed as operative among participants of samAW.The reactions recorded were perhaps seen as resulting from suchpractices already assumed, which were not even worth mentioning.If this was the case, then these physiological factors would be moreinfluential than was previously acknowledged here. It may well bethat many of the behaviours which are aetiologically ambiguous tothe modern reader were readily explicable in their original setting.However this may be, it is not really possible to go beyond theavailable textual evidence. It was noted earlier that many possibilit-ies may be extrapolated from the texts, but these cannot be seriouslyconsidered without other corroborating evidence.‘Everyday’ explanationsThis class of factors could perhaps be more aptly named, but theterm ‘everyday’ seeks to include several types of explanation whichare familiar from ordinary experience. No special state of mindor behaviour is assumed or required, but rather the heightening orintensification of ordinary emotions, experiences and behaviouralresponses.One example of this is the heightened arousal and emotion whichmay contribute to ecstatic utterances of the non-compulsive type. Itis not really necessary to assume that some form of altered state isoperating when the type of utterance recorded here is explicable onthe basis of strong, overwhelming emotion. High levels of arousal andemotion, with the full operation of consciousness and human creativefaculties, are adequate in explaining such utterances, as witnessed inordinary experience. Similarly, the emotion of strong empathy, forexample, explains the reaction of the assembly in Musasibc’s pres-ence, when he arose and wept.Other familiar reactions include the fear aroused by Qurxanicrecital, where the reading of the sacred and revered text evokesa strong emotion or physical response of varying proportions. Someof these responses may appear dramatic, particularly to the mod-ern reader who may have been desensitised by the ready availab-ility of highly charged, evocative music and mass media, and alsodesensitised to the powerful influence of religious ritual and sacred"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 2)146recitation. Yet these reactions are not out of the ordinary orabnormal, requiring the assumption of altered states. They are simplystrong, emotional effects, the heightening of everyday reactions whichare probably less familiar in a technological and secular society thanin earlier times.Social and cultural factorsThe phenomena being discussed are firmly located within a veryspecific cultural and religious context. The Islamic societies of theMiddle East from the second/eighth to the sixth/twelfth centuriesare the historical and cultural setting for the texts and their narrat-ives. Beyond these more obvious settings, however, lie rather moresubtle influences on behaviour which are not just outward mani-festations of a particular religious system. It has been proposed inthe analysis, for example, that some of the group dynamics or socialbehaviour mechanisms operating within Sufi communities mayaccount for some of the mass behaviours apparent in samAW rituals.The socialisation processes operating in closed or restricted religi-ous communities where there is a dominant master and a group ofinexperienced novices may well account for some of the reactionsnoted in the texts.The conflict and tension between Junayd and his aberrant dis-ciple who could not control spontaneous crying out while listeningto certain religious texts produced a very onerous burden on theyouth. It is not surprising that the anxiety caused by this conflicteventually overwhelmed the disciple.Though the ritual of samAW has developed and formalised sincethe time of these early texts, there is some evidence of ritualisedbehaviour already in the mass risings recorded in the texts. This isabove and beyond the stated rules of etiquette outlined by authorssuch as Ghazalc in his ISyAX, or his brother Majd al-Dcn in his shortwork devoted to samAW, the BawAriq al-IlmAW. The mass risings sug-gest a ritualised response to the proceedings deriving from a shared,or affected, psychological reaction not mentioned in the relevanttexts. They contain the elements of highly structured and socialisedbehaviour patterns instilled in the community of Sufis.It is perhaps not unusual that this aspect of behaviour was notcommented upon by contemporary authors. Many of these authorswere themselves members of similar communities, and critical obser-vations on social psychology could not be expected in their writ-ings. An outsider in time and culture often sees more clearly those"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 2)147things which the insider ignores or assumes. It is unfortunate thatmany other aspects of the practice of samAW were not thought ofsufficient value for those first authors to document for future in-quirers. There are several points in the texts where further elabora-tion on the social setting of the events taking place would haveproved invaluable for understanding the dynamics of these situ-ations more fully. One example is the episode related of al-Duqqcwho ‘wandered around’ at night, falling down and getting up againin a sort of trance state. It is noted cryptically that people wouldweep at his behaviour, and that his actions became proverbial. Doesthis mean that a sort of communal or ritual activity was takingplace, or do ‘the people’ refer to members of his immediate familywho witnessed his nightly trance? It is unfortunate that we lack thedetails which would have helped in understanding the social con-text of such episodes.Mention was made above about the importance of the relation-ship between master and disciple in Sufi communities. The episodecentring around the dynamic between Makkc and his ill disciple (incategory A) is a case in point. Without analysing the social–psycho-logical dynamic between these two unequal persons, the episode ofthe youth’s illness and his dramatic cure becomes less explicable. Asa narrative solely concerning the impact of recitation, there is a lackof plausibility, and some element of magic or occultism might evenbe proposed, given Makkc’s statements. The dynamic between thecharismatic master and his would-be follower explains more fullywhat then becomes a more realistic situation.If more was known about the degree of ritual behaviour, and thesocial processes operating behind the texts, a great deal of light mightbe shed on the nature of the reactions to samAW. What is knownfrom specific writings such as Majd al-Dcn’sBawAriq, and from thediscussions above, suggests that social psychological factors wereindeed very influential. Some of the behavioural reactions can beseen to be significantly influenced by social factors. This aspect willbe further developed in Chapter 8 when considering the practice offormalsamAW rituals.Rouget’s analysis of trance and its applicabilityRouget’s discussion of samAW in his important work, Music andTrance, provides the only comprehensive psychological treatment ofthis subject to date. Based mainly on Ghazalc’s chapter in the ISyAX,Rouget argues for a fundamental distinction between ‘ritualised’"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 2)148and ‘non-ritualised’ crisis or trance.6 This distinction is based onwhether an ecstatic reaction occurs inside or outside the context ofsamAW concerts as formalised or approved within Islam. Non-ritualtrance can be dangerous, perhaps leading to madness or even death,and can occur even within samAW when the resulting reaction fails toconform to the ritual. samAW can trigger an ecstatic reaction whichmay be ‘expected’ in ritual, such as dance, or ‘unexpected’, leadingto a crisis or fit which can be dangerous for the subject.In essence, Rouget argues for a culturally sanctioned definitionof trance or ecstatic reaction, that those reactions occurring withinculturally approved conditions are acceptable, and those outside aresomehow a ‘crisis’ condition. This appears little more than a circulardefinition, simply accepting mainstream religious prescriptions forthose activities deemed acceptable or not, in this case relying mostlyon Ghazalc’s arguments. Such an approach simply codifies the main-stream position, and adds little further insight to the analysis. More-over, there is no actual psychological explanation offered, rather acultural or sociological one based on religious criteria.What is lacking, however, is the inability of such a theory toaccount for the phenomenological evidence. The textual materialdetailed in Chapter 4 cannot be neatly divided into ‘ritual’ settingswith acceptable or benign outcomes, and ‘non-ritual’ situations withcrisis outcomes. Rouget does admit that some ritual trances can leadto unexpected crises, an admission which tends to undermine hisbasic position. All the indications are that trance is often more thanjust a cultural phenomenon. If all the ‘correct’, culturally sanctionedconditions can cause unexpected crisis outcomes, this suggests thattrance is more complex, more powerful and more unpredictable thana ritually conformable activity.One example among many is Shiblc’s episode in the mosque dur-ing the month of Ramadan. The cultic and ritual setting could notbe more obvious, yet the experience of Shiblc was so overwhelmingto himself and those around him that the narrator thought Shiblcmust have died. There is certainly more in question here than simplythe performance of a ritual activity. A much larger phenomenon istaking place which only sometimes conforms to cultic requirements.The source writings which have been considered suggest that aswell as ritual situations where ‘crisis’ outcomes are witnessed, thereare many non-ritual settings for samAW where benign outcomes occur.It would seem that the distinction between these two sorts of out-comes is not based on their ritual or non-ritual setting."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW (PART 2)149It is the argument of the present study that reactions to samAW aremultifaceted, and do not conform to single, overall explanations.The view of Rouget, dividing samAW into either ritual or non-ritual,cannot be said to provide an adequate description or explanation ofthe phenomena.Notes1 Gilbert Rouget, Music and Trance: A Theory of the Relations betweenMusic and Possession, Chicago, IL and London: University of ChicagoPress, 1985, pp.299 –300.2 Ibid., pp.300 –1.3 See Donald A.

There havebeen only occasional attempts to enquire into the understandingshown by the source writers themselves.One should always be mindful that these texts were written forcontemporary communities of scholars and students, not for thetwenty-first century reader. The writings made sense within theirown situation, and they do not need later generations to supplyadequate interpretations.It is thus important to ask how these early writers viewed thenature and psychology of samAW. How was this phenomenon inte-grated into the Islamic world-view of the time, and does theirpsychological understanding hold its value today?The view of SarrajAs all later writers depend on the foundational work of Sarraj, It isbest to detail his views at the outset, and use this as a basis forapproaching his successors.There is no one chapter of Sarraj’s work which deals specificallywith the nature of samAW in its psychological dimension. There are,however, several isolated sections of the work which, when takentogether, form a cohesive view on the subject.The second chapter of the KitAb al-SamAW details the opinions ofvarious Sufis on samAW. Sarraj here mentions the famous statementof Dhexl-Nen that samAW involves warCd, the ‘visitation’ or ‘arrival’of Truth which arouses hearts toward the Truth (LumaW 271.8 –10).This statement is quoted by all the later authorities, which attests toits importance. It indicates the revelatory or inspirational nature of"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW151samAW; it is a gift or grace from above, from the realm of divinetruths, which arouses human hearts to respond to that divine truth.These two aspects are present in Dhexl-Nen’s statement: the divinegift which ‘arrives’, and the human response this inspires. The state-ment continues by asserting that differing responses produce oppos-ing outcomes: ‘One who listens to it in truth is confirmed (in thattruth), while one who listens to it sensually becomes an unbeliever.’Sarraj further emphasises the subtlety and sensitivity of samAW asa mystical grace or gift. He mentions the view of some unnamedSufis who believe samAW to be ‘a sweet nourishment for the spirits ofthose who are aware (ahl al-maWrifa)’, being finer and more subtlethan all other actions of the psyche. ‘It is perceived by one who hasa sensitive nature, because of its sensitivity, and by the pure of heartamong those who appreciate it, because of its purity and grace’(LumaW 271.14 – 6). This characterisation refers to more than theaesthetic or poetic qualities of samAW; it relates rather to the subtletyof its nature as a divine gift. As such it is easily ignored or unappre-ciated by the interference of grosser human qualities in the psyche,or by failure to listen deeply and quietly enough.This theme is continued in a quotation from Abewl-musayn al-Darraj, where the aesthetic beauty of samAW and its subtlety as agift of grace is mentioned. Darraj expresses this in metaphoricallanguage: ‘Attentive listening occupied my mind in a beautiful openfield, and it made me discover the existence of the Truth as a gift.Then it gave me drink from the cup of purity, and by its means Iunderstood the abodes of contentment, and it brought me intopleasant and spacious meadows’ (LumaW 271.17– 9). The fields andmeadows here are surely expressions of the expansion (basU) of hisstate of mind, such being common metaphors among mystics fortheir enhanced and expanded perception of reality.1 Despite ques-tions of the extent of metaphor in Darraj’s language, it is clear thatfor him samAW was a divine gift revealing knowledge, truth and theexperience of grace and well-being. The notion of samAw as an inspira-tion of subtle character is again emphasised in a later chapter ofSarraj’s work, this time as the view of the author himself. He statesplainly that ‘all people of a spiritual disposition (dhC rES) find abeautiful voice pleasing because it has qualities of the divine spirit,and it heralds the recollection of this spirit’ (LumaW 278.9 –10). Fur-thermore, ‘one who listens in a state of awareness reflects deeplywhile listening in order that spiritual significance might accrue fromrecollection’ (ibid. 10 –1). The author then lists a lengthy series ofthemes for such recollection, at the end of which he introduces"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW152a new metaphor of a firelighter striking flames in the heart. Thepure state of recollection or listening causes an action in the heartcomparable to a firelighter, the flames or sparks of which result intransformation, agitation and movement in the limbs and body.Depending on the force of this action, conscious control over bodilyactions is relinquished, and were it not for divine mercy, all reasonand sanity would be lost (LumaW 278.19 – 279.5).In this short description, Sarraj provides a summary analysis of thenature and effect of samAW. It is a subtle and spiritual phenomenonattained only in certain moments of pure recollection or heightenedawareness, and then only as a grace. Yet its action as a spiritualenlightener may be quite overwhelming and result in the profoundphysical and psychological effects detailed elsewhere. This is thenearest the author comes to outlining a description of how samAWoperates.There is also a correlation here with notions advanced by thefourth/tenth century philosophical group, the Brethren of Purity(IkhwAn al-ZafAX), in their encyclopaedic RasAXil(Treatise).In thechapter dealing with ‘The Aphorisms of Philosophers on Music’,the authors of the RasAXil write: ‘Music has an eminent quality thatlanguage is incapable of rendering manifest or of expressing by theintermediacy of articulate words; it is for this reason that the soulexpresses itself in the form of harmonious melodies. Now, when ourhuman nature hears these melodies, it is inspired with delight, rejoic-ing and happiness. Listen then to the discourse of the soul and itsconfidential conversations, repulse nature, do not regard its splen-dours and do not let yourself be seduced by it.’2A further element in Sarraj’s view of what constitutes samAW isintroduced in a later chapter of his work (LumaW 295ff ). This elementmight be termed a ‘sympathetic resonance’ between the perceptionsassociated with samAW and the pre-existing state of the listener’s heart.When the latter is receptive, in a state of pure recollection, there isa correspondence or resonance with the perceptions encountered insamAW: ‘The object in all their listening is that their hearts encountersomething similar to what is (already) in them by way of strongemotions and recollections. The emotion (wajd) is strong when itencounters its like’ (LumaW 296.9–11). Thus the arrival of the spiritualsense of samAW is anchored in the degree of reception and prepared-ness of a person’s psyche. There develops a sympathetic resonancewhereby the effect is amplified if there is a similarity between the two,or else nullified if there is not. Sarraj also emphasises that ‘listening’is not practised for aesthetic reasons, as the previous discussion on"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW153its aesthetic qualities may have indicated. Rather it is practised forits spiritual benefits, notably the reflection and magnification of itstranscendent meanings in the hearts of adepts: ‘So when they hearsomething that corresponds to their momentary experience (waqt),it intensifies the hidden aspects of their inmost hearts (mukmanAtsarAXirihim)’ (LumaW 296.15 – 6).These passages from Sarraj’s work form the basis for under-standing his view of samAW, its nature, function and psychologicalmechanism.By nature it is transcendent, inspirational, a gift or grace whichreveals divine truths. It is a subtle and sensitive phenomenon, notsimply in an aesthetic way, but in its spiritual qualities disclosedduring recollection and attentive listening.Functionally, the metaphor of the firelighter in the heart is usedto describe its action. This can lead to ‘sparks’ or ‘flames’ whichenlighten spiritually; these ‘sparks’ may also have physical–psycho-logical effects, causing the unusual behaviours and reactions detailedelsewhere in Sarraj’s work.One of the main mechanisms involved in this is a ‘sympatheticresonance’ between the revelations of samAW and the receptive stateof the listener’s heart. The spiritual benefits, and the unusual beha-viours evoked, depend on the resonance of transcendent meaningsin the hearts of listeners.It hardly needs stating that this notion of samAW is only under-standable within the theological and intellectual context of an Islamicworld-view. The discussion in terms of grace, revelation, divine gift,seeking the Truth, and so on, can only be given meaning within anoverall theology of Sufism. Similarly, the concept of the ‘heart’ andits preparedness, recollection, responsiveness, and so on, only makesense as part of a Sufi psychology.What is of note in this context is the degree of assimilation andaccommodation of these notions within an overall Islamic, and spe-cifically Sufi world-view. There is a remarkable integration of thesediverse and unfamiliar concepts, with the unusual behaviours theyattempt to explain, within the prevailing intellectual and social con-ditions of the time. This is one way at least where there is a betterunderstanding of these notions within Islamic society of the medievalperiod, compared to the medical and pathological preoccupationof contemporary Western society. It was noted in Chapter 4 thatthe Sufi approach tended to normalise and assimilate these diverseelements into everyday life and current theological frameworks.The modern Western medical view, despite its sophistication, has"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW154difficulty coming to terms with these phenomena. Though there aresome recent signs of change, the designations ‘abnormal’ and ‘patho-logical’ are still often applied.Part of this unfortunate contrast lies in the emphasis on theparticular type of rationality characteristic of Western science andpsychology generally.3 This rationality considers everyday, wakingconsciousness to be an objective normality, with all other types ofconsciousness deemed inferior, abnormal or non-rational. Part ofthe importance of Sufism within Islam is that it allows so-called‘altered states’ to be seen not only as possible in ordinary, everydaylife, but as a valued type of experience. The ability to understanddirectly, intimately and experientially (the term for this being dhauq,literally ‘taste’) is valued more highly in religious understandingthan the more familiar ‘rational’ approach to knowledge.The view of GhazalcNeither Qushayrc nor Sulamc make a contribution to this topic; inQushayrc’s case there is no special mention of the subject, and hisadoption of much of his material from Sarraj means that he prob-ably shared similar views to the earlier author. With Sulamc, hisgenre of SadCth-style biographies leaves little opportunity for con-ceptual discussions. With Ghazalc, on the other hand, there is everyopportunity for discussion of this topic and a genuine developmentof the concept of samAW.At the beginning of the chapter on samAW, Ghazalc presents arather poetic summary of his conception of the subject: ‘Hearts andtheir inner chambers are treasuries of secrets and mines of jewels.Jewels are contained in them like fire is contained in iron and stone,concealed like water beneath earth and soil. There is no way toextract their secrets except by the firelighter of listening to music andverse, and there is no entrance to hearts except by the anteroom ofthe ears. Music which is measured and pleasing brings out what isin them (i.e. hearts), and makes evident their beauties and faults.When the heart is moved, there is made evident only what it con-tains, just as a vessel drips only what is in it. Thus listening to musicand verse is for the heart a true touchstone and an eloquent stand-ard. When the soul of music and verse reaches the heart, it stirsonly what predominates in the heart’ (ISyAX II.266.16 –21).There are some similarities here with the view of Sarraj outlinedabove. First, the metaphor of fire in the heart, and the firelighter, isreminiscent of Sarraj’s description. Ghazalc extends this metaphor,"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW155based on metallurgy or mineralogy, to the notion of the heart’s‘secrets’ being precious jewels hidden deep beneath the earth’s sur-face. These precious gems may be struck with the ‘flint’ of samAW toproduce sparks and disclose their hidden treasure.Second, the notion of ‘resonance’ outlined by Sarraj and elsewhereadopted by Ghazalc is transformed somewhat. Continuing with themetaphor of the heart as a hidden treasure, it is only what is alreadycontained or hidden within the heart that is brought to light oreduced by samAW. As described by the author, this ‘bringing out’ isseen as a one-way process, evoked by the action of music and verse.It must be assumed, however, that the action is more sympatheticthan Ghazalc allows, that the similarity between the heart’s treasuresand the spiritual nature of the music and verse provides a powerfulevocative factor.R.A. Nicholson writes of one permutation of this concept: ‘Thosewhose hearts He has opened and endowed with spiritual perceptionhear His voice everywhere, and ecstasy overcomes them as theylisten to the rhythmic chant of the muezzin, or the street cry of thesaqqaw.4 Nicholson also mentions a further aspect of this: ‘Pythagorasand Plato are responsible for another theory, to which the Sefcpoets frequently allude, that music awakens in the soul a memoryof celestial harmonies heard in a state of pre-existence, before thesoul was separated from God’.5 This elaboration of the soul andcelestial harmonies is probably more at home in the Persian Sufitradition and in the theosophy of Ibn al-wArabc than in the moresober writings of Ghazalc. Yet the basis for such an interpretation ispresent in our author’s statement above. Ghazalc certainly believesthat the heart contains ‘jewels’ evoked by listening to music, andthese jewels could only have been implanted there by divine fiatduring pre-existence. There is also a sense in which the notion ofresonance, or the memory of spiritual harmonies is operative here.This idea is given explicit statement in Qushayrc’sRisAla in a quotefrom Junayd that in the covenant of Alast, ‘the sweetness of listeningto spiritual words was poured forth so that when (humankind) heardsamAW, the remembrance of this was moved in them’ (Ris. 340).In contrast to Sarraj, then, Ghazalc minimises the importance ofrevelation in samAW; there is less of a sense of direct interventionfrom the divine realm. It is rather only what the heart contains thatis educed by listening, and presumably the heart has contained thesespiritual treasures from the time of its pre-existence.The notions expressed in the first quote from Nicholson abovealso apply to a further discussion of the action of samAW by Ghazalc."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW156The author at one point speaks of the ‘lover’ of God who is soenthralled that he sees Him in all things, and hears all things fromHim and in Him. The passion of love is described as acting like ‘aninflamer of the tinder box of the heart’, another use of the metaphorof fire. This igniting causes states (aSwAl) of rapture and ecstasy(wajd), burning and purifying the heart and allowing ‘visions andrevelations’ (mushAhadAt wa-mukAshafAt) to follow. Ghazalc declaresthat such states are the ultimate goal of all lovers of God, their causebeing a mystery (sirr) of God, and among the subtlest of the sci-ences of revelation (ISyAX II.277.16 –25; Mcd. pp.229 –30).The author goes on to discuss the love of beautiful things, butunfortunately does not elaborate on the nature of samAW in relationto what he has just outlined. He rather blocks off this discussion bydeclaring the mechanism and effect of listening to music as one ofGod’s mysteries, and thus not open to human explanation. Fromwhat he does state, however, it seems that a similar mechanism tothat envisaged by Sarraj is assumed. Thus we may suppose thatthe flames or sparks which produce the ‘states’ mentioned abovemay also cause the physical–psychological effects with which we areconcerned.This is stated more explicitly, though briefly, in a later section ofthe chapter: ‘Know that the first stage in samAW is understandingwhat is heard and its application to a meaning which occurs to thehearer; then this understanding results in ecstasy (wajd), and thisresults in movements of the limbs’ (ISyAX II.285.1–2; Mcd. p.705).As for the mechanism of samAW, there is very little specificallystated by the author, but on occasion there is some reference to the‘sympathetic resonance’ concept found earlier in Sarraj’s writings.One example occurs in Ghazalc’s comment on the narrative of thebeggar who heard the slave girl singing in her master’s house besidethe Tigris river. The author explains the action of the singing asreinforcing or coinciding with his mental state. He heard the girl’ssong as if it were a message from God because of his preoccupationwith an internal spiritual struggle. This is one way in which there is‘resonance’ between the content of what is heard and the listener’sheart.The main difference between the views of Sarraj and Ghazalc seemsto lie in the differing emphasis on the nature and qualities of theheart. For Ghazalc, the heart is described as a ‘mine of jewels’,presumably deposited in its pre-existence, with its treasures broughtto light by ‘listening’. With Sarraj, there is more emphasis on the"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW157action of samAW as a divine grace or revelation, arousing the heartonly as much as the latter is prepared and capable of reflecting orresonating. For Ghazalc, there is revelation from within, from thetreasure already contained in the heart, rather than directly fromabove.The later Persian authors considered in this study do not addfurther to this understanding of the psychology of samAW. Hujwcrcdoes not address the issue in his writing, while wAuuar with his adop-tion of a biographical genre leaves no opportunity for conceptualdiscussion of this type.The value of these psychological viewsThe first means by which these ideas have value is in their integrat-ing the unusual phenomena associated with samAW into the prevailingculture and world-view of the time. It has been noted above thatthis integration is one of the more remarkable features of this aspectof Sufi thought. Despite the witnessing of bizarre and dramaticbehaviours, there is a sense of their ‘expectedness’ and explicabilitywithin Sufi theology and current intellectual terms. This is an exampleof the inclusiveness of the culture of Islam in these centuries, so thatalmost no aspect of behaviour was considered outside its realmsimply because of some unusual features. This contrasts with cer-tain streams of contemporary Western psychology where there is atendency for ‘classifying more and more of human behaviour as adisorder which needs treatment’.6Related to this, and again in contrast to Western thought, is thenotion that different states of consciousness are legitimate andquite natural. Everyday waking consciousness is not seen as neces-sarily prescriptive, with all other modes somehow abnormal. Thislegitimisation of differing states allows for the experiences gainedin dreams or a range of altered states to be valuable when com-pared with those of ‘rational’ states. This is a further way in whichthe approach of early Sufi psychology is instructive for Westernsciences.As for the explanations of the Sufi writers discussed here, it istrue that their psychology forms part of a more inclusive science ofmystical theology. It is difficult to accept the explanations offeredwithout also accepting the assumptions underlying Sufi theology.Their psychology does not stand alone but is part of a larger frame-work of doctrines and beliefs. This is understandable from anyobjective view of the subject, yet it means that the applicability of"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SAMFW158the various insights arising from their psychology of samAW remainslimited.Given this caveat, the explanations of Sarraj and Ghazalc aresufficiently inclusive to provide a fairly thorough contemporarydescription of the Sufi psychology relating to samAW. There is somelack of detail as to the mechanism causing the unusual behaviours,but the overall description is clear and succinct, and is a valuablecontribution to the field of Sufi psychology.Notes1 See, for example, al-Bisuamc’s use of such metaphor in his mystical‘journey’ recorded in LumaW 384.12ff; and Michael A.

Observable behavioural reac-tions do not exhaust the possibilities which the source materialsoffer. The question remains: is it possible to approach more closelythe experiences recorded by the Sufi authors, or to understand morefully the nature of the special awareness and altered states whichtheir subjects encountered?One of the few means by which the texts allow us to approachmore closely to such an understanding is through the words utteredby the Sufis under the influence of samAW or after its occurrence. Theconcern here is not so much with the ‘ecstatic’ expressions whichthey may have uttered, as these have been analysed in Chapter 4.Rather it is the ordinary sayings and expressions by which theysought to explain their behaviour or describe the experiences theyencountered, as far as words would allow them.In the introductions to the chapters on psychology and semanticsit was argued that mystical experiences are largely ineffable, andthat it was clearly difficult to understand their nature. It is not neces-sary, however, to go to the point of agnosticism, as Gerald Brenandoes in his study of the writings of St John of the Cross. St John’spoems were written to express his mystical experiences; it follows,argues Brenan, ‘since we cannot form for ourselves any notion ofthese, that they are obscure. We shall not be able to go so far as tomeet them with our own experience as we can in the case of mostother poetry.’1 It does not follow simply because mystical experi-ences are being spoken or written about per se that others can haveno understanding of them. This understanding may not be com-plete or adequate, but some partial knowledge of them is availableto those prepared to search and empathise with mystical experience."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS160Indeed, the failure of those interested in mysticism ever to graspthe ideas of the mystics would mean that the voluminous writingsof the latter would all have been in vain. It is surely paradoxical thatdespite the ineffability of mystical experiences, mystics have alwaysbeen the most vocal of religious authors, always ready to attemptan explanation of their personal encounters. In Islam there is con-firmation of this general rule, as the examples of Ibn al-wArabc andRemc illustrate. With Remc it is ironic that in his lyric poetry he isalways enjoining the reader to ‘silence!’. This comes strangely fromthe author of the famed MathnawC, a work of some 25,700 couplets,as well as a collection of lyric poetry which runs to nine volumes!If mystics have never been reluctant to broadcast their opinionsor to describe their experiences, it is surely worth the effort to con-sider what they have to say. The understanding of the non-mysticmay be only partial and limited, but some appreciation is surelyachievable and desirable.With these observations in mind, the following attempt is madeto glean from the texts what the Sufis had to say for themselvesabout their experiences. In the early documents studied here, thereare no extensive speeches, lengthy arguments or accounts. There aresimply a number of short and scattered statements recorded alongwith the descriptions of unusual behaviours. In these short state-ments, the Sufis who encountered samAW attempted to describe orexplain their encounters briefly, either directly, or by more crypticutterances.As with the psychological material, the richest source work isSarraj’sKitAb al-LumaW. Sarraj’s style of including numerous narrat-ives with editorial comment means that there are many colourful,personal and idiosyncratic vignettes of great value to the modernreader. The character of the other sources, for example the philo-sophical tone of Ghazalc, or the SadCth-style of Sulamc, makes theirworks less likely to contain suitable material.It is convenient to divide these sayings into four distinct cat-egories, though a few sayings are not easily classifiable, and may fitinto more than one category.Plain descriptionThis first category contains sayings that are plainly descriptive. Theyare usually fairly straightforward accounts of feelings, moods orstates, in simple language, and without the use of poetry, metaphoror deliberately cryptic speech. The purpose of these statements is"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS161to inform precisely and in a matter of fact way about the experi-ence encountered, without any attempt at embellishment or lyricexpression.The first example in this category involves Shiblc being ques-tioned by AbewAlc al-Maghazalc (d.?) about the effect of hearingthe Qurxan. He is concerned that this listening ‘warns me to abandonmaterial things and to shun the world; then I return to my usual stateof consciousness, and to people’s company, and nothing remains ofthis (warning), and I am propelled back to my earlier state.’ Shiblcreplies by reassuring Maghazalc that being attracted to God bywhat he hears from the Qurxan is good, and an act of grace; similarlyhis being propelled back to his normal state is also an act of grace,because of the intensity and force (al-Saul wa-Xl-qEwa) required toface that altered state. This episode is recorded in three of the sources,LumaW, RisAla, and ISyAX, with a few minor textual differences in thelater works.2The narrative describes in plain terms Maghazalc’s experienceof being turned away from ordinary, worldly concerns toward thedivine and transcendent, by means of hearing the Qurxan recited.This involves an altered state of some kind, since he describes thedifference in affect toward everyday concerns, and his being ‘pro-pelled back’ to ordinary consciousness. This is also a descriptionof a religious or transcendent experience similar to a typical ‘con-version’ encounter. Though Maghazalc’s account is only short, it isin essence reminiscent of the similar crisis described by Ghazalc inhis autobiographical work, al-Munqidh min al-KalAl(The Delivererfrom Error). Ghazalc writes in detail about being tossed back andforward between the impulse to abandon his career and family inBaghdad to become an ascetic searching for truth, and the impulseto remain with his career and try to ignore his intellectual doubtsand insincerities. This struggle is portrayed as a spiritual conflict ofreal importance, between the urgings of wealth, position and com-forts of this world, and the promptings of the need for salvation inthe world to come.3It seems that similar conflicts and urgings are apparent inMaghazalc’s situation as with Ghazalc’s, though perhaps not to thesame degree. Maghazalc is concerned about his wavering states ofmind, the strength of the prompting to abandon worldly concerns,and the ease with which his mind returns to its ordinary state. Thisconcern is addressed by Shiblc’s encouraging remarks by which heattempts to reassure Maghazalc that both his altered state and hisreturn are acts of divine grace."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS162The second example in this category presents some similarities withthe foregoing. Sarraj relates of Abe Sulayman al-Daranc (d.215/830) that he complained of becoming transfixed on a particularverse of the Qurxan during his reading of it. This could last up tofive nights, he states; unless he stops contemplating the verse he isunable to continue reading. Moreover, sometimes when reading theQurxan he says that his reasoning faculty (Waql) ‘flies away’ and itrequires a ‘restrainer’ (sajjAn) to return it (LumaW 282.5 – 8).This is a straightforward description of his situation, though somemetaphor is used in the reference to his reason ‘flying away’, andthe ‘restrainer’, or literally, ‘warder, gaoler’. His description of beingunable to proceed in his reading, of being transfixed to a particularverse, suggests almost an automatism similar to those discussed inChapter 4. There it was seen that the continuous repetition of aphrase or other involuntary repetitive actions could be the result ofan altered state or dissociative reaction. It appears that a similarprocess is operating in this present case, where the reader becomesquite ‘hypnotised’ by the verse being read and is immovable from it.The operation of an altered state is also apparent in his descriptionof the perceived loss of his reasoning faculty, characterised dramat-ically as its ‘flight’. This expression is Daranc’s way of describing itssudden departure, with the sudden arrival of the altered state.The reference to the ‘restrainer’ may allude to a higher intellec-tual faculty within his own mind, or even some transcendent facultyof reason. The mention of the need for a ‘restrainer’ to return thereasoning faculty to its normal state suggests that Daranc is awareof the possibility of its long-term loss. The arrival of the altered statemay herald danger as far as he is concerned, with the possibility ofhis mind not returning to normal.The third example in this category has already been mentioned inChapter 4. Both Sarraj and wAuuar present similar accounts of thetrance-like state witnessed of Sahl b. wAbdallah Tustarc. As a resultofsamAW, Sahl would go into a trance lasting more than three weeks;he would not eat, and would sweat profusely, even during winter. Ifhe was questioned in this state, he would reply: ‘Do not ask any-thing of me, for my words would be of no benefit to you at thistime’ (LumaW 307.4 – 8;T.A. I.255.16–20).This is a plain description of the situation as seen by Sahl; he isindicating that his ‘state’ prevents him from speaking in a properand profitable way. It was suggested in the discussion of this episodein Chapter 4 that two broad possibilities exist as to why he considered"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS163his words unsuitable. First, they may have been inarticulate or non-sensical for various reasons associated with his trance-like state.The second possibility is that his words may have been fully articul-ate but likely to be misunderstood or misconstrued as heretical orblasphemous. It is possible that Sahl was fearful of this outcomewhich was the fate of several famous Sufi figures such as mallaj andwAyn al-Quqat, both of whom were executed for alleged blasphemy.The uncertainty surrounding Sahl’s statement means that it couldalso be considered under the heading of ‘enigmatic utterances’, thethird of the four categories dealt with in the present chapter.Response to hearing verse recitedThis second category of utterance involves a spontaneous responseto hearing a verse of poetry or the Qurxan being recited. The responseis usually a short statement or sometimes an ecstatic exclamationprompted by the occasion of the verse, and responding to the mean-ing it conveys. In all the cases found in the source texts, the responseindicates that the hearer is experiencing an altered state, and in twocases the subject suddenly collapses and dies.The first example was discussed above in Chapter 4 in the sectiondealing with audible cries. Attested in four of the sources, it is thenarrative of the young beggar who happens upon a slave girl sing-ing to her wealthy master in his mansion beside the Tigris river. Thegirl recited: ‘Every day you change; other conduct than this wouldbe better for you; dedicated to God is the love freely given from meto you.’ This is according to the earliest source, Sarraj; Qushayrcand Hujwcrc reverse the line order, while Ghazalc omits the secondline. This confusion over the lines recited is also reflected in thereported response of the young beggar. According to Sarraj andGhazalc he asks the girl to repeat the verse, whereupon he responds:‘By God, you change me with the Truth when I am in a special state!’Qushayrc omits the words following: ‘Truth’, whereas Hujwcrc hasthe youth ask the girl: ‘For God’s sake chant that verse again, for Ihave only a moment to live; let me hear it and die!’ All the sourcetexts relate that the youth uttered a cry and died on the spot.4Hujwcrc’s report of the youth’s reply should probably be dis-counted, since it shows a somewhat obvious prescience. The earlieraccounts of Sarraj and Ghazalc appear more credible.If this is the case, we are left with a very brief account of theyouth’s altered state in which he believed he was being addressed bya divine source. This is not a situation of auditory hallucinations or"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS164some similar psychotic delusion. It is rather that the youth believedthe verse he heard contained a divinely inspired message which spoketo his own situation, and that the female reciter was unwittinglythe agent of a higher purpose. Thus the youth responded by para-phrasing or reinterpreting the verse to apply to his own situation.He asked the girl to repeat the verse, so as to confirm what he hadheard, and then he replied, addressing God: ‘By God, you changeme with the Truth when I am in a special state! (SAl)’ The implica-tion is that God acted upon him to ‘change’ him, presumably toalter his conduct for the better, or strengthen his belief, or the like,when he entered an altered state. The utterance may also indicatethat he was at that moment aware of being transported by an alteredstate. Whether he was aware of this or not, the ‘state’ soon envelopedhim and caused him to cry out, collapse and die.Ghazalc interprets this episode to mean that the youth was alreadyimmersed in his altered state, and was concerned at his heart’sinconstancy and changeability. His hearing the verse was thus aconfirmation and a warning from God as to the inconstancy of hisheart.A somewhat similar case presents itself as the second example inthis category. Ghazalc cites a short account of an unnamed Sufi whoheard a Qurxan verse recited: ‘O soul at peace, return to your Lord,well-pleased, well-pleasing’ (Qur.89.27). He asked the reciter to repeatthe verse, and then said: ‘How often do I say to it, “Return!” but itdoes not return!’ The man then experienced a crisis state, cried outand died (ISyAX II.294.27–295.2; Mcd. p.736). In line with Ghazalc’sargument in the preceding example, the man was obviously awareof his shortcomings, and was concerned that his soul did not obeyhis longing to ‘return’ to God. This indicates that he was already inan altered state when he heard the verse, according to Ghazalc’sreasoning in the preceding case. It also shows that the man waslonging for death, to be closer in spirit to God, and to allow hissoul to return to its source.Although this episode may be classed as a ‘response’ to hearingverse recited, there are deeper causes for the response, with theman’s pre-existing spiritual crisis. The man was known to be a Sufi,and thus likely to be regularly involved in spiritual or ascetic dis-ciplines and exercises. This may explain his pre-existing altered state,that possibly he was in a threshold state where a slight stimulus wasenough to precipitate a more intense alteration of consciousnessor a crisis situation."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS165The third example in this category is of a rather different variety,involving a more creative response by the hearer answering a poeticcouplet in like kind. Sarraj relates an account from one Abexl-masan b. Razwan (d.?) that he was walking in the gardens of Basrawith a friend when they heard a minstrel playing and reciting thefollowing verses:O beautiful faces! you do not treat us justly,all our life you have all ill-treated us;there are duties incumbent on you to fulfil,since we have been afflicted in loving you –may you treat us justly!Abexl-masan’s companion cried out and then said: ‘How would itbe if you were to say:O beautiful faces, you are destined to die,and your cheeks and eyes to waste away;afterwards you will become but an impression,so know this, that this is certain!’(LumaW 297.13 –298.1)Sarraj comments on the ingenuity of this answer to the reciter,and that the answer was made in an ecstatic or altered state. This isindicated in the account by his crying out aloud which may be asign of dissociation. Sarraj also argues that he was not perturbed bythe sensuous or shameful nature of the verse. Rather the ‘true’ senseof the verse, the reality of the corruptibility and transience of beauty‘overwhelmed him and filled him with ecstasy’, as Sarraj comments.What is remarkable is the spontaneity of the response. The alteredstate which the man experienced was evidently one of high arousalwith the ensuing ‘ecstatic’ utterance showing high levels of con-scious control and creativity. The verse couplet of the man’s answerwas expressed in the same poetic metre as the original, despite itsapparent spontaneity! Such utterance shows a highly creative re-sponse stemming from the altered state being experienced.Enigmatic utterancesThis class of responses includes statements which are not immedi-ately transparent in meaning, which are enigmatic or inscrutable insome way. The statements may be expressed cryptically, and themeaning needs to be uncovered in some way."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS166The first example of this type is recorded in Sarraj’sLumaW andQushayrc’sRisAla. One Abexl-musayn b. Zcrc (d.?), a companion ofJunayd, would sometimes be present when there was a samAW ses-sion. If he approved of what he heard, he spread out his coat andsat down, saying: ‘The poor (i.e. the Sufi) is with his heart. Wher-ever he finds his heart (or wherever his heart finds something) hesits down.’ If he did not find it pleasing, he said: ‘Listening to musicis for those with hearts’, and he would take up his shoes and depart(LumaW 272.13 –7;Ris. 341).The second of Ibn Zcrc’s sayings is more transparent than thefirst. The notion of listening being for those ‘with hearts’ meanssimply that certain people are able to appreciate and find benefit insamAW because of their capacity to appreciate music or poetry, orbecause of their spiritual receptivity and readiness for the inspira-tion caused by listening.The first of Ibn Zcrc’s sayings is more difficult. His statement thatthe poor (Sufi) is ‘with his heart’ may be a reference to the idiomexplained above, of the capability to appreciate music and poetry. Itcould also allude to the person experiencing samAW being transportedor overcome; thus he has ‘gone’ or ‘flown’ with his heart. Similarly,it could refer to the rapt listener being ‘present’ or absorbed withhis heart.The second part of this statement, ‘Wherever he finds his heart,he sits down’, may perhaps refer to the Sufi’s quest for finding gnosisor knowledge of God, the ultimate quest of the ascetic’s heart.‘Finding the heart’ may mean finding the goal of the heart’s quest,in this case the spiritual treasure discovered in samAW. When thisis reached, he is content to suspend his quest or ‘sit down’ meta-phorically, as well as actually.There are many possibilities hidden in these rather cryptic andenigmatic statements. Unfortunately there is no further guidance,by way of editorial comment, on their possible meanings. More-over, the text is itself rather ambiguous, as the alternative transla-tion offered above suggests.The second example in this category is the episode involving Shiblc’sprayer in the mosque during the month of Ramadan. This wasdiscussed above in Chapter 4, section E, concerning ecstatic utter-ances, although only the behavioural aspects of the case were dealtwith there. Three sources record that Shiblc was praying once in amosque during the month of Ramadan when a verse recited by theprayer leader caused him to cry out, change colour, and begin to"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS167tremble. He began to repeat in an automatic fashion the phrase:‘With such words do lovers converse!’5The ‘automatism’ of Shiblc’s verbal behaviour was noted in theearlier discussion; there was trance-like repetition of the same wordsover and over in an apparently unstoppable way. The actual importof his words, however, was not discussed previously. The enigmaticcharacter of Shiblc’s statement lies in its relation to the Qurxan versewhich prompted it. The verse is Qur.17.86: ‘If We willed, We couldtake away what We have revealed to you, then you would find noneto guard you against Us’. This is a verse of threatened punishment,the threat to withdraw God’s revelation and also His mercy andprotection. There is reason to suggest that verses of ‘punishment’from the Qurxan can have a dramatic effect on some hearers, caus-ing unusual behaviours such as those recorded of Shiblc here. Thismay have partly caused the reactions noted here, but also the priva-tions of food and other ascetic disciplines associated with Ramadancould well have been partly responsible.What is noteworthy, however, is that hearing this verse of direpunishment elicited a saying from Shiblc which spoke of ‘the con-verse of lovers’, a seemingly incongruous response. The explanationlies partly in the well-attested notion of the Sufi’s relation with Godbeing that of lover and Beloved, as often expressed in poetry. Thoughfor many this may have been only a metaphorical description, forothers, among whom Shiblc must be counted, it was a more literalreality. Thus hearing this verse of punishment could be interpretedas the Beloved withholding His favours and graces, and leaving thelover in a distraught and helpless condition, a well-known motif inSufi poetry.Shiblc’s obvious distress, therefore, could be seen in this light,and his statement then becomes more understandable. His appre-hension of being denied intimacy with his Beloved leads to a reactionof fear, as indicated by his trembling, changing colour, and so on. Italso leads him to state that such is the converse of lovers, where the‘capricious’ Beloved can withdraw favours at any time, thus leavingthe lover alone and distraught. Moreover, it can be considered aspecial grace from the Beloved and a sign of favourable treatmentthat the lover is so poorly dealt with and discriminated against.Peter Awn, for example, writes of this ‘gift’ in relation to Iblcs; butit is not restricted to unbelievers and enemies of God: ‘It is open tothose Sufis whose perfection of life allows them to cope with theparadoxical truth that God’s curse, especially the curse of separa-tion, is the ultimate goal of the mystical life.’6"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS168What should not be overlooked in all these examples of theQurxan’s intense impact is that the Holy Book was a continuallyintoxicating experience for these spiritual athletes. Louis Massignonreminds us that the Book was ‘a rudiment of worship capable ofuniting man to God: a psalmody: the recitation of the Qurxan itself ’.7A third example in this category of enigmatic statements concerns acertain Jawfar al-Mubarqaw (d.?) who was once moved to ecstasyunder the influence of samAW. He arose and stated: ‘We are finishedwith disciples!’ (LumaW 287.11–12.)Sarraj goes on to argue that disciples ought not to be presentduringsamAW until they have acquired certain attributes, knowledgeand renunciation of desires. It may be that Jawfar was alluding tothis in his wish to exclude disciples from his presence, particularlyduringsamAW. Yet this is only a partly satisfactory explanation ofhis enigmatic statement which could have other possible references.Jawfar may, for example, have been declaring his own renunciationof social companions and disciples, and his desire to retire from theworld into a secluded life where he could cultivate meditative states.Other alternatives are possible, making this statement of Jawfar’srather ambiguous and cryptic.Another similar example also comes from Sarraj, concerning a cer-tainwAlc b. al-Muwaffaq (d.265/878 –9). At a samAW session he ‘heardsomething’ which made him say to those around him: ‘Lift me up!’When they did so, he went into rapture and uttered ecstatically: ‘Iam the dancing shaykh!’ (LumaW 290.17–291.2.)Sarraj offers an explanation which is partly satisfactory, thatMuwaffaq made this statement in order to conceal the real natureof his altered state. His reference to himself as the ‘dancing shaykh’was meant to indicate that he had attained the state of ‘beginnersand disciples’, according to Sarraj, rather than his actual, higherstate of ‘intoxication and being absent’. This concealment was carriedout due to his ‘good manners’, as presumably he did not wish toboast of his attainments.Sarraj’s explanation is adequate as far as it goes, but it can onlybe regarded as one explanation among other possibilities. The state-ment ‘I am the dancing shaykh’ was uttered while those aroundMuwaffaq lifted him up in their arms. This may have referred to hisperception of ‘dancing’ occasioned by being moved away fromground level. In his altered state he may have imagined himself asdancing while he was swaying in the arms of his companions."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS169An episode recorded in two and partly in a third source concernsSahl b. wAbdallah Tustarc. According to a long-time servant of his,Sahl rarely showed any emotion or ecstasy during samAW, but onone occasion he heard the Qurxan verse (57.15) ‘Therefore today noransom shall be taken from you.’ Sahl began to tremble and was onthe point of falling down; when asked about this he replied: ‘Yes,my friend, we have indeed become weak.’ On another occasion asimilar event took place with the verse ‘The Kingdom that day,the true Kingdom, shall belong to the All-merciful’ (Qur.25.28). InSarraj and Ghazalc’s account, Sahl offers an explanation for hisstatement about becoming weak. He is asked: ‘Do you mean that(the state) changes you and you tremble, and what is it that meansstrength of state?’ Sahl replied: ‘(The latter is) that no conditionwhich comes upon one (wArid) should arrive without its being assim-ilated by strength of state, and these conditions should not changeone even though they are strong.’8The obscurity of these statements is evident, though they allseem to hinge on the notion of ‘strength of state’ (qEwat al-SAl). Theessence of both Sahl’s replies is that by strength of will, or greatpresence of mind, one’s composure is able to be maintained duringthe onset of an altered state. Such appears to be the meaning ofqEwat al-SAl in this context. By maintaining that he has becomeweak, Sahl is referring to the failure of his presence of mind andmental strength to prevent outward signs of an altered state. Simi-larly, in his ‘explanation’ of this term, Sahl argues that one shouldassimilate (literally ‘swallow’) the onset of an altered state, and thatit should not be allowed to ‘change’ one’s outward composure,despite its strength.As with the earlier example concerning Shiblc in the mosque,it is to be noted that the verses which prompted the reactionfrom Sahl were ones of threatened punishment referring to the dayof judgement. It was seen in the discussions on psychology thatsuch verses elicited unusually intense responses, anxiety or fear reac-tions. This may help explain the irregular nature of this particularepisode.A final example in this category of enigmatic responses again con-cerns Shiblc; it is recorded only in Qushayrc’sRisAla. Once at asamAW session, Shiblc‘cried out’ and went into ecstasies while remain-ing seated. His unusual behaviour of not rising caused those nearbyto question him about this. Shiblc arose in ecstasy and replied witha verse couplet:"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS170For me there are two types of intoxication,for my companions there is only one;what is something very special for me,is only one for others.(Ris. 349)Shiblc’s reply appears somewhat conceited and condescending tohis companions; he claims to have a superior state of consciousness,poetically called ‘intoxication’, of which he experiences two types tothe others’ one. This ‘special’ experience of his seems to explain hisfailure to arise in ecstasy as usual etiquette would assume. Suchapparent lack of regard on his part is in keeping with what is knownof Shiblc’s personality. He is characterised in wAuuar’sTadhkirat, forinstance, as independent-minded, quite anti-social, and unheedingof the opinions of others.9Visions of paradiseThis category of responses is clearly the most ecstatic and effusiveof the statements uttered by the Sufis. At the other end of the scalefrom plain descriptive utterances, this last category opens a windowto a vision of paradise, of bliss and contentment. Such statementsare rare in the prose literature of Sufism, though not in the poeticliterature, where visions of wine-drinking, intimacy with a beloved,and Eden-like descriptions of nature are often found. The reason forthis difference may be simply the separation of genres and a deemedpropriety of occasion for speaking of such things. Often enough themore ecstatic of the Sufis are quoted as having recited verses ofsecular and love poetry filled with descriptions of the lover’s bliss ordistress. This is different, however, from actually describing a sceneof paradise whilst undergoing an altered state experience.The two examples of this category found in the sources bothresult from samAW in the sense of having heard sounds or verse whichinspire heavenly visions of bliss and contentment, as part of theexperience of an altered state.The first example occurs in the KitAb al-LumaW, where Abexl-musayn al-Darraj describes the effects of samAW on his conscious-ness. Darraj was reported to have said: ‘Listening occupied my mindin a beautiful open field, and it made me discover the existence ofthe Truth as a gift. Then it gave me drink from the cup of purity, andby its means I understood the abodes of contentment, and it broughtme into pleasant and spacious meadows’ (LumaW 271.17–19.)"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS171Such a description is clearly a blissful and celestial vision occa-sioned by a particular type of ‘listening’ which is unfortunately notspecified. Whether Darraj was actually in a ‘beautiful open field’, asmight be assumed from his opening remarks, is not clear; it mayrather be a metaphor of the ‘expansiveness’ (basU) of his experience,as mentioned at the end of his utterance. In fact this is a commonmetaphor in use among Sufis and mystics when describing expan-sive feelings.10His vision of bliss also has an ‘intellectual’ or knowledge com-ponent, his discovery of the existence of ‘the Truth’, a common goalof the mystic’s quest given as a grace during moments of heightenedconsciousness. The drink from the ‘cup of purity’ alludes to heavenlyexperience, as referred to in the Qurxan’s visions of paradise(Qur.37.45 –7; 78.34; etc.). Similarly the experience of contentmentand spacious meadows is also ultimately derived from the numer-ous allusions to paradise in the Qurxan.The second example of this type comes from Hujwcrc’sKashf al-MaSjEb. He relates that Ibrahcm Khawwaz, who was famous for hislong journeys into the desert, was once travelling in a mountainregion with a companion. The companion was seized by a thrill ofemotion (UarabC) and began to recite some love poetry. Ibrahcmasked him to repeat the verses, which he did, and the companionobserved that with ‘affected ecstasy’ (tawAjud) he began to danceand his feet seemed to sink into the stony ground as though it werewax. Then Ibrahcm fell into a swoon, and when he returned toconsciousness he said: ‘I was in the garden of paradise, and you didnot see!’ (Kashf 534.15–535.4; Nich. p.410.)The ecstasy which overcame Ibrahcm allowed him a vision ofparadise, the content of which is not described. The reference to the‘garden’ (rauQa), however, suggests that vernal and natural imagerymay have played a role, and it is likely that the images of his experi-ence were derived from Qurxanic references to paradise.The utterances described in the four categories above help to shedsome light on the nature of the experiences which overtook theindividuals affected. There is no underlying pattern to these utter-ances, ranging as they do from plain, matter-of-fact statements tovisions of paradise. What this variety of expressions does provide isa survey of the range of experiences which result from altered states.The lack of an underlying pattern or unifying theme throughoutthese descriptions serves to highlight the contention of this study"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS172that no single mechanism or process is operative in all these cases.The variety of utterances with which the subjects responded showsthat different types of states and experiences are being manifested.The only possible exception to this general rule is the sense ofa ‘retreat’ or ‘flight’ from the world of reality to a world within orbeyond, created or prompted by the altered state. It is possible toargue that in some of the responses this underlying theme or principleis involved.Thus for AbewAlc al-Maghazalc, his state caused him to turnaway from worldly concerns and to retreat from social encounter;then he made a gradual return to his usual way of interacting, witha gradual decline in his concern for renunciation. A somewhat sim-ilar situation occurred with Abe Sulayman al-Daranc, who becamesuddenly transfixed as if hypnotised, retreating from reality withthe sense that his reason had suddenly flown away. With SahlTustarc, his trance-like state meant that he was unable to communic-ate effectively, as he replied to his questioners that no profit couldbe derived from what he had to say.As only these three examples, all from the category of ‘plain’description, have this theme of retreat in common, there is prob-ably insufficient evidence for an underlying principle involved.This theme of retreat is not unexpected, however, since the wholenotion of dissociation or altered state means a transfer into a differ-ent type of consciousness which must necessarily appear as a retreator journey away from the ordinary world.By way of contrast, the ‘enigmatic’ utterances are as diverse asmight be expected from this category where the sole unifying featureis the inscrutability of the statements uttered. Similarly, the ‘visionsof paradise’ are rather different from each other, the only possiblepoint of contact being the natural imagery used, though this is onlyhypothetical in the case of Ibrahcm Khawwaz.It must be concluded, then, that there is an overall diversity inthese reported responses, and little in the way of unifying factors orthemes. This would point to a diversity in the altered states beingwitnessed, that there is no one underlying state or cause operatingin these examples. This conforms to the general conclusions foundin the earlier discussion of the psychological effects of samAW.Notes1 Gerald Brenan, St John of the Cross: His Life and Poetry, Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1973, p.118."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"THE SUFIS’ EXPLANATIONS1732LumaW 281.18–282.5;Ris. 344; ISyAX II.294.23 –7; Mcd. p.736.3Abemamid al-Ghazalc,Al-Munqidh min al-KalAl, ed.

It isonly in the later texts, beginning with Hujwirc’sKashf al-MaSjEb,that specific discussion on these subjects is found. Jean During arguesthat the earlier texts were more concerned with questions of thelegality of samAW, perhaps a more fundamental issue since it affectsthe very existence of the practice. Questions of rules, behaviour andorganisation, covered by the concept of AdAb, only arise later in thehistory of Sufism, once the practice is firmly established.1 Duringalso argues that this concept of AdAb was necessitated by the rise ofspurious, debased or non-authentic samAW activities which challengedthe credibility of the genuine practice.2In scholarly discussion of this subject, only During’s Musique etextase provides an adequate account, though again he mainly drawson later source works than those under consideration in the pres-ent study. The earlier texts are often overlooked, despite their wit-nessing important source material for the early conduct of samAWceremonies. The main drawback with these texts, however, is theirlack of organised treatment of this topic, with many brief referencesscattered throughout the works. It is these earliest source writingswhich have been the focus in the present study, and they againprovide significant material for the analysis of ritual behaviour andconduct, or AdAb, which forms the subject of the present chapter.Two primary concerns are maintained throughout this chapter.The first is to attempt a description of the type of samAW ceremoniespractised in the early centuries of Sufism, as far as ascertainablefrom the source texts. This type of reconstruction may not be com-prehensive, since not every aspect of the ceremonies or concerts is"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW175outlined. In fact, many of the details are gleaned from incidentalreferences or hints which were never intended to be used for suchreconstruction. It may still be possible, however, to gain a fair rep-resentation of the character of these concerts, even with a lack ofcompleteness.Comparison is also made with contemporary descriptions of simi-lar ceremonies, particularly with those described in the writings ofthe musicologist, Regula Qureshi, whose fieldwork is the most valu-able in this regard. It is undoubtedly the case that these ceremonieshave altered over the centuries, from place to place, and betweendiffering Sufi sects and orders, but some of the elements remain thesame. For the purposes of this chapter, the evidence of contempor-ary ceremonies informs the ancient texts and the reconstruction ofearly Sufi rituals. It is not possible here to describe and assess therange of contemporary ceremonies.The second concern of this chapter is more central to the subjectof the book as a whole. This is to describe and evaluate the rela-tionship between the altered states arising from samAW and theirritual expression. The section on the psychology of these states wasoften concerned with non-ritualised or accidental expressions ofbehaviour associated with ‘listening’. Some of these had ritual orceremonial implications, such as the behaviour of ‘rising in ecstasy’,but the non-ritual element was given focus in what was essentially apsychological study. The ritual elements, and the rules of conductand etiquette are, on the other hand, largely social and cultural con-cerns. The ceremonies are always carried out in a group or socialsetting, often with structured hierarchies and group rules of con-duct operating, and always with social implications for whatever‘individual’ behaviour is carried out. The relationship between alteredstates and their manifestation within a group setting is a principalfocus for this chapter.As well as the source texts used previously in this study, a veryimportant contribution to this subject is the brief polemical work ofGhazalc’s brother, Majd al-Dcn, entitled BawAriq al-IlmAW(Gleamsof Guidance).3 This short ‘pamphlet’ is independent from his brother’smore extensive writings on the subject. The author is a keen sup-porter of the practice of samAW, the first part of the BawAriq being aspirited defence, with arguments from traditional sources, and asustained rebuttal of opposing views. Toward the end of the work,there is a description of the conduct of a samAW session, in program-matic style with suggestions for the appropriate Qurxanic texts to be"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW176used. This provides one of the earliest actual descriptions of suchproceedings, and is an extremely valuable source of information asto their character.Restrictions on and qualifications of participantsThis question is basic to the practice of samAW, namely definingthose who are suited, or allowed, to listen to concerts of music andpoetry. It is an issue upon which nearly all the source writings havea view. The question is partly related to the legal issues surroundingsamAW, that is, whether the practice as a whole is desirable or per-missible. Most of the authors from the early period of Sufism areonly moderately in favour of the practice, because of the possibilityof its corrupting influence, and the pandering to sensuality whichcould accompany concerts. For this reason, many of the authorsare keen to restrict certain classes of people from participating.SarrAjThere are several references scattered through Sarraj’s text concern-ing the qualifications of people able to listen to samAW.The first reference has, perhaps surprisingly, more to do withaesthetics than with quasi-legal issues. Sarraj mentions an unsourcedquote that some Sufis regard samAW asa sweet nourishment for the spirits of those who are aware,for it is a quality finer and more subtle than other actions.It is perceived by one who has a sensitive nature, becauseof its sensitivity, and by the pure of heart among those whoappreciate it, because of its purity and grace.(LumaW 271.14 –16)This reference to the aesthetic qualities of samAW is not a clearstatement of the qualifications for listening, but the implication isthat only those with a sensitive spirit are able to appreciate thesubtlety of listening. It is similar to saying that only some peoplehave an ear for music, although there are added spiritual implica-tions in Sarraj’s statement. In any event, this concept of sensitivityto listening and the implied suitability of the listener is emphasisedelsewhere, particularly by Ghazalc (ISyAX II.277.23ff; Mcd. p.230).The more usual stipulations on those who practice samAW occurseveral times in the course of Sarraj’s work. Bundar b. al-musayn"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW177(d.353/964–5) argues that there should be no corrupt intent, evilaction, mere amusement or contravention of divine ordinances in-volved in listening (LumaW 273.4 –9). Such stipulations are often re-stated in similar form as an overriding condition of the organisationofsamAW concerts (LumaW 276.10 –1; 277.11–5). Ghazalc expands onthis basic stipulation by explaining the problems associated withsecular poetry, for example where erotic references may occur, orwhere profanity or blasphemy might be expected (ISyAX II.279.31ff;Mcd. p.237).One consequence of this stipulation is mentioned by Sarraj in astatement where he frowns on the mingling of adepts with ordinarypeople. Such mingling might take place in what he terms ‘natural(or sensual) listening’ (bi-UabWhi), where there is no restriction onthose who may attend a concert together (LumaW 278.8 –9).Another condition which Sarraj recommends is the requirementof a meditative attitude when attending recitals of the Qurxan. Withthis type of listening, Sarraj argues the need for ‘presence of heart,close consideration, thought and recollection’ (LumaW 283.2–3). Inregard to samAW more generally, he suggests an attitude similar toprayer, with a collected state of mind before and after (LumaW 293.14 –15). This cultivation of a meditative attitude is formalised in theactual organisation of concerts through the recital of Qurxan pass-ages before and after the main recitations of the qawwAl or profes-sional reciter. This feature of concerts is evidenced as early as thetime of Majd al-Dcn al-Ghazalc in the early sixth/twelfth century,who describes the recital of Qurxan verses before and after samAWconcerts as a matter of course.4 It is of interest to note that contem-porary concerts also follow this order of performance. In the Indo-Muslim tradition studied by Qureshi, there is found a programmeconsisting of Qurxan recitations at the beginning and ending, help-ing to produce a prayerful and reverential attitude in the listeners.5The only remaining statement by Sarraj on the qualificationsfor listening is a lengthy passage describing the prerequisites fornovices to be allowed to listen (LumaW287.13 –288.8). Sarraj statesthat the novice should already understand the various divine namesand attributes. Their heart should not be stained with love of theworld, but rather it should be filled with praise, and they should notdesire human companionship. If these conditions are fulfilled, theperson can listen, provided it is not for pleasure, and that it doesnot become a habit which distracts them from the service of God. Ifthese conditions are not fulfilled, they should avoid listening, exceptfor ritual recollection (dhikr). A guide should be sought out, so that"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW178listening does not become an amusement, and so that one does notattribute wrongly to God and thereby blaspheme, or follow thewhims of one’s passions.QushayrCMany of Qushayrc’s pronouncements in his RisAla are directlyattributed to his master, AbewAlc al-Daqqaq. This is also the casewith his views on the qualifications of people for listening to samAW.In line with Sarraj’s restrictions, AbewAlc forbade ordinary people(al-WawAmm) from listening, specifically because of the continuedexistence of their lower or carnal natures (nufEsihim) (Ris. 340). Thisalludes to the possibility of such people finding in samAW a pamper-ing of their desires or the pleasures of sensuality elicited by themusic or poetry.Abe Alc is also quoted as having taught that there are two classesof listeners, based on certain conditions attained by participants.The first is that of ‘knowledge and clarity of consciousness’ (al-Wilmwa-Xl-{aSw) which consists of knowing the divine names and qual-ities. The second class depends on the ‘state of consciousness’ (SAl)of the participants, conditional on having ‘passed beyond the lowerhuman states, and being cleared from the effects of the passions’(Ris. 341).These conditions support the earlier restriction on ordinary peoplefrom listening, as AbewAlc clearly considers the activity a specialprerogative of those more advanced on the Sufi path.GhazAlCThe stipulations set out by Ghazalc prohibiting certain activitiesassociated with ‘listening’ are mainly concerned with the need toavoid the cultivation of carnal desires and pleasures. This buildssubstantially on the rather scanty written prohibitions of earlierSufi writers, though it is probably a case of simply codifying earlierpractices. It should be kept in mind that a primary reason for thedevelopment of AdAb, or a code of practice, was the danger ofimproper and debased performances of samAW which threatened thelegitimacy and respectability of the genuine practice.6 The serious-ness with which Ghazalc treats this subject, and the amount ofspace he devotes to it, is an indication of the gravity of this threat.Ghazalc devotes several pages to developing the reasons for his pro-hibition of ‘listening’. He argues that there are five basic circumstances"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW179wheresamAW should be prohibited (ISyAX II. 279.10ff; Mcd. pp.235 –41).The first is where the performer is a woman with whom it is un-lawful to associate, e.g. not a family member, or where the performeris a beardless (teenage) youth. The main reason for this prohibition isthe ‘fear of temptation’, not from the material recited or sung, butfrom the actual reciter or singer who may arouse unlawful desires.The second case is where certain musical instruments are in use,namely, wind and stringed instruments and the kEba drum. Thereason here is that these instruments are emblematic of wine drinkersand the class of singer known as a mukhannath (‘effeminate artist’),so named because of the type of emotional songs he performed, andhis being taught by women teachers.7 Again the proximity of tempta-tion, and even a symbolic association with unlawful actions, isuppermost in Ghazalc’s thinking.The third situation which gives rise to prohibition is where thecontent of the songs or poetry is offensive for various reasons.These include obscenity, ribaldry, satire or blasphemy against Godand the founders of Islam, the offence in such material being clear.As well, any description of a particular woman, or of a woman withwhom it is unlawful to associate, is forbidden. The reason here isobviously that of not cultivating lustful and illicit desires. Ghazalcargues carefully, however, that ‘erotic’ descriptions which are ap-plicable to divine love or other metaphorical applications are notforbidden per se. The overriding principle in this is the heart andconscience of the listener: ‘the thoughts which control the heartarrive first at understanding what is heard despite the actual expres-sion’ (ISyAX II.280.12; Mcd. p.238).The fourth occasion develops from the former, and concerns thesituation where lust has control of a person, particularly if thatperson is youthful. In Ghazalc’s view it is Satan who is in ultimatecontrol of such a person, and their listening which may arouse baserpassions should not be allowed. It is interesting to follow the fineline drawn by Ghazalc between legitimate and prohibited or suspectsamAW. The former arouses spiritual yearnings which advance theSufi’s inner life, while the latter arouses only carnal desires and pas-sions. For those who cannot abide this subtle distinction, which hasmore to do with the listener’s own state of mind than any moreconcrete circumstance, the simple answer is to prohibit all samAW.The difficulty for Ghazalc is to maintain this fine distinction, and topromote its acceptance by the Muslim community, though here hisexpert rhetorical skills serve him well."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW180The final occasion which Ghazalc sees as unacceptable is that oflistening for its own sake, of taking excessive pleasure in the practiceand devoting most of one’s time to it. Again this is a fine distinction,since Ghazalc argues that a small amount of interest in the practicemay be acceptable, while excessive devotion to it makes it unlawful.An analogy used is that a black mole on a cheek is beautiful, but aface full of moles becomes ugly; similarly, eating bread is lawful,but eating too much is gluttony.In addition to this lengthy discussion of prohibitions, Ghazalcalso has some reservations about the listening of young disciples ornovices, which he includes in a section on AdAb at the end of theISyAX chapter (II.298.28ff; Mcd. pp.2–3). The author outlines threetypes of novice for whom listening is unsuitable. The first is onewho is of a practical inclination and has no ‘taste’ for samAW. Thesecond is one who has a taste for the practice, but in whom there isstill a residue of carnal desires and passions which has not beensubdued. The third case is with one who has subdued these passions,but who has not mastered the knowledge required to practise samAWwithout danger of blasphemy and attributing unworthy qualities toGod. Ghazalc goes on to suggest that listening is not desirable fornovices whose hearts are stained with worldly love, or whose listen-ing is merely for pleasure.The social and ritual organisation of samAWIt should not be surprising that an activity as complex and formalisedassamAWconcert has an intricate organisational structure, given thelarge numbers of participants who often belong to ‘brotherhoods’of Sufi orders. The source texts, however, are not generous in givingdetails of these structures, and the evidence available to us is incid-ental and sporadic. It is possible, though, to gain from these incid-ental references some picture of the structures involved, particularlyconcerning the central role of the shaykh or master of ceremonies.HierarchiesThe existence of hierarchical structures is assumed in Sufi commun-ities. Many of the authors we have discussed often write about thevarious ‘grades’ of participants in any activity, which vary from subjectto subject. For example, there might be three grades of listeners:novices, a middle ranking, and adepts, while in some other capacitythe grading may be different. This points to a ranked structuring,"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW181though the actual division of ranks may vary according to the criteriaused. Such hierarchies are expected in religious communities wheredivisions among disciples and between disciples and masters can beassumed from the beginnings of Sufi organisations.There is some incidental evidence about such hierarchical structuresand their consequences available in the source texts. In the psycho-logy chapter it was noted that the behaviour of ‘rising in ecstasy’ oftenappeared in a mass form, with whole assemblies rising to their feetall at once. It was suggested that this indicates a type of conformistbehaviour consequent on strict discipline within the community:when the master rose to his feet in ecstasy, others did so as a matterof course, whether or not there was a general feeling of ecstasy.The incident of Dhexl-Nen and his imitator is an indication ofthe consequent operations of a strictly hierarchical social system. Inthis case, the man, evidently a disciple or would-be disciple, probablyfelt that Dhexl-Nen was such an authoritative figure that imitationof his behaviour was desirable, however inappropriate it may havebeen in the situation.8The incident of Nerc and the assembly of scholars shows theoperation of similar social forces, though the narrative is rather barein details. An assembly discussing scholarly questions suddenly ‘risesin ecstasy’ when Nerc unexpectedly recites verses of love poetry.The incident is probably designed to illustrate the power of recitedverse, but the mass behaviour is rather exceptional in the circum-stances. It suggests the operation of conformist or ritual behaviour,an outcome of a highly ordered social structure. It may be assumedthat the ranking within the scholarly group prompted the massrising: the actions of the senior and most revered members wereimitated by those lower in rank.A further example of the operation of social hierarchies is men-tioned by Qureshi in describing contemporary samAW ceremonies.This involves an individual response which ‘serves to express thedevotee’s spiritual attachment to the Sufi hierarchy and it takes thesocially established form of establishing a link with a superior throughan offering . . . this offering is a deferential gesture indicating thedevotee’s submission to the saint or confirming his attachment tohis spiritual guide.’9The role of the shaykh or masterAny discussion of hierarchies naturally overlaps with that of therole of members within such a structured system. The position of"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW182the shaykh or master in the Sufi system is crucially important andcentral to the performance ceremonies being considered here.An incident relating to Dhexl-Nen illustrates the central roleplayed by the master or shaykh. Four different accounts of thisincident occur in the sources. There are some differences betweenthese, but not in the essentials which affect the present argument.10It is recorded that Dhexl-Nen once arrived in Baghdad where hewas attended by a group of Sufis among whom was a professionalreciter. Despite, or perhaps because of, this new-found attachmentto the famed master, they expressly asked his permission for thereciter to chant some verse. This is possibly a shorthand way ofstating that arrangements were made for a samAW session to be held,though the sources convey the impression that the incident wasspontaneous and informal. Dhexl-Nen grants his permission andthe reciter begins to chant, whereupon the master goes into ecstasies,and other events ensue.What is of interest here is that Dhexl-Nen’s newly found band ofdisciples seek his permission for the performance, in deference tohis authority. This is in all likelihood because of his position as arevered authority figure or their master. It is thus assumed that theshaykh will have ultimate authority over the conduct of samAW per-formances, as generally over the activities of his disciples.Qureshi also points out that in contemporary practice the shaykhhas effective authority over performers and musicians, for examplein choice of repertoire and the style of execution.11 That such con-trol was maintained in earlier times could be assumed, and in thiscase, the poetry which caused such ecstasies in Dhexl-Nen mightwell have been a piece chosen by him.The subsequent events of this incident involve Dhexl-Nen’s‘rising’ in ecstasy and the imitation of his behaviour by a particu-larly zealous disciple. At this, the master rebukes the imitator, whoimmediately regains his seat, thereby showing that his behaviourwas not genuinely ecstatic. Sarraj comments that for this reasonmasters superintend the ‘states’ of those lower in ranking, and theydo not allow any overstepping of the mark or pretence in experien-cing states which they have not experienced (Lumaw 290.9–11). Suchsuperintendence is still a feature of contemporary samAW as witnessedby Qureshi. The shaykh is described ‘not only as the one in a positionof controlling the sama proceedings, but, more specifically, in hisrecognized capacity as a teacher and guide setting an example tothe other listeners.’12 Until the devotee is fully initiated, ‘he is tolisten under spiritual guidance and in the presence of his sheikh or a"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW183spiritual superior. For cultivating the spiritual delight of a mysticalarousal and allowing it to progress to the point of ecstasy is agradual process achieved only by the spiritually advanced.’13A further illustration of the importance of the shaykh’s super-vision is provided elsewhere in Sarraj and Qushayrc. It is relatedthat a group were once gathered at a certain person’s house withaqawwAl present. They were in an ecstatic or near-ecstatic state,and were being overseen by Mimshadh al-Dcnawarc (d.299/911–2).Mimshadh’s supervision was perhaps not continuous, for ‘when theylooked at him they all fell quiet’ (LumaW 293.17ff; Ris. 347). Thissuggests that he may have been absent for a period while they beganreciting and responding, or else his mood changed and they becameaware of his apparent displeasure. There may be other possibilitieswhich are not spelled out by the text, for Qushayrc’s version has itthat when Mimshadh looked over them, they fell silent. In any case,what this illustrates is the degree of control and authority over theproceedings exercised by the master of ceremonies. The narrativecontinues to relate that in fact Mimshadh was not displeased withthe proceedings, since he took no notice of any sounds which mighthave distracted others, claiming that ‘all the instruments in the world’could not distract his inner attentiveness.The role of the shaykh as a guide and spiritual director has beenmentioned above by Qureshi in regard to contemporary samAW per-formance. This role certainly has a long history, as indicated in asection of Sarraj’sLumaW which outlines various reasons for thepresence of elders or shaykhs at such performances. The inferenceto be drawn is that the elders would not otherwise be present, orthat such gatherings are not a suitable place for spiritual directorsto be seen.The reasons given by Sarraj for their presence are, first, ‘thesupport of one of their brothers’; second, ‘Their knowledge, trust-worthiness, and great understanding allows them to teach othersabout the rules and decorum of samAW.’ This role of guide extendssometimes to those outside their own fraternity, because of the elders’moral integrity and strength of purpose. Sarraj concludes thatalthough they may be present ‘externally’ or in body, they have innerdetachment, and are inwardly separate (from their surroundings)(LumaW 294.14 –9). This concluding statement confirms the sugges-tion that samAWperformances are not quite acceptable for variousreasons. The inference is that inner detachment is needed to helpward off any likely ‘contamination’ such as sensual enjoyment fromthe proceedings. This appears somewhat strangely in an author who"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW184is generally in favour of the activity; however, it could be arguedthat Sarraj is merely underlining the inherent dangers and tempta-tions of samAW which are clearly spelled out elsewhere in his work.In his BawAriq al-IlmAW, Majd al-Dcn al-Ghazalc describes theprogramme of a samAW performance of his time (late fifth/eleventhto early sixth/twelfth century). The session opens with the recital ofQurxan verses, of which Majd al-Dcn gives some typical examples.He then relates that the shaykh ‘speaks about the meaning of theseverses in a manner suited to the station of mystical practices’.14Some typical examples of this practice are related, all of a homileticstyle expounding aspects of mystical theology. This exposition ofQurxan verses sets the mood and tone for the main part of the per-formance which follows immediately as the qawwAlbegins hisrecitation in earnest.Sarraj provides an incidental, and perhaps obscure, reference toa similar practice in a rather unusual narrative concerning Abexl-Qasim b. Marwan al-Nihawandc (d. late third/ninth century). Notbeing a frequenter of samAW, Abexl-Qasim was invited to a sessionwhere a certain verse of secular poetry was recited. Everyone in theaudience went into ecstasies except Abexl-Qasim, who waited untilthe other participants had regained their usual state. He began askingtheir opinions about the meaning of the verse, and received variousanswers which were unsatisfactory to him. Then the others askedAbexl-Qasim for his interpretation, which was evidently superiorto theirs (LumaW 288.16 –289.7). The purpose of the narrative as itstands has to do with the misuse of samAW as a means of attainingecstasy without genuine knowledge. It shows incidentally, however,that discussing the meaning of recited material such as poetry was afeature of samAW sessions as early as the third/ninth century. The roleof the shaykh or master is again seen to be central in such activity.The role of the reciterThere are not many references to the role and activity of the reciterin the early sources on samAW. Despite the centrality of the reciter inall performances, it is perhaps the case that the reciter’s role is notunder direct scrutiny of the shaykh. This is what Qureshi suggestsin regard to contemporary practice.15 There are certainly some gen-eral ground rules on their conduct, such as those outlined above byGhazalc regarding the content of poetry. Provided these are adheredto, it seems that the remainder is left to their own discretion withinthe tradition of the reciter’s art."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW185Majd al-Dcn in his description of a typical programme outlinesthe importance of reciters in the proceedings. When the assembly isgathered, he writes, one who has ‘the most sensitive voice’ beginsreciting short passages from the Qurxan, which are then interpretedby the shaykh, as mentioned above. ‘Then the qawwAl engages ininstructive speech and a saying pertaining to the Lord’;16 the ex-amples given by Majd al-Dcn include mystical poetry similar to theodes of the celebrated Ibn al-Fariq (d.632/1235). The question oferotic poetry, discussed in detail by Majd al-Dcn’s more famousbrother, Abemamid, is here dealt with summarily in a single sen-tence: ‘Now if the qawwAlutters poetry in which there is a descriptionof a cheek, a mole, and a stature, it is to be applied to the cheek,mole, and stature of the Prophet.’17Following this central task of reciting poetry which will inducealtered states in the listeners, Majd al-Dcn describes the reciter’sequally important task of leading listeners back to ordinary con-sciousness, as follows:When their spirits receive a mystical apprehension (SaVV)of the unseen states, and their hearts are softened by thelights of the divine Essence and are established in purityand the spiritual lights, they sit down, and he who chants(muzamzim) chants a light chant to bring them forth bydegrees from the internal to the external. Then when hestops, someone other than the first reciter recites. . . [certainpassages from the Qurxan] . . . Then if there is amongthem anyone in whom remains the residue of a state or ofabsorption, the qawwAl repeats [what he uttered] in a lightervoice than the first; and if they remain seated, he does it athird time in a voice intermediate between the heavy andthe light.18In contemporary samAW performance, a similar process may beobserved, as recorded by Qureshi.19 A detailed account of a Chishtiperformance witnessed in Delhi includes a description of the subtleinterplay between reciter and audience, particularly those in theaudience responsive to the music and showing behavioural signs ofaltered states. The reciter is constantly adapting and accommodatingthe fine details of his performance to meet the needs of responsivelisteners. He is heard repeating parts of verses, using varying tonesof voice, interpolating fragments from other songs or poetry intothe repetition of a verse, and so on. This is in order to guide the"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW186listeners’ arousal and ecstasy in an appropriate way, to enhance thestate of arousal, allow it to come to a peak and then subside gently.Such subtle handling of the listeners’ responses is part of the skill ofan expert reciter.Majd al-Dcn’s description of the reciter gently leading the listenerout of an altered state shows a similarity to these contemporarypractices. Qureshi’s report of the Chishti performance adds somedetail to the bare bones presented in the early Sufi sources, yet itappears that essentially the same process is in operation.One of the few references by Sarraj to the reciter’s role concernsthe problem of mistakes in reciting, or other mishaps which couldaffect the success of the performance. Sarraj argues that the inten-tion or purpose of the author of a poem is of no importance to thelistener. In other words, the meaning of recited poetry can be inter-preted variously, in accordance with the needs and state of mind ofthe listener. It follows that the carelessness and negligence (ghafla)of the reciter, resulting in mistakes or omissions, does not spoil theeffect of the recitation; similarly, the ‘dissonances’ (tashattut) of thechanter in his chanting have no effect because of the alertness and‘composure’ of the listeners’ minds (LumaW 296.19–297.1).The rigorous strictures placed on Qurxan recitation, as documentedrecently by Lois al-Faruqi, seem not to apply in the case of secularpoetry, at least at the time of Sarraj’s writing: ‘Correct pronunci-ation of the divine word is of course the sine qua non for goodQurxanic chant. To recite it carelessly is regarded as blasphemy tothe Qurxan and a mark of shame on its reciter’.20 The milder viewexpressed by Sarraj may perhaps relate back to the controversialQurxanic verse (2.225) ‘God will not take you to task for a slip inyour oaths.’ The word laghw here (‘slip’ or ‘mistake in pronunci-ation’) has also been understood as ‘thoughtlessness’ or ‘carelessness’.Such carelessness or mistakes in the pronunciation of oaths maybe comparable to the reciting of secular poetry, in which mistakenpronunciation is not deemed a serious offence.Sarraj also places the onus on the listeners to be creative parti-cipants in the performance: it is those listeners who are ‘alert’ or‘attentive’ (muntabihCn) and have ‘composure of mind’ or ‘concen-tration of thought’ (mustajmiWCn) who accommodate any problemsof reciting, and allow for the assimilation of these mistakes.Such participation on the part of listeners is echoed by Abemamidal-Ghazalc in his discussion of behaviour at samAW performances.He writes: ‘One should be attentive to what the speaker says, pres-ent in heart, turning aside little, guarding oneself from looking at"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW187the faces of the listeners and what they show of states of ecstasy,absorbed in oneself and the guarding of one’s heart . . .’ (ISyAXII.299.9–10; Mcd. pp.3 – 4). This is an elaboration of what is impliedin Sarraj’s briefer description of the listener’s attentiveness and con-centration of mind. These considerations lead to the issue of thelistener’s role and behaviour during the experience of altered states.Behaviour of listeners during altered state onsetIn one of the few references to ritual practice in Sulamc’s writings,the author mentions in his JawAmiWFdAb al-ZEfCya the value of notspeaking about mystical states which have not been personallyexperienced. He also asserts that it is important not to claim thatone has reached a certain degree of ecstasy, and that one shouldremain quiet when one has been overwhelmed by an ecstatic state(JawAmiW ed. Kohlberg, pp.47,50).The last quote above from Ghazalc’s work derives from a sectiondealing with the behaviour of listeners during samAW performances.The author offers a categorical set of rules concerning acceptableconduct in such a situation. Following his description of what isrequired for close attention to the reciter, Ghazalc suggests that oneought to sit as if in thought, avoiding hand-clapping or other move-ments. If ecstasy overcomes one, however, the involuntary move-ments it engenders are excusable, but they are not to be ‘enhanced’by any voluntary action (ISyAXII.299.11– 6; Mcd. p.4).This principle is taken further by the author’s recommendationthat one should not ‘rise in ecstasy’ or begin weeping as long asthese actions are under voluntary control. On the other hand, dan-cing and affected weeping (tabAkA) is allowable, provided there isno hypocrisy intended, since these activities induce joy and grief,respectively (ISyAX II.300.20ff; Mcd. p.8).Ghazalc then moves to the question of the tearing of garments,which he again allows only if it is done involuntarily (ISyAX II.301.2ff;Mcd. pp.9 –10).With the exception of dancing and affected weeping mentionedabove, the author’s consistency of argument is apparent in thissection. Generally speaking, involuntary actions cannot be preventedor disallowed, yet the same actions done voluntarily are to beavoided, and cannot be sanctioned.A short but important section follows, which stresses the value ofcompanionship and the observance of good manners during samAWperformance. What Ghazalc terms the etiquette of companionship"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW188(AdAb al-{uSba) involves the whole audience’s rising in empathy witha listener who is experiencing ecstasy (ISyAX II.301.17ff; Mcd. pp.10 –11). This mass behaviour pattern was discussed in Chapter 4, andalso above in the section dealing with hierarchies. It was suggestedthat such actions are a type of conformism consequent upon a strictlyordered and hierarchical structure within Sufi communities, but aritual element may also be present in these circumstances. Ghazalc’sstatements make these actions appear in a rather different light.Instead of simply being a function of a highly structured social order,Ghazalc suggests that these behaviours are a consequence of the closebond of companionship and harmony between members of the com-munity. Part of their close social and spiritual connection involvesempathetic action of this sort, to support and encourage their com-panions when they experience ecstatic reactions.Ghazalc also appeals to the argument of custom or traditionalbehaviour (WAda) in explaining the actions of some listeners. Oneexample involves discarding one’s turban in empathy with a listenerin ecstasy whose turban may fall to the ground (ISyAX II.301.19ff;Mcd. p.11). This again forms part of ‘good companionship andsociability’ (Susn al-{uSba wa-Xl-Wishra), which the author justifies bythe citing of a SadCth and other evidence from the actions of theProphet’s companions.The question of dancing arises again in this context, Ghazalcarguing that one who is dancing voluntarily ought not to be encour-aged by others rising in empathy. This indicates that those presentare able to discriminate between actions performed voluntarily ornot, in the case of dancing by the heaviness or lightness of thesteps used.The author goes so far as to quote a saying on the authenticityof ecstasy, that ‘Its soundness is the acceptance of it by the heartsof those present when they are of like mind and not contrary’ (ISyAXII.301.32ff; Mcd. p.12). This statement is an indication of theextent to which the principle of community acceptance applies; theauthenticity of an altered state is not dependent on the experienceof the individual concerned, but rather on whether other membersof the community with a similar temperament accept it as real andgenuine. In a way, this can be seen as the basic legal principle ofijmAW (community consensus) being applied more widely, not onlyto questions of doctrine, law, and moral behaviour, but to innerexperience as well.This should not come as anything of a surprise, however, sincean individual’s mystical experience always comes under the control"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW189of a spiritual master, and cannot really be regarded as autonom-ous and beyond outside scrutiny. In a sense, this forms part of thehegemony of mainstream religion in its supervision, interpretation,and control of ‘raw’ mystical experience. For the benefit of theoverall religious system, mystical experience cannot be allowed todevelop unchecked in an antinomian fashion. The rawness of originalexperience always needs a legitimising interpretation and assimila-tion into the structures of a particular doctrinal system. Qushayrc,one of the more conservative Sufi writers, saw in the enlighteningexperience of ‘expansion’ (basU) one of the greatest dangers, and ‘aninsidious deception’. This was arguably because of the potential ofregarding this experience as extending beyond the confines andrequirements of mainstream religion.21Majd al-Dcn describes some comparable conditions in the samAWperformance. He recommends that when a particular listener comesinto ecstasy he should not rise until overpowered, when the othersmay do likewise. The same behaviours recorded in the narratives ofSarraj’sLumaW are alluded to here in this descriptive and prescript-ive passage of Majd al-Dcn’s. Dance is not to be ‘affected or feigned’,partly in agreement with his brother’s recommendations in theISyAX.22 Majd al-Dcn also mentions the practice of people leavingthe assembly after the performance and returning to their homes ina state of ‘absorption in ecstasy’. Some even fast for several days onaccount of their experience, a situation already familiar from whatis recorded in the LumaW concerning Sahl Tustarc who fasted formore than three weeks at a time.23In his Kashf al-MaSjEb, Hujwcrc has a detailed section dealingwith these issues of behaviour and etiquette (AdAb) surroundingsamAW. He first discusses the issue of ‘dancing’ (raq{), which he quitevehemently opposes as being unlawful and morally reprehensible. Oncloser analysis, however, one finds that he is referring to the volunt-ary act of dancing, not the involuntary behaviour of the listener whois overwhelmed ecstatically. Hujwcrc refers to this latter activity asjAn gudAkhtan (‘purifying the soul’), which he clearly distinguishesfrom other forms of dance and movement. In a positive descriptionof this activity, curiously not translated by Nicholson, Hujwcrc com-mends the spiritual basis and nature of this form of movement:The person who calls it ‘dance’ is far from the right path,and even further away is the person who calls it a statewhich does not come involuntarily from God, (the listener)bringing that movement upon himself; it is called a true"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW190(altered) state which ‘arrives’ from the Truth, and is some-thing which cannot be explained in words: ‘He who has notexperienced, has no knowledge’.(Kashf542.9 –13)Thus although Hujwcrc outlaws the act of dancing as such, he doesnot condemn the appearance of these involuntary movements whichaccompany altered states.On the issue of tearing garments, Hujwcrc agrees with Ghazalcthat it is allowed only if done in a state where there is loss of controlof one’s actions (Kashf542.18ff.; Nich. pp.417– 8).Again in agreement with Ghazalc, Hujwcrc recommends thatecstatic states ought not to be forced, but should be allowed to come‘naturally’ in their own time and manner. The state itself should befollowed as it proceeds in its own way; ‘One ought to be in a tem-porary state of ‘seeking’, allowing the dominion of that state so thatits benefits may find one’ (Kashf 545.17–546.1; Nich. p.419).This principle of allowing the ecstasy to ‘have its own way’ andnot to force or attempt to control its manifestation is at the basis ofHujwcrc’s recommendations, which he elaborates in different guises.An overall view of samAW etiquetteThe basic assumption for the social psychology of samAW is theexistence of strong hierarchical structures within the Sufi commun-ity of listeners. There is sufficient evidence in the source writings forthis assumption of social rankings and highly structured relationsamong and between disciples and masters.The shaykh or master has the ultimate responsibility and author-ity over the conduct of the performance. This is borne out in thenarratives and the discursive or prescriptive sections of the sourcewritings. He has control over the repertoire of the performers, andgeneral oversight of the psychological states of his disciples. He istheir guide and spiritual director on the matter of samAW as withother aspects of their lives. It was also seen that his role as a teacheralso extends to the exposition of spiritual meaning in the texts recitedduringsamAW.The reciter has a crucial role in arousing and guiding the progressof altered states in listeners. This function is apparent in the earliestsources, though it is first specified in Majd al-Dcn’s writing. Theinterplay between the reciter and his audience is apparent in thequestion of errors in pronunciation, or other mistakes of the reciter"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"RITUAL BEHAVIOUR AND ETIQUETTE OF SAMFW191in which the discretion of the listener and his response becomesimportant.The source writers are almost unanimous in maintaining thatvoluntary responses, those within the listener’s power to initiate, arenot acceptable as manifestations of altered states. Ghazalc is per-haps the most forthright in arguing that only involuntary responses,occasioned by the overwhelming nature of the state, should beencouraged and accepted as genuine.Ghazalc also endorses the value of comradeship among listeners,with empathetic rising and other imitative behaviours being seen assupportive and encouraging for those experiencing these actionsinvoluntarily. This should not be seen as a contradiction of the dis-couragement of voluntary actions, for in Ghazalc’s view the valuesof supportive companionship override other considerations.His stress on the importance of comradeship also partly under-mines the view argued earlier in this study that these imitative andempathetic actions are directly the result of strict hierarchies andconformist attitudes of obedience within Sufi communities. Yet someaspects of conformism in social attitudes are seen to be operatingin the argument put forward by Ghazalc that the acceptance ofecstatic states and their authenticity are a matter of communityconsensus, not individual experience. This notion of consensus comesvery near to the basic legal principle of ijmAW, but it is difficult notto see in this an attempt also to restrain any raw experience deemedundesirable by those in authority. An important part of samAW prac-tice is that of maintaining control by those in authority, and therule of obedience among lesser members of the community.Notes1 Jean During, Musique et extase: L’audition mystique dans la traditionsoufie, Paris: Albin Michel, 1988, pp.117–21.2 Ibid., p.117.3 Text and translation in James Robson (ed.), Tracts on Listening toMusic, London: Royal Asiatic Society, 1938.4 Robson, op.cit., p.105.5 Regula B.

They maybe mentioned only occasionally in the source texts, often fleetingly,and sometimes anonymously. They disappear quickly back into thepages from which they momentarily arise, in which the faint memoryof an episode from their lives is preserved.There are other, better known figures who appear more frequentlyin the source texts, and in all writings about the early Sufis. Thefamed personalities of Junayd, Dhexl-Nen, Sahl Tustarc, and othersare well documented, and much is known of these important figurestoday.1The two subjects of this present chapter, the third/ninth and fourth/tenth century mystics Nerc and Shiblc, probably fall into this latterclass of well-known figures. Their lives and deeds are familiar to allserious inquirers of Sufism; yet these two personalities remain fur-ther away from the centre of Islamic mysticism than is justifiable.Reading the secondary literature on the Sufis, and even at times thesource texts themselves, one is left with a sense that their momentouslives have been relegated to the periphery.The centre stage of the formative period has been occupied by themore luminous figures of Junayd, and the infamous mallaj. A relat-ive neglect of other Sufi masters may be understandable, given thecentrality of these personalities to the defining period of Sunni mys-ticism. While Nerc and Shiblc were both connected with their morefamous associates, it is perhaps to be expected that their lives anddeeds, however significant, would not match the central importanceof Junayd and mallaj."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE194Part of the explanation, though, must lie in the fact that neitherof the subjects of this present chapter has left us any major writings.It is true that Paul Nwyia recently discovered a work of symbolicinterpretation by Nerc entitled MaqAmAt al-QulEb (Stations of theHearts).2 Besides some poetic fragments by both Nerc and Shiblc,however, there are no other writings by which they can be knowndirectly. The best that is available to us is the group of sayings andecstatic utterances (shaUSCyAt) collected in the foundational Sufi texts.The other part of their record is the tradition surrounding theirdeeds collected in works such as Sarraj’sKitAb al-LumaW and wAuuar’shagiographicalTadhkirat al-AwliyAX.This leads us to the heart of the matter, that both Nerc and Shiblcare not important as theorists or teachers of Sufism, but as prac-tising mystics for whom quality of experience is paramount. Theallegorical work discovered by Nwyia is an explanation of mysticalsymbolism. Yet it is the raw experience of these ecstatic mystics,expressed in their fragmentary utterances, as well as in their actions,austerities, and reactions to mystical states, which are ultimately ofgreater benefit in understanding the essence of the Sufi path.It is thus not surprising that both Nerc and Shiblc have an import-ant connection with samAW and with the phenomena of altered states.It is the case, for example, that one of Nerc’s succinct ‘definitions’of what it means to be a Sufi is given as ‘one who hears the samAW’(LumaW 26.3 – 4). It is perhaps a little ironic that the apparent emo-tional character of Nerc was finally played out in his death whichwas caused by the utter distraction of hearing samAW. The emotionalcharacter of Shiblc is also well documented, though for him the con-nection with altered states sometimes came close to what we wouldregard today as psychosis. At other times, he certainly experiencedthe heightened awareness associated with those who are inspiredand spiritually ‘on fire’.Both of these important Sufis were intimately connected withthe famed circle of Junayd, which flourished in Baghdad in the latethird/ninth and early fourth/tenth centuries. Junayd’s fundamentalapproach was the moderate, cautious attitude and thinking char-acterised by adherence to {aSw, ‘sobriety’ or ‘clarity of mind’ in allthings. This contrasted with the approach of sukr (‘drunkenness’),characterised by a more outspoken, intense and emotional attitudeadvocated by some Sufis.Shiblc can be regarded with some justification as one of the‘intoxicated’ Sufis of his time. wAuuar’s hagiography of him often"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE195mentions the heightened, euphoric ‘states’ which possessed Shiblc,or his frequent states of agitation and distraction. He is also knownto have adopted radical positions in matters affecting every part ofhis behaviour and beliefs. On his deathbed, Shiblc refused to repeattheshahAda, the basic creed of faith, arguing that ‘since there is noother than He, how can I utter a negative?’ (referring to the negat-ive ‘There is no god . . .’ which comes before the affirmative ‘. . . butGod’). This position is one that is assumed by the most radical ofSufis. His austerities and self-mortifications were legendary, as werehis bizarre public ritual behaviours which led to more than oneincarceration in the Baghdad asylum. This way of life seemed farfrom the ideal of moderation and prudence advocated by Junayd,and the tense relationship between the two was widely reported. Onone occasion, Junayd said: ‘Shiblc is intoxicated; were he to recoverfrom his intoxication, he would become a leader of great value’(LumaW 307.8 –10).Both Shiblc and Nerc were complex and subtle personalities. Thisis evident from the brief anecdotes contained in a variety of sources,and from the lengthy hagiographies recorded by wAuuar. Nwyia writesof Nerc’s poetic sensibility, coupled with the audacity of a reformer;when accused of heresy, Nerc was unafraid to confront the Caliphhimself, correcting him where needed, while boldly defending hisaccused companions and offering up his own life to spare theirs.Junayd in the meantime had chosen to withdraw quietly.3 Shiblclikewise displayed all the complexities of a zealous radical, andwhether his ‘insanity’ was genuine or feigned remains debatable. Hetoo was unafraid to confront the Caliph; as wAuuar reports, he wasin a euphoric state when dragged before the authorities on a mur-der charge. As a result of the encounter, the Caliph himself wasemotionally affected (T.A. II.166.20ff; MSM pp.282–3). Shiblc’sdeathbed narrative, as recorded by wAuuar, is a subtle interplay be-tween the moribund central character and his attendants. A violentstruggle of wills is played out between the radical, uncompromisingascetic and his more conservative companions. wAuuar also portraysthe fierce battle taking place within Shiblc’s body and soul, as iftorn between hell and paradise, redemption and alienation (T.A.II.180.16ff; MSM pp.285 – 6).It is clear that both these Sufis practised a radical faith whichsometimes verged on the boundaries of acceptable Islam. One ex-ample centres on their connection with Iblcs: a famous narrative hasNerc weeping in identification with Iblcs and his suffering, while"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE196Shiblc on his deathbed expressed envy and jealousy of God’s curseupon Iblcs.4Of the qualities noted by his biographers, Nerc is probably moreremarkable for the compassion he shows, as in his loyalty to hiscompanions when accused of heresy, as well as with ordinary people,illustrated by an endearing narrative about his restoring the life of apoor peasant’s ass (T.A.II.53.15–7). His compassion is also joinedwith courageous action, as in his encounter with the Caliph, andagain towards ordinary people, as shown in the narrative about hisheroic rescue of two youths from a burning house (T.A. II.52.25–53.8).What is more noteworthy about Shiblc is his intense ‘inwardness’,his absorption with direct inner experience. When joined with austereasceticism, the combination resulted in bizarre public behavioursand what can best be described as psychotic episodes.The connection between these two practising (as distinct fromtheorising) Sufis and their experience of altered states is the subjectto be addressed in this chapter. The importance of this connectioncan hardly be overstated, given the value both men placed on directexperience as the gateway to the mystical path. Their unmediatedencounter with spiritual realities is given expression in ecstatic sayingsand poetic fragments. Yet their physical and psychological reac-tions to the overwhelming of Reality are also worthy of investiga-tion. This study seeks to address the experience of altered states andsamAW demonstrated in the lives of these two mystics. It seeks alsoto investigate the importance and the consequences of this intimateconnection for these two men, and for the early Sufi path moregenerally.A brief life of NercAbexl-musayn al-Nerc was born around 226/840, in Khurasan, butspent most of his life in Baghdad.5 Little is known about his form-ative years, though his piety and asceticism were established early inlife. This is illustrated by the narrative found in wAuuar and Qushayrcthat for twenty years, when he was beginning as a Sufi, he wouldfast all day; those at his home thought he ate at his shop, those athis shop thought he had eaten at home. All the while, he had boughtloaves of bread and given them to the poor, then worshipped inthe mosque until noon, only later proceeding to his work (T.A.II.46.21ff; MSM p.222; Ris. 439). These long years of asceticism"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE197were years of spiritual struggle and formation, an account of whichis given in the first person in wAuuar’sTadhkirat. Evidently this isbased on Nerc’s own words or writings; it presents a vivid andhonest account of his struggle to gain inner knowledge and thesubjugation of his self. By this time he was a member of Junayd’scircle, for when he imagines he has won a spiritual favour, he goesto inform Junayd, who tells him that he is deceived (T.A. II.47ff;MSM pp.222–3).The best known incident in Nerc’s life centres around his beingaccused and condemned to death by Ghulam Khalcl (d.275/888). Astrictmanbalite, Ghulam accused several Sufis of heresy, and hadthem sentenced without trial. Nerc impressed the executioner somuch by his self-sacrificing attitude and willingness to be executedfirst that the proceedings were halted, and a properly constitutedtrial took place before the Cadi. The accused Sufis, including Shiblc,answered correctly the questions on ritual purity and prayer, andNerc spoke eloquently on devotion and love of God. The Cadi(according to wAuuar, the Caliph) was reduced to tears, the Sufiswere freed, and the accusers were left in confusion.6There are some difficulties with the details of this trial, as CarlErnst points out in his thorough discussion of the proceedings.7 It isinteresting to note, for our present purposes, that in wAuuar’s account,the initial accusations of Ghulam Khalcl were that ‘a group hasappeared singing songs and poetry, and dancing’ (T.A. II. 48.5 – 6).Only after this does he mention that ‘they speak blasphemies andheresies’, as though the accusation of practising samAW was an evenmore heinous offence. In the strict manbalite view, of course, suchsinging and dancing was an odious practice. In a way, this confirmsNerc’s statement made elsewhere that a Sufi is known by his listen-ing to samAW.The sources seem to indicate that Nerc was brought before thelegal authorities on more than one occasion. wAuuar recounts anotherincident where Nerc referred to a man’s moustache as ‘the moustacheof God’. On being accused of blasphemy, he defends himself with arather legalistic argument that because the man was a servant ofGod, his moustache really belonged to God (T.A. II.49.16ff; MSMpp.225–6). Sarraj mentions a further occasion of dealings with thosein authority. The chief minister of al-Muwtaqid (reg. 279 – 89/892–902) gave him a large sum of money to distribute among the Suficommunity, perhaps as a recompense for earlier mistreatment. Nercgave the money to all who wanted it, and then remarked on the"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE198spiritual value of poverty.8 This is consistent with a further accountin Sarraj that Nerc was once given 300 dinars from the sale of realestate. He proceeded to drop the money piece by piece into the riverTigris (LumaW 193.20ff).There are many colourful incidents from his life reported by thevarious sources; they cannot all be recounted here. Some of theseincidents, however, have a direct bearing on Nerc’s experience ofaltered states. wAuuar relates that on one occasion Junayd heardabout Nerc wandering around for some days and nights carrying abrick and repeating the name of God over and over. He was noteating or sleeping, but was performing the daily prayers at the righttimes and with due ceremony. Junayd’s companions argued thatthis was a feigned performance; a genuine alteration of state (fAnC)would mean total absence of awareness concerning prayer times orritual ablutions. Junayd disagreed, however, and argued that Godprotects or preserves those in altered states (dar wajd), watchingover them lest they be excluded from service at the proper time.Junayd then met up with Nerc and asked whether his shouting wasof any benefit with God, or if contentment was not better, andletting one’s heart be resigned? Nerc immediately stopped his shout-ing and praised Junayd for his good counsel (T.A. II.50.10 –20;MSM pp.226 –7).This complex narrative shows very clearly the intensity of Nerc’sexperience of altered states. It has certain similarities with the nar-rative concerning his last days: the total distraction and trance-likewandering, and the lengthy duration of this condition. It providesgood evidence that such incidents were characteristic of his life, andthat experiences like these were not uncommon.The charismatic nature of Nerc’s personality is demonstrated byhis ability to affect others, just as he was affected. We have notedabove Sarraj’s narrative about Nerc upsetting a scholarly assemblyand turning their academic discussion into an occasion of samAW.His ‘emotional’ nature and his love of poetry was well known, aswas his opposition to the rule of the intellect (Waql) with its inabilityto comprehend the transcendent.9 These various aspects of his char-acter are illustrated in this single narrative recorded by Sarraj.Nerc practised a radical faith which verged on the borders ofacceptability. The most audacious incident recorded in the sourcesconcerns his being found sitting and weeping with an unknownperson. When the other departed, Nerc confided to his companionsthat this person was in fact Iblcs who was telling him about his life"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE199and the pain of separation from God (T.A. II.51.17–21; MSMpp.227–8). Nerc’s weeping with him shows not only the daring natureof his faith, but his deep compassion for others, including Iblcs.This is consistent with a narrative in which Jawfar al-Khuldc (d.?)overhears Nerc praying for mercy on those condemned to hellfire.Actually he implores God who ‘has the power to fill Hell with me’10to transport Hell’s inhabitants to Paradise! Jawfar’s amazement atthese words subsides after he is assured in a dream that Nerc’sprayer has been heeded (T.A. II.51.21–52.2; MSM p.228).His compassion extended to all people: a thief who stole hisclothes; a poor man whose ass had died and who had no means oflivelihood; and two young Greek (probably Christian) slaves whowere caught in a fire in the bazaar. For his efforts in this latterincident, Nerc refused to take the gold reward offered by the slaveowner (T.A. II.52.19ff; MSM p.229).Some of the many sayings of Nerc will be considered later, but toend this sketch of his life, the remarkable circumstances of his lastdays must be reiterated. It is consistent with his character, andnoteworthy for our purposes, that his death was the result of hislove for samAW. According to the older sources, Sarraj and Ghazalc,Nerc was overcome with ecstasy at a samAW gathering, and began towander about in a trance. He happened upon a bed of newly cutreeds, the sharp stems of which cut his feet and legs. Oblivious tothe wounds, he keep wandering all night until daylight, when hewas taken home, his feet swollen and bleeding. He died a fewdays later, presumably from septicaemia (LumaW 290.11–7;ISyAXII.288.16–20: Mcd. pp.716 –7).According to wAuuar, the event which induced his ecstatic beha-viour was his meeting with a blind man. The man was repeatingGod’s name over and over; Nerc asked him what he knew of God,and, if he knew anything, why he was still alive. This questioning ofthe blind man apparently induced the ecstasy. wAuuar also adds thepious detail that when Nerc bled, the drops of blood formed thename of God in the dust (T.A. II.55.5 –12; MSM pp.229–30). Thereis no mention of an association with samAW in wAuuar’s account.There is, however, the implication of Nerc being in a threshold stateof consciousness, susceptible to being induced into ecstasy at anymoment, given the appropriate stimulus. The implication of wAuuar’saccount is that Nerc’s accusation of falsehood directed at the blindman rebounded. He suddenly realised the potential and the impliedmeaning of his statement, which sent him into an altered state of"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE200consciousness. Ironically, in wAuuar’s account, this ecstatic state ledto Nerc’s own death and the ‘fulfilment’ of the challenge that oneclaiming knowledge of God should not be living.This more colourful narrative of wAuuar’s, however, has less cred-ibility than the earlier, more trustworthy sources. It is consistentwith what is known of Nerc’s character that he would have joyfullyparticipated in samAW, as in the accounts of Sarraj and Ghazalc. Itis also in keeping with his character that this action should leadto a trance-like condition which had such a tragic outcome. Hisdeath occurred in 295/907; he was by then nearly 70 years old, andhis austere life had probably weakened him physically. Junayd aptlysummed up the loss of his great friend with the words: ‘half ofSufism is gone’.11A brief life of ShiblcBorn in 247/861 in Samarrax or Baghdad, Abe Bakr Dulaf al-Shiblcwas descended from a family originally from Transoxiana.12 Hecame to Sufism late in life, at about the age of 40, having first hada career as a court official and governor of Damawand. His firstmaster was Khayr Nassaj of Samarrax (d.322/934), but soon hecame under the influence of Junayd in Baghdad, with whom he hada long and complex relationship.His ‘conversion’ to a life of asceticism came during a visit toBaghdad accompanied by the governor of Rayy. Both officialsreceived a robe of honour from the Caliph, but on the return jour-ney, the governor of Rayy suddenly sneezed and wiped his nose onthe robe. When word got back to the Caliph, the man was strippedof both robe and office, which set Shiblc thinking. He returned toBaghdad and resigned from his official post, proclaiming before theCaliph: ‘The King of the world has given me a robe of honour,namely the love and knowledge of Him; how will He ever approvemy using it as a handkerchief in the service of a mortal?’ (T.A.II.161.3 –14; MSM p.278.)When Shiblc became a disciple of Junayd, the latter set up a seriesof penances and austerities lasting for several years, designed tohumble the new recruit. The reason for this was to counteract Shiblc’searlier life of privilege as a court official. Hujwcrc quotes Junayd’sstatement to Shiblc at the outset: ‘Abe Bakr, your head is full ofconceit, because you are the son of the Caliph’s principal chamber-lain, and the governor of Samarrax. No good will come from you"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE201until you go to the market and beg of everyone whom you see,that you may know your true worth’ (Kashf 468.15ff; Nich. p.359).Under Junayd’s regime of austerities, Shiblc was forced to be aseller of sulphur (kibrCt) for a year, in order to do away with hispride (kibriyAX). He spent a year as a beggar, and was then made togive restitution to those he had wronged as governor. After anotheryear as a beggar, during which time his takings were distributed tothe poor, he was admitted to Junayd’s circle as a servant (T.A.II.161.15ff; MSM p.279).By this time, Shiblc’s behaviour began showing the signs of instab-ility which were to become characteristic of him. It is difficult tosay if this was a result of the austerities of Junayd’s training and theextreme asceticism he came to adopt. It may simply have been partof his personality, and this appears to be how the Sufi sourcesaccept it.During this period of instability and unusual behaviour, he sud-denly heard a voice saying: ‘How long will you go about seeking theName? If you are a true seeker, set about finding the Namer!’ Whatensued is one of the most remarkable incidents of altered states inthe whole of Sufi literature. Shiblc suffered a full-scale psychoticepisode, whose detailed and vivid description is a credit to the nar-rative skill of wAuuar. This episode will be dealt with in more detaillater, but briefly, he became dangerously agitated and restless, triedto commit suicide by various means, and was finally chained andtaken to the Baghdad asylum (T.A. II.162.10 –163.3; MSM pp.279–80). This was the first of several episodes which led to his restraintand committal.During Shiblc’s confinement he would sometimes receive visitorswith whom he would discourse rationally and with a clear mind.His lucidity on these occasions led to speculation that he was notinsane at all, and that he feigned madness in order to conceal hisinfidelity. Shiblc himself said, in speaking of Hallaj, ‘We are of onemind, but my madness (junEnC) saved me, while his intellectdestroyed him’ (Kashf 190.15 – 6; Nich. p.151).When Shiblc was released, his behaviour on many later occasionswas unusual to say the least, while his self-mortifications becameincreasingly austere. Some of his more bizarre actions can be re-garded as symbolic or ritual in nature. Once he was seen runningwith a burning coal in his hand; when questioned about this, hereplied: ‘I am running to set fire to the Kaaba, so that men may onlycare for the Lord of the Kaaba!’ (T.A. II.163.13 – 4; MSM p.281).This is a symbolic expression of the Sufi’s disregard for outward"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE202ceremony, and his intense concern with inward spirituality. Similarly,he was observed holding a piece of wood with both ends alight: ‘toset on fire hell with one end and paradise with the other, so thatmen may concern themselves only with God!’ (T.A. II.163.15 –7:MSM p.281.)These symbolic or ritual aspects of Shiblc’s behaviour are note-worthy in Sarraj’s account of his strange actions. It is recorded thathe burned expensive clothes, perfumes and food, again claimingthat these were distractions (LumaW 400.5 –11). Both Sarraj andHujwcrc record that he threw away large sums of money, sometimesinto the river Tigris, sometimes giving it to anyone other than hisfamily (LumaW 400.11–5;Kashf 287.17ff; Nich. p.228).These and similar actions inevitably brought censure and criti-cism upon Shiblc, from ordinary people and conservative scholarsalike. Hujwcrc records that on one occasion, when he entered thebazaar, he was called a madman (majnEn), but his reply was: ‘MayGod increase my madness and your sense!’ He claimed that hismadness was the result of intense love of God, while the ordinarypeople’s ‘sense’ was the result of intense heedlessness (Kashf 196.14 –9; Nich. p.156). manbalite scholars in particular criticised Shiblc’soutlandish actions, his wastefulness and neglect of his family, hispretentious speech, and painful austerities.Indeed, he was censured on numerous occasions by the moremoderate Junayd for his ‘intoxicated’ approach to Sufism, and forpublic preaching and disclosure of mysteries. As with many otheraspects of Shiblc’s career, his public preaching was intimately con-nected with altered states of consciousness. wAuuar relates how Shiblcwould preach publicly when ‘his state was strong’ (hAlat-i u quwwatqirift), that is, when he became overwhelmed or intensely inspired.On such occasions, he would publicly disclose the intimate secretsof Sufi teachings more usually discussed at private gatherings (T.A.II.166.14 –9; MSM p.282). Junayd’s rebuke provoked this responsefrom Shiblc: ‘I speak what I hear; in both worlds what is there apartfrom me? Nay, for self is a word which goes from God to God, andShiblc is not in the midst’ (T.A. II.166.17–9; MSM p.282). Thisdeclaration of the involuntary nature of his public utterances wasaccepted by Junayd as proof of the genuineness of his altered state.Yet even here he was regarded by the famous Sufi master as goingbeyond the usual behaviour of mystics. With the moderate tem-perament of Junayd, Shiblc’s behaviour was uncalled for; his actionswere not only extreme by external standards, but by the standardsof mainstream Sufis as well."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE203His behaviour, his beliefs and his attitudes kept Shiblc fromcentre stage, and relegated him to the radical periphery of Sufism.This was the region inhabited by mallaj, though for differing rea-sons, and by other lesser known mystics of earlier and later times.Despite being away from the mainstream, however, Shiblc and theother radicals play an extremely important part in the history anddevelopment of Sufi ideas and practice. Junayd dismissed him as‘intoxicated’, yet he acknowledged that were he less so, he would beof benefit to many (LumaW 307.8 –10). This presumably refers to hisqualities of personality, as a teacher or master with profound ideasand deep spiritual experience.One of the reasons preventing Shiblc from assuming this import-ant role was the persistent distress he suffered from the onset ofcertain altered states. The major psychotic episode so dramaticallyportrayed by wAuuar has been referred to above; but there weremany lesser episodes which tormented Shiblc from time to time.On one occasion, writes Hujwcrc, he was assailed by a voice whileattempting to enter a mosque. Unable either to turn back or toenter in without the voice challenging him, Shiblc cried: ‘O God, Iimplore Thee to help me against Thyself!’ (Kashf 378.4 –9; Nich.p.294.) On another occasion, records wAuuar, he went into ecstasiesand began tearing his clothes upon hearing a singing voice at theBab al-oaq gate in Baghdad. Once again he was hauled before theauthorities, and when questioned he claimed to have heard: ‘I stood,I stood at the Gate of Continuance! (bAb al-bAq)’ (T.A. II.171.13 –7). The meaningful substitution of the letter bAX for UA X brought onthis immediate ecstatic state.There are several other such incidents recorded in the sourcesshowing that Shiblc was constantly susceptible to the onset of alteredstates. Yet what may also have prevented his playing a more import-ant role as a teacher and leader was his deliberate rejection of worldlyconnections. This was partly the result of his severe asceticism,numerous examples of which are recorded in wAuuar’sMemorial. Abrief statement attributed to Shiblc found in Sulamc’sOabaqAt, how-ever, illustrates in succinct form his radical rejection of the worldwhich goes far beyond ascetic austerities. It is recorded that he said:‘Were all the world to accept me, it would certainly be a disaster forme; but since their drink is not mine, and their taste not mine, theyhave not accepted me’ (T.S. 342.7–9).13 This statement reveals histhinking, that he sees himself as rejected and alienated from most ofhumanity, but deliberately so; it is his choice not to be received bya world so utterly in opposition to his own beliefs and experience."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE204His final departure from the world entailed almost a rejection ofthe practice and belief of mainstream Islam: on his deathbed herefused the rites of the dying, and refused to repeat the shahAda, thebasic statement of faith. His dying hours also entailed a desperatestruggle within his soul. He was possessed of an urgent restlessness,punctuated by periods of quiet. At first he was envious of Iblcs’‘favoured’ position in being cursed by God; later he was assailed bythe opposing forces of ‘His loving kindness and wrath’. He finallyexpired after refusing to repeat the words of the shahAda. He had,in his own words ‘rejoined the Beloved’. His death occurred in theyear 334/945, when he was well into his eighth decade.The role of samAW and altered statesThese brief biographies demonstrate the important role played bysamAW in the lives of Nerc and Shiblc, and the significance of alteredstates in their experience. Indeed it is not an exaggeration to claimthat, for the mystic, the value of direct experience is paramount,and here samAW and the apprehension of altered states are funda-mental. It is perhaps true to say that for Shiblc, his experience ofaltered states was often accompanied by distress and unpleasantassociations. With Nerc, on the other hand, there was more a joyfulapprehension of altered experience, often associated with some aspectofsamAW.NErC’s altered state experienceThere are three principal occasions recorded in Nerc’s biographywhich present evidence for major episodes of altered state experience.The first is the occasion, as mentioned above, when Nerc wasseen wandering about with a brick, neither eating nor sleeping, butperforming the obligatory prayers at the correct times. The mainsource for this incident is wAuuar’sMemorial (T.A. II.50.10 –20; MSMpp.226–7), but Kalabadhc in his KitAb al-TaWarruf (Book of Know-ledge) also has a shortened version of the narrative.14 In Kalabadhc’saccount Nerc is situated in the Shenczcya mosque, rather than wander-ing around with a brick in his hand. There is more of an emphasison the doctrinal and theoretical implications in Kalabadhc’s account,the question of ‘passing away’ and being ‘preserved’ in one’s dutiesforming the main focus of the discussion. This may well be import-ant, but wAuuar’s version again wins out as the more full-bloodedand lifelike, with less of a didactic and dogmatic underpinning."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE205The question which occupied Junayd and his associates was thatof the genuineness of Nerc’s trance-like behaviour. Junayd arguedthat it was genuine, and that God ‘preserves’ those in altered statesso that they fulfil their required duties at the right time. Some of hiscompanions disagreed, claiming that in genuine trance there is noawareness of prayer times or ritual ablutions.The delineation of Nerc’s condition is unclear, the accounts sug-gesting that at least some features of classic dissociation are present.These include the almost total distraction and trance-like wandering,the lengthy duration of the condition, and the lack of desire for foodor sleep. At the same time, however, there seems to be a ‘channel’of awareness open to sensory stimuli such as that required for theperformance of ritual prayers. Unless one accepts a totally super-natural explanation for this aspect of Nerc’s actions, the positionsargued by Junayd and by his companions can both be seen as parti-ally correct. Some general state of dissociation was operating: thefasting, lack of sleep, distraction and involuntary shouting all pointto a trance-like state. His performance of the rituals surroundingdaily prayers indicates that a channel of consciousness was open tothe surrounding world, this being described by Junayd as God’s‘preservation’ and guarding of those in a transformed state. It doesnot mean, as Junayd’s companions argued, that Nerc was feigningan occurrence of ecstatic behaviour. Yet the ease and rapidity withwhich he emerged from his trance back to everyday conscious-ness following Junayd’s counselling suggests that Nerc’s reasoningfaculties were not totally closed off. The concept of a limited chan-nel of consciousness open to the reasoning of ordinary speech andsome other stimuli best accounts for this situation. In psychologyit is recognised that the symptoms of pathological trance may bereduced by environmental cues and the ministration of others.15 Intrance and glossolalia conditions, this notion of a channel appearsfruitful in explaining the emergence of subjects from these alteredstates.16 Junayd’s companions were thus partially correct in arguingthat Nerc’s altered state was in some ways ‘incomplete’.wAuuar relates that Nerc thanked Junayd for his words of goodcounsel which had acted to bring him out of his trance state andback to ordinary consciousness. His immediate gratitude and praisefor Junayd suggests that the condition had been one of some dis-tress or discomfort for Nerc, and that he was pleased to return toan everyday state. It is important to note also that there was nomention of samAW as a cause or contributory factor in this condition.NeitherwAuuar nor Kalabadhc suggests any reason for the onset of"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE206this altered state. The narratives do, however, offer some clues whichmight point to the cause of the episode. Taken together, Kalabadhc’ssetting in the Shenczcya mosque, and wAttar’s reference to his repeat-ing aloud the name of God could indicate that some ritual invocationordhikr might have been involved.The second incident relating to Nerc is wholly different in char-acter, but there is available to us a better understanding of itscause. In fact, Nerc himself does not undergo any transformationof state, but such is the charismatic power of his personality andhis enthralling verse recitation that he entrances a whole group ofpeople. What is even more astonishing is that the group of peopleinvolved were an assembly of scholars, meeting to discuss points oftheology. This is perhaps the most unpromising group of candidatespossible to be the subjects of a mass charismatic transformationof consciousness. The susceptibility of such a group of rationallyfocused intellectuals to the entrancing power of samAW must be verylimited indeed.It is related that Nerc remained silent during the meeting ofscholars while their discussions proceeded. Suddenly he began torecite four verses of love poetry dealing with the complaint of separa-tion, neglect and misunderstanding. At once the whole group roseup and were induced into ecstasy (LumaW 304.18–305.7).The reason for Nerc’s rather daring and successful attempt atmass entrancement must surely be associated with his views on thenature of ‘intellect’ (Waql) and hence on those scholars who followits guidance. His opposition to the rule of intellect is well docu-mented, Kalabadhc noting his statement that ‘the intellect is weak,and that which is weak only guides to what is weak like itself ’.17 InNerc’s view, reason and intellect alone cannot apprehend the tran-scendent, nor provide direct experience or proof of divine realities(LumaW 37.14ff ).The assembly of scholars, vainly attempting to arrive at know-ledge by means of reasoning and intellect, must have struck Nercas an occasion of great folly deserving scorn and disdain. His massentrancement was an unexpected breakthrough of the power ofpoetry and emotion to completely overwhelm the sway of un-inspired intellect upon these scholars. Nerc’s love of poetry and hisemotional character is shown in this somewhat humorous situation.These dry, scholarly discussions are overturned by the pure play oflove poetry and its emotive consequences."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE207The third incident relates directly to Nerc’s own participation insamAW and his direct experience of its power. Given that one of his‘definitions’ of what it means to be a Sufi is participation in samAW,itfollows that he was often occupied with this activity. Furthermore,it is fitting that Nerc’s death should have resulted directly from hisparticipation in this practice.The events of his last days have been preserved for us in threedifferent sources, Sarraj, Ghazalc, and wAuuar, the earlier two beingthe more trustworthy accounts. The details have been recountedabove in the section on the life of Nerc, and need not be repeatedhere.What does require fuller explanation is the nature of the trancewhich so completely overwhelmed Nerc when he heard the recital atthesamAW gathering. According to Sarraj and Ghazalc, he arose andwandered about distractedly, repeating all night the words of theverse which had entranced him. The fact that he cut his feet andlegs from stumbling onto newly mown reed beds also indicates hisinsensitivity to pain. The bleeding and injury evidently had no effecton his awareness. There are many similarities between the descrip-tion of this trance-like state and the earlier recorded episode inwhich he wandered about with a brick. Such states may well havebeen a regular occurrence in Nerc’s life, with a similar pattern ofeffects in each.The symptoms described in the sources point to a classic trancestate. The action of ‘rising up’ (qAma) indicates the onset of thestate initiated by his listening to verse recital, perhaps with musicalaccompaniment. Nerc wandered and stumbled about involuntarily,and was heard repeating automatically the words of poetry whichhad initiated his state. Such highly stereotyped and patternedbehaviour is also a classic feature. Insensitivity to pain, and beingoblivious to one’s surroundings and to the passing of time is alsosymptomatic of a trance state.The conclusion of Nerc’s state is also of interest, since the sourcesleave some ambiguity as to the cause of his death a few days later.The most likely cause is the suppuration of his legs and feet, theirswelling and wound injuries, which would have led to septicaemia.That this occurred over several days is a likely outcome. The sourcesdo not state specifically the course of events, however, merely refer-ring to his being carried home where he died some days later. It ispossible that his trance state continued for these remaining days,and that he did not recover from its effects."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE208Before moving on from Nerc’s experience of altered states, it wouldbe worthwhile to consider some of his many sayings on the subject,and his own descriptions of such states.The source texts are peppered with snatches of verse attributed toNerc and attesting to his renown as a poet and lover of poetry. Theepisode recounted above of his disrupting the scholars’ gatheringwith verses of love poetry attests to this renown. Some of the verseattributed to him is of a very high order of poetry. The followinglines are translated rather expansively by Arberry, but they manageto convey something of the subtlety of the original:So passionate my love is, I do yearnTo keep His memory constantly in mind:But O, the ecstasy with which I burnSears out my thoughts, and strikes my memory blind!And, marvel upon marvel, ecstasyItself is swept away: now far, now nearMy lover stands, and all the facultyOf memory is swept up in hope and fear.(Doctrine of the ZEfCs, p.106)The kernel of Nerc’s thought here is that contemplation or loveof the Divine is so overwhelming that the very contemplation (dhikr)itself is made nought in the process. This is a basic tenet of the notionoffanAX (passing away from ordinary consciousness) in Sufism, butis here expressed in terms of its experiential characteristics, of beingoverwhelmed in the act of contemplation or remembrance.This experiential reference to being overwhelmed also has a directbearing on samAW and the actions and behaviours which accompanyit. At another point in Kalabadhc’sKitAb al-Tawarruf, Nerc is quotedas saying that ‘Ecstasy is a flame which springs up in the secretheart, and appears out of longing, and at that visitation (wArid) themembers are stirred to joy or grief ’ (Doctrine, pp.116 –17). Thenotion of ecstasy as a flame of fire arising from the ‘secret heart’appears also in Ghazalc’s description found in his ISyAX (II.266.16ff;Mcd. p.199). The direct result of this ‘ecstasy’ for Nerc, however, isits behavioural manifestations, its stirring of the body to action ofan unusual sort. This is a reference to the type of event whichovercame Nerc in his experience of altered states, and in his trance-like behaviours.In a statement about the nature of ‘ecstasy’ (wajd) recorded inwAuuar’sMemorial, Nerc stresses its paradoxical ineffability: ‘By God,"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE209how incapable is the tongue in describing its reality, and how dumbis eloquent erudition in describing its essence, for the experience ofecstasy is among the greatest of experiences.’ He goes on to say that‘no pain is too painful for the cure of ecstasy’ (T.A. II.54.11–14).This linking of wajd (‘ecstasy’, or ‘intense experience’) with illnessand the suffering of pain is apposite, since Sulamc records an incidentwhere both Nerc and Junayd speak eloquently of their experienceof illness. On one occasion, both Sufis became ill; for Junayd, it isan opportunity to speak of his experience of pain, but Nerc, on theother hand, chooses to keep silent. When questioned about this, headmits that he has suffered pain, but goes on to express his feelingsin verse:If I was worthy of illness,then you (illness) are worthy of praise;It is pleasant, and the heart remains no longer,it says to illness: ‘Stay a while!’(T.S. 167.11–168.5)When Junayd heard what Nerc had said, he replied that he toowished to ‘reveal something of the essence of the power within us’,and similarly began to recite verse:I exalt what came from you,for it was more glorious than you;And in the intimacy of my heart, youare more glorious than can be imagined;You obliterated me from all I was,so how can I take heed of the cause?(T.S. 168.6 –10)This verse of Junayd’s is difficult and elusive, though it appears tospeak of the experience of wajd and fanAX. Nerc’s verse is perhapsmore understandable, as he seems to welcome the experience ofillness and pain. He speaks of it as having a similar effect on theheart as that of ecstasy and fanAX, the experience of ‘passing away’.It was mentioned earlier that Paul Nwyia recently discovereda work attributed to Nerc which describes mystical experience insymbolic language. Nwyia claims that his discovery of the MaqAmAtal-QulEb is an advance on our former reliance on anecdotes and smallfragments in the hagiographies.18 He also claims that this image-based work of Nerc’s is not ‘studied’ or developed to any degree,"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE210and that it deals with the level of experience, rather than thatof concepts and thought. These claims by Nwyia cannot really beupheld upon reading Nerc’sMaqAmAt al-QulEb.19 The promise ofan experiential description of mystical states is not fulfilled; ratherwhat is presented is a work of symbolic interpretation and allegoryquite removed from the level of experiential data.It is this raw data, expressed so often in fragmentary utter-ances and snatches of narrative, that gives us a clearer picture ofNerc’s situation. Such is the experiential description which has beenattempted here, drawing upon the diverse source texts with theirscattered fragments of information about his life, actions and say-ings. The picture which this leaves us is one of an intense, spirituallyaware man who had a passion for direct experience of the divine,and for expressing what he felt in a variety of ways. He clearlyenjoyed the activity of samAW, though this indulgence eventually ledto his death. He was fond also of poetry, and had almost charis-matic powers in conveying his passion for recited verse. Nor was hea stranger to the unusual effects of samAW and the experience ofaltered states of consciousness.ShiblC’s altered state experienceThe first documented episode of Shiblc being subject to altered statescomes fairly late in his life, following his ‘conversion’ to Sufism atabout the age of 40 and a period of austere training as a disciple ofJunayd’s. It is arguable that the severity of his discipleship, theyears of fasting, begging and menial tasks, led to some mental instab-ility. Shiblc’s earlier life was that of a privileged member of a highsocial class, and the easy life which this would have entailed con-trasted greatly with his new life as a Sufi acolyte. Perhaps this con-trast was too great for him to bear; or perhaps his instability waspresent all along, particularly since there is no detailed account ofhis earlier life. Whatever the preceding circumstances, it is clear thatunusual behaviours and states of mind soon became manifest onceShiblcfinished his early discipleship (T.A. II.162.10 –19; MSM,pp.279 – 80).wAuuar details the most formidable of the episodes which seemedto occur with some frequency in Shiblc’s later life, and which led tofrequent committals to the Baghdad asylum. This important episodeis a classic case of psychosis, and it is brilliantly and sympathet-ically portrayed by wAuuar. It shows all the author’s narrative skill andis a fine example of pre-modern writing describing the symptoms of"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE211a particular psychological condition (T.A. II.162.20 –163.3; MSM,pp. 280 –1).Shiblc had been showing signs of an unusual state of mind, andsome strange behaviours. Distributing lumps of sugar or money tochildren who repeated the name of ‘God’, he felt a sudden changeof heart and unleashed a sword, threatening to kill anyone whouttered the name of God unheedingly. He then went around in-scribing the divine name wherever he could, until suddenly he ‘heard’a voice saying to him: ‘How long will you go about seeking theName? If you are a true seeker, set about finding the Namer! (or theNamed)’. This audition began for Shiblc a remarkable altered stateexperience, though his preceding actions and state of mind mightalso be included in this. The ‘voice’ had such an effect on him thathe lost his composure, ‘love’s power took hold’, as wAuuar describes,and he became distracted, overwhelmed and agitated. The statewhich overtook Shiblc made him become suicidal, and he attemptedvarious means of killing himself: throwing himself into the Tigris,self-immolation, seeking out hungry lions, and throwing himself offa mountain top. Each of these means proved unsuccessful, the forcesof nature rebuffing his various attempts in a kind of benign con-spiracy to protect him from danger. The river cast him back uponthe shore, the fire did not burn him, the hungry lions ignored him,and so on. This benign ‘conspiracy’ only frustrated Shiblc and madehis agitation worse, compounding the distress he already sufferedby not allowing him to be delivered from his torment. His anxiety andagitation increased so much that he had to be restrained and com-mitted to the asylum where he apparently recovered after some time.The proximate cause of the episode is given as Shiblc’s hearing a‘voice’ which urged him to stop seeking the Name, and to seek theNamer (or the Named). The source of this voice is not clearly stated,though it is often the case in wAuuar’s writing that such voices areassumed to be divine in origin. Perhaps this is not clearly stated inthe present case because of the obvious negative outcome of hearingthis voice. While there may be some ambiguity here, in modernmedical terms there would be little doubt about the psychotic qual-ity of such an audition.There are several major symptoms of psychosis present in thisdescription of his condition. First, he is overwhelmed by anxietyand restlessness, though described in rather general terms by wAuuar.The Persian word used is bC-qarArC, which has a wide range of mean-ings including ‘instability, restlessness and disturbance’. The picturegiven is that of a generalised and severe agitation of body and mind,"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE212a derangement which robs the individual of all composure and equi-librium. When Shiblc was thwarted by natural forces in his attemptsat suicide, his agitation increased ‘a thousandfold’, as wAuuar statesin hyperbolic fashion. His failure to commit suicide clearly com-pounded his frustration and anxiety, which was already severe.A second clear sign of the pathological nature of the episode isShiblc’s attempt at suicide. The message of the ‘voice’ drove him todistraction, and we can surmise that his intense anxiety and innertorment caused him to seek deliverance from his suffering by end-ing his life. There are many parallels here with a psychotic illnesswhere auditory hallucinations and the accompanying anxiety stateslead many sufferers to attempt deliverance through suicide. It isalso clear that this was no temporary state or momentary process; hisvaried attempts at suicide indicate a lengthy and deliberate processof journeying to mountains and to areas where wild lions roamed,and so on.This points to a third sign of disturbed behaviour, namely hisdistracted wandering and journeying in his attempts to commitsuicide. This is probably best seen as a directedness of behaviourakin to what may be seen in trance states. Some of the qualitiesassociated with trance may be seen in Shiblc’s behaviour, such as aninner orientation and directedness, obsession and lack of regard forconsequences.The result of this episode in Shiblc’s life was a period of com-mittal to the Baghdad asylum, where his health eventually improvedand he was released. At first he needed restraint with chains andbonds, an evident sign of insanity in an age when very little treatmentwas available. wAuuar also relates that the Caliph appointed some-one to oversee his treatment, and to administer medicine to him. Itis noted that they needed to do this by force as he was unwilling toaccept treatment voluntarily. Shiblc remarked: ‘Do not take suchtrouble, for this is not such an illness that yields to medicine’ (T.A.II.163.8–9; MSM, p.281). During his stay in the asylum, he wasallowed visitors. On one occasion some visitors called him a mad-man, which prompted a very lucid retort from Shiblc: ‘In your eyesI am mad and you are sane (hushyAr); may God increase my mad-ness and your sanity so that I may be brought nearer (to Him) bythat means, and you may be driven further away (from Him)’ (T.A.II.163.4 –7; MSM, p.280). On another occasion some people claim-ing friendship with him came to visit, but he threw stones at them,making them run away. He disowned their friendship, seeing thatstones could so easily drive them apart (T.A. II.163.9 –13; MSM,"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE213p.281). There is no indication of the duration of Shiblc’s stay in theasylum. We can only assume that it was lengthy, because of theseverity of his condition and the lack of available treatment.This episode remains the most dramatic and important of Shiblc’saltered state experiences. It is a case where the more negative anddistressing aspects of altered consciousness come into play. In Shiblc’scase, it could be argued that this major episode had profoundimplications for his life afterwards. He probably never recoveredfully, as there were other lapses into strange states and behavioursrecurring for the rest of his life.It also provided him with a legitimate excuse for outlandishness,not only in behaviour, but also in speech and belief, which he couldrely on in times of persecution and heresy trials. His lucidity whenvisited in the asylum could mean that his insanity was not real, thathe was feigning madness for other reasons, such as the concealmentof unconventional beliefs. Yet the fact that people suffering psy-choses often have periods of lucidity is no argument against thereality of their illness, and this applies fully in Shiblc’s case. There issome truth to the suggestion, however, that his madness insulatedhim from harsher consequences meted out by the legal and religiousauthorities. Referring to the fate of mallaj, he commented that ‘Weare of one mind, but my madness saved me, while his intellectdestroyed him’ (Kashf 190.15 – 6; Nich. p.151). At mallaj’s executionscene, Shiblc was one of the accusers who denounced him. Hismotive for doing so cannot be other than his wish to save his ownlife. Yet it can be argued that his frustration and disillusionmentmust have grown intense at seeing the message preached by mallajso utterly rejected and denounced by his fellow believers. Whatother recourse was there except madness and bizarre behaviour forone so committed to the truth of radical mysticism as Shiblc was?When he was inspired, he would go about preaching and disclosingsecrets heard only behind closed doors. This was exactly what mallajhad done, and for this Shiblc earned the wrath of Junayd (T.A.II.166.14 – 9). Was there any other avenue left for one such as Shiblcapart from the refuge of madness?20Michael Dols, however, argues that it was in fact Shiblc’s intel-ligence which saved him, while mallaj’s madness destroyed him, toparaphrase Hujwcrc’s statement.21 His simulation of madness due tohis real intelligence accounts for his rejection of mallaj at the gallows,where he was showing wisdom and prudence.Perhaps his madness was not genuine, but a ruse to protect hisunconventionality. There is at least some truth in this, yet Shiblc"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE214himself testified to his insanity, as does any independent scrutiny ofhis behaviour and state of mind. In the end it would be unwise toignore both his own testimony and the evidence of objective ana-lysis. Yet while most psychotic episodes must be seen as destructiveof the personality and utterly distressing for the person concerned,this is not the case with Shiblc’s period of psychosis. The evidenceof his own words to his visitors in the asylum is illustrative of asurprising attitude toward his altered state experience. He askedGod to increase his madness, because by this means he was broughtnear to the divine presence; the corollary was that he asked for‘normal’ people to have their normality increased, for by this meansthey moved further away from the divine presence. These are notthe words of one who is regretful, fearful or distressed by his experi-ence, wishing for it to depart and to leave him in peace. Rather hewelcomes what by any realistic criterion is destructive and negative;in fact he seeks its increase! It is the reality of spiritual experienceand nearness to the divine presence which is his ultimate goal, evenif the means to this experience involves intense suffering. By thecriteria of mysticism this goal and quest is the ultimate, the mostprized, and in the end the only goal worth seeking.There are several other, shorter episodes of Shiblc’s altered stateexperience recorded in the sources. Not all of them were as distress-ing as this first major episode. For example, Sarraj records thatShiblc would imitate a rapturous state whenever he heard a particu-lar verse of secular love poetry; evidently his feeling for poetry wassimilar to that of Nurc’s (LumaW 292.1–3). On one occasion, Sarrajmentions that in a similar rapturous state Shiblc expressed the sen-timent that ‘Only He knows what is in my heart’, a confirmation ofthe intimate link he felt between himself and God (LumaW 304.7–9).A more extended and profound episode occurred once duringthe month of Ramadan, as recorded in three of the sources. Sarraj,Ghazalc and Qushayrc all relate an incident which occurred duringRamadan prayers in a mosque. When the prayer leader recited acertain verse, Shiblc cried out and turned green (or red, according toGhazalc) and began trembling uncontrollably, repeating over andover: ‘With such words do lovers converse!’22 The features of thisaltered state have been discussed in Chapter 4 and need not berepeated here.Shiblc’s major episode of psychosis was apparently activated byhis ‘audition’ of a voice. This was not an isolated occurrence, as thesources record two other, less traumatic episodes of altered state"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE215which were activated by the same means. The first of these casesinvolved his ‘mishearing’ the voice of a singer at the Bab al-oaqgate in Baghdad. It is reported that Shiblc lost consciousness andbegan tearing his garment upon hearing the poetry of a street singer.He was taken before the authorities and was asked for an explana-tion. Shiblc answered that he ‘heard’ the singer recite ‘I stood, Istood in the Bab al-Baq (the gate of continuance)’, whereas every-one else had heard the singer recite ‘Bab al-oaq’ (a place name)(T.A. II.171.13 –7). The reason for Shiblc’s being overwhelmed wasthe apparent reference of the singer to his standing in the ‘gate ofcontinuance’. The word bAq is cognate with baqAX, the complementoffanAX, which taken together indicate the ultimate state of ecstaticexperience in Sufism.Hujwcrc relates a narrative which involved Shiblc in the auditionof a more threatening voice with paranoiac elements which left himin a distressed and bewildered state. In a chapter dealing with puri-fication, Hujwcrc relates that Shiblc once purified himself and went toenter a mosque. A voice within himself began assailing him, askingwhether he was so pure as to enter Our house with such boldness.Shiblc began to turn back whereupon the voice asked ‘Do you turnback from Our door? Where will you go?’ Caught in an impossiblesituation, Shiblc let out a cry to which the response came: ‘Do yourevile Us?’ But even his standing silent brought a rebuke: ‘Do youintend to endure Our affliction?’ In desperation he exclaimed: ‘Iimplore God to help me against Yourself !’ (Kashf378.4 –9; Nich.p.294.) This is a rather strange account of being assailed by a ‘voice’from within, though undoubtedly meant to be taken as divinelyinstigated, and the impossible situation in which Shiblc is placed byits taunts. The high demands it places on his every action, and thechallenge to his every move appears like the projected conscience ofan extreme ascetic. It is as if his own scrupulous standards of purityhave finally come to haunt him after years of meticulous formationand the imposition of innumerable austerities.In this narrative, Shiblc’s inner conscience has reached the levelof almost paranoiac persecution and attack on the subject, withhis every move or lack thereof challenged and threatened by thisdemanding master. The likelihood that the roots of this ‘voice’ werein Shiblc’s own ascetic conscience provides an explanation whichfits well with what is known of his life and character.The possibility of the voice being psychotic in nature also con-forms to Shiblc’s character. All the classic elements of a paranoiacaudition are present: the threatening and overwhelming voice, the"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE216subject being rendered helpless from decisive action, the hostility ofthe voice toward the subject, and so on. Even the text hints at thevoice’s subjective nature with the mention of it arising from withinhis inner self.Neurologically, such auditions can be seen as the invasion bysecondary circuits of the primary ego/consciousness circuit, the neuralmechanism which allows ordinary cognitive functioning and dataprocessing. This overflow or disruption by secondary circuits is usu-ally prevented in ordinary consciousness as the latter resonates withthe external world. People suffering from psychosis, however, maynot be able to distinguish themselves clearly from the outside worldbecause many of their secondary pathways are accessible to theirprimary ego circuit, and they are thus susceptible to hallucinatedvoices.23What is clear from this narrative is that the earlier psychoticepisode was not an isolated occurrence. It is likely that several suchdisturbing events beset Shiblc during his long life.A further occurrence of altered state experience recorded by wAuuarhad direct implications for Shiblc’s relations with fellow Sufis andwith the world at large. This relates to his career as a roving‘preacher’,wAuuar noting that ‘when his state (SAla) was intense’ hewould go about preaching in public (T.A. II.166.14 –9; MSM p.282).This evidently refers to his being overwhelmed by divine inspirationor spiritual fervour which impelled him to go about spreading theSufi message to all hearers. There is clearly the notion of an alteredstate involved here, with reference to the intensification of his ‘state’and the sense of urgency and the involuntary impulse to preach.Shiblc says as much himself in his reply to Junayd’s reproach to himfor preaching secrets and ‘mysteries’ heard only behind closed doors.He declares the involuntary nature of his actions and public utter-ances in replying to Junayd: ‘I speak what I hear; in both worldswhat is there apart from me? Nay for self is a word which goes fromGod to God, and Shiblc is not in the midst’ (T.A. II.166.17–9;MSM p.282). Junayd’s reproachful attitude toward Shiblc for pro-claiming mysteries in public is assuaged by this statement which heaccepts as indicating the forcefulness and impulsion behind Shiblc’sstate of inspiration.Shiblc’s experience of altered states shows a more dramatic, intenseand darker quality than does the parallel experience of Nerc. Thismust obviously stem from their differing personalities. The warmer,more poetic and outward-looking Nerc met with experiences which"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE217were more benign and exhilarating. Shiblc’s more intense, asceticand inwardly inclined personality shows itself in the darker andmore threatening character of what he encountered. That the char-acter of the individual is reflected in their encounter of wajd isalready mentioned by some of the Sufi authors, notably Sarraj andGhazalc. It does not mean that their experience is nothing buta subjective encounter; rather, in Ghazalc’s words, ‘when the heartis moved, there is manifested what it contains’ (ISyAX II.266.19;Mcd. p.199).It is also noteworthy that there is little mention of samAW relatingto Shiblc’s experience of altered states. It is not that he was opposedto the practice, as there are several accounts of his involvement inthe activity. It may be more that his response to samAW was unlikethat of Nerc, that he was not as positive and receptive to its influ-ence. For Shiblc, the experience of altered states was more associ-ated with the darker forces of his personality, with his own encounterof the twilight world which borders on insanity.The importance and consequences of samAWand altered statesThe importance of samAW and the experience of altered states canhardly be overstated in relation to the lives of these two mystics.For Nerc, the practice of samAW was part of the definition of what itmeant to be a Sufi. As Nerc was an enthusiastic champion of itspractice, it is natural that he should embrace it in such an over-whelming way, and with such a joyous spirit of poetry and play.For him it was more important to disrupt the dry discussion of theacademic gathering, and to replace it with the sheer joy and raptureofsamAW by the recital of secular love poetry.The most important aspect of samAW and altered state experienceis that these form part of the direct ‘taste’ (dhauq) or apprehensionof divine Realities. This immediate experience is the very goal andreason for the Sufi’s existence. It is not a minor pastime or diver-sion, an activity to amuse novices, but one of the most significant ofall the mystic’s activities, which leads most directly to the divinepresence. Nerc expressed this notion most eloquently in the poeticfragments which were discussed above. In fact, it was also the painderiving from bodily illness which allowed an apprehension ofecstatic feeling not unlike that associated with samAW. In a relatedway, Shiblc’s major psychotic episode allowed him to approach thedivine presence, and for this reason he wanted his insanity to increase!"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE218His apprehension of a psychotic state, for most people threatening,distressing and unwelcome, allowed him to ‘taste’ the nearness ofGod, and to achieve a means of approach not otherwise possible.The consequence of participation in samAW was for Nerc a genuinelife and death choice. His entry into a trance state, and the con-sequent injury he suffered due to a lack of pain sensitivity, led directlyto his death. This is indeed a high price to pay for his participationin this otherwise ecstatic and joyful activity.For Shiblc the consequence of his cultivation of altered statesthrough intense asceticism was a descent into madness and his com-mittal to an asylum. It is clear that he deliberately sought a moreintense experience of the divine presence through years of strictascetic practices and austerities. He did not shun the psychosis whichwas one of the results of this approach to spiritual Reality, but ratherhe welcomed the new insight this offered. A cultivation of alteredstates also led to his being inspired to go about publicly preachingmystical secrets not otherwise divulged. This impulsive inspirationled to conflict and disagreement with the more cautious Junayd.What is more, it led to Shiblc being open to the charge of uncon-ventionality in belief and practice. His retreat into madness mayhave been due to a desire to veil the unconventionality of his belief,and to prevent his being accused of heresy. But his bizarre publicbehaviours coupled with his acknowledged psychotic state led tosuspicions and doubts about the soundness of his beliefs and prac-tice. Shiblc was prepared to accept the charge of infidelity, andeven to be put on trial for heresy, as occurred once in associationwith Nerc. He was prepared to accept life as an outcast, indeed herelished the opportunity to live in a state of rejection from a worldso opposed to his uncompromising beliefs. He could do this know-ing that his real goal as a Sufi was for a deeper appreciation of thedivine presence and an experience of the state of grace that thisallowed.It is clear that this yearning for direct appreciation of religiousexperience was one of the main driving forces behind Nerc’s andShiblc’s lives as mystics. It is also clear that neither man was import-ant as a theoretician or teacher; their importance was in their prac-tice of the mystical path. In this, the quality of their experience ofthe divine was paramount. The isolated utterances recorded in thesource writings and the narratives of their actions best express theraw experience they encountered. For these two ecstatic mystics,the experience of samAW and altered states was the key direction oftheir upward journey."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"THE PARADIGMATIC EXPERIENCE219Notes1 See, for example, studies such as Gerhard Böwering,The MysticalVision of Existence in Classical Islam, Berlin, New York, NY: Walter deGruyter, 1980; and Ali Hassan Abdel-Kader, The Life, Personality andWritings of Al-Junayd, London: Luzac, 1976.2 See Paul Nwyia, Exégèse coranique et langage mystique, Beirut: Daral-Machreq, second edition, 1991, pp.316 – 48.3 Nwyia, op.cit., pp.316–17.4 See Peter J.

It is clear that the more formal and ritual practice of samAWseenin later centuries was still in the process of evolution. The precisehistory of these practices may be difficult to chronicle, and it wasnot the task of the present work to attempt this. Nor was it pos-sible to give a detailed account of the ritual ceremonies from theseformative years, beyond the bare outlines offered incidentally bythe source texts.The main contribution of the present study was in examining thepsychology associated with these practices. The behaviours, ecstaticsayings and states of experience witnessed in ritual samAW, and inmore casual ‘listening’ situations, were discussed in a phenomeno-logical framework. Such an approach has been made possible inrecent years with the emergence of altered state research and cross-cultural psychology studies.The physical reactions and behaviours evoked by ritual samAW andby other listening situations are multifaceted. There are a wide vari-ety of reactions in many different situations, involving a numberof different individuals of varying status and background. Equally,there appear to be a variety of causal factors, and a variety of precip-itating conditions, such as fasting or other ascetic deprivations. It"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONS221cannot be concluded that there is a single response or conditionevoked; nor is there a single causal or contributory factor.Some of the reactions indicate a dissociative cause from deepwithin the psyche; this is especially evident in trance-like and epilepti-form reactions. The evidence suggested, however, that such dis-sociative reactions were present in only a minority of cases. Manyof the reactions indicate more casual factors operating: everydaycauses such as anxiety or fear reactions, emotional release and othermore familiar explanations. Physiological factors were also seen,including the effects of ascetic practices, the deprivations of fasting,and hyperventilation caused by repeated chanting.Gilbert Rouget’s work, Music and Trance, has been the only previousstudy which suggested an explanatory model for these behaviouraland consciousness changes. Rouget suggested a distinction between‘ritual’samAW, which resulted in a culturally sanctioned trance state,and ‘non-ritual’samAW which resulted in a crisis outcome beyondthe bounds of cultural acceptance. The difficulty with this explana-tion, apart from being a circular argument, is its uncritical adoptionof mainstream religious prescriptions for the practice of samAW. Whilethis distinction may hold for the performance of ritual samAW cer-emonies, it does not adequately explain much of the evidence fromthe texts of the early Sufi period. Even within religiously sanctionedpractices, there are often ‘crisis’ outcomes, to which Rouget’s theorydoes not apply. Outside the formal practice of samAW this explana-tion is even less plausible as there are many ‘non-crisis’ outcomesbeyond sanctioned ritual.Two important considerations emerged from our discussion. Thefirst related to the factors causing trance or altered states among anumber of individuals. It was clear from the texts that in severalsituations episodes of altered states occurred with very little pro-mpting or evocation from external stimuli. This suggests that theindividuals concerned were experiencing ‘borderline’ states of con-sciousness, and that these were an everyday part of their lives. Alteredstates sometimes arose from insignificant triggers, such as the mis-heard cry of a street vendor, or a chance encounter with a reciter orsinger. This suggests that the person involved was psychologicallyprepared by means of deprivation, ascetic practices, chanting, andso on. The occurrence of these episodes in everyday situations meantthat this preparedness extended well beyond a ritual environment"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONS222where susceptibility is likely to be greater. In these cases, a seeminglysmall trigger was required to alter the person’s everyday, ordinaryperceptions to a changed reality where special meanings were per-ceived in otherwise insignificant stimuli.The second consideration which arose from our discussion ofaltered states involves the connection between the explanations ofmainstream psychology, and the understanding of the early sourcewriters. Until very recently, the consensus of psychology, with theinbuilt bias of Western sciences, was to regard these phenomenaas abnormal, dysfunctional or pathological. This may have beenone reason for the lack of attention to this area of Sufi and Islamicstudies. In recent years, however, with developments in the area ofconsciousness studies, and cross-cultural psychology, the bias ofseeing these states as abnormal and pathological has changed. Ithas been recognised, for example, that ritual or institutionalisedforms of trance occur in around 90 per cent of societies studiedethnographically.1 The near universality of this phenomenon meansthat it cannot be regarded as abnormal, despite Western bias, anddespite the lack of thorough psychological explanations.For the Sufi authors studied here, the integration of these unusualbehaviours and states into a cohesive religious and social frame-work was never really in question. The conduct of the majority ofSufis who encountered these states was accepted and tolerated, andseen as part of their living religious experience. This is the case evenwith the sober and cautious writing of Sarraj, whose apologeticpurpose was to explain and integrate Sufi teaching and conductinto mainstream Sunni Islam. That he writes of these phenomenawith such candour and openness is a witness to their acceptanceand tolerance as part of legitimate religious experience. An exampleof this is that Sarraj includes in his work several chapters devoted toa commentary on the more questionable sayings and actions attri-buted to Abe Yazcd al-Bisuamc. Even here, the author’s purpose isone of inclusion and harmonisation of unusual mystical experiencewith the bases of Islamic belief and practice.Certainly there were conservative critics of the Sufi path, particu-larly critics of their more extravagant and unusual behaviours. It isfor this reason that authors such as Sarraj and Qushayrc wrote theirapologetic works.Equally, there were a number of radical or outspoken Sufis whosebehaviour and beliefs often stretched the bounds of acceptability.Our discussion in Chapter 9, dealing with the lives and experience"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONS223of Nerc and Shiblc, shows this quite conclusively. As we have seen,Shiblc spent time in the Baghdad asylum recovering from psychosis,being considered outside the social convention of sanity. Yet hehimself saw his psychosis as divinely inspired, furthering his devel-opment as a seeker of unitary experience. He integrated what wouldotherwise be a disruptive and terrifying episode into his life’s jour-ney of seeking nearness and encounter of the Real (al-Saqq). Shiblc’sown understanding of his situation is reflected in the writings whichrecorded his words and actions for later generations. If an integralunderstanding was possible then, how should abnormality andpathology explain his condition now? If his experience was part of alife quest for wholeness, why should we regard it as dysfunctionaland pathological?The emergence of new understandings in psychology over the lastfew decades has made this integrative argument tenable. This alsogives more legitimacy to the Sufis’ own understanding of these states,exemplified in the texts studied here. It is true that one must acceptthe underlying assumptions of the Sufi world-view to concur fullywith their psychology. Yet, even if this is not possible, the Sufiwriters’ psychology still makes an important contribution. The inclu-sion and acceptance of unusual states and behaviours within theprevailing religion and culture is valuable and exemplary. This ac-ceptance of non-ordinary states of consciousness is only now beinggiven credence in contemporary Western sciences.Apart from the unusual states and behaviours discussed in thisstudy, there were also the sayings of the Sufis during their encoun-ters with altered consciousness. A range of different types of say-ings were found; some purely descriptive, some more cryptic sayings,some ecstatic outbursts, or lyrical and poetic fragments. With thisrange there was also found a variety of possible causal factors. CarlErnst has done research on the slightly different phenomenon ofecstatic sayings or shaUSCyAt, published in Words of Ecstasy in Sufism,and other writings. This is certainly one area where more inquirywould be fruitful, particularly on the literary side, for example withthe poetry of Shiblc or Nerc, which could not be attempted in thispresent study.A further area where future inquiry would be profitable is inthe documentation of ritual ceremonies associated with samAW amongcontemporary Sufi communities. There already exists the excel-lent fieldwork of Regula Qureshi, which has been relied on for the"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONS224purposes of the present study. Most contemporary performanceseems to involve traditions and customs which developed later thanthe period under study in this book. The survival of rituals fromprior to the seventh/thirteenth century is a topic which needs ad-dressing. There have been no studies which correlate contemporaryperformances with these early textual sources; such inquiry wouldhave taken the present work beyond manageable limits.It was possible, however, to glean from the early texts a numberof details concerning social aspects of samAW performance and thesocial framework of Sufi groupings. The organised structures ofSufi orders which are observable from later periods are representedrather more loosely in the earlier texts. In many instances, the wholesocial organisation of the Sufi ‘community’ was none other than agroup of personal followers of a revered master or teacher. Theceremonies or rituals carried out by that community were thus por-trayed in the texts as quite spontaneous and informal gatheringsor performances, rather than the structured and formal ceremonialsof a larger religious order. By this means, the texts allow us toobserve something of the early stages in the development of ritualand ceremony.In the last chapter of the study, the lives of two important ‘ecstatic’Sufis were considered, particularly in regard to the role of samAWandaltered states in their religious experience. This biographical surveysought to exemplify many of the issues dealt with more abstractlyin previous chapters by applying these issues to the life histories ofNerc and Shiblc. The importance of samAW was seen particularlywith Nerc, who was an enthusiastic practitioner, and of whom manyincidents in his life related to its performance and enjoyment. It wasfitting, though somewhat ironic, that his death was also caused as aresult of his participation in a samAW performance. Shiblc, on theother hand, was better known for his frequent encounters with darkeraltered states. Yet at other times his experience was of a more benignnature, where he was animated and awakened by a spirit of intensereligious fervour.Most importantly for these two ecstatic personalities, altered stateexperience formed part of their direct ‘taste’ (dhauq) or apprehensionof divine Reality. This direct knowledge was the principal reasonfor their religious journey, and the goal of their lives. Scatteredreferences in varying sources allow us to piece their lives togetherand form a coherent picture of their deeds and sayings. These diverseaccounts provide the most direct approach to their experience whichit is possible for us to gain."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"CONCLUSIONS225Given the admitted limitations of the present study, further researchin this area will surely produce more fruitful outcomes. We canlook forward to a greater understanding of this fascinating area ofSufism, and of human behaviour generally.Note1 See Richard J.
